<text>A motel, also known as a motor hotel, motor inn or motor lodge, is a hotel designed for motorists, usually having each room entered directly from the parking area for motor vehicles rather than through a central lobby. Entering dictionaries after World War II, the word &quot;motel&quot;, coined as a portmanteau of &quot;motor hotel&quot;, originates from the defunct lodging compound establishment; The Milestone Mo-Tel in San Luis Obispo, California (later renamed as &quot;Motel Inn&quot;), which was built in 1925. The term referred to a type of hotel consisting of a single building of connected rooms whose doors faced a parking lot and in some circumstances, a common area or a series of small cabins with common parking. Motels are often individually owned, though motel chains do exist.

As large highway systems began to be developed in the 1920s, long-distance road journeys became more common, and the need for inexpensive, easily accessible overnight accommodation sites close to the main routes led to the growth of the motel concept. Motels peaked in popularity in the 1960s with rising car travel, only to decline in response to competition from the newer chain hotels that became commonplace at highway interchanges as traffic was bypassed onto newly constructed freeways. Several historic motels are listed on the US National Register of Historic Places.

==Architecture==


Motels differ from hotels in their location along highways, as opposed to the urban cores favored by hotels, and their orientation to the outside (in contrast to hotels, whose doors typically face an interior hallway). Motels almost by definition include a parking lot, while older hotels were not usually built with automobile parking in mind.

Because of their low-rise construction, the number of rooms which would fit on any given amount of land was low compared to the high-rise urban hotels which had grown around train stations. This was not an issue in an era where the major highways became the main street in every town along the way and inexpensive land at the edge of town could be developed with motels, car dealerships, fuel stations, lumber yards, amusement parks, roadside diners, drive-in restaurants, theaters, and countless other small roadside businesses. The automobile brought mobility and the motel could appear anywhere on the vast network of two-lane highways.

===Layout===
Motels are typically constructed in an I-, L-, or U-shaped layout that includes guest rooms; an attached manager&#x27;s office; a small reception; and in some cases, a small diner and a swimming pool. A motel was typically single-story with rooms opening directly onto a parking lot, making it easy to unload suitcases from a vehicle. A second story, if present, would face onto a balcony served by multiple stairwells.

The post-war motels, especially in the early 1950s to late 1960s, sought more visual distinction, often featuring eye-catching colorful neon signs which employed themes from popular culture, ranging from Western imagery of cowboys and Indians to contemporary images of spaceships and atomic era iconography. U.S. Route 66 is the most popular example of the &quot;neon era&quot;. Many of these signs remain in use to this day.

===Room types===
In some motels, a handful of rooms would be larger and contain kitchenettes or apartment-like amenities; these rooms were marketed at a higher price as &quot;efficiencies&quot; as their occupants could prepare food themselves instead of incurring the cost of eating all meals in restaurants. Rooms with connecting doors (so that two standard rooms could be combined into one larger room) also commonly appeared in both hotels and motels. A few motels (particularly in Niagara Falls, Ontario, where a motel strip extending from Lundy&#x27;s Lane to the falls has long been marketed to newlyweds) would offer &quot;honeymoon suites&quot; with extra amenities such as whirlpool baths.

==History==

The first campgrounds for automobile tourists were constructed in the late 1910s. Before that, tourists who couldn&#x27;t afford to stay in a hotel either slept in their cars or pitched their tents in fields alongside the road. These were called auto camps. The modern campgrounds of the 1920s and 1930s provided running water, picnic grounds, and restroom facilities.

===Auto camps and courts===
Auto camps predated motels by a few years, established in the 1920s as primitive municipal camp sites where travelers pitched their own tents. As demand increased, for-profit commercial camps gradually displaced public campgrounds.

Until the first travel trailers became available in the 1930s, auto tourists adapted their cars by adding beds, makeshift kitchens and roof decks. The next step up from the travel trailer was the cabin camp, a primitive but permanent group of structures. During the Great Depression, landholders whose property fronted onto highways built cabins to convert unprofitable land to income; some opened tourist homes. The (usually single-story) buildings for a roadside motel or cabin court were quick and simple to construct, with plans and instructions readily available in how-to and builder&#x27;s magazines.

Expansion of highway networks largely continued unabated through the depression as governments attempted to create employment, but the roadside cabin camps were primitive, basically just auto camps with small cabins instead of tents.

The 1935 City Directory for San Diego, California, lists &quot;motel&quot;-type accommodations under tourist camps. One initially could stay in the Depression-era cabin camps for less than a dollar per night, but small comforts were few and far between.

Travelers in search of modern amenities soon would find them at cottage courts and tourist courts. The price was higher, but the cabins had electricity, indoor bathrooms, and occasionally a private garage or carport. They were arranged in attractive clusters or a U-shape. Often, these camps were part of a larger complex containing a filling station, a café, and sometimes a convenience store. Facilities like the Rising Sun Auto Camp in Glacier National Park and Blue Bonnet Court in Texas were &quot;mom-and-pop&quot; facilities on the outskirts of towns that were as quirky as their owners. Auto camps continued in popularity through the Depression years and after World War II, their popularity finally starting to diminish with increasing land costs and changes in consumer demands.

In contrast, though they remained small independent operations, motels quickly adopted a more homogenized appearance and were designed from the start to cater purely to motorists.

===Tourist homes===
In town, tourist homes were private residences advertising rooms for auto travelers. Unlike boarding houses, guests at tourist homes were usually just passing through. In the southwestern United States, a handful of tourist homes were opened by African Americans as early as the Great Depression due to the lack of food or lodging for travelers of color in the Jim Crow conditions of the era.

&quot;The Negro Motorist Green Book&quot; (1936–64) listed lodgings, restaurants, fuel stations, liquor stores, and barber and beauty salons without racial restrictions; the smaller &quot;Directory of Negro Hotels and Guest Houses in the United States&quot; (1939, U.S. Travel Bureau) specialized in accommodations. Segregation of U.S. tourist accommodation would legally be ended by the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and by a court ruling in &quot;Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States&quot; affirming that Congress&#x27; powers over interstate commerce extend to regulation of local incidents (such as racial discrimination in a motel serving interstate travelers) which might substantially and harmfully affect that commerce.

===Early motels===
The term &quot;motel&quot; originated from a lodging establishment called &quot;Milestone Mo-Tel&quot; in San Luis Obispo, California, which was constructed in 1925 by Arthur Heineman. In conceiving of a name for his hotel, Heineman combined the two words &quot;motor hotel&quot; into one word as &quot;mo-tel&quot;, after he found that he could not fit the words &quot;Milestone Motor Hotel&quot; on the rooftop. Therefore, the word &quot;motel&quot; and literally the first motel was born. Many other similar businesses followed in its footsteps and started building their own auto camps, as well as calling themselves &quot;motels&quot;. Later, as a result of failing to obtain a registered trademark for the word &quot;Mo-Tel&quot; or &quot;motel&quot;, Milestone Mo-Tel was renamed simply as &quot;Motel Inn&quot;.
Combining the individual cabins of the tourist court under a single roof yielded the motor court or motor hotel. A handful of motor courts were beginning to call themselves motels, a term coined in 1926. Many of these early motels are still popular and are in operation, as in the case of the 3V Tourist Court in St. Francisville, Louisiana, built in 1938.

During the Great Depression, those still traveling (including business travelers and traveling salespeople) were under pressure to manage travel costs by driving instead of taking trains and staying in the new roadside motels and courts instead of more costly established downtown hotels where bell captains, porters, and other personnel would all expect a tip for service.

In the 1940s, most construction ground to a near-halt as workers, fuel, rubber, and transport were pulled away from civilian use for the war effort. What little construction did take place was typically near military bases where every habitable cabin was pressed into service to house soldiers and their families.

The post-war 1950s ushered in a building boom on a massive scale. By 1947, approximately 22,000 motor courts were in operation in the U.S. alone; a typical 50-room motel in that era cost $3000 per room in initial construction costs, compared to $12,000 per room for metropolitan city hotel construction. By 1950 there were 50,000 motels serving half of the 22 million U.S. vacationers; a year later motels surpassed hotels in consumer demand. The industry peaked in 1964 with 61,000 properties and fell to 16,000 properties by 2012.

Many motels began advertising on colorful neon signs that they had &quot;air cooling&quot; (an early term for &quot;air conditioning&quot;) during the hot summers or were &quot;heated by steam&quot; during the cold winters. A handful used novelty architecture such as wigwams or teepees.

===Expansion===
The 1950s and 1960s was the pinnacle of the motel industry in the United States and Canada. As older mom-and-pop motor hotels began adding newer amenities such as swimming pools or color TV (a luxury in the 1960s), motels were built in wild and impressive designs. In-room gimmicks such as the coin-operated Magic Fingers vibrating bed were briefly popular; introduced in 1958, these were largely removed in the 1970s due to vandalism of the coin boxes. The American Hotel Association (which had briefly offered a Universal Credit Card in 1953 as forerunner to the modern American Express card) became the American Hotel &amp; Motel Association in 1963.

As many motels vied for their place on busy highways, the beach-front motel instantly became a success. In major beach-front cities such as Jacksonville, Florida, Miami, Florida, and Ocean City, Maryland, rows of colorful motels such as the Castaways, in all shapes and sizes, became commonplace.

===Guidebooks===

The original motels were small, locally owned businesses which grew around two-lane highways which were main street in every town along the way. As independents, the quality of accommodation varied widely from one lodge to another; while a minority of these properties were inspected or rated by the American Automobile Association and Canadian Automobile Association (which have published maps and tour book directories of restaurants and rooms since 1917), no consistent standard stood behind the &quot;sanitized for your protection&quot; banner. There was no real access to national advertising for local motels and no nationwide network to facilitate reservation of a room in a distant city.

The main roads into major towns therefore became a sea of orange or red neon proclaiming VACANCY (and later COLOR TV, air conditioning, or a swimming pool) as competing operators vied for precious visibility on crowded highways. Other venues for advertising were local tourist bureaus and postcards provided for free use by clients.

A rating in the &quot;Directory of Motor Courts and Cottages by the American Automobile Association&quot; was just one of many credentials eagerly sought by independent motels of the era. Regional guides (such as &quot;Official Florida Guide by A. Lowell Hunt&quot; or &quot;Approved Travelers Motor Courts&quot;) and the food/lodging guidebooks published by restaurant reviewer Duncan Hines (&quot;Adventures in Good Eating&quot;, 1936 and &quot;Lodging for a Night&quot;, 1938) were also valued endorsements.

===Referral chains===

The referral chain in lodging originated in the early 1930s, originally serving to promote cabins and tourist courts. A predecessor of the modern &quot;franchise chain&quot; model, a referral chain was a group of independent motel owners in which each member lodge would voluntarily meet a set of standards and each property would promote the others. Each property would proudly display the group&#x27;s name alongside its own.

United Motor Courts, founded in 1933 by a group of motel owners in the southwestern U.S., published a guidebook until the early 1950s. A splinter of this now-defunct group, Quality Courts, began as a referral chain in 1941, but was converted to a franchised operation (Quality Inn) in the 1960s. Budget Host and Best Value Inn are also referral chains.

Best Western (1946) was a similar referral chain of independent western U.S. motels. It remains in operation as a member-owned chain, although the modern Best Western operation shares many of the characteristics (such as centralized purchasing and reservation systems) of the later franchise systems.

===Ownership chains===
The earliest motel chains, proprietary brands for multiple properties built with common architecture, were born in the 1930s. The first of these were ownership chains, in which a small group of people owned and operated all of the motels under one common brand.

Alamo Plaza Hotel Courts, founded 1929 in East Waco, Texas, was the first such chain with seven motor courts by 1936 and more than twenty by 1955. With Simmons furniture, Beautyrest mattresses on every bed, and telephones in every room, the Alamo Plaza rooms were marketed as &quot;tourist apartments&quot; under a slogan of &quot;Catering to those who care.&quot;

In 1935, building contractor Scott King opened King&#x27;s Motor Court in San Diego, California, renaming the original property Travelodge in 1939 after having built two dozen more simple motel-style properties in five years on behalf of various investors. He incorporated and expanded the entire chain under the TraveLodge banner after 1946.

In 1937, Harlan Sanders opened a motel and restaurant as Sanders Court and Café alongside a fuel station in Corbin, Kentucky; a second location was opened in Asheville, North Carolina, but expansion as a motel chain was not pursued further.

===Franchise chains===

In 1951, residential developer Kemmons Wilson returned to Memphis, Tennessee disillusioned by motels encountered on a family road trip to Washington, D.C. In each city, rooms varied from well-kept to filthy, few had a swimming pool, no on-site restaurant meant a few miles driving to buy dinner, and (while the room itself was $8 to $10) motor courts charged $2 extra per child, substantially increasing costs of a family vacation. He would build his own motel at 4941 Summer Avenue (U.S. 70) on the main highway (U.S. 70) from Memphis to Nashville, adopting a name from a 1942 musical film &quot;Holiday Inn&quot; about a fictional lodge only open on public holidays. Every new Holiday Inn would have TV, air conditioning, a restaurant, and a pool; all would meet a long list of standards in order to have a guest in Memphis to have the same experience as someone in Daytona Beach, Florida or Akron, Ohio. Originally a motel chain, Holiday Inn was first to deploy an IBM-designed national room reservations system in 1965 and opened its 1000th location by 1968.

In 1954 a 60-room motor hotel in Flagstaff, Arizona, opened as the first Ramada (Spanish for &quot;a shaded resting place&quot;). The Twin Bridges Motor Hotel, established in 1957 near Washington, D.C. as a member of Quality Courts, became the first Marriott in 1959, expanding from motel to hotel in 1962.

For individual motel owners, a franchise chain provided an automated central reservation system and a nationally recognized brand which assured consumers that rooms and amenities met a consistent minimum standard. This came at a cost; franchise fees, marketing fees, reservation fees, and royalty fees were not reduced during times of economic recession, leaving most of the business risk with the franchisee while franchise corporations profited. Some franchise contracts restricted the franchisee&#x27;s ability to sell the business as a going concern or leave the franchise group without penalty.

For the chain, the franchise model allowed a higher level of product standardization and quality control than was possible as a referral chain model while allowing expansion beyond the maximum practical size of a tightly held ownership chain.

In some cases, loosely knit ownership chains (such as Travelodge) and referral chains (such as Quality Courts, founded in 1939 by seven motel operators as a non-profit referral system) were converted to franchise systems.

Quality Courts (1939) and The Best Western Motels (1946) were both originally referral chains and largely marketed together (as Quality Courts were predominantly east of the Mississippi River) until the 1960s. Both built national supply chain and reservation systems while aggressively removing properties not meeting minimum standards. In 1963, their paths diverged. Quality Courts became Quality Inn, abandoning its former co-operative structure to become a for-profit corporation, use shareholder capital to build entirely company-owned locations, and require its members to become franchisees, while Best Western retained its original member-owned status as a marketing co-operative.

===Freeway era===
With the introduction of chains, independent motels started to decline. The emergence of freeways bypassing existing highways (such as the Interstate Highway System in the U.S.) caused older motels away from the new roads to lose clientele to motel chains built along the new road&#x27;s offramps.

Some entire roadside towns were abandoned. Amboy, California (population 700) had grown as a Route 66 rest stop and would decline with the highway as the opening of Interstate 40 in 1973 bypassed the village entirely. The ghost town and its 1938 Roy&#x27;s Motel and Café were allowed to decay for years and used by film makers in a weathered and deteriorated state.

Even the original 1952 Holiday Inn Hotel Courts in Memphis closed by 1973 and was eventually demolished, as I-40 bypassed U.S. 70 and the chain repositioned itself as a mid-price hotel brand. The Twin Bridges Marriott was demolished for parkland in 1990.

Many independent 1950s-era motels would remain in operation, often sold to new owners or renamed, but continued their steady decline as clients were lost to the chains. Often the building&#x27;s design, as traditionally little more than a long row of individual bedrooms with outside corridors and no kitchen or dining hall, left it ill-suited to any other purpose.

===Market segmentation===
In the 1970s and 1980s, independent motels were losing ground to chains such as Motel 6 and Ramada, existing roadside locations were increasingly bypassed by freeways, and the development of the motel chain led to a blurring of motel and hotel.

While family-owned motels with as few as five rooms could still be found, especially along older highways, these were forced to compete with a proliferation of Economy Limited Service chains. ELS hotels typically do not offer cooked food or mixed drinks; they may offer a very limited selection of continental breakfast foods but have no restaurant, bar, or room service.

Journey&#x27;s End Corporation (founded 1978 in Belleville, Ontario) built two-story hotel buildings with no on-site amenities to compete directly in price with existing motels. Rooms were comparable to a good hotel but there was no pool, restaurant, health club, or conference center. There was no room service and generic architectural designs varied little between cities. The chain targeted &quot;budget-minded business travelers looking for something between the full-service luxury hotels and the clean-but-plain roadside inns&quot;, but largely drew individual travelers from small towns who traditionally supported small roadside motels.

International chains quickly followed this same pattern. Choice Hotels created Comfort Inn as an economy limited service brand in 1982. New limited-service brands from existing franchisors provided market segmentation; by using a different trademark and branding, major hotel chains could build new limited-service properties near airports and freeways without undermining their existing mid-price brands. Creation of new brands also allowed chains to circumvent the contractual minimum distance protections between individual hoteliers in the same chain. Franchisors placed multiple properties under different brands at the same motorway exit, leading to a decline in revenue for individual franchisees. An influx of newly concocted brands became a key factor in a boom in new construction which ultimately led to market saturation.

By the 1990s, Motel 6 and Super 8 were built with inside corridors (so were nominally hotels) while other former motel brands (including Ramada and Holiday Inn) had become mid-price hotel chains. Some individual franchisees built new hotels with modern amenities alongside or in place of their former Holiday Inn motels; by 2010 a mid-range hotel with an indoor pool was the standard required to remain a Holiday Inn.

===Decline===

In many once-prime locations, independent motels which thrived in the 1950s and 1960s were being squeezed out by the 1980s as they were forced to compete with growing chains with a much larger number of rooms at each property. Many were left stranded on former two-lane main highways which had been bypassed by motorways or declined as original owners retired and subsequent proprietors neglected the maintenance of buildings and rooms. As these were low-end properties even in their heyday, most are now showing their age.

In Canada, the pattern was most visible in the densely populated Windsor-Quebec Corridor, particularly the urban locations like Toronto&#x27;s Kingston Road motel strip once bypassed by the completed Highway 401, and the section of Highway 7 between Modeland Road and Airport Road known as the &quot;Golden Mile&quot; for its plethora of motels and restaurants (as well as points of interest such as the Sarnia Airport and Hiawatha Racetrack and Waterpark) which was bypassed by Highway 402. The decline of motels was also found at awkward rural locations formerly on the main road. Many remote stretches of the Trans-Canada Highway remain unbypassed by motorway and some independent motels survive.

In the U.S., the Interstate Highway System was bypassing U.S. Highways nationwide. The best-known example was the complete removal of Route 66 from the U.S. highway system in 1985 after it was bypassed (mostly by Interstate 40). U.S. 66 was particularly problematic as the old route number was often moved to the new road as soon as the bypasses were constructed, while Highway Beautification Act restrictions left existing properties with no means to obtain signage on the newly constructed Interstate. Some motels were demolished, converted to private residences, or used as storage space while others have been left to slowly fall apart.

In many towns, maintenance and renovation of existing properties would stop as soon as word was out that an existing highway was the target of a proposed bypass; this decline would only accelerate after the new road opened. Attempts by owners to compete for the few remaining clients on a bypassed road by lowering prices typically only worsened the decline by leaving no funds to invest in improving or properly maintaining the property; accepting clients who would have been formerly turned away also led to crime problems in cities.

By 1976 the term &quot;cockroach motel&quot; was well-established; a slogan for Black Flag&#x27;s trademark &quot;Roach Motel&quot; bug traps would be paraphrased as &quot;they check in, but they don&#x27;t check out&quot; to refer to these declining properties.
In declining urban areas (like Kingston Road in Toronto, or some of the districts along Van Buren Street in Phoenix, largely bypassed as a through route to California by Interstate 10), the remaining low-end motels from the two-lane highway era are often seen as seedy places for the homeless, prostitution, and drugs as vacant rooms in now-bypassed areas are often rented (and in some cases acquired outright) by social-service agencies to house refugees, abuse victims, and families awaiting social housing. Conversely, some areas which were merely roadside suburbs in the 1950s are now valuable urban land on which original structures are being removed through gentrification and the land used for other purposes. Toronto&#x27;s Lake Shore Boulevard strip in Etobicoke was bulldozed to make way for condominiums.

In some cases, historic properties have been allowed to slowly decay. The Motel Inn of San Luis Obispo, which (as the Milestone Motor Hotel) was the first to use the &quot;motel&quot; name, sits incomplete with what is still standing left boarded up and fenced off at the side of U.S. Route 101; a 2002 restoration proposal never came to fruition.

Alamo Plaza Hotel Courts, the first motel chain, was sold off in pieces as the original owners retired. Most of its former locations on the U.S. highway system have declined beyond repair or were demolished. One 1941 property on U.S. Route 190 in Baton Rouge remains open with its Alamo Plaza Restaurant now gone, its pool filled in, its original color scheme painted over, its front desk behind bulletproof glass, and its rooms infested with roaches and other vermin. A magnet for criminal activity, police are summoned daily. Other Alamo sites in Chattanooga, Memphis, and Dallas have simply been demolished.

The American Hotel and Motel Association removed &#x27;motel&#x27; from its name in 2000, becoming the American Hotel and Lodging Association. The association felt that the term &#x27;lodging&#x27; more accurately reflects the large variety of different style hotels, including luxury and boutique hotels, suites, inns, budget, and extended stay hotels.

===Modernization===
In the late 20th century, a majority of motels in the United States came under the ownership of people of Indian descent, particularly Gujaratis as the original &quot;mom and pop&quot; owners retired from the motel industry and sold their properties. However, some families still kept their motels, and to this day, one can find a motel owned by the same family who built and ran it originally (e.g. the Maples Motel in Sandusky, Ohio) with a subsequent generation continuing the family business.

Many low-end independent motels have had to adapt in order to remain competitive with Economy Limited Service franchise chains that continue to gain market share. For instance, motels that once touted color television as a luxury now come standard with numerous amenities comparable to economy limited service hotels, including flatscreen television, pay-per-view or in-room movies, microwave ovens, minibar fridges, and wireless Internet. Similar to modern hotels, motel rooms are now required to be reserved online using credit cards so guests cannot remain anonymous, and secured against intruders with key cards which expire as soon as a client checks out. Long-time independent motels which join existing low-end chains to remain viable are known as &quot;conversion&quot; franchises; these do not use the standardized architecture which originally defined many franchise brands.

While many former motel chains left the low-end of the market to franchise mid-range hotels, a handful of national franchise brands (Econo Lodge, Travelodge, Knights Inn and Magnuson Hotels lowest tier M-Star) remain available to owners of existing motels with the original drive-up-to-room motor court architecture.

Due to the negative stigma associated with &quot;motel&quot;, many surviving motel establishments which retain their original layout have since rebranded to &quot;hotel&quot;, &quot;inn&quot;, or &quot;lodge&quot;.

===Revitalization and preservation===
In the early to mid 2000s, much original 1950s roadside infrastructure on now-bypassed U.S. highways had fallen into decline or was being razed for development. The National Trust for Historic Preservation named the Wildwoods Shore motel district in New Jersey in its 2006 list of America&#x27;s Most Endangered Historic Places and included the Historic Route 66 Motels from Illinois to California on its 2007 list.

Preservationists have sought to list endangered properties on various federal or state historic registries, although in many cases a historic listing gives a building little or no protection from alteration or demolition.

The Oakleigh Motel in Oakleigh, Victoria, Australia, constructed using Googie architecture during the 1956 Summer Olympics as one of the first motels in the state, was added to the Victorian Heritage Register in 2009. The building was gutted by developers in 2010 for a row house development; only the outer shell remains original.

The Aztec Motel in Albuquerque, New Mexico (built in 1932) was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993 and listed on the New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties as the oldest continuously operating U.S. Route 66 motel in New Mexico. It was demolished in 2011. While listing the Coral Court Motel near St. Louis, Missouri, on the National Register of Historic Places failed to prevent a 1995 demolition, one of the cabins survives as part of an exhibit at the National Museum of Transportation after being painstakingly dismantled by volunteers for relocation.

====U.S. Route 66====

The plight of Route 66, whose removal from the United States Highway System in 1985 turned places like Glenrio, Texas and Amboy, California into overnight ghost towns, has captured public attention. Route 66 associations, built on the model of Angel Delgadillo&#x27;s first 1987 association in Seligman, Arizona, have advocated preservation and restoration of the motels, businesses, and roadside infrastructure of the neon era. In 1999, the National Route 66 Preservation Bill allocated $10 million in matching fund grants for private restoration and preservation of historic properties along the route. The road popularized through John Steinbeck&#x27;s &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; and Bobby Troup&#x27;s &quot;(Get Your Kicks On) Route 66&quot; was marketed not as transportation infrastructure but as a tourism destination in its own right.

To many small towns bypassed by Interstate highways, embracing 1950s nostalgia and historic restoration brings in badly needed tourism dollars to restore sagging local economies. Many vintage motels, some dating to the cabin court era of the 1930s, have been renovated, restored, and added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places or to local and state listings. While a handful were repurposed as either low-income housing, boutique hotels, apartments, or commercial/office space, many were simply restored as motels.

While some modern amenities (such as wi-fi or flatscreen TV) may appear in the newly restored rooms, exterior architecture and neon highway signage is meticulously restored to original designs. By 2012, Route 66 travelers were spending $38 million/year visiting historic places and museums in communities on the former highway, with $94 million annually invested in heritage preservation; &quot;The Motels of Route 66&quot; was announced as an upcoming documentary film.

==International variations==

The early motels were built in the southwestern United States as a replacement for the tourist camps and tourist cabins which had grown around the U.S. highway system. In Australia and New Zealand, motels have followed largely the same path of development as in Canada and the United States. The first Australian motels include the West End Motel in Ballina, New South Wales (1937) and the Penzance Motel in Eagle Hawk, Tasmania (1939).

Motels gained international popularity in countries such as Thailand, Germany, and Japan but in some countries the term &quot;motel&quot; now connotes either a low-end hotel (such as Hotel Formule 1 in Europe) or a no-tell motel.

===Canada===

As in the U.S., the initial 1930s roadside accommodations were primitive tourist camps, with over a hundred campgrounds listed in Ontario alone on one 1930 provincial road map. While most of these provided access to the most basic of amenities (like picnic tables, playgrounds, toilet facilities and supplies), fewer than a quarter offered cottages in the pre-Depression era, and the vast majority required travelers bring their own tents. In Canada&#x27;s climate, these sites were effectively unusable outside the high season.

Because cabins and camps were ill-suited to a Canadian winter, the number and variety of motels grew dramatically after World War II, peaking just before freeways such as Ontario Highway 401 opened in the 1960s. Due to Canada&#x27;s climate and short tourist season, which begins at Victoria Day and continued until Labour Day or Thanksgiving, any outdoor swimming pool would be usable for little more than two months of the year and independent motels would operate at a loss or close during the off-season.

By the 1980s, motels were losing ground rapidly to franchises such as Journey&#x27;s End Corporation and the U.S.-based chains. The section of Highway 7 between Modeland Road and Airport Road, known as the &quot;Golden Mile&quot; for its plethora of motels and restaurants was bypassed once Highway 402 was completed in 1982, however the Golden Mile still retains points of interest such as the Sarnia Airport and Hiawatha Racetrack and Waterpark.

Much of Canada&#x27;s population is crowded into a few small southern regions. While the Windsor-Québec corridor was bypassed by motorways relatively early, in more sparsely populated regions (including much of Northern Ontario) thousands of kilometers of mostly two-lane Trans-Canada Highway remain undisturbed as the road makes its lengthy journey westward through tiny, distant and isolated communities.

===Europe===

The original concept of a motel as a motorist&#x27;s hotel which grew up around the highways of the 1920s is of American origin. The term appears to have initially had the same meaning in other countries but has since been used in many places to refer either to a budget-priced hotel with limited amenities or a love hotel, depending on the country and language. The division between motel and hotel, like elsewhere, has been blurred, so many of these are low-end hotels.

In France, motel-style chain accommodations of up to three stories (with exterior hallways and stairwells) usually reach the &quot;one-star&quot; rank in France&#x27;s national tourism agency classification of tourist hotels. The Louvre Hôtels chain operates Première Classe (1 star) as a market segmentation brand in this range, using other &quot;marques&quot; for higher or mid-range hotels. The use of &quot;motel&quot; to identify any budget-priced roadhouse hotel (&quot;Rasthaus&quot;, &quot;Raststätte&quot;) also exists in the German language; some French chains operating in Germany (such as Accor&#x27;s Hotel Formule 1) offer automated registration and small, Spartan rooms at reduced cost.

In Portuguese, &quot;motel&quot; (plural: &quot;motéis&quot;) commonly refers not to the original drive-up accommodation house for motorists but to an &quot;adult motel&quot; or love hotel with amenities such as whirlpool baths, in-room pornography, candles and oversize or non-standard-shaped beds in various honeymoon-suite styles. These rooms are available for as little as four hours, and minors are excluded from these establishments. (The Portuguese-language term &quot;rotel&quot; had brief usage in 1970s Rio de Janeiro, Brazil for a similar concept, ro- for rooms through which clients rotate in a matter of hours instead of overnight.)

A similar association of &quot;motel&quot; to short-stay hotels with reserved parking and luxury rooms which can be rented by couples for a few hours has begun to appear in Italy, where the market segment has shown significant growth since the 1990s and become highly competitive.

===Latin America===
In Latin America, a &quot;motel&quot; (in Mexico, &quot;Motel de paso&quot;) is an establishment often associated with extramarital encounters and rented typically for a few hours (15 minutes to 12 hours). In Ecuador, any establishment with the title &quot;Motel&quot; is related to extramarital encounters; in Argentina and Peru these hotels for couples are called &quot;telo&quot; (from &quot;hotel&quot;) and offered for anything from a few hours to overnight, with décor based on amenities such as dim lights, a whirlpool and a king-size bed.

In the Dominican Republic, &quot;cabins&quot; (named for their cabin-like shape) have all these amenities (such as a whirlpool bath, oversize bed and HDTV) but generally do not have windows, and have private parking for each room individually. Registration is handled not in a conventional manner but, upon entering the room, by delivering a bill with the registration through a small window that does not allow eye contact to ensure greater discretion.

The connotations of &quot;motel&quot; as adult motel or love hotel in both the Spanish and Portuguese languages can be awkward for U.S.-based chains accustomed to using the term in its original meaning, although this issue is diminishing as chains (such as Super 8 Motels) increasingly drop the word &quot;motel&quot; from their corporate identities at home.

==Crime and illicit activity==
Many auto camps were used as havens and hide-outs for criminals of the 1920s; Bonnie and Clyde had a shootout in the infamous Red Crown Tourist Court near Kansas City on July 20, 1933. Courtney Ryley Cooper&#x27;s 1940 &quot;American Magazine&quot; article &quot;Camps of Crime&quot; attributed to J. Edgar Hoover a denunciation of tourist courts as bases of operation for gangs of desperadoes, claiming that &quot;a large number of roadside cottage groups appear to be not tourist camps but assignation camps&quot; and alleging that &quot;marijuana sellers have been found around such places.&quot;

Ultimately, efforts to curb the unconstrained growth of tourist courts were futile as motor courts (as motels were called in the 1930s and 1940s) grew in number and popularity.

Motels have served as a haven for fugitives in the past as the anonymity and a simple registration process helped fugitives to remain ahead of the law. Several changes have reduced the capacity of motels to serve this purpose. In many jurisdictions, regulations now require motel operators to obtain ID from clients and meet specific record-keeping requirements. Credit card transactions, which in the past were more easily approved and took days to report, are now approved or declined on the spot and are instantly recorded in a database, thereby allowing law enforcement access to this information.

Motels which allow a room to be rented inexpensively for less than one full night&#x27;s stay or which allow a couple not wishing to be seen together publicly to enter a room without passing through the office or lobby area have been nicknamed &quot;no-tell motels&quot; due to their long association with adultery. Even where rooms were rented overnight to middle-class travelers (and not locals or extended-stay clients) there have been ongoing problems with theft of motel property by travelers; everything from waterbeds to television sets to bedspreads and pillows have routinely gone missing in what one 1970s Associated Press report labelled &quot;highway robbery&quot;.

The least costly motels sometimes serve as temporary housing for people who are not able to afford an apartment or have recently lost their home. Motels catering to long-term stays occasionally have kitchenettes or efficiencies, or a motel room with a kitchen. While conventional apartments are more cost-effective with better amenities, tenants unable to pay first and last month&#x27;s rent or undesirable due to unemployment, criminal records or credit problems do seek low-end residential motels because of a lack of viable short-term options.

Motels in low-income areas are often plagued with drug activity, street prostitution or other crime. Some correctional officials temporarily place newly paroled convicts into motels if upon release they have nowhere to stay. These motels have daily to monthly rates.

According to the Center for Problem-Oriented Policing, 
The annual number of calls for service to police departments per room (&quot;CFS/room&quot;) as a metric has been used to identify motels with poor surveillance of visitors, inadequate staff or management unwilling to pro-actively exclude known or likely problem tenants. Motels with poor security in bad neighborhoods attract disturbances (including guests who will not leave or pay), robbery, auto theft and theft from rooms or vehicles, vandalism, public intoxication and alcoholism, drug dealing or clandestine methamphetamine laboratories, fighting, street gang activity, pimping and street prostitution or sexual assaults.

As severe unlawful conduct issues impact the neighborhood as a whole, some municipalities have adopted a nuisance abatement strategy of using public health and fire safety violations or taxation laws as pretexts to shut down bad motels. City bylaws such as Seattle&#x27;s &quot;Chronic Nuisance Properties&quot; ordinance have also been used to penalize owners or shut down a business entirely.

==In popular culture==

The Bates Motel is an important part of &quot;Psycho&quot;, a 1959 novel by Robert Bloch, and Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s 1960 film adaptation. &quot;Psycho II&quot;, &quot;Psycho III&quot; and &quot;Psycho IV: The Beginning&quot;, sequels to the film, also feature the motel, as does Gus Van Sant&#x27;s 1998 remake of the original film. A comedic 1987 television movie &quot;Bates Motel&quot; and the 2013 television series &quot;Bates Motel&quot;, a prequel to the films, both use the name of the motel as a title. In the 2010 Halloween TV special &quot;Scared Shrekless&quot;, Puss in Boots tells a cautionary tale about the &quot;Boots Motel&quot;.

The scenario of an isolated motel being operated by a serial killer, whose guests subsequently become victims, has been exploited in a number of other horror films, notably &quot;Motel Hell&quot; (1980) and &quot;Mountaintop Motel Massacre&quot; (1986). More recently, the genre has been revived with such films as &quot;Mayhem Motel&quot; (2001), &quot;Murder Inn&quot; (2005), &quot;Vacancy&quot; (2007), and its direct-to-video prequel, &quot;Vacancy 2: The First Cut&quot; (2009).

Several of these horror films also incorporate the sub-theme of voyeurism, whereby the motel owner spies on (or even films) the sexual exploits of the guests. This plays on the long-established connotations of motels and illicit sexual activity, which has itself formed the basis for numerous other films, variously representing the thriller, comedy, teen film, and sexploitation genres. Stephen C. Apostolof&#x27;s &quot;Motel Confidential&quot; (1967) and the porn film &quot;Motel for Lovers&quot; (1970) were two notable early examples. More recent manifestations include &quot;Paradise Motel&quot; (1985), &quot;Talking Walls&quot; (1987), &quot;Desire and Hell at Sunset Motel&quot; (1991), and the Korean films &quot;Motel Cactus&quot; (1997) and &quot;The Motel&quot; (2005).

In countless other films and TV series, the motel—invariably depicted as an isolated, run-down, and seedy establishment—has served as the setting for sordid events often involving equally sordid characters. Examples include &quot;Pink Motel&quot; (1982), &quot;Motel Blue 19&quot; (1993), &quot;Backroad Motel&quot; (2001), &quot;Stateline Motel&quot; (2003), &quot;Niagara Motel&quot; (2006), and &quot;Motel 5150&quot; (2008).

In the film &quot;Sparkle Lite Motel&quot; (2006) and the TV miniseries &quot;The Lost Room&quot; (2006), the motel made forays into the realms of science fiction. In the Pixar animation &quot;Cars&quot; (2006), a clientele of solely anthropomorphic vehicles requires all hotels be motels where clients drive directly to their rooms; allusions to real Route 66 motels on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places abound in the film. The Cozy Cone Motel design is the Wigwam Motel on U.S. Route 66 in Arizona with the neon &quot;100% Refrigerated Air&quot; slogan of Tucumcari, New Mexico&#x27;s Blue Swallow Motel; the Wheel Well Motel&#x27;s name alludes to the restored stone-cabin Wagon Wheel Motel in Cuba, Missouri. A long-defunct &quot;Glenn Rio Motel&quot; recalls Route 66 ghost town Glenrio, New Mexico and Texas, now a national historic district on the state line. Glenrio once boasted the &quot;First Motel in Texas&quot; (as seen when arriving from New Mexico) or &quot;Last Motel in Texas&quot; (the same motel, its signage viewed from the opposite side).

In computer gaming, &quot;Murder Motel&quot; was an online text game by Sean D. Wagle, hosted on various dial-up bulletin board systems (1980s, originally Color64, ported to various other platforms). The object was for each player to attempt to brutally kill all fellow guests in each room of a motel using a variety of weapons.

In theatre, the seedy motel room has been the setting for two-hander plays such as &quot;Same Time, Next Year&quot; (1975) and &quot;Bug&quot; (2006). Both were later adapted as films. Broadway musicals have also paid homage to the lowbrow reputation of motel culture, demonstrated by songs such as &quot;The No-Tel Motel&quot; from &quot;Prettybelle&quot; and &quot;At the Bed-D-by Motel&quot; from &quot;Lolita, My Love&quot;.

The British soap opera &quot;Crossroads&quot; was set in a motel in the English Midlands which was originally based on American-style motels with chalets but later was transformed into a luxury country hotel.

A run-down motel was used as the relocated residence of the unfortunate Rose family in the Emmy Award-winning series Schitt&#x27;s Creek. As the show progressed, Johnny Rose and Stevie Budd venture into turning old motels into authentic boutique motels. In one episode, a presidential suite is seen complete with era-correct furniture.

<doc id="21059" wikidata="Q1137814" url="?curid=21059" title="Constructivism (philosophy of mathematics)">
<text>In the philosophy of mathematics, constructivism asserts that it is necessary to find (or &quot;construct&quot;) a specific example of a mathematical object in order to prove that an example exists. Contrastingly, in classical mathematics, one can prove the existence of a mathematical object without &quot;finding&quot; that object explicitly, by assuming its non-existence and then deriving a contradiction from that assumption. Such a proof by contradiction might be called non-constructive, and a constructivist might reject it. The constructive viewpoint involves a verificational interpretation of the existential quantifier, which is at odds with its classical interpretation.

There are many forms of constructivism. These include the program of intuitionism founded by Brouwer, the finitism of Hilbert and Bernays, the constructive recursive mathematics of Shanin and Markov, and Bishop&#x27;s program of constructive analysis. Constructivism also includes the study of constructive set theories such as CZF and the study of topos theory.

Constructivism is often identified with intuitionism, although intuitionism is only one constructivist program. Intuitionism maintains that the foundations of mathematics lie in the individual mathematician&#x27;s intuition, thereby making mathematics into an intrinsically subjective activity. Other forms of constructivism are not based on this viewpoint of intuition, and are compatible with an objective viewpoint on mathematics.

== Constructive mathematics ==
Much constructive mathematics uses intuitionistic logic, which is essentially classical logic without the law of the excluded middle. This law states that, for any proposition, either that proposition is true or its negation is. This is not to say that the law of the excluded middle is denied entirely; special cases of the law will be provable. It is just that the general law is not assumed as an axiom. The law of non-contradiction (which states that contradictory statements cannot both be true at the same time) is still valid.

For instance, in Heyting arithmetic, one can prove that for any proposition &quot;p&quot; that &quot;does not contain quantifiers&quot;, formula_1 is a theorem (where &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot; ... are the free variables in the proposition &quot;p&quot;). In this sense, propositions restricted to the finite are still regarded as being either true or false, as they are in classical mathematics, but this bivalence does not extend to propositions that refer to infinite collections.

In fact, L. E. J. Brouwer, founder of the intuitionist school, viewed the law of the excluded middle as abstracted from finite experience, and then applied to the infinite without justification. For instance, Goldbach&#x27;s conjecture is the assertion that every even number greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers. It is possible to test for any particular even number whether it is the sum of two primes (for instance by exhaustive search), so any one of them is either the sum of two primes or it is not. And so far, every one thus tested has in fact been the sum of two primes.

But there is no known proof that all of them are so, nor any known proof that not all of them are so; nor is it even known whether &quot;either&quot; a proof &quot;or&quot; a disproof of Goldbach&#x27;s conjecture must exist (the conjecture may be &quot;undecidable&quot; in traditional ZF set theory). Thus to Brouwer, we are not justified in asserting &quot;either Goldbach&#x27;s conjecture is true, or it is not.&quot; And while the conjecture may one day be solved, the argument applies to similar unsolved problems. To Brouwer, the law of the excluded middle is tantamount to assuming that &quot;every&quot; mathematical problem has a solution.

With the omission of the law of the excluded middle as an axiom, the remaining logical system has an existence property that classical logic does not have: whenever formula_2 is proven constructively, then in fact formula_3 is proven constructively for (at least) one particular formula_4, often called a witness. Thus the proof of the existence of a mathematical object is tied to the possibility of its construction.

=== Example from real analysis ===
In classical real analysis, one way to define a real number is as an equivalence class of Cauchy sequences of rational numbers.

In constructive mathematics, one way to construct a real number is as a function &quot;ƒ&quot; that takes a positive integer formula_5 and outputs a rational &quot;ƒ&quot;(&quot;n&quot;), together with a function &quot;g&quot; that takes a positive integer &quot;n&quot; and outputs a positive integer &quot;g&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) such that

:formula_6

so that as &quot;n&quot; increases, the values of &quot;ƒ&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) get closer and closer together. We can use &quot;ƒ&quot; and &quot;g&quot; together to compute as close a rational approximation as we like to the real number they represent.

Under this definition, a simple representation of the real number &quot;e&quot; is:

:formula_7

This definition corresponds to the classical definition using Cauchy sequences, except with a constructive twist: for a classical Cauchy sequence, it is required that, for any given distance, there exists (in a classical sense) a member in the sequence after which all members are closer together than that distance. In the constructive version, it is required that, for any given distance, it is possible to actually specify a point in the sequence where this happens (this required specification is often called the modulus of convergence). In fact, the standard constructive interpretation of the mathematical statement

:formula_8

is precisely the existence of the function computing the modulus of convergence. Thus the difference between the two definitions of real numbers can be thought of as the difference in the interpretation of the statement &quot;for all... there exists...&quot;

This then opens the question as to what sort of function from a countable set to a countable set, such as &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; above, can actually be constructed. Different versions of constructivism diverge on this point. Constructions can be defined as broadly as free choice sequences, which is the intuitionistic view, or as narrowly as algorithms (or more technically, the computable functions), or even left unspecified. If, for instance, the algorithmic view is taken, then the reals as constructed here are essentially what classically would be called the computable numbers.

=== Cardinality ===
To take the algorithmic interpretation above would seem at odds with classical notions of cardinality. By enumerating algorithms, we can show that the computable numbers are classically countable. And yet Cantor&#x27;s diagonal argument here shows that real numbers have uncountable cardinality. To identify the real numbers with the computable numbers would then be a contradiction. Furthermore, the diagonal argument seems perfectly constructive. 

Indeed Cantor&#x27;s diagonal argument can be presented constructively, in the sense that given a bijection between the natural numbers and real numbers, one constructs a real number not in the functions range, and thereby establishes a contradiction. One can enumerate algorithms to construct a function &quot;T&quot;, about which we initially assume that it is a function from the natural numbers onto the reals. But, to each algorithm, there may or may not correspond a real number, as the algorithm may fail to satisfy the constraints, or even be non-terminating (&quot;T&quot; is a partial function), so this fails to produce the required bijection. In short, one who takes the view that real numbers are (individually) effectively computable interprets Cantor&#x27;s result as showing that the real numbers (collectively) are not recursively enumerable.

Still, one might expect that since &quot;T&quot; is a partial function from the natural numbers onto the real numbers, that therefore the real numbers are &quot;no more than&quot; countable. And, since every natural number can be trivially represented as a real number, therefore the real numbers are &quot;no less than&quot; countable. They are, therefore &quot;exactly&quot; countable. However this reasoning is not constructive, as it still does not construct the required bijection. The classical theorem proving the existence of a bijection in such circumstances, namely the Cantor–Bernstein–Schroeder theorem, is non-constructive. It has recently been shown that the Cantor–Bernstein–Schroeder theorem implies the law of the excluded middle, hence there can be no constructive proof of the theorem.

=== Axiom of choice ===
The status of the axiom of choice in constructive mathematics is complicated by the different approaches of different constructivist programs. One trivial meaning of &quot;constructive&quot;, used informally by mathematicians, is &quot;provable in ZF set theory without the axiom of choice.&quot; However, proponents of more limited forms of constructive mathematics would assert that ZF itself is not a constructive system.

In intuitionistic theories of type theory (especially higher-type arithmetic), many forms of the axiom of choice are permitted. For example, the axiom AC11 can be paraphrased to say that for any relation &quot;R&quot; on the set of real numbers, if you have proved that for each real number &quot;x&quot; there is a real number &quot;y&quot; such that &quot;R&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) holds, then there is actually a function &quot;F&quot; such that &quot;R&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)) holds for all real numbers. Similar choice principles are accepted for all finite types. The motivation for accepting these seemingly nonconstructive principles is the intuitionistic understanding of the proof that &quot;for each real number &quot;x&quot; there is a real number &quot;y&quot; such that &quot;R&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) holds&quot;. According to the BHK interpretation, this proof itself is essentially the function &quot;F&quot; that is desired. The choice principles that intuitionists accept do not imply the law of the excluded middle.

However, in certain axiom systems for constructive set theory, the axiom of choice does imply the law of the excluded middle (in the presence of other axioms), as shown by the Diaconescu-Goodman-Myhill theorem. Some constructive set theories include weaker forms of the axiom of choice, such as the axiom of dependent choice in Myhill&#x27;s set theory.

=== Measure theory ===

Classical measure theory is fundamentally non-constructive, since the classical definition of Lebesgue measure does not describe any way how to compute the measure of a set or the integral of a function. In fact, if one thinks of a function just as a rule that &quot;inputs a real number and outputs a real number&quot; then there cannot be any algorithm to compute the integral of a function, since any algorithm would only be able to call finitely many values of the function at a time, and finitely many values are not enough to compute the integral to any nontrivial accuracy. The solution to this conundrum, carried out first in , is to consider only functions that are written as the pointwise limit of continuous functions (with known modulus of continuity), with information about the rate of convergence. An advantage of constructivizing measure theory is that if one can prove that a set is constructively of full measure, then there is an algorithm for finding a point in that set (again see ).

== The place of constructivism in mathematics ==
Traditionally, some mathematicians have been suspicious, if not antagonistic, towards mathematical constructivism, largely because of limitations they believed it to pose for constructive analysis.
These views were forcefully expressed by David Hilbert in 1928, when he wrote in &quot;Grundlagen der Mathematik&quot;, &quot;Taking the principle of excluded middle from the mathematician would be the same, say, as proscribing the telescope to the astronomer or to the boxer the use of his fists&quot;.

Errett Bishop, in his 1967 work &quot;Foundations of Constructive Analysis&quot;, worked to dispel these fears by developing a great deal of traditional analysis in a constructive framework.

Even though most mathematicians do not accept the constructivist&#x27;s thesis that only mathematics done based on constructive methods is sound, constructive methods are increasingly of interest on non-ideological grounds. For example, constructive proofs in analysis may ensure witness extraction, in such a way that working within the constraints of the constructive methods may make finding witnesses to theories easier than using classical methods. Applications for constructive mathematics have also been found in typed lambda calculi, topos theory and categorical logic, which are notable subjects in foundational mathematics and computer science. In algebra, for such entities as topoi and Hopf algebras, the structure supports an internal language that is a constructive theory; working within the constraints of that language is often more intuitive and flexible than working externally by such means as reasoning about the set of possible concrete algebras and their homomorphisms.

Physicist Lee Smolin writes in &quot;Three Roads to Quantum Gravity&quot; that topos theory is &quot;the right form of logic for cosmology&quot; (page 30) and &quot;In its first forms it was called &#x27;intuitionistic logic&#x27;&quot; (page 31). &quot;In this kind of logic, the statements an observer can make about the universe are divided into at least three groups: those that we can judge to be true, those that we can judge to be false and those whose truth we cannot decide upon at the present time&quot; (page 28).

<text>Magdalena of Saxony (7 March 1507 – 25 January 1534) was Margravine of Brandenburg, as well as Electoral Princess of Brandenburg.

She was the daughter of George &quot;the Bearded&quot;, Duke of Saxony and his wife Barbara. Magdalena&#x27;s maternal grandparents were Casimir IV of Poland and Elisabeth of Austria, daughter of Albert II of Germany.

She was a granddaughter of the Elisabeth aforementioned, mother of the Jagiellonians, queen of Poland, who had claimed the Duchy of Luxembourg in 1460s as being the younger daughter of the last Luxembourg heiress Elisabeth of Luxembourg, Queen of Bohemia. Though by no means an heiress of her grandmother, she was intended to wed the heir of her grandmother&#x27;s older sister. Joachim (1505–1571), the future elector of Brandenburg, was the eldest son and heir of their current claimant of Luxembourg, Joachim I, Elector of Brandenburg (1484–1535), the eldest son and heir of Margaret of Thuringia (1449–1501), Dowager Electress of Brandenburg, herself the eldest daughter and heiress of Anna, Duchess of Luxembourg and William of Saxony, Landgrave of Thuringia.

Magdalena was thus married, at Dresden, on 6 November 1524, to her second cousin&#x27;s son Joachim II Hector, the future Elector of Brandenburg. Their son was John George, another future Elector of Brandenburg. After Magdalena&#x27;s death which occurred well before Joachim ascended the electorate, Joachim II Hector married Hedwig Jagiellon, daughter of King Sigismund I of Poland.

Magdalena and Joachim II Hector had issue:
* John George, Elector of Brandenburg (1525–1598), had issue
* Barbara of Brandenburg, Duchess of Brieg (1527–1595), had issue
* Elisabeth (1528–1529)
* Frederick IV of Brandenburg (1530–1552), Archbishop of Magdeburg and Bishop of Halberstadt
* Albrecht (1532–1532)
* Georg (1532–1532)
* Paul (1534–1534)

<doc id="21061" wikidata="Q114675" url="?curid=21061" title="Mica">
<text>Micas ( ) are a group of silicate minerals whose outstanding physical characteristic is that individual mica crystals can easily be split into fragile elastic plates. This characteristic is described as &quot;perfect basal cleavage&quot;. Mica is common in igneous and metamorphic rock and is occasionally found as small flakes in sedimentary rock. It is particularly prominent in many granites, pegmatites, and schists, and &quot;books&quot; (large individual crystals) of mica several feet across have been found in some pegmatites.

Micas are used in products such as drywalls, paints, and fillers, especially in parts for automobiles, roofing, and in electronics. The mineral is used in cosmetics and food to add &quot;shimmer&quot; or &quot;frost&quot;.

== Properties and structure ==

The mica group comprises 37 phyllosilicate minerals. All crystallize in the monoclinic system, with a tendency towards pseudohexagonal crystals, and are similar in structure but vary in chemical composition. Micas are translucent to opaque with a distinct vitreous or pearly luster, and different mica minerals display colors ranging from white to green or red to black. Deposits of mica tend to have a flaky or platy appearance.

The crystal structure of mica is described as &quot;TOT-c&quot;, meaning that it is composed of parallel &quot;TOT&quot; layers weakly bonded to each other by cations (&quot;c&quot;). The &quot;TOT&quot; layers in turn consist of two tetrahedral sheets (&quot;T&quot;) strongly bonded to the two faces of a single octahedral sheet (&quot;O&quot;). The relatively weak ionic bonding between &quot;TOT&quot; layers gives mica its perfect basal cleavage.

The tetrahedral sheets consist of silica tetrahedra, each silicon ion surrounded by four oxygen ions. In most micas, one in four silicon ions is replaced by an aluminium ion, while aluminium ions replace half the silicon ions in brittle micas. The tetrahedra share three of their four oxygen ions with neighbouring tetrahedra to produce a hexagonal sheet. The remaining oxygen ion (the &quot;apical&quot; oxygen ion) is available to bond with the octahedral sheet.

The octahedral sheet can be dioctahedral or trioctahedral. A trioctahedral sheet has the structure of a sheet of the mineral brucite, with magnesium or ferrous iron being the most common cation. A dioctahedral sheet has the structure and (typically) the composition of a gibbsite sheet, with aluminium being the cation. Apical oxygens take the place of some of the hydroxyl ions that would be present in a brucite or gibbsite sheet, bonding the tetrahedral sheets tightly to the octahedral sheet.

Tetrahedral sheets have a strong negative charge since their bulk composition is AlSi3O105-. The octahedral sheet has a positive charge, since its bulk composition is Al(OH)2+ (for a dioctahedral sheet with the apical sites vacant) or M3(OH)24+ (for a trioctahedral site with the apical sites vacant; M represents a divalent ion such as ferrous iron or magnesium) The combined TOT layer has a residual negative charge, since its bulk composition is Al2(AlSi3O10)(OH)2− or M3(AlSi3O10)(OH)2−. The remaining negative charge of the TOT layer is neutralized by the interlayer cations (typically sodium, potassium, or calcium ions).

Because the hexagons in the T and O sheets are slightly different in size, the sheets are slightly distorted when they bond into a TOT layer. This breaks the hexagonal symmetry and reduces it to monoclinic symmetry. However, the original hexahedral symmetry is discernible in the pseudohexagonal character of mica crystals. The short-range order of K+ ions on cleaved muscovite mica has been resolved.

== Classification ==

Chemically, micas can be given the general formula
:&quot;X&quot;2&quot;Y&quot;4–6&quot;Z&quot;8O20(OH, F)4,
in which
:&quot;X&quot; is K, Na, or Ca or less commonly Ba, Rb, or Cs;
:&quot;Y&quot; is Al, Mg, or Fe or less commonly Mn, Cr, Ti, Li, etc.;
:&quot;Z&quot; is chiefly Si or Al, but also may include Fe3+ or Ti.
Structurally, micas can be classed as dioctahedral (&quot;Y&quot; = 4) and trioctahedral (&quot;Y&quot; = 6). If the &quot;X&quot; ion is K or Na, the mica is a &quot;common&quot; mica, whereas if the &quot;X&quot; ion is Ca, the mica is classed as a &quot;brittle&quot; mica.

=== Dioctahedral micas ===

* Muscovite
* Paragonite

Brittle micas:
* Margarite

=== Trioctahedral micas ===

Common micas:
* Biotite
* Lepidolite
* Phlogopite
* Zinnwaldite

Brittle micas:
* Clintonite

=== Interlayer-deficient micas ===

Very fine-grained micas, which typically show more variation in ion and water content, are informally termed &quot;clay micas&quot;. They include:
* Hydro-muscovite with H3O+ along with K in the &quot;X&quot; site;
* Illite with a K deficiency in the &quot;X&quot; site and correspondingly more Si in the &quot;Z&quot; site;
* Phengite with Mg or Fe2+ substituting for Al in the &quot;Y&quot; site and a corresponding increase in Si in the &quot;Z&quot; site.

Sericite is the name given to very fine, ragged grains and aggregates of white (colorless) micas.

== Occurrence and production ==
Mica is widely distributed and occurs in igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary regimes. Large crystals of mica used for various applications are typically mined from granitic pegmatites.

The largest documented single crystal of mica (phlogopite) was found in Lacey Mine, Ontario, Canada; it measured and weighed about . Similar-sized crystals were also found in Karelia, Russia.

Scrap and flake mica is produced all over the world. In 2010, the major producers were Russia (100,000 tonnes), Finland (68,000 t), the United States (53,000 t), South Korea (50,000 t), France (20,000 t) and Canada (15,000 t). The total global production was 350,000 t, although no reliable data were available for China. Most sheet mica was produced in India (3,500 t) and Russia (1,500 t). Flake mica comes from several sources: the metamorphic rock called schist as a byproduct of processing feldspar and kaolin resources, from placer deposits, and pegmatites. Sheet mica is considerably less abundant than flake and scrap mica, and is occasionally recovered from mining scrap and flake mica. The most important sources of sheet mica are pegmatite deposits. Sheet mica prices vary with grade and can range from less than $1 per kilogram for low-quality mica to more than $2,000 per kilogram for the highest quality.

In Madagascar and India, it is also mined artisanally, in poor working conditions and with the help of child labour.

== Uses ==

The commercially important micas are muscovite and phlogopite, which are used in a variety of applications.

=== Useful properties ===
Mica&#x27;s value is based on its unique physical properties: the crystalline structure of mica forms layers that can be split or delaminated into thin sheets usually causing foliation in rocks. These sheets are chemically inert, dielectric, elastic, flexible, hydrophilic, insulating, lightweight, platy, reflective, refractive, resilient, and range in opacity from transparent to opaque. Mica is stable when exposed to electricity, light, moisture, and extreme temperatures. It has superior electrical properties as an insulator and as a dielectric, and can support an electrostatic field while dissipating minimal energy in the form of heat; it can be split very thin (0.025 to 0.125 millimeters or thinner) while maintaining its electrical properties, has a high dielectric breakdown, is thermally stable to , and is resistant to corona discharge. Muscovite, the principal mica used by the electrical industry, is used in capacitors that are ideal for high frequency and radio frequency. Phlogopite mica remains stable at higher temperatures (to ) and is used in applications in which a combination of high-heat stability and electrical properties is required. Muscovite and phlogopite are used in sheet and ground forms.

=== Ground mica ===

The leading use of dry-ground mica in the US is in the joint compound for filling and finishing seams and blemishes in gypsum wallboard (drywall). The mica acts as a filler and extender, provides a smooth consistency, improves the workability of the compound, and provides resistance to cracking. In 2008, joint compounds accounted for 54% of dry-ground mica consumption. In the paint industry, ground mica is used as a pigment extender that also facilitates suspension, reduces chalking, prevents shrinking and shearing of the paint film, increases the resistance of the paint film to water penetration and weathering and brightens the tone of colored pigments. Mica also promotes paint adhesion in aqueous and oleoresinous formulations. Consumption of dry-ground mica in paint, the second-ranked use, accounted for 22% of the dry-ground mica used in 2008.

Ground mica is used in the well-drilling industry as an additive to drilling fluids. The coarsely ground mica flakes help prevent the loss of circulation by sealing porous sections of the drill hole. Well-drilling muds accounted for 15% of dry-ground mica use in 2008. The plastics industry used dry-ground mica as an extender and filler, especially in parts for automobiles as lightweight insulation to suppress sound and vibration. Mica is used in plastic automobiles fascia and fenders as a reinforcing material, providing improved mechanical properties and increased dimensional stability, stiffness, and strength. Mica-reinforced plastics also have high-heat dimensional stability, reduced warpage, and the best surface properties of any filled plastic composite. In 2008, consumption of dry-ground mica in plastic applications accounted for 2% of the market. The rubber industry used ground mica as an inert filler and mold release compound in the manufacture of molded rubber products such as tires and roofing. The platy texture acts as an anti-blocking, anti-sticking agent. Rubber mold lubricant accounted for 1.5% of the dry-ground mica used in 2008. As a rubber additive, mica reduces gas permeation and improves resiliency.

Dry-ground mica is used in the production of rolled roofing and asphalt shingles, where it serves as a surface coating to prevent sticking of adjacent surfaces. The coating is not absorbed by freshly manufactured roofing because mica&#x27;s platy structure is unaffected by the acid in asphalt or by weather conditions. Mica is used in decorative coatings on wallpaper, concrete, stucco, and tile surfaces. It also is used as an ingredient in flux coatings on welding rods, in some special greases, and as coatings for core and mold release compounds, facing agents, and mold washes in foundry applications. Dry-ground phlogopite mica is used in automotive brake linings and clutch plates to reduce noise and vibration (asbestos substitute); as sound-absorbing insulation for coatings and polymer systems; in reinforcing additives for polymers to increase strength and stiffness and to improve stability to heat, chemicals, and ultraviolet (UV) radiation; in heat shields and temperature insulation; in industrial coating additive to decrease the permeability of moisture and hydrocarbons; and in polar polymer formulations to increase the strength of epoxies, nylons, and polyesters.
=== Paints and cosmetics ===

Wet-ground mica, which retains the brilliance of its cleavage faces, is used primarily in pearlescent paints by the automotive industry. Many metallic-looking pigments are composed of a substrate of mica coated with another mineral, usually titanium dioxide (TiO2). The resultant pigment produces a reflective color depending on the thickness of the coating. These products are used to produce automobile paint, shimmery plastic containers, and high-quality inks used in advertising and security applications. In the cosmetics industry, its reflective and refractive properties make mica an important ingredient in blushes, eye liner, eye shadow, foundation, hair and body glitter, lipstick, lip gloss, mascara, moisturizing lotions, and nail polish. Some brands of toothpaste include powdered white mica. This acts as a mild abrasive to aid the polishing of the tooth surface and also adds a cosmetically pleasing, glittery shimmer to the paste. Mica is added to latex balloons to provide a colored shiny surface.
=== Built-up mica ===
Muscovite and phlogopite splittings can be fabricated into various built-up mica products, also known as &quot;micanite&quot;. Produced by mechanized or hand setting of overlapping splittings and alternate layers of binders and splittings, built-up mica is used primarily as an electrical insulation material. Mica insulation is used in high-temperature and fire-resistant power cables in aluminium plants, blast furnaces, critical wiring circuits (for example, defence systems, fire and security alarm systems, and surveillance systems), heaters and boilers, lumber kilns, metal smelters, and tanks and furnace wiring. Specific high-temperature mica-insulated wire and cable are rated to work for up to 15 minutes in molten aluminium, glass, and steel. Major products are bonding materials; flexible, heater, molding, and segment plates; mica paper; and tape.
Flexible plate is used in electric motor and generator armatures, field coil insulation, and magnet and commutator core insulation. Mica consumption in flexible plates was about 21 tonnes in 2008 in the US. A heater plate is used where high-temperature insulation is required. The molding plate is sheet mica from which V-rings are cut and stamped for use in insulating the copper segments from the steel shaft ends of a commutator. The molding plate is also fabricated into tubes and rings for insulation in armatures, motor starters, and transformers. Segment plate acts as insulation between the copper commutator segments of direct-current universal motors and generators. Phlogopite built-up mica is preferred because it wears at the same rate as the copper segments. Although muscovite has a greater resistance to wear, it causes uneven ridges that may interfere with the operation of a motor or generator. Consumption of segment plates was about 149 t in 2008 in the US. Some types of built-up mica have bonded splittings reinforced with cloth, glass, linen, muslin, plastic, silk, or special paper. These products are very flexible and are produced in wide, continuous sheets that are either shipped, rolled, or cut into ribbons or tapes, or trimmed to specified dimensions. Built-up mica products may also be corrugated or reinforced by multiple layering. In 2008, about 351 t of built-up mica was consumed in the US, mostly for molding plates (19%) and segment plates (42%).

=== Sheet mica ===

Sheet mica is a versatile and durable material widely used in electrical and thermal insulation applications. It exhibits excellent electrical properties, heat resistance, and chemical stability. 

Technical grade sheet mica is used in electrical components, electronics, atomic force microscopy and as window sheets. Other uses include diaphragms for oxygen-breathing equipment, marker dials for navigation compasses, optical filters, pyrometers, thermal regulators, stove and kerosene heater windows, radiation aperture covers for microwave ovens, and micathermic heater elements. Mica is birefringent and is therefore commonly used to make quarter and half wave plates. Specialized applications for sheet mica are found in aerospace components in air-, ground-, and sea-launched missile systems, laser devices, medical electronics and radar systems. Mica is mechanically stable in micrometer-thin sheets which are relatively transparent to radiation (such as alpha particles) while being impervious to most gases. It is therefore used as a window on radiation detectors such as Geiger–Müller tubes.

In 2008, mica splittings represented the largest part of the sheet mica industry in the United States. Consumption of muscovite and phlogopite splittings was about 308 t in 2008. Muscovite splittings from India accounted for essentially all US consumption. The remainder was primarily imported from Madagascar.

Small squared pieces of sheet mica are also used in the traditional Japanese &quot;Kōdō&quot; ceremony to burn incense: A burning piece of coal is placed inside a cone made of white ash. The sheet of mica is placed on top, acting as a separator between the heat source and the incense, to spread the fragrance without burning it.

==== Electrical and electronic ====

Sheet mica is used principally in the electronic and electrical industries. Its usefulness in these applications is derived from its unique electrical and thermal properties and its mechanical properties, which allow it to be cut, punched, stamped, and machined to close tolerances. Specifically, mica is unusual in that it is a good electrical insulator at the same time as being a good thermal conductor. The leading use of block mica is as an electrical insulator in electronic equipment. High-quality block mica is processed to line the gauge glasses of high-pressure steam boilers because of its flexibility, transparency, and resistance to heat and chemical attack. Only high-quality muscovite film mica, which is variously called India ruby mica or ruby muscovite mica, is used as a dielectric in capacitors. The highest quality mica film is used to manufacture capacitors for calibration standards. The next lower grade is used in transmitting capacitors. Receiving capacitors use a slightly lower grade of high-quality muscovite.

Mica sheets are used to provide structure for heating wire (such as in Kanthal or Nichrome) in heating elements and can withstand up to .

Single-ended self-starting lamps are insulated with a mica disc and contained in a borosilicate glass gas discharge tube (arc tube) and a metal cap. They include the sodium-vapor lamp that is the gas-discharge lamp in street lighting.

==== Atomic force microscopy ====
Another use of mica is as a substrate in the production of ultra-flat, thin-film surfaces, e.g. gold surfaces. Although the deposited film surface is still rough due to deposition kinetics, the back side of the film at the mica-film interface is ultra-flat once the film is removed from the substrate. Freshly-cleaved mica surfaces have been used as clean imaging substrates in atomic force microscopy, enabling for example the imaging of bismuth films, plasma glycoproteins, membrane bilayers, and DNA molecules.

==== Peepholes ====
Thin transparent sheets of mica were used for peepholes in boilers, lanterns, stoves, and kerosene heaters because they were less likely to shatter than glass when exposed to extreme temperature gradients. Such peepholes were also fitted in horse-drawn carriages and early 20th-century cars, where they were called &quot;isinglass curtains&quot;.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;mica&quot; is derived from the Latin word &#x27;, meaning &quot;a crumb&quot;, and probably influenced by &#x27;, to glitter.

== Early history ==

Human use of mica dates back to prehistoric times. Mica was known to ancient Indian, Egyptian, Greek, Roman, and Chinese civilizations, as well as the Aztec civilization of the New World.

The earliest use of mica has been found in cave paintings created during the Upper Paleolithic period (40,000 BC to 10,000 BC). The first hues were red (iron oxide, hematite, or red ochre) and black (manganese dioxide, pyrolusite), though black from juniper or pine carbons has also been discovered. White from kaolin or mica was used occasionally.

A few kilometers northeast of Mexico City stands the ancient site of Teotihuacan. Mica was found in the noble palace complex &quot;Viking Group&quot; during an excavation led by Pedro Armillas between 1942 and 1944. Later, a second deposit was located in the Xalla Complex, another palatial structure east of Street of the Dead. There is a claim mica was found within the Pyramid of the Sun, which originates from Peter Tompkins in his book &quot;Mysteries of the Mexican Pyramids&quot;. But it is not yet proven.

Natural mica was and still is used by the Taos and Picuris Pueblos Indians in north-central New Mexico to make pottery. The pottery is made from weathered Precambrian mica schist and has flecks of mica throughout the vessels. Tewa Pueblo Pottery is made by coating the clay with mica to provide a dense, glittery micaceous finish over the entire object.

Mica flakes (called &quot;abrak&quot; in Urdu and written as ابرک) are also used in Pakistan to embellish women&#x27;s summer clothes, especially &quot;dupattas&quot; (long light-weight scarves, often colorful and matching the dress). Thin mica flakes are added to a hot starch water solution, and the &quot;dupatta&quot; is dipped in this water mixture for 3–5 minutes. Then it is hung to air dry.

=== Mica powder ===
Throughout the ages, fine powders of mica have been used for various purposes, including decorations. Powdered mica glitter is used to decorate traditional water clay pots in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh; it is also used on traditional Pueblo pottery, though not restricted to use on water pots in this case. The &quot;gulal&quot; and &quot;abir&quot; (colored powders) used by North Indian Hindus during the festive season of Holi contain fine crystals of mica to create a sparkling effect. The majestic Padmanabhapuram Palace, from Trivandrum in India, has colored mica windows.

Mica powder is also used as a decoration in traditional Japanese woodblock printmaking, as when applied to wet ink with gelatin as thickener using &quot;kirazuri&quot; technique and allowed to dry, it sparkles and reflects light. Earlier examples are found among paper decorations, with the height as the Nishi Honganji 36 Poets Collection, codices of illuminated manuscripts in and after ACE 1112. For metallic glitter, &quot;Ukiyo-e&quot; prints employed very thick solution either with or without color pigments stencilled on hairpins, sword blades or fish scales on .

The soil around Nishio in central Japan is rich in mica deposits, which were already mined in the Nara period. Yatsuomote ware is a type of local Japanese pottery from there. After an incident at Mount Yatsuomote a small bell was offered to soothe the &quot;kami&quot;. Katō Kumazō started a local tradition where small ceramic zodiac bells (きらら鈴) were made out of local mica kneaded into the clay, and after burning in the kiln the bell would make a pleasing sound when rung.

=== Medicine ===

Ayurveda, the Hindu system of ancient medicine prevalent in India, includes the purification and processing of mica in preparing Abhraka bhasma, which is claimed as a treatment for diseases of the respiratory and digestive tracts.

== Health impact ==

Mica dust in the workplace is regarded as a hazardous substance for respiratory exposure above certain concentrations.

===United States===
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit (permissible exposure limit) for mica exposure in the workplace as 20 million parts per cubic foot (706,720,000 parts per cubic meter) over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 3 mg/m3 respiratory exposure over an 8-hour workday. At levels of 1,500 mg/m3, mica is immediately dangerous to life and health.

== Substitutes ==
Some lightweight aggregates, such as diatomite, perlite, and vermiculite, may be substituted for ground mica when used as filler. Ground synthetic &quot;fluorophlogopite&quot;, a fluorine-rich mica, may replace natural ground mica for uses that require thermal and electrical properties of mica. Many materials can be substituted for mica in numerous electrical, electronic, and insulation uses. Substitutes include acrylate polymers, cellulose acetate, fiberglass, fishpaper, nylon, phenolics, polycarbonate, polyester, styrene, vinyl-PVC, and vulcanized fiber. Mica paper made from scrap mica can be substituted for sheet mica in electrical and insulation applications.

<text>Muscovite (also known as common mica, isinglass, or potash mica) is a hydrated phyllosilicate mineral of aluminium and potassium with formula KAl2(AlSi3O10)(F,OH)2, or (KF)2(Al2O3)3(SiO2)6(H2O). It has a highly perfect basal cleavage yielding remarkably thin laminae (sheets) which are often highly elastic. Sheets of muscovite 5 meters × 3 meters (16.5 feet × 10 feet) have been found in Nellore, India.

Muscovite has a Mohs hardness of 2–2.25 parallel to the [001] face, 4 perpendicular to the [001] and a specific gravity of 2.76–3. It can be colorless or tinted through grays, violet or red, and can be transparent or translucent. It is anisotropic and has high birefringence. Its crystal system is monoclinic. The green, chromium-rich variety is called fuchsite; mariposite is also a chromium-rich type of muscovite.

Muscovite is the most common mica, found in granites, pegmatites, gneisses, and schists, and as a contact metamorphic rock or as a secondary mineral resulting from the alteration of topaz, feldspar, kyanite, etc. It is characteristic of peraluminous rock, in which the content of aluminum is relatively high. In pegmatites, it is often found in immense sheets that are commercially valuable. Muscovite is in demand for the manufacture of fireproofing and insulating materials and to some extent as a lubricant.

== Naming ==
The name muscovite comes from &quot;Muscovy-glass&quot;, a name given to the mineral in Elizabethan England due to its use in medieval Russia (Muscovy) as a cheaper alternative to glass in windows. This usage became widely known in England during the sixteenth century with its first mention appearing in letters by George Turberville, the secretary of England&#x27;s ambassador to the Russian tsar Ivan the Terrible, in 1568.

== Distinguishing characteristics ==
Micas are distinguished from other minerals by their pseudohexagonal crystal shape and their perfect cleavage, which allows the crystals to be pulled apart into very thin elastic sheets. Pyrophyllite, and talc are softer than micas and have a greasy feel, while chlorite is green in color and its cleavage sheets are inelastic. The other common mica mineral, biotite, is almost always much darker in color than muscovite. Paragonite can be difficult to distinguish from muscovite but is much less common, though it is likely mistaken for muscovite often enough that it may be more common that is generally appreciated. Muscovite mica from Brazil is red due to manganese(3+).

== Composition and structure ==
Like all mica minerals, muscovite is a phyllosilicate (sheet silicate) mineral with a &quot;TOT-c&quot; structure. In other words, a crystal of muscovite consists of layers (&quot;TOT&quot;) bonded to each other by potassium cations (&quot;c&quot;).

Each layer is composed of three sheets. The outer sheets (&#x27;T&#x27; or tetrahedral sheets) consist of silicon-oxygen tetrahedra and aluminium-oxygen tetrahedra, with three of the oxygen anions of each tetrahedron shared with neighboring tetrahedra to form a hexagonal sheet. The fourth oxygen anion in each tetrahedral sheet is called an &quot;apical&quot; oxygen anion. There are three silicon cations for each aluminium cation but the arrangement of aluminium and silicon cations is largely disordered.

The middle octahedral (&quot;O&quot;) sheet consists of aluminium cations that are each surrounded by six oxygen or hydroxide anions forming an octahedron, with the octahedrons sharing anions to form a hexagonal sheet similar to the tetrahedral sheets. The apical oxygen anions of the outer &quot;T&quot; sheets face inwards and are shared by the octahedral sheet, binding the sheets firmly together. The relatively strong binding between oxygen anions and aluminium and silicon cations within a layer, compared with the weaker binding of potassium cations between layers, gives muscovite its perfect basal cleavage.

In muscovite, alternate layers are slightly offset from each other, so that the structure repeats every two layers. This is called the 1&quot;M&quot; polytype of the general mica structure.

The formula for muscovite is typically given as , but it is common for small amounts of other elements to substitute for the main constituents. Alkali metals such as sodium, rubidium, and caesium substitute for potassium; magnesium, iron, lithium, chromium, titanium, or vanadium can substitute for aluminium in the octahedral sheet; fluorine or chlorine can substitute for hydroxide; and the ratio of aluminium to silicon in the tetrahedral sheets can change to maintain charge balance where necessary (as when magnesium cations, with a charge of +2, substitute for aluminium ions, with a charge of +3).

Up to 10% of the potassium may be replaced by sodium, and up to 20% of the hydroxide by fluorine. Chlorine rarely replaces more than 1% of the hydroxide. Muscovite in which the mole fraction of silicon is greater than aluminium, and magnesium or iron replaces some of the aluminium to maintain charge balance, is called phengite.

Chromium-rich and vanadium-rich muscovite are known respectively as fuchsite and roscoelite.

==Uses==

Muscovite can be cleaved into very thin transparent sheets that can substitute for glass, particularly for high-temperature applications such as industrial furnace or oven windows. It is also used in the manufacture of a wide variety of electronics and as a filler in paints, plastic, and wallboard. It lends a silky luster to wallpaper. It is also used in tire manufacture as a mold release agent, in drilling mud, and in various cosmetics for its luster.

<doc id="21064" wikidata="Q2638469" url="?curid=21064" title="Book of Mosiah">
<text>The Book of Mosiah (), translated by Joseph Smith in the early 19th century, is one of the books which make up the Book of Mormon. The title refers to Mosiah II, a king of the Nephites at Zarahemla. The book covers the time period between &quot;ca&quot; 130 BC and 91 BC, except for when the book has a flashback into the Record of Zeniff, which starts at &quot;ca&quot; 200 BC, according to footnotes. Aside from stating that it was abridged by Mormon, the text says nothing about its authorship. Mosiah is twenty-nine chapters long.

==Background==
Royal Skousen, a professor of linguistics at Brigham Young University, said contextual evidence indicated that the beginning of the original Book of Mosiah was probably lost in the 116 pages of the Book of Mormon manuscript lost by Martin Harris, meaning what is now known as the first chapter of Mosiah was originally the third chapter.

According to original research by John Sawyer and John W. Welch, the term &quot;mosiah&quot; was an ancient Hebrew term. The key meaning of the word &quot;mosiah&quot; was &quot;savior.&quot;

==Narrative==
===King Benjamin instructs his sons===

King Benjamin had three sons, who were named Mosiah, Helorum, and Helaman. The king made sure they received a good education which focused on the Egyptian language. They studied the plates of Nephi and the prophesies recorded on them. He also had them learn the writings on the plates of brass which were taken from Laban, which were the only way the Nephites knew the commandments of God given to Moses. Benjamin tells his sons that the plates are the only thing keeping the Nephites from dwindling in unbelief like the Lamanites.

Then came the time when King Benjamin had to decide which of his three sons would receive his kingdom. He settled on Mosiah, and told his son to gather the people together at the temple so he could make the announcement. But that would be just a formality. Benjamin gave his son the actual reins of power immediately. Additionally, he passed on to Mosiah the plates of Nephi, and the brass plates, and the sword of Laban, and the Liahona.

===King Benjamin speaks and appoints an heir===

King Benjamin&#x27;s discourse in chapters two through five is considered by many readers to be a significant piece of the Book of Mormon. The king spoke of his life in service to the people, and how he even labored with his own hands that the people would not be unduly burdened with taxes. Yet he does not bring this up to boast, only to affirm that he has really been in the service of God. The King served God by serving his fellow human beings. He brings this to their mind as an example. If he, their king, labored to serve the people, then the people ought to labor to serve one another. And if he, their earthly king, merits any thanks from the people, how much more does God their heavenly king merit thanks from them. Yet if the people served God with all their power, they would remain in reality unprofitable servants, because God causes them to exist from instant to instant. The only thing God really requires from them in payment for creating the people and keeping them alive is for them to keep his commandments. He speaks of an angelic visitation and prophecies of Jesus Christ, his birth, identifying his mother as being named Mary, his ministry and miracles, his suffering, death and resurrection. He speaks of Jesus as being the judge, of his atonement as the means to overcome sin and the tendencies of the natural man in order to become a holy person. He emphasizes the importance to have faith in Jesus and to repent in order to become a child of Jesus Christ through His atonement.

He also decrees that his son, Mosiah is the new king. He is the second king Mosiah, as his grandfather (King Benjamin&#x27;s father) was also King Mosiah.

===An expedition to the land of Nephi and a story within a story===
The book changes time narration as it reflects on events that were past but are now being unfolded. The Nephites wanted to know what had happened to some of them who had taken a trip back to the land of Nephi in an attempt to reclaim it. Mosiah sends a small group on an expedition to find out (chapter 7). Some of this small group is met by guards and taken to prison and then brought before a king named Limhi. Limhi tells this group their story and shows the Record of Zeniff, who was the leader of the first group to try to reclaim the land of Nephi. This story within a story encompasses chapters 9 through 22.

Zeniff, whose original mission was to spy on the Lamanites, saw the good among them and desired that they not be destroyed. This led to a conflict in his party which ended in bloodshed. He and those who were not killed in the conflict, returned to Zarahemla. He became over-zealous to inherit the land of his fathers so he gathered others, and they went to take the land, but they were struck with famine because they were slow to remember God. Eventually, they come to a city, and Zeniff and four of his men went to the king. He made a deal with the king of the Lamanites to have a piece of the land of Nephi. He becomes king of this Nephite colony. They had some altercations with the Lamanites, but prevailed at that time.

Zeniff dies and passes rule to his son Noah. Noah is a wicked king. He is one of the more favorite villains among Book of Mormon readers. He collects exorbitant taxes from his people to build a palace and he and his ministers live a life of comfort, ease and self-indulgence. His wicked ways lead the whole colony into wickedness.

===Evil King Noah and the preaching of righteous Abinadi===
Then along comes a man named Abinadi. He is a holy man, a prophet, and he begins to preach that they must repent. He speaks against King Noah and prophecies that he will be killed if he doesn&#x27;t repent. Abinadi is arrested and brought before King Noah where he gives what is considered a very important discourse in the Book of Mormon (chapters 12–16). Abinadi asks the ministers what they preach, and they respond that they preach the Law of Moses. Abinadi then tells them that they ought to teach the Law of Moses, but rebukes them for not obeying it themselves, including the Ten Commandments, which he quotes to them. Abinadi then continues to explain that the Law of Moses is a teaching method to prepare people for the coming of Jesus Christ. He speaks of the atonement, faith, repentance and redemption through Jesus. He quotes Isaiah 53 and explains the seed of Christ, the resurrection, and that little children who die are saved in Christ.

King Noah and his priests are angered by this and sentence him to death by fire.

One of King Noah&#x27;s priests named Alma is stirred by Abinadi&#x27;s words and pleas on his behalf. He too is accused, and he flees. Alma hides and writes down the words of Abinadi. After a period of sore repentance, Alma begins to preach the words of Abinadi and the doctrine of Christ to the people in secret. He gains a sizable following and in chapter 18, Alma begins to baptize those who have accepted Christ. The Lord tells Alma that King Noah has discovered them and will be coming after them. He and his followers flee the land.

The Lamanites attack King Noah and his people and they begin to run. King Noah tells his priests and others to leave their wives and children so they can escape from the Lamanites. Those that follow this command are later angered at themselves and King Noah for leaving their families. The group sentences King Noah to death by fire. They then turn on the priests of Noah who flee before the people, later becoming the Amulonites. King Noah&#x27;s son Limhi rules, but becomes a tributary monarch to the king of the Lamanites.

===All Nephite peoples gather to Zarahemla and the church is organized===
Although this is not an exhaustive explanation, this is more or less the state found by the small expedition sent by King Mosiah. By the end of chapter 25, both the people of King Limhi, and the people of Alma have been guided by the Lord away from the Lamanites and to the land of Zarahemla. King Mosiah appoints Alma to organize the church. King Limhi and his people are baptized and join the church.
Also, King Mosiah by the aid of God translates a set of records which were found by Limhi&#x27;s people. They tell of a people commonly called the Jaredites. A portion of the record was inserted in the Book of Mormon as the Book of Ether. King Mosiah&#x27;s grandfather, also named Mosiah, had also translated some writings found on a large stone which touched upon the Jaredites.

===Conversion of Alma the Younger and the Sons of Mosiah===
There are problems in the church as a group of the younger &quot;rising generation&quot; do not believe in the teachings. They persuade others to follow after them and not believe in Jesus and the teachings of the church. Alma receives direction from the Lord on the matter and is told that excommunicating those who won&#x27;t repent is the most severe punishment the church can bestow. The secular government will deal with breaches in the law. King Mosiah makes it illegal to persecute the believers.

Among those who don&#x27;t believe are a son of Alma who also shares the name Alma (but he is usually differentiated as &quot;Alma the Younger&quot;), and King&#x27;s Mosiah&#x27;s own sons. One day while they are out and about doing their destructive work, an angel comes to them and tells them to no longer seek to destroy the church. This sight causes them great fear and Alma the Younger faints. He is in an unconscious state for two days and two nights and his father prays for him. When he comes to, he speaks of having waded through much tribulation and finding redemption through Christ. He speaks in much more detail about this experience in the Book of Alma, chapter 36. The experience causes himself and his associates (King Mosiah&#x27;s sons) to become converted to the Lord and to build up his church.

Mosiah&#x27;s sons approach Mosiah and tell him that they want to leave Zarahemla to go to the Lamanites and preach to them. This worries Mosiah, but he asks God who assures him that they will be protected and that they will also do much good there. Their journeys and preaching are described later in the Book of Alma beginning with chapter 17.

===A new government===
King Mosiah has a desire to set the affairs of the kingdom in order, as he is getting on in years. Since his sons have gone to the land of the Lamanites to preach, he has no heir to receive the throne. He proposes to his people therefore that they abolish the monarchy and instead organize a republic. He explains that kings who rule righteously are desirable, but once a wicked king comes to power, he spreads evil to his subjects, and it is difficult to remove a wicked king from power. He outlines a system of what are known as &quot;judges&quot; who are popularly elected at different levels of power. The people accept this system, and the elections are held, and Alma the younger becomes the first &quot;chief judge&quot; a title designating the head of the government. He also receives the office of &quot;high priest&quot; of the church, making him the leader of the church as well.

At the end of the Book of Mosiah, Alma (the elder) and Mosiah both pass away.

<doc id="21065" wikidata="Q862248" url="?curid=21065" title="Angel Moroni">
<text>The angel Moroni () is an angel whom Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, reported as having visited him on numerous occasions, beginning on September 21, 1823. According to Smith, the angel Moroni was the guardian of the golden plates buried near his home in western New York, which Latter Day Saints believe were the source of the Book of Mormon. An important figure in the theology of the Latter Day Saint movement, Moroni is featured prominently in its architecture and art. Besides Smith, the Three Witnesses and several other witnesses also reported that they saw Moroni in visions in 1829.

Moroni is thought by Latter Day Saints to be the same person as a Book of Mormon prophet-warrior named Moroni, who was the last to write in the golden plates. According to the Book of Mormon, the angel Moroni was a pre-Columbian warrior who buried the golden plates. After he died, he became an angel who was tasked with directing Smith to their location in the 1820s. According to Smith, he then returned the golden plates to Moroni after they were translated and, as of 1838, Moroni still had the plates in his possession.

==Angel&#x27;s name and identity==
Initially, when talking about his receipt of the golden plates, Smith referred only to &quot;an angel&quot; without identifying its name. Thus, in an 1831 letter from Lucy Mack Smith to her brother, she discusses Moroni as the person who buried the plates, but does not identify him as the unnamed &quot;holy angel&quot; that gave Smith the means to translate the golden plates. In Smith&#x27;s 1832 (second hand, but officially authorized) history, he said he was visited by &quot;an angel of the Lord&quot;, who mentioned the Book of Mormon prophet &quot;Moroni&quot; as the last engraver of the golden plates; however, that account did not mention whether or not the angel was referring to &quot;himself&quot; as Moroni.

Smith identified the angel &quot;as&quot; Moroni in 1835, while preparing the first edition of the Doctrine and Covenants, in which he indicated a number of angels who would come to the earth after the Second Coming and drink sacramental wine with himself and Oliver Cowdery. Among those angels, the revelation listed &quot;Moroni, whom I have sent unto you to reveal the book of Mormon, containing the fulness of my everlasting gospel; to whom I have committed the keys of the record of the stick of Ephraim&quot;. Around this time, Cowdery was writing a history of Smith in which he identified the angel as the prophet Moroni from the Book of Mormon. In July 1838, Smith wrote an article for the church periodical &quot;Elders&#x27; Journal&quot;, in the form of questions and answers, that stated the following:
Question 4th. How, and where did you obtain the book of Mormon?Answer. Moroni, the person who deposited the plates, from whence the book of Mormon was translated, in a hill in Manchester, Ontario County, New York, as a resurrected being, appeared unto me, and told me where they were; and gave me directions how to obtain them.

However, on May 2, 1838, a few months before Smith&#x27;s statement in &quot;Elders&#x27; Journal&quot;, Smith began dictating a church history that included a more detailed account of his visits from the angel. In this text, Smith&#x27;s scribe erroneously identified the angel as &quot;Nephi&quot;, which is the name of the Book of Mormon&#x27;s first narrator. Smith&#x27;s 1838 identification as &quot;Nephi&quot; was left unchanged when the 1838 history was published in 1842 in &quot;Times and Seasons&quot;, which Smith edited himself, and in &quot;Millennial Star&quot;. In the latter, an editorial referred to the 1823 vision and praised &quot;the glorious ministry and message of the angel Nephi&quot;. In 1851, after Smith&#x27;s death (1844), the identification as &quot;Nephi&quot; was repeated when the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) published its first edition of the Pearl of Great Price. It was also repeated in 1853 when Smith&#x27;s mother Lucy Mack Smith published a history of her son.

As a further complication, Mary Whitmer, mother to one of the Three Witnesses and four of the Eight Witnesses, said she had a vision of the golden plates, shown to her by an angel whom she always called &quot;Brother Nephi&quot;, but never clarified or indicated whether she believed this was the same angel that Smith and others later reported as Moroni.

Nevertheless, based on Smith&#x27;s other statements that the angel was &quot;Moroni,&quot; and based on both prior and later publications, most Latter Day Saints view Smith&#x27;s 1838 identification of the angel as Nephi as a mistake on the part of the transcriber. In the version of Smith&#x27;s 1838 history published by the LDS Church, as well as the portion canonized by that denomination as the Pearl of Great Price, the name &quot;Nephi&quot; has been changed by editors to read &quot;Moroni&quot;. The Community of Christ publishes the original story, including the identification of &quot;Nephi&quot;, but indicates &quot;Moroni&quot; in a footnote.

==Description==
In one of Smith&#x27;s histories, he described him as an &quot;angel of light&quot; who &quot;had on a loose robe of most exquisite whiteness. It was a whiteness beyond anything earthly I had ever seen .… His hands were naked and his arms also a little above the wrists .… Not only was his robe exceedingly white but his whole person was glorious beyond description&quot;. According to Smith&#x27;s sister Katharine, the angel &quot;was dressed in white raiment, of whiteness beyond anything Joseph had ever seen in his life, and had a girdle about his waist. He saw his hands and wrists, and they were pure and white&quot;.

==Appearances to Joseph Smith and others==

Smith said that on the night of September 21, 1823, Moroni appeared to him and told him about the golden plates that were buried in a stone box a few miles from Smith&#x27;s home. Smith said that the same angel visited him various times over the course of the next six years; Smith also said that the angel visited him to retrieve the golden plates after Smith had finished translating a portion of the writing on the plates into the Book of Mormon.

In addition to Smith, several other early Mormons said they had visions where they saw the angel Moroni. Three Witnesses said they saw the angel in 1829: Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, and Martin Harris. Other early Mormons who may have said they saw Moroni include:
*Hyrum Smith
*Luke S. Johnson
*Zera Pulsipher, later disputed.
*W. W. Phelps;
*John P. Greene and his wife Rhoda
*John Taylor
*Oliver Granger
*Heber C. Kimball
*Lucy Harris
*Harrison Burgess

Mary Whitmer may also have seen Moroni, although she referred to the angel she saw as &quot;Brother Nephi&quot;.

==Mortal life of Moroni the prophet==

According to the Book of Mormon, Moroni was the son of Mormon, the prophet for whom the Book of Mormon is named. Moroni may have been named after Captain Moroni, an earlier Book of Mormon figure. Before Mormon&#x27;s death in battle, he passed the golden plates to Moroni. Moroni then finished writing on the plates and concluded the record, presumably burying them in the hill Cumorah in western New York. He is the namesake of the Book of Moroni in the Book of Mormon.

==Theological significance==

Because of his instrumentality in the restoration of the gospel, Moroni is commonly identified by Latter Day Saints as the angel mentioned in , &quot;having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people.&quot;

The image of the angel Moroni blowing a trumpet is commonly used as an unofficial symbol of the LDS Church. Moroni appears on the cover of some editions of the Book of Mormon. Statues of the angel stand atop many LDS temples, with most statues facing east.

In 2007, the LDS Church stated that an image of the angel Moroni in an advertisement violated one of the church&#x27;s registered trademarks.

==Theorized origin of the name==

Commenting on the name of the angel Moroni, Grant H. Palmer speculates that Smith had read of the city Moroni on the island Comoros from either a map or tales of Captain William Kidd, popular at the time. According to Latter-day Saint scholar Hugh Nibley, the use of &quot;mor&quot; in the Book of Mormon is an Egyptian word, and means &quot;beloved, good, everything nice and desirable.&quot;
==Sculptors==
The Nauvoo Temple was the first Latter Day Saint temple to be crowned with a figure of an angel. This angel, not officially identified as Moroni, was a metal weathervane with gold leaf on the trumpet. It was designed by William Weeks (architect of the Nauvoo temple) and installed in January 1846. This figure was positioned in a flying horizontal position holding an open book in one hand and a trumpet in the other.

Cyrus Dallin sculpted the first angel which was identified as Moroni. This angel was placed on the Salt Lake Temple during the capstone ceremony on April 6, 1892, one year to the day before the temple was dedicated. Dallin&#x27;s design is a dignified, neoclassical angel in robe and cap, standing upright with a trumpet in hand. It stands 3.8 meters high, was molded in hammered copper from the plaster original, and was covered with 22-karat gold leaf. On March 18, 2020, the trumpet held by the statue of Angel Moroni on the Salt Lake Temple fell to the ground as a result of a 5.7 magnitude earthquake. 

Torleif S. Knaphus fashioned a replica of the Dallin angel in the 1930s, but the casting of his angel wasn&#x27;t placed on a temple until many years later. In 1983, castings of this angel were placed on the Idaho Falls Temple (8th operating temple) and the Atlanta Temple (21st operating temple).

Millard F. Malin&#x27;s angel, which was placed on the Los Angeles Temple in 1953, is known as the second Angel Moroni statue. His angel was cast in aluminum, stands 4.7 meters high, and weighs 953 kilograms. It has Native American features, wears a Mayan style cloak, and holds the gold plates in its left hand.

Avard Fairbanks sculpted the third Angel Moroni statue, which was placed on the Washington D.C. Temple, dedicated in 1974. This angel was created as a one-meter model which was sent to Italy where it was enlarged, cast in bronze, and gilded. The finished statue is 5.5 meters high and weighs over . The Seattle Washington, Jordan River Utah, and México City México temples each have a 4.6 meter casting of this statue.

Karl Quilter sculpted his first Angel Moroni in 1978. Two sizes were made, one three meters high, the other just over two meters. These statues were designed to reduce the cost and weight of the previous Angel Moroni statues, in order to become a standard part of the temple architecture. The Quilter angels are made of fiberglass and covered with gold leaf. In 1998, with the construction of many new smaller temples, Quilter was commissioned to create a new angel. This angel was similar in design to his previous angels, but he gave Moroni a slightly larger build, with his left hand opened and his body turned slightly to show more action. The Bern Switzerland Temple&#x27;s Angel Moroni is patterned after Quilter&#x27;s 1998 design. Quilter&#x27;s Angel Moroni is now on over one hundred temples around the world.

<text>The Vorkosigan Saga is a series of science fiction novels and short stories set in a common fictional universe by American author Lois McMaster Bujold. The first of these was published in 1986 and the most recent in May 2018. Works in the series have received numerous awards and nominations, including five Hugo Award wins including one for Best Series.

The point of view characters include women (Cordelia in &quot;Shards of Honor&quot;, &quot;Barrayar&quot;, and &quot;Gentleman Jole and the Red Queen&quot;; Ekaterin in &quot;Komarr&quot;, &quot;A Civil Campaign&quot;, and &quot;The Flowers of Vashnoi&quot;), a gay man (&quot;Ethan of Athos&quot;), a pair of brothers, one of whom is physically disabled and the other a clone (Miles and Mark Vorkosigan), and their cousin (Ivan Vorpatril), together with some minor characters (e.g., Miles&#x27;s bodyguard Roic, family friend Kareen Koudelka, and the runaway Jin).

The various forms of society and government Bujold presents often reflect contemporary politics. In many novels, there is a contrast between the technology-rich egalitarian Beta Colony (or more generally, galactic society) and the heroic, militaristic, hierarchical society of Barrayar, where personal relationships must ensure societal continuity. Miles Vorkosigan, the protagonist of most of the series, is the son of a Betan former ship captain mother and a Barrayaran aristocrat father.
==Background==
===&quot;Vorkosiverse&quot;===
Humanity has colonized a galaxy in which there are no competing intelligent species. Since then (at least 400 years before &quot;Falling Free&quot; or 600 years before &quot;Shards of Honor&quot;), dozens of planets have been colonized and have developed divergent cultures. Barrayar was colonized and then lost contact with the rest of the galaxy, suffering a &quot;Time of Isolation&quot;, after which it was reconnected. Due to apparent nuclear warfare that has left large areas too radioactive to inhabit, low genetic diversity on Barrayar during the time of isolation, as well as the effects of mutagenic compounds found in native Barrayaran plants, a cultural phobia about mutation developed that leads to a high level of xenophobia. Within the series, exploration and colonization of new planets is still ongoing, most notably on the planet Sergyar.

Interstellar travel is achieved by &quot;jumping&quot; from solar system to solar system via spatial anomalies known as wormholes that create tunnels in a five-dimensional space. Typically wormholes are bracketed by space stations, military or commercial, which provide ports for jump travel. Stations may be owned by planetary governments, or by specific commercial organizations, or they may be completely independent of any planetary organization. Barrayar&#x27;s original wormhole collapsed, a rare event leading to the Time of Isolation. Barrayar was later re-discovered via a wormhole jump from Komarr. Komarr allows the neighboring Cetagandan empire to use their wormhole to conquer Barrayar, and is later conquered in its turn when Barrayar eventually defeats the Cetagandans.

The stories feature several planetary systems, each with its own political organization, including government by corporate democracy, rule by criminal corporations, monarchies, empires and direct democracies. In most cases, there is a single government which dominates the entire planet (exceptions include Jackson&#x27;s Whole and Earth). Both Cetaganda and Barrayar have empires, acquired by conquering other planets via neighboring wormholes.

As a tool to simplify the writing process, Bujold devises a standard system of timekeeping universal to all planets regardless of the length of their day and year. Bujold herself has commented that her posited system is neither technologically nor economically feasible, but is rather a convenience for storytelling.

===Technology===
Most of the technology in the series is based on 20th-century engineering situations, projected into null-g or alternative solar system situations. Biomedical advances such as cloning, artificial wombs (named &quot;uterine replicators&quot;) and cryochambers to preserve and revive recently deceased people are featured heavily in the series.

Bujold presents issues of technological obsolescence and the high rate of failure of R&amp;D projects in personal terms, via bioengineering. Two jump pilots with obsolete navigational brain implants and a number of characters created by genetic manipulation are psychologically stranded by the termination of the programs for which they were designed.

The series features gravity manipulation, both artificially generated in spaceships, and artificially suppressed in ground transport and elevators. &quot;Falling Free&quot; and &quot;Diplomatic Immunity&quot; explore the relationship between a culture adapted to an environment without gravity and one which depends on gravity.

===Computing and communications===
In most societies featured in the series, paper has been mostly replaced by either plastic sheets or electronic devices, and two-dimensional video is replaced by three-dimensional holograms. Most characters use portable computers called &quot;wristconsoles&quot; and personal computers named &quot;comconsoles&quot;.

Interstellar messages, however, have to be recorded on a physical disc which is transported through wormholes at a high cost, and relayed between wormholes by the ships&#x27; communication systems, imposing both time and cost constraints on interstellar communications.

===Military technology===
As the series features a military background in several novels, special attention is paid to military technology. Ship-to-ship combat includes plasma rays and attacks based on gravity manipulation, and defensive countermeasures. Personal combat includes the use of combat suits, plasma rays, needlers, and nerve disruptors, which emit rays that destroy nerve tissue. Biological weapons are also mentioned in the form of wide-spectrum toxin bombs and genetically modified microbes that target specific races, and in some cases, specific people.

A truth serum, &quot;fast-penta&quot;, is a widespread tool used in interrogation. Several defenses are devised, such as induced allergies that kill the subject before they can reveal information, genetic engineering to create immunity, or compartmentalization of information on a need-to-know basis. Miles Vorkosigan has an atypical reaction to the drug, which enables him to thwart his enemies on at least one occasion.

===Biospheres===
In the Vorkosigan saga, humans live on planets with diverse degrees of habitability, and have developed diverse adaptation strategies to environments that are only approximately fit for human life. For example, Komarr is a cold planet with high CO2 that is going through long-term terraforming to make it habitable, while Beta Colony is a hot, sandy planet where humans must live underground. Barrayar&#x27;s vegetation is incompatible with Earth&#x27;s, and often poisonous or allergenic to humans; Barrayarans clear native forest and use compost from Earth-descended plants or horse manure to grow new Earth vegetation. In spaceships and space stations, people live in closed ecologies in which air and waste are continuously reprocessed.

===Medical technology===
Medical advances are a fundamental part of the saga&#x27;s worldbuilding. The most ubiquitous are &quot;uterine replicators&quot;, devices that allow complete in vitro reproduction, with gene therapy (&quot;gene cleaning&quot;) to correct for congenital defects. In &quot;Ethan of Athos&quot;, this also makes possible an all-male society in which eggs are produced by ovaries maintained in a lab. The Cetagandan haut go beyond gene cleaning, deliberately engineering the human genome in an attempt to produce a post-human species (&quot;Cetaganda&quot;, &quot;Diplomatic Immunity&quot;).

Other advances include genetic manipulation to produce microbes and animals tailored for specific purposes, including decoration, or humans adapted for combat or to live and work in zero gravity. Fertile hermaphrodites have been created in an attempt to surpass gender roles. Medical prolonging of human life has advanced to achieve natural lifespans of 120 years or more, though Barrayar lags galactic civilization on this. Cloning is featured in the series, prominently in the person of Mark, Miles&#x27; clone-brother, and in a morally dubious industry on Jackson&#x27;s Whole that grows clones of wealthy people to transplant their brains from elderly bodies to youthful, healthy ones.

Barrayar is an exception to most of these advances due to its long isolation from the rest of humanity. Women carrying their babies to term without uterine replicators are the rule at the beginning of the series, and there is an ingrained fear of mutation in its society. The social challenges posed by medical technology and Miles Vorkosigan&#x27;s visible deformities are integral to the plot of several of the stories.

===Society===
The time required for wormhole jumps between planetary systems means travel and communication require time and effort which isolate each planet and allow it to develop its own culture, most of them derived to some extent from a culture known historically on Earth.

For example, the planet Athos creates a monosexual culture in which men reproduce in vitro without female intervention, Cetaganda is an empire in which hierarchies are based in genetic fitness, Jackson&#x27;s Whole is a cutthroat criminal planet in which trade and money are law, and Escobar is a moderate planet focused on scientific advancement.

The novels do not focus much on several sources of social organization and prejudice on Earth, such as language, skin color, and religion. In general, Nexus inhabitants speak a common language, though they may know other languages or have a planetary accent. A good-looking woman, whether a four-armed quaddie, a Cetagandan haut-lady glimpsed in her floating bubble, or a Barrayaran damsel, has skin comparable to ivory or milk. On the other hand, the most prominent genotype on Barrayar is olive skin (and brown eyes and dark hair). The Arqua family are described as dark-skinned, and the Durona group and Ky Tung are Eurasian. Only isolated Athos has a planetary religion, though Cordelia Naismith and Leo Graf (the hero of &quot;Falling Free&quot;) believe in a God.

The environment and history of the planets dictate their social structures and prejudices. For example, because of the isolation of Barrayar, located with a single wormhole to connect it with the rest of the galaxy, and its people having to defend a broadly habitable planet, Barrayarans both need and can afford a militaristic society. Their genetic isolation has led them to create a patriarchal society to preserve genetic purity. The Betans, on a hostile planet where they must live in domes, rely on industrial export and limit not only childbearing but also every kind of behavior that might be considered &quot;antisocial&quot;. From their point of view, Barrayaran society is irrational and backward, while the Barrayarans view the Betans as sexually and politically undisciplined, referring to a &quot;Betan vote&quot; as an obstacle to decision-making. Planets accessible by many wormholes become centers of trade and finance, whether benign (Komarr, Escobar) or malicious (Jackson&#x27;s Whole). Finally, some dwellers in space habitats look down on those who call one planet home as &quot;dirt suckers&quot;.

===The Vorkosigans and Barrayar===
In all the books except &quot;Ethan of Athos&quot; and &quot;Falling Free&quot;, the protagonists are connected to the planet Barrayar, home of the Vorkosigan clan. For this planet Bujold devised a history which allowed for &quot;swords &#x27;n&#x27; spaceships&quot; due to the transition between the Time of Isolation and galactic culture. In the lifetime of Miles Vorkosigan, Barrayar uses spaceships, computers, and other high technology, but its culture remembers dueling, celebrates the Emperor&#x27;s birthday by handing him bags of gold, and provides liveried life-sworn servants to carry love letters sealed with the writer&#x27;s blood. In the conservative backwoods, some still practice infanticide if signs of mutation are detected. Stories of the evils of mutation are pervasive within Barrayaran culture.

Barrayar is a planet colonized by humans some four hundred years prior to &quot;Shards of Honor&quot;, the first Vorkosigan novel. Shortly after colonization, the 50,000 settlers are cut off by a failure of the sole wormhole connecting Barrayar to the rest of humanity. During the following centuries, the &quot;Time of Isolation&quot;, the colony regresses socially and technologically, eventually developing a feudal form of government, in which the Emperor of Barrayar is supported by sixty regional counts and other minor aristocrats, identified by the honorific prefix &quot;Vor-&quot; in their names. The Vor caste is a military one, and Barrayaran culture is highly militaristic and hierarchical. The Counts, however, originate as accountants, with the duty of ensuring that the Emperor&#x27;s taxes are collected. Because of Barrayar&#x27;s tradition of direct military action, the Counts also become extremely militaristic.

Barrayar is eventually rediscovered via a different wormhole route controlled by the rich merchant planet Komarr. The Komarrans allow the neighboring expansionist Cetagandan Empire to invade Barrayar in return for commercial rights and concessions. Despite a significant technological advantage, the Cetagandans are finally expelled at great cost after many years of occupation and guerrilla warfare, in large part due to the leadership of General Count Piotr Vorkosigan, Miles&#x27; paternal grandfather. The Barrayarans then conquer and annex Komarr under the command of Admiral Aral Vorkosigan, Count Piotr&#x27;s second son. Due to a massacre initiated by a subordinate, Aral Vorkosigan acquires the sobriquet &quot;Butcher of Komarr.&quot;

Aral Vorkosigan later meets Cordelia Naismith, an enemy officer from Beta Colony, at the commencement of another war. Forced to work together to survive on a hostile planet, they fall in love and eventually marry, resulting in the conception of Miles.

An attempt to poison Aral during his regency for the child Emperor, Gregor Vorbarra, leads to the exposure of a pregnant Cordelia to a teratogenic compound, the antidote to the poison. Desperate experimental medical procedures are required to save the unborn baby, and the side effects of the antidote threaten to kill Cordelia. Miles is transferred to a uterine replicator to allow medical procedures that would threaten his mother. Miles&#x27; physical development is severely affected; in particular, his long bones are short and fragile. As an adult, he is subtly but noticeably misshapen and no taller than a nine-year-old boy. As a result, he has to deal with the deeply ingrained prejudice against mutants on his native world (though he is not technically a mutant since the damage is teratogenic). With nearly pathological determination and high intelligence, aided by his supportive parents and their high social rank, he fashions an extraordinary military and civilian career for himself in the Barrayaran Empire.

===Sales and international popularity===
Three of the novels made the New York Times Bestseller List when first released in hardback: &quot;A Civil Campaign&quot; at #26, &quot;Diplomatic Immunity&quot; at #25, and &quot;Cryoburn&quot; at #32.
The novels have been translated into a number of languages and the covers of various international editions have been archived.

A comic book adaptation of &quot;The Warrior&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; was published in France in 2010, which was the first of a projected series called &quot;La Saga Vorkosigan&quot;.

==Works==
The Saga&#x27;s internal chronology does not match the order in which the books were written. Bujold has stated that she is generally in favor of reading the books in internal chronological order, with caveats. A more detailed chronology can be found in &quot;The Vorkosigan Companion&quot;.

With the publication of &quot;Cryoburn&quot;, almost all Vorkosigan tales were available as free e-texts on a CD that accompanied the hardcover release. This CD was initially shared online, but has since been withdrawn by request of the author. Earlier works published up to 2004, including novels (except &quot;Memory&quot;) and the short stories (except &quot;Dreamweaver&#x27;s Dilemma&quot;), have been repackaged in omnibus editions. The first of these was &quot;Vorkosigan&#x27;s Game&quot; (September 1990), an omnibus volume published by a book sales club, collecting &quot;The Vor Game&quot; and the three-novella &quot;Borders of Infinity&quot; anthology. While all the books and novellas are currently in print as ebooks, in America they are in print as omnibus editions.

The roots of the Vorkosigan Saga lie in an early collection by Bujold called &quot;Dreamweaver&#x27;s Dilemma&quot;. The title story features Beta Colony, and another story contains a character named Cordelia Naismith, perhaps a distant ancestor of the Vorkosigan character. When beginning her first novel, &quot;Shards of Honor&quot;, Bujold incorporated these elements, but greatly expanded. She followed that up with the second novel with the same setting, &quot;The Warrior&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;, then worked on &quot;Ethan of Athos&quot;. After being rejected by four publishers, &quot;The Warrior&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; was accepted by Baen Books, who agreed to a three-book deal to include the two other novels.

&quot;Shards of Honor&quot; and &quot;Barrayar&quot; concern Miles&#x27; parents, &quot;Ethan of Athos&quot; involves a few minor characters from other Vorkosigan novels, and &quot;Falling Free&quot; does not involve Miles or any of his family, though in some later novels Miles encounters the descendants of the characters from &quot;Falling Free&quot;.

===Individual titles===
====&quot;Dreamweaver&#x27;s Dilemma&quot; (short story)====
&quot;Dreamweaver&#x27;s Dilemma&quot; is a short story set at the beginning of Earth&#x27;s age of space colonization and genetic manipulation. It was published in the book of the same name, which is a collection of short stories and essays by Bujold that had been previously unpublished and that she gathered together prior to her appearance at a NESFA convention. &quot;Dreamweaver&#x27;s Dilemma&quot; contains the first mention of Beta Colony. It is also the only Vorkosigan Saga story not published or republished by Baen Books.

====&quot;Falling Free&quot;====

200 years before the birth of Miles Vorkosigan, engineer Leo Graf encounters the Quaddies, who are genetically engineered to have an extra pair of arms in place of legs in order to work better in the free-falling environment of space. Collected in the omnibus edition &quot;Miles, Mutants and Microbes&quot;.

====&quot;Shards of Honor&quot;====

Captain Cordelia Naismith of Beta Colony meets and eventually falls in love with Captain Lord Aral Vorkosigan of Barrayar when they are both stranded on an uninhabited planet. After being captured by the Barrayarans and then escaping twice, she returns home a war hero. However, her own people believe she has been brainwashed and try to &quot;cure&quot; her of her love for Aral. She eventually flees to Barrayar to be reunited with him. Collected in the omnibus edition &quot;Cordelia&#x27;s Honor&quot;.

====&quot;Aftermaths&quot; (short story)====
Two people retrieve bodies in space near Escobar after the failed Barrayaran invasion. The story was originally a postscript to &quot;Shards of Honor&quot; and later included in the omnibus edition &quot;Cordelia&#x27;s Honor&quot;.

====&quot;Barrayar&quot;====

While Cordelia Vorkosigan is pregnant with Miles, an attempted assassination threatens her unborn child&#x27;s life. Count Vordarian launches a coup. Collected in the omnibus edition &quot;Cordelia&#x27;s Honor&quot;.

====&quot;The Warrior&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;====

Seventeen-year-old Miles breaks both legs running an obstacle course, seemingly ruining his chance of a military career. On a visit to Beta Colony, he obtains a ship, a pilot, and a contract to run guns to a blockaded government. He eventually takes over much of the blockading mercenary fleet through brilliant improvisation, sheer audacity and much luck. The unexpected arrival of his cousin Ivan Vorpatril raises Miles&#x27; suspicions. He hastens home to foil a plot against his father. Collected in the omnibus edition &quot;Young Miles&quot;.

====&quot;The Mountains of Mourning&quot; (novella)====

Miles has just graduated from the Imperial Academy, and is at home at Vorkosigan Surleau with his parents. A woman from an isolated rural village demands justice for the murder of her baby, who was born with a cleft lip and palate, but was otherwise healthy. Miles&#x27; father sends him to investigate as his Voice (representative with full powers) to gain experience. Miles solves the mystery and exercises justice and mercy in appropriate measures. Collected in the omnibus editions &quot;Vorkosigan&#x27;s Game&quot;; &quot;Young Miles&quot;; and &quot;Borders of Infinity&quot;.

====&quot;The Vor Game&quot;====

Miles is shipped off-planet to the Hegen Hub after refusing to obey what he considers to be a criminal order at a training camp and being accused of treason (again). He finds himself having to rescue his friend and emperor, Gregor Vorbarra. Collected in the omnibus editions &quot;Vorkosigan&#x27;s Game&quot; and &quot;Young Miles&quot;.

====&quot;Cetaganda&quot;====

Miles and Ivan are sent to the homeworld of the Cetagandan Empire to represent Barrayar at an Imperial funeral, and quickly become entangled in a murderous Cetagandan plot involving power, poisons, and the peculiar application of eugenics in the Cetagandan &quot;haut&quot; ruling class. Miles helps defeat the plot, which would have greatly amplified the Cetagandan threat to Barrayar and other systems, and in the process collects a piece of information that causes him to dispatch Elli Quinn on her mission in Ethan of Athos. Collected in the omnibus edition &quot;Miles, Mystery, and Mayhem&quot;.

====&quot;Ethan of Athos&quot;====

This novel does not feature Miles except indirectly; his eventual girlfriend, Commander Elli Quinn of the Dendarii Free Mercenary Fleet, plays a leading role. Collected in the omnibus edition &quot;Miles, Mystery, and Mayhem&quot;.

====&quot;Labyrinth&quot; (novella)====
Miles travels to Jackson&#x27;s Whole, ostensibly to buy weapons, but in reality to help geneticist Dr. Hugh Canaba leave his current employer to go to work for Barrayar. Canaba throws a wrench into the works when he refuses to leave without certain experimental samples which he has injected into one of his earlier projects, a prototype &quot;super-soldier&quot;. Even worse, the &quot;super-soldier&quot; has been sold to the paranoid and sadistic Baron Ryoval, whom Miles has recently offended.

Miles breaks into Ryoval&#x27;s laboratory, but is caught and imprisoned in a utility sublevel where they are also keeping Canaba&#x27;s dangerous specimen, &quot;Nine&quot;. This turns out to be an eight-foot-tall warrior, complete with fangs, claws, superhuman strength and speed, and a ravenous appetite. Miles is shocked to find that the creature is female, and, despite her fearsome appearance, intelligent and emotionally vulnerable. She challenges him to prove that he believes she is human by making love to her. Miles gets to indulge his weakness for tall, strong women... He offers her a new life with the Dendarii, and a new name: Taura. They escape, committing one supreme act of sabotage and revenge before Dendarii Captain Bel Thorne manages to negotiate a ransom.

Miles finds several aspects of the deal unacceptable and the exchange turns into a minor battle with Ryoval&#x27;s security. In the course of their hasty departure from the Jackson system, Miles sows confusion by telling different lies (and a couple of vital truths) to Ryoval and his rival half-brother, weapons dealer Baron Fell. Collected in the omnibus editions &quot;Vorkosigan&#x27;s Game&quot;; &quot;Miles, Mystery, and Mayhem&quot;; &quot;Miles, Mutants and Microbes&quot;; and &quot;Borders of Infinity&quot;.

====&quot;The Borders of Infinity&quot; (novella)====
Miles goes undercover and allows himself to be captured by the Cetagandans, who have invaded and occupied the planet Marilac, in order to infiltrate a maximum-security POW camp on Dagoola IV. His mission is to get the Marilacan commander out, but he has to improvise when he finds the man catatonic and on the verge of death.

With help from Suegar, an apparent religious fanatic, and Tris, the leader of the female prisoners, he instills order and hope in the apathetic, distrustful inmates and makes them rehearse for quick embarkation (disguised as a food distribution procedure). By quoting Suegar&#x27;s &quot;scripture&quot; (half a page torn from &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;), Miles covertly signals his fleet to attack and rescue them. The Dendarii thereby stage one of the largest mass breakouts in history. As a result, the Cetagandans put a price on Naismith&#x27;s head. At this point, they (along with nearly everyone else) are unaware that Naismith and Miles Vorkosigan are one and the same. Collected in the omnibus editions &quot;Vorkosigan&#x27;s Game&quot;; &quot;Miles Errant&quot;; and &quot;Borders of Infinity&quot;.

====&quot;Brothers in Arms&quot;====

On the run from Cetagandans furious about his Dagoola IV escapade, Miles and his fleet reach the relative safety of Earth. When he reports to the Barrayaran Embassy there, he is made the Third Military Attaché. Miles is captured, and his clone, trained as an assassin by Komarrans bent on exacting a measure of revenge for the conquest and annexation of their planet, is successfully substituted for him. Collected in the omnibus edition &quot;Miles Errant&quot;.

====&quot;Borders of Infinity&quot;====
The novellas &quot;The Mountains of Mourning&quot;, &quot;Labyrinth&quot;, and &quot;The Borders of Infinity&quot; were reprinted with an untitled framing story in which Miles reports to Simon Illyan, head of Barrayaran Imperial Security (&quot;ImpSec&quot;). The framing story emphasizes an audit—both financial and political—of ImpSec, questioning Miles&#x27; activities and expenditures during the previous adventures. This volume is short-novel length; the three-novella anthology with its framing story was reprinted in the book sales club omnibus &quot;Vorkosigan&#x27;s Game&quot; (1990). The novellas are currently in print as part of other omnibus volumes but without the tie-together framing story.

====&quot;Mirror Dance&quot;====

Pretending to be Miles, Mark takes part of the Dendarii on a mission to free clones from Jackson&#x27;s Whole, but is soon surrounded by the enemy. When Miles comes to the rescue, things go very badly wrong. Collected in the omnibus edition &quot;Miles Errant&quot;.

====&quot;Memory&quot;====
After Miles is forced to resign from ImpSec for covering up his new medical disability, he finds himself temporarily appointed an Imperial Auditor, with sweeping powers and answerable only to the Emperor, to investigate the sudden mental impairment of ImpSec chief Simon Illyan.

====&quot;Komarr&quot;====
Miles Vorkosigan accompanies fellow Imperial Auditor Professor Vorthys to Komarr to investigate a serious accident in space which may have been sabotage. There, he manages to defeat plotters who seek to seal off the only wormhole to Barrayar, and falls in love with his hostess, Ekaterin Vorsoisson, who is trapped in an unhappy marriage.

This novel is notable for the switching of viewpoints between its two protagonists as part of the structure of a given scene. For instance, the scene of Ekaterin&#x27;s questioning with fast-penta begins from her viewpoint, but as the drug takes hold (and the novel begins a new chapter), it switches to Miles&#x27; viewpoint. This technique is expanded in the next novel where multiple viewpoints are used. Collected in the omnibus edition &quot;Miles in Love&quot;.

====&quot;A Civil Campaign&quot;====
As Barrayar prepares for Emperor Gregor Vorbarra&#x27;s wedding to a Komarran heiress, Miles attempts to court Ekaterin Vorsoisson without her knowledge. Part of the omnibus edition &quot;Miles in Love&quot;.

====&quot;Winterfair Gifts&quot; (novella)====
This novella was published in February 2004 as part of the anthology &quot;Irresistible Forces&quot; (Catherine Asaro, editor). Bujold wrote this after completing &quot;Diplomatic Immunity&quot;.

The wedding of Miles and Ekaterin is recounted from the viewpoint of Miles&#x27; Armsman Roic. Miles introduces Roic to Taura on her first (and due to her short life expectancy, probably her last) visit to Barrayar. The pair get along well, despite her rather unusual appearance. However, their blossoming romantic relationship is shattered when he makes a careless remark about &quot;hideous, bioengineered mutants&quot; —referring to the &#x27;butter bugs&#x27; in Mark&#x27;s latest commercial venture. Taura is hurt and insulted.

When Ekaterin is taken ill, Taura traces the cause to a string of pearls that had apparently been sent by current Dendarii Admiral (and Miles&#x27;s ex-lover) Elli Quinn, and which do not look right to her augmented vision. With Roic&#x27;s help, she brings it to the attention of ImpSec. The poisoned pearls are traced to a newly acquired enemy of Miles&#x27;. Ekaterin recovers, and the wedding goes smoothly.

That night, Roic is on guard when Taura joins him. She tells him that she probably only has a year or two left to live, and therefore takes everything as it comes. Roic replies, &quot;Can you teach me to do that?&quot; Collected in the omnibus edition &quot;Miles in Love&quot;.

====&quot;Diplomatic Immunity&quot;====

On the way back from his belated honeymoon, Miles is dispatched to Quaddiespace to untangle a diplomatic incident. Collected in the omnibus edition &quot;Miles, Mutants and Microbes&quot;.

====&quot;Captain Vorpatril&#x27;s Alliance&quot;====
On Komarr, Ivan is asked by an ImpSec friend to protect a pretty young woman targeted by a criminal gang, and stumbles into a conspiracy involving Jackson&#x27;s Whole politics, hired assassins, criminal syndicates, and an old and potentially dangerous secret on Barrayar. And embarrassing in-laws.

====&quot;The Flowers of Vashnoi&quot; (novella)====

Still new to her duties as Lady Vorkosigan, Ekaterin is working together with an expatriate scientist on a radical scheme to recover the lands of the Vashnoi exclusion zone, the lingering radioactive legacy of the Cetagandan invasion of the planet Barrayar. When the scientist&#x27;s experimental bioengineered creatures go missing, the pair discover that the zone still contains deadly old secrets.

====&quot;Cryoburn&quot;====
Miles investigates a cryogenic corporation on the planet Kibou-daini, with the assistance of Jin, a local boy.

====&quot;Gentleman Jole and the Red Queen&quot;====
Three years after the death of Aral Vorkosigan, Admiral Jole of the Sergyar Fleet (who once was Aral&#x27;s subordinate as well as lover) receives a proposal. Aral&#x27;s widow Cordelia plans to use the genetic material she and Aral had saved and offers him the option of fathering children from his genes and some of Aral&#x27;s frozen gametes.

<text>Mobilian Jargon (also Mobilian trade language, Mobilian Trade Jargon, Chickasaw–Choctaw trade language, Yamá) was a pidgin used as a lingua franca among Native American groups living along the north coast of the Gulf of Mexico around the time of European settlement of the region. It was the main language among Native tribes in this area, mainly Louisiana. There is evidence indicating its existence as early as the late 17th to early 18th century. The Native groups that are said to have used it were the Alabama, Apalachee, Biloxi, Chacato, Pakana, Pascagoula, Taensa, Tunica, Caddo, Chickasaw, Houma, Choctaw, Chitimacha, Natchez, and Ofo. The name is thought to refer to the Mobile Indians of the central Gulf Coast, but did not originate from this group; Mobilian Jargon is linguistically and grammatically different from the language traditionally spoken by the Mobile Indians.

Mobilian Jargon facilitated trade between tribes speaking different languages and European settlers. There is continuing debate as to when Mobilian Jargon first began to be spoken. Some scholars, such as James Crawford, have argued that Mobilian Jargon has its origins in the linguistically diverse environment following the establishment of the French colony of Louisiana. Others, however, suggest that the already linguistically diverse environment of the lower Mississippi basin drove the need for a common method of communication prior to regular contact with Europeans.

The Native Americans of the Gulf coast and Mississippi valley have always spoken multiple languages, mainly the languages of the other tribes that inhabited the same area. The Mobilians, like these neighboring tribes, were also multi-lingual. By the early 19th century, Mobilian Jargon evolved from functioning solely as a contact language between people into a means of personal identification. With an increasing presence of outsiders in the Indian Gulf coast community, Mobilian Jargon served as a way of knowing who was truly a native of the area, and allowed Mobilians to be socially isolated from non-Indian population expansion from the north.

==History==

=== Origins ===
The accepted view of the origin is that it developed from contact with the French in the 18th century. But there is obscurity in that. It seems that there was a pre-European origin that is supported through its well-established use in diverse indigenous contexts, geographic overlapping with that of Southeastern Indian groups formerly associated in multilingual paramount chiefdoms of the pre-Columbian Mississippian complex, and its indigenous grammar. Mobilian Jargon has a recorded history of at least 250 years where the first reliable evidence dated 1700. For two centuries it was socially accepted to use as a lingua franca with the outsiders they interacted with, such as traders and settlers. It is presumed that fur traders spread the language to Choctaw and Chickasaw provinces. Though Indians spoke in Mobilian Jargon to outsiders, the outsiders did not have a full understanding of how special the nature and functions of Mobilian Jargon was. Because of this, the Indians created a cultural barrier, preserving their cultural integrity and privacy from non-Indian groups. The pervasiveness of Mobilian Jargon, as a result, created its longtime survival.

Mobilian Jargon is a pidginized or &quot;corrupted&quot;/&quot;complex&quot; form of Choctaw and Chickasaw (both Western Muskogean) that also contains elements of Eastern Muskogean languages such as Alabama and Koasati, colonial languages including Spanish, French, and English, and perhaps Algonquian and/or other languages. Pamela Munro has argued that Choctaw is the major contributing language (not both Choctaw and Chickasaw) although this has been challenged by Emanuel Drechsel. He has concluded that the presence of certain Algonquian words in Mobilian Jargon are the result of direct contact between the Mobilians of the Mississippi valley and Algonquians moving southward. For the most part, these &quot;loanwords&quot; differ by only one or two letters.

=== Extinction ===
Mobilian has not survived as a functional language. There is documentary evidence of it in numerous historical records such as journals, diaries, reports and scholarly treatments. What was recorded, though, was very little, and it is safe to assume that Europeans did not have a full understanding of Mobilian. They believed that Mobilian was the mother of all other Indian languages, failing to notice that it was actually a hybrid of the Choctaw and Chickasaw languages.

=== Revival ===
When it was no longer needed as a spoken trade language, Mobilian was lost and eventually became extinct. It was first written about in the 1700s and was spoken until the 1950s. In the 1980s, elders in the Louisiana region could still recall a few words and phrases. In 2012, the Mezcal Jazz Unit of Montpellier, France, collaborated by Internet with Grayhawk Perkins, a historian of the Muskogean nation, to make a recording titled &quot;Thirteen Moons&quot;, which features &quot;the soulful chants of ancient folk tales and more modern stories told in Mobilian.&quot;

==Distribution==
Mobilian was used from the Florida northwest coast and area of the current Alabama-Georgia border westward as far as eastern Texas and in the north from the lower Mississippi Valley (currently south and central Illinois) to the southern Mississippi River Delta region in the south. It is known to have been used by the Alabama, Apalachee, Biloxi, Chacato, Pakana, Pascagoula, Taensa, Tunica, Caddo, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Chitimacha, Natchez, and Ofo. There is some evidence that Mobilian Jargon was used about 500 miles upstream the Missouri River near the Oyo or Osage Indians during the late 18th century. Some scholars also have reason to believe that the language was used or somehow came in contact with groups using the Algonquian languages of the Northeast to Midwest, with which Mobilian Jargon shares a number of words, such as papo(s) or papoš, meaning &#x27;baby, child&#x27;, which undeniably resembles the Narragansett word with the same meaning, pápūs. It is unknown how the crossover between the languages occurred; some possibilities include direct contact with Algonquian-speaking peoples in Virginia and North Carolina, or perhaps contact with French explorers using the Algonquian language at the time. Other Europeans also learned the language, but not in a way where they understood the cultural aspects of it; just enough for them to be able to trade with the Indians. 

== Grammar ==
In its syntax, Mobilian Jargon was fundamentally Muskogean and compared to other southeastern Indian tribes it showed a reduced morphology. Its lexicon shares major similarities to other Muskogean languages, in particular to Chickasaw and to Alabama. Though it evolved from more complex and polysynthetic Native American languages, Mobilian Jargon has a simpler structure where verbs are not required to have subject or object affixes and the subject-object-verb ordering in the sentence is variable. It also requires a separate word after the verb to indicate tense, whereas Muskogean languages use a suffix. It has a simplified syllable and sound structure and a simplified grammar as compared to Choctaw, its primary parent language. Mobilian Jargon was at one point a Muskogean- based pidgin. It was linguistically reduced from analytical grammar. Mobilian Jargon related to Muskogean proper linguistics and historical facts. Mobilians used a lot of Western Muskogean in their spoken language. Compare the personal pronouns among Muskogean languages:

== Phonology ==

== Lexicon ==
Mobilian Jargon consists of about 1,250 words of various origins. Of 150 words studied most were from Western Muskogean/Choctaw-Chickisaw, 20 were split between Western Muskogean and Alabama-Koasati, 14 were from Alabama-Koasati, 3 were from English, 2 were from Spanish, 1 was from French, and one from Algonquin.

<doc id="21073" wikidata="Q312086" url="?curid=21073" title="Mad (magazine)">
<text>Mad (stylized in all caps) is an American humor magazine which was launched in 1952 and currently published by DC Comics, a unit of the DC Entertainment subsidiary of Warner Bros. Discovery. &quot;Mad&quot; was founded by editor Harvey Kurtzman and publisher William Gaines, launched as a comic book series before it became a magazine. It was widely imitated and influential, affecting satirical media, as well as the cultural landscape of the late 20th century, with editor Al Feldstein increasing readership to more than two million during its 1973–1974 circulation peak. It is the last surviving strip in the EC Comics line, which sold &quot;Mad&quot; to Premier Industries in 1961, but closed in 1956.

&quot;Mad&quot; publishes satire on all aspects of life and popular culture, politics, entertainment, and public figures. Its format includes TV and movie parodies, and satire articles about everyday occurrences that are changed to seem humorous. &quot;Mad&quot;″s mascot, Alfred E. Neuman, is usually on the cover, with his face replacing that of a celebrity or character who is being lampooned. From 1952 to 2018, &quot;Mad&quot; published 550 regular magazine issues, as well as scores of reprint &quot;Specials&quot;, original-material paperbacks, reprint compilation books and other print projects. After AT&amp;T merged with DC&#x27;s then-owner Time Warner in June 2018, &quot;Mad&quot; ended newsstand distribution, continuing in comic-book stores and via subscription.

==History==


&quot;Mad&quot; began as a comic book published by EC, debuting in August 1952 (cover date October–November). The &quot;Mad&quot; office was initially located in lower Manhattan at 225 Lafayette Street, while in the early 1960s it moved to 485 Madison Avenue, the location listed in the magazine as &quot;485 MADison Avenue&quot;.

The first issue was written almost entirely by Harvey Kurtzman, and featured illustrations by him, Wally Wood, Will Elder, Jack Davis, and John Severin. Wood, Elder, and Davis were to be the three main illustrators throughout the 23-issue run of the comic book.

To retain Kurtzman as its editor, the comic book converted to magazine format as of issue No. 24, in 1955. The switchover induced Kurtzman to remain for one more year, but the move had removed &quot;Mad&quot; from the strictures of the Comics Code Authority. William Gaines related in 1992 that &quot;Mad&quot; &quot;was not changed [into a magazine] to avoid the Code&quot; but &quot;as a result of this [change of format] it &quot;did&quot; avoid the Code.&quot; Gaines claimed that Kurtzman had at the time received &quot;a very lucrative offer from... &quot;Pageant&quot; magazine,&quot; and seeing as he, Kurtzman, &quot;had, prior to that time, evinced an interest in changing &quot;Mad&quot; into a magazine,&quot; Gaines, &quot;not know[ing] anything about publishing magazines,&quot; countered that offer by allowing Kurtzman to make the change. Gaines further stated that &quot;if Harvey [Kurtzman] had not gotten that offer from &quot;Pageant&quot;, &quot;Mad&quot; probably would not have changed format.&quot;

After Kurtzman&#x27;s departure in 1956, new editor Al Feldstein swiftly brought aboard contributors such as Don Martin, Frank Jacobs, and Mort Drucker, and later Antonio Prohías, Dave Berg, and Sergio Aragonés. The magazine&#x27;s circulation more than quadrupled during Feldstein&#x27;s tenure, peaking at 2,132,655 in 1974; it later declined to a third of this figure by the end of his time as editor.

In its earliest incarnation, new issues of the magazine appeared erratically, between four and nine times a year. By the end of 1958, &quot;Mad&quot; had settled on an unusual eight-times-a-year schedule, which lasted almost four decades. Issues would go on sale 7 to 9 weeks before the start of the month listed on the cover. Gaines felt the atypical timing was necessary to maintain the magazine&#x27;s level of quality. Beginning in 1994, &quot;Mad&quot; then began incrementally producing additional issues per year, until it reached a monthly schedule with issue No. 353 (Jan. 1997). With its 500th issue (June 2009), amid company-wide cutbacks at Time Warner, the magazine temporarily regressed to a quarterly publication before settling to six issues per year in 2010.

Gaines sold his company in 1961 to Premier Industries, a maker of venetian blinds. Around 1964, Premier sold &quot;Mad&quot; to Independent News, a division of National Periodical Publications, the publisher of DC Comics. In the summer of 1967, Kinney National Company purchased National Periodical Publications. Kinney bought Warner Bros.-Seven Arts in early 1969. As a result of the car parking scandal, Kinney Services spun off of its non-entertainment assets to form National Kinney Corporation in August 1971, and it reincorporated as Warner Communications, Inc. on February 10, 1972. In 1977, National Periodical Publications was renamed DC Comics.

Feldstein retired in 1985, and was replaced by the senior team of Nick Meglin and John Ficarra, who co-edited &quot;Mad&quot; for the next two decades. Long-time production artist Lenny &quot;The Beard&quot; Brenner was promoted to art director and Joe Raiola and Charlie Kadau joined the staff as junior editors. Following Gaines&#x27;s death in 1992, &quot;Mad&quot; became more ingrained within the Time Warner (now WarnerMedia) corporate structure. Eventually, the magazine was obliged to abandon its long-time home at 485 Madison Avenue and in the mid-1990s it moved into DC Comics&#x27;s offices at the same time that DC relocated to 1700 Broadway. In issue No. 403 of March 2001, the magazine broke its long-standing taboo and began running paid advertising. The outside revenue allowed the introduction of color printing and improved paper stock. After Meglin retired in 2004, the team of Ficarra (as executive editor) Raiola and Kadau (as senior editors), and Sam Viviano, who had taken over as art director in 1999, would helm &quot;Mad&quot; for the next 14 years.

Throughout the years, &quot;MAD&quot; remained a unique mix of adolescent silliness and political humor. In November 2017, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that &quot;operating under the cover of barf jokes, &quot;MAD&quot; has become America&#x27;s best political satire magazine.&quot; Nevertheless, &quot;Mad&quot; ended its 65-year run in New York City at the end of 2017 with issue No. 550 (cover-dated April 2018), in preparation for the relocation of its offices to DC Entertainment&#x27;s headquarters in Burbank, California. Bill Morrison was named in June 2017 to succeed Ficarra in January 2018. None of &quot;MAD&quot;″s New York staff made the move, resulting in a change in editorial leadership, tone, and art direction. More than a hundred new names made their &quot;Mad&quot; debuts including Brian Posehn, Maria Bamford, Ian Boothby, Luke McGarry, Akilah Hughes, and future Pulitzer Prize finalist Pia Guerra. Scores of artists and writers from the New York run also returned to the pages of the California-based issues including contributors Sergio Aragonés, Al Jaffee, Desmond Devlin, Tom Richmond, Peter Kuper, Teresa Burns Parkhurst, Rick Tulka, Tom Bunk, Jeff Kruse, Ed Steckley, Arie Kaplan, writer and former Senior Editor Charlie Kadau, and artist and former Art Director Sam Viviano. The first California issue of &quot;Mad&quot; was renumbered as &quot;#1.&quot; In 2019, the rebooted magazine earned two Eisner Award nominations—the first such nominations in &quot;MAD&#x27;s&quot; history—for the Best Short Story and Best Humor Publication categories.

AT&amp;T acquired Time Warner in June 2018. Morrison exited &quot;MAD&quot; by March 2019, during a time of layoffs and restructuring at DC Entertainment. After issue No. 10 (Dec. 2019) of the new Burbank edition, &quot;Mad&quot; began to consist mostly of curated reprints with new covers and fold-ins, although some new articles have been periodically featured, including parodies of &quot;The Batman&quot; (&quot;The Bathroom&quot;) and Elon Musk&#x27;s tenure at Twitter (in a Dr. Seuss parody called &quot;Free Speeches On The Beaches&quot;). Distribution to newsstands stopped, with the magazine initially becoming available only through comic-book shops and by subscription, although in 2022 distribution expanded to Barnes &amp; Noble via a series of compilation issues dubbed &quot;The Treasure Trove of Trash&quot;.

==Influence==
Though there are antecedents to &quot;Mad&quot;″s style of humor in print, radio and film, &quot;Mad&quot; became a signature example of it. Throughout the 1950s, &quot;Mad&quot; featured groundbreaking parodies combining a sentimental fondness for the familiar staples of American culture—such as Archie and Superman—with a keen joy in exposing the fakery behind the image. Its approach was described by Dave Kehr in &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;Bob Elliott and Ray Goulding on the radio, Ernie Kovacs on television, Stan Freberg on records, Harvey Kurtzman in the early issues of &quot;Mad&quot;: all of those pioneering humorists and many others realized that the real world mattered less to people than the sea of sounds and images that the ever more powerful mass media were pumping into American lives.&quot; Bob and Ray, Kovacs and Freberg all became contributors to &quot;Mad&quot;.

In 1977, Tony Hiss and Jeff Lewis wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; about the then-25-year-old publication&#x27;s initial effect:

&quot;Mad&quot; is often credited with filling a vital gap in political satire from the 1950s to 1970s, when Cold War paranoia and a general culture of censorship prevailed in the United States, especially in literature for teens. Activist Tom Hayden said, &quot;My own radical journey began with &quot;Mad Magazine&quot;.&quot; The rise of such factors as cable television and the Internet has diminished the influence and impact of &quot;Mad&quot;, although it remains a widely distributed magazine. In a way, &quot;Mad&quot;″s power has been undone by its own success: what was subversive in the 1950s and 1960s is now commonplace. However, its impact on three generations of humorists is incalculable, as can be seen in the frequent references to &quot;Mad&quot; on the animated series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. &quot;The Simpsons&quot; producer Bill Oakley said, &quot;&quot;The Simpsons&quot; has transplanted &quot;Mad&quot; magazine. Basically everyone who was young between 1955 and 1975 read &quot;Mad&quot;, and that&#x27;s where your sense of humor came from. And we knew all these people, you know, Dave Berg and Don Martin—all heroes, and unfortunately, now all dead.&quot; In 2009, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;Mad&quot; once defined American satire; now it heckles from the margins as all of culture competes for trickster status.&quot; Longtime contributor Al Jaffee described the dilemma to an interviewer in 2010: &quot;When &quot;Mad&quot; first came out, in 1952, it was the only game in town. Now, you&#x27;ve got graduates from &quot;Mad&quot; who are doing &quot;The Today Show&quot; or &quot;Stephen Colbert&quot; or &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. All of these people grew up on &quot;Mad&quot;. Now &quot;Mad&quot; has to top them. So &quot;Mad&quot; is almost in a competition with itself.&quot;

&quot;Mad&quot;″s satiric net was cast wide. The magazine often featured parodies of ongoing American culture, including advertising campaigns, the nuclear family, the media, big business, education and publishing. In the 1960s and beyond, it satirized such burgeoning topics as the sexual revolution, hippies, the generation gap, psychoanalysis, gun politics, pollution, the Vietnam War and recreational drug use. The magazine took a generally negative tone towards counterculture drugs such as cannabis and LSD, but it also savaged mainstream drugs such as tobacco and alcohol. &quot;Mad&quot; always satirized Democrats as mercilessly as it did Republicans. In 2007, Al Feldstein recalled, &quot;We even used to rake the hippies over the coals. They were protesting the Vietnam War, but we took aspects of their culture and had fun with it. &quot;Mad&quot; was wide open. Bill loved it, and he was a capitalist Republican. I loved it, and I was a liberal Democrat. That went for the writers, too; they all had their own political leanings, and everybody had a voice. But the voices were mostly critical. It was social commentary, after all.&quot; &quot;Mad&quot; also ran a good deal of less topical or contentious material on such varied subjects as fairy tales, nursery rhymes, greeting cards, sports, small talk, poetry, marriage, comic strips, awards shows, cars and many other areas of general interest.

In 2007, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;″ Robert Boyd wrote, &quot;All I really need to know I learned from &quot;Mad&quot; magazine&quot;, going on to assert:


In 1988, Geoffrey O&#x27;Brien wrote about the impact &quot;Mad&quot; had upon the younger generation of the 1950s:

In 1994, Brian Siano in &quot;The Humanist&quot; discussed the effect of &quot;Mad&quot; on that segment of people already disaffected from society:

Pulitzer Prize-winning art comics maven Art Spiegelman said, &quot;The message &quot;Mad&quot; had in general is, &#x27;The media is lying to you, and we are part of the media.&#x27; It was basically ... &#x27;Think for yourselves, kids. William Gaines offered his own view: when asked to cite &quot;Mad&quot;″s philosophy, his boisterous answer was, &quot;We must never stop reminding the reader what little value they get for their money!&quot;

Comics historian Tom Spurgeon picked &quot;Mad&quot; as the medium&#x27;s top series of all time, writing, &quot;At the height of its influence, &quot;Mad&quot; was &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;The Daily Show&quot; and &quot;The Onion&quot; combined.&quot; Graydon Carter chose it as the sixth-best magazine of any sort ever, describing &quot;Mad&quot;″s mission as being &quot;ever ready to pounce on the illogical, hypocritical, self-serious and ludicrous&quot; before concluding, &quot;Nowadays, it&#x27;s part of the oxygen we breathe.&quot; Joyce Carol Oates called it &quot;wonderfully inventive, irresistibly irreverent and intermittently ingenious&quot;.

Artist Dave Gibbons said, &quot;When you think of the people who grew up in the &#x27;50s and &#x27;60s, the letters M-A-D were probably as influential as L-S-D, in that it kind of expanded people&#x27;s consciousness and showed them an alternative view of society and consumer culture—mocked it, satirized it.&quot; Gibbons also noted that &quot;Mad&quot; was an overt influence on &quot;Watchmen&quot;, the acclaimed 12-issue comic book series created by writer Alan Moore and himself:
In a 1985 &quot;Tonight Show&quot; appearance, when Johnny Carson asked Michael J. Fox, &quot;When did you really know you&#x27;d made it in show business?&quot;, Fox replied, &quot;When Mort Drucker drew my head.&quot; In 2019, Terence Winter, writer and producer of &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, told &quot;Variety&quot; &quot;When we got into &quot;Mad&quot; Magazine, that was the highlight for me. That said everything.&quot;

Monty Python&#x27;s Terry Gilliam wrote, &quot;&quot;Mad&quot; became the Bible for me and my whole generation.&quot; Underground cartoonist Bill Griffith said of his youth, &quot;&quot;Mad&quot; was a life raft in a place like Levittown, where all around you were the things that &quot;Mad&quot; was skewering and making fun of.&quot;

Robert Crumb remarked, &quot;Artists are always trying to equal the work that impressed them in their childhood and youth. I still feel extremely inadequate when I look at the old &quot;Mad&quot; comics.&quot;

When Weird Al Yankovic was asked whether &quot;Mad&quot; had had any influence in putting him on a road to a career in parody, the musician replied, &quot;[It was] more like going off a cliff.&quot; &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; writer-actor Frank Conniff wrote, &quot;Without &quot;Mad&quot; Magazine, &quot;MST3K&quot; would have been slightly different, like for instance, it wouldn&#x27;t have existed.&quot; Comedian Jerry Seinfeld talked about the magazine&#x27;s impact on him, saying, &quot;You start reading it, and you&#x27;re going, &#x27;These people don&#x27;t respect &quot;anything&quot;.&#x27; And that just exploded my head. It was like, you don&#x27;t have to buy it. You can say &#x27;This is stupid. This is stupid.

Critic Roger Ebert wrote:

Rock singer Patti Smith said more succinctly, &quot;After &quot;Mad&quot;, drugs were nothing.&quot;

==Recurring features==

&quot;Mad&quot; is known for many regular and semi-regular recurring features in its pages, including &quot;Spy vs. Spy&quot;, the &quot;Mad Fold-in&quot;, &quot;The Lighter Side of ...&quot; and its television and movie parodies. The magazine has also included recurring gags and references, both visual (e.g. the &quot;Mad&quot; Zeppelin, or Arthur the potted plant) and linguistic (unusual words such as axolotl, furshlugginer, potrzebie and veeblefetzer).

===Alfred E. Neuman===
The image most closely associated with the magazine is that of Alfred E. Neuman, the boy with misaligned eyes, a gap-toothed smile, and the perennial motto &quot;What, me worry?&quot; The original image was a popular humorous graphic for many decades before &quot;Mad&quot; adopted it, but the face is now primarily associated with &quot;Mad&quot;.

&quot;Mad&quot; initially used the boy&#x27;s face in November 1954. His first iconic full-cover appearance was as a write-in candidate for president on issue No. 30 (December 1956), in which he was identified by name and sported his &quot;What, me worry?&quot; motto. He has since appeared in a slew of guises and comic situations. According to &quot;Mad&quot; writer Frank Jacobs, a letter was once successfully delivered to the magazine through the U.S. mail bearing only Neuman&#x27;s face, without any address or other identifying information.

==Legal disputes==
The magazine has been involved in various legal actions over the decades, some of which have reached the United States Supreme Court. The most far-reaching was &quot;Irving Berlin et al. v. E.C. Publications, Inc.&quot; In 1961, a group of music publishers representing songwriters such as Irving Berlin, Richard Rodgers, and Cole Porter filed a $25 million lawsuit against &quot;Mad&quot; for copyright infringement following &quot;Sing Along With &quot;Mad&quot;&quot;, a collection of parody lyrics which the magazine said could be &quot;sung to the tune of&quot; many popular songs. The publishing group hoped to establish a legal precedent that only a song&#x27;s composers retained the right to parody that song. Judge Charles Metzner of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled largely in favor of &quot;Mad&quot; in 1963, affirming its right to print 23 of the 25 song parodies under dispute. However, in the case of two parodies, &quot;Always&quot; (sung to the tune of &quot;Always&quot;) and &quot;There&#x27;s No Business Like No Business&quot; (sung to the tune of &quot;There&#x27;s No Business Like Show Business&quot;), Judge Metzner decided that the issue of copyright infringement was closer, requiring a trial because in each case the parodies relied on the same verbal hooks (&quot;always&quot; and &quot;business&quot;) as the originals. The music publishers appealed the ruling, but the U.S. Court of Appeals not only upheld the pro-&quot;Mad&quot; decision in regard to the 23 songs, it adopted an approach that was broad enough to strip the publishers of their limited victory regarding the remaining two songs. Writing a unanimous opinion for the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, Circuit Judge Irving Kaufman observed, &quot;We doubt that even so eminent a composer as plaintiff Irving Berlin should be permitted to claim a property interest in iambic pentameter.&quot; The publishers again appealed, but the Supreme Court refused to hear it, allowing the decision to stand.

This precedent-setting 1964 ruling established the rights of parodists and satirists to mimic the meter of popular songs. However, the &quot;Sing Along With &quot;Mad&quot;&quot; songbook was not the magazine&#x27;s first venture into musical parody. In 1960, &quot;Mad&quot; had published &quot;My Fair Ad-Man&quot;, a full advertising-based spoof of the hit Broadway musical &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;. In 1959, &quot;If Gilbert &amp; Sullivan wrote &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;&quot; was one of the speculative pairings in &quot;If Famous Authors Wrote the Comics&quot;.

In 1966, a series of copyright infringement lawsuits against the magazine regarding ownership of the Alfred E. Neuman image eventually reached the appellate level. Although Harry Stuff had copyrighted the image in 1914, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that, by allowing many copies of the image to circulate without any copyright notice, the owner of the copyright had allowed the image to pass into the public domain, thus establishing the right of &quot;Mad&quot;—or anyone else—to use the image. In addition, &quot;Mad&quot; established that Stuff was not himself the creator of the image, by producing numerous other examples dating back to the late 19th century. This decision was also allowed to stand.

Other legal disputes were settled more easily. Following the magazine&#x27;s parody of the film &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, a letter from George Lucas&#x27;s lawyers arrived in &quot;Mad&quot;&#x27;s offices demanding that the issue be recalled for infringement on copyrighted figures. The letter further demanded that the printing plates be destroyed, and that Lucasfilm must receive all revenue from the issue plus additional punitive damages. Unbeknownst to Lucas&#x27; lawyers, &quot;Mad&quot; had received a letter weeks earlier from Lucas himself, expressing delight over the parody and calling artist Mort Drucker and writer Dick DeBartolo &quot;the Leonardo da Vinci and George Bernard Shaw of comic satire.&quot; Publisher Bill Gaines made a copy of Lucas&#x27; letter, added the handwritten notation &quot;Gee, your boss George liked it!&quot; across the top, and mailed it to the lawyers. Said DeBartolo, &quot;We never heard from them again.&quot;

&quot;Mad&quot; was one of several parties that filed &quot;amicus curiae&quot; briefs with the Supreme Court in support of 2 Live Crew and its disputed song parody, during the 1993 &quot;Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.&quot; case.

==Advertising==
&quot;Mad&quot; was long noted for its absence of advertising, enabling it to satirize materialist culture without fear of reprisal. For decades, it was the most successful American magazine to publish ad-free, beginning with issue No. 33 (April 1957) and continuing through issue No. 402 (February 2001).

As a comic book, &quot;Mad&quot; had run the same advertisements as the rest of EC&#x27;s line. The magazine later made a deal with Moxie soda that involved inserting the Moxie logo into various articles. &quot;Mad&quot; ran a limited number of ads in its first two years as a magazine, helpfully labeled &quot;real advertisement&quot; to differentiate the real from the parodies. The last authentic ad published under the original &quot;Mad&quot; regime was for Famous Artists School; two issues later, the inside front cover of issue No. 34 had a parody of the same ad. After this transitional period, the only promotions to appear in &quot;Mad&quot; for decades were house ads for &quot;Mad&quot;&#x27;s own books and specials, subscriptions, and promotional items such as ceramic busts, T-shirts, or a line of &quot;Mad&quot; jewelry. This rule was bent only a few times to promote outside products directly related to the magazine, such as &quot;The Mad Magazine Game&quot;, a series of video games based on &quot;Spy vs. Spy&quot;, and the notorious &quot;Up the Academy&quot; movie (which the magazine later disowned). &quot;Mad&quot; explicitly promised that it would never make its mailing list available.

Both Kurtzman and Feldstein wanted the magazine to solicit advertising, feeling this could be accomplished without compromising &quot;Mad&quot;&#x27;s content or editorial independence. Kurtzman remembered &quot;Ballyhoo&quot;, a boisterous 1930s humor publication that made an editorial point of mocking its own sponsors. Feldstein went so far as to propose an in-house &quot;Mad&quot; ad agency, and produced a &quot;dummy&quot; copy of what an issue with ads could look like. But Bill Gaines was intractable, telling the television news magazine &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, &quot;We long ago decided we couldn&#x27;t take money from Pepsi-Cola and make fun of Coca-Cola.&quot; Gaines&#x27; motivation in eschewing ad dollars was less philosophical than practical:

==Contributors and criticism==
&quot;Mad&quot; has provided a continuing showcase for many long-running satirical writers and artists and has fostered an unusual group loyalty. Although several of the contributors earn far more than their &quot;Mad&quot; pay in fields such as television and advertising, they have steadily continued to provide material for the publication. Among the notable artists were the aforementioned Davis, Elder and Wood, as well as Sergio Aragonés, Mort Drucker, Don Martin, Dave Berg, George Woodbridge, Harry North and Paul Coker. Writers such as Dick DeBartolo, Stan Hart, Frank Jacobs, Tom Koch, and Arnie Kogen appeared regularly in the magazine&#x27;s pages. In several cases, only infirmity or death has ended a contributor&#x27;s run at &quot;Mad.&quot;

Within the industry, &quot;Mad&quot; was known for the uncommonly prompt manner in which its contributors were paid. Publisher Gaines would typically write a personal check and give it to the artist upon receipt of the finished product. Wally Wood said, &quot;I got spoiled ... Other publishers don&#x27;t do that. I started to get upset if I had to wait a whole week for my check.&quot; Another lure for contributors was the annual &quot;Mad Trip&quot;, an all-expenses-paid tradition that began in 1960. The editorial staff was automatically invited, along with freelancers who had qualified for an invitation by selling a set number of articles or pages during the previous year. Gaines was strict about enforcing this quota, and one year, longtime writer and frequent traveller Arnie Kogen was bumped off the list. Later that year, Gaines&#x27; mother died, and Kogen was asked if he would be attending the funeral. &quot;I can&#x27;t,&quot; said Kogen, &quot;I don&#x27;t have enough pages.&quot; Over the years, the &quot;Mad&quot; crew traveled to such locales as France, Kenya, Russia, Hong Kong, England, Amsterdam, Tahiti, Morocco, Italy, Greece, and Germany. The tradition ended with Gaines&#x27; death, and a 1993 trip to Monte Carlo.

Although &quot;Mad&quot; was an exclusively freelance publication, it achieved remarkable stability, with numerous contributors remaining prominent for decades. Critics of the magazine felt that this lack of turnover eventually led to a formulaic sameness, although there is little agreement on when the magazine peaked or plunged.

Proclaiming the precise moment that purportedly triggered the magazine&#x27;s irreversible decline is a common pastime. Among the most frequently cited &quot;downward turning points&quot; are: creator-editor Harvey Kurtzman&#x27;s departure in 1957; the magazine&#x27;s mainstream success; adoption of recurring features starting in the early 1960s; the magazine&#x27;s absorption into a more corporate structure in 1968 (or later, the mid-1990s); founder Gaines&#x27; death in 1992; the magazine&#x27;s publicized &quot;edgy revamp&quot; in 1997; the arrival of paid advertising in 2001; or the magazine&#x27;s 2018 move to California. &quot;Mad&quot; has been criticized for its over-reliance on a core group of aging regulars throughout the 1970s and 1980s, and then criticized again for an alleged downturn as those same creators began to leave, die, retire, or contribute less frequently.

It has been proposed that &quot;Mad&quot; is more susceptible to this criticism than many media because a sizable percentage of its readership turns over regularly as it ages, as &quot;Mad&quot; focuses greatly on current events and a changing popular culture. In 2010, Sergio Aragonés said, &quot;&quot;Mad&quot; is written by people who never thought &#x27;Okay, I&#x27;m going to write for kids,&#x27; or &#x27;I&#x27;m going to write for adults.&#x27; ... And many people say &#x27;I used to read &quot;Mad&quot;, but &quot;Mad&quot; has changed a lot.&#x27; Excuse me— you grew up! You have new interests. ... The change doesn&#x27;t come from the magazine, it comes from the people who grow or don&#x27;t grow.&quot; &quot;Mad&quot; poked fun at the tendency of readers to accuse the magazine of declining in quality at various points in its history in its &quot;Untold History of &quot;Mad&quot; Magazine&quot;, a self-referential faux history in the 400th issue which joked: &quot;The second issue of &quot;Mad&quot; goes on sale on December 9, 1952. On December 11, the first-ever letter complaining that &quot;Mad&quot; &#x27;just isn&#x27;t as funny and original like it used to be&#x27; arrives.&quot; The magazine&#x27;s art director, Sam Viviano, suggested in 2002 that historically, &quot;Mad&quot; was at its best &quot;whenever you first started reading it.&quot; According to former &quot;Mad&quot; Senior Editor Joe Raiola, &quot;&quot;Mad&quot; is the only place in America where if you mature, you get fired.&quot;

Among the loudest of those who insist the magazine is no longer funny are supporters of Harvey Kurtzman, who left &quot;Mad&quot; after just 28 issues.

However, just how much of that success was due to the original Kurtzman template that he left for his successor, and how much should be credited to the Al Feldstein system and the depth of the post-Kurtzman talent pool, can be argued without resolution. In 2009, an interviewer proposed to Al Jaffee, &quot;There&#x27;s a group of &quot;Mad&quot; aficionados who feel that if Harvey Kurtzman had stayed at &quot;Mad&quot;, the magazine would not only have been different, but better.&quot; Jaffee, a Kurtzman enthusiast, replied, &quot;And then there&#x27;s a large group who feel that if Harvey had stayed with &quot;Mad&quot;, he would have upgraded it to the point that only fifteen people would buy it.&quot; During Kurtzman&#x27;s final two-plus years at EC, &quot;Mad&quot; appeared erratically (ten issues appeared in 1954, followed by eight issues in 1955 and four issues in 1956). Feldstein was less well regarded creatively, but kept the magazine on a regular schedule, leading to decades of success. (Kurtzman and Will Elder returned to &quot;Mad&quot; for a short time in the mid-1980s as an illustrating team.)

The magazine&#x27;s sales peak came with issue No. 161 (September 1973), which sold 2.4 million copies in 1973. That period coincided with several other magazines&#x27; sales peaks, including &quot;TV Guide&quot; and &quot;Playboy&quot;. &quot;Mad&quot;″s circulation dropped below one million for the first time in 1983.

Many of the magazine&#x27;s mainstays began retiring or dying by the 1980s. Newer contributors who appeared in the years that followed include Joe Raiola, Charlie Kadau, Tony Barbieri, Scott Bricher, Tom Bunk, John Caldwell, Desmond Devlin, Drew Friedman, Barry Liebmann, Kevin Pope, Scott Maiko, Hermann Mejia, Tom Richmond, Andrew J. Schwartzberg, Mike Snider, Greg Theakston, Nadina Simon, Rick Tulka, and Bill Wray.

On April 1, 1997, the magazine publicized an alleged &quot;revamp&quot;, ostensibly designed to reach an older, more sophisticated readership. However, &quot;Salon&quot;″s David Futrelle opined that such content was very much a part of &quot;Mad&quot;″s past:
&quot;Mad&quot; editor John Ficarra acknowledged that changes in culture made the task of creating fresh satire more difficult, telling an interviewer, &quot;The editorial mission statement has always been the same: &#x27;Everyone is lying to you, including magazines. Think for yourself. Question authority.&#x27; But it&#x27;s gotten harder, as they&#x27;ve gotten better at lying and getting in on the joke.&quot;

&quot;Mad&quot; contributor Tom Richmond has responded to critics who say the magazine&#x27;s decision to accept advertising would make late publisher William Gaines &quot;turn over in his grave&quot;, pointing out this is impossible because Gaines was cremated.

===Contributors===

&quot;Mad&quot; is known for the stability and longevity of its talent roster, billed as &quot;The Usual Gang of Idiots&quot;, with several creators enjoying 30-, 40- and even 50-year careers in the magazine&#x27;s pages.

According to the &quot;Mad Magazine Contributor Appearances&quot; website, more than 960 contributors have received bylines in at least one issue of &quot;Mad&quot;, but only 41 of those have contributed to 100 issues or more. Writer-artist Al Jaffee has appeared in the most issues; No. 550 (April 2018) was the 500th issue with new work by Jaffee. The other three contributors to have appeared in more than 400 issues of &quot;Mad&quot; are Sergio Aragonés, Dick DeBartolo, and Mort Drucker; Dave Berg, Paul Coker, and Frank Jacobs have each topped the 300 mark.

Jaffee, Aragonés, Berg, Don Edwing and Don Martin are the five writer-artists to have appeared in the largest total of issues; DeBartolo, Jacobs, Desmond Devlin, Stan Hart, and Tom Koch are the five most frequent writers, and Drucker, Coker, Bob Clarke, Angelo Torres and George Woodbridge are the five top illustrators on the list. (The list calculates appearances by issue only, not by individual articles or overall page count; e.g. although Jacobs wrote three separate articles that appeared in issue No. 172, his total is reckoned to have increased by one.)

Each of the following contributors has created over 100 articles for the magazine:

* Dick DeBartolo
* Desmond Devlin
* Stan Hart

Over the years, the editorial staff, most notably Al Feldstein, Nick Meglin, John Ficarra, Joe Raiola, and Charlie Kadau have had creative input on countless articles and shaped &quot;Mad&quot;″s distinctive satiric voice.

===Other notable contributors===
Among the irregular contributors with just a single &quot;Mad&quot; byline to their credit are Charles M. Schulz, Chevy Chase, Andy Griffith, Will Eisner, Kevin Smith, J. Fred Muggs, Boris Vallejo, Sir John Tenniel, Jean Shepherd, Winona Ryder, Jimmy Kimmel, Jason Alexander, Walt Kelly, Rep. Barney Frank, Tom Wolfe, Steve Allen, Jim Lee, Jules Feiffer, Donald Knuth, and Richard Nixon, who remains the only President credited with &quot;writing&quot; a &quot;Mad&quot; article. (The entire text was taken from Nixon&#x27;s speeches.)

Those who have contributed twice apiece include Tom Lehrer, Wally Cox, Gustave Doré, Danny Kaye, Stan Freberg and Mort Walker. Appearing slightly more frequently were Frank Frazetta (3 bylines), Ernie Kovacs (11), Bob and Ray (12), Henry Morgan (3), and Sid Caesar (4). In its earliest years, before amassing its own staff of regulars, the magazine frequently used outside &quot;name&quot; talent. Often, &quot;Mad&quot; would simply illustrate the celebrities&#x27; preexisting material while promoting their names on the cover. The Bob and Ray association was particularly fruitful. When the magazine learned that Tom Koch was the writer behind the Bob and Ray radio sketches adapted by &quot;Mad&quot;, Koch was sought out by the editors and ultimately wrote more than 300 &quot;Mad&quot; articles over the next 37 years.

The magazine has occasionally run guest articles in which notables from show business or comic books have participated. In 1964, an article called &quot;Comic Strips They&#x27;d Really Like To Do&quot; featured one-shot proposals by cartoonists including Mell Lazarus and Charles M. Schulz. More than once, the magazine has enlisted popular comic book artists such as Frank Miller or Jim Lee to design and illustrate a series of &quot;Rejected Superheroes.&quot; In 2008, the magazine got national coverage for its article &quot;Why George W. Bush is in Favor of Global warming&quot;. Each of the piece&#x27;s 10 punchlines was illustrated by a different Pulitzer Prize-winning editorial cartoonist. In 2015, &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic served as the magazine&#x27;s first and only guest editor, writing some material and guiding the content in issue No. 533, while upping his own career &quot;Mad&quot; byline total from two to five.

==Reprints==
In 1955, Gaines began presenting reprints of material for &quot;Mad&quot; in black-and-white paperbacks, the first being &quot;The Mad Reader&quot;. Many of these featured new covers by &quot;Mad&quot; cover artist Norman Mingo. This practice continued into the 2000s, with more than 100 &quot;Mad&quot; paperbacks published. Gaines made a special effort to keep the entire line of paperbacks in print at all times, and the books were frequently reprinted in new editions with different covers. There were also dozens of &quot;Mad&quot; paperbacks featuring entirely new material by the magazine&#x27;s contributors.

&quot;Mad&quot; also frequently repackaged its material in a long series of &quot;Special&quot; format magazines, beginning in 1958 with two concurrent annual series entitled &quot;The Worst from Mad&quot; and &quot;More Trash from Mad&quot;. Later, the &quot;Special&quot; issue series expanded to &quot;Super Special&quot; editions. Various other titles have been used through the years. These reprint issues were sometimes augmented by exclusive features such as posters, stickers and, on a few occasions, recordings on flexi-disc. A 1972 &quot;Special&quot; edition began Mad&#x27;s including a comic book replica insert, consisting of reprinted material from the magazine&#x27;s 1952–1955 era.

===Facsimile Edition===
A Facsimile Edition of &quot;Mad&quot; #1, reprinting the entire issue (including the original advertisements), was published by DC Comics on June 4, 2024. The official title of the Facsimile Edition, as per the indicia, is &quot;Mad Magazine 1 (Facsimile Edition),&quot; whereas the official indicia title of the original publication, in both comic book and magazine format, has always been just &quot;Mad&quot; (not &quot;Mad Magazine&quot;), and the original &quot;Mad&quot; #1 it reprints was not a magazine but a comic book. (The only &quot;Mad&quot; #1 that was originally published as a physical magazine was the first issue of the 2018 reboot.)

==Spin-offs==
===&quot;Mad Kids&quot;===

Between 2005 and February 17, 2009, the magazine published 14 issues of &quot;Mad Kids,&quot; a spinoff publication aimed at a younger demographic. Reminiscent of Nickelodeon&#x27;s newsstand titles, it emphasized current kids&#x27; entertainment (e.g. &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot;, &quot;Naruto&quot;, &quot;High School Musical&quot;), albeit with an impudent voice. Much of the content of &quot;Mad Kids&quot; had originally appeared in the parent publication; reprinted material was chosen and edited to reflect grade schoolers&#x27; interests. But the quarterly magazine also included newly commissioned articles and cartoons, as well as puzzles, bonus inserts, a calendar, and the other activity-related content that is common to kids&#x27; magazines.

===Foreign editions===

&quot;Mad&quot; has been published in local versions in many countries, beginning with the United Kingdom in 1959, and Sweden in 1960. Each new market receives access to the publication&#x27;s back catalog of articles and is also encouraged to produce its own localized material in the &quot;Mad&quot; vein. However, the sensibility of the American &quot;Mad&quot; has not always translated to other cultures, and many of the foreign editions have had short lives or interrupted publications. The Swedish, Danish, Italian and Mexican &quot;Mad&quot;s were each published on three separate occasions; Norway has had four runs canceled. Brazil also had four runs, but without significant interruptions, spanning five decades. Australia (42 years), United Kingdom (35 years), and Sweden (34 years) have produced the longest uninterrupted &quot;Mad&quot; variants.

Conflicts over content have occasionally arisen between the parent magazine and its international franchisees. When a comic strip satirizing England&#x27;s royal family was reprinted in a &quot;Mad&quot; paperback, it was deemed necessary to rip out the page from 25,000 copies by hand before the book could be distributed in Great Britain. But &quot;Mad&quot; was also protective of its own editorial standards. Bill Gaines sent &quot;one of his typically dreadful, blistering letters&quot; to his Dutch editors after they published a bawdy gag about a men&#x27;s room urinal. &quot;Mad&quot; has since relaxed its requirements, and while the U.S. version still eschews overt profanity, the magazine generally poses no objections to more provocative content.

===Other satiric-comics magazines===

Following the success of &quot;Mad&quot;, other black-and-white magazines of topical, satiric comics began to be published. Most were short-lived. The three longest-lasting were &quot;Cracked&quot;, &quot;Sick&quot;, and &quot;Crazy Magazine&quot;. These three and many others featured a cover mascot along the lines of Alfred E. Neuman.

Color comic-book competitors, primarily in the mid-to-late 1950s, were &quot;Nuts!&quot;, &quot;Get Lost&quot;, &quot;Whack&quot;, &quot;Riot&quot;, &quot;Flip&quot;, &quot;Eh!&quot;, &quot;From Here to Insanity&quot;, and &quot;Madhouse&quot;; only the last of these lasted as many as eight issues, and some were canceled after an issue or two. Later color satiric comic books included &quot;Wild&quot;, &quot;Blast&quot;, &quot;Parody&quot;, &quot;Grin&quot; and &quot;Gag!&quot;. EC Comics itself offered the color comic &quot;Panic&quot;, produced by future &quot;Mad&quot; editor Al Feldstein. Two years after EC&#x27;s &quot;Panic&quot; had ceased publication in 1956, the title was used by another publisher for a similar comic.

In 1967, Marvel Comics produced the first of 13 issues of the comic book &quot;Not Brand Echh&quot;, which parodied the company&#x27;s own superhero titles as well as other publishers. From 1973 to 1976, DC Comics published the comic &quot;Plop!&quot;, which featured &quot;Mad&quot; stalwart Sergio Aragonés and frequent cover art by Basil Wolverton. Another publisher&#x27;s comic was &quot;Trash&quot; (1978) featured a blurb on the debut cover reading, &quot;We mess with &quot;Mad&quot; (p. 21)&quot; and depicted Alfred E. Neuman with a stubbly beard; the fourth and last issue showed two bodybuilders holding up copies of &quot;Mud&quot; and &quot;Crocked&quot; with the frowning faces of Neuman and &quot;Cracked&quot; cover mascot Sylvester P. Smythe.

Among other U.S. humor magazines that included some degree of comics art as well as text articles were former &quot;Mad&quot; editor Harvey Kurtzman&#x27;s &quot;Trump&quot;, &quot;Humbug&quot; and &quot;Help!&quot;, as well as &quot;National Lampoon&quot;.

Virginia Commonwealth University&#x27;s Cabell Library has an extensive collection of &quot;Mad&quot; along with other comic books and graphic novels.

===&quot;Claptrap&quot;===
With &quot;Mad&quot; ceasing the regular publication of new material after 2019, including film parodies, in future issues, the magazine&#x27;s veteran writer Desmond Devlin and caricaturist Tom Richmond announced that they would be teaming up to create &quot;Claptrap&quot;, a book full of twelve brand new movie parodies done in the classic &quot;Mad&quot; style. The movies are classics that &quot;Mad&quot; did not parody when they were first released. First scheduled to be released in November 2021, it was delayed four times, first to March, then August, then December 2022, and finally to June 2023.

==In other media==
Over the years, &quot;Mad&quot; has branched out from print into other media. During the Gaines years, the publisher had an aversion to exploiting his fan base and expressed the fear that substandard &quot;Mad&quot; products would offend them. He was known to personally issue refunds to anyone who wrote to the magazine with a complaint. Among the few outside &quot;Mad&quot; items available in its first 40 years were cufflinks, a T-shirt designed like a straitjacket (complete with lock), and a small ceramic Alfred E. Neuman bust. For decades, the letters page advertised an inexpensive portrait of Neuman (&quot;suitable for framing or for wrapping fish&quot;) with misleading slogans such as &quot;Only 1 Left!&quot; (The joke being that the picture was so undesirable that only one had left their office since the last ad.) After Gaines&#x27; death came an overt absorption into the Time-Warner publishing umbrella, with the result that &quot;Mad&quot; merchandise began to appear more frequently. Items were displayed in the Warner Bros. Studio Stores, and in 1994 &quot;The Mad Style Guide&quot; was created for licensing use.

===Recordings===
&quot;Mad&quot; has sponsored or inspired a number of recordings.

====1950s====
In 1959, Bernie Green &quot;with the Stereo Mad-Men&quot; recorded the album &quot;Musically Mad&quot; for RCA Victor, featuring humorous music, mostly instrumental, with an image of Alfred E. Neuman on the cover; it was nominated for the Grammy for Best Comedy Recording - Musical and has been reissued on CD. That same year, &quot;The Worst from Mad&quot; No. 2 included an original recording, &quot;Meet the staff of Mad&quot;, on a cardboard 33 rpm record, while a single credited to Alfred E. Neuman &amp; The Furshlugginger Five: &quot;What – Me Worry?&quot; (b/w &quot;Potrzebie&quot;), was issued in late 1959 on the ABC Paramount label.

====1960s====
Two full vinyl LP records were released under the aegis of &quot;Mad&quot; in the early 1960s: &quot;Mad &quot;Twists&quot; Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll&quot; (1962) and &quot;Fink Along With Mad&quot; (1963; the title being a takeoff on the then-popular TV show &quot;Sing Along With Mitch&quot;, with &quot;&quot; being a general insult then current in American slang).

In 1961, New York City doo-wop group The Dellwoods (recording then as the &quot;Sweet Sickteens&quot;) had released a novelty single on RCA Victor, written by Norman Blagman and Sam Bobrick, &quot;The Pretzel&quot; (a satiric take on then-current dance songs such as &quot;The Twist&quot;), b/w &quot;Agnes (The Teenage Russian Spy)&quot;. Both songs were later included on &quot;Mad &quot;Twists&quot; Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll&quot;. (The Sweet Sickteens were Victor Buccellato (lead singer), Mike Ellis (tenor), Andy Ventura (tenor), Amadeo Tese (baritone), and Saul Zeskand (bass),
In 1962, the Dellwoods (as they were now named), along with vocalists Mike Russo and Jeanne Hayes, recorded an entire album of novelty songs by Bobrick and Blagman. The album had originally been written and produced as a Dellwoods album for RCA, but was instead sold to &quot;Mad&quot; and released on Bigtop Records as &quot;Mad &quot;Twists&quot; Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll&quot;. There was a strong &quot;Mad&quot; tie in – besides the title, a portrait of Alfred E. Neuman was featured prominently on the cover, and &quot;(She Got A) Nose Job&quot; from the album was bound as a flexi disc into an issue of &quot;Mad&quot;. None of the material, however, referenced &quot;Mad&quot; magazine, Alfred E. Neuman, or any other &quot;Mad&quot; tropes or features, having been recorded before the sale by RCA. Other songs on the album included &quot;(Throwing The) High School Basketball Game&quot;, &quot;Please Betty Jean (Shave Your Legs)&quot;, &quot;Somebody Else&#x27;s Dandruff (On My Lover-Baby&#x27;s Shirt)&quot;. &quot;Agnes (The Teenage Russian Spy)&quot; and &quot;The Pretzel&quot; (now titled as &quot;Let&#x27;s Do The Pretzel (And End Up Like One!))&quot;.

This was followed by another Dellwoods Bigtop release, &quot;Fink Along With Mad&quot;, again with Russo and Hayes, written by Bobrick and Blagman, and tied in with &quot;Mad&quot;, in 1963. Album tracks included &quot;She Lets Me Watch Her Mom And Pop Fight&quot; which was bound as a flexi-disc into an issue of &quot;Mad&quot; (the performance credited to Mike Russo, and described by Josiah Hughes as &quot;one dark pop song&quot; since it makes light of domestic assault, with lyrics such as &quot;To see a lamp go through the window / And watch them kick and scratch and bite / I love her, I love her, oh boy how I love her / &#x27;Cause she lets me watch her mom and pop fight.&quot;)

Other songs on &quot;Fink Along With Mad&quot; included &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Make Fun of Her Moustache Again&quot;, &quot;When the Braces on our Teeth Lock&quot;, and &quot;Loving A Siamese Twin&quot;. This album also featured a song titled &quot;It&#x27;s a Gas&quot;, which punctuated an instrumental track with belches (these &quot;vocals&quot; being credited to Alfred E. Neuman), along with a saxophone break by an uncredited King Curtis). Dr. Demento featured this gaseous performance on his radio show in Los Angeles in the early 1970s. &quot;Mad&quot; included some of these tracks as plastic-laminated cardboard inserts and (later) flexi discs with their reprint &quot;Mad Specials&quot;.

&quot;Don&#x27;t Put Onions On Your Hamburger&quot; from the album was released as a single, credited to just the Dellwoods, and in 1963 the Dellwoods renamed themselves to the Dynamics and released a serious non-novelty single for Liberty Records, &quot;Chapel On A Hill&quot; backed with &quot;Conquistador&quot;.

====1970s and later====
A number of original recordings also were released in this way in the 1970s and early 1980s, such as &quot;Gall in the Family Fare&quot; (a radio play adaptation of their previously illustrated &quot;All in the Family&quot; parody), a single entitled &quot;Makin&#x27; Out&quot;, the octuple-grooved track &quot;It&#x27;s a Super Spectacular Day&quot;, which had eight possible endings, the spoken word &quot;Meet the staff&quot; insert, and a six-track, 30-minute &quot;Mad Disco&quot; EP (from the 1980 special of the same title) that included a disco version of &quot;It&#x27;s a Gas&quot;. The last turntable-playable recording &quot;Mad&quot; packaged with its magazines was &quot;A Mad Look at Graduation&quot;, in a 1982 special. A CD-ROM containing several audio tracks was included with issue No. 350 (October 1996). Rhino Records compiled a number of &quot;Mad&quot;-recorded tracks as &quot;Mad Grooves&quot; (1996).

===Stage show===
An Off-Broadway production, &quot;The Mad Show&quot;, was first staged in 1966. The show, which lasted for 871 performances during its initial run, featured sketches written by &quot;Mad&quot; regulars Stan Hart and Larry Siegel interspersed with comedic songs (one of which was written by an uncredited Stephen Sondheim). The cast album is available on CD.

===Gaming===
In 1979, &quot;Mad&quot; released a board game. &quot;The Mad Magazine Game&quot; was an absurdist version of &quot;Monopoly&quot; in which the first player to lose all his money and go bankrupt was the winner. Profusely illustrated with artwork by the magazine&#x27;s contributors, the game included a $1,329,063 bill that could not be won unless one&#x27;s name was &quot;Alfred E. Neuman&quot;. It also featured a deck of cards (called &quot;Card cards&quot;) with bizarre instructions, such as &quot;If you can jump up and stay airborne for 37 seconds, you can lose $5,000. If not, jump up and lose $500.&quot; In 1980 a second game was released: &quot;The Mad Magazine Card Game&quot; by Parker Brothers. In it, the player who first loses all their cards is declared the winner. The game is fairly similar to &quot;Uno&quot; by Mattel. Questions based on the magazine also appeared in the 1999 &quot;Trivial Pursuit: Warner Bros. Edition&quot; (which featured questions based around Time-Warner properties, including WB films and TV shows, the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;/&quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoons (and follow-up projects from Warner Bros. Animation)), as well as DC Comics, Hanna-Barbera, Cartoon Network and assorted MGM properties owned by Turner Entertainment Co. that WB had come into possession of following the 1996 Turner/Time-Warner merger.

===Film and television===
&quot;Mad&quot; lent its name in 1980 to the risque comedy &quot;Up the Academy&quot;. &quot;Up the Academy&quot; was such a commercial debacle and critical failure that &quot;Mad&quot; successfully arranged for all references to the magazine (including a cameo by Alfred E. Neuman) to be removed from future TV and video releases of the film, although these references were eventually restored on the DVD version, which was titled &quot;Mad Magazine Presents Up the Academy&quot;. 

In 1974, a &quot;Mad&quot; animated television pilot using selected material from the magazine was commissioned by ABC, but the network decided not to broadcast it. Dick DeBartolo noted, &quot;Nobody wanted to sponsor a show that made fun of products that were advertised on TV, like car manufacturers.&quot; The program was instead reworked into &quot;The Mad Magazine TV Special&quot;, which also went unbroadcast for the same reasons. The special was made by Focus Entertainment Inc., and was available for online viewing in SD quality 
until 2022, when a 2K resolution scan of a 16mm film print was released online; The print was provided by one of the special&#x27;s animators.

In the mid-1980s, Hanna-Barbera developed another potential &quot;Mad&quot; animated television series that was never broadcast.

In 1995, Fox Broadcasting Company&#x27;s &quot;Mad TV&quot; licensed the use of the magazine&#x27;s logo and characters. However, aside from short bumpers which animated existing &quot;Spy vs. Spy&quot; (1994–1998) and Don Martin (1995–2000) cartoons during the show&#x27;s first three seasons, there was no editorial or stylistic connection between the TV show and the magazine. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sketch comedy series was in the vein of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and Global/CBC&#x27;s &quot;SCTV&quot;, and ran for 14 seasons and 321 episodes. On January 12, 2016, The CW aired an hour-long special celebrating the series&#x27; 20th anniversary. A large portion of the original cast returned. An eight-episode revival featuring a brand new cast premiered on July 26, 2016.

Animated &quot;Spy vs. Spy&quot; sequences were also seen in TV ads for Mountain Dew soda in 2004.

In September 2010, Cartoon Network began airing the animated series &quot;Mad&quot;, from Warner Bros. Animation and executive producer Sam Register. Produced by Kevin Shinick and Mark Marek, the series was composed of animated shorts and sketches lampooning current television shows, films, games and other aspects of popular culture, in a similar manner to the adult stop-motion animated sketch comedy &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; (of which Shinick was formerly a writer and is currently a recurring voice actor); in fact, &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; co-creator Seth Green occasionally provided voices on &quot;Mad&quot; as well. Critics and viewers have often cited the series as a kid-friendly version of &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; . Much like &quot;Mad TV&quot;, this series also features appearances by &quot;Spy vs. Spy&quot; and Don Martin cartoons. The series ran from September 6, 2010, to December 2, 2013, lasting for four seasons and 103 episodes.

===Video games===
In 1984, the &quot;Spy vs. Spy&quot; characters were given their own video game series in which players can set traps for each other. The games were made for various computer systems such as the Atari 8-bit computers, Apple II, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Master System and Nintendo Entertainment System. Whereas the original game took place in a nondescript building, the sequels transposed the action to a desert island for &quot;Spy vs. Spy: The Island Caper&quot; and a polar setting for &quot;Spy vs. Spy: Arctic Antics&quot;.

Not to be confused with the later television show, &quot;Mad TV&quot; is a television station management simulation computer game produced in 1991 by Rainbow Arts for the Mad franchise. It was released on the PC and the Amiga. It is faithful to the magazine&#x27;s general style of cartoon humor but does not include any of the original characters except for a brief closeup of Alfred E. Neuman&#x27;s eyes during the opening screens.

Another &quot;Spy vs. Spy&quot; video game was made in 2005 for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Microsoft Windows. A &quot;Mad&quot; app was released for iPad on April 1, 2012. It displayed the contents of each new issue beginning with &quot;Mad&quot; No. 507, as well as video clips from Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;Mad&quot;, and material from the magazine&#x27;s website, &quot;The Idiotical&quot;.

===Computer software===
In 1996, &quot;Mad&quot; No. 350 included a CD-ROM featuring &quot;Mad&quot;-related software as well as three audio files. In 1999, Broderbund/The Learning Company released &quot;Totally Mad,&quot; a Microsoft Windows 95/98-compatible CD-ROM set collecting the magazine&#x27;s content from No. 1 through No. 376 (December 1998), plus over 100 &quot;Mad Specials&quot; including most of the recorded audio inserts. Despite the title, it omitted a handful of articles due to problems clearing the rights on some book excerpts and text taken from recordings, such as Andy Griffith&#x27;s &quot;What It Was, Was Football&quot;. In 2006, Graphic Imaging Technology&#x27;s DVD-ROM &quot;Absolutely Mad&quot; updated the original &quot;Totally Mad&quot; content through 2005. A single seven-gigabyte disc, it is missing the same deleted material from the 1999 collection. It differs from the earlier release in that it is Macintosh compatible.

<doc id="21111" wikidata="Q42869" url="?curid=21111" title="Nicolas Cage">
<text>Nicolas Kim Coppola (born January 7, 1964), known professionally as Nicolas Cage, is an American actor and film producer. He is the recipient of various accolades, including an Academy Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, and a Golden Globe Award as well as nominations for two BAFTA Awards. Known for his versatility as an actor, his participation in various film genres has gained him a cult following.

Born into the Coppola family, Cage began his career in films such as &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot; (1982) and &quot;Valley Girl&quot; (1983), as well as various films by his uncle Francis Ford Coppola such as &quot;Rumble Fish&quot; (1983), &quot;The Cotton Club&quot; (1984), and &quot;Peggy Sue Got Married&quot; (1986). He received critical success for his roles in &quot;Moonstruck&quot; and &quot;Raising Arizona&quot; (both 1987), before earning an Academy Award for Best Actor for the dramatic film &quot;Leaving Las Vegas&quot; (1995). He was Oscar-nominated for playing twins Charlie and Donald Kaufman in the comedy-drama film &quot;Adaptation&quot; (2002).

Cage established himself in mainstream action films, such as &quot;The Rock&quot; (1996), &quot;Con Air&quot; (1997), &quot;Face/Off&quot; (1997), &quot;Gone in 60 Seconds&quot; (2000), the &quot;National Treasure&quot; film series (2004–2007), the &quot;Ghost Rider&quot; film series (2007–2011), and &quot;Kick-Ass&quot; (2010). He also took on dramatic roles in &quot;City of Angels&quot; (1998), &quot;Bringing Out the Dead&quot; (1999), &quot;The Family Man&quot; (2000), &quot;Matchstick Men&quot; (2003), and &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; (2006). He has voiced characters in &quot;The Croods&quot; film series (2013–2020) and in &quot;Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse&quot; (2018). He earned renewed critical recognition for his starring roles in &quot;Mandy&quot; (2018), &quot;Pig&quot; (2021), &quot;The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent&quot; (2022), &quot;Dream Scenario&quot; (2023) and &quot;Longlegs&quot; (2024).

Cage owns the production company Saturn Films and has produced films such as &quot;Shadow of the Vampire&quot; (2000) and &quot;The Life of David Gale&quot; (2003), and has directed &quot;Sonny&quot; (2002). For his contributions to the film industry, he was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1998. He was ranked No. 40 in &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s The Top 100 Movie Stars of All Time list in 2007 and was placed No. 37 in &quot;Premiere&quot;″s 100 Most Powerful People in Hollywood in 2008. Nicolas Cage was also voted one of the 50 greatest actors of all time in a 2022 readers&#x27; poll by &quot;Empire&quot; magazine.

==Early life and family==
Cage was born in Long Beach, California, to August Coppola, a professor of literature, and Joy Vogelsang, a dancer and choreographer. He was raised in a Catholic family. His father was of Italian descent and his mother was of mainly German and Polish descent with some English and Scottish ancestry on her father&#x27;s side. His paternal grandparents were composer Carmine Coppola and actress Italia Pennino, and his paternal great-grandparents were immigrants from Bernalda, Basilicata. Through his father, he is a nephew of both director Francis Ford Coppola and actress Talia Shire, and a cousin of directors Roman Coppola and Sofia Coppola, film producer Gian-Carlo Coppola, and actors Robert and Jason Schwartzman.

Cage is the youngest of three sons. His two brothers are New York radio personality Marc &quot;The Cope&quot; Coppola and director Christopher Coppola. He attended Beverly Hills High School, which is known for its many alumni who became entertainers. He aspired to act from an early age and also attended UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television. His first non-cinematic acting experience was in a school production of &quot;Golden Boy&quot;. He said he started acting because he &quot;wanted to be James Dean. I saw him in &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot;, &quot;East of Eden&quot;. Nothing affected me—no rock song, no classical music—the way Dean affected me in &quot;Eden&quot;. It blew my mind. I was like, &#x27;That&#x27;s what I want to do&#x27;.&quot;

At age 15, he tried to convince his uncle, Francis Ford Coppola, to give him a screen test, telling him &quot;I&#x27;ll show you acting.&quot; His outburst was met with &quot;silence in the car.&quot; By this stage of his career, Coppola had already directed Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Gene Hackman and Robert De Niro. Although early in his career Cage appeared in some of his uncle&#x27;s films, he changed his name to Nicolas Cage to avoid the appearance of nepotism as Coppola&#x27;s nephew. His choice of name was inspired by the Marvel Comics superhero Luke Cage and composer John Cage.

==Career==
===1981–1988: Early work and breakthrough===
Cage made his acting debut in the 1981 television pilot &quot;The Best of Times&quot;, which was never picked up by ABC. His film debut followed in 1982, with a minor role as an unnamed co-worker of Judge Reinhold&#x27;s character in the coming-of-age film &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot;, having originally auditioned for Reinhold&#x27;s part. His experience on the film was marred by cast members endlessly quoting his uncle&#x27;s films, which inspired him to change his name. Cage&#x27;s first starring role came opposite Deborah Foreman in the romantic comedy &quot;Valley Girl&quot; (1983), in which he played a punk who falls in love with the titular valley girl, a plot loosely inspired by &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. The film was a modest box office success and has been branded a cult classic. He auditioned for the role of Dallas Winston in his uncle&#x27;s film &quot;The Outsiders&quot;, based on S.E. Hinton&#x27;s novel, but lost to Matt Dillon. Cage, however, would co-star in Coppola&#x27;s adaptation of another Hinton novel, &quot;Rumble Fish&quot;, in that year.

In 1984, Cage appeared in three period films, none of which fared well at the box office. In the drama, &quot;Racing with the Moon&quot; (1984), Cage featured opposite Sean Penn as friends who are awaiting deployment to the United States Marine Corps. In Coppola&#x27;s crime drama &quot;The Cotton Club&quot; he portrayed a fictionalized version of mob hitman Vincent &quot;Mad Dog&quot; Coll, earning praise from critic Paul Attanasio for &quot;artfully [using] his few moments to sketch a brawny, violent thug.&quot; His final release of the year was Alan Parker&#x27;s drama &quot;Birdy&quot;, in which he starred with Matthew Modine. Cage lost weight for the role and had two of his front teeth pulled out to appear disfigured. Despite massively underperforming at the box office, the film, and Cage and Modine&#x27;s performances, received positive reviews, with &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Janet Maslin writing, &quot;Mr. Cage very sympathetically captures Al&#x27;s urgency and frustration. Together, these actors work miracles with what might have been unplayable.&quot;

In 1986, Cage starred in the little-seen Canadian sports drama &quot;The Boy in Blue&quot; and his uncle&#x27;s fantasy comedy &quot;Peggy Sue Got Married&quot; (1986) as the husband to Kathleen Turner&#x27;s character. He then starred in the Coen brothers&#x27; crime comedy &quot;Raising Arizona&quot; (1987) as a dim-witted ex-con. Cage&#x27;s biggest breakthrough came in 1987 with the romantic comedy &quot;Moonstruck&quot;, in which he starred alongside Cher as a hot-tempered baker. The film was a hit with critics and audiences alike, earning Cage a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy In his retrospective review, Roger Ebert wrote that he felt Cage&#x27;s performance was worthy of an Oscar.

===1989–1994: Career slump===
In 1989, Cage starred in the black comedy &quot;Vampire&#x27;s Kiss&quot; as a man who falls in love with a vampire and soon begins to believe himself as a vampire. The film was a major box office flop but has developed a cult following largely due to Cage&#x27;s surrealistic and over-the-top performance appearing in internet memes. Critic Vincent Canby felt the film was &quot;dominated and destroyed by Mr. Cage&#x27;s chaotic, self-indulgent performance.&quot; After filming the Italian drama &quot;Time to Kill&quot; (1989) in Zimbabwe, he starred in David Lynch&#x27;s romantic crime film &quot;Wild at Heart&quot; (1990) with Laura Dern. Cage was drawn to the project because he was &quot;always attracted to those passionate, almost unbridled romantic characters&quot; and it allowed him to impersonate one of his heroes, Elvis Presley, in scenes in which he sung. &quot;Wild at Heart&quot; received mixed reviews upon release, despite controversially winning the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival. Cage would reunite with Lynch and Dern for the avant-garde concert performance &quot;Industrial Symphony No. 1&quot;.

Also in 1990, he starred as a helicopter pilot in the action film &quot;Fire Birds&quot;, which was panned by critics and negatively compared to &quot;Top Gun&quot; (1986). Cage&#x27;s next film, the erotic thriller &quot;Zandalee&quot; (1991), was released direct-to-video in the United States, where it did not receive a theatrical release. His &quot;goofy &#x27;everyman&#x27;&quot; performance in the romantic comedy &quot;Honeymoon in Vegas&quot; (1992) garnered some positive critical notices, including from Roger Ebert, who defended Cage amidst some critics finding his acting &quot;excessive&quot; and earned Cage his second Golden Globe nomination. He hosted an episode of the variety show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; to promote the film, his only time hosting the show.

None of Cage&#x27;s three films in 1993—&quot;Deadfall&quot; (directed by his brother Christopher), &quot;Amos &amp; Andrew&quot; and &quot;Red Rock West&quot;—performed well at the box office. The comedy &quot;Guarding Tess&quot; (1994) paired Cage with Shirley MacLaine as a Secret Service agent protecting a former First Lady; however, it was dismissed as being derivative by some critics. He next starred alongside Bridget Fonda in the romantic comedy &quot;It Could Happen to You&quot; as a cash-strapped police officer who offers to share his lottery winnings with a waitress and then the much-criticized box office flop Christmas comedy &quot;Trapped in Paradise&quot; with the &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; actors Jon Lovitz and Dana Carvey. According to Lovitz, Cage directed portions of the film because its director, George Gallo, offered little direction.

===1995–2003: Critical success and action star===
Cage&#x27;s performance as a psychopathic criminal kingpin in the crime film &quot;Kiss of Death&quot; (1995) was seen by many critics as the film&#x27;s strong point, but his most acclaimed performance yet came in the drama &quot;Leaving Las Vegas&quot; as an alcoholic screenwriter who falls in love with a prostitute in Las Vegas. The role won Cage the Academy Award for Best Actor and Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama. To prepare for the part, Cage binge drank for two weeks and studied footage of himself.

In 1996, he starred alongside Sean Connery and Ed Harris in Michael Bay&#x27;s &quot;The Rock&quot;, the first of a string of action films for Cage. In the film, he played an FBI chemical weapons specialist breaking into Alcatraz federal prison. &quot;The Rock&quot; was a box office and critical success, with journalist Alexander Larman stating the film &quot;launched Cage into an unexpected vocation as an offbeat action star.&quot; Next, he starred in &quot;Con Air&quot; and &quot;Face/Off&quot;, two commercially successful action thrillers that were both released in June 1997. Along with John Cusack and John Malkovich, Cage led an ensemble cast. Jerry Bruckheimer, &quot;Con Air&quot;&#x27;s producer, offered the role to Cage after being impressed with his performances in &quot;Leaving Las Vegas&quot; and &quot;The Rock&quot;. Cage accepted despite disappointment at not being offered the villain role. Ebert felt Cage &quot;[made] the wrong choice... by playing Cameron Poe as a slow-witted Elvis type who is very, very earnest and approaches every task with tunnel vision; it would have been more fun if he&#x27;d been less of a hayseed.&quot; John Woo&#x27;s &quot;Face/Off&quot; saw Cage and John Travolta star in dual roles as sworn enemies—a terrorist and an FBI agent—who both undergo face transplants to impersonate each other, requiring Cage and Travolta to switch characters. Both performances were praised by critics, with the BBC writing in their review &quot;Travolta and Cage invest their dual roles with physical subtleties that reflect the other actor&#x27;s character.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Face/OffBBC&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

After starring in these action films back-to-back, Cage decided to &quot;return to more serious fare&quot; in the romantic fantasy film &quot;City of Angels&quot; (1998), a loose remake of the German film &quot;Wings of Desire&quot; (1987). Critics were split on the film and Cage&#x27;s performance, with reviews ranging from describing him as &quot;endlessly resourceful&quot; and &quot;[resembling] a serial killer more than an angel.&quot; Brian De Palma&#x27;s thriller &quot;Snake Eyes&quot;, his second film of 1998, starred Cage as a corrupt detective. The film was met with mixed reviews, which were largely critical of its screenplay.

Other films included Martin Scorsese&#x27;s 1999 New York City paramedic drama &quot;Bringing Out the Dead&quot; and Ridley Scott&#x27;s 2003 black comedy crime film &quot;Matchstick Men&quot;, in which he played a con artist with obsessive–compulsive disorder. Most of Cage&#x27;s movies that have achieved financial success were in the action/adventure genre. These include &quot;The Rock&quot;, &quot;Con Air&quot;, &quot;Face/Off&quot;, and &quot;Gone in 60 Seconds&quot;, with Cage as a retired car thief. He took the lead role in the 2001 film &quot;Captain Corelli&#x27;s Mandolin&quot; and learned to play the mandolin from scratch for the part. In 2002, he was again nominated for Oscar and Golden Globe best actor awards for his portrayal of real-life screenwriter Charlie Kaufman and Kaufman&#x27;s fictional twin Donald in &quot;Adaptation.&quot; Cage made his directorial debut in 2002 with &quot;Sonny&quot;, a low-budget drama starring James Franco as a male prostitute whose mother (Brenda Blethyn) serves as his pimp. Cage had a small role in the film, which received poor reviews and a short run in a limited number of theaters. Cage&#x27;s producing career includes &quot;Shadow of the Vampire&quot;, the first effort from Saturn Films.

===2004–2011: Franchise films===

In his second-highest-grossing film to date, &quot;National Treasure&quot;, he plays an eccentric historian who goes on a dangerous adventure to find treasure hidden by the Founding Fathers of the United States. In 2005, two films he headlined, &quot;Lord of War&quot; and &quot;The Weather Man&quot;, failed to find a significant audience despite nationwide releases and good reviews for his performances. The 2006 remake of &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; was very poorly reviewed, and failed to make back its $40-million budget. In early December 2006, Cage announced at the Bahamas International Film Festival that he planned to curtail his future acting endeavors to pursue other interests. On &quot;The Dresden Files&quot; for the Sci-Fi Channel, Cage is listed as the executive producer. The much-criticized &quot;Ghost Rider&quot; (2007), based on the Marvel Comics character, fared better, earning more than $45 million (the top earner) during its opening weekend and over $208 million worldwide through the weekend ending on March 25, 2007. Also in 2007, he had a small but notable role as the Chinese criminal mastermind Dr. Fu Manchu in Rob Zombie&#x27;s fake trailer &quot;Werewolf Women of the S.S.&quot; from the B-movie double feature &quot;Grindhouse&quot; and starred in &quot;Next&quot;, which shared the concept of a glimpse into an alternate timeline with Cage&#x27;s film, &quot;The Family Man&quot; (2000).

In November 2007, Cage was spotted backstage at a &quot;Ring of Honor&quot; wrestling show in New York City researching for the lead role for &quot;The Wrestler&quot;. However, Cage dropped out of production shortly afterward because he felt that he did not have enough time to prepare for the role and director Darren Aronofsky preferred Mickey Rourke for the lead role. Rourke would go on to receive an Academy Award nomination for his performance. In an interview with /Film, Aronofsky said of Cage&#x27;s decision to leave the film that &quot;Nic was a complete gentleman, and he understood that my heart was with Mickey and he stepped aside. I have so much respect for Nic Cage as an actor and I think it really could have worked with Nic but ... you know, Nic was incredibly supportive of Mickey and he is old friends with Mickey and really wanted to help with this opportunity, so he pulled himself out of the race.&quot;

In 2008, Cage appeared as Joe, a contract killer who undergoes a change of heart while on a work outing in Bangkok, in the film &quot;Bangkok Dangerous&quot;. The film is shot by the Pang Brothers and has a distinctly South-East Asian flavor. In 2009, Cage starred in the science fiction thriller &quot;Knowing&quot;, directed by Alex Proyas. In the film, he plays an MIT professor who examines the contents of a time capsule unearthed at his son&#x27;s elementary school. Startling predictions found inside the capsule that have already come true lead him to believe that the world is going to end at the close of the week and that he and his son are somehow involved in the destruction. The film received mixed reviews but was the box office winner on its opening weekend.

Also in 2009, Cage starred in the film &quot;Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans&quot;, directed by acclaimed German director Werner Herzog. He portrayed a corrupt police officer with gambling, drug and alcohol addictions. The film was very well received by critics, holding a rating of 87% positive reviews on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes. Cage was lauded for his performance, with Michael Phillips of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; writing &quot;Herzog has found his ideal interpreter, a performer whose truth lies deep in the artifice of performance: ladies and gentlemen, Nicolas Cage, at his finest.&quot; This film reunited Cage with Eva Mendes, who played his love interest in &quot;Ghost Rider&quot;. In 2010, Cage starred in &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;, in which he played the sorcerer, and the next year, headlined the period piece &quot;Season of the Witch&quot;, as a 14th-century knight transporting a woman accused of causing the Black Plague to a monastery. In 2011, Cage reprised his role in &quot;Ghost Rider&#x27;s&quot; sequel &quot;Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance.&quot;

===2012–2017: Career setbacks===

In 2013, Cage was involved in many projects. Notable films including animated film &quot;The Croods&quot;, in which he voiced a character named Grug Crood. &quot;The Croods&quot; received positive reviews from critics and was a box-office success grossing $585 million against a budget of $135 million. He starred as main character in &quot;The Frozen Ground&quot;, a thriller crime drama film directed and written by Scott Walker in his directorial debut, based on the crimes of real-life Alaskan serial killer Robert Hansen. The film, reunited him with Cusack, depicts an Alaskan State Trooper, played by Cage, seeking to apprehend Hansen, played by Cusack, by partnering with a young woman who escaped from Hansen&#x27;s clutches. The film has received mixed reviews though Cage&#x27;s performance was cited as a highlight and solid. He also starred in &quot;Joe&quot;, an independent crime drama film directed and co-produced by David Gordon Green, adaptation from Larry Brown&#x27;s 1991 novel of the same name. In this film Nicolas Cage is a tormented man who hires a 15-year-old boy (played by Tye Sheridan) and protects him from his abusive father. The film premiered at the 70th Venice International Film Festival on August 30, 2013, with a subsequent screening at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival. It was a box office flop, grossing only $2.36 million from a $4 million budget, but received critical acclaim from critics, who praised Cage&#x27;s performance and Green&#x27;s direction.

The 2016 black comedy &quot;Dog Eat Dog&quot;, Cage&#x27;s second film with Paul Schrader, reunited him with Willem Dafoe (after &quot;Wild at Heart&quot;) as a pair of ex-convicts hired to kidnap a baby. The film had its premiere as the closing entry for the Directors&#x27; Fortnight section at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival on May 20, 2016. It was released on November 4, 2016, in the United States. Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; gave the film four out of five stars, writing, &quot;It&#x27;s the right director for the right project and the result is Schrader&#x27;s best for years: a lairy, nasty, tasty crime thriller built on black-comic chaos.&quot; Todd McCarthy of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote, &quot;A rare film to have been shot in Cleveland, &quot;Dog Eat Dog&quot; definitely looks like it was shot on the cheap but puts what it needs to up on the screen with vigor and wit.&quot;

Cage starred alongside Selma Blair and Anne Winters in Brian Taylor&#x27;s horror comedy film, &quot;Mom and Dad&quot;, which premiered in the Midnight Madness section at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival. It was released in theaters on January 19, 2018, and received positive reviews from critics, with review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes defining his performance as &quot;over-the-top.&quot; Director John Waters appreciated the film, naming &quot;Mom and Dad&quot; as one of the best movies of 2018, placing it fourth on his personal top list.

=== 2018–present: Critical resurgence ===

In 2018, Cage starred in the action thriller film &quot;Mandy&quot;, which premiered on January 19 at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival. Nick Allen of RogerEbert.com praised the movie, writing that &quot;for all of the endless feral performances that Cage has given, in movies good, bad and forgettable, Cosmatos&#x27; style-driven, &#x27;80s-tastic passion for weird worlds and characters takes full advantage of Cage&#x27;s greatness, and then some.&quot; In October, &quot;Mandy&quot;&#x27;s producer Elijah Wood announced his intention to size up an Oscar campaign for Nicolas Cage and for composer Jóhann Jóhannsson (who died in February of that year) but the film was disqualified because it was also released on Video On Demand on September 14.

Later that year, Cage voiced Clark Kent / Superman in the animated film &quot;Teen Titans Go! To the Movies&quot;. He had originally been slated to portray Superman in Tim Burton&#x27;s canceled Superman film, &quot;Superman Lives&quot;, in the 1990s. He voiced an alternate monochromatic 1930s universe version of Peter Parker / Spider-Man Noir in &quot;Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse&quot; (2018). Cage based his vocal performance on films of Humphrey Bogart, James Cagney, and Edward G. Robinson. On January 28, 2019, Viktor and Irina Yelchin premiered a documentary about their son Anton Yelchin, &quot;Love, Antosha&quot;, at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival. The documentary was directed by Garret Price and contains various interviews with some of Anton&#x27;s friends and collaborators such as Kristen Stewart, J. J. Abrams, Chris Pine, Jennifer Lawrence, Jodie Foster, John Cho and Martin Landau. Cage starred as the Narrator of the film, reading various Anton&#x27;s writings.

In December 2018, it was announced that Cage had signed to play the lead role for Richard Stanley&#x27;s &quot;Color Out of Space&quot;, based on the short story &quot;The Colour Out of Space&quot; by H. P. Lovecraft. This was Stanley&#x27;s first feature film directed since his firing from &quot;The Island of Dr. Moreau&quot; (1996). &quot;Color Out of Space&quot; premiered on September 7, 2019, in the Midnight Madness portion of the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival, where Cage was awarded for his role with the Creative Coalition&#x27;s Spotlight Initiative Award. Following select preview screenings on January 22, the film was released in 81 theaters in the United States on January 24, 2020.

In December 2018, it was announced that Sion Sono was working on his first overseas production and English-language debut, &quot;Prisoners of the Ghostland&quot;, starring Nicolas Cage. Cage said the film &quot;might be the wildest movie I&#x27;ve ever made.&quot; Its plot revolves around a notorious criminal, Hero (played by Cage), who is sent to rescue the governor&#x27;s adopted granddaughter, who has disappeared into a dark region called Ghostland. The film had its world premiere at the 2021 Sundance Film Festival on January 31, 2021.

In May 2020, it was announced that Cage would be playing the role of Joe Exotic in a scripted eight-episode &quot;Tiger King&quot; series, written and executive produced by Dan Lagana. It was announced that the project was scrapped in July 2021. In 2013, it was confirmed that Nicolas Cage would reprise his role as Grug in &quot;The Croods: A New Age&quot;, which was released in 2020.

Cage produced and starred in the 2021 film &quot;Pig&quot;, where he plays Robin &quot;Rob&quot; Feld, a former chef turned reclusive truffle-forager who must return to his past in Portland in search of his beloved foraging pig after she is kidnapped. Cage received critical acclaim for his performance and earned a second nomination for the Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Award for Best Actor. He gained further acclaim for portraying a fictionalized version of himself in the 2022 action comedy film &quot;The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent&quot; as well as for his portrayal of Paul, a professor who begins appearing in the dreams of others, in the 2023 &quot;Dream Scenario&quot;, resulting in his fifth Golden Globe nomination.

In the 2023 horror comedy film &quot;Renfield,&quot; inspired by the 1897 Bram Stoker novel &quot;Dracula&quot;, Cage portrays Dracula opposite Nicholas Hoult&#x27;s Renfield. Also in 2023, Cage was included as a playable character in the horror video game &quot;Dead by Daylight&quot;. Cage reprised his role as Clark Kent / Superman in the 2023 film &quot;The Flash&quot; in a cameo appearance as an alternate version of the superhero. Cage shot his scenes through volumetric capture and CGI was used to de-age him.

In early 2023, it was announced Cage was set to play a live action version of Peter Parker / Spider-Man Noir on Amazon Prime Video. The show would take place in an alternate 1930s New York City. In July 2024, the show was confirmed to be titled &quot;Spider-Noir&quot;. Filming began in September 2024 in Los Angeles. Also in July, Cage starred as the titular serial killer in the horror thriller film &quot;Longlegs&quot;, which he produced.

==Acting style and reception==
=== Nouveau Shamanic ===
Nouveau Shamanic is a style of acting developed by Cage. Cage has said it is to increase one&#x27;s imagination without restraint in avoidance of experiencing the sense of being ingenuous.

=== Examples ===
In the film &quot;Vampire&#x27;s Kiss&quot; Cage transforms from method acting to &quot;Nouveau Shamanic.&quot; The scene where Cage recites the alphabet to his psychiatrist was a result of acting out of impulse.

&quot;Raising Arizona&quot; showcases just how physically engaging Nouveau Shamanic can become. Not holding back proves to add to the unique effect this method has on the audience.

&quot;Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance&quot; is a display of how the Nouveau Shamanic method transcribes to the screen with impulse decisions fueled by an energy one could only garner naturally. Cage was asked if any of his numerous pets influence his acting, to which he replied &quot;The cobras, definitely. They would try to hypnotize you by going side to side, and when I did &quot;Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance&quot;, that&#x27;s something my character does before he attacks. Animals are fun places to get inspiration.&quot;

=== Reception ===
According to &quot;The Guardian&quot; film critic Luke Buckmaster, &quot;any casual observer can see that Cage is entertaining, charismatic and wildly flamboyant.&quot; Attributing it partly to the &quot;well-cultured&quot; background of Cage&#x27;s family, Buckmaster said the actor &quot;is clearly attracted to grotesque characters and is celebrated for his wild and unhinged approach to them. He has the presence of a leading man, and the eccentricities of a character actor.&quot; Actor Ethan Hawke stated in 2013 that Cage is &quot;the only actor since Marlon Brando that&#x27;s actually done anything new with the art&quot;, crediting him for taking film audiences &quot;away from an obsession with naturalism into a kind of presentation style of acting that I imagine was popular with the old troubadours.&quot;

Film director David Lynch described him as &quot;the jazz musician of American acting.&quot; Many critics have accused Cage of overacting. Others, including Cage himself, have described his intentionally extreme performances as &quot;mega-acting.&quot; After the actor&#x27;s series of mainstream-marketed thriller films during the late 1990s, Sean Penn told &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1999 that Cage was &quot;no longer an actor&quot; but &quot;more like a performer.&quot; Despite this, in his speech after winning the Oscar for his performance in &quot;Mystic River&quot;, Penn described Cage&#x27;s work (in &quot;Matchstick Men&quot;) as one of the best performances of 2003.

During the 2010s, a growing number of film critics described Cage as one of the most underrated actors of his generation.

==Acting credits and accolades==

For his contributions to the film industry, Cage was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1998 with a motion pictures star located at 7021 Hollywood Boulevard. In May 2001, Cage was awarded an Honorary Doctorate in Fine Arts by California State University, Fullerton. He spoke at the commencement ceremony. Cage has also been nominated for an Academy Award twice. He won an Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in the film &quot;Leaving Las Vegas&quot; in 1995. He was nominated for a second one for his role in the film &quot;Adaptation&quot; in 2002.

He also won a Golden Globe award, Screen Actors Guild award, and many more awards for &quot;Leaving Las Vegas&quot;. He has received nominations by the Golden Globe, Screen Actors Guild, and BAFTA for his films &quot;Adaptation&quot;, &quot;Honeymoon in Vegas&quot;, and &quot;Moonstruck.&quot; He has also won and been nominated for many other awards.

==Personal life==
===Relationships and family===
Cage has been married five times and has three children (with Fulton, Kim and Shibata).

In 1988, Cage began dating actress Christina Fulton, with whom he has a son, Weston Coppola Cage (born December 26, 1990). Weston has been involved in two black metal bands, and appeared in his father&#x27;s film &quot;Lord of War&quot; as a helicopter mechanic, and in the 2014 film &quot;Rage&quot; as Nicolas&#x27;s character younger. Through Weston, Cage has two grandsons born in 2014 and 2016. In July 2024, Weston was arrested for assaulting numerous people with a deadly weapon, including his mother; he was released on a $150,000 bond.

Cage&#x27;s first wife was actress Patricia Arquette, whom he married in April 1995 and divorced in 2001.

His second marriage was to singer-songwriter Lisa Marie Presley, daughter of Elvis and Priscilla Presley. (Cage, an Elvis fan, used Elvis as the inspiration for his performance in &quot;Wild at Heart&quot;.) They married in Kamuela, Hawaii, on August 10, 2002, and filed for divorce 107 days later on November 25, 2002. The divorce was finalized on May 24, 2004.

Cage&#x27;s third wife was Alice Kim. They were married at a private ranch in northern California on July 30, 2004. She gave birth to their son Kal-El (after Superman&#x27;s birth name) on October 3, 2005. They divorced in January 2016.

In March 2019, Cage married Erika Koike in Las Vegas, only to file for annulment four days later, stating he was too intoxicated to understand his own actions and that Koike failed to disclose &quot;the full nature and extent of her relationship with another person.&quot; He was granted a divorce from Koike three months later.

On February 16, 2021, Cage married Riko Shibata. Their daughter, August Francesca, was born on September 7, 2022.

===Political views and religious beliefs===
Cage grew up in a family of Catholic background, but does not talk about religion publicly and refuses to answer religion-connected questions in his interviews. When asked about whether he could relate to his character&#x27;s lack of religious belief in &quot;Knowing&quot;, Cage replied, &quot;You know, any of my personal beliefs or opinions run the risk of impinging on your own relationship with the movie. I think movies are best left enigmatic. Left raising more questions than answers. I don&#x27;t want to ever preach, so that&#x27;s what you get from a movie; that&#x27;s far more interesting than anything I could offer.&quot;

During his visit to University of California, Santa Cruz, he stated that he is not a politically active actor and that he can do it in his work as he learned &quot;more about nuclear power from the movie &quot;The China Syndrome&quot;.&quot; Cage endorsed Andrew Yang for president during the 2020 election.

At one point in his life, Cage had decided that he wanted to develop the philosophical aspect of his nature, and he went on a quest to find the Holy Grail. Cage traveled to England to look for it, but also looked at some areas of the United States.

===Charitable activities===
Cage has been called one of the most generous stars in Hollywood. He donated $2 million to Amnesty International for them to use to offer rehabilitation shelters, medical services and psychological and reintegration services to some of the 300,000 children forced to fight in conflicts across the world. He has also donated $1 million to the victims of Hurricane Katrina. He became the first artist to support ArtWorks, an artist engagement program to raise awareness of fundamental rights at work, including freedom from slavery and from child labor. During 2023, while filming &quot;The Surfer&quot; in Western Australia, Cage personally phoned in an AU$5,000 donation to the Channel Seven Perth Telethon.

Cage has also been honored with a Humanitarian award from the United Nations for his works and appointed as a UN ambassador for Global Justice in 2009 and again in 2013. He led a campaign around the film &quot;Lord of War&quot; to raise awareness about international arms control, supported &quot;Heal the Bay&quot;, the United Negro College Fund efforts, and the Royal United Hospital&#x27;s Forever Friends Appeal to build intensive care units for babies.

=== Interests ===
Cage, an avid comic book fan, auctioned a collection of 400 vintage comics through Heritage Auctions for over $1.6 million in 2002. In 2007, he created a comic book with his son Weston, called &quot;Voodoo Child&quot;, which was published by Virgin Comics. Cage is a fan and collector of painter and underground comic artist Robert Williams. He has written introductions for &quot;Juxtapoz&quot; magazine and purchased the painting &quot;Death on the Boards&quot;.

===Real estate and tax problems===
Cage was once considered one of Hollywood&#x27;s highest-paid actors, earning $40 million in 2009 according to &quot;Forbes&quot;, although he failed to make &quot;Forbes&quot;&#x27; Top 10 List in 2014. In 2004 he bought a property on Paradise Island, Bahamas. In May 2006, he bought a island in the Exuma archipelago, some southeast of Nassau and close to a similar island owned by Faith Hill and Tim McGraw. He bought the medieval castle Schloss Neidstein in the Oberpfalz region in Germany in 2006 and sold it in 2009 for $2.5 million. His grandmother was German, living in Cochem an der Mosel.

In August 2007, Cage purchased &quot;Grey Craig&quot;, a brick-and-stone country manor in Middletown, Rhode Island. With an estate occupying , the home has 12 bedrooms and 10 full bathrooms and overlooks the Atlantic Ocean. It borders the Norman Bird Sanctuary to the west. The sale ranked among the state of Rhode Island&#x27;s most expensive residential purchases. Also in 2007, Cage purchased Midford Castle in Somerset, England. Shortly after selling his German castle, Cage also put his homes in Rhode Island, Louisiana, Nevada, and California, as well as a $7-million island in the Bahamas, on the market.

On July 14, 2009, the Internal Revenue Service filed documents in New Orleans in connection with a federal tax lien against property owned by Cage in Louisiana, concerning unpaid federal taxes. The IRS alleged that Cage failed to pay over $6.2 million in federal income tax for the year 2007. In addition, the Internal Revenue Service had another lien for more than $350,000 in unpaid taxes dating from 2002 to 2004. Cage filed a $20-million lawsuit on October 16, 2009, against his business manager, Samuel J. Levin, alleging negligence and fraud. The lawsuit stated that Levin &quot;had failed to pay taxes when they were due and had placed [Cage] in speculative and risky real estate investments &#x27;resulting in (the actor) suffering catastrophic losses. Cage also faced separate lawsuits from East West Bank and Red Curb Investments for unpaid, multi-million dollar loans.

Samuel Levin filed a counter-complaint and responded to the lawsuit in a filing stating that he warned Cage that he was living beyond his means and urged him to spend less. Levin&#x27;s filing states that &quot;instead of listening to Levin, cross-defendant Cage (Coppola) spent most of his free time shopping for high ticket purchases, and wound up with 15 personal residences.&quot; Levin&#x27;s complaint continued: &quot;Likewise, Levin advised Coppola against buying a Gulfstream jet, against buying and owning a flotilla of yachts, against buying and owning a squadron of Rolls Royces, against buying millions of dollars in jewelry and art.&quot;

In his filing, Levin said that in 2007, Cage&#x27;s &quot;shopping spree entailed the purchase of three additional residences at a total cost of more than $33 million; the purchase of 22 automobiles (including 9 Rolls Royces), 12 purchases of expensive jewelry, and 47 purchases of artwork and exotic items.&quot; One of those items was a dinosaur skull of a &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot;. After discovering that it was stolen, he returned it to the Mongolian authorities.

According to Cage, he owned the &quot;Most Haunted House in America&quot;, a home located in the French Quarter of New Orleans, Louisiana. Known as &quot;The LaLaurie House&quot; after its former owner Delphine LaLaurie, the house was foreclosed and sold at auction on November 12, 2009, along with another New Orleans property for a total of $5.5 million, in the wake of Cage&#x27;s financial problems. His Bel Air home, which had six loans totaling $18 million on it, failed to sell at an April 2010 foreclosure auction despite an opening offer of $10.4 million, substantially less than the $35 million that Cage had originally tried to sell it for. The home, built in 1940 for $110,000 (equivalent to $ million in ), had been owned at different times by Dean Martin and singer Tom Jones.

The home eventually sold in November 2010 for $10.5 million. Another home in Nevada also faced foreclosure auction. In November 2011, Cage sold his &quot;Action Comics&quot; #1 in an online auction managed by Heritage Auctions for a record-breaking $2.16 million (the previous record being $1.5 million), to assist paying his tax liens and other debts. Cage purchased the comic in 1997 for $110,000. The comic had been stolen from him in 2000, and Cage had received an insurance payment on the item. In March 2011, it was found in a storage locker in the San Fernando Valley and was verified by ComicConnect.com to be the copy sold to Cage previously. Worth around $25 million by May 2017, Cage was reportedly &quot;taking [film] roles left and right&quot; in order to pay off his remaining debts. By 2022, Cage confirmed that he had finally paid off his debts and intended to be more selective with his film roles.

===Legal issues===
Kathleen Turner wrote in her 2008 memoir, &quot;Send Your Roses&quot;, that Cage had stolen a chihuahua and was arrested twice for driving drunk while they filmed &quot;Peggy Sue Got Married&quot;. Later she admitted Cage did not steal a chihuahua and she was sorry. Cage won a libel action against Turner, her publisher Headline Publishing Group, and Associated Newspapers (whose publication the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; had repeated the allegations when they published an excerpt from the book).

Christina Fulton sued Cage in December 2009 for $13 million and for the house in which she was living. The suit was in response to an order that she leave the dwelling; the order resulted from Cage&#x27;s financial difficulties. The case was settled in June 2011.

Cage was arrested in New Orleans&#x27; French Quarter district on April 15, 2011, for suspicion of domestic abuse battery, disturbing the peace and public intoxication. A police officer was flagged down by onlookers after Cage allegedly grabbed his wife&#x27;s upper arm while appearing to be under the influence of alcohol. Cage was held in police custody until a bail of $11,000 was posted by Duane &quot;Dog&quot; Chapman. He was later ordered to appear in court on May 31, 2011. The New Orleans District Attorney announced that the charges against Cage had been dropped on May 5, 2011.

<doc id="21113" wikidata="Q275141" url="?curid=21113" title="Napster">
<text>Napster was an American peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing application primarily associated with digital audio file distribution. Founded by Shawn Fanning and Sean Parker, the platform originally launched on June 1, 1999. Audio shared on the service was typically encoded in the MP3 format. As the software became popular, the company encountered legal difficulties over copyright infringement. Napster ceased operations in 2001 after losing multiple lawsuits and filed for bankruptcy in June 2002.

The P2P model employed by Napster involved a centralized database that indexed a complete list of all songs being shared from connected clients. While effective, the service could not function without the central database, which was hosted by Napster and eventually forced to shut down. Following Napster&#x27;s demise, alternative decentralized methods of P2P file-sharing emerged, including LimeWire, Gnutella, Freenet, FastTrack, and BitTorrent.

Napster&#x27;s assets were eventually acquired by Roxio, and it re-emerged as an online music store commonly known as Napster 2.0. Best Buy later purchased the service and merged it with its Rhapsody streaming service on December 1, 2011. In 2016, the original branding was restored when Rhapsody was renamed Napster. In 2022, the Napster streaming service was acquired by two Web3 companies, Hivemind and Algorand. Jon Vlassopulos was appointed as CEO.

==Origin==
Napster was founded by Shawn Fanning and Sean Parker. Initially, Napster was envisioned by Fanning as an independent peer-to-peer file sharing service. The service operated between June 1999 and July 2001. Its technology enabled people to easily share their MP3 files with other participants. Although the original service was shut down by court order, the Napster brand survived after the company&#x27;s assets were liquidated and purchased by other companies through bankruptcy proceedings.

==History==
Although there were already networks that facilitated the distribution of files across the Internet, such as IRC, Hotline, and Usenet, Napster specialized in MP3 files of music and had a user-friendly interface. At its peak, the Napster service had about 80 million registered users. Napster made it relatively easy for music enthusiasts to download copies of songs that were otherwise difficult to obtain, such as older songs, unreleased recordings, studio recordings, and songs from concert bootleg recordings. Napster paved the way for streaming media services and transformed music into a public good for a brief time.

High-speed networks in college dormitories became overloaded, with as much as 61% of external network traffic consisting of MP3 file transfers. Many colleges blocked its use for this reason, even before concerns about liability for facilitating copyright violations on campus.

===Macintosh version===
The service and software program began as Windows-only. However, in 2000, Black Hole Media wrote a Macintosh client called Macster. Macster was later bought by Napster and designated the official Mac Napster client (&quot;Napster for the Mac&quot;), at which point the Macster name was discontinued. Even before the acquisition of Macster, the Macintosh community had a variety of independently developed Napster clients. The most notable was the open source client called MacStar, released by Squirrel Software in early 2000, and Rapster, released by Overcaster Family in Brazil. The release of MacStar&#x27;s source code paved the way for third-party Napster clients across all computing platforms, giving users advertisement-free music distribution options.

===Legal challenges===
Heavy metal band Metallica discovered a demo of their song &quot;I Disappear&quot; had been circulating across the network before it was released. This led to it being played on several radio stations across the United States, which alerted Metallica to the fact that their entire back catalogue of studio material was also available. On April 13, 2000, they filed a lawsuit against Napster. A month later, rapper and producer Dr. Dre, who shared a litigator and legal firm with Metallica, filed a similar lawsuit after Napster refused his written request to remove his works from its service. Separately, Metallica and Dr. Dre later delivered to Napster thousands of usernames of people who they believed were pirating their songs. In March 2001, Napster settled both suits, after being shut down by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in a separate lawsuit from several major record labels (see below). In 2000, Madonna&#x27;s single &quot;Music&quot; was leaked out onto the web and Napster prior to its commercial release, causing widespread media coverage. Verified Napster use peaked with 26.4 million users worldwide in February 2001. In that same month, with a court-ordered interim shut-down imminent, Napster went public with a settlement proposal which would have paid the record labels $1 billion over the next five years, with the money coming through a subscription service.

In 2000, the American musical recording company A&amp;M Records along with several other recording companies, through the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), sued Napster (&quot;A&amp;M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc.&quot;) on grounds of contributory and vicarious copyright infringement under the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). Napster was faced with the following allegations from the music industry:

# That its users were directly violating the plaintiffs&#x27; copyrights.
# That Napster was responsible for contributory infringement of the plaintiff&#x27;s copyrights.
# That Napster was responsible for the vicarious infringement of the plaintiff&#x27;s copyrights.

Napster lost the case in the District Court but then appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Although it was clear that Napster could have commercially significant non-infringing uses, the Ninth Circuit upheld the District Court&#x27;s decision. Immediately after, the District Court commanded Napster to keep track of the activities of its network and to restrict access to infringing material when informed of that material&#x27;s location. Napster wasn&#x27;t able to comply and thus had to close down its service in July 2001. In 2002, Napster announced that it had filed for bankruptcy and sold its assets to a third party. In a 2018 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; article, Kirk Hammett of Metallica upheld the band&#x27;s opinion that suing Napster was the &quot;right&quot; thing to do.

===Promotional power===
Along with the accusations that Napster was hurting the sales of the record industry, some felt just the opposite, that file trading on Napster stimulated, rather than hurt, sales. Some evidence may have come in July 2000 when tracks from English rock band Radiohead&#x27;s album &quot;Kid A&quot; found their way to Napster three weeks before the album&#x27;s release. Unlike Madonna, Dr. Dre, or Metallica, Radiohead had never hit the top 20 in the US. Furthermore, &quot;Kid A&quot; was an album without any singles released, and received relatively little radio airplay. By the time of the album&#x27;s release, the album was estimated to have been downloaded for free by millions of people worldwide, and in October 2000 &quot;Kid A&quot; captured the number one spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 sales chart in its debut week. According to Richard Menta of &quot;MP3 Newswire&quot;, the effect of Napster in this instance was isolated from other elements that could be credited for driving sales, and the album&#x27;s unexpected success suggested that Napster was a good promotional tool for music.

Since 2000, many musical artists, particularly those not signed to major labels and without access to traditional mass media outlets such as radio and television, have said that Napster and successive Internet file-sharing networks have helped get their music heard, spread word of mouth, and may have improved their sales in the long term. One such musician to publicly defend Napster as a promotional tool for independent artists was DJ Xealot, who became directly involved in the 2000 A&amp;M Records Lawsuit. Chuck D from Public Enemy also came out and publicly supported Napster.

===Lawsuit===
Napster&#x27;s facilitation of the transfer of copyrighted material was objected to by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), which filed a lawsuit against the service on December 6, 1999. The legal action, while intended to shut down the service, brought it a great deal of publicity and an influx of millions of new users, many of whom were college students. After a failed appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court, an injunction was issued on March 5, 2001, ordering Napster to prevent the trading of copyrighted music on its network.

Lawrence Lessig claimed, however, that this decision made little sense from the perspective of copyright protection: &quot;When Napster told the district court that it had developed a technology to block the transfer of 99.4 percent of identified infringing material, the district court told counsel for Napster 99.4 percent was not good enough. Napster had to push the infringements &#x27;down to zero.&#x27; If 99.4 percent is not good enough,&quot; Lessig concluded, &quot;then this is a war on file-sharing technologies, not a war on copyright infringement.&quot;

===Shutdown===
On July 11, 2001, Napster shut down its entire network to comply with the injunction. One week later, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals temporarily overturned the order from the week before and allowed Napster to resume operations, due to Napster saying it could block all but a tiny fraction of unauthorized song-swapping. On September 24, 2001, the case was partially settled. Napster agreed to pay music creators and copyright owners a $26 million settlement for past, unauthorized uses of music, and as an advance against future licensing royalties of $10 million. To pay those fees, Napster attempted to convert its free service into a subscription system, and thus traffic to Napster was reduced. A prototype solution was tested in 2002: the Napster 3.0 Alpha, using the &quot;.nap&quot; secure file format from PlayMedia Systems and audio fingerprinting technology licensed from Relatable. Napster 3.0 was, according to many former Napster employees, ready to deploy, but it had significant trouble obtaining licenses to distribute major-label music. On May 17, 2002, Napster announced that its assets would be acquired by German media firm Bertelsmann for $85 million to transform Napster into an online music subscription service. The two companies had been collaborating since the middle of 2000 when Bertelsmann became the first major label to drop its copyright lawsuit against Napster. Pursuant to the terms of the acquisition agreement, on June 3 Napster filed for Chapter 11 protection under United States bankruptcy laws. On September 3, 2002, an American bankruptcy judge blocked the sale to Bertelsmann and forced Napster to liquidate its assets.

===Reuse of name===

Napster&#x27;s brand and logos were acquired at a bankruptcy auction by Roxio which used them to re-brand the Pressplay music service as Napster 2.0. In September 2008, Napster was purchased by US electronics retailer Best Buy for US$121 million. On December 1, 2011, pursuant to a deal with Best Buy, Napster merged with Rhapsody, with Best Buy receiving a minority stake in Rhapsody. On July 14, 2016, Rhapsody phased out the Rhapsody brand in favor of Napster and has since branded its service internationally as Napster and expanded toward other markets by providing music on-demand as a service to other brands like the iHeartRadio app and their All Access music subscription service that provides subscribers with an on-demand music experience as well as premium radio.

On August 25, 2020, Napster was sold to virtual reality concerts company MelodyVR.

On May 10, 2022, Napster was sold to Hivemind and Algorand. The investor consortium also includes ATC Management, BH Digital, G20 Ventures, SkyBridge, RSE Ventures, Arrington Capital, Borderless Capital, and others.

<text>The National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing, LLC (NASCAR) is an American auto racing sanctioning and operating company that is best known for stock car racing. It is considered to be one of the top ranked motorsports organizations in the world and is one of the largest spectator sports leagues in America. The privately owned company was founded by Bill France Sr. in 1948, and his son, Jim France, has been the CEO since August 2018. The company is headquartered in Daytona Beach, Florida. Each year, NASCAR sanctions over 1,500 races at over 100 tracks in 48 US states, as well as in Canada, Mexico, Brazil and Europe.

NASCAR, and stock car racing as a whole, traces its roots back to moonshine runners during Prohibition, who grew to compete against each other in a show of pride. This happened notably in North Carolina. In 1935, Bill France Sr. established races in Daytona Beach, with the hope that people would come to watch races and that racers would race for him, as other organizers tended to fleece the winners of their payouts. This was a success, and the series was founded in 1948. Races were held in several divisions, which eventually morphed into what is the &quot;ladder:&quot; the Cup Series at the top, the Xfinity Series second, and the Truck Series third, with smaller series spread out below. Chevrolet, Ford and Toyota compete in each series.

The vast majority of NASCAR drivers are American, but drivers from Canada, Mexico, Europe, and other places have competed. All Cup Series races are held across America. There are 36 points-paying races in a season, along with the pre-season Clash and mid-season All-Star race. NASCAR runs races primarily on ovals, including superspeedways, short tracks, and dirt tracks, but also road courses and street circuits.

Richard Petty holds the Cup Series wins record with 200. He is tied with Dale Earnhardt and Jimmie Johnson for the championship record, with seven each. Entering the 2025 season, Joey Logano is the defending Cup Series champion.

==History==

===Early stock car racing===
In the 1920s and 1930s, Daytona Beach supplanted France and Belgium as the preferred location for world land speed records. After a historic race between Ransom Olds and Alexander Winton in 1903, 15 records were set on what became the Daytona Beach Road Course between 1905 and 1935. Daytona Beach had become synonymous with fast cars in 1936. Drivers raced on a course, consisting of a stretch of beach as one straightaway, and a narrow blacktop beachfront highway, State Road A1A, as the other. The two straights were connected by two tight, deeply rutted and sand covered turns at each end.

Stock car racing in the United States has its origins in bootlegging during Prohibition, when drivers ran bootleg whiskey made primarily in the Appalachian region of the United States. Bootleggers needed to distribute their illicit products, and they typically used small, fast vehicles to better evade the police. Many of the drivers would modify their cars for speed and handling, as well as increased cargo capacity.

The repeal of Prohibition in 1933 dried up some of their business, but by then the people of the American South had developed a taste for moonshine, and a number of the drivers continued &quot;runnin&#x27; shine&quot;, this time evading the &quot;revenuers&quot; who were attempting to tax their operations. The cars continued to improve, and by the late 1940s, races featuring these cars were being run for pride and profit. These races were popular entertainment in the rural Southern United States, and they are most closely associated with the Wilkes County region of North Carolina. Most races in those days were of modified cars. Street vehicles were lightened and reinforced.

===Significant people===

====William France Sr.====
Mechanic William France Sr., moved to Daytona Beach, Florida, from Washington, D.C., in 1935 to escape the Great Depression. He was familiar with the history of the area from the land speed record attempts. France entered the 1936 Daytona event, finishing fifth. He took over running the course in 1938. He promoted a few races before World War II.

France had the notion that people would enjoy watching stock cars race. Drivers were frequently victimized by unscrupulous promoters who would leave events with all the money before drivers were paid. On December 14, 1947, France began talks with other influential racers and promoters at the Ebony Bar at the Streamline Hotel in Daytona Beach, Florida, that ended with the formation of NASCAR on February 21, 1948.

====Erwin &quot;Cannonball&quot; Baker====
The first Commissioner of NASCAR was Erwin &quot;Cannonball&quot; Baker, a former stock car, motorcycle, and open-wheel racer who competed in the Indianapolis 500 and set over one hundred land speed records. Baker earned most of his fame for his transcontinental speed runs and would prove a car&#x27;s worth by driving it from New York to Los Angeles. After his death, the famous transcontinental race the &#x27;Cannonball Run&#x27; and the film that was inspired by it were both named in his honor.
Baker is enshrined in the Automotive Hall of Fame, the Motorcycle Hall of Fame, and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame. This level of honor and success in each diverse racing association earned Baker the title of &quot;King of the Road&quot;.

====Bob &quot;Barky&quot; Barkhimer====

In the early 1950s, the United States Navy stationed Bill France Jr., at the Moffett Federal Airfield in northern California. His father asked him to look up Bob Barkhimer in San Jose, California. Barkhimer was a star of midget car racing from the World War II era, and later ran about 22 different speedways as the head of the California Stock Car Racing Association. Young Bill developed a relationship with Bob Barkhimer and his partner, Margo Burke. He went to events with them, stayed weekends with them and generally became very familiar with racing on the west coast. &quot;Barky&quot;, as he was called by his friends, journeyed to Daytona Beach and met with Bill France Sr. In the spring of 1954, NASCAR became a stock car sanctioning body on the Pacific Coast under Barky.

====Wendell Scott====

Wendell Scott was the first African-American to win a race in the Grand National Series, NASCAR&#x27;s highest level. He was posthumously inducted into the NASCAR Hall of Fame in Charlotte, North Carolina, January 30, 2015.
===Founding===
On March 8, 1936, a collection of drivers gathered at Daytona Beach, Florida. The drivers brought coupes, hardtops, convertibles, and sports cars to compete in an event to determine the fastest cars, and best drivers. Throughout the race, the heavier cars got bogged down in the sand, while the lightweight Fords navigated the ruts of the course, eventually claiming the top 6 finishes for the race. Of the 27 cars that started the event, only 10 managed to survive the ordeal, as officials halted the event short of the scheduled distance. Driver Milt Marion was declared the winner, and a young Bill France placed 5th at the end of the day.

By early 1947, Bill France saw the potential for a unified series of racing competitors. France announced the foundation of the &quot;National Championship Stock Car Circuit&quot;, otherwise known as NCSCC. France approached the American Automobile Association, or AAA, in hopes of obtaining financial backing for the venture. When the AAA declined support of the venture, France proceeded to announce a set of rules and awards for the NCSCC. France declared that the winner of the 1947 NCSCC season would receive $1000.00 (equivalent to $ in ) and a trophy. The season would begin in January 1947 at the Daytona Beach track, and conclude in Jacksonville the following December. Nearly 40 events were logged during the season, and attendance often exceeded the venue&#x27;s capacity. The competitors were paid as promised, and by the end of the season, driver Fonty Flock was declared the season champion after winning 7 events of the 24 that he entered. Bill France delivered the $1000 and 4-foot high trophy to Flock at the end of the season, along with $3000 in prize money to other drivers who competed throughout the season.
At the end of the 1947 season, Bill France announced that there would be a series of meetings held at the Streamline Hotel in Florida, beginning on December 14, 1947. At 1:00 pm, France called to order the 35 men who represented the NCSCC on the top floor of the hotel. The meeting was the first of four seminars in which France would outline his vision of an organized group of race car drivers. The name originally chosen for the series was National Stock Car Racing Association; when it was pointed out that that name was already in use by a rival sanctioning body, &quot;National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing&quot;, proposed by mechanic Red Vogt, was selected as the organization&#x27;s name.

NASCAR was founded by William France, Sr. on February 21, 1948 with the help of several other drivers of the time. The original plans for NASCAR included three distinct divisions: Modified, Roadster, and Strictly Stock. The Modified and Roadster classes were seen as more attractive to fans. It turned out that NASCAR fans wanted nothing to do with the roadsters, which fans perceived as a Northeast or Midwest series. The roadster division was quickly abandoned, while the modified division now operates as the NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour. The Strictly Stock division was put on hold as American automobile manufacturers were unable to produce family sedans quickly enough to keep up with post-World War II demand. The 1948 schedule featured 52 Modified dirt track races. The sanctioning body hosted its first event at Daytona Beach on February 15, 1948. Red Byron beat Marshall Teague in the Modified division race. Byron won the 1948 national championship. Things had changed dramatically by 1949, and the Strictly Stock division was able to debut with a exhibition in February near Miami.

The first NASCAR &quot;Strictly Stock&quot; race ever was held at Charlotte Speedway, although this is not the same track as the Charlotte Motor Speedway that is a fixture on current NASCAR schedule. The race was held on June 19, 1949 and won by driver Jim Roper when Glenn Dunaway was disqualified after the discovery of his altered rear springs. Initially, the cars were known as the &quot;Strictly Stock Division&quot; and raced with virtually no modifications on the factory models. This division was renamed the &quot;Grand National&quot; division beginning in the 1950 season. Over a period of more than a decade, modifications for both safety and performance were allowed, and by the mid-1960s, the vehicles were purpose-built race cars with a stock-appearing body.

Early in NASCAR&#x27;s history, foreign manufacturers had shown interest in entering the series; the British car manufacturer, MG, found a few of its vehicles entered, with some placing. For example, on August 16, 1963 in the International 200, Smokey Cook drove an MG to a 17th-place finish.

The first NASCAR competition held outside the US was in Canada, where on July 1, 1952, Buddy Shuman won a 200-lap race on a half-mile (800 m) dirt track in Stamford Park, Ontario, near Niagara Falls.

==Sanctioned series==

===National series===

====Cup Series====
The NASCAR Cup Series (NCS) is the sport&#x27;s highest level of professional competition. It is consequently the most popular and most profitable NASCAR series. Since 2001, the Cup Series season has consisted of 36 races over 10 months. Writers and fans often use &quot;Cup&quot; to refer to the NCS and the ambiguous use of &quot;NASCAR&quot; as a synonym for the series is common. The 2024 NCS Champion is Joey Logano. The record for most championships is 7, held by three drivers: Richard Petty, Dale Earnhardt, and Jimmie Johnson. Johnson has the record for most consecutive with five consecutive Cup Series drivers&#x27; championships from 2006 to 2010. Previously, the most consecutive championships had been three in a row by Cale Yarborough in the late 1970s, the only other time when a driver has won three or more NASCAR Cup Series championships in a row.

The Cup Series had its first title sponsor in 1972. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, which had been banned from television advertising, found a popular and demographically suitable consumer base in NASCAR fans and engaged NASCAR as a promotional outlet. As a result of that sponsorship, the Grand National Series became known as the Winston Cup Series starting in 1971, with a new points system and some significant cash benefits to compete for championship points. In 1972, the season was shortened from 48 races (including two on dirt tracks) to 31. 1972 is often acknowledged as the beginning of NASCAR&#x27;s &quot;modern era&quot;. The next competitive level, called Late Model Sportsman, gained the &quot;Grand National&quot; title passed down from the top division and soon found a sponsor in Busch Beer.
In 2004, Nextel Communications took over sponsorship of the premier series, and formally renamed it the Nextel Cup Series. A new championship points system, the &quot;Chase for the Nextel Cup&quot;, (renamed &quot;Chase for the Sprint Cup&quot; in 2008) was also developed, which reset the point standings with ten races to go, making only drivers in the top ten or within 400 points of the leader eligible to win the championship. In 2007, NASCAR announced it was expanding &quot;The Chase&quot; from ten to twelve drivers, eliminating the 400-point cutoff, and giving a ten-point bonus to the top twelve drivers for each of the races they have won out of the first 26. Wins throughout the season would also be awarded five more points than in previous seasons. In 2008, the premier series title name became the Sprint Cup Series, as part of the merger between Nextel and Sprint.

In 2011, NASCAR announced a number of major rules changes, the most significant being abandoning the points system. The winner of a race now receives 43 points, with one-point decrements for each subsequent position (42 for second, 41 for third, and so on). The winner also receives 3 bonus points, and single bonus points are awarded to all drivers who lead a lap, plus the driver who leads the most laps. Another significant change involves the qualifying process for the Chase. The number of qualifying drivers will remain at 12, but only the top 10 will qualify solely on regular-season points. The remaining two Chase drivers will be the two drivers in the next 10 of the point standings (11th through 20th) with the most race wins in the regular season.

In 2014, NASCAR announced another revamp to the Chase format, expanding the Chase pool to 16 drivers, and eliminating four drivers after every three races, leaving four drivers to compete for the championship at the season finale at Homestead. In addition, wins were given an increased emphasis, with the 16 drivers with the most wins (15 if the points leader is winless; points leader will receive an automatic berth) gaining a spot in the chase. If there are fewer than 16 winners, the remaining spots will be filled based on the conventional points system.

Monster Energy became the title sponsor in 2017, which changed the series&#x27; name to Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series. With Monster Energy&#x27;s title sponsorship, NASCAR also abandoned &quot;The Chase&quot; name and now refers to the last 10 races simply as &quot;the playoffs&quot; similar to most other sports.

After the 2019 season, NASCAR declined an offer from Monster Energy to remain the title sponsor of the top series. On December 5, NASCAR revealed their new sponsorship model. Instead of a singular title sponsor, four &quot;premier partners&quot; (Coca-Cola, Xfinity, Busch Beer and GEICO) would be closely affiliated with the top series, which was simply renamed the NASCAR Cup Series.

====Xfinity Series====
The NASCAR Xfinity Series is the second-highest level of professional competition in NASCAR. The most recent series champion is Justin Allgaier in 2024. The modern incarnation of this series began in 1982, with sponsorship by Anheuser-Busch Brewing&#x27;s Budweiser brand. In 1984 it was renamed to the Busch Grand National Series, then later just the Busch Series. The Anheuser-Busch sponsorship expired at the end of 2007, being replaced by Nationwide Insurance from 2008 to 2014, and the series is now sponsored by Comcast through its Xfinity brand.

The season usually has fewer races than the Cup Series, and the prize money is significantly lower. However, over the last several years, a number of Cup Series drivers have run both the Xfinity and Cup Series events each weekend, using the Xfinity race as a warm-up to the Cup event at the same facility. Furthermore, several drivers not only participated in both Cup and Busch/Nationwide/Xfinity events on the same weekend but also began to compete in both series on a full-time basis. Kevin Harvick was the first Cup series driver to compete full-time in the Busch Series and win a title, actually doing so twice; in 2001, he did this for Richard Childress Racing but only did so out of necessity as Dale Earnhardt&#x27;s death forced him into the Cup series ahead of RCR&#x27;s intended schedule for him. His win in 2006, where he raced three cars for RCR and his race team, was the first of five consecutive titles in NBS/NNS that were won by Cup series regulars.
The practice received criticism because it was thought to give the Cup Series teams an unfair advantage, and that the presence of the Cup Series drivers squeezes out Nationwide Series competitors who would otherwise be able to qualify. These dual-series drivers have been labeled &quot;Buschwhackers&quot;, a play on words which combines the original series sponsor&#x27;s name with the notion of being bushwhacked. In May 2007, NNS director Joe Balash confirmed that NASCAR was exploring options to deal with the Buschwhacker controversy. One of the most often-cited proposals was for Cup Series drivers participating in the Nationwide Series to receive no points for their participation in a Nationwide race. In 2007, NASCAR chairman Brian France indicated that all options, except an outright ban of Cup competitors, were still being considered. On January 11, 2011, &quot;NASCAR.com&quot; reported that beginning with the 2011 season, drivers would be allowed to compete for the championship in only one of NASCAR&#x27;s three national series in a given season, although they could continue to run in multiple series. This change was officially confirmed by France in a press conference less than two weeks later, and has remained in the NASCAR rules ever since.

Beginning in 2010, the Nationwide cars adapted somewhat to the current &quot;Car of Tomorrow&quot; (or COT) design used by Cup cars, with different bodies from the Cup Series.

In 2016, the Chase format was extended to both the Xfinity and Truck Series. Instead of the four-round, 10-race format used in the Cup Series, the Chase in each of the two supporting series consists of three rounds and seven races in all, with each preliminary round consisting of three races. The Xfinity Series Chase involves 12 drivers instead of the 16 participating in the Cup Series Chase. Four drivers are eliminated at the end of each preliminary round of the Chase in the Xfinity Series, which also mirrors the Cup Series Chase. This means that four drivers are eligible for the series title entering the final race, as in the Cup Series. Similar to Cup, starting in 2017 &quot;The Chase&quot; moniker was dropped and the final seven races are now referred to as the Xfinity Playoffs.

Even with restrictions limiting points earnings to one national series, Cup drivers were still running and winning a vast majority of Xfinity series races through 2015. Starting with the 2015 season finale, NASCAR began to add additional restrictions in regards to Cup drivers running Xfinity races. Beginning in the 2020 season, Cup drivers with more than three years of experience in the top series were limited to five races per season. Furthermore, those same drivers are ineligible to run the regular season finale, NXS playoff races, or Dash 4 Cash races.

====Craftsman Truck Series====


The NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series features modified pickup trucks. It is one of the three national divisions of NASCAR, together with the Xfinity and Cup Series. The most recent series champion is Ty Majeski in 2024.

In 1994, NASCAR announced the formation of the NASCAR SuperTruck Series presented by Craftsman. The first series race followed in 1995. In 1996, the series was renamed the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series to emphasize Craftsman&#x27;s involvement. The series was first considered something of an oddity or a &quot;senior tour&quot; for NASCAR drivers, but eventually grew in popularity and has seen drivers move straight to the Cup Series without running a full season in NASCAR Xfinity Series competition. These include Kurt Busch and Carl Edwards (who both ran for Roush Racing). In addition, veteran drivers who have had only moderate success at the other two levels of the sport have revitalized their careers in the truck series, including Ron Hornaday Jr., Todd Bodine, Mike Skinner, and Johnny Benson.

Beginning in 2009, the series became the Camping World Truck Series. In 2019, per a branding request made by Camping World, the series was rebranded as the NASCAR Gander Outdoors Truck Series.

As noted previously, the Chase format was extended to the Truck Series in 2016. The format is identical to that used in the Xfinity Series, except that only eight drivers qualify for the Chase (instead of 12 in the Xfinity Series) and only two drivers are eliminated at the end of each preliminary round (instead of four in the Xfinity Series). As in both the Cup Series and Xfinity Series, four drivers are eligible for the series title entering the final race. Similar to Cup, starting in 2017 &quot;The Chase&quot; moniker was dropped and is now simply referred to as the Truck Series Playoffs.

On May 8, 2018, NASCAR and Camping World announced the Truck Series title sponsor would be moved to Camping World subsidiary Gander Outdoors starting in 2019. The contract through 2022 is scheduled to continue as planned. The series was renamed again in 2020 to the NASCAR Gander RV &amp; Outdoors Truck Series before returning to the Camping World Truck Series name in 2021.

On August 26, 2022 it was announced that the original series&#x27; sponsor, Craftsman, would return as the title sponsor starting in the 2023 season.

====ARCA Menards Series====

The ARCA Menards Series is a racing series that races at big touring series tracks and local racing series tracks. It is primarily a Midwestern United States series. NASCAR acquired the series on April 27, 2018 after being privately owned for 60 years.

===International series===

====Canada Series====
The NASCAR Canada Series is a NASCAR racing series in Canada that derives from the old CASCAR Super Series (founded in 1981 and bought out by NASCAR in 2006). The new series has races through six of Canada&#x27;s provinces for a total of 13 events with TV coverage on TSN. Many drivers are content running in Canada while others move up to bigger NASCAR series including J. R. Fitzpatrick and D. J. Kennington. The cars are a bit different from the cars seen in America, being more akin to a late model, though steel tube-framed silhouette bodies powered by V8 engines is still the norm.

====Mexico Series====
In December 2006, NASCAR also announced the creation of a new series in Mexico, the NASCAR Corona Series (now Mexico Series), replacing the existing Desafío Corona Series, to begin in 2007.
In 2004, NASCAR also began to sanction a mini stock racing series in Mexico, known as the Mexico T4 Series.

====Euro Series====
In early 2012, NASCAR announced that it would sanction the existing European-based Racecar Euro Series as a &quot;NASCAR Touring Series&quot;. On July 1, 2013, with partnership from NASCAR Whelen Engineering, the series was renamed the NASCAR Whelen Euro Series.

====Brasil Series====

Launched in 2012 as the Sprint Race series, in 2023 the series received NASCAR sanctioning and technical assistance, becoming the newest of the NASCAR international series.

===Regional racing series===
In addition to the six main national series, NASCAR operates several other racing divisions under the NASCAR Regional banner.

====Weekly Series====
Many local race tracks across the United States and Canada run under the NASCAR Advance Auto Parts Weekly Series banner, where local drivers are compared against each other in a formula where the best local track champion of the nation wins the Whelen All-American Weekly Series National Championship. The Whelen All-American series is split into four car divisions as well as state and track championships separately. Each division champion receives a point-fund money payout and even more goes to the National champion (driver with most points out of the four division winners). The Whelen All-American Series is the base for stock car racing, developing NASCAR names such as Clint Bowyer, Jimmy Spencer, Tony Stewart, the Bodine brothers, and many others along the way.

====Whelen Modified Tour====
The Whelen Modified Tour races open-wheel &quot;modified&quot; cars in Northern and Southern divisions. This is NASCAR&#x27;s oldest division, and the modern division has been operating since 1985 as the Winston Modified Series and later in 1994 as the Featherlite Trailers Modified Series.

====ARCA Menards Series East and West====
The ARCA Menards Series&#x27; feeder divisions, which consists of East and West divisions, race pro-stock cars that are similar to older Xfinity Series cars, although they are less powerful. The east division was originally divided into the Busch North series, which raced in Northeastern states, and the Busch East Series, which raced throughout Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic states. The west division was originally known as the Winston West Series and raced throughout Southwestern and Coastal Pacific states. In 2008, the series came together in east and west divisions under sponsorship from Camping World as the Camping World Series. K&amp;N Filters took over the sponsorship in 2010. 2019 was the last season for both of the series before they are to go under the ARCA banner in 2020 as part of the unification of the NASCAR K&amp;N Pro Series East and West and the ARCA Menards Series. The series became known as the ARCA Menards Series East and ARCA Menards Series West starting in 2020, meaning 2019 was also K&amp;N&#x27;s last year as the series title sponsor.

====AutoZone Elite and other divisions====

In the past, NASCAR also sanctioned the AutoZone Elite Division, which raced late-model cars that were lighter and less powerful than Cup Series cars, and was originally split into four divisions: Northwest, Southwest, Southeast, and Midwest. At the end of 2005, NASCAR announced that the AutoZone Elite Division would be discontinued after the 2006 season due to having trouble securing NASCAR-sanctioned tracks to successfully host AutoZone Elite Division events, plus escalating costs of competing and downsizing of the Division in recent years. In 2003, NASCAR standardized rules for its AutoZone Elite and Grand National divisions regional touring series as to permit cars in one series to race against cars in another series in the same division. The top 15 (Grand National) or 10 (AutoZone Elite) in each series will race in a one-race playoff, called the NASCAR Toyota All-Star Showdown, to determine the annual AutoZone Elite and Grand National champions. This event has been hosted at Irwindale Speedway in California since its inception.

Many drivers move up through the series before reaching the Cup Series. In 2002, over 9,000 drivers had licenses from NASCAR to race at all levels.

The winners of the All-American Series National Championship, the ARCA Menards Series, ARCA East and ARCA West championships, the Whelen Modified and Grand National Divisions, and the three national series are invited to Las Vegas in December to participate in Champions Week ceremonies.

===Online racing series===

====eNASCAR Coca-Cola iRacing Series====
In 2010, NASCAR officially sanctioned its first sim racing esports series, partnering with &quot;iRacing&quot; to form the NASCAR iRacing.com Series. This sim racing series is made of up of five &quot;Amateur Series&quot; divisions, the NASCAR iRacing.com Pro Series, and the PEAK Antifreeze NASCAR iRacing Series (NPAiS), one of iRacing&#x27;s World Championship Series. Each year, the champion of the NASCAR iRacing.com World Championship Series is invited to NASCAR&#x27;s Championship Weekend at Homestead–Miami Speedway to receive $10,500 prize money and NASCAR championship trophy at the track.

In 2018, &quot;iRacing&quot; announced a new, sanctioned qualifying ladder system for the NPAiS, the Road to Pro Series, using virtual Chevrolet and Toyota Camping World Trucks. At the same time, the NASCAR iRacing Pro Series would switch to using the Xfinity Series Camaro, Mustang and Camry models, to replicate the progression to the real life Cup series cars used in the NPAiS.

In 2020, Coca-Cola became the entitlement sponsor of the series and it was renamed the eNASCAR Coca-Cola iRacing Series. With the sponsorship, the prize pool increased to $300,000. Additionally, six races will be televised on NBCSN.

====eNASCAR Ignite Series====
The series was created as a developmental league by NASCAR and &quot;iRacing&quot; for aspiring gamers ages 13–16. The simulator begins with US Legends cars before moving to Modified Tour cars.

==Driver safety==

NASCAR has often implemented safety measures reactively in response to injuries or fatalities. Fire-retardant driver suits were required after the death of Fireball Roberts, who died from complications of burns suffered in a crash when flames engulfed his car during a Charlotte race. After the deaths of Adam Petty, Kenny Irwin and Tony Roper in 2000 and Dale Earnhardt in 2001, NASCAR revisited the idea of decreasing the G-forces a driver sustained during a crash. The &quot;kill switch&quot; throttle, was mandated after the death of Adam Petty, along with the requirements of an anti-spill bladder in fuel cells. The impact-absorbing &quot;SAFER Barrier&quot; had been in use as early as 1998, but NASCAR hesitated to install those walls out of concerns that they may bring about unintended consequences of aggravating the crashes, and possibly because of the effort needed to clean up the debris from the damaged walls. Dale Earnhardt fatally suffered a fracture to the base of his skull after his car slammed into the concrete wall in the 2001 Daytona 500. Earnhardt&#x27;s death prompted NASCAR to implement the SAFER barrier and consider drastic improvements to the safety of the drivers. One of these would require all drivers to use the &quot;HANS device&quot; (Head And Neck Support Device), a device that keeps the driver&#x27;s neck from going forward in a wreck. The mandate came about in October after Blaise Alexander, racing for the ARCA series, died in a crash that resulted in the same injuries sustained as Earnhardt. NASCAR redesigned the racing vehicle with safety improvements, calling it the Car of Tomorrow, which debuted in 2007. The car had a higher roof, wider cockpit, and the driver seat was located more toward the center of the vehicle.

The death of Dale Earnhardt has been seen as a &quot;wake-up&quot; call for NASCAR. NASCAR has been far more aggressive with safety changes since Earnhardt&#x27;s death, and , no NASCAR driver has been involved in a fatal accident since.

==Criticism==
NASCAR has been the target of criticism on various topics from various sources. Some critics note the significant differences between today&#x27;s NASCAR vehicles and true &quot;stock&quot; cars. Others frequently cite the dominance of the France family in NASCAR&#x27;s business structure, policies, and decision making. Recently, the increased number of Cup drivers competing consistently in the Xfinity Series races has been hotly debated. Another general area of criticism, not only of NASCAR but other motorsports as well, includes questions about fuel consumption, emissions and pollution, and the use of lead additives in the gasoline. Originally scheduled for 2008, NASCAR adopted the use of unleaded fuel in all three of its top series in 2007. In 2011, NASCAR switched to E15 &quot;green&quot; fuel (15% ethanol and 85% gasoline) for all three touring series.

As NASCAR has made moves to improve its national appeal, it has begun racing at new tracks, and ceased racing at some traditional ones – a sore spot for the traditional fan base. Most recently, NASCAR has been challenged on the types and frequency of Caution Flags, with some critics suggesting the outcome of races is being manipulated, and that the intention is not safety, as NASCAR claims, but closer racing.
There have been a few accidents involving fans during races and even some off the tracks, but no spectator has ever been killed during a race in an accident relating to the race, although a fan was killed by a lightning strike in 2012 after the 2012 Pennsylvania 400 at Pocono was called short due to the storm. It was revealed in 2008 that a wrongful death lawsuit against NASCAR stemming from the crash of a company plane was settled for $2.4 million.

For years, NASCAR had been under criticism for allowing the Confederate flag to be flown during races. Former chairman Brian France tried to ban the flying of Confederate flags at race tracks in 2015, which caused anger among fans. It had previously asked fans to voluntarily stop flying the flag after the 2015 Charleston church shooting, but this did not end the practice. Bubba Wallace, the only African-American NASCAR top-circuit driver, drove the 2020 spring Martinsville race in a car with Black Lives Matter livery, and appeared in an anti-racism video with a number of white drivers. On June 10, 2020, in the wake of protests related to the murder of George Floyd, NASCAR announced that the display of the Confederate flag will be prohibited from all of its events and properties.

In February 2022, the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in a lawsuit against Bitconnect that the Securities Act of 1933 extends to targeted solicitation using social media. In April 2022, a class-action lawsuit was filed in Florida against the LGBcoin cryptocurrency company, NASCAR, stock car racing driver Brandon Brown, and political commentator Candace Owens alleging that the defendants made false or misleading statements about the LGBcoin and that the founders of the company had engaged in a pump and dump scheme.

==Global expansion==
In 2006, Toyota announced they would be joining NASCAR&#x27;s ranks. Toyota generated early success winning several races off performances from Denny Hamlin and Kyle Busch. Any increase in foreign competition is expected to raise the price of putting a car on the track.

Another topic on the NASCAR circuit is the increase in foreign born drivers and the effects they may have on the future of NASCAR. Juan Pablo Montoya, Patrick Carpentier, Dario Franchitti, Kimi Räikkönen, and Jenson Button are among the foreign-born big names who have crossed over from Formula One and the Indy car circuit. These drivers have made an impact on NASCAR not only by winning races and dominating road courses, but by expanding NASCAR&#x27;s point of view.

NASCAR included a race at the Mexican road course Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez in the Nationwide Series schedule from 2005 through 2008, as well as a race in Montreal, Canada at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve from 2007 through 2012, with the Camping World Truck Series adding a date at Canadian Tire Motorsport Park in 2013. There has been talk of possible expansion with exhibition races in Japan and a return to Canada.

Expanding into international markets could increase NASCAR&#x27;s popularity and allow foreign sponsors and manufacturers to get involved in the sport. Some think this could be a very positive move for NASCAR, which has seen its television ratings drop 21 percent between 2005 and 2007. During the same 2-year period, NASCAR also saw the greatest drop in tickets prices observed in over a decade. In 2010, NASCAR saw television ratings drop 10% from the year before, which was down 33% off its peak in 2005. Some think that an increase in international diversity would translate into growth and generate greater opportunities for NASCAR fans.

In 2023, to celebrate their 75th anniversary, NASCAR partnered with Chevrolet and Hendrick Motorsports to enter a Next Gen Camaro ZL1 in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. It coincided with the 100th anniversary of the prestigious endurance race at the Circuit de la Sarthe in Le Mans, Sarthe, France, and the Camaro entered as a Garage 56 (Innovative) entry. Jimmie Johnson and Button were joined by German WEC veteran and Mike Rockenfeller – a 2010 LMP1 category and overall winner at Le Mans – as the drivers. Chad Knaus, Johnson&#x27;s crew chief during each of his Cup Series championships, was project manager, while the car bore #24 in honor of Jeff Gordon.

==NASCAR.com==
In October 2000, Turner Sports acquired the digital rights to NASCAR, and subsequently took over its website, which features news, information, and interactive features (such as &quot;RaceView&quot; and &quot;RaceBuddy&quot;) surrounding its series. While NASCAR had extended Turner&#x27;s contract to operate the site through 2016, the association announced in January 2012 that it would take operation of the site back in-house in 2013. As a result, a new NASCAR.com was launched on January 3, 2013, which features a multimedia-oriented design enhanced to provide a higher level of fan interaction, and provide an improved second screen experience for viewers on mobile devices.

On May 7, 2019, NASCAR announced a sports betting content partnership with The Action Network to provide editorial content and analysis to NASCAR.com, including recommended picks and value bets. NASCAR said the partnership was intended to prepare for the spread of legal sports betting in the U.S. following the 2018 U.S. Supreme Court ruling overturning the federal PASPA sports betting prohibition. NASCAR previously struck an exclusive deal with sports data solutions provider Genius Sports to develop an official NASCAR gaming offering for legal sportsbooks.

==Subsidiaries and sister organizations==

===NASCAR Digital Media===
NASCAR Digital Media is a television production company located in Charlotte, North Carolina, United States. The company is a subsidiary of NASCAR and produces programs designed to promote the sport of professional stock car racing. It also manages the NASCAR website, as well as some websites related to the sport such as Racing-Reference and Jayski&#x27;s Silly Season Site (as of 2019, after ESPN.com stopped hosting the website). They also own &quot;NASCAR Classics&quot;, a free online base of classic NASCAR races.

=== NASCAR Studios ===
NASCAR Studios is a production company that produces content including drivers, teams, partners, sponsors, and tracks. Current content includes podcast, documentaries, television shows, and films. The studio will also produce content for the NASCAR Channel on Tubi beginning in 2025.

===Tracks owned and/or operated by NASCAR===
=== ARCA ===
The Automobile Racing Club of America was purchased by NASCAR in 2018.

===Grand-Am===
The Grand American Road Racing Association (Grand-Am) was a sanctioning body of sports car racing. While it was founded independently of NASCAR by several members of the France family, NASCAR took over Grand-Am, but allowed it to operate autonomously. The series merged with the American Le Mans Series in 2014 as a part of NASCAR&#x27;s purchase of IMSA.

===IMSA===
===Education===
NASCAR Technical Institute located in Mooresville, North Carolina, is the country&#x27;s first technical training school to combine a complete automotive technology program and a NASCAR-specific motor sports program, and is the exclusive educational partner of NASCAR.

NASCAR Kinetics was established in 2009 with the mission of connecting college students nationwide to NASCAR, and mentored its last round of students in 2013.

===International Speedway Corporation (defunct)===

International Speedway Corporation (ISC) was founded by Bill France Sr. in 1953 to construct and manage tracks at which NASCAR holds competitions. In May 2019, NASCAR announced that it would purchase ISC, including its 12 tracks, for 2 billion dollars. On October 18, 2019, the acquisition was completed. ISC was subsequently folded into NASCAR.

==NASCAR in culture==
Movies about NASCAR racing include &quot;Days of Thunder&quot; (1990), &quot;&quot; (2005), &quot;Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby&quot; (2006), &quot;Ta Ra Rum Pum&quot; (2007), and &quot;Logan Lucky&quot; (2017).

NASCAR racing heavily influenced Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Cars&quot; franchise, with the third film in particular drawing inspiration from NASCAR&#x27;s history.

NASCAR drivers have made appearances in many television series and TV movies, including &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot;, &quot;Sullivan &amp; Son&quot;, and &quot;Last Man Standing&quot;.

NASCAR partnered up with popular &quot;Roblox&quot; game &quot;Jailbreak&quot;, and the partnership was launched on November 5, 2021. NASCAR also partnered with the developers of Jailbreak to launch &quot;NASCAR Speed Hub&quot; to celebrate NASCAR&#x27;s 75th Anniversary.

<text>A neuron, neurone, or nerve cell is an excitable cell that fires electric signals called action potentials across a neural network in the nervous system. They are located in the brain and spinal cord and help to receive and conduct impulses. Neurons communicate with other cells via synapses, which are specialized connections that commonly use minute amounts of chemical neurotransmitters to pass the electric signal from the presynaptic neuron to the target cell through the synaptic gap.

Neurons are the main components of nervous tissue in all animals except sponges and placozoans. Plants and fungi do not have nerve cells. Molecular evidence suggests that the ability to generate electric signals first appeared in evolution some 700 to 800 million years ago, during the Tonian period. Predecessors of neurons were the peptidergic secretory cells. They eventually gained new gene modules which enabled cells to create post-synaptic scaffolds and ion channels that generate fast electrical signals. The ability to generate electric signals was a key innovation in the evolution of the nervous system.

Neurons are typically classified into three types based on their function. Sensory neurons respond to stimuli such as touch, sound, or light that affect the cells of the sensory organs, and they send signals to the spinal cord or brain. Motor neurons receive signals from the brain and spinal cord to control everything from muscle contractions to glandular output. Interneurons connect neurons to other neurons within the same region of the brain or spinal cord. When multiple neurons are functionally connected together, they form what is called a neural circuit.

A neuron contains all the structures of other cells such as a nucleus, mitochondria, and Golgi bodies but has additional unique structures such as an axon, and dendrites. The soma is a compact structure, and the axon and dendrites are filaments extruding from the soma. Dendrites typically branch profusely and extend a few hundred micrometers from the soma. The axon leaves the soma at a swelling called the axon hillock and travels for as far as 1 meter in humans or more in other species. It branches but usually maintains a constant diameter. At the farthest tip of the axon&#x27;s branches are axon terminals, where the neuron can transmit a signal across the synapse to another cell. Neurons may lack dendrites or have no axons. The term neurite is used to describe either a dendrite or an axon, particularly when the cell is undifferentiated.

Most neurons receive signals via the dendrites and soma and send out signals down the axon. At the majority of synapses, signals cross from the axon of one neuron to the dendrite of another. However, synapses can connect an axon to another axon or a dendrite to another dendrite. The signaling process is partly electrical and partly chemical. Neurons are electrically excitable, due to the maintenance of voltage gradients across their membranes. If the voltage changes by a large enough amount over a short interval, the neuron generates an all-or-nothing electrochemical pulse called an action potential. This potential travels rapidly along the axon and activates synaptic connections as it reaches them. Synaptic signals may be excitatory or inhibitory, increasing or reducing the net voltage that reaches the soma.

In most cases, neurons are generated by neural stem cells during brain development and childhood. Neurogenesis largely ceases during adulthood in most areas of the brain.

== Nervous system ==

Neurons are the primary components of the nervous system, along with the glial cells that give them structural and metabolic support. The nervous system is made up of the central nervous system, which includes the brain and spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system, which includes the autonomic, enteric and somatic nervous systems. In vertebrates, the majority of neurons belong to the central nervous system, but some reside in peripheral ganglia, and many sensory neurons are situated in sensory organs such as the retina and cochlea.

Axons may bundle into nerve fascicles that make up the nerves in the peripheral nervous system (like strands of wire that make up a cable). In the central nervous system bundles of axons are called nerve tracts.

== Anatomy and histology ==

Neurons are highly specialized for the processing and transmission of cellular signals. Given the diversity of functions performed in different parts of the nervous system, there is a wide variety in their shape, size, and electrochemical properties. For instance, the soma of a neuron can vary from 4 to 100 micrometers in diameter.
* The soma is the body of the neuron. As it contains the nucleus, most protein synthesis occurs here. The nucleus can range from 3 to 18 micrometers in diameter.
* The dendrites of a neuron are cellular extensions with many branches. This overall shape and structure are referred to metaphorically as a dendritic tree. This is where the majority of input to the neuron occurs via the dendritic spine.
* The axon is a finer, cable-like projection that can extend tens, hundreds, or even tens of thousands of times the diameter of the soma in length. The axon primarily carries nerve signals away from the soma and carries some types of information back to it. Many neurons have only one axon, but this axon may—and usually will—undergo extensive branching, enabling communication with many target cells. The part of the axon where it emerges from the soma is called the axon hillock. Besides being an anatomical structure, the axon hillock also has the greatest density of voltage-dependent sodium channels. This makes it the most easily excited part of the neuron and the spike initiation zone for the axon. In electrophysiological terms, it has the most negative threshold potential.
** While the axon and axon hillock are generally involved in information outflow, this region can also receive input from other neurons.
* The axon terminal is found at the end of the axon farthest from the soma and contains synapses. Synaptic boutons are specialized structures where neurotransmitter chemicals are released to communicate with target neurons. In addition to synaptic boutons at the axon terminal, a neuron may have en passant boutons, which are located along the length of the axon.

The accepted view of the neuron attributes dedicated functions to its various anatomical components; however, dendrites and axons often act in ways contrary to their so-called main function.


Axons and dendrites in the central nervous system are typically only about one micrometer thick, while some in the peripheral nervous system are much thicker. The soma is usually about 10–25 micrometers in diameter and often is not much larger than the cell nucleus it contains. The longest axon of a human motor neuron can be over a meter long, reaching from the base of the spine to the toes.

Sensory neurons can have axons that run from the toes to the posterior column of the spinal cord, over 1.5 meters in adults. Giraffes have single axons several meters in length running along the entire length of their necks. Much of what is known about axonal function comes from studying the squid giant axon, an ideal experimental preparation because of its relatively immense size (0.5–1 millimeter thick, several centimeters long).

Fully differentiated neurons are permanently postmitotic however, stem cells present in the adult brain may regenerate functional neurons throughout the life of an organism (see neurogenesis). Astrocytes are star-shaped glial cells that have been observed to turn into neurons by virtue of their stem cell-like characteristic of pluripotency.

===Membrane===
Like all animal cells, the cell body of every neuron is enclosed by a plasma membrane, a bilayer of lipid molecules with many types of protein structures embedded in it. A lipid bilayer is a powerful electrical insulator, but in neurons, many of the protein structures embedded in the membrane are electrically active. These include ion channels that permit electrically charged ions to flow across the membrane and ion pumps that chemically transport ions from one side of the membrane to the other. Most ion channels are permeable only to specific types of ions. Some ion channels are voltage gated, meaning that they can be switched between open and closed states by altering the voltage difference across the membrane. Others are chemically gated, meaning that they can be switched between open and closed states by interactions with chemicals that diffuse through the extracellular fluid. The ion materials include sodium, potassium, chloride, and calcium. The interactions between ion channels and ion pumps produce a voltage difference across the membrane, typically a bit less than 1/10 of a volt at baseline. This voltage has two functions: first, it provides a power source for an assortment of voltage-dependent protein machinery that is embedded in the membrane; second, it provides a basis for electrical signal transmission between different parts of the membrane.

===Histology and internal structure===


Numerous microscopic clumps called Nissl bodies (or Nissl substance) are seen when nerve cell bodies are stained with a basophilic (&quot;base-loving&quot;) dye. These structures consist of rough endoplasmic reticulum and associated ribosomal RNA. Named after German psychiatrist and neuropathologist Franz Nissl (1860–1919), they are involved in protein synthesis and their prominence can be explained by the fact that nerve cells are very metabolically active. Basophilic dyes such as aniline or (weakly) hematoxylin highlight negatively charged components, and so bind to the phosphate backbone of the ribosomal RNA.

The cell body of a neuron is supported by a complex mesh of structural proteins called neurofilaments, which together with neurotubules (neuronal microtubules) are assembled into larger neurofibrils. Some neurons also contain pigment granules, such as neuromelanin (a brownish-black pigment that is byproduct of synthesis of catecholamines), and lipofuscin (a yellowish-brown pigment), both of which accumulate with age. Other structural proteins that are important for neuronal function are actin and the tubulin of microtubules. Class III β-tubulin is found almost exclusively in neurons. Actin is predominately found at the tips of axons and dendrites during neuronal development. There the actin dynamics can be modulated via an interplay with microtubule.

There are different internal structural characteristics between axons and dendrites. Typical axons seldom contain ribosomes, except some in the initial segment. Dendrites contain granular endoplasmic reticulum or ribosomes, in diminishing amounts as the distance from the cell body increases.

==Classification==


Neurons vary in shape and size and can be classified by their morphology and function. The anatomist Camillo Golgi grouped neurons into two types; type I with long axons used to move signals over long distances and type II with short axons, which can often be confused with dendrites. Type I cells can be further classified by the location of the soma. The basic morphology of type I neurons, represented by spinal motor neurons, consists of a cell body called the soma and a long thin axon covered by a myelin sheath. The dendritic tree wraps around the cell body and receives signals from other neurons. The end of the axon has branching axon terminals that release neurotransmitters into a gap called the synaptic cleft between the terminals and the dendrites of the next neuron.

===Structural classification===

====Polarity====

Most neurons can be anatomically characterized as:
* Unipolar: single process. Unipolar cells are exclusively sensory neurons. Their dendrites receive sensory information, sometimes directly from the stimulus itself. The cell bodies of unipolar neurons are always found in ganglia. Sensory reception is a peripheral function, so the cell body is in the periphery, though closer to the CNS in a ganglion. The axon projects from the dendrite endings, past the cell body in a ganglion, and into the central nervous system.
* Bipolar: 1 axon and 1 dendrite. They are found mainly in the olfactory epithelium, and as part of the retina.
* Multipolar: 1 axon and 2 or more dendrites
** Golgi I: neurons with long-projecting axonal processes; examples are pyramidal cells, Purkinje cells, and anterior horn cells
** Golgi II: neurons whose axonal process projects locally; the best example is the granule cell
* Anaxonic: where the axon cannot be distinguished from the dendrite(s)
* Pseudounipolar: 1 process which then serves as both an axon and a dendrite

====Other====
Some unique neuronal types can be identified according to their location in the nervous system and distinct shape. Some examples are:
* Basket cells, interneurons that form a dense plexus of terminals around the soma of target cells, found in the cortex and cerebellum
* Betz cells, large motor neurons in primary motor cortex
* Lugaro cells, interneurons of the cerebellum
* Medium spiny neurons, most neurons in the corpus striatum
* Purkinje cells, huge neurons in the cerebellum, a type of Golgi I multipolar neuron
* Pyramidal cells, neurons with triangular soma, a type of Golgi I
* Rosehip cells, unique human inhibitory neurons that interconnect with Pyramidal cells
* Renshaw cells, neurons with both ends linked to alpha motor neurons
* Unipolar brush cells, interneurons with unique dendrite ending in a brush-like tuft
* Granule cells, a type of Golgi II neuron
* Anterior horn cells, motoneurons located in the spinal cord
* Spindle cells, interneurons that connect widely separated areas of the brain

===Functional classification===

====Direction====
* Afferent neurons convey information from tissues and organs into the central nervous system and are also called sensory neurons.
* Efferent neurons (motor neurons) transmit signals from the central nervous system to the effector cells.
* Interneurons connect neurons within specific regions of the central nervous system.

Afferent and efferent also refer generally to neurons that, respectively, bring information to or send information from the brain.

====Action on other neurons====
A neuron affects other neurons by releasing a neurotransmitter that binds to chemical receptors. The effect on the postsynaptic neuron is determined by the type of receptor that is activated, not by the presynaptic neuron or by the neurotransmitter. A neurotransmitter can be thought of as a key, and a receptor as a lock: the same neurotransmitter can activate multiple types of receptors. Receptors can be classified broadly as &quot;excitatory&quot; (causing an increase in firing rate), &quot;inhibitory&quot; (causing a decrease in firing rate), or &quot;modulatory&quot; (causing long-lasting effects not directly related to firing rate).

The two most common (90%+) neurotransmitters in the brain, glutamate and GABA, have largely consistent actions. Glutamate acts on several types of receptors and has effects that are excitatory at ionotropic receptors and a modulatory effect at metabotropic receptors. Similarly, GABA acts on several types of receptors, but all of them have inhibitory effects (in adult animals, at least). Because of this consistency, it is common for neuroscientists to refer to cells that release glutamate as &quot;excitatory neurons&quot;, and cells that release GABA as &quot;inhibitory neurons&quot;. Some other types of neurons have consistent effects, for example, &quot;excitatory&quot; motor neurons in the spinal cord that release acetylcholine, and &quot;inhibitory&quot; spinal neurons that release glycine.

The distinction between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters is not absolute. Rather, it depends on the class of chemical receptors present on the postsynaptic neuron. In principle, a single neuron, releasing a single neurotransmitter, can have excitatory effects on some targets, inhibitory effects on others, and modulatory effects on others still. For example, photoreceptor cells in the retina constantly release the neurotransmitter glutamate in the absence of light. So-called OFF bipolar cells are, like most neurons, excited by the released glutamate. However, neighboring target neurons called ON bipolar cells are instead inhibited by glutamate, because they lack typical ionotropic glutamate receptors and instead express a class of inhibitory metabotropic glutamate receptors. When light is present, the photoreceptors cease releasing glutamate, which relieves the ON bipolar cells from inhibition, activating them; this simultaneously removes the excitation from the OFF bipolar cells, silencing them.

It is possible to identify the type of inhibitory effect a presynaptic neuron will have on a postsynaptic neuron, based on the proteins the presynaptic neuron expresses. Parvalbumin-expressing neurons typically dampen the output signal of the postsynaptic neuron in the visual cortex, whereas somatostatin-expressing neurons typically block dendritic inputs to the postsynaptic neuron.

====Discharge patterns====
Neurons have intrinsic electroresponsive properties like intrinsic transmembrane voltage oscillatory patterns. So neurons can be classified according to their electrophysiological characteristics:
* Tonic or regular spiking. Some neurons are typically constantly (tonically) active, typically firing at a constant frequency. Example: interneurons in neurostriatum.
* Phasic or bursting. Neurons that fire in bursts are called phasic.
* Fast-spiking. Some neurons are notable for their high firing rates, for example, some types of cortical inhibitory interneurons, cells in globus pallidus, retinal ganglion cells.

====Neurotransmitter====
Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers passed from one neuron to another neuron or to a muscle cell or gland cell.
* Cholinergic neurons – acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is released from presynaptic neurons into the synaptic cleft. It acts as a ligand for both ligand-gated ion channels and metabotropic (GPCRs) muscarinic receptors. Nicotinic receptors are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels composed of alpha and beta subunits that bind nicotine. Ligand binding opens the channel causing the influx of Na+ depolarization and increases the probability of presynaptic neurotransmitter release. Acetylcholine is synthesized from choline and acetyl coenzyme A.
* Adrenergic neurons – noradrenaline. Noradrenaline (norepinephrine) is released from most postganglionic neurons in the sympathetic nervous system onto two sets of GPCRs: alpha adrenoceptors and beta adrenoceptors. Noradrenaline is one of the three common catecholamine neurotransmitters, and the most prevalent of them in the peripheral nervous system; as with other catecholamines, it is synthesized from tyrosine.
* GABAergic neurons – gamma aminobutyric acid. GABA is one of two neuroinhibitors in the central nervous system (CNS), along with glycine. GABA has a homologous function to ACh, gating anion channels that allow Cl− ions to enter the post synaptic neuron. Cl− causes hyperpolarization within the neuron, decreasing the probability of an action potential firing as the voltage becomes more negative (for an action potential to fire, a positive voltage threshold must be reached). GABA is synthesized from glutamate neurotransmitters by the enzyme glutamate decarboxylase.
* Glutamatergic neurons – glutamate. Glutamate is one of two primary excitatory amino acid neurotransmitters, along with aspartate. Glutamate receptors are one of four categories, three of which are ligand-gated ion channels and one of which is a G-protein coupled receptor (often referred to as GPCR).

:#AMPA and Kainate receptors function as cation channels permeable to Na+ cation channels mediating fast excitatory synaptic transmission.
:#NMDA receptors are another cation channel that is more permeable to Ca2+. The function of NMDA receptors depends on glycine receptor binding as a co-agonist within the channel pore. NMDA receptors do not function without both ligands present.
:#Metabotropic receptors, GPCRs modulate synaptic transmission and postsynaptic excitability.
:: Glutamate can cause excitotoxicity when blood flow to the brain is interrupted, resulting in brain damage. When blood flow is suppressed, glutamate is released from presynaptic neurons, causing greater NMDA and AMPA receptor activation than normal outside of stress conditions, leading to elevated Ca2+ and Na+ entering the post synaptic neuron and cell damage. Glutamate is synthesized from the amino acid glutamine by the enzyme glutamate synthase.
* Dopaminergic neurons—dopamine. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that acts on D1 type (D1 and D5) Gs-coupled receptors, which increase cAMP and PKA, and D2 type (D2, D3, and D4) receptors, which activate Gi-coupled receptors that decrease cAMP and PKA. Dopamine is connected to mood and behavior and modulates both pre- and post-synaptic neurotransmission. Loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra has been linked to Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Dopamine is synthesized from the amino acid tyrosine. Tyrosine is catalyzed into levodopa (or L-DOPA) by tyrosine hydroxlase, and levodopa is then converted into dopamine by the aromatic amino acid decarboxylase.
* Serotonergic neurons—serotonin. Serotonin (5-Hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) can act as excitatory or inhibitory. Of its four 5-HT receptor classes, 3 are GPCR and 1 is a ligand-gated cation channel. Serotonin is synthesized from tryptophan by tryptophan hydroxylase, and then further by decarboxylase. A lack of 5-HT at postsynaptic neurons has been linked to depression. Drugs that block the presynaptic serotonin transporter are used for treatment, such as Prozac and Zoloft.
* Purinergic neurons—ATP. ATP is a neurotransmitter acting at both ligand-gated ion channels (P2X receptors) and GPCRs (P2Y) receptors. ATP is, however, best known as a cotransmitter. Such purinergic signaling can also be mediated by other purines like adenosine, which particularly acts at P2Y receptors.
* Histaminergic neurons—histamine. Histamine is a monoamine neurotransmitter and neuromodulator. Histamine-producing neurons are found in the tuberomammillary nucleus of the hypothalamus. Histamine is involved in arousal and regulating sleep/wake behaviors.

====Multimodel classification====
Since 2012 there has been a push from the cellular and computational neuroscience community to come up with a universal classification of neurons that will apply to all neurons in the brain as well as across species. This is done by considering the three essential qualities of all neurons: electrophysiology, morphology, and the individual transcriptome of the cells. Besides being universal this classification has the advantage of being able to classify astrocytes as well. A method called patch-sequencing in which all three qualities can be measured at once is used extensively by the Allen Institute for Brain Science. In 2023, a comprehensive cell atlas of the adult, and developing human brain at the transcriptional, epigenetic, and functional levels was created through an international collaboration of researchers using the most cutting-edge molecular biology approaches.

==Connectivity==

Neurons communicate with each other via synapses, where either the axon terminal of one cell contacts another neuron&#x27;s dendrite, soma, or, less commonly, axon. Neurons such as Purkinje cells in the cerebellum can have over 1000 dendritic branches, making connections with tens of thousands of other cells; other neurons, such as the magnocellular neurons of the supraoptic nucleus, have only one or two dendrites, each of which receives thousands of synapses.

Synapses can be excitatory or inhibitory, either increasing or decreasing activity in the target neuron, respectively. Some neurons also communicate via electrical synapses, which are direct, electrically conductive junctions between cells.

When an action potential reaches the axon terminal, it opens voltage-gated calcium channels, allowing calcium ions to enter the terminal. Calcium causes synaptic vesicles filled with neurotransmitter molecules to fuse with the membrane, releasing their contents into the synaptic cleft. The neurotransmitters diffuse across the synaptic cleft and activate receptors on the postsynaptic neuron. High cytosolic calcium in the axon terminal triggers mitochondrial calcium uptake, which, in turn, activates mitochondrial energy metabolism to produce ATP to support continuous neurotransmission.

An autapse is a synapse in which a neuron&#x27;s axon connects to its dendrites.

The human brain has some 8.6 x 1010 (eighty six billion) neurons. Each neuron has on average 7,000 synaptic connections to other neurons. It has been estimated that the brain of a three-year-old child has about 1015 synapses (1 quadrillion). This number declines with age, stabilizing by adulthood. Estimates vary for an adult, ranging from 1014 to 5 x 1014 synapses (100 to 500 trillion).

=== Nonelectrochemical signaling ===
Beyond electrical and chemical signaling, studies suggest neurons in healthy human brains can also communicate through:
* force generated by the enlargement of dendritic spines
* the transfer of proteins – transneuronally transported proteins (TNTPs)

They can also get modulated by input from the environment and hormones released from other parts of the organism, which could be influenced more or less directly by neurons. This also applies to neurotrophins such as BDNF. The gut microbiome is also connected with the brain.
Neurons also communicate with microglia, the brain&#x27;s main immune cells via specialized contact sites, called &quot;somatic junctions&quot;. These connections enable microglia to constantly monitor and regulate neuronal functions, and exert neuroprotection when needed.

==Mechanisms for propagating action potentials==

In 1937 John Zachary Young suggested that the squid giant axon could be used to study neuronal electrical properties. It is larger than but similar to human neurons, making it easier to study. By inserting electrodes into the squid giant axons, accurate measurements were made of the membrane potential.

The cell membrane of the axon and soma contain voltage-gated ion channels that allow the neuron to generate and propagate an electrical signal (an action potential). Some neurons also generate subthreshold membrane potential oscillations. These signals are generated and propagated by charge-carrying ions including sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), chloride (Cl−), and calcium (Ca2+).

Several stimuli can activate a neuron leading to electrical activity, including pressure, stretch, chemical transmitters, and changes in the electric potential across the cell membrane. Stimuli cause specific ion-channels within the cell membrane to open, leading to a flow of ions through the cell membrane, changing the membrane potential. Neurons must maintain the specific electrical properties that define their neuron type.

Thin neurons and axons require less metabolic expense to produce and carry action potentials, but thicker axons convey impulses more rapidly. To minimize metabolic expense while maintaining rapid conduction, many neurons have insulating sheaths of myelin around their axons. The sheaths are formed by glial cells: oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system. The sheath enables action potentials to travel faster than in unmyelinated axons of the same diameter, whilst using less energy. The myelin sheath in peripheral nerves normally runs along the axon in sections about 1 mm long, punctuated by unsheathed nodes of Ranvier, which contain a high density of voltage-gated ion channels. Multiple sclerosis is a neurological disorder that results from the demyelination of axons in the central nervous system.

Some neurons do not generate action potentials but instead generate a graded electrical signal, which in turn causes graded neurotransmitter release. Such non-spiking neurons tend to be sensory neurons or interneurons, because they cannot carry signals long distances.

==Neural coding==
Neural coding is concerned with how sensory and other information is represented in the brain by neurons. The main goal of studying neural coding is to characterize the relationship between the stimulus and the individual or ensemble neuronal responses and the relationships among the electrical activities of the neurons within the ensemble. It is thought that neurons can encode both digital and analog information.

==All-or-none principle==
The conduction of nerve impulses is an example of an all-or-none response. In other words, if a neuron responds at all, then it must respond completely. Greater intensity of stimulation, like brighter image/louder sound, does not produce a stronger signal but can increase firing frequency. Receptors respond in different ways to stimuli. Slowly adapting or tonic receptors respond to a steady stimulus and produce a steady rate of firing. Tonic receptors most often respond to increased stimulus intensity by increasing their firing frequency, usually as a power function of stimulus plotted against impulses per second. This can be likened to an intrinsic property of light where greater intensity of a specific frequency (color) requires more photons, as the photons can not become &quot;stronger&quot; for a specific frequency.

Other receptor types include quickly adapting or phasic receptors, where firing decreases or stops with a steady stimulus; examples include skin which, when touched causes neurons to fire, but if the object maintains even pressure, the neurons stop firing. The neurons of the skin and muscles that are responsive to pressure and vibration have filtering accessory structures that aid their function.

The pacinian corpuscle is one such structure. It has concentric layers like an onion, which form around the axon terminal. When pressure is applied and the corpuscle is deformed, mechanical stimulus is transferred to the axon, which fires. If the pressure is steady, the stimulus ends; thus, these neurons typically respond with a transient depolarization during the initial deformation and again when the pressure is removed, which causes the corpuscle to change shape again. Other types of adaptation are important in extending the function of several other neurons.

==Etymology and spelling==

The German anatomist Heinrich Wilhelm Waldeyer introduced the term &quot;neuron&quot; in 1891, based on the ancient Greek νεῦρον &quot;neuron&quot; &#x27;sinew, cord, nerve&#x27;. 

The word was adopted in French with the spelling &quot;neurone&quot;. That spelling was also used by many writers in English, but has now become rare in American usage and uncommon in British usage.

Some previous works used &quot;nerve cell&quot; (&quot;cellule nervose&quot;), as adopted in Camillo Golgi&#x27;s 1873 paper on the discovery of the silver staining technique used to visualize nervous tissue under light microscopy.

==History==


The neuron&#x27;s place as the primary functional unit of the nervous system was first recognized in the late 19th century through the work of the Spanish anatomist Santiago Ramón y Cajal.

To make the structure of individual neurons visible, Ramón y Cajal improved a silver staining process that had been developed by Camillo Golgi. The improved process involves a technique called &quot;double impregnation&quot; and is still in use.

In 1888 Ramón y Cajal published a paper about the bird cerebellum. In this paper, he stated that he could not find evidence for anastomosis between axons and dendrites and called each nervous element &quot;an autonomous canton.&quot; This became known as the neuron doctrine, one of the central tenets of modern neuroscience.

In 1891, the German anatomist Heinrich Wilhelm Waldeyer wrote a highly influential review of the neuron doctrine in which he introduced the term &quot;neuron&quot; to describe the anatomical and physiological unit of the nervous system.

The silver impregnation stains are a useful method for neuroanatomical investigations because, for reasons unknown, it stains only a small percentage of cells in a tissue, exposing the complete micro structure of individual neurons without much overlap from other cells.

===Neuron doctrine===

The neuron doctrine is the now fundamental idea that neurons are the basic structural and functional units of the nervous system. The theory was put forward by Santiago Ramón y Cajal in the late 19th century. It held that neurons are discrete cells (not connected in a meshwork), acting as metabolically distinct units.

Later discoveries yielded refinements to the doctrine. For example, glial cells, which are non-neuronal, play an essential role in information processing. Also, electrical synapses are more common than previously thought, comprising direct, cytoplasmic connections between neurons; In fact, neurons can form even tighter couplings: the squid giant axon arises from the fusion of multiple axons.

Ramón y Cajal also postulated the Law of Dynamic Polarization, which states that a neuron receives signals at its dendrites and cell body and transmits them, as action potentials, along the axon in one direction: away from the cell body. The Law of Dynamic Polarization has important exceptions; dendrites can serve as synaptic output sites of neurons and axons can receive synaptic inputs.

===Compartmental modelling of neurons===
Although neurons are often described as &quot;fundamental units&quot; of the brain, they perform internal computations. Neurons integrate input within dendrites, and this complexity is lost in models that assume neurons to be a fundamental unit. Dendritic branches can be modeled as spatial compartments, whose activity is related to passive membrane properties, but may also be different depending on input from synapses. Compartmental modelling of dendrites is especially helpful for understanding the behavior of neurons that are too small to record with electrodes, as is the case for &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;.

==Neurons in the brain==
The number of neurons in the brain varies dramatically from species to species. In a human, there are an estimated 10–20 billion neurons in the cerebral cortex and 55–70 billion neurons in the cerebellum. By contrast, the nematode worm &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot; has just 302 neurons, making it an ideal model organism as scientists have been able to map all of its neurons. The fruit fly &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;, a common subject in biological experiments, has around 100,000 neurons and exhibits many complex behaviors. Many properties of neurons, from the type of neurotransmitters used to ion channel composition, are maintained across species, allowing scientists to study processes occurring in more complex organisms in much simpler experimental systems.

==Neurological disorders==
Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (CMT) is a heterogeneous inherited disorder of nerves (neuropathy) that is characterized by loss of muscle tissue and touch sensation, predominantly in the feet and legs extending to the hands and arms in advanced stages. Presently incurable, this disease is one of the most common inherited neurological disorders, affecting 36 in 100,000 people.

Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (AD), also known simply as &quot;Alzheimer&#x27;s&quot;, is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration, together with declining activities of daily living and neuropsychiatric symptoms or behavioral changes. The most striking early symptom is loss of short-term memory (amnesia), which usually manifests as minor forgetfulness that becomes steadily more pronounced with illness progression, with relative preservation of older memories. As the disorder progresses, cognitive (intellectual) impairment extends to the domains of language (aphasia), skilled movements (apraxia), and recognition (agnosia), and functions such as decision-making and planning become impaired.

Parkinson&#x27;s disease (PD), also known as &quot;Parkinson&#x27;s&quot;, is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that often impairs motor skills and speech. Parkinson&#x27;s disease belongs to a group of conditions called movement disorders. It is characterized by muscle rigidity, tremor, a slowing of physical movement (bradykinesia), and in extreme cases, a loss of physical movement (akinesia). The primary symptoms are the results of decreased stimulation of the motor cortex by the basal ganglia, normally caused by the insufficient formation and action of dopamine, which is produced in the dopaminergic neurons of the brain. Secondary symptoms may include high-level cognitive dysfunction and subtle language problems. PD is both chronic and progressive.

Myasthenia gravis is a neuromuscular disease leading to fluctuating muscle weakness and fatigability during simple activities. Weakness is typically caused by circulating antibodies that block acetylcholine receptors at the postsynaptic neuromuscular junction, inhibiting the stimulative effect of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Myasthenia is treated with immunosuppressants, cholinesterase inhibitors and, in selected cases, thymectomy.

===Demyelination===
Demyelination is a process characterized by the gradual loss of the myelin sheath enveloping nerve fibers. When myelin deteriorates, signal conduction along nerves can be significantly impaired or lost, and the nerve eventually withers. Demyelination may affect both central and peripheral nervous systems, contributing to various neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. Although demyelination is often caused by an autoimmune reaction, it may also be caused by viral infections, metabolic disorders, trauma, and some medications.

===Axonal degeneration===
Although most injury responses include a calcium influx signaling to promote resealing of severed parts, axonal injuries initially lead to acute axonal degeneration, which is the rapid separation of the proximal and distal ends, occurring within 30 minutes of injury. Degeneration follows with swelling of the axolemma, and eventually leads to bead-like formation. Granular disintegration of the axonal cytoskeleton and inner organelles occurs after axolemma degradation. Early changes include accumulation of mitochondria in the paranodal regions at the site of injury. The endoplasmic reticulum degrades and mitochondria swell up and eventually disintegrate. The disintegration is dependent on ubiquitin and calpain proteases (caused by the influx of calcium ions), suggesting that axonal degeneration is an active process that produces complete fragmentation. The process takes about roughly 24 hours in the PNS and longer in the CNS. The signaling pathways leading to axolemma degeneration are unknown.

==Development==

Neurons develop through the process of neurogenesis, in which neural stem cells divide to produce differentiated neurons. Once fully differentiated they are no longer capable of undergoing mitosis. Neurogenesis primarily occurs during embryonic development.

Neurons initially develop from the neural tube in the embryo. The neural tube has three layers – a ventricular zone, an intermediate zone, and a marginal zone. The ventricular zone surrounds the tube&#x27;s central canal and becomes the ependyma. Dividing cells of the ventricular zone form the intermediate zone which stretches to the outermost layer of the neural tube called the pial layer. The gray matter of the brain is derived from the intermediate zone. The extensions of the neurons in the intermediate zone make up the marginal zone when myelinated becomes the brain&#x27;s white matter.

Differentiation of the neurons is ordered by their size. Large motor neurons are first. Smaller sensory neurons together with glial cell differentiate at birth.

Adult neurogenesis can occur and studies of the age of human neurons suggest that this process occurs only for a minority of cells and that the vast majority of neurons in the neocortex form before birth and persist without replacement. The extent to which adult neurogenesis exists in humans, and its contribution to cognition are controversial, with conflicting reports published in 2018.

The body contains a variety of stem cell types that can differentiate into neurons. Researchers found a way to transform human skin cells into nerve cells using transdifferentiation, in which &quot;cells are forced to adopt new identities&quot;.

During neurogenesis in the mammalian brain, progenitor and stem cells progress from proliferative divisions to differentiative divisions. This progression leads to the neurons and glia that populate cortical layers. Epigenetic modifications play a key role in regulating gene expression in differentiating neural stem cells, and are critical for cell fate determination in the developing and adult mammalian brain. Epigenetic modifications include DNA cytosine methylation to form 5-methylcytosine and 5-methylcytosine demethylation. These modifications are critical for cell fate determination in the developing and adult mammalian brain. DNA cytosine methylation is catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). Methylcytosine demethylation is catalyzed in several stages by TET enzymes that carry out oxidative reactions (e.g. 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine) and enzymes of the DNA base excision repair (BER) pathway.

At different stages of mammalian nervous system development, two DNA repair processes are employed in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks. These pathways are homologous recombinational repair used in proliferating neural precursor cells, and non-homologous end joining used mainly at later developmental stages

Intercellular communication between developing neurons and microglia is also indispensable for proper neurogenesis and brain development.

== Nerve regeneration ==

Peripheral axons can regrow if they are severed, but one neuron cannot be functionally replaced by one of another type (Llinás&#x27; law).

<text>A Usenet newsgroup is a repository usually within the Usenet system, for messages posted from users in different locations using the Internet. They are not only discussion groups or conversations, but also a repository to publish articles, start developing tasks like creating Linux, sustain mailing lists and file uploading. That’s thank to the protocol that poses no article size limit, but are to the providers to decide. In the late 1980s, Usenet articles were often limited by the providers to 60,000 characters, but in time, Usenet groups have been split into two types: &quot;text&quot; for mainly discussions, conversations, articles, limited by most providers to about 32,000 characters, and &quot;binary&quot; for file transfer, with providers setting limits ranging from less than 1 MB to about 4 MB. Newsgroups are technically distinct from, but functionally similar to, discussion forums on the World Wide Web. Newsreader software is used to read the content of newsgroups. Before the adoption of the World Wide Web, Usenet newsgroups were among the most popular Internet services.

Communication is facilitated by the Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) which allows connection to Usenet servers and data transfer over the internet. Similar to another early (yet still used) protocol SMTP which is used for email messages, NNTP allows both server-server and client-server communication. This means that newsgroups can be replicated from server to server which gives the Usenet network the ability to maintain a level of robust data persistence as a result of built-in data redundancy. However, most users will access using only the client-server commands of NNTP and in almost all cases will use a GUI for browsing as opposed to command line based client-server communication specified in the NNTP protocol.

==Types==

Newsgroups generally come in either of two types, binary, with single messages limited to some MB&#x27;s, or text, where text groups are limited to some tens of kilobytes. There is no technical difference between the two, but the naming differentiation allows users and servers with limited facilities to minimize network bandwidth usage, by dropping the large size binary groups. Historically, with telephone modems at only kilobytes transfer rates, Usenet conventions and rules were enacted to minimize the overall amount of network traffic and resource usage, but today, only the above message size hard limits imposed by the providers are respected.

Typically, the newsgroup is focused on a particular topic of interest. A message sent for publication on a newsgroup is called a &quot;post&quot;. Some newsgroups allow posts on a wide variety of themes, regarding anything a member chooses to discuss as on-topic, while others keep more strictly to their particular subject, frowning on off-topic posts. The news admin (the administrator of a news server) decides how long posts are kept on their server before being expired (deleted), which is called retention. Different servers will have different retention times for the same newsgroup; some may keep posts for as little as one or two weeks, others may hold them for many years.

Back when the early community was the pioneering computer society, the common habit seen with many posts was a notice at the end that disclosed whether the author had (or was free of) a personal interest (financial, political or otherwise) in making the post. This is rarer now, and the posts must be read more skeptically, as with other media. Privacy and phishing issues have also risen in importance.

Usenet newsgroups posters and operators usually do not make money from their occupations on the platform.

The number of newsgroups grew from more than 100 as of 1983 to more than 110,000, but only 20,000 or so of those are active. Newsgroups vary in popularity; some newsgroups receive fewer than a dozen posts per year while the most popular can get several thousand in under an hour.

===Binary===

While newsgroups were not created with the intention of distributing files such as pictures, sound and video, they have proven to be quite effective for this. As of 2022, some remain popular as an alternative to BitTorrent to share and download files.

Because newsgroups are widely distributed, a file uploaded once will be spread to many other servers and can then be downloaded by an unlimited number of users. More useful is that users download from a local news server, rather than from a more distant machine with perhaps limited connectivity, as may be the case with peer-to-peer technology. In fact, this is another benefit of newsgroups: it is usually not expected that users share. If every user makes uploads then the servers would be flooded; thus it is acceptable and often encouraged for users to just leech.

There were originally a number of obstacles to the transfer of binary files over Usenet. Usenet was originally designed with the transmission of text in mind, and so the encoding of posts caused losses in binary data where the data was not part of the protocol&#x27;s character set. Consequently, for a long while, it was impossible to send binary data as such. As workarounds, codecs such as Uuencode and later Base64 and yEnc were developed which encoded the binary data from the files to be transmitted (e.g. sound or video files) to text characters which would survive transmission over Usenet. At the receiver&#x27;s end, the data needed to be decoded by the user&#x27;s news client.

Additionally, there was a limit on the size of individual posts so that large files could not be sent as single posts. To get around this, Newsreaders were developed which were able to split long files into several posts. Intelligent newsreaders at the other end could then automatically group such split files into single files, allowing the user to easily retrieve the file. These advances have meant that Usenet is used to send and receive many terabytes of files per day.

There are two main issues that pose problems for transmitting large files over newsgroups. The first is completion rates and the other is retention rates. The business of premium news servers is generated primarily on their ability to offer superior completion and retention rates, as well as their ability to offer very fast connections to users. Completion rates are significant when users wish to download large files that are split into pieces; if any one piece is missing, it is impossible to successfully download and reassemble the desired file. To work around the problem, a redundancy scheme known as Parchive (PAR) is commonly used.

Many major news servers have a retention time of more than seven years. A number of websites exist to keep an index of files posted to binary newsgroups.

Partly because of such long retention times, as well as growing uploading and downloading speeds, Usenet is also used by individuals to store backup data in a practice called &quot;Usenet backup&quot;, or uBackup. While commercial providers offer easier-to-use online backup services, storing data on Usenet is free of charge (although access to Usenet itself may not be). A user must manually select, prepare and upload the data. Because anyone can download the backup files, the data is typically encrypted. After the files are uploaded, the uploader has no control over them; they are automatically distributed to all Usenet providers that subscribe to the newsgroup they are uploaded to, so there will be copies of them spread all around the world.

=== Moderated newsgroups ===
Most Newsgroups are not moderated. A moderated newsgroup has one or more individuals who must approve posts before they are published. A separate address is used to submit posts and the moderators then propagate those they approve of. The first moderated newsgroups appeared in 1984 under mod.* according to RFC 2235, &quot;Hobbes&#x27; Internet Timeline&quot;.

==Distribution==

Transmission within and at the bounds of the network uses the Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) (Internet standard RFC 3977 of 2006, updating RFC 977 of 1986).

Newsgroup servers are hosted by various organizations and institutions. Most Internet service providers host their own news servers, or rent access to one, for their subscribers. There are also a number of companies who sell access to premium news servers.

Every host of a news server maintains agreements with other nearby news servers to synchronize regularly. In this way news servers form a redundant network. When a user posts to one news server, the post is stored locally. That server then shares posts with the servers that are connected to it for those newsgroups they both carry. Those servers do likewise, propagating the posts through the network. For newsgroups that are not widely carried, sometimes a carrier group is used for crossposting to aid distribution. This is typically only useful for groups that have been removed or newer &quot;alt.*&quot; groups. Crossposts between hierarchies, outside of the Big 8 and &quot;alt.*&quot; hierarchies, are prone to failure.

==Hierarchies==

Newsgroups are often arranged into &quot;hierarchies&quot;, theoretically making it simpler to find related groups. The term &quot;top-level hierarchy&quot; refers to the hierarchy defined by the prefix before the first dot.

The most commonly known hierarchies are the &quot;Usenet hierarchies&quot;. So for instance newsgroup &quot;rec.arts.sf.starwars.games&quot; would be in the &quot;rec.*&quot; top-level Usenet hierarchy, where the asterisk (*) is defined as a wildcard character. There were seven original major hierarchies of Usenet newsgroups, known as the &quot;Big 7&quot;:
*&quot;comp.*&quot; — Discussion of computer-related topics
*&quot;news.*&quot; — Discussion of Usenet itself
*&quot;sci.*&quot; — Discussion of scientific subjects
*&quot;rec.*&quot; — Discussion of recreational activities (e.g. games and hobbies)
*&quot;soc.*&quot; — Socialising and discussion of social issues.
*&quot;talk.*&quot; — Discussion of contentious issues such as religion and politics.
*&quot;misc.*&quot; — Miscellaneous discussion—anything which does not fit in the other hierarchies.

These were all created in the Great Renaming of 1986–1987, before which all of these newsgroups were in the net.* hierarchy. At that time there was a great controversy over what newsgroups should be allowed. Among those that the Usenet cabal (who effectively ran the Big 7 at the time) did not allow were those concerning recipes, recreational drug use, and sex.

This situation resulted in the creation of an &quot;alt.*&quot; (short for &quot;alternative&quot;) Usenet hierarchy, under which these groups would be allowed. Over time, the laxness of rules on newsgroup creation in alt.* compared to the Big 7 meant that many new topics could, given time, gain enough popularity to get a Big 7 newsgroup. There was a rapid growth of alt.* as a result, and the trend continues to this day. Because of the anarchistic nature with which the groups sprang up, some jokingly referred to ALT standing for &quot;Anarchists, Lunatics and Terrorists&quot; (a backronym).

In 1995, &quot;humanities.*&quot; was created for the discussion of the humanities (e.g. literature, philosophy), and the Big 7 became the Big 8.

The &quot;alt.*&quot; hierarchy has discussion of all kinds of topics, and many hierarchies for discussion specific to a particular geographical area or in a language other than English.

Before a new Big 8 newsgroup can be created, an RFD (Request For Discussion) must be posted into the newsgroup news.announce.newgroups, which is then discussed in news.groups.proposals. Once the proposal has been formalized with a name, description, charter, the Big-8 Management Board will vote on whether to create the group. If the proposal is approved by the Big-8 Management Board, the group is created. Groups are removed in a similar manner.

Creating a new group in the alt.* hierarchy is not subject to the same rules; anybody can create a newsgroup, and anybody can remove it, but most news administrators will ignore these requests unless a local user requests the group by name.

===Further hierarchies===
There are a number of newsgroup hierarchies outside of the Big 8 (and alt.*) that can be found on many news servers. These include non-English language groups, groups managed by companies or organizations about their products, geographic/local hierarchies, and even non-internet network boards routed into NNTP. Examples include (alphabetically):
*&quot;aus.*&quot; – Australian news groups
*&quot;ba.*&quot; – Discussion in the San Francisco Bay area
*&quot;ca.*&quot; – Discussion in California
*&quot;can.*&quot; – Canadian news groups
*&quot;cn.*&quot; – Chinese news groups
*&quot;chi.*&quot; – Discussions about the Chicago area
*&quot;de.*&quot; – Discussions in German
*&quot;dictator.*&quot; – Discussions about bad governance related to the &quot;Dictator&#x27;s Handbook&quot;
*&quot;ec.*&quot; – Discussions about Ecuadorian culture and society
*&quot;england.*&quot; – Discussions (mostly) local to England, see also &quot;uk.*&quot;
*&quot;fidonet.*&quot; – Discussions routed from FidoNet
*&quot;fr.*&quot; – Discussions in French
*&quot;fj.*&quot; – &quot;From Japan,&quot; discussions in Japanese
*&quot;gnu.*&quot; – Discussions about GNU software
*&quot;hawaii.*&quot; – Discussions (mostly) local to Hawaii
*&quot;hk.*&quot; – Hong Kong newsgroups
*&quot;hp.*&quot; – Hewlett-Packard internal news groups
*&quot;it.*&quot; – Discussions in Italian
*&quot;microsoft.*&quot; – Discussions about Microsoft products
*&quot;nl.*&quot; – Dutch news groups
*&quot;no.*&quot; – Norwegian news groups
*&quot;pl.*&quot; – Polish news groups
*&quot;tw.*&quot; – Taiwan news groups
*&quot;uk.*&quot; – Discussions on matters in the United Kingdom
*&quot;yale.*&quot; – Discussions (mostly) local to Yale University

Additionally, there is the &quot;free.*&quot; hierarchy, which can be considered &quot;more alt than alt.*&quot;. There are many local sub-hierarchies within this hierarchy, usually for specific countries or cultures (such as &quot;free.it.*&quot; for Italy).

<text>The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO ; , OTAN), also called the North Atlantic Alliance, is an intergovernmental transnational military alliance of 32 member states—30 European and 2 North American. Established in the aftermath of World War II, the organization implements the North Atlantic Treaty, signed in Washington, D.C., on 4 April 1949. NATO is a collective security system: its independent member states agree to defend each other against attacks by third parties. During the Cold War, NATO operated as a check on the threat posed by the Soviet Union. The alliance remained in place after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact, and has been involved in military operations in the Balkans, the Middle East, South Asia, and Africa. The organization&#x27;s motto is . The organization&#x27;s strategic concepts include deterrence.

NATO&#x27;s main headquarters are located in Brussels, Belgium, while NATO&#x27;s military headquarters are near Mons, Belgium. The alliance has increased its NATO Response Force deployments in Eastern Europe, and the combined militaries of all NATO members include around 3.5 million soldiers and personnel. All member states together cover an area of with a population of about 973 million people. Their combined military spending constituted around 55 percent of the global nominal total. Moreover, members have agreed to reach or maintain the target defence spending of at least two percent of their GDP by 2024.

NATO formed with twelve founding members and has added new members ten times, most recently when Sweden joined the alliance on 7 March 2024. In addition, NATO recognizes Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, and Ukraine as aspiring members. Enlargement has led to tensions with non-member Russia, one of the 18 additional countries participating in NATO&#x27;s Partnership for Peace programme. Another 19 countries are involved in institutionalized dialogue programmes with NATO.

==History==
===20th century===
NATO has its roots in the Atlantic Charter, a 1941 agreement between the United States and United Kingdom. The Charter laid out a framework for international cooperation without territorial expansion after World War II. On 4 March 1947, the Treaty of Dunkirk was signed by France and the United Kingdom during the aftermath of World War II and the start of the Cold War as a &quot;Treaty of Alliance and Mutual Assistance&quot; in the event of possible attacks by Germany. In March 1948, this alliance was expanded in the Treaty of Brussels to include the Benelux countries, forming the Brussels Treaty Organization, commonly known as the Western Union. Talks for a wider military alliance, which could include North America, also began that month in the United States, where their foreign policy under the Truman Doctrine set out in 1947 promoted international solidarity against actions they saw as communist aggression, such as the February 1948 coup d&#x27;état in Czechoslovakia. These talks resulted in the signature of the North Atlantic Treaty on 4 April 1949 by the member states of the Western Union plus the United States, Canada, Portugal, Italy, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland. Canadian diplomat Lester B. Pearson was a key author and drafter of the treaty.

The North Atlantic Treaty was largely dormant until the Korean War initiated the establishment of NATO to implement it with an integrated military structure. This included the formation of Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) in 1951, which adopted many of the Western Union&#x27;s military structures and plans, including their agreements on standardizing equipment and agreements on stationing foreign military forces in European countries. In 1952, the post of Secretary General of NATO was established as the organization&#x27;s chief civilian. That year also saw the first major NATO maritime exercises, Exercise Mainbrace and the accession of Greece and Turkey to the organization. Following the London and Paris Conferences, West Germany was permitted to rearm militarily, as they joined NATO in May 1955, which was, in turn, a major factor in the creation of the Soviet-dominated Warsaw Pact, delineating the two opposing sides of the Cold War.

The building of the Berlin Wall in 1961 marked a height in Cold War tensions, when 400,000 US troops were stationed in Europe. Doubts over the strength of the relationship between the European states and the United States ebbed and flowed, along with doubts over the credibility of the NATO defence against a prospective Soviet invasion – doubts that led to the development of the independent French nuclear deterrent and the withdrawal of France from NATO&#x27;s military structure in 1966. In 1982, the newly democratic Spain joined the alliance.

The Revolutions of 1989 in Europe led to a strategic re-evaluation of NATO&#x27;s purpose, nature, tasks, and focus on the continent. In October 1990, East Germany became part of the Federal Republic of Germany and the alliance, and in November 1990, the alliance signed the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) in Paris with the Soviet Union. It mandated specific military reductions across the continent, which continued after the collapse of the Warsaw Pact in February 1991 and the dissolution of the Soviet Union that December, which removed the &quot;de facto&quot; main adversaries of NATO. This began a drawdown of military spending and equipment in Europe. The CFE treaty allowed signatories to remove 52,000 pieces of conventional armaments in the following sixteen years, and allowed military spending by NATO&#x27;s European members to decline by 28 percent from 1990 to 2015. In 1990, several Western leaders gave assurances to Mikhail Gorbachev that NATO would not expand further east, as revealed by memoranda of private conversations.

In the 1990s, the organization extended its activities into political and humanitarian situations that had not formerly been NATO concerns. During the breakup of Yugoslavia, the organization conducted its first military interventions in Bosnia from 1992 to 1995 and later Yugoslavia in 1999.

Politically, the organization sought better relations with the newly autonomous Central and Eastern European states, and diplomatic forums for regional cooperation between NATO and its neighbours were set up during this post-Cold War period, including the Partnership for Peace and the Mediterranean Dialogue initiative in 1994, the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council in 1997, and the NATO–Russia Permanent Joint Council in 1998. At the 1999 Washington summit, Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic officially joined NATO, and the organization also issued new guidelines for membership with individualized &quot;Membership Action Plans&quot;. These plans governed the subsequent addition of new alliance members.

===21st century===
, requiring member states to come to the aid of any member state subject to an armed attack, was invoked for the first and only time after the September 11 attacks, after which troops were deployed to Afghanistan under the NATO-led ISAF. The organization has operated a range of additional roles since then, including sending trainers to Iraq, assisting in counter-piracy operations.

The election of French president Nicolas Sarkozy in 2007 led to a major reform of France&#x27;s military position, culminating with the return to full membership on 4 April 2009, which also included France rejoining the NATO Military Command Structure, while maintaining an independent nuclear deterrent.

The 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea led to strong condemnation by all NATO members, and was one of the seven times that Article 4, which calls for consultation among NATO members, has been invoked. Prior times included during the Iraq War and Syrian civil war. At the 2014 Wales summit, the leaders of NATO&#x27;s member states formally committed for the first time to spend the equivalent of at least two percent of their gross domestic products on defence by 2024, which had previously been only an informal guideline.

At the 2016 Warsaw summit, NATO countries agreed on the creation of NATO Enhanced Forward Presence, which deployed four multinational battalion-sized battlegroups in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland. Before and during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, several NATO countries sent ground troops, warships and fighter aircraft to reinforce the alliance&#x27;s eastern flank, and multiple countries again invoked Article 4. In March 2022, NATO leaders met at Brussels for an extraordinary summit which also involved Group of Seven and European Union leaders. NATO member states agreed to establish four additional battlegroups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia, and elements of the NATO Response Force were activated for the first time in NATO&#x27;s history.

As of June 2022, NATO had deployed 40,000 troops along its Eastern flank to deter Russian aggression. More than half of this number have been deployed in Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, and Poland, which five countries muster a considerable combined ex-NATO force of 259,000 troops. To supplement Bulgaria&#x27;s Air Force, Spain sent Eurofighter Typhoons, the Netherlands sent eight F-35 attack aircraft, and additional French and US attack aircraft would arrive soon as well.

==Military operations==
===Early operations===
No military operations were conducted by NATO during the Cold War. Following the end of the Cold War, the first operations, &quot;Anchor Guard&quot; in 1990 and &quot;Ace Guard&quot; in 1991, were prompted by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Airborne early warning aircraft were sent to provide coverage of southeastern Turkey, and later a quick-reaction force was deployed to the area.

===Bosnia and Herzegovina intervention===

The Bosnian War began in 1992, as a result of the breakup of Yugoslavia. The deteriorating situation led to United Nations Security Council Resolution 816 on 9 October 1992, authorizing its member-states to enforce a previously declared no-fly zone under the United Nations Protection Force over central Bosnia and Herzegovina. NATO complied and started enforcing the ban on 12 April 1993 with Operation Deny Flight. From June 1993 until October 1996, Operation Sharp Guard added maritime enforcement of the arms embargo and economic sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. On 28 February 1994, NATO took its first wartime action by shooting down four Bosnian Serb aircraft violating the no-fly zone.

On 10 and 11 April 1994, the United Nations Protection Force called in air strikes to protect the Goražde safe area, resulting in the bombing of a Bosnian Serb military command outpost near Goražde by two US F-16 jets acting under NATO direction. In retaliation, Serbs took 150 U.N. personnel hostage on 14 April. On 16 April a British Sea Harrier was shot down over Goražde by Serb forces.

In August 1995, a two-week NATO bombing campaign, Operation Deliberate Force, began against the Army of the Republika Srpska, after the Srebrenica genocide. Further NATO air strikes helped bring the Yugoslav Wars to an end, resulting in the Dayton Agreement in November 1995. As part of this agreement, NATO deployed a UN-mandated peacekeeping force, under Operation Joint Endeavor, named IFOR. Almost 60,000 NATO troops were joined by forces from non-NATO countries in this peacekeeping mission. This transitioned into the smaller SFOR, which started with 32,000 troops initially and ran from December 1996 until December 2004, when operations were then passed onto the European Union Force Althea. Following the lead of its member states, NATO began to award a service medal, the NATO Medal, for these operations.

===Kosovo intervention===


In an effort to stop Slobodan Milošević&#x27;s Serbian-led crackdown on KLA separatists and Albanian civilians in Kosovo, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1199 on 23 September 1998 to demand a ceasefire.

Negotiations under US Special Envoy Richard Holbrooke broke down on 23 March 1999, and he handed the matter to NATO, which acted on protecting regional security and started a 78-day bombing campaign on 24 March 1999. Operation Allied Force targeted the military capabilities of what was then the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. During the crisis, NATO also deployed one of its international reaction forces, the ACE Mobile Force (Land), to Albania as the Albania Force (AFOR), to deliver humanitarian aid to refugees from Kosovo.

The campaign was and has been criticized over its civilian casualties, including the bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, and over whether it had legitimacy. The US, the UK, and most other NATO countries opposed efforts to require the UN Security Council to approve NATO military strikes, such as the action against Serbia in 1999, while France and some others claimed that the alliance needed UN approval. The US/UK side claimed that this would undermine the authority of the alliance, and they noted that Russia and China would have exercised their Security Council vetoes to block the strike on Yugoslavia, and could do the same in future conflicts where NATO intervention was required, thus nullifying the entire potency and purpose of the organization. Recognizing the post-Cold War military environment, NATO adopted the Alliance Strategic Concept during its Washington summit in April 1999 that emphasized conflict prevention and crisis management.

Milošević finally accepted the terms of an international peace plan on 3 June 1999, ending the Kosovo War. On 11 June, Milošević further accepted UN resolution 1244, under the mandate of which NATO then helped establish the KFOR peacekeeping force. Nearly one million refugees had fled Kosovo, and part of KFOR&#x27;s mandate was to protect the humanitarian missions, in addition to deterring violence. In August–September 2001, the alliance also mounted Operation Essential Harvest, a mission disarming ethnic Albanian militias in the Republic of Macedonia. , around 4,500 KFOR soldiers, representing 27 countries, continue to operate in the area.

===War in Afghanistan===
The September 11 attacks in the United States caused NATO to invoke Article 5 of the NATO Charter for the first time in the organization&#x27;s history. The Article states that an attack on any member shall be considered to be an attack on all. The invocation was confirmed on 4 October 2001 when NATO determined that the attacks were indeed eligible under the terms of the North Atlantic Treaty. The eight official actions taken by NATO in response to the attacks included Operation Eagle Assist and Operation Active Endeavour, a naval operation in the Mediterranean Sea designed to prevent the movement of terrorists or weapons of mass destruction, and to enhance the security of shipping in general, which began on 4 October 2001.

The alliance showed unity: on 16 April 2003, NATO agreed to take command of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), which included troops from 42 countries. The decision came at the request of Germany and the Netherlands, the two countries leading ISAF at the time of the agreement, and all nineteen NATO ambassadors approved it unanimously. The handover of control to NATO took place on 11 August, and marked the first time in NATO&#x27;s history that it took charge of a mission outside the north Atlantic area.

ISAF was initially charged with securing Kabul and surrounding areas from the Taliban, al Qaeda and factional warlords, so as to allow for the establishment of the Afghan Transitional Administration headed by Hamid Karzai. In October 2003, the UN Security Council authorized the expansion of the ISAF mission throughout Afghanistan, and ISAF subsequently expanded the mission in four main stages over the whole of the country.

On 31 July 2006, the ISAF additionally took over military operations in the south of Afghanistan from a US-led anti-terrorism coalition. Due to the intensity of the fighting in the south, in 2011 France allowed a squadron of Mirage 2000 fighter/attack aircraft to be moved into the area, to Kandahar, in order to reinforce the alliance&#x27;s efforts. During its 2012 Chicago Summit, NATO endorsed a plan to end the Afghanistan war and to remove the NATO-led ISAF Forces by the end of December 2014. ISAF was disestablished in December 2014 and replaced by the follow-on training Resolute Support Mission.

On 14 April 2021, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance had agreed to start withdrawing its troops from Afghanistan by 1 May. Soon after the withdrawal of NATO troops started, the Taliban launched an offensive against the Afghan government, quickly advancing in front of collapsing Afghan Armed Forces. By 15 August 2021, Taliban militants controlled the vast majority of Afghanistan and had encircled the capital city of Kabul. Some politicians in NATO member states have described the chaotic withdrawal of Western troops from Afghanistan and the collapse of the Afghan government as the greatest debacle that NATO has suffered since its founding.

===Iraq training mission===

In August 2004, during the Iraq War, NATO formed the NATO Training Mission – Iraq, a training mission to assist the Iraqi security forces in conjunction with the US-led MNF-I. The NATO Training Mission-Iraq (NTM-I) was established at the request of the Iraqi Interim Government under the provisions of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1546. The aim of NTM-I was to assist in the development of Iraqi security forces training structures and institutions so that Iraq can build an effective and sustainable capability that addresses the needs of the country. NTM-I was not a combat mission but is a distinct mission, under the political control of the North Atlantic Council. Its operational emphasis was on training and mentoring. The activities of the mission were coordinated with Iraqi authorities and the US-led Deputy Commanding General Advising and Training, who was also dual-hatted as the Commander of NTM-I. The mission officially concluded on 17 December 2011.

Turkey invoked the first Article 4 meetings in 2003 at the start of the Iraq War. Turkey also invoked this article twice in 2012 during the Syrian civil war, after the downing of an unarmed Turkish F-4 reconnaissance jet, and after a mortar was fired at Turkey from Syria, and again in 2015 after threats by Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant to its territorial integrity.

===Gulf of Aden anti-piracy===

In 2008 the United Nations Secretary-General called on member-states to protect the ships of , which was distributing aid as part of the World Food Programme mission in Somalia.

The North Atlantic Council and other countries, including Russia, China and South Korea, formed Operation Ocean Shield. The operation sought to dissuade and interrupt pirate attacks, protect vessels, and to increase the general level of security in the region.
Beginning on 17 August 2009, NATO deployed warships in an operation to protect maritime traffic in the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean from Somali pirates, and help strengthen the navies and coast guards of regional states.

===Libya intervention===

During the Libyan Civil War, violence between protesters and the Libyan government under Colonel Muammar Gaddafi escalated, and on 17 March 2011 led to the passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973, which called for a ceasefire, and authorized military action to protect civilians. A coalition that included several NATO members began enforcing a no-fly zone over Libya shortly afterwards, beginning with Opération Harmattan by the French Air Force on 19 March.

On 20 March 2011, NATO states agreed on enforcing an arms embargo against Libya with Operation Unified Protector using ships from NATO Standing Maritime Group 1 and Standing Mine Countermeasures Group 1, and additional ships and submarines from NATO members. They would &quot;monitor, report and, if needed, interdict vessels suspected of carrying illegal arms or mercenaries&quot;.

On 24 March, NATO agreed to take control of the no-fly zone from the initial coalition, while command of targeting ground units remained with the coalition&#x27;s forces. NATO began officially enforcing the UN resolution on 27 March 2011 with assistance from Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. By June, reports of divisions within the alliance surfaced as only eight of the 28 member states were participating in combat operations, resulting in a confrontation between US Defense Secretary Robert Gates and countries such as Poland, Spain, the Netherlands, Turkey, and Germany with Gates calling on the latter to contribute more and the latter believing the organization has overstepped its mandate in the conflict. In his final policy speech in Brussels on 10 June, Gates further criticized allied countries in suggesting their actions could cause the demise of NATO. The German foreign ministry pointed to &quot;a considerable [German] contribution to NATO and NATO-led operations&quot; and to the fact that this engagement was highly valued by President Obama.

While the mission was extended into September, Norway that day (10 June) announced it would begin scaling down contributions and complete withdrawal by 1 August. Earlier that week it was reported Danish air fighters were running out of bombs. The following week, the head of the Royal Navy said the country&#x27;s operations in the conflict were not sustainable. By the end of the mission in October 2011, after the death of Colonel Gaddafi, NATO planes had flown about 9,500 strike sorties against pro-Gaddafi targets. A report from the organization Human Rights Watch in May 2012 identified at least 72 civilians killed in the campaign.

Following a coup d&#x27;état attempt in October 2013, Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zeidan requested technical advice and trainers from NATO to assist with ongoing security issues.

===Turkish border===

Use of Article 5 has been threatened multiple times and four out of seven official Article 4 consultations have been called due to spillover in Turkey from the Syrian civil war. In April 2012, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan considered invoking Article 5 of the NATO treaty to protect Turkish national security in a dispute over the Syrian civil war. The alliance responded quickly, and a spokesperson said the alliance was &quot;monitoring the situation very closely and will continue to do so&quot; and &quot;takes it very seriously protecting its members.&quot;

After the shooting down of a Turkish military jet by Syria in June 2012 and Syrian forces shelling Turkish cities in October 2012 resulting in two Article 4 consultations, NATO approved Operation Active Fence. In the past decade the conflict has only escalated. In response to the 2015 Suruç bombing, which Turkey attributed to ISIS, and other security issues along its southern border, Turkey called for an emergency meeting. The latest consultation happened in February 2020, as part of increasing tensions due to the Northwestern Syria offensive, which involved Syrian and suspected Russian airstrikes on Turkish troops, and risked direct confrontation between Russia and a NATO member.

NATO has thirty-two members, mostly in Europe with two in North America. NATO&#x27;s &quot;area of responsibility&quot;, within which attacks on member states are eligible for an Article 5 response, is defined under Article 6 of the North Atlantic Treaty to include member territory in Europe, North America, Turkey, and islands in the North Atlantic north of the Tropic of Cancer. Attacks on vessels, aircraft and other forces in the North Atlantic (again, north of the Tropic of Cancer) and the Mediterranean Sea may also provoke an Article 5 response. During the original treaty negotiations, the United States insisted that colonies such as the Belgian Congo be excluded from the treaty. French Algeria was, however, covered until its independence on 3 July 1962. Twelve of these thirty-two are original members who joined in 1949, while the other twenty joined in one of ten enlargement rounds.

===Special arrangements===
The three Nordic countries which joined NATO as founding members, Denmark, Iceland, and Norway, chose to limit their participation in three areas: there would be no permanent peacetime bases, no nuclear warheads and no Allied military activity (unless invited) permitted on their territory. However, Denmark allows the U.S. Space Force to maintain Pituffik Space Base, in Greenland.

From the mid-1960s to the mid-1990s, France pursued a military strategy of independence from NATO under a policy dubbed &quot;Gaullo-Mitterrandism&quot;. Nicolas Sarkozy negotiated the return of France to the integrated military command and the Defence Planning Committee in 2009, the latter being disbanded the following year. France remains the only NATO member outside the Nuclear Planning Group and, unlike the United States and the United Kingdom, will not commit its nuclear-armed submarines to the alliance.

===Enlargement===

NATO was established on 4 April 1949 by the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty (Washington Treaty). The 12 founding members of the alliance were Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

Four new members joined during the Cold War: Greece (1952), Turkey (1952), West Germany (1955) and Spain (1982). Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, many former Warsaw Pact and post-Soviet states sought membership. In 1990, the territory of the former East Germany was added with the reunification of Germany. At the 1999 Washington summit, Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic officially joined, and NATO issued new guidelines for membership, with individualized &quot;Membership Action Plans&quot;. These plans governed the addition of new members: Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia in 2004, Albania and Croatia in 2009, Montenegro in 2017, and North Macedonia in 2020. Finland and Sweden are the newest members, joining on 4 April 2023 and 7 March 2024 respectively, spurred on by Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine.

Ukraine&#x27;s relationship with NATO began with the NATO–Ukraine Action Plan in 2002. In 2010, under President Viktor Yanukovych, Ukraine re-affirmed its non-aligned status and renounced aspirations of joining NATO. During the 2014 Ukrainian Revolution, Russia occupied Crimea and supported armed separatists in eastern Ukraine. As a result, in December 2014 Ukraine&#x27;s parliament voted to end its non-aligned status, and in 2019 it enshrined the goal of NATO membership in the Constitution. At the June 2021 Brussels Summit, NATO leaders affirmed that Ukraine would eventually join the Alliance, and supported Ukraine&#x27;s right to self-determination without interference. In late 2021, there was another massive Russian military buildup near Ukraine&#x27;s borders. On 30 November, Russian president Putin said Ukraine joining NATO, and the deployment of missile defense systems or long-range missiles in Ukraine, would be crossing a red line. However, there were no such plans to deploy missiles in Ukraine. The Russian Foreign Ministry drafted a treaty that would forbid Ukraine or any former Soviet state from ever joining NATO. Secretary-General Stoltenberg replied that the decision is up to Ukraine and NATO members, adding &quot;Russia has no veto, Russia has no say, and Russia has no right to establish a sphere of influence to try to control their neighbors&quot;. NATO offered to improve communications with Russia and discuss missile placements and military exercises, as long as Russia withdrew troops from Ukraine&#x27;s borders. Instead, Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Ukraine applied for NATO membership in September 2022 after Russia proclaimed it had annexed the country&#x27;s southeast.

Georgia was promised &quot;future membership&quot; during the 2008 summit in Bucharest, but US president Barack Obama said in 2014 that the country was not &quot;currently on a path&quot; to membership.

Russia continued to politically oppose further expansion, seeing it as inconsistent with informal understandings between Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and European and US negotiators that allowed for a peaceful German reunification. A June 2016 Levada Center poll found that 68 percent of Russians think that deploying NATO troops in the Baltic states and Poland – former Eastern bloc countries bordering Russia – is a threat to Russia. In contrast, 65 percent of Poles surveyed in a 2017 Pew Research Center report identified Russia as a &quot;major threat&quot;, with an average of 31 percent saying so across all NATO countries, and 67 percent of Poles surveyed in 2018 favour US forces being based in Poland. Of non-CIS Eastern European countries surveyed by Gallup in 2016, all but Serbia and Montenegro were more likely than not to view NATO as a protective alliance rather than a threat. A 2006 study in the journal &quot;Security Studies&quot; argued that NATO enlargement contributed to democratic consolidation in Central and Eastern Europe. China also opposes further expansion.

===NATO defence expenditure===

====Direct contributions====
Member states pay for NATO&#x27;s three common funds (the civil and military budgets and the security investment programme) based on a cost-sharing formula that includes per capita gross national income and other factors. In 2023–2024, the United States and Germany were the biggest contributors with 16.2% each.

====Indirect contributions====
Member states pay for and maintain their own troops and equipment. They contribute to NATO operations and missions by committing troops and equipment on a voluntary basis. Since 2006, the goal has been for each country to spend at least 2 percent of its gross domestic product on its own defence; in 2014, a NATO declaration said that countries not meeting the goal would &quot;aim to move towards the 2 percent guideline within a decade&quot;. In July 2022, NATO estimated that 11 members would meet the target in 2023. On 14 February 2024, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that 18 member states would meet the 2% target in 2024. On 17 June 2024, prior to the 2024 Washington summit, Stoltenberg updated that figure and announced that a record 23 of 32 NATO member states were meeting their defense spending targets of 2% of their country&#x27;s GDP. NATO added that defense spending for European member states and Canada was up 18% in the past year alone.

==Partnerships with third countries==

The Partnership for Peace (PfP) programme was established in 1994 and is based on individual bilateral relations between each partner country and NATO: each country may choose the extent of its participation. Members include all current and former members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. The Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC) was first established on 29 May 1997, and is a forum for regular coordination, consultation and dialogue between all fifty participants. The PfP programme is considered the operational wing of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership. Other third countries have also been contacted for participation in some activities of the PfP framework, such as Afghanistan.

The European Union (EU) signed a comprehensive package of arrangements with NATO under the Berlin Plus agreement on 16 December 2002. With this agreement, the EU was given the possibility of using NATO assets if it wanted to act independently in an international crisis, on the condition that NATO itself did not want to act – the so-called &quot;right of first refusal&quot;. For example, Article 42(7) of the 1982 Treaty of Lisbon specifies that &quot;If a Member State is the victim of armed aggression on its territory, the other Member States shall have towards it an obligation of aid and assistance by all the means in their power&quot;. The treaty applies globally to specified territories, whereas NATO is restricted under its Article 6 to operations north of the Tropic of Cancer. It provides a &quot;double framework&quot; for the EU countries that are also linked with the PfP programme.

Additionally, NATO cooperates and discusses its activities with numerous other non-NATO members. The Mediterranean Dialogue was established in 1994 to coordinate in a similar way with Israel and countries in North Africa. The Istanbul Cooperation Initiative was announced in 2004 as a dialogue forum for the Middle East along the same lines as the Mediterranean Dialogue. The four participants are also linked through the Gulf Cooperation Council. In June 2018, Qatar expressed a wish to join NATO, who ruled it out, saying that only additional European countries could join according to Article 10 of NATO&#x27;s founding treaty. Qatar and NATO had earlier signed a joint security agreement, in January 2018.

Political dialogue with Japan began in 1990, and since then, the Alliance has gradually increased its contact with countries that do not form part of any of these cooperation initiatives. In 1998, NATO established a set of general guidelines that do not allow for a formal institutionalization of relations, but reflect the Allies&#x27; desire to increase cooperation. Following extensive debate, the term &quot;Contact Countries&quot; was agreed by the Allies in 2000. By 2012, the Alliance had broadened this group, which meets to discuss issues such as counter-piracy and technology exchange, under the names &quot;global partners&quot; or &quot;partners across the globe&quot;. Australia and New Zealand, both contact countries, are also members of the AUSCANNZUKUS strategic alliance, and similar regional or bilateral agreements between contact countries and NATO members also aid cooperation. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg stated that NATO needs to &quot;address the rise of China&quot;, by closely cooperating with Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea. Colombia is NATO&#x27;s latest partner and has access to the full range of cooperative activities offered; it is the first and only Latin American country to cooperate with NATO.

==Structure==

All agencies and organizations of NATO are integrated into either the civilian administrative or military executive roles. For the most part, they perform roles and functions that directly or indirectly support the security role of the alliance as a whole.

The civilian structure includes:
* The North Atlantic Council (NAC) is the body which has effective governance authority and powers of decision in NATO, consisting of member states&#x27; permanent representatives or representatives at higher level (ministers of foreign affairs or defence, or heads of state or government). The NAC convenes at least once a week and takes major decisions regarding NATO&#x27;s policies. The meetings of the North Atlantic Council are chaired by the secretary general and, when decisions have to be made, action is agreed upon by consensus. There is no voting or decision by majority. Each state represented at the Council table or on any of its subordinate committees retains complete sovereignty and responsibility for its own decisions.
* The NATO Parliamentary Assembly (NATO PA) is a body that sets broad strategic goals for NATO, which meets at two session per year. NATO PA interacts directly with the parliamentary structures of the national governments of the member states which appoint Permanent Members, or ambassadors to NATO. The NATO Parliamentary Assembly is made up of legislators from the member countries of the North Atlantic Alliance as well as thirteen associate members. It is however officially a structure different from NATO, and has as aim to join deputies of NATO countries in order to discuss security policies on the NATO Council.
* NATO headquarters, located on Boulevard Léopold III/Leopold III-laan, B-1110 Brussels, which is in the City of Brussels municipality. The staff at the Headquarters is composed of national delegations of member countries and includes civilian and military liaison offices and officers or diplomatic missions and diplomats of partner countries, as well as the International Staff and International Military Staff filled from serving members of the armed forces of member states. Non-governmental groups have also grown up in support of NATO, broadly under the banner of the Atlantic Council/Atlantic Treaty Association movement.
The military structure includes:
* The Military Committee (MC) is the body of NATO that is composed of member states&#x27; Chiefs of Defence (CHOD) and advises the North Atlantic Council (NAC) on military policy and strategy. The national CHODs are regularly represented in the MC by their permanent Military Representatives (MilRep), who often are two- or three-star flag officers. Like the council, from time to time the Military Committee also meets at a higher level, namely at the level of Chiefs of Defence, the most senior military officer in each country&#x27;s armed forces. The MC is led by its chairman, who directs NATO&#x27;s military operations. Until 2008 the Military Committee excluded France, due to that country&#x27;s 1966 decision to remove itself from the NATO Military Command Structure, which it rejoined in 1995. Until France rejoined NATO, it was not represented on the Defence Planning Committee, and this led to conflicts between it and NATO members. Such was the case in the lead up to Operation Iraqi Freedom.
* Allied Command Operations (ACO) is the NATO command responsible for NATO operations worldwide.
* The Rapid Deployable Corps include Eurocorps, I. German/Dutch Corps, Multinational Corps Northeast, and NATO Rapid Deployable Italian Corps among others, as well as naval High Readiness Forces (HRFs), which all report to Allied Command Operations.
* Allied Command Transformation (ACT), responsible for transformation and training of NATO forces.

===Legal authority of NATO commanders===
NATO is an alliance of 32 sovereign states and their individual sovereignty is unaffected by participation in the alliance. NATO has no parliaments, no laws, no enforcement, and no power to punish individual citizens. As a consequence of this lack of sovereignty the power and authority of a NATO commander are limited. NATO commanders cannot punish offences such as failure to obey a lawful order; dereliction of duty; or disrespect to a senior officer. NATO commanders expect obedience but sometimes need to subordinate their desires or plans to the operators who are themselves subject to sovereign codes of conduct like the UCMJ. A case in point was the clash between General Sir Mike Jackson and General Wesley Clark over KFOR actions at Pristina Airport.

NATO commanders can issue orders to their subordinate commanders in the form of operational plans (OPLANs), operational orders (OPORDERs), tactical direction, or fragmental orders (FRAGOs) and others. The joint rules of engagement must be followed, and the Law of Armed Conflict must be obeyed at all times. Operational resources &quot;remain under national command but have been transferred temporarily to NATO. Although these national units, through the formal process of transfer of authority, have been placed under the operational command and control of a NATO commander, they never lose their national character.&quot; Senior national representatives, like CDS, &quot;are designated as so-called red-cardholders&quot;. Caveats are restrictions listed &quot;nation by nation... that NATO Commanders... must take into account&quot;.

<text>New Hampshire ( ) is a state in the New England region of the Northeastern United States. It borders Massachusetts to the south, Vermont to the west, Maine and the Gulf of Maine to the east, and the Canadian province of Quebec to the north. Of the 50 U.S. states, New Hampshire is the seventh-smallest by land area and the tenth-least populous, with a population of 1,377,529 residents as of the 2020 census. Concord is the state capital and Manchester is the most populous city. New Hampshire&#x27;s motto, &quot;Live Free or Die&quot;, reflects its role in the American Revolutionary War; its nickname, &quot;The Granite State&quot;, refers to its extensive granite formations and quarries. It is well known nationwide for holding the first primary (after the Iowa caucus) in the U.S. presidential election cycle, and for its resulting influence on American electoral politics.

New Hampshire was inhabited for thousands of years by Algonquian-speaking peoples such as the Abenaki. Europeans arrived in the early 17th century, with the English establishing some of the earliest non-indigenous settlements. The Province of New Hampshire was established in 1629, named after the English county of Hampshire. Following mounting tensions between the British colonies and the crown during the 1760s, New Hampshire saw one of the earliest overt acts of rebellion, with the seizing of Fort William and Mary from the British in 1774. In January 1776, it became the first of the British North American colonies to establish an independent government and state constitution; six months later, it signed the United States Declaration of Independence and contributed troops, ships, and supplies in the war against Britain. In June 1788, it was the ninth state to ratify the U.S. Constitution, bringing that document into effect. Through the mid-19th century, New Hampshire was an active center of abolitionism, and fielded close to 32,000 Union soldiers during the U.S. Civil War. After the war, the state saw rapid industrialization and population growth, becoming a center of textile manufacturing, shoemaking, and papermaking; the Amoskeag Manufacturing Company in Manchester was at one time the largest cotton textile plant in the world. The Merrimack and Connecticut rivers were lined with industrial mills, most of which employed workers from Canada and Europe; French Canadians formed the most significant influx of immigrants, and today roughly a quarter of all New Hampshire residents have French American ancestry, a statistic second only to Maine among states.

Reflecting a nationwide trend, New Hampshire&#x27;s industrial sector declined after World War II. Since 1950, its economy has diversified to include financial and professional services, real estate, education, transportation and high-tech, with manufacturing still higher than the national average. Beginning in the 1950s, its population surged as major highways connected it to Greater Boston and led to more commuter towns. New Hampshire is among the wealthiest and most-educated states. It is one of nine states without an income tax and has no taxes on sales, capital gains, or inheritance while relying heavily on local property taxes to fund education; consequently, its state tax burden is among the lowest in the country. It ranks among the top ten states in metrics such as governance, healthcare, socioeconomic opportunity, and fiscal stability. It is known to be one of the less liberal leaning states in New England and have more of a libertarian-leaning political culture; it was until recently a swing state in presidential elections. The New Hampshire Republican Party has held a trifecta majority in state level government since 2017, with the exception of 2019 and 2020, while the Democratic Party has held a majority on New Hampshire&#x27;s federal level representation in Congress.

With its mountainous and heavily forested terrain, New Hampshire has a growing tourism sector centered on outdoor recreation. It has some of the highest ski mountains on the East Coast and is a major destination for winter sports; Mount Monadnock is among the most climbed mountains in the world. Other activities include observing the fall foliage, summer cottages along many lakes and the seacoast, motorsports at the New Hampshire Motor Speedway in Loudon, and Motorcycle Week, a popular motorcycle rally held in Weirs Beach in Laconia and the oldest in the United States. The White Mountain National Forest includes most of the Appalachian Trail between Vermont and Maine, and has the Mount Washington Auto Road, where visitors may drive to the top of Mount Washington.

==History==
Various Algonquian-speaking Abenaki tribes, largely divided between the Androscoggin, Cowasuck and Pennacook nations, inhabited the area before European colonization. Despite the similar language, they had a very different culture and religion from other Algonquian peoples.
Indigenous people lived near Keene, New Hampshire 12,000 years ago, according to 2009 archaeological digs, and the Abenaki were present in New Hampshire in pre-colonial times.

English and French explorers visited New Hampshire in 1600–1605, and David Thompson settled at Odiorne&#x27;s Point in present-day Rye in 1623. The first permanent European settlement was at Hilton&#x27;s Point (present-day Dover). By 1631, the Upper Plantation comprised modern-day Dover, Durham and Stratham; in 1679, it became the &quot;Royal Province&quot;. Father Rale&#x27;s War was fought between the colonists and the Wabanaki Confederacy throughout New Hampshire.
New Hampshire was one of the Thirteen Colonies that rebelled against British rule during the American Revolution. During the American Revolution, New Hampshire was economically divided. The Seacoast region revolved around sawmills, shipyards, merchants&#x27; warehouses, and established village and town centers, where wealthy merchants built substantial homes, furnished them with luxuries, and invested their capital in trade and land speculation. At the other end of the social scale, there developed a permanent class of day laborers, mariners, indentured servants and slaves.

In December 1774, Paul Revere warned Patriots that Fort William and Mary would be reinforced with British troops. The following day, John Sullivan raided the fort for weapons. During the raid, the British soldiers fired at rebels with cannon and muskets, but there were apparently no casualties. These were among the first shots in the American Revolutionary period, occurring approximately five months before the Battles of Lexington and Concord. On January 5, 1776, New Hampshire became the first colony to declare independence from Great Britain, almost six months before the Declaration of Independence was signed by the Continental Congress.

The United States Constitution was ratified by New Hampshire on June 21, 1788, when New Hampshire became the ninth state to do so.

New Hampshire was a Jacksonian stronghold; the state sent Franklin Pierce to the White House in the election of 1852. Industrialization took the form of numerous textile mills, which in turn attracted large flows of immigrants from Quebec (the &quot;French Canadians&quot;) and Ireland. The northern parts of the state produced lumber, and the mountains provided tourist attractions. After 1960, the textile industry collapsed, but the economy rebounded as a center of high technology and as a service provider.

Starting in 1952, New Hampshire gained national and international attention for its presidential primary held early in every presidential election year. It immediately became an important testing ground for candidates for the Republican and Democratic nominations but did not necessarily guarantee victory. The media gave New Hampshire and Iowa significant attention compared to other states in the primary process, magnifying the state&#x27;s decision powers and spurring repeated efforts by out-of-state politicians to change the rules.

==Geography==


New Hampshire is part of the six-state New England region of the Northeastern United States. It is bounded by Quebec, Canada, to the north and northwest; Maine and the Gulf of Maine to the east; Massachusetts to the south; and Vermont to the west. New Hampshire&#x27;s major regions are the Great North Woods, the White Mountains, the Lakes Region, the Seacoast, the Merrimack Valley, the Monadnock Region, and the Dartmouth-Lake Sunapee area. New Hampshire has the shortest ocean coastline of any U.S. coastal state, with a length of , sometimes measured as only .

The White Mountains range in New Hampshire spans the north-central portion of the state. The range includes Mount Washington, the tallest in the northeastern U.S.—site of the second-highest wind speed ever recorded— as well as Mount Adams and Mount Jefferson. With hurricane-force winds every third day on average, more than a hundred recorded deaths among visitors, and conspicuous krumholtz (dwarf, matted trees much like a carpet of bonsai trees), the climate on the upper reaches of Mount Washington has inspired the weather observatory on the peak to claim that the area has the &quot;World&#x27;s Worst Weather&quot;. The White Mountains were home to the rock formation called the Old Man of the Mountain, a face-like profile in Franconia Notch, until the formation disintegrated in May 2003. Even after its loss, the Old Man remains an enduring symbol for the state, seen on state highway signs, automobile license plates, and many government and private entities around New Hampshire.

In southwestern New Hampshire, the landmark Mount Monadnock has given its name to a class of earth-forms—a &quot;monadnock&quot;—signifying, in geomorphology, any isolated resistant peak rising from a less resistant eroded plain.

New Hampshire has more than 800 lakes and ponds, and approximately of rivers and streams. Major rivers include the Merrimack River, which bisects the lower half of the state north–south before passing into Massachusetts and reaching the sea in Newburyport. Its tributaries include the Contoocook River, Pemigewasset River, and Winnipesaukee River. The Connecticut River, which starts at New Hampshire&#x27;s Connecticut Lakes and flows south to Connecticut, defines the western border with Vermont. The state border is not in the center of that river, as is usually the case, but at the low-water mark on the Vermont side; meaning the entire river along the Vermont border (save for areas where the water level has been raised by a dam) lies within New Hampshire. Only one town—Pittsburg—shares a land border with the state of Vermont. The &quot;northwesternmost headwaters&quot; of the Connecticut also define part of the Canada–U.S. border.

The Piscataqua River and its several tributaries form the state&#x27;s only significant ocean port where they flow into the Atlantic at Portsmouth. The Salmon Falls River and the Piscataqua define the southern portion of the border with Maine. The Piscataqua River boundary was the subject of a border dispute between New Hampshire and Maine in 2001, with New Hampshire claiming dominion over several islands (primarily Seavey&#x27;s Island) that include the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. The U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the case in 2002, leaving ownership of the island with Maine. New Hampshire still claims sovereignty of the base, however.

The largest of New Hampshire&#x27;s lakes is Lake Winnipesaukee, which covers in the east-central part of New Hampshire. Umbagog Lake along the Maine border, approximately , is a distant second. Squam Lake is the second largest lake entirely in New Hampshire.

New Hampshire has the shortest ocean coastline of any state in the United States, approximately long. Hampton Beach is a popular local summer destination. About offshore are the Isles of Shoals, nine small islands (four of which are in New Hampshire) known as the site of a 19th-century art colony founded by poet Celia Thaxter, and the alleged location of one of the buried treasures of the pirate Blackbeard.

It is the state with the highest percentage of timberland area in the country. New Hampshire is in the temperate broadleaf and mixed forests biome. Much of the state, in particular the White Mountains, is covered by the conifers and northern hardwoods of the New England-Acadian forests. The southeast corner of the state and parts of the Connecticut River along the Vermont border are covered by the mixed oaks of the Northeastern coastal forests. The state&#x27;s numerous forests are popular among autumnal leaf peepers seeking the brilliant foliage of the numerous deciduous trees.

The northern third of the state is locally referred to as the &quot;north country&quot; or &quot;north of the notches&quot;, in reference to the White Mountain passes that channel traffic. It contains less than 5% of the state&#x27;s population, suffers relatively high poverty, and is steadily losing population as the logging and paper industries decline. However, the tourist industry, in particular visitors who go to northern New Hampshire to ski, snowboard, hike and mountain bike, has helped offset economic losses from mill closures.

Environmental protection emerged as a key state issue in the early 1900s in response to poor logging practices. In the 1970s, activists defeated a proposal to build an oil refinery along the coast and limited plans for a full-width interstate highway through Franconia Notch to a parkway.

Winter season lengths are projected to decline at ski areas across New Hampshire due to the effects of climate change, which is likely to continue the historic contraction and consolidation of the ski industry and threaten individual ski businesses and communities that rely on ski tourism.

===Flora and fauna===

Black bears, white-tailed deer, and moose can be found all over New Hampshire. There are also less-common animals such as the marten and the Canadian lynx.

===Climate===
New Hampshire experiences a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfa&quot; in some southern areas, &quot;Dfb&quot; in most of the state, and &quot;Dfc&quot; subarctic in some northern highland areas), with warm, humid summers, and long, cold, and snowy winters. Precipitation is fairly evenly distributed all year. The climate of the southeastern portion is moderated by the Atlantic Ocean and averages relatively milder winters (for New Hampshire), while the northern and interior portions experience colder temperatures and lower humidity. Winters are cold and snowy throughout the state, and especially severe in the northern and mountainous areas. Average annual snowfall ranges from to over across the state.

Average daytime highs are in the mid 70s°F to low 80s°F (24–28 °C) throughout the state in July, with overnight lows in the mid 50s°F to low 60s°F (13–15 °C). January temperatures range from an average high of on the coast to overnight lows below in the far north and at high elevations. Average annual precipitation statewide is roughly with some variation occurring in the White Mountains due to differences in elevation and annual snowfall. New Hampshire&#x27;s highest recorded temperature was in Nashua on July 4, 1911, while the lowest recorded temperature was atop Mount Washington on January 29, 1934. Mount Washington also saw an unofficial reading on January 22, 1885, which, if made official, would tie the record low for New England (also at Big Black River, Maine, on January 16, 2009, and Bloomfield, Vermont on December 30, 1933).

Extreme snow is often associated with a nor&#x27;easter, such as the Blizzard of &#x27;78 and the Blizzard of 1993, when several feet accumulated across portions of the state over 24 to 48 hours. Lighter snowfalls of several inches occur frequently throughout winter, often associated with an Alberta Clipper.

New Hampshire, on occasion, is affected by hurricanes and tropical storms—although, by the time they reach the state, they are often extratropical—with most storms striking the southern New England coastline and moving inland or passing by offshore in the Gulf of Maine. Most of New Hampshire averages fewer than 20 days of thunderstorms per year and an average of two tornadoes occur annually statewide.

The National Arbor Day Foundation plant hardiness zone map depicts zones 3, 4, 5, and6 occurring throughout the state and indicates the transition from a relatively cooler to warmer climate as one travels southward across New Hampshire. The 1990 USDA plant hardiness zones for New Hampshire range from zone 3b in the north to zone 5b in the south.

==Demographics==
===Population===

As of the 2020 census, the resident population of New Hampshire was 1,377,529, a 4.6% increase since the 2010 United States Census. The center of population of New Hampshire is in Merrimack County, in the town of Pembroke. The center of population has moved south since 1950, a reflection of the fact that the state&#x27;s fastest growth has been along its southern border, which is within commuting range of Boston and other Massachusetts cities.

As indicated in the census, in 2020 88.3% of the population were White; 1.5% were Black or African American; 0.2% were Native American or Alaskan Native; 2.6% were Asian; 0.0% were Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander; 1.7% were some other race; and 5.6% were two or more races. 4.3% of the total population were Hispanic or Latino of any race. 18.6% of the population were under 18 years of age; 19.3% were 65 years and over. The female population was 50.5%.

The most densely populated areas generally lie within of the Massachusetts border, and are concentrated in two areas: along the Merrimack River Valley running from Concord to Nashua, and in the Seacoast Region along an axis stretching from Rochester to Portsmouth. Outside of those two regions, only one community, the city of Keene, has a population of over 20,000. The four counties covering these two areas account for 72% of the state population, and one (Hillsborough) has nearly 30% of the state population, as well as the two most populous communities, Manchester and Nashua. The northern portion of the state is very sparsely populated: the largest county by area, Coos, covers the northern one-fourth of the state and has only around 31,000 people, about a third of whom live in a single community (Berlin). The trends over the past several decades have been for the population to shift southward, as many northern communities lack the economic base to maintain their populations, while southern communities have been absorbed by the Greater Boston metropolis. 
As of the 2010 census, the population of New Hampshire was 1,316,470. The gender makeup of the state at that time was 49.3% male and 50.7% female. 21.8% of the population were under the age of 18; 64.6% were between the ages of 18 and 64; and 13.5% were 65 years of age or older. Additionally, about 57.3% of the population was born out of state.

According to HUD&#x27;s 2022 Annual Homeless Assessment Report, there were an estimated 1,605 homeless people in New Hampshire.

Hispanic or Latino of any race were 2.8% of the population in 2010: 0.6% were of Mexican, 0.9% Puerto Rican, 0.1% Cuban, and 1.2% other Hispanic or Latino origin. As of 2020, the Hispanic or Latino population was counted as 4.3%. The Native American/Alaska native population is listed as 0.3% in the 2020 census, but may be higher.

According to the 2012–2017 American Community Survey, the largest ancestry groups in the state were Irish (20.6%), English (16.5%), French (14.0%), Italian (10.4%), German (9.1%), French Canadian (8.9%), and American (4.8%).

New Hampshire has the highest percentage (22.9%) of residents with French/French Canadian/Acadian ancestry of any U.S. state.

In 2018, the top countries of origin for New Hampshire&#x27;s immigrants were India, Canada, China, Nepal and the Dominican Republic.

According to the Census Bureau&#x27;s American Community Survey estimates from 2017, 2.1% of the population aged5 and older speak Spanish at home, while 1.8% speak French. In Coös County, 9.6% of the population speaks French at home, down from 16% in 2000. In the city of Nashua, Hillsborough County, 8.02% of the population speaks Spanish at home.
===Birth data===
&quot;Note: Percentages in the table do not add up to 100, because Hispanics are counted both by their ethnicity and by their race, giving a higher overall number.&quot;
* Since 2016, data for births of White Hispanic origin are not collected, but included in one &quot;Hispanic&quot; group; persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race.

In 2022, New Hampshire had the lowest teen birth rate of any state, at 4.6 births per 1,000 females ages 15 to 19 years of age.

===Religion===
A Pew survey in 2014 showed that the religious affiliations of the people of New Hampshire was as follows: nonreligious 36%, Protestant 30%, Catholic 26%, Jehovah&#x27;s Witness 2%, LDS (Mormon) 1%, and Jewish 1%.

A survey suggests people in New Hampshire and Vermont are less likely than other Americans to attend weekly services and only 54% say they are &quot;absolutely certain there is a God&quot; compared to 71% in the rest of the nation. New Hampshire and Vermont are also at the lowest levels among states in religious commitment. In 2012, 23% of New Hampshire residents in a Gallup poll considered themselves &quot;very religious&quot;, while 52% considered themselves &quot;non-religious&quot;. According to the Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA) in 2010, the largest denominations were the Catholic Church with 311,028 members; the United Church of Christ with 26,321 members; and the United Methodist Church with 18,029 members.

In 2016, a Gallup Poll found that New Hampshire was the least religious state in the United States. Only 20% of respondents in New Hampshire categorized themselves as &quot;very religious&quot;, while the nationwide average was 40%.

According to the 2020 Public Religion Research Institute study, 64% of the population was Christian, dominated by Roman Catholicism and evangelical Protestantism. In contrast with varying studies of estimated irreligiosity, the Public Religion Research Institute reported that irreligion declined from 36% at the separate 2014 Pew survey to 25% of the population in 2020. In 2021, the unaffiliated increased to 40% of the population, although Christianity altogether made up 54% of the total population (Catholics, Protestants, and Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses).

==Economy==
* Total employment (2016): 594,243
* Number of employer establishments: 37,868

The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that New Hampshire&#x27;s total state product in 2018 was $86billion, ranking 40th in the United States. Median household income in 2017 was $74,801, the fourth highest in the country (including Washington, DC). Its agricultural outputs are dairy products, nursery stock, cattle, apples and eggs. Its industrial outputs are machinery, electric equipment, rubber and plastic products, and tourism is a major component of the economy.

New Hampshire experienced a major shift in its economic base during the 20th century. Historically, the base was composed of traditional New England textiles, shoemaking, and small machine shops, drawing upon low-wage labor from nearby small farms and parts of Quebec. Today, of the state&#x27;s total manufacturing dollar value, these sectors contribute only two percent for textiles, two percent for leather goods, and nine percent for machining. They experienced a sharp decline due to obsolete plants and the lure of cheaper wages in the Southern United States.

New Hampshire today has a broad-based and growing economy, with a state GDP growth rate of 2.2% in 2018. The state&#x27;s largest economic sectors in 2018, based on contribution to GDP, are: 15% real estate and rental and leasing; 13% professional business services; 12% manufacturing; 10% government and government services; and 9% health care and social services.

The state&#x27;s budget in FY2018 was $5.97billion, including $1.79billion in federal funds. The state has a property tax (subject to municipal control) but no broad sales tax or income tax. The state does have narrower taxes on meals, lodging, vehicles, and business income; and has tolls on some expressways. Though there is no broad-based state tax, local jurisdictions have the U.S.&#x27;s 8th-highest property taxes as of a 2019 ranking by the Tax Foundation. However, the state&#x27;s overall tax burden is relatively low; in 2010 New Hampshire ranked 8th-lowest among states in combined average state and local tax burden.

According to the Energy Information Administration, New Hampshire&#x27;s energy consumption and per capita energy consumption are among the lowest in the country. The Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant, near Portsmouth, is the largest individual electrical generating unit on the New England power grid and provided 57% of New Hampshire&#x27;s electricity generation in 2017. Power generation from wind power increased strongly in 2012 and 2013, but remained rather flat for the next ten years at around 4% of consumption. In 2016, 2017 and at least 2019–2022, New Hampshire obtained more of its electricity generation from wind power than from coal-fired power plants. Hydroelectric power and biomass are other important renewable resources in the state. New Hampshire was a net exporter of electricity, exporting .

New Hampshire&#x27;s residential electricity use is low compared with the national average, in part because demand for air conditioning is low during the generally mild summer months and because few households use electricity as their primary energy source for home heating. Nearly half of New Hampshire households use fuel oil for winter heating, which is one of the largest shares in the United States. New Hampshire has potential for renewable energies like wind power, hydroelectricity, and wood fuel.

The (preliminary) seasonally unemployment rate in April 2019 was 2.4% based on a 767,500 person civilian workforce with 749,000 people in employment. New Hampshire&#x27;s workforce is 90% in nonfarm employment, with 18% employed in trade, transportation, and utilities; 17% in education and health care; 12% in government; 11% in professional and business services; and 10% in leisure and hospitality.

===Largest employers===
In March 2018, 86% of New Hampshire&#x27;s workforce were employed by the private sector, with 53% of those workers being employed by firms with fewer than 100 employees. About 14% of private-sector employees are employed by firms with more than 1,000 employees.

According to community surveys by the Economic &amp; Labor Market Information Bureau of NH Employment Security, the following are the largest private employers in the state as of 2018:
New Hampshire&#x27;s state government employs approximately 6,100 people. Additionally, the U.S. Department of State employs approximately 1,600 people at the National Visa Center and National Passport Center in Portsmouth, which process United States immigrant visa petitions and United States passport applications.

==Law and government==

The governor of New Hampshire, since January 9, 2025, is Republican Kelly Ayotte. New Hampshire&#x27;s two U.S. senators are Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan, both of whom are Democrats and former governors. New Hampshire&#x27;s two U.S. representatives as of January 2025 are Chris Pappas and Maggie Goodlander, both Democrats.

New Hampshire is an alcoholic beverage control state, and through the State Liquor Commission takes in $100million from the sale and distribution of liquor.

New Hampshire is the only state in the U.S. that does not require adults to wear seat belts in their vehicles. It is one of three states that have no mandatory helmet law.

===Governing documents===
The New Hampshire State Constitution of 1783 is the supreme law of the state, followed by the New Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated and the New Hampshire Code of Administrative Rules. These are roughly analogous to the federal United States Constitution, United States Code and Code of Federal Regulations respectively.

===Branches of government===
New Hampshire has a bifurcated executive branch, consisting of the governor and a five-member executive council which votes on state contracts worth more than $5,000 and &quot;advises and consents&quot; to the governor&#x27;s nominations to major state positions such as department heads and all judgeships and pardon requests. New Hampshire does not have a lieutenant governor; the Senate president serves as &quot;acting governor&quot; whenever the governor is unable to perform the duties.

The legislature is called the General Court. It consists of the House of Representatives and the Senate. There are 400 representatives, making it one of the largest elected bodies in the English-speaking world, and 24 senators. Legislators are paid a nominal salary of $200 per two-year term plus travel costs, the lowest in the U.S. by far. Thus most are effectively volunteers, nearly half of whom are retirees. (For details, see the article on Government of New Hampshire.)

The state&#x27;s sole appellate court is the New Hampshire Supreme Court. The Superior Court is the court of general jurisdiction and the only court which provides for jury trials in civil or criminal cases. The other state courts are the Probate Court, District Court, and the Family Division.

===Local government===
New Hampshire has 10 counties and 234 cities and towns.

New Hampshire is a &quot;Dillon Rule&quot; state, meaning the state retains all powers not specifically granted to municipalities. Even so, the legislature strongly favors local control, particularly concerning land use regulations. New Hampshire municipalities are classified as towns or cities, which differ primarily by the form of government. Most towns generally operate on the town meeting form of government, where the registered voters in the town act as the town legislature, and a board of selectmen acts as the executive of the town. Larger towns and the state&#x27;s thirteen cities operate either on a council–manager or council–mayor form of government. There is no difference, from the state government&#x27;s point of view, between towns and cities besides the form of government. All state-level statutes treat all municipalities identically.

New Hampshire has a small number of unincorporated areas that are titled as grants, locations, purchases, or townships. These locations have limited to no self-government, and services are generally provided for them by neighboring towns or the county or state where needed. As of the 2000 census, there were 25 of these left in New Hampshire, accounting for a total population of 173 people (); several were entirely depopulated. All but two of these unincorporated areas are in Coös County.

===Politics===
New Hampshire is known for its fiscal conservatism and cultural liberalism. The state&#x27;s politics are cited as libertarian leaning. It is the least religious state in the Union as of a 2016 Gallup poll. The state has long had a great disdain for state taxation and state bureaucracy.

The Democratic Party and the Republican Party, in that order, are the two largest parties in the state. A plurality of voters are registered as undeclared, and can choose either ballot in the primary and then regain their undeclared status after voting. The Libertarian Party had official party status from 1990 to 1996 and from 2016 to 2018. A movement known as the Free State Project suggests libertarians move to the state to concentrate their power. As of August 30, 2022, there were 869,863 registered voters, of whom 332,008 (38.17%) did not declare a political party affiliation, 273,921 (31.49%) were Democratic, and 263,934 (30.34%) were Republican.

As of 2025, the Republican Party controls the governorship, the Executive Council, and both houses of the legislature. However, the Democratic Party controls all four seats in the state&#x27;s delegation to Congress.

====New Hampshire primary====
New Hampshire is internationally known for the New Hampshire primary, the first primary in the quadrennial American presidential election cycle. State law requires that the Secretary of State schedule this election at least one week before any &quot;similar event&quot;. While the Iowa caucus precedes the New Hampshire primary, the New Hampshire election is the nation&#x27;s first contest that uses the same procedure as the general election, draws more attention than those in other states, and has been decisive in shaping the national contest.

In February 2023, the Democratic National Committee awarded that party&#x27;s first primary to South Carolina, to be held on February 3, 2024, directing New Hampshire and Nevada to vote three days later. New Hampshire political leaders from both parties have vowed to stand by the state&#x27;s &quot;first in the nation&quot; law and ignore the DNC.

State law permits a town with fewer than 100 residents to open its polls at midnight and close when all registered citizens have cast their ballots. As such, the communities of Dixville Notch in Coos County and Hart&#x27;s Location in Carroll County, among others, have chosen to implement these provisions. Dixville Notch and Hart&#x27;s Location are traditionally the first places in both New Hampshire and the U.S. to vote in presidential primaries and elections.

Nominations for all other partisan offices are decided in a separate primary election. In Presidential election cycles, this is the second primary election held in New Hampshire.

Saint Anselm College in Goffstown has become a popular campaign spot for politicians as well as several national presidential debates because of its proximity to Manchester-Boston Regional Airport.

====Elections====


In the past, New Hampshire has often voted Republican. Between 1856 and 1988, New Hampshire cast its electoral votes for the Democratic presidential ticket six times: Woodrow Wilson (twice), Franklin D. Roosevelt (three times), and Lyndon B. Johnson (once).

Beginning in 1992, New Hampshire became a swing state in national and local elections, and in that time has supported Democrats in all presidential elections except 2000. It was the only state in the country to switch from supporting Republican George W. Bush in the 2000 election to supporting his Democratic challenger in the 2004 election, when John Kerry, a senator from neighboring Massachusetts, won the state.

The Democrats dominated elections in New Hampshire in 2006 and 2008. In 2006, Democrats won both congressional seats (electing Carol Shea-Porter in the first district and Paul Hodes in the second), re-elected Governor John Lynch, and gained a majority on the Executive Council and in both houses for the first time since 1911. Democrats had not held both the legislature and the governorship since 1874. Neither U.S. Senate seat was up for a vote in 2006. In 2008, Democrats retained their majorities, governorship, and Congressional seats; and former governor Jeanne Shaheen defeated incumbent Republican John E. Sununu for the U.S. Senate in a rematch of the 2002 contest.

The 2008 elections resulted in women holding a majority, 13 of the 24 seats, in the New Hampshire Senate, a first for any legislative body in the United States.

In the 2010 midterm elections, Republicans made historic gains in New Hampshire, capturing veto-proof majorities in the state legislature, taking all five seats in the Executive Council, electing a new U.S. senator, Kelly Ayotte, winning both U.S. House seats, and reducing the margin of victory of incumbent Governor John Lynch compared to his 2006 and 2008 landslide wins.

In the 2012 state legislative elections, Democrats took back the New Hampshire House of Representatives and narrowed the Republican majority in the New Hampshire Senate to 13–11. In 2012, New Hampshire became the first state in U.S. history to elect an all-female federal delegation: Democratic Congresswomen Carol Shea-Porter of Congressional District 1 and Ann McLane Kuster of Congressional District 2 accompanied U.S. Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Kelly Ayotte in 2013. Further, the state elected its second female governor: Democrat Maggie Hassan.

In the 2014 elections, Republicans retook the New Hampshire House of Representatives with a 239–160 majority and expanded their majority in the New Hampshire Senate to 14 of the Senate&#x27;s 24 seats. On the national level, incumbent Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen defeated her Republican challenger, former Massachusetts senator Scott Brown. New Hampshire also elected Frank Guinta (R) for its First Congressional District representative and Ann Kuster (D) for its Second Congressional District representative.

In the 2016 elections, Republicans held the New Hampshire House of Representatives with a majority of 220–175 and held onto their 14 seats in the New Hampshire Senate. In the gubernatorial race, retiring Governor Maggie Hassan was succeeded by Republican Chris Sununu, who defeated Democratic nominee Colin Van Ostern. Sununu became the state&#x27;s first Republican governor since Craig Benson, who left office in 2005 following defeat by John Lynch. In the presidential race, the state voted for the Democratic nominee, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton over the Republican nominee, Donald Trump, by a margin of 2,736 votes, or 0.3%, one of the closest results the state has ever seen in a presidential race, while Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson received 4.12% of the vote. The Democrats also won a competitive race in the Second Congressional District, as well as a competitive senate race. 

There is a unique contrast that can be seen between New Hampshire&#x27;s federal and state level representation when it comes to which political party has control. Since 2017, New Hampshire&#x27;s federal level delegation to the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives has consisted of exclusively Democrats. However, since 2017, New Hampshire&#x27;s state level government has had a Republican trifecta over the governorship and New Hampshire State Senate and House of Representatives, excluding the years 2019 and 2020, in which Republican Governor Chris Sununu still resided. 

====Free State Project====
The Free State Project (FSP) is a movement founded in 2001 to recruit at least 20,000 libertarians to move to a single low-population state (New Hampshire, was selected in 2003), to concentrate libertarian activism around a single region. The Free State Project emphasizes decentralized decision-making, encouraging new movers and prior residents of New Hampshire to participate in a way the individual mover deems most appropriate. For example, as of 2017, there were 17 so-called Free Staters elected to the New Hampshire House of Representatives, and in 2021, the New Hampshire Liberty Alliance, which ranks bills and elected representatives based on their adherence to what they see as libertarian principles, scored 150 representatives as &quot;A−&quot; or above rated representatives. Participants also engage with other like-minded activist groups such as Rebuild New Hampshire, Young Americans for Liberty, and Americans for Prosperity. As of April 2022, approximately 6,232 participants have moved to New Hampshire for the Free State Project.

==Transportation==
===Highways===
New Hampshire has a well-maintained, well-signed network of Interstate highways, U.S. highways, and state highways. State highway markers still depict the Old Man of the Mountain despite that rock formation&#x27;s demise in 2003. Several route numbers align with the same route numbers in neighboring states. State highway numbering is arbitrary, with no overall system as with U.S. and Interstate systems. Major routes include:
* Interstate 89 runs northwest from near Concord to Lebanon on the Vermont border.
* Interstate 93 is the main Interstate highway in New Hampshire and runs north from Salem (on the Massachusetts border) to Littleton (on the Vermont border). I-93 connects the more densely populated southern part of the state to the Lakes Region and the White Mountains further to the north.
* Interstate 95 runs north–south briefly along New Hampshire&#x27;s seacoast to serve the city of Portsmouth, before entering Maine
* U.S. Route 1 runs north–south briefly along New Hampshire&#x27;s seacoast to the east of and paralleling I-95.
* U.S. Route 2 runs east–west through Coos County from Maine, intersecting Route 16, skirting the White Mountain National Forest passing through Jefferson and into Vermont.
* U.S. Route 3 is the longest numbered route in the state, and the only one to run completely through the state from the Massachusetts border to the Canada–U.S. border. It generally parallels Interstate 93. South of Manchester, it takes a more westerly route through Nashua. North of Franconia Notch, U.S.3 takes a more easterly route, before terminating at the Canada–U.S. border.
* U.S. Route 4 terminates at the Portsmouth Traffic Circle and runs east–west across the southern part of the state connecting Durham, Concord, Boscawen, and Lebanon.
* New Hampshire Route 16 is a major north–south highway in the eastern part of the state that generally parallels the border with Maine, eventually entering Maine as Maine Route 16. The southernmost portion of NH 16 is a four-lane freeway, co-signed with U.S. Route4.

===Air===

New Hampshire has 25 public-use airports, three with some scheduled commercial passenger service. The busiest airport by number of passengers handled is Manchester-Boston Regional Airport in Manchester and Londonderry, which serves the Greater Boston metropolitan area. The closest airport with international service is Logan International Airport in Boston.

===Public transportation===
Long-distance intercity passenger rail service is provided by Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Vermonter&quot; and &quot;Downeaster&quot; lines.

Greyhound, Concord Coach, Vermont Translines, and Dartmouth Coach all provide intercity bus connections to and from points in New Hampshire and to long-distance points beyond and in between.

, Boston-centered MBTA Commuter Rail services reach only as far as northern Massachusetts. The New Hampshire Rail Transit Authority is working to extend &quot;Capital Corridor&quot; service from Lowell, Massachusetts, to Nashua, Concord, and Manchester, including Manchester-Boston Regional Airport; and &quot;Coastal Corridor&quot; service from Haverhill, Massachusetts, to Plaistow, New Hampshire. Legislation in 2007 created the New Hampshire Rail Transit Authority (NHRTA) with the goal of overseeing the development of commuter rail in the state of New Hampshire. In 2011, Governor John Lynch vetoed HB 218, a bill passed by Republican lawmakers, which would have drastically curtailed the powers and responsibilities of NHRTA. The I-93 Corridor transit study suggested a rail alternative along the Manchester and Lawrence branch line which could provide freight and passenger service. This rail corridor would also have access to Manchester-Boston Regional Airport.

Eleven public transit authorities operate local and regional bus services around the state, and eight private carriers operate express bus services which link with the national intercity bus network. The New Hampshire Department of Transportation operates a statewide ride-sharing match service, in addition to independent ride matching and guaranteed ride home programs.

Tourist railroads include the Conway Scenic Railroad, Hobo-Winnipesaukee Railroad, and the Mount Washington Cog Railway.

===Freight railways===
Freight railways in New Hampshire include Claremont &amp; Concord Railroad (CCRR), Pan Am Railways via subsidiary Springfield Terminal Railway (ST), the New England Central Railroad (NHCR), the St. Lawrence and Atlantic Railroad (SLR), and New Hampshire Northcoast Corporation (NHN).

==Education==

===High schools===
The first public high schools in the state were the Boys&#x27; High School and the Girls&#x27; High School of Portsmouth, established either in 1827 or 1830, depending on the source.

New Hampshire has more than 80 public high schools, many of which serve more than one town. The largest is Pinkerton Academy in Derry, which is owned by a private non-profit organization and serves as the public high school of several neighboring towns. There are at least 30 private high schools in the state.

New Hampshire is also the home of several prestigious university-preparatory schools, such as Phillips Exeter Academy, St. Paul&#x27;s School, Proctor Academy, Brewster Academy, and Kimball Union Academy.

In 2008, the state tied with Massachusetts as having the highest scores on the SAT and ACT standardized tests given to high school students.

In the spring, New Hampshire&#x27;s many sap houses hold sugaring-off open houses. In summer and early autumn, New Hampshire is home to many county fairs, the largest being the Hopkinton State Fair, in Contoocook. New Hampshire&#x27;s Lakes Region is home to many summer camps, especially around Lake Winnipesaukee, and is a popular tourist destination. The Peterborough Players have performed every summer in Peterborough since 1933. The Barnstormers Theatre in Tamworth, founded in 1931, is one of the longest-running professional summer theaters in the United States.

In September, New Hampshire is host to the &quot;New Hampshire Highland Games&quot;. New Hampshire has also registered an official tartan with the proper authorities in Scotland, used to make kilts worn by the Lincoln Police Department while its officers serve during the games. The fall foliage peaks in mid-October. In the winter, New Hampshire&#x27;s ski areas and snowmobile trails attract visitors from a wide area. After the lakes freeze over they become dotted with ice fishing ice houses, known locally as bobhouses.

Funspot, the world&#x27;s largest video arcade (now termed a museum), is in Laconia.

===In fiction===
Many novels, plays and screenplays have been set in New Hampshire.

====Theater====
* The fictional New Hampshire town of Grover&#x27;s Corners serves as the setting of the Thornton Wilder play &quot;Our Town&quot;. Grover&#x27;s Corners is based, in part, on the real town of Peterborough. Several local landmarks and nearby towns are mentioned in the text of the play, and Wilder himself spent some time in Peterborough at the MacDowell Colony, writing at least some of the play while in residence there.

====Comics====
* Al Capp, creator of the comic strip &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;, used to joke that Dogpatch, the setting for the strip, was based on Seabrook, where he would vacation with his wife.

<text>Numerology (known before the 20th century as arithmancy) is the belief in an occult, divine or mystical relationship between a number and one or more coinciding events. It is also the study of the numerical value, via an alphanumeric system, of the letters in words and names. When numerology is applied to a person&#x27;s name, it is a form of onomancy. It is often associated with astrology and other divinatory arts.

Number symbolism is an ancient and pervasive aspect of human thought, deeply intertwined with religion, philosophy, mysticism, and mathematics. Different cultures and traditions have assigned specific meanings to numbers, often linking them to divine principles, cosmic forces, or natural patterns.

The term numerologist can be used for those who place faith in numerical patterns and draw inferences from them, even if those people do not practice traditional numerology. For example, in his 1997 book &quot;Numerology: Or What Pythagoras Wrought&quot; (), mathematician Underwood Dudley uses the term to discuss practitioners of the Elliott wave principle of stock market analysis.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;arithmancy&quot; is derived from two Greek words – &quot;arithmos&quot; (meaning number) and &quot;manteia&quot; (meaning divination). &quot;Αριθμομαντεία&quot; Arithmancy is thus the study of divination through numbers. Although the word &quot;arithmancy&quot; dates to the 1570s, the word &quot;numerology&quot; is not recorded in English before c. 1907.

== History ==

The practice of gematria, assigning numerical values to words and names and imputing those values with religious meaning, dates back to antiquity. An Assyrian inscription from the 8th century BC, commissioned by Sargon II declares &quot;the king built the wall of Khorsabad 16,283 cubits long to correspond with the numerical value of his name&quot;. Rabbinic literature used gematria to interpret passages in the Hebrew Bible.

The practice of using alphabetic letters to represent numbers developed in the Greek city of Miletus, and is thus known as the Milesian system. Early examples include vase graffiti dating to the 6th century BCE. Aristotle wrote that the Pythgoraean tradition, founded in the 6th century by Pythagoras of Samos, practiced isopsephy, the Greek predecessor of Hebrew gematria. Pythagoras was a contemporary of the philosophers Anaximander, Anaximenes, and the historian Hecataeus, all of whom lived in Miletus, across the sea from Samos. The Milesian system was in common use by the reign of Alexander the Great (336–323 BCE) and was adopted by other cultures during the subsequent Hellenistic period. It was officially adopted in Egypt during the reign of Ptolemy II Philadelphus (284–246 BCE).

By the late 4th century AD, following the Edict of Thessalonica in 380 AD and the subsequent enforcement of Nicene Christianity under Theodosius I, departures from the beliefs of the state church were classified as civil violations within the Roman Empire. Numerology, referred to as isopsephy, remained in use in conservative Greek Orthodox circles, particularly in mystical and theological contexts.

Some alchemical theories were closely related to numerology. For example, Arab alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan (died c. 806−816) framed his experiments in an elaborate numerology based on the names of substances in the Arabic language.

Numerology is prominent in Sir Thomas Browne&#x27;s 1658 literary discourse &quot;The Garden of Cyrus&quot;. Throughout its pages, the author attempts to demonstrate that the number five and the related quincunx pattern can be found throughout the arts, in design, and in nature particularly botany.

Some approaches to understanding the meanings of the Qur&#x27;an (the book of Muslims) include the understanding of numerical meanings, numerical symbols and their combination with purely textual approaches.

== Methods ==

=== Alphanumeric systems ===

There are various numerology systems which assign numerical value to the letters of an alphabet. Examples include the Abjad numerals in Arabic, Hebrew numerals, Armenian numerals, and Greek numerals. The practice within Jewish tradition of assigning mystical meaning to words based on their numerical values, and on connections between words of equal value, is known as &quot;gematria&quot;.

The Mandaean number alphasyllabary is also used for numerology (Mandaic: &quot;gmaṭ aria&quot;). The &quot;Book of the Zodiac&quot; is an important Mandaean text on numerology.

===Pythagorean method===
In the Pythagorean method (which uses a kind of place-value for number-letter attributions, as does the ancient Hebrew and Greek systems), the letters of the modern Latin alphabet are assigned numerical values 1 through 9.

=== Agrippan method ===

Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa applied the concept of arithmancy to the classical Latin alphabet in the 16th century in &quot;Three Books of Occult Philosophy&quot;. He mapped the letters as follows (in accordance with the Latin alphabet&#x27;s place-value at that time):


Note that the letters U, J, and W were not commonly considered part of the Latin alphabet at the time.

=== Angel numbers ===
Angel numbers, as defined by Doreen Virtue and Lynnette Brown in 2004, are numbers consisting of repeating digits, such as 111 or 444. , a number of popular media publications have published articles suggesting that these numbers have numerological significance. Doreen Virtue has since renounced the concept of angel numbers in a 2024 interview with &quot;The Cut&quot; declaring that &quot;It’s garbage. I regret it, and I’m sorry that I made them.&quot;

==English systems==

There are various systems of English Qabalah or numerology. These systems interpret the letters of the Roman script or English alphabet via an assigned set of numerological significances. English Qaballa, on the other hand, refers specifically to a Qabalah supported by a system discovered by James Lees in 1976.

The first system of English gematria was used by the poet John Skelton in 1523 in his poem &quot;The Garland of Laurel&quot;. The next reference to an English gematria found in the literature was made by Willis F. Whitehead in 1899 in his book, &quot;The Mystic Thesaurus&quot;, in which he describes a system he called &quot;English Cabala&quot;.

In 1952, John P. L. Hughes published &quot;The Hidden Numerical Significance of the English Language, or, Suggestive Gematria&quot;, based on his lecture delivered at Holden Research Circle on July 4, 1952. A system related to the Spiritualist Agasha Temple of Wisdom was described by William Eisen in his two volume &quot;The English Cabalah&quot; (1980–82).

William G. Gray proposes another system in his 1984 book, &quot;Concepts of Qabalah&quot;, more recently republished as &quot;Qabalistic Concepts&quot;. This system includes correspondence attributions of the English letters to the positions on the Tree of Life. Michael Bertiaux described a system called &quot;Angelic Gematria&quot; in his &quot;The Voudon Gnostic Workbook&quot; (1989). David Rankine described a system of English gematria using prime numbers which he calls &quot;Prime Qabalah&quot; in his book &quot;Becoming Magick&quot; (2004).

Scientific theories are sometimes labeled &quot;numerology&quot; if their primary inspiration appears to be a set of patterns rather than scientific observations. This colloquial use of the term is quite common within the scientific community and it is mostly used to dismiss a theory as questionable science.

The best known example of &quot;numerology&quot; in science involves the coincidental resemblance of certain large numbers that intrigued mathematical physicist Paul Dirac, mathematician Hermann Weyl and astronomer Arthur Stanley Eddington. These numerical coincidences refer to such quantities as the ratio of the age of the universe to the atomic unit of time, the number of electrons in the universe, and the difference in strengths between gravity and the electric force for the electron and proton. (See also Fine-tuned universe).

Wolfgang Pauli was also fascinated by the appearance of certain numbers, including 137 (a prime number), in physics.

<doc id="21139" wikidata="Q49" url="?curid=21139" title="North America">
<text>North America is a continent in the Northern and Western Hemispheres. North America is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea, and to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean. The region includes the Bahamas, Bermuda, Canada, the Caribbean, Central America, Clipperton Island, Greenland, Mexico, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, the Turks and Caicos Islands, and the United States.

North America covers an area of about , representing approximately 16.5% of the Earth&#x27;s land area and 4.8% of its total surface area. It is the third-largest continent by size after Asia and Africa, and the fourth-largest continent by population after Asia, Africa, and Europe. , North America&#x27;s population was estimated as over 592 million people in 23 independent states, or about 7.5% of the world&#x27;s population. In human geography, the terms &quot;North America&quot; and &quot;North American&quot; can refer to Canada, the United States, Mexico, and Greenland or, alternatively, Canada, Greenland and the US (Mexico being classified as part of Latin America) or simply Canada and the US (Greenland being classified as either Arctic or European (due to its political status as a part of Denmark) and Mexico classified as Latin American).

It is unknown with certainty how and when first human populations first reached North America. People were known to live in the Americas at least 20,000 years ago, but various evidence points to possibly earlier dates. The Paleo-Indian period in North America followed the Last Glacial Period, and lasted until about 10,000 years ago when the Archaic period began. The classic stage followed the Archaic period, and lasted from approximately the 6th to 13th centuries. Beginning in 1000 AD, the Norse were the first Europeans to begin exploring and ultimately colonizing areas of North America.

In 1492, the exploratory voyages of Christopher Columbus led to a transatlantic exchange, including migrations of European settlers during the Age of Discovery and the early modern period. Present-day cultural and ethnic patterns reflect interactions between European colonists, indigenous peoples, enslaved Africans, immigrants from Europe, Asia, and descendants of these respective groups.

Europe&#x27;s colonization in North America led to most North Americans speaking European languages, such as English, Spanish, and French, and the cultures of the region commonly reflect Western traditions. However, relatively small parts of North America in Canada, the United States, Mexico, and Central America have indigenous populations that continue adhering to their respective pre-European colonial cultural and linguistic traditions.

== Name ==


The Americas were named after the Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci by German cartographers Martin Waldseemüller and Matthias Ringmann. Vespucci explored South America between 1497 and 1502, and was the first European to suggest that the Americas represented a landmass then unknown to the Europeans. In 1507, Waldseemüller published a world map, and placed the word &quot;America&quot; on the continent of present-day South America. The continent north of present-day Mexico was then referred to as Parias. On a 1553 world map published by Petrus Apianus, North America was called &quot;Baccalearum&quot;, meaning &quot;realm of the Cod fish&quot;, in reference to the abundance of cod on the East Coast.

Waldseemüller used the Latinized version of Vespucci&#x27;s name, Americus Vespucius, in its feminine form of &quot;America&quot;, following the examples of &quot;Europa&quot;, &quot;Asia&quot;, and &quot;Africa&quot;. Americus originated from Medieval Latin (see Saint Emeric of Hungary), coming from the Old High German name Emmerich. Map makers later extended the name America to North America.

In 1538, Gerardus Mercator used the term America on his world map of the entire Western Hemisphere. On his subsequent 1569 map, Mercator called North America &quot;America or New India&quot; (&quot;America sive India Nova&quot;).

The Spanish Empire called its territories in North and South America &quot;Las Indias&quot;, and the name given to the state body that oversaw the region was called the Council of the Indies.

== Definitions ==
The United Nations and its statistics division recognize North America as including three regions: Northern America, Central America, and the Caribbean. &quot;Northern America&quot; is a term distinct from &quot;North America&quot;, excluding Central America, which itself may or may not include Mexico. In the limited context of regional trade agreements, the term is used to reference three nations: Canada, the United States, and Mexico.

France, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Romania, Greece, and the countries of Latin America use a six-continent model, with the Americas viewed as a single continent and &quot;North America&quot; designating a subcontinent comprising Canada, the United States, Mexico, and Saint Pierre and Miquelon (politically part of France), and often Greenland and Bermuda.

North America has historically been known by other names, including Spanish North America, New Spain, and América Septentrional, the first official name given to Mexico.

===Regions===
North America includes several regions and subregions, each of which have their own respective cultural, economic, and geographic regions. Economic regions include several regions formalized in 20th- and 21st-century trade agreements, including NAFTA between Canada, Mexico, and the United States, and CAFTA between Central America, the Dominican Republic, and the United States.

North America is divided linguistically and culturally into two primary regions, Anglo-America and Latin America. Anglo-America includes most of North America, Belize, and Caribbean islands with English-speaking populations. There are also regions, including Louisiana and Quebec, with large Francophone populations; in Quebec, French is the official language..

The southern portion of North America includes Central America and non-English-speaking Caribbean nations. The north of the continent maintains recognized regions as well. In contrast to the common definition of North America, which encompasses the whole North American continent, the term &quot;North America&quot; is sometimes used more narrowly to refer only to four nations, Canada, Greenland, Mexico, and the U.S. The U.S. Census Bureau includes Saint Pierre and Miquelon, but excludes Mexico from its definition.

The term Northern America refers to the northernmost countries and territories of North America: the U.S., Bermuda, Canada, Greenland, and St. Pierre and Miquelon. Although the term does not refer to a unified region, Middle America includes Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean.

North America&#x27;s largest countries by land area are Canada and the U.S., both of which have well-defined and recognized subregions. In Canada, these include (from east to west) Atlantic Canada, Central Canada, the Canadian Prairies, the British Columbia Coast, Western Canada, and Northern Canada. In the U.S., they include New England, the Mid-Atlantic, and the South Atlantic, East North Central, West North Central, East South Central, West South Central, Mountain, and Pacific states. The Great Lakes region and the Pacific Northwest include areas in both the U.S. and Canada.

=== Countries, dependencies, and other territories ===

== Geography ==

North America occupies the northern portion of the landmass generally referred to as the New World, the Western Hemisphere, the Americas, or simply America, which, in many countries, is considered a single continent with North America a subcontinent. North America is the third-largest continent by area after Asia and Africa.

North America&#x27;s only land connection to South America is in present-day Panama at the Darien Gap on the Colombia–Panama border, placing almost all of Panama within North America. Alternatively, some geologists physiographically locate its southern limit at the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, Mexico, with Central America extending southeastward to South America from this point. The Caribbean islands, or West Indies, are considered part of North America. The continental coastline is long and irregular. The Gulf of Mexico is the largest body of water indenting the continent, followed by Hudson Bay. Others include the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and the Gulf of California.

Before the Central American isthmus formed, the region had been underwater. The islands of the West Indies delineate a submerged former land bridge, which had connected North and South America via what are now Florida and Venezuela.

There are several islands off the continent&#x27;s coasts; principally, the Arctic Archipelago, the Bahamas, Turks and Caicos, the Greater and Lesser Antilles, the Aleutian Islands (some of which are in the Eastern Hemisphere proper), the Alexander Archipelago, the many thousand islands of the British Columbia Coast, and Newfoundland. Greenland, a self-governing Danish island, and the world&#x27;s largest, is on the same tectonic plate (the North American Plate) and is part of North America geographically. In a geologic sense, Bermuda is not part of the Americas, but an oceanic island that was formed on the fissure of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge over 100 million years ago (mya). The nearest landmass to it is Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. However, Bermuda is often thought of as part of North America, especially given its historical, political and cultural ties to Virginia and other parts of the continent.

The vast majority of North America is on the North American Plate. Parts of western Mexico, including Baja California, and of California, including the cities of San Diego, Los Angeles, and Santa Cruz, lie on the eastern edge of the Pacific Plate, with the two plates meeting along the San Andreas Fault. The southernmost portion of the continent and much of the West Indies lie on the Caribbean Plate, whereas the Juan de Fuca Plate and Cocos Plate border the North American Plate on its western frontier.

The continent can be divided into four great regions (each of which contains many subregions): the Great Plains stretching from the Gulf of Mexico to the Canadian Arctic; the geologically young, mountainous west, including the Rocky Mountains, the Great Basin, California, and Alaska; the raised but relatively flat plateau of the Canadian Shield in the northeast; and the varied eastern region, which includes the Appalachian Mountains, the coastal plain along the Atlantic seaboard, and the Florida peninsula. Mexico, with its long plateaus and cordilleras, falls largely in the western region, although the eastern coastal plain does extend south along the Gulf.

The western mountains are split in the middle into the main range of the Rockies and the coast ranges in California, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia, with the Great Basin—a lower area containing smaller ranges and low-lying deserts—in between. The highest peak is Denali in Alaska.

The U.S. Geographical Survey (USGS) states that the geographic center of North America is &quot;6 miles [10 km] west of Balta, Pierce County, North Dakota&quot; at about , about from Rugby, North Dakota. The USGS further states that &quot;No marked or monumented point has been established by any government agency as the geographic center of either the 50 states, the conterminous United States, or the North American continent.&quot; Nonetheless, there is a field stone obelisk in Rugby claiming to mark the center. The North American continental pole of inaccessibility is located from the nearest coastline, between Allen and Kyle, South Dakota at .

=== Canada ===
Canada can be divided into roughly seven physiographic divisions:

# The Canadian Shield
# The interior plains
# The Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Lowlands
# The Appalachian region
# The Western Cordillera
# Hudson Bay Lowlands
# Arctic Archipelago

=== United States ===

The lower 48 U.S. states can be divided into roughly eight physiographic divisions:
# The Intermontane Plateaus
# The Laurentian Upland, part of the Canadian Shield Northern portion of the upper midwestern U.S.
# The Interior Plains
# The Atlantic Plain
# The Appalachian highlands
# The Interior highlands
# The Rocky Mountain system
# The Pacific Mountain system

=== Mexico ===
Mexico can be divided into roughly fifteen physiographic divisions:

# The Baja California Peninsula
# The Sonoran Basin and Range
# The Western Sierra Madre
# The Northern Mountains and Plains
# The Eastern Sierra Madre 
# The Great Plain
# The Pacific Coastal Plain
# The Northern Gulf Coast Plain
# The Central Plateau
# The Volcanic Axis
# The Southern Sierra Madre
# The Southern Gulf Coast Plain
# The Chiapas Sierra Madre
# The Chiapas Highlands
# The Yucatán Peninsula

=== Climate ===

North America is a very large continent that extends from north of the Arctic Circle to south of the Tropic of Cancer. Greenland, along with the Canadian Shield, is tundra with average temperatures ranging from , but central Greenland is composed of a very large ice sheet. This tundra radiates throughout Canada, but its border ends near the Rocky Mountains (but still contains Alaska) and at the end of the Canadian Shield, near the Great Lakes.
Climate west of the Cascade Range is described as being temperate weather with average precipitation .
Climate in coastal California is described to be Mediterranean, with average temperatures in cities like San Francisco ranging from over the course of the year.

Stretching from the East Coast to eastern North Dakota, and stretching down to Kansas, is the humid continental climate featuring intense seasons, with a large amount of annual precipitation, with places like New York City averaging .
Starting at the southern border of the humid continental climate and stretching to the Gulf of Mexico (while encompassing the eastern half of Texas) is the humid subtropical climate. This area has the wettest cities in the contiguous U.S., with annual precipitation reaching in Mobile, Alabama.
Stretching from the borders of the humid continental and subtropical climates, and going west to the Sierra Nevada, south to the southern tip of Durango, north to the border with tundra climate, the steppe/desert climates are the driest in the U.S. Highland climates cut from north to south of the continent, where subtropical or temperate climates occur just below the tropics, as in central Mexico and Guatemala. Tropical climates appear in the island regions and in the subcontinent&#x27;s bottleneck, found in countries and states bathed by the Caribbean Sea or to the south of the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean. Precipitation patterns vary across the region, and as such rainforest, monsoon, and savanna types can be found, with rains and high temperatures throughout the year.

=== Ecology ===
Notable North American fauna include the bison, black bear, jaguar, cougar, prairie dog, turkey, pronghorn, raccoon, coyote, and monarch butterfly. Notable plants that were domesticated in North America include tobacco, maize, squash, tomato, sunflower, blueberry, avocado, cotton, chile pepper, and vanilla.

== Geology ==
=== Geologic history ===
Laurentia is an ancient craton which forms the geologic core of North America; it formed between 1.5 and 1.0 billion years ago during the Proterozoic eon. The Canadian Shield is the largest exposure of this craton. From the Late Paleozoic to Early Mesozoic eras, North America was joined with the other modern-day continents as part of the supercontinent Pangaea, with Eurasia to its east. One of the results of the formation of Pangaea was the Appalachian Mountains, which formed some 480 mya, making it among the oldest mountain ranges in the world. When Pangaea began to rift around 200 mya, North America became part of Laurasia, before it separated from Eurasia as its own continent during the mid-Cretaceous period. The Rockies and other western mountain ranges began forming around this time from a period of mountain building called the Laramide orogeny, between 80 and 55 mya. The formation of the Isthmus of Panama that connected the continent to South America arguably occurred approximately 12 to 15 mya, and the Great Lakes (as well as many other northern freshwater lakes and rivers) were carved by receding glaciers about 10,000 years ago.

North America is the source of much of what humanity knows about geologic time periods. The geographic area that would later become the United States has been the source of more varieties of dinosaurs than any other modern country. According to paleontologist Peter Dodson, this is primarily due to stratigraphy, climate and geography, human resources, and history. Much of the Mesozoic Era is represented by exposed outcrops in the many arid regions of the continent. The most significant Late Jurassic dinosaur-bearing fossil deposit in North America is the Morrison Formation of the western U.S.

=== Canada ===
Canada is geologically one of the oldest regions in the world, with more than half of the region consisting of Precambrian rocks that have been above sea level since the beginning of the Palaeozoic era. Canada&#x27;s mineral resources are diverse and extensive. Across the Canadian Shield and in the north there are large iron, nickel, zinc, copper, gold, lead, molybdenum, and uranium reserves. Large diamond concentrations have been recently developed in the Arctic, making Canada one of the world&#x27;s largest producers. Throughout the Shield, there are many mining towns extracting these minerals. The largest, and best known, is Sudbury, Ontario. Sudbury is an exception to the normal process of forming minerals in the Shield since there is significant evidence that the Sudbury Basin is an ancient meteorite impact crater. The nearby, but less-known Temagami Magnetic Anomaly has striking similarities to the Sudbury Basin. Its magnetic anomalies are very similar to the Sudbury Basin, and so it could be a second metal-rich impact crater. The Shield is also covered by vast boreal forests that support an important logging industry.

=== United States ===


The United States can be divided into twelve main geological provinces:

# Pacific
# Columbia Plateau
# Basin and Range
# Colorado Plateau
# Rocky Mountains
# Laurentian Upland
# Interior Plains
# Interior Highlands
# Appalachian Highlands
# Atlantic Plain
# Alaskan 
# Hawaiian

Each province has its own geologic history and unique features. The geology of Alaska is typical of that of the cordillera, while the major islands of Hawaii consist of Neogene volcanics erupted over a hot spot.

=== Central America ===
Central America is geologically active with volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occurring from time to time. In 1976 Guatemala was hit by a major earthquake, killing 23,000 people; Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, was devastated by earthquakes in 1931 and 1972, the last one killing about 5,000 people; three earthquakes devastated El Salvador, one in 1986 and two in 2001; one earthquake devastated northern and central Costa Rica in 2009, killing at least 34 people; in Honduras a powerful earthquake killed seven people in 2009.

Volcanic eruptions are common in the region. In 1968, the Arenal Volcano, in Costa Rica, erupted and killed 87 people. Fertile soils from weathered volcanic lavas have made it possible to sustain dense populations in agriculturally productive highland areas.

Central America has many mountain ranges; the longest are the Sierra Madre de Chiapas, the Cordillera Isabelia, and the Cordillera de Talamanca. Between the mountain ranges lie fertile valleys that are suitable for the people; in fact, most of the population of Honduras, Costa Rica, and Guatemala live in valleys. Valleys are also suitable for the production of coffee, beans, and other crops.

== History ==
===Pre-Columbian era===
The indigenous peoples of the Americas have many creation myths, based on which they assert that they have been present on the land since its creation, but there is no evidence that humans evolved there. The specifics of the initial settlement of the Americas by ancient Asians are subject to ongoing research and discussion. The traditional theory has been that hunters entered the Bering Land Bridge between eastern Siberia and present-day Alaska from 27,000 to 14,000 years ago. A growing viewpoint is that the first American inhabitants sailed from Beringia some 13,000 years ago, with widespread habitation of the Americas during the end of the Last Glacial Period, in what is known as the Late Glacial Maximum, around 12,500 years ago. The oldest petroglyphs in North America date from 15,000 to 10,000 years before present. Genetic research and anthropology indicate additional waves of migration from Asia via the Bering Strait during the Early-Middle Holocene.

Prior to the arrival of European explorers and colonists in North America, the natives of North America were divided into many different polities, ranging from small bands of a few families to large empires. They lived in several culture areas, which roughly correspond to geographic and biological zones that defined the representative cultures and lifestyles of the indigenous people who lived there, including the bison hunters of the Great Plains and the farmers of Mesoamerica. Native groups also are classified by their language families, which included Athabaskan and Uto-Aztecan languages. Indigenous peoples with similar languages did not always share the same material culture, however, and were not necessarily always allies. Anthropologists speculate that the Inuit of the high Arctic arrived in North America much later than other native groups, evidenced by the disappearance of Dorset culture artifacts from the archaeological record and their replacement by the Thule people.

During the thousands of years of native habitation on the continent, cultures changed and shifted. One of the oldest yet discovered is the Clovis culture (c. 9550–9050 BCE) in modern New Mexico. Later groups include the Mississippian culture and related Mound building cultures, found in the Mississippi River valley and the Pueblo culture of what is now the Four Corners. The more southern cultural groups of North America were responsible for the domestication of many common crops now used around the world, such as tomatoes, squash, and maize. As a result of the development of agriculture in the south, many other cultural advances were made there. The Mayans developed a writing system, built huge pyramids and temples, had a complex calendar, and developed the concept of zero around 400 CE.

The first recorded European references to North America are in Norse sagas where it is referred to as Vinland. The earliest verifiable instance of pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact by any European culture with the North America mainland has been dated to around 1000 CE. The site, situated at the northernmost extent of the island named Newfoundland, has provided unmistakable evidence of Norse settlement. Norse explorer Leif Erikson (c. 970–1020 CE) is thought to have visited the area. Erikson was the first European to make landfall on the continent (excluding Greenland).

The Mayan culture was still present in southern Mexico and Guatemala when the Spanish conquistadors arrived, but political dominance in the area had shifted to the Aztec Empire, whose capital city Tenochtitlan was located further north in the Valley of Mexico. The Aztecs were conquered in 1521 by Hernán Cortés.

=== Post-contact, 1492–1910 ===


During the so-called Age of Discovery, Europeans explored overseas and staked claims to various parts of North America, much of which was already settled by indigenous peoples. Upon Europeans&#x27; arrival in the &quot;New World&quot;, indigenous peoples had a variety of reactions, including curiosity, trading, cooperation, resignation, and resistance. The indigenous population declined substantially following European arrival, primarily due to the introduction of Eurasian diseases, such as smallpox, to which the indigenous peoples lacked immunity, and because of violent conflicts with Europeans. Indigenous culture changed significantly and their affiliation with political and cultural groups also changed. Several linguistic groups died out, and others changed quite quickly.

On North America&#x27;s southeastern coast, Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León, who had accompanied Columbus&#x27;s second voyage, visited and named in 1513 &quot;La Florida&quot;. As the colonial period unfolded, Spain, England, and France appropriated and claimed extensive territories in North America eastern and southern coastlines. Spain established permanent settlements on the Caribbean islands of Hispaniola and Cuba in the 1490s, building cities, putting the resident indigenous populations to work, raising crops for Spanish settlers and panning gold to enrich the Spaniards. Much of the indigenous population died due to disease and overwork, spurring the Spaniards on to claim new lands and peoples. An expedition under the command of Spanish settler, Hernán Cortés, sailed westward in 1519 to what turned out to be the mainland in Mexico. With local indigenous allies, the Spanish conquered the Aztec empire in central Mexico in 1521. Spain then established permanent cities in Mexico, Central America, and Spanish South America in the sixteenth century. Once Spaniards conquered the high civilization of the Aztecs and Incas, the Caribbean was a backwater of the Spanish empire.

Other European powers began to intrude on areas claimed by Spain, including the Caribbean islands. France took the western half of Hispaniola and developed Saint-Domingue as a cane sugar producing colony worked by black slave labor. Britain took Barbados and Jamaica, and the Dutch and Danes took islands previously claimed by Spain. Britain did not begin settling on the North American mainland until a hundred years after the first Spanish settlements, since it sought first to control nearby Ireland.

===English settlements===

The first permanent English settlement was in Jamestown, Virginia in 1607, followed by additional colonial establishments on the east coast from present-day Georgia in the south to Massachusetts in the north, forming the Thirteen Colonies of British America. The English did not establish settlements north or east of the St. Lawrence Valley in present-day Canada until after the conclusion of the American Revolutionary War. Britain&#x27;s early settlements in present-day Canada included St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland in 1630 and Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1749. The first permanent French settlement was in Quebec City, Quebec, established in 1608.

===Seven Years&#x27; War===

With the British victory in the Seven Years&#x27; War, France in 1763 ceded to Britain its claims of North American territories east of the Mississippi River. Spain, in turn, gained rights to the territories west of Mississippi, which then served as a border between Spain and Britain&#x27;s territorial claims. French colonists settled Illinois Country after several generations of experience on North America, migrating over the Mississippi River to regions where Spain was not present and where they were able to leverage their earlier Louisiana French settlements around the Gulf of Mexico. These early French settlers partnered with midwest indigenous tribes, and their mixed ancestry descendants later followed a westward expansion all the way to the Pacific Ocean on the present-day U.S. West Coast.

===American Revolution===

In 1776, after various attempts to reconcile differences with the British, the Thirteen Colonies in British America sent delegates to the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia, who unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence on 4 July 1776, written primarily by Thomas Jefferson, a member of the Committee of Five charged by the Second Continental Congress with authoring it. In the Declaration, the thirteen colonies declared their independence from the British monarchy, then governed by King George III, and detailed the factors that contributed to their decision. With the signing and issuance of the Declaration of Independence, the thirteen colonies formalized and escalated the American Revolutionary War, which had begun the year before at the Battles of Lexington and Concord on 19 April 1775. Gathered in Philadelphia following the war&#x27;s outbreak, delegates from the thirteen colonies established the Continental Army from various patriot militias then engaged in resisting the British, and appointed George Washington as the Continental Army&#x27;s military commander.

As the American Revolutionary War progressed, France and Spain, both then enemies of Britain, began to ultimately see the promise of a potential American victory in the war and began supporting Washington and the American Revolutionary cause. The British Army, in turn, was supported by Hessian military units from present-day Germany.

In 1783, after an eight-year attempt to defeat the American rebellion, King George III acknowledged Britain&#x27;s defeat in the war, leading to the signing of the Treaty of Paris on 3 September 1783, which solidified the sovereign establishment of the United States.

===Westward expansion===

By the late 18th century, Russia was established on the Pacific Northwest northern coastline, where it was engaged in maritime fur trade and was supported by various indigenous settlements in the region. As a result, the Spanish were showing more interest in controlling the trade on the Pacific coast and mapped most of its coastline. The first Spanish settlements were attempted in Alta California during that period. Numerous overland explorations associated with voyageurs, fur trade, and U.S. led expeditions, including the Lewis and Clark, Frémont and Wilkes expeditions, reached the Pacific.

In 1803, during the presidency of Thomas Jefferson, the third U.S. president, Napoleon Bonaparte sold France&#x27;s remaining North American territorial claims, which included regions west of the Mississippi River, to the U.S., in the Louisiana Purchase. Spain and the U.S. settled their western boundary dispute in 1819 in the Adams–Onís Treaty. Mexico fought a lengthy war for independence from Spain, winning it for Mexico (which included Central America at the time) in 1821. The U.S. sought further westward expansion and fought the Mexican–American War, gaining a vast territory that first Spain and then Mexico claimed but which they did not effectively control. Much of the area was in fact dominated by indigenous peoples, which did not recognize the claims of Spain, France, or the U.S. Russia sold its North American claims, which included the present-day U.S. state of Alaska, to the U.S. in 1867.

===Canada and Panama Canal===

In 1867, colonial settlers north of the United States, unified as the dominion of Canada. The U.S. sought to dig a canal across the Isthmus of Panama in present-day Panama in Central America, then a part of present-day Colombia. The U.S. aided Panamanians in a war that resulted in its separation from Colombia. The U.S. subsequently carved out the Panama Canal Zone, and claimed sovereignty over it. After decades of work, the Panama Canal was completed, which connected the Atlantic and Pacific oceans in 1913 and greatly facilitated global shipping navigation.

==Demographics==
Canada and the United States are the wealthiest and most developed nations on the continent followed by Mexico, a newly industrialized country. The countries of Central America and the Caribbean are at various levels of economic and human development. For example, small Caribbean island-nations, such as Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago, and Antigua and Barbuda, have a higher GDP (PPP) per capita than Mexico due to their smaller populations. Panama and Costa Rica have a significantly higher Human Development Index and GDP than the rest of the Central American nations. Additionally, despite Greenland&#x27;s vast resources in oil and minerals, much of them remain untapped, and the island is economically dependent on fishing, tourism, and subsidies from Denmark. Nevertheless, the island is highly developed.

Demographically, North America is ethnically diverse. Its three largest groups are Whites, Mestizos, and Blacks. There is a significant minority of Indigenous Americans and Asians among other less numerous groups.

=== Languages ===
The dominant languages in North America are English, Spanish, and French. Danish is prevalent in Greenland alongside Greenlandic, and Dutch is spoken side by side local languages in the Dutch Caribbean. The term Anglo-America is used to refer to the anglophone countries of the Americas: namely Canada (where English and French are co-official) and the U.S., but also sometimes Belize and parts of the tropics, especially the Commonwealth Caribbean. Latin America refers to the other areas of the Americas (generally south of the U.S.) where the Romance languages, derived from Latin, of Spanish and Portuguese, (but French-speaking countries are not usually included) predominate: the other republics of Central America (but not always Belize), part of the Caribbean (not the Dutch-, English-, or French-speaking areas), Mexico, and most of South America (except Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana [France], and the Falkland Islands [UK]).

The U.S. has an ethnically diverse population, and 37 ancestry groups have more than one million members. The French language has historically played a significant role in North America and now retains a distinctive presence in some regions. Canada is officially bilingual. French is the official language of the province of Quebec, where 95% of the people speak it as either their first or second language, and it is co-official with English in the province of New Brunswick. Other French-speaking locales include the province of Ontario (the official language is English, but there are an estimated 600,000 Franco-Ontarians), the province of Manitoba (co-official as &quot;de jure&quot; with English), the French West Indies and Saint-Pierre et Miquelon, as well as the U.S. state of Louisiana, where French is also an official language. Haiti is included with this group based on historical association but Haitians speak both Creole and French. Similarly, French and French Antillean Creole is spoken in Saint Lucia and the Commonwealth of Dominica alongside English.

===Indigenous languages===

A significant number of indigenous languages are spoken in North America, with roughly 6 million in Mexico speaking an indigenous language at home, 372,000 people in the U.S., and about 225,000 in Canada. In the U.S. and Canada, there are approximately 150 surviving indigenous languages of the 300 spoken prior to European contact.

=== Religions ===

Christianity is the largest religion in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. According to a 2012 Pew Research Center survey, 77% of the population considered themselves Christians. Christianity also is the predominant religion in the 23 dependent territories in North America. The U.S. has the largest Christian population in the world, with nearly 247 million Christians (70%), although other countries have higher percentages of Christians among their populations. Mexico has the world&#x27;s second-largest number of Catholics, surpassed only by Brazil.

According to the same study, the religiously unaffiliated (including agnostics and atheists) make up about 17% of the population of Canada and the U.S. Those with no religious affiliation make up about 24% of Canada&#x27;s total population.

Canada, the U.S., and Mexico host communities of Jews (6 million or about 1.8%), Buddhists (3.8 million or 1.1%) and Muslims (3.4 million or 1.0%). The largest number of Jews can be found in the U.S. (5.4 million), Canada (375,000) and Mexico (67,476). The U.S. hosts the largest Muslim population in North America with 2.7 million or 0.9%, while Canada hosts about one million Muslims or 3.2% of the population. In Mexico there were 3,700 Muslims in 2010. In 2012, &quot;U-T San Diego&quot; estimated U.S. practitioners of Buddhism at 1.2 million people, of whom 40% are living in Southern California.

The predominant religion in Mexico and Central America is Christianity (96%). Beginning with the Spanish colonization of Mexico in the 16th century, Roman Catholicism was the only religion permitted by Spanish crown and Catholic church. A vast campaign of religious conversion, the so-called &quot;spiritual conquest&quot;, was launched to bring the indigenous peoples into the Christian fold. The Inquisition was established to assure orthodox belief and practice. The Catholic Church remained an important institution, so that even after political independence, Roman Catholicism remained the dominant religion. Since the 1960s, there has been an increase in other Christian groups, particularly Protestantism, as well as other religious organizations, and individuals identifying themselves as having no religion. Christianity is also the predominant religion in the Caribbean (85%). Other religious groups in the region are Hinduism, Islam, Rastafari (in Jamaica), and Afro-American religions such as Santería and Vodou.

=== Populace ===

North America is the fourth most populous continent after Asia, Africa, and Europe. Its most populous country is the U.S. with 329.7 million persons. The second-largest country is Mexico with a population of 112.3 million. Canada is the third-most-populous country with 37.0 million. The majority of Caribbean island-nations have national populations under a million, though Cuba, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Puerto Rico (a territory of the U.S.), Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago each have populations higher than a million. Greenland has a small population of 55,984 for its massive size (2.166 million km2 or 836,300 mi2), and therefore, it has the world&#x27;s lowest population density at 0.026 pop./km2 (0.067 pop./mi2).

While the U.S., Canada, and Mexico maintain the largest populations, large city populations are not restricted to those nations. There are also large cities in the Caribbean. The largest cities in North America, by far, are Mexico City and New York City. These cities are the only cities on the continent to exceed eight million, and two of three in the Americas. Next in size are Los Angeles, Toronto, Chicago, Havana, Santo Domingo, and Montreal. Cities in the Sun Belt regions of the U.S., such as those in Southern California and Houston, Phoenix, Miami, Atlanta, and Las Vegas, are experiencing rapid growth. These causes included warm temperatures, retirement of Baby Boomers, large industry, and the influx of immigrants. Cities near the U.S. border, particularly in Mexico, are also experiencing large amounts of growth. Most notable is Tijuana, a city bordering San Diego that receives immigrants from all over Latin America and parts of Europe and Asia. Yet as cities grow in these warmer regions of North America, they are increasingly forced to deal with the major issue of water shortages.

Eight of the top ten metropolitan areas are located in the U.S. These metropolitan areas all have a population of above 5.5 million and include the New York City metropolitan area, Los Angeles metropolitan area, Chicago metropolitan area, and the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. While the majority of the largest metropolitan areas are within the U.S., Mexico is host to the largest metropolitan area by population in North America: Greater Mexico City. Canada also breaks into the top ten largest metropolitan areas with the Toronto metropolitan area having six million people. The proximity of cities to each other on the Canada–United States border and the Mexico–U.S. border has led to the rise of international metropolitan areas. These urban agglomerations are observed at their largest and most productive in Detroit–Windsor and San Diego–Tijuana and experience large commercial, economic, and cultural activity. The metropolitan areas are responsible for millions of dollars of trade dependent on international freight. In Detroit-Windsor the Border Transportation Partnership study in 2004 concluded US$13 billion was dependent on the Detroit–Windsor international border crossing while in San Diego–Tijuana freight at the Otay Mesa Port of Entry was valued at US$20 billion.
North America has also been witness to the growth of megapolitan areas. The United States includes eleven megaregions.

== Economy ==



North America&#x27;s GDP per capita was evaluated in October 2016 by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to be $41,830, making it the richest continent in the world, followed by Oceania.

Canada, Mexico, and the U.S. have significant and multifaceted economic systems. The U.S. has the largest economy in the world. In 2016, the U.S. had an estimated per capita gross domestic product (PPP) of $57,466 according to the World Bank, and is the most technologically developed economy of the three. The U.S.&#x27;s services sector comprises 77% of the country&#x27;s GDP (estimated in 2010), industry comprises 22% and agriculture comprises 1.2%. The U.S. economy is also the fastest-growing economy in North America and the Americas as a whole, with the highest GDP per capita in the Americas as well.

Canada shows significant growth in the sectors of services, mining and manufacturing. Canada&#x27;s per capita GDP (PPP) was estimated at $44,656 and it had the 11th-largest GDP (nominal) in 2014. Canada&#x27;s services sector comprises 78% of the country&#x27;s GDP (estimated in 2010), industry comprises 20% and agriculture comprises 2%. Mexico has a per capita GDP (PPP) of $16,111 and as of 2014 is the 15th-largest GDP (nominal) in the world. Being a newly industrialized country, Mexico maintains both modern and outdated industrial and agricultural facilities and operations. Its main sources of income are oil, industrial exports, manufactured goods, electronics, heavy industry, automobiles, construction, food, banking and financial services.

The North American economy is well defined and structured in three main economic areas. These areas are those under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the Caribbean Community and Common Market (CARICOM), and the Central American Common Market (CACM). Of these trade blocs, the U.S. takes part in two. In addition to the larger trade blocs there is the Canada-Costa Rica Free Trade Agreement among numerous other free-trade relations, often between the larger, more developed countries and Central American and Caribbean countries.

NAFTA formed one of the four largest trade blocs in the world. Its implementation in 1994 was designed for economic homogenization with hopes of eliminating barriers of trade and foreign investment between Canada, the U.S. and Mexico. While Canada and the U.S. already conducted the largest bilateral trade relationship—and to present day still do—in the world and Canada–U.S. trade relations already allowed trade without national taxes and tariffs, NAFTA allowed Mexico to experience a similar duty-free trade. The free-trade agreement allowed for the elimination of tariffs that had previously been in place on U.S.–Mexico trade. Trade volume has steadily increased annually and in 2010, surface trade between the three NAFTA nations reached an all-time historical increase of 24.3% or US$791 billion. The NAFTA trade bloc GDP (PPP) is the world&#x27;s largest with US$17.617 trillion. This is in part attributed to the fact that the economy of the U.S. is the world&#x27;s largest national economy; the country had a nominal GDP of approximately $14.7 trillion in 2010. The countries of NAFTA are also some of each other&#x27;s largest trade partners. The U.S. is the largest trade partner of Canada and Mexico, while Canada and Mexico are each other&#x27;s third-largest trade partners. In 2018, the NAFTA was replaced by the U.S.–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA).

The Caribbean trade bloc (CARICOM) came into agreement in 1973 when it was signed by 15 Caribbean nations. As of 2000, CARICOM trade volume was US$96 billion. CARICOM also allowed for the creation of a common passport for associated nations. In the past decade the trade bloc focused largely on free-trade agreements and under the CARICOM Office of Trade Negotiations free-trade agreements have been signed into effect.

Integration of Central American economies occurred under the signing of the Central American Common Market agreement in 1961; this was the first attempt to engage the nations of this area into stronger financial cooperation. The 2006 implementation of the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) left the future of the CACM unclear. The Central American Free Trade Agreement was signed by five Central American countries, the Dominican Republic, and the U.S. The focal point of CAFTA is to create a free trade area similar to that of NAFTA. In addition to the U.S., Canada also has relations in Central American trade blocs.

These nations also take part in inter-continental trade blocs. Mexico takes a part in the G3 Free Trade Agreement with Colombia and Venezuela and has a trade agreement with the EU. The U.S. has proposed and maintained trade agreements under the Transatlantic Free Trade Area between itself and the European Union; the U.S.–Middle East Free Trade Area between numerous Middle Eastern nations and itself; and the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership between Southeast Asian nations, Australia, and New Zealand.

=== Transport ===
The Pan-American Highway route in the Americas is the portion of a network of roads nearly in length which travels through the mainland nations. No definitive length of the Pan-American Highway exists because the U.S. and Canadian governments have never officially defined any specific routes as being part of the Pan-American Highway, and Mexico officially has many branches connecting to the U.S. border. However, the total length of the portion from Mexico to the northern extremity of the highway is roughly .

The first transcontinental railroad in the U.S. was built in the 1860s, linking the railroad network of the eastern U.S. with California on the Pacific coast. Finished on 10 May 1869 at the famous golden spike event at Promontory Summit, Utah, it created a nationwide mechanized transportation network that revolutionized the population and economy of the American West, catalyzing the transition from the wagon trains of previous decades to a modern transportation system. Although an accomplishment, it achieved the status of first transcontinental railroad by connecting myriad eastern U.S. railroads to the Pacific and was not the largest single railroad system in the world. The Canadian Grand Trunk Railway had, by 1867, already accumulated more than of track by connecting Ontario with the Canadian Atlantic provinces west as far as Port Huron, Michigan, through Sarnia, Ontario.

=== Communications ===
A shared telephone system known as the North American Numbering Plan is an integrated telephone numbering plan of 24 countries and territories: the U.S. and its territories, Canada, Bermuda, and 17 Caribbean nations. In recent months the internet service by Starlink has expanded to cover a number of North American markets.

== Culture ==
The cultures of North America are diverse. The U.S. and English Canada have many cultural similarities, while French Canada has a distinct culture from Anglophone Canada, which is protected by law. Since the U.S. was formed from portions previously part of the Spanish Empire and then independent Mexico, and there has been considerable and continuing immigration of Spanish speakers from south of the U.S.–Mexico border. In the southwest of the U.S. there are many Hispanic cultural traditions and considerable bilingualism. Mexico and Central America are part of Latin America and are culturally distinct from anglophone and francophone North America. However, they share with the United States the establishment of post-independence governments that are federated representative republics with written constitutions dating from their founding as nations. Canada is a federated parliamentary democracy under a constitutional monarchy.

Canada&#x27;s constitution dates to 1867, with confederation, in the British North America Act, but not until 1982 did Canada have the power to amend its own constitution. Canada&#x27;s Francophone heritage has been enshrined in law since the British parliament passed the Quebec Act of 1774. In contrast to largely Protestant Anglo settlers in North America, French-speaking Canadians were Catholic and with the Quebec Act were guaranteed freedom to practice their religion, restored the right of the Catholic Church to impose tithes for its support, and established French civil law in most circumstances.

The distinctiveness of French language and culture has been codified in Canadian law, so that both English and French are designated official languages. The U.S. has no official language, but its national language is English.

The Canadian government took action to protect Canadian culture by limiting non-Canadian content in broadcasting, creating the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Commission to monitor Canadian content. In Quebec, the provincial government established the Quebec Office of the French Language, often called the &quot;language police&quot; by Anglophones, which mandates the use of French terminology and signage in French. Since 1968 the unicameral legislature has been called the Quebec National Assembly. Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day, 24 June, is the national holiday of Quebec and celebrated by francophone Canadians throughout Canada. In Quebec, the school system was divided into Catholic and Protestant, so-called confessional schools. Anglophone education in Quebec has been increasingly undermined.

LGBT culture is prominently displayed in more tolerant regions of North America. This is most significantly exemplified at pride parades in cities across the continent, the two largest being held in New York City and Toronto, respectively.

Latino culture is strong in the southwestern United States, as well as in the New York metropolitan area and Florida, which draw Latin Americans from many countries in the Western hemisphere. Northern Mexico, particularly in the cities of Monterrey, Tijuana, Ciudad Juárez, and Mexicali, is strongly influenced by the culture and way of life of the U.S. Monterrey, a modern city with a significant industrial group, has been regarded as the most Americanized city in Mexico. Northern Mexico, the Western U.S. and Alberta, Canada share a cowboy culture.

The Anglophone Caribbean states have witnessed and participated in the decline of the British Empire and its influence on the region, and its replacement by the economic influence of Northern America in the Anglophone Caribbean. This is partly due to the relatively small populations of the English-speaking Caribbean countries, and also because many of them now have more people living abroad than those remaining at home.

Greenland has experienced many immigration waves from Northern Canada, e.g. by the Thule people. Therefore, Greenland shares some cultural ties with the indigenous peoples of Canada. Greenland is also considered Nordic and has strong Danish ties due to centuries of colonization by Denmark.

=== Popular culture – sports ===

The U.S. and Canada have major sports teams that compete against each other, including baseball, basketball, hockey, and soccer/football. Canada, Mexico, and the U.S. will host the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

The Native American game of lacrosse is considered a national sport in Canada. Curling is an important winter sport in Canada, and the Winter Olympics includes it in the roster. The English sport of cricket is popular in parts of anglophone Canada and very popular in parts of the former British empire, but in Canada is considered a minor sport. Boxing is also a major sport in some countries, such as Mexico, Panama and Puerto Rico, and it is considered one of the main individual sports in the U.S. Canada has a separate Canadian Football League from the U.S. teams.

The following table shows the most prominent sports leagues in North America, in order of average revenue.
