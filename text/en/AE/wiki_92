<text>The population of [[Puerto Rico]] has been shaped by native American settlement, European colonization especially under the Spanish Empire, slavery and economic migration. Demographic features of the population of Puerto Rico include population density, ethnicity, education of the populace, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.

==Population size and structure==
At the 2020 census Puerto Rico had a population of 3.3 million, down from 3.7 million in 2010. The highest population was reached around the year 2000 (3.8 million) and has been decreasing since, due to low fertility and emigration.
===Structure of the population===


==Migration==
Sometime between 400 B.C. and A.D. 100, the Arawak group of Amerindians inhabited Puerto Rico. Around A.D. 600, the Arawaks no longer lived on the island, perhaps because they had integrated with another culture or perhaps because they had been killed by illness. By A.D. 1000, the indigenous Taíno inhabited the island. They called the island Borikén, which is popularly said to mean &quot;land of the valiant one&quot;. This is where the alternative name for Puerto Rico, Borinquen, comes from. Since the late 18th century Puerto Ricans have called themselves some variation of &quot;boricua&quot;, &quot;borincano&quot; and &quot;borinqueño&quot; to embrace their indigenous identity. In the 15th century, the Carib lived on nearby islands and periodically invaded Taíno villages.

===Historical Immigration===

The Spanish conquered the island, assuming government in 1508, colonized it, and assumed hegemony over the natives. The Taíno population dwindled due to disease, tribal warfare, and forced labor, so the Spanish began importing large numbers of slaves from Africa. Spanish men arrived on the island disproportionately to Spanish women; African and Taíno women would sometimes marry them, resulting in a mixed tri-racial ethnicity.

In the late 18th century, the number of African slaves began to dwindle on the island. The British ban on slavery resulted in slave raids on Puerto Rico. Many slaves also escaped to neighboring islands.

During the 19th century large numbers of immigrants from Spain, as well as numerous Spaniards living in former Spanish colonies in South America, also arrived in Puerto Rico (See Spanish immigration to Puerto Rico). Large numbers of Canary Islanders (Isleños) also arrived in great numbers to the island; their influence can be seen today in Puerto Rico&#x27;s culture, cuisine and most notably in the variety of Spanish that is spoken in Puerto Rico.

Although the vast majority of settlers came from Spain, Catholics from France, Ireland, Corsica, Italy, Germany and other European countries were also granted land by Spain as one of the provisions of the &quot;Real Cédula de Gracias de 1815&quot; (Royal Decree of Graces of 1815). These immigrants were allowed to settle on the island, with a certain amount of free land and enslaved persons granted to them. In return, they had to profess fealty to the Spanish Crown. During the early 20th century Jews began to settle in Puerto Rico. The first large group of Jews to settle in Puerto Rico were European refugees fleeing German–occupied Europe in the late 1930s. Puerto Rico&#x27;s economic boom of the 1950s attracted a considerable number of Jewish families from the U.S. mainland, who were joined after 1959 by an influx of Jewish emigres from Fidel Castro&#x27;s Cuba.

The mass immigration that occurred during the 19th century helped the population grow from 155,000 in 1800 to almost 1,000,000 at the close of the century.

===Modern Immigration===
Puerto Rico has continued to receive immigrants in the present-day, especially coming from neighboring countries. According to the 2020 census, by ancestry or birth, there were 53,677 Dominicans, 11,701 Cubans, 5,628 Spaniards, 5,010 Colombians, 4,975 Mexicans, 3,131 Venezuelans, 1,366 Peruvians, and 1,331 Argentineans. People who self identified as Hispanic, Latino, Spanish, Spanish American, and Afro-Latino numbered 8,141 and may be of mixed-Hispanic background, and all other Latin American origin groups numbered 6,344. There were also 29,913 English, 9,700 Italians, 6,307, Germans, 5,024 French, 4,561 Irish, 1,361 Portuguese, and 8,556 all other European-origin groups, a large portion is made up of white Americans of such ancestries. There were also 8,417 African Americans, 2,873 Asian Indians, 2,462 Chinese, and all other groups numbering about 6,000.

Some illegal immigrants, particularly from Haiti, Dominican Republic, and Cuba use Puerto Rico as a temporary stop-over point to get to the US mainland. Non-hispanic people only made up 1.1% of the population of Puerto Rico, the majority of which are made up of U.S. citizens especially White Americans, and to a lesser degree Black Americans. Some non-Puerto Rican Hispanics are U.S.-born. Ethnic Puerto Ricans numbered 3,139,035, representing 95.5% of Puerto Rico&#x27;s population. Some Puerto Ricans engage in Circular migration.

===Emigration===
Emigration has been a major part of Puerto Rico&#x27;s recent history as well. Starting in the post-World War II period waves of Puerto Ricans moved to the continental United States, particularly to New York City, Yonkers, Buffalo, Rochester New York; Newark, Jersey City, Paterson, and Camden, New Jersey; Providence, Rhode Island; Boston, Springfield, Massachusetts; Hartford and New Haven, Connecticut; Cleveland, Ohio; Orlando, Jacksonville, and Tampa, Miami, Florida; Philadelphia, Allentown, Reading, Pennsylvania; and Chicago, Illinois. This continued even as Puerto Rico&#x27;s economy improved and its birth rate declined.

===Race and ethnicity===
====Background====
In the late 1700s, Puerto Rico had laws like the &quot;Regla del Sacar&quot; or &quot;Gracias al Sacar&quot; where a person of mixed ancestry could be considered legally white so long as they could prove that at least one person per generation in the last four generations had also been legally white. Therefore, people of mixed ancestry with known white lineage were classified as white, the opposite of the &quot;one-drop rule&quot; in the United States.

A strong European immigration wave and large importation of slaves from Africa helped increase the population of Puerto Rico sixfold during the 19th century. No major immigration wave occurred during the 20th century.

The federal Naturalization Act, signed into law on March 26, 1790, by President Washington stated that immigrants to the United States had to be White according to the definition under the British Common Law, which the United States inherited. The legal definition of Whiteness differed greatly from White Society&#x27;s informal definition, thus Jews, Romani Peoples, Middle Eastern Peoples and those of the Indian Subcontinent were before 1917 classified as White for Immigration purposes but not considered White by the society at large. The Naturalization Act of 1870, passed during Reconstruction, allowed for peoples of African descent to become U.S. Citizens but it excluded other nonwhites. The U.S. Supreme Court in the case United States v. Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. 649 (1898) declared that all nonwhites who were born in the United States were eligible for citizenship via the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment. U.S. Immigration Policy was first restricted toward Chinese with the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the Gentleman&#x27;s Agreement of 1907 in which Japan voluntarily barred emigration to the United States and the Immigration Act of 1917 or the Asiatic Barred Zone which barred immigrants from all of the Middle East, the Steppes and the Orient, excluding the Philippines which was then a US Colony. European Jews and Romani, although of Asiatic Ancestry, were not affected by the Asiatic Barred Zone, as they held European Citizenship. The Johnson-Reed act of 1924 applied only to the Eastern Hemisphere. The Act imposed immigration quotas on Europe, which allowed for easy immigration from Northern and Western Europe, but almost excluded the Southern and Eastern European Nations. Africa and Asia were excluded altogether. The Western Hemisphere remained unrestricted to immigrate to the United States. Thus under the Immigration Act of 1924 all Hispanics and Caribbeans could immigrate to the United States, but a White family from Poland or Russia could not immigrate. Puerto Rican Citizenship was created under the Foraker Act, Pub.L. 56–191, 31 Stat. 77 but it wasn&#x27;t until 1917 that Puerto Ricans were granted full American Citizenship under the Jones–Shafroth Act (Pub.L. 64–368, 39 Stat. 951). Puerto Ricans, excluding those of obvious African ancestry, were like most Hispanics formally classified as White under U.S. Law.

====Censuses====
The first census by the United States in 1899 reported a population of 953,243 inhabitants, 61.8% of them classified as white, 31.9% as mixed, and 6.3% as black.

According to the 1920 Puerto Rico census, 2,505 individuals immigrated to Puerto Rico between 1910 and 1920. Of these, 2,270 were classified as &quot;white&quot; in the 1920 census (1,205 from Spain, 280 from Venezuela, 180 from Cuba, and 135 from the Dominican Republic).
During the same 10-year period, 7,873 Puerto Ricans emigrated to the U.S. Of these, 6,561 were listed as &quot;white&quot; on the U.S mainland census, 909 as &quot;Spanish white&quot; and 403 as &quot;black&quot;.

Until 1950, the U.S. Bureau of the Census attempted to quantify the racial composition of the island&#x27;s population, while experimenting with various racial taxonomies. In 1960 the census dropped the racial identification question for Puerto Rico but included it again in the year 2000. The only category that remained constant over time was white, even as other racial labels shifted greatly—from &quot;colored&quot; to &quot;Black&quot;, &quot;mulatto&quot; and &quot;other&quot;.
Regardless of the precise terminology, the census reported that the majority of the Puerto Rican population was white from 1899 to 2000.

According to the 2015 Race and Hispanic Origin estimate (2011–2015 American Community Survey) published by the US Census Bureau, the data for Puerto Rico was as follows:
* White alone 2,495,997
* Black or African American alone 301,519
* American Indian and Alaska Native alone 11,775
* Asian alone 10,159
* Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone 129
* Some Other Race alone 431,443
* Two or More Races 332,051
* Hispanic or Latino (of any race) 3,547,288
* White alone, Not Hispanic or Latino 24,900
In 2020, the Census Bureau reported the following data:

* White alone 560,592 
* Black or African American alone 228,711
* American Indian and Alaska Native alone 17,870
* Asian alone 4,001
* Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone 593
* Some Other Race alone 838,316
* Two or More Races 1,635,791
* Hispanic or Latino (of any race) 3,249,043
* White alone, Not Hispanic or Latino 24,548

In the 2020 census, the percentage of the population identifying as white dropped to 17.1%, down from 75.8% in the 2010 census. A similar drop in identification as white was seen among Hispanics in the 50 states and Washington, D.C., where the percentage of Hispanics identifying as white dropped from 53.0% to 20.3%. The change has been attributed to the wording of the Spanish-language version of the census questionnaire.

===Genetic studies===
Puerto Ricans, on average, have genetic contributions from Europeans, West Africans, and Native Americans of approximately 66%, 18%, and 16%, respectively. showed 66% of Puerto Ricans could trace their ancestry to male European ancestors, 18% could trace it to male African ancestors, and 16% could trace it to male Native American ancestors.

===Non-Hispanic population===
In 2020, non-Hispanic residents of Puerto Rico made up 1.1% of the population, up from 1.0% in 2010. Their highest concentrations are in Culebra (10.8%), Vieques (8.0%), Rincón (5.1%), Dorado (3.4%), Luquillo (2.9%), San Juan (2.2%) Guaynabo (2.1%) and Humacao (2.0%).

===Women in the diaspora===
In a study done on Puerto Rican women (of all races) born on the island but living in New York by Carolina Bonilla, Mark D. Shriver and Esteban Parra in 2004, the ancestry proportions corresponding to the three parental populations were found to be 53.3±2.8% European, 29.1±2.3% West African, and 17.6±2.4% Native American based on autosomal ancestry informative markers. Although autosomal markers tests seem to draw a more broad picture than that of single, gender-based mtDNA and Y-Chromosome tests, the problem with autosomal DNA is in the archaic categories used: &quot;European&quot;, &quot;Sub-Saharan African&quot;, &quot;East Asian&quot; &amp; &quot;Native American&quot;. &quot;Asian&quot; (South, North or East) &amp; &quot;North African&quot; are not included. These generalized categories may not take into account the complexity of migratory patterns across the Old World. The study also found that, from the women sampled, 98% had European ancestry markers, 87% had African ancestry markers, 84% had Native American ancestry markers, 5% showed only African and European markers, 4% showed mostly Native American and European markers, 2% showed only African markers, and 2% showed mostly European markers.

==Religion==
There are many religious beliefs represented in the island with Christianity as the religion indicated by the majority in 2010.

Religious breakdown in Puerto Rico (2010):
===Christians===
A recent report providing a full breakdown as to specific religions is not available; the most recent was for 2006.

The Christian Denominational Breakdown was as follows in 2006:


====Catholics====
The Catholic Church has been historically the most dominant religion of the majority of Puerto Ricans, with Puerto Rico having the first dioceses in the Americas. This religion was brought by Spanish colonists. The first dioceses in the Americas, including that of Puerto Rico, were authorized by Pope Julius II in 1511. One Pope, John Paul II, visited Puerto Rico in October 1984. All municipalities in Puerto Rico have at least one Catholic Church, most of which are located at the town center or &quot;plaza&quot;.

An Associated Press article in March 2014 stated that &quot;more than 70 percent of whom identify themselves as Catholic&quot; but provided no source for this information. (It may have been using the 2010 Pew Research Center data.)

The CIA World Factbook however, reports that 85% of the population of Puerto Rico identifies as Roman Catholic, while 15% identify as Protestant and Other. Neither a date or a source for that information is provided and may not be recent.

In November 2014, a Pew Research report, with the sub-title &quot;Widespread Change in a Historically Catholic Region&quot;, indicated that only 56% of Puerto Ricans were Catholic and that 33% were Protestant. This survey was completed between October 2013 and February 2014.

====Protestants====
Protestantism in Puerto Rico was suppressed under Spanish rule. Prior to the Spanish–American War there was only one Protestant church on the island, the Holy Trinity Anglican Church, which was established in 1872 and served the British expatriate community in Ponce. The church was forbidden from ringing its bell, using its front door, or holding services in Spanish until 1898, when American troops landed in Ponce and established freedom of worship. This was the first non-Catholic church in the Spanish Empire in the Americas.

Protestantism grew under American sovereignty due to the work of American missionaries, making contemporary Puerto Rico more interconfessional than in previous centuries, although Catholicism continues to be the dominant religion.

===Muslims===
In 2007, there were over 5,000 Muslims in Puerto Rico, representing about 0.13% of the population. There are eight Islamic mosques spread throughout the island, with most Muslims living in Río Piedras. Puerto Rican converts to Islam continue to occur. &quot;Ties between Latinos and Islam are more than just spiritual, but date back to Spanish history. Many people do not realize that Muslims conquered Spain&quot;. And at times not just individuals, but whole families convert. However, lack of Muslim education in the Island forces some Puerto Rican Muslims to migrate to the States. Islam was brought into Puerto Rico mainly via the Palestinian migration of the 1950s and &#x27;60s. Thus, today there is a strong Palestinian presence among Muslims in Puerto Rico. &quot;They are economically strong and are thus able to pay for a full-time Imaam&quot;.

===Jews===
Puerto Rico is also home to the largest Jewish community in the Caribbean, with 3,000 Jewish inhabitants. Some Puerto Ricans have converted, not only as individuals but as entire families. Puerto Rico is the only Caribbean island in which the Conservative, Reform and Orthodox Jewish movements are represented.

===Other religious practices===
Taíno religious practices have been rediscovered/reinvented by a handful of advocates. According to some sources, starting in about 1840, there have been attempts to create a quasi-indigenous Taíno identity in rural areas of Puerto Rico. This trend accelerated among the Puerto Rican community in the mainland United States in the 1960s. In the 2010 U.S. census, 9,399 people are identified as &quot;Taíno.&quot;

Various African religious practices have been present since the arrival of enslaved Africans. In particular, the Yoruba beliefs of Santería and/or Ifá, and the Kongo-derived Palo Mayombe (sometimes called an African belief system, but rather a way of Bantu lifestyle of Congo origin) find adherence among the few individuals who practice some form of African traditional religion.

<text>The politics of Puerto Rico take place in the framework of a democratic republic form of government that is under the jurisdiction and sovereignty of the United States Congress as an organized unincorporated territory. Since the 1898 invasion of Puerto Rico by the United States during the Spanish–American War, politics in Puerto Rico have been significantly shaped by its status as territory of the United States. The nature of Puerto Rico&#x27;s political relationship with the United States is the subject of ongoing debate in Puerto Rico, in the United States, the United Nations and the international community, with all major political parties in the archipelago calling it a colonial relationship.

As a republican form of government, the government of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is divided into three branches: executive, legislative and judicial, as established by the Constitution of Puerto Rico. The executive power is exercised by the executive branch, which is headed by the governor, advised by a cabinet of secretaries that are independent of the legislature. Legislative power is vested upon the Legislature. Judicial power is exercised by the judiciary, consisting of the Tribunal Supremo de Puerto Rico, the Tribunal de Apelaciones (English: Court of Appeals), and Tribunal de Primera Instancia (English: Courts of First Instance). There is also a Federal Court to hear cases of a federal nature or with federal jurisdiction.

Puerto Rico&#x27;s governor, who is the head of government, and the members of the legislature are elected every four years by popular vote. Puerto Rico&#x27;s legislature is a bicameral body consisting of a Senate and a House. The members of the judicial branch are appointed by the Governor with the approval of the Senate to serve until they reach age 70. Due to the status of Puerto Rico as a territory of the United States, its residents cannot vote in the U.S. presidential elections.

Politics in Puerto Rico revolve around a multi-party political system. The politics of Puerto Rico are dominated by three political parties: the Partido Nuevo Progresista (PNP), the Partido Popular Democratico (PPD), and, to a lesser extent, the Partido Independentista Puertorriqueño (PIP).

== Political history and political parties ==

=== 19th century ===
One year after the United States invasion of the island, Dr. José Celso Barbosa embraced the idea of annexation as a U.S. state as a solution to the colonial situation and founded the Partido Republicano Puertorriqueño in 1899.

Celso Barbosa had been the leader in the Autonomist Party that favored a republican government for Spain. For much of the 19th Century, the principal parties favored Puerto Rico becoming another of the Spanish provinces on equal footing with the mainland provinces in Spanish Europe; such standing was given twice to Puerto Rico and other Spanish overseas territories under liberal governments, but it was revoked many times - before the establishment of the Spanish constitutional monarchy - every time the Spanish monarchs were successful in regaining their royal power during the first half of the 19th century. 

In this context, and following the U.S. annexation of Puerto Rico at the end of the Spanish American War of 1898, Dr. Barbosa returned to the original idea of equal footing, but this time as a full constituent member of the American Republic.

In contrast, Roman Baldorioty de Castro, had been the leader of another faction inside the Autonomist Party, supported a territorial governance for Puerto Rico under Spain, similar to the Canadian model developed by the British. Before Baldorioty de Castro, other leaders had mentioned the possibility of autonomy, generally as an answer to the Spanish insistence in instituting special laws to govern the Spanish territories and overseas provinces.

During the last twenty years under the Spanish flag, the majority of the local parties, with the exception of the Partido Incondicional Español (Unconditional Spanish Party) embraced the idea of autonomy. The Incondicionales accepted whatever Spain had for Puerto Rico and the Crown duly recognized their support by giving aristocratic titles to their party&#x27;s leaders.

=== 20th century ===
==== 1900-1940 ====
The Partido Republicano Puertorriqueño won the elections in 1900 and again in 1902. The new government of Puerto Rico, organized under the Foraker Act of 1900, was a mixture of the British and the American system, somewhat similar to that established for the territory of Orleans after the Louisiana Purchase. The House of Delegates was elected directly by the voters (male, propertied) and the equivalent to the Senate was the Cabinet appointed by the Governor and by the President of the United States. Muñoz-Rivera exiled himself to New York after the defeat, but returned once the Federal Party was no longer useful and joined Rosendo Matienzo Cintrón in organizing the Union Party, also with them was José de Diego.

Matienzo Cintrón had been a Republican, supporting statehood. But two years into the new government, he realized that statehood would not be granted and the desired equality as citizens was not feasible under the United States. He brought with him other former Republicans and practically all of Muñoz-Rivera&#x27;s Federalists into a party that was to bring about the union of all political groups. He was successful, they won the elections of 1904 and all subsequent elections until the 1920s when another defection of Republicans allowed for the creation of yet another party bringing into it persons supporting a status change.

The Union Party, initially supported statehood or an autonomous government, it then later added independence. In fact, Matienzo-Cintrón went from statehood advocate to autonomist to independence advocate as a result of eight years of American civil government in Puerto Rico. The Union Party, from the very beginning, was against the colonial government established under the &quot;Foraker Act&quot;. Rosendo Matienzo Cintrón, Manuel Zeno Gandía, Luis Lloréns Torres, Eugenio Benítez Castaño, and Pedro Franceschi started to organize the Independence Party in 1912, which paved the path for similar movements. The Union Party quickly gained the attention of the colonial governors, all Republicans, who were willing to work closely with them because of their control of the House of Delegates. The local Republicans protested bitterly and, at one point, they took statehood out of their platform – not reinstating it until the early 1920s. Many in the Union Party leadership were lawyers who had contracts with the sugar operations recently bought out and enlarged by the new American owners, thus establishing a close relationship between the nascent middle classes and the American corporate interests.

A coalition between the pro-independence Union Party presided by Antonio R. Barceló and the pro-statehood Partido Republicano Puertorriqueño presided by José Tous Soto called the &quot;Alianza Puertorriqueña&quot; was formed. Differences between Barceló and Tous Soto and Félix Córdova Dávila, the resident commissioner of Puerto Rico in Washington, as to the goals of the alliance became apparent. The Unionist sector of the alliance decided to disaffiliate themselves from the &quot;Alliance.&quot; Because of legal reasons, Barceló was unable to use the name &quot;Union Party&quot; and in 1932, founded the &quot;Liberal Party of Puerto Rico&quot;. The Liberal Party&#x27;s political agenda was the same as the original Union Party&#x27;s agenda and urged independence as a final political solution for Puerto Rico. After the Liberal Party was defeated in the 1936 elections, an assembly was held in Naranjales on May 31, 1937, in which Luis Muñoz Marín presented his ideas as to how the party should be run, however, the majority of the party members objected and blamed him for their defeat. Muñoz Marín considered this action the same as having been expelled from the party. Muñoz Marín and his followers, among which were included Felisa Rincon de Gautier and Ernesto Ramos Antonini, held an assembly in the town of Arecibo founded the &quot;Partido Liberal, Neto, Auténtico y Completo&quot; (&quot;Clear, Authentic and Complete Liberal Party&quot;), claiming to be the true Liberal Party. The Partido Liberal, Neto, Auténtico y Completo, an independent political party, later became the Popular Democratic Party (PPD) which would ironically end up promoting the &quot;Estado Libre Associado&quot; (Free Associated State) status that Barceló, as president of Union Party, had asked for in 1923 under Campbell Bill and which Muñoz Marín had always opposed, instead of independence.

The Puerto Rican Nationalist Party was founded in 1922. It strongly criticized the American colonial regime for its menace to the Spanish and Latin American roots of the Puerto Rican culture. It also advocated for complete independence. The PNP began to grow with the leadership of Dr. Pedro Albizu Campos, who was later jailed by the colonial regime under charges as a subversive leader. On March 21, 1937, a peaceful march was organized in the southern city of Ponce by the nationalists after receiving authorization from the pertinent authorities. The march was organized to commemorate the abolition of slavery and to demand the release of Albizu Campos from federal prison. The permit, however, was revoked by the U.S.-appointed governor of the Island Blanton Winship minutes before the march was to start. The march turned into a bloody event when the Insular Police (&quot;a force somewhat resembling the National Guard of the typical U.S. state&quot; and which answered to governor Winship) opened fire upon, what a U.S. Congressman and others reported were unarmed and defenseless cadets and bystanders alike killing 19 and badly wounding over 200 more, many in their backs while running away. It came to be known as the Ponce massacre.

==== 1940–1968 ====
Luis Muñoz Marín founded the Popular Democratic Party (PPD) in 1940. Their slogan was &quot;Pan, Tierra y Libertad&quot; (Bread, Land and Liberty). The party favored independence from the United States in its initial stages but social and economic reform were priorities in their political agenda.

The Puerto Rican Independence Party was formed six years later by dissidents who saw the PPD moving away from the ideal of independence. During that period, the colonial regime appointed the first Puerto Rican governor, Jesús T. Piñero, until 1948 when the people elected Luis Muñoz Marín, the first elected governor.

The years of 1944–1948 were crucial ones in the direction of the country. Luis Muñoz Marín shifted his goals from independence to state-like autonomy to accommodate better economic circumstances. This led to the U.S. Congress to enact the Public Law 81-600 which led to the Congressional approval of a local constitution drafted by a constitutional assembly elected by Puerto Rico and the renaming of the United States unincorporated territory of Puerto Rico as the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, using the same official name as the commonwealths of the U.S. states of Kentucky, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Virginia, as well as that of other sovereign nation countries such as Australia. The alternative pro-independence Tydings bill had languished in Congress.

In the 1950s, the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party denounced the Constitution and Muñoz Marín support as a sham, and staged a series of uprisings in 1950, known as the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party Revolts of the 1950s, of which the most notable were the ones in Jayuya, Utuado and San Juan, plus the attack on Blair House, and the United States House of Representatives in 1954. Twenty-three people were killed and more than 50 were injured.

Governor Muñoz Marín inaugurated the new status called &quot;Estado Libre Asociado&quot;—or &quot; Free Associated State&quot; in English—and raised the Puerto Rican flag along with La Borinqueña, the official anthem of Puerto Rico, for the first time on July 25, 1952—date in which Puerto Ricans celebrate the Constitution of Puerto Rico.&lt;/ref&gt; See also: Holidays in Puerto Rico

==== 1968–1999 ====
The New Progressive Party (PNP) was founded in August 1967 by Luis A. Ferré, a month after the July 23, 1967, local plebiscite and the year before the PNP won the 1968 elections. The party saw the ideology of annexation as a U.S. state as a civil rights issue. The creation of the New Progressive Party polarized the political arena to a great degree as radical independence groups were formed in the 1970s and the Puerto Rican Socialist Party (PSP), a Marxist and Cuba-friendly party, was created. Two of the radical groups were labeled as terrorist groups by the U.S. Government, Los Macheteros and the Armed Forces of National Liberation (FALN). These groups were viewed by many pro-independence followers as freedom fighters.

In 1972, the PNP lost to a reunified Popular Democratic Party (PPD). Rafael Hernández Colón became the undisputed leader of the PPD at age 36. He was, as the fourth elected governor, in favor of adding more powers to the commonwealth status. One of his projects was the Puerto Rican owned marine transportation. In order to control the costs of marine transport in Puerto Rico, the marine company &quot;Sea Land&quot; was bought to form &quot;Navieras of Puerto Rico&quot; in 1974.

The fifth governor was Carlos Romero Barceló, a supporter of annexation as the U.S. state of Puerto Rico. Under his administration, Section 936 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Tax Code () was implemented as an economic incentive. This allowed American companies to profit in the island without paying taxes. His administration was shadowed by the Cerro Maravilla (Maravilla Hill) affair, where two independence activists were killed by police agents. This created a Watergate-like scandal that was later investigated by the Senate.

In 1980, Romero Barcelo was reelected Governor by a controversial 0.2% margin, but lost control of the Senate and, a year later, the House of Representatives to the PPD. Independence radical groups placed bombs on 11 jet fighters in 1981 in the Muñiz Base (a U.S. military base), and the U.S. removed all of its fighter aircraft from Puerto Rico. Rafael Hernández Colón became the head of government for the second time in 1984, was reelected in 1988 and remained in power until 1992.

Pedro Rosselló became the sixth elected Governor in 1992. He pushed the political status dilemma in Washington, D.C., and sponsored two local non-binding referendums, one in 1993 and another in 1998. While he was elected to a second term, his last four years were met with mounting allegations of corruption. After Rosselló&#x27;s second term ended, former Speaker of the House Edison Misla Aldarondo (PNP) was jailed as well as many members of Rosselló&#x27;s party. Most of the corruption allegations were based on extortion and appropriation of public funds.

=== 21st century ===

==== 2000s ====
The corruption led the PNP to lose the 2000 election and the Governorship when he ran again in 2004. In 2000, Sila María Calderón (PPD) was elected, becoming the first female governor of Puerto Rico, also gaining control of the Senate, presided over by Antonio Fas Alzamora and the House of Representatives, headed by Speaker Carlos Vizcarrondo. The PPD also elected Aníbal Acevedo Vilá as the island&#x27;s non-voting delegate in Congress.

In 2004, Aníbal Acevedo Vilá (PPD) was declared the winner by the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico as governor by about 3,000 votes, but his party lost control of the Senate, which elected PNP Senator Kenneth McClintock as its president, and the House of Representatives, which chose the PNP&#x27;s José Aponte as Speaker, and Puerto Rico&#x27;s seat in Congress, due to the election of Luis Fortuño.

During the 2005–2008 term, former Gov. Rosselló&#x27;s unsuccessful attempt to unseat Senate President McClintock split the New Progressive Party, a split that continued as Rosselló initiated a fourth bid for the governorship against Resident Commissioner Fortuño in an internal primary that was held March 9, 2008, and which he lost. On the PPD side, Acevedo&#x27;s rocky relationship with the PNP-controlled Legislature was compounded with Federal investigations and unsuccessful indictments of his past political fundraising by grand juries in Philadelphia and San Juan, Puerto Rico.

In 2008, Luis Fortuño (PNP) was elected governor, giving the New Progressive Party its largest victory in history and beating incumbent Gov. Aníbal Acevedo Vilá of the Popular Democratic Party (PPD) by more than 223,000 votes. Also the PNP won supermajorities in the Commonwealth&#x27;s House of Representatives and Senate.

==== 2010s ====

The PNP won the seat for Puerto Rico&#x27;s sole delegate to Congress, because of the election of Pedro Pierluisi. Alejandro García Padilla (PPD) was elected as the eleventh Governor of Puerto Rico, by a narrow (0.6%) margin, defeating Fortuño 47.73% to 47.13% in the 2012 gubernatorial elections. On November 8, 2016, Ricardo Rosselló, the son of former governor Pedro Rosselló (PNP) received 41% of the vote defeating five other gubernatorial candidates and was elected the twelfth Governor of Puerto Rico. He was sworn in on January 2, 2017. He resigned in 2019 after mass protest as a result of the Telegramgate.

==== 2020s ====
In the 2020 elections Pedro Pierluisi (PNP) was elected governor with 33% of the vote. The elections marked the first time third-party candidates other than Puerto Rican Independence Party won seats. In the 2020 elections the Popular Democratic Party took a slight majority of the seats in the Puerto Rico House of Representatives.

In April 2023, Puerto Rico&#x27;s Status Act, which seeks to resolve its territorial status and relationship with the United States through a binding plebiscite at the federal level, was reintroduced in the House by Democrats.

In 2020 and 2024 there was referendums on Statehood, in both cases a majority of favored Statehood.

== Political status ==
In 1950, the U.S. Congress gave Puerto Ricans the right to organize a constitutional convention, contingent on the results of a referendum, where the electorate would determine if they wished to organize their own government pursuant to a constitution of their own choosing. Puerto Ricans expressed their support for this measure in a 1951 referendum, which gave voters a yes-or-no choice for the commonwealth status, defined as a &#x27;permanent association with a federal union&#x27; but not choice for independence or statehood. A second referendum was held to ratify the constitution, which was adopted in 1952.

Before approving the new constitution, the Constitutional Convention specified the name by which the body politic would be known. On February 4, 1952, the convention approved Resolution 22 which chose in English the word &quot;Commonwealth&quot;, meaning a &quot;politically organized community&quot; or &quot;state&quot;, which is simultaneously connected by a compact or treaty to another political system. The convention adopted a translation into Spanish of the term, inspired by the Irish saorstát (Free State) of &quot;Estado Libre Asociado&quot; (ELA) to represent the agreement adopted &quot;in the nature of a compact&quot; between the people of Puerto Rico and the U.S. literally translated into English, the phrase means &quot;Associated Free State.&quot;

In 1967, the Legislative Assembly tested the political interests of the Puerto Rican people by passing a plebiscite Act that allowed a vote on the status of Puerto Rico. This constituted the first plebiscite by the Legislature for a choice on three political status options. Puerto Rican leaders had lobbied for such an opportunity repeatedly, in 1898, 1912, 1914, 1919, 1923, 1929, 1932, 1939, 1943, 1944, 1948, 1956, and 1960. The Commonwealth option, represented by the PPD, won with an overwhelming majority of 60.4% of the votes. The Partido Republicano Puertorriqueño and the Puerto Rican Independence Party boycotted the plebiscite.

After the plebiscite, efforts in the 1970s to enact legislation to address the status issue died in Congressional committees. In the 1993 plebiscite, in which Congress played a more substantial role, Commonwealth status was again upheld. In the 1998 plebiscite, all the options were rejected when 50.3% of voters chose the &quot;none of the above&quot; option, favoring the commonwealth status quo by default.

=== International status ===
On November 27, 1953, shortly after the establishment of the Commonwealth, the General Assembly of the United Nations approved Resolution 748, removing Puerto Rico&#x27;s classification as a non-self-governing territory under article 73(e) of the Charter from UN. But the General Assembly did not apply its full list of criteria to Puerto Rico to determine if it has achieved self-governing status.

In August 1977, the Chairman of the Democratic Party of Puerto Rico, Franklin Delano López, testified before the UN Decolonization Committee denouncing the colonial nature of the Commonwealth Status. As a result of his statement, many other statehooders and commonwealth supporters went to the United Nations requesting the end of the colonial status.

=== Political status within the United States ===
Under the Constitution of Puerto Rico, Puerto Rico is described as a Commonwealth and Puerto Ricans have a degree of administrative autonomy similar to that of a U.S. state.
Puerto Ricans were collectively made U.S. citizens in 1917 as a result of the Jones–Shafroth Act. The act was signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson on March 2, 1917. U.S. Federal law approved by the President Harry S. Truman on June 27, 1952, declared all persons born in Puerto Rico on or after January 13, 1941, to be citizens of the U.S. at birth and all persons born in Puerto Rico between April 11, 1899, and January 12, 1941, and meeting certain other technical requirements, and not citizens of the United States under any other Act, were declared to be citizens of the U.S. as of January 13, 1941.

Only the &quot;fundamental rights&quot; under the federal constitution apply to Puerto Rico like the Privileges and Immunities Clause (U.S. Constitution, Article IV, Section 2, Clause 1, also known as the &#x27;Comity Clause&#x27;) that prevents a state from treating citizens of other states in a discriminatory manner, with regard to basic civil rights. The clause also embraces a right to travel, so that a citizen of one state can go and enjoy privileges and immunities in any other state; this constitutional clause was expressly extended to Puerto Rico by the U.S. Congress through the federal law and signed by the President Harry S. Truman in 1947. Other fundamental rights like the Due Process Clause and the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment was expressly extended to Puerto Rico by the U.S. Supreme Court. In a brief concurrence in the judgment of &quot;Torres v. Puerto Rico&quot;, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brennan, argued that any implicit limits from the Insular Cases on the basic rights granted by the Constitution (including especially the Bill of Rights) were anachronistic in the 1970s.

President George H. W. Bush issued a memorandum on November 30, 1992, to heads of executive departments and agencies establishing the current administrative relationship between the federal government and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. This memorandum directs all federal departments, agencies, and officials to treat Puerto Rico administratively as if it were a state, insofar as doing so would not disrupt federal programs or operations.

Puerto Rico does participate in the internal political process of both the Democratic and Republican parties in the U.S., accorded equal-proportional representation in both parties, and delegates from the islands vote in each party&#x27;s national presidential convention.

Puerto Ricans may enlist in the U.S. military. Since 1917, Puerto Ricans have been included in the compulsory draft whenever it has been in effect and more than 400,000 Puerto Ricans have served in the United States Armed Forces. Puerto Ricans have participated in all U.S. wars since 1898, most notably World War I, World War II, the Korean and Vietnam wars, as well as the current Middle Eastern conflicts. Several Puerto Ricans became notable commanders, five have been awarded the Medal of Honor, the highest military decoration in the United States, also several Puerto Ricans have attained the rank of General or Admiral, which requires a Presidential nomination and Senate confirmation. In World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War Puerto Ricans were the most decorated Hispanic soldiers and in some cases they were the first to die in combat.

Puerto Rico has not yet become an independent nation or a state of the Union. It remains a territory of the United States of America. The action of Congress in authorizing and approving, The Commonwealth Constitution is adopted pursuant to the constitutional power of Congress to make necessary rules and regulations concerning the territory of the United States of America. The foreign relations of Puerto Rico, like those of other territories and states, continue to be conducted by the United States of America. Internal government and administration, Puerto Rico occupies a unique position among the territories and states of the United States of America. in requesting Congress to authorize the drafting and adoption of a constitution. Congress has agreed that Puerto Rico shall, under this constitution, be free from any control or interference by Congress in matters relating to internal government and administration, subject only to compliance with the applicable provisions of the federal constitution of the United States of America. Laws that directed or authorized direct interference by the United States federal government in local government affairs, prior to 1952, have been repealed.

=== Implications of the current political status ===

Puerto Rico is an organized unincorporated U.S. territory which has been given internal self-governing powers which, taken together, are referred to as &quot;Commonwealth&quot; status. Puerto Rico has more latitude over its internal affairs than the U.S. territories of Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, or American Samoa.

Puerto Rico has approximately the same degree of authority over its internal affairs as an American state. However, it does not have the sovereignty that a state of the Union has, given that Puerto Rico is a possession of the United States and it is, thus, not protected by the US Constitution to the same degree that states are.

Some differences between Puerto Rico and a state of the American Union are:
* &quot;Unlike states, and federally-recognized Native American reservations, Puerto Rico does not have a zone of reserved sovereignty that is beyond the reach of Congress in the latter&#x27;s exercise of its territorial powers.&quot; That is, Puerto Rico has no recourse to challenge unilateral actions by the United States government that affect citizens of Puerto Rico.
* Some residents of Puerto Rico are exempt from some aspects of the Internal Revenue Code.
* Puerto Rico has international representation in sports and some other culturally international events, similar to sovereign nations.
* Puerto Rico does not have the rights of a state as granted by the US constitution, because it is not a state. These include:
** Lack of voting representation in either House of the U.S. Congress.
** Puerto Rico residents cannot vote in presidential elections.

Despite the fact that the U.S. Federal Government holds ultimate sovereignty over all U.S. citizens and the territory of Puerto Rico, residents of Puerto Rico are without an effective voice in the Federal government. This is not because Puerto Rico residents do not have the right to vote, but rather because the territory itself does not have voting representation in the United States Congress, nor is it represented in the United States Electoral College. Puerto Ricans do, however, play an indirect role in electing the President of the United States, since both the Republican Party and the Democratic Party hold primaries in Puerto Rico, giving Puerto Ricans a voice selecting each party&#x27;s presidential nominee.

Both the Puerto Rican Independence Party and the New Progressive Party outright reject the status quo that permits disfranchisement. The remaining political organization, the Popular Democratic Party, is less active in its opposition of this case of disfranchisement but has officially stated that it favors fixing the remaining &quot;deficits of democracy&quot; that the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush Administrations have publicly recognized in writing through Presidential Task Force Reports.

=== Presidential politics in Puerto Rico ===
Although the Republican Party and Democratic Party chapters in Puerto Rico have selected voting delegates to the national nominating conventions since the early 1900s, public interest in these processes heightened as a result of the efforts of a group of Democratic statehooders led by Franklin Delano López in 1976 to elect delegates supporting former Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter to that year&#x27;s Democratic National Convention. On October 23, 1979, the first primary of a party affiliated to the Democratic National Committee was held in Puerto Rico. Franklin Delano López was elected Chairman of the New Democratic Party of Puerto Rico by the direct votes of 374,000 American citizens residing on the Island. Lopez then moved the Puerto Rican Legislature to adopt a Presidential Primary Law. During the discussion of the Presidential primary Law, Lopez managed to persuade Presidential Chief of Staff, Hamilton Jordan and Timothy Kraft to grant Puerto Rico the right for a more robust delegation, the inclusion of Puerto Rico after Pennsylvania in the roll call of the state in exchange of eliminating from the bill that Puerto Rico was going to be the first Presidential Primary in the Nation. As a result of that effort, the Puerto Rico Legislature approved a law regulating presidential primaries in 1979, the first of which was held in 1980, with George H. W. Bush winning the Republican primary and President Carter beating Senator Edward &quot;Ted&quot; Kennedy in a hard-fought Democratic primary. More than 1.2 million American citizens residing in Puerto Rico participated in the primaries.

In the first internal primary of a National political party, the new slate of statehooders, headed by Franklin Delano López took control of the local Democratic party chapter. In January 1980 after clashing with Governor Carlos Romero Barceló, Lopez was forced to resign the chairmanship of the New Democratic Party in exchange of the Governor becoming the President of Carter&#x27;s campaign in Puerto Rico and throwing the New Progressive Party behind the president&#x27;s re-election efforts. Lopez&#x27; fight with Governor Romero, on behalf of President Carter, paid off and was appointed Deputy Campaign Manager of President Carter national campaign. Lopez efforts moved to Puerto Rico and the status issue at the forefront of the National political discussion. Subsequently, both the statehood faction and the commonwealth shared control on a 50-50 basis from 1984 to 1988 and lost control that year as a result of their defeat in an internal primary that year between PPD forces led by then Senate president Miguel Hernández Agosto and PNP forces led by former Gov. Carlos Romero Barceló. While the PPD Democratic faction controls the Democratic party chapter under the state chairmanship of former senator Roberto Prats, two of the five DNC members residing in Puerto Rico, Senate president Kenneth McClintock and Francisco Domenech are statehooders.

On the Republican side PNP-affiliated statehood Republicans control the GOP local chapter (Republican Party of Puerto Rico), headed by state chair and Aguadilla mayor Carlos Méndez, Republican National Committeeman and Governor Luis Fortuño and Republican National Committeewoman Zoraida Fonalledas.

The 2008 Republican presidential primary was slated to be held in February, while Democrats held their primary in June. Then Senate President and Democratic National Committeeman Kenneth McClintock, former Sen. Roberto Prats, Puerto Rico&#x27;s Democratic State Chair and former PPD gubernatorial candidate José Alfredo Hernández Mayoral were appointed co-chairs of Sen. Hillary Clinton&#x27;s National Hispanic Leadership Council while Young Democrats of America Democratic National Committeeman Francisco Domenech co-chaired Clinton&#x27;s young professionals organization. Prats and McClintock subsequently co-chaired Clinton&#x27;s Puerto Rico campaign, while Francisco Domenech became the Deputy Campaign Manager. Senator Clinton won the Puerto Rico Primary by a 68% to 32% margin. Being the last big primary before the last two states voted on June 3, Puerto Rico&#x27;s Democratic presidential primary attracted historic levels of national media coverage.

Several local politicians have expressed concern that Puerto Rico has become a &quot;piggy bank&quot; for presidential campaigns. Recent examples include Vice President Dick Cheney&#x27;s whirlwind two-hour visit to collect $300,000 in 2006 and Senator Barack Obama&#x27;s 50% longer three-hour trip in November, 2007 to collect $200,000

Speculation, which began in late 2009 by a national media blog and by Grover Norquist, a well-known Republican commentator, mentioned Gov. Fortuño as a long-shot inclusion in a national political ticket.

=== 21st Century===
According to a December 2005 report by the President&#x27;s Task Force on Puerto Rico&#x27;s Status, it is not possible &quot;to bind future (U.S.) Congresses to any particular arrangement for Puerto Rico as a Commonwealth&quot;. This determination was based on articles in the U.S. Constitution regarding territories. Prominent leaders in the pro-statehood and pro-independence political movements agree with this assessment. In 2005 and 2007, two reports were issued by the U.S. President&#x27;s Task Force on Puerto Rico&#x27;s Status. Both reports conclude that Puerto Rico continues to be a territory of U.S. under the plenary powers of the U.S. Congress. Reactions from Puerto Rico&#x27;s two major political parties were mixed. The Popular Democratic Party (PPD) challenged the task force&#x27;s report and committed to validating the current status in all international forums, including the United Nations. It also rejects any &quot;colonial or territorial status&quot; as a status option, and vows to keep working for the enhanced Commonwealth status that was approved by the PPD in 1998 which included sovereignty, an association based on &quot;respect and dignity between both nations&quot;, and common citizenship. The New Progressive Party (PNP) supported the White House Report&#x27;s conclusions and supported bills to provide for a democratic referendum process among Puerto Rico voters. It stated that the U.S. Justice Department in 1959 reiterated that Congress held power over Puerto Rico pursuant to the Territorial Clause of the U.S. Constitution. In a 1996 report on a Puerto Rico status political bill, the &quot;U.S. House Committee on Resources stated that PR&#x27;s current status does not meet the criteria for any of the options for full self-government&quot;. It concluded that Puerto Rico is still an unincorporated territory of the U.S. under the territorial clause, that the establishment of local self-government with the consent of the people can be unilaterally revoked by the U.S. Congress, and that U.S. Congress can also withdraw the U.S. citizenship of Puerto Rican residents of Puerto Rico at any time, for a legitimate Federal purpose. The application of the Constitution to Puerto Rico is limited by the Insular Cases.

On December 21, 2007, the Bush Administration&#x27;s Task Force on Puerto Rico&#x27;s Status reiterated and confirmed that Puerto Rico continues to be a territory of the U.S. under the plenary powers of the U.S. Congress, a position shared by the remaining two-major parties: New Progressive Party and the Puerto Rican Independence Party.

On June 15, 2009, the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization approved a draft resolution calling on the Government of the United States to expedite a process that would allow the Puerto Rican people to exercise fully their inalienable right to self-determination and independence.

Following the reports recommendations the 2009 bill (), was introduced in the United States House of Representatives on May 19, 2009, by Pedro Pierluisi (D-Puerto Rico). The bill would have provided for a referendum giving Puerto Ricans the choice between the options of retaining their present political status, or choosing a new status. If the former option won, the referendum would have been held again every 8 years. If the latter option won, a separate referendum would be held where Puerto Ricans would have been given the option of being admitted as a US State &quot;on equal footing with the other states&quot;, or becoming a &quot;sovereign nation, either fully independent from or in free association with the United States.&quot; The bill enjoyed bi-partisan support in the House of Representatives, with 182 co-sponsors and was reported out of the House Resources Committee on a 30–8 vote. The measure was passed by the House on April 29, 2010. The bill did not pass in the Senate.

On March 16, 2011, the President&#x27;s Task Force on Puerto Rico&#x27;s Status issued a third report that reaffirmed the legal position adopted by the three previous presidents over nearly a quarter century that Puerto Rico remains today &quot;subject to the Territory Clause of the U.S. Constitution (see Report at p. 26), that the territory&#x27;s long-term economic well-being would be enhanced by an early resolution of the political status problem (p. 33) and devotes most of the report to extensive economic analysis and recommendations.

On December 11, 2012, the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico enacted a concurrent resolution to request the President and the Congress of the United States to respond diligently and effectively, and to act on the demand of the people of Puerto Rico, as freely and democratically expressed in the plebiscite held on November 6, 2012, to end, once and for all, its current form of territorial status and to begin the process to admit Puerto Rico to the Union as a State.

On May 15, 2013, headed by non-voting Resident Commissioner Pedro Pierluisi, a group of 119 Democratic and 12 Republican members of Congress introduced H.R. 2000, the Puerto Rico Status Resolution Act to Congress, requesting a process for voting to admit Puerto Rico as a State to be approved and a vote to ratify Puerto Rico as a state. It did not receive a vote in the House.

The nature of Puerto Rico&#x27;s political relationship with the United States is the subject of ongoing debate in the United Nations and the International Community. According to two consecutive Bush Administration President&#x27;s Task Force Reports, the latest of which was issued on December 21, 2007 Puerto Rico is an unincorporated organized territory of the United States, subject to the plenary powers of the United States government. The Popular Democratic Party has challenged the Bush Administration&#x27;s Task Force Reports stating that in 1953 Puerto Rico achieved a compact of association between both nations that was recognized by the United Nations. Nonetheless, the aforementioned U.S. Presidential and Congressional Reports state that the current prerogatives assumed by the Puerto Rico government are delegated by the U.S. Congress and may be amended or eliminated at its sole behest.

In a letter sent by the former governor of Puerto Rico to the former U.S. Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice and the Co-Chairs of the White House&#x27;s Presidential Task Force on Puerto Rico&#x27;s Status on the Bush administration, former governor Acevedo Vilá stated:

:&quot;My Administration&#x27;s position is very clear: if the Task Force and the Bush Administration stand by their 2005 conclusions, then for over 50 years the U.S Government has perpetuated a &#x27;monumental hoax&#x27; on the people of Puerto Rico, on the people of the United States and on the international community. If the 2005 report articulates the new official position of the United States, the time has come now for the State Department to formally notify the United Nations of this new position and assume the international legal consequences. You cannot have a legal and constitutional interpretation for local, political purposes and a different one for the international community. If it is a serious, relevant document, the report must have international consequences. Alternatively, the Task Force may review and amend the 2005 conclusions to make them consistent with legal and historical precedent, and therefore allow future status developments based on a binding compact.&quot;

On December 15, 2022, the U.S. House of Representatives voted in favor of the Puerto Rico Status Act. The act sought to resolve Puerto Rico&#x27;s status and its relationship to the United States through a binding plebiscite.

In September 2023, Roger Wicker reintroduced legislation in the United States Congress on the territorial status of Puerto Rico. a two-round consultation process. The first vote is scheduled for August 4, 2024, where Puerto Ricans will have the choice between four alternatives: annexation to the United States, independence, sovereignty in free association, and a free state associated with the United States.

In July 2024, Governor Pedro Pierluisi calls a plebiscite on the status of Puerto Rico in November 2024. For the first time, the island&#x27;s current status as a U.S. territory will not be an option during the non-binding plebiscite. The executive order follows the U.S. House of Representatives&#x27; approval in 2022 of a bill to help Puerto Rico move toward a change in territorial status. Voters have a choice between statehood, independence, or independence with free association, the terms of which would be negotiated regarding foreign affairs, U.S. citizenship, and use of the U.S. dollar. There was three choices: statehood, independence, and independence with free association with the United States (There was no option to maintains status). The top choice was 57% voted for Statehood (as part of the USA) from 528 thousand votes.

On February 15, 2025, the Puerto Rico House of Representatives approved a resolution on the legal status of Puerto Rico, &#x27;the resolution, requests that &quot;the President and Congress of the United States of America respond promptly and act in accordance with the demands of the citizens of Puerto Rico.

<text>Telecommunications in Puerto Rico includes radio, television, fixed and mobile telephones, and the Internet.

Broadcasting in Puerto Rico is regulated by the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC).

==History==
Telegraph service was inaugurated in 1869, responding to an 1864 order by Spanish Governor Felix Maria Mesian. By 1872, the entire island had telegraph service as well as international connections to the rest of the Caribbean and Europe.

The Puerto Rico Communications Authority () was created with Law No. 212, on May 12, 1942. Five years later, the department was located at 1314 Juan Ponce de León Avenue in Santurce.

== Radio ==

* Stations: 140 radio stations (as of January 2015).

== Television ==

WIPR-TV (&quot;Wonderful Island of Puerto Rico&quot;) was inaugurated on January 26, 1949.
* Stations: more than 30 TV stations operating; three stations of the US Armed Forces Radio and Television Service; cable TV subscription services are available (2007).

<text>[[Transportation]] in [[Puerto Rico]] includes a system of roads, highways, freeways, airports, ports and harbors, and railway systems, serving a population of approximately 4 million year-round. It is funded primarily with both local and federal government funds.

==Airports==

Puerto Rico has a total of 30 airports (3 of which are international), including one in each of the smaller islands of Vieques and Culebra. The largest airport in terms of passenger traffic is Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport, and consists of two runways and three concourses. It is by far the busiest airport in Puerto Rico, with direct connections to most major cities in the mainland United States, Latin America, Canada, the Caribbean, and Spain.

* Puerto Rico has 21 airports with paved runways, of which:
** 3 airports with more than of runway.
** 3 airports with runways ranging between and .

==Seaports &amp; harbors==

Sea-based transportation of any merchandise or persons shipped entirely or even partly by water between U.S. points—either directly or indirectly via one or any number of foreign points—U.S. Federal Law requires that said items or persons must travel in U.S.-built, U.S.-crewed, U.S.-citizen owned vessels that are U.S.-documented by the Coast Guard for such maritime &quot;cabotage&quot; carriage. This transportation/trade restriction includes Puerto Rico under the Jones Act of 1920 (Merchant Marine Act of 1920). The Jones Act and various other United States laws that govern the domestic and domestic-foreign-domestic transportation of merchandise and passengers by water between two points in the United States, including Puerto Rico, have been extended to that island-territory since the initial years of United States&#x27; political relations. Currently, the only providers who ship from the United States to Puerto Rico are Crowley Maritime, TOTE Maritime, and Trailer Bridge.

Strictly construed, the Jones Act refers only to Section 27 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, (; 19 CFR 4.80 and 4.80(b)), which has come to bear the name of its original sponsor, Sen. Wesley L. Jones. Another law that was enacted in 1886 requires essentially the same standards for the transport of passengers between U.S. points, directly or indirectly transported through foreign ports or foreign points (46 App. U.S.C. 289; 19 CFR 4.80(a)). However, since the mid-1980s, as part of a joint effort between the cruise ship industry that serves Puerto Rico and Puerto Rican politicians such as then Resident Commissioner, U.S. non-voting Representative Baltasar Corrada del Río, obtained a limited-exception since no U.S. cruise ships that were Jones Act-eligible were participating in said market.

The application of these coastwise shipping laws and their imposition on Puerto Rico consist in a serious restriction of free trade and have been under scrutiny and controversy due to the apparent contradictory rhetoric involving the United States Government&#x27;s sponsorship of free trade policies around the world, while its own national shipping policy (cabotage law) is essentially mercantilist and based on notions foreign to free-trade principles.

===Major ports===
* San Juan Port - Mainly divided in three: one in Old San Juan which includes cargo/freight and cruise ships, the Pan American Port Terminal in Isla Grande section mostly for cruise ships, and Puerto Nuevo Bay, exclusively for freight/cargo ships the belong to Guaynabo City not to San Juan. It is the main port of the island.
* Port of Ponce - The second largest port in Puerto Rico and can handle both freight/cargo and cruise ships. It is currently undergoing a significant expansion (see Port of the Americas), with plans to convert it to an international shipping hub.
* Port of Mayagüez - The third largest port in Puerto Rico. It is mainly used for freight/cargo ships but is also home to the Dominican Republic-Puerto Rico passenger ferry and has also been used for cruise ships.

===Minor ports and harbors===
The following are minor ports and harbors used for small freight/cargo ships, fishing vessels, and private boats/yachts: Guánica, Guayanilla, Guayama, Fajardo, Culebra, and Vieques.

There are ferries between Ceiba-Culebra and Ceiba-Vieques; between San Juan and Cataño; and between Ponce and Caja de Muertos (Coffin Island).

There are several private marinas in Puerto Rico for boats and yachts, the largest being Puerto del Rey in Fajardo and Club Naútico de Ponce.

===Federal restrictions===
The Merchant Marine Act of 1920 (also known as the Jones Act) prevents foreign-flagged ships from carrying cargo between two American ports (a practice known as cabotage). Because of the Jones Act, foreign ships inbound with goods from Central and South America, Western Europe, and Africa cannot stop in Puerto Rico, offload Puerto Rico-bound goods, load mainland-bound Puerto Rico-manufactured goods, and continue to U.S. ports. Instead, they must proceed directly to U.S. ports, where distributors break bulk and send Puerto Rico-bound manufactured goods to Puerto Rico across the ocean by U.S.-flagged ships.

Puerto Rican consumers ultimately bear the expense of transporting goods again across the Atlantic and Caribbean Sea on U.S.-flagged ships subject to the extremely high operating costs imposed by the Jones Act. This also makes Puerto Rico less competitive with Caribbean ports as a shopping destination for tourists from home countries with much higher taxes (like mainland states) even though prices for non-American manufactured goods in theory should be cheaper since Puerto Rico is much closer to Central and South America, Western Europe, and Africa.

The local government of Puerto Rico has requested several times to the U.S. Congress to exclude Puerto Rico from the Jones Act restrictions without success. The most recent measure has been taken by the 17th Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico through R. Conc. del S. 21. These measures have always received support from all the major local political parties. In 2013 the Government Accountability Office published a report which concluded that &quot;repealing or amending the Jones Act cabotage law might cut Puerto Rico shipping costs&quot; and that &quot;shippers believed that opening the trade to non-U.S.-flag competition could lower costs.&quot; The report, however, concluded that the effects of modifying the application of the Jones Act for Puerto Rico are highly uncertain for both Puerto Rico and the United States, particularly for the U.S. shipping industry and the military preparedness of the United States.

In February 2025, Governor Jennifer Gonzalez-Colón announced a request by the government of Puerto Rico for a permanent exemption from air cabotage laws in Puerto Rico.

==Rail transportation==
===Current systems===
* Tren Urbano - Provides passenger train service between various points of the San Juan Metropolitan Area, between Bayamón, Guaynabo and several important sections of San Juan.
* Port of Ponce Railroad - The only industrial railroad operating on the entire island and located within the Puerto de Las Américas in Ponce, Puerto Rico. It consists of a small railroad yard and a railroad ferry terminal. About twice monthly, the railroad ferry transports tanker cars on a barge between Mobile, Alabama and the Ponce rail terminal, delivering chemicals for Puerto Rico&#x27;s pharmaceutical industry.
* Tourism Railroads - Several locomotives are used for tourism and recreational services, such as &quot;El Parque del Tren&quot; in Bayamón (demolished to make way for the &quot;Tren Urbano&quot;) and the historic narrow gauge old sugarcane plantation &quot;Tren del Sur&quot; in Arroyo (currently abandoned but with plans for restoration).

===Defunct systems===
The Puerto Rico train system flourished during the late 19th and early 20th century due to a large sugar cane industry there. Most, if not all, of these system were privately owned. Vieques, an island-municipality, also had the system connecting its sugar cane plantations.

During the 1870s and 1890s, Puerto Rico did not have a national railroad system, but the city of Mayagüez did have a small passenger rail system for transporting its residents mainly along the Mendez Vigo Avenue.

The main system can be traced back to 1891, when the northern line was built between San Juan (Martín Peña sector) and Manatí. The system was expanded to include all the western coastal towns, providing a link which would allow passengers to travel between the northern and southern parts of the island in less than a day for the first time in its history. Before its downfall, the Puerto Rico railroad system operated in all major cities, with tracks and stations along most of the coastal towns and direct lines to all major sugar refineries.

However, when Puerto Rico changed its mostly agricultural economy to an industrialized one, and the U.S. and Puerto Rican governments started investing heavily in interstate highways and freeways, the railroad business soon collapsed. Passenger travel ceased in 1953, while the commercial train system (mostly for the sugar cane industry) continued operating until 1957.

==Road transportation==

Puerto Rico has an extensive system of roads and highways featuring tolled freeways (&quot;autopistas&quot;). Some are designated as Interstate Highways; although these routes do not connect to the contiguous United States, and are unsigned as such, they still receive funding in a similar fashion to the other Interstates on the U.S. mainland. In total, there are more than 8,950 miles (14,400 km, 1999 est.) of paved road. Some of the major highways are:

* PR-1 - Original main road between San Juan and Ponce before the completion of PR-52. It is now mostly used by people living nearby and as a scenic route.
* PR-2 - Main freeway/highway/urban primary highway between/through Ponce, Mayagüez, Aguadilla, and Arecibo. Original main highway between Arecibo and San Juan before completion of PR-22 (currently undergoing a conversion to a freeway between Ponce and Mayagüez). This is the longest road in Puerto Rico.
* PR-3 - (65th Infantry Avenue) Original main highway/urban primary highway between/through Salinas, Guayama, Humacao, Fajardo and San Juan (before completion of PR-52, PR-53, PR-66, and PR-26).
* PR-22 - Main freeway between San Juan and Hatillo (plans are under way to extend the freeway to Aguadilla).
* PR-52 (Las Américas Expressway and/or Luis A. Ferré Expressway) - Main freeway between San Juan and Ponce.
* PR-10 - Main highway between Ponce and Arecibo (Currently under construction. The final section between Adjuntas and Utuado scheduled to open in 2015).
* PR-53 - Main freeway between Salinas, Guayama, Yabucoa, Humacao and Fajardo (currently under construction: section between Salinas and Guayama and Humacao to Fajardo are complete and open; while section between Guayama, Yabucoa and Humacao are currently under construction).
* PR-66 - Main freeway between Canóvanas, Carolina, San Juan, and Río Grande.

==Urban transportation==

Transportation in Puerto Rico is heavily dependent on automobile transportation. Nevertheless, the government has increased investment in public transportation in an attempt to decrease vehicle dependency and road congestion. The island&#x27;s metro area is serviced with three major public transportation systems:

* The 10.7 mile (17.2 km) metro system called &quot;Tren Urbano&quot; with a total of 16 stations. The project, which began operations in late 2004 cost a total of $2.25 billion and was more than $1 billion over budget and four years late. However, the &quot;subsidized&quot; Tren Urbano has received far less ridership than was originally projected and has failed to make a significant impact on reducing the island&#x27;s metropolitan area traffic.
* A daily ferry service known as the Cataño Ferry, (&quot;La Lancha de Cataño&quot; in Spanish) which operates a route across San Juan Bay between Old San Juan and the municipality of Cataño.
* Metropolitan Bus Authority (&quot;Autoridad Metropolitana de Autobuses&quot; or AMA in Spanish) provides daily bus transportation to residents of San Juan, Guaynabo, Bayamón, Trujillo Alto, Cataño, and Carolina through 30 different routes. Its fleet consists of 277 regular buses and 35 buses for handicapped persons, and its ridership is estimated at 3,800 on work days.

Most cities and towns also have a Jitney-type taxi system locally called &quot;Carros Públicos&quot;. Each town has a central taxi terminal usually within walking distance of the town&#x27;s central plaza where taxis are stationed, and they provide transportation through local and islandwide routes. In February 2014, the islandwide system of Carros Públicos consisted of over 3,000 vehicles authorized by the &quot;Comisión de Servico Público&quot; (Public Service Commission), and it covered almost 500 routes. At approximately 130,000 passengers per day, in 2014 the Públicos system handled over five times the daily passenger volume of the island&#x27;s largest international airport, the Luis Muñoz Marín.

<text>The military defense of [[Puerto Rico]] is the responsibility of the United States as part of the Treaty of Paris. Locally, Puerto Rico has its own National Guard, the [[Puerto Rico National Guard]], and its own state defense force, the Puerto Rico State Guard, which, by local law, is under the authority of the Puerto Rico National Guard. The commander-in-chief of both forces is the governor of Puerto Rico, currently Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colón, who delegates his authority to the Puerto Rico Adjutant General, currently Major General José J. Reyes. The Adjutant General, in turn, delegates the authority over the State Guard to another officer but retains the authority over the Puerto Rico National Guard as a whole. At the national level, the commander-in-chief is the President of the United States, currently Donald J. Trump.

A branch of the U.S. Army National Guard is stationed in Puerto Rico —known as the Puerto Rico Army National Guard— which performs missions equivalent to those of the Army National Guards of the different states of the United States, including ground defense, disaster relief, and control of civil unrest. The local National Guard also incorporates a branch of the U.S. Air National Guard —known as the Puerto Rico Air National Guard— which performs missions equivalent to those of the Air National Guards of the U.S. states.

==Military facilities in Puerto Rico==

The former Ramey Air Force Base in Aguadilla has been closed for decades, and no other Air Force Bases or Naval Air Stations remain. The Puerto Rico Air National Guard no longer has any fighter planes within its jurisdiction. On January 12, 1981, a group called the Boricua Popular Army, better known as &quot;Los Macheteros&quot;, claimed responsibility for blowing up six A-7 Corsair II aircraft at the Muñiz Air National Guard Base; a Puerto Rico Air National Guard base at a loss of $40 million. Responsibility for the air defense of Puerto Rico now rests with USAF or US Navy fighters that would be flown in case of a military emergency.

At different times in the 20th century, the U.S. had about 25 military or naval installations in Puerto Rico, some very small ones, as well as large installations. The largest of these installations were the former Roosevelt Roads Naval Station in Ceiba, the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station, and the Atlantic Fleet Weapons Training Facility (AFWTF) on Vieques (all now closed), the National Guard training facility at Camp Santiago in Salinas, Fort Allen in Juana Diaz, the Army&#x27;s Fort Buchanan in San Juan, the former U.S. Air Force Ramey Air Force Base in Aguadilla, and the Puerto Rico Air National Guard at Muñiz Air Force base in San Juan.

The former U.S. Navy facilities at Roosevelt Roads, Vieques, and Sabana Seca have been deactivated and partially turned over to the local government. Other than U.S. Coast Guard and Puerto Rico National Guard facilities, there are only two remaining military installations in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Army&#x27;s small Ft. Buchanan (supporting local veterans and reserve units) and the PRANG(Puerto Rico Air National Guard) Muñiz Air Base (the C-130 Fleet). In recent years, the U.S. Congress has considered their deactivations, but these have been opposed by diverse public and private entities in Puerto Rico - such as retired military who rely on Ft. Buchanan for the services available there.

The coastal defense of Puerto Rico is the responsibility of the U.S. Navy from ships at sea, and the U.S. Coast Guard.

The U.S. Coast Guard has a significant presence in Puerto Rico. Located on what was formerly Ramey Air Force Base, the Coast Guard maintains what is now referred to as &quot;Coast Guard Air Station Borinquen&quot;. HH-65C helicopters operate out of Borinquen performing search-and-rescue as well as law-enforcement missions. On a continual basis, Coast Guard fixed-wing airplanes, such as the C-130 Hercules search-and-rescue plane, stationed primarily in Florida fly to Puerto Rico to support these missions.

U.S. Coast Guard cutters visit Puerto Rican waters periodically in their missions of coastal patrol and search-and-rescue. U.S. Navy ships visit Puerto Rican waters on an as-required basis, just like they visit all American waters, international oceans, and foreign ones, too.

On &quot;La Puntilla&quot; in Old San Juan the Coast Guard base its small, but capable surface fleet of several long cutters and other patrol boats. These boats and cutters work hand in hand with the air station responding to any mission that they may be called upon to perform.

== Military personnel in Puerto Rico ==
A significant number of Puerto Ricans participate as members and work for the U.S. Armed Forces, largely as National Guard members and civilian employees. The size of the overall military-related community in Puerto Rico is estimated to be 100,000 individuals. This includes retired personnel.
Fort Buchanan has about 4,000 military and civilian personnel. In addition, approximately 17,000 people are members of the Puerto Rico Army and Puerto Rico Air National Guard, or the U.S. Reserve forces. Puerto Rican soldiers have served in every US military conflict from World War I to the current military engagement known by the United States and its allies as the War against Terrorism.

A number of Puerto Rican colleges and universities have the Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (ROTC) programs. Army ROTC programs are offered at the American University of Puerto Rico, the Caribbean University, the University of Puerto Rico - Arecibo, the University of Puerto Rico – Bayamon Technological University College, the University of Puerto Rico – Carolina Regional College, the University of Puerto Rico - Cayey, the University of Puerto Rico - Mayagüez, and the University of Puerto Rico - Rio Piedras. Air Force ROTC programs are offered at the University of Puerto Rico - Bayamon Technological University College, the University of Puerto Rico - Mayagüez, and the University of Puerto Rico - Rio Piedras.

The U.S. Military has sought to form alliances with Hispanic organizations to promote military recruitment. In January 1999, leaders of National Hispanic organizations in collaboration with the U.S. Army held the Hispanic Leadership Summit &#x27;99. The &quot;Education and Career Opportunities for Hispanic Youth in America&#x27;s Army&quot; summit included the participation of leaders of the US Army as well as leaders of national Hispanic organizations including ASPIRA, the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU), the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), the National Association of Hispanic Publications (NAHP), the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials (NALEO), the National Council of La Raza (NCLR), SER jops for progress, and the members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. At the summit, the director of the LULAC National Educational Service Center (LNESC), Richard Royball commented, &quot;Based on our mutually beneficial partnership, we would encourage other Hispanic organizations to ally themselves with the US Army.&quot; LNESC promotes military recruitment in educational service centers in several US cities and in Puerto Rico.

== Military and Naval uses of Puerto Rico ==
The US military installations in Puerto Rico are part of the US Northern Command (USNORTHCOM). USNORTHCOM has authority over all US military operations that take place throughout the Northern Area of Responsibility. US Fleet Forces Command has authority over all US Naval activity in the waters of the Caribbean. Air Forces North has authority over all US military flights and air operations over the Caribbean. Marine Forces North has authority over all USMC operations in the Caribbean, while US Army North has authority over all US Army operations in the Caribbean. US Special Operations North has authority over all special operations in the Caribbean. With the closing of the Roosevelt Roads and Vieques Island training facilities, the US Navy has basically exited from Puerto Rico, except for the ships that steam by, and the only significant military naval presence in the island is the U.S. Navy Reserve Naval Operational Support Center Puerto Rico (NOSC Puerto Rico) at Fort Buchanan, the Puerto Rican Army and Air National Guards. The U.S. Coast Guard maintains presence at Coast Guard Air Station Borinquen and Coast Guard Station San Juan.

The U.S. Navy&#x27;s largest training area for the U.S. Atlantic Fleet used to be in Puerto Rico and in the Atlantic Ocean surrounding the island, but this was ended after President George W. Bush ordered the closure of the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station and the Vieques Island training grounds.

Through the years, the United States had conducted several military training exercises in Puerto Rico, the largest of these being Operation Springboard and Operation Readex. These exercises included thousands of personnel and involve air, sea, and land operations, and include training with live ammunition.

On top of training exercises, the US used Puerto Rico as a base to rehearse and launch military operations in Latin America and throughout the world. Operations launched from Puerto Rico include the 1954 intervention in Guatemala; the 1965 invasion of the Dominican Republic; the 1983 invasion of Grenada; the 1989 invasion of Panama; support of Salvadoran military; preparation for operation Desert Storm and Desert Fox in Iraq; and preparation for the War in Yugoslavia.

Near Aguada the United States Marine Corps operates an LF-transmitter with a 367.3 meters tall guyed mast, the tallest man-made object in the Caribbean area .

<text>In geometry, a polyhedron (: polyhedra or polyhedrons; ) is a three-dimensional figure with flat polygonal faces, straight edges and sharp corners or vertices. The term &quot;polyhedron&quot; may refer either to a solid figure or to its boundary surface. The terms solid polyhedron and polyhedral surface are commonly used to distinguish the two concepts. Also, the term &quot;polyhedron&quot; is often used to refer implicitly to the whole structure formed by a solid polyhedron, its polyhedral surface, its faces, its edges, and its vertices.

There are many definitions of polyhedron. Nevertheless, the polyhedron is typically understood as a generalization of a two-dimensional polygon and a three-dimensional specialization of a polytope, a more general concept in any number of dimensions. Polyhedra have several general characteristics that include the number of faces, topological classification by Euler characteristic, duality, vertex figures, surface area, volume, interior lines, Dehn invariant, and symmetry. The symmetry of a polyhedron means that the polyhedron&#x27;s appearance is unchanged by the transformation such as rotating and reflecting.

The &quot;convex polyhedron&quot; is well-defined with several equivalent standard definitions, one of which is a polyhedron that is a convex set, or the polyhedral surface that bounds it. Every convex polyhedron is the convex hull of its vertices, and the convex hull of a finite set of points is a polyhedron. There are many families of convex polyhedra, and the most common examples are cube and the family of pyramids.

==Definition==
Convex polyhedra are well-defined, with several equivalent standard definitions. However, the formal mathematical definition of polyhedra that are not required to be convex has been problematic.
Many definitions of &quot;polyhedron&quot; have been given within particular contexts, some more rigorous than others, and there is no universal agreement over which of these to choose.
Some of these definitions exclude shapes that have often been counted as polyhedra (such as the self-crossing polyhedra) or include
shapes that are often not considered as valid polyhedra (such as solids whose boundaries are not manifolds). As Branko Grünbaum observed,

Nevertheless, there is general agreement that a polyhedron is a solid or surface that can be described by its vertices (corner points), edges (line segments connecting certain pairs of vertices),
faces (two-dimensional polygons), and that it sometimes can be said to have a particular three-dimensional interior volume.
One can distinguish among these different definitions according to whether they describe the polyhedron as a solid, whether they describe it as a surface, or whether they describe it more abstractly based on its incidence geometry.
* A common and somewhat naive definition of a polyhedron is that it is a solid whose boundary can be covered by finitely many planes or that it is a solid formed as the union of finitely many convex polyhedra. Natural refinements of this definition require the solid to be bounded, to have a connected interior, and possibly also to have a connected boundary. The faces of such a polyhedron can be defined as the connected components of the parts of the boundary within each of the planes that cover it, and the edges and vertices as the line segments and points where the faces meet. However, the polyhedra defined in this way do not include the self-crossing star polyhedra, whose faces may not form simple polygons, and some of whose edges may belong to more than two faces.
* Definitions based on the idea of a bounding surface rather than a solid are also common. For instance, defines a polyhedron as a union of convex polygons (its faces), arranged in space so that the intersection of any two polygons is a shared vertex or edge or the empty set and so that their union is a manifold. If a planar part of such a surface is not itself a convex polygon, O&#x27;Rourke requires it to be subdivided into smaller convex polygons, with flat dihedral angles between them. Somewhat more generally, Grünbaum defines an &quot;acoptic polyhedron&quot; to be a collection of simple polygons that form an embedded manifold, with each vertex incident to at least three edges and each two faces intersecting only in shared vertices and edges of each. Cromwell&#x27;s &quot;Polyhedra&quot; gives a similar definition but without the restriction of at least three edges per vertex. Again, this type of definition does not encompass the self-crossing polyhedra. Similar notions form the basis of topological definitions of polyhedra, as subdivisions of a topological manifold into topological disks (the faces) whose pairwise intersections are required to be points (vertices), topological arcs (edges), or the empty set. However, there exist topological polyhedra (even with all faces triangles) that cannot be realized as acoptic polyhedra.

* One modern approach is based on the theory of abstract polyhedra. These can be defined as partially ordered sets whose elements are the vertices, edges, and faces of a polyhedron. A vertex or edge element is less than an edge or face element (in this partial order) when the vertex or edge is part of the edge or face. Additionally, one may include a special bottom element of this partial order (representing the empty set) and a top element representing the whole polyhedron. If the sections of the partial order between elements three levels apart (that is, between each face and the bottom element, and between the top element and each vertex) have the same structure as the abstract representation of a polygon, then these partially ordered sets carry exactly the same information as a topological polyhedron. However, these requirements are often relaxed, to instead require only that sections between elements two levels apart have the same structure as the abstract representation of a line segment. (This means that each edge contains two vertices and belongs to two faces, and that each vertex on a face belongs to two edges of that face.) Geometric polyhedra, defined in other ways, can be described abstractly in this way, but it is also possible to use abstract polyhedra as the basis of a definition of geometric polyhedra. A &quot;realization&quot; of an abstract polyhedron is generally taken to be a mapping from the vertices of the abstract polyhedron to geometric points, such that the points of each face are coplanar. A geometric polyhedron can then be defined as a realization of an abstract polyhedron. Realizations that omit the requirement of face planarity, that impose additional requirements of symmetry, or that map the vertices to higher dimensional spaces have also been considered. Unlike the solid-based and surface-based definitions, this works perfectly well for star polyhedra. However, without additional restrictions, this definition allows degenerate or unfaithful polyhedra (for instance, by mapping all vertices to a single point) and the question of how to constrain realizations to avoid these degeneracies has not been settled.

In all of these definitions, a polyhedron is typically understood as a three-dimensional example of the more general polytope in any number of dimensions. For example, a polygon has a two-dimensional body and no faces, while a 4-polytope has a four-dimensional body and an additional set of three-dimensional &quot;cells&quot;.
However, some of the literature on higher-dimensional geometry uses the term &quot;polyhedron&quot; to mean something else: not a three-dimensional polytope, but a shape that is different from a polytope in some way. For instance, some sources define a convex polyhedron to be the intersection of finitely many half-spaces, and a polytope to be a bounded polyhedron. The remainder of this article considers only three-dimensional polyhedra.

== General characteristics ==
===Number of faces===
Polyhedra may be classified and are often named according to the number of faces. The naming system is based on Classical Greek, and combines a prefix counting the faces with the suffix &quot;hedron&quot;, meaning &quot;base&quot; or &quot;seat&quot; and referring to the faces. For example a tetrahedron is a polyhedron with four faces, a pentahedron is a polyhedron with five faces, a hexahedron is a polyhedron with six faces, etc. For a complete list of the Greek numeral prefixes see , in the column for Greek cardinal numbers. The names of tetrahedra, hexahedra, octahedra (eight-sided polyhedra), dodecahedra (twelve-sided polyhedra), and icosahedra (twenty-sided polyhedra) are sometimes used without additional qualification to refer to the Platonic solids, and sometimes used to refer more generally to polyhedra with the given number of sides without any assumption of symmetry.

===Topological classification===
Some polyhedra have two distinct sides to their surface. For example, the inside and outside of a convex polyhedron paper model can each be given a different colour (although the inside colour will be hidden from view). These polyhedra are orientable. The same is true for non-convex polyhedra without self-crossings. Some non-convex self-crossing polyhedra can be coloured in the same way but have regions turned &quot;inside out&quot; so that both colours appear on the outside in different places; these are still considered to be orientable. However, for some other self-crossing polyhedra with simple-polygon faces, such as the tetrahemihexahedron, it is not possible to colour the two sides of each face with two different colours so that adjacent faces have consistent colours.
In this case the polyhedron is said to be non-orientable. For polyhedra with self-crossing faces, it may not be clear what it means for adjacent faces to be consistently coloured, but for these polyhedra it is still possible to determine whether it is orientable or non-orientable by considering a topological cell complex with the same incidences between its vertices, edges, and faces.

A more subtle distinction between polyhedron surfaces is given by their Euler characteristic, which combines the numbers of vertices formula_1, edges formula_2, and faces formula_3 of a polyhedron into a single number formula_4 defined by the formula
:formula_5
The same formula is also used for the Euler characteristic of other kinds of topological surfaces. It is an invariant of the surface, meaning that when a single surface is subdivided into vertices, edges, and faces in more than one way, the Euler characteristic will be the same for these subdivisions. For a convex polyhedron, or more generally any simply connected polyhedron with the surface of a topological sphere, it always equals 2. For more complicated shapes, the Euler characteristic relates to the number of toroidal holes, handles or cross-caps in the surface and will be less than 2.
All polyhedra with odd-numbered Euler characteristics are non-orientable. A given figure with even Euler characteristic may or may not be orientable. For example, the one-holed toroid and the Klein bottle both have formula_6, with the first being orientable and the other not.

For many (but not all) ways of defining polyhedra, the surface of the polyhedron is required to be a manifold. This means that every edge is part of the boundary of exactly two faces (disallowing shapes like the union of two cubes that meet only along a shared edge) and that every vertex is incident to a single alternating cycle of edges and faces (disallowing shapes like the union of two cubes sharing only a single vertex). For polyhedra defined in these ways, the classification of manifolds implies that the topological type of the surface is completely determined by the combination of its Euler characteristic and orientability. For example, every polyhedron whose surface is an orientable manifold and whose Euler characteristic is 2 must be a topological sphere.

A toroidal polyhedron is a polyhedron whose Euler characteristic is less than or equal to 0, or equivalently whose genus is 1 or greater. Topologically, the surfaces of such polyhedra are torus surfaces having one or more holes through the middle. One of the notable example is the Szilassi polyhedron, which has the geometrically ralizes the Heawood map.

===Duality===

For every convex polyhedron, there exists a dual polyhedron having
* faces in place of the original&#x27;s vertices and vice versa, and
* the same number of edges.
The dual of a convex polyhedron can be obtained by the process of polar reciprocation. Dual polyhedra exist in pairs, and the dual of a dual is just the original polyhedron again. Some polyhedra are self-dual, meaning that the dual of the polyhedron is congruent to the original polyhedron.

Abstract polyhedra also have duals, obtained by reversing the partial order defining the polyhedron to obtain its dual or opposite order. These have the same Euler characteristic and orientability as the initial polyhedron. However, this form of duality does not describe the shape of a dual polyhedron, but only its combinatorial structure. For some definitions of non-convex geometric polyhedra, there exist polyhedra whose abstract duals cannot be realized as geometric polyhedra under the same definition.

===Vertex figures===

For every vertex one can define a vertex figure, which describes the local structure of the polyhedron around the vertex. Precise definitions vary, but a vertex figure can be thought of as the polygon exposed where a slice through the polyhedron cuts off a vertex. For the Platonic solids and other highly-symmetric polyhedra, this slice may be chosen to pass through the midpoints of each edge incident to the vertex, but other polyhedra may not have a plane through these points. For convex polyhedra, and more generally for polyhedra whose vertices are in convex position, this slice can be chosen as any plane separating the vertex from the other vertices. When the polyhedron has a center of symmetry, it is standard to choose this plane to be perpendicular to the line through the given vertex and the center; with this choice, the shape of the vertex figure is determined up to scaling. When the vertices of a polyhedron are not in convex position, there will not always be a plane separating each vertex from the rest. In this case, it is common instead to slice the polyhedron by a small sphere centered at the vertex. Again, this produces a shape for the vertex figure that is invariant up to scaling. All of these choices lead to vertex figures with the same combinatorial structure, for the polyhedra to which they can be applied, but they may give them different geometric shapes.

===Surface area and lines inside polyhedra ===
The surface area of a polyhedron is the sum of the areas of its faces, for definitions of polyhedra for which the area of a face is well-defined.
The geodesic distance between any two points on the surface of a polyhedron measures the length of the shortest curve that connects the two points, remaining within the surface. By Alexandrov&#x27;s uniqueness theorem, every convex polyhedron is uniquely determined by the metric space of geodesic distances on its surface. However, non-convex polyhedra can have the same surface distances as each other, or the same as certain convex polyhedra.

When segment lines connect two vertices that are not in the same face, they form the diagonal lines. However, not all polyhedra have diagonal lines, as in the family of pyramids, Schönhardt polyhedron in which three diagonal lines lies entirely outside of it, and Császár polyhedron has no diagonal lines (rather, every pair of vertices is connected by an edge).

===Volume===
Polyhedral solids have an associated quantity called volume that measures how much space they occupy. Simple families of solids may have simple formulas for their volumes; for example, the volumes of pyramids, prisms, and parallelepipeds can easily be expressed in terms of their edge lengths or other coordinates. (See Volume § Volume formulas for a list that includes many of these formulas.)

Volumes of more complicated polyhedra may not have simple formulas. The volumes of such polyhedra may be computed by subdividing the polyhedron into smaller pieces (for example, by triangulation). For example, the volume of a Platonic solid can be computed by dividing it into congruent pyramids, with each pyramid having a face of the polyhedron as its base and the centre of the polyhedron as its apex.

In general, it can be derived from the divergence theorem that the volume of a polyhedral solid is given by
formula_7
where the sum is over faces formula_8 of the polyhedron, formula_9 is an arbitrary point on face formula_8, formula_11 is the unit vector perpendicular to formula_8 pointing outside the solid, and the multiplication dot is the dot product. In higher dimensions, volume computation may be challenging, in part because of the difficulty of listing the faces of a convex polyhedron specified only by its vertices, and there exist specialized algorithms to determine the volume in these cases.

===Dehn invariant===

In two dimensions, the Bolyai–Gerwien theorem asserts that any polygon may be transformed into any other polygon of the same area by cutting it up into finitely many polygonal pieces and rearranging them. The analogous question for polyhedra was the subject of Hilbert&#x27;s third problem. Max Dehn solved this problem by showing that, unlike in the 2-D case, there exist polyhedra of the same volume that cannot be cut into smaller polyhedra and reassembled into each other. To prove this Dehn discovered another value associated with a polyhedron, the Dehn invariant, such that two polyhedra can only be dissected into each other when they have the same volume and the same Dehn invariant. It was later proven by Sydler that this is the only obstacle to dissection: every two Euclidean polyhedra with the same volumes and Dehn invariants can be cut up and reassembled into each other. The Dehn invariant is not a number, but a vector in an infinite-dimensional vector space, determined from the lengths and dihedral angles of a polyhedron&#x27;s edges.

Another of Hilbert&#x27;s problems, Hilbert&#x27;s eighteenth problem, concerns (among other things) polyhedra that tile space. Every such polyhedron must have Dehn invariant zero. The Dehn invariant has also been connected to flexible polyhedra by the strong bellows theorem, which states that the Dehn invariant of any flexible polyhedron remains invariant as it flexes.

== Symmetries ==

Many of the most studied polyhedra are highly symmetrical. Their appearance is unchanged by some reflection by plane or rotation around the axes passing through two opposite vertices, edges, or faces in space. Each symmetry may change the location of a given element, but the set of all vertices (likewise faces and edges) is unchanged. The collection of symmetries of a polyhedron is called its symmetry group.

=== By elements of polyhedron ===
All the elements (vertex, face, and edge) that can be superimposed on each other by symmetries are said to form a symmetry orbit. If these elements lie in the same orbit, the figure may be transitive on the orbit. Individually, they are isohedral (or face-transitive, meaning the symmetry transformations involve the polyhedra&#x27;s faces in orbit), isotoxal (or edge-transitive, which involves the edge&#x27;s polyhedra), and isogonal (or vertex-transitive, which involves the polyhedra&#x27;s vertices). For example, the cube in which all the faces are in one orbit and involving the rotation and reflections in the orbit remains unchanged in its appearance; hence, the cube is face-transitive. The cube also has the other two such symmetries.
When three such symmetries belong to a polyhedron, it is known as regular polyhedron. There are nine regular polyhedra: five Platonic solids (cube, octahedron, icosahedron, tetrahedron, and dodecahedron—all of which have regular polygonal faces) and four Kepler–Poinsot polyhedrons. Nevertheless, some polyhedrons may not possess one or two of those symmetries:
* A polyhedron with vertex-transitive and edge-transitive is said to be quasiregular, although they have regular faces, and its dual is face-transitive and edge-transitive.
* A vertex- but not edge-transitive polyhedron with regular polygonal faces is said to be semiregular. and such polyhedrons are the prisms and antiprisms. Its dual is face-transitive but not vertex-transitive, and every vertex is regular.
* A polyhedron with regular polygonal faces and vertex-transitive is said to be uniform. This class may be subdivided into a regular, quasi-regular, or semi-regular polyhedron, and may be convex or starry. The dual is face-transitive and has regular vertices but is not necessarily vertex-transitive. The uniform polyhedra and their duals are traditionally classified according to their degree of symmetry, and whether they are convex or not.
* A face- and vertex-transitive (but not necessarily edge-transitive) polyhedra is said to be noble. The regular polyhedra are also noble; they are the only noble uniform polyhedra. The duals of noble polyhedra are themselves noble.

Some polyhedra may have no reflection symmetry such that they have two enantiomorph forms, which are reflections of each other. Such symmetry is known for having chirality. Examples include the snub cuboctahedron and snub icosidodecahedron.

=== By point group in three dimensions ===

The point group of polyhedra means a mathematical group endowed with its symmetry operations so that the appearance of polyhedra remains preserved while transforming in three-dimensional space. The indicated transformation here includes the rotation around the axes, reflection through the plane, inversion through a center point, and a combination of these three.
The polyhedral group is the symmetry group originally derived from the three Platonic solids: tetrahedron, octahedron, and icosahedron. These three have point groups respectively known as tetrahedral symmetry, octahedral symmetry, and icosahedral symmetry. Each of these focuses on the rotation group of polyhedra, known as the &quot;chiral polyhedral group&quot;, whereas the additional reflection symmetry is known as the &quot;full polyhedral group&quot;. One point group, pyritohedral symmetry, includes the rotation of tetrahedral symmetry and additionally has three planes of reflection symmetry and some rotoreflections. Overall, the mentioned polyhedral groups are summarized in the following bullets:
* chiral tetrahedral symmetry formula_13, the rotation group for a regular tetrahedron and has the order of twelve.
* full tetrahedral symmetry formula_14, the symmetry group for a regular tetrahedron and has the order of twenty-four.
* pyritohedral symmetry formula_15, the symmetry of a pyritohedron and has the order of twenty-four.
* chiral octahedral symmetry formula_16, the rotation group of both cube and regular octahedron and has the order twenty-four.
* full octahedral symmetry formula_17, the symmetry group of both cube and regular octahedron and has order forty-eight.
* chiral icosahedral symmetry formula_18, the rotation group of both regular icosahedron and regular dodecahedron and has the order of sixty.
* full icosahedral symmetry formula_19, the symmetry group of both regular icosahedron and regular dodecahedron and has the order of a hundred-twenty.
Point groups in three dimensions may also allow the preservation of polyhedra&#x27;s appearance by the circulation around an axis. There are three various of these point groups:
* pyramidal symmetry formula_20, allowing rotate the axis passing through the apex and its base, as well as reflection relative to perpendicular planes passing through the bisector of a base. This point group symmetry can be found in pyramids, cupolas, and rotundas.
* prismatic symmetry formula_21, similar to the pyramidal symmetry, but with additional transformation by reflecting it across a horizontal plane. This may be achieved from the family of prisms and its dual bipyramids.
* antiprismatic symmetry formula_22, which preserves the symmetry by rotating its half bottom and reflection across the horizontal plane. Examples can be found in antiprisms.
A point group formula_23 consists of rotating around the axis of symmetry and reflection on the horizontal plane. In the case of formula_24, the symmetry group only preserves the symmetry by a full rotation solely, ordinarily denoting formula_25. Polyhedra may have rotation only to preserve the symmetry, and the symmetry group may be considered as the cyclic group formula_26. Polyhedra with the rotoreflection and the rotation by the cyclic group is the point group formula_27.

== Convex polyhedra ==

As mentioned above, the convex polyhedra are well-defined, with several equivalent standard definitions. They are often defined as bounded intersections of finitely many half-spaces, or as the convex hull of finitely many points, restricted in either case to intersections or hulls that have nonzero volume.

Important classes of convex polyhedra include the family of prismatoids, the Platonic solids, the Archimedean solids and their duals the Catalan solids, and the convex polyhedra whose faces are all regular polygons. The prismatoids are the polyhedra whose vertices lie on two parallel planes and their faces are likely to be trapezoids and triangles. Examples of prismatoids are pyramids, wedges, parallelipipeds, prisms, antiprisms, cupolas, and frustums. The Platonic solids are the five ancientness polyhedra—tetrahedron, octahedron, icosahedron, cube, and dodecahedron—classified by Plato in his &quot;Timaeus&quot; whose connecting four classical elements of nature. The Archimedean solids are the class of thirteen polyhedra whose faces are all regular polygons and whose vertices are symmetric to each other; their dual polyhedra are Catalan solids. The class of regular polygonal faces polyhedron are the deltahedron (whose faces are all equilateral triangles and Johnson solids (whose faces are arbitrary regular polygons).

Convex polyhedra can be categorized into elementary polyhedra or composite polyhedra. Elementary polyhedra are convex regular-faced polyhedra that cannot be produced into two or more polyhedrons by slicing them with a plane. Quite opposite to composite polyhedra, they can be alternatively defined as polyhedra constructed by attaching more elementary polyhedra. For example, triaugmented triangular prism is composite since it can be constructed by attaching three equilateral square pyramids onto the square faces of a triangular prism; the square pyramids and the triangular prism are elementaries.
The midsphere is a sphere tangent to every edge of a convex polyhedron, an intermediate sphere in radius between the insphere and circumsphere, for polyhedra for which all three of these spheres exist. Every convex polyhedron is combinatorially equivalent to a &quot;canonical polyhedron&quot;, a polyhedron that has a midsphere whose center coincides with its centroid. The shape of the canonical polyhedron (but not its scale or position) is uniquely determined by the combinatorial structure of the given polyhedron.

By forgetting the face structure, any polyhedron gives rise to a graph, called its skeleton, with corresponding vertices and edges. Such figures have a long history: Leonardo da Vinci devised frame models of the regular solids, which he drew for Pacioli&#x27;s book &quot;Divina Proportione&quot;, and similar wire-frame polyhedra appear in M.C. Escher&#x27;s print &quot;Stars&quot;. One highlight of this approach is Steinitz&#x27;s theorem, which gives a purely graph-theoretic characterization of the skeletons of convex polyhedra: it states that the skeleton of every convex polyhedron is a planar graph with three-connected, and every such graph is the skeleton of some convex polyhedron.

Some polyhedra do not have the property of convexity, and they are called &quot;non-convex polyhedra&quot;. They are star polyhedra and Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra constructed by either stellation or faceting. Stellation is the process of extending the faces (within their planes) so that they meet. The notable is the stellation of icosahedra consisted of fifty-nine in the works of &quot;The Fifty-Nine Icosahedra&quot;. Faceting is the process of removing parts of a polyhedron to create new faces (or facets) without creating any new vertices). A facet of a polyhedron is any polygon whose corners are vertices of the polyhedron, and is not a &quot;face&quot;. The stellation and faceting are inverse or reciprocal processes: the dual of some stellation is a faceting of the dual to the original polyhedron.

== Other families of polyhedra ==
===Space-filling polyhedra===

A space-filling polyhedron packs with copies of itself to fill space. Such a close-packing or space-filling is often called a tessellation of space or a honeycomb. Space-filling polyhedra must have a Dehn invariant equal to zero. Some honeycombs involve more than one kind of polyhedron.

=== Flexible polyhedra ===

It is possible for some polyhedra to change their overall shape, while keeping the shapes of their faces the same, by varying the angles of their edges. A polyhedron that can do this is called a flexible polyhedron. By Cauchy&#x27;s rigidity theorem, flexible polyhedra must be non-convex. The volume of a flexible polyhedron must remain constant as it flexes; this result is known as the bellows theorem.

=== Ideal polyhedron ===
Convex polyhedra can be defined in three-dimensional hyperbolic space in the same way as in Euclidean space, as the convex hulls of finite sets of points. However, in hyperbolic space, it is also possible to consider ideal points and the points within the space. An ideal polyhedron is the convex hull of a finite set of ideal points. Its faces are ideal polygons, but its edges are defined by entire hyperbolic lines rather than line segments, and its vertices (the ideal points of which it is the convex hull) do not lie within the hyperbolic space.

=== Lattice polyhedron ===
Convex polyhedra in which all vertices have integer coordinates are called lattice polyhedra or integral polyhedra. The Ehrhart polynomial of lattice a polyhedron counts how many points with integer coordinates lie within a scaled copy of the polyhedron, as a function of the scale factor. The study of these polynomials lies at the intersection of combinatorics and commutative algebra. An example is Reeve tetrahedron.

There is a far-reaching equivalence between lattice polyhedra and certain algebraic varieties called toric varieties. This was used by Stanley to prove the Dehn–Sommerville equations for simplicial polytopes.

=== Polyhedral compound ===
A polyhedral compound is made of two or more polyhedra sharing a common centre. Symmetrical compounds often share the same vertices as other well-known polyhedra and may often also be formed by stellation. Some are listed in the list of Wenninger polyhedron models.

=== Zonohedron ===
A zonohedron is a convex polyhedron in which every face is a polygon that is symmetric under rotations through 180°. Zonohedra can also be characterized as the Minkowski sums of line segments, and include several important space-filling polyhedra.

=== Orthogonal polyhedron ===
Polyhedra are said to be orthogonal because all of their edges are parallel to the axes of a Cartesian coordinate system. This implies that all faces meet at right angles, but this condition is weaker: Jessen&#x27;s icosahedron has faces meeting at right angles, but does not have axis-parallel edges. Aside from the rectangular cuboids, orthogonal polyhedra are nonconvex. They are the three-dimensional analogs of two-dimensional orthogonal polygons, also known as rectilinear polygons. Orthogonal polyhedra are used in computational geometry, where their constrained structure has enabled advances in problems unsolved for arbitrary polyhedra, for example, unfolding the surface of a polyhedron to a polygonal net. Polycubes are a special case of orthogonal polyhedra that can be decomposed into identical cubes, and are three-dimensional analogues of planar polyominoes.

==Generalisations==
The name &#x27;polyhedron&#x27; has come to be used for a variety of objects having similar structural properties to traditional polyhedra.

===Apeirohedra===
A classical polyhedral surface has a finite number of faces, joined in pairs along edges. The apeirohedra form a related class of objects with infinitely many faces. Examples of apeirohedra include:
* tilings or tessellations of the plane, and
* sponge-like structures called infinite skew polyhedra.

===Complex polyhedra===

There are objects called complex polyhedra, for which the underlying space is a complex Hilbert space rather than real Euclidean space. Precise definitions exist only for the regular complex polyhedra, whose symmetry groups are complex reflection groups. The complex polyhedra are mathematically more closely related to configurations than to real polyhedra.

=== Curved polyhedra ===
Some fields of study allow polyhedra to have curved faces and edges. Curved faces can allow digonal faces to exist with a positive area.
* When the surface of a sphere is divided by finitely many great arcs (equivalently, by planes passing through the center of the sphere), the result is called a spherical polyhedron. Many convex polytopes having some degree of symmetry (for example, all the Platonic solids) can be projected onto the surface of a concentric sphere to produce a spherical polyhedron. However, the reverse process is not always possible; some spherical polyhedra (such as the hosohedra) have no flat-faced analogue.
* If faces are allowed to be concave as well as convex, adjacent faces may be made to meet together with no gap. Some of these curved polyhedra can pack together to fill space. Two important types are bubbles in froths and foams such as Weaire-Phelan bubbles, and forms used in architecture.
== Higher-dimensional polyhedra ==

From the latter half of the twentieth century, various mathematical constructs have been found to have properties also present in traditional polyhedra. Rather than confining the term &quot;polyhedron&quot; to describe a three-dimensional polytope, it has been adopted to describe various related but distinct kinds of structure.

A polyhedron has been defined as a set of points in real affine (or Euclidean) space of any dimension &quot;n&quot; that has flat sides. It may alternatively be defined as the intersection of finitely many half-spaces. Unlike a conventional polyhedron, it may be bounded or unbounded. In this meaning, a polytope is a bounded polyhedron.

Analytically, such a convex polyhedron is expressed as the solution set for a system of linear inequalities. Defining polyhedra in this way provides a geometric perspective for problems in linear programming.

==History==
===Before the Greeks===

Polyhedra appeared in early architectural forms such as cubes and cuboids, with the earliest four-sided Egyptian pyramids dating from the 27th century BC. The Moscow Mathematical Papyrus from approximately 1800–1650 BC includes an early written study of polyhedra and their volumes (specifically, the volume of a frustum). The mathematics of the Old Babylonian Empire, from roughly the same time period as the Moscow Papyrus, also included calculations of the volumes of cuboids (and of non-polyhedral cylinders), and calculations of the height of such a shape needed to attain a given volume.

The Etruscans preceded the Greeks in their awareness of at least some of the regular polyhedra, as evidenced by the discovery of an Etruscan dodecahedron made of soapstone on Monte Loffa. Its faces were marked with different designs, suggesting to some scholars that it may have been used as a gaming die.

===Ancient Greece===

Ancient Greek mathematicians discovered and studied the convex regular polyhedra, which came to be known as the Platonic solids. Their first written description is in the &quot;Timaeus&quot; of Plato (circa 360 BC), which associates four of them with the four elements and the fifth to the overall shape of the universe. A more mathematical treatment of these five polyhedra was written soon after in the &quot;Elements&quot; of Euclid. An early commentator on Euclid (possibly Geminus) writes that the attribution of these shapes to Plato is incorrect: Pythagoras knew the tetrahedron, cube, and dodecahedron, and Theaetetus (circa 417 BC) discovered the other two, the octahedron and icosahedron. Later, Archimedes expanded his study to the convex uniform polyhedra which now bear his name. His original work is lost and his solids come down to us through Pappus.

===Ancient China===

Both cubical dice and 14-sided dice in the shape of a truncated octahedron in China have been dated back as early as the Warring States period.

By 236 AD, Liu Hui was describing the dissection of the cube into its characteristic tetrahedron (orthoscheme) and related solids, using assemblages of these solids as the basis for calculating volumes of earth to be moved during engineering excavations.

===Medieval Islam===
After the end of the Classical era, scholars in the Islamic civilisation continued to take the Greek knowledge forward (see Mathematics in medieval Islam). The 9th century scholar Thabit ibn Qurra included the calculation of volumes in his studies, and wrote a work on the cuboctahedron. Then in the 10th century Abu&#x27;l Wafa described the convex regular and quasiregular spherical polyhedra.

===Renaissance===

As with other areas of Greek thought maintained and enhanced by Islamic scholars, Western interest in polyhedra revived during the Italian Renaissance. Artists constructed skeletal polyhedra, depicting them from life as a part of their investigations into perspective. Toroidal polyhedra, made of wood and used to support headgear, became a common exercise in perspective drawing, and were depicted in marquetry panels of the period as a symbol of geometry. Piero della Francesca wrote about constructing perspective views of polyhedra, and rediscovered many of the Archimedean solids. Leonardo da Vinci illustrated skeletal models of several polyhedra for a book by Luca Pacioli, with text largely plagiarized from della Francesca. Polyhedral nets make an appearance in the work of Albrecht Dürer.

Several works from this time investigate star polyhedra, and other elaborations of the basic Platonic forms. A marble tarsia in the floor of St. Mark&#x27;s Basilica, Venice, designed by Paolo Uccello, depicts a stellated dodecahedron. As the Renaissance spread beyond Italy, later artists such as Wenzel Jamnitzer, Dürer and others also depicted polyhedra of increasing complexity, many of them novel, in imaginative etchings. Johannes Kepler (1571–1630) used star polygons, typically pentagrams, to build star polyhedra. Some of these figures may have been discovered before Kepler&#x27;s time, but he was the first to recognize that they could be considered &quot;regular&quot; if one removed the restriction that regular polyhedra must be convex.

In the same period, Euler&#x27;s polyhedral formula, a linear equation relating the numbers of vertices, edges, and faces of a polyhedron, was stated for the Platonic solids in 1537 in an unpublished manuscript by Francesco Maurolico.

===17th–19th centuries===
René Descartes, in around 1630, wrote his book &quot;De solidorum elementis&quot; studying convex polyhedra as a general concept, not limited to the Platonic solids and their elaborations. The work was lost, and not rediscovered until the 19th century. One of its contributions was Descartes&#x27; theorem on total angular defect, which is closely related to Euler&#x27;s polyhedral formula. Leonhard Euler, for whom the formula is named, introduced it in 1758 for convex polyhedra more generally, albeit with an incorrect proof. Euler&#x27;s work (together with his earlier solution to the puzzle of the Seven Bridges of Königsberg) became the foundation of the new field of topology. The core concepts of this field, including generalizations of the polyhedral formula, were developed in the late nineteenth century by Henri Poincaré, Enrico Betti, Bernhard Riemann, and others.

In the early 19th century, Louis Poinsot extended Kepler&#x27;s work, and discovered the remaining two regular star polyhedra. Soon after, Augustin-Louis Cauchy proved Poinsot&#x27;s list complete, subject to an unstated assumption that the sequence of vertices and edges of each polygonal side cannot admit repetitions (an assumption that had been considered but rejected in the earlier work of A. F. L. Meister). They became known as the Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra, and their usual names were given by Arthur Cayley. Meanwhile, the discovery of higher dimensions in the early 19th century led Ludwig Schläfli by 1853 to the idea of higher-dimensional polytopes. Additionally, in the late 19th century, Russian crystallographer Evgraf Fedorov completed the classification of parallelohedra, convex polyhedra that tile space by translations.

===20th–21st centuries===
Mathematics in the 20th century dawned with Hilbert&#x27;s problems, one of which, Hilbert&#x27;s third problem, concerned polyhedra and their dissections. It was quickly solved by Hilbert&#x27;s student Max Dehn, introducing the Dehn invariant of polyhedra. Steinitz&#x27;s theorem, published by Ernst Steinitz in 1992, characterized the graphs of convex polyhedra, bringing modern ideas from graph theory and combinatorics into the study of polyhedra.

The Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra may be constructed from the Platonic solids by a process called stellation. Most stellations are not regular. The study of stellations of the Platonic solids was given a big push by H.S.M. Coxeter and others in 1938, with the now famous paper &quot;The Fifty-Nine Icosahedra&quot;. Coxeter&#x27;s analysis signaled a rebirth of interest in geometry. Coxeter himself went on to enumerate the star uniform polyhedra for the first time, to treat tilings of the plane as polyhedra, to discover the regular skew polyhedra and to develop the theory of complex polyhedra first discovered by Shephard in 1952, as well as making fundamental contributions to many other areas of geometry.

In the second part of the twentieth century, both Branko Grünbaum and Imre Lakatos pointed out the tendency among mathematicians to define a &quot;polyhedron&quot; in different and sometimes incompatible ways to suit the needs of the moment. In a series of papers, Grünbaum broadened the accepted definition of a polyhedron, discovering many new regular polyhedra. At the close of the twentieth century, these latter ideas merged with other work on incidence complexes to create the modern idea of an abstract polyhedron (as an abstract 3-polytope), notably presented by McMullen and Schulte.
Polyhedra have been discovered in many fields of science. The Platonic solids appeared in biological creatures, as in The &quot;Braarudosphaera bigelowii&quot; has a regular dodecahedral structure. Ernst Haeckel described a number of species of radiolarians, some of whose shells are shaped like various regular polyhedra. The outer protein shells of many viruses form regular polyhedra. For example, HIV is enclosed in a regular icosahedron, as is the head of a typical myovirus. The regular icosahedron may also appeared in the applications of cartography when R. Buckminster Fuller used its net to his project known as Dymaxion map, frustatedly realized that the Greenland size is smaller than the South America.

Polyhedra make a frequent appearance in modern computational geometry, computer graphics, and geometric design with topics including the reconstruction of polyhedral surfaces or surface meshes from scattered data points, geodesics on polyhedral surfaces, visibility and illumination in polyhedral scenes, polycubes and other non-convex polyhedra with axis-parallel sides, algorithmic forms of Steinitz&#x27;s theorem, and the still-unsolved problem of the existence of polyhedral nets for convex polyhedra.

<text>In elementary geometry, a polytope is a geometric object with flat sides (&quot;faces&quot;). Polytopes are the generalization of three-dimensional polyhedra to any number of dimensions. Polytopes may exist in any general number of dimensions as an -dimensional polytope or -polytope. For example, a two-dimensional polygon is a 2-polytope and a three-dimensional polyhedron is a 3-polytope. In this context, &quot;flat sides&quot; means that the sides of a -polytope consist of -polytopes that may have -polytopes in common.

Some theories further generalize the idea to include such objects as unbounded apeirotopes and tessellations, decompositions or tilings of curved manifolds including spherical polyhedra, and set-theoretic abstract polytopes.

Polytopes of more than three dimensions were first discovered by Ludwig Schläfli before 1853, who called such a figure a polyschem. The German term &quot;polytop&quot; was coined by the mathematician Reinhold Hoppe, and was introduced to English mathematicians as &quot;polytope&quot; by Alicia Boole Stott.

==Approaches to definition==
Nowadays, the term &quot;polytope&quot; is a broad term that covers a wide class of objects, and various definitions appear in the mathematical literature. Many of these definitions are not equivalent to each other, resulting in different overlapping sets of objects being called &quot;polytopes&quot;. They represent different approaches to generalizing the convex polytopes to include other objects with similar properties.

The original approach broadly followed by Ludwig Schläfli, Thorold Gosset and others begins with the extension by analogy into four or more dimensions, of the idea of a polygon and polyhedron respectively in two and three dimensions.

Attempts to generalise the Euler characteristic of polyhedra to higher-dimensional polytopes led to the development of topology and the treatment of a decomposition or CW-complex as analogous to a polytope. In this approach, a polytope may be regarded as a tessellation or decomposition of some given manifold. An example of this approach defines a polytope as a set of points that admits a simplicial decomposition. In this definition, a polytope is the union of finitely many simplices, with the additional property that, for any two simplices that have a nonempty intersection, their intersection is a vertex, edge, or higher dimensional face of the two. However this definition does not allow star polytopes with interior structures, and so is restricted to certain areas of mathematics.

The discovery of star polyhedra and other unusual constructions led to the idea of a polyhedron as a bounding surface, ignoring its interior. In this light convex polytopes in &quot;p&quot;-space are equivalent to tilings of the (&quot;p&quot;−1)-sphere, while others may be tilings of other elliptic, flat or toroidal (&quot;p&quot;−1)-surfaces – see elliptic tiling and toroidal polyhedron. A polyhedron is understood as a surface whose faces are polygons, a 4-polytope as a hypersurface whose facets (cells) are polyhedra, and so forth.

The idea of constructing a higher polytope from those of lower dimension is also sometimes extended downwards in dimension, with an (edge) seen as a 1-polytope bounded by a point pair, and a point or vertex as a 0-polytope. This approach is used for example in the theory of abstract polytopes.

In certain fields of mathematics, the terms &quot;polytope&quot; and &quot;polyhedron&quot; are used in a different sense: a &quot;polyhedron&quot; is the generic object in any dimension (referred to as &quot;polytope&quot; in this article) and &quot;polytope&quot; means a bounded polyhedron. This terminology is typically confined to polytopes and polyhedra that are convex. With this terminology, a convex polyhedron is the intersection of a finite number of halfspaces and is defined by its sides while a convex polytope is the convex hull of a finite number of points and is defined by its vertices.

Polytopes in lower numbers of dimensions have standard names:
==Elements==
A polytope comprises elements of different dimensionality such as vertices, edges, faces, cells and so on. Terminology for these is not fully consistent across different authors. For example, some authors use &quot;face&quot; to refer to an (&quot;n&quot; − 1)-dimensional element while others use &quot;face&quot; to denote a 2-face specifically. Authors may use &quot;j&quot;-face or &quot;j&quot;-facet to indicate an element of &quot;j&quot; dimensions. Some use &quot;edge&quot; to refer to a ridge, while H. S. M. Coxeter uses &quot;cell&quot; to denote an (&quot;n&quot; − 1)-dimensional element. 

The terms adopted in this article are given in the table below:

An &quot;n&quot;-dimensional polytope is bounded by a number of (&quot;n&quot; − 1)-dimensional &quot;facets&quot;. These facets are themselves polytopes, whose facets are (&quot;n&quot; − 2)-dimensional &quot;ridges&quot; of the original polytope. Every ridge arises as the intersection of two facets (but the intersection of two facets need not be a ridge). Ridges are once again polytopes whose facets give rise to (&quot;n&quot; − 3)-dimensional boundaries of the original polytope, and so on. These bounding sub-polytopes may be referred to as faces, or specifically &quot;j&quot;-dimensional faces or &quot;j&quot;-faces. A 0-dimensional face is called a &quot;vertex&quot;, and consists of a single point. A 1-dimensional face is called an &quot;edge&quot;, and consists of a line segment. A 2-dimensional face consists of a polygon, and a 3-dimensional face, sometimes called a &quot;cell&quot;, consists of a polyhedron.

==Important classes of polytopes==

===Convex polytopes===

A polytope may be &quot;convex&quot;. The convex polytopes are the simplest kind of polytopes, and form the basis for several different generalizations of the concept of polytopes. A convex polytope is sometimes defined as the intersection of a set of half-spaces. This definition allows a polytope to be neither bounded nor finite. Polytopes are defined in this way, e.g., in linear programming. A polytope is &quot;bounded&quot; if there is a ball of finite radius that contains it. A polytope is said to be &quot;pointed&quot; if it contains at least one vertex. Every bounded nonempty polytope is pointed. An example of a non-pointed polytope is the set formula_1. A polytope is &quot;finite&quot; if it is defined in terms of a finite number of objects, e.g., as an intersection of a finite number of half-planes.
It is an integral polytope if all of its vertices have integer coordinates.

A certain class of convex polytopes are &quot;reflexive&quot; polytopes. An integral formula_2 is reflexive if for some integral matrix formula_3, formula_4, where formula_5 denotes a vector of all ones, and the inequality is component-wise. It follows from this definition that formula_2 is reflexive if and only if formula_7 for all formula_8. In other words, a of formula_2 differs, in terms of integer lattice points, from a of formula_2 only by lattice points gained on the boundary. Equivalently, formula_2 is reflexive if and only if its dual polytope formula_12 is an integral polytope.

===Regular polytopes===

Regular polytopes have the highest degree of symmetry of all polytopes. The symmetry group of a regular polytope acts transitively on its flags; hence, the dual polytope of a regular polytope is also regular.

There are three main classes of regular polytope which occur in any number of dimensions:
*Simplices, including the equilateral triangle and the regular tetrahedron.
*Hypercubes or measure polytopes, including the square and the cube.
*Orthoplexes or cross polytopes, including the square and regular octahedron.

Dimensions two, three and four include regular figures which have fivefold symmetries and some of which are non-convex stars, and in two dimensions there are infinitely many regular polygons of &quot;n&quot;-fold symmetry, both convex and (for &quot;n&quot; ≥ 5) star. But in higher dimensions there are no other regular polytopes.

In three dimensions the convex Platonic solids include the fivefold-symmetric dodecahedron and icosahedron, and there are also four star Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra with fivefold symmetry, bringing the total to nine regular polyhedra.

In four dimensions the regular 4-polytopes include one additional convex solid with fourfold symmetry and two with fivefold symmetry. There are ten star Schläfli-Hess 4-polytopes, all with fivefold symmetry, giving in all sixteen regular 4-polytopes.

===Star polytopes===

A non-convex polytope may be self-intersecting; this class of polytopes include the star polytopes. Some regular polytopes are stars.

== Properties ==

=== Euler characteristic ===
Since a (filled) convex polytope &quot;P&quot; in formula_13 dimensions is contractible to a point, the Euler characteristic formula_14 of its boundary ∂P is given by the alternating sum:
:formula_15, where formula_16 is the number of formula_17-dimensional faces.

This generalizes Euler&#x27;s formula for polyhedra.

=== Internal angles ===
The Gram–Euler theorem similarly generalizes the alternating sum of internal angles formula_18 for convex polyhedra to higher-dimensional polytopes:

: formula_19

==Generalisations of a polytope==

===Infinite polytopes===

Not all manifolds are finite. Where a polytope is understood as a tiling or decomposition of a manifold, this idea may be extended to infinite manifolds. plane tilings, space-filling (honeycombs) and hyperbolic tilings are in this sense polytopes, and are sometimes called apeirotopes because they have infinitely many cells.

Among these, there are regular forms including the regular skew polyhedra and the infinite series of tilings represented by the regular apeirogon, square tiling, cubic honeycomb, and so on.

===Abstract polytopes===
The theory of abstract polytopes attempts to detach polytopes from the space containing them, considering their purely combinatorial properties. This allows the definition of the term to be extended to include objects for which it is difficult to define an intuitive underlying space, such as the 11-cell.

An abstract polytope is a partially ordered set of elements or members, which obeys certain rules. It is a purely algebraic structure, and the theory was developed in order to avoid some of the issues which make it difficult to reconcile the various geometric classes within a consistent mathematical framework. A geometric polytope is said to be a realization in some real space of the associated abstract polytope.

===Complex polytopes===
Structures analogous to polytopes exist in complex Hilbert spaces formula_20 where &quot;n&quot; real dimensions are accompanied by &quot;n&quot; imaginary ones. Regular complex polytopes are more appropriately treated as configurations.

==Duality==
Every &quot;n&quot;-polytope has a dual structure, obtained by interchanging its vertices for facets, edges for ridges, and so on generally interchanging its (&quot;j&quot; − 1)-dimensional elements for (&quot;n&quot; − &quot;j&quot;)-dimensional elements (for &quot;j&quot; = 1 to &quot;n&quot; − 1), while retaining the connectivity or incidence between elements.

For an abstract polytope, this simply reverses the ordering of the set. This reversal is seen in the Schläfli symbols for regular polytopes, where the symbol for the dual polytope is simply the reverse of the original. For example, {4, 3, 3} is dual to {3, 3, 4}.

In the case of a geometric polytope, some geometric rule for dualising is necessary, see for example the rules described for dual polyhedra. Depending on circumstance, the dual figure may or may not be another geometric polytope.

If the dual is reversed, then the original polytope is recovered. Thus, polytopes exist in dual pairs.

===Self-dual polytopes===

If a polytope has the same number of vertices as facets, of edges as ridges, and so forth, and the same connectivities, then the dual figure will be similar to the original and the polytope is self-dual.

Some common self-dual polytopes include:
*Every regular &quot;n&quot;-simplex, in any number of dimensions, with Schläfli symbol {3&quot;n&quot;}. These include the equilateral triangle {3}, regular tetrahedron {3,3}, and 5-cell {3,3,3}.
*Every hypercubic honeycomb, in any number of dimensions. These include the apeirogon {∞}, square tiling {4,4} and cubic honeycomb {4,3,4}.
*Numerous compact, paracompact and noncompact hyperbolic tilings, such as the icosahedral honeycomb {3,5,3}, and order-5 pentagonal tiling {5,5}.
*In 2 dimensions, all regular polygons (regular 2-polytopes)
*In 3 dimensions, the canonical polygonal pyramids and elongated pyramids, and tetrahedrally diminished dodecahedron.
*In 4 dimensions, the 24-cell, with Schläfli symbol {3,4,3}. Also the great 120-cell {5,5/2,5} and grand stellated 120-cell {5/2,5,5/2}.

==History==
Polygons and polyhedra have been known since ancient times.

An early hint of higher dimensions came in 1827 when August Ferdinand Möbius discovered that two mirror-image solids can be superimposed by rotating one of them through a fourth mathematical dimension. By the 1850s, a handful of other mathematicians such as Arthur Cayley and Hermann Grassmann had also considered higher dimensions.

Ludwig Schläfli was the first to consider analogues of polygons and polyhedra in these higher spaces. He described the six convex regular 4-polytopes in 1852 but his work was not published until 1901, six years after his death. By 1854, Bernhard Riemann&#x27;s &quot;Habilitationsschrift&quot; had firmly established the geometry of higher dimensions, and thus the concept of &quot;n&quot;-dimensional polytopes was made acceptable. Schläfli&#x27;s polytopes were rediscovered many times in the following decades, even during his lifetime.

In 1882 Reinhold Hoppe, writing in German, coined the word &quot;polytop&quot; to refer to this more general concept of polygons and polyhedra. In due course Alicia Boole Stott, daughter of logician George Boole, introduced the anglicised &quot;polytope&quot; into the English language.

In 1895, Thorold Gosset not only rediscovered Schläfli&#x27;s regular polytopes but also investigated the ideas of semiregular polytopes and space-filling tessellations in higher dimensions. Polytopes also began to be studied in non-Euclidean spaces such as hyperbolic space.

An important milestone was reached in 1948 with H. S. M. Coxeter&#x27;s book &quot;Regular Polytopes&quot;, summarizing work to date and adding new findings of his own.

Meanwhile, the French mathematician Henri Poincaré had developed the topological idea of a polytope as the piecewise decomposition (e.g. CW-complex) of a manifold. Branko Grünbaum published his influential work on &quot;Convex Polytopes&quot; in 1967.

In 1952 Geoffrey Colin Shephard generalised the idea as complex polytopes in complex space, where each real dimension has an imaginary one associated with it. Coxeter developed the theory further.

The conceptual issues raised by complex polytopes, non-convexity, duality and other phenomena led Grünbaum and others to the more general study of abstract combinatorial properties relating vertices, edges, faces and so on. A related idea was that of incidence complexes, which studied the incidence or connection of the various elements with one another. These developments led eventually to the theory of abstract polytopes as partially ordered sets, or posets, of such elements. Peter McMullen and Egon Schulte published their book &quot;Abstract Regular Polytopes&quot; in 2002.

Enumerating the uniform polytopes, convex and nonconvex, in four or more dimensions remains an outstanding problem. The convex uniform 4-polytopes were fully enumerated by John Conway and Michael Guy using a computer in 1965; in higher dimensions this problem was still open as of 1997. The full enumeration for nonconvex uniform polytopes is not known in dimensions four and higher as of 2008.

In modern times, polytopes and related concepts have found many important applications in fields as diverse as computer graphics, optimization, search engines, cosmology, quantum mechanics and numerous other fields. In 2013 the amplituhedron was discovered as a simplifying construct in certain calculations of theoretical physics.

==Applications==
In the field of optimization, linear programming studies the maxima and minima of linear functions; these maxima and minima occur on the boundary of an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional polytope. In linear programming, polytopes occur in the use of generalized barycentric coordinates and slack variables.

In twistor theory, a branch of theoretical physics, a polytope called the amplituhedron is used in to calculate the scattering amplitudes of subatomic particles when they collide. The construct is purely theoretical with no known physical manifestation, but is said to greatly simplify certain calculations.

<text>Paper-and-pencil games or paper-and-pen games (or some variation on those terms) are games that can be played solely with paper and pencils (or other writing implements), usually without erasing. They may be played to pass the time, as icebreakers, or for brain training. In recent times, they have been supplanted by mobile games. Some popular examples of pencil-and-paper games include tic-tac-toe, sprouts, dots and boxes, hangman, MASH, paper soccer, and spellbinder. The term is unrelated to the use in role-playing games to differentiate tabletop games from role-playing video games.

Board games where pieces are never moved or removed from the board once being played, particularly abstract strategy games like Gomoku and Connect Four, can also be played as pencil-and-paper games.

<text>Paleomaps are maps of continents and mountain ranges in the past based on plate reconstructions. Until the 1960s, paleomaps were not very satisfactory, since it was difficult to understand many quite distinctive features. For example, huge river deltas seemed to be associated with what must have been rather small drainage basins. With the discovery of plate tectonics, it became apparent that land masses move relative to one another over time. Ancient geologic features started to make far more sense. It is now possible to construct maps that are probably fairly accurate for continental positions over several hundred million years. Before the Cambrian Period, it becomes much more difficult since there are fewer rock exposures preserved. The state of large regions of the Earth becomes unknowable in the distant past. Where rocks are exposed, latitudes can often be determined from the orientation of preserved magnetic fields (see paleomagnetism) but longitudes are based on projections that are increasingly uncertain as one gets further from the present.

Many published maps are associated in one way or another with the work of Christopher Scotese. The maps are useful since it is usually quite difficult to describe the location and orientation of geographical features using words alone.

<doc id="23474" wikidata="Q6092032" url="?curid=23474" title="Problem of universals">
<text>The problem of universals is an ancient question from metaphysics that has inspired a range of philosophical topics and disputes: &quot;Should the properties an object has in common with other objects, such as color and shape, be considered to exist beyond those objects? And if a property exists separately from objects, what is the nature of that existence?&quot;

The problem of universals relates to various inquiries closely related to metaphysics, logic, and epistemology, as far back as Plato and Aristotle, in efforts to define the mental connections a human makes when they understand a property such as shape or color to be the same in nonidentical objects.

Universals are qualities or relations found in two or more entities. As an example, if all cup holders are &quot;circular&quot; in some way, &quot;circularity&quot; may be considered a universal property of cup holders. Further, if two daughters can be considered &quot;female offspring of Frank&quot;, the qualities of being &quot;female&quot;, &quot;offspring&quot;, and &quot;of Frank&quot;, are universal properties of the two daughters. Many properties can be universal: being human, red, male or female, liquid or solid, big or small, etc.

Philosophers agree that human beings can talk and think about universals, but disagree on whether universals exist in reality beyond mere thought and speech.

==Ancient philosophy==
The problem of universals is considered a central issue in traditional metaphysics and can be traced back to Plato and Aristotle&#x27;s philosophy, particularly in their attempt to explain the nature and status of forms. These philosophers explored the problem through predication.

=== Plato ===
Plato believed that there was a sharp distinction between the world of perceivable objects and the world of universals or forms (eidos): one can only have mere opinions about the former, but one can have knowledge about the latter. For Plato, it was not possible to have knowledge of anything that could change or was particular, since knowledge had to be forever unfailing and general. For that reason, the world of the forms is the real world, like sunlight, while the sensible world is only imperfectly or partially real, like shadows. This Platonic realism, however, in denying that the eternal Forms are mental artifacts, differs sharply with modern forms of idealism.

One of the first nominalist critiques of Plato&#x27;s realism was that of Diogenes of Sinope, who said &quot;I&#x27;ve seen Plato&#x27;s cups and table, but not his cupness and tableness.&quot;

=== Aristotle ===

Plato&#x27;s student Aristotle disagreed with his tutor. Aristotle transformed Plato&#x27;s forms into &quot;formal causes&quot;, the blueprints or essences of individual things. Whereas Plato idealized geometry, Aristotle emphasized nature and related disciplines and therefore much of his thinking concerns living beings and their properties. The nature of universals in Aristotle&#x27;s philosophy therefore hinges on his view of natural kinds. Instead of categorizing &quot;being&quot; according to the structure of thought, he proposed that the categorical analysis be directed upon the structure of the natural world. He used the principle of predication in &quot;Categories&quot;, where he established that universal terms are involved in a relation of predication if some facts expressed by ordinary sentences hold.

In his work &quot;On Interpretation&quot;, he maintained that the concept of &quot;universal&quot; is apt to be predicated of many and that singular is not. For instance, &quot;man&quot; is a universal while &quot;Callias&quot; is a singular. The philosopher distinguished highest genera like animal and species like man but he maintained that both are predicated of individual men. This was considered part of an approach to the principle of things, which adheres to the criterion that what is most universal is also most real. Consider for example a particular oak tree. This is a member of a species and it has much in common with other oak trees, past, present and future. Its universal, its oakness, is a part of it. A biologist can study oak trees and learn about oakness and more generally the intelligible order within the sensible world. Accordingly, Aristotle was more confident than Plato about coming to know the sensible world; he was a prototypical empiricist and a founder of induction. Aristotle was a new, moderate sort of realist about universals.

==Medieval philosophy==

=== Boethius ===
The problem was introduced to the medieval world by Boethius (c. 480–524 AD), by his translation of Porphyry&#x27;s Isagoge. It begins:

&quot;I shall omit to speak about genera and species, as to whether they subsist (in the nature of things) or in mere conceptions only; whether also if subsistent, they are bodies or incorporeal, and whether they are separate from, or in, sensibles, and subsist about these, for such a treatise is most profound, and requires another more extensive investigation&quot;.

Boethius, in his commentaries on the aforementioned translation, says that a universal, if it were to exist, has to apply to several particulars entirely. He also specifies that they apply simultaneously at once and not in a temporal succession. He reasons that they cannot be mind-independent, i.e. they do not have a real existence, because a quality cannot be both one thing and common to many particulars in such a way that it forms part of a particular&#x27;s substance, as it would then be partaking of universality and particularity. However, he also says that universals can&#x27;t also be of the mind since a mental construct of a quality is an abstraction and understanding of something outside of the mind. He concludes that either this representation is a true understanding of the quality, in which case we revert to the earlier problem faced by those who believe universals are real; or, if the mental abstractions were not a true understanding, then &#x27;what is understood otherwise than the thing is false&#x27;.

His solution to this problem was to state that the mind is able to separate in thought what is not necessarily separable in reality. He cites the human mind&#x27;s ability to abstract from concrete particulars as an instance of this. This, according to Boethius, avoids the problem of Platonic universals being out there in the real world, but also the problem of them being purely constructs of the mind in that universals are simply the mind thinking of particulars in an abstract, universal way. His assumption focuses on the problems that language create. Boethius maintained that the structure of language corresponds to the structure of things and that language creates what he regarded as philosophical babble of confused and contradictory accounts of the nature of things. To illustrate his view, suppose that although the mind cannot think of 2 or 4 as an odd number, as this would be a false representation, it can think of an even number that is neither 2 nor 4.

===Medieval realism===

Boethius mostly stayed close to Aristotle in his thinking about universals. Realism&#x27;s biggest proponents in the Middle Ages, however, came to be Thomas Aquinas and Duns Scotus. Aquinas argued that both the essence of a thing and its existence were clearly distinct; in this regard he is also Aristotelian.

Duns Scotus argues that in a thing there is no real distinction between the essence and the existence; instead, there is only a formal distinction. Scotus believed that universals exist only inside the things that they exemplify, and that they &quot;contract&quot; with the haecceity of the thing to create the individual. As a result of his realist position, he argued strongly against both nominalism and conceptualism, arguing instead for Scotist realism, a medieval response to the conceptualism of Abelard. That is to say, Scotus believed that such properties as &#x27;redness&#x27; and &#x27;roundness&#x27; exist in reality and are mind-independent entities.

Furthermore, Duns Scotus wrote about this problem in his own commentary (&quot;Quaestiones&quot;) on Porphyry&#x27;s &quot;Isagoge&quot;, as Boethius had done. Scotus was interested in how the mind forms universals, and he believed this to be &#x27;caused by the intellect&#x27;. This intellect acts on the basis that the nature of, say, &#x27;humanity&#x27; that is found in other humans and also that the quality is attributable to other individual humans.

===Medieval nominalism===
The opposing view to realism is one called nominalism, which at its strongest maintains that universals are verbal constructs and that they do not inhere in objects or pre-exist them. Therefore, universals in this view are something which are peculiar to human cognition and language. The French philosopher and theologian Roscellinus (1050–1125) was an early, prominent proponent of this view. His particular view was that universals are little more than vocal utterances (&quot;voces&quot;).

William of Ockham (1285–1347) wrote extensively on this topic. He argued strongly that universals are a product of abstract human thought. According to Ockham, universals are just words or concepts (at best) that only exist in the mind and have no real place in the external world. His opposition to universals was not based on his eponymous Razor, but rather he found that regarding them as real was contradictory in some sense. An early work has Ockham stating that &#x27;no thing outside the soul is universal, either through itself or through anything real or rational added on, no matter how it is considered or understood&#x27;. Nevertheless, his position did shift away from an outright opposition to accommodating them in his later works such as the &quot;Summae Logicae&quot; (albeit in a modified way that would not classify him as a complete realist).

==Modern and contemporary philosophy==

===Hegel===
The 19th-century German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel discussed the relation of universals and particulars throughout his works. Hegel posited that both exist in a dialectical relationship to one another; that is, one exists only in relation and in reference to the other.

He stated the following on the issue:

===Mill===

The 19th-century British philosopher John Stuart Mill discussed the problem of universals in the course of a book that eviscerated the philosophy of Sir William Hamilton. Mill wrote, &quot;The formation of a concept does not consist in separating the attributes which are said to compose it from all other attributes of the same object and enabling us to conceive those attributes, disjoined from any others. We neither conceive them, nor think them, nor cognize them in any way, as a thing apart, but solely as forming, in combination with numerous other attributes, the idea of an individual object&quot;.

However, he then proceeds to state that Berkeley&#x27;s position is factually wrong by stating the following:

In other words, we may be &quot;temporarily unconscious&quot; of whether an image is white, black, yellow or purple and concentrate our attention on the fact that it is a man and on just those attributes necessary to identify it as a man (but not as any particular one). It may then have the significance of a universal of manhood.

===Peirce===
The 19th-century American logician Charles Sanders Peirce, known as the father of pragmatism, developed his own views on the problem of universals in the course of a review of an edition of the writings of George Berkeley. Peirce begins with the observation that &quot;Berkeley&#x27;s metaphysical theories have at first sight an air of paradox and levity very unbecoming to a bishop&quot;. He includes among these paradoxical doctrines Berkeley&#x27;s denial of &quot;the possibility of forming the simplest general conception&quot;. He wrote that if there is some mental fact that works &quot;in practice&quot; the way that a universal would, that fact is a universal. &quot;If I have learned a formula in gibberish which in any way jogs my memory so as to enable me in each single case to act as though I had a general idea, what possible utility is there in distinguishing between such a gibberish... and an idea?&quot; Peirce also held as a matter of ontology that what he called &quot;thirdness&quot;, the more general facts about the world, are extra-mental realities.

===James===
William James learned about pragmatism. Though James certainly agreed with Peirce and against Berkeley that general ideas exist as a psychological fact, he was a nominalist in his ontology:

There are at least three ways in which a realist might try to answer James&#x27; challenge of explaining the reason why universal conceptions are more lofty than those of particulars: the moral–political answer, the mathematical–scientific answer, and the anti-paradoxical answer. Each has contemporary or near-contemporary advocates.

===Weaver===
The moral or political response is given by the conservative philosopher Richard M. Weaver in &quot;Ideas Have Consequences&quot; (1948), where he describes how the acceptance of &quot;the fateful doctrine of nominalism&quot; was &quot;the crucial event in the history of Western culture; from this flowed those acts which issue now in modern decadence&quot;.

===Quine===

The noted American philosopher, W. V. O. Quine addressed the problem of universals throughout his career. In his paper, &#x27;On Universals&#x27;, from 1947, he states the problem of universals is chiefly understood as being concerned with entities and not the linguistic aspect of naming a universal. He says that Platonists believe that our ability to form general conceptions of things is incomprehensible unless universals exist outside of the mind, whereas nominalists believe that such ideas are &#x27;empty verbalism&#x27;. Quine himself does not propose to resolve this particular debate. What he does say however is that certain types of &#x27;discourse&#x27; presuppose universals: nominalists therefore must give these up. Quine&#x27;s approach is therefore more an epistemological one, i.e. what can be known, rather than a metaphysical one, i.e. what is real.

===Cocchiarella===
Nino Cocchiarella put forward the idea that realism is the best response to certain logical paradoxes to which nominalism leads (&quot;Nominalism and Conceptualism as Predicative Second Order Theories of Predication&quot;, &quot;Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic&quot;, vol. 21 (1980)). It is noted that in a sense Cocchiarella has adopted Platonism for anti-Platonic reasons. Plato, as seen in the dialogue &quot;Parmenides&quot;, was willing to accept a certain amount of paradox with his forms. Cocchiarella adopts the forms to avoid paradox.

===Armstrong===
The Australian philosopher David Malet Armstrong has been one of the leading realists in the twentieth century, and has used a concept of universals to build a naturalistic and scientifically realist ontology. In both &quot;Universals and Scientific Realism&quot; (1978) and &quot;Universals: An Opinionated Introduction&quot; (1989), Armstrong describes the relative merits of a number of nominalist theories which appeal either to &quot;natural classes&quot; (a view he ascribes to Anthony Quinton), concepts, resemblance relations or predicates, and also discusses non-realist &quot;trope&quot; accounts (which he describes in the &quot;Universals and Scientific Realism&quot; volumes as &quot;particularism&quot;). He gives a number of reasons to reject all of these, but also dismisses a number of realist accounts.

===Penrose===
Roger Penrose contends that the foundations of mathematics can&#x27;t be understood without the Platonic view that &quot;mathematical truth is absolute, external and eternal, and not based on man-made criteria ... mathematical objects have a timeless existence of their own...&quot;

== Indian philosophy ==

=== Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika (Realist position) ===
Indian philosophers raise the problem of universals in relation to semantics. Universals are postulated as referents for the meanings of general terms.

The Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika school conceives of universals as perceptible eternal entities, existing independently of our minds. Nyāya postulates the existence of universals based on our experience of a common characteristic among particulars. Thus, the meaning of a word is understood as a particular further characterized by a universal. For example, the meaning of the term &#x27;cow&#x27; refers to a particular cow characterized by the universal of &#x27;cowness&#x27;. Nyāya holds that although universals are apprehended differently from particulars, they are not separate, given their inherence in the particulars.

Not every term, however, corresponds to a universal. Udāyana puts forward six conditions for identifying genuine universals.

=== Mīmaṃsã (Realist position) ===
Like the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika school, Mīmaṃsã characterizes universals as referents for words. The fundamental difference between Bhāṭṭa Mīmaṃsā&#x27;s and Nyāya is that Bhāṭṭa Mīmaṃsa rejects the Nyāya understanding of the universals&#x27; relation of inherence to the particulars. The Hindu philosopher Kumārila Bhaṭṭa argues that if inherence is different from the terms of the relation, it would continuously require another common relation, and if the inherence is non-different, it would be superfluous.

=== Buddhist Nominalism ===
Buddhist ontology regards the world as consisting of momentary particulars and mentally constructed universals. In contrast to the realist schools of Indian philosophy, Buddhist logicians put forward a positive theory of nominalism, known as the apoha theory, which denies the existence of universals.

The apoha theory identifies particulars through double negation, not requiring for a general shared essence between terms. For instance, the term &#x27;cow&#x27; can be understood as referring to every entity of its exclusion class &#x27;non-cow&#x27;.

==Positions ==
There are many philosophical positions regarding universals.

# Platonic realism (also called extreme realism&quot; or exaggerated realism) is the view that universals or forms in this sense, are the causal explanation behind the notion of what things exactly are; (the view that universals are real entities existing independent of particulars).
# Aristotelian realism (also called strong realism or moderate realism) is the rejection of extreme realism. This position establishes the view of a universal as being that of the quality within a thing and every other thing individual to it; (the view that universals are real entities, but their existence is dependent on the particulars that exemplify them).
# Anti-realism is the objection to both positions. Anti-realism is divided into two subcategories; (1) Nominalism and (2) Conceptualism.

Taking &quot;beauty&quot; as example, each of these positions will state the following:

* Beauty is a property that exists in an ideal form independently of any mind or description.
* Beauty is a property that exists only when beautiful things exist.
* Beauty is a property constructed in the mind, so exists only in descriptions of things.

===Realism===

The school of realism makes the claim that universals are real and that they exist distinctly, apart from the particulars that instantiate them. Two major forms of metaphysical realism are Platonic realism (&quot;universalia ante res&quot;), meaning &quot;&#x27;universals before things&#x27;&quot; and Aristotelian realism (&quot;universalia in rebus&quot;), meaning &quot;&#x27;universals in things&#x27;&quot;. &quot;Platonic realism&quot; is the view that universals are real entities existing independent of particulars. &quot;Aristotelian realism&quot;, on the other hand, is the view that universals are real entities, but their existence is dependent on the particulars that exemplify them.

Realists tend to argue that universals must be posited as distinct entities in order to account for various phenomena. A common realist argument said to be found in Plato&#x27;s writings, is that universals are required for certain general words to have meaning and for the sentences in which they occur to be true or false. Take the sentence &quot;Djivan Gasparyan is a musician&quot; for instance. The realist may claim that this sentence is only meaningful and expresses a truth because there is an individual, Djivan Gasparyan, who possesses a certain quality: musicianship. Therefore, it is assumed that the property is a universal which is distinct from the particular individual who has the property.

===Nominalism===

Nominalists assert that only individuals or particulars exist and deny that universals are real (i.e. that they exist as entities or beings; &quot;universalia post res&quot;). The term &quot;nominalism&quot; comes from the Latin &quot;nomen&quot; (&quot;name&quot;). Four major forms of nominalism are predicate nominalism, resemblance nominalism, trope nominalism, and conceptualism. One with a nominalist view claims that we predicate the same property of/to multiple entities, but argues that the entities only share a name and do not have a real quality in common.

Nominalists often argue this view by claiming that nominalism can account for all the relevant phenomena, and therefore—by Occam&#x27;s razor, and its principle of simplicity—nominalism is preferable, since it posits fewer entities. Different variants and versions of nominalism have been endorsed or defended by many, including Chrysippus, Ibn Taymiyyah, William of Ockham, Ibn Khaldun, Rudolf Carnap, Nelson Goodman, David Lewis, H. H. Price, and D. C. Williams.

=== Conceptualism ===
Conceptualism is a position that is meshed between realism and nominalism. Conceptualists believe that universals can indeed be real, but only existing as concepts within the mind. Conceptualists argue that the &quot;concept&quot; of universals are not mere &quot;inventions but are reflections of similarities among particular things themselves.&quot; For example, the concept of &#x27;man&#x27; ultimately reflects a similarity amongst Socrates and Kant.

<text>A plea bargain, also known as a plea agreement or plea deal, is a legal arrangement in criminal law where the defendant agrees to plead guilty or no contest to a charge in exchange for concessions from the prosecutor. These concessions can include a reduction in the severity of the charges, the dismissal of some charges, or a more lenient sentencing recommendation. Plea bargaining serves as a mechanism to expedite the resolution of criminal cases, allowing both the prosecution and the defense to avoid the time, expense, and uncertainty of a trial. It is a prevalent practice in the United States, where it resolves the vast majority of criminal cases, and has been adopted in various forms in other legal systems worldwide. 

Plea bargains can take different forms, such as &quot;charge bargaining&quot;, where a defendant pleads guilty to a lesser offense, or &quot;sentence bargaining&quot;, where the expected sentence is agreed upon before a guilty plea. In addition, count bargaining involves pleading guilty to a subset of multiple charges. While plea bargaining can reduce the burden on courts and offer defendants a chance for lighter sentences, it has been subject to criticism. Detractors argue that it may encourage defendants, including the innocent, to plead guilty out of fear of harsher penalties if convicted at trial. Proponents, however, emphasize its role in conserving judicial resources and providing a degree of certainty for all parties involved.

The practice of plea bargaining has spread globally but varies significantly based on local legal traditions and regulations. In some jurisdictions, the judiciary retains the final authority to approve or reject plea agreements, ensuring that any proposed sentence aligns with public interest and justice standards. Despite its efficiency, the use of plea bargains remains controversial, particularly when weighed against principles of transparency, fairness, and the right to a full trial.

==Advantages==
Plea bargaining has been defended as a voluntary exchange that leaves both parties better off, in that defendants have many procedural and substantive rights, including a right to trial and to appeal a guilty verdict. By pleading guilty, defendants waive those rights in exchange for a commitment from the prosecutor, such as a reduced charge or more favorable sentence. For a defendant who believes that conviction is almost certain, a discount to the sentence is more useful than an unlikely chance of acquittal. The prosecutor secures a conviction while avoiding the need to commit time and resources to trial preparation and a possible trial. Plea bargaining similarly helps preserve money and resources for the court in which the prosecution occurs. It also means that victims and witnesses do not have to testify at the trial, which in some cases may be traumatic.

==Disadvantages and issues==
=== Scope for coercive manipulation ===
Plea bargaining is criticized, particularly outside the United States, on the grounds that its close relationship with rewards, threats and coercion potentially endanger the correct legal outcome.

Author Martin Yant discusses the use of coercion in plea bargaining:

Even when the charges are more serious, prosecutors often can still bluff defense attorneys and their clients into pleading guilty to a lesser offense. As a result, people who might have been acquitted because of lack of evidence, but also who are in fact truly innocent, will often plead guilty to the charge. Why? In a word, fear. And the more numerous and serious the charges, studies have shown, the greater the fear. That explains why prosecutors sometimes seem to file every charge imaginable against defendants.

This tactic is prohibited in some other countries—for example in the United Kingdom the prosecutor&#x27;s code states:

Prosecutors should never go ahead with more charges than are necessary just to encourage a defendant to plead guilty to a few. In the same way, they should never go ahead with a more serious charge just to encourage a defendant to plead guilty to a less serious one.

although it adds that in some kinds of complex cases such as major fraud trials:

The over-riding duty of the prosecutor is ... to see that justice is done. The procedures must command public and judicial confidence. Many defendants in serious and complex fraud cases are represented by solicitors experienced in commercial litigation, including negotiation. This means that the defendant is usually protected from being put under improper pressure to plead. The main danger to be guarded against in these cases is that the prosecutor is persuaded to agree to a plea or a basis that is not in the public interest and interests of justice because it does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the offending ... Any plea agreement must reflect the seriousness and extent of the offending and give the court adequate sentencing powers. It must consider the impact of an agreement on victims and also the wider public, whilst respecting the rights of defendants.

John H. Langbein argues that the modern American system of plea bargaining is comparable to the medieval European system of torture:
There is, of course, a difference between having your limbs crushed if you refuse to confess, or suffering some extra years of imprisonment if you refuse to confess, but the difference is of degree, not kind. Plea bargaining, like torture, is coercive. Like the medieval Europeans, the Americans are now operating a procedural system that engages in condemnation without adjudication.

=== Consequences for innocent accused ===
Theoretical work based on the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma is one reason that, in many countries, plea bargaining is forbidden. Often, precisely the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma scenario applies: it is in the interest of both suspects to confess and testify against the other suspect, irrespective of the innocence of the accused. Arguably, the worst case is when only one party is guilty: here, the innocent one has no incentive to confess, while the guilty one has a strong incentive to confess and give testimony (including &quot;false&quot; testimony) against the innocent.

A 2009 study by the European Association of Law and Economics observed that innocent defendants are consistently more likely than guilty defendants to reject otherwise-favorable pleas proposals, even when theoretically disadvantageous to do so, because of perceived unfairness, and would do so even if the expected sanction would be worse if they proceeded to trial. The study concluded that &quot;[t]his somewhat counterintuitive &#x27;cost of innocence&#x27;, where the preferences of innocents lead them collectively to fare worse than their guilty counterparts, is further increased by the practice of imposing much harsher sentences at trial on defendants who contest the charges. This &#x27;trial penalty&#x27; seeks to facilitate guilty pleas by guilty defendants [...and ironically...] disproportionately, collectively, penalizes innocents, who reject on fairness grounds some offers their guilty counterparts accept.&quot;

The extent to which innocent people will accept a plea bargain and plead guilty is contentious and has been subjected to considerable research. Much research has focused on the relatively few actual cases where innocence was subsequently proven, such as successful appeals for murder and rape based upon DNA evidence, which tend to be atypical of trials as a whole (being by their nature only the most serious kinds of crime). Other studies have focused on presenting hypothetical situations to subjects and asking what choice they would make. More recently some studies have attempted to examine actual reactions of innocent persons generally, when faced with actual plea bargain decisions. A study by Dervan and Edkins (2013) attempted to recreate a real-life controlled plea bargain situation, rather than merely asking theoretical responses to a theoretical situation—a common approach in previous research. It placed subjects in a situation where an accusation of academic fraud (cheating) could be made, of which some subjects were in fact by design actually guilty (and knew this), and some were innocent but faced seemingly strong evidence of guilt and no verifiable proof of innocence. Each subject was presented with the evidence of guilt and offered a choice between facing an academic ethics board and potentially a heavy penalty in terms of extra courses and other forfeits, or admitting guilt and accepting a lighter &quot;sentence&quot;. The study found that as expected from court statistics, around 90% of accused subjects who were actually guilty chose to take the plea-bargain and plead guilty. It also found that around 56% of subjects who were actually innocent (and privately knew it) also take up the plea-bargain and plead guilty, for reasons including avoiding formal quasi-legal processes, uncertainty, possibility of greater harm to personal future plans, or deprivation of home environment due to remedial courses. The authors stated:

Previous research has argued that the innocence problem is minimal because defendants are risk-prone and willing to defend themselves before a tribunal. Our research, however, demonstrates that when study participants are placed in real, rather than hypothetical, bargaining situations and are presented with accurate information regarding their statistical probability of success, just as they might be so informed by their attorney or the government during a criminal plea negotiation, innocent defendants are highly risk-averse.

More pressure to plea bargain may be applied in weak cases (where there is less certainty of both guilt and jury conviction) than strong cases. Prosecutors tend to be strongly motivated by conviction rates, and &quot;there are many indications that prosecutors are willing to go a long way to avoid losing cases, [and that] when prosecutors decide to proceed with such weak cases they are often willing to go a long way to assure that a plea bargain is struck&quot;. Prosecutors often have great power to procure a desired level of incentive, as they select the charges to be presented. For this reason,

[P]lea bargains are just as likely in strong and weak cases. Prosecutors only need to adjust the offer to the probability of conviction in order to reach an agreement. Thus, weaker cases result in more lenient plea bargains, and stronger ones in relative harshness, but both result in an agreement. [... W]hen the case is weak, the parties must rely on charge bargaining ... But [charge bargaining] is hardly an obstacle. Charge bargaining in weak cases is not the exception; it is the norm all around the country. Thus, even if the evidence against innocent defendants is, on average, weaker, the likelihood of plea bargains is not dependent on guilt.

Another situation in which an innocent defendant may plead guilty is in the case of a defendant who cannot raise bail, and who is being held in custody in a jail or detention facility. Because it may take months, or even years, for criminal cases to come to trial or even indictment in some jurisdictions, an innocent defendant who is offered a plea bargain that includes a sentence of less time than they would otherwise spend in jail awaiting an indictment or a trial may choose to accept the plea arrangement and plead guilty.

=== Misalignment of goals and incentives ===
Agency problems may arise in plea bargaining as, although the prosecutor represents the people and the defense attorney represents the defendant, these agents&#x27; goals may not be congruent with those of their principles. For example, prosecutors and defense attorneys may seek to maintain good relations with one another, creating a potential conflict with the parties they represent. A defense attorney may receive a flat fee for representing a client, or may not receive additional money for taking a case to trial, creating an incentive for the defense attorney to settle a case to increase profits or to avoid a financial loss.

A prosecutor may want to maintain a high conviction rate or avoid a losing high-profile trials, creating the potential that they will enter into a plea bargain that furthers their interests but reduces the potential of the prosecution and sentence to deter crime. Prosecutors may also make charging decisions that significantly affect a defendant&#x27;s sentence, and may file charges or offer plea deals that cause even an innocent defendant to consider or accept a plea bargain.

=== Issues related to cost of justice ===
Another argument against plea bargaining is that it may not actually reduce the costs of administering justice. For example, if a prosecutor has only a 25% chance of winning his case and sending a defendant away to prison for 10 years, they may make a plea agreement for a sentence of one year; but if plea bargaining is unavailable, a prosecutor may drop the case completely.

==Usage in common law countries==
===Canada===
In Canada, the courts always have the final say with regard to sentencing. Nevertheless, plea bargaining has become an accepted part of the criminal justice system although judges and Crown attorneys are often reluctant to refer to it as such. In most Canadian criminal proceedings, the Crown has the ability to recommend a lighter sentence than it would seek following a guilty verdict in exchange for a guilty plea.

Like other common law jurisdictions, the Crown can also agree to withdraw some charges against the defendant in exchange for a guilty plea. This has become standard procedure for certain offences such as impaired driving. In the case of hybrid offences, the Crown must make a binding decision as to whether to proceed summarily or by indictment prior to the defendant making his or her plea. If the Crown elects to proceed summarily and the defendant then pleads not guilty, the Crown cannot change its election. Therefore, the Crown is not in a position to offer to proceed summarily in exchange for a guilty plea.

Canadian judges are not bound by the Crown&#x27;s sentencing recommendations and could impose harsher (or more lenient) penalties. Therefore, the Crown and the defence will often make a &quot;joint submission&quot; with respect to sentencing. While a joint submission can entail both the Crown and defence recommending exactly the same disposition of a case, this is not common except in cases that are sufficiently minor that the Crown is willing to recommend a discharge. In more serious cases, a joint submission normally call for a sentence within relatively narrow range, with the Crown arguing for a sentence at the upper end of the range and the defence arguing for a sentence at the lower end, so as to maintain the visibility of the judge&#x27;s ability to exercise discretion.

Judges are not bound to impose a sentence within the range of a joint submission, and a judge&#x27;s disregard for a joint submission is not in itself grounds for the sentence to be altered on appeal. However, if a judge routinely disregards joint submissions, that judge would compromise the ability of the Crown to offer meaningful incentives for defendants to plead guilty. Defence lawyers would become reluctant to enter into joint submissions if they were thought to be of little value with a particular judge, which would thus result in otherwise avoidable trials. For these reasons, Canadian judges will normally impose a sentence within the range of any joint submission.

Following a Supreme Court of Canada ruling that imposes strict time limits on the resolution of criminal cases (eighteen months for cases in provincial court and thirty months for cases in Superior Court), several provinces have initiated and intensified measures intended to maximize the number of minor criminal cases resolved by a plea bargain.

Largely particular to the Canadian justice system is that further negotiations concerning the final disposition of a criminal case may also arise even after a sentence has been passed. This is because in Canada the Crown has (by common law standards) a very broad right to appeal acquittals, and also a right to appeal for harsher sentences except in cases where the sentence imposed was maximum allowed. Therefore, in Canada, after sentencing the defence sometimes has an incentive to try to persuade the Crown to not appeal a case, in exchange for the defence also declining to appeal. While, strictly speaking, this is not plea bargaining, it is done for largely the same reasons.

===England and Wales===
In England and Wales, plea bargaining, in the sense of seeking a particular sentence in exchange for dropping some charges, is not permitted; only the judge or magistrates have the power to determine sentence, and an agreement between the prosecution and defence cannot bind the court. The Crown Prosecution Service is required to prosecute an offence only where there is a realistic prospect of conviction, so greater charges cannot lawfully be used in bad faith to intimidate the defendant into accepting the charge actually sought.

A defendant is permitted to plead guilty to some charges listed on the charge sheet or indictment and deny others, and the prosecution may agree to accept this plea and drop the denied charges; such an agreement will generally be accepted by the court as it serves the public interest, as well as the defendant&#x27;s and victims&#x27; interests, to avoid the expense and stress of a trial. The defendant may also plead guilty on the basis of accepted facts that may affect sentencing while denying others, but the Sentencing Council stresses that the prosecution should accept such a plea only if it enables the court to impose a sentence and make other ancillary orders that are appropriate for the seriousness of the offence, and never merely for the sake of convenience. The prosecution must also take the victims&#x27; views into account.

In cases before the Crown Court, the defendant can request an indication from the judge of the likely maximum sentence that would be imposed should the defendant decide to plead guilty. Following the rule in &quot;R v Goodyear&quot;, it is only appropriate to give such an indication if requested by the defence with the defendant&#x27;s written authorization; such indication is treated as binding on the court, but only if the defendant actually pleads guilty, and cannot prevent the sentence being appealed as unduly lenient.

In the case of either way offences, the decision whether to deal with a case in a magistrates&#x27; court or the Crown Court is not made by magistrates until after a plea has been entered. A defendant is thus unable to plead guilty in exchange for having a case dealt with in magistrates&#x27; court (which has lesser sentencing powers).

Where the defendant pleads guilty or indicates an intention to do so, the guidelines set by the Sentencing Council typically require that they receive a discount on the sentence, with the amount of discount depending on the timing:
*Indicating a guilty plea at the first opportunity (typically the committal hearing in the magistrates&#x27; court): one third
*Pleading guilty at a later hearing in the magistrates&#x27; court, or at the first hearing in crown court (typically the plea and case management hearing): one quarter
*Pleading guilty on the first day of trial: one tenth

The discount can sometimes involve changing the type of punishment, such as substituting a prison sentence for community service. For some offences where a mandatory minimum sentence applies, section 73 of the Sentencing Act 2020 permits the sentence to be reduced this way up to 20 percent below the minimum.

Section 73 requires the court to take into account the circumstances under which an indication to plead guilty was made in addition to its timing.

===India===
Plea bargaining was introduced in India by &quot;The Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2005&quot;, which amended the Code of Criminal Procedure and introduced a new chapter, XXI(A), in the code, enforceable from July 5, 2006. It allows plea bargaining for cases in which the maximum punishment is imprisonment for seven years or less; however, offenses affecting the socio-economic condition of the country and offenses committed against a woman or a child below 14 are excluded.

In 2007, the Sakharam Bandekar case became the first such case in India where the accused, Sakharam Bandekar, requested lesser punishment in return for confessing to his crime (using plea bargaining). However, the court rejected his plea and accepted the CBI&#x27;s argument that the accused was facing serious charges of corruption. Finally, the court convicted Bandekar and sentenced him to three years&#x27; imprisonment.

In December 2023, Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) was passed, to replace Code of Criminal Procedure by July 2024, which allows first time offender to be given relaxed punishment (one-fourth and one-sixth of such punishment) in plea bargaining.

===Pakistan===
Plea bargaining as a formal legal provision was introduced in Pakistan by the National Accountability Ordinance 1999, an anti-corruption law. A special feature of this plea bargain is that the accused applies for it, accepting guilt, and offers to return the proceeds of corruption as determined by investigators and prosecutors. After an endorsement by the Chairman National Accountability Bureau, the request is presented before the court, which decides whether it should be accepted or not. If the request for plea bargain is accepted by the court, the accused stands convicted but neither is sentenced if in trial nor undergoes any sentence previously pronounced by a lower court if in appeal. The accused is disqualified to take part in elections, hold any public office, or obtain a loan from any bank; the accused is also dismissed from service if a government official.

In other cases, formal plea bargains in Pakistan are limited, but the prosecutor has the authority to drop a case or a charge in a case and, in practice, often does so, in return for a defendant pleading guilty on some lesser charge. No bargaining takes place over the penalty, which is the court&#x27;s sole privilege.

===United States===

Plea bargaining is a significant part of the criminal justice system in the United States; the vast majority (roughly 90%) of criminal cases in the United States are settled by plea bargain rather than by a jury trial. Plea bargains are subject to the approval of the court, and different states and jurisdictions have different rules. The Federal Sentencing Guidelines are followed in federal cases and have been created to ensure a standard of uniformity in all cases decided in the federal courts. A two- or three-level offense level reduction is usually available for those who accept responsibility by not holding the prosecution to the burden of proving its case; this usually amounts to a complete sentence reduction had they gone to trial and lost.

The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provide for two main types of plea agreements. An 11(c)(1)(B) agreement does not bind the court; the prosecutor&#x27;s recommendation is merely advisory, and the defendant cannot withdraw their plea if the court decides to impose a sentence other than what was stipulated in the agreement. An 11(c)(1)(C) agreement, however, binds the court once the court accepts the agreement. When such an agreement is proposed, the court can reject it if it disagrees with the proposed sentence, in which case the defendant has an opportunity to withdraw their plea.

Plea bargains are so common in the Superior Courts of California (the general trial courts) that the Judicial Council of California has published an optional seven-page form (containing all mandatory advisements required by federal and state law) to help prosecutors and defense attorneys reduce such bargains into written plea agreements.

Certain aspects of the American justice system serve to promote plea bargaining. For example, the adversarial nature of the U.S. criminal justice system puts judges in a passive role, in which they have no independent access to information with which to assess the strength of the case against the defendant. The prosecutor and defense may thus control the outcome of a case through plea bargaining. The court must approve a plea bargain as being within the interests of justice.

The lack of compulsory prosecution also gives prosecutors greater discretion as well as the inability of crime victims to mount a private prosecution and their limited ability to influence plea agreements. Defendants who are held in custody—who either do not have the right to bail or cannot afford bail, or who do not qualify for release on their own recognizance—may get out of jail immediately following the judge&#x27;s acceptance of a plea.

Generally, once a plea bargain is made and accepted by the courts, the matter is final and cannot be appealed. However, a defendant may withdraw his plea for certain legal reasons, and a defendant may agree to a &quot;conditional&quot; plea bargain, whereby they plead guilty and accept a sentence, but reserve the right to appeal a specific matter (such as violation of a constitutional right). If the defendant does not win on appeal the agreement is carried out; if the defendant is successful on appeal the bargain is terminated. The defendant in &quot;Doggett v. United States&quot; made such a bargain, reserving the right to appeal solely on the grounds that he was not given a speedy trial as required by the United States Constitution; Doggett&#x27;s claim was upheld by the United States Supreme Court and he was freed.

===Other common law jurisdictions===
In some common law jurisdictions, such as Singapore and the Australian state of Victoria, plea bargaining is practiced only to the extent that the prosecution and the defense can agree that the defendant will plead guilty to some charges or to reduced charges in exchange for the prosecutor withdrawing the remaining or more serious charges. In New South Wales, a 10-25% discount on the sentence is customarily given in exchange for an early guilty plea, but this concession is expected to be granted by the judge as a way of recognizing the utilitarian value of an early guilty plea to the justice system - it is never negotiated with a prosecutor. The courts in these jurisdictions have made it plain that they will always decide what the appropriate penalty is to be. No bargaining takes place between the prosecution and the defence over criminal penalties.

==Use in civil law countries==
Plea bargaining is extremely difficult in jurisdictions based on the civil law. This is because, unlike common law systems, civil law systems have no concept of plea: if the defendant confesses, a confession is entered into evidence, but the prosecution is not absolved of the duty to present a full case. A court may decide that a defendant is innocent even though they presented a full confession. Also, unlike common law systems, prosecutors in civil law countries may have limited or no power to drop or reduce charges after a case has been filed, and in some countries their power to drop or reduce charges &quot;before&quot; a case has been filed is limited, making plea bargaining impossible. Since the 1980s, some civil law nations have adapted their systems to allow for plea bargaining.

===Brazil===
In 2013 Brazil passed a law allowing plea bargains, which have been used in the political corruption trials taking place since then.

===Central African Republic===
In the Central African Republic, witchcraft carries heavy penalties but those accused of it typically confess in exchange for a modest sentence.

===China===
In China, a plea bargaining pilot scheme was introduced by the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress in 2016. For defendants that face jail terms of three years or fewer, agrees to plead guilty voluntarily and agree with prosecutors&#x27; crime and sentencing proposals are given mitigated punishments.

===Denmark===
In 2009, in a case about whether witness testimony originating from a plea deal in the United States was admissible in a Danish criminal trial &quot;(297/2008 H)&quot;, the Supreme Court of Denmark (Danish: Højesteret) unanimously ruled that plea bargains are &quot;prima facie&quot; not legal under Danish law, but that the witnesses in the particular case would be allowed to testify regardless (with the caveat that the lower court consider the possibility that the testimony was untrue or at least influenced by the benefits of the plea bargain). The Supreme Court did, however, point out that Danish law contains mechanisms similar to plea bargains, such as of the Danish Penal Code (Danish: &quot;Straffeloven&quot;) which states that a sentence may be reduced if the perpetrator of a crime provides information that helps solve a crime perpetrated by others, or of the Danish Competition Law (Danish: &quot;Konkurrenceloven&quot;) which states that someone can apply to avoid being fined or prosecuted for participating in a cartel if they provide information about the cartel that the authorities did not know at the time.

If a defendant admits to having committed a crime, the prosecution does not have to file charges against them, and the case can be heard as a so-called &quot;admission case&quot; (Danish: &quot;tilståelsessag&quot;) under of the Law on the Administration of Justice (Danish: &quot;Retsplejeloven&quot;) provided that: the confession is supported by other pieces of evidence (meaning that a confession is not enough to convict someone on its own); both the defendant and the prosecutor consent to it; the court does not have any objections; §§ 68, 69, 70 and 73 of the penal code do not apply to the case.

===France===
The introduction of a limited form of plea bargaining (&quot;comparution sur reconnaissance préalable de culpabilité&quot; or CRPC, often summarized as &quot;plaider coupable&quot;) in 2004 was highly controversial in France. In this system, the public prosecutor could propose to suspects of relatively minor crimes a penalty not exceeding one year in prison; the deal, if accepted, had to be accepted by a judge. Opponents, usually lawyers and leftist political parties, argued that plea bargaining would greatly infringe on the rights of defense, the long-standing constitutional right of presumption of innocence, the rights of suspects in police custody, and the right to a fair trial.

For instance, Robert Badinter argued that plea bargaining would give too much power to the public prosecutor and would encourage defendants to accept a sentence only to avoid the risk of a bigger sentence in a trial, even if they did not really deserve it. Only a minority of criminal cases are settled by that method: in 2009, 77,500 out of the 673,700 or 11.5% of the decisions by the correctional courts.

===Georgia===
Plea bargaining (Georgian: საპროცესო შეთანხმება, literally &quot;plea agreement&quot;) was introduced in Georgia in 2004. The substance of the Georgian plea bargaining is similar to the United States and other common law jurisdictions.

A plea bargaining, also called a plea agreement or negotiated plea, is an alternative and consensual way of criminal case settlement. A plea agreement means settlement of case without main hearing when the defendant agrees to plead guilty in exchange for a lesser charge or for a more lenient sentence or for dismissal of certain related charges. (Article 209 of the Criminal Procedure Code of Georgia)

====Defendants&#x27; rights during plea bargaining====

The main principle of the plea bargaining is that it must be based on the free will of the defendant, equality of the parties and advanced protection of the rights of the defendant:
* In order to avoid fraud of the defendant or insufficient consideration of his or her interests, legislation foresees obligatory participation of the defense council; (Article 210 of the Criminal Procedure Code of Georgia)
* The defendant has the right to reject the plea agreement on any stage of the criminal proceedings before the court renders the judgment. (Article 213 of the Criminal Procedure Code of Georgia)
* In case of refusal, it is prohibited to use information provided by the defendant under the plea agreement against him or her in the future. (Article 214 of the Criminal Procedure Code of Georgia)
* The defendant has the right to appeal the judgment rendered consequent to the plea agreement if the plea agreement was concluded by deception, coercion, violence, threat, or violence. (Article 215 of the Criminal Procedure Code of Georgia)

====Obligations of the prosecutor while concluding the plea agreement====

While concluding the plea agreement, the prosecutor is obliged to take into consideration public interest, severity of the penalty, and personal characteristics of the defendant. (Article 210 of the Criminal Procedure Code of Georgia)
To avoid abuse of powers, legislation foresees written consent of the supervisory prosecutor as necessary precondition to conclude plea agreement and to amend its provisions. (Article 210 of the Criminal Procedure Code of Georgia)

====Oversight over the plea agreement====

Plea agreement without the approval of the court does not have the legal effect. 
The court must satisfy itself that the plea agreement is concluded on the basis of the free will of the defendant, that the defendant fully acknowledges the essence of the plea agreement and its consequences. (Article 212 of the Criminal Procedure Code of Georgia)

A guilty plea of the defendant is not enough to render a guilty judgment. (Article 212 of the Criminal Procedure Code of Georgia) Consequently, the court is obliged to discuss two issues:

* Whether irrefutable evidence is presented which proves the defendant&#x27;s guilt beyond reasonable doubt.
* Whether the sentence provided for in the plea agreement is legitimate. (Article 212 of the Criminal Procedure Code of Georgia).
After both criteria are satisfied the court additionally checks whether formalities related to the legislative requirements are followed and only then makes its decision.

If the court finds that presented evidence is not sufficient to support the charges or that a motion to render a judgment without substantial consideration of a case is submitted in violation of the requirements stipulated by the Criminal Procedure Code of Georgia, it shall return the case to the prosecution. The court before returning the case to the prosecutor offers the parties to change the terms of the agreement. If the changed terms do not satisfy the court, then it shall return the case to the prosecution. (Article 213 of the Criminal Procedure Code of Georgia).

If the court satisfies itself that the defendant fully acknowledges the consequences of the plea agreement, and he or she was represented by the defense council, his or her will is expressed in full compliance with the legislative requirements without deception and coercion, also if there is enough body of doubtless evidence for the conviction and the agreement is reached on legitimate sentence - the court approves the plea agreement and renders guilty judgment. If any of the abovementioned requirements are not satisfied, the court rejects to approve the plea agreement and returns the case to the prosecutor. (Article 213 of the Criminal Procedure Code of Georgia).

====Role of the victim in plea agreement negotiations====

The plea agreement is concluded between the parties - the prosecutor and the defendant. Notwithstanding the fact that the victim is not party to the criminal case and the prosecutor is not a tool in the hands of the victim to obtain revenge against the offender, the attitude of the victim in relation to the plea agreement is still important.

Under Article 217 of the Criminal Procedure Code of Georgia, the prosecutor is obliged to consult with the victim prior to concluding the plea agreement and inform him or her about this. In addition, under the Guidelines of the Prosecution Service of Georgia, the prosecutor is obliged to take into consideration the interests of the victim and as a rule conclude the plea agreement after the damage is compensated.

===Germany===
Plea agreements have made a limited appearance in Germany. However, there is no exact equivalent of a guilty plea in German criminal procedure.

===Italy===
Italy has a form of bargaining, popularly known as &quot;patteggiamento&quot; but that has a technical name of penalty application under request of the parts. In fact, the bargaining is not about the charges, but about the penalty applied in sentence, reduced up to one third.

When the defendant deems that the punishment that would, concretely, be handed down is less than a five-year imprisonment (or that it would just be a fine), the defendant may request to plea bargain with the prosecutor. The defendant is rewarded with a reduction on the sentence and has other advantages (such as that the defendant does not pay the fees on the proceeding). The defendant must accept the penalty for the charges (even if the plea-bargained sentence has some particular matters in further compensation proceedings), no matter how serious the charges are.

Sometimes, the prosecutor agrees to reduce a charge or to drop some of multiple charges in exchange for the defendant&#x27;s acceptance of the penalty. The defendant, in the request, could argue with the penalty and aggravating and extenuating circumstancing with the prosecutor, that can accept or refuse. The request could also be made by the prosecutor. The plea bargaining could be granted if the penalty that could be concretely applied is, after the reduction of one third, inferior to five-year imprisonment (so called &quot;patteggiamento allargato&quot;, wide bargaining); When the penalty applied, after the reduction of one third, is inferior of two years imprisonment or is only a fine (so called &quot;patteggiamento ristretto&quot; limited bargaining), the defendant can have other advantages, like sentence suspended and the effacement of the crime if in five year of the sentence, the defendant does not commit a similar crime.

In the request, when it could be applied the conditional suspension of the penalty according to the article 163 and following of the Italian penal code, the defendant could subordinate the request to the grant of the suspension; if the judge rejects the suspension, the bargaining is refused. When both the prosecutor and the defendant have come to an agreement, the proposal is submitted to the judge, who can refuse or accept the plea bargaining.

According to Italian law, a bargain does not need a guilty plea (in Italy there is no plea declaration); for this reason, a bargaining sentence is only an acceptance of the penalty in exchange with the stop of investigation and trial and has no binding cogency in other trials, especially in civil trials in which parts argue of the same facts at the effects of civil liability and in other criminal trials in which are processed the accomplices of the defendant that had requested and got a bargaining sentence.

===Japan===
In Japan, plea bargaining was previously forbidden by law, although sources reported that prosecutors illegally offered defendants plea bargains in exchange for their confessions.

Plea bargaining was introduced in Japan in June 2018. The first case of plea bargaining under this system, in July 2018, involved allegations of bribery by Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems in Thailand. The second case was a November 2018 deal to obtain evidence of accounting and securities law violations against Nissan executives Carlos Ghosn and Greg Kelly.

Under the Japanese system, formally known as the , plea bargaining is available in prosecutions for organized crime, competition law violations, and economic crimes such as securities law violations. The prosecutor, defendant, and defense counsel each sign a written agreement, which must then be admitted into evidence in a public court without delay.

===Poland===
Poland also adopted a limited form of plea bargaining, which is applicable only to minor felonies (punishable by no more than 10 years of imprisonment). The procedure is called &quot;voluntary submission to a penalty&quot; and allows the court to pass an agreed sentence without reviewing the evidence, which significantly shortens the trial.
There are some specific conditions that have to be simultaneously met:
* the defendant pleads guilty and proposes a penalty,
* the prosecutor agrees,
* the victim agrees,
* the court agrees.
However, the court may object to the terms of proposed plea agreement (even if already agreed between the defendant, victim and prosecutor) and suggest changes (not specific but rather general). If the defendant accepts these suggestions and changes his penalty proposition, the court approves it and passes the verdict according to the plea agreement. In spite of the agreement, all the parties of the trial: prosecution, defendant and the victim as an auxiliary prosecutor (in Poland, the victim may declare that he wants to act as an &quot;auxiliary prosecutor&quot; and consequently gains the rights similar to official prosecutor) - have the right to appeal.

===Spain===
Spain has relatively recently adopted a limited form of plea bargaining and the procedure is called a &quot;conformity sentence&quot; meaning the accused is in agreement and can only be used in minor charges but not in serious charges where nine or more years of prison may be imposed.

<doc id="23477" wikidata="Q829147" url="?curid=23477" title="Protest song">
<text>A protest song is a song that is associated with a movement for protest and social change and hence part of the broader category of &quot;topical&quot; songs (or songs connected to current events). It may be folk, classical, or commercial in genre.

Among social movements that have an associated body of songs are the abolition movement, prohibition, women&#x27;s suffrage, the labour movement, the human rights movement, civil rights, the Native American rights movement, the Jewish rights movement, disability rights, the anti-war movement and 1960s counterculture, art repatriation, opposition against blood diamonds, abortion rights, the feminist movement, the sexual revolution, the LGBT rights movement, animal rights movement, vegetarianism and veganism, gun rights, legalization of marijuana and environmentalism.

Protest songs are often situational, having been associated with a social movement through context. &quot;Goodnight Irene&quot;, for example, acquired the aura of a protest song because it was written by Lead Belly, a black convict and social outcast, although on its face it is a love song. Or they may be abstract, expressing, in more general terms, opposition to injustice and support for peace, or free thought, but audiences usually know what is being referred to. Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Ode to Joy&quot;, a song in support of universal brotherhood, is a song of this kind. It is a setting of a poem by Friedrich Schiller celebrating the continuum of living beings (who are united in their capacity for feeling pain and pleasure and hence for empathy), to which Beethoven himself added the lines that all men are brothers. Songs which support the status quo do not qualify as protest songs.

Protest song texts may have significant specific content. The labour movement musical &quot;Pins and Needles&quot; articulated a definition of a protest song in a number called &quot;Sing Me a Song of Social Significance&quot;. Phil Ochs once explained, &quot;A protest song is a song that&#x27;s so specific that you cannot mistake it for BS.&quot; Some researchers have argued that protest songs must express opposition or, at the very least, offer some alternative solutions if they are limited to drawing attention to social issues. A broad definition, which does not exclude any upcoming form of creativity, defines a protest song as one performed by protesters.

An 18th-century example of a topical song intended as a feminist protest song is &quot;Rights of Woman&quot; (1795), sung to the tune of &quot;God Save the King&quot;, written anonymously by &quot;A Lady&quot; and published in the &quot;Philadelphia Minerva&quot;, October 17, 1795. There is no evidence that it was ever sung as a movement song, however.

==Types==
The sociologist R. Serge Denisoff saw protest songs rather narrowly in terms of their function, as forms of persuasion or propaganda. Denisoff saw the protest song tradition as originating in the &quot;psalms&quot; or songs of grassroots Protestant religious revival movements, terming these hymns &quot;protest-propaganda&quot;, as well.

Denisoff subdivided protest songs as either &quot;magnetic&quot; or &quot;rhetorical&quot;. &quot;Magnetic&quot; protest songs were aimed at attracting people to the movement and promoting group solidarity and commitment – for example, &quot;Keep Your Eyes on the Prize&quot; and &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot;. &quot;Rhetorical&quot; protest songs, on the other hand, are often characterized by individual indignation and offer a straightforward political message designed to change political opinion. Denisoff argued that although &quot;rhetorical&quot; songs often are not overtly connected to building a larger movement, they should nevertheless be considered as &quot;protest-propaganda&quot;. Examples include Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Masters of War&quot; (which contains the lines &quot;I hope that you die / And your death&#x27;ll come soon&quot;) and &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot; by Marvin Gaye.

Ron Eyerman and Andrew Jamison, in &quot;Music and Social Movements: Mobilizing Tradition in the Twentieth Century&quot; (1998), take issue with what they consider Denisoff&#x27;s reductive approach to the history and function of song (and particularly traditional song) in social movements. They point out that Denisoff had paid little attention to the song tunes of protest music, considered them strictly subordinate to the texts, a means to the message. It is true that in the highly text-oriented western European song tradition, tunes can be subordinate, interchangeable, and even limited in number (as in Portuguese &quot;fado&quot;, which only has 64 tunes), nevertheless, Eyerman and Jamison point out that some of the most effective protest songs gain power through their appropriation of tunes that are bearers of strong cultural traditions. They also note that:There is more to music and movements than can be captured within a functional perspective, such as Denisoff&#x27;s, which focuses on the use made of music within already-existing movements. Music, and song, we suggest, can maintain a movement even when it no longer has a visible presence in the form of organizations, leaders, and demonstrations, and can be a vital force in preparing the emergence of a new movement. Here the role and place of music needs to be interpreted through a broader framework in which tradition and ritual are understood as processes of identity and identification, as encoded and embodied forms of collective meaning and memory.

Martin Luther King Jr. described the freedom songs this way: &quot;They invigorate the movement in a most significant way... these freedom songs serve to give unity to a movement.&quot;

===Algeria===
Raï () is a form of folk music, originated in Oran, Algeria from Bedouin shepherds, mixed with Spanish, French, African and Arabic musical forms. Its origins date back to the 1920s and has been primarily evolved by the women referred to as cheikhas, who performed in cafes, bars or bordellos, often for men. A typical performance included the cheikhas accompanied by two to four male instrumentalists playing a gasba (a wooden flute) and gallal (a metal drum). Rai was considered a rejection of the traditional Algerian music of the time, and the cheikhas &quot; . . . used lewd lyrics focusing on the hardships of life facing peasant women in a big city, the pain of love, the lure of alcohol, immigration, and mourning.&quot;

By the 1950s, and through the 1960s, male musicians began performing rai music and incorporated the use of what was considered to be modern musical instruments of that time, such as the violin, the accordion, the lute, and the trumpet. As the genre evolved over time, it continued to have associations with political movements and organizations, such as the Algerian Freedom Fighters who rallied against the French occupation. Even after Algeria achieved independence in 1962, Rai continued to have an adverse relationship with the Algerian government, which exerted a tight grip upon its culture. In fact, Raï had been banned from broadcast media, though it thrived in underground spaces, such as cabarets. It was forbidden to the point of one popular singer, Cheb Hasni, being assassinated. However, since the government lifted its restrictions on rai in the 1980s, it has enjoyed some considerable success.

The song &quot;Parisien Du Nord&quot; by Cheb Mami is a recent example of how the genre has been used as a form of protest, as the song was written as a protest against the racial tensions that sparked the 2005 French riots. According to Memi: It is a song against racism, so I wanted to sing it with a North African who was born in France... Because of that and because of his talent, I chose K-Mel. In the song, we say, &#x27;In your eyes, I feel like foreigner.&#x27; It&#x27;s like the kids who were born in France but they have Arab faces. They are French, and they should be considered French.&quot;Rai continues to be regarded, as Al-Neen states, &quot;[the] music of rebellion and the symbol of cynicism. Rai has emerged as an outlet for voicing the frustrations of youths and placing greater emphasis on freedom and liberty.&quot;

=== Egypt ===
Ahmed Fouad Negm is considered a key dissident figure whose poetry in colloquial Arabic gave voice to the underclass in Egypt, and inspired protesters. He teamed up in the 1960s with composer Sheikh Imam Eissa who gave music to his verses, the partnership lasting for twenty years. Lines from Negm&#x27;s poem &quot;Who Are They, and Who Are We?&quot; were chanted at Tahrir Square in 2011 during protests against President Hosni Mubarak.

Music played a key role in mobilizing the 2011 protests at Tahrir Square against President Hosni Mubarak which led to the Egyptian revolution. &quot;Ezzay,&quot; meaning &quot;How come?&quot; by Egyptian singer and actor Mohamed Mounir is considered one of the most popular songs associated with the protests. &quot;Irhal,&quot; meaning &quot;Leave&quot;, by Ramy Essam became an internet hit, and was subsequently described in the media as having become an anthem for the revolution.

=== South Africa ===
==== Anti-apartheid ====
The majority of South African protest music of the 20th century concerned itself with apartheid, a system of legalized racial segregation in which blacks were stripped of their citizenship and rights from 1948 to 1994. As the apartheid regime forced Africans into townships and industrial centres, people sang about leaving their homes, the horror of the coal mines and the degradation of working as domestic servants. Examples of which include Benedict Wallet Vilakazi&#x27;s &quot;Meadowlands&quot;, the &quot;Toyi-toyi&quot; chant and &quot;Bring Him Back Home&quot; (1987) by Hugh Masekela, which became an anthem for the movement to free Nelson Mandela. The Special AKA wrote a song on Nelson Mandela called &quot;Free Nelson Mandela&quot;. The track is upbeat and celebratory, drawing on musical influence from South Africa, was immensely popular in Africa. Masekela&#x27;s song &quot;Soweto Blues&quot;, sung by his former wife, Miriam Makeba, is a blues/jazz piece that mourns the carnage of the Soweto riots in 1976. Basil Coetzee and Abdullah Ibrahim&#x27;s &quot;Mannenberg&quot; became an unofficial soundtrack to the anti-apartheid resistance.

In Afrikaans, the 1989 Voëlvry movement led by Johannes Kerkorrel, Koos Kombuis, and Bernoldus Niemand, provided a voice of opposition from within the white Afrikaner community. These musicians sought to redefine Afrikaner identity, and although met with opposition from the authorities, Voëlvry played to large crowds at Afrikaans university campuses and was quite popular among Afrikaner youth.

====Post-apartheid====

Following apartheid&#x27;s demise, most Afrikaans writers and musicians followed public sentiments by embracing the new South Africa, but cracks soon emerged in the dream of the &quot;rainbow nation&quot; and criticism started to emerge, criticism that has grown in frequency and intensity in recent years. Violent crime put South Africa in the top category of most dangerous country in the world, along with poverty, government corruption, and the AIDS pandemic. For this reason, writers and musicians in which some of them veterans of anti-apartheid movements, are once again protesting against what they consider to be a government failing to uphold the promise of &#x27;peace, democracy and freedom for all&#x27; that Nelson Mandela made upon his release from prison. By 2000, Johannes Kerkorrel claimed in the song &quot;Die stad bloei vanaand&quot; [The city bleeds tonight]: &quot;the dream was promised, but just another lie has been sold.&quot;

Two Afrikaans compilation albums of predominantly protest music were released recently: &quot;Genoeg is genoeg&quot; [&quot;Enough is enough&quot;] (2007) and &quot;Vaderland&quot; [&quot;Fatherland&quot;] (2008), and Koos Kombuis also released a CD called &quot;Bloedrivier&quot; [&quot;Blood River&quot;] (2008), which is primarily a protest album. One track, &quot;Waar is Mandela&quot; [&quot;Where is Mandela&quot;] asks, &quot;Where is Mandela when the shadows descend ... Where is the rainbow, where is the glory?&quot; and another, &quot;Die fokkol&quot; song [&quot;The Nothing&quot;] song, tells tourists who visit South Africa for the 2010 Football World Cup that there is nothing in South Africa; no jobs, no petrol, no electric power, not even jokes. However, these compilations only represent the tip of the iceberg, as many prominent musicians have included protest songs on recent albums, including Bok van Blerk, Fokofpolisiekar, and KOBUS!.

The reality of the New South Africa is decidedly violent and crime is a well-known theme in post-apartheid Afrikaans protest music. The punk group Fokofpolisiekar (which translates to &quot;fuck off police car&quot;) sings in &quot;Brand Suid-Afrika&quot; [Burn South Africa]: &quot;For you knives lie in wait, in the garden outside you house,&quot; and Radio Suid-Afrika sings in &quot;Bid&quot; [Pray]: &quot;Pray that no-one will be waiting in the garden, pray for strength and for mercy in each dark day.&quot; Theirs is a country of &quot;murder and child rape&quot; where the only respite is alcohol abuse. In &quot;Blaas hom&quot; [Blow him away] by the industrial band Battery9, the narrator sings how he gleefully unloads his gun on a burglar after being robbed for the third time, and in &quot;Siek bliksems&quot; [Sick bastards] Kristoe Strauss asks God to help against the &quot;sick bastards&quot; responsible for hijackings. The metal band KOBUS! pleads for a reinstatement of the death penalty in &quot;Doodstraf&quot;, because they feel the promise of peace has not been realized. In &quot;Reconciliation Day&quot;, Koos Kombuis sings: &quot;Our streets run with blood, every day a funeral procession, they steal all our goods, on Reconciliation Day.&quot; Elsewhere he states, &quot;we&#x27;re in a state of war.&quot; The video of this song features a lawless microcosm of theft, rape and abuse – a lawlessness reflected in Valiant Swart&#x27;s &quot;Sodom en Gomorra&quot;: &quot;two cities in the north, without laws, without order, too wonderful for words.&quot; Hanru Niemand rewrites the traditional Afrikaans song Sarie Marais, turning it into a murder ballad speculating on where Sarie&#x27;s body will be found. The new protest musicians also parody Voëlvry&#x27;s music: Johannes Kerkorrel&#x27;s &quot;Sit dit af&quot; [Switch it off] – a satire on P. W. Botha of the apartheid regime – is turned into &quot;Sit dit aan&quot; [Switch it on] by Koos Kombuis, now a song protesting mismanagement resulting in chronic power failures.

Much of the protest by Afrikaans musicians concerns the legacy of apartheid: In &quot;Blameer dit op apartheid&quot; [Blame it on apartheid] Koos Kombuis sings how &quot;the whole country is evil,&quot; yet the situation is blamed on apartheid. Klopjag, in &quot;Ek sal nie langer&quot; [I will no longer] sings that they will no longer apologize for apartheid, a theme echoed by many others, including Koos Kombuis in &quot;Hoe lank moet ons nog sorry sê&quot; [For how long do we still have to say sorry]. Piet Paraat sings in &quot;Toema Jacob Zuma&quot; [Never mind Jacob Zuma]: &quot;My whole life I&#x27;m punished for the sins of my father.&quot; There is also a distinct feeling that the Afrikaner is being marginalized by the ANC government: Fokofpolisiekar sings in &quot;Antibiotika&quot; [Antibiotics], &quot;I&#x27;m just a tourist in the country of my birth,&quot; Bok van Blerk sings in &quot;Die kleur van my vel&quot; [The colour of my skin] that the country does not want him despite his willingness to work, because he is white, even though white South Africans have the lowest rate of unemployment, and in &quot;Bloekomboom&quot; Rian Malan uses the metaphor of a blue gum tree (an alien species) to plead that Afrikaners should not be regarded as settlers, but as part of the nation. Steve Hofmeyr has incorrectly expressed concern about the statistically high murders of Afrikaner farmers, and has also appealed in several speeches to remember Afrikaner heritage. His songs &quot;Ons Sal Dit Oorleef&quot; (We will survive this) and &quot;My Kreed&quot; (My Cry) also echoes many Afrikaners&#x27; fears of losing their culture and rights. The appeals by these musicians, and several others, to be included follows a sense of exclusion manifested in the political, linguistic and economic realms, an exclusion depicted particularly vividly by Bok van Blerk&#x27;s &quot;Kaplyn&quot; [Cut line], a song that laments that fallen South African soldiers have been omitted in one of the country&#x27;s show-case memorials, the Freedom Park Memorial, despite official claims of it being a memorial for all who had fought for the country.

===Tunisia===
Emel Mathlouthi composed songs since a young age which called for freedom and dignity in a Tunisia ruled by the dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, earning her scrutiny from internal security forces and forcing her to retreat to Paris. Banned from the official airwaves, her protest songs found listeners on social media. In late 2010 and early 2011, Tunisian protesters referred to her song Kelmti Horra (my word is free) as an anthem of the Tunisian Revolution.

== Asia ==

===China===
Chinese-Korean Cui Jian&#x27;s 1986 song &quot;Nothing to My Name&quot; was popular with protesters in Tiananmen Square.

Chinese singer Li Zhi made references to the Tiananmen Square massacre in his songs and were subsequently banned from China in 2019. Three years later, during the anti-lockdown protests in China, this was used as a protest song across YouTube.

===Hong Kong===
Hong Kong rock band Beyond&#x27;s &quot;Boundless Oceans Vast Skies&quot; (1993) and &quot;Glory Days&quot; (光輝歲月) (1990) have been considered as protest anthems in various social movements.

During the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests, Les Misérables&#x27; &quot;Do You Hear The People Sing&quot; (1980) and Thomas dgx yhl&#x27;s &quot;Glory to Hong Kong&quot; (2019) were sung in support of the movement. The latter has been widely adopted as the anthem of these protests, with some even regarding it as the &quot;national anthem of Hong Kong&quot;.

===India===
Cultural activism in India has always been considered one of the most effective tools to mobilise people into making a social change since pre-independence times. India provided many examples of protest songs throughout its struggle for freedom from Britain.

Indian rapper Raftaar&#x27;s &quot;Mantoiyat&quot; lashes out at corrupt politicians and police and brings to light injustices that plague the country. In the song he talks about deep rooted issues and brings light to the hypocrisy of the people and the government. Artists such as Poojan Sahil, Seedhe Maut, Vishkyun, Prabh Deep, Rapper Shaz, Sumit Roy &amp; Ahmer usually talk about social issues in their songs. The rock fusion band Indian Ocean&#x27;s song &quot;Chitu&quot; was one of their first and prominent songs, a tribal anthem that Ram had come across over the course of being involved in the Narmada Movement.

In 2019, India&#x27;s citizenship Law led to a mass protest all over the country. Artists like Varun Grover, Poojan Sahil, Rapper Shaz &amp; Madara joined the cause with their own sonic protest.

In more contemporary times, protest music has been a regular feature of movements in India. The Dalit rights movement especially uses music to further its goals. The Kabir Kala Manch is one such well known troupe of singers who used their performances to raise awareness and support for their cause. The widely acclaimed documentary film, Jai Bhim Comrade, highlighted the work of Kabir Kala Manch and presented this form of protest music to both Indian as well as international audiences. Similar, albeit less known, Dalit musical groups exist in various parts of India.

The leftist movements of India too use protest music along with street plays as a means to propagate their message amongst the masses. Protest music was a big feature of plays organized by the Indian People&#x27;s Theatre Association (IPTA). Similar organisations formed after the break-up of IPTA and highly influenced by its work, like the Jana Natya Manch (JANAM), also made protest music a regular feature of their plays. In recent decades, however, the Left&#x27;s cultural activism has increasingly been relegated to the margins of the cultural sphere. Some attribute this to the political decline of the mainstream Left in India, as well as a shift in focus to local movements and languages as identity politics took a greater hold of Indian Polity.

Protest music also features regularly in protests held by other mainstream national parties of India.

=== Iran ===


Fereydoun Farokhzad&#x27;s &quot;Sad Eastern&quot;—which its title is referring to Iranian people—is considered as one of the first Iranian protest songs. Due to the free speech limitations at the time of the song was first sang (1969 or 1970), it is a light protest song talking about &quot;freedom&quot; and &quot;not giving up of our land&quot; Iran.

Since it is illegal to criticize the government and social issues in Iran after the 1979 Iranian Revolution, most of the Iranian artists who make protest songs live abroad. Protest songs in Iran have a long history due to the long history of Human rights violations by the Islamic Republic of Iran.

One of the most important protest songs of Iran is Hichkas&#x27;s &quot;A Good Day Will Come&quot; which is often considered as the most influential Iranian protest song. &quot;A Good Day Will Come&quot; was released a year after the 2009 Iranian presidential election protests, one of the most violent protests in Iran.

&quot;Iran Iran&quot; which is the debut single of rapper Fadaei, was also released a year after the 2009 Iranian presidential election protests mentioning the killing of Neda Agha-Soltan and the 2009 Kahrizak Detention Center disaster.

After the death of over 1500 protesters in the 2019–2020 Iranian protests —which is best known as &quot;Bloody November&quot; due to its massive brutality— Iranian artists who live abroad released many protest songs include Hichkas&#x27;s &quot;Clenched His Fists&quot; —which was released one month after the start of the protests— and &quot;Hit&quot;, Fadaei&#x27;s &quot;Overthrow&quot; (also mentions 2021 Sistan and Baluchestan protests) and &quot;From Karaj to Langerud&quot; (Inspired by the ). As of now, &quot;Bloody November&quot; has been mentioned many times in protest songs.

After the death of Mahsa Amini on September 16, 2022, who was arrested for alleged wearing her Hijab improperly and later died after she had been —according to eyewitnesses— severely beaten by religious morality police officers, a massive global protests sparked all around the world and many Iranian artists released protest songs. Among all of the songs, Shervin Hajipour&#x27;s &quot;For&quot; —which was released twelve days after Amini&#x27;s death— became an instant hit and immediately turned into the unofficial &quot;anthem&quot; of the uprising. It was widely used during gatherings, from schools and universities to streets, both nationwide and across the globe. It was broadly circulated in social media and foreign TV channels and radio stations as well. The song also served as the backdrop for several other forms of art such as video works, graphic design and performance art. On November 11, 2022, Roxana Saberi reported the song as &quot;the most viral tune to ever come out of Iran&quot;. Since its release, &quot;For&quot; has become the single most covered protest song in Iran&#x27;s history. Hajipour was later arrested for the song and released on bail five days later, banned from any musical activity.

Other Iranian notable protest songs which were released during Mahsa Amini protests includes Mehdi Yarrahi&#x27;s &quot;Woman&#x27;s Anthem&quot;, &quot;Life&#x27;s Anthem&quot; and &quot;Cage is Enough&quot;, Hichkas&#x27;s &quot;This One Is Also For&quot;, Fadaei&#x27;s heavy political theme album &quot;&quot;Righ&quot;t&quot; —which includes &quot;Tawaf&quot; and &quot;Blood&quot; protest songs— and &quot;Conquer&quot; (Inspired by the execution of Majidreza Rahnavard), Shapur&#x27;s &quot;Death to the Whole System&quot;, Toomaj Salehi&#x27;s &quot;Battleground&quot; and &quot;Omen&quot;, Ethnic Musician&#x27;s &quot;Freedom&#x27;s Anthem&quot;, Koorosh and Sami Low&#x27;s &quot;Us&quot;, Shahin Najafi&#x27;s &quot;Gen Z&quot; and &quot;The Morning of Revenge&quot;.

Majid Entezami&#x27;s &quot;Khorramshahr Symphony&quot; —which was re-released on October 13, 2022, and its title is referring to Khorramshahr&#x27;s 1980 and 1982 battles— was also used multiple times on protest videos including women cutting their hair and calls for protests.

Many artists have been arrested in Iran after releasing protest songs following the 2022 Mahsa Amini protests includes Shervin Hajipour, Mona Borzouei (Lyricist of Mehdi Yarrahi&#x27;s &quot;Woman&#x27;s Anthem&quot;) and Toomaj Salehi. Salehi was arrested on October 30, 2022, for his social awareness activities on his social media and releasing the two protest songs &quot;Battleground&quot; and &quot;Omen&quot; during the Mahsa Amini protests. On November 27, 2022, Iranian media revealed that Salehi was charged with &quot;corruption on Earth&quot;, an offense which could carry the death penalty.

In March 2023, rapper Fadaei released another protest song associated with the 2022–2023 Iranian protests titled &quot;Black&quot;. The song was very controversial due to its Maddahi singing style mixed with pop music. It also contains heavy protest lyrics and Chaharshanbe Suri-Muharram-Nowruz themes.

=== Israel ===

Israel&#x27;s protest music has often become associated with different political factions.

During the 1967 war, Naomi Shemer added a third verse to her song &quot;Jerusalem of Gold&quot;, sung by Shuli Natan, about the recapturing of Jerusalem after 2,000 years. Later on that year, a different point of view of the song was introduced by the folk singer Meir Ariel, who recorded an anti-war version and named it &quot;Jerusalem of Iron&quot;.

Gush Emunim supporters have taken a repertoire of old religious songs and invested them with political meaning. An example is the song &quot;Utsu Etsu VeTufar&quot; (They gave counsel but their counsel was violated). The song signifies the ultimate rightness of those steadfast in their beliefs, suggesting the rightness of Gush Emunim&#x27;s struggle against anti-settlement policy by the government.

Minutes before Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was murdered at a political rally in November 1995, Israeli folk singer Miri Aloni sang the Israeli pop song &quot;Shir Lashalom&quot; (&quot;Song for Peace&quot;). This song, originally written in 1969 and performed extensively at the time by an Israeli military performing group, has become one of the anthems of the Israeli peace camp.

During the Arab uprising known as the First Intifada, Israeli singer Si Heyman sang &quot;Yorim VeBokhim&quot; (&quot;Shoot and Weep&quot;) to protest Israeli policy in the territories. Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Another Brick in the Wall&quot; is used as a protest song by some opponents of Israel&#x27;s barrier in the West Bank. The lyrics were adapted to: &quot;We don&#x27;t need no occupation. We don&#x27;t need no racist wall.&quot;

Since the onset of the Oslo Process and, more recently, Israel&#x27;s unilateral disengagement plan, protest songs became a major avenue for opposition activists to express sentiments. Songs protesting these policies were written and performed by Israeli musicians such as Ariel Zilber, Aharon Razel, and others.

=== Malaysia ===
=== Myanmar ===
During the 8888 Uprising, Burmese composer Naing Myanmar penned &quot;Kabar Makyay Bu&quot; (ကမ္ဘာမကျေဘူး), rendered in English as &quot;We Won&#x27;t Be Satisfied till the End of the World&quot; as a protest song. Set to the tune of Kansas&#x27; &quot;Dust in the Wind&quot;, the song quickly gained popularity across the country, as an emotional appeal for freedom. The song was recorded and distributed on cassette tapes, reaching millions of Burmese eventually becoming an anthem of the 8888 Uprising.

In the aftermath of the 2021 Myanmar coup d&#x27;etat, the country&#x27;s nascent civil disobedience movement has revitalized this song, performing it during protests and acts of civil disobedience.

===Palestine===
Palestinian music () deals with the conflict with Israel, the longing for peace, and the love of the Palestinians&#x27; land. A typical example of such a song is &quot;Biladi, Biladi&quot; (My Country, My Country), which has become the unofficial Palestinian national anthem. Additionally, there are very few Palestinian peace songs that do not indict Israel, and outwardly militaristic. Certain commentators have compared this with the general unwillingness of Palestinians to speak about internal problems, as they tend to be taboo in Palestinian society, and dissent is outlawed in Gaza, under Hamas control.

Another example is the song &quot;Al-Quds (Jerusalem) our Land&quot;, with words by Sharif Sabri. The song, sung by Amr Diab from Port Said, Egypt, won first prize in 2003 in a contest in Egypt for video clips produced in the West Bank and Gaza. DAM is an Arabic hip-hop group, rapping in Arabic and Hebrew about the problems faced by Palestinians under occupation and calling for change. Kamilya Jubran&#x27;s song &quot;Ghareeba&quot;, a setting of a poem by Khalil Gibran, deals with a sense of isolation and loneliness felt by the Palestinian woman.

=== Pakistan ===
Protest music in Pakistan has been deeply inspired by South Asian traditions since pre-independence times.

The song &quot;Hum Dekhenge&quot; is just one example of protest music from Pakistan. Faiz Ahmed, a poet and a prominent Pakistani Marxist, originally penned the poem with the same title as a response to General Zia ul Haq&#x27;s repressive dictatorship. The poem is considered a critical commentary of Zia&#x27;s brand of authoritarian Islam. His political beliefs set him up as a natural critic of General Zia Ul Haq. In 1985, as part of Zia&#x27;s programme of forced Islamicization, the sari, part of the traditional attire for women on the subcontinent was banned. That year, Iqbal Bano, one of Pakistan&#x27;s best-loved singers and artists, sang Hum Dekhenge to an audience of 50,000 people in a Lahore stadium wearing a black sari. The recording was smuggled out and distributed on bootleg cassette tapes across the country. Cries of &quot;Inquilab Zindabad&quot; (&quot;Long Live Revolution&quot;) and thunderous applause from the audience can be heard on the . Faiz was in prison at the time.

The song has, since the fall of the Zia dictatorship, regularly featured in protests in Pakistan. More recently, a newer rendition of the song by Pakistani singer, Rahat Fateh Ali Khan, was used as the title song for the political party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, in the 2013 Pakistani general election, and in the Azadi march of 2014.

The international anthem &quot;girti hui deewaron ko aik dhakka aur do&quot; by famous poet Ali Arshad Mir created in the 1970s found profound place in various protests. This revolutionary anthem is still in use in resistance movements against oppressive political regimes and failing institutions by politicians and common people alike.

=== Philippines ===
From the revolutionary songs of the Katipunan to the songs being sung by the New People&#x27;s Army, Filipino protest music deals with poverty, oppression as well as anti-imperialism and independence. A typical example was during the American era, as Jose Corazon de Jesus created a well-known protest song entitled &quot;Bayan Ko&quot;, which calls for redeeming the nation against oppression, mainly colonialism, and also became popular as a song against the Marcos regime.

During the 1960s, Filipino protest music became aligned with the ideas of Communism as well as of revolution. The protest song &quot;&quot;Ang Linyang Masa&quot; came from Mao Zedong and his Mass Line and &quot;Papuri sa Pag-aaral&quot;&quot; was from Bertolt Brecht. These songs, although Filipinized, rose to become another part of Filipino protest music known as Revolutionary songs that became popular during protests and campaign struggles.

===South Korea===
Commonly, protest songs in South Korea are known as &quot;Minjung Gayo&quot; (, literally &quot;People&#x27;s song&quot;), and the genre of protest songs is called &quot;Norae Undong&quot;, translating to the literal meaning &quot;song movement&quot;. The starting point of Korean protest songs was the music culture of Korean students movements around 1970. It was common in the 1970s~1980s, especially before and after of the June Democracy Movement in 1987, and associated with against the military governments of presidents Park Chung Hee and Chun Doo Hwan reflecting the will of crowd and voices of criticism of the day. From the middle of the 1990s, following the democratization of South Korea, Korean protest songs have lost their popularity. There has been a resurgence of protest songs due to the 2024 South Korean martial law crisis.

===Taiwan===
&quot;Island&#x27;s Sunrise&quot; (Chinese: 島嶼天光) is the theme song of 2014 Sunflower Student Movement in Taiwan. Also, the theme song of Lan Ling Wang TV drama series &quot;Into The Array Song&quot; (Chinese: 入陣曲), sung by Mayday, expressed all the social and political controversies during Taiwan under the president Ma Ying-jeou administration.

=== Thailand ===

In Thailand, protest songs are known as &quot;Phleng phuea chiwit&quot; (, ; lit. &quot;songs for life&quot;), a music genre that originated in the &#x27;70s, by famous artists such as Caravan, Carabao, Pongthep Kradonchamnan and Pongsit Kamphee.

=== Turkey ===
The roots of the rebellious/protest music in Anatolia goes back to the 16th century. Asiks who lived in that era, like Pir Sultan Abdal, Koroglu and Dadaloglu who lived in the 18th century are still the inspirations. The tradition of rebellion have gone for centuries and have given many song to this geography&#x27;s culture. The message in Turkish protest music has been against inequality, lack of freedom, poverty, and the freedom of expression. Milder elements in this style are referred to as progressive, while some die-hard protest musicians have been prosecuted, and sometimes persecuted, in the 20th century Turkey. More than a few Turkish singers have been forced to exile, most notably Cem Karaca, who later returned to Turkey during freer conditions and atmosphere. Typically, protest music bands are leftist bands with a huge following, especially in high schools and universities. The music is a crossover between folk and rock and the lyrics are about freedom, repression and uprising, capitalism and the oppressed, and the revolution that never comes. It&#x27;s customary to say anti-American slogans here and there. The male singers always have what is called a Davidian voice (meaning deep and husky a la Barry White) and the females usually sing nasally with a high pitch.

== Europe ==

=== Belarus ===
The first famous Belarusian protest songs were created at the beginning of the 20th century during the rise of the Belarusian People&#x27;s Republic and war for independence from the Russian Empire and Soviet Russia. This period includes such protest songs as &quot;Advieku My Spali&quot; (&quot;We&#x27;ve slept enough&quot;, also known as Belarusian Marselliese) and &quot;Vajaćki Marš&quot; (&quot;March of the Warriors&quot;), which was an anthem of the Belarusian People&#x27;s Republic. The next period of protest songs was in the 1990s, with many created by such bands as NRM, Novaje Nieba and others, which led to the unspoken prohibition of these musicians. As an example, Lavon Volski, frontman of NRM, Mroja and Krambambulia, had issues with officials at the majority of his concert due to the criticism of the Belarusian political system. One of the most famous bands of Belarus, Lyapis Trubetskoy, was forbidden from performing in the country due to being critical of Aleksandr Lukashenka in his lyrics. These prohibitions lead most &quot;forbidden&quot; bands to organize concerts in Vilnius, which, though situated in modern Lithuania, is considered to be a Belarusian historical capital because less than a hundred years ago most dwellers of Vilnius (Vilnia, as it was called before it was given to Lithuania) were Belarusians. But in the middle of the 2010s, the situation began to change a bit and many protest bands started to organize concerts in Belarus.

=== Estonia ===
Many of the songs performed at the Estonian Laulupidu are protest songs, particularly those written during the Singing Revolution. Due to the official position of the Soviet Union at the time, the lyrics are frequently allusive, rather than explicitly anti-Soviet, such as Tõnis Mägi&#x27;s song &quot;Koit&quot;. In contrast, &quot;Eestlane olen ja eestlaseks jään&quot;, sung by Ivo Linna and the group In Spe is explicitly in favour of an Estonian identity.

===Finland===
Finland has a tradition of socialist and communist protest songs going back to the Finnish Civil War, most of which were imported and translated from Soviet Russia. In the 21st century the socialist protest song tradition is somewhat continued by left wing rap artists and to lesser degree in more traditional Taistoist form by KOM-theatre choir.

===France===
&quot;The Internationale&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;Internationale&quot; in French) is a socialist, anarchist, communist, and social-democratic anthem.

&quot;The Internationale&quot; became the anthem of international socialism. Its original French refrain is &quot;C&#x27;est la lutte finale/ Groupons-nous et demain/ L&#x27;Internationale/ Sera le genre humain.&quot; (Freely translated: &quot;This is the final struggle/ Let us join together and tomorrow/ The Internationale/ Will be the human race.&quot;) The &quot;Internationale&quot; has been translated into most of the world&#x27;s languages. Traditionally it is sung with the hand raised in a clenched fist salute. &quot;The Internationale&quot; is sung not only by communists but also (in many countries) by socialists or social democrats. The Chinese version was also a rallying song of the students and workers at the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989.

There is not so much a protest song trend in France, but rather of a permanent background of criticism and contestation, and individuals who personify it. World War II and its horrors forced French singers to think more critically about war in general, forcing them to question their governments and the powers who ruled their society.

Jazz trumpeter and singer Boris Vian&#x27;s was one of the first to protest against the Algerian war with his anti-war song &quot;Le déserteur&quot; (The deserter), which was banned by the government.

Several French songwriters, such as Léo Ferré (1916–1993), Georges Brassens (1921–1981), Jacques Brel (1929–1978) (actually a Belgian singer), Maxime Le Forestier (born 1949) or interpreters (Yves Montand, Marcel Mouloudji, Serge Reggiani, Graeme Allwright ...) often wrote or sang songs aligned against majority ideas and political powers. Because racial tensions did not rise to the same levels as those in the United States, criticism was focused more toward bourgeoisie, power, religion, and songs defending liberty of thought, speech and action. After 1945, immigration became a source of inspiration for some singers: Pierre Perret (born 1934), well known for his humorous songs, started writing several more &quot;serious&quot; and committed songs against racism (&quot;Lily&quot;, 1977), which critically pointed out everyday racist behaviour in French society.

Brassens wrote several songs protesting war, hate, intolerance (&quot;Les Deux Oncles&quot; [&quot;The Two Uncles&quot;], &quot;La Guerre de 14–18&quot; [&quot;14–18 War&quot;], &quot;Mourir pour des idées&quot; [&quot;To Die for Ideas&quot;] &quot;Les Patriotes&quot; [&quot;The Patriots&quot;] ...), against chauvinism (&quot;La Ballade des gens qui sont nés quelque part&quot; [&quot;Ballad of People Who Are Born Somewhere&quot;]), against bourgeoisie (&quot;La Mauvaise Réputation&quot; [&quot;The bad reputation&quot;], &quot;Les Philistins&quot; [&quot;The Philistines&quot;] ...). He was often called &quot;anarchist&quot; because of his songs on representatives of law and order (and religion) (&quot;Le Gorille&quot; [&quot;The gorilla&quot;] &quot;Hécatombe&quot; [&quot;Slaughter&quot;] &quot;Le Nombril des femmes d&#x27;agents&quot; [&quot;The navel of cops wives&quot;], &quot;Le Mécréant&quot; [&quot;The miscreant&quot;] ...).

Ferré was also called an &quot;anarchist&quot;. He sang against consumerism (&quot;Vitrines&quot; [&quot;Shop Fronts&quot;], &quot;Chanson mécanisée&quot; [&quot;Mechanized Song&quot;], &quot;Il n&#x27;y a plus rien&quot; [&quot;There is nothing left&quot;] ...), against French war (&quot;Miss guéguerre&quot; [&quot;Miss Squabble&quot;], &quot;Pacific blues&quot;, &quot;Regardez-les&quot; [&quot;Look at them&quot;], &quot;Mon général&quot; [&quot;My general&quot;], &quot;Les Temps difficiles&quot; [&quot;Hard Times&quot;], &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;), death penalty (&quot;Ni Dieu ni maître&quot; [&quot;No God no Master&quot;], &quot;La Mort des loups&quot; [&quot;The Death of the Wolves&quot;]), Estate control (&quot;La Gueuse&quot;, &quot;La Complainte de la télé&quot; [&quot;Lament of TV&quot;], &quot;La Révolution&quot; [&quot;Revolution&quot;], &quot;Le Conditionnel de variétés&quot; [&quot;Middle of the road music conditional mood&quot;]), illusion of representative democracy (&quot;Ils ont voté&quot; [&quot;They voted&quot;], &quot;La Grève&quot; [&quot;Strike&quot;]), dictatorships (&quot;Franco la muerte&quot;, &quot;Allende&quot;, &quot;La Violence et l&#x27;Ennui&quot; [&quot;Words ... Words ... Words ... &quot;]), sexual hypocrisy and freedom (&quot;Le Chien&quot; [&quot;The Dog&quot;], &quot;Le Mal&quot; [&quot;Evil&quot;], &quot;Ton style&quot; [&quot;Your style&quot;], &quot;La Damnation&quot; [&quot;Damnation&quot;] ...).

Brel&#x27;s work is another ode to freedom (&quot;Ces gens-là&quot; [&quot;These people&quot;], &quot;Les Bourgeois&quot; [&quot;The Bourgeois&quot;], &quot;Jaurès&quot;, &quot;Les Bigotes&quot; [&quot;The bigots&quot;], &quot;Le Colonel&quot; [&quot;The colonel&quot;], &quot;Le Caporal Casse-Pompon&quot; [&quot;Corporal Break-Nots&quot;]).

===Germany===
Ton Steine Scherben, one of the first and most influential German language rock bands of the 1970s and early 1980s, were well known for the highly political lyrics of vocalist Rio Reiser. The band became a musical mouthpiece of new left movements, such as the squatting movement, during that time in Germany and their hometown of West Berlin in particular. Their lyrics were, at the beginning, anti-capitalist and anarchist, and the band had connections to members of the German Red Army Faction movement before they became illegal. Later songs were about more complex issues such as unemployment (&quot;Mole Hill Rockers&quot;) or homosexuality (&quot;Mama war so&quot;). They also contributed to plays and two full-length concept albums about homosexuality by the Hamburg theatre group Brühwarm (literally: boiling warm).

A dissatisfied German youth in the late 1970s and early 1980s resulted in a strand of highly politicized German-language Punkrock (&quot;Deutschpunk&quot;), which mostly concerned itself with politically radical left-wing lyrics, mostly influenced by the Cold War. Probably the most important German-language punk band was Slime from Hamburg, who were the first band whose LP was banned because of political topics. Their songs &quot;Deutschland&quot; (&quot;Germany&quot;), &quot;Bullenschweine&quot;, &quot;Polizei SA/SS&quot;, and the anti-imperialist &quot;Yankees raus&quot; (&quot;Yankees out&quot;) were banned, some of them are still banned today, because they propagated the use of violence against the police or compared the police to the SA and SS of Nazi Germany.

The Cologne-based rock group BAP is known for their committed and intelligently written lyrics, dealing with discrimination and the power games of Germany&#x27;s political elites in many of their songs. The song &quot;Kristallnaach&quot; (1982) is a point in case. It analyses the corruptibility of the present-day masses for new forms of fascism, while referring to the &quot;Night of Broken Glass&quot; that took place in 1938.

In East Germany, protesting against the state was often prohibited. Despite this, the song Ermutigung by Wolf Biermann became a widely popular protest song against the SED government.

=== Ireland ===

==== Irish rebel songs ====
Irish rebel music is a subgenre of Irish folk music, played on typically Irish instruments (such as the Fiddle, tin whistle, Uilleann pipes, accordion, bodhrán etc.) and acoustic guitars. The lyrics deal with the fight for Irish independence, people who were involved in liberation movements, the persecution and violence during Northern Ireland&#x27;s Troubles and the history of Ireland&#x27;s numerous rebellions.

Among the many examples of the genre, some of the most famous are &quot;A Nation Once Again&quot;, &quot;Come out Ye Black and Tans&quot;, &quot;Erin go Bragh&quot;, &quot;The Fields of Athenry&quot;, &quot;The Men Behind the Wire&quot; and the Republic of Ireland&#x27;s national anthem &quot;Amhrán na bhFiann&quot; (&quot;The Soldier&#x27;s Song&quot;). Music of this genre has often courted controversy, and some of the more outwardly anti-British songs have been effectively banned from the airwaves in both England and the Republic of Ireland.

Paul McCartney also made a contribution to the genre with his 1972 single &quot;Give Ireland Back to the Irish&quot;, which he wrote as a reaction to Bloody Sunday in Northern Ireland on January 30, 1972. The song also faced an all-out ban in the UK, and has never been re-released or appeared on any Paul McCartney or Wings best-ofs. The same year McCartney&#x27;s former colleague John Lennon released two protest songs concerning the hardships of war-torn Northern Ireland: &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot;, written shortly after the 1972 massacre of Irish civil rights activists (which differs from U2&#x27;s 1983 song of the same title in that it directly supports the Irish Republican cause and does not call for peace), and &quot;The Luck of the Irish&quot;, both from his album &quot;Some Time in New York City&quot; (1972).

The Wolfe Tones have become legendary in Ireland for their contribution to the Irish rebel genre. The band has been recording since 1963 and has attracted worldwide fame and attention through their renditions of traditional Irish songs and originals, dealing with the former conflict in Northern Ireland. In 2002 the Wolfe Tones&#x27; version of &quot;A Nation Once Again&quot;, a nationalist song from the 19th century, was voted the greatest song in the world in a poll conducted by the BBC World Service.

An Irish alternative rock/post punk band from Dublin, U2 broke with the rebel musical tradition when in 1983 they wrote their song &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot;. The song makes reference to two separate massacres in Irish history of civilians by British forces – Bloody Sunday (1920) and Bloody Sunday 1972 – however, unlike other songs dealing with those events, the lyrics call for peace as opposed to revenge.

The Cranberries&#x27; hit &quot;Zombie&quot;, written during their English tour in 1993, is in memory of two boys, Jonathan Ball and Tim Parry, who were killed in an IRA bombing in Warrington.

===Netherlands===
In 1626 the Dutch national anthem “Wilhelmus” was composed, it was a song in support of Willem van Oranje who lead the Dutch against the Spaniards in the Eighty Years War.

In 1966 Boudewijn de Groot released &quot;Welterusten meneer de president&quot; (&quot;Good night mister president&quot;), a song about the Vietnam War. The song spent 12 weeks in the Dutch Top 40 and to this day it remains an important song in nederpop and among Dutch protest songs. Following &quot;Welterusten meneer de president&quot;, Boudewijn de Groot and Lennaert Nijgh, a Dutch lyricist, made more protest songs. The couple inspired other Dutch musicians, namely Armand and Robert Long. &#x27;Tweede Kamer&#x27; by Sophie Straat and Goldband is a ska protest song against the lack of female leadership in the Netherlands, urging Dutch voters to &#x27;vote for a woman&#x27;.

===Portugal===
The protest songs in Portugal were mostly associated with the antifascist movement and developed chiefly among students and activists. The best known are songs by Paulo de Carvalho and José Afonso, respectively &quot;E Depois do Adeus&quot; (And After the Goodbye) and &quot;Grândola Vila Morena&quot;(Grândola Swarthy Town). They were chosen as a code to start the Carnation Revolution that would successfully triumph against the dictatorial regime. The first was written out of letters that the author, then fighting to maintain the colonies (a war that the general public was against) sent to his wife. Hence the title refers to his departure &quot;goodbye&quot; to the war. The other song was very explicit regarding his objective: &quot;O Povo é quem mais ordena / dentro de ti oh cidade&quot; (The people is the one who orders the most/ inside of you oh city). &quot;E Depois do Adeus&quot; was vague enough to elude the censorship and pass as an &quot;end of love&quot; song, which also accounts for the order of the broadcast.

Of the two, Zeca Afonso was more prolific and more identified with the movement, so much so that another of his songs was the first choice for the code &quot;Venham mais 5&quot; (Let 5 more come). Other artists also used some craft to hide their meanings in the song or went into exile. One example is Adriano Correia de Oliveira that masked the explicit lyrics with the vocal tone making it difficult to distinguish the critical verse, from the refrain or even other verses. In no other song is this more noted that the ballad &quot;Trova do Vento que Passa&quot; (Song/Poem of the Passing Wind), whose lyrics by the writer Manuel Alegre were a direct criticism of the state. The music was by António Portugal but Correia used a typical Fado rhythm to hide such provocative verses as &quot;Mesmo na noite mais triste/em tempo de sevidão/há sempre alguém que resiste/há sempre alguém que diz não&quot; (even in the saddest night/in time of servitude/there is always someone who stands up/there is always someone who says No).

Not only men but also women had an active participation, albeit in lesser numbers. Ermelinda Duarte, one of those women, wrote the song &quot;Somos Livres&quot; (We Are Free), for a 1972 theatre play called &quot;Lisboa 72&quot;, masking a deep meaning with catchy children&#x27;s music. Although the version of her singing the tune is the best known it was only recorded &quot;after&quot; the carnation revolution.

Many other songwriters and singers, to generate awareness, used their talents to act in all of Portugal, sometimes without pay or transport. Fausto Bordalo Dias once sang into a mike so poorly made it needed a plastic cup to work. Other singers included the priest Francisco Fanhais, the writer José Jorge Letria; Fernando Tordo; Luís Cília; Amélia Muge; Janita Salomé; Manuel Freire; José Barata-Moura; the poet Ary dos Santos; José Mário Branco, Sérgio Godinho, Carlos Alberto Moniz, Maria do Amparo and Samuel.

===Poland===
Protest songs in Poland were mostly associated with anti-communist movement and developed in the 1970s and 1980s. One of the most important artists was Jacek Kaczmarski, author of such famous songs as &quot;Mury&quot; (&quot;The Walls&quot;), &quot;Przedszkole&quot; (&quot;The Kindergarten&quot;) and &quot;Zbroja&quot; (&quot;The Armor&quot;), criticizing both the totalitarian communist government and the opposition. Another famous Polish folk singer, Jan Pietrzak, wrote one of the best-known Polish patriotic protest songs, &quot;Żeby Polska była Polską&quot; (&quot;Make Poland Polish&quot;), in which he reminded the most heroic moments of Polish history, including Kościuszko Uprising, and called people to fight the communists as they fought other enemies of Poland before. He also recorded a musical version of the Jonasz Kofta&#x27;s poem &quot;Pamiętajcie o ogrodach&quot; (&quot;Remember the Gardens&quot;), protesting against the industrialism of life promoted by the communist propaganda. Other Polish artists well known for writing protest songs include Kazimierz Staszewski and Przemysław Gintrowski.

As Rhythms of Resistance groups operated in many cities during the 2000s, rhythm predominated protests, and protesters tended not to sing. As Poland moved closer to authoritarian rule, protest song writing and performance became a staple of social movements, and singing was incorporated into street demonstrations. The song&#x27;s melodies, lyrics, and performance style all alluded to earlier social struggles and political traditions that the protest was referencing and strove to uphold.

In the second decade of the 21st century, urban movements established choirs of activists, i.e. the Warsaw Revolutionary Choir &quot;Warszawianka&quot;, the Krakow Revolutionary Choir, the TAK [Tricity Women&#x27;s Action] Choir in Gdańsk, which supported street protests. The song repertoire consisted largely of reconstructions of protest songs from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In Łódź, &quot;Warszawianka&quot; was sung en masse during the celebrations marking the 110th and 111th anniversaries of the insurrection of 1905.

In 2016, singing workshops for women were conducted during some Black Protest demonstrations. The protest song with the participation of activists showed how important they find this method of communication.

As a tribute to Piotr Szczęsny, who used public self-immolation to condemn &quot;the ruling party for the systematic violation of the law, inspiring discrimination against minorities, and deliberately destroying the country&#x27;s nature and educational system,&quot; protest songs were written in 2017. In order to convince Andrzej Duda to oppose constitutional amendments, activists later that year performed a of the Christmas carol &quot;Przybieżeli do Betlejem&quot; in the places the Polish president visited.

Many protest songs were performed in Poland in in the country&#x27;s history. Many schools, even in small towns or villages produced protest songs. Recordings of group performances were posted on social media. Numerous songs were based on tunes from the 1980s of the 20th century, specifically from the time of martial law that put an end to the &#x27;carnival of solidarity&#x27; in 1980–1981.

Many protest songs were played during the Women&#x27;s Strike demonstrations in 2020 and 2021. One was to the tune of &quot;Bella ciao&quot;. This song became a symbol of the demonstrations against the government and the Catholic church as they both tried to increase restrictions on the right to abortion.

===Russia===
The most famous source of Russian protest music in the 20th century has been those known locally as bards. The term (бард in Russian) came to be used in the Soviet Union in the early 1960s, and continues to be used in Russia today, to refer to singer-songwriters who wrote songs outside the Soviet establishment. Many of the most famous bards wrote numerous songs about war, particularly The Great Patriotic War (World War II). Bards had various reasons for writing and singing songs about war. Bulat Okudzhava, who actually fought in the war, used his sad and emotional style to illustrate the futility of war in songs such as &quot;The Paper Soldier&quot; (&quot;Бумажный Солдат&quot;).

Many political songs were written by bards under Soviet rule, and the genre varied from acutely political, &quot;anti-Soviet&quot; songs, to witty satire in the best traditions of Aesop. Some of Bulat Okudzhava&#x27;s songs provide examples of political songs written on these themes. Vladimir Vysotsky was perceived as a political songwriter, but later he gradually made his way into more mainstream culture. It was not so with Alexander Galich, who was forced to emigrate—owning a tape with his songs could mean a prison term in the USSR. Before emigration, he suffered from KGB persecution, as did another bard, Yuliy Kim. Others, like Evgeny Kliachkin and Aleksander Dolsky, maintained a balance between outright anti-Soviet and plain romantic material.
Protest rhetoric can also be traced in the works of such rock bands as Grazhdanskaya Oborona, Naive, Tarakany!, Pilot, Noize MC, Lumen and Louna. Later, during the Soviet-Afghan War in the 1980s, Kino (band) released an album, Gruppa krovi, which its main song, &quot;Blood Type&quot; (Группа Крови) is a protest song about the Soviet-Afghan War. In Grand Theft Auto IV, it was part of the soundtrack before its ten-year license expired in 2018. In 2019, twenty-nine years and a day after the group&#x27;s last performance at Luzhniki Stadium, Metallica held a concert there and sang &quot;Blood Type&quot;.

In the 21st century, the feminist punk band Pussy Riot in particular has had frequent run-ins with the Putin presidency and the Russian Orthodox Church.

===Spain===
Spain saw a brief period of protest singers in the 1970s, in the final years of Franco&#x27;s dictatorship, mainly challenging the regime&#x27;s censorship. They include some mainstream Spanish artists of the era, as Joan Manuel Serrat and Víctor Manuel, but also many others as José Antonio Labordeta, Raimon, Luis Eduardo Aute, Rosa León or Lluís Llach. The Catalan language, then a non-official language in the country, was often used as a vehicle of protest in itself, to highlight the cultural discrimination towards non-Castilian Spanish native speakers in Spain.

Most of the protest songs were in a folk style with social themes, and were popular among the (then banned) left-wing and their supporters, as well with many young students in main universities. Some notable songs were &quot;Al Alba&quot; (&quot;At Dawn&quot;) by Aute, &quot;Al vent&quot; (&quot;To The Wind&quot;) by Raimon, and &quot;L&#x27;Estaca&quot; (&quot;The Stake&quot;) by Llach.

The movement come to an end after the Spanish transition to democracy, years after Franco&#x27;s death. In 1997, singer Ismael Serrano briefly revamped the style, being his song &quot;Papá cuéntame otra vez&quot; (&quot;Dad, tell me again&quot;) a nostalgic hymn to the 1970s protests.

===United Kingdom===

==== 14th–19th century ====
English folk songs from the late medieval and early modern period reflect the social upheavals of their day. In 1944 the Marxist scholar A. L. Lloyd claimed that &quot;The Cutty Wren&quot; song constituted a coded anthem against feudal oppression and actually dated back to the English peasants&#x27; revolt of 1381, making it the oldest extant European protest song. He offered no evidence for his assertion, however and no trace of the song has been found before the 18th century. Despite Lloyd&#x27;s dubious claim about its origins, however, the &quot;Cutty Wren&quot; was revived and used as a protest song in the 1950s folk revival, an example of what may be considered a protest song. In contrast, the rhyme, &quot;When Adam delved and Eve span, who was then the gentleman?&quot;, is attested as authentically originating in the 1381 Peasant Revolt, though no tune associated with it has survived. Ballads celebrating social bandits like Robin Hood, from the 14th century onwards, can be seen as expressions of a desire for social justice, though although social criticism is implied and there is no overt questioning of the status quo.

The era of civil and religious wars of the 17th century in Britain gave rise to the radical communistic millenarian Levellers and Diggers&#x27; movements and their associated ballads and hymns, as, for example, the &quot;Diggers&#x27; Song&quot;. with the incendiary verse:
&lt;poem&gt;
But the Gentry must come down,
and the poor shall wear the crown.
Stand up now, Diggers all!&lt;/poem&gt;

The Digger movement was violently crushed, and so it is not surprising if few overt protest songs associated with it have survived. From roughly the same period, however, songs protesting wars and the human suffering they inflict abound, though such songs do not generally explicitly condemn the wars or the leaders who wage them. For example, &quot;The Maunding Souldier&quot; or &quot;The Fruits of Warre is Beggery&quot;, framed as a begging appeal from a crippled soldier of the Thirty Years&#x27; War. Such songs have been known, strictly speaking, as songs of complaint rather than of protest, since they offered no solution or hint of rebellion against the status quo.

The advent of industrialization in the 18th and early 19th centuries was accompanied by a series of protest movements and a corresponding increase in the number of topical social protest songs and ballads. An important example is &quot;The Triumph of General Ludd&quot;, which built a fictional persona for the alleged leader of the early 19th century anti-technological Luddite movement in the cloth industry of the north midlands, and which made explicit reference to the Robin Hood tradition. A surprising English folk hero immortalized in song is Napoleon Bonaparte, the military figure most often the subject of popular ballads, many of them treating him as the champion of the common working man in songs such as the &quot;Bonny Bunch of Roses&quot; and &quot;Napoleon&#x27;s Dream&quot;. As labour became more organized songs were used as anthems and propaganda, for miners with songs such as &quot;The Black Leg Miner&quot;, and for factory workers with songs such as &quot;The Factory Bell&quot;.

These industrial protest songs were largely ignored during the first English folk revival of the later 19th and early 20th century, which had focused on songs that had been collected in rural areas where they were still being sung and on music education. They were revived in the 1960s and performed by figures such as A. L. Lloyd on his album &quot;The Iron Muse&quot; (1963). In the 1980s the anarchist rock band Chumbawamba recorded several versions of traditional English protest songs as &quot;English Rebel Songs 1381–1914&quot;.

====20th century====
Colin Irwin, a journalist for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, believes the modern British protest movement started in 1958 when the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament organized a 53-mile march from Trafalgar Square to Aldermaston, to protest Britain&#x27;s participation in the arms race and recent testing of the H-bomb. The protest &quot;fired up young musicians to write campaigning new songs to argue the case against the bomb and whip up support along the way. Suddenly many of those in skiffle groups playing American songs were changing course and writing fierce topical songs to back direct action.&quot; A song composed for the march, &quot;The H-Bomb&#x27;s Thunder&quot;, set the words of a poem by novelist John Brunner to the tune of &quot;Miner&#x27;s Lifeguard&quot;:
&lt;poem&gt;
Men and women, stand together
Do not heed the men of war
Make your minds up now or never
Ban the bomb for evermore.&lt;/poem&gt;

Folk singer Ewan MacColl was for some time one of the principal musical figures of the British nuclear disarmament movement. A former agitprop actor and playwright. MacColl, a prolific songwriter and committed leftist, some years earlier had penned &quot;The Ballad of Ho Chi Minh&quot; (1953), issued as single on Topic Records, and &quot;The Ballad of Stalin&quot; (1954), commemorating the death of that leader. Neither record has ever been reissued.
According to Irwin, MacColl, when interviewed in the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; in 1958, declared that:There are now more new songs being written than at any other time in the past eighty years—young people are finding out for themselves that folk songs are tailor-made for expressing their thoughts and comments on contemporary topics, dreams, and worries,

In 1965, folk-rock singer Donovan&#x27;s cover of Buffy Sainte-Marie&#x27;s &quot;Universal Soldier&quot; was a hit on the charts. His anti-Vietnam War song &quot;The War Drags On&quot; appeared that same year. This was a common trend in popular music of the 1960s and 1970s. The romantic lyrics of pop songs in the 1950s gave way to words of protest.
As their fame and prestige increased in the late 1960s, The Beatles—and John Lennon in particular—added their voices to the anti-war movement. In the documentary &quot;The US Versus John Lennon&quot;, Tariq Ali attributes the Beatles&#x27; activism to the fact that, in his opinion, &quot;The whole culture had been radicalized: [Lennon] was engaged with the world, and the world was changing him.&quot; &quot;Revolution&quot;, 1968, commemorated the worldwide student uprisings. In 1969, when Lennon and Yoko Ono were married, they staged a week-long &quot;bed-in for peace&quot; in the Amsterdam Hilton, attracting worldwide media coverage. At the second &quot;Bed-in&quot; in Montreal, in June 1969, they recorded &quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot; in their hotel room. The song was sung by over half a million demonstrators in Washington, DC, at the second Vietnam Moratorium Day, on October 15, 1969. In 1972 Lennon&#x27;s most controversial protest song LP was released, &quot;Some Time in New York City&quot;, the title of whose lead single &quot;Woman Is the Nigger of the World&quot;, a phrase coined by Ono in the late 1960s to protest sexism, set off a storm of controversy, and in consequence received little airplay and much banning. The Lennons went to great lengths (including a press conference attended by staff from &quot;Jet&quot; and &quot;Ebony&quot; magazines) to explain that they had used the word &quot;nigger&quot; in a symbolic sense and not as an affront to African Americans. The album also included &quot;Attica State&quot;, about the Attica Prison riots of September 9, 1971; &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; and &quot;The Luck Of The Irish&quot;, about the massacre of demonstrators in Northern Ireland and &quot;Angela&quot;, in support of black activist Angela Davis. Lennon also performed at the &quot;Free John Sinclair&quot; benefit concert in Ann Arbor, Michigan, on December 10, 1971, on behalf of the imprisoned antiwar activist and poet who was serving 10 years in state prison for selling two joints of marijuana to an undercover cop. On this occasion Lennon and Ono appeared on stage with among others singers Phil Ochs and Stevie Wonder, plus antiwar activists Jerry Rubin and Bobby Seale of the Black Panthers party. Lennon&#x27;s song &quot;John Sinclair&quot; (which can be heard on his &quot;Some Time in New York City&quot; album), calls on the authorities to &quot;Let him be, set him free, let him be like you and me&quot;. The benefit was attended by some 20,000 people, and three days later the State of Michigan released Sinclair from prison.

The 1970s saw a number of notable songs by British acts that protested against war, including &quot;Peace Train&quot; by Cat Stevens (1971), and &quot;War Pigs&quot; by Black Sabbath (1970). Sabbath also protested environmental destruction, describing people leaving a ruined Earth (&quot;Into the Void&quot; including, &quot;Iron Man&quot;). Renaissance added political repression as a protest theme with &quot;Mother Russia&quot; being based on &quot;One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich&quot; and being joined on the second side of their 1974 album &quot;Turn of the Cards&quot; by two other protest songs in &quot;Cold Is Being&quot; (about ecological destruction) and &quot;Black Flame&quot; (about the Vietnam War).
As the 1970s progressed, the louder, more aggressive punk movement became the strongest voice of protest, particularly in the UK, featuring anti-war, anti-state, and anti-capitalist themes. The punk culture, in stark contrast with the 1960s&#x27; sense of power through union, concerned itself with individual freedom, often incorporating concepts of individualism, free thought and even anarchism. According to &quot;Search and Destroy&quot; founder V. Vale, &quot;Punk was a total cultural revolt. It was a hardcore confrontation with the black side of history and culture, right-wing imagery, sexual taboos, a delving into it that had never been done before by any generation in such a thorough way.&quot; The most significant protest songs of the movement included &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; (1977) by the Sex Pistols, &quot;If the Kids are United&quot; by Sham 69, &quot;Career Opportunities&quot; (1977) (protesting the political and economic situation in England at the time, especially the lack of jobs available to the youth), and &quot;White Riot&quot; (1977) (about class economics and race issues) by The Clash, and &quot;Right to Work&quot; by Chelsea. See also Punk ideology.

War was still the prevalent theme of British protest songs of the 1980s – such as Kate Bush&#x27;s &quot;Army Dreamers&quot; (1980), which deals with the traumas of a mother whose son dies while away at war. Indeed, the early 1980s was a remarkable period for anti-nuclear and anti-war UK political pop, much of it inspired directly or indirectly by the punk movement: 1980 saw &#x27;22 such Top 75 hits, by 18 different artists. For almost th[at] entire year ... (47 weeks), the UK singles charts contained at least one hit song that spoke of antiwar or antinuclear concerns, and usually more than one.&#x27; Further George McKay argues that &#x27;it really is quite extraordinary to note that one-third of the year 1984 (17 weeks) had some kind of political pop song at the top of the British charts. Viewed from that lofty perspective, 1984 must be seen as a peak protest music time in Britain, most of it in the context of antiwar and antinuclear sentiment.&#x27;

However, as the 1980s progressed, it was British prime minister Margaret Thatcher who came under the greatest degree of criticism from native protest singers, mostly for her strong stance against trade unions, and especially for her handling of the UK miners&#x27; strike (1984–1985), the subject of Sting&#x27;s &quot;We Work the Black Seam&quot;. The leading voice of protest in Thatcherite Britain in the 1980s was Billy Bragg, whose style of protest song and grass-roots political activism was mostly reminiscent of those of Woody Guthrie, however with themes that were relevant to the contemporary Briton. He summarized his stance in &quot;Between the Wars&quot; (1985), in which he sings: &quot;I&#x27;ll give my consent to any government that does not deny a man a living wage.&quot;

Also in the 1980s the band Frankie Goes to Hollywood released a political pop protest song Two Tribes a relentless bass-driven track depicting the futility and starkness of nuclear weapons and the Cold War. The video for the song depicted a wrestling match between then-President Ronald Reagan and then-Soviet leader Konstantin Chernenko for the benefit of group members and an eagerly belligerent assembly of representatives from the world&#x27;s nations, the event ultimately degenerating into complete global destruction. This video was played several times at the 1984 Democratic National Convention. Due to some violent scenes (&quot;Reagan&quot; biting &quot;Chernenko&quot;&#x27;s ear, etc.), the unedited video could not be shown on MTV, and an edited version was substituted. The single quickly hit the number one spot in the United Kingdom.
Several mixes of the track feature actor Patrick Allen, who recreated his narration from the Protect and Survive public information films for certain 12-inch mixes (the original Protect and Survive soundtracks were sampled for the 7-inch mixes).

== North America ==

=== United States===
===Cuba ===
A type of Cuban protest music started in the mid-1960s when a movement in Cuban music emerged that combined traditional folk music idioms with progressive and often politicized lyrics. This movement of protest music came to be known as &quot;Nueva trova&quot;, and was somewhat similar to that of Nueva canción, however with the advantage of support from the Cuban government, as it promoted the Cuban Revolution – and thus part of revolutionary song.

===Puerto Rico===
Though originally and still largely Cuban, nueva trova has become popular across Latin America, especially in Puerto Rico. The movements biggest stars included Puerto Ricans such as Roy Brown, Andrés Jiménez, Antonio Cabán Vale and the group Haciendo Punto en Otro Son.

In response to Telegramgate, Puerto Rican musicians Bad Bunny, Residente, and iLE released the protest song &quot;Afilando los cuchillos&quot; on July 17, 2019. It is a diss track calling for the resignation of Ricardo Rosselló.

==Oceania==

===Australia===
Indigenous issues feature prominently in politically inspired Australian music and include the topics of land rights and aboriginal deaths in custody. One of the most prominent Australian bands to confront these issues is Yothu Yindi. Other Australian bands to have confronted indigenous issues include Tiddas, Kev Carmody, Archie Roach, Christine Anu, The Herd, Neil Murray, Blue King Brown, the John Butler Trio, Midnight Oil, Warumpi Band, Paul Kelly, Powderfinger and Xavier Rudd.

In addition to Indigenous issues, many Australian protest singers have sung about the futility of war. Notable anti-war songs include &quot;And The Band Played Waltzing Matilda&quot; (1972) by Eric Bogle, and &quot;A Walk in the Light Green&quot; (1983) by Redgum, most often remembered by its chorus &quot;I was only nineteen&quot;.

Many songs have also been composed about environmental issues, protests and campaigns. These include &quot;Rip Rip Woodchip&quot; (1989) by John Williamson, and &quot;Let the Franklin Flow&quot; (1983) by Goanna. Numerous songs were written and performed by protesters during anti-logging blockades in northern New South Wales, including &quot;Behind Enemy Lines&quot;, &quot;Tonka Toys&quot; and &quot;Hey Terania&quot;.

===New Zealand===
One of the earliest protest songs in New Zealand was John Hanlon&#x27;s &quot;Damn the Dam&quot;, recorded in 1973 in support of the Save Manapouri Campaign.

During the bitterly divisive 1981 Springbok Tour, Blam Blam Blam&#x27;s &quot;There Is No Depression in New Zealand&quot; became a favourite among anti-tour protesters. Reggae band Herbs wrote and performed songs criticising French nuclear testing in the Pacific Ocean.

==South America==
===Argentina===
In Argentina, protest songs have been a powerful tool for political and social change, particularly during the military dictatorship (1976-1983) and the ongoing struggle for human rights. Notable protest songs include León Gieco&#x27;s &quot;Los Libros de la Buena Memoria,&quot; which addresses the horrors of the Dirty War, Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota&#x27;s &quot;Que Ves el Cielo,&quot; critiquing societal inequality, and Charly García&#x27;s &quot;La Memoria,&quot; reflecting on the dictatorship&#x27;s impact. Other significant artists like Víctor Heredia (&quot;Soy el Mar&quot;) and Mercedes Sosa (&quot;Desapariciones&quot;) have used their music to mourn victims of political repression and call for justice, making protest music a vital part of Argentina&#x27;s cultural resistance.

=== Chile ===
While the protest song was enjoying its Golden Age in America in the 1960s, it also saw many detractors overseas who saw it as having been commercialized. Chilean singer-songwriter Víctor Jara, who played a pivotal role in the folkloric renaissance that led to the &quot;Nueva Canción Chilena&quot; (New Chilean Song) movement, which created a revolution in the popular music of his country, criticized the &quot;commercialized&quot; American protest song phenomenon that had been imported into Chile. He criticized it thus:
The cultural invasion is like a leafy tree which prevents us from seeing our own sun, sky and stars. Therefore in order to be able to see the sky above our heads, our task is to cut this tree off at the roots. US imperialism understands very well the magic of communication through music and persists in filling our young people with all sorts of commercial tripe. With professional expertise they have taken certain measures: first, the commercialization of the so-called &#x27;protest music&#x27;; second, the creation of &#x27;idols&#x27; of protest music who obey the same rules and suffer from the same constraints as the other idols of the consumer music industry – they last a little while and then disappear. Meanwhile, they are useful in neutralizing the innate spirit of rebellion of young people. The term &#x27;protest song&#x27; is no longer valid because it is ambiguous and has been misused. I prefer the term &#x27;revolutionary song&#x27;.

Nueva canción (literally &quot;new song&quot; in Spanish) was a type of protest/social song in Latin American music which took root in South America, especially Chile and other Andean countries, and gained extreme popularity throughout Latin America. It combined traditional Latin American folk music idioms (played on the quena, zampoña, charango or cajón with guitar accompaniment) with some popular (esp. British) rock music, and was characterized by its progressive and often politicized lyrics. It is sometimes considered a precursor to rock en español. The lyrics are typically in Spanish, with some indigenous or local words mixed in.

In 2019, &quot;A Rapist in Your Path&quot; () was first performed in Chile to protest rape culture and victim shaming. Videos of the song and its accompanying dance went viral, spreading across the world.

<text>Richard Duane Griffin (born August 1, 1960), better known by his stage name Professor Griff, is an American spoken word artist, and lecturer currently residing in Atlanta. He was a member of the hip hop group Public Enemy, serving as the group&#x27;s Minister of Information.

During his time with Public Enemy, he was an adherent of the ideas espoused by Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, which informed both Griffin&#x27;s and Public Enemy&#x27;s ideological views. Having served in the U.S. Army and cultivating an interest in martial arts, he trained the S1W security team that toured with Public Enemy dressed in military uniforms, doing choreographed military step drills on stage.

==Controversy and departure from Public Enemy==
Before the release of &quot;It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back&quot;, Professor Griff, in his role as Minister of Information, gave interviews to UK magazines on behalf of Public Enemy, during which he made homophobic and anti-Semitic remarks. In a 1988 issue of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; he stated, &quot;There&#x27;s no place for gays. When God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, it was for that sort of behaviour&quot; and &quot;If the Palestinians took up arms, went into Israel and killed all the Jews, it&#x27;d be all right.&quot; However, there was little controversy until May 22, 1989, when Griffin was interviewed by &quot;The Washington Times&quot;. At the time, Public Enemy enjoyed unprecedented mainstream attention with the single &quot;Fight the Power&quot; from the soundtrack of Spike Lee&#x27;s film &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot;.

During the 1989 interview with David Mills, Griffin made numerous statements such as &quot;Jews are responsible for the majority of the wickedness in the world&quot;. When the interview was published, a media firestorm emerged, and the band found itself under intense scrutiny.
In a series of press conferences, Griffin was either fired, quit, or demoted. Def Jam co-founder Rick Rubin had already left the label by then; taking his place alongside Russell Simmons was Lyor Cohen, the son of Israeli immigrants who had run Rush Artist Management since 1985. Before the dust settled, Cohen claims to have arranged for a Holocaust Museum to give the band a private tour.

In an attempt to defuse the situation, Public Enemy frontman Chuck D first expressed an apology on Griffin&#x27;s behalf, and fired Griffin soon thereafter. Griffin later rejoined the group, provoking more protests, causing Chuck D to briefly disband the group. When Public Enemy reformed, due to increasing attention from the press and pressure from Def Jam hierarchy, Griffin was no longer with the group.

Griffin later publicly expressed remorse for his statements after a meeting with the National Holocaust Awareness Student Organization in 1990.

In his 2009 book &quot;Analytixz&quot;, Griffin once again admitted the faults in his 1989 statement: &quot;To say the Jews are responsible for the majority of wickedness that went on around the globe, I would have to know about the majority of wickedness that went on around the globe, which is impossible...I&#x27;m not the best knower—God is. Then, not only knowing that, I would have to know who is at the crux of all of the problems in the world and then blame Jewish people, which is not correct.&quot; Griff also said that not only were his words taken out of context, but that the recording was never released to the public for an unbiased listen. In a YouTube interview on August 2, 2018, Griffin recalled one of his many long conversations with record executive Lyor Cohen he said he used to have respectful debates about history: &quot;I told him about the history of him and his people about the Ashkenazi, the Ashke-Nazis, and when I laid it on him he couldn&#x27;t handle it and I&#x27;m like, all right, which is common knowledge today everybody talking about it, you understand what I&#x27;m saying people are making books about it.&quot;

==Afrocentrism==
Griffin embraces a form of Afrocentrism. He is a member of the Nation of Islam.

After his departure from Public Enemy, Griffin formed his own group, the Last Asiatic Disciples. Griffin&#x27;s albums were of an Islamic (NOI) and Afrocentric style, combined with increasingly spoken word lyrics.

His lyrics and record titles as a solo artist referenced his allegiance to the Nation of Islam. Another general theme in his lyrics is New World Order conspiracy.

==Personal life==
On August 27, 2017, Griffin married rapper Solé. The couple met 23 years earlier and resumed their relationship after Solé and Ginuwine divorced.

<text>In philosophy, physicalism is the view that &quot;everything is physical&quot;, that there is &quot;nothing over and above&quot; the physical, or that everything supervenes on the physical. It is opposed to idealism, according to which the world arises from mind. Physicalism is a form of ontological monism—a &quot;one substance&quot; view of the nature of reality, unlike &quot;two-substance&quot; (mind–body dualism) or &quot;many-substance&quot; (pluralism) views. Both the definition of &quot;physical&quot; and the meaning of physicalism have been debated.

Physicalism is closely related to materialism, and has evolved from materialism with advancements in the physical sciences in explaining observed phenomena. The terms &quot;physicalism&quot; and &quot;materialism&quot; are often used interchangeably, but can be distinguished on the basis that physics describes more than just matter. Physicalism encompasses matter, but also energy, physical laws, space, time, structure, physical processes, information, state, and forces, among other things, as described by physics and other sciences, all within a monistic framework.

According to a 2020 survey, physicalism is the majority view among philosophers at 51.9%, while there also remains significant opposition to physicalism.

Outside of philosophy, physicalism can also refer to the preference or viewpoint that physics should be considered the best and only way to render truth about the world or reality.

== Definition of physicalism in philosophy ==
The word &quot;physicalism&quot; was introduced into philosophy in the 1930s by Otto Neurath and Rudolf Carnap.

The use of &quot;physical&quot; in physicalism is a philosophical concept and can be distinguished from alternative definitions found in the literature (e.g., Karl Popper defined a physical proposition as one that can at least in theory be denied by observation). A &quot;physical property&quot;, in this context, may be a metaphysical or logical combination of properties which are physical in the ordinary sense. It is common to express the notion of &quot;metaphysical or logical combination of properties&quot; using the notion of supervenience: A property &quot;A&quot; is said to supervene on a property &quot;B&quot; if any change in &quot;A&quot; necessarily implies a change in &quot;B&quot;. Since any change in a combination of properties must consist of a change in at least one component property, we see that the combination does indeed supervene on the individual properties. The point of this extension is that physicalists usually suppose the existence of various abstract concepts which are non-physical in the ordinary sense of the word; so physicalism cannot be defined in a way that denies the existence of these abstractions. Also, physicalism defined in terms of supervenience does not entail that all properties in the actual world are type identical to physical properties. It is therefore compatible with multiple realizability.

From the notion of supervenience, it can be seen that, assuming that mental, social, and biological properties supervene on physical properties, two hypothetical worlds cannot be identical in their physical properties but differ in their mental, social or biological properties.

Two common approaches to defining &quot;physicalism&quot; are the theory-based and object-based approaches. The theory-based conception of physicalism proposes that &quot;a property is physical if and only if it either is the sort of property that physical theory tells us about or else is a property which metaphysically (or logically) supervenes on the sort of property that physical theory tells us about&quot;. Likewise, the object-based conception claims that &quot;a property is physical if and only if: it either is the sort of property required by a complete account of the intrinsic nature of paradigmatic physical objects and their constituents or else is a property which metaphysically (or logically) supervenes on the sort of property required by a complete account of the intrinsic nature of paradigmatic physical objects and their constituents&quot;.

Physicalists have traditionally opted for a &quot;theory-based&quot; characterization of the physical either in terms of current physics or a future (ideal) physics. These two theory-based conceptions of the physical represent both horns of Hempel&#x27;s dilemma (named after the late philosopher of science and logical empiricist Carl Gustav Hempel): an argument against theory-based understandings of the physical. Very roughly, Hempel&#x27;s dilemma is that if we define the physical by reference to current physics, then physicalism is very likely to be false, as it is very likely (by pessimistic meta-induction) that much of current physics is false. But if we instead define the physical in terms of a future (ideal) or completed physics, then physicalism is hopelessly vague or indeterminate.

While the force of Hempel&#x27;s dilemma against theory-based conceptions of the physical remains contested, alternative &quot;non-theory-based&quot; conceptions of the physical have also been proposed. Frank Jackson, for example, has argued in favour of the aforementioned &quot;object-based&quot; conception of the physical. An objection to this proposal, which Jackson noted, is that if it turns out that panpsychism or panprotopsychism is true, then such a non-materialist understanding of the physical gives the counterintuitive result that physicalism is nevertheless also true, since such properties will figure in a complete account of paradigmatic examples of the physical.

David Papineau and Barbara Montero have advanced and subsequently defended a &quot;via negativa&quot; characterization of the physical. The gist of the via negativa strategy is to understand the physical in terms of what it is not: the mental. In other words, the via negativa strategy understands the physical as &quot;the non-mental&quot;. An objection to the via negativa conception of the physical is that (like the object-based conception) it lacks the resources to distinguish neutral monism (or panprotopsychism) from physicalism.

=== Supervenience-based definitions of physicalism ===

Adopting a supervenience-based account of the physical, the definition of physicalism as &quot;all properties are physical&quot; can be reduced to:

(1) Physicalism is true at a possible world &quot;w&quot; if and only if any world that is a physical duplicate of &quot;w&quot; is also a duplicate of &quot;w simpliciter&quot;.

Applied to the actual world (our world), (1) is the claim that physicalism is true at the actual world if and only if at &quot;every possible world&quot; in which the physical properties and laws of the actual world are instantiated, the non-physical (in the ordinary sense of the word) properties of the actual world are also instantiated. To borrow a metaphor from Saul Kripke, the truth of physicalism at the actual world entails that once God has instantiated or &quot;fixed&quot; the physical properties and laws of our world, then God&#x27;s work is done; the rest comes &quot;automatically&quot;.

But (1) fails to capture even a necessary condition for physicalism to be true at a world &quot;w&quot;. To see this, imagine a world in which there are &quot;only&quot; physical properties; if physicalism is true at any world it is true at this one. But one can conceive physical duplicates of such a world that are &quot;not&quot; also duplicates simpliciter of it: worlds that have the same physical properties as our imagined one, but with some additional property or properties. A world might contain &quot;epiphenomenal ectoplasm&quot;, some additional pure experience that does not interact with the physical components of the world and is not necessitated by them (does not supervene on them). To handle the epiphenomenal ectoplasm problem, (1) can be modified to include a &quot;that&#x27;s-all&quot; or &quot;totality&quot; clause or be restricted to &quot;positive&quot; properties. Adopting the former suggestion here, we can reformulate (1) as follows:

(2) Physicalism is true at a possible world &quot;w&quot; if and only if any world that is a &quot;minimal&quot; physical duplicate of &quot;w&quot; is a duplicate of &quot;w simpliciter&quot;.

Applied in the same way, (2) is the claim that physicalism is true at a possible world &quot;w&quot; if and only if any world that is a physical duplicate of &quot;w&quot; (without any further changes) is a duplicate of &quot;w&quot; without qualification. This allows a world in which there are only physical properties to be counted as one at which physicalism is true, since worlds in which there is some extra stuff are &quot;not&quot; &quot;minimal&quot; physical duplicates of such a world, nor are they minimal physical duplicates of worlds that contain some non-physical properties that are metaphysically necessitated by the physical.

But while (2) solves the problem of worlds at which there is some extra stuff (sometimes called the &quot;epiphenomenal ectoplasm problem&quot;), it faces a different challenge: the &quot;blockers problem&quot;. Imagine a world &quot;w1&quot; where the relation between the physical and non-physical properties at this world is slightly weaker than metaphysical necessitation, such that a certain kind of non-physical intervener—&quot;a blocker&quot;—could, were it to exist at &quot;w1,&quot; prevent the non-physical properties in &quot;w1&quot; from being instantiated by the instantiation of the physical properties at &quot;w1.&quot; Since (2) rules out worlds that are physical duplicates of &quot;w1&quot; and also contain non-physical interveners by virtue of the minimality, or that&#x27;s-all clause, (2) gives the (allegedly) incorrect result that physicalism is true at &quot;w1.&quot; One response to this problem is to abandon (2) in favour of the possibility mentioned earlier in which supervenience-based formulations of physicalism are restricted to what David Chalmers calls &quot;positive properties&quot;. A positive property is one that &quot;if instantiated in a world W, is also instantiated by the corresponding individual in all worlds that contain W as a proper part.&quot; Following this suggestion, we can then formulate physicalism as follows:

(3) Physicalism is true at a possible world &quot;w&quot; if and only if any world that is a physical duplicate of &quot;w&quot; is a positive duplicate of &quot;w&quot;.

(3) seems able to handle both the epiphenomenal ectoplasm problem and the blockers problem. With regard to the former, (3) gives the correct result that a purely physical world is one at which physicalism is true, since worlds in which there is some extra stuff are positive duplicates of a purely physical world. With regard to the latter, (3) appears to have the consequence that worlds in which there are blockers are worlds where positive non-physical properties of &quot;w1&quot; will be absent, hence &quot;w1&quot; will not be counted as a world at which physicalism is true. Daniel Stoljar objects to this response to the blockers problem on the basis that since the non-physical properties of &quot;w1&quot; aren&#x27;t instantiated at a world in which there is a blocker, they are not positive properties in Chalmers&#x27;s sense, and so (3) will count &quot;w1&quot; as a world at which physicalism is true after all.

A further problem for supervenience-based formulations of physicalism is the so-called &quot;necessary beings problem&quot;. A necessary being in this context is a non-physical being who exists in all possible worlds (for example, what theists call God). A necessary being is compatible with all the definitions provided, because it is supervenient on everything; yet it is usually taken to contradict the notion that everything is physical. So any supervenience-based formulation of physicalism will at best state a necessary but not sufficient condition for physicalism.

Additional objections have been raised to the above definitions provided for supervenience physicalism: one could imagine an alternative world that differs only by the presence of a single ammonium molecule (or physical property), and yet based on (1), such a world might be completely different in terms of its distribution of mental properties. Furthermore, there are disputes about the modal status of physicalism: whether it is a necessary truth or is only true in a world that conforms to certain conditions (i.e. those of physicalism).

=== Realisation physicalism ===

Closely related to supervenience physicalism is realisation physicalism, the thesis that every instantiated property is either physical or realised by a physical property.

=== Token physicalism ===
Token physicalism is the proposition that &quot;for every actual particular (object, event or process) x, there is some physical particular y such that x = y&quot;. It is intended to capture the idea of &quot;physical mechanisms&quot;. Token physicalism is compatible with property dualism, in which all substances are &quot;physical&quot;, but physical objects may have mental properties as well as physical properties. Token physicalism is not however equivalent to supervenience physicalism. First, token physicalism does not imply supervenience physicalism because the former does not rule out the possibility of non-supervenient properties (provided that they are associated only with physical particulars). Second, supervenience physicalism does not imply token physicalism, for the former allows supervenient objects (such as a &quot;nation&quot;, or &quot;soul&quot;) that are not equal to any physical object.

== Reductionism and emergentism ==

There are multiple versions of reductionism. In the context of physicalism, the reductions referred to are of a &quot;linguistic&quot; nature, allowing discussions of, say, mental phenomena to be translated into discussions of physics. In one formulation, every concept is analysed in terms of a physical concept. One counterargument to this supposes there may be an additional class of expressions that is non-physical but increases a theory&#x27;s expressive power. Another version of reductionism is based on the requirement that one theory (mental or physical) be logically derivable from a second.

The combination of reductionism and physicalism is usually called reductive physicalism in the philosophy of mind. The opposite view is non-reductive physicalism. Reductive physicalism is the view that mental states are both nothing over and above physical states and reducible to physical states. One version of reductive physicalism is type physicalism, or mind-body identity theory. Type physicalism asserts that &quot;for every actually instantiated property F, there is some physical property G such that F=G&quot;. Unlike token physicalism, type physicalism entails supervenience physicalism.

Another common argument against type physicalism is multiple realizability, the possibility that a psychological process (say) could be instantiated by many different neurological processes (even non-neurological processes, in the case of machine or alien intelligence). For in this case, the neurological terms translating a psychological term must be disjunctions over the possible instantiations, and it is argued that no physical law can use these disjunctions as terms. Type physicalism was the original target of the multiple realizability argument, and it is not clear that token physicalism is susceptible to objections from multiple realizability.

=== Emergentism ===
There are two versions of emergentism, the strong version and the weak version. Supervenience physicalism has been seen as a strong version of emergentism, in which the subject&#x27;s psychological experience is considered genuinely novel. Non-reductive physicalism, on the other side, is a weak version of emergentism because it does not need that the subject&#x27;s psychological experience be novel. The strong version of emergentism is incompatible with physicalism. Since there are novel mental states, mental states are not nothing over and above physical states. But the weak version of emergentism is compatible with physicalism.

Emergentism is a very broad view. Some forms of it appear either incompatible with physicalism or equivalent to it (e.g. posteriori physicalism); others appear to merge both dualism and supervenience. Emergentism compatible with dualism claims that mental states and physical states are metaphysically distinct while maintaining the supervenience of mental states on physical states. But this contradicts supervenience physicalism, which denies dualism.

== &quot;A priori&quot; versus &quot;a posteriori&quot; physicalism ==
Physicalists hold that physicalism is true. A natural question for physicalists, then, is whether the truth of physicalism is deducible a priori from the nature of the physical world (i.e., the inference is justified independently of experience, even though the nature of the physical world can itself only be determined through experience) or can only be deduced a posteriori (i.e., the justification of the inference itself is dependent upon experience). So-called &quot;a priori physicalists&quot; hold that from knowledge of the conjunction of all physical truths, a totality or that&#x27;s-all truth (to rule out non-physical epiphenomena, and enforce the closure of the physical world), and some primitive indexical truths such as &quot;I am A&quot; and &quot;now is B&quot;, the truth of physicalism is knowable a priori. Let &quot;P&quot; stand for the conjunction of all physical truths and laws, &quot;T&quot; for a that&#x27;s-all truth, &quot;I&quot; for the indexical &quot;centering&quot; truths, and &quot;N&quot; for any [presumably non-physical] truth at the actual world. We can then, using the material conditional &quot;→&quot;, represent a priori physicalism as the thesis that PTI → N is knowable a priori. An important wrinkle here is that the concepts in N must be possessed non-deferentially in order for PTI → N to be knowable a priori. The suggestion, then, is that possession of the concepts in the consequent, plus the empirical information in the antecedent is sufficient for the consequent to be knowable a priori.

An &quot;a posteriori physicalist&quot;, on the other hand, will reject the claim that PTI → N is knowable a priori. Rather, they would hold that the inference from PTI to N is justified by metaphysical considerations that in turn can be derived from experience. So the claim then is that &quot;PTI and not N&quot; is metaphysically impossible.

One commonly issued challenge to a priori physicalism and to physicalism in general is the &quot;conceivability argument&quot;, or zombie argument. At a rough approximation, the conceivability argument runs as follows:

P1) PTI and not Q (where &quot;Q&quot; stands for the conjunction of all truths about consciousness, or some &quot;generic&quot; truth about someone being &quot;phenomenally&quot; conscious [i.e., there is &quot;something it is like&quot; to be a person x] ) is conceivable (i.e., it is not knowable a priori that PTI and not Q is false).

P2) If PTI and not Q is conceivable, then PTI and not Q is metaphysically possible.

P3) If PTI and not Q is metaphysically possible then physicalism is false.

C) Physicalism is false.

Here proposition P3 is a direct application of the supervenience of consciousness, and hence of any supervenience-based version of physicalism: If PTI and not Q is possible, there is some possible world where it is true. This world differs from [the relevant indexing on] our world, where PTIQ is true. But the other world is a minimal physical duplicate of our world, because PT is true there. So there is a possible world which is a minimal physical duplicate of our world, but not a full duplicate; this contradicts the definition of physicalism that we saw above.

Since a priori physicalists hold that PTI → N is a priori, they are committed to denying P1) of the conceivability argument. The a priori physicalist, then, must argue that PTI and not Q, on ideal rational reflection, is incoherent or contradictory.

A posteriori physicalists, on the other hand, generally accept P1) but deny P2)--the move from &quot;conceivability to metaphysical possibility&quot;. Some a posteriori physicalists think that unlike the possession of most, if not all other empirical concepts, the possession of consciousness has the special property that the presence of PTI and the absence of consciousness will be conceivable—even though, according to them, it is knowable a posteriori that PTI and not Q is not metaphysically possible. These a posteriori physicalists endorse some version of what Daniel Stoljar (2005) has called &quot;the phenomenal concept strategy&quot;. Roughly speaking, the phenomenal concept strategy is a label for those a posteriori physicalists who attempt to show that it is only the &quot;concept&quot; of consciousness—not the &quot;property&quot;—that is in some way &quot;special&quot; or sui generis. Other a posteriori physicalists eschew the phenomenal concept strategy, and argue that even ordinary macroscopic truths such as &quot;water covers 60% of the earth&#x27;s surface&quot; are not knowable a priori from PTI and a non-deferential grasp of the concepts &quot;water&quot; and &quot;earth&quot; &quot;et cetera&quot;. If this is correct, then we should (arguably) conclude that conceivability does not entail metaphysical possibility, and P2) of the conceivability argument against physicalism is false.

== Other views ==

=== Realistic physicalism ===
Galen Strawson&#x27;s realistic physicalism or realistic monism entails panpsychism – or at least . Strawson argues that &quot;many—perhaps most—of those who call themselves physicalists or materialists [are mistakenly] committed to the thesis that physical stuff is, in itself, in its fundamental nature, something wholly and utterly non-experiential... even when they are prepared to admit with Eddington that physical stuff has, in itself, &#x27;a nature capable of manifesting itself as mental activity&#x27;, i.e. as experience or consciousness&quot;. Because experiential phenomena allegedly cannot be emergent from wholly non-experiential phenomena, philosophers are driven to substance dualism, property dualism, eliminative materialism and &quot;all other crazy attempts at wholesale mental-to-non-mental reduction&quot;.
Christian List argues that Benj Hellie&#x27;s vertiginous question, i.e. why a given individual exists as that individual and not as someone else, and the existence of first-personal facts, is evidence against physicalist theories of consciousness and against other third-personal metaphysical pictures, including standard versions of dualism. List also argues that the vertiginous question implies a &quot;quadrilemma&quot; for theories of consciousness, where no theory of consciousness can simultaneously respect four initially plausible metaphysical claims – namely, &quot;first-person realism&quot;, &quot;non-solipsism&quot;, &quot;non-fragmentation&quot;, and &quot;one world&quot; – but that any three of the four claims are mutually consistent.

<doc id="23483" wikidata="Q3300457" url="?curid=23483" title="Philosophy of perception">
<text>The philosophy of perception is concerned with the nature of perceptual experience and the status of perceptual data, in particular how they relate to beliefs about, or knowledge of, the world. Any explicit account of perception requires a commitment to one of a variety of ontological or metaphysical views. Philosophers distinguish internalist accounts, which assume that perceptions of objects, and knowledge or beliefs about them, are aspects of an individual&#x27;s mind, and externalist accounts, which state that they constitute real aspects of the world external to the individual. The position of naïve realism—the &#x27;everyday&#x27; impression of physical objects constituting what is perceived—is to some extent contradicted by the occurrence of perceptual illusions and hallucinations and the relativity of perceptual experience as well as certain insights in science. Realist conceptions include phenomenalism and direct and indirect realism. Anti-realist conceptions include idealism and skepticism. Recent philosophical work have expanded on the philosophical features of perception by going beyond the single paradigm of vision (for instance, by investigating the uniqueness of olfaction).

==Scientific accounts of perception==

An object at some distance from an observer will reflect light in all directions, some of which will fall upon the corneae of the eyes, where it will be focussed upon each retina, forming an image. The disparity between the electrical output of these two slightly different images is resolved either at the level of the lateral geniculate nucleus or in a part of the visual cortex called &#x27;V1&#x27;. The resolved data is further processed in the visual cortex where some areas have specialised functions, for instance area V5 is involved in the modelling of motion and V4 in adding colour. The resulting single image that subjects report as their experience is called a &#x27;percept&#x27;. Studies involving rapidly changing scenes show the percept derives from numerous processes that involve time delays. Recent fMRI studies show that dreams, imaginings and perceptions of things such as faces are accompanied by activity in many of the same areas of brain as are involved with physical sight. Imagery that originates from the senses and internally generated imagery may have a shared ontology at higher levels of cortical processing.

Sound is analyzed in term of pressure waves sensed by the cochlea in the ear. Data from the eyes and ears is combined to form a &#x27;bound&#x27; percept. The problem of how this is produced, known as the binding problem.

Perception is analyzed as a cognitive process in which information processing is used to transfer information into the mind where it is related to other information. Some psychologists propose that this processing gives rise to particular mental states (cognitivism) whilst others envisage a direct path back into the external world in the form of action (radical behaviourism). Behaviourists such as John B. Watson and B.F. Skinner have proposed that perception acts largely as a process between a stimulus and a response but have noted that Gilbert Ryle&#x27;s &quot;ghost in the machine of the brain&quot; still seems to exist. &quot;The objection to inner states is not that they do not exist, but that they are not relevant in a functional analysis&quot;. This view, in which experience is thought to be an incidental by-product of information processing, is known as epiphenomenalism.

Contrary to the behaviouralist approach to understanding the elements of cognitive processes, gestalt psychology sought to understand their organization as a whole, studying perception as a process of figure and ground.

==Problem of Perception==
Important philosophical problems derive from the epistemology of perception—how we can gain knowledge via perception—such as the question of the nature of qualia. Within the biological study of perception naive realism is unusable. However, outside biology modified forms of naive realism are defended. Thomas Reid, the eighteenth-century founder of the Scottish School of Common Sense, formulated the idea that sensation was composed of a set of data transfers but also declared that there is still a direct connection between perception and the world. This idea, called direct realism, has again become popular in recent years with the rise of postmodernism.

The succession of data transfers involved in perception suggests that sense data are somehow available to a perceiving subject that is the substrate of the percept. Indirect realism, the view held by John Locke and Nicolas Malebranche, proposes that we can only be aware of mental representations of objects. However, this may imply an infinite regress (a perceiver within a perceiver within a perceiver...), though a finite regress is perfectly possible. It also assumes that perception is entirely due to data transfer and information processing, an argument that can be avoided by proposing that the percept does not depend wholly upon the transfer and rearrangement of data. This still involves basic ontological issues of the sort raised by Leibniz Locke, Hume, Whitehead and others, which remain outstanding particularly in relation to the binding problem, the question of how different perceptions (e.g. color and contour in vision) are &quot;bound&quot; to the same object when they are processed by separate areas of the brain.

Indirect realism (representational views) provides an account of issues such as perceptual contents, qualia, dreams, imaginings, hallucinations, illusions, the resolution of binocular rivalry, the resolution of multistable perception, the modelling of motion that allows us to watch TV, the sensations that result from direct brain stimulation, the update of the mental image by saccades of the eyes and the referral of events backwards in time. Direct realists must either argue that these experiences do not occur or else refuse to define them as perceptions.

Idealism holds that reality is limited to mental qualities while skepticism challenges our ability to know anything outside our minds. One of the most influential proponents of idealism was George Berkeley who maintained that everything was mind or dependent upon mind. Berkeley&#x27;s idealism has two main strands, phenomenalism in which physical events are viewed as a special kind of mental event and subjective idealism. David Hume is probably the most influential proponent of skepticism.

A fourth theory of perception in opposition to naive realism, enactivism, attempts to find a middle path between direct realist and indirect realist theories, positing that cognition is a process of dynamic interplay between an organism&#x27;s sensory-motor capabilities and the environment it brings forth. Instead of seeing perception as a passive process determined entirely by the features of an independently existing world, enactivism suggests that organism and environment are structurally coupled and co-determining. The theory was first formalized by Francisco Varela, Evan Thompson, and Eleanor Rosch in &quot;The Embodied Mind&quot;.

==Spatial representation==
An aspect of perception that is common to both realists and anti-realists is the idea of mental or perceptual space. David Hume concluded that things appear extended because they have attributes of colour and solidity. A popular modern philosophical view is that the brain cannot contain images so our sense of space must be due to the actual space occupied by physical things. However, as René Descartes noticed, perceptual space has a projective geometry, things within it appear as if they are viewed from a point. The phenomenon of perspective was closely studied by artists and architects in the Renaissance, who relied mainly on the 11th century polymath, Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham), who affirmed the visibility of perceptual space in geometric structuring projections. Mathematicians now know of many types of projective geometry such as complex Minkowski space that might describe the layout of things in perception (see Peters (2000)) and it has also emerged that parts of the brain contain patterns of electrical activity that correspond closely to the layout of the retinal image (this is known as retinotopy). How or whether these become conscious experience is still unknown (see McGinn (1995)).

==Beyond spatial representation==
Traditionally, the philosophical investigation of perception has focused on the sense of vision as the paradigm of sensory perception. However, studies on the other sensory modalities, such as the sense of smell, can challenge what we consider characteristic or essential features of perception. Take olfaction as an example. Spatial representation relies on a &quot;mapping&quot; paradigm that maps the spatial structures of the stimuli onto discrete neural structures and representations. However, olfactory science has shown us that perception is also a matter of associative learning, observational refinement, and a decision-making process that is context-dependent. One of the consequences of these discoveries on the philosophy of perception is that common perceptual effects such as conceptual imagery turn more on the neural architecture and its development than the topology of the stimulus itself.

<text>In the philosophy of language, a proper name examples include a name of a specific person or place is a name which ordinarily is taken to uniquely identify its referent in the world. As such it presents particular challenges for theories of meaning, and it has become a central problem in analytic philosophy. The common-sense view was originally formulated by John Stuart Mill in &quot;A System of Logic&quot; (1843), where he defines it as &quot;a word that answers the purpose of showing what thing it is that we are talking about but not of telling anything about it&quot;. This view was criticized when philosophers applied principles of formal logic to linguistic propositions. Gottlob Frege pointed out that proper names may apply to imaginary or nonexistent entities, without becoming meaningless, and he showed that sometimes more than one proper name may identify the same entity without having the same &quot;sense&quot;, so that the phrase &quot;Homer believed the morning star was the evening star&quot; could be meaningful and not tautological in spite of the fact that the morning star and the evening star identifies the same referent. This example became known as &quot;Frege&#x27;s puzzle&quot; and is a central issue in the theory of proper names.

Bertrand Russell was the first to propose a descriptivist theory of names, which held that a proper name refers not to a referent, but to a set of true propositions that uniquely describe a referent – for example, &quot;Aristotle&quot; refers to &quot;the teacher of Alexander the Great&quot;. Rejecting descriptivism, Saul Kripke and Keith Donnellan instead advanced causal-historical theories of reference, which hold that names come to be associated with individual referents because social groups who link the name to its reference in a naming event (e.g. a baptism), which henceforth fixes the value of the name to the specific referent within that community. Today a direct reference theory is common, which holds that proper names refer to their referents without attributing any additional information, connotative or of sense, about them.

==Problems==
The problems of proper names arise within a theory of meaning that is based on truth values and propositional logic, when trying to ascertain the criteria with which to determine if propositions that include proper names are true or false.

For example, in the proposition &quot;Cicero is Roman&quot;, it is unclear what semantic content the proper name &quot;Cicero&quot; provides to the proposition. One may intuitively assume that the name refers to a person who may or may not be Roman, and that the truth value depends on whether or not that is the case. But from the point of view of a theory of meaning the question is &quot;how&quot; the word &quot;Cicero&quot; establishes its referent.

Another problem, known as &quot;Frege&#x27;s puzzle&quot;, asks why it can be the case that the two names can refer to the same referent, yet not necessarily be considered entirely synonymous. His example is that the proposition &quot;Hesperus is Hesperus&quot; (Hesperus being the Greek name of the evening star) is tautological and vacuous while the proposition &quot;Hesperus is Phosphorus&quot; (Phosphorus or Eosphorus being the Greek name of the morning star) conveys information. This puzzle suggests that there is something more to the meaning of the proper name than simply pointing out its referent.

== Theories ==
Many theories have been proposed about proper names, each attempting to solve the problems of reference and identity inherent in the concept.

===Millian theory===
John Stuart Mill distinguished between connotative and denotative meaning, and argued that proper names included no other semantic content to a proposition than identifying the referent of the name and were hence purely denotative. Some contemporary proponents of a Millian theory of proper names argue that the process through which something becomes a proper name is exactly the gradual loss of connotation for pure denotation such as the process that turned the descriptive propositions &quot;long island&quot; into the proper name Long Island.

===Sense-based theory of names===
Gotlob Frege argued that one had to distinguish between the sense (&quot;Sinn&quot;) and the reference of the name, and that different names for the same entity might identify the same referent without being formally synonymous. For example, although the morning star and the evening star are the same astronomical object, the proposition &quot;the morning star is the evening star&quot; is not a tautology, but provides actual information to someone who did not know this. Hence, to Frege, the two names for the object must have a different sense. Philosophers such as John McDowell have elaborated on Frege&#x27;s theory of proper names.

=== Descriptive theory ===
The &quot;descriptive&quot; theory of proper names is the view that the meaning of a given use of a proper name is a set of properties that can be expressed as a description that picks out an object that satisfies the description. 
Bertrand Russell espoused such a view arguing that the name refers to a description, and that description, like a definition, &quot;picks out&quot; the bearer of the name. The name then functions as an abbreviation or a truncated form of the description. The distinction between the embedded description and the bearer itself is similar to that between the &quot;extension&quot; and the &quot;intension&quot; (Frege&#x27;s terms) of a general term, or between connotation and denotation (Mill&#x27;s terms).

John Searle elaborated Russell&#x27;s theory, suggesting that the proper name refers to a cluster of propositions that in combination pick out a unique referent. This was meant to deal with the objection by some critics of Russell&#x27;s theory that a descriptive theory of meaning would make the referent of a name dependent on the knowledge that the person saying the name has about the referent.

In 1973, Tyler Burge proposed a metalinguistic descriptivist theory of proper names which holds that names have the meaning that corresponds to the description of the individual entities to whom the name is applied. This, however, opens up the possibility that names are not proper, when, for example, more than one person shares the same name. This leads Burge to argue that plural usages of names, such as &quot;all the Alfreds I know have red hair&quot;, support this view.

=== Causal theory of names ===

The causal-historical theory originated by Saul Kripke in &quot;Naming and Necessity&quot;, building on work by, among others, Keith Donnellan, combines the referential view with the idea that a name&#x27;s referent is fixed by a baptismal act, whereupon the name becomes a rigid designator of the referent. Kripke did not emphasize causality, but rather the historical relation between the naming event and the community of speakers within which it circulates, but in spite of this the theory is often called &quot;a causal theory of naming&quot;.

The pragmatic naming theory of Charles Sanders Peirce is sometimes considered a precursor of causal-historical naming theory. He described proper names in the following terms: &quot;A proper name, when one meets with it for the first time, is existentially connected with some percept or other equivalent individual knowledge of the individual it names. It is then, and then only, a genuine Index. The next time one meets with it, one regards it as an Icon of that Index. The habitual acquaintance with it having been acquired, it becomes a Symbol whose Interpretant represents it as an Icon of an Index of the Individual named.&quot; Here he notes out that the baptismal event takes place for each person when a proper name is first associated with a referent (for example by pointing and saying &quot;this is John&quot;, establishing an indexical relation between the name and the person) who is henceforth considered to be a conventional (&quot;symbolic&quot; in Peircean terms) references to the referent. [ &quot;who is...a conventional...references to the referent&quot; is grammatically incorrect, rendering the whole sentence incoherent]

===Direct reference theories===

Rejecting sense-based, descriptivist and causal-historical theories of naming, theories of direct reference hold that names together with demonstratives are a class of words that refer directly to their referent.

In the &quot;Tractatus Logico Philosophicus,&quot; Ludwig Wittgenstein also held a direct reference position, arguing that names refer to a particular directly, and that this referent is its only meaning. In his later work, however, he has been attributed a cluster-descriptivist position based on the idea of family resemblances (for example by Kripke), although it has been argued that this misconstrues Wittgenstein&#x27;s argument. Particularly, his later view has been compared to that of Kripke&#x27;s own view which recognizes names as stemming from a social convention and pragmatic principles of understanding others utterances.

Direct reference theory is similar to Mill&#x27;s theory in that it proposes that the only meaning of a proper name is its referent. Modern proposals such as those by David Kaplan, which distinguish between Fregean and non-Fregean terms, the former which have both sense and reference and the latter which include proper names and have only reference.

===Continental philosophy===
Outside of the analytic tradition, few continental philosophers have approached the proper name as a philosophical problem. In &quot;Of Grammatology,&quot; Jacques Derrida specifically refutes the idea that proper names stand outside of the social construct of language as a binary relation between referent and sign. Rather, he argues the proper name as all words are caught up in a context of social, spatial, and temporal differences that make it meaningful. He also notes that there are subjective elements of meaning in proper names, since they connect the bearer of a name with the sign of their own identity.

<text>Prolog is a logic programming language that has its origins in artificial intelligence, automated theorem proving and computational linguistics.

Prolog has its roots in first-order logic, a formal logic, and unlike many other programming languages, Prolog is intended primarily as a declarative programming language: the program is a set of facts and rules, which define relations. A computation is initiated by running a &quot;query&quot; over the program.

Prolog was one of the first logic programming languages and remains the most popular such language today, with several free and commercial implementations available. The language has been used for theorem proving, expert systems, term rewriting, type systems, and automated planning, as well as its original intended field of use, natural language processing.

Prolog is a Turing-complete, general-purpose programming language, which is well-suited for intelligent knowledge-processing applications.

== History ==

The name &quot;Prolog&quot; was chosen by Philippe Roussel, at the suggestion of his wife, as an abbreviation for &#x27; (French for &quot;Programming in logic&quot;). It was created around 1972 by Alain Colmerauer with Philippe Roussel, from the &quot;Artificial Intelligence Group&quot; of the Faculty of Sciences of Luminy of Aix-Marseille II University of France. It was based on Robert Kowalski&#x27;s procedural interpretation of Horn clauses, and it was motivated in part by the desire to reconcile the use of logic as a declarative knowledge representation language with the procedural representation of knowledge that was popular in North America in the late 1960s and early 1970s. According to Robert Kowalski, the first Prolog system was developed in 1972 by Colmerauer and Phillipe Roussel. The first implementation of Prolog was an interpreter written in Fortran by Gerard Battani and Henri Meloni. David H. D. Warren took this interpreter to the University of Edinburgh, and there implemented an alternative front-end, which came to define the &quot;Edinburgh Prolog&quot; syntax used by most modern implementations. Warren also implemented the first compiler for Prolog, creating the influential DEC-10 Prolog in collaboration with Fernando Pereira. Warren later generalised the ideas behind DEC-10 Prolog, to create the Warren Abstract Machine (WAM).

European AI researchers favored Prolog while Americans favored Lisp, reportedly causing many nationalistic debates on the merits of the languages. Much of the modern development of Prolog came from the impetus of the Fifth Generation Computer Systems project (FGCS), which developed a variant of Prolog named &quot;Kernel Language&quot; for its first operating system.

Pure Prolog was originally restricted to the use of a resolution theorem prover with Horn clauses of the form:

 H :- B1, ..., Bn.

The application of the theorem-prover treats such clauses as procedures:

 to show/solve H, show/solve B1 and ... and Bn.

Pure Prolog was soon extended, however, to include negation as failure, in which negative conditions of the form not(Bi) are shown by trying and failing to solve the corresponding positive conditions Bi.

Subsequent extensions of Prolog by the original team introduced constraint logic programming abilities into the implementations.

=== Impact ===
Although Prolog is widely used in research and education, Prolog and other logic programming languages have not had a significant impact on the computer industry in general. Most applications are small by industrial standards, with few exceeding 100,000 lines of code. Programming in the large is considered to be complex because not all Prolog compilers support modules, and there are compatibility problems between the module systems of the major Prolog compilers. Portability of Prolog code across implementations has also been a problem, but developments since 2007 have meant: &quot;the portability within the family of Edinburgh/Quintus derived Prolog implementations is good enough to allow for maintaining portable real-world applications.&quot;

Software developed in Prolog has been criticised for having a high performance penalty compared to conventional programming languages. In particular, Prolog&#x27;s non-deterministic evaluation strategy can be problematic when programming deterministic computations, or when even using &quot;don&#x27;t care non-determinism&quot; (where a single choice is made instead of backtracking over all possibilities). Cuts and other language constructs may have to be used to achieve desirable performance, destroying one of Prolog&#x27;s main attractions, the ability to run programs &quot;backwards and forwards&quot;.

Prolog is not purely declarative: because of constructs like the cut operator, a procedural reading of a Prolog program is needed to understand it. The order of clauses in a Prolog program is significant, as the execution strategy of the language depends on it. Other logic programming languages, such as Datalog, are truly declarative but restrict the language. As a result, many practical Prolog programs are written to conform to Prolog&#x27;s depth-first search order, rather than as purely declarative logic programs.

=== Use in industry ===
Prolog has been used in Watson. Watson uses IBM&#x27;s DeepQA software and the Apache UIMA (Unstructured Information Management Architecture) framework. The system was written in various languages, including Java, , and Prolog, and runs on the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 operating system using Apache Hadoop framework to provide distributed computing. Prolog is used for pattern matching over natural language parse trees. The developers have stated: &quot;We required a language in which we could conveniently express pattern matching rules over the parse trees and other annotations (such as named entity recognition results), and a technology that could execute these rules very efficiently. We found that Prolog was the ideal choice for the language due to its simplicity and expressiveness.&quot; Prolog is being used in the Low-Code Development Platform GeneXus, which is focused around AI. Open source graph database TerminusDB is implemented in Prolog. TerminusDB is designed for collaboratively building and curating knowledge graphs.

== Syntax and semantics ==

In Prolog, program logic is expressed in terms of relations, and a computation is initiated by running a &quot;query&quot; over these relations. Relations and queries are constructed using Prolog&#x27;s single data type, the &quot;term&quot;. Relations are defined by &quot;clauses&quot;. Given a query, the Prolog engine attempts to find a resolution refutation of the negated query. If the negated query can be refuted, i.e., an instantiation for all free variables is found that makes the union of clauses and the singleton set consisting of the negated query false, it follows that the original query, with the found instantiation applied, is a logical consequence of the program. This makes Prolog (and other logic programming languages) particularly useful for database, symbolic mathematics, and language parsing applications. Because Prolog allows impure predicates, checking the truth value of certain special predicates may have some deliberate side effect, such as printing a value to the screen. Because of this, the programmer is permitted to use some amount of conventional imperative programming when the logical paradigm is inconvenient. It has a purely logical subset, called &quot;pure Prolog&quot;, as well as a number of extralogical features.

=== Data types ===
Prolog&#x27;s single data type is the &quot;term&quot;. Terms are either &quot;atoms&quot;, &quot;numbers&quot;, &quot;variables&quot; or &quot;compound terms&quot;.
* An atom is a symbol name starting with a lower case letter or guarded by quotes. Examples of atoms include codice_1, codice_2, codice_3, codice_4, and codice_5.
* Numbers can be floats or integers. Most of the major Prolog systems support arbitrary length integer numbers.
* Variables are denoted by a string consisting of letters, numbers and underscore characters, and beginning with an upper-case letter or underscore. Variables closely resemble variables in logic in that they are placeholders for arbitrary terms.
* A compound term is composed of an atom called a &quot;functor&quot; and a number of &quot;arguments&quot;, which are again terms. Compound terms are ordinarily written as a functor followed by a comma-separated list of argument terms, which is contained in parentheses. The number of arguments is called the term&#x27;s arity. An atom can be regarded as a compound term with arity zero. An example of a compound term is codice_6.

Special cases of compound terms:
* A &quot;List&quot; is an ordered collection of terms. It is denoted by square brackets with the terms separated by commas, or in the case of the empty list, by codice_7. For example, codice_8 or codice_9.
* &quot;Strings&quot;: A sequence of characters surrounded by quotes is equivalent to either a list of (numeric) character codes, a list of characters (atoms of length 1), or an atom depending on the value of the Prolog flag codice_10. For example, codice_11.

=== Rules and facts ===
Prolog programs describe relations, defined by means of clauses. Pure Prolog is restricted to Horn clauses. Two types of Horn clauses are used to define Prolog programs: rules and facts. A rule is of the form
Head :- Body.
and is read as &quot;Head is true if Body is true&quot;. A rule&#x27;s body consists of calls to predicates, which are called the rule&#x27;s goals. The built-in logical operator codice_12 (meaning an arity 2 operator with name codice_13) denotes conjunction of goals, and codice_14 denotes disjunction. Conjunctions and disjunctions can only appear in the body, not in the head of a rule.

Clauses with empty bodies are called facts. An example of a fact is:
human(socrates).
which is equivalent to the rule:
human(socrates) :- true.

The built-in predicate codice_15 is always true.

Given the above fact, one can ask:

&quot;is socrates a human?&quot;
 ?- human(socrates).
 Yes
&quot;what things are humans?&quot;
 ?- human(X).
 X = socrates
Clauses with bodies are called rules. An example of a rule is:

mortal(X) :- human(X).

If we add that rule and ask &quot;what things are mortals?&quot;
 ?- mortal(X).
 X = socrates
=== Predicates and programs ===

A &quot;predicate&quot; (or &quot;procedure definition&quot;) is a collection of clauses whose heads have the same name and arity. We use the notation &quot;name/arity&quot; to refer to predicates. A &quot;logic program&quot; is a set of predicates. For example, the following Prolog program, which defines some family relations, has four predicates: 
mother_child(trude, sally).

father_child(tom, sally).
father_child(tom, erica).
father_child(mike, tom).

sibling(X, Y) :- parent_child(Z, X), parent_child(Z, Y).

parent_child(X, Y) :- father_child(X, Y).
parent_child(X, Y) :- mother_child(X, Y).
Predicate codice_16 has three clauses, all of which are facts, and predicate codice_17 has two clauses, both are rules.

Due to the relational nature of many built-in predicates, they can typically be used in several directions. For example, codice_18 can be used to determine the length of a list (codice_19, given a list codice_20), and to generate a list skeleton of a given length (codice_21), and to generate both list skeletons and their lengths together (codice_22). Similarly, codice_23 can be used both to append two lists (codice_24 given lists codice_25 and codice_26), and to split a given list into parts (codice_27, given a list codice_20). For this reason, a comparatively small set of library predicates suffices for many Prolog programs.

As a general purpose language, Prolog also provides various built-in predicates to perform routine activities like input/output, using graphics and otherwise communicating with the operating system. These predicates are not given a relational meaning and are only useful for the side-effects they exhibit on the system. For example, the predicate codice_29 displays a term on the screen.

=== Loops and recursion ===
Iterative algorithms can be implemented by means of recursive predicates.

Consider the codice_17 predicate defined in the family relation program above. The following Prolog program defines the &quot;ancestor&quot; relation:
ancestor(X, Y) :- parent_child(X, Y).
ancestor(X, Y) :- parent_child(X, Z), ancestor(Z, Y).
It expresses that X is an ancestor of Y if X is parent of Y or X is parent of an ancestor of Y. It is recursive because it is defined in terms of itself (there is a call to predicate codice_31 in the body of the second clause). 

=== Execution ===

Execution of a Prolog program is initiated by the user&#x27;s posting of a single goal, called the query. Logically, the Prolog engine tries to find a resolution refutation of the negated query. The resolution method used by Prolog is called SLD resolution. If the negated query can be refuted, it follows that the query, with the appropriate variable bindings in place, is a logical consequence of the program. In that case, all generated variable bindings are reported to the user, and the query is said to have succeeded. Operationally, Prolog&#x27;s execution strategy can be thought of as a generalization of function calls in other languages, one difference being that multiple clause heads can match a given call. In that case, the system creates a choice-point, unifies the goal with the clause head of the first alternative, and continues with the goals of that first alternative. If any goal fails in the course of executing the program, all variable bindings that were made since the most recent choice-point was created are undone, and execution continues with the next alternative of that choice-point. This execution strategy is called chronological backtracking. For example, given the family relation program defined above, the following query will be evaluated to true:

 ?- sibling(sally, erica).
 Yes
This is obtained as follows: Initially, the only matching clause-head for the query codice_32 is the first one, so proving the query is equivalent to proving the body of that clause with the appropriate variable bindings in place, i.e., the conjunction codice_33. The next goal to be proved is the leftmost one of this conjunction, i.e., codice_34. Two clause heads match this goal. The system creates a choice-point and tries the first alternative, whose body is codice_35. This goal can be proved using the fact codice_36, so the binding codice_37 is generated, and the next goal to be proved is the second part of the above conjunction: codice_38. Again, this can be proved by the corresponding fact. Since all goals could be proved, the query succeeds. Since the query contained no variables, no bindings are reported to the user. A query with variables, like:
?- father_child(Father, Child).

enumerates all valid answers on backtracking.

Notice that with the code as stated above, the query codice_39 also succeeds. One would insert additional goals to describe the relevant restrictions, if desired.

=== Negation ===
The built-in Prolog predicate codice_40 provides negation as failure, which allows for non-monotonic reasoning. The goal codice_41 in the rule

legal(X) :- \+ illegal(X).

is evaluated as follows: Prolog attempts to prove codice_42. If a proof for that goal can be found, the original goal (i.e., codice_41) fails. If no proof can be found, the original goal succeeds. Therefore, the codice_40 prefix operator is called the &quot;not provable&quot; operator, since the query codice_45 succeeds if Goal is not provable. This kind of negation is sound if its argument is &quot;ground&quot; (i.e. contains no variables). Soundness is lost if the argument contains variables and the proof procedure is complete. In particular, the query codice_46 now cannot be used to enumerate all things that are legal.

== Programming in Prolog ==
In Prolog, loading code is referred to as &quot;consulting&quot;. Prolog can be used interactively by entering queries at the Prolog prompt codice_47. If there is no solution, Prolog writes codice_48. If a solution exists then it is printed. If there are multiple solutions to the query, then these can be requested by entering a semi-colon codice_49. There are guidelines on good programming practice to improve code efficiency, readability and maintainability.

Here follow some example programs written in Prolog.

=== Hello World ===
Example of a basic query in a couple of popular Prolog dialects:
This comparison shows the prompt (&quot;?-&quot; vs &quot;| ?-&quot;) and resolution status (&quot;true&quot;. vs &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;false&quot;. vs &quot;no&quot;) can differ from one Prolog implementation to another.

=== Compiler optimization ===
Any computation can be expressed declaratively as a sequence of state transitions. As an example, an optimizing compiler with three optimization passes could be implemented as a relation between an initial program and its optimized form:

program_optimized(Prog0, Prog) :-
 optimization_pass_1(Prog0, Prog1),
 optimization_pass_2(Prog1, Prog2),
 optimization_pass_3(Prog2, Prog).

or equivalently using DCG notation:

program_optimized --&gt; optimization_pass_1, optimization_pass_2, optimization_pass_3.
=== Quicksort ===
The quicksort sorting algorithm, relating a list to its sorted version:

partition([], _, [], []).
partition([X|Xs], Pivot, Smalls, Bigs) :-
 ( X @&lt; Pivot -&gt;
 Smalls = [X|Rest],
 partition(Xs, Pivot, Rest, Bigs)
 ; Bigs = [X|Rest],
 partition(Xs, Pivot, Smalls, Rest)

quicksort([]) --&gt; [].
quicksort([X|Xs]) --&gt;
 { partition(Xs, X, Smaller, Bigger) },
 quicksort(Smaller), [X], quicksort(Bigger).
== Design patterns of Prolog ==
A design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. Some design patterns in Prolog are skeletons, techniques, cliches, program schemata, logic description schemata, and higher-order programming.

== Higher-order programming ==

A higher-order predicate is a predicate that takes one or more other predicates as arguments. Although support for higher-order programming takes Prolog outside the domain of first-order logic, which does not allow quantification over predicates, ISO Prolog now has some built-in higher-order predicates such as codice_50, codice_51, codice_52, codice_53, codice_54, and codice_55. Furthermore, since arbitrary Prolog goals can be constructed and evaluated at run-time, it is easy to write higher-order predicates like codice_56, which applies an arbitrary predicate to each member of a given list, and codice_57, which filters elements that satisfy a given predicate, also allowing for currying.

To convert solutions from temporal representation (answer substitutions on backtracking) to spatial representation (terms), Prolog has various all-solutions predicates that collect all answer substitutions of a given query in a list. This can be used for list comprehension. For example, perfect numbers equal the sum of their proper divisors:

 perfect(N) :-
 between(1, inf, N), U is N // 2,
 findall(D, (between(1,U,D), N mod D =:= 0), Ds),
 sumlist(Ds, N).

This can be used to enumerate perfect numbers, and to check if a number is perfect.

As another example, the predicate codice_58 applies a predicate codice_59 to all corresponding positions in a pair of lists:

maplist(_, [], []).
maplist(P, [X|Xs], [Y|Ys]) :-
 call(P, X, Y),
 maplist(P, Xs, Ys).
When codice_59 is a predicate that for all codice_61, codice_62 unifies codice_63 with a single unique value, codice_64 is equivalent to applying the map function in functional programming as codice_65.

Higher-order programming style in Prolog was pioneered in HiLog and λProlog.

== Modules ==
For programming in the large, Prolog provides a module system, which is in the ISO Standard.
However, while most Prolog systems support structuring the code into modules, virtually no implementation adheres to the modules part of the ISO standard. Instead, most Prolog systems have decided to support as &quot;de-facto&quot; module standard the Quintus/SICStus module system. However, further convenience predicates concerning modules are provided by some implementations only and often have subtle differences in their semantics.

Some systems chose to implement module concepts as source-to-source compilation into base ISO Prolog, as is the case of Logtalk. GNU Prolog initially diverted from ISO modules, opting instead for Contextual Logic Programming, in which unit (module) loading and unloading can be made dynamically. Ciao designed a strict module system that, while being basically compatible with the &quot;de-facto&quot; standard used by other Prolog systems, is amenable to precise static analysis, supports term hiding, and facilitates programming in the large. XSB takes a different approach and offers an &quot;atom-based&quot; module system. The latter two Prolog systems allow controlling the &quot;visibility of terms&quot; in addition to that of predicates.

== Parsing ==

There is a special notation called definite clause grammars (DCGs). A rule defined via codice_66 instead of codice_67 is expanded by the preprocessor (codice_68, a facility analogous to macros in other languages) according to a few straightforward rewriting rules, resulting in ordinary Prolog clauses. Most notably, the rewriting equips the predicate with two additional arguments, which can be used to implicitly thread state around, analogous to monads in other languages. DCGs are often used to write parsers or list generators, as they also provide a convenient interface to difference lists.

== Meta-interpreters and reflection ==
Prolog is a homoiconic language and provides many facilities for reflective programming (reflection). Its implicit execution strategy makes it possible to write a concise meta-circular evaluator (also called &quot;meta-interpreter&quot;) for pure Prolog code:

solve(true).
solve((Subgoal1,Subgoal2)) :-
 solve(Subgoal1),
 solve(Subgoal2).
solve(Head) :-
 clause(Head, Body),
 solve(Body).

where codice_69 represents an empty conjunction, and codice_70 unifies with clauses in the database of the form codice_71.

Since Prolog programs are themselves sequences of Prolog terms (codice_67 is an infix operator) that are easily read and inspected using built-in mechanisms (like codice_73), it is possible to write customized interpreters that augment Prolog with domain-specific features. For example, Sterling and Shapiro present a meta-interpreter that performs reasoning with uncertainty, reproduced here with slight modifications:

solve(true, 1) :- !.
solve((Subgoal1,Subgoal2), Certainty) :-
 solve(Subgoal1, Certainty1),
 solve(Subgoal2, Certainty2),
 Certainty is min(Certainty1, Certainty2).
solve(Goal, 1) :-
 builtin(Goal), !,
 Goal.
solve(Head, Certainty) :-
 clause_cf(Head, Body, Certainty1),
 solve(Body, Certainty2),
 Certainty is Certainty1 * Certainty2.
This interpreter uses a table of built-in Prolog predicates of the form

builtin(A is B).
builtin(read(X)).
% etc.

and clauses represented as codice_74. Given those, it can be called as codice_75 to execute codice_76 and obtain a measure of certainty about the result.

== Turing completeness ==
Pure Prolog is based on a subset of first-order predicate logic, Horn clauses, which is Turing-complete. Turing completeness of Prolog can be shown by using it to simulate a Turing machine:

turing(Tape0, Tape) :-
 perform(q0, [], Ls, Tape0, Rs),
 reverse(Ls, Ls1),
 append(Ls1, Rs, Tape).

perform(qf, Ls, Ls, Rs, Rs) :- !.
perform(Q0, Ls0, Ls, Rs0, Rs) :-
 symbol(Rs0, Sym, RsRest),
 once(rule(Q0, Sym, Q1, NewSym, Action)),

A simple example Turing machine is specified by the facts:

rule(q0, 1, q0, 1, right).
rule(q0, b, qf, 1, stay).
This machine performs incrementation by one of a number in unary encoding: It loops over any number of &quot;1&quot; cells and appends an additional &quot;1&quot; at the end. Example query and result:

?- turing([1,1,1], Ts).
Ts = [1, 1, 1, 1] ;
This illustrates how any computation can be expressed declaratively as a sequence of state transitions, implemented in Prolog as a relation between successive states of interest.

== Implementation ==
=== ISO Prolog ===
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Prolog technical standard consists of two parts. ISO/IEC 13211-1, published in 1995, aims to standardize the existing practices of the many implementations of the core elements of Prolog. It has clarified aspects of the language that were previously ambiguous and leads to portable programs. There are three corrigenda: Cor.1:2007, Cor.2:2012, and Cor.3:2017. ISO/IEC 13211-2, published in 2000, adds support for modules to the standard. The standard is maintained by the ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG17 working group. ANSI X3J17 is the US Technical Advisory Group for the standard.

=== Compilation ===
For efficiency, Prolog code is typically compiled to abstract machine code, often influenced by the register-based Warren Abstract Machine (WAM) instruction set. Some implementations employ abstract interpretation to derive type and mode information of predicates at compile time, or compile to real machine code for high performance. Devising efficient implementation methods for Prolog code is a field of active research in the logic programming community, and various other execution methods are employed in some implementations. These include clause binarization and stack-based virtual machines.

=== Tail recursion ===
Prolog systems typically implement a well-known optimization method called tail call optimization (TCO) for deterministic predicates exhibiting tail recursion or, more generally, tail calls: A clause&#x27;s stack frame is discarded before performing a call in a tail position. Therefore, deterministic tail-recursive predicates are executed with constant stack space, like loops in other languages.

=== Term indexing ===

Finding clauses that are unifiable with a term in a query is linear in the number of clauses. Term indexing uses a data structure that enables sub-linear-time lookups. Indexing only affects program performance, it does not affect semantics. Most Prologs only use indexing on the first term, as indexing on all terms is expensive, but techniques based on &quot;field-encoded words&quot; or &quot;superimposed codewords&quot; provide fast indexing across the full query and head.

=== Hashing ===
Some Prolog systems, such as WIN-PROLOG and SWI-Prolog, now implement hashing to help handle large datasets more efficiently. This tends to yield very large performance gains when working with large corpora such as WordNet.

=== Tabling ===

Some Prolog systems, (B-Prolog, XSB, SWI-Prolog, YAP, and Ciao), implement a memoization method called &quot;tabling&quot;, which frees the user from manually storing intermediate results. Tabling is a space–time tradeoff; execution time can be reduced by using more memory to store intermediate results:
Subgoals encountered in a query evaluation are maintained in a table, along with answers to these subgoals. If a subgoal is re-encountered, the evaluation reuses information from the table rather than re-performing resolution against program clauses.
Tabling can be extended in various directions. It can support recursive predicates through SLG resolution or linear tabling. In a multi-threaded Prolog system tabling results could be kept private to a thread or shared among all threads. And in incremental tabling, tabling might react to changes.

=== Implementation in hardware ===
During the Fifth Generation Computer Systems project, there were attempts to implement Prolog in hardware with the aim of achieving faster execution with dedicated architectures. Furthermore, Prolog has a number of properties that may allow speed-up through parallel execution. A more recent approach has been to compile restricted Prolog programs to a field programmable gate array. However, rapid progress in general-purpose hardware has consistently overtaken more specialised architectures.

In 1982, computers operated at around 10,000 to 100,000 LIPS [logical inferences per second]. The FGCS planned to produce computers operating at 0.1 to 1 GLIPS. The Institute for New Generation Computer Technology documents estimated that 1 LIP took about 100 operations on a conventional computer. The plan was to produce at the end of the project (in 1992) a machine with 1000 processors achieving 1 GLIPS, implying at least 1 MLIPS per processor.

Sega implemented Prolog for use with the Sega AI Computer, released for the Japanese market in 1986. Prolog was used for reading natural language inputs, in the Japanese language, via a touch pad.

== Extensions ==
Various implementations have been developed from Prolog to extend logic programming abilities in many directions. These include types, modes, constraint logic programming (CLP), object-oriented logic programming (OOLP), concurrency, linear logic (LLP), functional and higher-order logic programming abilities, plus interoperability with knowledge bases:

=== Types ===
Prolog is an untyped language. Attempts to introduce and extend Prolog with types began in the 1980s, and continue . Type information is useful not only for type safety but also for reasoning about Prolog programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;cite doi|10.1007/BF01213601&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modes ===

The syntax of Prolog does not specify which arguments of a predicate are inputs and which are outputs. However, this information is significant and it is recommended that it be included in the comments. Modes provide valuable information when reasoning about Prolog programs and can also be used to accelerate execution.

=== Constraints ===
Constraint logic programming extends Prolog to include concepts from constraint satisfaction. A constraint logic program allows constraints in the body of clauses, such as: codice_77 It is suited to large-scale combinatorial optimisation problems and is thus useful for applications in industrial settings, such as automated time-tabling and production scheduling. Most Prolog systems ship with at least one constraint solver for finite domains, and often also with solvers for other domains like rational numbers.

=== Object-orientation ===
Flora-2 is an object-oriented knowledge representation and reasoning system based on F-logic and incorporates HiLog, Transaction logic, and defeasible reasoning.

Logtalk is an object-oriented logic programming language that can use most Prolog implementations as a back-end compiler. As a multi-paradigm language, it includes support for both prototypes and classes.

Oblog is a small, portable, object-oriented extension to Prolog by Margaret McDougall of EdCAAD, University of Edinburgh.

Objlog was a frame-based language combining objects and Prolog II from CNRS, Marseille, France.

Prolog++ was developed by Logic Programming Associates and first released in 1989 for MS-DOS PCs. Support for other platforms was added, and a second version was released in 1995. A book about Prolog++ by Chris Moss was published by Addison-Wesley in 1994.

Visual Prolog is a multi-paradigm language with interfaces, classes, implementations and object expressions.

=== Graphics ===
Prolog systems that provide a graphics library are SWI-Prolog, Visual Prolog, WIN-PROLOG, and B-Prolog.

=== Concurrency ===
Prolog-MPI is an open-source SWI-Prolog extension for distributed computing over the Message Passing Interface. Also there are various concurrent Prolog programming languages.

=== Web programming ===
Some Prolog implementations, notably Visual Prolog, SWI-Prolog and Ciao, support server-side web programming with support for web protocols, HTML and XML. There are also extensions to support semantic web formats such as Resource Description Framework (RDF) and Web Ontology Language (OWL). Prolog has also been suggested as a client-side language. In addition, Visual Prolog supports JSON-RPC and Websockets.

=== Adobe Flash ===
Cedar is a free and basic Prolog interpreter. From version 4 and above Cedar has a FCA (Flash Cedar App) support. This provides a new platform to programming in Prolog through ActionScript.

=== Other ===
* F-logic extends Prolog with frames/objects for knowledge representation.
* Transaction logic extends Prolog with a logical theory of state-changing update operators. It has both a model-theoretic and procedural semantics.
* OW Prolog has been created in order to answer Prolog&#x27;s lack of graphics and interface.

== Interfaces to other languages ==
Frameworks exist which can bridge between Prolog and other languages:
* The LPA Intelligence Server allows embedding LPA Prolog for Windows in other programming languages, including: C, , C#, Java, Visual Basic (VB), Delphi, .NET, Lua, Python, and others. It exploits the dedicated string data type which LPA Prolog provides
* The Logic Server Application Programming Interface (API) allows both the extension and embedding of Prolog in C, , Java, Visual Basic (VB), Delphi, .NET, and any language or environment which can call a .dll or .so. It is implemented for Amzi! Prolog + Logic Server but the API specification can be made available for any implementation.
* JPL is a bi-directional Java Prolog bridge which ships with SWI-Prolog by default, allowing Java and Prolog to call each other (recursively). It is known to have good concurrency support and is under active development.
* InterProlog, a programming library bridge between Java and Prolog, implementing bi-directional predicate/method calling between both languages. Java objects can be mapped into Prolog terms and vice versa. Allows the development of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and other functions in Java while leaving logic processing in the Prolog layer. Supports XSB and SWI-Prolog.
* Prova provides native syntax integration with Java, agent messaging and reaction rules. Prova positions itself as a rule-based scripting (RBS) system for middleware. The language breaks new ground in combining imperative and declarative programming.
* PROL An embeddable Prolog engine for Java. It includes a small IDE and a few libraries.
* GNU Prolog for Java is an implementation of ISO Prolog as a Java library (gnu.prolog)
* Ciao provides interfaces to C, , Java, and relational databases.
* C#-Prolog is a Prolog interpreter written in (managed) C#. Can easily be integrated in C# programs. Characteristics: reliable and fairly fast interpreter, command line interface, Windows-interface, builtin DCG, XML-predicates, SQL-predicates, extendible. The complete source code is available, including a parser generator that can be used for adding special purpose extensions.
* A Warren Abstract Machine for PHP A Prolog compiler and interpreter in PHP 5.3. A library that can be used standalone or within Symfony2.1 framework which was translated from Stephan Buettcher&#x27;s work in Java which can be found [here ]
* tuProlog is a lightweight Prolog system for distributed applications and infrastructures, intentionally designed around a minimal core, to be either statically or dynamically configured by loading/unloading libraries of predicates. tuProlog natively supports multi-paradigm programming, providing a clean, seamless integration model between Prolog and mainstream object-oriented languages, namely Java, for tuProlog Java version, and any .NET-based language (C#, F#..), for tuProlog .NET version.
* Janus is a bi-directional interface between Prolog and Python using portable low-level primitives. It was initially developed for XSB by Anderson and Swift, but has been adopted as a joint initiative by the XSB, Ciao and SWI-Prolog teams.

<doc id="23486" wikidata="Q455938" url="?curid=23486" title="Phil Zimmermann">
<text>Philip R. Zimmermann (born 1954) is an American computer scientist and cryptographer. He is the creator of Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), the most widely used email encryption software in the world. He is also known for his work in VoIP encryption protocols, notably ZRTP and Zfone. Zimmermann is co-founder and Chief Scientist of the global encrypted communications firm Silent Circle.

==Background==
Zimmermann was born in Camden, New Jersey. He received a B.S. degree in computer science from Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, Florida, in 1978. In the 1980s, he worked in Boulder, Colorado, as a software engineer on the Nuclear Weapons Freeze Campaign as a military policy analyst. From 2016 to 2021, he worked at Delft University of Technology as an Associate Professor in the Cybersecurity section at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, and Computer Science.

==PGP==
In 1991, he wrote the popular Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) program, and made it available (together with its source code) through public FTP for download, the first widely available program implementing public-key cryptography. Shortly thereafter, it became available overseas via the Internet, though Zimmermann has said he had no part in its distribution outside the United States.

The very first version of PGP included an encryption algorithm, BassOmatic, developed by Zimmermann.

===Arms Export Control Act investigation===
After a report from RSA Security, who were in a licensing dispute with regard to the use of the RSA algorithm in PGP, the United States Customs Service started a criminal investigation of Zimmermann, for allegedly violating the Arms Export Control Act. The United States Government had long regarded cryptographic software as a munition, and thus subject to arms trafficking export controls. At that time, PGP was considered to be impermissible (&quot;high-strength&quot;) for export from the United States. The maximum strength allowed for legal export has since been raised and now allows PGP to be exported. The investigation lasted three years, but was finally dropped without filing charges after MIT Press published the source code of PGP. 

In 1995, Zimmermann published the book &quot;PGP Source Code and Internals&quot; as a way to bypass limitations on exporting digital code. Zimmermann&#x27;s introduction says the book contains &quot;all of the C source code to a software package called PGP&quot; and that the unusual publication in book form of the complete source code for a computer program was a direct response to the U.S. government&#x27;s criminal investigation of Zimmermann for violations of U.S. export restrictions as a result of the international spread of PGP&#x27;s use.

After the government dropped its case without indictment in early 1996, Zimmermann founded PGP Inc. and released an updated version of PGP and some additional related products. That company was acquired by Network Associates (NAI) in December 1997, and Zimmermann stayed on for three years as a Senior Fellow. NAI decided to drop the product line and in 2002, PGP was acquired from NAI by a new company called PGP Corporation. Zimmermann served as a special advisor and consultant to that firm until Symantec acquired PGP Corporation in 2010. Zimmermann is also a fellow at the Stanford Law School&#x27;s Center for Internet and Society. He was a principal designer of the cryptographic key agreement protocol (the &quot;association model&quot;) for the Wireless USB standard.

== Silent Circle ==
Along with Mike Janke and Jon Callas, in 2012 he co-founded Silent Circle, a secure hardware and subscription based software security company.

== Dark Mail Alliance ==
In October 2013, Zimmermann, along with other key employees from Silent Circle, teamed up with Lavabit founder Ladar Levison to create the Dark Mail Alliance. The goal of the organization is to work on a new protocol to replace PGP that will encrypt email metadata, among other things that PGP is not capable of.

== Okuna ==
Zimmermann was also involved in the social network Okuna, formerly Openbook, which aimed to be an ethical and privacy-friendly alternative to existing social networks, especially Facebook. He sees today&#x27;s established social media platforms as a threat to democracy and privacy, because of their profit-oriented revenue models that &quot;are all about exploiting our personal information&quot; and &quot;[deepen] the political divides in our culture&quot;, and hoped Okuna would help solve these problems.

==Zimmermann&#x27;s Law==
In 2013, an article on &quot;Zimmermann&#x27;s Law&quot; quoted Phil Zimmermann as saying &quot;The natural flow of technology tends to move in the direction of making surveillance easier&quot;, and &quot;the ability of computers to track us doubles every eighteen months&quot;, in reference to Moore&#x27;s law.

==Awards and other recognition==
Zimmermann has received numerous technical and humanitarian awards for his pioneering work in cryptography:
* In 2018, Zimmermann was inducted into Information Systems Security Association (ISSA) hall of fame by the ISSA International Organization on October 16, 2018.
* In 2016, Zimmermann was awarded a honorary doctorate from the Université libre de Bruxelles 
* In 2012, Zimmermann was inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame by the Internet Society.
* In 2008, &quot;PC World&quot; named Zimmermann one of the &quot;Top 50 Tech Visionaries&quot; of the last 50 years.
* In 2006, eWeek ranked PGP 9th in the 25 Most Influential and Innovative Products introduced since the invention of the PC in 1981.
* In 2003, &quot;Reason&quot; named him a &quot;Hero of Freedom&quot;
* In 2001, Zimmermann was inducted into the CRN Industry Hall of Fame.
* In 2000, InfoWorld named him one of the &quot;Top 10 Innovators in E-business&quot;.
* In 1999, he received the Louis Brandeis Award from Privacy International.
* In 1998, he received a Lifetime Achievement Award from &quot;Secure Computing Magazine&quot;.
* In 1996, he received the Norbert Wiener Award for Social and Professional Responsibility for promoting the responsible use of technology.
* In 1996, he received the Thomas S. Szasz Award for Outstanding Contributions to the Cause of Civil Liberties from the Center for Independent Thought.
* In 1995, he received the Chrysler Design Award for Innovation, and the Pioneer Award from the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
* In 1995, &quot;Newsweek&quot; also named Zimmermann one of the &quot;Net 50&quot;, the 50 most influential people on the Internet.

Simon Singh&#x27;s &quot;The Code Book&quot; devotes an entire chapter to Zimmermann and PGP. In 2022 Steven Johnson covered his story and achievements in Zimmermann&#x27;s profile for Hidden Heroes - The Crypto Wars: How Philip Zimmermann Fought for Our Right to Privacy.

<doc id="23490" wikidata="Q210918" url="?curid=23490" title="Political spectrum">
<text>A political spectrum is a system to characterize and classify different political positions in relation to one another. These positions sit upon one or more geometric axes that represent independent political dimensions. The expressions political compass and political map are used to refer to the political spectrum as well, especially to popular two-dimensional models of it.

Most long-standing spectra include the left–right dimension as a measure of social, political and economic hierarchy which originally referred to seating arrangements in the French parliament after the Revolution (1789–1799), with radicals on the left and aristocrats on the right. While communism and socialism are usually regarded internationally as being on the left, conservatism and reactionism are generally regarded as being on the right. Liberalism can mean different things in different contexts, being sometimes on the left (social liberalism) and other times on the right (conservative liberalism or classical liberalism). Those with an intermediate outlook are sometimes classified as centrists. Politics that rejects the conventional left–right spectrum is often known as syncretic politics. This form of politics has been criticized as tending to mischaracterize positions that have a logical location on a two-axis spectrum because they seem randomly brought together on a one-axis left–right spectrum.

Some political scientists have noted that a single left–right axis is too simplistic and insufficient for describing the existing variation in political beliefs and include other axes to compensate for this problem. Although the descriptive words at polar opposites may vary, the axes of popular biaxial spectra are usually split between economic issues (on a left–right dimension) and socio-cultural issues (on an authority–liberty dimension).

== Historical origin of the terms ==

The terms &quot;right&quot; and &quot;left&quot; refer to political affiliations originating early in the French Revolutionary era of 1789–1799 and referred originally to the seating arrangements in the various legislative bodies of France. As seen from the Speaker&#x27;s seat at the front of the Assembly, the aristocracy sat on the right (traditionally the seat of honor) and the commoners sat on the left, hence the terms right-wing politics and left-wing politics.

Originally, the defining point on the ideological spectrum was the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot; (&quot;old order&quot;). &quot;The Right&quot; thus implied support for aristocratic or royal interests and the church, while &quot;The Left&quot; implied support for republicanism, secularism and civil liberties.

== Academic investigation ==

For almost a century, social scientists have considered the problem of how to best describe political variation.

=== Leonard W. Ferguson ===
In 1950, Leonard W. Ferguson analyzed political values using ten scales measuring attitudes toward: birth control, capital punishment, censorship, communism, evolution, law, patriotism, theism, treatment of criminals and war. Submitting the results to factor analysis, he was able to identify three factors, which he named religionism, humanitarianism and nationalism. He defined religionism as belief in God and negative attitudes toward evolution and birth control; humanitarianism as being related to attitudes opposing war, capital punishment and harsh treatment of criminals; and nationalism as describing variation in opinions on censorship, law, patriotism and communism.

This system was derived empirically, as rather than devising a political model on purely theoretical grounds and testing it, Ferguson&#x27;s research was exploratory. As a result of this method, care must be taken in the interpretation of Ferguson&#x27;s three factors, as factor analysis will output an abstract factor whether an objectively real factor exists or not. Although replication of the nationalism factor was inconsistent, the finding of religionism and humanitarianism had a number of replications by Ferguson and others.

=== Hans Eysenck ===

Shortly afterward, Hans Eysenck began researching political attitudes in the United Kingdom. He believed that there was something essentially similar about the fascism of the National Socialists (Nazis) on the one hand and the communists on the other, despite their opposite positions on the left–right axis. As Hans Eysenck described in his 1956 book &quot;Sense and Nonsense in Psychology&quot;, Eysenck compiled a list of political statements found in newspapers and political tracts and asked subjects to rate their agreement or disagreement with each. Submitting this value questionnaire to the same process of factor analysis used by Ferguson, Eysenck drew out two factors, which he named &quot;Radicalism&quot; (R-factor) and &quot;Tender-Mindedness&quot; (T-factor).

Such analysis produces a factor whether or not it corresponds to a real-world phenomenon and so caution must be exercised in its interpretation. While Eysenck&#x27;s R-factor is easily identified as the classical &quot;left–right&quot; dimension, the T-factor (representing a factor drawn at right angles to the R-factor) is less intuitive, as high-scorers favored pacifism, racial equality, religious education and restrictions on abortion, while low-scorers had attitudes more friendly to militarism, harsh punishment, easier divorce laws and companionate marriage.

According to social scientist Bojan Todosijevic, radicalism was defined as positively viewing evolution theory, strikes, welfare state, mixed marriages, student protests, law reform, women&#x27;s liberation, United Nations, nudist camps, pop-music, modern art, immigration, abolishing private property, and rejection of patriotism. Conservatism was defined as positively viewing white superiority, birching, death penalty, antisemitism, opposition to nationalization of property, and birth control. Tender-mindedness was defined by moral training, inborn conscience, Bible truth, chastity, self-denial, pacifism, anti-discrimination, being against the death penalty and harsh treatment of criminals. Tough-mindedness was defined by compulsory sterilization, euthanasia, easier divorce laws, racism, antisemitism, compulsory military training, wife swapping, casual living, death penalty, and harsh treatment of criminals.
Despite the difference in methodology, location and theory, the results attained by Eysenck and Ferguson matched. Simply rotating Eysenck&#x27;s two factors 45 degrees renders the same factors of religionism and humanitarianism identified by Ferguson in America.

Eysenck&#x27;s dimensions of R and T were found by factor analyses of values in Germany and Sweden, France and Japan.

One interesting result Eysenck noted in his 1956 work was that in the United States and the United Kingdom, most of the political variance was subsumed by the left/right axis, while in France the T-axis was larger and in the Middle East the only dimension to be found was the T-axis: &quot;Among mid-Eastern Arabs it has been found that while the tough-minded/tender-minded dimension is still clearly expressed in the relationships observed between different attitudes, there is nothing that corresponds to the radical-conservative continuum&quot;.

==== Relationship between Eysenck&#x27;s political views and political research ====
Eysenck&#x27;s political views related to his research: Eysenck was an outspoken opponent of what he perceived as the authoritarian abuses of the left and right, and accordingly he believed that with this T axis he had found the link between Nazism and communism. According to Eysenck, members of both ideologies were tough-minded. Central to Eysenck&#x27;s thesis was the claim that tender-minded ideologies were democratic and friendly to human freedoms, while tough-minded ideologies were aggressive and authoritarian, a claim that is open to political criticism. In this context, Eysenck carried out studies on Nazism and communist groups, claiming to find members of both groups to be more &quot;dominant&quot; and more &quot;aggressive&quot; than control groups.

Eysenck left Nazi Germany to live in Britain and was not shy in attacking Stalinism, citing the antisemitic prejudices of the Russian government, the luxurious lifestyles of the Soviet Union leadership and the Orwellian &quot;doublethink&quot; of East Germany&#x27;s naming itself the German Democratic Republic despite being &quot;one of the most undemocratic regimes in the world today&quot;. While Eysenck was an opponent of Nazism, his relationship with fascist organizations was more complex. Eysenck himself lent theoretical support to the English National Party, which also opposed Hitlerite Nazism, and was interviewed in the first issue of their journal &quot;The Beacon&quot; in relation to his controversial views on relative intelligence between different races. At one point during the interview, Eysenck was asked whether or not he was of Jewish origin before the interviewer proceeded. His political allegiances were called into question by other researchers, notably Steven Rose, who alleged that his scientific research was used for political purposes.

==== Subsequent criticism of Eysenck&#x27;s research ====
Eysenck&#x27;s conception of tough-mindedness has been criticized for a number of reasons.
* Virtually no values were found to load only on the tough/tender dimension.
* The interpretation of tough-mindedness as a manifestation of &quot;authoritarian&quot; versus tender-minded &quot;democratic&quot; values was incompatible with the Frankfurt School&#x27;s single-axis model, which conceptualized authoritarianism as being a fundamental manifestation of conservatism and many researchers took issue with the idea of &quot;left-wing authoritarianism&quot;.
* The theory which Eysenck developed to explain individual variation in the observed dimensions, relating tough-mindedness to extroversion and psychoticism, returned ambiguous research results.
* Eysenck&#x27;s finding that Nazis and communists were more tough-minded than members of mainstream political movements was criticised on technical grounds by Milton Rokeach.
* Eysenck&#x27;s method of analysis involves the finding of an abstract dimension (a factor) that explains the spread of a given set of data (in this case, scores on a political survey). This abstract dimension may or may not correspond to a real material phenomenon and obvious problems arise when it is applied to human psychology. The second factor in such an analysis (such as Eysenck&#x27;s T-factor) is the second best explanation for the spread of the data, which is by definition drawn at right angles to the first factor. While the first factor, which describes the bulk of the variation in a set of data, is more likely to represent something objectively real, subsequent factors become more and more abstract. Thus one would expect to find a factor that roughly corresponds to &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot;, as this is the dominant framing for politics in our society, but the basis of Eysenck&#x27;s &quot;tough/tender-minded&quot; thesis (the second, T-factor) may well represent nothing beyond an abstract mathematical construct. Such a construct would be expected to appear in factor analysis whether or not it corresponded to something real, thus rendering Eysenck&#x27;s thesis unfalsifiable through factor analysis.

=== Milton Rokeach ===
Dissatisfied with Hans J. Eysenck&#x27;s work, Milton Rokeach developed his own two-axis model of political values in 1973, basing this on the ideas of freedom and equality, which he described in his book, &quot;The Nature of Human Values&quot;.

Rokeach claimed that the defining difference between the left and right was that the left stressed the importance of equality more than the right. Despite his criticisms of Eysenck&#x27;s tough–tender axis, Rokeach also postulated a basic similarity between communism and Nazism, claiming that these groups would not value freedom as greatly as more conventional social democrats, democratic socialists and capitalists would and he wrote that &quot;the two value model presented here most resembles Eysenck&#x27;s hypothesis&quot;.

To test this model, Rokeach and his colleagues used content analysis on works exemplifying Nazism (written by Adolf Hitler), communism (written by Vladimir Lenin), capitalism (by Barry Goldwater) and socialism (written by various authors). This method has been criticized for its reliance on the experimenter&#x27;s familiarity with the content under analysis and its dependence on the researcher&#x27;s particular political outlooks.

Multiple raters made frequency counts of sentences containing synonyms for a number of values identified by Rokeach—including freedom and equality—and Rokeach analyzed these results by comparing the relative frequency rankings of all the values for each of the four texts:
* Socialists (socialism) — freedom ranked 1st, equality ranked 2nd
* Hitler (Nazism) – freedom ranked 16th, equality ranked 17th
* Goldwater (capitalism) — freedom ranked 1st, equality ranked 16th
* Lenin (communism) — freedom ranked 17th, equality ranked 1st

Later studies using samples of American ideologues and American presidential inaugural addresses attempted to apply this model.

=== Later research ===
In further research, Eysenck refined his methodology to include more questions on economic issues. Doing this, he revealed a split in the left–right axis between social policy and economic policy, with a previously undiscovered dimension of socialism-capitalism (S-factor).

While factorially distinct from Eysenck&#x27;s previous R factor, the S-factor did positively correlate with the R-factor, indicating that a basic left–right or right–left tendency underlies both social values and economic values, although S tapped more into items discussing economic inequality and big business, while R relates more to the treatment of criminals and to sexual issues and military issues.

Another replication came from Ronald Inglehart&#x27;s research into national opinions based on the World Values Survey, although Inglehart&#x27;s research described the values of countries rather than individuals or groups of individuals within nations. Inglehart&#x27;s two-factor solution took the form of Ferguson&#x27;s original religionism and humanitarianism dimensions; Inglehart labelled them &quot;secularism–traditionalism&quot;, which covered issues of tradition and religion, like patriotism, abortion, euthanasia and the importance of obeying the law and authority figures, and &quot;survivalism – self expression&quot;, which measured issues like everyday conduct and dress, acceptance of diversity (including foreigners) and innovation and attitudes towards people with specific controversial lifestyles such as homosexuality and vegetarianism, as well as willingness to engage in political activism. See for Inglehart&#x27;s national chart.

Though not directly related to Eysenck&#x27;s research, evidence suggests there may be as many as 6 dimensions of political opinions in the United States and 10 dimensions in the United Kingdom. This conclusion was based on two large datasets and uses a Bayesian approach rather than the traditional factor analysis method.

== Other double-axis models ==
=== Greenberg and Jonas: left–right, ideological rigidity ===
In a 2003 &quot;Psychological Bulletin&quot; paper, Jeff Greenberg and Eva Jonas posit a model comprising the standard left–right axis and an axis representing ideological rigidity. For Greenberg and Jonas, ideological rigidity has &quot;much in common with the related concepts of dogmatism and authoritarianism&quot; and is characterized by &quot;believing in strong leaders and submission, preferring one&#x27;s own in-group, ethnocentrism and nationalism, aggression against dissidents, and control with the help of police and military&quot;. Greenberg and Jonas posit that high ideological rigidity can be motivated by &quot;particularly strong needs to reduce fear and uncertainty&quot; and is a primary shared characteristic of &quot;people who subscribe to any extreme government or ideology, whether it is right-wing or left-wing&quot;.

=== Inglehart: traditionalist–secular and self expressionist–survivalist ===

In its 4 January 2003 issue, &quot;The Economist&quot; discussed a chart, proposed by Ronald Inglehart and supported by the World Values Survey (associated with the University of Michigan), to plot cultural ideology onto two dimensions. On the y-axis it covered issues of tradition and religion, like patriotism, abortion, euthanasia and the importance of obeying the law and authority figures. At the bottom of the chart is the traditionalist position on issues like these (with loyalty to country and family and respect for life considered important), while at the top is the secular position. The x-axis deals with self-expression, issues like everyday conduct and dress, acceptance of diversity (including foreigners) and innovation, and attitudes towards people with specific controversial lifestyles such as vegetarianism, as well as willingness to engage in political activism. At the right of the chart is the open self-expressionist position, while at the left is its opposite position, which Inglehart calls survivalist. This chart not only has the power to map the values of individuals, but also to compare the values of people in different countries. Placed on this chart, European Union countries in continental Europe come out on the top right, Anglophone countries on the middle right, Latin American countries on the bottom right, African, Middle Eastern and South Asian countries on the bottom left and ex-Communist countries on the top left.

=== Pournelle: liberty–control, irrationalism–rationalism ===

This very distinct two-axis model was created by Jerry Pournelle in 1963 for his doctoral dissertation in political science. The Pournelle chart has liberty on one axis, with those on the left seeking freedom from control or protections for social deviance and those on the right emphasizing state authority or protections for norm enforcement (farthest right being state worship, farthest left being the idea of a state as the &quot;ultimate evil&quot;). The other axis is rationalism, defined here as the belief in planned social progress, with those higher up believing that there are problems with society that can be rationally solved and those lower down skeptical of such approaches.

=== Mitchell: &quot;Eight Ways to Run the Country&quot; ===

In 2006, Brian Patrick Mitchell identified four main political traditions in Anglo-American history based on their regard for &quot;kratos&quot; (defined as the use of force) and &quot;archē&quot; or &quot;archy&quot; (defined as the recognition of rank). Mitchell grounded the distinction of archy and kratos in the West&#x27;s historical experience of church and state, crediting the collapse of the Christian consensus on church and state with the appearance of four main divergent traditions in Western political thought:
* Republican constitutionalism = pro archy, anti kratos
* Libertarian individualism = anti archy, anti kratos
* Democratic progressivism = anti archy, pro kratos
* Plutocratic nationalism = pro archy, pro kratos

Mitchell charts these traditions graphically using a vertical axis as a scale of kratos/akrateia and a horizontal axis as a scale of archy/anarchy. He places democratic progressivism in the lower left, plutocratic nationalism in the lower right, republican constitutionalism in the upper right, and libertarian individualism in the upper left. The political left is therefore distinguished by its rejection of archy, while the political right is distinguished by its acceptance of archy. For Mitchell, anarchy is not the absence of government but the rejection of rank. Thus there can be both anti-government anarchists (Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;libertarian individualists&quot;) and pro-government anarchists (Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;democratic progressives&quot;, who favor the use of government force against social hierarchies such as patriarchy). Mitchell also distinguishes between left-wing anarchists and right-wing anarchists, whom Mitchell renames &quot;akratists&quot; for their opposition to the government&#x27;s use of force.

From the four main political traditions, Mitchell identifies eight distinct political perspectives diverging from a populist center. Four of these perspectives (Progressive, Individualist, Paleoconservative, and Neoconservative) fit squarely within the four traditions; four others (Paleolibertarian, Theoconservative, Communitarian, and Radical) fit between the traditions, being defined by their singular focus on rank or force.

=== Nolan: economic freedom, personal freedom ===
The Nolan Chart was created by libertarian David Nolan. This chart shows what he considers as &quot;economic freedom&quot; (issues like taxation, free trade and free enterprise) on the horizontal axis and what he considers as &quot;personal freedom&quot; (issues like drug legalization, abortion and the draft) on the vertical axis. This puts left-wingers in the left quadrant, libertarians in the top, centrists in the middle, right-wingers in the right and what Nolan originally named populists in the bottom. Several popular online tests, where individuals can self-identify their political values, utilize the same two axes as the Nolan Chart, including The Political Compass, iSideWith.com and MapMyPolitics.org.

== Spatial model ==

The spatial model of voting plots voters and candidates in a multi-dimensional space where each dimension represents a single political issue sub-component of an issue, or candidate attribute. Voters are then modeled as having an &quot;ideal point&quot; in this space and voting for the nearest candidates to that point. The dimensions of this model can also be assigned to non-political properties of the candidates, such as perceived corruption, health, etc.

Most of the other spectra in this article can then be considered projections of this multi-dimensional space onto a smaller number of dimensions. For example, a study of German voters found that at least four dimensions were required to adequately represent all political parties.

== Other proposed dimensions ==


In 1998, political author Virginia Postrel, in her book &quot;The Future and Its Enemies&quot;, offered another single-axis spectrum that measures views of the future, contrasting stasists, who allegedly fear the future and wish to control it, and dynamists, who want the future to unfold naturally and without attempts to plan and control. The distinction corresponds to the utopian versus dystopian spectrum used in some theoretical assessments of liberalism, and the book&#x27;s title is borrowed from the work of the anti-utopian classic-liberal theorist Karl Popper.

Other proposed axes include:
* Focus of political concern: communitarianism vs. individualism. These labels are preferred to the loaded language of &quot;totalitarianism&quot; (anti-freedom) vs. &quot;libertarianism&quot; (pro-freedom), because one can have a political focus on the community without being totalitarian and undemocratic. Council communism is a political philosophy that would be counted as communitarian on this axis, but is not totalitarian or undemocratic.
* Responses to conflict: according to the political philosopher Charles Blattberg, in his essay &quot;Political Philosophies and Political Ideologies&quot;, those who would respond to conflict with conversation should be considered as on the left, with negotiation as in the centre, and with force as on the right.
* Role of the church: clericalism vs. anti-clericalism. This axis is less significant in the United States (where views of the role of religion tend to be subsumed into the general left–right axis) than in Europe (where clericalism versus anti-clericalism is much less correlated with the left–right spectrum).
* Urban vs. rural: this axis is significant today in the politics of Europe, Australia and Canada. The urban vs. rural axis was equally prominent in the United States&#x27; political past, but its importance is debatable at present. In the late 18th century and early 19th century in the United States, it would have been described as the conflict between Hamiltonian Federalists and Jeffersonian Republicans.
* Foreign policy: interventionism (the nation should exert power abroad to implement its policy) vs. non-interventionism (the nation should keep to its own affairs). Similarly, multilateralism (coordination of policies with other countries) vs. isolationism and unilateralism.
*Geopolitics: relations with individual states or groups of states may also be vital to party politics. During the Cold War, parties often had to choose a position on a scale between pro-American and pro-Soviet Union, although this could at times closely match a left–right spectrum. At other times in history relations with other powerful states has been important. In early Canadian history relations with Britain were a central theme, although this was not &quot;foreign policy&quot; but a debate over the proper place of Canada within the British Empire.
* International action: multilateralism (states should cooperate and compromise) versus unilateralism (states have a strong, even unconditional, right to make their own decisions).
* Political violence: pacifism (political views should not be imposed by violent force) vs. militancy (violence is a legitimate or necessary means of political expression). In North America, particularly in the United States, holders of these views are often referred to as &quot;doves&quot; and &quot;hawks&quot;, respectively.
* Foreign trade: globalization (world economic markets should become integrated and interdependent) vs. autarky (the nation or polity should strive for economic independence). During the early history of the Commonwealth of Australia, this was the major political continuum. At that time it was called free trade vs. protectionism.
* Trade freedom vs. trade equity: free trade (businesses should be able trade across borders without regulations) vs. fair trade (international trade should be regulated on behalf of social justice).
* Diversity: multiculturalism (the nation should represent a diversity of cultural ideas) vs. assimilationism or nationalism (the nation should primarily represent, or forge, a majority culture).
* Participation: democracy (rule of majority or consensus) vs. aristocracy (rule by the enlightened, elitism) vs. tyranny (total degradation of aristocracy). Ancient Greek philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle recognized tyranny as a state in which the tyrant is ruled by utter passion, and not reason like the philosopher, resulting in the tyrant pursuing his own desires rather than the common good.
* Freedom: positive liberty (having rights which impose an obligation on others) vs. negative liberty (having rights which prohibit interference by others).
* Social power: totalitarianism vs. anarchism (control vs. no control) Analyzes the fundamental political interaction among people, and between individuals and their environment. Often posits the existence of a moderate system as existing between the two extremes.
* Change: radical revolutionaries (who believe in rapid change in support of an ideology) vs. progressives (who believe in advancing change to the status quo) vs. liberals (who passively accept change) vs. conservatives (who believe in moderating change to preserve the status quo) vs. radical reactionaries (who believe in changing things to a previous state, i.e. status quo ante).
**Political moderates oppose radical (revolutionary or reactionary) policies, but they may have progressive, conservative, or liberal tendencies.
* Origin of state authority: popular sovereignty (the state as a creation of the people, with enumerated, delegated powers) vs. various forms of absolutism and organic state philosophy (the state as an original and essential authority) vs. the view held in anarcho-primitivism that &quot;civilization originates in conquest abroad and repression at home&quot;.
* Levels of sovereignty: unionism vs. federalism vs. separatism; or centralism vs. regionalism. Especially important in societies where strong regional or ethnic identities are political issues.
**European integration (in Europe): Euroscepticism vs. European federalism; nation state vs. multinational state.
**Globalization: Nationalism or Patriotism vs. Cosmopolitanism or Internationalism; sovereignty vs. global governance.
* Openness: closed (culturally conservative and protectionist) vs. open (socially liberal and globalist). Popularised as a concept by Tony Blair in 2007 and increasingly dominant in 21st century European and North American politics.
* Propertarianism: Support or opposition to &quot;sticky&quot; private property.
* Priority: the good of the state (patriotism) vs. the good of the population as a whole (utilitarianism) vs. the good of certain individuals (often occurs in autocratic regimes).
* Technology: technological progress or acceleration (e.g. transhumanism) vs. technological regress or deceleration (e.g. anarcho-primitivism).
** FM-2030 coined the terms &quot;up-wing&quot; (looking to the sky and the future, e.g. space colonization) and &quot;down-wing&quot; (looking to the Earth and the past).

== Political spectrum–based forecasts ==
As shown by Russian political scientist Stepan S. Sulakshin, political spectra can be used as a forecasting tool. Sulakshin offered mathematical evidence that stable development (positive dynamics of the vast number of statistic indices) depends on the width of the political spectrum: if it is too narrow or too wide, stagnation or political disasters will result. Sulakshin also showed that in the short run the political spectrum determines the statistic indices dynamic and not vice versa.

== Biological variables ==

A number of studies have found that biology can be linked with political orientation. Many of the studies linking biology to politics remain controversial and unreplicated, although the overall body of evidence is growing.

Studies have found that subjects with conservative political views have larger amygdalae and are more prone to feeling disgust. Liberals have larger volume of grey matter in the anterior cingulate cortex and are better at detecting errors in recurring patterns. The anterior cingulate cortex is used when dealing with conflicting information. A study conducted by researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and New York University (NYU) had participants sort through a deck of cards. The letter M was four times more likely to be in the deck than the letter W. Participants had to press a button every time an M came up in the deck. Liberals were shown to make fewer errors in mistaking the W for the M. This behavioral study supported the notion that liberals are better with dealing with conflicting information. Conservatives have a stronger sympathetic nervous system response to threatening images and are more likely to interpret ambiguous facial expressions as threatening. In general, conservatives are more likely to report larger social networks, more happiness and better self-esteem than liberals. Liberals are more likely to report greater emotional distress, relationship dissatisfaction and experiential hardship and are more open to experience and tolerate uncertainty and disorder better.

Genetic factors account for at least some of the variation of political views. From the perspective of evolutionary psychology, conflicts regarding redistribution of wealth may have been common in the ancestral environment and humans may have developed psychological mechanisms for judging their own chances of succeeding in such conflicts. These mechanisms affect political views.

<text>In mammals, pregnancy is the period of reproduction during which a female carries one or more live offspring from implantation in the uterus through gestation. It begins when a fertilized zygote implants in the female&#x27;s uterus, and ends once it leaves the uterus.

==Fertilization and implantation==
During copulation, the male inseminates the female. The spermatozoon fertilizes an ovum or various ova in the uterus or oviducts, and this results in one or multiple zygotes. Sometimes, a zygote can be created by humans outside of the animal&#x27;s body in the artificial process of in-vitro fertilization. After fertilization, the newly formed zygote then begins to divide through mitosis, forming an embryo, which implants in the female&#x27;s endometrium. At this time, the embryo usually consists of 50 cells.

==Development==
===After implantation===
A blastocele is a small cavity on the center of the embryo, and the developing embryonary cells will grow around it. Then, a flat layer cell forms on the exterior of this cavity, and the zona pellucida, the blastocyst&#x27;s barrier, remains the same size as before. Cells grow increasingly smaller to fit in. This new structure with a cavity in the center and the developing cells around it is known as a blastocyst.

The presence of the blastocyst means that two types of cells are forming, an inner-cell mass growing on the interior of the blastocele and cells growing on the exterior of it. In 24 to 48 hours, the zona pellucida breaches. The cells on the exterior of the blastocyst begin excreting an enzyme which erodes epithelial uterine lining and creates a site for implantation.

===Placental circulation system===
The cells surrounding the blastocyst now destroy cells in the uterine lining, forming small pools of blood, which in turn stimulate the production of capillaries. This is the first stage in the growth of the placenta. The inner cell mass of the blastocyst divides rapidly, forming two layers. The top layer becomes the embryo, and cells from there occupy the amniotic cavity. At the same time, the bottom layer forms a small sac (if the cells begin developing in an abnormal position, an ectopic gestation may also occur at this point).

Several days later, chorionic villi in the forming placenta anchor the implantation site to the uterus. A system of blood and blood vessels now develops at the point of the newly forming placenta, growing near the implantation site. The small sac inside the blastocyst begins producing red blood cells. For the next 24 hours, connective tissue develops between the developing placenta and the growing embryo. This later develops into the umbilical cord.

===Cellular differentiation===
Following this, a narrow line of cells appears on the surface on the embryo. Its growth makes the embryo undergo gastrulation, in which the three primary tissue layers of the fetus, the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm, develop. The narrow line of cells begin to form the endoderm and mesoderm. The ectoderm begins to grow rapidly as a result of chemicals being produced by the mesoderm. These three layers give rise to all the various types of tissue in the body.

The endoderm later forms the lining of the tongue, digestive tract, lungs, bladder and several glands. The mesoderm forms muscle, bone, and lymph tissue, as well as the interior of the lungs, heart, and reproductive and excretory systems. It also gives rise to the spleen, and produces blood cells. The ectoderm forms the skin, nails, hair, cornea, lining of the internal and external ear, nose, sinuses, mouth, anus, teeth, pituitary gland, mammary glands, eyes, and all parts of the nervous system.

Approximately 18 days after fertilization, the embryo has divided to form much of the tissue it will need. It is shaped like a pear, where the head region is larger than the tail. The embryo&#x27;s nervous system is one of the first organic systems to grow. It begins growing in a concave area known as the neural groove.

The blood system continues to grow networks which allow the blood to flow around the embryo. Blood cells are already being produced and are flowing through these developing networks. Secondary blood vessels also begin to develop around the placenta, to supply it with more nutrients. Blood cells begin to form on the sac in the center of the embryo, as well as cells which begin to differentiate into blood vessels. Endocardial cells begin to form the myocardium.

At about 24 days past fertilization, there is a primitive S-shaped tubule heart which begins beating. The flow of fluids throughout the embryo begins at this stage.
=== Gestation periods ===
For mammals, the gestation period is the time in which a fetus develops, beginning with fertilization and ending at birth. The duration of this period varies between species.

For most species, the amount a fetus grows before birth determines the length of the gestation period. Smaller species normally have a shorter gestation period than larger animals. For example, a cat&#x27;s gestation normally takes 58–65 days while an elephant&#x27;s takes nearly 2 years (21 months). However, growth does not necessarily determine the length of gestation for all species, especially for those with a breeding season. Species that use a breeding season usually give birth during a specific time of year when food is available.

Various other factors can come into play in determining the duration of gestation. For humans, male fetuses normally gestate several days longer than females and multiple pregnancies gestate for a shorter period. Ethnicity in humans is also a factor that may lengthen or shorten gestation. In dogs, there is a positive correlation between a longer gestation time and fewer members of the litter. The duration of gestation is usually longer in placental mammals than in marsupials.

<text>Paroxysmal attacks or paroxysms are a sudden recurrence or intensification of symptoms, such as a spasm or seizure. These short, frequent symptoms can be observed in various clinical conditions. They are usually associated with multiple sclerosis or pertussis, but they may also be observed in other disorders such as encephalitis, head trauma, stroke, autism, asthma, trigeminal neuralgia, breath-holding spells, epilepsy, malaria, tabes dorsalis, Behçet&#x27;s disease, and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). It has also been noted as a symptom of gratification disorder in children.

The word &quot;&quot; means &#x27;sudden attack, outburst&#x27; and comes .

Paroxysmal attacks in various disorders have been reported extensively, and ephaptic coupling of demyelinated nerves has been presumed as one of the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon. This is supported by the presence of these attacks in multiple sclerosis and tabes dorsalis, which both involve demyelination of spinal cord neurons. Exercise, tactile stimuli, hot water, anxiety, and neck flexion may provoke paroxysmal attacks. Most reported paroxysmal attacks are painful tonic spasms, dysarthria and ataxia, numbness, and hemiparesis. They are typically different from other symptoms by their brevity (lasting no more than 2 minutes), frequency (from 1–2 times/day up to a few hundred times/day), stereotyped fashion, and excellent response to drugs (usually carbamazepine). Withdrawal of symptoms without any residual neurological finding is another key feature in their recognition.

<text>The potato () is a starchy tuberous vegetable native to the Americas that is consumed as a staple food in many parts of the world. Potatoes are underground tubers of the plant Solanum tuberosum, a perennial in the nightshade family Solanaceae.

Wild potato species can be found from the southern United States to southern Chile. Genetic studies show that the cultivated potato has a single origin, in the area of present-day southern Peru and extreme northwestern Bolivia. Potatoes were domesticated there about 7,000–10,000 years ago from a species in the &quot;S. brevicaule&quot; complex. Many varieties of the potato are cultivated in the Andes region of South America, where the species is indigenous.

The Spanish introduced potatoes to Europe in the second half of the 16th century from the Americas. They are a staple food in many parts of the world and an integral part of much of the world&#x27;s food supply. Following millennia of selective breeding, there are now over 5,000 different varieties of potatoes. The potato remains an essential crop in Europe, especially Northern and Eastern Europe, where per capita production is still the highest in the world, while the most rapid expansion in production during the 21st century was in southern and eastern Asia, with China and India leading the world production as of 2021.

Like the tomato and the nightshades, the potato is in the genus &quot;Solanum&quot;; the aerial parts of the potato contain the toxin solanine. Normal potato tubers that have been grown and stored properly produce glycoalkaloids in negligible amounts, but, if sprouts and potato skins are exposed to light, tubers can become toxic.

== Etymology ==

The English word &quot;potato&quot; comes from Spanish , in turn from Taíno &quot;&quot;, which means &quot;sweet potato&quot;, not the plant now known as simply &quot;potato&quot;.

The name &quot;spud&quot; for a potato is from the 15th century &quot;spudde&quot;, a short knife or dagger, probably related to Danish &quot;spyd&quot;, &quot;spear&quot;. From around 1840, the name transferred to the tuber itself. 

At least seven languages—Afrikaans, Dutch, Low Saxon, French, (West) Frisian, Hebrew, Persian and some variants of German—use a term for &quot;potato&quot; that means &quot;earth apple&quot; or &quot;ground apple&quot;.

== Description ==

Potato plants are herbaceous perennials that grow up to high. The stems are hairy. The leaves have roughly four pairs of leaflets. The flowers range from white or pink to blue or purple; they are yellow at the centre, and are insect-pollinated.

The plant develops tubers to store nutrients. These are not roots but stems that form from thickened rhizomes at the tips of long thin stolons. On the surface of the tubers there are &quot;eyes,&quot; which act as sinks to protect the vegetative buds from which the stems originate. The &quot;eyes&quot; are arranged in helical form. In addition, the tubers have small holes that allow breathing, called lenticels. The lenticels are circular and their number varies depending on the size of the tuber and environmental conditions. Tubers form in response to decreasing day length, although this tendency has been minimized in commercial varieties.

After flowering, potato plants produce small green fruits that resemble green cherry tomatoes, each containing about 300 very small seeds.

== Phylogeny ==

Like the tomato, potatoes belong to the genus &quot;Solanum&quot;, which is a member of the nightshade family, the Solanaceae. That is a diverse family of flowering plants, often poisonous, that includes the mandrake (&quot;Mandragora&quot;), deadly nightshade (&quot;Atropa&quot;), and tobacco (&quot;Nicotiana&quot;), as shown in the outline phylogenetic tree (many branches omitted). The most commonly cultivated potato is &quot;S. tuberosum&quot;; there are several other species.

The major species grown worldwide is &quot;S. tuberosum&quot; (a tetraploid with 48 chromosomes), and modern varieties of this species are the most widely cultivated. There are also four diploid species (with 24 chromosomes): &quot;S. stenotomum&quot;, &quot;S. phureja&quot;, &quot;S. goniocalyx&quot;, and &quot;S. ajanhuiri&quot;. There are two triploid species (with 36 chromosomes): &quot;S. chaucha&quot; and &quot;S. juzepczukii&quot;. There is one pentaploid cultivated species (with 60 chromosomes): &quot;S. curtilobum&quot;. 

There are two major subspecies of &quot;S. tuberosum&quot;. The Andean potato, &quot;S. tuberosum andigena&quot;, is adapted to the short-day conditions prevalent in the mountainous equatorial and tropical regions where it originated. The Chilean potato &quot;S. tuberosum tuberosum&quot;, native to the Chiloé Archipelago, is in contrast adapted to the long-day conditions prevalent in the higher latitude region of southern Chile.

== History ==

=== Domestication ===

Wild potato species occur from the southern United States to southern Chile. The potato was first domesticated in southern Peru and northwestern Bolivia by pre-Columbian farmers, around Lake Titicaca. Potatoes were domesticated there about 7,000–10,000 years ago from a species in the &quot;S. brevicaule&quot; complex. 

The earliest archaeologically verified potato tuber remains have been found at the coastal site of Ancon (central Peru), dating to 2500 BC. The most widely cultivated variety, &quot;Solanum tuberosum tuberosum&quot;, is indigenous to the Chiloé Archipelago, and has been cultivated by the local indigenous people since before the Spanish conquest. 

=== Spread ===

Following the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire, the Spanish introduced the potato to Europe in the second half of the 16th century as part of the Columbian exchange. The staple was subsequently conveyed by European mariners (possibly including the Russian-American Company) to territories and ports throughout the world, especially their colonies. European and colonial farmers were slow to adopt farming potatoes. However, after 1750, they became an important food staple and field crop and played a major role in the European 19th century population boom. According to conservative estimates, the introduction of the potato was responsible for a quarter of the growth in Old World population and urbanization between 1700 and 1900. However, lack of genetic diversity, due to the very limited number of varieties initially introduced, left the crop vulnerable to disease. In 1845, a plant disease known as late blight, caused by the fungus-like oomycete &quot;Phytophthora infestans&quot;, spread rapidly through the poorer communities of western Ireland as well as parts of the Scottish Highlands, resulting in the crop failures that led to the Great Irish Famine.

The International Potato Center, based in Lima, Peru, holds 4,870 types of potato germplasm, most of which are traditional landrace cultivars. In 2009, a draft sequence of the potato genome was made, containing 12 chromosomes and 860 million base pairs, making it a medium-sized plant genome. 

It had been thought that most potato cultivars derived from a single origin in southern Peru and extreme Northwestern Bolivia, from a species in the &quot;S. brevicaule&quot; complex. DNA analysis however shows that more than 99% of all current varieties of potatoes are direct descendants of a subspecies that once grew in the lowlands of south-central Chile. 

Most modern potatoes grown in North America arrived through European settlement and not independently from the South American sources. At least one wild potato species, &quot;S. fendleri&quot;, occurs in North America; it is used in breeding for resistance to a nematode species that attacks cultivated potatoes. A secondary center of genetic variability of the potato is Mexico, where important wild species that have been used extensively in modern breeding are found, such as the hexaploid &quot;S. demissum&quot;, used as a source of resistance to the devastating late blight disease (&quot;Phytophthora infestans&quot;). Another relative native to this region, &quot;Solanum bulbocastanum&quot;, has been used to genetically engineer the potato to resist potato blight. Many such wild relatives are useful for breeding resistance to &quot;P. infestans&quot;.

Little of the diversity found in &quot;Solanum&quot; ancestral and wild relatives is found outside the original South American range. This makes these South American species highly valuable in breeding. The importance of the potato to humanity is recognised in the United Nations International Day of Potato, to be celebrated on 30 May each year, starting in 2024.

== Breeding ==

Potatoes, both &quot;S. tuberosum&quot; and most of its wild relatives, are self-incompatible: they bear no useful fruit when self-pollinated. This trait is problematic for crop breeding, as all sexually-produced plants must be hybrids. The gene responsible for self-incompatibility, as well as mutations to disable it, are now known. Self-compatibility has successfully been introduced both to diploid potatoes (including a special line of &quot;S. tuberosum&quot;) by CRISPR-Cas9. Plants having a &#x27;Sli&#x27; gene produce pollen which is compatible to its own parent and plants with similar S genes. This gene was cloned by Wageningen University and Solynta in 2021, which would allow for faster and more focused breeding.

Diploid hybrid potato breeding is a recent area of potato genetics supported by the finding that simultaneous homozygosity and fixation of donor alleles is possible. Wild potato species useful for breeding blight resistance include &quot;Solanum desmissum&quot; and &quot;S. stoloniferum&quot;, among others.

=== Varieties ===


There are some 5,000 potato varieties worldwide, 3,000 of them in the Andes alone — mainly in Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Chile, and Colombia. Over 100 cultivars might be found in a single valley, and a dozen or more might be maintained by a single agricultural household. 
The European Cultivated Potato Database is an online collaborative database of potato variety descriptions updated and maintained by the Scottish Agricultural Science Agency within the framework of the European Cooperative Programme for Crop Genetic Resources Networks—which is run by the International Plant Genetic Resources Institute.
Around 80 varieties are commercially available in the UK. 

For culinary purposes, varieties are often differentiated by their waxiness: floury or mealy &quot;baking&quot; potatoes have more starch (20–22%) than waxy &quot;boiling&quot; potatoes (16–18%). The distinction may also arise from variation in the comparative ratio of two different potato starch compounds: amylose and amylopectin. Amylose, a long-chain molecule, diffuses from the starch granule when cooked in water, and lends itself to dishes where the potato is mashed. Varieties that contain a slightly higher amylopectin content, which is a highly branched molecule, help the potato retain its shape after being boiled in water. Potatoes that are good for making potato chips or potato crisps are sometimes called &quot;chipping potatoes&quot;, which means they meet the basic requirements of similar varietal characteristics, being firm, fairly clean, and fairly well-shaped.

Immature potatoes may be sold fresh from the field as &quot; or &quot; potatoes and are particularly valued for their taste. They are typically small in size and tender, with a loose skin, and flesh containing a lower level of starch than other potatoes. In the United States they are generally either a Yukon Gold potato or a red potato, called gold creamers or red creamers respectively. In the UK, the Jersey Royal is a famous type of new potato. 

Dozens of potato cultivars have been selectively bred specifically for their skin or flesh color, including gold, red, and blue varieties. These contain varying amounts of phytochemicals, including carotenoids for gold/yellow or polyphenols for red or blue cultivars. Carotenoid compounds include provitamin A alpha-carotene and beta-carotene, which are converted to the essential nutrient, vitamin A, during digestion. Anthocyanins mainly responsible for red or blue pigmentation in potato cultivars do not have nutritional significance, but are used for visual variety and consumer appeal. In 2010, potatoes were bioengineered specifically for these pigmentation traits.

=== Genetic engineering ===

Genetic research has produced several genetically modified varieties. &#x27;New Leaf&#x27;, owned by Monsanto Company, incorporates genes from &quot;Bacillus thuringiensis&quot; (source of most &quot;Bt&quot; toxins in transcrop use), which confers resistance to the Colorado potato beetle; &#x27;New Leaf Plus&#x27; and &#x27;New Leaf Y&#x27;, approved by US regulatory agencies during the 1990s, also include resistance to viruses. McDonald&#x27;s, Burger King, Frito-Lay, and Procter &amp; Gamble announced they would not use genetically modified potatoes, and Monsanto published its intent to discontinue the line in March 2001.

Potato starch contains two types of glucan, amylose and amylopectin, the latter of which is most industrially useful. Waxy potato varieties produce waxy potato starch, which is almost entirely amylopectin, with little or no amylose. BASF developed the &#x27;Amflora&#x27; potato, which was modified to express antisense RNA to inactivate the gene for granule bound starch synthase, an enzyme which catalyzes the formation of amylose. &#x27;Amflora&#x27; potatoes therefore produce starch consisting almost entirely of amylopectin, and are thus more useful for the starch industry. In 2010, the European Commission cleared the way for &#x27;Amflora&#x27; to be grown in the European Union for industrial purposes only—not for food. Nevertheless, under EU rules, individual countries have the right to decide whether they will allow this potato to be grown on their territory. Commercial planting of &#x27;Amflora&#x27; was expected in the Czech Republic and Germany in the spring of 2010, and Sweden and the Netherlands in subsequent years. 

The &#x27;Fortuna&#x27; GM potato variety developed by BASF was made resistant to late blight by introgressing two resistance genes, and , from &quot;S. bulbocastanum&quot;, a wild potato native to Mexico. is a nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR/NLR), an R-gene-produced immunoreceptor.

In October 2011, BASF requested cultivation and marketing approval as a feed and food from the EFSA. In 2012, GMO development in Europe was stopped by BASF. In November 2014, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) approved a genetically modified potato developed by Simplot, which contains genetic modifications that prevent bruising and produce less acrylamide when fried than conventional potatoes; the modifications do not cause new proteins to be made, but rather prevent proteins from being made via RNA interference.

Genetically modified varieties have met public resistance in the U.S. and in the European Union.

== Cultivation ==

=== Seed potatoes ===

Potatoes are generally grown from &quot;seed potatoes&quot;, tubers specifically grown to be free from disease and to provide consistent and healthy plants. To be disease free, the areas where seed potatoes are grown are selected with care. In the US, this restricts production of seed potatoes to only 15 states out of all 50 states where potatoes are grown. These locations are selected for their cold, hard winters that kill pests and summers with long sunshine hours for optimum growth. In the UK, most seed potatoes originate in Scotland, in areas where westerly winds reduce aphid attacks and the spread of potato virus pathogens.

=== Phases of growth ===

Potato growth can be divided into five phases. During the first phase, sprouts emerge from the seed potatoes and root growth begins. During the second, photosynthesis begins as the plant develops leaves and branches above-ground and stolons develop from lower leaf axils on the below-ground stem. In the third phase the tips of the stolons swell, forming new tubers, and the shoots continue to grow, with flowers typically developing soon after. Tuber bulking occurs during the fourth phase, when the plant begins investing the majority of its resources in its newly formed tubers. At this phase, several factors are critical to a good yield: optimal soil moisture and temperature, soil nutrient availability and balance, and resistance to pest attacks. The fifth phase is the maturation of the tubers: the leaves and stems senesce and the tuber skins harden.

New tubers may start growing at the surface of the soil. Since exposure to light leads to an undesirable greening of the skins and the development of solanine as a protection from the sun&#x27;s rays, growers cover surface tubers. Commercial growers cover them by piling additional soil around the base of the plant as it grows (called &quot;hilling&quot; up, or in British English &quot;earthing up&quot;). An alternative method, used by home gardeners and smaller-scale growers, involves covering the growing area with mulches such as straw or plastic sheets.

At farm scale, potatoes require a well-drained neutral or mildly acidic soil (pH 6 or 7) such as a sandy loam. The soil is prepared using deep tillage, for example with a chisel plow or ripper. In areas where irrigation is needed, the field is leveled using a landplane so that water can be supplied evenly. Manure can be added after initial irrigation; the soil is then broken up with a disc harrow. The potatoes are planted using a potato planter machine in rows apart. At garden scale, potatoes are planted in trenches or individual holes some deep in soil, preferably with additional organic matter such as garden compost or manure. Alternatively, they can be planted in containers or bags filled with a free-draining compost.
Potatoes are sensitive to heavy frosts, which damage them in the ground or when stored.

=== Pests and diseases ===

The historically significant &quot;Phytophthora infestans&quot;, the cause of late blight, remains an ongoing problem in Europe and the United States. Other potato diseases include &quot;Rhizoctonia&quot;, &quot;Sclerotinia&quot;, &quot;Pectobacterium carotovorum&quot; (black leg), powdery mildew, powdery scab and leafroll virus.

Insects that commonly transmit potato diseases or damage the plants include the Colorado potato beetle, the potato tuber moth, the green peach aphid (&quot;Myzus persicae&quot;), the potato aphid, &quot;Tuta absoluta&quot;, beet leafhoppers, thrips, and mites. The Colorado potato beetle is considered the most important insect defoliator of potatoes, devastating entire crops. The potato cyst nematode is a microscopic worm that feeds on the roots, thus causing the potato plants to wilt. Since its eggs can survive in the soil for several years, crop rotation is recommended.

=== Harvest ===

On a small scale, potatoes can be harvested using a hoe or spade, or simply by hand. Commercial harvesting is done with large potato harvesters, which scoop up the plant and surrounding earth. This is transported up an apron chain consisting of steel links several feet wide, which separates some of the earth. The chain deposits into an area where further separation occurs. The most complex designs use vine choppers and shakers, along with a blower system to separate the potatoes from the plant. The result is then usually run past workers who continue to sort out plant material, stones, and rotten potatoes before the potatoes are continuously delivered to a wagon or truck. Further inspection and separation occurs when the potatoes are unloaded from the field vehicles and put into storage.

Potatoes are usually cured after harvest to improve skin-set. Skin-set is the process by which the skin of the potato becomes resistant to skinning damage. Potato tubers may be susceptible to skinning at harvest and suffer skinning damage during harvest and handling operations. Curing allows the skin to fully set and any wounds to heal. Wound-healing prevents infection and water-loss from the tubers during storage. Curing is normally done at relatively warm temperatures () with high humidity and good gas-exchange if at all possible.&#x27;

=== Storage ===

Storage facilities need to be carefully designed to keep the potatoes alive and slow the natural process of sprouting which involves the breakdown of starch. It is crucial that the storage area be dark, ventilated well, and, for long-term storage, maintained at temperatures near . For short-term storage, temperatures of about are preferred.

Temperatures below convert the starch in potatoes into sugar, which alters their taste and cooking qualities and leads to higher acrylamide levels in the cooked product, especially in deep-fried dishes. The discovery of acrylamides in starchy foods in 2002 has caused concern, but it is not likely that the acrylamides in food, even if it is somewhat burnt, causes cancer in humans.

Chemicals are used to suppress sprouting of tubers during storage. Chlorpropham is the main chemical used, but it has been banned in the EU over toxicity concerns. Alternatives include ethylene, spearmint and orange oils, and 1,4-dimethylnaphthalene.

Under optimum conditions in commercial warehouses, potatoes can be stored for up to 10–12 months. The commercial storage and retrieval of potatoes involves several phases: first &quot;drying&quot; surface moisture; &quot;wound healing&quot; at 85% to 95% relative humidity and temperatures below ; a staged &quot;cooling phase&quot;; a &quot;holding&quot; phase; and a &quot;reconditioning&quot; phase, during which the tubers are slowly warmed. Mechanical ventilation is used at various points during the process to prevent condensation and the accumulation of carbon dioxide.

== Production ==



In 2021, world production of potatoes was , led by China with 25% of the total. Other major producers were India and Ukraine (table).

The world dedicated to potato cultivation in 2010; the world average yield was . The United States was the most productive country, with a nationwide average yield of .

New Zealand farmers have demonstrated some of the best commercial yields in the world, ranging between 60 and 80 tonnes per hectare, some reporting yields of 88 tonnes of potatoes per hectare.

There is a big gap among various countries between high and low yields, even with the same variety of potato. Average potato yields in developed economies ranges between . China and India accounted for over a third of world&#x27;s production in 2010, and had yields of respectively. The yield gap between farms in developing economies and developed economies represents an opportunity loss of over of potato, or an amount greater than 2010 world potato production. Potato crop yields are determined by factors such as the crop breed, seed age and quality, crop management practices and the plant environment. Improvements in one or more of these yield determinants, and a closure of the yield gap, could be a major boost to food supply and farmer incomes in the developing world. The food energy yield of potatoes—about —is higher than that of maize (), rice (), wheat (), or soybeans ().

== Impact of climate change on production ==

Climate change is predicted to have significant effects on global potato production. Like many crops, potatoes are likely to be affected by changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide, temperature and precipitation, as well as interactions between these factors. As well as affecting potatoes directly, climate change will also affect the distributions and populations of many potato diseases and pests. While the potato is less important than maize, rice, wheat and soybeans, which are collectively responsible for around two-thirds of all calories consumed by humans (both directly and indirectly as animal feed), it still is one of the world&#x27;s most important food crops. Altogether, one 2003 estimate suggests that future (2040–2069) worldwide potato yield would be 18-32% lower than it was at the time, driven by declines in hotter areas like Sub-Saharan Africa, unless farmers and potato cultivars can adapt to the new environment.

Potato plants and crop yields are predicted to benefit from the CO2 fertilization effect, which would increase photosynthetic rates and therefore growth, reduce water consumption through lower transpiration from stomata and increase starch content in the edible tubers. However, potatoes are more sensitive to soil water deficits than some other staple crops like wheat. In the UK, the amount of arable land suitable for rainfed potato production is predicted to decrease by at least 75%. These changes are likely to lead to increased demand for irrigation water, particularly during the potato growing season.

Potatoes grow best under temperate conditions. Temperatures above have negative effects on potato crops, from physiological damage such as brown spots on tubers, to slower growth, premature sprouting, and lower starch content. These effects reduce crop yield, affecting both the number and the weight of tubers. As a result, areas where current temperatures are near the limits of potatoes&#x27; temperature range (e.g. much of sub-Saharan Africa) will likely suffer large reductions in potato crop yields in the future. On the other hand, low temperatures reduce potato growth and present risk of frost damage. 

=== Changes in pests and diseases ===

Climate change is predicted to affect many potato pests and diseases. These include:

* Insect pests such as the potato tuber moth and Colorado potato beetle, which are predicted to spread into areas currently too cold for them.
* Aphids which act as vectors for many potato viruses and will spread under increased temperatures.
* Pathogens causing potato blackleg disease (e.g. Dickeya) grow and reproduce faster at higher temperatures.
* Bacterial infections such as Ralstonia solanacearum will benefit from higher temperatures and spread more easily through flash flooding.
* Late blight benefits from higher temperatures and wetter conditions. Late blight is predicted to become a greater threat in some areas (e.g. in Finland) and become a lesser threat in others (e.g. in the United Kingdom).

=== Adaptation strategies ===

Potato production is expected to decline in many areas due to hotter temperatures and decreased water availability. Conversely, production is predicted to become possible in high altitude and latitude areas where it has been limited by frost damage, such as in Canada and Russia. This will shift potato production to cooler areas, mitigating much of the projected decline in yield. However, this may trigger competition for land between potato crops and other land uses, mostly due to changes in water and temperature regimes. 

The other approach is through the development of varieties or cultivars which would be more adapted to altered conditions. This can be done through &#x27;traditional&#x27; plant breeding techniques and genetic modification. These techniques allow for the selection of specific traits as a new cultivar is developed. Certain traits, such as heat stress tolerance, drought tolerance, fast growth/early maturation and disease resistance, may play an important role in creating new cultivars able to maintain yields under stressors induced by climate change.

For instance, developing cultivars with greater heat stress tolerance would be critical for maintaining yields in countries with potato production areas near current cultivars&#x27; maximum temperature limits (e.g. Sub-Saharan Africa, India). Superior drought resistance can be achieved through improved water use efficiency (amount of food produced per amount of water used) or the ability to recover from short drought periods and still produce acceptable yields. Further, selecting for deeper root systems may reduce the need for irrigation.

== Nutrition ==


In a reference amount of , a boiled potato with skin supplies 87 calories and is 77% water, 20% carbohydrates (including 2% dietary fiber in the skin and flesh), 2% protein, and contains negligible fat (table). The protein content is comparable to other starchy vegetable staples, as well as grains.

Boiled potatoes are a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of vitamin B6 (23% DV), and contain a moderate amount of vitamin C (16% DV) and B vitamins, such as thiamine, niacin, and pantothenic acid (10% DV each). Boiled potatoes do not supply significant amounts of dietary minerals (table).

The potato is rarely eaten raw because raw potato starch is poorly digested by humans. Depending on the cultivar and preparation method, potatoes can have a high glycemic index (GI) and so are often excluded from the diets of individuals trying to follow a low-GI diet. There is a lack of evidence on the effect of potato consumption on obesity and diabetes.

In the UK, potatoes are not considered by the National Health Service as counting or contributing towards the recommended daily five portions of fruit and vegetables, the 5-A-Day program.

== Toxicity ==
Raw potatoes contain toxic glycoalkaloids, of which the most prevalent are solanine and chaconine. Solanine is found in other plants in the same family, Solanaceae, which includes such plants as deadly nightshade (&quot;Atropa belladonna&quot;), henbane (&quot;Hyoscyamus niger&quot;) and tobacco (&quot;Nicotiana&quot; spp.), as well as food plants like tomato. These compounds, which protect the potato plant from its predators, are especially concentrated in the aerial parts of the plant. The tubers are low in these toxins, unless they are exposed to light, which makes them go green.

Exposure to light, physical damage, and age increase glycoalkaloid content within the tuber. Different potato varieties contain different levels of glycoalkaloids. The &#x27;Lenape&#x27; variety, released in 1967, was withdrawn in 1970 as it contained high levels of glycoalkaloids. Since then, breeders of new varieties test for this, sometimes discarding an otherwise promising cultivar. Breeders try to keep glycoalkaloid levels below . However, when these commercial varieties turn green, their solanine concentrations can go well above this limit, with higher levels in the potato&#x27;s skin.

== Uses ==

=== Culinary ===

Potato dishes vary around the world. Peruvian cuisine naturally contains the potato as a primary ingredient in many dishes, as around 3,000 varieties of the tuber are grown there. Chuño is a freeze-dried potato product traditionally made by Quechua and Aymara communities of Peru and Bolivia. In the UK, potatoes form part of the traditional dish fish and chips. Roast potatoes are commonly served as part of a Sunday roast dinner and mashed potatoes form a major component of several other traditional dishes, such as shepherd&#x27;s pie, bubble and squeak, and bangers and mash. New potatoes may be cooked with mint and are often served with butter. In Germany, Northern Europe (Finland, Latvia and especially Scandinavian countries), Eastern Europe (Russia, Belarus and Ukraine) and Poland, newly harvested, early ripening varieties are considered a special delicacy. Boiled whole and served un-peeled with dill, these &quot;new potatoes&quot; are traditionally consumed with Baltic herring. Puddings made from grated potatoes (kugel, kugelis, and potato babka) are popular items of Ashkenazi, Lithuanian, and Belarusian cuisine. Cepelinai, the national dish of Lithuania, are dumplings made from boiled grated potatoes, usually stuffed with minced meat. In Italy, in the Friuli region, potatoes serve to make a type of pasta called gnocchi. Potato is used in northern China where rice is not easily grown, a popular dish being (&quot;qīng jiāo tǔ dòu sī&quot;), made with green pepper, vinegar and thin slices of potato. In the winter, roadside sellers in northern China sell roasted potatoes.

=== Other uses ===

Potatoes are sometimes used to brew alcoholic spirits such as vodka, poitín, akvavit, and brännvin.

Potatoes are used as fodder for livestock. They may be made into silage which can be stored for some months before use. 

Potato starch is used in the food industry as a thickener and binder for soups and sauces, in the textile industry as an adhesive, and in the paper industry for the manufacturing of papers and boards.

Potatoes are commonly used in plant research. The consistent parenchyma tissue, the clonal nature of the plant and the low metabolic activity make it an ideal model tissue for experiments on wound-response studies and electron transport.

== Cultural significance ==

=== In mythology ===

In Inca mythology, a daughter of the earth mother Pachamama, Axomamma, is the goddess of potatoes. She ensured the fertility of the soil and the growth of the tubers. According to Iroquois mythology, the first potatoes grew out of Earth Woman&#x27;s feet after she died giving birth to her twin sons, Sapling and Flint.

=== In art ===

The potato has been an essential crop in the Andes since the pre-Columbian era. The Moche culture from Northern Peru made ceramics from the earth, water, and fire. This pottery was a sacred substance, formed in significant shapes and used to represent important themes. Potatoes are represented anthropomorphically as well as naturally.
During the late 19th century, numerous images of potato harvesting appeared in European art, including the works of Willem Witsen and Anton Mauve.
Van Gogh&#x27;s 1885 painting &quot;The Potato Eaters&quot; portrays a family eating potatoes. Van Gogh said he wanted to depict peasants as they really were. He deliberately chose coarse and ugly models, thinking that they would be natural and unspoiled in his finished work.
Jean-François Millet&#x27;s &quot;The Potato Harvest&quot; depicts peasants working in the plains between Barbizon and Chailly. It presents a theme representative of the peasants&#x27; struggle for survival. Millet&#x27;s technique for this work incorporated paste-like pigments thickly applied over a coarsely textured canvas.

=== In popular culture ===

Invented in 1949, and marketed and sold commercially by Hasbro in 1952, Mr. Potato Head is an American toy that consists of a plastic potato and attachable plastic parts, such as ears and eyes, to make a face. It was the first toy ever advertised on television.

In the 2015 fictional film, &quot;The Martian&quot;, stranded astronaut and botanist, Mark Watney, cultivates potatoes in the artificial crew habitat using Martian soil fertilized with frozen feces, and produces water from unused rocket fuel.

<doc id="23503" wikidata="Q6106" url="?curid=23503" title="Portland, Oregon">
<text>Portland ( ) is the most populous city in the U.S. state of Oregon, located in the Pacific Northwest region. Situated close to northwest Oregon at the confluence of the Willamette and Columbia rivers, it is the county seat of Multnomah County, Oregon&#x27;s most populous county. Portland&#x27;s population was 652,503, making it the 27th most populous city in the United States, the sixth most populous on the West Coast, and the third most populous in the Pacific Northwest after Seattle and Vancouver. Approximately 2.5 million people live in the Portland metropolitan area, making it the 25th most populous in the United States. Almost half of Oregon&#x27;s population resides within the Portland metro area.

Named after Portland, Maine, which is itself named after England&#x27;s Isle of Portland, the Oregon settlement began to be populated near the end of the Oregon Trail in the 1840s. Its water access provided convenient transportation of goods, and the timber industry was a major force in the city&#x27;s early economy. At the turn of the 20th century, the city had a reputation as one of the most dangerous port cities in the world, and was a hub for organized crime and racketeering; this reputation dissipated after its economy experienced an industrial boom during World War II, and it became known for its growing liberal and progressive political values from the 1960s onwards, earning it a reputation as a bastion of counterculture exemplified by the popular slogan &quot;Keep Portland Weird&quot;. This aspect of the city has since been championed by organizations such as Weird Portland United and the comedy series &quot;Portlandia&quot; (2011–2018).

The city operates with a mayor–council government system, guided by a mayor and 12 city councilors, as well as Metro, the only directly elected metropolitan planning organization in the United States. Its climate is marked by warm, dry summers and cool, rainy winters. This climate is ideal for growing roses, and Portland has been called the &quot;City of Roses&quot; for over a century.

==History==


===Before European settlement===
During the prehistoric period, the land that would become Portland was flooded after the collapse of glacial dams from Lake Missoula, in what would later become Montana. These massive floods occurred during the last ice age and filled the Willamette Valley with of water.

Before American settlers began arriving in the 1800s, the land was inhabited for many centuries by two bands of indigenous Chinook peoplethe Multnomah and the Clackamas. The Chinook people occupying the land were first documented in 1805 by Meriwether Lewis and William Clark. Before its European settlement, the Portland Basin of the lower Columbia River and Willamette River valleys had been one of the most densely populated regions on the Pacific Coast.

===Establishment===

Large numbers of pioneer settlers began arriving in the Willamette Valley in the 1840s via the Oregon Trail with many arriving in nearby Oregon City. A new settlement then emerged ten miles from the mouth of the Willamette River, roughly halfway between Oregon City and Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company&#x27;s Fort Vancouver. This community was initially referred to as &quot;Stumptown&quot; and &quot;The Clearing&quot; because of the many trees cut down to allow for its growth. In 1843 William Overton saw potential in the new settlement but lacked the funds to file an official land claim. For 25 cents, Overton agreed to share half of the site with Asa Lovejoy of Boston.

In 1844, Overton sold his remaining half of the claim to Francis W. Pettygrove of Portland, Maine. Both Pettygrove and Lovejoy wished to rename &quot;The Clearing&quot; after their respective hometowns (Lovejoy&#x27;s being Boston, and Pettygrove&#x27;s, Portland). This controversy was settled with a coin toss that Pettygrove won in a series of two out of three tosses, thereby providing Portland with its namesake. The coin used for this decision, now known as the Portland Penny, is on display in the headquarters of the Oregon Historical Society. At the time of its incorporation on February 8, 1851, Portland had over 800 inhabitants, a steam sawmill, a log cabin hotel, and a newspaper, the &quot;Weekly Oregonian&quot;. A major fire swept through downtown in August 1873, destroying twenty blocks on the west side of the Willamette along Yamhill and Morrison Streets, and causing $1.3 million in damage, roughly equivalent to $ today. By 1879, the population had grown to 17,500 and by 1890 it had grown to 46,385. In 1888, the first steel bridge on the West Coast was opened in Portland, the predecessor of the 1912 namesake Steel Bridge that survives today. In 1889, Henry Pittock&#x27;s wife, Georgiana, established the Portland Rose Society. The movement to make Portland a &quot;Rose City&quot; started as the city was preparing for the 1905 Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition.

Portland&#x27;s access to the Pacific Ocean via the Willamette and Columbia rivers, as well as its easy access to the agricultural Tualatin Valley via the &quot;Great Plank Road&quot; (the route of current-day U.S. Route 26), provided the pioneer city with an advantage over other nearby ports, and it grew very quickly. Portland remained the major port in the Pacific Northwest for much of the 19th century, until the 1890s, when Seattle&#x27;s deepwater harbor was connected to the rest of the mainland by rail, affording an inland route without the treacherous navigation of the Columbia River. The city had its own Japantown, for one, and the lumber industry also became a prominent economic presence, due to the area&#x27;s large population of Douglas fir, western hemlock, red cedar, and big leaf maple trees.

Portland developed a reputation early in its history as a hard-edged and gritty port town. Some historians have described the city&#x27;s early establishment as being a &quot;scion of New England; an ends-of-the-earth home for the exiled spawn of the eastern established elite.&quot; In 1889, &quot;The Oregonian&quot; called Portland &quot;the most filthy city in the Northern States&quot;, due to the unsanitary sewers and gutters, and, at the turn of the 20th century, it was considered one of the most dangerous port cities in the world. The city housed a large number of saloons, bordellos, gambling dens, and boarding houses which were populated with miners after the California gold rush, as well as the multitude of sailors passing through the port. By the early 20th century, the city had lost its reputation as a &quot;sober frontier city&quot; and garnered a reputation for being violent and dangerous.

===20th-century development===

Between 1900 and 1930, the city&#x27;s population tripled from nearly 100,000 to 301,815. During World War II, it housed an &quot;assembly center&quot; from which up to 3,676 people of Japanese descent were dispatched to internment camps in the heartland. It was the first American city to have residents report thus, and the Pacific International Livestock Exposition operated from May through September 10, 1942, processing people from the city, northern Oregon, and central Washington. General John DeWitt called the city the first &quot;Jap-free city on the West Coast&quot;.

At the same time, Portland became a notorious hub for underground criminal activity and organized crime in the 1940s and 1950s. In 1957, &quot;Life&quot; magazine published an article detailing the city&#x27;s history of government corruption and crime, specifically its gambling rackets and illegal nightclubs. The article, which focused on crime boss Jim Elkins, became the basis of a fictionalized film titled &quot;Portland Exposé&quot; (1957). In spite of the city&#x27;s seedier undercurrent of criminal activity, Portland enjoyed an economic and industrial surge during World War II. Ship builder Henry J. Kaiser had been awarded contracts to build Liberty ships and aircraft carrier escorts, and chose sites in Portland and Vancouver, Washington, for work yards. During this time, Portland&#x27;s population rose by over 150,000, largely attributed to recruited laborers.

During the 1960s, an influx of hippie subculture began to take root in the city in the wake of San Francisco&#x27;s burgeoning countercultural scene. The city&#x27;s Crystal Ballroom became a hub for the city&#x27;s psychedelic culture, while food cooperatives and listener-funded media and radio stations were established. A large social activist presence evolved during this time as well, specifically concerning Native American rights, environmentalist causes, and gay rights. By the 1970s, Portland had well established itself as a progressive city, and experienced an economic boom for the majority of the decade; however, the slowing of the housing market in 1979 caused demand for the city and state timber industries to drop significantly.

===Since 1990===

In the 1990s, the technology industry began to emerge in Portland, specifically with the establishment of companies such as Intel, which brought more than US$10 billion in investments in 1995 alone. In the late 1990s, the Portland area was rated the fourth-least affordable place in the United States to purchase a new home. After 2000, Portland experienced significant growth, with a population rise of over 90,000 between the years 2000 and 2014. The city&#x27;s increasing reputation for culture established it as a popular city for young people, and it was second only to Louisville, Kentucky, as one of the cities to attract and retain the highest number of college-educated people in the United States. Between 2001 and 2012, Portland&#x27;s gross domestic product per person grew by fifty percent, more than any other city in the country.

The city acquired a diverse range of nicknames throughout its history, though it is most often called &quot;Rose City&quot; or &quot;The City of Roses&quot; (unofficial nickname since 1888, official since 2003). Another widely used nickname by local residents in everyday speech is &quot;PDX&quot;, the airport code for Portland International Airport. Other nicknames include Bridgetown, Stumptown, Rip City, Soccer City, P-Town, Portlandia, and the more antiquated Little Beirut.

====2020 George Floyd protests====


From May 28, 2020, until spring 2021, there were daily protests about the murder of George Floyd by police, and racial injustice. There were instances of looting, vandalism, and police actions causing injuries. One protestor was killed by an opposing one. Local businesses reported losses totaling millions of dollars as the result of vandalism and looting, according to Oregon Public Broadcasting. Some protests caused injury to protesters and police. In July, federal officers were deployed to safeguard federal property; their presence and tactics were criticized by Oregon officials, who demanded they leave, while lawsuits were filed against local and federal law enforcement alleging wrongful actions by them.

On May 25, 2021, a protest to commemorate the one-year anniversary of Floyd&#x27;s murder caused property damage, and was followed by a number of arrests.

==Geography==
===Geology===

Portland lies on top of a dormant volcanic field known as the Boring Lava Field, named after the nearby bedroom community of Boring. The Boring Lava Field has at least 32 cinder cones such as Mount Tabor, and its center lies in southeast Portland. Mount St. Helens, a highly active volcano northeast of the city in Washington state, is easily visible on clear days and is close enough to have dusted the city with volcanic ash after its eruption on May 18, 1980. The rocks of the Portland area range in age from late Eocene to more recent eras.

Multiple shallow, active fault lines traverse the Portland metropolitan area. Among them are the Portland Hills Fault on the city&#x27;s west side, and the East Bank Fault on the east side. According to a 2017 survey, several of these faults were characterized as &quot;probably more of a hazard&quot; than the Cascadia subduction zone due to their proximities to population centers, with the potential of producing magnitude 7 earthquakes. Notable earthquakes that have impacted the Portland area in recent history include the 6.8-magnitude Nisqually earthquake in 2001, and a 5.6-magnitude earthquake that struck on March 25, 1993.

Per a 2014 report, over 7,000 locations within the Portland area are at high risk for landslides and soil liquefaction in the event of a major earthquake, including much of the city&#x27;s west side (such as Washington Park) and sections of Clackamas County.

===Topography===
Portland is east of the Pacific Ocean at the northern end of Oregon&#x27;s most populated region, the Willamette Valley. Downtown Portland straddles the banks of the Willamette River, which flows north through the city center and separates the city&#x27;s east and west neighborhoods. Less than from downtown, the Willamette River flows into the Columbia River, the fourth-largest river in the United States, which divides Oregon from Washington state. Portland is approximately upriver from the Pacific Ocean on the Columbia.

Though much of downtown Portland is relatively flat, the foothills of the Tualatin Mountains, more commonly referred to locally as the &quot;West Hills&quot;, pierce through the northwest and southwest reaches of the city. Council Crest Park at is often quoted as the highest point in Portland; however, the highest point in Portland is on a section of NW Skyline Blvd just north of Willamette Stone Heritage site. The highest point east of the river is Mt. Tabor, an extinct volcanic cinder cone, which rises to . Nearby Powell Butte and Rocky Butte rise to and , respectively. To the west of the Tualatin Mountains lies the Oregon Coast Range, and to the east lies the actively volcanic Cascade Range. On clear days, Mt. Hood and Mt. St. Helens dominate the horizon, while Mt. Adams and Mt. Rainier can also be seen in the distance.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and is water. Although almost all of Portland is within Multnomah County, small portions of the city are within Clackamas and Washington counties.

===Climate===

Portland has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen &quot;Csb),&quot; falling just short of a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen &quot;Csa)&quot; with cool and rainy winters, and warm and dry summers. This climate is characterized by having overcast, wet, and changing weather conditions in fall, winter, and spring, as Portland lies in the direct path of the stormy westerly flow, and warm, dry summers when the North Pacific High reaches its northernmost point in mid-summer. Portland&#x27;s USDA Plant Hardiness Zone is 8b, with parts of the Downtown area falling into zone 9a.

Winters are cool, cloudy, and rainy. The coldest month is December with an average daily high temperature of , although overnight lows usually remain above freezing by a few degrees. Evening temperatures fall to or below freezing 32 nights per year on average, but very rarely below . There are only 2.1 days per year where the daytime high temperature fails to rise above freezing; the mean for the lowest high is at the exact freezing point of . The lowest overnight temperature ever recorded was , on February 2, 1950, while the lowest daytime high temperature ever recorded was on December 30, 1968. The average window in which freezing temperatures may occur is between November 15 and March 19, allowing a growing season of 240 days.

Annual snowfall in Portland is , which usually falls between December and March. The city of Portland avoids snow more frequently than its suburbs, due in part to its low elevation and the urban heat island effect. Neighborhoods outside of the downtown core, especially in slightly higher elevations near the West Hills and Mount Tabor, can experience a dusting of snow while downtown receives no accumulation at all. The city has experienced a few major snow and ice storms in its past, with extreme totals having reached at the airport in 1949–50 and at downtown in 1892–93.
Summers in Portland are warm, dry, and sunny, though the sunny warm weather is short-lived, from mid-June to early September. June, July, August and September account for a combined of total rainfall only 11% of the of annual precipitation. The warmest month is August, with an average high temperature of . Because of its inland location from the coast, as well as the protective nature of the Oregon Coast Range to its west, Portland summers are less susceptible to the moderating influence of the nearby Pacific Ocean. Consequently, Portland occasionally experiences heat waves, with temperatures rising above for a few days. However, on average, temperatures reach or exceed on only 61 days per year, of which 15 days will reach and only 1.3 days will reach . In 2018 more 90-degree days were recorded than ever before.

On June 28, 2021, Portland recorded its all-time record high temperature of and its warmest daily low temperature of during a major regional heat wave. The record had been broken for three consecutive days with daytime highs of on June 26 and on June 27; the previous record of was set in July 1965 and matched twice in August 1981. A temperature of has been recorded in all five months from May through September. The warmest night of the year averages .

Spring and fall can bring variable weather including high-pressure ridging that sends temperatures surging above and cold fronts that plunge daytime temperatures into the 40s °F (4–9 °C). However, lengthy stretches of overcast days beginning in mid-fall and continuing into mid-spring are most common. Rain often falls as a light drizzle for several consecutive days at a time, contributing to 157 days on average with measurable (≥) precipitation annually. Temperatures have reached as early as April 30 and as late as October 5, while has been reached as early as March 16 and as late as October 21. Thunderstorms are uncommon and tornadoes are very rare, although they do occur.


===Cityscape===
Portland&#x27;s cityscape derives much of its character from the many bridges that span the Willamette River downtown, several of which are historic landmarks, and Portland has been nicknamed &quot;Bridgetown&quot; for many decades as a result. Three of downtown&#x27;s most heavily used bridges are more than 100 years old and are designated historic landmarks: Hawthorne Bridge (1910), Steel Bridge (1912), and Broadway Bridge (1913). Portland&#x27;s newest bridge in the downtown area, Tilikum Crossing, opened in 2015 and is the first new bridge to span the Willamette in Portland since the 1973 opening of the double-decker Fremont Bridge.

Other bridges that span the Willamette River in the downtown area include the Burnside Bridge, the Ross Island Bridge (both built 1926), and the double-decker Marquam Bridge (built 1966). Other bridges outside the downtown area include the Sellwood Bridge (built 2016) to the south; and the St. Johns Bridge, a Gothic revival suspension bridge built in 1931, to the north. The Glenn L. Jackson Memorial Bridge and the Interstate Bridge provide access from Portland across the Columbia River into Washington state.

===Neighborhoods===

The Willamette River, which flows north through downtown, serves as the natural boundary between East and West Portland. The denser and earlier-developed west side extends into the lap of the West Hills, while the flatter east side extends for roughly 180 blocks until it meets the suburb of Gresham. In 1891 the cities of Portland, Albina, and East Portland were consolidated, creating inconsistent patterns of street names and addresses. It was not unusual for a street name to be duplicated in disparate areas. The &quot;Great Renumbering&quot; on September 2, 1931, standardized street naming patterns and divided Portland into five &quot;general districts&quot;. It also changed house numbers from 20 per block to 100 per block and adopted a single street name on a grid. For example, the 200 block north of Burnside is either NW Davis Street or NE Davis Street throughout the entire city.


The six previous addressing sections of Portland, which were colloquially known as quadrants despite there being six, have developed distinctive identities, with mild cultural differences and friendly rivalries between their residents, especially between those who live east of the Willamette River versus west of the river. Portland&#x27;s addressing sections are North, Northwest, Northeast, South, Southeast, and Southwest (which includes downtown Portland). The Willamette River divides the city into east and west while Burnside Street, which traverses the entire city lengthwise, divides the north and south. North Portland consists of the peninsula formed by the Willamette and Columbia Rivers, with N Williams Ave serving as its eastern boundary. All addresses and streets within the city are prefixed by N, NW, NE, S, SW or SE with the exception of Burnside Street, which is prefixed with W or E. Starting on May 1, 2020, former Southwest prefix addresses with house numbers on east–west streets leading with zero dropped the zero and the street prefix on all streets (including north–south streets) converted from Southwest to South. For example, the current address of 246 S California St. was changed from 0246 SW California St. and the current address of 4310 S Macadam Ave. was converted from 4310 SW Macadam Ave.

The new South Portland addressing section was approved by the Portland City Council on June 6, 2018 and is bounded by SW Naito Parkway, SW View Point Terrace and the Tryon Creek State Natural Area to the west, SW Clay Street to the north, the Willamette River to the east, and city limits to the south. It includes the Lair Hill, Johns Landing and South Waterfront districts and Lewis &amp; Clark College as well as the Riverdale area of unincorporated Multnomah County south of the Portland city limits. In 2018, the city&#x27;s Bureau of Transportation finalized a plan to transition this part of Portland into South Portland, beginning on May 1, 2020, to reduce confusion by 9-1-1 dispatchers and delivery services. With the addition of South Portland, all six addressing sectors (N, NE, NW, S, SE and SW) are now officially known as sextants.

The Pearl District in Northwest Portland, which was largely occupied by warehouses, light industry and railroad classification yards in the early to mid-20th century, now houses upscale art galleries, restaurants, and retail stores, and is one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in the city. Areas further west of the Pearl District include neighborhoods known as Uptown and Nob Hill, as well as the Alphabet District and NW 23rd Ave., a major shopping street lined with clothing boutiques and other upscale retail, mixed with cafes and restaurants.

Northeast Portland is home to the Lloyd District, Alberta Arts District, and the Hollywood District. North Portland is largely residential and industrial. It contains Kelley Point Park, the northernmost point of the city. It also contains the St. Johns neighborhood, which is historically one of the most ethnically diverse and poorest neighborhoods in the city.

Whites not of Hispanic origin made up 72.2% of the total population.

In 1940, Portland&#x27;s African-American population was approximately 2,000 and largely consisted of railroad employees and their families. During the war-time Liberty Ship construction boom, the need for workers drew many Black people to the city. The new influx of Black people settled in specific neighborhoods, such as the Albina district and Vanport. The May 1948 flood which destroyed Vanport eliminated the only integrated neighborhood, and an influx of blacks into the northeast quadrant of the city continued. Portland&#x27;s longshoremen racial mix was described as being &quot;lily-white&quot; in the 1960s when the local International Longshore and Warehouse Union declined to represent grain handlers since some were black.

Over two-thirds of Oregon&#x27;s African-American residents live in Portland. As of the 2000 census, three of its high schools (Cleveland, Lincoln and Wilson) were over 70% White, reflecting the overall population, while Jefferson High School was 87% non-White. The remaining six schools have a higher number of non-Whites, including Blacks and Asians. Hispanic students average from 3.3% at Wells to 31% at Roosevelt.

Portland residents identifying solely as Asian Americans account for 7.1% of the population; an additional 1.8% is partially of Asian heritage. Vietnamese Americans make up 2.2% of Portland&#x27;s population, and make up the largest Asian ethnic group in the city, followed by Chinese (1.7%), Filipinos (0.6%), Japanese (0.5%), Koreans (0.4%), Laotians (0.4%), Hmong (0.2%), and Cambodians (0.1%). A small population of Iu Mien live in Portland. Portland has two Chinatowns, with New Chinatown in the &#x27;Jade District&#x27; along SE 82nd Avenue with Chinese supermarkets, Hong Kong style noodle houses, dim sum, and Vietnamese phở restaurants.

With about 12,000 Vietnamese residing in the city proper, Portland has one of the largest Vietnamese populations in America per capita. According to statistics, there are over 4,500 Pacific Islanders in Portland, making up 0.7% of the city&#x27;s population. There is a Tongan community in Portland, who arrived in the area in the 1970s, and Tongans and Pacific Islanders as a whole are one of the fastest-growing ethnic groups in the Portland area.

Portland&#x27;s population has been and remains predominantly White. In 1940, Whites were over 98% of the city&#x27;s population. In 2009, Portland had the fifth-highest percentage of White residents among the 40 largest U.S. metropolitan areas. A 2007 survey of the 40 largest cities in the U.S. concluded Portland&#x27;s urban core has the highest percentage of White residents. Some scholars have noted the Pacific Northwest as a whole is &quot;one of the last Caucasian bastions of the United States&quot;. While Portland&#x27;s diversity was historically comparable to metro Seattle and Salt Lake City, those areas grew more diverse in the late 1990s and 2000s. Portland not only remains White, but migration to Portland is disproportionately White.

The Oregon Territory banned African American settlement in 1849. In the 19th century, certain laws allowed the immigration of Chinese laborers but prohibited them from owning property or bringing their families. The early 1920s saw the rapid growth of the Ku Klux Klan, which became very influential in Oregon politics, culminating in the election of Walter M. Pierce as governor.

The largest influxes of minority populations occurred during World War II, as the African American population grew by a factor of 10 for wartime work. After World War II, the Vanport flood in 1948 displaced many African Americans. As they resettled, redlining directed the displaced workers from the wartime settlement to neighboring Albina. There and elsewhere in Portland, they experienced police hostility, lack of employment, and mortgage discrimination, leading to half the black population leaving after the war.

In the 1980s and 1990s, radical skinhead groups flourished in Portland. In 1988, Mulugeta Seraw, an Ethiopian immigrant, was killed by three skinheads. The response to his murder involved a community-driven series of rallies, campaigns, nonprofits and events designed to address Portland&#x27;s racial history, leading to a city considered significantly more tolerant than in 1988 at Seraw&#x27;s death.

A 2019 survey by the city&#x27;s budget office showed that homelessness is perceived as the top challenge facing Portland, and was cited as a reason people move and do not participate in park programs. Calls to 911 concerning &quot;unwanted persons&quot; have significantly increased between 2013 and 2018, and the police are increasingly dealing with homeless and mentally ill. Homelessness has taken a toll on the sense of safety among visitors, and residents and business owners are adversely impacted. Even though homeless services and shelter beds have increased, as of 2020 homelessness is considered an intractable problem in Portland.

The proposed budget for 2022–23 includes $5.8MM to buy land for affordable housing, and $36MM to equip and operate &quot;safe rest villages&quot;. A 2022 initiative approved by the Portland city council makes homeless camping illegal, eventually requiring homeless individuals to move into mass shelters.

Each neighborhood is represented by a volunteer-based neighborhood association which serves as a liaison between residents of the neighborhood and the city government. The city provides funding to neighborhood associations through seven district coalitions, each of which is a geographical grouping of several neighborhood associations. Most (but not all) neighborhood associations belong to one of these district coalitions.

A small portion of southeastern Portland is in the 5th District, currently represented by Democrat Janelle Bynum. Lori Chavez-DeRemer was the first Republican to represent a significant portion of the city in the U.S. House of Representatives since 1975, from 2023 to 2025. Both of Oregon&#x27;s senators, Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley, are progressive Democrats from Portland.

In the 2008 presidential election, Democratic candidate Barack Obama easily carried Portland, winning 245,464 votes from city residents to 50,614 for his Republican rival, John McCain. In the 2012 presidential election, Democratic candidate Barack Obama again easily carried Portland, winning 256,925 votes from Multnomah county residents to 70,958 for his Republican rival, Mitt Romney.

Sam Adams, the former mayor of Portland, became the city&#x27;s first openly gay mayor in 2009. In 2004, 59.7 percent of Multnomah County voters cast ballots against Oregon Ballot Measure 36, which amended the Oregon Constitution to prohibit recognition of same-sex marriages. The measure passed with 56.6% of the statewide vote. Multnomah County is one of two counties where a majority voted against the initiative; the other is Benton County, which includes Corvallis, home of Oregon State University. On April 28, 2005, Portland became the only city in the nation to withdraw from a Joint Terrorism Task Force. As of February 19, 2015, the Portland city council approved permanently staffing the JTTF with two of its city&#x27;s police officers.

===City planning and development===
The city consulted with urban planners as far back as 1904, resulting in the development of Washington Park and the 40-Mile Loop greenway, which connects many of the city&#x27;s parks. Portland is often cited as an example of a city with strong land use planning controls. This is largely the result of statewide land conservation policies adopted in 1973 under Governor Tom McCall, in particular the requirement for an urban growth boundary (UGB) for every city and metropolitan area. The opposite extreme, a city with few or no controls, is typically illustrated by Houston.

Oregon&#x27;s 1973 &quot;urban growth boundary&quot; law limits the boundaries for large-scale development in each metropolitan area in Oregon. This limits access to utilities such as sewage, water and telecommunications, as well as coverage by fire, police and schools. Portland&#x27;s urban growth boundary, adopted in 1979, separates urban areas (where high-density development is encouraged and focused) from traditional farm land (where restrictions on non-agricultural development are very strict). This was atypical in an era when automobile use led many areas to neglect their core cities in favor of development along interstate highways, in suburbs, and satellite cities.

The original state rules included a provision for expanding urban growth boundaries, but critics felt this was not being accomplished. In 1995, the State passed a law requiring cities to expand UGBs to provide enough undeveloped land for a 20-year supply of future housing at projected growth levels. In 2007, the legislature changed the law to require the maintenance of an estimated 50 years of growth within the boundary, as well as the protection of accompanying farm and rural lands. The growth boundary, along with efforts of the Portland Development Commission to create economic development zones, has led to the development of a large portion of downtown, a large number of mid- and high-rise developments, and an overall increase in housing and business density.

Prosper Portland (formerly the Portland Development Commission) is a semi-public agency that plays a major role in downtown development; city voters created it in 1958 to serve as the city&#x27;s urban renewal agency. It provides housing and economic development programs within the city and works behind the scenes with major local developers to create large projects. In the early 1960s, the Portland Development Commission led the razing of a large Italian-Jewish neighborhood downtown, bounded roughly by I-405, the Willamette River, 4th Avenue and Market street. Mayor Neil Goldschmidt took office in 1972 as a proponent of bringing housing and the associated vitality back to the downtown area, which was seen as emptying out after 5 pm. The effort has had dramatic effects in the 30 years since, with many thousands of new housing units clustered in three areas: north of Portland State University (between I-405, SW Broadway, and SW Taylor St.); the RiverPlace development along the waterfront under the Marquam (I-5) bridge; and most notably in the Pearl District (between I-405, Burnside St., NW Northrup St., and NW 9th Ave.).

Historically, environmental consciousness has weighed significantly in the city&#x27;s planning and development efforts. Portland was one of the first cities in the United States to promote and integrate alternative forms of transportation, such as the MAX Light Rail and extensive bike paths. The Urban Greenspaces Institute, housed in Portland State University Geography Department&#x27;s Center for Mapping Research, promotes better integration of the built and natural environments. The institute works on urban park, trail, and natural areas planning issues, both at the local and regional levels. In October 2009, the Portland City Council unanimously adopted a climate action plan that will cut the city&#x27;s greenhouse gas emissions to 80% below 1990 levels by 2050.

As of 2012, Portland was the largest city in the United States that did not add fluoride to its public water supply, and fluoridation has historically been a subject of controversy in the city. Portland voters have four times voted against fluoridation, in 1956, 1962, 1980 (repealing a 1978 vote in favor), and 2013. In 2012 the city council, responding to advocacy from public health organizations and others, voted unanimously to begin fluoridation by 2014. Fluoridation opponents forced a public vote on the issue, and on May 21, 2013, city voters again rejected fluoridation.

==Education==
===Primary and secondary education===
Nine public school districts and many private schools include sections of Portland. Portland Public Schools is the largest school district, operating 86 public schools. In addition to PPS, other school districts in Multnomah County that serve parts of the city include the Beaverton School District, Centennial School District, David Douglas School District, Parkrose School District, Reynolds School District, Riverdale School District, and Scappoose School District. Portions in Clackamas County are in the North Clackamas School District and Centennial School District. Portions in Washington County are in Portland Public Schools.

David Douglas High School, in the Powellhurst neighborhood, has the largest enrollment of any public high school in the city. Other high schools include Benson, Cleveland, Franklin, Grant, Jefferson, Madison, Parkrose, Roosevelt, and Ida B Wells-Barnett (formerly Woodrow Wilson), and several suburban high schools which serve the city&#x27;s outer areas. Established in 1869, Lincoln High School (formerly Portland High School) is the city&#x27;s oldest public education institution, and is one of two of the oldest high schools west of the Mississippi River (after San Francisco&#x27;s Lowell High School).

Former public schools in the city included Washington High School, which operated from 1906 until 1981, as well as Adams and Jackson, which also closed the same year.

===Higher education===

Portland State University has the second-largest enrollment rate of any university in the state (after Oregon State University), with a student body of nearly 30,000. It has been named among the top fifteen percentile of American regional universities by The Princeton Review for undergraduate education, and has been internationally recognized for its degrees in Master of Business Administration and urban planning. The city is also home to the Oregon Health &amp; Science University, as well as Portland Community College.

Notable private universities include the University of Portland, a Roman Catholic university affiliated with the Congregation of Holy Cross; Reed College, a liberal arts college, and Lewis &amp; Clark College.

==Media==


&quot;The Oregonian&quot; is the only daily general-interest newspaper serving Portland. It also circulates throughout the state and in Clark County, Washington.

Smaller local newspapers, distributed free of charge in newspaper boxes and at venues around the city, include the &quot;Portland Tribune&quot; (general-interest paper published on Wednesdays), &quot;Willamette Week&quot; (general-interest alternative weekly published on Wednesdays), and &quot;The Portland Mercury&quot; (another alt-weekly, targeted at younger urban readers and published every other Thursday). The Portland area also has newspapers that are published for specific communities, including &quot;The Asian Reporter&quot; (a weekly covering Asian news, both international and local) and &quot;The Skanner&quot; (a weekly African-American newspaper covering both local and national news). The &quot;Portland Business Journal&quot; covers business-related news on a weekly basis, as does &quot;The Daily Journal of Commerce&quot;, its main competitor. &quot;Portland Monthly&quot; is a monthly news and culture magazine. &quot;The Bee&quot;, over 110 years old, is another neighborhood newspaper serving the inner southeast neighborhoods.

==Infrastructure==
===Healthcare===

Legacy Health, a non-profit healthcare system in Portland, operates multiple facilities in the city and surrounding suburbs. These include Legacy Emanuel, founded in 1912, in Northeast Portland; and Legacy Good Samaritan, founded in 1875, and in Northwest Portland. Randall&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Hospital operates at the Legacy Emanuel Campus. Good Samaritan has centers for breast health, cancer, and stroke, and is home to the Legacy Devers Eye Institute, the Legacy Obesity and Diabetes Institute, the Legacy Diabetes and Endocrinology Center, the Legacy Rehabilitation Clinic of Oregon, and the Linfield-Good Samaritan School of Nursing.

The Catholic-affiliated Providence Health &amp; Services operates Providence Portland Medical Center in the North Tabor neighborhood of the city. Oregon Health &amp; Science University is a university hospital formed in 1974. The Veterans Affairs Medical Center operates next to the Oregon Health &amp; Science University main campus. Adventist Medical Center also serves the city. Shriners Hospital for Children is a small children&#x27;s hospital established in 1923.

===Transportation===


The Portland metropolitan area has transportation services common to major U.S. cities, though Oregon&#x27;s emphasis on proactive land-use planning and transit-oriented development within the urban growth boundary means commuters have multiple well-developed options.

In 2008, 12.6% of all commutes in Portland were on public transit. TriMet operates most of the region&#x27;s buses and the MAX (short for Metropolitan Area Express) light rail system, which connects the city and suburbs. Opened in 1986, the MAX system has expanded to five lines, with the latest being the Orange Line to Milwaukie, which began operating in September 2015. WES Commuter Rail opened in February 2009 in Portland&#x27;s western suburbs, linking Beaverton and Wilsonville.

The city-owned Portland Streetcar serves two routes in the Central City – downtown and adjacent districts. The first line, which opened in 2001 and was extended in 2005–07, operates from the South Waterfront District through Portland State University and north through the West End of downtown, to shopping areas and dense residential districts north and northwest of downtown. The second line that opened in 2012 added of tracks on the east side of the Willamette River and across the Broadway Bridge to a connection with the original line. The east-side line completed a loop to the tracks on the west side of the river upon completion of the new Tilikum Crossing in 2015, and, in anticipation of that, had been named the Central Loop line in 2012. However, it was renamed the Loop Service, with an A Loop (clockwise) and B Loop (counterclockwise), when it became a complete loop with the opening of the Tilikum Crossing bridge.

Fifth and Sixth avenues within downtown comprise the Portland Transit Mall, two streets devoted primarily to bus and light rail traffic with limited automobile access. Opened in 1977 for buses, the transit mall was renovated and rebuilt in 2007–09, with light rail added. Starting in 1975 and lasting nearly four decades, all transit service within downtown Portland was free, the area being known by TriMet as Fareless Square, but a need for minor budget cuts and funding needed for expansion prompted the agency to limit free rides to rail service only in 2010, and subsequently to discontinue the fare-free zone entirely in 2012.

TriMet provides real-time tracking of buses and trains with its TransitTracker, and makes the data available to software developers so they can create customized tools of their own.

I-5 connects Portland with the Willamette Valley, Southern Oregon, and California to the south and with Washington to the north. I-405 forms a loop with I-5 around the central downtown area of the city and I-205 is a loop freeway route on the east side which connects to the Portland International Airport. U.S. 26 supports commuting within the metro area and continues to the Pacific Ocean westward and Mount Hood and Central Oregon eastward. U.S. 30 has a main, bypass, and business route through the city extending to Astoria to the west; through Gresham, Oregon, and the eastern exurbs, and connects to I-84, traveling towards Boise, Idaho.

Portland&#x27;s main airport is Portland International Airport (PDX), about 20 minutes by car (40 minutes by MAX) northeast of downtown. Portland is also home to Oregon&#x27;s only public use heliport, the Portland Downtown Heliport.

Amtrak, the national passenger rail system, provides service to Portland at Union Station on three routes. Long-haul train routes include the &quot;Coast Starlight&quot; (with service from Los Angeles to Seattle) and the &quot;Empire Builder&quot; (with service to Chicago). The &quot;Amtrak Cascades&quot; state-supported trains operate between Vancouver, B.C., and Eugene, Oregon, and serve Portland several times daily. The city is also served by Greyhound Lines intercity bus service, which also operates BoltBus, an express bus service. The city&#x27;s first airport was the Swan Island Municipal Airport, which was closed in the 1940s.

Portland is the only city in the United States that owns operating mainline steam locomotives, donated to the city in 1958 by the railroads that ran them. Spokane, Portland &amp; Seattle 700 and the world-famous Southern Pacific 4449 can be seen several times a year pulling a special excursion train, either locally or on an extended trip. The &quot;Holiday Express&quot;, pulled over the tracks of the Oregon Pacific Railroad on weekends in December, has become a Portland tradition over its several years running. These trains and others are operated by volunteers of the Oregon Rail Heritage Foundation, an amalgamation of rail preservation groups which collaborated on the finance and construction of the Oregon Rail Heritage Center, a permanent and publicly accessible home for the locomotives, which opened in 2012 adjacent to OMSI.

In Portland, cycling is a significant mode of transportation. As the city has been particularly supportive of urban bicycling it now ranks highly among the most bicycle-friendly cities in the world.
Bicycles accounted for 2.8% of commuting in 2021. Bicycle commuting declined by 46% between 2016 and 2022 according to Portland Bureau of Transportation report. For its achievements in promoting cycling as an everyday means of transportation, Portland has been recognized by the League of American Bicyclists and other cycling organizations for its network of on-street bicycling facilities and other bicycle-friendly services, being one of only three U.S. cities to have earned a Platinum-level rating. A new bicycle-sharing system, Biketown, launched on July 19, 2016, with 100 stations in the city&#x27;s central and eastside neighborhoods.

Portland abolished the requirement for parking minimum as well as Minneapolis and Austin.

As of 2015, Portland is owed $32.4 million in unpaid parking citations due to the city government&#x27;s refusal to collect more aggressively.

===Water===
The cities main source of drinking water is several reservoirs in the Bull Run Watershed, which consists of roughly of forested land just west of Mount Hood. The city also operates 25 groundwater wells near the Columbia River in Northeast Portland, which supplements the cities water supply during the summer.

<text>Pan and scan is a film editing technique of adjusting widescreen film images, rendering them compatible for broadcast on television screens in the 4:3 aspect ratio. This technique primarily involves cropping the sides of the original widescreen image to focus on the composition&#x27;s most important aspects. Film editors often risk losing key visual elements in the scene when cropping.

To retain essential details, they use &quot;pan and scan,&quot; shifting the image to highlight important content, ensuring a suitable home viewing experience. This technique was prevalent in the popular use of VHS, before widescreen home media such as LaserDisc, DVD, and Blu-ray. The vertical equivalent, known as &quot;tilt and scan&quot; or &quot;reverse pan and scan&quot;, is sometimes used such as when older films like &quot;Cinderella&quot; (1950) were adapted for widescreen formats.

These techniques have garnered prominent criticism over the years since their inception. Critics of this technique often disapprove of pan-and-scan cropping as it can remove large portions of the original image: up to 43% of the original image on 2.35:1 films; up to 48% on earlier 2.55:1 films, and up to 52% of 2.76:1 films. Additionally, the new shots or cuts can result in moment-to-moment alterations in intended cinematic effects including pacing, atmosphere and suspense.

As such, in some cases pan and scan can result in the changing of a director&#x27;s and/or cinematographer&#x27;s original vision and intentions for the film&#x27;s or a particular scene&#x27;s field-of-view in addition to omitting large amounts of information from the film itself for audiences.

==History ==
For the first several decades of television broadcasting, sets displayed images with a 4:3 (1.33:1) aspect ratio, similar to most theatrical films before 1960. However, in the early to mid-1950s, to compete with television and lure audiences away from their sets, producers of theatrical motion pictures began to use &quot;widescreen&quot; formats such as CinemaScope and Todd-AO, which provided more panoramic vistas and presented other compositional opportunities. 

To accommodate a wider aspect ratio, television broadcasters adopted the pan and scan technique, which maintained image quality and size but sacrificed the ability to view the entire image. A film subject to pan and scan often lost around half of its horizontal size due to cropping. Letterboxing was an alternative method of displaying widescreen films on a 4:3 screen, as it maintained the original aspect ratio by adding black space above and below the image. However, this invariably reduced the size of the image and consequently, the image quality as well. 

In 1986, Voyager Company decided to make it company policy to only release widescreen films on LaserDisc in their original aspect ratio rather than pan and scan formats that were common for home media releases at the time. Many other home video labels followed suit.

In the 1990s, widescreen televisions offered a wider 16:9 aspect ratio (1.78 times the height instead of 1.33) and allowed films with aspect ratios of 1.66:1 and 1.85:1 to fill most or all of the screen, with minimal letterboxing or cropping required. DVD packaging began to use the expression, &quot;16:9 – Enhanced for Widescreen TVs.&quot;

Films shot with aspect ratios of 2.20:1, 2.35:1, 2.39:1, 2.55:1, and especially 2.76:1 (&quot;Ben-Hur&quot; for example), might still be problematic when displayed on televisions of any type. However, when the DVD is &quot;anamorphically enhanced for widescreen&quot;, or the film is telecast on a high-definition channel and viewed on a widescreen TV, the black spaces are smaller, and the effect is much like watching a film on a theatrical wide screen. 

, though aspect ratios of 16:9 (and occasionally 16:10, mostly for computers and tablets) remain standard, wider-screen consumer TVs in 21:9 have been marketed by several manufacturers.

==Techniques==
During the &quot;pan and scan&quot; process, an editor selects the parts of the original filmed composition that seem to be the focus of the shot and makes sure that these are copied (&quot;scanned&quot;). When the important action shifts to a new position in the frame, the operator moves the scanner to follow it, creating the effect of a pan shot. In a scene in which the focus does not gradually shift from one horizontal position to another—such as actors at each extreme engaging in rapid conversation with each other—the editor may choose to &quot;cut&quot; from one to the other rather than rapidly panning back and forth.

If the actors are closer together on the screen, the editor may pan slightly, alternately cropping one or the other partially. This method allows the maximum resolution of the image since it uses all the available vertical video scan lines—which is especially important for NTSC televisions, having a rather low number of lines available. It also gives a full-screen image on a traditional television set; hence pan-and-scan versions of films on VHS or DVD are often known as &quot;Fullscreen&quot;.

However, it also has several drawbacks. Some visual information is unavoidably cropped out. It can also change a shot in which the camera was originally stationary to one in which it is frequently panning, or change a single continuous shot into one with frequent cuts. In a shot that was originally panned to show something new, or one in which something enters the shot from off-camera, it changes the timing of these appearances to the audience.

As an example, in the film &quot;Oliver!&quot;, made in Panavision, the criminal Bill Sikes commits a murder. The murder takes place mostly offscreen, behind a staircase wall, and Oliver is a witness to it. As Sikes steps back from behind the wall, we see Oliver from the back watching him in terror.

In the pan-and-scan version of the film, the audience sees Oliver&#x27;s reaction as the murder is being committed, but not when Sikes steps backward from the wall having done it. Often in a pan and scan telecast, a character will seem to be speaking offscreen, when what has happened is that the pan and scan technique has cut their image out of the screen.

===Shoot and protect===
As television screenings of feature films became more common and more financially important, cinematographers began to work on compositions that would keep the vital information within the &quot;TV safe area&quot; of the frame. For example, the BBC suggested programme makers who were recording in 16:9 frame their shots in a 14:9 aspect ratio which was then broadcast on analogue services with small black bars at the top and bottom of the picture, while owners of widescreen TV sets receiving digital broadcasts would see the full 16:9 picture (this is known as Shoot and protect).

===Reframing===
One modern alternative to pan and scan is to directly adjust the source material. This is very rare: the only known uses are computer-generated features, such as those produced by Pixar, and video games such as &quot;BioShock&quot;.

They call their approach to full-screen versions &quot;reframing&quot;: some shots are pan and scan, while others (such as notably Warner Bros.&#x27; &quot;The Lego Movie&quot;) are transferred open matte (a full widescreen image extended with added image above and below; though for &quot;The Lego Movie&quot;, the transferred open matte used a widescreen image cropped to 16:9 with added image above and below to create a 1.37:1-framed Academy ratio image; this version was created for theaters that do not have the anamorphic lens projection equipment).

Another method is to keep the camera angle as tight as a pan shot, but move the location of characters, objects, or the camera, so that the subjects fit in the frame. The advent of DVDs and their use of anamorphic presentation, coupled with the increasing popularity of widescreen televisions and computer monitors, have rendered pan and scan less important. Fullscreen versions of films originally produced in widescreen are still available in the United States.

===Open matte===
Filmmakers may also create an original image that includes visual information that extends above and below the widescreen theatrical image; this is known as an open matte image. This may still be considered pan-and-scanned, but it gives the compositor the freedom to &quot;zoom out&quot; or &quot;un-crop&quot; the image to include not only the full width of the wide-format image, but additional visual content at the top and/or bottom of the screen, not included in the widescreen version.

As a general rule (prior to the adoption of DVD), special effects would be done within the theatrical aspect ratio, but not the full-frame thereof; also the expanded image area can sometimes include extraneous objects—such as cables, microphone booms, jet vapor trails, or overhead telephone wires—not intended to be included in the frame, depending upon the nature of the shot and how well the full frame was protected.

A more unusual use of the technique is present in the 17 original Dragon Ball Z movies, released from 1986 to 1996. The films were displayed in 1.85:1 during their theatrical release, but this was in fact cut down from 1.37:1 animation- a choice made so that the VHS releases would be nearly uncropped.

===Adjusting cinematography to account for aspect ratios===
Changes in screen angle (panning) may be necessary to prevent closeups between two speakers where only one person is visible in the pan-and-scan version and both participants seem to speak alternately to persons off camera; this comes at the cost of losing the smoothness of scenes. Inversely, the cropping of a film originally shown in the standard ratio to fit widescreen televisions may cut off foreground or background, such as a tap-dance scene in which much attention is directed appropriately at a dancer&#x27;s feet. This situation will commonly occur whenever a widescreen TV is set to display full images without stretching (often called the zoom setting) on images with an aspect ratio of 1.78:1 or less. The solution is to pillar box the image by adding black bars on either side of the image, which maintains the full picture height. In Europe, where the PAL TV format offers more resolution to begin with, &quot;pan-and-scan&quot; broadcasts and &quot;pan-and-scan&quot; DVDs of movies originally shown in widescreen are relatively rare, unless it is of programming broadcasts aimed for family viewing times like &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;. However, on some channels in some countries (such as the United Kingdom), films with an aspect ratio of more than 1.85:1 are panned and scanned slightly to fit the broadcast 1.78:1 ratio.

==Criticism ==
Some directors still dislike the use of pan and scan because they feel it takes away from their directorial vision. For instance, Sydney Pollack decided to shoot his 1985 film &quot;Out of Africa&quot; in a matted 1.85:1 aspect ratio because he was tired of having his movies, which had generally been shot in his preferred format of Anamorphic 2.39:1, &quot;butchered&quot; for television and home video. 

Pollack also brought a lawsuit against a Danish public television channel over a screening of his 1975 film &quot;Three Days of the Condor&quot; in pan and scan in 1991. The court ruled that the pan and scan conducted by Danish television was a &quot;mutilation&quot; of the film and a violation of Pollack&#x27;s droit moral (his legal right as an artist to maintain his reputation by protecting the integrity of his work). The court ruled in favor of the defendant. 

Phil Lord and Christopher Miller made two versions of &quot;The Lego Movie&quot;, one in 2.39:1 anamorphic format and another in 1.37:1 open-matte spherical format because some theaters did not employ anamorphic lenses, and also because they were tired of having their movies, which had been shot in their generally preferred aspect ratio of 2.39:1panned-and-scanned for TV broadcasts (and, in the case of &quot;Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs&quot;, its DVD release which includes both the original 2.39:1 theatrical and the cropped 16:9 versions). 

Steven Spielberg initially refused to release a pan-and-scan version of &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark,&quot; but eventually gave in (although he successfully ordered the letterboxed format for the home video releases of &quot;The Color Purple&quot; and &quot;Always&quot;). Woody Allen refused altogether to release one of &quot;Manhattan&quot;, and the letterbox version is therefore the only version available on VHS and DVD (even though one VHS release includes the typical pan-and-scan disclaimer on the cover). 

The pan and scan versions of the widescreen animated shorts from the 1950s were also criticized for missing details. For example, in &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;, the babysitter grabbing the baby out of Tom&#x27;s hands near the end of &quot;Tot Watchers&quot; and the ant blowing his horn near the end of &quot;Barbecue Brawl&quot;, are cropped out. 

Several prominent film critics, most notably Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert, have also criticized pan and scan, and agreed with directors that movies should be presented as they were intended.
