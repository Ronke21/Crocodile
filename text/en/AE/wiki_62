<text>Nu metal (sometimes stylized as nü-metal, with a metal umlaut) is a subgenre of that combines elements of heavy metal music with elements of other music genres such as hip hop, funk, industrial, and grunge. Nu metal rarely features guitar solos or other displays of musical technique, and emphasizes rhythm with instrumentation that is heavily syncopated. Nu metal guitarists typically use seven-string guitars that are down-tuned to produce a heavier sound. Vocal styles are often rhythmic and influenced by hip hop, and include singing, rapping, screaming and sometimes growling. DJs are occasionally featured to provide instrumentation such as sampling, turntable scratching and electronic background music. Nu metal is one of the key genres of the new wave of American heavy metal. 

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, bands like Pantera, Helmet, and Faith No More were influential in the development of nu metal with their groove metal and alternative metal styles. Korn is often credited as pioneering the subgenre in the mid-1990s with their self-titled debut album. Nu metal became popular in the late 1990s, with bands and artists such as Korn, Limp Bizkit, and Slipknot all releasing albums that sold millions of copies. Its popularity continued through the early 2000s, with bands such as Papa Roach, Staind, and P.O.D. all selling multi-platinum albums. The popularity of nu metal came to a peak in 2001 with Linkin Park&#x27;s diamond-selling album &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;. By the mid-2000s, however, the oversaturation of bands combined with the underperformance of several high-profile releases led to the subgenre&#x27;s decline, leading to the rise of metalcore and many nu metal bands disbanding or abandoning their established sound in favor of other genres.

The 2010s brought a nu metal revival; many bands that combined it with other genres (for example, metalcore and deathcore) emerged, and some nu metal bands from the 1990s and early 2000s returned to the nu metal sound. Bands such as Of Mice &amp; Men, Emmure, Issues, My Ticket Home, and Bring Me the Horizon combined nu metal with metalcore or deathcore. Artists like Grimes, Poppy, and Rina Sawayama integrated nu metal sounds into electronic pop music in the late 2010s and early 2020s, and interest in nu metal rose in the early 2020s.

==Characteristics and fashion==


===Terminology and origins===
Nu metal is a subgenre of alternative metal. Sometimes stylized as nü-metal, the genre has also been dubbed aggro-metal. MTV states that the early nu metal group Korn &quot;arrived in 1993 into the burgeoning alternative metal scene, which would morph into nü-metal the way college rock became alternative rock.&quot; &quot;Stereogum&quot; similarly said that nu metal was a &quot;weird outgrowth of the Lollapalooza-era alt-metal scene&quot;. Nu metal merges elements of heavy metal music with elements of other music genres such as hip hop, grunge, funk, and alternative rock according to Blabbermouth.net. Nu metal bands use many elements of heavy metal genres such as rap metal, groove metal, and funk metal. Some nu metal bands, such as Static-X and Dope, made nu metal music with elements of industrial metal. In contrast with other heavy metal subgenres, nu metal tends to use the same structure of verses, choruses, and bridges as those in pop music.

===Musical characteristics===
====Instrumentation====
Instrumentation in nu metal is heavily syncopated and is based mostly on guitar riffs, with riffs often being inspired by groove metal. Mid-song bridges and a general lack of guitar solos contrasts it with other genres of heavy metal. Kory Grow of &quot;Revolver&quot; wrote, &quot;... [i]n its efforts to tune down and simplify riffs, effectively drove a stake through the heart of the guitar solo&quot;. Another contrast with other heavy metal genres is nu metal&#x27;s emphasis on rhythm, rather than on complexity or mood. The wah pedal is occasionally featured in nu metal music.

Nu metal bassists and drummers are often influenced by funk and hip hop, respectively, adding to nu metal&#x27;s rhythmic nature. Blast beats and double bass drumming, which are both common in heavy metal subgenres such as black metal, thrash metal and death metal, are uncommon in nu metal, with drummers such as Slipknot&#x27;s Joey Jordison and Mudvayne&#x27;s Matt McDonough being notable exceptions. Nu metal&#x27;s similarities with many heavy metal subgenres include its use of common time, distorted guitars, and power chords and note structures primarily revolving around Dorian, Aeolian or Phrygian modes. While loud and heavily distorted electric guitars are a core feature of all metal genres, nu metal guitarists took the sounds of &quot;violence and destruction&quot; to new levels with their overdriven guitar tone, which music journalists Kitts and Tolinski compared to the &quot;...sound [of] a Mack truck being crushed by a collapsing skyscraper.&quot;

Some nu metal bands use seven-string guitars that are generally down-tuned, rather than traditional Likewise, some bass guitarists use five-string and six-string instruments. in nu metal often features an emphasis on funk elements. In nu metal music, DJs are sometimes featured to provide instrumentation such as sampling, turntable scratching and electronic backgrounds. tends to have hip hop grooves and rhythms.

====Vocals====

Vocal styles used in nu metal music include singing, rapping, screaming and growling. Vocals in nu metal are often rhythmic and influenced by hip hop. While some nu metal bands, such as Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park, have rapping in their music, other nu metal bands, such as Godsmack and Staind, do not.

Nu metal bands occasionally feature hip hop musicians as guests in their songs; Korn&#x27;s song &quot;Children of the Korn&quot; features the rapper Ice Cube, who performed on the band&#x27;s 1998 Family Values Tour. The hip hop musician Nas was featured on Korn&#x27;s song &quot;Play Me&quot;, which is on the band&#x27;s album &quot;Take a Look in the Mirror&quot;. Limp Bizkit has recorded with multiple hip hop musicians including Method Man, Lil Wayne, Xzibit, Redman, DMX and Snoop Dogg. Linkin Park collaborated with hip hop musician Jay-Z on their 2004 extended play &quot;Collision Course&quot;. Kid Rock has recorded with hip hop musicians Eminem and Snoop Dogg. Trevor Baker of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote, &quot;Bands such as Linkin Park, Korn and even the much reviled Limp Bizkit ... did far more to break down the artificial barriers between &#x27;urban music&#x27; and rock than any of their more critically acceptable counterparts.&quot;

====Lyrics====
Lyrics in nu metal songs are often angry or nihilistic; many of the genre&#x27;s lyrics focus on topics such as pain, angst, bullying, emotional issues, abandonment, betrayal, and personal alienation, in a way similar to those of grunge. Many nu metal lyrics that are about these topics tend to be in a very direct tone. However, some songs have lyrics that are about other topics. P.O.D. has used positive lyrics about promise and hope. The nu metal song &quot;Bodies&quot; by Drowning Pool is about moshing. &quot;The Michigan Daily&quot; wrote about Limp Bizkit&#x27;s lyrics, writing that the band &quot;used the nu-metal sound as a way to spin testosterone fueled fantasies into snarky white-boy rap. Oddly, audiences took frontman Fred Durst more seriously than he wanted, failing to see the intentional silliness in many of his songs&quot;. Limp Bizkit&#x27;s lyrics have also been described as misogynistic. Dope&#x27;s lyrics are usually about sex, drugs, parties, women, violence, and relationships. In contrast, according to Josh Chesler of the &quot;Phoenix New Times&quot;, the lyrics of Deftones, who were once considered a nu metal band, &quot;tend to have complex allusions and leave the songs open to many different interpretations.&quot;

===Fashion===

Nu metal clothing typically consists of baggy pants, shirts, and shorts, JNCO jeans, Adidas tracksuits, sports jerseys, baseball caps, baggy hoodies, cargo pants, and sweatpants. Nu metal hairstyles and facial hairstyles include dreadlocks, braids, spiky hair, chin beards, bald heads, goatees, frosted tips, and bleached or dyed hair. Common accessories in nu metal fashion include wallet chains, tattoos, and piercings, especially facial piercings. Nu metal fashion has been compared to hip hop fashion.

Some nu metal bands such as Motograter, Mushroomhead, Mudvayne, and Slipknot wear masks, jumpsuits, costumes, face paint, corpse paint or body paint. A few nu metal bands, such as Coal Chamber, and Kittie are known for having gothic appearances.

==History==
===1980s–1993: Precursors and origins===
Thrash metal band Anthrax was an influence on nu metal by combining hip hop and rap with heavy metal on their 1987 EP &quot;I&#x27;m the Man&quot;; this laid groundwork for development. Nu metal bands often borrowed their heavy metal influence from Pantera, with the pioneering nu metal band Korn&#x27;s lead vocalist Jonathan Davis said about Pantera guitarist Dimebag Darrell, &quot;if there was no Dimebag Darrell, there would be no Korn&quot;.

===1993–1997: Early years===
Joel McIver acknowledged Korn as the band that created and pioneered the nu metal genre with its demo &quot;Neidermayer&#x27;s Mind&quot;, which was released in 1993. McIver also acknowledged Korn as the band that started the new wave of American heavy metal, which is a heavy metal music movement that started in the 1990s. The aggressive riffs of Korn, the rapping of Limp Bizkit, and the melodic ballads of Staind created the sonic template for nu metal. The origins of the term &quot;nu metal&quot; are often attributed to the work of producer Ross Robinson, who has been called &quot;The Godfather of Nu Metal&quot; between producers. Robinson has produced for nu metal bands such as Korn, Limp Bizkit and Slipknot. Many of the first nu metal bands, such as Korn and Deftones, came from California; however, the genre soon spread across the United States and many bands arose from various states, including Limp Bizkit from Florida, Staind from Massachusetts, and Slipknot from Iowa. In the book &quot;Brave Nu World&quot;, Tommy Udo wrote about the nu metal band Coal Chamber, &quot;There&#x27;s some evidence to suggest that Coal Chamber were the first band to whom the tag &#x27;nu metal&#x27; was actually applied, in a live review in &quot;Spin&quot; magazine.&quot;

In 1994, Korn released their self-titled debut album, which is widely considered the first nu metal album. Korn had experienced underground popularity at this time; their debut album peaked at number 72 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. In 1995, the band Sugar Ray released its debut studio album &quot;Lemonade and Brownies&quot;, an album described as both funk metal and nu metal. In 1995, Deftones released their debut album &quot;Adrenaline&quot;. The album peaked at number 23 on the Heatseekers Albums chart on October 5, 1996. Deftones also were temporarily controversial in 1996 when their vocalist Chino Moreno was blamed by TV news reports for a riot that occurred at the 1996 U-Fest festival on October 5, 1996. &quot;Adrenaline&quot; was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in the summer of 1999. It was also certified platinum by the RIAA in September 2008.
Sepultura&#x27;s 1996 album &quot;Roots&quot; features nu metal elements that were considered influential to the genre, while &quot;Roots&quot; itself was influenced by Korn&#x27;s self-titled debut album. Nu metal continued to rise in popularity when Korn&#x27;s 1996 album &quot;Life Is Peachy&quot; peaked at number 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and sold 106,000 copies in its first week of release. Attention through Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s 1996 introduction of Ozzfest was integral to boosting the careers of many nu metal bands, including Limp Bizkit.

===1997–2001: Mainstream breakthrough===
Few artists were playing nu metal until 1997 when bands such as Sevendust, Coal Chamber, Limp Bizkit, and Papa Roach all released their debut albums, in what &quot;Billboard&quot; writer William Goodman calls a &quot;banner year&quot; for the genre. Limp Bizkit released their debut &quot;Three Dollar Bill, Y&#x27;all&quot; in July 1997. The album&#x27;s popularity grew in 1999 as the band&#x27;s mainstream profile began to increase; in March of that year, it went platinum in the United States, and eventually went double platinum in July 2001. Coal Chamber released its self-titled debut album in 1997, which was a minor hit, being certified gold in the United States in 1999. The album was frequently compared to Korn, and Coal Chamber&#x27;s appearance on Ozzfest in 1996 gave the band attention. Coal Chamber appeared on Ozzfest during the next two years. Also in 1997, Sugar Ray released its second studio album &quot;Floored&quot;. The album achieved mainstream success quickly and was certified 2× platinum by the RIAA on February 20, 1998. Although &quot;Floored&quot; is a nu metal album, the only song from the album that achieved chart success was the single &quot;Fly&quot;, which is instead a reggae-oriented song. Although Sugar Ray continued to be extremely popular, the band abandoned the nu metal genre and became a pop rock band with its 1999 studio album &quot;14:59&quot;. Deftones&#x27; second album &quot;Around the Fur&quot;, also released in 1997, peaked at number 29 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 on November 15, 1997. The album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in the summer of 1999, and certified platinum by the RIAA in June 2011.
In 1998, nu metal&#x27;s popularity fully coalesced into mainstream success. &quot;Billboard&quot; cited August 18, 1998, as the &quot;Biggest Day in Nu-Metal History&quot;, which saw the release of Korn&#x27;s third album &quot;Follow the Leader&quot;, Kid Rock&#x27;s major label debut &quot;Devil Without a Cause&quot; and Orgy&#x27;s debut album &quot;Candyass&quot;. &quot;Follow the Leader&quot; peaked at number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, was certified 5× platinum by the RIAA, and paved the way for the success of other nu metal bands. At this point, many nu metal bands were signed to major record labels, and were using elements of heavy metal, hip hop, industrial, or grunge. Hip hop artists Vanilla Ice and Cypress Hill, along with heavy metal bands Sepultura, Primus, Fear Factory, Machine Head, and Slayer released albums that draw from the nu metal genre. In 1999, Korn&#x27;s fourth studio album &quot;Issues&quot; peaked at number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album was certified 3× platinum by the RIAA in one month. The album sold at least 573,000 copies in its first week of release. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, multiple nu metal bands such as Korn, Limp Bizkit and P.O.D. appeared repeatedly on &quot;Total Request Live&quot;. As nu metal became popular, it especially appealed to certain groups of young people. Although Limp Bizkit was particularly popular among &quot;jocks&quot; and fraternity men due to its hedonistic, hypermasculine lyrics, many other nu metal bands, especially the bands with heavier music, instead appealed particularly to mall goths and outsiders who identified with the genre&#x27;s typically angsty lyrics.

The Woodstock 1999 festival featured multiple nu metal artists and bands such as Korn, Limp Bizkit and Sevendust. During and after Limp Bizkit&#x27;s performance at the festival, violence occurred and people tore plywood from the walls during the performance of the band&#x27;s song &quot;Break Stuff&quot;. Several sexual assaults were reported to have happened during the festival; a rape that was reported during Limp Bizkit&#x27;s performance, and gang rape was reported to have occurred during Korn&#x27;s set at the festival. Despite the incidents at the festival, Limp Bizkit&#x27;s popularity and the sales of their then-recent album &quot;Significant Other&quot; were not affected. The album peaked at number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 643,874 copies in its first week of release, topping over one million sold in two weeks, and eventually being certified 7× platinum in 2001. &quot;Significant Other&quot; sold at least 7,237,123 copies in the United States.

In 1999, Slipknot emerged with an extremely heavy nu metal sound, releasing their self-titled album, which was certified platinum in 2000 and 2× platinum in 2005. In a review of the band&#x27;s self-titled album, Rick Anderson of AllMusic wrote about Slipknot, &quot;You thought Limp Bizkit was hard? They&#x27;re the Osmonds. These guys are something else entirely.&quot; Anderson noted the death metal influence on the album. Slipknot drummer Joey Jordison, noted by Anderson for his death metal-influenced drumming, said of Slipknot&#x27;s music: &quot;The roots are death metal, thrash, speed metal, and I could go on and on about all those bands.&quot;

In 1999, Staind&#x27;s second album &quot;Dysfunction&quot; was released; the track &quot;Mudshovel&quot; peaked at number 10 on the Mainstream Rock chart. &quot;Dysfunction&quot; was certified platinum by the RIAA in 2000 and 2× platinum in 2004. In 2000, Limp Bizkit&#x27;s third studio album &quot;Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water&quot; set a record for highest week-one sales of a rock album, selling over 1,000,000 copies in the United States in its first week of release—400,000 of which sold on its first day of release, making it the fastest-selling rock album ever and breaking the world record held for seven years by Pearl Jam&#x27;s &quot;Vs.&quot; &quot;Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water&quot; by Limp Bizkit was certified 6× platinum by the RIAA. That same year, both Papa Roach&#x27;s second studio album &quot;Infest&quot; and Disturbed&#x27;s debut studio album &quot;The Sickness&quot; were released. Both albums became multi-platinum hits. In 2000, P.O.D.&#x27;s album &quot;The Fundamental Elements of Southtown&quot; went platinum in the United States and was the 143rd best-selling album of 2000. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, many nu metal bands performed at Ozzfest, including Kittie, Disturbed, Mudvayne, Linkin Park, Slipknot, Papa Roach, Otep, Static-X, Methods of Mayhem, Taproot and Drowning Pool. Ozzfest was successful, with Ozzfest 2000, for example, selling out and having 19,000 audience members. During that same year, nu metal bands like Papa Roach and Limp Bizkit joined rappers like Eminem and Xzibit on Eminem&#x27;s Anger Management Tour, which had sold-out concerts.
Late in 2000, Linkin Park released their debut album &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;, which was the best-selling debut album by any artist of any genre in the 21st century and nu metal&#x27;s popularity peak. The album was also the best-selling album of 2001. Linkin Park earned a Grammy Award for their second single &quot;Crawling&quot;. Their fourth single, &quot;In the End&quot;, was released late in 2001 and peaked at number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in March 2002. In 2001, Linkin Park&#x27;s album &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; sold 4,800,000 copies in the United States, making it the highest-selling album of the year. Linkin Park&#x27;s album &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; was certified 12× platinum by the RIAA and sold at least 10,222,000 copies in the United States.

Crazy Town&#x27;s debut album &quot;The Gift of Game&quot; peaked at number 9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, went platinum in February 2001, and sold at least 1,500,000 copies in the United States. Worldwide, the album sold at least 2,500,000 copies. Staind&#x27;s 2001 album &quot;Break the Cycle&quot; debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200 with at least 716,000 copies sold in its first week of release. &quot;Break the Cycle&quot; by Staind was certified 5× platinum by the RIAA, with 4,240,000 copies sold in 2001 in the United States. Although the album featured nu metal tracks, a lot of the album showed Staind moving to a softer sound. Noting Staind&#x27;s change in style to a softer sound, Tommy Udo of &quot;Brave Nu World&quot; wrote: &quot;It&#x27;s often said that nobody over the age of 24 could possibly like Limp Bizkit or Korn, but Staind are a more mainstream band and their songs are likely to appeal to a much bigger fanbase.&quot;

In August 2001, Slipknot released their album &quot;Iowa&quot;, which peaked at number 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and went platinum in October 2001. Critic John Mulvey called the album the &quot;absolute triumph of nu metal&quot;. P.O.D.&#x27;s 2001 album &quot;Satellite&quot; went and peaked at number 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. P.O.D.&#x27;s popularity continued in the year 2002. On June 5, 2001, Drowning Pool released a nu metal album titled &quot;Sinner&quot;, which features the song &quot;Bodies&quot;. The album went platinum on August 23, 2001 and its song &quot;Bodies&quot; became one of the most frequently played videos on MTV for new bands. &quot;Bodies&quot; went to number 6 on the Mainstream Rock chart. In 2001, System of a Down&#x27;s album &quot;Toxicity&quot; peaked at number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album was certified 6× platinum in the United States. System of a Down blended nu metal with occasional influences of Middle Eastern music, Greek music, Armenian music, and jazz music, and the band featured political lyrics.

===2001–2004: Continued success and early signs of decline===
In 2003, MTV wrote that nu metal&#x27;s mainstream popularity was declining in 2002, citing that Korn&#x27;s fifth album &quot;Untouchables&quot; and Papa Roach&#x27;s third album &quot;Lovehatetragedy&quot; both sold less than the bands&#x27; previous releases. Korn&#x27;s lead vocalist Jonathan Davis believed music piracy was the reason for the lower amount of sales of &quot;Untouchables&quot; compared to &quot;Follow the Leader&quot; and &quot;Issues&quot; because &quot;Untouchables&quot; had been leaked to the Internet more than four months before its official release date. MTV also wrote that nu metal bands were played less frequently on radio stations and MTV began focusing on other musical genres. MTV wrote that Papa Roach&#x27;s third album &quot;Lovehatetragedy&quot; has less hip hop elements than the band&#x27;s previous album &quot;Infest&quot; and also said that Saliva&#x27;s 2002 album &quot;Back into Your System&quot; has less elements than the band&#x27;s 2001 album &quot;Every Six Seconds&quot;. MTV also wrote that Crazy Town&#x27;s second album &quot;Darkhorse&quot; had no hit singles and sold less than the band&#x27;s previous album &quot;The Gift of Game&quot;. MTV wrote that although Kid Rock&#x27;s album &quot;Cocky&quot; had characteristics of the musician&#x27;s 1998 album &quot;Devil Without a Cause&quot;, &quot;Cocky&quot; song &quot;Forever&quot;, which featured the style of Kid Rock&#x27;s song &quot;Bawitdaba&quot;, was not as popular as &quot;Cocky&quot; country song &quot;Picture&quot;. MTV also wrote, &quot;Another cause for nü-metal and rap-rock&#x27;s slip from the spotlight could be a diluted talent pool caused by so many similar-sounding bands. American Head Charge, Primer 55, Adema, Cold, the Union Underground, Dope, Apartment 26, Hed (Planet Earth) and Skrape—all of whom released albums between 2000 and 2001—left more of a collective impression than individual ones&quot;.

Despite what MTV wrote, the RIAA certified Korn&#x27;s album &quot;Untouchables&quot; platinum in July 2002, and one of the album&#x27;s singles, &quot;Here to Stay&quot;, received a lot of radio play and peaked at number one on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Total Request Live&quot; twice. &quot;Untouchables&quot; sold at least 434,000 copies in first week of release and peaked at number 2 on the Billboard 200. However, &quot;Untouchables&quot; still did not sell as many copies as Korn&#x27;s most commercially successful album, &quot;Follow the Leader&quot;. Linkin Park&#x27;s remix album &quot;Reanimation&quot; was released in July 2002 and sold more than a million copies that year, which MTV described as &quot;impressive for a remix album&quot;. Additionally, P.O.D.&#x27;s popularity continued into 2002 with its 2001 album &quot;Satellite&quot;.

In 2003, Linkin Park&#x27;s album &quot;Meteora&quot; peaked at number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and sold at least 810,000 copies in its first week of being released. &quot;Meteora&quot; by Linkin Park was certified multi-platinum in the United States and sold at least 6,100,000 copies in the United States. Limp Bizkit&#x27;s 2003 album &quot;Results May Vary&quot;, which features a change in sound with many alternative rock songs alongside nu metal songs, peaked at number 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, with sales of at least 325,000 copies in its first week of being released. In 2004, Blabbermouth.net reported that, according to Nielsen SoundScan, &quot;Results May Vary&quot; sold 1,337,356 copies in the United States. However, the album garnered very poor critical reception and consequently performed much weaker than previous Limp Bizkit albums such as &quot;Significant Other&quot; and &quot;Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water&quot;. Korn&#x27;s 2003 album &quot;Take a Look in the Mirror&quot; sold less than previous Korn albums like &quot;Issues&quot; and &quot;Untouchables&quot;. Despite the ongoing decline of the genre, several international bands began to experience success with nu metal, such as Three Days Grace from Canada, and Lostprophets from Wales. Three Days Grace managed to land a hit single in April 2003 with the song &quot;I Hate Everything About You&quot;, while Lostprophets managed a hit single in December 2003 with the song &quot;Last Train Home&quot;, becoming the highest-charting single from a UK-based rock band that year. The Lostprophets&#x27; 2004 album &quot;Start Something&quot; was successful, peaking at number 4 on the UK Album Charts and number 33 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

===2004–2010: Further decline and new directions===
Although nu metal&#x27;s popularity survived into 2002 and 2003, much of it had dropped significantly by 2004. By this point in time, indie and garage rock revival bands such as the Strokes, The White Stripes, and Jet were achieving mainstream success as nu metal&#x27;s popularity started to decline, and by the mid-late 2000s, the popularity of emo exceeded that of nu metal. Also during this time, metalcore, a fusion of extreme metal and hardcore punk, became one of the most popular genres in the new wave of American heavy metal, with the success of bands like Killswitch Engage, Shadows Fall, God Forbid, Unearth, Trivium, and Bullet for My Valentine. Groove metal band Lamb of God also became successful in the heavy metal genre. Stephen Hill of &quot;Louder Sound&quot; called the rise of metalcore after the decline of nu metal &quot;the metalcore revolution&quot;.

By 2004, several nu metal bands had begun to experiment with other genres to adapt to the changes in trends. Linkin Park&#x27;s third studio album &quot;Minutes to Midnight&quot;, released in 2007, was noted for its near-complete departure from the band&#x27;s nu metal sound. Describing the album&#x27;s style, singer Chester Bennington stated, &quot;We&#x27;ve really moved away from anything that sounds like nu-metal.&quot; Nu metal bands such as Disturbed, Soulfly, Drowning Pool, and Slipknot had begun to utilize heavier elements of groove metal, death metal and thrash metal into their music. Similarly to Limp Bizkit; Staind and Papa Roach had also begun experimenting with Alternative Rock into their sound. Staind&#x27;s 2003 album &quot;14 Shades of Grey&quot; was significantly less heavy than previous albums and shows the band&#x27;s departure from nu metal and a movement towards a lighter sound. Papa Roach abandoned the nu metal genre entirely with their 2004 album &quot;Getting Away with Murder&quot;, moving to a hard rock style. System of a Down released two albums in 2005, &quot;Mezmerize&quot; and &quot;Hypnotize&quot;. Both did well commercially and critically, but the band took a more alternative metal approach to the two albums compared to their past three efforts. In 2005, Limp Bizkit released an EP called &quot;The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1)&quot; which had little promotion and advertising. The album was not very popular; its sales fell 67% during its second week of release. In 2006, Limp Bizkit went on hiatus. In 2012, vocalist Fred Durst said:
===2010–2020: Underground revival===

During the mid-2010s, there was a discussion within media of a possible nu metal revival because of bands fusing nu metal with other genres. Despite the lack of radio play and popularity, some nu metal bands recaptured some of their former popularity as they released albums in a nu metal style. Many metalcore and deathcore groups gained moderate popularity in the 2010s and used elements from nu metal. This fusion is nu metalcore. Suicide Silence&#x27;s 2011 album &quot;The Black Crown&quot;, which features elements of nu metal and deathcore, peaked at number 28 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. In 2014, Issues&#x27; self-titled debut album peaked at number 9 on the same chart. The album features elements of metalcore, nu metal, pop and R&amp;B. Of Mice &amp; Men&#x27;s 2014 album &quot;Restoring Force&quot;, which features elements of nu metal, peaked at number 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Bring Me the Horizon, often described as a metalcore band, released their fifth album &quot;That&#x27;s the Spirit&quot;, which peaked at number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, in 2015. The album draws from multiple genres including nu metal and would experiment further with nu metal on their 2020 album &quot;Post Human: Survival Horror&quot;. The band&#x27;s keyboardist has described them as a nu metal band. Motionless In White in &quot;Graveyard Shift&quot; and &quot;Disguise&quot; features elements of industrial, gothic, metalcore and nu metal.

Some media outlets viewed a nu metal revival as beginning in the 2010s with groups like Blood Youth, Cane Hill, Stray From The Path, Sworn In, DangerKids, Islander, and Blind Channel. Within this movement, nu metalcore became increasingly prominent through the popularity of groups like Vein.fm, Loathe and Code Orange. According to &quot;PopMatters&quot; writer Ethan Stewart, Code Orange&#x27;s 2017 album &quot;Forever&quot; led to nu metalcore becoming &quot;one of the most prominent flavors of contemporary metal&quot;.

===2020–present: Mainstream revival and influence on other genres===
While some media outlets believed these 2010s artists marked the start of a nu metal revival, &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; writer Dannii Leivers cited the aforementioned groups as simply hinting towards a revival, instead claiming a revival began in 2021, &quot;a crop of young revivalists... looking to put a brand-new spin on the music of their formative years&quot;, namely Tetrarch. Other notable acts in this wave include Tallah, Orthodox, Vended, and Wargasm.
Electronic and art pop singer-songwriters incorporated nu metal into their sound in the late 2010s and early 2020s. Poppy has incorporated nu metal on her albums &quot;Am I a Girl?&quot; and &quot;I Disagree&quot;, Grimes on album &quot;Miss Anthropocene&quot; and Rina Sawayama on &quot;Sawayama&quot;. The songs &quot;We Appreciate Power&quot; and &quot;Play Destroy&quot; were pioneering examples. Poppy has described this fusion as &quot;nu-Poppy&quot; or &quot;Poppymetal&quot;. &quot;I Disagree&quot; received critical acclaim for this fusion, with single &quot;Bloodmoney&quot; nominated for the 2021 Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance, making her the first female solo artist to be nominated for the award in its history. Dorian Electra incorporated nu metal influences on their album &quot;My Agenda&quot;, as did Ashnikko on &quot;Demidevil&quot;, particularly on single &quot;Cry&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; noted that these mostly female artists have revived nu metal, a mostly male genre, and successfully adapted it to showcase a female perspective. Rina Sawayama said &quot;metal itself lends itself to toxic masculine tropes, but it&#x27;s also almost taking the piss out of a very masculine expression of emotion&quot;. Smaller bands have also rose to the scene in the early 2020s with the genre, including London-based Wargasm, who have been &quot;validated by the nu-metal daddies,&quot; after Korn vocalist Jonathan Davis described them as &quot;his new favourite band.&quot;

In the early 2020s, several media outlets noted that nu metal has undergone a resurgence in interest among Generation Z listeners. In 2023, Google Searches for the term &quot;nu metal&quot; were reported as being at their highest in &quot;nearly 20 years&quot;. Deftones and Slipknot began gaining popularity among Generation Z in the early 2020s when their music was featured in videos on the app
TikTok. Also, several nu metal bands returned and released new music after decades like Staind, Adema, Alien Ant Farm and Kittie. Late 2024 saw the surprise revival of Linkin Park after a seven-year hiatus following the death of frontman Chester Bennington in 2017. With new singer Emily Armstrong of the rock band Dead Sara and new drummer Colin Brittain, the band released their eighth studio album &quot;From Zero&quot; on November 15. Several songs on the album, such as lead single &quot;The Emptiness Machine&quot;, &quot;Heavy Is the Crown&quot;, and &quot;Two Faced&quot; call back to their earlier nu metal sound prominently featured on &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; and &quot;Meteora&quot;.

===Reception===
Despite its popularity in the late 1990s and early 2000s, nu metal has often been criticized by many fans of heavy metal music, often being labelled with derogatory terms such as &quot;mallcore&quot; and &quot;whinecore&quot;. Gregory Heaney of AllMusic called nu metal &quot;one of metal&#x27;s more unfortunate pushes into the mainstream&quot;. Lucy Jones of &quot;NME&quot; called nu metal &quot;the worst genre of all time&quot;. In &quot;Metal: The Definitive Guide : Heavy, NWOBH, Progressive, Thrash, Death ... &quot;, Garry Sharpe-Young described as &quot;a dumbed-down and—thankfully short[-]lived exercise&quot;. When Machine Head moved to the nu metal genre with their album &quot;The Burning Red&quot; and their vocalist Robb Flynn spiked his hair in the fashion of many nu metal musicians, the band were accused of &quot;selling out&quot; and many fans criticized their change of appearance and musical style. Machine Head&#x27;s drummer Dave McClain said, &quot;Pissing people off isn&#x27;t a bad thing, you know? For people to be narrow-minded is bad ... [i]t doesn&#x27;t bother us at all, we know we&#x27;re going to piss people off with this record, but some people hopefully will actually sit down and listen to the whole record&quot;. Robb Flynn, Machine Head&#x27;s vocalist, said 

Jonathan Davis, the vocalist of Korn, spoke about the criticism of nu metal from heavy metal fans, saying: Lamb of God&#x27;s vocalist Randy Blythe criticized the nu metal genre and spoke about its loss of popularity in 2004, saying: &quot;Nu-metal sucks, so that&#x27;s why that&#x27;s dying off. And I think... people are ready for angrier music. I think people are ready for something that&#x27;s real, not, you know, &#x27;I did it all for the nookie.&#x27;&quot; Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine said he would &quot;rather have his eyelids pulled out&quot; than listen to nu metal. Guitarist Gary Holt of Exodus and Slayer said that he &quot;was so glad about&quot; the decline of .

Some musicians who influenced nu metal have tried to distance themselves from the subgenre and its bands. Mike Patton, the vocalist of Faith No More and Mr. Bungle, tried to distance himself from the subgenre and criticized it, even though he is featured on the song &quot;Lookaway&quot; on Sepultura&#x27;s album &quot;Roots&quot;, which is often considered a nu metal album. Patton said of his music&#x27;s influence on nu metal, &quot;I feel no responsibility for that, it&#x27;s their mothers&#x27; fault, not mine&quot;. Helmet frontman Page Hamilton said, &quot;It&#x27;s frustrating that people write [us] off because we&#x27;re affiliated with or credited with or discredited with creating and rap metal ... which we sound nothing like&quot;.

Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails has said he knows some Korn members and that he thinks they are &quot;cool guys&quot;, but he remains critical of nu metal, saying:
In response to reports that Fred Durst, lead singer of Limp Bizkit, is a big fan of Tool, the latter&#x27;s vocalist Maynard James Keenan said, &quot;If the lunch-lady in high school hits on you, you appreciate the compliment, but you&#x27;re not really gonna start dating the lunch-lady, are ya?&quot; While Durst has cited Rage Against the Machine as a major influence, Rage Against the Machine&#x27;s bassist Tim Commerford is open about his hatred of Limp Bizkit, describing them as &quot;one of the dumbest bands in the history of music&quot;. At the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards, Limp Bizkit won the Best Rock Video category for their song &quot;Break Stuff&quot;, beating Rage Against the Machine&#x27;s &quot;Sleep Now in the Fire&quot;. When Limp Bizkit accepted their award, Commerford went on stage and climbed up a backdrop, rocking back and forth. After the incident, Commerford was arrested and spent a night in jail. Commerford said in 2015, &quot;I do apologize for Limp Bizkit. I really do. I feel really bad that we inspired such bullshit ... They&#x27;re gone, though. That&#x27;s the beautiful thing.&quot;
Jody MacGregor of FasterLouder called nu metal &quot;music&#x27;s most hated genre&quot;; conversely, he also wrote that nu metal is &quot;not as bad as people think&quot;, praising several examples of the genre. Although multiple nu metal musicians rejected the nu metal label, Limp Bizkit&#x27;s vocalist Fred Durst defended it, saying &quot;Nu metal let people open up and it meant something to people. It really did.&quot; Slipknot&#x27;s vocalist Corey Taylor also defended nu metal, saying &quot;I&#x27;d like to think that that whole nu-metal wave was so important to that next wave of American heavy metal, to be honest.&quot; Coal Chamber&#x27;s vocalist Dez Fafara also defended nu metal. He said he is proud to be associated with the subgenre and that nu metal bands &quot;broke new musical ground&quot; saying, &quot;I think &#x27;hair metal&#x27; was cheesy. [But] I think &#x27;nu metal&#x27; was different. I think what&#x27;s beautiful about &#x27;nu metal&#x27; is it&#x27;s different. And you&#x27;ve got so many different influences.&quot; The Smashing Pumpkins vocalist Billy Corgan praised nu metal, saying &quot;I think it&#x27;s fantastic. I think the more people are cross-pollinating between different musical styles… it not only has musical implications but it has cultural ones as well.&quot; Sevendust vocalist Lajon Witherspoon, when asked about the 2020s resurgence of the genre, also spoke highly: &quot;It&#x27;s funny. I don&#x27;t mind being in that category because I feel it&#x27;s awesome that music is resurging and we&#x27;re not letting a movement get away from us and get so far away that we don&#x27;t even like it or listen to it anymore.&quot;

===Rejection of nu metal label by nu metal musicians===
Some nu metal musicians have rejected the label nu metal and have tried to distance themselves from it. Slipknot prefer to distance themselves from other nu metal groups, describing their music as &quot;metal metal&quot; and equating their link to nu metal as a coincidence of their time of emergence.

Jonathan Davis had originally rejected the nu metal label, saying &quot;We&#x27;re not &#x27;rap rock,&#x27; we&#x27;re not &#x27;nu-metal&#x27; ... We might have invented a new genre of heavy music or rock, but I believe the term &#x27;nu-metal&#x27; was made up for all the bands that followed us. Those guys to me are nu-metal. And we&#x27;re just Korn.&quot; In 2014, Davis spoke about the nu metal label, saying:

Davis has since become more accepting of the term. In a 2019 interview, he remarked, &quot;If we invented nu-metal then fuck yeah, cool. It&#x27;s pretty cool to say we helped invent some kind of movement, that&#x27;s pretty insane.&quot; Expressing positive views of the genre&#x27;s return to popularity in a 2020 interview, he endorsed Wargasm as a personal favourite.

Staind&#x27;s vocalist Aaron Lewis rejected the nu metal label, saying, &quot;If we get called a &#x27;nu metal&#x27; band one more time, I don&#x27;t even know what I&#x27;m going to do!&quot; In 2003, Chino Moreno, vocalist of Deftones, rejected the nu metal label saying &quot;We told motherfuckers not to lump us in with nu metal because when those bands go down we aren&#x27;t going to be with them&quot;. As Deftones abandoned the nu metal sound of their early work, Moreno tried to distance himself from nu metal bands and began to criticize the bands and their albums, including Korn&#x27;s 2002 album &quot;Untouchables&quot;; he said, &quot;As Korn go on, it&#x27;s the same things—bad childhoods and mean moms. It gets too old after a while. How old is Jonathan [Davis]? Thirty? How long has it been since he lived with his parents?&quot; Davis responded saying, &quot;Obviously, Chino hasn&#x27;t listened to the words on the rest of my albums because they&#x27;re nothing about my parents or my childhood.&quot; Moreno also said, &quot;A big problem for me was opening for Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park, two bands that wouldn&#x27;t exist if it weren&#x27;t for me, straight up!&quot;. Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park spoke about the nu metal label in an interview with &quot;NME&quot;, saying &quot;We never held the flag for nu-metal—it was associated with frat rock. Arrogant, misogynistic, and full of testosterone; we were reacting against that.&quot; Wes Borland of Limp Bizkit said that he &quot;never liked or condoned&quot; the term &quot;nu metal&quot; in any way, and said he does not understand &quot;how so many bands that sound nothing alike can be put into&quot; the nu metal genre. Mike Wengren of Disturbed said that he doesn&#x27;t think Disturbed &quot;were ever a nu-metal band to begin with&quot;.

Chester Bennington of Linkin Park initially disliked the band being labeled as nu metal, saying in 2007, &quot;I know that we kind of helped create, I guess, the sound of that genre, but I hate that genre. I&#x27;m not going to speak for everyone, but I can personally tell you that I am not a big fan of almost everybody in that category. There are a few bands that I don&#x27;t really believe belong in there, and we&#x27;re one of those bands.&quot; However, by 2012 Bennington said he accepted the nu metal label:

===Association with heavy metal===
In addition to criticizing nu metal, many heavy metal musicians have rejected nu metal as a legitimate subgenre of heavy metal, saying it is not &quot;true heavy metal&quot;. Some nu metal musicians have tried to distance themselves from being heavy metal at all. For example, Korn&#x27;s Jonathan Davis rejected the &quot;heavy metal&quot; label. When talking with &quot;Vice&quot;, Davis spoke about Korn being called a heavy metal band, saying, &quot;I never thought of us to be metal to begin with. Yeah, we&#x27;re heavy and downtuned, but metal, to me, is like Judas Priest and Iron Maiden. That&#x27;s metal, man. I always thought of us as a funk band. That funky, groovy shit.&quot; Godsmack&#x27;s vocalist Sully Erna also rejected the &quot;heavy metal&quot; label and said he views Godsmack as a hard rock band. Linkin Park&#x27;s vocalist Chester Bennington, though eventually accepting of the nu metal label, had expressed some disagreement with his band being labeled a heavy metal or nu metal group because he felt the term limited the scope of the band&#x27;s actual style, particularly on their later albums.

<text>ncurses (new curses) is a programming library for creating textual user interfaces (TUIs) that work across a wide variety of terminals; it is written in a way that attempts to optimize the commands that are sent to the terminal, so as reduce the latency experienced when updating the displayed content.

ncurses is a free and open-source software emulation of curses from System V Release 4.0 (SVr4).

There are bindings for ncurses in a variety of programming languages, including Ada, Python, Gambas, Ruby, PHP, JavaScript, Perl, Object REXX (ooRexx) and Rust.

==History==
As the new version, ncurses is a free and open-source software emulation of the System V Release 4.0 (SVr4) curses, which was an enhancement over the discontinued 4.4 BSD curses. The XSI Curses standard issued by X/Open is explicitly and closely modeled on UNIX System V.

===curses===

The first curses library was developed at the University of California at Berkeley, for a BSD operating system, around 1980 to support Rogue, a text-based adventure game. It originally used the termcap library, which was used in other programs, such as the vi editor.

The success of the BSD curses library prompted Bell Labs to release an enhanced curses library in their System V Release 2 Unix systems. This library was more powerful and instead of using termcap, it used terminfo. However, due to AT&amp;T&#x27;s policy regarding the distribution of source code, the improved curses library was not widely adopted in the BSD community.

===pcurses===
Around 1982, Pavel Curtis started work on a freeware clone of the Bell Labs curses, named pcurses, which was maintained by various people through 1986.

===ncurses===
The pcurses library was further improved when Zeyd Ben-Halim took over the development effort in late 1991. The new library was released as ncurses in November 1993, with version 1.8.1 as the first major release. Subsequent work, through version 1.8.8 (M1995), was driven by Eric S. Raymond, who added the form and menu libraries written by Juergen Pfeifer. Since 1996, it has been maintained by Thomas E. Dickey.

Most ncurses calls can be easily ported to the old curses. System V curses implementations can support BSD curses programs with just a recompilation. However, a few areas are problematic, such as handling terminal resizing, since no counterpart exists in the old curses.

==Terminal database==
ncurses can use either terminfo (with extensible data) or termcap. Other implementations of curses generally use terminfo; a minority use termcap. Few (mytinfo was an older exception) use both.

==License==
ncurses is a part of the GNU Project, but is not distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) or GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). Instead, it is distributed under a permissive free software licence, i.e., the MIT License. This is due to the agreement made with the Free Software Foundation at the time the developers assigned their copyright.

When the agreement was made to pass on the rights to the FSF, there was a clause that stated:

The Foundation promises that all distribution of the Package, or of any work &quot;based on the Package&quot;, that takes place under the control of the Foundation or its agents or assignees, shall be on terms that explicitly and perpetually permit anyone possessing a copy of the work to which the terms apply, and possessing accurate notice of these terms, to redistribute copies of the work to anyone on the same terms.

According to the maintainer Thomas E. Dickey, this precludes relicensing to the GPL in any version, since it would place restrictions on the programs that will be able to link to the libraries.

==Programs using ncurses==
Hundreds of programs use ncurses. Some, such as GNU Screen and w3m, use only the termcap interface and perform screen management themselves. Others, such as GNU Midnight Commander and Yet another Setup Tool (YaST), use the curses programming interface.

<text>The National Basketball Association (NBA) is a professional basketball league in North America composed of 30 teams (29 in the United States and 1 in Canada). The NBA is one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada and is considered the premier professional basketball league in the world. The league is headquartered in Midtown Manhattan.

The NBA was created on August 3, 1949, with the merger of the Basketball Association of America (BAA) and the National Basketball League (NBL). The league later adopted the BAA&#x27;s history and considers its founding on June 6, 1946, as its own. In 1976, the NBA and the American Basketball Association (ABA) merged, adding four franchises to the NBA. The NBA&#x27;s regular season runs from October to April, with each team playing 82 games. The league&#x27;s playoff tournament extends into June, culminating with the NBA Finals championship series.

The NBA is an active member of USA Basketball (USAB), which is recognized by the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) as the governing body for basketball in the United States. The NBA is the second-wealthiest professional sports league in the world by revenue after the National Football League (NFL). , NBA players are the world&#x27;s highest paid athletes by average annual salary per player.

The Boston Celtics have the most NBA championships with 18 and are the reigning league champions, having defeated the Dallas Mavericks in the 2024 NBA Finals.

==History==

===Creation and BAA–NBL merger (1946–1956)===
The NBA traces its roots to the Basketball Association of America which was founded in 1946 by owners of the major ice hockey arenas in the Northeastern and Midwestern United States and Canada. On November 1, 1946, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the Toronto Huskies hosted the New York Knickerbockers at Maple Leaf Gardens, in a game the NBA now refers to as the first game played in NBA history. The first basket was made by Ossie Schectman of the Knickerbockers.

Although there had been earlier attempts at professional basketball leagues, including the American Basketball League (ABL) and the NBL, the BAA was the first league to attempt to play primarily in large arenas in major cities. During its early years, the quality of play in the BAA was not significantly better than in competing leagues or among leading independent clubs such as the Harlem Globetrotters. For instance, the 1947 ABL finalist Baltimore Bullets moved to the BAA and won that league&#x27;s 1948 title, and the 1948 NBL champion Minneapolis Lakers won the 1949 BAA title.

Prior to the 1948–49 season, the BAA lured away the Fort Wayne Pistons, Indianapolis Kautskys, Minneapolis Lakers, and Rochester Royals from the NBL with the prospect of playing in major venues such as Boston Garden and Madison Square Garden. The NBL hit back by outbidding the BAA for the services of several players, including Al Cervi, rookie Dolph Schayes and five stars from the University of Kentucky while also gaining the upper hand in Indianapolis with the creation of the Indianapolis Olympians while the Kautskys folded. With several teams facing financial difficulties, the BAA and the NBL agreed on a merger on August 3, 1949, to create the National Basketball Association. Maurice Podoloff, the president of BAA, became the president of the NBA while Ike Duffey, president of the NBL, became the chairman. The NBA later adopted the BAA&#x27;s history and statistics as its own but did not do the same for NBL records and statistics.

The new league had seventeen franchises located in a mix of large and small cities, as well as large arenas and smaller gymnasiums and armories. In 1950, the NBA consolidated to eleven franchises, a process that continued until 1954–55, when the league reached its smallest size of eight franchises: the New York Knicks, Boston Celtics, Philadelphia Warriors, Minneapolis Lakers, Rochester Royals, Fort Wayne Pistons, Milwaukee Hawks, and Syracuse Nationals, all of which remain in the league today, although the latter six all did eventually relocate. The process of contraction saw the league&#x27;s smaller-city franchises move to larger cities. The Hawks had shifted from the Tri-Cities to Milwaukee in 1951, and later shifted to St. Louis in 1955. In 1957, the Rochester Royals moved from Rochester, New York, to Cincinnati and the Pistons moved from Fort Wayne, Indiana, to Detroit.

Japanese-American Wataru Misaka is considered to have broken the NBA color barrier in the 1947–48 season when he played for the New York Knicks in the BAA. He remained the only non-white player in league history prior to the first African-American, Harold Hunter, signing with the Washington Capitols in 1950. Hunter was cut from the team during training camp, but several African-American players did play in the league later that year, including Chuck Cooper with the Celtics, Nathaniel &quot;Sweetwater&quot; Clifton with the Knicks, and Earl Lloyd with the Washington Capitols. During this period, the Minneapolis Lakers won five NBA championships and established themselves as the league&#x27;s first dynasty; their squad was led by center George Mikan who was the NBA&#x27;s first superstar. To encourage shooting and discourage stalling, the league introduced the 24-second shot clock in 1954.

===Celtics&#x27; dominance, league expansion and competition (1956–1979)===
In 1957, rookie center Bill Russell joined the Boston Celtics, which already featured guard Bob Cousy and coach Red Auerbach, and went on to lead the franchise to eleven NBA titles in thirteen seasons. Center Wilt Chamberlain entered the league with the Warriors in 1959 and became a dominant individual star of the 1960s, setting new single-game records in scoring (100) and rebounding (55). Russell&#x27;s rivalry with Chamberlain became one of the greatest rivalries in the history of American team sports.
The 1960s were dominated by the Celtics. Led by Russell, Cousy, and Auerbach, Boston won eight straight championships in the NBA from 1959 to 1966. This championship streak is the longest in the history of American professional sports. They did not win the title in 1966–67, but regained it in the 1967–68 season and repeated in 1969. The domination totaled nine of the ten championship banners of the 1960s.

Through this period, the NBA continued to evolve with the shift of the Minneapolis Lakers to Los Angeles, the Philadelphia Warriors to San Francisco, the Syracuse Nationals to Philadelphia to become the Philadelphia 76ers, and the St. Louis Hawks moving to Atlanta, as well as the addition of its first expansion franchises. The Chicago Packers (now Washington Wizards) became the ninth NBA team in 1961. From 1966 to 1968, the league expanded from 9 to 14 teams, introducing the Chicago Bulls, Seattle SuperSonics (now Oklahoma City Thunder), San Diego Rockets (who moved to Houston four years later), Milwaukee Bucks, and Phoenix Suns.

In 1967, the league faced a new external threat with the formation of the American Basketball Association (ABA). The leagues engaged in a bidding war. The NBA landed the most important college star of the era, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (then known as Lew Alcindor), who went on to become the league&#x27;s best player of the 1970s. However, the NBA&#x27;s leading scorer, Rick Barry, jumped to the ABA, as did four veteran referees—Norm Drucker, Earl Strom, John Vanak, and Joe Gushue.

In 1969, Alan Siegel, who oversaw the design of Jerry Dior&#x27;s Major League Baseball logo a year prior, created the modern NBA logo inspired by the MLB&#x27;s. It incorporates the silhouette of Jerry West, based on a photo by Wen Roberts. The NBA would not confirm that a particular player was used because, according to Siegel, &quot;They want to institutionalize it rather than individualize it. It&#x27;s become such a ubiquitous, classic symbol and focal point of their identity and their licensing program that they don&#x27;t necessarily want to identify it with one player.&quot; The logo debuted in 1971 (with a small change to the typeface on the NBA wordmark in 2017) and would remain a fixture of the NBA brand.

The ABA succeeded in signing a number of major stars in the 1970s, including Julius Erving of the Virginia Squires, in part because it allowed teams to sign college undergraduates. The NBA expanded rapidly during this period. From 1966 to 1974, the NBA grew from nine franchises to 18. In 1970, the Portland Trail Blazers, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Buffalo Braves (now the Los Angeles Clippers) all made their debuts expanding the league to 17. The New Orleans Jazz (now in Utah) came aboard in 1974 bringing the total to 18. Following the 1976 season, the leagues reached a settlement that provided for the addition of four ABA franchises to the NBA, raising the number of franchises in the league at that time to 22. The franchises added were the San Antonio Spurs, Denver Nuggets, Indiana Pacers, and New York Nets (now the Brooklyn Nets). Some of the biggest stars of this era were Abdul-Jabbar, Barry, Dave Cowens, Erving, Elvin Hayes, Walt Frazier, Moses Malone, Artis Gilmore, George Gervin, Dan Issel, and Pete Maravich. The end of the decade, however, saw declining TV ratings, low attendance and drug-related player issues – both perceived and real – that threatened to derail the league.

===Surging popularity and Bulls&#x27; dynasty (1979–1998)===

The league added the ABA&#x27;s three-point field goal beginning in 1979. That same year, rookies Larry Bird and Magic Johnson joined the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers respectively, initiating a period of significant growth of fan interest in the NBA. The two had faced each other in the 1979 NCAA Division I Basketball Championship Game, and they later played against each other in three NBA Finals (1984, 1985, and 1987). In the 10 seasons of the 1980s, Johnson led the Lakers to five titles while Bird led the Celtics to three titles. Also in the early 1980s, the NBA added one more expansion franchise, the Dallas Mavericks, bringing the total to 23 teams. Later on, Larry Bird won the first three three-point shooting contests. On February 1, 1984 David Stern became commissioner of the NBA. Stern has been recognized as playing a major role in the growth of the league during his career.
Michael Jordan entered the league in 1984 with the Chicago Bulls, spurring more interest in the league. In 1988 and 1989, four cities got their wishes as the Charlotte Hornets, Miami Heat, Orlando Magic, and Minnesota Timberwolves made their NBA debuts, bringing the total to 27 teams. The Detroit Pistons won back-to-back NBA championships in 1989 and 1990, led by coach Chuck Daly and guard Isiah Thomas. Jordan and Scottie Pippen led the Bulls to two three-peats in eight years during the 1991–1998 seasons. Hakeem Olajuwon won back-to-back titles with the Houston Rockets in 1994 and 1995.

The 1992 Olympic basketball Dream Team, the first to use current NBA stars, featured Michael Jordan as the anchor, along with Bird, Johnson, David Robinson, Patrick Ewing, Scottie Pippen, Clyde Drexler, Karl Malone, John Stockton, Chris Mullin, Charles Barkley, and star NCAA amateur Christian Laettner. The team was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, while 11 of the 12 players (along with three out of four coaches) have been inducted as individuals in their own right.

In 1995, the NBA expanded to Canada with the addition of the Vancouver Grizzlies and the Toronto Raptors. In 1996, the NBA created a women&#x27;s league, the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA).

===Lakers&#x27; and Spurs&#x27; dynasties (1998–2014)===
In 1998, the NBA owners began a lockout that suspended all league business until a new labor agreement could be reached, which led to the season being shortened to 50 games.

After the breakup of the Chicago Bulls championship roster in the summer of 1998, the Western Conference dominated much of the next two decades. The Los Angeles Lakers, coached by Phil Jackson, and the San Antonio Spurs, coached by Gregg Popovich, combined to make 13 Finals in 16 seasons, with 10 titles. &quot;Twin Towers&quot; Tim Duncan and David Robinson won the 1999 championship with the Spurs, becoming the first former ABA team to win the NBA championship. Shaquille O&#x27;Neal and Kobe Bryant started the 2000s with three consecutive championships for the Lakers. The Spurs reclaimed the title in 2003 against the Nets. In 2004, the Lakers returned to the Finals, only to lose in five games to the Detroit Pistons.

The league&#x27;s image was marred by a violent incident between players and fans in a November 2004 game between the Indiana Pacers and Detroit Pistons. In response, players were suspended for a total of 146 games with $11 million total lost in salary, and the league tightened security and limited the sale of alcohol.

On May 19, 2005, Commissioner Stern testified before the U.S. House of Representatives&#x27; Committee on Government Reform about the NBA&#x27;s actions to combat the use of steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs. The NBA started its drug-testing program in 1983 and substantially improved it in 1999. In the 1999–2000 season, all players were randomly tested during training camp, and all rookies were additionally tested three more times during the regular season. Of the nearly 4,200 tests for steroids and performance-enhancing drugs conducted over six seasons, only three players were confirmed positive for NBA&#x27;s drug program, all were immediately suspended, and as of the time of the testimony, none were playing in the NBA.

After the Spurs won the championship again in 2005, the 2006 Finals featured two franchises making their inaugural Finals appearances. The Miami Heat, led by their star shooting guard, Dwyane Wade, and Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, who had been traded from the Lakers during the summer of 2004, won the series over the Dallas Mavericks. The Lakers/Spurs dominance continued in 2007 with a four-game sweep by the Spurs over the LeBron James-led Cleveland Cavaliers. The 2008 Finals saw a rematch of the league&#x27;s highest profile rivalry, the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers, with the Celtics winning their 17th championship. The Lakers won back-to-back championships in 2009 and 2010, against the Orlando Magic and the Celtics. The 2010 NBA All-Star Game was held at Cowboys Stadium in front of the largest crowd ever, 108,713.

A referee lockout began on September 1, 2009, when the contract between the NBA and its referees expired. The first preseason games were played on October 1, 2009, and replacement referees from the WNBA and NBA Development League were used, the first time replacement referees had been used since the beginning of the 1995–96 season. The NBA and the regular referees reached a deal on October 23, 2009.

At the start of the 2010–11 season, free agents LeBron James and Chris Bosh signed with the Miami Heat, joining Dwyane Wade to form the &quot;Big Three&quot;. The Heat dominated the league, reaching the Finals for four straight years. In 2011, they faced a re-match with the Dallas Mavericks but lost to the Dirk Nowitzki-led team. They won back-to-back titles in 2012 and 2013 against the Oklahoma City Thunder and the Spurs, and lost in a re-match with the Spurs in the 2014 Finals.

The 2011–12 season began with another lockout, the league&#x27;s fourth. After the first few weeks of the season were canceled, the players and owners ratified a new collective bargaining agreement on December 8, 2011, setting up a shortened 66-game season. On February 1, 2014, commissioner David Stern retired after 30 years in the position, and was succeeded by his deputy, Adam Silver.

===Warriors&#x27; dynasty (2014–present)===
After four seasons with the Miami Heat, LeBron James returned to the Cleveland Cavaliers for the 2014–15 season. He led the team to their second Finals appearance with the help of Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love. The Golden State Warriors defeated the Cavaliers in six games, led by the &quot;Splash Brothers&quot; Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson. The Cavaliers and the Warriors faced each other in the Finals a record four consecutive times. In the 2015–16 season, the Warriors finished the season 73–9, the best season record in NBA history. However, the Cavaliers overcame a 3–1 deficit in the Finals to win their first championship that season, and end a 52-year professional sports championship drought for the city of Cleveland. In the 2016–17 season, the Warriors recruited free agent Kevin Durant and went on to win the 2017 and 2018 Finals against the Cavaliers.

After the departure of James in free agency in 2018, the Cavaliers&#x27; streak of playoff and Finals appearances ended. The Warriors returned for a fifth consecutive Finals appearance in 2019 but lost to the Toronto Raptors, who won their first championship after acquiring Kawhi Leonard in a trade.

The 2019–20 season was suspended indefinitely on March 11, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, after Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert tested positive for the coronavirus. On June 4, 2020, the NBA Board of Governors voted to resume the season in a 22-team format with 8 seeding games per team and a regular playoffs format, with all games played in a &quot;bubble&quot; in Walt Disney World without any fans present.

This era also saw the continuous near year-over-year decline in NBA viewership. Between 2012 and 2019, the league lost 40 to 45 percent of its viewership. While some of it can be attributed to &quot;cable-cutting&quot;, other professional leagues, like the NFL and MLB have retained stable viewership demographics. The opening game of the 2020 Finals between the Los Angeles Lakers and Miami Heat brought in only 7.41 million viewers to ABC, according to The Hollywood Reporter. That is reportedly the lowest viewership seen for the Finals since at least 1994, when total viewers began to be regularly recorded and is a 45 percent decline from game one between the Golden State Warriors and Toronto Raptors, which had 13.51 million viewers a year earlier. Some attribute this decline to the political stances the league and its players are taking, while others consider load management, the uneven talent distribution between the conferences and the cord-cutting of younger viewers as the main reason for the decline.

During the 2020–21 and 2021–22 seasons, the Milwaukee Bucks would defeat the Phoenix Suns in the 2021 NBA Finals, securing their second NBA championship since 1971, and the Golden State Warriors made their sixth appearance in the finals defeating the Boston Celtics in the 2022 NBA Finals, their fourth championship in eight years.

The 2022–23 season saw the Denver Nuggets, led by center Nikola Jokić, make the franchise&#x27;s first NBA Finals appearance and defeat the Miami Heat in five games to win their first NBA championship.

The 2023–24 NBA season saw the star-studded Boston Celtics, winning a championship over the Dallas Mavericks, after five conference finals appearances, and a finals appearance marking their 18th championship, their first since 2008.

===International influence===

Following pioneers like Vlade Divac (Serbia) and Dražen Petrović (Croatia), who joined the NBA in the late 1980s, an increasing number of international players have moved directly from playing elsewhere in the world to starring in the NBA. Since 2006, the NBA has faced EuroLeague teams in exhibition matches in the NBA Europe Live Tour, and since 2009, in the EuroLeague American Tour. On November 9, 2007, when the Houston Rockets with Yao Ming faced off against the Milwaukee Bucks with Yi Jianlian, over 200 million people in China watched on 19 different networks, making it the most-viewed game in NBA history.

The 2013–14 season opened with a record 92 international players on the opening night rosters, representing 39 countries and comprising over 20 percent of the league. The NBA defines &quot;international&quot; players as those born outside the 50 United States and Washington, D.C. This means that:
* Players born in U.S. territories such as Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, most notably USVI native Tim Duncan, are counted as &quot;international&quot; even though they are U.S. citizens by birth, and may even have represented the U.S. in international competition (like Duncan).
* U.S.-born players are not counted as &quot;international&quot; even if they were born with citizenship in another country and represent that country internationally, such as Joakim Noah, and Kosta Koufos.

The beginning of the 2017–18 season saw a record 108 international players representing 42 countries marking 4 consecutive years of at least 100 international players and each team having at least one international player. In 2018, the Phoenix Suns hired Serbian coach Igor Kokoškov as their new head coach, replacing Canadian interim coach Jay Triano, making Kokoškov the first European coach to become a head coach for a team in the NBA.

In the 2023–24 season, the Mavericks and the Thunder each had eight international players on their roster. For six consecutive seasons from 2018–19 to 2023–24, the league&#x27;s MVP award has been given to an international player.

===Other developments===

In 2001, an affiliated minor league, the National Basketball Development League, now called the NBA G League, was created.

Two years after the Hornets&#x27; move to New Orleans, the NBA returned to North Carolina, as the Charlotte Bobcats were formed as an expansion team in 2004.

The Hornets temporarily moved to Oklahoma City in 2005 for two seasons because of damage caused by Hurricane Katrina. The team returned to New Orleans in 2007.

A new official game ball was introduced on June 28, 2006, for the 2006–07 season, marking the first change to the ball in over 35 years and only the second ball in 60 seasons. Manufactured by Spalding, the new ball featured a new design and new synthetic material that Spalding claimed offered a better grip, feel, and consistency than the original ball. However, many players were vocal in their disdain for the new ball, saying that it was too sticky when dry, and too slippery when wet.

Commissioner Stern announced on December 11, 2006, that beginning January 1, 2007, the NBA would return to the traditional leather basketball in use prior to the 2006–07 season. The change was influenced by frequent player complaints and confirmed hand injuries (cuts) caused by the microfiber ball. The Players&#x27; Association had filed a suit on behalf of the players against the NBA over the new ball. , the NBA team jerseys are manufactured by Nike, replacing the previous supplier, Adidas. All teams will wear jerseys with the Nike logo except the Charlotte Hornets, whose jerseys will instead have the Jumpman logo associated with longtime Nike endorser Michael Jordan, who owns the Hornets.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) began an investigation on July 19, 2007, over allegations that veteran NBA referee Tim Donaghy bet on basketball games he officiated over the past two seasons and that he made calls affecting the point spread in those games. On August 15, 2007, Donaghy pleaded guilty to two federal charges related to the investigation. Donaghy claimed in 2008 that certain referees were friendly with players and &quot;company men&quot; for the NBA, and he alleged that referees influenced the outcome of certain playoff and finals games in 2002 and 2005. NBA commissioner David Stern denied the allegations and said Donaghy was a convicted felon and a &quot;singing, cooperating witness&quot;. Donaghy served 15 months in prison and was released in November 2009. According to an independent study by Ronald Beech of Game 6 of the 2002 Western Conference Finals between the Los Angeles Lakers and Sacramento Kings, although the refs increased the Lakers&#x27; chances of winning through foul calls during the game, there was no collusion to fix the game. On alleged &quot;star treatment&quot; during Game 6 by the referees toward certain players, Beech claimed, &quot;there does seem to be issues with different standards and allowances for different players.&quot;

The NBA Board of Governors approved the request of the Seattle SuperSonics to move to Oklahoma City on April 18, 2008. The team, however, could not move until it had settled a lawsuit filed by the city of Seattle, which was intended to keep the SuperSonics in Seattle for the remaining two seasons of the team&#x27;s lease at KeyArena. Following a court case, the city of Seattle settled with the ownership group of the SuperSonics on July 2, 2008, allowing the team to move to Oklahoma City immediately in exchange for terminating the final two seasons of the team&#x27;s lease at KeyArena. The Oklahoma City Thunder began playing in the 2008–09 season.

The first outdoor game in the modern era of the league was played at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden on October 11, 2008, between the Phoenix Suns and the Denver Nuggets.

The first official NBA league games on European ground took place in 2011. In two matchups, the New Jersey Nets faced the Toronto Raptors at the O2 Arena in London in front of over 20,000 fans.

After the 2012–13 season, the New Orleans Hornets were renamed the Pelicans. During the 2013–14 season, Stern retired as commissioner after 30 years, and deputy commissioner Adam Silver ascended to the position of commissioner. During that season&#x27;s playoffs, the Bobcats officially reclaimed the Hornets name, and by agreement with the league and the Pelicans, also received sole ownership of all history, records, and statistics from the Pelicans&#x27; time in Charlotte. As a result, the Hornets are now officially considered to have been founded in 1988, suspended operations in 2002, and resumed in 2004 as the Bobcats, while the Pelicans are officially treated as a 2002 expansion team. (This is somewhat similar to the relationship between the Cleveland Browns and Baltimore Ravens in the NFL.)

Donald Sterling, who was then-owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, received a lifetime ban from the NBA on April 29, 2014, after racist remarks he made became public. Sterling was also fined US$2.5 million, the maximum allowed under the NBA Constitution.

Becky Hammon was hired by the San Antonio Spurs on August 5, 2014, as an assistant coach, becoming the second female coach in NBA history but the first full-time coach. This also makes her the first full-time female coach in any of the four major professional sports in North America.

The NBA announced on April 15, 2016, that it would allow all 30 of its teams to sell corporate sponsor advertisement patches on official game uniforms, beginning with the 2017–18 season. The sponsorship advertisement patches would appear on the left front of jerseys, opposite Nike&#x27;s logo, marking the first time a manufacturer&#x27;s logo would appear on NBA jerseys, and would measure approximately 2.5 by 2.5 inches. The NBA would become the first major North American professional sports league to allow corporate sponsorship logos on official team uniforms, and the last to have a uniform manufacturer logo appear on its team uniforms. The first team to announce a jersey sponsorship was the Philadelphia 76ers, who agreed to a deal with StubHub.

On July 6, 2017, the NBA unveiled an updated rendition of its logo; it was largely identical to the previous design, except with revised typography and a &quot;richer&quot; color scheme. The league began to phase in the updated logo across its properties during the 2017 NBA Summer League.

The NBA also officially released new Nike uniforms for all 30 teams beginning with the 2017–18 season. The league eliminated &quot;home&quot; and &quot;away&quot; uniform designations. Instead, each team would have four or six uniforms: the &quot;Association&quot; edition, which is the team&#x27;s white uniform, the &quot;Icon&quot; edition, which is the team&#x27;s color uniform, and the &quot;Statement&quot; and &quot;City&quot; uniforms, which most teams use as an alternate uniform. In 2018, the NBA also released the &quot;Earned&quot; uniform.

In 2018, Adam Silver showed support in the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision to overturn a federal ban on sports betting. Silver thought it would bring greater transparency and integrity as well as business opportunities. Before naming DraftKings and FanDuel co-official sports betting partners of the NBA in 2021, the NBA first named MGM as the exclusive official gaming partner of the NBA and WNBA—the first major American sports league to do so. With a deal between the 76ers and then-sportsbook FOX Bet as the first agreement between an NBA team and a sportsbook app, more teams partnered with operators thereafter. This early acceptance of sports betting translated to basketball being the most bet-on sport in the United States over football in 2023.

As a part of its November 2021 multi-year partnership deal with the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the NBA hosted two preseason games in Abu Dhabi on October 4 and 6, 2024, marking its third annual trip to the country. However, the Human Rights Watch (HRW) raised concerns, citing the UAE&#x27;s pattern of using high-profile events to enhance its image. HRW accused the league of being complicit in &quot;sportswashing&quot; the UAE&#x27;s poor human rights record, while the country seeks to display itself as open country, without addressing the abuses. On September 30, HRW wrote a letter to the NBA, urging it to implement a human rights risk mitigation strategy, and to ensure that the preseason games were not used as a distraction from the UAE&#x27;s human rights abuses. The rights organization also pointed out that the UAE hosted the games amidst the reports of the country being directly involved in fuelling the Sudanese civil war. A coalition of human rights groups called upon the NBA to cancel the games in Abu Dhabi in solidarity with Sudanese.

==Teams==


The NBA originated in 1946 with 11 teams, and through a sequence of team expansions, reductions and relocations consists of 30 teams – 29 in the United States and 1 in Canada.

The current league organization divides 30 teams into two 15-team conferences of three divisions with five teams each. The current divisional alignment was introduced in the 2004–05 season. Reflecting the population distribution of the United States and Canada as a whole, most teams are in the eastern half of the country: 13 teams are in the Eastern Time Zone, nine in the Central, three in the Mountain, and five in the Pacific.

Notes:
*An asterisk (*) denotes a franchise move. See the respective team articles for more information.
*The Fort Wayne Pistons, Minneapolis Lakers and Rochester Royals all joined the NBA (BAA) in 1948 from the NBL.
*The Syracuse Nationals and Tri-Cities Blackhawks joined the NBA in 1949 as part of the BAA-NBL merger.
*The Indiana Pacers, New York Nets, San Antonio Spurs, and Denver Nuggets all joined the NBA in 1976 as part of the ABA–NBA merger.
*The Charlotte Hornets are regarded as a continuation of the original Charlotte franchise, which suspended operations in 2002 and rejoined the league in 2004. They were known as the Bobcats from 2004 to 2014. The New Orleans Pelicans are regarded as being established as an expansion team in 2002, originally known as the New Orleans Hornets until 2013.

==Regular season==

Following the summer break, teams begin training camps in late September. Training camps allow the coaching staff to evaluate players (especially rookies), scout the team&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses, prepare the players for the rigorous regular season and determine the 12-man active roster (and a 3-man inactive list) with which they will begin the regular season. Teams have the ability to assign players with less than two years of experience to the NBA G League. After training camp, a series of preseason exhibition games are held. Preseason matches are sometimes held in non-NBA cities, both in the United States and overseas. The NBA regular season begins in mid-October.

During the regular season, each team plays 82 games, 41 each home and away. A team faces opponents in its own division four times a year (16 games). Each team plays six of the teams from the other two divisions in its conference four times (24 games), and the remaining four teams three times (12 games). Finally, each team plays all the teams in the other conference twice apiece (30 games). This asymmetrical structure means the strength of schedule will vary between teams (but not as significantly as the NFL or MLB). Over five seasons, each team will have played 80 games against their division (20 games against each opponent, 10 at home, 10 on the road), 180 games against the rest of their conference (18 games against each opponent, 9 at home, 9 on the road), and 150 games against the other conference (10 games against each team, 5 at home, 5 on the road).

Starting with the 2023–24 season, the regular season includes an in-season tournament, in which all games in the tournament (except for the final) count towards the regular season.

The NBA is also the only league that regularly schedules games on Christmas Day. The league has been playing games regularly on the holiday since 1947, though the first Christmas Day games were not televised until . Games played on this day have featured some of the best teams and players. Christmas is also notable for NBA on television, as the holiday is when the first NBA games air on network television each season. Games played on this day have been some of the highest-rated games during a particular season.

The NBA has also played games on MLK Day every year since the holiday was first observed in 1986.

In February, the regular season pauses to celebrate the annual NBA All-Star Game. Fans vote throughout the United States, Canada, and on the Internet, and the top vote-getters in each conference are named captains. Fan votes determine the rest of the All-Star starters. Coaches vote to choose the remaining 14 All-Stars. The player with the best performance during the game is rewarded with a Game MVP award. Other attractions of the All-Star break include the Rising Stars Challenge (originally Rookie Challenge), where the top rookies and second-year players in the NBA play in a 5-on-5 basketball game, with the current format pitting U.S. players against those from the rest of the world; the Skills Challenge, where players compete to finish an obstacle course consisting of shooting, passing, and dribbling in the fastest time; the Three Point Contest, where players compete to score the highest number of three-point field goals in a given time; and the NBA Slam Dunk Contest, where players compete to dunk the ball in the most entertaining way according to the judges. These other attractions have varying names which include the names of the various sponsors who have paid for naming rights.

Shortly after the All-Star break is the trade deadline, which is set to fall on the 16th Thursday of the season (usually in February) at 3 pm Eastern Time. After this date, teams are not allowed to exchange players with each other for the remainder of the season, although they may still sign and release players. Major trades are often completed right before the trading deadline, making that day a hectic time for general managers.

Around the middle of April, the regular season ends. It is during this time that voting begins for individual awards, as well as the selection of the honorary, league-wide, postseason teams. The Sixth Man of the Year Award is given to the best player coming off the bench (must have more games coming off the bench than actual games started). The Rookie of the Year Award is awarded to the most outstanding first-year player. The Most Improved Player Award is awarded to the player who is deemed to have shown the most improvement from the previous season. The Defensive Player of the Year Award is awarded to the league&#x27;s best defender. The Coach of the Year Award is awarded to the coach that has made the most positive difference to a team. The Most Valuable Player Award is given to the player deemed the most valuable for (his team) that season. Additionally, &quot;Sporting News&quot; awards an unofficial (but widely recognized) Executive of the Year Award to the general manager who is adjudged to have performed the best job for the benefit of his franchise.

The postseason teams are the All-NBA Team, the All-Defensive Team, and the All-Rookie Team; each consists of five players. There are three All-NBA teams, consisting of the top players at each position, with first-team status being the most desirable. There are two All-Defensive teams, consisting of the top defenders at each position. There are also two All-Rookie teams, consisting of the top first-year players regardless of position.

==Playoffs==
The NBA playoffs begin in April after the conclusion of the regular season and play-in tournament with the top eight teams in each conference, regardless of divisional alignment, competing for the league&#x27;s championship title, the Larry O&#x27;Brien Championship Trophy. Seeds are awarded in strict order of regular season record (with a tiebreaker system used as needed).

Having a higher seed offers several advantages. Since the first seed begins the playoffs playing against the eighth seed, the second seed plays the seventh seed, the third seed plays the sixth seed, and the fourth seed plays the fifth seed, having a higher seed typically means a team faces a weaker opponent in the first round. The team in each series with the better record has home-court advantage, including the First Round.

The league began using its current format, with the top eight teams in each conference advancing regardless of divisional alignment, in the 2015–16 season. Previously, the top three seeds went to the division winners.

The playoffs follow a tournament format. Each team plays an opponent in a best-of-seven series, with the first team to win four games advancing into the next round, while the other team is eliminated from the playoffs. In the next round, the successful team plays against another advancing team of the same conference. All but one team in each conference are eliminated from the playoffs. Since the NBA does not re-seed teams, the playoff bracket in each conference uses a traditional design, with the winner of the series matching the first- and eighth-seeded teams playing the winner of the series matching the fourth- and fifth-seeded teams, and the winner of the series matching the second- and seventh-seeded teams playing the winner of the series matching the third- and sixth-seeded teams. In every round, the best-of-7 series follows a 2–2–1–1–1 home-court pattern, meaning that one team will have home court in games 1, 2, 5, and 7, while the other plays at home in games 3, 4, and 6. From 1985 to 2013, the NBA Finals followed a 2–3–2 pattern, meaning that one team had home court in games 1, 2, 6, and 7, while the other played at home in games 3, 4, and 5.

The final playoff round, a best-of-seven series between the victors of both conferences, is known as the NBA Finals and is held annually in June (sometimes, the series will start in late May). The winner of the NBA Finals receives the Larry O&#x27;Brien Championship Trophy. Each player and major contributor—including coaches and the general manager—on the winning team receive a championship ring. In addition, the league awards the Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award to the best performing player of the series.

==Championships==

The Boston Celtics have the most championships, with 18 NBA Finals wins. The Los Angeles Lakers have the second-most with 17; the Golden State Warriors and Chicago Bulls have the third- and fourth-most, respectively, with seven and six titles.
Current teams that have no NBA Finals appearances:
* Charlotte Hornets 
* Los Angeles Clippers 
* Memphis Grizzlies 
* Minnesota Timberwolves
* New Orleans Pelicans 

==Media coverage==

As one of the major sports leagues in North America, the NBA has a long history of partnerships with television networks in the United States. The NBA signed a contract with DuMont Television Network in its eighth season, the 1953–54 season, marking the first year the NBA had a national television broadcaster. Similar to the National Football League, the lack of television stations led to NBC taking over the rights from the 1954–55 season until April 1962–NBC&#x27;s first tenure with the NBA. in the United States, the NBA has a contract with ESPN (and ABC) and TNT through the 2024–25 season. Games that are not broadcast nationally are usually aired over regional sports networks specific to the area where the teams are located.

==International competitions==

The National Basketball Association has sporadically participated in international club competitions. The first international competition involving the NBA was a 1978 exhibition game in Tel Aviv, Israel between the Washington Bullets and Israeli club Maccabi Tel Aviv. From 1987 to 1999 an NBA team played against championship club teams from Asia, Europe and South America in the McDonald&#x27;s Championship. This tournament was won by the NBA invitee every year it was held.

==Ticket prices and viewership demographics==
In 2022, an average ticket cost $77.75. Depending on the market and stage of the season—preseason, regular season, postseason—a ticket can range from $10 to $100,000.

In 2020, ticket prices for the NBA All Star Game became more expensive than ever before, averaging around $2,600, and even more on the secondary market.

===Viewership demographics===
According to Nielsen&#x27;s survey, in 2013 the NBA had the youngest audience, with 45 percent of its viewers under 35. , the league remains the least likely to be watched by women, who make up only 30% of the viewership. , 45 percent of its viewers were black, while 40 percent of viewers were white, making it the only top North American sport that does not have a white majority audience.

, the NBA&#x27;s popularity further declined among white Americans, who during the 2016–17 season, made up only 34% of the viewership. At the same time, the black viewership increased to 47 percent, while Hispanic (of any race) stood at 11% and Asian viewership stood at 8%. According to the same poll, the NBA was favored more strongly by Democrats than Republicans.

Outside the U.S., the NBA&#x27;s biggest international market is in China, where an estimated 800 million viewers watched the 2017–18 season. NBA China is worth approximately $4 billion.

====International influence====

Following pioneers like Vlade Divac (Serbia) and Dražen Petrović (Croatia), who joined the NBA in the late 1980s, an increasing number of international players have moved directly from playing elsewhere in the world to starring in the NBA. Below is a list of foreign players who have won NBA awards or have otherwise been recognized for their contributions to basketball, either currently or formerly active in the league:

<doc id="22094" wikidata="Q20180599" url="?curid=22094" title="Nutation">
<text>Nutation () is a rocking, swaying, or nodding motion in the axis of rotation of a largely axially symmetric object, such as a gyroscope, planet, or bullet in flight, or as an intended behaviour of a mechanism. In an appropriate reference frame it can be defined as a change in the second Euler angle. If it is not caused by forces external to the body, it is called free nutation or Euler nutation (after Leonhard Euler). A pure nutation is a movement of a rotational axis such that the first Euler angle is constant. Therefore it can be seen that the circular red arrow in the diagram indicates the combined effects of precession and nutation, while nutation in the absence of precession would only change the tilt from vertical (second Euler angle). However, in spacecraft dynamics, precession (a change in the first Euler angle) is sometimes referred to as nutation.

==In a rigid body==

If a top is set at a tilt on a horizontal surface and spun rapidly, its rotational axis starts precessing about the vertical. After a short interval, the top settles into a motion in which each point on its rotation axis follows a circular path. The vertical force of gravity produces a horizontal torque about the point of contact with the surface; the top rotates in the direction of this torque with an angular velocity such that at any moment
:formula_1 (vector cross product)

where is the instantaneous angular momentum of the top.

Initially, however, there is no precession, and the upper part of the top falls sideways and downward, thereby tilting. This gives rise to an imbalance in torques that starts the precession. In falling, the top overshoots the amount of tilt at which it would precess steadily and then oscillates about this level. This oscillation is called &quot;nutation&quot;. If the motion is damped, the oscillations will die down until the motion is a steady precession.

The physics of nutation in tops and gyroscopes can be explored using the model of a &quot;heavy symmetrical top&quot; with its tip fixed. (A symmetrical top is one with rotational symmetry, or more generally one in which two of the three principal moments of inertia are equal.) Initially, the effect of friction is ignored. The motion of the top can be described by three Euler angles: the tilt angle between the symmetry axis of the top and the vertical (second Euler angle); the azimuth of the top about the vertical (first Euler angle); and the rotation angle of the top about its own axis (third Euler angle). Thus, precession is the change in and nutation is the change in .

If the top has mass and its center of mass is at a distance from the pivot point, its gravitational potential relative to the plane of the support is
:formula_2

In a coordinate system where the axis is the axis of symmetry, the top has angular velocities and moments of inertia about the , and axes. Since we are taking a symmetric top, we have =. The kinetic energy is

:formula_3

In terms of the Euler angles, this is
:formula_4

If the Euler–Lagrange equations are solved for this system, it is found that the motion depends on two constants and (each related to a constant of motion). The rate of precession is related to the tilt by
:formula_5

The tilt is determined by a differential equation for of the form
:formula_6

where is a cubic polynomial that depends on parameters and as well as constants that are related to the energy and the gravitational torque. The roots of are cosines of the angles at which the rate of change of is zero. One of these is not related to a physical angle; the other two determine the upper and lower bounds on the tilt angle, between which the gyroscope oscillates.

==Astronomy==
The nutation of a planet occurs because the gravitational effects of other bodies cause the speed of its axial precession to vary over time, so that the speed is not constant. English astronomer James Bradley discovered the nutation of Earth&#x27;s axis in 1728.

===Earth===


Nutation subtly changes the axial tilt of Earth with respect to the ecliptic plane, shifting the major circles of latitude that are defined by the Earth&#x27;s tilt (the tropical circles and the polar circles).

In the case of Earth, the principal sources of tidal force are the Sun and Moon, which continuously change location relative to each other and thus cause nutation in Earth&#x27;s axis. The largest component of Earth&#x27;s nutation has a period of 18.6 years, the same as that of the precession of the Moon&#x27;s orbital nodes. However, there are other significant periodic terms that must be accounted for depending upon the desired accuracy of the result. A mathematical description (set of equations) that represents nutation is called a &quot;theory of nutation&quot;. In the theory, parameters are adjusted in a more or less &quot;ad hoc&quot; method to obtain the best fit to data. Simple rigid body dynamics do not give the best theory; one has to account for deformations of the Earth, including mantle inelasticity and changes in the core–mantle boundary.

The principal term of nutation is due to the regression of the Moon&#x27;s nodal line and has the same period of 6798 days (18.61 years). It reaches plus or minus 17″ in longitude and 9.2″ in obliquity. All other terms are much smaller; the next-largest, with a period of 183 days (0.5 year), has amplitudes 1.3″ and 0.6″ respectively. The periods of all terms larger than 0.0001″ (about as accurately as available technology can measure) lie between 5.5 and 6798 days; for some reason (as with ocean tidal periods) they seem to avoid the range from 34.8 to 91 days, so it is customary to split the nutation into long-period and short-period terms. The long-period terms are calculated and mentioned in the almanacs, while the additional correction due to the short-period terms is usually taken from a table. They can also be calculated from the Julian day according to IAU 2000B methodology.

==In popular culture==

In the 1961 disaster film &quot;The Day the Earth Caught Fire&quot;, the near-simultaneous detonation of two super-hydrogen bombs near the poles causes a change in Earth&#x27;s nutation, as well as an 11° shift in the axial tilt and a change in Earth&#x27;s orbit around the Sun.

In &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, rapidly &#x27;cycling&#x27; or &#x27;changing&#x27; the &#x27;shield nutation&#x27; is frequently mentioned as a means by which to delay the antagonist in their efforts to break through the defences and pillage the Enterprise or other spacecraft.

<text>The North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization (NASCO) is an international organization established by the Convention for the Conservation of Salmon in the North Atlantic Ocean on October 1, 1983,

As a specialised regional fishery management organisation, NASCO&#x27;s mission is to contribute through consultation and cooperation to the conservation, restoration, enhancement and rational management of salmon stocks with a 10-Year Plan to slow the decline of wild North Atlantic salmon.

NASCO is headquartered in Edinburgh, United Kingdom, and was formed in response to the failure of independent states to effectively protect a global common such as the salmon population. It was recognized that international cooperation was essential to prevent unsustainable overfishing. NASCO has since established various regulations and guidelines to manage salmon fisheries, including restricting fishing to within 12 nautical miles of the coast with exceptions in Greenland and the Faroe Islands. Additionally, NASCO has recognized the increasing number of countries implementing catch-and-release practices and has brought light to the proper way to manage and catch-and-release scenario in order to reduce fishing mortality. NASO highlights the importance of keeping the fish in the water prior to release to avoid air exposure. There has been valuable evidence supporting increasing survival rates by following these guidelines.

In 2020, the NASCO operates with a budget of 636 630 GBP, with a little over 583 000 GBP coming from the member states.

==Membership==

Current participants (since 1984):
* 
* 
* 
* 

Denmark (in respect of the Faroe Islands and Greenland)

After withdrawing from NASCO in 2009, Iceland rejoined the fight to restore North Atlantic salmon in March 2023.

Former participants: 
*(1984–1995)
*(1984–1995)

France (in respect of St. Pierre &amp; Miquelon) attends NASCO&#x27;s meetings as an observer.

The NASCO also has 34 NGOs from different member states that have observational status during the annual meetings.

== Structure ==
Council: the governing body of NASCO 
* North American Commission (NAC): make recommendations for scientific research and promote cooperation among members on the issues of minimzing catches and regulatory measures. 
* North-East Atlantic Commission (NEAC): promotes cooperation among members on the issues of conservation, restoration, and management of salmon stocks
* West Greenland Commission (WGC): promotes cooperation among members on the issues of conservation, restoration, enhancement, and management of salmon stocks 
International Atlantic Salmon Research Board: make scientific research recommendations to the Council and Commissions

Finance and Administration Committee (FAC): deals with the administrative and financial matters of the organization. One member from each Party participates.

Secretariat: headed by the Secretary, assist NASCO members on implementation

The primary tasks of the council include:

* Providing a forum for the study, analysis and exchange of information on salmon.
* Coordinating the activities of the Commissions.
* Establishing working arrangements with other fisheries and scientific organizations.
* Making recommendations for scientific research.

== The Atlantic Salmon ==
Atlantic Salmon (&quot;Salmo salar)&quot;, often referred to as &quot;King of Fish&quot; are anadromous fish. This means they spend a portion of their life cycle in both the fresh and salt water. Adult salmon lay their eggs in freshwater rivers, after the eggs hatch they mature for 1–3 years before migrating to the ocean.
=== Threats to North Atlantic Salmon ===
North Atlantic salmon face many threats that have contributed to the significant population decline over the years and have garnered the need for restoration. Overfishing has historically affected numerous species across the globe, stemming from increasing pressure of both commercial and recreational fishing. Climate change has affected aquatic ecosystems due to an increase in ocean temperatures, ocean acidification, and ocean deoxygenation which has caused alterations in salmon migration patterns. Additionally, aquaculture has resulted from farmed salmon, posing a serious risk to wild salmon. Farmed salmon are producing toxic particles leading to the transmission of diseases and interbreeding.

=== Wild Salmon vs. Farmed ===

As the international demand for salmon increase, salmon farming is growing rapidly in order to try and meet the needs of consumers. Salmon farming involves raising salmon in a wide net close to shore for the span of its life cycle. The average lifespan of salmon is typically three years. The salmon first begin in freshwater and are later transported to saltwater until they have matured enough to be sold. A study showed that 70% Atlantic salmon were produced through fish farming. Farmed salmon present a higher level of risk to contain toxins due to their controlled feed containing toxic particles. Some may argue that salmon farming is an eco-friendly form of protein production, however, the excess food waste produced from these farms disturbs aquatic life and can alter the biodiversity.

== The Future of NASCO- A Ten-Year Plan ==
NASCO&#x27;s Council has adopted a Ten-Year Plan to address the threat to Atlantic salmon and to restore what was once a healthy, thriving population.

NASCO&#x27;s has set a goal to focus on and promote efforts aimed at protecting, conserving, and restoring wild Atlantic salmon across the species&#x27; range. In order to achieve this ten-year goal, they have outlined the following five objectives:

* Ensure the best evidence-based information is compiled and accessible to address the critical challenges and threats to wild Atlantic salmon at the North Atlantic scale
* Use the information gathered through Objective 1 to ensure that guidance reflecting best management practice is produced and readily available to those seeking to take action to protect wild Atlantic salmon
* Actively promote sustainable conservation and management practices by sharing best practice and holding Parties and jurisdictions accountable in implementing NASCO recommendations and guidance.
* Raise awareness and foster broad collaborative efforts with other international organizations and civil society to encourage decision-makers, the public, private sector and the scientific community to work towards solutions that overcome the challenges wild Atlantic salmon face.
* Improve its organizational practices and work in an efficient, effective, inclusive, and transparent manner.

=== An Agenda for Action ===
A panel of four (4) distinguished men produced a Call-To-Action plan based on their expertise in NASCO affairs. The agenda contains the following guiding principals:

* Establish a Working Party to consider various ways of strengthening NASCO, including adding new language to the treaty to broaden its legal authority
* Develop a common strategy with other North Atlantic fisheries organizations for minimizing pelagic by-catch
* Strengthen the role of NASCO in habitat conservation and restoration
* Make a stronger push for the establishment of river-by-river Conservation Limits in all salmon rivers
* Require strict enforcement of Conservation Limits in mixed stock fisheries
* Launch an initiative on endangered populations
* Initiate negotiations towards an international regime on aquaculture management to protect wild salmon
* Create new methodology for estimating unreported and illegal catch
* Develop a plan with NGOs for partnership in regard to prioritizations of research and funding for research on marine survival
* Adopt a new strategy for public awareness, openness, and NGO participation
* Publish an annual official NASCO report on the status of Atlantic salmon stocks

== Criticism of NASCO ==
The ratification of NASCO has made excellent strides in the restoration of wild Atlantic salmon but has faced criticism for its lack of governmental support from member states when the agreements of NASCO interfere with the country&#x27;s interests.

<text>In Greek mythology, Narcissus (; ) was a hunter from Thespiae in Boeotia (alternatively Mimas or modern-day Karaburun, Izmir) who was known for his beauty which was noticed by all. According to the best-known version of the story, by Ovid, Narcissus rejected all advances, eventually falling in love with a reflection in a pool of water, tragically not realizing its similarity, entranced by it. In some versions, he beat his breast purple in agony at being kept apart from this reflected love, and in his place sprouted a flower bearing his name.

The character of Narcissus is the origin of the term narcissism, a self-centered personality style. This quality in extreme contributes to the definition of narcissistic personality disorder, a psychiatric condition marked by grandiosity, excessive need for attention and admiration, and an inability to empathize.

== Etymology ==
The name is of Greek etymology. According to R. S. P. Beekes, &quot;[t]he suffixes [-ισσος] clearly points to a Pre-Greek word.&quot; The word &quot;narcissus&quot; has come to be used for the daffodil, but there is no clarity on whether the flower is named for the myth or the myth for the flower, or if there is any true connection at all. Pliny the Elder wrote that the plant was named for its fragrance ( , &quot;I grow numb&quot;), not the mythological character.

In some versions, Narcissus was the son of the river god Cephissus and nymph Liriope, while Nonnus instead has him as the son of the lunar goddess Selene and her mortal lover Endymion.

== Mythology ==
Several versions of the myth have survived from ancient sources, one from Pausanias, the Greek traveler and geographer of the second century AD, and a more popular one from Ovid, published before 8 AD, found in Book 3 of his &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;. This is the story of Echo and Narcissus, a story within another story. In Ovid&#x27;s narrative, the framing revolves around a test of the prophetic abilities of Tiresias, an individual who has experienced life as both a man and a woman. His sight was taken from him during a dispute between Juno and Jove; siding with Jove led to his blinding by an enraged Juno. In compensation for his lost sight, Jove granted him the gift of prophecy. The prophecy that solidified Tiresias&#x27;s reputation is the tale of Echo and Narcissus.

After being &quot;ravaged&quot; by the river god Cephissus, the nymph Liriope gave birth to Narcissus, who was &quot;beautiful even as a child.&quot; As was the custom, she consulted the seer Tiresias about the boy&#x27;s future, who predicted that the boy would live a long life only if he never &quot;came to know himself&quot;. During his 16th year, after getting lost while hunting with friends, Narcissus came to be followed by a nymph, Echo.

Echo was an Oread (mountain nymph) and, like Tiresias, had a sensory ability altered after an argument between Juno and Jove. Echo had kept Juno occupied with gossip while Jove had an affair behind her back. In another similar version by Ovid, it Echo kept the goddess Juno occupied with stories while Zeus&#x27;s lovers escaped Mount Olympus. As a punishment, Juno took from Echo her agency in speech; Echo was thereafter never able to speak unless it was to repeat the last few words of those she heard. Echo had deceived using gossip; she would be condemned to be only that from then on.

Meanwhile, Echo spied Narcissus, separated from his hunting friends, and she became immediately infatuated, following him, waiting for him to speak so her feelings might be heard. Narcissus sensed he was being followed and shouted &quot;Who&#x27;s there?&quot; Echo repeated, &quot;Who&#x27;s there?&quot; While this interaction continued, Echo came close enough so that she was revealed, and attempted to embrace him. Horrified, he stepped back and told her to &quot;keep her chains&quot;. Heartbroken, Echo wasted away, losing her body amidst lonely glens, until nothing of her but her chaste verbal ability remained.

Nemesis, the goddess of revenge, heard the pleas of a young man, Ameinias, who had fallen for Narcissus but was ignored and cursed him; Nemesis listened, proclaiming that Narcissus would never be able to be loved by the one he fell in love with.

After spurning Echo and the young man, Narcissus became thirsty. He found a pool of water which, in Ovid&#x27;s account, no animal had ever approached. Leaning down to drink, Narcissus sees his reflection, which he finds as beautiful as a marble statue. Not realizing it was his own reflection, Narcissus fell deeply in love with it. Thus both Tiresias&#x27;s prophecy and Nemesis&#x27; curse came true in the same instance.
Unable to leave the allure of this image, Narcissus eventually realized that his love could not be reciprocated and he melted away from the fire of passion burning inside him, eventually turning into a gold and white flower.

Ovid was probably influenced by an earlier version ascribed to the captive Greek poet Parthenius of Nicaea, composed around 50 BC and rediscovered in 2004 by Dr Benjamin Henry among the Oxyrhynchus papyri at Oxford. This version is very concise and makes no mention of Echo.
 &quot;He had a cruel heart, and hated all of them, till he conceived a love for his own form: He wailed, seeing his face, delightful as a dream, within a spring; he wept for his beauty. Then the boy shed his blood and gave it to the earth... to bear.&quot;
 - from &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; by Parthenius of Nicaea
Parthenius implies that Narcissus did not die, saying that &quot;with his deathless blood there bloomed a lovely plant.&quot;

A version of the myth by Conon, a contemporary of Ovid, has an even bloodier ending (&quot;Narrations,&quot; 24), relating how a young man named Ameinias fell in love with Narcissus, who had already spurned his suitors, all of whom were male. Narcissus spurned him too and gave him a sword, which Ameinias used to kill himself at Narcissus&#x27;s doorstep after praying to the gods to teach Narcissus a lesson for all the pain he provoked. Narcissus walked by a pool of water and decided to drink some. He saw his reflection, became entranced by it, and killed himself because he could not have his object of desire. Because of this tragedy, the Thespians came to honor and reverence Eros especially among the gods. 

A century later the travel writer Pausanias recorded a novel variant of the story, in which Narcissus falls in love with his twin sister rather than himself. 

In all versions, his body disappears and all that is left is a narcissus flower.
== Influence on culture ==
The myth of Narcissus has inspired artists for at least two thousand years, even before the Roman poet Ovid featured a version in book III of his &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;. This was followed in more recent centuries by other poets (e.g. Keats and Alfred Edward Housman) and painters (Caravaggio, Poussin, Turner, Dalí (see &quot;Metamorphosis of Narcissus&quot;), and Waterhouse).

=== Literature ===


The myth had a decided influence on English Victorian homoerotic culture, via André Gide&#x27;s study of the myth, &quot;Le Traité du Narcisse&quot; (&#x27;The Treatise of the Narcissus&#x27;, 1891), and the only novel by Oscar Wilde, &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;.

Paulo Coelho&#x27;s &quot;The Alchemist&quot; also starts with a story about Narcissus, found (we are told) by the alchemist in a book brought by someone in the caravan. The alchemist&#x27;s (and Coelho&#x27;s) source was very probably Hesketh Pearson&#x27;s &quot;The Life of Oscar Wilde&quot; (1946) in which this story is recorded (Penguin edition, p. 217) as one of Wilde&#x27;s inspired inventions. This version of the Narcissus story is based on Wilde&#x27;s &quot;The Disciple&quot; from his &quot;Poems in Prose (Wilde) &quot;.

Author and poet Rainer Maria Rilke visits the character and symbolism of Narcissus in several of his poems.

Seamus Heaney references Narcissus in his poem &quot;Personal Helicon&quot; from his first collection &quot;Death of a Naturalist&quot;:To stare, big-eyed Narcissus, into some spring
Is beneath all adult dignity.

In Rick Riordan&#x27;s &quot;Heroes of Olympus series,&quot; Narcissus appears as a minor antagonist in the third book &quot;The Mark of Athena&quot;.

William Faulkner&#x27;s character &quot;Narcissa&quot; in &quot;Sanctuary&quot;, sister of Horace Benbow, was also named after Narcissus. Throughout the novel, she allows the arrogant, pompous pressures of high-class society to overrule the unconditional love that she should have for her brother.

Hermann Hesse&#x27;s character &quot;Narcissus&quot; in &quot;Narcissus and Goldmund&quot; shares several of mythical Narcissus&#x27; traits, although his narcissism is based on his intellect rather than his physical beauty.

A. E. Housman refers to the &#x27;Greek Lad&#x27;, Narcissus, in his poem &quot;Look not in my Eyes&quot; from &quot;A Shropshire Lad&quot; set to music by several English composers including George Butterworth. At the end of the poem stands a jonquil, a variety of daffodil, &quot;Narcissus jonquilla&quot;, which like Narcissus looks sadly down into the water.

Herman Melville references the myth of Narcissus in his novel Moby-Dick, in which Ishmael explains the myth as &quot;the key to it all,&quot; referring to the greater theme of finding the essence of Truth through the physical world.

On Sophia de Mello Breyner Andresen&#x27;s A Fada Oriana, the eponymous protagonist is punished with mortality for abandoning her duties in order to stare at herself in the surface of a river.

Joseph Conrad&#x27;s novel The Nigger of the &#x27;Narcissus&#x27; features a merchant ship named &quot;Narcissus&quot;. An incident involving the ship, and the difficult decisions made by the crew, explore themes involving self-interest vs. altruism and humanitarianism.

Naomi Iizuka&#x27;s play &quot;Polaroid Stories&quot;, a contemporary rewrite of the Orpheus and Eurydice myth, features Narcissus as a character. In the play he is portrayed as a self obsessed, and drug addicted young man who was raised on the streets. He is alluded to being a member of the LGBT+ community and mentions his sexual endeavours with older men, some ending with the death of these men due to drug overdoses. He is accompanied by the character Echo, whom he continuously spurns.

Petrarchan poetry, often in the form of a Petrarchan sonnet, has been profoundly impacted by the myth of Narcissus. Most notably, Petrarch&#x27;s Sonnet 45 contains themes and motifs inspired by the myth of Narcissus when the love interest, Laura, loves her reflection more than the narrator.

=== Music ===
* In Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s opera Patience, the ldyllic poet Archibald Grosvenor calls himself &quot;a very Narcissus&quot; after gazing at his own reflection.
* Composer Nikolai Tcherepnin wrote his ballet &quot;Narcisse et Echo, Op. 40&quot; in 1911 for Sergei Diaghilev&#x27;s Ballets Russes and was danced by Nijinski.
* The fifth of Benjamin Britten&#x27;s &quot;Six Metamorphoses after Ovid&quot; for solo oboe (1951) is titled &quot;Narcissus&quot;, &quot;who fell in love with his own image and became a flower&quot;.

=== Visual art ===
Narcissus has been a subject for many painters such as Caravaggio, Poussin, Turner, Dalí, Waterhouse, Carpioni, Lagrenée, and Roos.

Sculptors such as Paul Dubois, John Gibson, Henri-Léon Gréber, Benvenuto Cellini and Hubert Netzer have sculpted Narcissus.

<doc id="22102" wikidata="Q189929" url="?curid=22102" title="Naval mine">
<text>A naval mine is a self-contained explosive weapon placed in water to damage or destroy surface ships or submarines. Similar to anti-personnel and other land mines, and unlike purpose launched naval depth charges, they are deposited and left to wait until, depending on their fuzing, they are triggered by the approach of or contact with any vessel. 

Naval mines can be used offensively, to hamper enemy shipping movements or lock vessels into a harbour; or defensively, to create &quot;safe&quot; zones protecting friendly sea lanes, harbours, and naval assets. Mines allow the minelaying force commander to concentrate warships or defensive assets in mine-free areas giving the adversary three choices: undertake a resource-intensive and time-consuming minesweeping effort, accept the casualties of challenging the minefield, or use the unmined waters where the greatest concentration of enemy firepower will be encountered.

Although international law requires signatory nations to declare mined areas, precise locations remain secret, and non-complying parties might not disclose minelaying. While mines threaten only those who choose to traverse waters that may be mined, the possibility of activating a mine is a powerful disincentive to shipping. In the absence of effective measures to limit each mine&#x27;s lifespan, the hazard to shipping can remain long after the war in which the mines were laid is over. Unless detonated by a parallel time fuze at the end of their useful life, naval mines need to be found and dismantled after the end of hostilities; an often prolonged, costly, and hazardous task.

Modern mines containing high explosives detonated by complex electronic fuze mechanisms are much more effective than early gunpowder mines requiring physical ignition. Mines may be placed by aircraft, ships, submarines, or individual swimmers and boatmen. Minesweeping is the practice of the removal of explosive naval mines, usually by a specially designed ship called a minesweeper using various measures to either capture or detonate the mines, but sometimes also with an aircraft made for that purpose. There are also mines that release a homing torpedo rather than explode themselves.

== Description ==
Mines can be laid in many ways: by purpose-built minelayers, refitted ships, submarines, or aircraft—and even by dropping them into a harbour by hand. They can be inexpensive: some variants can cost as little as US $2,000, though more sophisticated mines can cost millions of dollars, be equipped with several kinds of sensors, and deliver a warhead by rocket or torpedo.
Their flexibility and cost-effectiveness make mines attractive to the less powerful belligerent in asymmetric warfare. The cost of producing and laying a mine is usually between 0.5% and 10% of the cost of removing it, and it can take up to 200 times as long to clear a minefield as to lay it. Parts of some World War II naval minefields still exist because they are too extensive and expensive to clear. Some 1940s-era mines may remain dangerous for many years.

Mines have been employed as offensive or defensive weapons in rivers, lakes, estuaries, seas, and oceans, but they can also be used as tools of psychological warfare. Offensive mines are placed in enemy waters, outside harbours, and across important shipping routes to sink both merchant and military vessels. Defensive minefields safeguard key stretches of coast from enemy ships and submarines, forcing them into more easily defended areas, or keeping them away from sensitive ones.

Shipowners are reluctant to send their ships through known minefields. Port authorities may attempt to clear a mined area, but those without effective minesweeping equipment may cease using the area. Transit of a mined area will be attempted only when strategic interests outweigh potential losses. The decision-makers&#x27; perception of the minefield is a critical factor. Minefields designed for psychological effect are usually placed on trade routes to stop ships from reaching an enemy nation. They are often spread thinly, to create an impression of minefields existing across large areas. A single mine inserted strategically on a shipping route can stop maritime movements for days while the entire area is swept. A mine&#x27;s capability to sink ships makes it a credible threat, but minefields work more on the mind than on ships.

International law, specifically the Eighth Hague Convention of 1907, requires nations to declare when they mine an area, to make it easier for civil shipping to avoid the mines. The warnings do not have to be specific; for example, during World War II, Britain declared simply that it had mined the English Channel, North Sea and French coast.

== History ==
=== Early use ===
Naval mines were first invented by Chinese innovators of Imperial China and were described in thorough detail by the early Ming dynasty artillery officer Jiao Yu, in his 14th-century military treatise known as the &quot;Huolongjing&quot;. Chinese records tell of naval explosives in the 16th century, used to fight against Japanese pirates (&quot;wokou&quot;). This kind of naval mine was loaded in a wooden box, sealed with putty. General Qi Jiguang made several timed, drifting explosives, to harass Japanese pirate ships. The &quot;Tiangong Kaiwu&quot; (&quot;The Exploitation of the Works of Nature&quot;) treatise, written by Song Yingxing in 1637, describes naval mines with a ripcord pulled by hidden ambushers located on the nearby shore who rotated a steel wheel flint mechanism to produce sparks and ignite the fuze of the naval mine. Although this is the rotating steel wheel&#x27;s first use in naval mines, Jiao Yu described their use for land mines in the 14th century.

The first plan for a sea mine in the West was by Ralph Rabbards, who presented his design to Queen Elizabeth I of England in 1574. The Dutch inventor Cornelius Drebbel was employed in the Office of Ordnance by King Charles I of England to make weapons, including the failed &quot;floating petard&quot;. Weapons of this type were apparently tried by the English at the Siege of La Rochelle in 1627.
American David Bushnell developed the first American naval mine, for use against the British in the American War of Independence. It was a watertight keg filled with gunpowder that was floated toward the enemy, detonated by a sparking mechanism if it struck a ship. It was used on the Delaware River as a drift mine, destroying a small boat near its intended target, a British warship.

=== The 19th century ===
The 1804 Raid on Boulogne made extensive use of explosive devices designed by inventor Robert Fulton. The &#x27;torpedo-catamaran&#x27; was a coffer-like device balanced on two wooden floats and steered by a man with a paddle. Weighted with lead so as to ride low in the water, the operator was further disguised by wearing dark clothes and a black cap. His task was to approach the French ship, hook the torpedo to the anchor cable and, having activated the device by removing a pin, remove the paddles and escape before the torpedo detonated. Also to be deployed were large numbers of casks filled with gunpowder, ballast and combustible balls. They would float in on the tide and on washing up against an enemy&#x27;s hull, explode. Also included in the force were several fireships, carrying 40 barrels of gunpowder and rigged to explode by a clockwork mechanism.

In 1812, Russian engineer Pavel Shilling exploded an underwater mine using an electrical circuit. In 1842 Samuel Colt used an electric detonator to destroy a moving vessel to demonstrate an underwater mine of his own design to the United States Navy and President John Tyler. However, opposition from former president John Quincy Adams, scuttled the project as &quot;not fair and honest warfare&quot;. In 1854, during the unsuccessful attempt of the Anglo-French (101 warships) fleet to seize the Kronstadt fortress, British steamships (9 June 1855, the first successful mining in Western history), and HMS &quot;Firefly&quot; suffered damage due to the underwater explosions of Russian naval mines. Russian naval specialists set more than 1,500 naval mines, or &quot;infernal machines&quot;, designed by Moritz von Jacobi and by Immanuel Nobel, in the Gulf of Finland during the Crimean War of 1853–1856. The mining of &quot;Vulcan&quot; led to the world&#x27;s first minesweeping operation. During the next 72 hours, 33 mines were swept.

The Jacobi mine was designed by German-born, Russian engineer Jacobi, in 1853. The mine was tied to the sea bottom by an anchor. A cable connected it to a galvanic cell which powered it from the shore, the power of its explosive charge was equal to of black powder. In the summer of 1853, the production of the mine was approved by the Committee for Mines of the Ministry of War of the Russian Empire. In 1854, 60 Jacobi mines were laid in the vicinity of the Forts Pavel and Alexander (Kronstadt), to deter the British Baltic Fleet from attacking them. It gradually phased out its direct competitor the Nobel mine on the insistence of Admiral Fyodor Litke. The Nobel mines were bought from Swedish industrialist Immanuel Nobel who had entered into collusion with the Russian head of navy Alexander Sergeyevich Menshikov. Despite their high cost (100 Russian rubles) the Nobel mines proved to be faulty, exploding while being laid, failing to explode or detaching from their wires, and drifting uncontrollably, at least 70 of them were subsequently disarmed by the British. In 1855, 301 more Jacobi mines were laid around Krostadt and Lisy Nos. British ships did not dare to approach them.

In the 19th century, mines were called torpedoes, a name probably conferred by Robert Fulton after the torpedo fish, which gives powerful electric shocks. A spar torpedo was a mine attached to a long pole and detonated when the ship carrying it rammed another one and withdrew a safe distance. The submarine used one to sink on 17 February 1864. A Harvey torpedo was a type of floating mine towed alongside a ship and was briefly in service in the Royal Navy in the 1870s. Other &quot;torpedoes&quot; were attached to ships or propelled themselves. One such weapon called the Whitehead torpedo after its inventor, caused the word &quot;torpedo&quot; to apply to self-propelled underwater missiles as well as to static devices. These mobile devices were also known as &quot;fish torpedoes&quot;.

The American Civil War of 1861–1865 also saw the successful use of mines. The first ship sunk by a mine, , foundered in 1862 in the Yazoo River. Rear Admiral David Farragut&#x27;s famous command during the Battle of Mobile Bay in 1864, &quot;Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead!&quot; refers to a minefield laid at Mobile, Alabama.

After 1865 the United States adopted the mine as its primary weapon for coastal defense. In the decade following 1868, Major Henry Larcom Abbot carried out a lengthy set of experiments to design and test moored mines that could be exploded on contact or be detonated at will as enemy shipping passed near them. This initial development of mines in the United States took place under the purview of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which trained officers and men in their use at the Engineer School of Application at Willets Point, New York (later named Fort Totten). In 1901 underwater minefields became the responsibility of the US Army&#x27;s Artillery Corps, and in 1907 this was a founding responsibility of the United States Army Coast Artillery Corps.

The Imperial Russian Navy, a pioneer in mine warfare, successfully deployed mines against the Ottoman Navy during both the Crimean War and the Russo-Turkish War (1877-1878).

During the War of the Pacific (1879-1883), the Peruvian Navy, at a time when the Chilean squadron was blockading the Peruvian ports, formed a brigade of torpedo boats under the command of the frigate captain Leopoldo Sánchez Calderón and the Peruvian engineer Manuel Cuadros, who perfected the naval torpedo or mine system to be electrically activated when the cargo weight was lifted. This is how, on 3 July 1880, in front of the port of Callao, the gunned transport &quot;Loa&quot; flies when capturing a sloop mined by the Peruvians. A similar fate occurred with the gunboat schooner &quot;Covadonga&quot; in front of the port of Chancay, on 13 September 1880, which having captured and checked a beautiful boat, it exploded when hoisting it on its side.

During the Battle of Tamsui (1884), in the Keelung Campaign of the Sino-French War, Chinese forces in Taiwan under Liu Mingchuan took measures to reinforce Tamsui against the French; they planted nine torpedo mines in the river and blocked the entrance.

=== Early 20th century ===
During the Boxer Rebellion, Imperial Chinese forces deployed a command-detonated mine field at the mouth of the Hai River before the Dagu forts, to prevent the western Allied forces from sending ships to attack.

The next major use of mines was during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905. Two mines blew up when the struck them near Port Arthur, sending the holed vessel to the bottom and killing the fleet commander, Admiral Stepan Makarov, and most of his crew in the process. The toll inflicted by mines was not confined to the Russians, however. The Japanese Navy lost two battleships, four cruisers, two destroyers and a torpedo-boat to offensively laid mines during the war. Most famously, on 15 May 1904, the Russian minelayer &quot;Amur&quot; planted a 50-mine minefield off Port Arthur and succeeded in sinking the Japanese battleships and .

Following the end of the Russo-Japanese War, several nations attempted to have mines banned as weapons of war at the Hague Peace Conference (1907).

Many early mines were fragile and dangerous to handle, as they contained glass containers filled with nitroglycerin or mechanical devices that activated a blast upon tipping. Several mine-laying ships were destroyed when their cargo exploded.

Beginning around the start of the 20th century, submarine mines played a major role in the defense of U.S. harbours against enemy attacks as part of the Endicott and Taft Programs. The mines employed were controlled mines, anchored to the bottoms of the harbours, and detonated under control from large mine casemates onshore.

During World War I, mines were used extensively to defend coasts, coastal shipping, ports and naval bases around the globe. The Germans laid mines in shipping lanes to sink merchant and naval vessels serving Britain. The Allies targeted the German U-boats in the Strait of Dover and the Hebrides. In an attempt to seal up the northern exits of the North Sea, the Allies developed the North Sea Mine Barrage. During a period of five months from June 1918, almost 70,000 mines were laid spanning the North Sea&#x27;s northern exits. The total number of mines laid in the North Sea, the British East Coast, Straits of Dover, and Heligoland Bight is estimated at 190,000 and the total number during the whole of WWI was 235,000 sea mines. Clearing the barrage after the war took 82 ships and five months, working around the clock. It was also during World War I, that the British hospital ship, , became the largest vessel ever sunk by a naval mine. The &quot;Britannic&quot; was the sister ship of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;, and the .

=== World War II ===

During World War II, the U-boat fleet, which dominated much of the battle of the Atlantic, was small at the beginning of the war and much of the early action by German forces involved mining convoy routes and ports around Britain. German submarines also operated in the Mediterranean Sea, in the Caribbean Sea, and along the U.S. coast.

Initially, contact mines (requiring a ship to physically strike a mine to detonate it) were employed, usually tethered at the end of a cable just below the surface of the water. Contact mines usually blew a hole in ships&#x27; hulls. By the beginning of World War II, most nations had developed mines that could be dropped from aircraft, some of which floated on the surface, making it possible to lay them in enemy harbours. The use of dredging and nets was effective against this type of mine, but this consumed valuable time and resources and required harbours to be closed.

Later, some ships survived mine blasts, limping into port with buckled plates and broken backs. This appeared to be due to a new type of mine, detecting ships by their proximity to the mine (an influence mine) and detonating at a distance, causing damage with the shock wave of the explosion. Ships that had successfully run the gantlet of the Atlantic crossing were sometimes destroyed entering freshly cleared British harbours. More shipping was being lost than could be replaced, and Churchill ordered the intact recovery of one of these new mines to be of the highest priority.
The British experienced a stroke of luck in November 1939, when a German mine was dropped from an aircraft onto the mudflats off Shoeburyness during low tide. Additionally, the land belonged to the army and a base with men and workshops was at hand. Experts were dispatched from to investigate the mine. The Royal Navy knew that mines could use magnetic sensors, Britain having developed magnetic mines in World War I, so everyone removed all metal, including their buttons, and made tools of non-magnetic brass. They disarmed the mine and rushed it to the labs at HMS Vernon, where scientists discovered that the mine had a magnetic arming mechanism. A large ferrous object passing through the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field will concentrate the field through it, due to its magnetic permeability; the mine&#x27;s detector was designed to trigger as a ship passed over when the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field was concentrated in the ship and away from the mine. The mine detected this loss of the magnetic field which caused it to detonate. The mechanism had an adjustable sensitivity, calibrated in milligauss.
From this data, known methods were used to clear these mines. Early methods included the use of large electromagnets dragged behind ships or below low-flying aircraft (a number of older bombers like the Vickers Wellington were used for this). Both of these methods had the disadvantage of &quot;sweeping&quot; only a small strip. A better solution was found in the &quot;Double-L Sweep&quot; using electrical cables dragged behind ships that passed large pulses of current through the seawater. This created a large magnetic field and swept the entire area between the two ships. The older methods continued to be used in smaller areas. The Suez Canal continued to be swept by aircraft, for instance.

While these methods were useful for clearing mines from local ports, they were of little or no use for enemy-controlled areas. These were typically visited by warships, and the majority of the fleet then underwent a massive degaussing process, where their hulls had a slight &quot;south&quot; bias induced into them which offset the concentration-effect almost to zero.

Initially, major warships and large troopships had a copper &quot;degaussing coil&quot; fitted around the perimeter of the hull, energized by the ship&#x27;s electrical system whenever in suspected magnetic-mined waters. Some of the first to be so fitted were the carrier and the liners and . It was a photo of one of these liners in New York harbour, showing the degaussing coil, which revealed to German Naval Intelligence the fact that the British were using degaussing methods to combat their magnetic mines. This was felt to be impractical for smaller warships and merchant vessels, mainly because the ships lacked the generating capacity to energise such a coil. It was found that &quot;wiping&quot; a current-carrying cable up and down a ship&#x27;s hull temporarily canceled the ships&#x27; magnetic signature sufficiently to nullify the threat. This started in late 1939, and by 1940 merchant vessels and the smaller British warships were largely immune for a few months at a time until they once again built up a field.

The cruiser is just one example of a ship that was struck by a magnetic mine during this time. On 21 November 1939, a mine broke her keel, which damaged her engine and boiler rooms, as well as injuring 46 men, one later died from his injuries. She was towed to Rosyth for repairs. Incidents like this resulted in many of the boats that sailed to Dunkirk being degaussed in a marathon four-day effort by degaussing stations.
The Allies and Germany deployed acoustic mines in World War II, against which even wooden-hulled ships (in particular minesweepers) remained vulnerable. Japan developed sonic generators to sweep these; the gear was not ready by war&#x27;s end. The primary method Japan used was small air-delivered bombs. This was profligate and ineffectual; used against acoustic mines at Penang, 200 bombs were needed to detonate just 13 mines.

The Germans developed a pressure-activated mine and planned to deploy it as well, but they saved it for later use when it became clear the British had defeated the magnetic system. The U.S. also deployed these, adding &quot;counters&quot; which would allow a variable number of ships to pass unharmed before detonating. This made them a great deal harder to sweep.

Mining campaigns could have devastating consequences. The U.S. effort against Japan, for instance, closed major ports, such as Hiroshima, for days, and by the end of the Pacific War had cut the amount of freight passing through Kobe–Yokohama by 90%.

When the war ended, more than 25,000 U.S.-laid mines were still in place, and the Navy proved unable to sweep them all, limiting efforts to critical areas. After sweeping for almost a year, in May 1946, the Navy abandoned the effort with 13,000 mines still unswept. Over the next thirty years, more than 500 minesweepers (of a variety of types) were damaged or sunk clearing them.

The U.S. began adding delay counters to their magnetic mines in June 1945.

=== Cold War era ===

Since World War II, mines have damaged 14 United States Navy ships, whereas air and missile attacks have damaged four. During the Korean War, mines laid by North Korean forces caused 70% of the casualties suffered by U.S. naval vessels and caused 4 sinkings.

During the Iran–Iraq War from 1980 to 1988, the belligerents mined several areas of the Persian Gulf and nearby waters. On 24 July 1987, the supertanker &quot;SS&quot; Bridgeton was mined by Iran near Farsi Island. On 14 April 1988, struck an Iranian mine in the central Persian Gulf shipping lane, wounding 10 sailors.

In the summer of 1984, magnetic sea mines damaged at least 19 ships in the Red Sea. The U.S. concluded Libya was probably responsible for the minelaying. In response the U.S., Britain, France, and three other nations launched &quot;Operation Intense Look&quot;, a minesweeping operation in the Red Sea involving more than 46 ships.

On the orders of the Reagan administration, the CIA mined Nicaragua&#x27;s Sandino port in 1984 in support of the Contras. A Soviet tanker was among the ships damaged by these mines. In 1986, in the case of &quot;Nicaragua v. United States&quot;, the International Court of Justice ruled that this mining was a violation of international law.

=== Post Cold War ===
During the Gulf War, Iraqi naval mines severely damaged and . When the war concluded, eight countries conducted clearance operations.

Houthi forces in the Yemeni Civil War have made frequent use of naval mines, laying over 150 in the Red Sea throughout the conflict.

In the first month of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Ukraine accused Russia of deliberately employing drifting mines in the Black Sea area. Around the same time, Turkish and Romanian military diving teams were involved in defusing operations, when stray mines were spotted near the coasts of these countries. London P&amp;I Club issued a warning to freight ships in the area, advising them to &quot;maintain lookouts for mines and pay careful attention to local navigation warnings&quot;. Ukrainian forces have mined &quot;from the Sea of Azov to the Black Sea which banks the critical city of Odesa.&quot;

== Types ==

Naval mines may be classified into three major groups; contact, remote and influence mines.

=== Contact mines ===
The earliest mines were usually of this type. They are still used today, as they are extremely low cost compared to any other anti-ship weapon and are effective, both as a psychological weapon and as a method to sink enemy ships. Contact mines need to be touched by the target before they detonate, limiting the damage to the direct effects of the explosion and usually affecting only the vessel that triggers them.

Early mines had mechanical mechanisms to detonate them, but these were superseded in the 1870s by the &quot;Hertz horn&quot; (or &quot;chemical horn&quot;), which was found to work reliably even after the mine had been in the sea for several years. The mine&#x27;s upper half is studded with hollow lead protuberances, each containing a glass vial filled with sulfuric acid. When a ship&#x27;s hull crushes the metal horn, it cracks the vial inside it, allowing the acid to run down a tube and into a lead–acid battery which until then contained no acid electrolyte. This energizes the battery, which detonates the explosive.

Earlier forms of the detonator employed a vial of sulfuric acid surrounded by a mixture of potassium perchlorate and sugar. When the vial was crushed, the acid ignited the perchlorate-sugar mix, and the resulting flame ignited the gunpowder charge.

During the initial period of World War I, the Royal Navy used contact mines in the English Channel and later in large areas of the North Sea to hinder patrols by German submarines. Later, the American antenna mine was widely used because submarines could be at any depth from the surface to the seabed. This type of mine had a copper wire attached to a buoy that floated above the explosive charge which was weighted to the seabed with a steel cable. If a submarine&#x27;s steel hull touched the copper wire, the slight voltage change caused by contact between two dissimilar metals was amplified and detonated the explosives.

==== Limpet mines ====

Limpet mines are a special form of contact mine that are manually attached to the target by magnets and remain in place. They are named because of the similarity to the limpet, a mollusk.

==== Moored contact mines ====
Generally, this type of mine is set to float just below the surface of the water or as deep as five meters. A steel cable connecting the mine to an anchor on the seabed prevents it from drifting away. The explosive and detonating mechanism is contained in a buoyant metal or plastic shell. The depth below the surface at which the mine floats can be set so that only deep draft vessels such as aircraft carriers, battleships or large cargo ships are at risk, saving the mine from being used on a less valuable target. In littoral waters it is important to ensure that the mine does not become visible when the sea level falls at low tide, so the cable length is adjusted to take account of tides. During WWII there were mines that could be moored in -deep water.

Floating mines typically have a mass of around , including of explosives e.g. TNT, minol or amatol.

===== Moored contact mines with plummet =====

A special form of moored contact mines are those equipped with a plummet. When the mine is launched (1), the mine with the anchor floats first and the lead plummet sinks from it (2). In doing so, the plummet unwinds a wire, the deep line, which is used to set the depth of the mine below the water surface before it is launched (3). When the deep line has been unwound to a set length, the anchor is flooded and the mine is released from the anchor (4). The anchor begins to sink and the mooring cable unwinds until the plummet reaches the sea floor (5). Triggered by the decreasing tension on the deep line, the mooring cable is clamped. The anchor continues sinking down to the bottom of the sea, pulling the mine below the water surface to a depth equal to the length of the deep line (6). Thus, even without knowing the exact seafloor depth, an exact depth of the mine below the water surface can be set, limited only by the maximum length of the mooring cable.

==== Drifting contact mines ====
Drifting mines were occasionally used during World War I and World War II. However, they were more feared than effective. Sometimes floating mines break from their moorings and become drifting mines; modern mines are designed to deactivate in this event. After several years at sea, the deactivation mechanism might not function as intended and the mines may remain live. Admiral Jellicoe&#x27;s British fleet did not pursue and destroy the outnumbered German High Seas Fleet when it turned away at the Battle of Jutland because he thought they were leading him into a trap: he believed it possible that the Germans were either leaving floating mines in their wake, or were drawing him towards submarines, although neither of these was the case.

After World War I the drifting contact mine was banned, but was occasionally used during World War II. The drifting mines were much harder to remove than tethered mines after the war, and they caused about the same damage to both sides.

Churchill promoted &quot;Operation Royal Marine&quot; in 1940 and again in 1944 where floating mines were put into the Rhine in France to float down the river, becoming active after a time calculated to be long enough to reach German territory.

=== Remotely controlled mines ===
Frequently used in combination with coastal artillery and hydrophones, controlled mines (or command detonation mines) can be in place in peacetime, which is a huge advantage in blocking important shipping routes. The mines can usually be turned into &quot;normal&quot; mines with a switch (which prevents the enemy from simply capturing the controlling station and deactivating the mines), detonated on a signal or be allowed to detonate on their own. The earliest ones were developed around 1812 by Robert Fulton. The first remotely controlled mines were moored mines used in the American Civil War, detonated electrically from shore. They were considered superior to contact mines because they did not put friendly shipping at risk. The extensive American fortifications program initiated by the Board of Fortifications in 1885 included remotely controlled mines, which were emplaced or in reserve from the 1890s until the end of World War II.

Modern examples usually weigh , including of explosives (TNT or torpex).

=== Influence mines ===

These mines are triggered by the influence of a ship or submarine, rather than direct contact. Such mines incorporate sensors designed to detect the presence of a vessel and detonate when it comes within the blast range of the warhead. The fuzes on such mines may incorporate one or more of the following sensors: magnetic, passive acoustic or water pressure displacement caused by the proximity of a vessel.

First used during WWI, their use became more general in WWII. The sophistication of influence mine fuzes has increased considerably over the years as first transistors and then microprocessors have been incorporated into designs. Simple magnetic sensors have been superseded by total-field magnetometers. Whereas early magnetic mine fuzes would respond only to changes in a single component of a target vessel&#x27;s magnetic field, a total field magnetometer responds to changes in the magnitude of the total background field (thus enabling it to better detect even degaussed ships). Similarly, the original broadband hydrophones of 1940s acoustic mines (which operate on the integrated volume of all frequencies) have been replaced by narrow-band sensors which are much more sensitive and selective. Mines can now be programmed to listen for highly specific acoustic signatures (e.g. a gas turbine powerplant or cavitation sounds from a particular design of propeller) and ignore all others. The sophistication of modern electronic mine fuzes incorporating these digital signal processing capabilities makes it much more difficult to detonate the mine with electronic countermeasures because several sensors working together (e.g. magnetic, passive acoustic and water pressure) allow it to ignore signals which are not recognised as being the unique signature of an intended target vessel.

Modern influence mines such as the BAE Stonefish are computerised, with all the programmability this implies, such as the ability to quickly load new acoustic signatures into fuzes, or program them to detect a single, highly distinctive target signature. In this way, a mine with a passive acoustic fuze can be programmed to ignore all friendly vessels and small enemy vessels, only detonating when a very large enemy target passes over it. Alternatively, the mine can be programmed specifically to ignore all surface vessels regardless of size and exclusively target submarines.

Even as far back as WWII it was possible to incorporate a &quot;ship counter&quot; function in mine fuzes. This might set the mine to ignore the first two ships passing over it (which could be minesweepers deliberately trying to trigger mines) but detonate when the third ship passes overhead, which could be a high-value target such as an aircraft carrier or oil tanker. Even though modern mines are generally powered by a long life lithium battery, it is important to conserve power because they may need to remain active for months or even years. For this reason, most influence mines are designed to remain in a semi-dormant state until an unpowered (e.g. deflection of a mu-metal needle) or low-powered sensor detects the possible presence of a vessel, at which point the mine fuze powers up fully and the passive acoustic sensors will begin to operate for some minutes. It is possible to program computerised mines to delay activation for days or weeks after being laid. Similarly, they can be programmed to self-destruct or render themselves safe after a preset period of time. Generally, the more sophisticated the mine design, the more likely it is to have some form of anti-handling device to hinder clearance by divers or remotely piloted submersibles.

==== Moored mines ====
The moored mine is the backbone of modern mine systems. They are deployed where water is too deep for bottom mines. They can use several kinds of instruments to detect an enemy, usually a combination of acoustic, magnetic and pressure sensors, or more sophisticated optical shadows or electro potential sensors. These cost many times more than contact mines. Moored mines are effective against most kinds of ships. As they are cheaper than other anti-ship weapons they can be deployed in large numbers, making them useful area denial or &quot;channelizing&quot; weapons.
Moored mines usually have lifetimes of more than 10 years, and some almost unlimited. These mines usually weigh , including of explosives (RDX). In excess of of explosives the mine becomes inefficient, as it becomes too large to handle and the extra explosives add little to the mine&#x27;s effectiveness.

==== Bottom mines ====
Bottom mines (sometimes called ground mines) are used when the water is no more than deep or when mining for submarines down to around . They are much harder to detect and sweep, and can carry a much larger warhead than a moored mine. Bottom mines commonly use multiple types of sensors, which are less sensitive to sweeping.

These mines usually weigh between , including between of explosives.

=== Unusual mines ===
Several specialized mines have been developed for other purposes than the common minefield.

==== Bouquet mine ====
The bouquet mine is a single anchor attached to several floating mines. It is designed so that when one mine is swept or detonated, another takes its place. It is a very sensitive construction and lacks reliability.

==== Anti-sweep mine ====

The anti-sweep mine is a very small mine ( warhead) with as small a floating device as possible. When the wire of a mine sweep hits the anchor wire of the mine, it drags the anchor wire along with it, pulling the mine down into contact with the sweeping wire. That detonates the mine and cuts the sweeping wire. They are very cheap and usually used in combination with other mines in a minefield to make sweeping more difficult. One type is the Mark 23 used by the United States during World War II.

==== Oscillating mine ====
The mine is hydrostatically controlled to maintain a pre-set depth below the water&#x27;s surface independently of the rise and fall of the tide.

==== Ascending mine ====
The ascending mine is a floating distance mine that may cut its mooring or in some other way float higher when it detects a target. It lets a single floating mine cover a much larger depth range.

==== Homing mines ====
These are mines containing a moving weapon as a warhead, either a torpedo or a rocket.

====Rocket mine====
A Russian invention, the rocket mine is a bottom distance mine that fires a homing high-speed rocket (not torpedo) upwards towards the target. It is intended to allow a bottom mine to attack surface ships as well as submarines from a greater depth. One type is the Te-1 rocket propelled mine.

====Torpedo mine====
A torpedo mine is a self-propelled variety, able to lie in wait for a target and then pursue it e.g. the Mark 60 CAPTOR. Generally, torpedo mines incorporate computerised acoustic and magnetic fuzes. The U.S. Mark 24 &quot;mine&quot;, code-named Fido, was actually an ASW homing torpedo. The mine designation was disinformation to conceal its function.

==== Mobile mine ====
The mine is propelled to its intended position by propulsion equipment such as a torpedo. After reaching its destination, it sinks to the seabed and operates like a standard mine. It differs from the homing mine in that its mobile stage is set before it lies in wait, rather than as part of the attacking phase.

One such design is the Mk 67 Submarine Launched Mobile Mine (which is based on a Mark 37 torpedo), capable of traveling as far as through or into a channel, harbour, shallow water area, and other zones which would normally be inaccessible to craft laying the device. After reaching the target area they sink to the sea bed and act like conventionally laid influence mines.

==== Nuclear mine ====
During the Cold War, a test was conducted with a naval mine fitted with tactical nuclear warheads for the &quot;Baker&quot; shot of Operation Crossroads. This weapon was experimental and never went into production. The Seabed Arms Control Treaty prohibits the placement of nuclear weapons on the seabed beyond a 12-mile coast zone.

==== Daisy-chained mine ====
This comprises two moored, floating contact mines which are tethered together by a length of steel cable or chain. Typically, each mine is situated approximately away from its neighbor, and each floats a few meters below the surface of the ocean. When the target ship hits the steel cable, the mines on either side are drawn down the side of the ship&#x27;s hull, exploding on contact. In this manner it is almost impossible for target ships to pass safely between two individually moored mines. Daisy-chained mines are a very simple concept which was used during World War II. The first prototype of the Daisy-chained mine and the first combat use came in Finland, 1939.

==== Dummy mine ====
Plastic drums filled with sand or concrete are periodically rolled off the side of ships as real mines are laid in large mine-fields. These inexpensive false targets (designed to be of a similar shape and size as genuine mines) are intended to slow down the process of mine clearance: a mine-hunter is forced to investigate each suspicious sonar contact on the sea bed, whether it is real or not. Often a maker of naval mines will provide both training and dummy versions of their mines.

== Mine laying ==


Historically several methods were used to lay mines. During WWI and WWII, the Germans used U-boats to lay mines around the UK. In WWII, aircraft came into favour for mine laying with one of the largest examples being the mining of the Japanese sea routes in Operation Starvation.

Laying a minefield is a relatively fast process with specialized ships, which is today the most common method. These minelayers can carry several thousand mines and manoeuvre with high precision. The mines are dropped at predefined intervals into the water behind the ship. Each mine is recorded for later clearing, but it is not unusual for these records to be lost together with the ships. Therefore, many countries demand that all mining operations be planned on land and records kept so that the mines can later be recovered more easily.

Other methods to lay minefields include:

* Converted merchant ships – rolled or slid down ramps
* Aircraft – descent to the water is slowed by a parachute
* Submarines – launched from torpedo tubes or deployed from specialized mine racks on the sides of the submarine
* Combat boats – rolled off the side of the boat
* Camouflaged boats – masquerading as fishing boats
* Dropping from the shore – typically smaller, shallow-water mines
* Attack divers – smaller shallow-water mines

In some cases, mines are automatically activated upon contact with the water. In others, a safety lanyard is pulled (one end attached to the rail of a ship, aircraft or torpedo tube) which starts an automatic timer countdown before the arming process is complete. Typically, the automatic safety-arming process takes some minutes to complete. This allows the people laying the mines sufficient time to move out of its activation and blast zones.

=== Aerial mining in World War II ===
==== Germany ====
In the 1930s, Germany had experimented with the laying of mines by aircraft. It became a crucial element in their overall mining strategy. Aircraft had the advantage of speed, and they would never get caught in their own minefields. German mines held a large explosive charge. From April to June 1940, the Luftwaffe laid 1,000 mines in British waters. Soviet ports were mined, as was the Arctic convoy route to Murmansk. The Heinkel He 115 could carry two medium or one large mine while the Heinkel He 59, Dornier Do 18, Junkers Ju 88 and Heinkel He 111 could carry more.

==== Soviet Union ====
The USSR was relatively ineffective in its use of naval mines in WWII in comparison with its record in previous wars. Small mines were developed for use in rivers and lakes, and special mines for shallow water. A very large chemical mine was designed to sink through ice with the aid of a melting compound. Special aerial mine designs finally arrived in 1943–1944, the AMD-500 and AMD-1000. Various Soviet Naval Aviation torpedo bombers were pressed into the role of aerial mining in the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea, including Ilyushin DB-3s, Il-4s and Lend-Lease Douglas Boston IIIs.

==== United Kingdom ====
In September 1939, the UK announced the placement of extensive defensive minefields in waters surrounding the Home Islands. Offensive aerial mining operations began in April 1940 when 38 mines were laid at each of these locations: the Elbe River, the port of Lübeck and the German naval base at Kiel. In the next 20 months, mines delivered by aircraft sank or damaged 164 Axis ships with the loss of 94 aircraft. By comparison, direct aerial attacks on Axis shipping had sunk or damaged 105 vessels at a cost of 373 aircraft lost. The advantage of aerial mining became clear, and the UK prepared for it. A total of 48,000 aerial mines were laid by the Royal Air Force (RAF) in the European Theatre during World War II.

==== United States ====
As early as 1942, American mining experts such as Naval Ordnance Laboratory scientist Dr. Ellis A. Johnson, CDR USNR, suggested massive aerial mining operations against Japan&#x27;s &quot;outer zone&quot; (Korea and northern China) as well as the &quot;inner zone&quot;, their home islands. First, aerial mines would have to be developed further and manufactured in large numbers. Second, laying the mines would require a sizable air group. The US Army Air Forces had the carrying capacity but considered mining to be the navy&#x27;s job. The US Navy lacked suitable aircraft. Johnson set about convincing General Curtis LeMay of the efficacy of heavy bombers laying aerial mines.

B-24 Liberators, PBY Catalinas and other bomber aircraft took part in localized mining operations in the Southwest Pacific and the China Burma India (CBI) theaters, beginning with a successful attack on the Yangon River in February 1943. Aerial minelaying operations involved a coalition of British, Australian and American aircrews, with the RAF and the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) carrying out 60% of the sorties and the USAAF and US Navy covering 40%. Both British and American mines were used. Japanese merchant shipping suffered tremendous losses, while Japanese mine sweeping forces were spread too thin attending to far-flung ports and extensive coastlines. Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid, who directed nearly all RAAF mining operations in CBI, heartily endorsed aerial mining, writing in July 1944 that &quot;aerial mining operations were of the order of 100 times as destructive to the enemy as an equal number of bombing missions against land targets.&quot;

A single B-24 dropped three mines into Haiphong harbour in October 1943. One of those mines sank a Japanese freighter. Another B-24 dropped three more mines into the harbour in November, and a second freighter was sunk by a mine. The threat of the remaining mines prevented a convoy of ten ships from entering Haiphong, and six of those ships were sunk by attacks before they reached a safe harbour. The Japanese closed Haiphong to all steel-hulled ships for the remainder of the war after another small ship was sunk by one of the remaining mines, although they may not have realized no more than three mines remained.

Using Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bombers, the US Navy mounted a direct aerial mining attack on enemy shipping in Palau on 30 March 1944 in concert with simultaneous conventional bombing and strafing attacks. The dropping of 78 mines deterred 32 Japanese ships from escaping Koror harbour, and 23 of those immobilized ships were sunk in a subsequent bombing raid. The combined operation sank or damaged 36 ships. Two Avengers were lost, and their crews were recovered. The mines brought port usage to a halt for 20 days. Japanese mine sweeping was unsuccessful; and the Japanese abandoned Palau as a base when their first ship attempting to traverse the swept channel was damaged by a mine detonation.

In March 1945, Operation Starvation began in earnest, using 160 of LeMay&#x27;s B-29 Superfortress bombers to attack Japan&#x27;s inner zone. Almost half of the mines were the US-built Mark 25 model, carrying of explosives and weighing about . Other mines used included the smaller Mark 26. Fifteen B-29s were lost while 293 Japanese merchant ships were sunk or damaged. Twelve thousand aerial mines were laid, a significant barrier to Japan&#x27;s access to outside resources. Prince Fumimaro Konoe said after the war that the aerial mining by B-29s had been &quot;equally as effective as the B-29 attacks on Japanese industry at the closing stages of the war when all food supplies and critical material were prevented from reaching the Japanese home islands.&quot; The United States Strategic Bombing Survey (Pacific War) concluded that it would have been more efficient to combine the United States&#x27;s effective anti-shipping submarine effort with land- and carrier-based air power to strike harder against merchant shipping and begin a more extensive aerial mining campaign earlier in the war. Survey analysts projected that this would have starved Japan, forcing an earlier end to the war. After the war, Dr. Johnson looked at the Japan inner zone shipping results, comparing the total economic cost of submarine-delivered mines versus air-dropped mines and found that, though 1 in 12 submarine mines connected with the enemy as opposed to 1 in 21 for aircraft mines, the aerial mining operation was about ten times less expensive per enemy ton sunk.

==== Clearing WWII aerial mines ====
Between 600,000 and 1,000,000 naval mines of all types were laid in WWII. Advancing military forces worked to clear mines from newly-taken areas, but extensive minefields remained in place after the war. Air-dropped mines had an additional problem for mine sweeping operations: they were not meticulously charted. In Japan, much of the B-29 mine-laying work had been performed at high altitude, with the drifting on the wind of mines carried by parachute adding a randomizing factor to their placement. Generalized danger areas were identified, with only the quantity of mines given in detail. Mines used in Operation Starvation were supposed to be self-sterilizing, but the circuit did not always work. Clearing the mines from Japanese waters took so many years that the task was eventually given to the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force.

For the purpose of clearing all types of naval mines, the Royal Navy employed German crews and minesweepers from June 1945 to January 1948, organised in the German Mine Sweeping Administration (GMSA), which consisted of 27,000 members of the former &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; and 300 vessels. Mine clearing was not always successful: a number of ships were damaged or sunk by mines after the war. Two such examples were the liberty ships &quot;Pierre Gibault&quot; which was scrapped after hitting a mine in a previously cleared area off the Greek island of Kythira in June 1945, and &quot;Nathaniel Bacon&quot; which hit a minefield off Civitavecchia, Italy in December 1945, caught fire, was beached, and broke in two.

== Damage ==
The damage that may be caused by a mine depends on the &quot;shock factor value&quot;, a combination of the initial strength of the explosion and of the distance between the target and the detonation. When taken in reference to ship hull plating, the term &quot;Hull Shock Factor&quot; (HSF) is used, while keel damage is termed &quot;Keel Shock Factor&quot; (KSF). If the explosion is directly underneath the keel, then HSF is equal to KSF, but explosions that are not directly underneath the ship will have a lower value of KSF.

=== Direct damage ===
Usually only created by contact mines, direct damage is a hole blown in the ship. Among the crew, fragmentation wounds are the most common form of damage. Flooding typically occurs in one or two main watertight compartments, which can sink smaller ships or disable larger ones. Contact mine damage often occurs at or close to the waterline near the bow, but depending on circumstances a ship could be hit anywhere on its outer hull surface (the mine attack being a good example of a contact mine detonating amidships and underneath the ship).

=== Bubble jet effect ===
The bubble jet effect occurs when a mine or torpedo detonates in the water a short distance away from the targeted ship. The explosion creates a bubble in the water, and due to the difference in pressure, the bubble will collapse from the bottom. The bubble is buoyant, and so it rises towards the surface. If the bubble reaches the surface as it collapses, it can create a pillar of water that can go over a hundred meters into the air (a &quot;columnar plume&quot;). If conditions are right and the bubble collapses onto the ship&#x27;s hull, the damage to the ship can be extremely serious; the collapsing bubble forms a high-energy jet similar to a shaped charge that can break a metre-wide hole straight through the ship, flooding one or more compartments, and is capable of breaking smaller ships apart. The crew in the areas hit by the pillar are usually killed instantly. Other damage is usually limited.

The Baengnyeong incident, in which the ROKS &quot;Cheonan&quot; broke in half and sank off the coast South Korea in 2010, was caused by the bubble jet effect, according to an international investigation.

=== Shock effect ===
If the mine detonates at a distance from the ship, the change in water pressure causes the ship to resonate. This is frequently the most deadly type of explosion, if it is strong enough. The whole ship is dangerously shaken and everything on board is tossed around. Engines rip from their beds, cables from their holders, etc. A badly shaken ship usually sinks quickly, with hundreds, or even thousands of small leaks all over the ship and no way to power the pumps. The crew fare no better, as the violent shaking tosses them around. This shaking is powerful enough to cause disabling injury to knees and other joints in the body, particularly if the affected person stands on surfaces connected directly to the hull (such as steel decks).

The resulting gas cavitation and shock-front-differential over the width of the human body is sufficient to stun or kill divers.

== Countermeasures ==

Weapons are frequently a few steps ahead of countermeasures, and mines are no exception. In this field the British, with their large seagoing navy, have had the bulk of world experience, and most anti-mine developments, such as degaussing and the double-L sweep, were British inventions. When on operational missions, such as the invasion of Iraq, the US still relies on British and Canadian minesweeping services. The US has worked on some innovative mine-hunting countermeasures, such as the use of military dolphins to detect and flag mines. However, they are of questionable effectiveness. Mines in nearshore environments remain a particular challenge. They are small and as technology has developed they can have anechoic coatings, be non-metallic, and oddly shaped to resist detection. Further, oceanic conditions and the sea bottoms of the area of operations can degrade sweeping and hunting efforts. Mining countermeasures are far more expensive and time-consuming than mining operations, and that gap is only growing with new technologies.

=== Passive countermeasures ===
Ships can be designed to be difficult for mines to detect, to avoid detonating them. This is especially true for minesweepers and mine hunters that work in minefields, where a minimal signature outweighs the need for armour and speed. These ships have hulls of glass fibre or wood instead of steel to avoid magnetic signatures. These ships may use special propulsion systems, with low magnetic electric motors, to reduce magnetic signature, and Voith-Schneider propellers, to limit the acoustic signature. They are built with hulls that produce a minimal pressure signature. These measures create other problems. They are expensive, slow, and vulnerable to enemy fire. Many modern ships have a mine-warning sonar—a simple sonar looking forward and warning the crew if it detects possible mines ahead. It is only effective when the ship is moving slowly. 

A steel-hulled ship can be &quot;degaussed&quot; (more correctly, de-oerstedted or depermed) using a special degaussing station that contains many large coils and induces a magnetic field in the hull with alternating current to demagnetize the hull. This is a rather problematic solution, as magnetic compasses need recalibration and all metal objects must be kept in exactly the same place. Ships slowly regain their magnetic field as they travel through the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, so the process has to be repeated every six months.

A simpler variation of this technique called &quot;wiping&quot;, was developed by Charles F. Goodeve which saved time and resources.

Between 1941 and 1943 the US Naval Gun factory (a division of the Naval Ordnance Laboratory) in Washington, D.C., built physical models of all US naval ships. Three kinds of steel were used in shipbuilding: mild steel for bulkheads, a mixture of mild steel and high tensile steel for the hull, and special treatment steel for armor plate. The models were placed within coils which could simulate the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field at any location. The magnetic signatures were measured with degaussing coils. The objective was to reduce the vertical component of the combination of the Earth&#x27;s field and the ship&#x27;s field at the usual depth of German mines. From the measurements, coils were placed and coil currents were determined to minimize the chance of detonation for any ship at any heading at any latitude.

Some ships are built with magnetic inductors, large coils placed along the ship to counter the ship&#x27;s magnetic field. Using magnetic probes in strategic parts of the ship, the strength of the current in the coils can be adjusted to minimize the total magnetic field. This is a heavy and clumsy solution, suited only to small-to-medium-sized ships. Boats typically lack the generators and space for the solution, while the amount of power needed to overcome the magnetic field of a large ship is impractical.

=== Active countermeasures ===
Active countermeasures are ways to clear a path through a minefield or remove it completely. This is one of the most important tasks of any mine warfare flotilla.

==== Mine sweeping ====


A sweep is either a contact sweep, a wire dragged through the water by one or two ships to cut the mooring wire of floating mines, or a distance sweep that mimics a ship to detonate the mines. The sweeps are dragged by minesweepers, either purpose-built military ships or converted trawlers. Each run covers between , and the ships must move slowly in a straight line, making them vulnerable to enemy fire. This was exploited by the Turkish army in the Battle of Gallipoli in 1915, when mobile howitzer batteries prevented the British and French from clearing a way through minefields.

If a contact sweep hits a mine, the wire of the sweep rubs against the mooring wire until it is cut. Sometimes &quot;cutters&quot;, explosive devices to cut the mine&#x27;s wire, are used to lessen the strain on the sweeping wire. Mines cut free are recorded and collected for research or shot with a deck gun.

Minesweepers protect themselves with an oropesa or paravane instead of a second minesweeper. These are torpedo-shaped towed bodies, similar in shape to a Harvey torpedo, that are streamed from the sweeping vessel thus keeping the sweep at a determined depth and position. Some large warships were routinely equipped with paravane sweeps near the bows in case they inadvertently sailed into minefields—the mine would be deflected towards the paravane by the wire instead of towards the ship by its wake. More recently, heavy-lift helicopters have dragged minesweeping sleds, as in the 1991 Persian Gulf War.

The distance sweep mimics the sound and magnetism of a ship and is pulled behind the sweeper. It has floating coils and large underwater &quot;drums&quot;. It is the only sweep effective against bottom mines.

During WWII, RAF Coastal Command used Vickers Wellington bombers Wellington DW.Mk I fitted with degaussing coils to trigger magnetic mines. In a parallel development the Luftwaffe adapted some Junkers 52/3m aircraft to also carry a coil operated by electricity supplied from an onboard generator. The Luftwaffe called this adaption &quot;Minensuch(e)&quot; (lit. mine-search). In both cases pilots were required to fly at low altitude (up to about 200 feet above the sea) and at fairly low speeds to be effective.

Modern influence mines are designed to discriminate against false inputs and are, therefore, much harder to sweep. They often contain inherent anti-sweeping mechanisms. For example, they may be programmed to respond to the unique noise of a particular ship-type, its associated magnetic signature and the typical pressure displacement of such a vessel. As a result, a mine-sweeper must accurately mimic the required target signature to trigger detonation. The task is complicated by the fact that an influence mine may have one or more of a hundred different potential target signatures programmed into it.

Another anti-sweeping mechanism is a ship-counter in the mine fuze. When enabled, this allows detonation only after the mine fuze has been triggered a pre-set number of times. To further complicate matters, influence mines may be programmed to arm themselves (or disarm automatically—known as &quot;self-sterilization&quot;) after a pre-set time. During the pre-set arming delay (which could last days or even weeks) the mine would remain dormant and ignore any target stimulus, whether genuine or false.

When influence mines are laid in an ocean minefield, they may have various combinations of fuze settings configured. For example, some mines (with the acoustic sensor enabled) may become active within three hours of being laid, others (with the acoustic and magnetic sensors enabled) may become active after two weeks but have the ship-counter mechanism set to ignore the first two trigger events, and still others in the same minefield (with the magnetic and pressure sensors enabled) may not become armed until three weeks have passed. Groups of mines within this mine-field may have different target signatures which may or may not overlap. The fuzes on influence mines allow many different permutations, which complicates the clearance process.

Mines with ship-counters, arming delays and highly specific target signatures in mine fuzes can falsely convince a belligerent that a particular area is clear of mines or has been swept effectively because a succession of vessels have already passed through safely.

==== Minehunting ====

As naval mines have become more sophisticated, and able to discriminate between targets, so they have become more difficult to deal with by conventional sweeping. This has given rise to the practice of minehunting. Minehunting is very different from sweeping, although some minehunters, known as mine countermeasures vessels (MCMVs) can do both tasks. Minehunters use specialized high-frequency sonars and high fidelity sidescaning sonar to locate mines, which are then inspected and destroyed either by divers or ROVs (remote controlled unmanned mini-submarines). It is slow, but also the most reliable way to remove mines, as it circumvents most anti-minesweeping countermeasures. Minehunting started during the Second World War, but it was only after the war that it became truly effective.

Sea mammals (mainly the bottlenose dolphin) have been trained to hunt and mark mines, most famously by the U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program. Mine-clearance dolphins were deployed in the Persian Gulf during the Iraq War in 2003. The US Navy claims that these dolphins were effective in helping to clear more than 100 antiship mines and underwater booby traps from Umm Qasr Port.

French naval officer Jacques Yves Cousteau&#x27;s Undersea Research Group was once involved in minehunting operations: They removed or detonated a variety of German mines, but one particularly defusion-resistant batch—equipped with acutely sensitive pressure, magnetic, and acoustic sensors and wired together so that one explosion would trigger the rest—was simply left undisturbed for years until corrosion would (hopefully) disable the mines.
==== Mine running ====
A more drastic method is simply to run a ship through the minefield, letting other ships safely follow the same path. An early example of this was Farragut&#x27;s actions at Mobile Bay during the American Civil War. However, as mine warfare became more developed this method became uneconomical.
This method was revived by the German Imperial German Navy during World War I. Left with a surfeit of idle ships due to the Allied blockade, the Germans introduced a ship known as &quot;Sperrbrecher&quot; (&quot;block breaker&quot;). The type was also used during World War II. Typically an old cargo ship, loaded with cargo that made her less vulnerable to sinking (wood for example), the &quot;Sperrbrecher&quot; was run ahead of the ship to be protected, detonating any mines that might be in their path. The use of &quot;Sperrbrecher&quot; obviated the need to continuous and painstaking sweeping, but the cost was high. Over half the 100 or so ships used as &quot;Sperrbrecher&quot; in WWII were sunk during the war. Alternatively, a shallow draught vessel can be steamed through the minefield at high speed to generate a pressure wave sufficient to trigger mines, with the minesweeper moving fast enough to be sufficiently clear of the pressure wave so that triggered mines do not destroy the ship itself. These techniques are the only way to sweep pressure mines that is publicly known to be employed. The technique can be simply countered by use of a ship-counter, set to allow a certain number of passes before the mine is actually triggered. Modern doctrine calls for ground mines to be hunted rather than swept. A new system is being introduced for sweeping pressure mines, however counters are going to remain a problem.

An updated form of this method is the use of small unmanned ROVs (such as the &quot;Seehund&quot; drone) that simulate the acoustic and magnetic signatures of larger ships and are built to survive exploding mines. Repeated sweeps would be required in case one or more of the mines had its &quot;ship counter&quot; facility enabled i.e. were programmed to ignore the first 2, 3, or even 6 target activations.

==== Counter-mining ====
Another expedient for clearing mines, especially in a hurry, is counter-mining. By this method an explosive is detonated in the area of a known or suspected minefield and the blast either trips off the fuzes or the actual explosive contained within the mine or mines. This latter is known as a sympathetic detonation. Counter-mining is normally used as a last resort or if other equipment is not available. One example was at the entrance to Grand Harbour, Valletta, Malta in WW2 when the British dropped depth charges into the harbour entrance to detonate suspected mines prior to the arrival of an important convoy. It is especially useful against acoustic or pressure mines due to their activation by sound or increases in water pressure.

== National arsenals ==
=== US mines ===
The United States Navy MK56 ASW mine (the oldest still in use by the United States) was developed in 1966. More advanced mines include the MK60 CAPTOR (short for &quot;encapsulated torpedo&quot;), the MK62 and MK63 Quickstrike and the MK67 SLMM (Submarine Launched Mobile Mine). Today, most U.S. naval mines are delivered by aircraft.

MK67 SLMM Submarine Launched Mobile Mine
The SLMM was developed by the United States as a submarine deployed mine for use in areas inaccessible for other mine deployment techniques or for covert mining of hostile environments. The SLMM is a shallow-water mine and is basically a modified Mark 37 torpedo.

MK65 Quickstrike
The Quickstrike is a family of shallow-water aircraft-laid mines used by the United States, primarily against surface craft. The MK65 is a dedicated, purpose-built mine. However, other Quickstrike versions (MK62, MK63, and MK64) are converted general-purpose bombs. These latter three mines are actually a single type of electronic fuze fitted to Mk82, Mk83 and Mk84 air-dropped bombs. Because this latter type of Quickstrike fuze only takes up a small amount of storage space compared to a dedicated sea mine, the air-dropped bomb casings have dual purpose i.e. can be fitted with conventional contact fuzes and dropped on land targets, or have a Quickstrike fuze fitted which converts them into sea mines.

=== Royal Navy ===
According to a statement made to the UK Parliament in 2002:

...the Royal Navy does not have any mine stocks and has not had since 1992. Notwithstanding this, the United Kingdom retains the capability to lay mines and continues research into mine exploitation. Practice mines, used for exercises, continue to be laid in order to retain the necessary skills.

However, a British company (BAE Systems) does manufacture the Stonefish influence mine for export to friendly countries such as Australia, which has both war stock and training versions of Stonefish, in addition to stocks of smaller Italian MN103 Manta mines. The computerised fuze on a Stonefish mine contains acoustic, magnetic and water pressure displacement target detection sensors. Stonefish can be deployed by fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, surface vessels and submarines. An optional kit is available to allow Stonefish to be air-dropped, comprising an aerodynamic tail-fin section and parachute pack to retard the weapon&#x27;s descent. The operating depth of Stonefish ranges between 30 and 200 metres. The mine weighs 990 kilograms and contains a 600 kilogram aluminised PBX explosive warhead.

== Modern mine warfare ==
Mine warfare remains the most cost-effective form of asymmetrical naval warfare. Mines are relatively cheap and being small allows them to be easily deployed. Indeed, with some kinds of mines, trucks and rafts will suffice. At present there are more than 300 different mines available. Some 50 countries currently have mining ability. The number of naval mine producing countries has increased by 75% since 1988. It is also noted that these mines are of an increasing sophistication while even the older type mines present a significant problem. It has been noted that mine warfare may become an issue with terrorist organizations. Mining busy shipping straits and mining shipping harbours remain some of the most serious threats.

<text>Nawal El Moutawakel (Amazigh: ⵏⴰⵡⴰⵍ ⵍⵎⵓⵜⴰⵡⴰⵇⵇⵍ ; ; born 15 April 1962) is a Moroccan former hurdler, who won the inaugural women&#x27;s 400 metres hurdles event at the 1984 Summer Olympics, and is the first Moroccan, Arab, African, and Muslim woman to win an Olympic gold. In 2007, El Moutawakel was named the Minister of Sports in the upcoming cabinet of Morocco.

==Life==
El Moutawakel was born in Casablanca, and was studying at Iowa State University when she won her Olympic title, which came as a surprise in her home country. King Hassan II of Morocco telephoned her to give his congratulations, and he declared that all girls born the day of her victory were to be named in her honor. Her medal also meant the breakthrough for sporting women in Morocco and other mostly Muslim countries.

She was a pioneer for Muslim and African athletes in that she confounded long-held beliefs that women of such backgrounds could not succeed in athletics.

In 1993 she started running for fun, a 5 km run for women in Casablanca that has since become the biggest women&#x27;s race held in a Muslim majority country, with up to 30,000 who came to run.

In 1995, El Moutawakel became a council member of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), now known as World Athletics, and in 1998 she became a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC).

El Moutawakel is a member of the International Olympic Committee, and she was the president of the evaluation commissions for the selection of the host city for the Summer Olympics of 2012 and 2016. Since 2012 she is a vice-president of the IOC.

In 2006, El Moutawakel was one of the eight honored to bear the Olympic flag at the 2006 Winter Olympics Opening Ceremony in Turin, Italy. On 26 July 2012, she carried the London Olympics torch through Westminster.

El Moutawakel was one of the ambassadors of the Morocco 2026 FIFA World Cup bid.

<text>The North Melbourne Football Club, nicknamed the Kangaroos or colloquially the Roos, is a professional Australian rules football club. The men&#x27;s team competes in the Australian Football League (AFL), and the women&#x27;s team in the AFL Women&#x27;s (AFLW). The Kangaroos also field a reserves men&#x27;s team in the Victorian Football League (VFL) and women&#x27;s team in the VFLW.

Founded in the suburb of North Melbourne in 1869 and based at the Arden Street Oval, it is the 4th oldest club in the competition and one of the oldest surviving clubs in the world. Its original home at Arden Street continues to serve as its headquarters, training facilities and home ground for its women&#x27;s side. The club&#x27;s senior men&#x27;s team plays its home matches at Marvel Stadium in the Docklands area of Melbourne, Victoria, as well as Bellerive Oval in Hobart, Tasmania which is also used by the women&#x27;s team as a secondary home ground.

The club&#x27;s mascot is a grey kangaroo wearing the club uniform, and its use dates from the mid-20th century. The club is also unofficially known as &quot;The Shinboners&quot;, a term which dates to its 19th-century abattoir-worker origins. The club&#x27;s motto is , Latin for &quot;victory demands dedication&quot;. Aside from their representation in the AFL, the Kangaroos also field teams in the competitions AFL Women&#x27;s, VFL Women&#x27;s and Victorian Football League competitions.

The Kangaroos have won four VFL/AFL premierships; in 1975, 1977 (after a replay), 1996 and 1999. They have also claimed one AFL Women&#x27;s premiership; in 2024.

==Club history==
===Formative years===

The exact date of founding is not known. The club believes that there were early attempts at formation dating back as far as 1864. An 1865 newspaper article mentions a match between North Melbourne and the South Yarra Football Club. Whether there was continuity between this team and today&#x27;s club or not, no further mentions appear in the mainstream media until 1869.
It is generally believed to have been founded in North Melbourne in 1869 by local cricketers desiring to keep fit over the winter months, however its involvement in the season 1868/1869 implies that it had been formed at the latest the previous year. There is little evidence to support any connection to the North Melbourne Cricket Club except that the two clubs shared some players. Interestingly, while the borough was originally named Hotham, the club didn&#x27;t identify with that name until later and went by the name of North Melbourne Football Club for much of its early history. One thought is that the club was connected to the St Mary&#x27;s Church of England Cricket Club, now the St Mary&#x27;s Anglican Church North Melbourne, whose colours – blue and white – are reflected in the club&#x27;s colours today. The association between the St Mary&#x27;s Church of England Cricket Club and the establishment of the North Melbourne Football Club is believed to have been an informal gathering to play some competitive sport. Information on the club&#x27;s first ever match is limited, but it is known that it took place in Royal Park. James Henry Gardiner is often cited as a founder of the club, though he heavily promoted it in its early years in his role in the local council there is no documented evidence of his role in its formation.

One of the earliest newspaper mentions of it was on 14 August 1869 when it was scheduled to play against Messrs. Walker, May, and Co. at Princes Bridge in what is now central Melbourne. The article mentions that the two teams had already played an earlier match, though it does not say when it does names the team was captained by Fuhrhop, presumably Harry Fuhrhop. Fuhrhop was a Carlton United cricketer who would go on to later captain the football team between 1870 and its 1877 VFA team and, according to historian Gerard Dowling (1973), was a pivotal figure in the early establishment of the club. Other early newspaper reports include the 24th September 1870 against Carlton United at Royal Park (which the paper noted was the second meeting of the season between the two clubs) and 1st October 1870 against East Brunswick.

Royal Park served as the club&#x27;s home ground until 1882.

Regular premiership matches of Australian Football commenced in Victoria in 1870. Although North Melbourne was a part of this, it was classed as a &quot;junior club&quot;. The words junior and senior at the time were not used to distinguish underage side but rather the playing quality and strength of the side. &quot;The Australasian&quot; noted them as being &quot;one of the best of many junior clubs&quot; meaning it the club was considered respectable but far from being regarded a powerhouse as such it would rarely if ever compete against the more notable clubs of the time such as Melbourne, University, Carlton or Geelong and as such was not invited to compete in the Challenge Cup.

The club continued to develop, graduating to senior ranks in 1874, finishing 4th. Along with the promotion, the club adopted its first uniform of blue and white horizontal stripes.

In 1876, North Melbourne disbanded, and many of its player and members joined Albert-park, giving the club such a strong North Melbourne character that many described it as &quot;Albert-park &quot;cum&quot; North Melbourne&quot;. In 1877, the club was re-established as a stand-alone entity, under the name Hotham Football Club and moved to the Hotham Cricket Ground (now Arden Street Oval).

===Association years===
Football took a giant step forward in 1877, with the formation of Victoria&#x27;s first colonial football league, the VFA. Hotham were prime movers in establishing this league and were afforded a place in light of their previous contributions to Australian Football.

The 1880s marked the emergence of the modern identity we now associate with North today. In 1882, the club amalgamated with the Hotham Cricket Club and moved into the North Melbourne Recreation Reserve (Arden St Oval), which remains the home of the club today. The joint venture was aimed at affecting improvements at the Hotham Cricket Ground, which was the name of the Reserve at the time. Four years later the club adopted the traditional uniform of blue and white vertical stripes at the insistence of the VFA, who wanted a visible contrast between Geelong&#x27;s and Hotham&#x27;s uniforms. The third significant development occurred in 1888 with the club returning to its original name of the North Melbourne Football Club. This followed the name of the local area reverting from Hotham to North Melbourne.

The 1880s saw the club develop a penchant for inter-colonial travel with trips to Tasmania (1881/1887) and South Australia (1889). Hotham also found itself well represented at the first ever inter-colonial representative game in 1879 with four players from the club gaining selection for Victoria.

===Disregarded by the VFL===
The VFA grew to 13 senior clubs in the 1890s. Led by Geelong and Essendon, the largest clubs of the VFA formed their own breakaway league, the Victorian Football League (VFL), in 1896. Despite finishing 6th in 1896, North Melbourne was not invited to the breakaway competition. The main reasons for being excluded were:
* North had not won a premiership yet, and thus was not considered a powerful club
* The industrialisation of the locality had drained the club&#x27;s income streams
* The club had a strong reputation for hooliganism from their fans
* There was a lot of bad blood between Collingwood and North following a torrid engagement in the previous season
* Essendon felt threatened by the proximity of North Melbourne
* A court case against the North Melbourne Cricket Club had damaged the Football Club&#x27;s status

North continued on in the depleted VFA, emerging as a powerhouse, finishing 2nd in 1897, 1898 and 1899. In 1903, after 34 years of competing, the club won its first premiership, defeating Richmond in the final. The club became back to back premiers in 1904 after Richmond forfeited the grand final due to the appointment of an umpire whose performance when the two teams met earlier in the year was severely criticised by Richmond players and officials.

North merged with fellow VFA football club West Melbourne in 1907, which at the time had lost its home ground. The joint venture saw a chance of promotion, and the club applied for admission to the more prestigious VFL in 1908, but Richmond and University were admitted instead. North was kicked out of the VFA during the 1907/08 offseason as a result of applying to join the VFL, before the local community reestablished the North Melbourne Football Club under a new committee, successfully enabling the club to play in the VFA in the 1908 season.

===&quot;The Invincibles&quot;===
The reformation of the club necessitated a massive cleanout of the team, leaving only two players remaining from the previous season. The 1910 season was marked by one of the most sensational transfers in Victorian football history, when Andy Curran masterminded the clearance of Carlton&#x27;s famed &quot;Big Four&quot; of &#x27;Mallee&#x27; Johnson, Fred Jinks, Charlie Hammond and Frank &#x27;Silver&#x27; Caine to North Melbourne. These signings secured the Northerners&#x27; third premiership in 1910.

The 1912 finals series was one of the most amazing ever, with the semi-final having to be played three times, after North and Brunswick drew twice. North was eventually victorious and moved on to the final, but lost the game by a mere four points with the last kick of the day.

The next few years were punctuated by &quot;The Invincibles&quot;. In the Northerners&#x27; most illustrious period ever, the club went undefeated from 1914 to 1919, collecting premierships in 1914, 1915 and 1918 – the competition was in recess in 1916 and 1917 due to World War I. As well as this, the club won the championship in both 1915 and 1918 for finishing on top of the ladder, and accounted for VFL side St Kilda comfortably. During this period the club won 58 consecutive matches including 49 successive premiership matches, a record that has remained unmatched in Association or League history since.

Despite being rejected from the VFL in both 1896 and 1907, North persisted in trying to gain admission into the League. On 30 June 1921, North told its players it would disband and try to gain entry to the VFL by the &#x27;back-door&#x27;. Essendon League Football Club had lost its playing ground at East Melbourne and had decided to acquire the North Melbourne Recreation Reserve as a new playing ground. North accepted their proposal in the idea that the clubs would amalgamate. All of North&#x27;s players were urged to join the Essendon League Club to help facilitate the amalgamation. The amalgamation was foiled when some members of the VFA launched a successful legal challenge. As a result, the Essendon League Club moved instead to the Essendon Oval, replacing the ground&#x27;s original occupants, Essendon Association.

North was now without a playing team and the Essendon Association Club was now without a ground, so as a matter of convenience the two clubs amalgamated so they could compete in the 1922 season. As it had after the merger with West Melbourne, North once again managed to avert its destruction. During this Period, North&#x27;s main rivals were Footscray, Meeting them in three Grand Finals.

===Entering the VFL===
After three attempts, 29 years of waiting and numerous other applications to enter the VFL, finally North was rewarded for its persistence with admittance to the League in 1925, along with Footscray and Hawthorn. Even then, the opportunity was almost lost as the League delegates debated into the early hours of the morning on which clubs should be invited to join the intake. It was only after much deliberation that North Melbourne&#x27;s name was eventually substituted for Prahran&#x27;s making North &quot;the lucky side&quot; of the invitees that included Footscray and Hawthorn. North Melbourne was forced to change its uniform to avoid a clash when it joined the VFL.

North Melbourne struggled for most of its first twenty-five years in the VFL, with one of few bright notes being Sel Murray winning the VFL Leading Goalkicker Medal in 1941 with 88 goals. By the late 1940s, North Melbourne had developed a strong list and significant supporter base. In 1949 North secured the VFL Minor Premiership, finishing top of the ladder at the end of the home-and-away season with 14 wins and 5 losses. They failed to make the Grand Final that year (eventually won by Essendon), but in 1950 they did reach the final, but were defeated by Essendon. It was in this year that the club adopted the &quot;Kangaroos&quot; mascot.

In February 1965, North Melbourne moved its playing and training base from the Arden Street Oval to Coburg Oval, signing a seven-year lease with the City of Coburg after initially negotiating long-term leases for up to 40 years. The club came to an arrangement to merge with the VFA&#x27;s Coburg Football Club, whom it was displacing from the ground; fourteen Coburg committeemen joined the North Melbourne committee, but the merger was never completed after Coburg established a rival committee which remained loyal to the VFA. The lease at Coburg lasted only eight months; the Coburg council was hesitant to build a new grandstand without the security of a long-term lease, and neither party made the returns they expected, so it was terminated by mutual agreement in September 1965 and North Melbourne returned to the Arden Street Oval.

Onfield, the 1950s and 1960s were lean years for North Melbourne, though the club did secure two consecutive Night Premierships in 1965 and 1966. Allen Aylett was a brilliant player in the late 1950s and early 1960s (and captain between 1961 and 1964), as was Noel Teasdale, who lost the Brownlow Medal on a countback in 1965 (he was later awarded a retrospective medal when the counting system was amended).

===Golden era===

In the late 1960s, under the leadership of Allen Aylett, North Melbourne began its climb to supremacy. As part of a major recruitment drive North secured the services of several big-name stars, including Barry Davis from Essendon, Doug Wade from Geelong, John Rantall from South Melbourne, and Barry Cable from Perth. In a major coup, the great Ron Barassi was appointed coach in 1973. Barrassi reversed the club&#x27;s playing fortunes, taking a struggling team that was once regarded as the traditional cellar dwellers of the competition through to a golden era of success that transformed North Melbourne into one of the powerhouses of the VFL. Barassi took North to a Grand Final (losing to Richmond by 41 points) in 1974 and brought success in his 1975 and 1977 seasons. North made five consecutive Grand Finals from 1974 to 1978 and defeated Norwood in the 1975 national championship and thus declared Champions of Australia.
In 1973 and 1974, North&#x27;s wingman Keith Greig (recruited from Brunswick Football Club, Victoria) won consecutive Brownlow Medals; forward Malcolm Blight (recruited from Woodville Football Club, South Australia) then won the award in 1978. Doug Wade (recruited from Geelong Football Club, Geelong) won the Coleman Medal in 1974 with his 103 goals for the season.

Barassi remained team coach until 1980, but only a Night Premiership in that year resulted in him leaving Arden Street. North then entered another period of decline, though Malcolm Blight kicked 103 goals to take out the Coleman medal in 1982, and another Brownlow win came through the talented Ross Glendinning in 1983. In that year, North Melbourne won a third Minor Premiership with 16 wins and 6 losses for the season, but they failed to make the Grand Final.

===Team of the 1990s===
Despite the tough, disciplined coaching of the legendary John Kennedy, the 1980s and early 1990s were mostly lean years for the Kangaroos. However, the rebuilding of the club was taking place. The Krakouer brothers (Jim and Phil) brought a spark into the side and lifted many hopes for North supporters and the excitement to the general football public. The innovative idea of night games was instigated by the club and meeting the challenges, the club survived. One major highlight was the recruitment of forward John Longmire in 1989, who topped the club goalkicking over five consecutive seasons (1990–1994) and won the Coleman medal in 1990 with 98 goals. At the beginning of the 1993 season, in a dramatic and controversial move, the board of the club sacked coach and long-time player Wayne Schimmelbusch, and appointed Denis Pagan in his place. Results were immediate, as North reached the finals for the first time in nearly a decade.

Pagan was instrumental in appointing young centre half-forward Wayne Carey as the club&#x27;s youngest-ever captain. Carey had been recruited at the same time as Longmire, but had taken longer to develop as a player. Over the next nine seasons, Carey came to be regarded as the standout player in the league and was known as &#x27;the King&#x27;.

North Melbourne became a powerhouse through the 1990s under Pagan and Carey, and finished in the top four, making the preliminary finals or better, in every season from 1994 until 2000. After being eliminated in the preliminary finals in 1994 and 1995, North went on to defeat the Sydney Swans in the 1996 Grand Final to take out the club&#x27;s third premiership, and the gold centenary AFL cup; Glenn Archer won the Norm Smith Medal. The club was again eliminated in the preliminary final in 1997. In 1998, as the club won both the pre-season Ansett Cup and topped the ladder with 16 wins and 6 losses, but went on to lose the 1998 Grand Final to Adelaide, not helped by an inaccurate goalkicking performance of 8.22 (70) to Adelaide&#x27;s 15.15 (105). In 1999, the Kangaroos finished the regular season in second position on the ladder, and went on to defeat Carlton in the Grand Final, winning the club&#x27;s fourth VFL/AFL premiership; former Sydney midfielder Shannon Grant taking out the Norm Smith Medal. The club was eliminated in the preliminary finals in 2000 against Melbourne.


In 1996, the club was in advanced merger talks with the financially depleted Fitzroy Football Club to create the North Fitzroy Kangaroos Football Club; however, Fitzroy ultimately merged with the Brisbane Bears instead.

Seeking new markets and greater financial security in an increasingly corporatized AFL environment, the title &quot;North Melbourne&quot; was officially dropped from the logo in 1999, during which time the team played only as the &quot;Kangaroos&quot;. During the successful 1999 season, North Melbourne played home games in Sydney with a view of becoming a second team in New South Wales; however, the experiment was not successful, with crowds averaging only 12,000.

===21st century===

North&#x27;s dominance of the league did not continue into the 21st century. Its decade-long on-field potency was in decline, and questions were raised about its financial position and long-term sustainability. Furthermore, three of the people most important to the club&#x27;s success in the 1990s left the club under acrimonious circumstances: CEO Greg Miller left the club, captain Wayne Carey left prior to the 2002 season following an extramarital affair with the wife of teammate and vice captain Anthony Stevens, and coach Denis Pagan was lured to Carlton at the end of 2002. Pagan was replaced by 1996 premiership player Dani Laidley, who had previously been an Assistant Coach at Collingwood from 1999 until the end of season 2002.
On a post-season holiday, several players were caught in the 2002 Bali bombings terrorist attack, notably defender Jason McCartney, who suffered second-degree burns to over 50% of his body while carrying others to safety and nearly died during surgery after being flown back to Melbourne. In what is regarded as one of the most inspirational stories of Australian rules football and Australian sport in general, McCartney successfully returned to action on 6 June 2003 against Richmond at Docklands Stadium. Playing at full-forward, he took a mark in the final quarter, scored a goal from the resulting set shot, and set up Leigh Harding&#x27;s winning goal with two minutes remaining. McCartney retired immediately after the game, citing that his recovery had left him spent, and he was chaired from the ground. McCartney wore the numbers &quot;88&quot; and &quot;202&quot; on the front of his long-sleeved for the match, signifying the Australian and total number of victims of the Bali bombings, while many in the crowd bore signs reading &quot;Bali 88/202&quot;.

Onfield, the club reached the elimination finals in 2002 and 2004.
After a top-4 finish and a preliminary final berth in 2007, and a first-round elimination final exit in 2008, North Melbourne dropped to 13th in 2009, and coach Dani Laidley announced her resignation, with Darren Crocker acting as caretaker coach for the rest of the season, to eventually be replaced by ex-Brisbane Lions premiership player and Collingwood assistant coach Brad Scott. A$15 million redevelopment of the Arden Street, which had started in 2006, was completed in 2009, giving the club top-class training facilities.

===Brad Scott era===
North Melbourne struggled in its first two years under Brad Scott, finishing 9th in both 2010 and 2011. In 2012, the club returned to the finals for the first time since 2008, finishing the season in 8th place, but would go down to the West Coast Eagles by 96 points in an elimination final. In 2012, the club began a three-year deal to play two games each year at Bellerive Oval in Hobart, Tasmania. The club finished 10th in 2013 in a season full of close losses. Nick Dal Santo signed with the club at the end of the 2013 season as a restricted free agent.

In 2014, North Melbourne finished 6th at the end of the home and away season and reached 40,000 members for the first time in the club&#x27;s history.
In September, North Melbourne went on to defeat Essendon by 12 points in the 2nd Elimination Final, only taking the lead in the last quarter. The following week, North Melbourne beat Geelong in the 2nd Semi-final by 6 points advancing them through to their first preliminary final since 2007. Their finals campaign came to a disappointing end at Stadium Australia when they were beaten by Sydney by 71 points. In 2015 the club made history by becoming the first team to qualify for a preliminary final from 8th spot, losing to the West Coast Eagles by 25 points after leading at half time.
In 2016, North Melbourne won its first nine matches, which is the club&#x27;s best start to a season in its VFL/AFL history. On 27 July 2016, the club announced it had surpassed 45,000 members for the first time in the club&#x27;s history. In 2016, the Kangaroos fielded what was the oldest team in AFL history. Unfortunately after the midpoint of the season they fell away and struggled against some of the worst teams in competition. In the mid season of 2019 Brad Scott made the decision to leave NMFC after 10 years at the club taking them to the finals on multiple occasions.

===Rhyce Shaw and David Noble===
Rhyce Shaw took over as caretaker coach in the interim in mid- to late 2019 and was later awarded the position as head coach for the following 2020 season. After a disappointing 2020 season where North won only 3 games and finished second-last, Rhyce Shaw left the club in late October 2020 due to personal issues, bringing his short tenure as head coach to an end.

In 2021, former Western Bulldogs and Adelaide assistant coach and long-time football administrator David Noble was appointed as the new senior coach on an open-ended staff contract. Noble led the club to the wooden spoon in 2021 despite the team producing some encouraging results towards the end of the season and ending with four wins and a draw from the season. Noble resigned from the position in mid-2022 after pressure resulting from North&#x27;s poor start to the season.

===Alastair Clarkson era===

On 19 August 2022, North Melbourne signed Alastair Clarkson to coach the team for five seasons, starting with the 2023 season. 

Clarkson stepped down as the coach of North Melbourne for part of the 2023 season due to him struggling with mental health problems from the racism accusations while he was at the Hawthorn Football Club, however returned toward the end of the season.

==Club symbols and identity==

===Name and mascot===
The club was widely known as the &quot;Shinboners&quot; for much of its early history. The origins of the nickname is believed to come from the areas abattoirs, where a number of the players worked. By 1926, the club was known as the &quot;Blue Birds&quot;, but this nickname did not last. It was Phonse Tobin, North president from 1953 to 1956, who oversaw the club adopting the kangaroo emblem in 1954; Tobin found the image of a shinbone unsavoury and wanted the club to have a mascot it could show with pride. In selecting a new name, he wanted something characteristically Australian and was inspired by a large kangaroo he saw on display outside a city store.

The official name of the club is North Melbourne, but the club has gone under several other aliases over the years. The club was founded as the &quot;North Melbourne Football Club&quot;, but changed to &quot;North Melbourne cum Albert Park&quot; after merging with Albert Park in 1876. Following the reformation of the club in 1877, it was known as the &quot;Hotham Football Club&quot; but later took the name &quot;North Melbourne&quot; again in 1888. In 1998 the club proposed changing its name to the &quot;Northern Kangaroos&quot;, but it was rejected by the AFL. From 1999 to 2007, the club traded without much success as &quot;The Kangaroos&quot; in a bid to increase its appeal nationally; this decision was reversed at the end of 2007 when the club again reverted to the name &quot;North Melbourne&quot;.

===Club song===
&quot;Join in the Chorus&quot; is the official anthem of the North Melbourne Football Club. It is sung to the tune of a Scottish folk song from around 1911, &quot;A Wee Deoch an Doris&quot;.

The song is generally sung, in accordance to common football tradition, after a victory. It is also played before every match.

&quot;Join in the Chorus&quot; is believed to be the oldest club anthem of any AFL club and has been associated with North from its early VFA days. The preamble of the song originates from a score of a theatre musical called &quot;Australia: Heart to Heart and Hand to Hand&quot;, written by Toso Taylor in the 1890s in pre-federation Australia. The second verse is unknown in origin and was presumably added later by members of the club when the song was chosen. The chorus was appropriated from a song written and performed by Scottish musician Harry Lauder. The recording currently used by the club was performed by the Fable Singers in April 1972 and only includes the choruses.

The song has a strong Victorian heritage and has been traditionally sung by the Victorian State Football and Victorian Cricket teams respectively. The lyrics have occasionally been changed, including updating the year in the song (e.g. &quot;North Melbourne will be premiers in 1993&quot;), or to remove the words &quot;North Melbourne&quot; during the period when the club was competing only as the Kangaroos. Following 1993, the players would sing after a win, the last line as &quot;North Melbourne will be premiers just you wait and see.&quot; instead of &quot;..is the team that plays to win for you and me.&quot;

For the 2015 premiership season, You Am I&#x27;s lead singer, Tim Rogers, a North Melbourne supporter, announced that he would assist in an updated version of the song including the two verses. This version is only played at North home games as the team runs onto the ground.

===&quot;Shinboner spirit&quot;===

North Melbourne has a proud history as a working-class, inner-city club. Reflecting the suburb of North Melbourne&#x27;s lower socio-economic status in the 19th and early 20th century, the team has always been one of the smaller and less wealthy clubs, relying on the mateship and grit of its players and membership to succeed.

&#x27;Shinboner spirit&#x27; refers to North&#x27;s reputation of fighting against the odds and not asking for hand-outs. North&#x27;s fans like to compare this to the (generally richer) clubs like Essendon and Carlton, which through their wealthier patronage and corresponding improved player catchments and ability to pay players more, were generally more successful in the pre–salary cap era. The term persists to the modern day despite North Melbourne having switched its official nickname from the Shinboners to the Kangaroos in the 1950s.

Because it relates to the club&#x27;s original nickname, Shinboner spirit is often associated with the complete history of the club. In 2005, to celebrate the club&#x27;s 80th anniversary of senior competition in the VFL and the 30th anniversary of its first VFL premiership, the Kangaroos held a &quot;Shinboner Spirit&quot; gala event attended by almost the entire surviving players. In the awards ceremony, the key Shinboners of the past 80 years were acknowledged, and Glenn Archer was named the &quot;Shinboner of the Century&quot;.

===Guernsey===
The North Melbourne Football Club has a long history of wearing various designs in the colours of royal blue and white.

Most of the club&#x27;s earliest jumpers were long-sleeved and not the sleeveless design common today. In their early years the club sported a hooped design when they took to the field. This changed at the behest of the VFA in 1884 who insisted that Hotham change their jumpers to vertical stripes to provide a visible contrast between Hotham and Geelong.

After 1884 the vertical top was worn more often, usually in the lace-up design in the gallery below.

After the merger with West Melbourne, North used a composite jumper that incorporated West Melbourne&#x27;s red sash for the 1908 season. The merger was in reality, a takeover. The red sash was a token gesture and was removed the following season.

In the early 1920s North experimented with an NMFC monogram design, following League clubs like Carlton and South Melbourne.

Upon promotion to the VFL in 1925, North Melbourne was forced to abandon its royal blue and white striped jumper as it was deemed the jumper design clashed with other clubs. During this period a jumper with a V design was used for several years, before the club returned to using its striped jumper combination of royal blue and white which has been used continuously since 1932.

For 86 seasons, until 2016, the blue stripes were centred, the guernsey had a blue collar and cuffs, and black numbers. Until the 1970s, the numbers were attached to a white panel, while since this point, the top half of the back of the guernsey has been made white to accommodate larger numbers. 

Between 2011 and 2016, North Melbourne wore an inverted version of their guernsey, which was predominantly blue with white numbers, as an alternate uniform. In 2017, this was made the club&#x27;s home jumper and the traditional version was reserved for clashes. However, this was reversed when the club signed a sponsorship deal with German sporting brand Puma, effective from the 2022 season. This saw a return of the traditional guernsey, as well as hooped socks, unused as part of the home uniform since the 1960s. The black player numbers would return in 2023.

In the 1990s, many AFL clubs began to produce alternate uniforms, known in Australian football as &#x27;clash&#x27; guernseys. At Arden Street, this meant the introduction of the &#x27;Bounding Roo&#x27;. Coinciding with a change in marketing by which the club sought to identify more with the &quot;Kangaroos&quot; image, this design included a blue chest with thin stripes extending downwards, onto a large kangaroo. The kangaroo was taken from the club&#x27;s logo, in which it is represented bounding rightward. The guernsey is thus known as the &#x27;Bounding Roo&#x27;. Given its association with the club&#x27;s golden era in the late 1990s, the guernsey is popular among NMFC supporters today. It was used in 2016 to celebrate 20 years since the club&#x27;s third premiership, and in 2019, North&#x27;s 150th anniversary.

===Logo===

North Melbourne has experienced 7 logo changes since its introduction, with 5 of them featuring a bounding kangaroo behind a shield of blue and white stripes. In 2016, North Melbourne introduced a new logo that featured a much fiercer-looking kangaroo—with its head only—sitting on top of the words &#x27;North Melbourne&#x27; inside a shield. The change was generally welcomed. The new kangaroo looks slightly to the right, indicating that it is looking into the future.

==Home ground==

Arden Street Oval was home to the Kangaroos between 1882 and 1985. The oval is currently owned by the City of Melbourne and leased by the North Melbourne Football Club for social, administration and training facilities, and is the site of the club&#x27;s AFL Women&#x27;s, VFL and VFL Women&#x27;s home matches. The grandstands were removed following the conclusion of VFL/AFL matches.

The club has been a home tenant club at Docklands Stadium since 2000, and have also played several home games per season in non-Victorian stadiums. Since 2012, the Kangaroos have played a maximum of four home games each season at Bellerive Oval (known commercially as Ninja Stadium), with the existing deal signed in 2021 and concluding in 2025. From 2025 to at least 2028, the club will play two home games per season in Western Australia, splitting these games between Optus Stadium and Hands Oval in Bunbury.

===Ownership===

`The North Melbourne Football Club is a non-profit organisation limited by guarantee. Members of the club serve as the guarantees of capital and have full voting rights at AGMs to elect directors to the club&#x27;s board.

The club&#x27;s board of directors has nine members, with each director serving a three-year term before their position is put up for re-election at an AGM. Only one-third of the board is contested at each AGM due to the rolling structure of the terms of the directors. This structure safeguards the entire board from being ousted at a single AGM and has made North Melbourne immune to a lot of the in-house fighting witnessed at other AFL football clubs. The board governs the club as well as selecting a chairman to head the club through a majority vote of directors.

North Melbourne is unique in its structure, because from 1986 to 2006 the club was privately owned and limited by shares. The club was floated in 1986 through a membership vote led by then chairman Bob Ansett. At the meeting, members were encouraged to buy into the club by purchasing shares. The float ended up raising over $3 million and helped to keep the club solvent through the next decade.

In 1991, the John Elliott-led Carlton Football Club attempted a hostile take over North Melbourne by purchasing a large parcel of shares formerly owned by Bob Ansett. The Blues acquired 20 per cent of the capital but that stake was eventually bought back in 2001 by John Magowan, the former head of Merrill Lynch Australia. The resulting melodrama saw the formation of B-Class shareholders who had the effective power of veto over any attempt to merge or relocate the club.
Further takeover attempts were made in the first decade of the 21st century by the Southport Sharks. Then chairman Allan Aylett knocked back a proposal from the Sharks that would have seen them gain a majority stake in the club in exchange for an injection of capital. In early 2006, another proposal from Sharks to underwrite the Kangaroos&#x27; games on the Gold Coast, in exchange for a slice of the shareholder structure at the club was knocked back after AFL intervention.

Due to an Australian Taxation Office ruling in 2006, the club proposed a shareholder restructure that would have seen the B Class shareholders power reduced significantly and some voting rights returned to members. This was done to avoid extraordinary taxes being placed on the club, but the move was blocked in December by Bob Ansett and his proxies who feared that the restructure would make the club vulnerable to further takeover bids.

On 28 February 2007, another meeting was called to resolve the shareholder issue. A motion was passed that would return see some voting rights return to members and stop any future tax increments.

In April 2007 it was revealed the AFL was attempting to buy out the shareholders of the club in a bid to gain full ownership, and force a relocation of the club to the Gold Coast.

During October 2007, a group called We Are North Melbourne (WANM) emerged and launched a public campaign, calling for ordinary members to be given the final say on the relocation issue. While the group became synonymous with the push to keep the club in Melbourne, its first priority was to see the club&#x27;s shareholder structure wound-up and control returned to ordinary members.

North Melbourne reverted to public company in November 2008. A moratorium was passed at an extraordinary general meeting that allowed James Brayshaw&#x27;s board to serve unopposed until 2010, so as to allow his ticket the maximum time to enact their policies to make the North Melbourne Football Club financially viable.

On 20 November 2016, former Aussie Rules footballer and Football Federation Australia chairman Ben Buckley replaced James Brayshaw as the new chairman of the club.

In 2022, North Melbourne appointed Jen Watt as CEO, joining President Dr Sonja Hood in the first all-female AFL leadership team.

Previously a club with issues about financial sustainability, North became debt free in 2021 and through to 2023 has posted multiple consecutive surpluses. In 2022, North established the Arden Fund to boost the club&#x27;s long term financial sustainability.

===Night football===
In Round 1,1985, North Melbourne pioneered the concept of playing football on Friday nights. Since then, North Melbourne has played the most Friday night games of any AFL club.

Friday night matches later became the most lucrative timeslot for televised games, and North Melbourne&#x27;s relatively low supporter base resulted in fewer Friday night matches. Between 2010 and 2014, North Melbourne had hosted an annual Friday night match against Carlton in recognition of its pioneering role in the concept.

===Good Friday football===
After years of campaigning to play on Good Friday, the AFL announced on 25 October 2016 that North Melbourne would play the Western Bulldogs on Good Friday in 2017. Good Friday in Australia is a day when people raise money for Melbourne&#x27;s Royal Children&#x27;s Hospital and North Melbourne announced that $5 from each ticket sold would go to the charity. North Melbourne played Essendon on Good Friday on 19 April 2019.

===Indigenous players===
North Melbourne has a strong history of supporting and fostering Aboriginal footballers in the VFL and AFL. The first indigenous footballer to play for the club was Percy Johnson in the 1950s, and was followed by other fan favourites such as Bertie Johnson, Barry Cable and the Krakouer brothers in the following decades.

The following is a list of Indigenous footballers to have played senior football at the club:

==Rivalries==
=== Essendon===
One of the fiercest rivalries in the AFL can be traced back to 1896, when several clubs, including Essendon Football Club, broke away from the Victorian Football Association to form the Victorian Football League. North sought to join the breakaway competition, but some argue this desire was not realised due to Essendon feeling threatened by North&#x27;s proximity and the fact their inclusion could drain Essendon of vital talent. More than 100 years later, some North supporters have not forgiven Essendon for the decision and have blamed the Bombers for their relatively small supporter base and gate revenue. North were finally admitted into the VFL in 1925 alongside Footscray and Hawthorn. In 1950, the two sides met in their first and only grand final meeting to date, which Essendon won by 38 points. The rivalry would flare up again in the 1980s. In 1982, the Krakouer brothers, Jim and Phil, led the Kangaroos to an Elimination Final win. Essendon had their revenge a year later, winning a Preliminary Final by 86 points. The rivalry was re-ignited in the late 1990s and early 2000s due to the on-field success of the two sides. In preparation for the 1998 finals series, and despite losing six of their last eight to the Kangaroos, legendary Essendon coach Kevin Sheedy publicly labelled North executives Greg Miller and Mark Dawson soft in response to comments from commentators that his Essendon team was soft. The Kangaroos beat Essendon in the much-hyped encounter that followed (a Qualifying Final), and North fans pelted Sheedy with marshmallows as he left the ground, although Sheedy was seemingly unfazed by the incident, encouraging a &quot;Marshmallow Game&quot; the next year and relishing in the fact that Sheedy&#x27;s ulterior motive was to build up the game and draw a large crowd, which proved to be correct, drawing in 71,154 people to attend the game. In 2000, the Bombers thrashed North by 125 points. The biggest VFL/AFL comeback of all time occurred between the two teams when Essendon managed to come back from a 69-point deficit to win by 12 points in 2001. A meeting of the two rivals at the MCG in the 2014 AFL finals series in the 2nd Elimination Final resulted in North winning by 12 points, eliminating Essendon from the finals series and extending their drought of years without a finals win.

The rivalry has at times been described as one-sided; in 2020, Essendon player Devon Smith remarked &quot;It&#x27;s a bit of a rivalry built up from them, but for us it&#x27;s another game&quot; given Essendon Football club considers its main rivals to be Carlton, Collingwood and Hawthorn.

=== Hawthorn===
North and Hawthorn have a rivalry that dates back to the 1950s when the two teams competed for the McCaskill Trophy in a series of tough and torrid encounters from 1952 to 1956, the trophy being named after Bob McCaskill who had coached both North and Hawthorn. The rivalry intensified in the 1970s when, after being generally unsuccessful in the first few decades since their entry into the VFL, both clubs became dominant and played against each other in three grand finals in four years. North Melbourne defeated Hawthorn in the 1975 VFL Grand Final by 55 points to win their maiden premiership. However, Hawthorn defeated North Melbourne in the 1976 grand final by 30 points and the 1978 grand final by 18 points. From 1974 to 1978 they played together in 10 finals and the 1976 NFL Night Series final in Adelaide. During the 1980s, Hawthorn dominated North but during the &#x27;90s the results were reversed, including a qualifying final which became the first ever AFL finals match to require extra time, after the scores were level with North Melbourne 12.19 (91) to Hawthorn 13.13 (91) at the end of regular time. North Melbourne dominated extra time, kicking 3.5 to Hawthorn&#x27;s nil and won by 23 points. The rivalry reignited in the 21st century, firstly with an intense semi-final in 2007. Played in front of a crowd of nearly 75,000, the game was noted not only for its physical intensity, but also the flair and attacking ability of both teams&#x27; young playing groups, including a high-flying mark by North forward Aaron Edwards. In 2014 a choking incident involved Brian Lake and North Melbourne forward Drew Petrie, when Lake had Petrie in a choking hold during a match at Docklands Stadium. In 2015 there were several off the ball incidents and fights, including an all-in melee during the first term of their round 5 clash.

===150th-year celebration===

To commemorate the 150th year of the founding of the North Melbourne Football Club, a 150th Year Celebration was organised for the first weekend of August 2019, which commenced with a Friday Night blockbuster against archrivals Hawthorn. Starting from 27 points down in the first quarter, the Kangaroos fought back against the Hawks to triumph as 22-point winners to get the weekend celebrations underway. The following day, the Kangaroos&#x27; VFL side took on Box Hill and won in a similar comeback performance, coming from 31 points down at three-quarter time to win by 2 points. To cap off the weekend, a 150th-Year Celebration Dinner was held at the Melbourne Convention &amp; Exhibition Centre, where the 150 greatest-ever North Melbourne players were announced, with the top-10 greatest North Melbourne players announced on the night from the results of an expert panel.

==Reserves team==

The North Melbourne reserves are the reserves team of the club, playing in the Victorian Football League (VFL).

===History===
North Melbourne competed in the VFL/AFL reserves from 1925 until 1999. During that time, the team won seven premierships − 1947, 1957, 1967, 1978, 1979, 1995 and 1996.

Following the demise of the AFL reserves competition, the standalone reserves team was dissolved, and over the following eighteen years the club entered reserves affiliations with a range of Victorian Football League clubs.

*2000–2002: Murray Kangaroos
*2003–2005: Port Melbourne
*2006–2007: North Ballarat and Tasmania
*2008–2015: North Ballarat and Werribee
*2016–2017: Werribee

In 2018, North Melbourne re-established its own reserves team. The side initially played its home games at Chirnside Park in Werribee until mid-2019, and then at the redeveloped Arden Street Oval since the second half of 2019.

===AFL Women&#x27;s team===
In 2017, following the inaugural AFL Women&#x27;s (AFLW) season, North Melbourne was among eight clubs that applied for licences to enter the competition from 2019 onwards. In September 2017, the club was announced as one of two clubs, along with , to receive a licence to join the competition in 2019. In April 2018, the club announced the signing of midfielder Emma Kearney, who had just won the AFL Women&#x27;s best and fairest and a premiership and club best-and-fairest with the Bulldogs.
The club officially competes as the North Melbourne Tasmanian Kangaroos – often shortened simply to Kangaroos across league publications – due to its ground-sharing arrangement between venues in Victoria and Tasmania.

The team made the grand final in 2023, losing narrowly to Brisbane. In 2024 the club went on a 12-match unbeaten streak, a record for the AFL Women&#x27;s competition (though this includes a draw against Geelong in round two), which culminated in a 30 point premiership victory against Brisbane. Star midfielder Jasmine Garner was awarded the best-on-ground medal for her 35-possession performance.

<doc id="22107" wikidata="Q186444" url="?curid=22107" title="Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons">
<text>The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, commonly known as the Non-Proliferation Treaty or NPT, is an international treaty whose objective is to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology, to promote cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, and to further the goal of achieving nuclear disarmament and general and complete disarmament. Between 1965 and 1968, the treaty was negotiated by the Eighteen Nation Committee on Disarmament, a United Nations-sponsored organization based in Geneva, Switzerland.

Opened for signature in 1968, the treaty entered into force in 1970. As required by the text, after twenty-five years, NPT parties met in May 1995 and agreed to extend the treaty indefinitely. More countries are parties to the NPT than any other arms limitation and disarmament agreement, a testament to the treaty&#x27;s significance. As of August 2016, 191 states have become parties to the treaty, though North Korea, which acceded in 1985 but never came into compliance, announced its withdrawal from the NPT in 2003, following detonation of nuclear devices in violation of core obligations. Four UN member states have never accepted the NPT, three of which possess or are thought to possess nuclear weapons: India, Israel, and Pakistan. In addition, South Sudan, founded in 2011, has not joined.

The treaty defines nuclear-weapon states as those that have built and tested a nuclear explosive device before 1 January 1967; these are the United States (1945), Russia (1949), the United Kingdom (1952), France (1960), and China (1964). Four other states are known or believed to possess nuclear weapons: India, Pakistan, and North Korea have openly tested and declared that they possess nuclear weapons, while Israel is deliberately ambiguous regarding its nuclear weapons status.

The NPT is often seen to be based on a central bargain:

the NPT non-nuclear-weapon states agree never to acquire nuclear weapons and the NPT nuclear-weapon states in exchange agree to share the benefits of peaceful nuclear technology and to pursue nuclear disarmament aimed at the ultimate elimination of their nuclear arsenals. 

The treaty is reviewed every five years in meetings called Review Conferences. Even though the treaty was originally conceived with a limited duration of 25 years, the signing parties decided, by consensus, to unconditionally extend the treaty indefinitely during the Review Conference in New York City on 11 May 1995, in the culmination of U.S. government efforts led by Ambassador Thomas Graham Jr.

At the time the NPT was proposed, there were predictions of 25–30 nuclear weapon states within 20 years. Instead, over forty years later, five states are not parties to the NPT, and they include the only four additional states believed to possess nuclear weapons. Several additional measures have been adopted to strengthen the NPT and the broader nuclear nonproliferation regime and make it difficult for states to acquire the capability to produce nuclear weapons, including the export controls of the Nuclear Suppliers Group and the enhanced verification measures of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Additional Protocol.

Critics argue that the NPT cannot stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons or the motivation to acquire them. They express disappointment with the limited progress on nuclear disarmament, where the five authorized nuclear weapons states still have 13,400 warheads in their combined stockpile. Several high-ranking officials within the United Nations have said that they can do little to stop states using nuclear reactors to produce nuclear weapons.

==Treaty structure==

The NPT consists of a preamble and eleven articles. Although the concept of &quot;pillars&quot; is not expressed anywhere in the NPT, the treaty is nevertheless sometimes interpreted as a &quot;three-pillar&quot; system, with an implicit balance among them:
# &quot;non-proliferation&quot;,
# &quot;disarmament&quot;, and
# &quot;the right to peacefully use nuclear technology&quot;.
These pillars are interrelated and mutually reinforcing. An effective nonproliferation regime whose members comply with their obligations provides an essential foundation for progress on disarmament and makes possible greater cooperation on the peaceful use of nuclear energy. With the right to access the benefits of peaceful nuclear technology comes the responsibility of nonproliferation. Progress on disarmament reinforces efforts to strengthen the nonproliferation regime and to enforce compliance with obligations, thereby also facilitating peaceful nuclear cooperation.
The &quot;pillars&quot; concept has been questioned by some who believe that the NPT is, as its name suggests, principally about nonproliferation, and who worry that &quot;three pillars&quot; language misleadingly implies that the three elements have equivalent importance.

===First pillar: Non-proliferation===
Under Article I of the NPT, nuclear-weapon states pledge not to transfer nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices to any recipient or in any way assist, encourage or induce any non-nuclear-weapon state in the manufacture or acquisition of a nuclear weapon.

Under Article II of the NPT, non-nuclear-weapon states pledge not to acquire or exercise control over nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices and not to seek or receive assistance in the manufacture of such devices.

Under Article III of the Treaty, non-nuclear-weapon states pledge to accept IAEA safeguards to verify that their nuclear activities serve only peaceful purposes.

Five states are recognized by the NPT as nuclear weapon states (NWS): China (signed 1992), France (1992), the Soviet Union (1968; obligations and rights now assumed by the Russian Federation), the United Kingdom (1968), and the United States (1968), which also happen to be the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.

These five NWS agree not to transfer &quot;nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices&quot; and &quot;not in any way to assist, encourage, or induce&quot; a non-nuclear weapon state (NNWS) to acquire nuclear weapons (Article I). NNWS parties to the NPT agree not to &quot;receive&quot;, &quot;manufacture&quot;, or &quot;acquire&quot; nuclear weapons or to &quot;seek or receive any assistance in the manufacture of nuclear weapons&quot; (Article II). NNWS parties also agree to accept safeguards by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to verify that they are not diverting nuclear energy from peaceful uses to nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices (Article III).

The five NWS parties have made undertakings not to use their nuclear weapons against a non-NWS party except in response to a nuclear attack, or a conventional attack in alliance with a Nuclear Weapons State. However, these undertakings have not been incorporated formally into the treaty, and the exact details have varied over time. The U.S. also had nuclear warheads targeted at North Korea, a non-NWS, from 1959 until 1991. The previous United Kingdom Secretary of State for Defence, Geoff Hoon, has also explicitly invoked the possibility of the use of the country&#x27;s nuclear weapons in response to a non-conventional attack by &quot;rogue states&quot;. In January 2006, President Jacques Chirac of France indicated that an incident of state-sponsored terrorism on France could trigger a small-scale nuclear retaliation aimed at destroying the &quot;rogue state&#x27;s&quot; power centers.

Security provided by extended nuclear deterrence (also known as a nuclear umbrella) has been a factor limiting incentives for some NNWS to acquire nuclear weapons.

===Second pillar: Disarmament===
Under Article VI of the NPT, all Parties undertake to pursue good-faith negotiations on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race, to nuclear disarmament, and to general and complete disarmament.

Article VI of the NPT represents the only binding commitment in a multilateral treaty to the goal of disarmament by the nuclear-weapon states. The NPT&#x27;s preamble contains language affirming the desire of treaty signatories to ease international tension and strengthen international trust so as to create someday the conditions for a halt to the production of nuclear weapons, and treaty on general and complete disarmament that liquidates, in particular, nuclear weapons and their delivery vehicles from national arsenals.

The wording of the NPT&#x27;s Article VI arguably imposes only a vague obligation on all NPT signatories to move in the general direction of nuclear and total disarmament, saying, &quot;Each of the Parties to the Treaty undertakes to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament, and on a treaty on general and complete disarmament.&quot; Under this interpretation, Article VI does not strictly require all signatories to actually conclude a disarmament treaty. Rather, it only requires them &quot;to negotiate in good faith&quot;.

On the other hand, some governments, especially non-nuclear-weapon states belonging to the Non-Aligned Movement, have interpreted Article VI&#x27;s language as constituting a formal and specific obligation on the NPT-recognized nuclear-weapon states to disarm themselves of nuclear weapons, and argue that these states have failed to meet their obligation. The International Court of Justice (ICJ), in its advisory opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, issued 8 July 1996, unanimously interprets the text of Article VI as implying that

There exists an obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control.

The ICJ opinion notes that this obligation involves all NPT parties (not just the nuclear weapon states) and does not suggest a specific time frame for nuclear disarmament.

Critics of the NPT-recognized nuclear-weapon states (the United States, Russia, China, France, and the United Kingdom) sometimes argue that what they view as the failure of the NPT-recognized nuclear weapon states to disarm themselves of nuclear weapons, especially in the post–Cold War era, has angered some non-nuclear-weapon NPT signatories of the NPT. Such failure, these critics add, provides justification for the non-nuclear-weapon signatories to quit the NPT and develop their own nuclear arsenals.

Other observers have suggested that the linkage between proliferation and disarmament may also work the other way, i.e., that the failure to resolve proliferation threats in Iran and North Korea, for instance, will cripple the prospects for disarmament. No current nuclear weapons state, the argument goes, would seriously consider eliminating its last nuclear weapons without high confidence that other countries would not acquire them. Some observers have even suggested that the very progress of disarmament by the superpowers—which has led to the elimination of thousands of weapons and delivery systems—could eventually make the possession of nuclear weapons more attractive by increasing the perceived strategic value of a small arsenal. As one U.S. official and NPT expert warned in 2007, &quot;logic suggests that as the number of nuclear weapons decreases, the &#x27;marginal utility&#x27; of a nuclear weapon as an instrument of military power increases. At the extreme, which it is precisely disarmament&#x27;s hope to create, the strategic utility of even one or two nuclear weapons would be huge.&quot;

===Third pillar: Peaceful use of nuclear energy===
NPT Article IV acknowledges the right of all Parties to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and to benefit from international cooperation in this area, in conformity with their nonproliferation obligations. Article IV also encourages such cooperation. This so-called third pillar provides for the transfer of nuclear technology and materials to NPT Parties for peaceful purposes in the development of civilian nuclear energy programs in those countries, subject to IAEA safeguards to demonstrate that their nuclear programs are not being used for the development of nuclear weapons.

As the commercially popular light water reactor nuclear power station uses enriched uranium fuel, it follows that states must be able either to enrich uranium or purchase it on an international market. Mohamed ElBaradei, then Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, has called the spread of enrichment and reprocessing capabilities the &quot;Achilles&#x27; heel&quot; of the nuclear nonproliferation regime. As of 2007, 13 states have an enrichment capability.

During the 1960s and 1970s many states, almost 60, were supplied with research reactors fuelled by weapon grade highly enriched uranium (HEU) through the United States Atoms for Peace program and a similar Soviet Union program. In the 1980s a program to convert HEU research reactors to use low enriched fuel was started in the United States due to proliferation concerns. However 26 states possessed more than 1 kg of civilian HEU in 2015, and as of 2016 the stocks of HEU for civilian research were 60 tonnes, with 74 research reactors still using HEU.

Because the availability of fissile material has long been considered the principal obstacle to, and &quot;pacing element&quot; for, a country&#x27;s nuclear weapons development effort, it was declared a major emphasis of U.S. policy in 2004 to prevent the further spread of uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing (a.k.a. &quot;ENR&quot;) technology. Countries possessing ENR capabilities, it is feared, have what is in effect the option of using this capability to produce fissile material for weapons use on demand, thus giving them what has been termed a &quot;virtual&quot; nuclear weapons program. The degree to which NPT members have a &quot;right&quot; to ENR technology notwithstanding its potentially grave proliferation implications, therefore, is at the cutting edge of policy and legal debates surrounding the meaning of Article IV and its relation to Articles I, II, and III of the treaty.

Countries that have become Parties to the NPT as non-nuclear-weapon States have a strong record of not building nuclear weapons, although some tried and one eventually left the NPT and acquired nuclear weapons. Iraq was found by the IAEA to have violated its safeguards obligations and subject to punitive sanctions by the UN Security Council. North Korea never came into compliance with its NPT safeguards agreement and was cited repeatedly for these violations, and later withdrew from the NPT and tested multiple nuclear devices. Iran was found in non-compliance with its NPT safeguards obligations in an unusual non-consensus decision because it &quot;failed in a number of instances over an extended period of time&quot; to report aspects of its enrichment program.&lt;ref name=&quot;IAEA-GOV/2003/75&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IAEA-GOV/2005/77&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, Romania reported previously undeclared nuclear activities by the former regime and the IAEA reported this non-compliance to the Security Council for information only. Libya pursued a clandestine nuclear weapons program before abandoning it in December 2003. The IAEA reported Syria&#x27;s safeguards non-compliance to the UN Security Council, which did not take action.

In some regions, the fact that all neighbors are verifiably free of nuclear weapons reduces any pressure individual states might feel to build those weapons themselves, even if neighbors are known to have peaceful nuclear energy programs that might otherwise be suspicious. In this, the treaty works as designed.

In 2004, Mohamed ElBaradei said that by some estimates thirty-five to forty states could have the knowledge to develop nuclear weapons.

==Key articles==
&quot;Article I&quot;: Each nuclear-weapons state (NWS) undertakes not to transfer, to any recipient, nuclear weapons, or other nuclear explosive devices, and not to assist any non-nuclear weapon state to manufacture or acquire such weapons or devices.

&quot;Article II&quot;: Each non-NWS party undertakes not to receive, from any source, nuclear weapons, or other nuclear explosive devices; not to manufacture or acquire such weapons or devices; and not to receive any assistance in their manufacture.

&quot;Article III&quot;: Each non-NWS party undertakes to conclude an agreement with the IAEA for the application of its safeguards to all nuclear material in all of the state&#x27;s peaceful nuclear activities and to prevent diversion of such material to nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices.

&quot;Article IV&quot;: 1. Nothing in this Treaty shall be interpreted as affecting the inalienable right of all the Parties to the Treaty to develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without discrimination and in conformity with Articles I and II of this Treaty.

2. All the Parties to the Treaty undertake to facilitate, and have the right to participate in, the fullest possible exchange of equipment, materials and scientific and technological information for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Parties to the Treaty in a position to do so shall also co-operate in contributing alone or together with other States or international organizations to the further development of the applications of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, especially in the territories of non-nuclear-weapon States Party to the Treaty, with due consideration for the needs of the developing areas of the world.

&quot;Article VI&quot;: Each party &quot;undertakes to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament, and on a Treaty on general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control&quot;.

&quot;Article IX&quot;: &quot;For the purposes of this Treaty, a nuclear-weapon State is one which has manufactured and exploded a nuclear weapon or other nuclear explosive device prior to 1 January 1967.&quot;

&quot;Article X&quot;: Establishes the right to withdraw from the Treaty giving 3 months&#x27; notice. It also establishes the duration of the Treaty (25 years before 1995 Extension Initiative).

==History==


The impetus behind the NPT was concern for the safety of a world with many nuclear weapon states. It was recognized that the Cold War deterrent relationship between just the United States and the Soviet Union was fragile. Having more nuclear-weapon states would reduce security for all, multiplying the risks of miscalculation, accidents, unauthorized use of weapons, escalation in tensions, and nuclear conflict. Moreover, since the use of nuclear weapons in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, it has been apparent that the development of nuclear capabilities by States could enable them to divert technology and materials for weapons purposes. Thus, the problem of preventing such diversions became a central issue in discussions on peaceful uses of nuclear energy.

Initial efforts, which began in 1946, to create an international system enabling all States to have access to nuclear technology under appropriate safeguards, were terminated in 1949 without the achievement of this objective, due to serious political differences between the major Powers. By then, both the United States and the former Soviet Union had tested nuclear weapons, and were beginning to build their stockpiles.

In December 1953, US President Dwight D. Eisenhower, in his &quot;Atoms for Peace&quot; proposal, presented to the eighth session of the United Nations General Assembly, urged that an international organization be established to disseminate peaceful nuclear technology, while guarding against development of weapons capabilities in additional countries. His proposal resulted in 1957 in the establishment of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which was charged with the dual responsibility for promotion and control of nuclear technology. IAEA technical activities began in 1958. An interim safeguards system for small nuclear reactors, put in place in 1961, was replaced in 1964 by a system covering larger installations and, over the following years, was expanded to include additional nuclear facilities. In recent years, efforts to strengthen the effectiveness and improve the efficiency of the IAEA safeguards system culminated in the approval of the Model Additional Protocol by the IAEA Board of Governors in May 1997.

Within the framework of the United Nations, the principle of nuclear non-proliferation was addressed in negotiations as early as 1957. The NPT process was launched by Frank Aiken, Irish Minister for External Affairs, in 1958. The NPT gained significant momentum in the early 1960s. The structure of a treaty to uphold nuclear non-proliferation as a norm of international behaviour had become clear by the mid-1960s, and by 1968 final agreement had been reached on a Treaty that would prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, enable cooperation for the peaceful use of nuclear energy, and further the goal of achieving nuclear disarmament. It was opened for signature in 1968, with Finland the first State to sign. Accession became nearly universal after the end of the Cold War and of South African apartheid. In 1992, The People&#x27;s Republic of China and France acceded to the NPT, the last of the five nuclear powers recognized by the treaty to do so.

The treaty provided, in article X, for a conference to be convened 25 years after its entry into force to decide whether the treaty should continue in force indefinitely, or be extended for an additional fixed period or periods. Accordingly, at the NPT Review and Extension Conference in May 1995, state parties to the treaty agreed—without a vote—on the treaty&#x27;s indefinite extension, and decided that review conferences should continue to be held every five years. After Brazil acceded to the NPT in 1998, the only remaining non-nuclear-weapon state which had not signed was Cuba, which joined the NPT (and the Treaty of Tlatelolco NWFZ) in 2002.

Several NPT states parties have given up nuclear weapons or nuclear weapons programs. South Africa undertook a nuclear weapons program, but has since renounced it and acceded to the treaty in 1991 after destroying its small nuclear arsenal; after this, the remaining African countries signed the treaty.

The former Soviet Republics where nuclear weapons had been based, namely Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan, transferred those weapons to Russia and joined the NPT by 1994 following the signature of the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances.

Successor states from the Breakup of Yugoslavia and Dissolution of Czechoslovakia also joined the treaty soon after their independence. Montenegro and East Timor were the last countries to accede to the treaty on their independence in 2006 and 2003; the only other country to accede in the 21st century was Cuba in 2002. The three Micronesian countries in Compact of Free Association with the USA joined the NPT in 1995, along with Vanuatu.

Major South American countries Argentina, Chile, and Brazil joined in 1995 and 1998. Arabian Peninsula countries included Saudi Arabia and Bahrain in 1988, Qatar and Kuwait in 1989, UAE in 1995, and Oman in 1997. The European states of Monaco and Andorra joined in 1995–6. Also acceding in the 1990s were Myanmar in 1992 and Guyana in 1993.

===United States–NATO nuclear weapons sharing===

At the time the treaty was being negotiated, NATO had in place secret nuclear weapons sharing agreements whereby the United States provided nuclear weapons to be deployed by, and stored in, other NATO states. Some argue this is an act of proliferation violating Articles I and II of the treaty. A counter-argument is that the U.S. controlled the weapons in storage within the NATO states, and that no transfer of the weapons or control over them was intended &quot;unless and until a decision were made to go to war, at which the treaty would no longer be controlling&quot;, so there is no breach of the NPT. These agreements were disclosed to a few of the states, including the Soviet Union, negotiating the treaty, but most of the states that signed the NPT in 1968 would not have known about these agreements and interpretations at that time.

As of 2005, it is estimated that the United States still provides about 180 tactical B61 nuclear bombs for use by Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey under these NATO agreements. Many states, and the Non-Aligned Movement, now argue this violates Articles I and II of the treaty, and are applying diplomatic pressure to terminate these agreements. They point out that the pilots and other staff of the &quot;non-nuclear&quot; NATO states practice handling and delivering the U.S. nuclear bombs, and non-U.S. warplanes have been adapted to deliver U.S. nuclear bombs which must have involved the transfer of some technical nuclear weapons information. NATO believes its &quot;nuclear forces continue to play an essential role in war prevention, but their role is now more fundamentally political&quot;.

U.S. nuclear sharing policies were originally designed to help prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons—not least by persuading West Germany not to develop an independent nuclear capability by assuring it that West Germany would be able, in the event of war with the Warsaw Pact, to wield (U.S.) nuclear weapons in self-defense. (Until that point of all-out war, however, the weapons themselves would remain in U.S. hands.) The point was to limit the spread of countries having their own nuclear weapons programs, helping ensure that NATO allies would not choose to go down the proliferation route. (West Germany was discussed in U.S. intelligence estimates for a number of years as being a country with the potential to develop nuclear weapons capabilities of its own if officials in Bonn were not convinced that their defense against the Soviet Union and its allies could otherwise be met.)

===Russia&#x27;s weapon deployment in Belarus===
On 27 February 2022, shortly after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, a referendum was staged in Belarus to remove a constitutional prohibition on basing nuclear weapons on its territory. On 25 June 2022, President of Belarus Lukashenko met Russian President Putin to discuss the deployment of Russian short-range nuclear-capable missiles on the territory of Belarus. The transfer of nuclear warheads would require a further decision, possibly after a number of years, and could be tied to future NATO decisions.

In Belarus, Russia plans to deploy nuclear-capable Iskander-M missile systems. Both conventional and nuclear versions of the missile would be provided under the plans. Additionally, Putin said that he would facilitate the modifications necessary for Belarusian Su-25 bombers to carry nuclear missiles.

On 14 June 2023, president Lukashenko said that Russia had started moving tactical nuclear weapons into Belarus&#x27;s territory. The Russian president had said the weapons were moved &quot;as a deterrence measure&quot; against threats to Russian statehood, and would not be controlled by Belarus. NATO saw no evidence in a change in Russia&#x27;s nuclear position, and in June 2023 Ukrainian intelligence said that not a single warhead had yet been transferred. 

However, by March 2024, reports confirmed that Russian nuclear weapons are now hosted on Belarusian territory. By the end of 2024, president Lukashenko requested the deployment of nuclear-capable, Russian Oreshnik intermediate range ballistic missile; Putin confirmed the possibility of the missiles&#x27; deployment by the end of 2025.

==Non-parties==
Four states—India, Israel, Pakistan, and South Sudan—have never signed the treaty. India and Pakistan have publicly disclosed their nuclear weapon programs, and Israel has a long-standing policy of deliberate ambiguity with regards to its nuclear program (see List of states with nuclear weapons).

===India===
India has detonated nuclear devices, first in 1974 and again in 1998. It is estimated to have enough fissile material for more than 150 warheads and was among the few countries to have a no first use policy, a pledge not to use nuclear weapons unless first attacked by an adversary using nuclear weapons, however India&#x27;s former NSA Shivshankar Menon signaled a significant shift from &quot;no first use&quot; to &quot;no first use against non-nuclear weapon states&quot; in a speech on the occasion of Golden Jubilee celebrations of the National Defence College in New Delhi on 21 October 2010, a doctrine Menon said reflected India&#x27;s &quot;strategic culture, with its emphasis on minimal deterrence&quot;.

India argues that the NPT creates a club of &quot;nuclear haves&quot; and a larger group of &quot;nuclear have-nots&quot; by restricting the legal possession of nuclear weapons to those states that tested them before 1967, but the treaty never explains on what ethical grounds such a distinction is valid. India&#x27;s then External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee said during a visit to Tokyo in 2007: &quot;If India did not sign the NPT, it is not because of its lack of commitment for non-proliferation, but because we consider NPT as a flawed treaty and it did not recognize the need for universal, non-discriminatory verification and treatment.&quot; Although there have been unofficial discussions on creating a South Asian nuclear weapons free zone, including India and Pakistan, this is considered to be highly unlikely for the foreseeable future.

In early March 2006, India and the United States finalized an agreement, in the face of criticism in both countries, to restart cooperation on civilian nuclear technology. Under the deal India has committed to classify 14 of its 22 nuclear power plants as being for civilian use and to place them under IAEA safeguards. Mohamed ElBaradei, then Director General of the IAEA, welcomed the deal by calling India &quot;an important partner in the non-proliferation regime.&quot;

In December 2006, United States Congress approved the United States-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation Act, endorsing a deal that was forged during Prime Minister Manmohan Singh&#x27;s visit to the United States in July 2005 and cemented during President Bush&#x27;s visit to India earlier in 2006. The legislation allows for the transfer of civilian nuclear material to India. Despite its status outside the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, nuclear cooperation with India was permitted on the basis of its clean non-proliferation record, and India&#x27;s need for energy fueled by its rapid industrialization and a billion-plus population.

On 1 August 2008, the IAEA approved the India Safeguards Agreement and on 6 September 2008, India was granted the waiver at the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) meeting held in Vienna, Austria. The consensus was arrived after overcoming misgivings expressed by Austria, Ireland and New Zealand and is an unprecedented step in giving exemption to a country, which has not signed the NPT and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). While India could commence nuclear trade with other willing countries. The U.S. Congress approved this agreement and President Bush signed it on 8 October 2008.

When China announced expanded nuclear cooperation with Pakistan in 2010, proponents of arms control denounced both the deals, claiming that they weakened the NPT by facilitating nuclear programmes in states which are not parties to the NPT.

, Australia, a top three uranium producer and home to world&#x27;s largest known reserves, had continued its refusal to export uranium to India despite diplomatic pressure from India.

In November 2011, Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard announced a desire to allow exports to India, a policy change which was authorized by her party&#x27;s national conference in December. The following month, Gillard overturned Australia&#x27;s long-standing ban on exporting uranium to India. She further said, &quot;We should take a decision in the national interest, a decision about strengthening our strategic partnership with India in this the Asian century,&quot; and said that any agreement to sell uranium to India would include strict safeguards to ensure it would only be used for civilian purposes, and not end up in nuclear weapons.

On 5 September 2014 Tony Abbott, Gillard&#x27;s successor as Australian Prime Minister, sealed a civil nuclear deal to sell uranium to India. &quot;We signed a nuclear cooperation agreement because Australia trusts India to do the right thing in this area, as it has been doing in other areas,&quot; Abbott told reporters after he and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi signed a pact to sell uranium for peaceful power generation.

===Pakistan===
In May 1998, following India&#x27;s nuclear tests earlier that month, Pakistan conducted two sets of nuclear tests, the Chagai-I and Chagai-II. Although there is little confirmed information in public, as of 2015, Pakistan was estimated to have as many as 120 warheads. According to analyses of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the Stimson Center, Pakistan has enough fissile material for 350 warheads.

Pakistani officials argue that the NPT is discriminatory. When asked at a briefing in 2015 whether Islamabad would sign the NPT if Washington requested it, Foreign Secretary Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry was quoted as responding &quot;It is a discriminatory treaty. Pakistan has the right to defend itself, so Pakistan will not sign the NPT. Why should we?&quot; Until 2010, Pakistan had always maintained the position that it would sign the NPT if India did so. In 2010, Pakistan abandoned this historic position and stated that it would join the NPT only as a recognized nuclear-weapon state.

The NSG Guidelines currently rule out nuclear exports by all major suppliers to Pakistan, with very narrow exceptions, since it does not have full-scope IAEA safeguards (i.e. safeguards on all its nuclear activities). Pakistan has sought to reach an agreement similar to that with India, but these efforts have been rebuffed by the United States and other NSG members, on the grounds that Pakistan&#x27;s track record as a nuclear proliferator makes it impossible for it to have any sort of nuclear deal in the near future.

By 2010, China reportedly signed a civil nuclear agreement with Pakistan, using the justification that the deal was &quot;peaceful&quot;. The British government criticized this, on the grounds that &#x27;the time is not yet right for a civil nuclear deal with Pakistan&#x27;. China did not seek formal approval from the nuclear suppliers group, and claimed instead that its cooperation with Pakistan was &quot;grandfathered&quot; when China joined the NSG, a claim that was disputed by other NSG members. Pakistan applied for membership on 19 May 2016, supported by Turkey and China However, many NSG members opposed Pakistan&#x27;s membership bid due to its track record, including the illicit procurement network of Pakistani scientist A.Q. Khan, which aided the nuclear programs of Iran, Libya and North Korea. Pakistani officials reiterated the request in August 2016.

===Israel===
Israel has a long-standing policy of deliberate ambiguity with regards to its nuclear program (see List of countries with nuclear weapons). Israel has been developing nuclear technology at its Dimona site in the Negev since 1958, and some nonproliferation analysts estimate that Israel may have stockpiled between 100 and 200 warheads using reprocessed plutonium. The position on the NPT is explained in terms of &quot;Israeli exceptionality&quot;, a term coined by Professor Gerald M. Steinberg, in reference to the perception that the country&#x27;s small size, overall vulnerability, as well as the history of deep hostility and large-scale attacks by neighboring states, require a deterrent capability.

The Israeli government refuses to confirm or deny possession of nuclear weapons, although this is now regarded as an open secret after Israeli junior nuclear technician Mordechai Vanunu—subsequently arrested and sentenced for treason by Israel—published evidence about the program to the British &quot;Sunday Times&quot; in 1986.

On 18 September 2009, the General Conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency called on Israel to open its nuclear facilities to IAEA inspection and adhere to the non-proliferation treaty as part of a resolution on &quot;Israeli nuclear capabilities&quot;, which passed by a narrow margin of 49–45 with 16 abstentions. The chief Israeli delegate stated that &quot;Israel will not co-operate in any matter with this resolution.&quot; However, similar resolutions were defeated in 2010, 2013, 2014, and 2015. As with Pakistan, the NSG Guidelines currently rule out nuclear exports by all major suppliers to Israel.

==Other states==
===North Korea===

North Korea acceded to the treaty on 12 December 1985 in order to obtain assistance from the Soviet Union in the construction of four light-water reactors, but was found to be in noncompliance with its IAEA safeguards agreement after a series of inspections in 1992-93 which determined that North Korea had not fully declared its history of reprocessing spent fuel at the Yongbyon nuclear facility. North Korea responded by announcing its intent to withdraw from the treaty on 12 March 1993, and President Bill Clinton responded by announcing sanctions and considering military action. The crisis ended with the Agreed Framework negotiated by former US President Jimmy Carter in which North Korea agreed to an IAEA-monitored freeze of plutonium production facilities and construction of new reactors in exchange for two light-water reactors and heavy fuel oil shipments through the US-led Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization consortium. North Korea also abandoned its withdrawal from the NPT.

During the late 1990s and the early 2000s critics of the agreement, as well as Clinton&#x27;s successor George W. Bush, expressed skepticism on North Korean compliance to the Agreed Framework. During 2002 negotiations US Assistant Secretary of State James A. Kelly accused North Korea of a secret highly enriched uranium program; North Korean First Vice Foreign Minister Kang Sok-ju and Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye-gwan responded by denying the allegations but asserting that North Korea had a right to nuclear weapons. The U.S. subsequently halted fuel oil shipments to North Korea in December 2002 and the DPRK government again gave notice of withdrawal from NPT on 10 January 2003. The withdrawal became effective 10 April 2003 making North Korea the first state ever to withdraw from the treaty.

In April 2003, North Korea agreed to the multilateral six-party talks to find a diplomatic solution to the issue hosted by China and including the United States, South Korea, Russia, and Japan. North Korea initially demanded resumption of fuel shipments, while the United States demanded the &quot;complete, verifiable, and irreversible dismantlement&quot; of the North Korean nuclear program. On 10 February 2005, North Korea publicly declared that it possessed nuclear weapons and pulled out of the six-party talks. &quot;We had already taken the resolute action of pulling out of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and have manufactured nuclear arms for self-defence to cope with the Bush administration&#x27;s evermore undisguised policy to isolate and stifle the DPRK [Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea],&quot; a North Korean Foreign Ministry statement said regarding the issue. Six-party talks resumed in July 2005.

On 19 September 2005, North Korea announced that it would agree to a preliminary accord. Under the accord, North Korea would scrap all of its existing nuclear weapons and nuclear production facilities, rejoin the NPT, and readmit IAEA inspectors. The difficult issue of the supply of light water reactors to replace North Korea&#x27;s indigenous nuclear power plant program, as per the 1994 Agreed Framework, was left to be resolved in future discussions. On the next day North Korea reiterated its known view that until it is supplied with a light water reactor it will not dismantle its nuclear arsenal or rejoin the NPT. The six-party talks eventually collapsed before a final agreement could be negotiated after the U.S. State Department sanctioned Banco Delta Asia under Section 311 of the Patriot Act for money-laundering involving North Korean accounts.

On 2 October 2006, the North Korean foreign minister announced that his country was planning to conduct a nuclear test &quot;in the future&quot;, although it did not state when. On Monday, 9 October 2006 at 01:35:28 (UTC) the United States Geological Survey detected a magnitude 4.3 seismic event north of Kimchaek, North Korea indicating a nuclear test. The North Korean government announced shortly afterward that they had completed a successful underground test of a nuclear fission device. After United Nations Security Council Resolution 1718 imposed sanctions on North Korea, the six-party talks resumed. In February 2007 the parties agreed to the Initial Actions for the Implementation for the Joint Statement in which North Korea would dismantle its nuclear weapons programs, including the Yongbyon reactor, in exchange for the return of frozen funds at Banco Delta Asia and foreign energy assistance. However, the agreement failed due to verification problems and North Korea fully withdrew from the six-party talks in 2009 after the other members condemned the 2009 North Korean missile tests, expelling all US and IAEA inspectors from the country. The UN responded by adopting United Nations Security Council Resolution 1874 expanding the sanctions regime.

In 2007, reports from Washington suggested that the 2002 CIA reports stating that North Korea was developing an enriched uranium weapons program, which led to North Korea leaving the NPT, had overstated or misread the intelligence. On the other hand, even apart from these press allegations, there remains some information in the public record indicating the existence of a uranium effort. Quite apart from the fact that North Korean First Vice Minister Kang Sok-ju at one point admitted the existence of a uranium enrichment program, Pakistan&#x27;s then-President Musharraf revealed that the A.Q. Khan proliferation network had provided North Korea with a number of gas centrifuges designed for uranium enrichment. Additionally, press reports have cited U.S. officials to the effect that evidence obtained in dismantling Libya&#x27;s WMD programs points toward North Korea as the source for Libya&#x27;s uranium hexafluoride (UF6)—which, if true, would mean that North Korea has a uranium conversion facility for producing feedstock for centrifuge enrichment. North Korea formally announced the existence of a uranium enrichment program in September 2009.

In 2011, after rising tensions over the North Korean nuclear program, the ROKS &quot;Cheonan&quot; sinking, and the bombardment of Yeonpyeong, North Korea began to express interest in returning to the six-party talks. Bilateral negotiations between North Korea and the United States after the death of Kim Jong-il led to the 29 February 2012 &quot;Leap Day Agreement&quot; in which North Korea would agree to allow IAEA inspections and resume the six-party talks. However, these diplomatic gains were quickly undercut by launching the Unha-3 rocket, leading the United States to suspend food aid. North Korea conducted further nuclear tests in 2013, January 2016, September 2016, and 2017, and announced that it was developing miniaturized warheads and intercontinental ballistic missiles. It also claimed that it had successfully detonated thermonuclear weapons in the January 2016 and 2017 tests. The North Korean nuclear weapons development led to the 2017–2018 North Korea crisis which nearly led to war, with both North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump threatening military action. The crisis was averted after a series of meetings between Kim Jong-un, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and South Korean President Moon Jae-in finally culminating with the 2018 North Korea–United States Singapore Summit between Trump and Kim, the first face-to-face meeting between the US and North Korean heads of state. The IAEA has called for North Korea to rejoin it and the NPT since 2013.

===Iran===

Iran is a party to the NPT since 1970 but was found in non-compliance with its NPT safeguards agreement, and the status of its nuclear program remains in dispute. In November 2003 IAEA Director General Mohamed ElBaradei reported that Iran had repeatedly and over an extended period failed to meet its safeguards obligations under the NPT with respect to:
* reporting of nuclear material imported to Iran;
* reporting of the subsequent processing and use of imported nuclear material;
* declaring of facilities and other locations where nuclear material had been stored and processed.
After about two years of EU3-led diplomatic efforts and Iran temporarily suspending its enrichment program, the IAEA Board of Governors, acting under Article XII.C of the IAEA Statute, found in a rare non-consensus decision with 12 abstentions that these failures constituted non-compliance with the IAEA safeguards agreement. This was reported to the UN Security Council in 2006, after which the Security Council passed a resolution demanding that Iran suspend its enrichment.
Instead, Iran resumed its enrichment program.

The IAEA has been able to verify the non-diversion of declared nuclear material in Iran, and is continuing its work on verifying the absence of undeclared activities. In February 2008, the IAEA also reported that it was working to address &quot;alleged studies&quot; of weaponization, based on documents provided by certain Member States, which those states claimed originated from Iran. Iran rejected the allegations as &quot;baseless&quot; and the documents as &quot;fabrications&quot;. In June 2009, the IAEA reported that Iran had not &quot;cooperated with the Agency in connection with the remaining issues ... which need to be clarified to exclude the possibility of military dimensions to Iran&#x27;s nuclear program.&quot;

The United States concluded that Iran violated its Article III NPT safeguards obligations, and further argued based on circumstantial evidence that Iran&#x27;s enrichment program was for weapons purposes and therefore violated Iran&#x27;s Article II nonproliferation obligations. The November 2007 US National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) later concluded that Iran had halted an active nuclear weapons program in the fall of 2003 and that it had remained halted as of mid-2007. The NIE&#x27;s &quot;Key Judgments&quot;, however, also made clear that what Iran had actually stopped in 2003 was only &quot;nuclear weapon design and weaponization work and covert uranium conversion-related and uranium enrichment-related work&quot;-namely, those aspects of Iran&#x27;s nuclear weapons effort that had not by that point already been leaked to the press and become the subject of IAEA investigations.

Since Iran&#x27;s uranium enrichment program at Natanz—and its continuing work on a heavy water reactor at Arak that would be ideal for plutonium production—began secretly years before in conjunction with the very weaponization work the NIE discussed and for the purpose of developing nuclear weapons, many observers find Iran&#x27;s continued development of fissile material production capabilities distinctly worrying. Particularly because fissile material availability has long been understood to be the principal obstacle to nuclear weapons development and the primary &quot;pacing element&quot; for a weapons program, the fact that Iran has reportedly suspended weaponization work may not mean very much. As The Bush Administration&#x27;s Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Mike McConnell put it in 2008, the aspects of its work that Iran allegedly suspended were thus &quot;probably the least significant part of the program.&quot;

Iran stated it has a legal right to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes under the NPT, and further says that it had &quot;constantly complied with its obligations under the NPT and the Statute of the International Atomic Energy Agency&quot;. Iran also stated that its enrichment program has been part of its civilian nuclear energy program, which is allowed under Article IV of the NPT. The Non-Aligned Movement has welcomed the continuing cooperation of Iran with the IAEA and reaffirmed Iran&#x27;s right to the peaceful uses of nuclear technology.

Early during his tenure as United Nations Secretary General, between 2007 and 2016, Ban Ki-moon welcomed the continued dialogue between Iran and the IAEA. He urged a peaceful resolution of the issue.

In April 2010, during the signing of the U.S.-Russia New START Treaty, President Obama said that the United States, Russia, and other nations were demanding that Iran face consequences for failing to fulfill its obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, saying &quot;We will not tolerate actions that flout the NPT, risk an arms race in a vital region, and threaten the credibility of the international community and our collective security.&quot;

In 2015, Iran negotiated a nuclear deal with the P5+1, a group of countries that consisted of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States) plus Germany. On 14 July 2015, the P5+1 and Iran concluded the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, lifting sanctions on Iran in exchange for constraints and on Iran&#x27;s nuclear activities and increased verification by the IAEA. On 8 May 2018, President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the JCPOA and reimposed sanctions on Iran.

===South Africa===
South Africa is the only country that developed nuclear weapons by itself and later dismantled them—unlike the former Soviet states Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan, which inherited nuclear weapons from the former USSR and also acceded to the NPT as non-nuclear weapon states.

During the days of apartheid, the South African government developed a deep fear of both a black uprising and the threat of communism. This led to the development of a secret nuclear weapons program as an ultimate deterrent. South Africa has a large supply of uranium, which is mined in the country&#x27;s gold mines. The government built a nuclear research facility at Pelindaba near Pretoria where uranium was enriched to fuel grade for the Koeberg Nuclear Power Station as well as weapon grade for bomb production.

In 1991, after international pressure and when a change of government was imminent, South African Ambassador to the United States Harry Schwarz signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. In 1993, the then president Frederik Willem de Klerk openly admitted that the country had developed a limited nuclear weapon capability. These weapons were subsequently dismantled before South Africa acceded to the NPT and opened itself up to IAEA inspection. In 1994, the IAEA completed its work and declared that the country had fully dismantled its nuclear weapons program.

===Libya===

Libya had signed (in 1968) and ratified (in 1975) the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and was subject to IAEA nuclear safeguards inspections, but undertook a secret nuclear weapons development program in violation of its NPT obligations, using material and technology provided by the A.Q. Khan proliferation network—including actual nuclear weapons designs allegedly originating in China. Libya began secret negotiations with the United States and the United Kingdom in March 2003 over potentially eliminating its WMD programs. In October 2003, Libya was embarrassed by the interdiction of a shipment of Pakistani-designed centrifuge parts sent from Malaysia, also as part of A. Q. Khan&#x27;s proliferation ring.

In December 2003, Libya announced that it had agreed to eliminate all its WMD programs, and permitted U.S. and British teams (as well as IAEA inspectors) into the country to assist this process and verify its completion. The nuclear weapons designs, gas centrifuges for uranium enrichment, and other equipment—including prototypes for improved SCUD ballistic missiles—were removed from Libya by the United States. (Libyan chemical weapons stocks and chemical bombs were also destroyed on site with international verification, with Libya joining the Chemical Weapons Convention.) Libya&#x27;s non-compliance with its IAEA safeguards was reported to the U.N. Security Council, but with no action taken, as Libya&#x27;s return to compliance with safeguards and Article II of the NPT was welcomed.

In 2011, the Libyan government of Muammar al-Gaddafi was overthrown in the Libyan Civil War with the assistance of a military intervention by NATO forces acting under the auspices of UN Security Council Resolution 1973. Gaddafi&#x27;s downfall 8 years after the disarmament of Libya, in which Gaddafi agreed to eliminate Libya&#x27;s nuclear weapons program, has been repeatedly cited by North Korea, which views Gaddafi&#x27;s fate as a &quot;cautionary tale&quot; that influences North Korea&#x27;s decision to maintain and intensify its nuclear weapons program and arsenal despite pressure to denuclearize.

===Syria===

Syria is a state party to the NPT since 1969 and has a limited civil nuclear program. Before the advent of the Syrian Civil War it was known to operate only one small Chinese-built research reactor, SRR-1. Despite being a proponent of a Weapons of Mass Destruction Free Zone in the Middle East the country was accused of pursuing a military nuclear program with a reported nuclear facility in a desert Deir ez-Zor Governorate. The reactor&#x27;s components had likely been designed and manufactured in North Korea, with the reactor&#x27;s striking similarity in shape and size to the North Korean Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center. That information alarmed Israeli military and intelligence to such a degree that the idea of a targeted airstrike was conceived. It resulted in Operation Orchard, that took place on 6 September 2007 and saw as many as eight Israeli Air Force aircraft taking part. The Israeli government is said to have bounced the idea of the operation off of the US Bush administration, although the latter declined to participate. The nuclear reactor was destroyed in the attack, which also killed about ten North Korean workers. The attack did not cause an international outcry or any serious Syrian retaliatory moves as both parties tried to keep it secret: Despite a half-century state of war declared by surrounding states, Israel did not want publicity as regards its breach of the ceasefire, while Syria was not willing to acknowledge its clandestine nuclear program.

===Ukraine===

Ukraine acceded to the NPT in 1994 as a non-nuclear-weapon state, and committed to remove all nuclear weapons from its territory. In recognition of Ukraine&#x27;s decision, the UK, the United States and Russia provided security assurances to Ukraine under the Budapest Memorandum of 1994.

In 1993, political scientist John Mearsheimer argued that the United States should encourage Ukraine to retain a nuclear deterrent against potential Russian expansion, and to reduce the danger of war. After the Russian invasion of 2014 Andreas Umland, an analyst from the Swedish Institute of International Affairs, argued that Ukraine had been unwise to give up its arsenal, as Russia breaking the treaty only had limited consequences, and demonstrated that only a nuclear arsenal guarantees a country&#x27;s sovereignty in the face of aggression from a nuclear power. However, Mariana Budjeryn of Harvard Kennedy School&#x27;s Belfer Center, argued that it was unclear whether Ukraine&#x27;s nuclear arsenal would have kept it safe from Russian aggression. Establishing operative control and maintaining the missiles would have been challenging for Ukraine, which might have faced sanctions had it refused to give up its arsenal.

==Leaving the treaty==
Article X allows a state to leave the treaty if &quot;extraordinary events, related to the subject matter of this Treaty, have jeopardized the supreme interests of its country&quot;, giving three months&#x27; (ninety days&#x27;) notice. The state is required to give reasons for leaving the NPT in this notice.

NATO states argue that when there is a state of &quot;general war&quot; the treaty no longer applies, effectively allowing the states involved to leave the treaty with no notice. This is a necessary argument to support the NATO nuclear weapons sharing policy. NATO&#x27;s argument is based on the phrase &quot;the consequent need to make every effort to avert the danger of such a war&quot; in the treaty preamble, inserted at the behest of U.S. diplomats, arguing that the treaty would at that point have failed to fulfill its function of prohibiting a general war and thus no longer be binding. See United States–NATO nuclear weapons sharing above.

North Korea has also caused an uproar by its use of this provision of the treaty. Article X.1 only requires a state to give three months&#x27; notice in total, and does not provide for other states to question a state&#x27;s interpretation of &quot;supreme interests of its country&quot;. In 1993, North Korea gave notice to withdraw from the NPT. However, after 89 days, North Korea reached agreement with the United States to freeze its nuclear program under the Agreed Framework and &quot;suspended&quot; its withdrawal notice. In October 2002, the United States accused North Korea of violating the Agreed Framework by pursuing a secret uranium enrichment program, and suspended shipments of heavy fuel oil under that agreement. In response, North Korea expelled IAEA inspectors, disabled IAEA equipment, and, on 10 January 2003, announced that it was ending the suspension of its previous NPT withdrawal notification. North Korea said that only one more day&#x27;s notice was sufficient for withdrawal from the NPT, as it had given 89 days before.

The IAEA Board of Governors rejected this interpretation. Most countries held that a new three-months withdrawal notice was required, and some questioned whether North Korea&#x27;s notification met the &quot;extraordinary events&quot; and &quot;supreme interests&quot; requirements of the treaty. The Joint Statement of 19 September 2005 at the end of the Fourth Round of the Six-Party Talks called for North Korea to &quot;return&quot; to the NPT, implicitly acknowledging that it had withdrawn.

==Recent and coming events==

The main outcome of the 2000 Conference was the adoption by consensus of a comprehensive Final Document, which included among other things &quot;practical steps for the systematic and progressive efforts&quot; to implement the disarmament provisions of the NPT, commonly referred to as the Thirteen Steps.

On 18 July 2005, US President George W. Bush met Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and declared that he would work to change US law and international rules to permit trade in US civilian nuclear technology with India. At the time, British columnist George Monbiot argued that the U.S.-India nuclear deal, in combination with US attempts to deny Iran (an NPT signatory) civilian nuclear fuel-making technology, might destroy the NPT regime.

In the first half of 2010, it was strongly believed that China had signed a civilian nuclear deal with Pakistan claiming that the deal was &quot;peaceful&quot;.

Arms control advocates criticised the reported China-Pakistan deal as they did in case of U.S.-India deal claiming that both the deals violate the NPT by facilitating nuclear programmes in states which are not parties to the NPT. Some reports asserted that the deal was a strategic move by China to balance US influence in South-Asia.

According to a report published by U.S. Department of Defense in 2001, China had provided Pakistan with nuclear materials and has given critical technological assistance in the construction of Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear weapons development facilities, in violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, of which China even then was a signatory.

At the Seventh Review Conference in May 2005, there were stark differences between the United States, which wanted the conference to focus on non-proliferation, especially on its allegations against Iran, and most other countries, who emphasized the lack of serious nuclear disarmament by the nuclear powers. The non-aligned countries reiterated their position emphasizing the need for nuclear disarmament.

The 2010 Review Conference was held in May 2010 in New York City, and adopted a final document that included a summary by the Review Conference President, Ambassador Libran Capactulan of the Philippines, and an Action Plan that was adopted by consensus. The 2010 conference was generally considered a success because it reached consensus where the previous Review Conference in 2005 ended in disarray. Many attributed the success of the 2010 conference to U.S. President Barack Obama&#x27;s commitment to nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament. Some have warned that this success raised unrealistically high expectations that could lead to failure at the next Review Conference in 2015.
The &quot;Global Summit on Nuclear Security&quot; took place 12–13 April 2010. The summit was proposed by President Obama in Prague and was intended to strengthen the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in conjunction with the Proliferation Security Initiative and the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism. Forty seven states and three international organizations took part in the summit, which issued a communiqué and a work plan. For further information see 2010 Nuclear Security Summit.
In a major policy speech at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin on 19 June 2013, Obama outlined plans to further reduce the number of warheads in the U.S. nuclear arsenal. According to &quot;Foreign Policy&quot;, Obama proposed a &quot;one-third reduction in strategic nuclear warheads—on top of the cuts already required by the New START treaty—bringing the number of deployed warheads to about 1,000&quot;. Obama is seeking to &quot;negotiate these reductions with Russia to continue to move beyond Cold War nuclear postures,&quot; according to briefing documents provided to &quot;Foreign Policy&quot;. In the same speech, Obama emphasized his administration&#x27;s efforts to isolate any nuclear weapons capabilities emanating from Iran and North Korea. He also called for a renewed bipartisan effort in the United States Congress to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and called on countries to negotiate a new treaty to end the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons.

On 24 April 2014, it was announced that the nation of the Marshall Islands has brought suit in The Hague against the United States, the former Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel seeking to have the disarmament provisions of the NPT enforced.

The 2015 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) was held at the United Nations in New York from 27 April to 22 May 2015 and presided over by Ambassador Taous Feroukhi of Algeria. The Treaty, particularly article VIII, paragraph 3, envisages a review of the operation of the Treaty every five years, a provision which was reaffirmed by the States parties at the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference and the 2000 NPT Review Conference. At the 2015 NPT Review Conference, States parties examined the implementation of the Treaty&#x27;s provisions since 2010. Despite intensive consultations, the Conference was not able to reach agreement on the substantive part of the draft Final Document.

The Tenth Review Conference convened 1–26 August 2022, after a two-year postponement due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and concluded without adopting a final document. Contentious negotiations came close to consensus on a text, but ultimately Russia blocked consensus over issues related to its invasion of Ukraine, including references to the safety of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in the draft text.

On June 23, 2023, The US Department of State issued a statement that the United States hosted the meeting on June 13–14 in Cairo among the five nuclear weapons states, describing it as &quot;an ongoing exchange in the context of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).&quot;

==Criticism and responses==
Over the years the NPT has come to be seen by many Third World states as &quot;a conspiracy of the nuclear &#x27;haves&#x27; to keep the nuclear &#x27;have-nots&#x27; in their place&quot;. This argument has roots in Article VI of the treaty which &quot;obligates the nuclear weapons states to liquidate their nuclear stockpiles and pursue complete disarmament. The non-nuclear states see no signs of this happening&quot;. Some argue that the NWS have not fully complied with their disarmament obligations under Article VI of the NPT. Some countries such as India have criticized the NPT, because it &quot;discriminated against states not possessing nuclear weapons on 1 January 1967,&quot; while Iran and numerous Arab states have criticized Israel for not signing the NPT. There has been disappointment with the limited progress on nuclear disarmament, where the five authorized nuclear weapons states still have 13,400 warheads (as of February 2021) among them.

As noted above, the International Court of Justice, in its advisory opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, stated that &quot;there exists an obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control&quot;. Some critics of the nuclear-weapons states contend that they have failed to comply with Article VI by failing to make disarmament the driving force in national planning and policy with respect to nuclear weapons, even while they ask other states to plan for their security without nuclear weapons.

The United States responds to criticism of its disarmament record by pointing out that, since the end of the Cold War, it has eliminated over 13,000 nuclear weapons, and eliminated over 80% of its deployed strategic warheads and 90% of non-strategic warheads deployed to NATO, in the process eliminating whole categories of warheads and delivery systems and reducing its reliance on nuclear weapons. U.S. officials have also pointed out the ongoing U.S. work to dismantle nuclear warheads. By the time accelerated dismantlement efforts ordered by President George W. Bush were completed, the U.S. arsenal was less than a quarter of its size at the end of the Cold War, and smaller than it had been at any point since the Eisenhower administration, well before the drafting of the NPT.

The United States has also purchased many thousands of weapons&#x27; worth of uranium formerly in Soviet nuclear weapons for conversion into reactor fuel. As a consequence of this latter effort, it has been estimated that the equivalent of one lightbulb in every ten in the United States is powered by nuclear fuel removed from warheads previously targeted at the United States and its allies during the Cold War.

The U.S. Special Representative for Nuclear Nonproliferation agreed that nonproliferation and disarmament are linked, noting that they can be mutually reinforcing but also that growing proliferation risks create an environment that makes disarmament more difficult. The United Kingdom, France and Russia likewise defend their nuclear disarmament records, and the five NPT NWS issued a joint statement in 2008 reaffirming their Article VI disarmament commitments.

According to Thomas Reed and Danny Stillman, the &quot;NPT has one giant loophole&quot;: Article IV gives each non-nuclear weapon state the &quot;inalienable right&quot; to pursue nuclear energy for the generation of power. A &quot;number of high-ranking officials, even within the United Nations, have argued that they can do little to stop states using nuclear reactors to produce nuclear weapons&quot;. A 2009 United Nations report said that:

The revival of interest in nuclear power could result in the worldwide dissemination of uranium enrichment and spent fuel reprocessing technologies, which present obvious risks of proliferation as these technologies can produce fissile materials that are directly usable in nuclear weapons.
According to critics, those states which possess nuclear weapons, but are not authorized to do so under the NPT, have not paid a significant price for their pursuit of weapons capabilities. Also, the NPT has been explicitly weakened by a number of bilateral deals made by NPT signatories, notably the United States.

Based on concerns over the slow pace of nuclear disarmament and the continued reliance on nuclear weapons in military and security concepts, doctrines and policies, the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons was adopted in July 2017 and was subsequently opened for signature on 20 September 2017. Entering into force on 22 January 2021, it prohibits each state party from the development, testing, production, stockpiling, stationing, transfer, use and threat of use of nuclear weapons, as well as assistance to those activities. It reaffirms in its preamble the vital role of the full and effective implementation of the NPT.

Ineffective enforcement of territorial integrity and rule of law in the 21st century could undermine the credibility of the security assurances that are part of the current global nuclear order.

<text>Nikolai Ivanovich Bukharin (; – 15 March 1938) was a Russian revolutionary, Soviet politician, and Marxist theorist. A prominent Bolshevik described by Vladimir Lenin as a &quot;most valuable and major theorist&quot; of the Communist Party, Bukharin was active in the Soviet government from 1917 until his purge in 1937.

Bukharin joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1906, and studied economics at Moscow Imperial University. In 1910, he was arrested and internally exiled to Onega, but the following year escaped abroad, where he met Lenin and Leon Trotsky and built his reputation with works such as &quot;Imperialism and World Economy&quot; (1915). After the February Revolution of 1917, Bukharin returned to Moscow and became a leading figure in the party, and after the October Revolution became editor of its newspaper, &quot;Pravda&quot;. He led the Left Communist faction in 1918, and during the civil war wrote &quot;The ABC of Communism&quot; (1920; with Yevgeni Preobrazhensky) and &quot;Historical Materialism: A System of Sociology&quot; (1921), among other works.

Bukharin was initially a proponent of war communism, but in 1921 supported the introduction of the New Economic Policy (NEP) and became its chief theorist and advocate, supporting the party leadership against Trotsky and the Left Opposition. By late 1924, this stance had positioned Bukharin favourably as Joseph Stalin&#x27;s chief ally, with Bukharin soon elaborating Stalin&#x27;s theory of &quot;socialism in one country&quot;. From 1926 to 1929, Bukharin served as General Secretary of the Comintern&#x27;s executive committee. Following Stalin&#x27;s decision to proceed with agricultural collectivisation in the Great Break, Bukharin was labelled as the leader of the Right Opposition and was removed from &quot;Pravda&quot;, the Comintern, and the party leadership in 1929.

After a period in lower positions, in 1934 Bukharin was reelected to the Central Committee and became editor of the newspaper &quot;Izvestia&quot;. He was a principal architect of the 1936 Soviet Constitution. During the Great Purge, Bukharin was accused of treason in February 1937 and executed after a show trial in 1938.

== Before 1917 ==
Nikolai Bukharin was born on 27 September (9 October, new style), 1888, in Moscow. He was the second son of two schoolteachers, Ivan Gavrilovich Bukharin and Liubov Ivanovna Bukharina. According to Nikolai his father did not believe in God and, from the age of four, often asked him to recite poetry for family friends. His childhood is vividly recounted in his mostly autobiographic novel &quot;How It All Began&quot;.

Bukharin&#x27;s political life began at the age of sixteen, with his lifelong friend Ilya Ehrenburg, when they participated in student activities at Moscow University related to the Russian Revolution of 1905. He joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1906, and became a member of its Bolshevik faction. With Grigori Sokolnikov, Bukharin convened the 1907 national youth conference in Moscow, which was later considered the founding of Komsomol.

By age twenty, he was a member of the Moscow Committee of the party. The committee was widely infiltrated by the Tsarist secret police, the Okhrana. As one of its leaders, Bukharin quickly became a person of interest to them. During this time, he became closely associated with Valerian Obolensky and Vladimir Smirnov. He also met his future first wife, Nadezhda Mikhailovna Lukina, his cousin and the sister of Nikolai Lukin, who was also a member of the party. They married in 1911, soon after returning from internal exile.

In 1911, after a brief imprisonment, Bukharin was exiled to Onega in Arkhangelsk, but he soon escaped to Hanover. He stayed in Germany for a year before visiting Kraków (Poland) in 1912 to meet Vladimir Lenin for the first time. During the exile, he continued his education and wrote several books that established him in his 20s as a major Bolshevik theorist. His work &quot;&quot; influenced Lenin, who freely borrowed from it in his larger and better-known work, &quot;Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism&quot;. He and Lenin also often had hot disputes on theoretical issues, as well as Bukharin&#x27;s closeness with the European Left and his anti-statist tendencies. Bukharin developed an interest in the works of Austrian Marxists and heterodox Marxist economic theorists, such as Aleksandr Bogdanov, who did not agree with Lenin. Also, while in Vienna in 1913, he helped the Georgian Bolshevik Joseph Stalin write an article &quot;Marxism and the National Question&quot; at Lenin&#x27;s request.

In October 1916, while based in New York City, Bukharin edited the newspaper (&quot;New World&quot;) with Leon Trotsky and Alexandra Kollontai. When Trotsky arrived in New York in January 1917, Bukharin was the first of the émigrés to greet him. (Trotsky&#x27;s wife recalled, &quot;with a bear hug and immediately began to tell them about a public library which stayed open late at night and which he proposed to show us at once&quot; dragging the tired Trotskys across town &quot;to admire his great discovery&quot;).

== From 1917 to 1923 ==
At the news of the Russian Revolution of February 1917, exiled revolutionaries from around the world began to flock back to the homeland. Trotsky left New York on 27 March 1917, sailing for St. Petersburg. Bukharin left New York in early April and returned to Russia by way of Japan (where he was temporarily detained by local police), arriving in Moscow in early May 1917. Politically, the Bolsheviks in Moscow were a minority in relation to the Mensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionaries. As more people began to be attracted to Lenin&#x27;s promise to bring peace by withdrawing from the Great War, membership in the Bolshevik faction began to increase dramatically – from 24,000 members in February 1917 to 200,000 members in October 1917. Upon his return to Moscow, Bukharin resumed his seat on the Moscow City Committee and also became a member of the Moscow Regional Bureau of the party.

To complicate matters further, the Bolsheviks themselves were divided into a right wing and a left wing. The right-wing of the Bolsheviks, including Aleksei Rykov and Viktor Nogin, controlled the Moscow Committee, while the younger left-wing Bolsheviks, including Vladimir Smirnov, Valerian Osinsky, Georgii Lomov, Nikolay Yakovlev, Ivan Kizelshtein and Ivan Stukov, were members of the Moscow Regional Bureau. On 10 October 1917, Bukharin was elected to the Central Committee, along with two other Moscow Bolsheviks: Andrei Bubnov and Grigori Sokolnikov. This strong representation on the Central Committee was a direct recognition of the Moscow Bureau&#x27;s increased importance. Whereas the Bolsheviks had previously been a minority in Moscow behind the Mensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionaries, by September 1917 the Bolsheviks were in the majority in Moscow. Furthermore, the Moscow Regional Bureau was formally responsible for the party organizations in each of the thirteen central provinces around Moscow – which accounted for 37% of the whole population of Russia and 20% of the Bolshevik membership.

While no one dominated revolutionary politics in Moscow during the October Revolution as Trotsky did in St. Petersburg, Bukharin certainly was the most prominent leader in Moscow. During the October Revolution, Bukharin drafted, introduced, and defended the revolutionary decrees of the Moscow Soviet. Bukharin then represented the Moscow Soviet in their report to the revolutionary government in Petrograd. Following the October Revolution, Bukharin became the editor of the party&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;Pravda&quot;.

Bukharin believed passionately in the promise of world revolution. In the Russian turmoil near the end of World War I, when a negotiated peace with the Central Powers was looming, he demanded a continuance of the war, fully expecting to incite all the foreign proletarian classes to arms. Even as he was uncompromising toward Russia&#x27;s battlefield enemies, he also rejected any fraternization with the capitalist Allied powers: he reportedly wept when he learned of official negotiations for assistance.
Bukharin emerged as the leader of the Left Communists in bitter opposition to Lenin&#x27;s decision to sign the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. In this wartime power struggle, Lenin&#x27;s arrest had been seriously discussed by them and Left Socialist Revolutionaries in 1918. Bukharin revealed this in a Pravda article in 1924 and stated that it had been &quot;a period when the party stood a hair from a split, and the whole country a hair from ruin&quot;.

After the ratification of the treaty, Bukharin resumed his responsibilities within the party. In March 1919, he became a member of the Comintern&#x27;s executive committee and a candidate member of the Politburo. During the Civil War period, he published several theoretical economic works, including the popular primer &quot;The ABC of Communism&quot; (with Yevgeni Preobrazhensky, 1919), and the more academic &quot;Economics of the Transitional Period&quot; (1920) and &quot;Historical Materialism&quot; (1921).

By 1921, he changed his position and accepted Lenin&#x27;s emphasis on the survival and strengthening of the Soviet state as the bastion of the future world revolution. He became the foremost supporter of the New Economic Policy (NEP), to which he was to tie his political fortunes. Considered by the Left Communists as a retreat from socialist policies, the NEP reintroduced money and allowed private ownership and capitalistic practices in agriculture, retail trade, and light industry while the state retained control of heavy industry.

== Power struggle ==
After Lenin&#x27;s death in 1924, Bukharin became a full member of the Politburo. In the subsequent power struggle among Leon Trotsky, Grigory Zinoviev, Lev Kamenev and Stalin, Bukharin allied himself with Stalin, who positioned himself as centrist of the Party and supported the NEP against the Left Opposition, which wanted more rapid industrialization, escalation of class struggle against the kulaks (wealthier peasants), and agitation for world revolution. It was Bukharin who formulated the thesis of &quot;Socialism in One Country&quot; put forth by Stalin in 1924, which argued that socialism (in Marxist theory, the period of transition to communism) could be developed in a single country, even one as underdeveloped as Russia. This new theory stated that socialist gains could be consolidated in a single country, without that country relying on simultaneous successful revolutions across the world. The thesis would become a hallmark of Stalinism.

Trotsky, the prime force behind the Left Opposition, was defeated by a triumvirate formed by Stalin, Zinoviev, and Kamenev, with the support of Bukharin. At the Fourteenth Party Congress in December 1925, Stalin openly attacked Kamenev and Zinoviev, revealing that they had asked for his aid in expelling Trotsky from the Party. By 1926, the Stalin-Bukharin alliance ousted Zinoviev and Kamenev from the Party leadership, and Bukharin enjoyed the highest degree of power during the 1926–1928 period. He emerged as the leader of the Party&#x27;s right wing, which included two other Politburo members (Alexei Rykov, Lenin&#x27;s successor as Chairman of the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars and Mikhail Tomsky, head of trade unions) and he became General Secretary of the Comintern&#x27;s executive committee in 1926. However, prompted by a grain shortage in 1928, Stalin reversed himself and proposed a program of rapid industrialization and forced collectivization because he believed that the NEP was not working fast enough. Stalin felt that in the new situation the policies of his former foes—Trotsky, Zinoviev, and Kamenev—were the right ones.

Bukharin was worried by the prospect of Stalin&#x27;s plan, which he feared would lead to &quot;military-feudal exploitation&quot; of the peasantry. Bukharin did want the Soviet Union to achieve industrialization but he preferred the more moderate approach of offering the peasants the opportunity to become prosperous, which would lead to greater grain production for sale abroad. Bukharin pressed his views throughout 1928 in meetings of the Politburo and at the Communist Party Congress, insisting that enforced grain requisition would be counterproductive, as War Communism had been a decade earlier.

== Fall from power ==
Bukharin&#x27;s support for the continuation of the NEP was not popular with higher Party cadres, and his slogan to peasants, &quot;Enrich yourselves!&quot; and proposal to achieve socialism &quot;at snail&#x27;s pace&quot; left him vulnerable to attacks first by Zinoviev and later by Stalin. Stalin attacked Bukharin&#x27;s views, portraying them as capitalist deviations and declaring that the revolution would be at risk without a strong policy that encouraged rapid industrialization.

Having helped Stalin achieve unchecked power against the Left Opposition, Bukharin found himself easily outmaneuvered by Stalin. Yet Bukharin played to Stalin&#x27;s strength by maintaining the appearance of unity within the Party leadership. Meanwhile, Stalin used his control of the Party machine to replace Bukharin&#x27;s supporters in the Rightist power base in Moscow, trade unions, and the Comintern.

Bukharin attempted to gain support from earlier foes including Kamenev and Zinoviev who had fallen from power and held mid-level positions within the Communist party. The details of his meeting with Kamenev, to whom he confided that Stalin was &quot;Genghis Khan&quot; and changed policies to get rid of rivals, were leaked by the Trotskyist press and subjected him to accusations of factionalism. Jules Humbert-Droz, a former ally and friend of Bukharin, wrote that in spring 1929, Bukharin told him that he had formed an alliance with Zinoviev and Kamenev, and that they were planning to use individual terror (assassination) to get rid of Stalin. Eventually, Bukharin lost his position in the Comintern and the editorship of &quot;Pravda&quot; in April 1929, and he was expelled from the Politburo on 17 November of that year.

Bukharin was forced to renounce his views under pressure. He wrote letters to Stalin pleading for forgiveness and rehabilitation, but through wiretaps of Bukharin&#x27;s private conversations with Stalin&#x27;s enemies, Stalin knew Bukharin&#x27;s repentance was insincere.

International supporters of Bukharin, Jay Lovestone of the Communist Party USA among them, were also expelled from the Comintern. They formed an international alliance to promote their views, calling it the &quot;International Communist Opposition&quot;, though it became better known as the Right Opposition, after a term used by the Trotskyist Left Opposition in the Soviet Union to refer to Bukharin and his supporters there.

Even after his fall, Bukharin still did some important work for the Party. For example, he helped write the 1936 Soviet constitution, which he believed would guarantee real democratization. There is some evidence that Bukharin was thinking of evolution toward some kind of two-party or at least two-slate elections. Boris Nikolaevsky reported that Bukharin said: &quot;A second party is necessary. If there is only one electoral list, without opposition, that&#x27;s equivalent to Nazism.&quot; Grigory Tokaev, a Soviet defector and admirer of Bukharin, reported that: &quot;Stalin aimed at one party dictatorship and complete centralisation. Bukharin envisaged several parties and even nationalist parties, and stood for the maximum of decentralisation.&quot;

== Friendship with Osip Mandelstam and Boris Pasternak ==
In the brief period of thaw in 1934–1936, Bukharin was politically rehabilitated and was made editor of &quot;Izvestia&quot; in 1934. There, he consistently highlighted the dangers of fascist regimes in Europe and the need for &quot;proletarian humanism&quot;. One of his first decisions as editor was to invite Boris Pasternak to contribute to the newspaper and sit in on editorial meetings. Pasternak described Bukharin as &quot;a wonderful, historically extraordinary man, but fate has not been kind to him&quot;. They first met during the lying-in-state of the Soviet police chief, Vyacheslav Menzhinsky in May 1934, when Pasternak was seeking help for his fellow poet, Osip Mandelstam, who had been arrested – though at that time neither Pasternak nor Bukharin knew why.

Bukharin had acted as Mandelstam&#x27;s political protector since 1922. According to Mandelstam&#x27;s wife, Nadezhda, &quot;M. owed him all the pleasant things in his life. His 1928 volume of poetry would never have come out without the active intervention of Bukharin. The journey to Armenia, our apartment and ration cards, contracts for future volumes – all this was arranged by Bukharin.&quot; Bukharin wrote to Stalin, pleading clemency for Mandelstam, and appealed personally to the head of the NKVD, Genrikh Yagoda. It was Yagoda who told him about Mandelstam&#x27;s Stalin Epigram, after which he refused to have any further contact with Nadezhda Mandelstam, who had lied to him by denying that her husband had written &quot;anything rash&quot; – but continued to befriend Pasternak.

Soon after Mandelstam&#x27;s arrest, Bukharin was delegated to prepare the official report on poetry for the First Soviet Writers&#x27; Congress, in August 1934. He could not any longer risk mentioning Mandelstam in his speech to the congress, but did devote a large section of his speech to Pasternak, whom he described as &quot;remote from current affairs ... a singer of the old intelligensia ... delicate and subtle ... a wounded and easily vulnerable soul. He is the embodiment of chaste but self-absorbed laboratory craftsmanship&quot;. His speech was greeted with wild applause, though it greatly offended some of the listeners, such as the communist poet Semyon Kirsanov, who complained: &quot;according to Bukharin, all the poets who have used their verses to participate in political life are out of date, but the others are not out of date, the so-called pure (and not so pure) lyric poets&quot;.

When Bukharin was arrested two years later, Boris Pasternak displayed extraordinary courage by having a letter delivered to Bukharin&#x27;s wife saying that he was convinced of his innocence.

== Increasing tensions with Stalin ==
Stalin&#x27;s collectivization policy proved to be as disastrous as Bukharin predicted, but Stalin had by then achieved unchallenged authority in the party leadership. However, there were signs that moderates among Stalin&#x27;s supporters sought to end official terror and bring a general change in policy, after mass collectivization was largely completed and the worst was over. Although Bukharin had not challenged Stalin since 1929, his former supporters, including Martemyan Ryutin, drafted and clandestinely circulated an anti-Stalin platform, which called Stalin the &quot;evil genius of the Russian Revolution&quot;.

However, Sergey Kirov, First Secretary of the Leningrad Regional Committee was assassinated in Leningrad in December 1934, and his death was used by Stalin as a pretext to launch the Great Purge, in which about 700,000 people were to perish as Stalin eliminated all past and potential opposition to his authority. Some historians believe that Kirov&#x27;s assassination in 1934 was arranged by Stalin himself, despite the lack of evidence to plausibly posit such a conclusion. After Kirov&#x27;s assassination, the NKVD charged an ever-growing group of former oppositionists with Kirov&#x27;s murder and other acts of treason, terrorism, sabotage, and espionage.

== Great Purge ==

In February 1936, shortly before the purge started in earnest, Bukharin was sent to Paris by Stalin to negotiate the purchase of the Marx and Engels archives, held by the German Social Democratic Party (SPD) before its dissolution by Hitler. He was joined by his young wife Anna Larina, which therefore opened the possibility of exile, but he decided against it, saying that he could not live outside the Soviet Union.

Bukharin, who had been forced to follow the Party line since 1929, confided to his old friends and former opponents his real view of Stalin and his policy. His conversations with Boris Nicolaevsky, a Menshevik leader who held the manuscripts on behalf of the SPD, formed the basis of &quot;Letter of an Old Bolshevik&quot;, which was very influential in contemporary understanding of the period (especially the Ryutin Affair and the Kirov murder), although there are doubts about its authenticity.

According to Nicolaevsky, Bukharin spoke of &quot;the mass annihilation of completely defenseless men, with women and children&quot; under forced collectivization and liquidation of kulaks as a class that dehumanized the Party members with &quot;the profound psychological change in those communists who took part in the campaign. Instead of going mad, they accepted terror as a normal administrative method and regarded obedience to all orders from above as a supreme virtue. ... They are no longer human beings. They have truly become the cogs in a terrible machine.&quot;

Yet to another Menshevik leader, Fyodor Dan, he confided that Stalin became &quot;the man to whom the Party granted its confidence&quot; and &quot;is a sort of a symbol of the Party&quot; even though he &quot;is not a man, but a devil&quot;. In Dan&#x27;s account, Bukharin&#x27;s acceptance of the Soviet Union&#x27;s new direction was thus a result of his utter commitment to Party solidarity.

To his boyhood friend, Ilya Ehrenburg, he expressed the suspicion that the whole trip was a trap set up by Stalin. Indeed, his contacts with Mensheviks during this trip were to feature prominently in his trial.

== Trial ==

Stalin was for a long time undecided on Bukharin and Georgy Pyatakov. After receiving Nikolay Yezhov&#x27;s written evidence denouncing Bukharin, Stalin declined to sanction his arrest. After the trial and execution of Zinoviev, Kamenev, and other leftist Old Bolsheviks in 1936, Bukharin and Rykov were arrested on 27 February 1937 following a plenum of the Central Committee, and were charged with conspiring to overthrow the Soviet state. Photostatic evidence shows that Stalin&#x27;s first impulse was to simply exile Bukharin, without sending him to trial. In the end, Bukharin was killed, but according to historian Alec Nove, &quot;the road to his demise was not a straight one&quot;.

Bukharin was tried in the Trial of the Twenty One on 2–13 March 1938 during the Great Purge, along with ex-premier Alexei Rykov, Christian Rakovsky, Nikolai Krestinsky, Genrikh Yagoda, and 16 other defendants alleged to belong to the so-called &quot;Bloc of Rightists and Trotskyites&quot;. In a trial meant to be the culmination of previous show trials, it was alleged that Bukharin and others sought to assassinate Lenin and Stalin from 1918, murder Maxim Gorky by poison, partition the Soviet Union and hand out her territories to Germany, Japan, and Great Britain.

Even more than earlier Moscow show trials, Bukharin&#x27;s trial horrified many previously sympathetic observers as they watched allegations levelled against someone who had been so close to Stalin and Lenin. For some prominent Communists such as Bertram Wolfe, Jay Lovestone, Arthur Koestler, and Heinrich Brandler, the Bukharin trial marked their final break with Communism and even turned the first three into passionate anti-Communists eventually.

Bukharin wrote letters to Stalin while imprisoned, attempting without success to negotiate his innocence in the case of the alleged crimes, his eventual execution, and his hoped for release. 

In his letter of 10 December 1937, Bukharin suggests becoming Stalin&#x27;s tool against Trotsky, but there&#x27;s no evidence Stalin ever seriously considered Bukharin&#x27;s offer.

While Anastas Mikoyan and Vyacheslav Molotov later claimed that Bukharin was never tortured and his letters from prison do not give the suggestion that he was tortured, it is also known that his interrogators were given the order: &quot;beating permitted&quot;. Bukharin held out for three months, but threats to his young wife and infant son, combined with &quot;methods of physical influence&quot; wore him down. But when he read his confession amended and corrected personally by Stalin, he withdrew his whole confession. The examination started all over again, with a double team of interrogators.

Bukharin&#x27;s confession and his motivation became subject of much debate among Western observers, inspiring Koestler&#x27;s acclaimed novel &quot;Darkness at Noon&quot; and a philosophical essay by Maurice Merleau-Ponty in &quot;Humanism and Terror&quot;. His confessions were somewhat different from others in that while he pleaded guilty to the &quot;sum total of crimes&quot;, he denied knowledge when it came to specific crimes. Some astute observers noted that he would allow only what was in the written confession and refuse to go any further.

There are several interpretations of Bukharin&#x27;s motivations (besides being coerced) in the trial. Koestler and others viewed it as a true believer&#x27;s last service to the Party (while preserving the little amount of personal honor left) whereas Bukharin biographer Stephen Cohen and Robert Tucker saw traces of Aesopian language, with which Bukharin sought to turn the tables into an anti-trial of Stalinism (while keeping his part of the bargain to save his family). While his letters to Stalin – he wrote 34 very emotional and desperate letters tearfully protesting his innocence and professing his loyalty – suggest a complete capitulation and acceptance of his role in the trial, it contrasts with his actual conduct in the trial. Bukharin himself speaks of his &quot;peculiar duality of mind&quot; in his last plea, which led to &quot;semi-paralysis of the will&quot; and Hegelian &quot;unhappy consciousness&quot;, which likely stemmed not only from his knowledge of the ruinous reality of Stalinism (although of course he could not say so in the trial) but also of the impending threat of fascism.

The result was a curious mix of fulsome confessions (of being a &quot;degenerate fascist&quot; working for the &quot;restoration of capitalism&quot;) and subtle criticisms of the trial. After disproving several charges against him (one observer noted that he &quot;proceeded to demolish, or rather showed he could very easily demolish, the whole case&quot;) and saying that &quot;the confession of the accused is not essential. The confession of the accused is a medieval principle of jurisprudence&quot; in a trial that was solely based on confessions, he finished his last plea with the words:

The state prosecutor, Andrey Vyshinsky, characterized Bukharin as an &quot;accursed crossbreed of fox and pig&quot; who supposedly committed a &quot;whole nightmare of vile crimes&quot;.

While in prison, he wrote at least four book-length manuscripts including a lyrical autobiographical novel, &quot;How It All Began&quot;, a philosophical treatise, &quot;Philosophical Arabesques&quot;, a collection of poems, and &quot;Socialism and Its Culture&quot; – all of which were found in Stalin&#x27;s archive and published in the 1990s.

== Execution ==

Among other intercessors, the French author and Nobel laureate Romain Rolland wrote to Stalin seeking clemency, arguing that &quot;an intellect like that of Bukharin is a treasure for his country&quot;. He compared Bukharin&#x27;s situation to that of the great chemist Antoine Lavoisier who was guillotined during the French Revolution: &quot;We in France, the most ardent revolutionaries ... still profoundly grieve and regret what we did. ... I beg you to show clemency.&quot; He had earlier written to Stalin in 1937, &quot;For the sake of Gorky I am asking you for mercy, even if he may be guilty of something&quot;, to which Stalin noted: &quot;We must not respond.&quot; Bukharin was executed on 15 March 1938 at the Kommunarka shooting ground, but the announcement of his death was overshadowed by the Nazi Anschluss of Austria.

According to Zhores and Roy Medvedev in &quot;The Unknown Stalin&quot; (2006), Bukharin&#x27;s last message to Stalin stated &quot;Koba, why do you need me to die?&quot;, which was written in a note to Stalin just before his execution. &quot;Koba&quot; was Stalin&#x27;s &quot;nom de guerre&quot;, and Bukharin&#x27;s use of it was a sign of how close the two had once been. The note was allegedly found still in Stalin&#x27;s desk after his death in 1953.

Despite the promise to spare his family, Bukharin&#x27;s wife, Anna Larina, was sent to a labor camp, but she survived to see her husband officially rehabilitated by the Soviet state under Mikhail Gorbachev in 1988. Their son, Yuri Larin (born 1936), was sent to an orphanage in an attempt to keep him safe from the authorities, and also lived to see his rehabilitation. His first wife, Nadezhda, died in a labor camp after being arrested in 1938. His second wife, Esfir&#x27; Gurvich, and their daughter Svetlana Gurvich-Bukharina (born 1924), were arrested in 1949, but survived past 1988, though they had lived in fear of the government their whole lives.

== Political stature and achievements ==
Bukharin was immensely popular within the party throughout the twenties and thirties, even after his fall from power. In his testament, Lenin portrayed him as the Golden Boy of the party, writing:

Speaking of the young C.C. members, I wish to say a few words about Bukharin and Pyatakov. They are, in my opinion, the most outstanding figures (among the youngest ones), and the following must be borne in mind about them: Bukharin is not only a most valuable and major theorist of the Party; he is also rightly considered the favourite of the whole Party, but his theoretical views can be classified as fully Marxist only with great reserve, for there is something scholastic about him (he has never made a study of the dialectics, and, I think, never fully understood it) ... Both of these remarks, of course, are made only for the present, on the assumption that both these outstanding and devoted Party workers fail to find an occasion to enhance their knowledge and amend their one-sidedness.


Bukharin made several notable contributions to Marxist–Leninist thought, most notably &quot;The Economics of the Transition Period&quot; (1920) and his prison writings, &quot;Philosophical Arabesques&quot;, as well as being a founding member of the Soviet Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a keen botanist. His primary contributions to economics were his critique of marginal utility theory, his analysis of imperialism, and his writings on the transition to communism in the Soviet Union.

Bukharin alongside Trotsky have been viewed by some scholars as representing political alternatives to Stalinism. In part, due to their de facto leadership of the Right Opposition and Left Opposition which was at variance with Stalin. These core differences ranged from areas related to economics, foreign policy and cultural matters.

His ideas, especially in economics and the question of market socialism, later became highly influential in the Chinese socialist market economy and Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s economic reforms.

British author Martin Amis argues that Bukharin was perhaps the only major Bolshevik to acknowledge &quot;moral hesitation&quot; by questioning, even in passing, the violence and sweeping reforms of the early Soviet Union. Amis writes that Bukharin said &quot;during the Civil War he had seen &#x27;things that I would not want even my enemies to see.

=== Cartoons ===
Bukharin was a cartoonist who left many cartoons of contemporary Soviet politicians. The renowned artist Konstantin Yuon once told him: &quot;Forget about politics. There is no future in politics for you. Painting is your real calling.&quot; His cartoons are sometimes used to illustrate the biographies of Soviet officials. Russian historian Yury Zhukov stated that Nikolai Bukharin&#x27;s portraits of Joseph Stalin were the only ones drawn from the original, not from a photograph.

<text>In phonetics, a nasal, also called a nasal occlusive or nasal stop in contrast with an oral stop or nasalized consonant, is an occlusive consonant produced with a lowered velum, allowing air to escape freely through the nose. The vast majority of consonants are oral consonants. Examples of nasals in English are , and , in words such as &quot;nose&quot;, &quot;bring&quot; and &quot;mouth&quot;. Nasal occlusives are nearly universal in human languages. There are also other kinds of nasal consonants in some languages.

== Definition ==
Nearly all nasal consonants are nasal occlusives, in which air escapes through the nose but not through the mouth, as it is blocked (occluded) by the lips or tongue. The oral cavity still acts as a resonance chamber for the sound. Rarely, non-occlusive consonants may be nasalized.

Most nasals are voiced, and in fact, the nasal sounds and are among the most common sounds cross-linguistically. Voiceless nasals occur in a few languages such as Burmese, Welsh, Icelandic and Guaraní. (Compare oral stops, which block off the air completely, and fricatives, which obstruct the air with a narrow channel. Both stops and fricatives are more commonly voiceless than voiced, and are known as obstruents.)

In terms of acoustics, nasals are sonorants, which means that they do not significantly restrict the escape of air (as it can freely escape out the nose). However, nasals are also obstruents in their articulation because the flow of air through the mouth is blocked. This duality, a sonorant airflow through the nose along with an obstruction in the mouth, means that nasal occlusives behave both like sonorants and like obstruents. For example, nasals tend to pattern with other sonorants such as and , but in many languages, they may develop from or into stops.

Acoustically, nasals have bands of energy at around 200 and 2,000 Hz.

1. The symbol is commonly used to represent the dental nasal as well, rather than , as it is rarely distinguished from the alveolar nasal.

Examples of languages containing nasal occlusives:

The voiced retroflex nasal is a common sound in Languages of South Asia and Australian Aboriginal languages.

The voiced palatal nasal is a common sound in European languages, such as: Spanish , French and Italian , Catalan and Hungarian , Czech and Slovak , Polish , Occitan and Portuguese , and (before a vowel) Modern Greek .

Many Germanic languages, including German, Dutch, English and Swedish, as well as varieties of Chinese such as Mandarin and Cantonese, have , and . Malayalam has a six-fold distinction between ; some speakers also have a /ŋʲ/.

The Nuosu language also contrasts six categories of nasals, . They are represented in romanisation by &lt;m, n, hm, hn, ny, ng&gt;. Nuosu also contrasts prenasalised stops and affricates with their voiced, unvoiced, and aspirated versions. 

/ɱ/ is the rarest voiced nasal to be phonemic, its mostly an allophone of other nasals before labiodentals and currently there is only 1 reported language, Kukuya, which distinguishes /m, ɱ, n, ɲ, ŋ/ and also a set of prenasalized consonants like /ᶬp̪fʰ, ᶬb̪v/. Yuanmen used to have it phonemically before merging it with /m/.

Catalan, Occitan, Spanish, and Italian have as phonemes, and as allophones. It may also be claimed that Catalan has phonemic , at least on the basis of Central Catalan forms such as , although the only minimal pairs involve foreign proper nouns. Also, among many younger speakers of Rioplatense Spanish, the palatal nasal has been lost, replaced by a cluster , as in English &quot;canyon&quot;.

In Brazilian Portuguese and Angolan Portuguese , written , is typically pronounced as , a nasal palatal approximant, a nasal glide (in Polish, this feature is also possible as an allophone). Semivowels in Portuguese often nasalize before and always after nasal vowels, resulting in and . What would be coda nasal occlusives in other West Iberian languages is only slightly pronounced before dental consonants. Outside this environment the nasality is spread over the vowel or become a nasal diphthong (&quot;mambembe&quot; , outside the final, only in Brazil, and &quot;mantém&quot; in all Portuguese dialects).

The Japanese syllabary kana ん, typically romanized as &quot;n&quot; and occasionally &quot;m&quot;, can manifest as one of several different nasal consonants depending on what consonant follows it; this allophone, colloquially written in IPA as , is known as the moraic nasal, per the language&#x27;s moraic structure.

Welsh has a set of voiceless nasals, /m̥, n̥, ŋ̊/, which occur predominantly as a result of nasal mutation of their voiced counterparts (/m, n, ŋ/).

The Mapos Buang language of New Guinea has a phonemic uvular nasal, /ɴ/, which contrasts with a velar nasal. It is extremely rare for a language to have /ɴ/ as a phoneme. The /ŋ, ɴ/ distinction also occurs in a few Inuit languages like Iñupiaq. Chamdo languages like Lamo (Kyilwa dialect), Larong sMar (Tangre Chaya dialect), Drag-yab sMar (Razi dialect) have an extreme distinction of /m̥ n̥ ȵ̊ ŋ̊ ɴ̥ m n ȵ ŋ ɴ/, also one of the few languages to have a [ɴ̥].

Yanyuwa is highly unusual in that it has a seven-way distinction between /m, n̪, n, ɳ, ṉ/ (palato-alveolar), /ŋ̟/ (front velar), and /ŋ̠/ (back velar). This may be the only language in existence that contrasts nasals at seven distinct points of articulation.

Yélî Dnye also has an extreme contrast of /m, mʷ, mʲ, mʷʲ, n̪, n̪͡m, n̠, n̠͡m, n̠ʲ, ŋ, ŋʷ, ŋʲ, ŋ͡m/.

The term &#x27;nasal occlusive&#x27; (or &#x27;nasal stop&#x27;) is generally abbreviated to &quot;nasal&quot;. However, there are also nasalized fricatives, nasalized flaps, nasal glides, and nasal vowels, as in French, Portuguese, and Polish. In the , nasal vowels and nasalized consonants are indicated by placing a tilde (~) over the vowel or consonant in question: French &quot;sang&quot; , Portuguese &quot;bom&quot; , Polish &quot;wąż&quot; .

==Voiceless nasals==
A few languages have phonemic voiceless nasal occlusives. Among them are Icelandic, Faroese, Burmese, Jalapa Mazatec, Kildin Sami, Welsh, and Central Alaskan Yup&#x27;ik. Iaai of New Caledonia has an unusually large number of them, with , along with a number of voiceless approximants.

==Other kinds of nasal consonant==
Ladefoged and Maddieson (1996) distinguish purely nasal consonants, the nasal occlusives such as &quot;m n ng&quot; in which the airflow is purely nasal, from partial nasal consonants such as prenasalized consonants and nasal pre-stopped consonants, which are nasal for only part of their duration, as well as from nasalized consonants, which have simultaneous oral and nasal airflow. In some languages, such as Portuguese, a nasal consonant may have occlusive and non-occlusive allophones. In general, therefore, a nasal consonant may be:

* a nasal occlusive, such as English &quot;m, n, ng&quot;
* nasal approximants, as in &quot;nh, ão&quot; [j̃, w̃] in some Portuguese dialects and &quot;ą, ę&quot; in Polish
* prenasalized consonants, pre-stopped nasals and post-stopped nasals, as in Arrernte
* nasal clicks such as Zulu &quot;nq, nx, nc&quot;
* other nasalized consonants, such as nasalized fricatives

A nasal trill has been described from some dialects of Romanian, and is posited as an intermediate historical step in rhotacism. However, the phonetic variation of the sound is considerable, and it is not clear how frequently it is actually trilled. Some languages contrast /r, r̃/ like Toro-tegu Dogon (contrasts /w, r, j, w̃, r̃, j̃/) and Inor. A nasal lateral has been reported for some languages, Nzema language contrasts /l, l̃/.

==Languages without nasals==
A few languages, perhaps 2%, contain no phonemically distinctive nasals. This led Ferguson (1963) to assume that all languages have at least one primary nasal occlusive. However, there are exceptions.

===Lack of phonemic nasals===
When a language is claimed to lack nasals altogether, as with several Niger–Congo languages or the Pirahã language of the Amazon, nasal and non-nasal or prenasalized consonants usually alternate allophonically, and it is a theoretical claim on the part of the individual linguist that the nasal is not the basic form of the consonant. In the case of some Niger–Congo languages, for example, nasals occur before only nasal vowels. Since nasal vowels are phonemic, it simplifies the picture somewhat to assume that nasalization in occlusives is allophonic. There is then a second step in claiming that nasal vowels nasalize oral occlusives, rather than oral vowels denasalizing nasal occlusives, that is, whether are phonemically without full nasals, or without prenasalized stops. Postulating underlying oral or prenasalized stops rather than true nasals helps to explain the apparent instability of nasal correspondences throughout Niger–Congo compared with, for example, Indo-European.

This analysis comes at the expense, in some languages, of postulating either a single nasal consonant that can only be syllabic, or a larger set of nasal vowels than oral vowels, both typologically odd situations. The way such a situation could develop is illustrated by a Jukunoid language, Wukari. Wukari allows oral vowels in syllables like &quot;ba, mba&quot; and nasal vowels in &quot;bã, mã&quot;, suggesting that nasals become prenasalized stops before oral vowels. Historically, however, *mb became **mm before nasal vowels, and then reduced to *m, leaving the current asymmetric distribution.

In older speakers of the Tlingit language, and are allophones. Tlingit is usually described as having an unusual, perhaps unique lack of despite having five lateral obstruents; the older generation could be argued to have but at the expense of having no nasals.

===Lack of phonetic nasals===
Several of languages surrounding Puget Sound, such as Quileute (Chimakuan family), Lushootseed (Salishan family), and Makah (Wakashan family), are truly without any nasalization whatsoever, in consonants or vowels, except in special speech registers such as baby talk or the archaic speech of mythological figures (and perhaps not even that in the case of Quileute). This is an areal feature, only a few hundred years old, where nasals became voiced stops ( became , became , became , became , became , became , became , etc.) after colonial contact. For example, &quot;Snohomish&quot; is currently pronounced &quot;sdohobish&quot;, but was transcribed with nasals in the first English-language records.

The only other places in the world where this is known to occur are in Melanesia. In the central dialect of the Rotokas language of Bougainville Island, nasals are only used when imitating foreign accents. (A second dialect has a series of nasals.) The Lakes Plain languages of West Irian are similar.

The unconditioned loss of nasals, as in Puget Sound, is unusual. Currently in Korean, and are shifting to and , but only word-initially. This started out in nonstandard dialects and was restricted to the beginning of prosodic units (a common position for fortition), but has expanded to many speakers of the standard language to the beginnings of common words even within prosodic units.

<text>The nuvistor is a type of vacuum tube announced by RCA in 1959. Nuvistors were made to compete with the then-new bipolar junction transistors, and were much smaller than conventional tubes of the day, almost approaching the compactness of early discrete transistor casings. Due to their small size, there was no space to include a vacuum fitting to evacuate the tube; instead, nuvistors were assembled and processed in a vacuum chamber by simple robotic devices. The tube envelope is made of metal, with a ceramic base. Triodes and a few tetrodes and pentodes were made; nuvistor tetrodes were taller than triodes. 

Nuvistors are among the highest-performing small-signal radio-frequency receiving tubes, largely due to low stray capacitance and inductance due to their small size. They have excellent VHF and UHF performance, and low noise figures, and were widely used throughout the 1960s for low-power applications in television sets (beginning with RCA&#x27;s &quot;New Vista&quot; line of color sets in 1961 with the CTC-11 chassis), radio receivers and transmitters, audio equipment, and oscilloscopes. RCA discontinued their use in television tuners in late 1971.

Nuvistor applications included the Ampex MR-70, a studio tape recorder whose entire electronics section was based on nuvistors, and studio-grade microphones from that era, such as the AKG/Norelco C12a, which employed the 7586. It was also later found that, with minor circuit modification, the nuvistor made a sufficient replacement for the obsolete Telefunken VF14M tube, used in the Neumann U47 studio microphone. Tektronix used nuvistors in several of its high end oscilloscopes of the 1960s, before replacing them later with solid-state JFETs. Nuvistors were used in the Ranger space program and Russian-made ones (with soldered pigtail leads, more reliable than sockets) were used in the Soviet MiG-25 fighter jet, presumably to radiation-harden the fighter&#x27;s electronics; this was discovered following the defection of Viktor Belenko.

==Pin layouts==
Nuvistor sockets have a standardized layout based on four imaginary concentric circles with the pins laid out at 60 degree angles from the center point of the base. The metal shell has two fins that extend below the base; the larger of these two fins is the key position. Sockets can accommodate up to 12 pins, but usually only five or six are used.

Pins 1, 2 and 3 are assigned to the outermost circle, with Pin 1 located 60 degrees clockwise of the key fin. Pin 2, which is in line with the small fin, is 120 degrees clockwise of Pin 1. Pin 3 is 120 degrees clockwise of pin 2. For triodes, these pins (usually just Pin 2) are the plate/anode connection. For tetrodes, one of these pins is the screen grid connection and the plate/anode has a top cap connection.

Pins 4, 5 and 6 are assigned to the next circle. Pin 4 is in line with the key fin. Pin 5 is 120 degrees clockwise of Pin 4 and the key fin. Pin 6 is 120 degrees clockwise of Pin 5. The pins in this circle (usually pin 4) connect to the control grid.

Pins 7, 8 and 9 are assigned to the next circle. They are in the same lines as Pins 1, 2 and 3 and also increase in order going clockwise. These pins (usually pin 8) connect to the cathode.

Pins 10, 11 and 12 are assigned to the innermost circle. They are in the same lines as Pins 4, 5 and 6 and also increase in order going clockwise. These pins (usually Pins 10 and 12) connect to the heater.

Base 12AQ -- which is used by most triodes, including 6CW4 and 6DS4 -- is the most common connection layout. The connections are:
*Pin 2 - Plate/anode
*Pin 4 - Grid
*Pin 8 - Cathode
*Pins 10 and 12 - Heater

Base 12AS is the tetrode layout. The connections are:
*Pin 2 - Grid 2
*Pin 4 - Grid 1
*Pin 8 - Cathode
*Pins 10 and 12 - Heater
*Top cap - Plate

==Types==

* 7586 - First one released, medium mu triode (amplification factor: 31 to 35)
** 7895 - 7586 with higher mu (amplification factor: 64)
** 8393 - medium mu triode, equivalent of 7586 except heater is 13.5 volts at 60 mA, used in Tektronix equipment.
* 7587 - Sharp cutoff tetrode (Anode is top located)
* 8056 - triode for low plate voltages
* 8058 - triode, with plate cap &amp; grid on shell, for UHF performance

<text>No Logo: Taking Aim at the Brand Bullies is a book by the Canadian author Naomi Klein. First published by Knopf Canada and Picador in December 1999, shortly after the 1999 Seattle WTO protests had generated media attention around such issues, it became one of the most influential books about the alter-globalization movement and an international bestseller.

==Focus==
The book focuses on branding and often makes connections with the anti-globalization movement. Throughout the four parts (&quot;No Space&quot;, &quot;No Choice&quot;, &quot;No Jobs&quot;, and &quot;No Logo&quot;), Klein writes about issues such as sweatshops in the Americas and Asia, culture jamming, corporate censorship, and Reclaim the Streets. She pays special attention to the deeds and misdeeds of Nike, The Gap, McDonald&#x27;s, Shell, and Microsoft – and of their lawyers, contractors, and advertising agencies. 

While globalization appears frequently as a recurring theme, Klein rarely addresses the topic of globalization itself, and when she does, it is usually indirectly. She goes on to discuss globalization in much greater detail in her book &quot;Fences and Windows&quot; (2002).

==Summary==
The book comprises four sections. The first three sections deal with the negative effects of brand-oriented corporate activity, while the fourth and final section discusses various movements that arose in opposition to the corporate activities discussed in the rest of the book.

===&quot;No Space&quot;===
The book begins by tracing the history of brands. Klein argues that there has been a shift in the usage of branding and gives examples of this shift to &quot;anti-brand&quot; branding. Early examples of brands were often used to put a recognizable face on factory-produced products. These slowly gave way to the idea of selling lifestyles. According to Klein, in response to an economic crash in the late 1980s (due to the Latin American debt crisis, Black Monday (1987), the savings and loan crisis, and the Japanese asset price bubble), corporations began to seriously rethink their approach to marketing and to target the youth demographic, as opposed to the baby boomers, who had previously been considered a much more valuable segment.

The book discusses how brand names such as Nike or Pepsi expanded beyond the mere products which bore their names, and how these names and logos began to appear everywhere. As this happened, the brands&#x27; obsession with the youth market drove them to further associate themselves with whatever the youth considered &quot;cool&quot;. Along the way, the brands attempted to associate their names with everything from movie stars and athletes to grassroots social movements.

Klein argues that large multinational corporations consider the marketing of a brand name to be more important than the actual manufacture of products; this theme recurs in the book, and Klein suggests that it helps explain the shift to production in Third World countries in such industries as clothing, footwear, and computer hardware.

This section also looks at ways in which brands have &quot;muscled&quot; their presence into the school system, and how in doing so, they have pipelined advertisements into the schools and used their position to gather information about the students. Klein argues that this is part of a trend toward targeting younger and younger consumers.

===&quot;No Choice&quot;===
In the second section, Klein discusses how brands use their size and clout to limit the number of choices available to the public – whether through market dominance (e.g., Wal-Mart) or through aggressive invasion of a region (e.g., Starbucks). Klein argues that each company&#x27;s goal is to become the dominant force in its respective field. Meanwhile, other corporations, such as Sony or Disney, simply open their own chains of stores, preventing the competition from even putting their products on the shelves.

This section also discusses the way that corporations merge with one another in order to add to their ubiquity and provide greater control over their image. ABC News, for instance, is allegedly under pressure not to air any stories that are overly critical of Disney, its parent company. Other chains, such as Wal-Mart, often threaten to pull various products off their shelves, forcing manufacturers and publishers to comply with their demands. This might mean driving down manufacturing costs or changing the artwork or content of products like magazines or albums so they better fit with Wal-Mart&#x27;s image of family friendliness.

Also discussed is the way that corporations abuse copyright laws in order to silence anyone who might attempt to criticize their brand.

===&quot;No Jobs&quot;===
In this section, the book takes a darker tone and looks at the way in which manufacturing jobs move from local factories to foreign countries, and particularly to places known as export processing zones. Such zones often have no labor laws, leading to dire working conditions.

The book then shifts back to North America, where the lack of manufacturing jobs has led to an influx of work in the service sector, where most of the jobs are for minimum wage and offer no benefits. The term &quot;McJob&quot; is introduced, defined as a job with poor compensation that does not keep pace with inflation, inflexible or undesirable hours, little chance of advancement, and high levels of stress. Meanwhile, the public is being sold the perception that these jobs are temporary employment for students and recent graduates, and therefore need not offer living wages or benefits.

All of this is set against a backdrop of massive profits and wealth being produced within the corporate sector. The result is a new generation of employees who have come to resent the success of the companies they work for. This resentment, along with rising unemployment, labour abuses abroad, disregard for the environment, and the ever-increasing presence of advertising breeds a new disdain for corporations.

===&quot;No Logo&quot;===
The final section of the book discusses various movements that have sprung up during the 1990s. These include &quot;Adbusters&quot; magazine and the culture-jamming movement, as well as Reclaim the Streets and the McLibel trial. Less radical protests are also discussed, such as the various movements aimed at putting an end to sweatshop labour.

Klein concludes by contrasting consumerism and citizenship, opting for the latter. &quot;When I started this book,&quot; she writes, &quot;I honestly didn&#x27;t know whether I was covering marginal atomized scenes of resistance or the birth of a potentially broad-based movement. But as time went on, what I clearly saw was a movement forming before my eyes.&quot;

== Responses ==

After the book&#x27;s release, Klein was heavily criticized by the newspaper &quot;The Economist&quot;, leading to a broadcast debate with Klein and the magazine&#x27;s writers, dubbed &quot;No Logo vs. Pro Logo&quot;.

The 2004 book &quot;The Rebel Sell&quot; (published as &quot;Nation of Rebels&quot; in the United States) specifically criticized &quot;No Logo&quot;, stating that turning the improving quality of life in the working class into a fundamentally anti-market ideology is shallow.

Nike published a point-by-point response to the book, refuting each of the statements Klein had made about the company&#x27;s labor practices.

==Awards==
In 2000, &quot;No Logo&quot; was short-listed for the &quot;Guardian&quot; First Book Award in 2000.

In 2001, the book won the following awards:
* The 2001 National Business Book Award
* The 2001 French Prix Médiations

==Editions==
Several imprints of &quot;No Logo&quot; exist, including a hardcover first edition, a subsequent hardcover edition, and a paperback. A 10th anniversary edition was published by Fourth Estate that includes a new introduction by the author. Translations from the original English into several other languages have also been published. The subtitle, &quot;Taking Aim at the Brand Bullies&quot;, was dropped in some later editions.

==Video==
Naomi Klein explains her ideas in the 40-minute video &quot;No Logo – Brands, Globalization &amp; Resistance&quot; (2003), directed by Sut Jhally.

== Legacy ==
Members of the English rock group Radiohead recommended the book to fans on their website and was rumored to have considered calling the album &quot;Kid A&quot; &quot;No Logo&quot; for a time. Argentine artist Indio Solari wrote a song for his first solo album named &quot;Nike es la cultura&quot; (&quot;Nike is the culture&quot;), in which he says, &quot;You shout No Logo! Or you don&#x27;t shout No Logo! Or you shout No Logo No!&quot; in reference to this book.

Argentine-American rock singer Kevin Johansen wrote a song, &quot;Logo&quot;, inspired by Klein&#x27;s book. A copy of &quot;No Logo&quot; is even used in the official video for the song.

Dave Longstreth of american indie-pop band Dirty Projectors names the book and its author in their 2016 song &quot;Keep Your Name&quot;

<text>The National War College (NWC) of the United States is a school in the National Defense University. It is housed in Roosevelt Hall on Fort Lesley J. McNair, Washington, D.C., the third-oldest Army post still active.

==History==
The National War College (NWC) was officially established on July 1, 1946, as an upgraded replacement for the Army-Navy Staff College, which operated from June 1943 to July 1946. The college was one of James Forrestal&#x27;s favorite causes.

According to Lt. Gen. Leonard T. Gerow, President of the Board that recommended its formation:

Mid-level and senior military officers who are likely to be promoted to the senior ranks are selected to study at the War College to prepare for higher staff and command positions. About 75 percent of the student body is composed of equal representation from the land, air, and sea (including Marine and Coast Guard) services. The remaining 25 percent are drawn from the Department of State and other federal departments and agencies. In addition, international fellows from several countries join the student body. The curriculum is based upon critical analysis of strategic problem solving with an emphasis on strategic leadership. As of the 2014–2015 academic year, the curriculum was based upon a core standard throughout National Defense University.

Because of the NWC&#x27;s privileged location close to the White House, the Supreme Court, and Capitol Hill, it has been able throughout its history to call upon an extraordinarily well-connected array of speakers to animate its discussions. All lectures at the National War College are conducted under a strict &quot;no quotation nor attribution&quot; policy, which has facilitated discussion on some of the most challenging issues of the day.

<text>Neelin is a small community in the Canadian province of Manitoba. It is located on Manitoba Provincial Highway 5 in the Rural Municipality of Argyle, about 29 km east of Killarney, or about 200 km southwest of Winnipeg.

The Roseberry school district was established in 1885, leading to the construction of a one-room schoolhouse in 1904. The school served as a K–12 school until 1960, when high school students began to bus to either Baldur, Killarney or Cartwright. Roseberry, now known as Neelin school, continued until 1968, when it was closed. The building has since been demolished.

Neelin was also home to a Manitoba Pool elevator. The elevator stood on the CPR railroad tracks until its closure in 1978.

<text>Norn is an extinct North Germanic language that was spoken in the Northern Isles (Orkney and Shetland) off the north coast of mainland Scotland and in Caithness in the far north of the Scottish mainland. After Orkney and Shetland were pledged to Scotland by Norway in 1468–69, it was gradually replaced by Scots. Norn is thought to have become extinct around 1850, after the death of Walter Sutherland, the language&#x27;s last known speaker, though there are claims the language persisted as late as the 20th century.

==History==

Norse settlement in the islands probably began in the early 9th century. These settlers are believed to have arrived in very substantial numbers, and like those who migrated to Iceland and the Faroe Islands, it is probable that most came from the west coast of Norway. Shetland toponymy bears some resemblance to that of northwest Norway, while Norn vocabulary implies links with more southerly Norwegian regions.

Orkney and Shetland were pledged to James III in 1468 and 1469 respectively, and it is with these pledges that the replacement of Norn with Scots is most associated. However, the decline of Norse speech in Orkney probably began in 1379 when the Earldom of Orkney, covering all of the Northern Isles, passed into the hands of Henry Sinclair, of Clan Sinclair. Scots had superseded Norse as the language of prestige on Orkney by the early 15th century.

In Shetland, the transition began later, but by the end of the 15th century both island groups were bilingual. Despite this, the process by which Scots overtook Norn as the primary spoken language on the islands was not a swift one, and most natives of Orkney and Shetland probably spoke Norn as a first language until the late 16th and early-to-mid 17th centuries respectively. One of the last documents written in Norn was for a 1597 mortgage issued over a property belonging to Else, sister of Anna Throndsen, who had married a Shetland man Andrew Mowat of Heogoland in Eshaness.

===Extinction===
It is not known exactly when Norn became extinct. Sources from the 17th and 18th centuries speak of Norn (sometimes identified as &quot;Norse&quot;, &quot;Norwegian&quot; or &quot;Danish&quot;) as being in a state of decline and generally indicate that the language remained stronger in Shetland than in Orkney. A source from 1670 states that there are &quot;only three or four parishes&quot; in Orkney where people speak &quot;Noords or rude Danish&quot; and that they do so &quot;chiefly when they are at their own houses&quot;. Another from 1701 indicates that there were still a few monoglot &quot;Norse&quot; speakers who were capable of speaking &quot;no other thing&quot;, and notes that there were more speakers of the language in Shetland than in Orkney. It was said in 1703 that the people of Shetland generally spoke a Lowland Scots dialect brought to Shetland from the end of the fifteenth century by settlers from Fife and Lothian, but that &quot;many among them retain the ancient Danish Language&quot;; while in 1750 Orkney-born James Mackenzie wrote that Norn was not yet entirely extinct, being &quot;retained by old people&quot;, who still spoke it among each other.

The last reports of Norn speakers are claimed to be from the 19th century, with some claims of a very limited use up until the early 20th century, but it is more likely that the language was dying out in the late 18th century. The isolated islands of Foula and Unst are variously claimed as the last refuges of the language in Shetland, where there were people &quot;who could repeat sentences in Norn&quot;, probably passages from folk songs or poems, as late as 1894. Walter Sutherland from Skaw in Unst, who died about 1850, has been cited as the last native speaker of the Norn language.
However, fragments of vocabulary survived the death of the main language and remain to this day, mainly in place-names and terms referring to nature, mood, and fishing. For example, &#x27;vae&#x27;/&#x27;voe&#x27; (an inlet or small bay) are found in some English dictionaries and are legal words in Scrabble.

Norn had also been a spoken language in Caithness but had probably become extinct there by the 15th century, replaced by Scots. Hence, some scholars also speak about &quot;Caithness Norn&quot;, but others avoid this. Even less is known about &quot;Caithness Norn&quot; than about Orkney and Shetland Norn. Almost no written Norn has survived, but what little remains includes a version of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer and a ballad, &quot;Hildina&quot;. Michael P Barnes, professor of Scandinavian Studies at University College London, has published a study, &quot;The Norn Language of Orkney and Shetland&quot;.

==Classification==
Norn is an Indo-European language belonging to the North Germanic branch of the Germanic languages. Together with Faroese, Icelandic and Norwegian, it belongs to the West Scandinavian group, separating it from the East Scandinavian and Gutnish groups consisting of Swedish, Danish and Gutnish.

While this classification is based on the differences between the North Germanic languages at the time they split, their present-day characteristics justify another classification, dividing them into Insular Scandinavian and Mainland Scandinavian language groups based on mutual intelligibility. Under this system, Norwegian is grouped together with Danish and Swedish because the last millennium has seen all three undergo important changes, especially in grammar and lexis, which have set them apart from Faroese and Icelandic.

Norn is generally considered to have been fairly similar to Faroese, sharing many phonological and grammatical traits, and might even have been mutually intelligible with it. Thus, it can be considered an Insular Scandinavian language.

Few written texts remain. It is distinct from the present-day Shetland dialect, which evolved from Middle English.

==Phonology==
The phonology of Norn can never be determined with much precision because of the lack of source material, but the general aspects can be extrapolated from the few written sources that exist. Norn shared many traits with the dialects of southwest Norway. That includes a voicing of to after vowels and (in the Shetland dialect but only partially in the Orkney dialect) a conversion of and (&quot;thing&quot; and &quot;that&quot; respectively) to and respectively.

==Morphology==
Norn grammar had features very similar to the other Scandinavian languages. There were two numbers, three genders and four cases (nominative, accusative, genitive and dative). The two main conjugations of verbs in present and past tense were also present. Like all other North Germanic languages (except West and South Jutlandic), it used a suffix instead of a prepositioned article to indicate definiteness as in modern Scandinavian: &#x27; (&quot;man&quot;); &#x27; (&quot;the man&quot;). Though it is difficult to be certain of many of the aspects of Norn grammar, documents indicate that it may have featured subjectless clauses, which were common in the West Scandinavian languages.

==Sample text==

The following are Norn, Old Norse and contemporary Scandinavian versions of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer:
* Orkney Norn:
:&quot;
:&quot;
:&quot;
* Shetland Norn: 
:&quot;
:&quot;
:&quot;
* Old West Norse:
:&quot;
:&quot;
:&quot;
* Faroese
:&quot;
:&quot;
:&quot;
* Icelandic
:&quot;
:&quot;
:&quot;
* Norwegian (Landsmål 1920, present-day Nynorsk)
:&quot;
:&quot;
* Swedish
:&quot;
:&quot;
:&quot; 
* Danish
:&quot;
:&quot;
:&quot;&quot; 

A Shetland &quot;guddick&quot; (riddle) in Norn, which Jakob Jakobsen heard told on Unst, the northernmost island in Shetland, in the 1890s. The same riddle is also known from the Faroe Islands, Norway, and Iceland, and a variation also occurs in England.
The answer is a cow: four teats hang, four legs walk, two horns and two ears stand skyward, two eyes show the way to the field and one tail comes shaking (dangling) behind.

==Modern use==


Most of the use of Norn/Norse in modern-day Shetland and Orkney is purely ceremonial, and mostly in Old Norse, for example the Shetland motto, &quot;&quot; &#x27;with law shall land be built&#x27;, which is the same motto used by the Icelandic police force and inspired by the medieval Norwegian Frostathing Law.

Another example of the use of Norse/Norn in the Northern Isles can be found in the names of ferries:
* NorthLink Ferries has ships named MV &quot;Hamnavoe&quot; (after the old name for Stromness), and MV &quot;Hjaltland&quot; (Shetland) and MV &quot;Hrossey&quot; (&#x27;horse island&#x27;, an old name for Mainland, Orkney).
* The Yell Sound Ferry sails from Ulsta on the island to Toft on the Shetland Mainland. The service is operated by two ferries, &quot;Daggri&quot; (Norse for &#x27;dawn&#x27;), launched in 2003 and &quot;Dagalien&quot; (Norse for &#x27;dusk&#x27;), launched in 2004.

Norn words are still used to describe many of the colour and pattern variations in the native sheep of Shetland and Orkney, which survive as the Shetland and North Ronaldsay breeds. Icelandic uses similar words for many of the same colour variations in Icelandic sheep.

There are some enthusiasts who are engaged in developing and disseminating a modern form called Nynorn (&quot;New Norn&quot;), based upon linguistic analysis of the known records and Norse linguistics in general.

In 2022 at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, as part of the Shetland 550 concert celebrating the 550th anniversary of Shetland becoming Scottish, singer Inge Thompson sang a rendition of a song in Norn.

The online translator Glosbe has Norn as a language, though due to the lack of words it acts more like a dictionary.

In 2023 the singer Siobhan Wilson released a song featuring the Norn language.

<text>Nuoro ( ; ) is a city and (municipality) in central-eastern Sardinia, Italy, situated on the slopes of Mount Ortobene. It is the capital of the province of Nuoro. With a population of 36,347 (2011), it is the sixth-largest city in Sardinia. Its (borough) of Lollove is one of (&quot;The most beautiful villages of Italy&quot;).

Birthplace of several renowned artists, including writers, poets, painters, sculptors, Nuoro hosts some of the most important museums in Sardinia. It is considered an important cultural center of the region and it has been referred to as the &quot;Sardinian Athens&quot;. Nuoro is the hometown of Grazia Deledda, the only Italian woman to win (1926) the Nobel Prize in Literature.

== History ==
The earliest traces of human settlement in the Nuoro area (called &quot; the Nuorese&quot;) are the so-called Domus de janas, rock-cut tombs dated at the third millennium BC. However, fragments of ceramics of the Ozieri culture have also been discovered and dated at c. 3500 BC.

The Nuorese was a centre of the Nuragic civilization (which developed in Sardinia from c. 1500 BC to c. 250 BC), as attested by more than 30 Nuragic sites, such has the village discovered in the countryside of Tanca Manna, just outside Nuoro, which was made of about 800 huts.

The Nuorese was crossed by a Roman road which connected Karalis (Cagliari) to Ulbia (Olbia). The legacy of the Roman colonization can especially be found in the variety of the Sardinian language which is still spoken today in Nuoro: Nuorese Sardinian is considered the most conservative dialect of Sardinian, which is in turn the most conservative Romance language.

After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Sardinia was held first by the Vandals and then by the Byzantines. According to the letters of Pope Gregory I, a Romanized and Christianized culture (that of the &quot;provinciales&quot;) co-existed with several Pagan cultures (those of the &quot;Gens Barbaricina&quot;, i.e. &quot;Barbarian People&quot;) mainly located in the island&#x27;s interior. As the Byzantine control waned, the Judicates appeared. A small village known as Nugor appears on a medieval map from 1147. In the two following centuries it grew to more than 1000 inhabitants. Nuoro remained a town of average importance under the Aragonese and Spanish domination of Sardinia, until famine and plague struck it in the late 17th century.

After the annexation to the Kingdom of Sardinia, the town became the administrative center of the area, obtaining the title of city in 1836.

<text>The  () is a 150,000-person capacity motorsports complex located in the town of Nürburg, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It features a Grand Prix race track built in 1984, and a long &quot;North loop&quot; track, built in the 1920s, around the village and medieval castle of Nürburg in the Eifel mountains. The north loop is long and contains more than of elevation change from its lowest to highest points. Scottish racing driver Jackie Stewart nicknamed the track &quot;The Green Hell&quot;.

Originally, the track featured four configurations, namely the -long (&quot;Whole Course&quot;), which in turn consisted of the (&quot;North Loop&quot;) and the (&quot;South Loop&quot;). There was also a warm-up loop called (&quot;Finish Loop&quot;) or (&quot;Concrete Loop&quot;), around the pit area.

Between 1982 and 1983, the start/finish area was demolished to create a new , which is now used for all major and international racing events. However, the shortened is still in use for racing, testing and public access.

==History==
=== 1925–1939: The beginning of the &quot;Nürburg-Ring&quot;===
In 1904, the Gordon Bennett Trophy was held on the twice-run Taunus circuit, a circuit made up of public roads starting between the towns of Wehrheim, Limburg and Saalburg, just north of Frankfurt that was long. In 1907, the Taunus circuit was re-routed and shortened to , and it was used one more time for the first Eifelrennen race, which was won by Italian ace Felice Nazzaro. In the early 1920s, ADAC Eifelrennen races were held on the twisty Nideggen public road circuit near Cologne and Bonn. Around 1925, the construction of a dedicated race track was proposed just south of the Nideggen circuit around the ancient castle of the town of Nürburg, following the examples of Italy&#x27;s Monza and Targa Florio courses, and Berlin&#x27;s AVUS, yet with a different character. The layout of the circuit in the mountains was similar to the Targa Florio event, one of the most important motor races at that time. The original Nürburgring was to be a showcase for German automotive engineering and racing talent. Construction of the track, designed by the &quot;Eichler Architekturbüro&quot; from Ravensburg (led by architect Gustav Eichler), began in September 1925.

The track was completed in spring 1927, and the ADAC Eifelrennen races were continued there. The first races to take place on 18 June 1927 showed motorcycles and sidecars, and were won by Toni Ulmen on an English 350cc Velocette. The cars followed a day later, and Rudolf Caracciola was the winner of the over–5000cc class in a supercharged Mercedes-Benz &quot;K&quot;. In addition, the track was opened to the public in the evenings and on weekends, as a one-way toll road. The entire track consisted of 174 bends (prior to 1971 changes), and averaged in width. The fastest time ever around the full &quot;Gesamtstrecke&quot; was by Louis Chiron, at an average speed of in his Bugatti.

In 1929 the full Nürburgring was used for the last time in major racing events, as future Grands Prix would be held only on the &quot;Nordschleife&quot;. Motorcycles and minor races primarily used the shorter and safer &quot;Südschleife&quot;. Memorable pre-war races at the circuit featured the talents of early &quot;Ringmeister&quot; (Ringmasters) such as Rudolf Caracciola, Tazio Nuvolari, and Bernd Rosemeyer.

===1947–1970: &quot;The Green Hell&quot;===


After World War II, racing resumed in 1947, and in 1951, the &quot;Nordschleife&quot; of the Nürburgring again became the main venue for the German Grand Prix as part of the Formula One World Championship (with the exception of 1959, when it was held on the AVUS in Berlin). A new group of &quot;Ringmeister&quot; arose to dominate the race – Alberto Ascari, Juan Manuel Fangio, Stirling Moss, Jim Clark, John Surtees, Jackie Stewart and Jacky Ickx.

On 5 August 1961, during practice for the 1961 German Grand Prix, Phil Hill became the first person to complete a lap of the &quot;Nordschleife&quot; in under 9 minutes, with a lap of 8 minutes 55.2 seconds (153.4 km/h or 95.3 mph) in the Ferrari 156 &quot;Sharknose&quot; Formula One car. Over half a century later, even the highest performing road cars still have difficulty breaking 8 minutes without a professional race driver or one very familiar with the track. Also, several rounds of the German motorcycle Grand Prix were held, mostly on the &quot;Südschleife&quot;, but the Hockenheimring and the Solitudering were the main sites for Grand Prix motorcycle racing.

In 1953, the ADAC 1000 km Nürburgring race was introduced, an Endurance race and Sports car racing event that counted towards the World Sportscar Championship for decades. The 24 Hours Nürburgring for touring car racing was added in 1970.

By the late 1960s, the &quot;Nordschleife&quot; and many other tracks were becoming increasingly dangerous for the latest generation of F1 cars. In 1967, a chicane was added before the start/finish straight, called &quot;Hohenrain&quot;, in order to reduce speeds at the pit lane entry. This made the track longer. Even this change, however, was not enough to keep Stewart from nicknaming it &quot;The Green Hell&quot; () following his victory in the 1968 German Grand Prix amid a driving rainstorm and thick fog. In 1970, after the fatal crash of Piers Courage at Zandvoort, the F1 drivers decided at the French Grand Prix to boycott the Nürburgring unless major changes were made, as they had done at Spa the year before. The changes were not possible on short notice, and the German GP was moved to the Hockenheimring, which had already been modified.

===1971–1983: Changes===

In accordance with the demands of the F1 drivers, the &quot;Nordschleife&quot; was reconstructed by taking out some bumps, smoothing out some sudden jumps (particularly at Brünnchen), and installing Armco safety barriers. The track was made straighter, following the race line, which reduced the number of corners. The German GP could be hosted at the Nürburgring again, and was for another six years from 1971 to 1976.

In 1973 the entrance into the dangerous and bumpy Kallenhard corner was made slower by adding another left-hand corner after the fast Metzgesfeld sweeping corner. Safety was improved again later on by removing the jumps on the long main straight and widening it. They also took away the bushes right next to the track at the main straight, which had made that section of the Nürburgring dangerously narrow. A second series of three more F1 races was held until 1976. However, primarily due to its length of over , and the lack of space due to its situation on the sides of the mountains, increasing demands by the F1 drivers and the FIA&#x27;s CSI commission were too expensive or impossible to meet. For instance, by the 1970s the German Grand Prix required five times the marshals and medical staff as a typical F1 race, something the German organizers were unwilling to provide. Additionally, even with the 1971 modifications it was still possible for cars to become airborne off the track. The Nürburgring was also unsuitable for the burgeoning television market; its vast expanse made it almost impossible to effectively cover a race there. As a result, early in the season it was decided that the 1976 race would be the last to be held on the old circuit.

Niki Lauda, the reigning world champion and only person ever to lap the full &quot;Nordschleife&quot; in under seven minutes (6:58.6, 1975), proposed to the other drivers that they boycott the circuit in 1976. Lauda was not only concerned about the safety arrangements and the lack of marshals around the circuit, he also did not like the prospect of running the race in another rainstorm. Usually when that happened, some parts of the circuit were wet and other parts were dry, which is what the conditions of the circuit were for that race. The other drivers voted against the idea and the race went ahead. Lauda crashed in his Ferrari coming out of the left-hand kink before Bergwerk after a new magnesium component (lighter but more fragile than aluminum used until then) on his Ferrari&#x27;s rear suspension failed. He was badly burned as his car was still loaded with fuel in lap 2. Lauda was saved by the combined actions of fellow drivers Arturo Merzario, Guy Edwards, Brett Lunger, Emerson Fittipaldi and Harald Ertl.

The crash also showed that the track&#x27;s distances were too long for regular fire engines and ambulances, even though the &quot;ONS-Staffel&quot; was equipped with a Porsche 911 rescue car, marked (R). The old Nürburgring never hosted another F1 race again, as the German Grand Prix was moved to the Hockenheimring for 1977. The German motorcycle Grand Prix was held for the last time on the old Nürburgring in 1980, also permanently moving to Hockenheim.

By its very nature, the &quot;Nordschleife&quot; was impossible to make safe in its old configuration. It soon became apparent that it would have to be completely overhauled if there was any prospect of Formula One returning there - the Nürburgring&#x27;s administration and race organizers were not willing to provide the enormous expense of providing the number of marshals needed for a Grand Prix - up to six times the amount that most other circuits needed. With this in mind, in 1981 work began on a -long new circuit, which was built on and around the old pit area.

At the same time, a bypass shortened the &quot;Nordschleife&quot; to , and with an additional small pit lane, this version was used for races in 1983, e.g. the 1000km Nürburgring endurance race, while construction work was going on nearby. During qualifying for that race, the late Stefan Bellof set a lap of 6:11.13 for the &quot;Nordschleife&quot; in his Porsche 956, or on average. This lap held the all-time record for 35 years (partially because no major racing has taken place there since 1984) until it was surpassed by Timo Bernhard in the Porsche 919 Hybrid Evo, which ran the slightly longer version of the circuit in 5:19.546- averaging on 29 June 2018.

Meanwhile, more run-off areas were added at corners like Aremberg and Brünnchen, where originally there were just embankments protected by Armco barriers. The track surface was made safer in some spots where there had been nasty bumps and jumps. Racing line markers were added to the corners all around the track as well. Also, bushes and hedges at the edges of corners were taken out and replaced with Armco and grass.

The former &quot;Südschleife&quot; had not been modified in 1970–1971 and was abandoned a few years later in favour of the improved &quot;Nordschleife&quot;. It is now mostly gone (in part due to the construction of the new circuit) or converted to a normal public road, but since 2005 a vintage car event has been hosted on the old track layout, including part of the parking area.

===1984: New Grand Prix track===

The new track was completed in 1984 and named &quot;GP-Strecke&quot; (: literally, &quot;Grand Prix Course&quot;). It was built to meet the highest safety standards. However, it was considered in character a mere shadow of its older sibling. Some fans, who had to sit much farther away from the track, called it &quot;Eifelring&quot;, &quot;Ersatzring&quot;, &quot;Grünering&quot; or similar nicknames, believing it did not deserve to be called Nürburgring. Like many circuits of the time, it offered few overtaking opportunities.

Prior to the 2013 German Grand Prix both Mark Webber and Lewis Hamilton said they liked the track. Webber described the layout as &quot;an old school track&quot; before adding, &quot;It&#x27;s a beautiful little circuit for us to still drive on so I think all the guys enjoy driving here.&quot; While Hamilton said &quot;It&#x27;s a fantastic circuit, one of the classics and it hasn&#x27;t lost that feel of an old classic circuit.&quot;

To celebrate its opening, an exhibition race was held on 12 May. The 1984 Nürburgring Race of Champions featured an array of notable drivers driving identical Mercedes 190E 2.3–16&#x27;s: the line-up was Elio de Angelis, Jack Brabham (Formula 1 World Champion 1959, 1960, 1966), Phil Hill (1961), Denis Hulme (1967), James Hunt (1976), Alan Jones (1980), Jacques Laffite, Niki Lauda (1975, 1977)*, Stirling Moss, Alain Prost*, Carlos Reutemann, Keke Rosberg (1982), Jody Scheckter (1979), Ayrton Senna*, John Surtees (1964) and John Watson. [Drivers marked with * won the Formula 1 World Championship subsequent to the race]. Senna won ahead of Lauda, Reutemann, Rosberg, Watson, Hulme and Jody Scheckter, being the only one to resist Lauda&#x27;s performance who – having missed the qualifying – had to start from the last row and overtook all the others except Senna. There were nine former and two future Formula 1 World Champions competing, in a field of 20 cars with 16 Formula 1 drivers; the other four were local drivers: Klaus Ludwig, Manfred Schurti, Udo Schütz and Hans Herrmann.

Besides other major international events, the Nürburgring has seen the brief return of Formula One racing, as the 1984 European Grand Prix was held at the track, followed by the 1985 German Grand Prix. As F1 did not stay, other events are now the highlights at the new Nürburgring, including the 1000km Nürburgring, DTM, motorcycles, and newer types of events, like truck racing, vintage car racing at the AvD &quot;Oldtimer Grand Prix&quot;, and even the &quot;Rock am Ring&quot; concerts.

Following the success and first world championship of Michael Schumacher, a second German F1 race was held at the Nürburgring between 1995 and 2006, called the European Grand Prix, or in 1997 and 1998, the Luxembourg Grand Prix.

For 2002, the track was changed, by replacing the former &quot;Castrol-chicane&quot; at the end of the start/finish straight with a sharp right-hander (nicknamed &quot;Haug-Hook&quot;), in order to create an overtaking opportunity. Also, a slow Omega-shaped section was inserted, on the site of the former kart track. This extended the GP track from , while at the same time, the Hockenheimring was shortened from .

Both the Nürburgring and the Hockenheimring events have been losing money due to high and rising Formula One license fees charged by Bernie Ecclestone and low attendance due to high ticket prices; starting with the 2007 Formula One season, Hockenheim and Nürburgring alternated in hosting the German GP.

In Formula One, Ralf Schumacher collided with his teammate Giancarlo Fisichella and his brother at the start of the 1997 race which was won by Jacques Villeneuve. In 1999, in changing conditions, Johnny Herbert managed to score the only win for the team of former &quot;Ringmeister&quot; Jackie Stewart. One of the highlights of the 2005 season was Kimi Räikkönen&#x27;s spectacular exit while in the last lap of the race, when his suspension gave way after being rattled lap after lap by a flat-spotted tyre that was not changed due to the short-lived &#x27;one set of tyres&#x27; rule.

Prior to the 2007 European Grand Prix, the &quot;Audi S&quot; (turns 8 and 9) was renamed &quot;Michael Schumacher S&quot; after Michael Schumacher. Schumacher had retired from Formula One the year before, but returned in 2010, and in 2011 became the second Formula One driver to drive through a turn named after them (after Ayrton Senna driving his &quot;S for Senna&quot; at Autódromo José Carlos Pace). 

===Alternation with Hockenheim===

In 2007, the FIA announced that Hockenheimring and Nürburgring would alternate with the German Grand Prix with Nürburgring hosting in 2007. Due to name-licensing problems, it was held as the European Grand Prix that year. In 2014, the new owners of the Nürburgring were unable to secure a deal to continue hosting the German Grand Prix in the odd-numbered years, so the 2015 and 2017 German Grands Prix were cancelled.
===Return of Formula One===
In July 2020, it was announced that after seven years, the race track would be an official Formula One Grand Prix with the event taking place from 9 to 11 October 2020. This race was called the Eifel Grand Prix in honour of the nearby mountain range, meaning the venue held a Grand Prix under a fourth different name having hosted races under the German, European and Luxembourg Grands Prix titles previously. That race was won by Lewis Hamilton, who equalled Michael Schumacher&#x27;s record of wins.

===Fatal accidents===

While it is unusual for deaths to occur during sanctioned races, there are many accidents and several deaths each year during public sessions. It is common for the track to be closed several times a day for cleanup, repair, and medical intervention. While track management does not publish any official figures, several regular visitors to the track have used police reports to estimate the number of fatalities as between 3 and 12 in a full year. Jeremy Clarkson noted in &quot;Top Gear&quot; in 2004 that &quot;over the years this track has claimed over 200 lives&quot;.

==Racing==

===&quot;Nordschleife&quot; racing today===
Several touring car series still compete on the &quot;Nordschleife&quot;, using either only the simple version with its separate small pit lane, or a combined -long track that uses a part of the original modern F1 track (without the Mercedes Arena section, which is often used for support pits) plus its huge pit facilities. Entry-level competition requires a regularity test (GLP) for street-legal cars. Two racing series (RCN/CHC and VLN) compete on 15 Saturdays each year, for several hours.

The annual highlight is the 24 Hours Nürburgring weekend, held usually in mid-May, featuring 220 cars – from small cars to Turbo Porsche cars or factory race cars built by BMW, Opel, Audi, and Mercedes-Benz, over 700 drivers (amateurs and professionals), and up to 290,000 spectators.

As of 2015 the World Touring Car Championship holds the FIA WTCC Race of Germany at the Nordschleife as a support category to the 24 Hours.

BMW Sauber&#x27;s Nick Heidfeld made history on 28 April 2007 as the first driver in over thirty years to tackle the Nürburgring &quot;Nordschleife&quot; track in a contemporary Formula One car. Heidfeld&#x27;s three laps in an F1.06 were part of festivities celebrating BMW&#x27;s contribution to motorsport. About 45,000 spectators showed up for the main event, the third four-hour VLN race of the season. Conceived largely as a photo opportunity, the lap times were not as fast as the car was capable of, BMW instead needing to run the chassis at a particularly high ride height to allow for the &quot;Nordschleife&quot; abrupt gradient changes and to limit maximum speeds accordingly. Former F1 driver Hans-Joachim Stuck was injured during the race when he crashed his BMW Z4.

As part of the festivities before the 2013 24 Hours Nürburgring race, Michael Schumacher and other Mercedes-Benz drivers took part in a promotional event which saw Schumacher complete a demonstration lap of the Nordschleife at the wheel of a 2011 Mercedes W02. As with Heidfeld&#x27;s lap, and also partly due to Formula One&#x27;s strict in-season testing bans, the lap left many motorsport fans underwhelmed.

==Public access==
===&quot;Nordschleife&quot;===
Since its opening in 1927, the track has been used by the public for the so-called &quot;Touristenfahrten&quot;: anyone with a road-legal car or motorcycle, as well as tour buses, motor homes, or cars with trailers, are able to access the Nordschleife. It is open every day from mid-March through mid-November, except when racing takes place. The track is not open to the public during the winter, when construction work is ongoing or in the event of bad weather. Passing on the right is prohibited, and some sections have speed limits; the normal traffic rules (StVO in German) apply also here.


The Nürburgring is a popular attraction for many driving enthusiasts and riders from all over the world, partly because of its history and the challenge it provides. The lack of oncoming traffic and intersections sets it apart from regular roads, and the absence of a blanket speed limit is a further attraction.

Normal ticket buyers on tourist days cannot quite complete a full lap of the &quot;Nordschleife&quot;, which bypasses the modern &quot;GP-Strecke&quot;, as they are required to slow down and pass through a &quot;pit lane&quot; section where toll gates are installed. On busier days, a mobile ticket barrier is installed on the main straight in order to reduce the length of queues at the fixed barriers. This is open to all ticket holders. On rare occasions, it is possible to drive both the &quot;Nordschleife&quot; and the Grand Prix circuit combined.

Drivers interested in lap times often time themselves from the first bridge after the barriers to the last gantry (aka Bridge-to-Gantry or BTG time) before the exit. However, the track&#x27;s general conditions state that any form of racing, including speed record attempts, is forbidden. The driver&#x27;s insurance coverage may consequently be voided, leaving the driver fully liable for damage. Normal, non-racing, non-timed driving accidents might be covered by driver&#x27;s insurance, but it is increasingly common for insurers to insert exclusion clauses that mean drivers and riders on the Nürburgring only have third-party coverage or are not covered at all.

Drivers who have crashed into the barriers, suffered mechanical failure or been otherwise required to be towed off track during &quot;Touristenfahrten&quot; sessions are referred to as having joined the &quot;Bongard Club&quot;. This nickname is derived from the name of the company which operates the large yellow recovery flatbed trucks which ferry those unfortunate drivers and their vehicles to the nearest exit. Due to the high volume of traffic, there is an emphasis on quickly clearing and repairing any compromised safety measures so the track can be immediately re-opened for use.

Additionally, those found responsible for damage to the track or safety barriers are required to pay for repairs, along with the time and cost associated with personnel and equipment to address those damages, making any accident or breakdown a potentially expensive incident. Because it is technically operated as a public toll road, failing to report an accident or instance where track surfaces are affected is considered to be an instance of unlawfully leaving the scene of an accident. This is all part of the rules and regulations which aim to ensure a safe experience for all visitors to the track.

On 20 February 2025, the administration of the circuit decided to forbid motorcycles during public Touristenfahrten tourist laps starting from the opening of the 2025 season.
The entire Nürburgring was open to the public from its initial opening. At several points around the circuit there were access roads and toll points from which drivers and riders could begin or end a drive. The had one of these at the bottom of the uphill stretch near .

==Commercial aspects==
===Production car testing===
For decades, automotive media outlets and manufacturers have used lap times on the Nordschleife as a standard to measure the performance of production vehicles. A car&#x27;s time on the circuit is commonly used as a benchmark for its overall performance, and cars from disparate marques or time periods may be directly compared via their lap times. Since 2019, two times have been recorded: one for the whole length of the track, and another for a traditional, slightly truncated layout. Nordschleife test cars are piloted by experienced test drivers with intricate knowledge of the circuit, and are often variants specially prepared for circuit racing, as is the case with the Lexus LFA&#x27;s &quot;Nürburgring package&quot;.

For sixteen weeks per year, the &quot;industry pool&quot; () rents exclusive daytime use of the track for automotive development and endurance testing. the industry pool consisted of approximately 30 car manufacturers, associations, and component suppliers. By 2019, the track was being rented by the industry pool for 18 weeks per year.

Some journalists have opined that Nordschleife testing is deleterious to a car&#x27;s normal driving experience, producing cars that have sacrificed comfort and driveability in favor of better lap times. Former &quot;Top Gear&quot; host James May, who is known for his open dislike of testing run on the track, has claimed that the Nürburgring prompts designers to focus on a car&#x27;s grip at the expense of pleasant-feeling handling, and creates cars that are ill-suited for real-world driving conditions. Others have expressed concern over the relevance of these test laps, which lack independent verification and may be conducted using cars significantly different from stock. Porsche is reported as having tried—and failed—to replicate the Nissan GT-R Nismo&#x27;s record-breaking lap, preparing its own GT-R test car for the task, and the Lamborghini Huracán Performante&#x27;s time was met with incredulity even after Lamborghini provided video documentation.

===Television and games===
The TV series &quot;Top Gear&quot; sometimes used the &quot;Nordschleife&quot; for its challenges, often involving Sabine Schmitz. The first corner of the &quot;Nordschleife&quot; loop was renamed as the &quot;Sabine-Schmitz-Kurve&quot; in Schmitz&#x27;s honor after she died of cancer in 2021. In addition, during series 17 (summer 2011) of &quot;Top Gear&quot;, James May was very critical of the ride quality of cars whose development processes included testing on the &quot;Nordschleife&quot;, saying that cars which were tested at Nordschleife got ruined.

Multiple layouts of the Nürburgring have been featured in video games, such as the &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; series, the &quot;Forza Motorsport&quot; series, the &quot;Need for Speed: Shift&quot; series, &quot;iRacing&quot; and &quot;Assetto Corsa&quot;. &quot;Grand Prix Legends&quot;, a historic racing simulator also included the Nürburgring on its roster of default Grand Prix tracks.

===Leisure development===
Other pastimes are hosted at the Nürburgring, such as the Rock am Ring, Germany&#x27;s biggest rock music festival, attracting close to 100,000 rock fans each year since 1985. Since 1978, the &quot;Nordschleife&quot; is also the venue of a major running event (&quot;Nürburgring-Lauf/Run am Ring&quot;). In 2003, a major bicycling event (&quot;Rad am Ring&quot;) was added and it became the multi-sports event &quot;Rad &amp; Run am Ring&quot;.

In 2009, new commercial areas opened, including a hotel and shopping mall. In the summer of 2009, ETF Ride Systems opened a new interactive dark ride application called &quot;Motor Mania&quot; at the racetrack, in collaboration with Lagotronics B.V. The roller coaster &quot;ring°racer&quot; was scheduled to open in 2011, but was delayed significantly due to technical issues. It eventually opened on 31 October 2013 and was closed after just four days of operation on 3 November 2013.

===Ownership===
In 2012, the track was preparing to file for bankruptcy as a result of nearly $500 million in debts and the inability to secure financing. On 1 August 2012, the government of Rheinland-Pfalz guaranteed $312 million to allow the track to meet its debt obligations.

In 2013, the Nürburgring was for sale for US$165 million (€127.3 million). The sale process was by sealed-bid auction with an expected completion date of &quot;Late Summer&quot;. This meant there was to be a new owner in 2013, unencumbered by the debts of the previous operation, with the circuit expected to return to profitability.

On 11 March 2014 it was reported that the Nürburgring was sold for 77 million euros ($106.8 million). Düsseldorf-based Capricorn Development was the buyer. The company was to take full ownership of the Nürburgring on 1 January 2015. But in October 2014, Russian billionaire, the chairman of Moscow-based Pharmstandard, Viktor Kharitonin, bought a majority stake in the Nürburgring.

In May 2015, the Nürburgring was set to hold the first Grüne Hölle Rock festival as a replacement for the Rock am Ring festival, but the project did not take place. Grüne Hölle Rock changed their name to Rock im Revier and the event was held in the Schalke area.

==Layout==
===&quot;Nordschleife&quot;===
The &quot;Nordschleife&quot; operates in a clockwise direction, and was formerly known for its abundance of sharp crests, causing fast-moving, firmly-sprung racing cars to jump clear off the track surface at many locations.

====&quot;Flugplatz&quot; (&quot;air field&quot;, a small airport)====
Although by no means the most fearsome, &quot;Flugplatz&quot; is perhaps the most aptly (although coincidentally) named and widely remembered section. The name of this part of the track comes from a small airfield, which in the early years was located close to the track in this area. The track features a very short straight that climbs sharply uphill for a short time, then suddenly drops slightly downhill, and this is immediately followed by two very fast right-hand kinks. Chris Irwin&#x27;s career was ended following a massive accident at &quot;Flugplatz&quot;, in a Ford 3L GT sports car in 1968. Manfred Winkelhock flipped his March Formula Two car at the same corner in 1980. This section of the track was renovated in 2016 after an accident in which Jann Mardenborough&#x27;s Nissan GT-R flew over the fence and killed a spectator. The &quot;Flugplatz&quot; is one of the most important parts of the Nürburgring because after the two very fast right-handers comes what is possibly the fastest part of the track: a downhill straight called &quot;Kottenborn&quot;, into a very fast curve called &quot;Schwedenkreuz&quot; (Swedish Cross). Drivers are flat out (full-speed) for some time here.

Right before &quot;Flugplatz&quot; is &quot;Quiddelbacher-Höhe&quot; (peak, as in &quot;mountain summit&quot;), where the track crosses a bridge over the Bundesstraße 257.

====&quot;Fuchsröhre&quot; (&quot;Fox Hole&quot;)====
The &quot;Fuchsröhre&quot; is soon after the very fast downhill section succeeding the &quot;Flugplatz&quot;. After negotiating a long right-hand corner called &quot;Aremberg&quot; (which is after &quot;Schwedenkreuz&quot;) the road goes under a bridge &quot;Postbrucke&quot; as it plunges downhill, and the road switches back left and right and finding a point of reference for the racing line is difficult. This whole sequence is flat out and then, the road climbs sharply uphill. The road then turns left and levels out at the same time; this is one of the many jumps of the Nürburgring where the car goes airborne. This leads to the &quot;Adenauer Forst&quot; (forest) turns. The &quot;Fuchsröhre&quot; is one of the fastest and most dangerous parts of the Nürburgring because of the extremely high speeds in such a tight and confined place; this part of the Nürburgring goes right through a forest and there is only about of grass separating the track from Armco barrier, and beyond the barriers is a wall of trees.

====&quot;Bergwerk&quot; (&quot;Mine&quot;)====

Perhaps the most notorious corner on the long circuit, &quot;Bergwerk&quot; has been responsible for some serious and sometimes fatal accidents. A tight right-hand corner, coming just after a long, fast section and a left-hand kink on a small crest, was where Carel Godin de Beaufort fatally crashed. The fast kink was also the scene of Niki Lauda&#x27;s infamous fiery accident during the 1976 German Grand Prix. This left kink is often referred to as the &quot;Lauda-Links&quot; (Lauda left). The &quot;Bergwerk&quot;, along with the &quot;Breidscheid&quot;/&quot;Adenauer&quot; Bridge corners before it, are one of the series of corners that make or break one&#x27;s lap time around the Nürburgring because of the fast, lengthy uphill section called &quot;Kesselchen&quot; (Little Valley) that comes after the &quot;Bergwerk&quot;.

====Caracciola &quot;Karussell&quot; (&quot;Carousel&quot;)====

Although being one of the slower corners on the &quot;Nordschleife&quot;, the &quot;Karussell&quot; is perhaps its most famous and one of its most iconic- it is one of two berm-style, banked corners on the track. Soon after the driver has negotiated the long uphill section after &quot;Bergwerk&quot; and gone through a section called &quot;Klostertal&quot; (Monastery Valley), the driver turns right through a long hairpin, past an abandoned section called &quot;Steilstrecke&quot; (Steep Route) and then goes up another hill towards the &quot;Karrusell&quot;. The entrance to the corner is blind, although Juan Manuel Fangio is reputed to have advised a young driver to &quot;aim for the tallest tree,&quot; a feature that was also built into the rendering of the circuit in the &quot;Gran Turismo 4&quot; and &quot;Grand Prix Legends&quot; video games. Once the driver has reached the top of the hill, the road then becomes sharply banked on one side and level on the other- this banking drops off, rather than climbing up like most bankings on circuits. The sharply banked side has a concrete surface, and there is a foot-wide tarmac surface on the bottom of the banking for cars to get extra grip through the very rough concrete banking. Cars drop into the concrete banking, and keep the car in the corner (which is 210 degrees, much like a hairpin bend) until the road levels out and the concrete surface becomes tarmac again. This corner is very hard on the driver&#x27;s wrists and hands because of the prolonged bumpy cornering the driver must do while in the &quot;Karrusell&quot;. Usually, cars come out of the top of the end of the banking to hit the apex that comes right after the end of the &quot;Karrusell&quot;.

The combination of a recognisable corner, slow-moving cars, and the variation in viewing angle as cars rotate around the banking, means that this is one of the circuit&#x27;s most popular locations for photographers. It is named after German pre-WWII racing driver Rudolf Caracciola, who reportedly made the corner his own by hooking the inside tires into a drainage ditch to help his car &quot;hug&quot; the curve. As more concrete was uncovered and more competitors copied him, the trend took hold. At a later reconstruction, the corner was remade with real concrete banking, as it remains to this day.

Shortly after the &quot;Karussell&quot; is a steep section, with gradients in excess of 16%, leading to a right-hander called &quot;Hohe Acht&quot;, which is some 300 m higher in altitude than &quot;Breidscheid&quot;.

====&quot;Brünnchen&quot; (&quot;Small Well&quot;)====
A favourite spectator vantage point, the &quot;Brünnchen&quot; section is composed of two right-hand corners and a very short straight. The first corner goes sharply downhill and the next, after the very short downhill straight, goes uphill slightly. This is a section of the track where on public days, accidents happen particularly at the blind uphill right-hand corner. Like almost every corner at the Nürburgring, both right-handers are blind. The short straight used to have a steep and sudden drop-off that caused cars to take off and a bridge that went over a pathway; these were taken out and smoothed over when the circuit was rebuilt in 1970 and 1971. The uphill right-hand corner is often referred to as &quot;Youtube corner&quot;, because of the large number of videos featuring a perspective of that corner.

====&quot;Pflanzgarten&quot; (&quot;Planting Garden&quot;) and &quot;Stefan Bellof S&quot; (&quot;Stefan Bellof Esses&quot;)====

The &quot;Pflanzgarten&quot;, which is soon after the &quot;Brünnchen&quot;, is one of the fastest, trickiest and most difficult sections of the Nürburgring. It is full of jumps, including two huge ones, one of which is called &quot;Sprunghügel&quot; (Jump Hill). This very complex section is unique in that it is made up of two different sections; getting the entire &quot;Pflanzgarten&quot; right is crucial to a good lap time around the Nürburgring. This section was the scene of Briton Peter Collins&#x27;s fatal accident during the 1958 German Grand Prix, and the scene of a number of career-ending accidents in Formula One in the 1970s —Britons Mike Hailwood and Ian Ashley were two victims of the Pflanzgarten.

&quot;Pflanzgarten 1&quot; is made up of a slightly banked, downhill left-hander which then suddenly switches back left, then right. Then immediately, giving the driver nearly no time to react (knowledge of this section is key) the road drops away twice: the first jump is only slight, then right after (somewhat like a staircase) the road drops away very sharply which usually causes almost all cars to go airborne at this jump; the drop is so sudden. Then, immediately after the road levels out very shortly after the jump and the car touches the ground again, the road immediately and suddenly goes right very quickly and then right again; this is what makes up the end of the first &quot;Pflanzgarten&quot;- a very fast multiple apex sequence of right-hand corners.

The road then goes slightly uphill and then through another jump; the road suddenly drops away and levels out and at the same time, the road turns through a flat-out left-hander. Then, the road drops away again very suddenly, which is the second huge jump of the &quot;Pflanzgarten&quot; known as the &quot;Sprunghügel&quot;. The road then goes downhill then quickly levels out, then it goes through a flat-out right-hander and this starts the &quot;Stefan Bellof S&quot; (named as such because Bellof crashed a Porsche 956 there during the 1983 Nurburgring 1000 km), which was known as &quot;Pflanzgarten 2&quot; prior to 2013. The &quot;Stefan Bellof S&quot; is very tricky because the road quickly switches back left and right—a car is going so fast through here that it is like walking on a tightrope. It is very difficult to find the racing line here because the curves come up so quickly, so it is hard to find any point of reference. Then, after a jump at the end of the switchback section, it goes through a flat-out, top gear right-hander and into a short straight that leads into two very fast curves called the &quot;Schwalbenschwanz&quot; (Swallow&#x27;s Tail).

The room for error on every part of the consistently high-speed &quot;Pflanzgarten&quot; and the &quot;Stefan Bellof S&quot; is virtually non-existent (much like the entire track itself). The road and the surface of the &quot;Pflanzgarten&quot; and the &quot;Stefan Bellof S&quot; moves around unpredictably; knowledge of this section is key to getting through cleanly.

====&quot;Schwalbenschwanz/Kleines Karussell&quot; (&quot;Swallow&#x27;s Tail&quot;/&quot;Little Carousel&quot;)====
The &quot;Schwalbenschwanz&quot; is a sequence of very fast sweepers located after the &quot;Stefan Bellof S&quot;. After a short straight, there is a very fast right-hand sweeper that progressively goes uphill, and this leads into a blind left-hander that is a bit slower. The apex is completely blind, and the corner then changes gradient a bit; it goes up then down, which leads into a short straight that ends at the &quot;Kleines Karussell&quot;. Originally, this part had a bridge that went over a stream and was very bumpy; this bridge was taken out and replaced with a culvert (large industrial pipe) so that the road could be smoothed over.

The &quot;Kleines Karussell&quot; is similar to its bigger brother, except that it is a 90-degree corner instead of 210 degrees, and is faster and slightly less banked. Once this part of the track is dealt with, the drivers are near the end of the lap; with two more corners &quot;Galgenkopf&quot; to negotiate before the long &quot;Döttinger Höhe&quot; straight.

===&quot;Südschleife&quot; layout===
The Nürburgring &quot;Südschleife&quot; (south loop) was a motor racing circuit which was built in 1927 at the same time as the &quot;Nordschleife&quot;.

The &quot;Südschleife&quot; and &quot;Nordschleife&quot; layouts were joined together by the &quot;Start und Ziel&quot; (start/finish) area, and could therefore be driven as one track that was over long. Races were held at the combined layout only until 1931. The &quot;Südschleife&quot; was used for the ADAC Eifelrennen from 1928 until 1931 and from 1958 until 1968, as well as for the Eifelpokal and other minor races.

The &quot;Südschleife&quot; was rarely used after the &quot;Nordschleife&quot; was rebuilt and updated in 1970 and 1971, and was finally destroyed by the building of the current Nürburgring Grand Prix circuit in the early 1980s. Today only small sections of the original track remain.

=== Track description ===
The shared start/finish area of the Nürburgring complex consisted of two back-to-back straights joined together at the southern end by a tight loop. The entrance to the &quot;Südschleife&quot; lay on the outside edge of this hairpin and was signposted as the road to Bonn. It immediately dropped sharply downhill and under a public road before winding through a heavily-wooded section.

Tight corners soon gave way to fast downhill sections with flowing bends until, at the outskirts of the nearby town of Müllenbach, the track turned sharply right northwards and began a long climb up the hill.

At the end of this run came a right hairpin turn which led to a long left curve around the bottom of a hill. This led onto the back straight of the start/finish area. At this point it was possible to continue onto the &quot;Nordschleife&quot; or take two sharp right-hand turns in order to enter the starting straight once again.

Photographs of the track in use show that trees and hedges were not cut back in many areas, being allowed to grow right up to the trackside. Although the &quot;Nordschleife&quot; had very little in the way of run-off areas, the &quot;Südschleife&quot; seems to have had none at all, which was likely to have been a factor in the choice of circuit for major events.

===Sections of routes===
The route sections bore the following names, among others &quot;Bränkekopf&quot;, &quot;Aschenschlag&quot;, &quot;Seifgen&quot;, &quot;Bocksberg&quot;, &quot;Müllenbach&quot; und &quot;Scharfer Kopf&quot;.

=== Stichstraße shortcut ===
In 1938 a small section of new track (the &quot;Stichstraße&quot;) was laid which allowed drivers nearing the end of the &quot;Südschleife&quot; to bypass the start/finish straights and take a right turn which led back to the start of the downhill twists. This shortened a lap to around . This layout was used for tourist rides and for testing.

===Remaining sections===
The current Grand Prix circuit required the complete destruction of the start/finish area but at a point around into the &quot;Südschleife&quot;, a modern public road now follows the route, although the bends have been eased and the vegetation does not come as close to the road as it did when the track was open.

This public road continues into the town of Müllenbach but leaves the route of the old track on the outskirts. Nothing remains of the famous corners there.

The road up the hill still exists and is sometimes used to allow access to parking areas for the Grand Prix track. The lower sections are no longer maintained.

Surviving sections, and the parking lots, are still used in competition. The Cologne-Ahrweiler Rally often uses the Südschleife in competition.

==Climate==
The Nürburgring is known for its frequently changing weather. The near-fatal accident of Niki Lauda in 1976 was accompanied by poor weather conditions and also the 2007 Grand Prix race saw an early deluge take several cars out through aquaplaning, with Vitantonio Liuzzi making a lucky escape, hitting a retrieving truck with the rear wing first, rather than the fatal accident that befell Jules Bianchi seven years later at Suzuka. In spite of this reputation, the Nürburg weather station only recorded an average of between 1981 and 2010. Contrasting this, the relatively nearby Ardennes racetrack of Spa-Francorchamps in Wallonia, Belgium has a much rainier climate, as can be implied by data from the village hosting the track called Stavelot and the village of Malmedy, through which the circuit passes.

Nürburg has a semi-continental climate with both oceanic and continental tendencies. It does however land in the former category (Köppen &quot;Cfb&quot;). Due to the Nordschleife&#x27;s varied terrain and elevation, weather may be completely different on either end of the track. The elevation shift also makes thermal differences a strong possibility. The modern Grand Prix circuit also has sizeable elevation changes between the start-finish straight and the lowest point on the opposite end of the track, but the geographical distance and actual elevation gain between the two are lower. Annual sunshine is in the 1500s, which is low by European standards, but only slightly gloomier than the nearest large city of Cologne located on a plain. Contrasting that, Nürburg has cooler weather year-round due to the higher elevation of the Eifel Mountains than the Rhine Valley.

<doc id="22126" wikidata="Q39061" url="?curid=22126" title="Northern Hemisphere">
<text>The Northern Hemisphere is the half of Earth that is north of the equator. For other planets in the Solar System, north is defined by humans as being in the same celestial hemisphere relative to the invariable plane of the Solar System as Earth&#x27;s North Pole.

Due to Earth&#x27;s axial tilt of 23.439281°, there is a seasonal variation in the lengths of the day and night. There is also a seasonal variation in temperatures, which lags the variation in day and night. Conventionally, winter in the Northern Hemisphere is taken as the period from the December solstice (typically December 21 UTC) to the March equinox (typically March 20 UTC), while summer is taken as the period from the June solstice through to the September equinox (typically on 23 September UTC). The dates vary each year due to the difference between the calendar year and the astronomical year. Within the Northern Hemisphere, oceanic currents can change the weather patterns that affect many factors within the north coast. Such events include El Niño–Southern Oscillation.

Trade winds blow from east to west just above the equator. The winds pull surface water with them, creating currents, which flow westward due to the Coriolis effect. The currents then bend to the right, heading north. At about 30 degrees north latitude, a different set of winds, the westerlies, push the currents back to the east, producing a closed clockwise loop.

Its surface is 60.7% water, compared with 80.9% water in the case of the Southern Hemisphere, and it contains 67.3% of Earth&#x27;s land. The continents of North America and mainland Eurasia are located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere, together with about two-thirds of Africa and a small part of South America.

==Geography and climate==
During the 2.5 million years of the Pleistocene, numerous cold phases called glacials (Quaternary ice age), or significant advances of continental ice sheets, in Europe and North America, occurred at intervals of approximately 40,000 to 100,000 years. The long glacial periods were separated by more temperate and shorter interglacials which lasted about 10,000–15,000 years. The last cold episode of the last glacial period ended about 10,000 years ago. Earth is currently in an interglacial period of the Quaternary, called the Holocene. The glaciations that occurred during the glacial period covered many areas of the Northern Hemisphere.
The Arctic is a region around the North Pole (90° latitude). Its climate is characterized by cold winters and cool summers. Precipitation mostly comes in the form of snow. Areas inside the Arctic Circle (66°34′ latitude) experience some days in summer when the Sun never sets, and some days during the winter when it never rises. The duration of these phases varies from one day for locations right on the Arctic Circle to several months near the Pole, which is the middle of the Northern Hemisphere. Between the Arctic Circle and the Tropic of Cancer (23°26′ latitude) lies the Northern temperate zone. The changes in these regions between summer and winter are generally mild, rather than extreme hot or cold. However, a temperate climate can have very unpredictable weather.

Tropical regions (between the Tropic of Cancer and the Equator, 0° latitude) are generally hot all year round and tend to experience a rainy season during the summer months, and a dry season during the winter months.
In the Northern Hemisphere, objects moving across or above the surface of the Earth tend to turn to the right because of the Coriolis effect. As a result, large-scale horizontal flows of air or water tend to form clockwise-turning gyres. These are best seen in ocean circulation patterns in the North Atlantic and North Pacific oceans. Within the Northern Hemisphere, oceanic currents can change the weather patterns that affect many factors within the north coast. For the same reason, flows of air down toward the northern surface of the Earth tend to spread across the surface in a clockwise pattern. Thus, clockwise air circulation is characteristic of high pressure weather cells in the Northern Hemisphere. Conversely, air rising from the northern surface of the Earth (creating a region of low pressure) tends to draw air toward it in a counterclockwise pattern. Hurricanes and tropical storms (massive low-pressure systems) spin counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere.

The shadow of a sundial moves clockwise on latitudes north of the subsolar point and anticlockwise to the south. During the day at these latitudes, the Sun tends to rise to its maximum at a southerly position. Between the Tropic of Cancer and the Equator, the Sun can be seen to the north, directly overhead, or to the south at noon, depending on the time of year. In the Southern Hemisphere, the midday Sun is predominantly in the north.

When viewed from the Northern Hemisphere, the Moon appears inverted compared to a view from the Southern Hemisphere. The North Pole faces away from the Galactic Center of the Milky Way. This results in the Milky Way being sparser and dimmer in the Northern Hemisphere compared to the Southern Hemisphere, making the Northern Hemisphere more suitable for deep-space observation, as it is not &quot;blinded&quot; by the Milky Way.

==Demographics==
As of 2015, the Northern Hemisphere is home to approximately 6.4 billion people, which is around 87.0% of the Earth&#x27;s total human population of 7.3 billion people.

<doc id="22130" wikidata="Q1598075" url="?curid=22130" title="Noun class">
<text>In linguistics, a noun class is a particular category of nouns. A noun may belong to a given class because of the characteristic features of its referent, such as gender, animacy, shape, but such designations are often clearly conventional. Some authors use the term &quot;grammatical gender&quot; as a synonym of &quot;noun class&quot;, but others consider these different concepts. Noun classes should not be confused with noun classifiers.

== Notion ==

There are three main ways by which natural languages categorize nouns into noun classes:
* according to similarities in their meaning (semantic criterion);
* by grouping them with other nouns that have similar form (morphology);
* through an arbitrary convention.
Usually, a combination of the three types of criteria is used, though one is more prevalent.

Noun classes form a system of grammatical agreement. A noun in a given class may require:
* agreement affixes on adjectives, pronouns, numerals, etc. in the same noun phrase,
* agreement affixes on the verb,
* a special form of pronoun to replace the noun,
* an affix on the noun,
* a class-specific word in the noun phrase.

Modern English expresses noun classes through the third person singular personal pronouns &quot;he&quot; (male person), &quot;she&quot; (female person), and &quot;it&quot; (object, abstraction, or animal), and their other inflected forms. Countable and uncountable nouns are distinguished by the choice of &quot;many&quot;/&quot;much&quot;. The choice between the relative pronoun &quot;who&quot; (persons) and &quot;which&quot; (non-persons) may also be considered a form of agreement with a semantic noun class. A few nouns also exhibit vestigial noun classes, such as &quot;stewardess&quot;, where the suffix &quot;-ess&quot; added to &quot;steward&quot; denotes a female person. This type of noun affixation is not very frequent in English, but quite common in languages which have the true grammatical gender, including most of the Indo-European family, to which English belongs.

In languages without inflectional noun classes, nouns may still be extensively categorized by independent particles called noun classifiers.

=== Common criteria for noun classes ===

Common criteria that define noun classes include:

* animate vs. inanimate (as in Ojibwe)
* rational vs. non-rational (as in Tamil)
* human vs. non-human
* human vs. animal (zoic) vs. inanimate
* male vs. other
* male human vs. other (as in Polish in masculine virile)
* masculine vs. feminine
* masculine vs. feminine vs. neuter
* common vs. neuter
* strong vs. weak
* augmentative vs. diminutive
* countable vs. uncountable

== Language families ==
=== Algonquian languages ===
The Ojibwe language and other members of the Algonquian languages distinguish between animate and inanimate classes. Some sources argue that the distinction is between things which are powerful and things which are not. Living things, as well as sacred things and things connected to the Earth, are considered powerful and belong to the animate class. Still, the assignment is somewhat arbitrary, as &quot;raspberry&quot; is animate, but &quot;strawberry&quot; is inanimate.

=== Athabaskan languages ===
In Navajo (Southern Athabaskan) nouns are classified according to their animacy, shape, and consistency. Morphologically, however, the distinctions are not expressed on the nouns themselves, but on the verbs of which the nouns are the subject or direct object. For example, in the sentence &#x27; &quot;My shirt is lying on the bed&quot;, the verb &quot;lies&quot; is used because the subject &#x27; &quot;my shirt&quot; is a flat, flexible object. In the sentence &quot;My belt is lying on the bed&quot;, the verb &#x27; &quot;lies&quot; is used because the subject &#x27; &quot;my belt&quot; is a slender, flexible object.

Koyukon (Northern Athabaskan) has a more intricate system of classification. Like Navajo, it has classificatory verb stems that classify nouns according to animacy, shape, and consistency. However, in addition to these verb stems, Koyukon verbs have what are called &quot;gender prefixes&quot; that further classify nouns. That is, Koyukon has two different systems that classify nouns: (a) a classificatory verb system and (b) a gender system. To illustrate, the verb stem &quot;-tonh&quot; is used for enclosed objects. When &quot;-tonh&quot; is combined with different gender prefixes, it can result in &quot;daaltonh&quot; which refers to objects enclosed in boxes or &quot;etltonh&quot; which refers to objects enclosed in bags.

=== Australian Aboriginal languages ===
The Dyirbal language is well known for its system of four noun classes, which tend to be divided along the following semantic lines:

The class usually labeled &quot;feminine&quot;, for instance, includes the word for fire and nouns relating to fire, as well as all dangerous creatures and phenomena. (This inspired the title of the George Lakoff book &quot;Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things&quot;.)

The Ngangikurrunggurr language has noun classes reserved for canines and hunting weapons. The Anindilyakwa language has a noun class for things that reflect light. The Diyari language distinguishes only between female and other objects. Perhaps the most noun classes in any Australian language are found in Yanyuwa, which has 16 noun classes, including nouns associated with food, trees and abstractions, in addition to separate classes for men and masculine things, women and feminine things. In the men&#x27;s dialect, the classes for men and for masculine things have simplified to a single class, marked the same way as the women&#x27;s dialect marker reserved exclusively for men.

===Basque===
Basque has two classes, animate and inanimate; however, the only difference is in the declension of locative cases (inessive, ablative, allative, terminal allative, and directional allative). For inanimate nouns, the locative case endings are attached directly if the noun is singular, and plural and indefinite number are marked by the suffixes &quot;-eta-&quot; and &quot;-(e)ta-&quot;, respectively, before the case ending (this is in contrast to the non-locative cases, which follow a different system of number marking where the indefinite form of the ending is the most basic). For example, the noun &quot;etxe&quot; &quot;house&quot; has the singular ablative form &quot;etxetik&quot; &quot;from the house&quot;, the plural ablative form &quot;etxeetatik&quot; &quot;from the houses&quot;, and the indefinite ablative form &quot;etxetatik&quot; (the indefinite form is mainly used with determiners that precede the noun: &quot;zenbat etxetatik&quot; &quot;from how many houses&quot;). For animate nouns, on the other hand, the locative case endings are attached (with some phonetic adjustments) to the suffix &quot;-gan-&quot;, which is itself attached to the singular, plural, or indefinite genitive case ending. Alternatively, &quot;-gan-&quot; may attach to the absolutive case form of the word if it ends in a vowel. For example, the noun &quot;ume&quot; &quot;child&quot; has the singular ablative form &quot;umearengandik&quot; or &quot;umeagandik&quot; &quot;from the child&quot;, the plural ablative form &quot;umeengandik&quot; &quot;from the children&quot;, and the indefinite ablative form &quot;umerengandik&quot; or &quot;umegandik&quot; (cf. the genitive forms &quot;umearen&quot;, &quot;umeen&quot;, and &quot;umeren&quot; and the absolutive forms &quot;umea&quot;, &quot;umeak&quot;, and &quot;ume&quot;). In the inessive case, the case suffix is replaced entirely by &quot;-gan&quot; for animate nouns (compare &quot;etxean&quot; &quot;in/at the house&quot; and &quot;umearengan&quot;/&quot;umeagan&quot; &quot;in/at the child&quot;).

=== Caucasian languages ===
Some members of the Northwest Caucasian family, and almost all of the Northeast Caucasian languages, manifest noun class. In the Northeast Caucasian family, only Lezgian, Udi, and Aghul do not have noun classes. Some languages have only two classes, whereas Bats has eight. The most widespread system, however, has four classes: male, female, animate beings and certain objects, and finally a class for the remaining nouns. The Andi language has a noun class reserved for insects.

Among Northwest Caucasian languages, only Abkhaz and Abaza have noun class, making use of a human male/human female/non-human distinction.

In all Caucasian languages that manifest class, it is not marked on the noun itself but on the dependent verbs, adjectives, pronouns and postpositions or prepositions.

=== Atlantic–Congo languages ===
Atlantic–Congo languages can have ten or more noun classes, defined according to non-sexual criteria. Certain nominal classes are reserved for humans. The Fula language has about 26 noun classes (the exact number varies slightly by dialect).

==== Bantu languages ====
According to Carl Meinhof, the Bantu languages have a total of 22 noun classes called nominal classes (this notion was introduced by W. H. I. Bleek). While no single language is known to express all of them, most of them have at least 10 noun classes. For example, by Meinhof&#x27;s numbering, Shona has 20 classes, Swahili has 15, Sotho has 18 and Ganda has 17.

Additionally, there are polyplural noun classes. A polyplural noun class is a plural class for more than one singular class. For example, Proto-Bantu class 10 contains plurals of class 9 nouns and class 11 nouns, while class 6 contains plurals of class 5 nouns and class 15 nouns. Classes 6 and 10 are inherited as polyplural classes by most surviving Bantu languages, but many languages have developed new polyplural classes that are not widely shared by other languages.

Specialists in Bantu emphasize that there is a clear difference between genders (such as known from Afro-Asiatic and Indo-European) and nominal classes (such as known from Niger–Congo). Languages with nominal classes divide nouns formally on the base of hyperonymic meanings. The category of nominal class replaces not only the category of gender, but also the categories of number and case.

Critics of Meinhof&#x27;s approach notice that his numbering system of nominal classes counts singular and plural numbers of the same noun as belonging to separate classes. This seems to them to be inconsistent with the way other languages are traditionally considered, where number is orthogonal to gender (according to the critics, a Meinhof-style analysis would give Ancient Greek 9 genders). If one follows broader linguistic tradition and counts singular and plural as belonging to the same class, then Swahili has 8 or 9 noun classes, Sotho has 11 and Ganda has 10.

The Meinhof numbering tends to be used in scientific works dealing with comparisons of different Bantu languages. For instance, in Swahili the word &#x27;friend&#x27; belongs to the class 9 and its &quot;plural form&quot; is of the class 6, even if most nouns of the 9 class have the plural of the class 10. For this reason, noun classes are often referred to by combining their singular and plural forms, e.g., would be classified as &quot;9/6&quot;, indicating that it takes class 9 in the singular, and class 6 in the plural.

However not all Bantu languages have these exceptions. In Ganda each singular class has a corresponding plural class (apart from one class which has no singular–plural distinction; also some plural classes correspond to more than one singular class) and there are no exceptions as there are in Swahili. For this reason Ganda linguists use the orthogonal numbering system when discussing Ganda grammar (other than in the context of Bantu comparative linguistics), giving the 10 traditional noun classes of that language.

The distinction between genders and nominal classes is blurred still further by Indo-European languages that have nouns that behave like Swahili&#x27;s . Italian, for example, has a group of nouns deriving from Latin neuter nouns that acts as masculine in the singular but feminine in the plural: /; /. (These nouns are still placed in a neuter gender of their own by some grammarians.)

===== Nominal classes in Swahili =====

&quot;Ø-&quot; means no prefix. Some classes are homonymous (esp. 9 and 10). The Proto-Bantu class 12 disappeared in Swahili, class 13 merged with 7, and 14 with 11.

Class prefixes appear also on adjectives and verbs, e.g.:
The class markers which appear on the adjectives and verbs may differ from the noun prefixes: 
In this example, the verbal prefix &#x27; and the pronominal prefix &#x27; are in concordance with the noun prefix : they all express class 1 despite their different forms.

==== Zande ====
The Zande language distinguishes four noun classes:

There are about 80 inanimate nouns which are in the animate class, including nouns denoting heavenly objects (moon, rainbow), metal objects (hammer, ring), edible plants (sweet potato, pea), and non-metallic objects (whistle, ball). Many of the exceptions have a round shape, and some can be explained by the role they play in Zande mythology.

== Noun classes versus grammatical gender ==

The term &quot;gender&quot;, as used by some linguists, refers to a noun-class system composed with two, three, or four classes, particularly if the classification is semantically based on a distinction between masculine and feminine. Genders are then considered a sub-class of noun classes. Not all linguists recognize a distinction between noun-classes and genders, however, and instead use either the term &quot;gender&quot; or &quot;noun class&quot; for both.

Sometimes the distinction can drift over time. For instance, in Danish, the main dialects merged the three original genders down to a total of two genders. Some other dialects merged all three genders down to almost a one gender similar to English, but kept the neuter adjective form for uncountable nouns (which are all neuter in Danish). This effectively created a noun class system of countable and uncountable nouns reflected in adjectives. 

== Noun classes versus noun classifiers ==
Some languages, such as Japanese, Chinese and the Tai languages, have elaborate systems of particles that go with nouns based on shape and function, but are free morphemes rather than affixes. Because the classes defined by these classifying words are not generally distinguished in other contexts, there are many linguists who take the view that they do not create noun classes.

== List of languages by type of noun classification ==
===Languages with noun classes===
*Atlantic languages (Niger–Congo language family)
**Fula (Fulfulde, Pulaar, Pular)
**Wolof
*all Bantu languages (Niger–Congo language family) such as
**Ganda: ten classes called simply &quot;Class I&quot; to &quot;Class X&quot; and containing all sorts of arbitrary groupings but often characterised as &quot;people&quot;, &quot;long objects&quot;, &quot;animals&quot;, &quot;miscellaneous objects&quot;, &quot;large objects and liquids&quot;, &quot;small objects&quot;, &quot;languages&quot;, &quot;pejoratives&quot;, &quot;infinitives&quot;, &quot;mass nouns&quot;, plus four &#x27;locative&#x27; classes. Alternatively, the Meinhof system of counting singular and plural as separate classes gives a total of 21 classes including the four locatives.
**Swahili
**Zulu
*Northeast Caucasian languages such as Bats
*Dyirbal: &quot;Masculine&quot;, &quot;feminine&quot;, &quot;vegetable&quot; and &quot;other&quot;. (Some linguists do not regard the noun-class system of this language as grammatical gender.)
*Arapesh languages such as Mufian

<text>Natural gas (also called fossil gas, methane gas, or simply gas) is a naturally occurring mixture of gaseous hydrocarbons consisting primarily of methane (95%) in addition to various smaller amounts of other higher alkanes. Traces of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, hydrogen sulfide, and helium are also usually present. Methane is colorless and odorless, and the second largest greenhouse gas contributor to global climate change after carbon dioxide. Because natural gas is odorless, odorizers such as mercaptan (which smells like rotten eggs) are commonly added to it for safety so that leaks can be readily detected.

Natural gas is a fossil fuel that is formed when layers of organic matter (primarily marine microorganisms) are thermally decomposed under oxygen-free conditions, subjected to intense heat and pressure underground over millions of years. The energy that the decayed organisms originally obtained from the sun via photosynthesis is stored as chemical energy within the molecules of methane and other hydrocarbons.

Natural gas can be burned for heating, cooking, and electricity generation. Consisting mainly of methane, natural gas is rarely used as a chemical feedstock.

The extraction and consumption of natural gas is a major industry. When burned for heat or electricity, natural gas emits fewer toxic air pollutants, less carbon dioxide, and almost no particulate matter compared to other fossil and biomass fuels. However, gas venting and unintended fugitive emissions throughout the supply chain can result in natural gas having a similar carbon footprint to other fossil fuels overall.

Natural gas can be found in underground geological formations, often alongside other fossil fuels like coal and oil (petroleum). Most natural gas has been created through either biogenic or thermogenic processes. Thermogenic gas takes a much longer period of time to form and is created when organic matter is heated and compressed deep underground. Methanogenic organisms produce methane from a variety of sources, principally carbon dioxide.
During petroleum production, natural gas is sometimes flared rather than being collected and used. Before natural gas can be burned as a fuel or used in manufacturing processes, it almost always has to be processed to remove impurities such as water. The byproducts of this processing include ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes, and higher molecular weight hydrocarbons. Hydrogen sulfide (which may be converted into pure sulfur), carbon dioxide, water vapor, and sometimes helium and nitrogen must also be removed.

Natural gas is sometimes informally referred to simply as &quot;gas&quot;, especially when it is being compared to other energy sources, such as oil, coal or renewables. However, it is not to be confused with gasoline, which is also shortened in colloquial usage to &quot;gas&quot;, especially in North America.

Natural gas is measured in standard cubic meters or standard cubic feet. The density compared to air ranges from 0.58 (16.8 g/mole, 0.71 kg per standard cubic meter) to as high as 0.79 (22.9 g/mole, 0.97 kg per scm), but generally less than 0.64 (18.5 g/mole, 0.78 kg per scm). For comparison, pure methane (16.0425 g/mole) has a density 0.5539 times that of air (0.678 kg per standard cubic meter).

==Name==
In the early 1800s, natural gas became known as &quot;natural&quot; to distinguish it from the dominant gas fuel at the time, coal gas. Unlike coal gas, which is manufactured by heating coal, natural gas can be extracted from the ground in its native gaseous form. When the use of natural gas overtook the use of coal gas in English speaking countries in the 20th century, it was increasingly referred to as simply &quot;gas.&quot; In order to highlight its role in exacerbating the climate crisis, however, many organizations have criticized the continued use of the word &quot;natural&quot; in referring to the gas. These advocates prefer the term &quot;fossil gas&quot; or &quot;methane gas&quot; as better conveying to the public its climate threat. A 2020 study of Americans&#x27; perceptions of the fuel found that, across political identifications, the term &quot;methane gas&quot; led to better estimates of its harms and risks.

==History==
Natural gas can come out of the ground and cause a long-burning fire. In ancient Greece, the gas flames at Mount Chimaera contributed to the legend of the fire-breathing creature Chimera. In ancient China, gas resulting from the drilling for brines was first used by about 400 BC. The Chinese transported gas seeping from the ground in crude pipelines of bamboo to where it was used to boil salt water to extract the salt in the Ziliujing District of Sichuan.

Natural gas was not widely used before the development of long distance pipelines in the early 20th century. Before that, most use was near to the source of the well, and the predominant gas for fuel and lighting during the industrial revolution was manufactured coal gas.

The history of natural gas in the United States begins with localized use. In the seventeenth century, French missionaries witnessed the American Indians setting fire to natural gas seeps around Lake Erie, and scattered observations of these seeps were made by European-descended settlers throughout the eastern seaboard through the 1700s. In 1821, William Hart dug the first commercial natural gas well in the United States at Fredonia, New York, United States, which led in 1858 to the formation of the Fredonia Gas Light Company. Further such ventures followed near wells in other states, until technological innovations allowed the growth of major long distance pipelines from the 1920s onwards.

By 2009, (or 8%) had been used out of the total of estimated remaining recoverable reserves of natural gas.

==Sources==
===Natural gas===

In the 19th century, natural gas was primarily obtained as a by-product of producing oil. The small, light gas carbon chains came out of solution as the extracted fluids underwent pressure reduction from the reservoir to the surface, similar to uncapping a soft drink bottle where the carbon dioxide effervesces. The gas was often viewed as a by-product, a hazard, and a disposal problem in active oil fields. The large volumes produced could not be used until relatively expensive pipeline and storage facilities were constructed to deliver the gas to consumer markets.

Until the early part of the 20th century, most natural gas associated with oil was either simply released or burned off at oil fields. Gas venting and production flaring are still practised in modern times, but efforts are ongoing around the world to retire them, and to replace them with other commercially viable and useful alternatives.

In addition to transporting gas via pipelines for use in power generation, other end uses for natural gas include export as liquefied natural gas (LNG) or conversion of natural gas into other liquid products via gas to liquids (GTL) technologies. GTL technologies can convert natural gas into liquids products such as gasoline, diesel or jet fuel. A variety of GTL technologies have been developed, including Fischer–Tropsch (F–T), methanol to gasoline (MTG) and syngas to gasoline plus (STG+). F–T produces a synthetic crude that can be further refined into finished products, while MTG can produce synthetic gasoline from natural gas. STG+ can produce drop-in gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and aromatic chemicals directly from natural gas via a single-loop process. In 2011, Royal Dutch Shell&#x27;s per day F–T plant went into operation in Qatar.

Natural gas can be &quot;associated&quot; (found in oil fields), or &quot;non-associated&quot; (isolated in natural gas fields), and is also found in coal beds (as coalbed methane). It sometimes contains a significant amount of ethane, propane, butane, and pentane—heavier hydrocarbons removed for commercial use prior to the methane being sold as a consumer fuel or chemical plant feedstock. Non-hydrocarbons such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen, helium (rarely), and hydrogen sulfide must also be removed before the natural gas can be transported.

Natural gas extracted from oil wells is called casinghead gas (whether or not truly produced up the annulus and through a casinghead outlet) or associated gas. The natural gas industry is extracting an increasing quantity of gas from challenging, unconventional resource types: sour gas, tight gas, shale gas, and coalbed methane.

There is some disagreement on which country has the largest proven gas reserves. Sources that consider that Russia has by far the largest proven reserves include the US Central Intelligence Agency (47,600 km3) and Energy Information Administration (47,800 km3), as well as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (48,700 km3). Contrarily, BP credits Russia with only 32,900 km3, which would place it in second, slightly behind Iran (33,100 to 33,800 km3, depending on the source).
It is estimated that there are about 900,000 km3 of &quot;unconventional&quot; gas such as shale gas, of which 180,000 km3 may be recoverable. In turn, many studies from MIT, Black &amp; Veatch and the US Department of Energy predict that natural gas will account for a larger portion of electricity generation and heat in the future.

The world&#x27;s largest gas field is the offshore South Pars/North Dome Gas-Condensate field, shared between Iran and Qatar. It is estimated to have of natural gas and of natural gas condensates.

Because natural gas is not a pure product, as the reservoir pressure drops when non-associated gas is extracted from a field under supercritical (pressure/temperature) conditions, the higher molecular weight components may partially condense upon isothermic depressurizing—an effect called retrograde condensation. The liquid thus formed may get trapped as the pores of the gas reservoir get depleted. One method to deal with this problem is to re-inject dried gas free of condensate to maintain the underground pressure and to allow re-evaporation and extraction of condensates. More frequently, the liquid condenses at the surface, and one of the tasks of the gas plant is to collect this condensate. The resulting liquid is called natural gas liquid (NGL) and has commercial value.

===Shale gas===

Shale gas is natural gas produced from shale. Because shale&#x27;s matrix permeability is too low to allow gas to flow in economical quantities, shale gas wells depend on fractures to allow the gas to flow. Early shale gas wells depended on natural fractures through which gas flowed; almost all shale gas wells today require fractures artificially created by hydraulic fracturing. Since 2000, shale gas has become a major source of natural gas in the United States and Canada. Because of increased shale gas production the United States was in 2014 the number one natural gas producer in the world. The production of shale gas in the United States has been described as a &quot;shale gas revolution&quot; and as &quot;one of the landmark events in the 21st century.&quot;

Following the increased production in the United States, shale gas exploration is beginning in countries such as Poland, China, and South Africa. Chinese geologists have identified the Sichuan Basin as a promising target for shale gas drilling, because of the similarity of shales to those that have proven productive in the United States. Production from the Wei-201 well is between 10,000 and 20,000 m3 per day. In late 2020, China National Petroleum Corporation claimed daily production of 20 million cubic meters of gas from its Changning-Weiyuan demonstration zone.

===Town gas===
Town gas is a flammable gaseous fuel made by the destructive distillation of coal. It contains a variety of calorific gases including hydrogen, carbon monoxide, methane, and other volatile hydrocarbons, together with small quantities of non-calorific gases such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen, and was used in a similar way to natural gas. This is a historical technology and is not usually economically competitive with other sources of fuel gas today.

Most town &quot;gashouses&quot; located in the eastern US in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were simple by-product coke ovens that heated bituminous coal in air-tight chambers. The gas driven off from the coal was collected and distributed through networks of pipes to residences and other buildings where it was used for cooking and lighting. (Gas heating did not come into widespread use until the last half of the 20th century.) The coal tar (or asphalt) that collected in the bottoms of the gashouse ovens was often used for roofing and other waterproofing purposes, and when mixed with sand and gravel was used for paving streets.

===Crystallized natural gas – clathrates===
Huge quantities of natural gas (primarily methane) exist in the form of clathrates under sediment on offshore continental shelves and on land in arctic regions that experience permafrost, such as those in Siberia. Hydrates require a combination of high pressure and low temperature to form.

In 2013, Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation (JOGMEC) announced that they had recovered commercially relevant quantities of natural gas from methane hydrate.

==Processing==


The image below is a schematic block flow diagram of a typical natural gas processing plant. It shows the various unit processes used to convert raw natural gas into sales gas pipelined to the end user markets.

The block flow diagram also shows how processing of the raw natural gas yields byproduct sulfur, byproduct ethane, and natural gas liquids (NGL) propane, butanes and natural gasoline (denoted as pentanes +).

==Demand==
As of mid-2020, natural gas production in the US had peaked three times, with current levels exceeding both previous peaks. It reached 24.1 trillion cubic feet per year in 1973, followed by a decline, and reached 24.5 trillion cubic feet in 2001. After a brief drop, withdrawals increased nearly every year since 2006 (owing to the shale gas boom), with 2017 production at 33.4 trillion cubic feet and 2019 production at 40.7 trillion cubic feet. After the third peak in December 2019, extraction continued to fall from March onward due to decreased demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in the US.

The 2021 global energy crisis was driven by a global surge in demand as the world quit the economic recession caused by COVID-19, particularly due to strong energy demand in Asia.

==Storage and transport==

Because of its low density, it is not easy to store natural gas or to transport it by vehicle. Natural gas pipelines are impractical across oceans, since the gas needs to be cooled down and compressed, as the friction in the pipeline causes the gas to heat up. Many existing pipelines in the US are close to reaching their capacity, prompting some politicians representing northern states to speak of potential shortages. The large trade cost implies that natural gas markets are globally much less integrated, causing significant price differences across countries. In Western Europe, the gas pipeline network is already dense. New pipelines are planned or under construction between Western Europe and the Near East or Northern Africa.

Whenever gas is bought or sold at custody transfer points, rules and agreements are made regarding the gas quality. These may include the maximum allowable concentration of ,  and . Usually sales quality gas that has been treated to remove contamination is traded on a &quot;dry gas&quot; basis and is required to be commercially free from objectionable odours, materials, and dust or other solid or liquid matter, waxes, gums and gum forming constituents, which might damage or adversely affect operation of equipment downstream of the custody transfer point.

Based on their geographic origin, H-gas (high-calorific gas) and L-gas (low-calorific gas) are to be distinguished. Both types require separate transport, leading to two separate pipeline networks, e.g. in parts of Germany (with a strengthened focus and transition towards H-gas, as the L-gas reservoirs in Germany and the Netherlands are declining).

LNG carrier ships transport liquefied natural gas (LNG) across oceans, while tank trucks can carry LNG or compressed natural gas (CNG) over shorter distances. Sea transport using CNG carrier ships that are now under development may be competitive with LNG transport in specific conditions.

Gas is turned into liquid at a liquefaction plant, and is returned to gas form at regasification plant at the terminal. Shipborne regasification equipment is also used. LNG is the preferred form for long distance, high volume transportation of natural gas, whereas pipeline is preferred for transport for distances up to over land and approximately half that distance offshore.

CNG is transported at high pressure, typically above . Compressors and decompression equipment are less capital intensive and may be economical in smaller unit sizes than liquefaction/regasification plants. Natural gas trucks and carriers may transport natural gas directly to end-users, or to distribution points such as pipelines.

In the past, the natural gas which was recovered in the course of recovering petroleum could not be profitably sold, and was simply burned at the oil field in a process known as flaring. Flaring is now illegal in many countries. Additionally, higher demand in the last 20–30 years has made production of gas associated with oil economically viable. As a further option, the gas is now sometimes re- into the formation for enhanced oil recovery by pressure maintenance as well as miscible or immiscible flooding. Conservation, re-injection, or flaring of natural gas associated with oil is primarily dependent on proximity to markets (pipelines), and regulatory restrictions.

Natural gas can be indirectly exported through the absorption in other physical output. The expansion of shale gas production in the US has caused prices to drop relative to other countries. This has caused a boom in energy intensive manufacturing sector exports, whereby the average dollar unit of US manufacturing exports has almost tripled its energy content between 1996 and 2012.

A &quot;master gas system&quot; was invented in Saudi Arabia in the late 1970s, ending any necessity for flaring. Satellite and nearby infra-red camera observations, however, shows that flaring and venting are still happening in some countries.

Natural gas is used to generate electricity and heat for desalination. Similarly, some landfills that also discharge methane gases have been set up to capture the methane and generate electricity.

Natural gas is often stored underground [references about geological storage needed]inside depleted gas reservoirs from previous gas wells, salt domes, or in tanks as liquefied natural gas. The gas is injected in a time of low demand and extracted when demand picks up. Storage nearby end users helps to meet volatile demands, but such storage may not always be practicable.

With 15 countries accounting for 84% of the worldwide extraction, access to natural gas has become an important issue in international politics, and countries vie for control of pipelines. In the first decade of the 21st century, Gazprom, the state-owned energy company in Russia, engaged in disputes with Ukraine and Belarus over the price of natural gas, which have created concerns that gas deliveries to parts of Europe could be cut off for political reasons. The United States is preparing to export natural gas.

===Floating liquefied natural gas===
Floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) is an innovative technology designed to enable the development of offshore gas resources that would otherwise remain untapped due to environmental or economic factors which currently make them impractical to develop via a land-based LNG operation. FLNG technology also provides a number of environmental and economic advantages:
* Environmental – Because all processing is done at the gas field, there is no requirement for long pipelines to shore, compression units to pump the gas to shore, dredging and jetty construction, and onshore construction of an LNG processing plant, which significantly reduces the environmental footprint. Avoiding construction also helps preserve marine and coastal environments. In addition, environmental disturbance will be minimised during decommissioning because the facility can easily be disconnected and removed before being refurbished and re-deployed elsewhere.
* Economic – Where pumping gas to shore can be prohibitively expensive, FLNG makes development economically viable. As a result, it will open up new business opportunities for countries to develop offshore gas fields that would otherwise remain stranded, such as those offshore East Africa.

Many gas and oil companies are considering the economic and environmental benefits of floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG). There are currently projects underway to construct five FLNG facilities. Petronas is close to completion on their FLNG-1 at Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering and are underway on their FLNG-2 project at Samsung Heavy Industries. Shell Prelude is due to start production 2017. The Browse LNG project will commence FEED in 2019.

==Uses==

Natural gas is primarily used in the northern hemisphere. North America and Europe are major consumers.

Often well head gases require removal of various hydrocarbon molecules contained within the gas. Some of these gases include heptane, pentane, propane and other hydrocarbons with molecular weights above methane (). The natural gas transmission lines extend to the natural gas processing plant or unit which removes the higher-molecular weight hydrocarbons to produce natural gas with energy content between . The processed natural gas may then be used for residential, commercial and industrial uses.

===Mid-stream natural gas===
Natural gas flowing in the distribution lines is called mid-stream natural gas and is often used to power engines which rotate compressors. These compressors are required in the transmission line to pressurize and repressurize the mid-stream natural gas as the gas travels. Typically, natural gas powered engines require natural gas to operate at the rotational name plate specifications. Several methods are used to remove these higher molecular weighted gases for use by the natural gas engine. A few technologies are as follows:
* Joule–Thomson skid
* Cryogenic or chiller system
* Chemical enzymology system

===Power generation===
===Domestic use===

In the US, over one-third of households (&gt;40 million homes) cook with gas. Natural gas dispensed in a residential setting can generate temperatures in excess of making it a powerful domestic cooking and heating fuel. Stanford scientists estimated that gas stoves emit 0.8–1.3% of the gas they use as unburned methane and that total U.S. stove emissions are 28.1 gigagrams of methane. In much of the developed world it is supplied through pipes to homes, where it is used for many purposes including ranges and ovens, heating/cooling, outdoor and portable grills, and central heating. Heaters in homes and other buildings may include boilers, furnaces, and water heaters. Both North America and Europe are major consumers of natural gas.

Domestic appliances, furnaces, and boilers use low pressure, usually with a standard pressure around over atmospheric pressure. The pressures in the supply lines vary, either the standard utilization pressure (UP) mentioned above or elevated pressure (EP), which may be anywhere from over atmospheric pressure. Systems using EP have a regulator at the service entrance to step down to UP.

Natural gas piping systems inside buildings are often designed with pressures of , and have downstream pressure regulators to reduce pressure as needed. In the United States the maximum allowable operating pressure for natural gas piping systems within a building is based on NFPA 54: National Fuel Gas Code, except when approved by the Public Safety Authority or when insurance companies have more stringent requirements.

Generally, natural gas system pressures are not allowed to exceed unless all of the following conditions are met:
* The AHJ will allow a higher pressure.
* The distribution pipe is welded. (Note: 2. Some jurisdictions may also require that welded joints be radiographed to verify continuity).
* The pipes are closed for protection and placed in a ventilated area that does not allow gas accumulation.
* The pipe is installed in the areas used for industrial processes, research, storage or mechanical equipment rooms.

Generally, a maximum liquefied petroleum gas pressure of is allowed, provided the building is constructed in accordance with NFPA 58: Liquefied Petroleum Gas Code, Chapter 7.

A seismic earthquake valve operating at a pressure of 55 psig (3.7 bar) can stop the flow of natural gas into the site wide natural gas distribution piping network (that runs (outdoors underground, above building roofs, and or within the upper supports of a canopy roof). Seismic earthquake valves are designed for use at a maximum of 60 psig.

In Australia, natural gas is transported from gas processing facilities to regulator stations via transmission pipelines. Gas is then regulated down to distributed pressures and the gas is distributed around a gas network via gas mains. Small branches from the network, called services, connect individual domestic dwellings, or multi-dwelling buildings to the network. The networks typically range in pressures from 7 kPa (low pressure) to 515 kPa (high pressure). Gas is then regulated down to 1.1 kPa or 2.75 kPa, before being metered and passed to the consumer for domestic use. Natural gas mains are made from a variety of materials: historically cast iron, though more modern mains are made from steel or polyethylene.

In some states in the USA, natural gas can be supplied by independent natural gas wholesalers/suppliers using existing pipeline owners&#x27; infrastructure through Natural Gas Choice programs.

LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) typically fuels outdoor and portable grills. Although, compressed natural gas (CNG) is sparsely available for similar applications in the US in rural areas underserved by the existing pipeline system and distribution network of the less expensive and more abundant LPG (liquefied petroleum gas).

===Transportation===
CNG is a cleaner and also cheaper alternative to other automobile fuels such as gasoline (petrol). By the end of 2014, there were over 20 million natural gas vehicles worldwide, led by Iran (3.5 million), China (3.3 million), Pakistan (2.8 million), Argentina (2.5 million), India (1.8 million), and Brazil (1.8 million). The energy efficiency is generally equal to that of gasoline engines, but lower compared with modern diesel engines. Gasoline/petrol vehicles converted to run on natural gas suffer because of the low compression ratio of their engines, resulting in a cropping of delivered power while running on natural gas (10–15%). CNG-specific engines, however, use a higher compression ratio due to this fuel&#x27;s higher octane number of 120–130.

Besides use in road vehicles, CNG can also be used in aircraft. Compressed natural gas has been used in some aircraft like the Aviat Aircraft Husky 200 CNG and the Chromarat VX-1 KittyHawk

LNG is also being used in aircraft. Russian aircraft manufacturer Tupolev for instance is running a development program to produce LNG- and hydrogen-powered aircraft. The program has been running since the mid-1970s, and seeks to develop LNG and hydrogen variants of the Tu-204 and Tu-334 passenger aircraft, and also the Tu-330 cargo aircraft. Depending on the current market price for jet fuel and LNG, fuel for an LNG-powered aircraft could cost 5,000 rubles (US$100) less per tonne, roughly 60%, with considerable reductions to carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon and nitrogen oxide emissions.

The advantages of liquid methane as a jet engine fuel are that it has more specific energy than the standard kerosene mixes do and that its low temperature can help cool the air which the engine compresses for greater volumetric efficiency, in effect replacing an intercooler. Alternatively, it can be used to lower the temperature of the exhaust.

===Fertilizers===

Natural gas is a major feedstock for the production of ammonia, via the Haber process, for use in fertilizer production. The development of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer has significantly supported global population growth — it has been estimated that almost half the people on the Earth are currently fed as a result of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer use.

===Hydrogen===
Natural gas can be used to produce hydrogen, with one common method being the hydrogen reformer. Hydrogen has many applications: it is a primary feedstock for the chemical industry, a hydrogenating agent, an important commodity for oil refineries, and the fuel source in hydrogen vehicles.

===Animal and fish feed===
Protein rich animal and fish feed is produced by feeding natural gas to Methylococcus capsulatus bacteria on commercial scale.

=== Olefins(alkenes) ===
Natural gas components(alkanes) can be converted into olefins(alkenes) or other chemical synthesis. Ethane by oxidative dehydrogenation converts to ethylene, which can be further converted to ethylene oxide, ethylene glycol, acetaldehyde or other olefins. Propane by oxidative hydrogenation converts to propylene or can be oxidized to acrylic acid and acrylonitrile.

===Other===
Natural gas is also used in the manufacture of fabrics, glass, steel, plastics, paint, synthetic oil, and other products.

Fuel for industrial heating and desiccation processes.

Raw material for large-scale fuel production using gas-to-liquid (GTL) process (e.g. to produce sulphur-and aromatic-free diesel with low-emission combustion).

== Health effects ==
Cooking with natural gas contributes to poor indoor air quality and can lead to severe respiratory diseases such as asthma.

==Environmental effects==


===Greenhouse effect and natural gas release===
Natural gas is a growing contributor to climate change. Both the NG itself (specifically methane) and carbon dioxide, which is released when natural gas is burned, are greenhouse gases.
Human activity is responsible for about 60% of all methane emissions and for most of the resulting increase in atmospheric methane. Natural gas is intentionally released or is otherwise known to leak during the extraction, storage, transportation, and distribution of fossil fuels. Globally, methane accounts for an estimated 33% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas warming. The decomposition of municipal solid waste (a source of landfill gas) and wastewater account for an additional 18% of such emissions. These estimates include substantial uncertainties which should be reduced in the near future with improved satellite measurements, such as those planned for MethaneSAT.

After release to the atmosphere, methane is removed by gradual oxidation to carbon dioxide and water by hydroxyl radicals () formed in the troposphere or stratosphere, giving the overall chemical reaction + 2 → + 2. While the lifetime of atmospheric methane is relatively short when compared to carbon dioxide, with a half-life of about 7 years, it is more efficient at trapping heat in the atmosphere, so that a given quantity of methane has 84 times the global-warming potential of carbon dioxide over a 20-year period and 28 times over a 100-year period. Natural gas is thus a potent greenhouse gas due to the strong radiative forcing of methane in the short term, and the continuing effects of carbon dioxide in the longer term.

Targeted efforts to reduce warming quickly by reducing anthropogenic methane emissions is a climate change mitigation strategy supported by the Global Methane Initiative.

===Greenhouse gas emissions===
When refined and burned, natural gas can produce 25–30% less carbon dioxide per joule delivered than oil, and 40–45% less than coal. It can also produce potentially fewer toxic pollutants than other hydrocarbon fuels. However, compared to other major fossil fuels, natural gas causes more emissions in relative terms during the production and transportation of the fuel, meaning that the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions are about 50% higher than the direct emissions from the site of consumption.

In terms of the warming effect over 100 years, natural gas production and use comprises about one fifth of human greenhouse gas emissions, and this contribution is growing rapidly. Globally, natural gas use emitted about 7.8 billion tons of in 2020 (including flaring), while coal and oil use emitted 14.4 and 12 billion tons, respectively. The IEA estimates the energy sector (oil, natural gas, coal and bioenergy) to be responsible for about 40% of human methane emissions. According to the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, natural gas consumption grew by 15% between 2015 and 2019, compared to a 5% increase in oil and oil product consumption.

The continued financing and construction of new gas pipelines indicates that huge emissions of fossil greenhouse gases could be locked-in for 40 to 50 years into the future. In the U.S. state of Texas alone, five new long-distance gas pipelines have been under construction, with the first entering service in 2019, and the others scheduled to come online during 2020–2022.

====Installation bans====
To reduce its greenhouse emissions, the Netherlands is subsidizing a transition away from natural gas for all homes in the country by 2050. In Amsterdam, no new residential gas accounts have been allowed since 2018, and all homes in the city are expected to be converted by 2040 to use the excess heat from adjacent industrial buildings and operations.
Some cities in the United States have started prohibiting gas hookups for new houses, with state laws passed and under consideration to either require electrification or prohibit local requirements. New gas appliance hookups are banned in New York State and the Australian Capital Territory. Additionally, the state of Victoria in Australia has implemented a ban on new natural gas hookups starting from January 1, 2024, as part of its gas substitution roadmap. This followed campaigning which resulted in a prohibition on onshore gas exploration and production in Victoria in 2014. This was partially lifted in 2021 but a constitutional ban remains on fracking.

The UK government is also experimenting with alternative home heating technologies to meet its climate goals. To preserve their businesses, natural gas utilities in the United States have been lobbying for laws preventing local electrification ordinances, and are promoting renewable natural gas and hydrogen fuel.

===Other pollutants===
Although natural gas produces far lower amounts of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides (NOx) than other fossil fuels, from burning natural gas in homes can be a health hazard.

===Radionuclides===
Natural gas extraction also produces radioactive isotopes of polonium (Po-210), lead (Pb-210) and radon (Rn-220). Radon is a gas with initial activity from 5 to 200,000 becquerels per cubic meter of gas. It decays rapidly to Pb-210 which can build up as a thin film in gas extraction equipment.

==Safety concerns==
The natural gas extraction workforce face unique health and safety challenges.

===Production===
Some gas fields yield sour gas containing hydrogen sulfide (), a toxic compound when inhaled. Amine gas treating, an industrial scale process which removes acidic gaseous components, is often used to remove hydrogen sulfide from natural gas.

Extraction of natural gas (or oil) leads to decrease in pressure in the reservoir. Such decrease in pressure in turn may result in subsidence — sinking of the ground above. Subsidence may affect ecosystems, waterways, sewer and water supply systems, foundations, and so on.

===Fracking===

Releasing natural gas from subsurface porous rock formations may be accomplished by a process called hydraulic fracturing or &quot;fracking&quot;. Since the first commercial hydraulic fracturing operation in 1949, approximately one million wells have been hydraulically fractured in the United States. The production of natural gas from hydraulically fractured wells has used the technological developments of directional and horizontal drilling, which improved access to natural gas in tight rock formations. Strong growth in the production of unconventional gas from hydraulically fractured wells occurred between 2000 and 2012.

In hydraulic fracturing, well operators force water mixed with a variety of chemicals through the wellbore casing into the rock. The high pressure water breaks up or &quot;fracks&quot; the rock, which releases gas from the rock formation. Sand and other particles are added to the water as a proppant to keep the fractures in the rock open, thus enabling the gas to flow into the casing and then to the surface. Chemicals are added to the fluid to perform such functions as reducing friction and inhibiting corrosion. After the &quot;frack&quot;, oil or gas is extracted and 30–70% of the frack fluid, i.e. the mixture of water, chemicals, sand, etc., flows back to the surface. Many gas-bearing formations also contain water, which will flow up the wellbore to the surface along with the gas, in both hydraulically fractured and non-hydraulically fractured wells. This produced water often has a high content of salt and other dissolved minerals that occur in the formation.

The volume of water used to hydraulically fracture wells varies according to the hydraulic fracturing technique. In the United States, the average volume of water used per hydraulic fracture has been reported as nearly 7,375 gallons for vertical oil and gas wells prior to 1953, nearly 197,000 gallons for vertical oil and gas wells between 2000 and 2010, and nearly 3 million gallons for horizontal gas wells between 2000 and 2010.

Determining which fracking technique is appropriate for well productivity depends largely on the properties of the reservoir rock from which to extract oil or gas. If the rock is characterized by low-permeability – which refers to its ability to let substances, i.e. gas, pass through it, then the rock may be considered a source of tight gas. Fracking for shale gas, which is currently also known as a source of unconventional gas, involves drilling a borehole vertically until it reaches a lateral shale rock formation, at which point the drill turns to follow the rock for hundreds or thousands of feet horizontally. In contrast, conventional oil and gas sources are characterized by higher rock permeability, which naturally enables the flow of oil or gas into the wellbore with less intensive hydraulic fracturing techniques than the production of tight gas has required. The decades in development of drilling technology for conventional and unconventional oil and gas production have not only improved access to natural gas in low-permeability reservoir rocks, but also posed significant adverse impacts on environmental and public health.

The US EPA has acknowledged that toxic, carcinogenic chemicals, i.e. benzene and ethylbenzene, have been used as gelling agents in water and chemical mixtures for high volume horizontal fracturing (HVHF). Following the hydraulic fracture in HVHF, the water, chemicals, and frack fluid that return to the well&#x27;s surface, called flowback or produced water, may contain radioactive materials, heavy metals, natural salts, and hydrocarbons which exist naturally in shale rock formations. Fracking chemicals, radioactive materials, heavy metals, and salts that are removed from the HVHF well by well operators are so difficult to remove from the water they are mixed with, and would so heavily pollute the water cycle, that most of the flowback is either recycled into other fracking operations or injected into deep underground wells, eliminating the water that HVHF required from the hydrologic cycle.

Historically low gas prices have delayed the nuclear renaissance, as well as the development of solar thermal energy.

===Added odor===
In its native state, natural gas is colorless and almost odorless. In the US, the New London School explosion that occurred in 1937 in Texas caused a push for legislation requiring the addition of an odorant to assist consumers in detecting leaks. An odorizer with an unpleasant smell, such as thiophane or tert-Butylthiol (t-butyl mercaptan) may be added. Situations have occurred in which an odorant cannot be properly detected by an observer with a normal sense of smell despite being detectable by analytical instruments. This is caused by odor masking, when one odor overpowers the sensation of another. As of 2011, the industry is conducting research on the causes of odor masking.

===Risk of explosion===
Explosions caused by natural gas leaks occur a few times each year. Individual homes, small businesses and other structures are most frequently affected when an internal leak builds up gas inside the structure. Leaks often result from excavation work, such as when contractors dig and strike pipelines, sometimes without knowing any damage resulted. Frequently, the blast is powerful enough to significantly damage a building but leave it standing. In these cases, the people inside tend to have minor to moderate injuries. Occasionally, the gas can collect in high enough quantities to cause a deadly explosion, destroying one or more buildings in the process. Many building codes now forbid the installation of gas pipes inside cavity walls or below floor boards to mitigate against this risk. Gas usually dissipates readily outdoors, but can sometimes collect in dangerous quantities if flow rates are high enough. However, considering the tens of millions of structures that use the fuel, the individual risk from using natural gas is low.

===Risk of carbon monoxide inhalation===
Natural gas heating systems may cause carbon monoxide poisoning if unvented or poorly vented. Improvements in natural gas furnace designs have greatly reduced CO poisoning concerns. Detectors are also available that warn of carbon monoxide or explosive gases such as methane and propane.

==Energy content, statistics, and pricing==

Quantities of natural gas are measured in standard cubic meters (cubic meter of gas at temperature and pressure ) or standard cubic feet (cubic foot of gas at temperature 60.0 °F and pressure ), 1 standard cubic meter = 35.301 standard cubic feet. The gross heat of combustion of commercial quality natural gas is around , but this can vary by several percent. This is about 50 to 54 MJ/kg depending on the density. For comparison, the heat of combustion of pure methane is 37.7 MJ per standard cubic metre, or 55.5 MJ/kg.

Except in the European Union, the U.S., and Canada, natural gas is sold in gigajoule retail units. LNG (liquefied natural gas) and LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) are traded in metric tonnes (1,000 kg) or million BTU as spot deliveries. Long term natural gas distribution contracts are signed in cubic meters, and LNG contracts are in metric tonnes. The LNG and LPG is transported by specialized transport ships, as the gas is liquified at cryogenic temperatures. The specification of each LNG/LPG cargo will usually contain the energy content, but this information is in general not available to the public. The European Union aimed to cut its gas dependency on Russia by two-thirds in 2022.

In August 2015, possibly the largest natural gas discovery in history was made and notified by an Italian gas company ENI. The energy company indicated that it has unearthed a &quot;supergiant&quot; gas field in the Mediterranean Sea covering about . This was named the Zohr gas field and could hold a potential of natural gas. ENI said that the energy is about . The Zohr field was found in the deep waters off the northern coast of Egypt and ENI claims that it will be the largest ever in the Mediterranean and even the world.

===European Union===
Gas prices for end users vary greatly across the EU. A single European energy market, one of the key objectives of the EU, should level the prices of gas in all EU member states. Moreover, it would help to resolve supply and global warming issues, as well as strengthen relations with other Mediterranean countries and foster investments in the region. During the prelude to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Qatar was asked by the US to supply emergency gas to the EU in case of supply disruptions.

===United States===
In US units, of natural gas produces around . The actual heating value when the water formed does not condense is the net heat of combustion and can be as much as 10% less.

In the United States, retail sales are often in units of therms (th); 1 therm = 100,000 BTU. Gas sales to domestic consumers are often in units of 100 standard cubic feet (scf). Gas meters measure the volume of gas used, and this is converted to therms by multiplying the volume by the energy content of the gas used during that period, which varies slightly over time. The typical annual consumption of a single family residence is 1,000 therms or one Residential Customer Equivalent (RCE). Wholesale transactions are generally done in decatherms (Dth), thousand decatherms (MDth), or million decatherms (MMDth). A million decatherms is a trillion BTU, roughly a billion cubic feet of natural gas.

The price of natural gas varies greatly depending on location and type of consumer. The typical caloric value of natural gas is roughly 1,000 BTU per cubic foot, depending on gas composition. Natural gas in the United States is traded as a futures contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Each contract is for 10,000 million BTU or . Thus, if the price of gas is $10/million BTU on the NYMEX, the contract is worth $100,000.

===Canada===

Canada uses metric measure for internal trade of petrochemical products. Consequently, natural gas is sold by the gigajoule (GJ), cubic meter (m3) or thousand cubic meters (E3m3). Distribution infrastructure and meters almost always meter volume (cubic foot or cubic meter). Some jurisdictions, such as Saskatchewan, sell gas by volume only. Other jurisdictions, such as Alberta, sell gas by energy content (GJ). In these areas, almost all meters for residential and small commercial customers measure volume (m3 or ft3), and billing statements include a multiplier to convert the volume to the energy content of the local gas supply.

A gigajoule (GJ) is a measure approximately equal to of oil, or or 1 million BTUs of gas. The energy content of gas supply in Canada can vary from depending on gas supply and processing between the wellhead and the customer.

==Adsorbed natural gas (ANG)==
Natural gas may be stored by adsorbing it to the porous solids called sorbents. The optimal condition for methane storage is at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Pressures up to 4 MPa (about 40 times atmospheric pressure) will yield greater storage capacity. The most common sorbent used for ANG is activated carbon (AC), primarily in three forms: Activated Carbon Fiber (ACF), Powdered Activated Carbon (PAC), and activated carbon monolith.

<text>In nuclear physics, a nuclear chain reaction occurs when one single nuclear reaction causes an average of one or more subsequent nuclear reactions, thus leading to the possibility of a self-propagating series or &quot;positive feedback loop&quot; of these reactions. The specific nuclear reaction may be the fission of heavy isotopes (e.g., uranium-235, 235U). A nuclear chain reaction releases several million times more energy per reaction than any chemical reaction.

==History==

Chemical chain reactions were first proposed by German chemist Max Bodenstein in 1913, and were reasonably well understood before nuclear chain reactions were proposed. It was understood that chemical chain reactions were responsible for exponentially increasing rates in reactions, such as produced in chemical explosions.

The concept of a nuclear chain reaction was reportedly first hypothesized by Hungarian scientist Leó Szilárd on September 12, 1933. Szilárd that morning had been reading in a London paper of an experiment in which protons from an accelerator had been used to split lithium-7 into alpha particles, and the fact that much greater amounts of energy were produced by the reaction than the proton supplied. Ernest Rutherford commented in the article that inefficiencies in the process precluded use of it for power generation. However, the neutron had been discovered by James Chadwick in 1932, shortly before, as the product of a nuclear reaction. Szilárd, who had been trained as an engineer and physicist, put the two nuclear experimental results together in his mind and realized that if a nuclear reaction produced neutrons, which then caused further similar nuclear reactions, the process might be a self-perpetuating nuclear chain reaction, spontaneously producing new isotopes and power without the need for protons or an accelerator. Szilárd, however, did not propose fission as the mechanism for his chain reaction since the fission reaction was not yet discovered, or even suspected. Instead, Szilárd proposed using mixtures of lighter known isotopes which produced neutrons in copious amounts. He filed a patent for his idea of a simple nuclear reactor the following year.

In 1936, Szilárd attempted to create a chain reaction using beryllium and indium but was unsuccessful. Nuclear fission was discovered by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in December 1938 and explained theoretically in January 1939 by Lise Meitner and her nephew Otto Robert Frisch. In their second publication on nuclear fission in February 1939, Hahn and Strassmann used the term &quot;uranspaltung&quot; (uranium fission) for the first time and predicted the existence and liberation of additional neutrons during the fission process, opening up the possibility of a nuclear chain reaction.

A few months later, Frédéric Joliot-Curie, H. Von Halban and L. Kowarski in Paris searched for, and discovered, neutron multiplication in uranium, proving that a nuclear chain reaction by this mechanism was indeed possible. On May 4, 1939, Joliot-Curie, Halban, and Kowarski filed three patents. The first two described power production from a nuclear chain reaction, the last one called &quot;Perfectionnement aux charges explosives&quot; was the first patent for the atomic bomb and is filed as patent No. 445686 by the Caisse nationale de Recherche Scientifique. In parallel, Szilárd and Enrico Fermi in New York made the same analysis. This discovery prompted the letter from Szilárd and signed by Albert Einstein to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, warning of the possibility that Nazi Germany might be attempting to build an atomic bomb.

On December 2, 1942, a team led by Fermi (and including Szilárd) produced the first artificial self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction with the Chicago Pile-1 experimental reactor in a racquets court below the bleachers of Stagg Field at the University of Chicago. Fermi&#x27;s experiments at the University of Chicago were part of Arthur H. Compton&#x27;s Metallurgical Laboratory of the Manhattan Project; the lab was renamed Argonne National Laboratory and tasked with conducting research in harnessing fission for nuclear energy.

In 1956, Paul Kuroda of the University of Arkansas postulated that a natural fission reactor may have once existed. Since nuclear chain reactions may only require natural materials (such as water and uranium, if the uranium has sufficient amounts of 235U), it was possible to have these chain reactions occur in the distant past when uranium-235 concentrations were higher than today, and where there was the right combination of materials within the Earth&#x27;s crust. Uranium-235 made up a larger share of uranium on Earth in the geological past because of the different half-lives of the isotopes and , the former decaying almost an order of magnitude faster than the latter. Kuroda&#x27;s prediction was verified with the discovery of evidence of natural self-sustaining nuclear chain reactions in the past at Oklo in Gabon in September 1972. To sustain a nuclear fission chain reaction at present isotope ratios in natural uranium on Earth would require the presence of a neutron moderator like heavy water or high purity carbon (e.g. graphite) in the absence of neutron poisons, which is even more unlikely to arise by natural geological processes than the conditions at Oklo some two billion years ago.

==Process==

Fission chain reactions occur because of interactions between neutrons and fissile isotopes (such as 235U). The chain reaction requires both the release of neutrons from fissile isotopes undergoing nuclear fission and the subsequent absorption of some of these neutrons in fissile isotopes. When an atom undergoes nuclear fission, a few neutrons (the exact number depends on uncontrollable and unmeasurable factors; the expected number depends on several factors, usually between 2.5 and 3.0) are ejected from the reaction. These free neutrons will then interact with the surrounding medium, and if more fissile fuel is present, some may be absorbed and cause more fissions. Thus, the cycle repeats to produce a reaction that is self-sustaining.

Nuclear power plants operate by precisely controlling the rate at which nuclear reactions occur. Nuclear weapons, on the other hand, are specifically engineered to produce a reaction that is so fast and intense it cannot be controlled after it has started. When properly designed, this uncontrolled reaction will lead to an explosive energy release.

===Fuel===

Nuclear weapons employ high quality, highly enriched fuel exceeding the critical size and geometry (critical mass) necessary in order to obtain an explosive chain reaction. The fuel for energy purposes, such as in a nuclear fission reactor, is very different, usually consisting of a low-enriched oxide material (e.g. uranium dioxide, UO2). There are two primary isotopes used for fission reactions inside of nuclear reactors. 

The first and most common is uranium-235. This is the fissile isotope of uranium and it makes up approximately 0.7% of all naturally occurring uranium. Because of the small amount of 235U that exists, it is considered a non-renewable energy source despite being found in rock formations around the world. Uranium-235 cannot be used as fuel in its base form for energy production; it must undergo a process known as refinement to produce the compound UO2. The UO2 is then pressed and formed into ceramic pellets, which can subsequently be placed into fuel rods. This is when UO2 can be used for nuclear power production. 

The second most common isotope used in nuclear fission is plutonium-239, because it is able to become fissile with slow neutron interaction. This isotope is formed inside nuclear reactors by exposing 238U to the neutrons released during fission. As a result of neutron capture, uranium-239 is produced, which undergoes two beta decays to become plutonium-239. Plutonium once occurred as a primordial element in Earth&#x27;s crust, but only trace amounts remain so it is predominantly synthetic. 

Another proposed fuel for nuclear reactors, which however plays no commercial role as of 2021, is uranium-233, which is &quot;bred&quot; by neutron capture and subsequent beta decays from natural thorium, which is almost 100% composed of the isotope thorium-232. This is called the thorium fuel cycle.

=== Enrichment process ===

The fissile isotope uranium-235 in its natural concentration is unfit for the vast majority of nuclear reactors. In order to be prepared for use as fuel in energy production, it must be enriched. The enrichment process does not apply to plutonium. Reactor-grade plutonium is created as a byproduct of neutron interaction between two different isotopes of uranium. 

The first step to enriching uranium begins by converting uranium oxide (created through the uranium milling process) into a gaseous form. This gas is known as uranium hexafluoride, which is created by combining hydrogen fluoride, fluorine, and uranium oxide. Uranium dioxide is also present in this process and is sent off to be used in reactors not requiring enriched fuel. The remaining uranium hexafluoride compound is drained into metal cylinders where it solidifies. The next step is separating the uranium hexafluoride from the depleted U-235 left over. This is typically done with centrifuges that spin fast enough to allow for the 1% mass difference in uranium isotopes to separate themselves. A laser is then used to enrich the hexafluoride compound. The final step involves reconverting the enriched compound back into uranium oxide, leaving the final product: enriched uranium oxide. This form of UO2 can now be used in fission reactors inside power plants to produce energy.

===Reaction products===
When a fissile atom undergoes nuclear fission, it breaks into two or more fission fragments. Also, several free neutrons, gamma rays, and neutrinos are emitted, and a large amount of energy is released. The sum of the rest masses of the fission fragments and ejected neutrons is less than the sum of the rest masses of the original atom and incident neutron (of course the fission fragments are not at rest). The mass difference is accounted for in the release of energy according to the equation &quot;E=Δmc2&quot;:

:mass of released energy = formula_1

Due to the extremely large value of the speed of light, &quot;c&quot;, a small decrease in mass is associated with a tremendous release of active energy (for example, the kinetic energy of the fission fragments). This energy (in the form of radiation and heat) carries the missing mass when it leaves the reaction system (total mass, like total energy, is always conserved). While typical chemical reactions release energies on the order of a few eVs (e.g. the binding energy of the electron to hydrogen is 13.6 eV), nuclear fission reactions typically release energies on the order of hundreds of millions of eVs.

Two typical fission reactions are shown below with average values of energy released and number of neutrons ejected:

:formula_2

Note that these equations are for fissions caused by slow-moving (thermal) neutrons. The average energy released and number of neutrons ejected is a function of the incident neutron speed. Also, note that these equations exclude energy from neutrinos since these subatomic particles are extremely non-reactive and therefore rarely deposit their energy in the system.

==Reactor physics==

===Prompt neutron lifetime===

The prompt neutron lifetime, formula_3, is the average time between the emission of a neutron and either its absorption or escape from the system. The neutrons that occur directly from fission are called &quot;prompt&quot; neutrons, and the ones that are a result of radioactive decay of fission fragments are called &quot;delayed&quot; neutrons. The term &quot;lifetime&quot; is used because the emission of a neutron is often considered its &quot;birth&quot;, and its subsequent absorption or escape from the core is considered its &quot;death&quot;.

For &quot;thermal&quot; (slow-neutron) fission reactors, the typical prompt neutron lifetime is on the order of 10−4 seconds, and for fast fission reactors, the prompt neutron lifetime is on the order of 10−7 seconds. These extremely short lifetimes mean that in 1 second, 10,000 to 10,000,000 neutron lifetimes can pass. The &quot;average&quot; (also referred to as the &quot;adjoint unweighted&quot;) prompt neutron lifetime takes into account all prompt neutrons regardless of their importance in the reactor core; the &quot;effective&quot; prompt neutron lifetime (referred to as the &quot;adjoint weighted&quot; over space, energy, and angle) refers to a neutron with average importance.

===Mean generation time===

The mean generation time, λ, is the average time from a neutron emission to a capture that results in fission. The mean generation time is different from the prompt neutron lifetime because the mean generation time only includes neutron absorptions that lead to fission reactions (not other absorption reactions). The two times are related by the following formula:

formula_4

In this formula &quot;keff&quot; is the effective neutron multiplication factor, described below.

===Effective neutron multiplication factor===

The effective neutron multiplication factor formula_5 is most often quantified as the ratio of the rate of neutron production to the rate of neutron loss in a nuclear system, and it is often described using the six-factor formula. 

formula_6

Using formula_5 and the prompt neutron lifetime, formula_3, the following differential equation can be used to describe the time rate of change of the neutron population:

formula_9

When solved for formula_10, this equation represents the neutron population formula_11 at any given time formula_12 given an initial neutron population formula_13 at formula_14:

formula_15

When describing a nuclear reactor, where neutron population is directly proportional to thermal power, the following equation is used:

formula_16

where formula_17 is the reactor power at time formula_12, given an initial power formula_19, and formula_20, the reactor period. The value of formula_20 can be calculated as

formula_22

==== Six-factor formula ====
The effective neutron multiplication factor formula_5 can be described using the product of six probability factors that describe a nuclear system. These factors, traditionally arranged chronologically with regards to the life of a neutron in a thermal reactor, include the probability of fast non-leakage formula_24, the fast fission factor formula_25, the resonance escape probability formula_26, the probability of thermal non-leakage formula_27, the thermal utilization factor formula_28, and the neutron reproduction factor formula_29 (also called the neutron efficiency factor). The six-factor formula is traditionally written as follows:

formula_30

Where:

* formula_24 describes the probability that a fast neutron will not escape the system without interacting. 
** The bounds of this factor are 0 and 1, with a value of 1 describing a system for which fast neutrons will never escape without interacting, i.e. an infinite system.
** Also written as formula_32
* formula_25 is the ratio of total fissions to fissions caused only by thermal neutrons
** Fast neutrons have a small probability to cause fissions in uranium, specifically uranium-238.
** The fast fission factor describes the contribution of fast fissions to the effective neutron multiplication factor
** The bounds of this factor are 1 and infinity, with a value of 1 describing a system for which only thermal neutrons are causing fissions. A value of 2 would denote a system in which thermal and fast neutrons are causing equal amounts of fissions.
* formula_26 is the ratio of the number of neutrons that begin thermalization to the number of neutrons that reach thermal energies.
** Many isotopes have &quot;resonances&quot; in their capture cross-section curves that occur in energies between fast and thermal.
** If a neutron begins thermalization (i.e. begins to slow down), there is a possibility it will be absorbed by a non-multiplying material before it reaches thermal energy.
** The bounds of this factor are 0 and 1, with a value of 1 describing a system for which all fast neutrons that do not leak out and do not cause fast fissions eventually reach thermal energies.
* formula_27 describes the probability that a thermal neutron will not escape the system without interacting.
** The bounds of this factor are 0 and 1, with a value of 1 describing a system for which thermal neutrons will never escape without interacting, i.e. an infinite system.
** Also written as formula_36
* formula_28 is the ratio of number of thermal neutrons absorbed in by fissile nuclei versus the number of neutrons absorbed in all materials in the system.
** This factor describes the efficiency of thermal neutron utilization in the system, hence the name thermal utilization factor.
** The bounds of this factor are 0 and 1, with a value of 1 describing a system for which the entire system is made of fissile nuclei (i.e. thermal neutrons can only react with fissile materials). Similarly, a value of 0.5 describes a system for which reactions with fissile and non-fissile nuclei are equal.
** For a conventional nuclear power reactor, this factor is the only one that can be directly controlled by the operator. With manipulations to the control rods, you can increase the amount of neutrons being absorbed in non-fissile nuclei while simultaneously decreasing the amount of neutrons absorbed in fissile nuclei.
* formula_29 describes the probability that a neutron absorbed will cause a fission reaction.
** This factor describes the behavior of the fissile material, specifically if a neutron is absorbed, how likely is it to cause a fission, and how many neutrons does the fission produce.

The multiplication factor is sometimes calculated with a simplified four-factor formula, which is the same as described above with formula_24 and formula_27 both equal to 1, and is used when an assumption is made that the reactor is &quot;infinite&quot; in that neutrons are very unlikely to leak out of the system. This value formula_41 is often used in safety evaluations of reactor designs.

==== Criticality ====
Because the value of formula_5 is directly related to the time rate of change of the neutron population in a system, it is convenient to classify the state of the nuclear system with regards to the critical value of the neutron population equation. The point at which the behavior of a nuclear system shifts is when formula_5 is exactly equal to 1. This point is called &quot;criticality,&quot; and describes a system in which the production rate and loss rate of neutrons is exactly equal.

When formula_5 is less than or greater than one, the terms subcriticality and supercriticality are used respectively to describe the system:
* formula_45 (subcriticality): The neutron population in the system is decreasing exponentially. 
* formula_46 (criticality): The neutron population is maintaining a constant value.
* formula_47 (supercriticality): The neutron population in the system is increasing exponentially.
In a practical nuclear system, like a fission reactor, if criticality is intended it is likely that formula_5 will actually oscillate from slightly less than 1 to slightly more than 1, primarily due to thermal feedback effects. The neutron population, when averaged over time, appears constant, leaving the average value of formula_5 at around 1 during a constant power run. Both delayed neutrons and the transient fission product &quot;burnable poisons&quot; play an important role in the timing of these oscillations.

==== Reactivity ====
The value of formula_5 is generally not easy to calculate or use practically. Instead, a system&#x27;s reactivity is quantified instead. The reactivity of a nuclear system is qualitatively described as the departure from criticality. The equation below describes the pure reactivity formula_51 as a function of the neutron multiplication factor formula_5:

formula_53

or when comparing the reactivity differences between two nuclear systems with multiplication factors formula_54 and formula_55,

formula_56

For most systems, the reactivity formula_51 has a very small range, making any value difficult to qualitatively describe or interpret, like formula_5. Often, it is expressed in units of formula_59, per cent mille, or (almost solely in the United States) with the derived units of dollars and cents. Note that formula_51 is often also expressed as formula_61

formula_62

formula_63

formula_64

The value formula_65 is known as the effective delayed neutron fraction, and it describes the fractional contribution of delayed neutrons to the fission rate of the system and is quantified as the ratio of the total number of fissions caused by delayed neutrons to the total number of fissions in a system. This number is slightly different than the delayed neutron fraction formula_66, which is the fraction of neutrons in the system that are delayed, because delayed neutrons are generally born at lower energies, and thus are easier to thermalize, meaning they are more likely to cause a fission than a prompt neutron. This weighting effect is given in the derivation of formula_65.

==== Subcritical Multiplication ====
When a nuclear system is subcritical, an introduction of neutrons to the system will result in that population decaying away; however, if neutrons are introduced at a constant rate (i.e. from a neutron source), a nuclear system can appear critical while not actually maintaining true criticality. This is called source criticality and due to a phenomenon called subcritical multiplication.

The neutron population equation can be modified to be written as follows:

formula_68

We take the above equation and define a new factor formula_69, called the subcritical multiplication factor:

formula_70

Multiplying this factor by the source strength (in neutrons/sec) will give the stable neutron population, as long as formula_5 is known:

formula_72

Much more commonly, this equation is used to estimate formula_5, as the stable neutron population is easy to measure, but it is difficult to know the strength of a neutron source. To get around this, as a system approaches criticality, formula_69 approaches infinity; therefore, it is much more practical to measure formula_75, which approaches zero as a system approaches criticality. formula_75 can be approximated by the ratio of count rates before and after a reactivity addition. 

formula_77

Most neutron sources are a combination of an alpha particle emitter and beryllium. Beryllium-9, the only naturally-occurring stable isotope of beryllium, is capable of emitting a neutron when an alpha particle is absorbed. This (formula_78) binary reaction is what generates neutrons. The most common of these are americium-beryllium (AmBe), plutonium-beryllium (PuBe), and polonium-beryllium (PoBe) sources.

&lt;chem&gt;{^9_4 Be} + {^4_2 \alpha} \Rightarrow {^1_0 n} + {^{12}_{6} C}&lt;/chem&gt;

Antimony-124 is also used in conjunction with beryllium to generate neutrons, as the gamma ray emitted by antimony-124 is at a unique energy that can be absorbed by beryllium and cause it to emit a neutron. This is called a (formula_79) reaction. Antimony-124 sources are commonly used to locate beryllium ore by mining companies. 

&lt;chem&gt;{^9_4 Be} + {\gamma} \Rightarrow {^1_0 n} + {^{8}_{4} Be}&lt;/chem&gt;

Other sources of neutrons are from accelerators that use fusion to generate neutrons using deuterium and tritium fusion via this reaction

&lt;chem&gt;{^2_1 D} + {^2_1 D} \Rightarrow {^1_0 n} + {^3_2 He}&lt;/chem&gt;

&lt;chem&gt;{^2_1 D} + {^3_1 T} \Rightarrow {^1_0 n} + {^4_2 He}&lt;/chem&gt;
==== Special reactivity cases ====
Not all neutrons are emitted as a direct product of fission; some are instead due to the radioactive decay of some of the fission fragments. The neutrons that occur directly from fission are called &quot;prompt neutrons&quot;, and the ones that are a result of radioactive decay of fission fragments are called &quot;delayed neutrons&quot;. The fraction of neutrons that are delayed is called formula_66, as discussed before, and this fraction is typically less than 1% of all the neutrons in the chain reaction.

As the delayed neutron precursors (the radionuclides that decay via neutron emission) have decay constants on the order of seconds and milliseconds, the delayed neutrons born from them allow the neutron population in a system to respond to small reactivity changes several orders of magnitude more slowly than just prompt neutrons would alone, as these delayed neutrons effectively increase the mean neutron lifetime formula_3. Without delayed neutrons, changes in reaction rates in nuclear systems would occur at speeds that are too fast for humans to control.

When formula_82 and formula_83, a nuclear system is called delayed critical. The region of supercriticality where formula_84 is known as delayed supercriticality. It is in this region that all nuclear power reactors operate. When formula_85, the system is described as prompt critical. The region of supercriticality for formula_86 is known as prompt supercriticality. This is the region in which nuclear weapons operate, alongside some pulsing nuclear research reactors, like the TRIGA reactor.
==Nuclear weapons==

Nuclear fission weapons require a mass of fissile fuel that is prompt supercritical. For a given mass of fissile material the value of &quot;k&quot; can be increased by increasing the density. Since the probability per distance travelled for a neutron to collide with a nucleus is proportional to the material density, increasing the density of a fissile material can increase &quot;k&quot;. This concept is utilized in the implosion method for nuclear weapons. In these devices, the nuclear chain reaction begins after increasing the density of the fissile material with a conventional explosive.

In a gun-type fission weapon, two subcritical masses of fuel are rapidly brought together. The value of &quot;k&quot; for a combination of two masses is always greater than that of its components. The magnitude of the difference depends on distance, as well as the physical orientation. The value of &quot;k&quot; can also be increased by using a neutron reflector surrounding the fissile material.

Once the mass of fuel is prompt supercritical, the power increases exponentially. However, the exponential power increase cannot continue for long since &quot;k&quot; decreases when the amount of fission material that is left decreases (i.e. it is consumed by fissions). Also, the geometry and density are expected to change during detonation since the remaining fission material is torn apart from the explosion.

===Predetonation===
Detonation of a nuclear weapon involves bringing fissile material into its optimal supercritical state very rapidly (about one microsecond, or one-millionth of a second). During part of this process, the assembly is supercritical, but not yet in an optimal state for a chain reaction. Free neutrons, in particular from spontaneous fissions, can cause the device to undergo a preliminary chain reaction that destroys the fissile material before it is ready to produce a large explosion, which is known as predetonation.

To keep the probability of predetonation low, the duration of the non-optimal assembly period is minimized, and fissile and other materials are used that have low spontaneous fission rates. In fact, the combination of materials has to be such that it is unlikely that there is even a single spontaneous fission during the period of supercritical assembly. In particular, the gun method cannot be used with plutonium.

== Nuclear power plants and control of chain reactions ==
Chain reactions naturally give rise to reaction rates that grow (or shrink) exponentially, whereas a nuclear power reactor needs to be able to hold the reaction rate reasonably constant. To maintain this control, the chain reaction criticality must have a slow enough time scale to permit intervention by additional effects (e.g., mechanical control rods or thermal expansion). Consequently, all nuclear power reactors (even fast-neutron reactors) rely on delayed neutrons for their criticality. An operating nuclear power reactor fluctuates between being slightly subcritical and slightly delayed-supercritical, but must always remain below prompt-critical.

It is impossible for a nuclear power plant to undergo a nuclear chain reaction that results in an explosion of power comparable with a nuclear weapon, but even low-powered explosions from uncontrolled chain reactions (that would be considered &quot;fizzles&quot; in a bomb) may still cause considerable damage and meltdown in a reactor. For example, the Chernobyl disaster involved a runaway chain reaction, but the result was a low-powered steam explosion from the relatively small release of heat, as compared with a bomb. However, the reactor complex was destroyed by the heat, as well as by ordinary burning of the graphite exposed to air. Such steam explosions would be typical of the very diffuse assembly of materials in a nuclear reactor, even under the worst conditions.

In addition, other steps can be taken for safety. For example, power plants licensed in the United States require a negative void coefficient of reactivity (this means that if coolant is removed from the reactor core, the nuclear reaction will tend to shut down, not increase). This eliminates the possibility of the type of accident that occurred at Chernobyl (which was caused by a positive void coefficient). However, nuclear reactors are still capable of causing smaller chemical explosions even after complete shutdown, such as was the case of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. In such cases, residual decay heat from the core may cause high temperatures if there is loss of coolant flow, even a day after the chain reaction has been shut down (see SCRAM). This may cause a chemical reaction between water and fuel that produces hydrogen gas, which can explode after mixing with air, with severe contamination consequences, since fuel rod material may still be exposed to the atmosphere from this process. However, such explosions do not happen during a chain reaction, but rather as a result of energy from radioactive beta decay, after the fission chain reaction has been stopped.
