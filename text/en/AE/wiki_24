<text>Michael Bentine (born Michael James Bentin; 26 January 1922 – 26 November 1996) was a British comedian, comic actor and founding member of the Goons. His father was a Peruvian Briton.

==Biography==
Bentine was born in Watford, Hertfordshire, to a Peruvian father, Adam Bentin, and a British mother, Florence Dawkins, and grew up in Folkestone, Kent. He was educated at Eton College. With the help of speech trainer, Harry Burgess, he learned to manage a stammer and subsequently developed an interest in amateur theatricals, along with the Tomlinson family, including the young David Tomlinson. He spoke fluent Spanish and French.

His father was an early aeronautical engineer for the Sopwith Aviation Company during and after World War I and invented a tension meter for setting the tension on aircraft rigging wires.

In World War II, Bentine volunteered for all services when the war broke out (the RAF was his first choice owing to the influence of his father&#x27;s experience), but was initially rejected because of his father&#x27;s nationality.

He started his acting career in 1940, in a touring company in Cardiff playing a juvenile lead in &quot;Sweet Lavender&quot;. He went on to join Robert Atkins&#x27; Shakespearean company in Regent&#x27;s Park, London, until he was called up for service in the RAF. He was appearing in a Shakespearean play in doublet and hose in the open-air theatre in London&#x27;s Hyde Park when two RAF Police NCOs marched on stage and arrested him for desertion. Unknown to him, an RAF conscription notice had been following him for a month as his company toured.

Once in the RAF he went through flying training. He was the penultimate man going through a medical line receiving inoculations for typhoid with the other flight candidates in his class (they were going to Canada to receive new aircraft) when the vaccine ran out. They refilled the bottle to inoculate him and the other man as well. By mistake they loaded a pure culture of typhoid. The other man died immediately, and Bentine was in a coma for six weeks. When he regained consciousness his eyesight was ruined, leaving him myopic for the rest of his life. Since he was no longer physically qualified for flying, he was transferred to RAF Intelligence and seconded to MI9, a unit that was dedicated to supporting resistance movements and helping prisoners escape. His immediate superior was the Colditz escapee Airey Neave.

At the end of the war, he took part in the liberation of Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. He said about this experience:
Millions of words have been written about these horror camps, many of them by inmates of those unbelievable places. I&#x27;ve tried, without success, to describe it from my own point of view, but the words won&#x27;t come. To me Belsen was the ultimate blasphemy. (&quot;The Reluctant Jester&quot;, Chapter 17.)

==Comedy career==
After the war Bentine decided to become a comedian and worked in the Windmill Theatre where he met Harry Secombe. He specialised in off-the-wall humour, often involving cartoons and other types of animation. His acts included giving lectures in an invented language called Slobodian, &quot;Imaginative Young Man with a Walking Stick&quot; and &quot;The Chairback&quot;, with a broken chairback having a number of uses from comb to machine gun and taking on a demoniacal life of its own. Peter Sellers told him this was the inspiration for the prosthetic arm routine in &quot;Dr Strangelove&quot;. This act led to his engagement by Val Parnell to appear in the Starlight Roof revues starring Vic Oliver, where he met and married his second wife Clementina, with whom he had four children. Also on the bill were Fred Emney and a young Julie Andrews.

Bentine co-created &quot;The Goon Show&quot; radio show with Spike Milligan, Peter Sellers and Harry Secombe, but appeared in only the first 38 shows on the BBC Home Service from 1951 to 1952. The first of these shows were actually called &quot;Those Crazy People&quot; and subtitled &quot;The Junior Crazy Gang&quot;; the term &quot;Goon&quot; was used as the headline of a review of Bentine&#x27;s act by &quot;Picture Post&quot; dated 5 November 1948. Only one of this first series (and very few of the following three in which he did not appear) has survived, the rest of the original disc recordings having apparently been destroyed or discarded as no longer usable, so there is almost no record of his work as a radio &quot;Goon&quot;. He also appeared in the 1952 &quot;Goon Show&quot; film &quot;Down Among the Z Men&quot;.

In 1951 Bentine was invited to the United States to appear on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. On his return he parted amicably from his partners and continued touring in variety, remaining close to Secombe and Sellers for the rest of his life. In 1972, Secombe and Sellers told Michael Parkinson that Bentine was &quot;always calling everyone a genius&quot; and, since he was the only one of the four with a &quot;proper education&quot;, they always believed him.

His first appearances on television were as presenter on a 13-part children&#x27;s series featuring remote controlled puppets, &quot;The Bumblies&quot;, which he also devised, designed and wrote. These were three small creatures from outer space who slept on &quot;Professor Bentine&#x27;s&quot; ceiling and who had come to Earth to learn the ways of Earthling children. Angelo de Calferta modelled the puppets from Bentine&#x27;s designs and Richard Dendy moulded them in latex rubber. He sold the series to the BBC for less than they had cost to make. He then spent two years touring in Australia (1954–55).

On his return to Britain in 1954, he worked as a scriptwriter for Peter Sellers and then on 39 episodes of his own radio show &quot;Round the Bend in 30 Minutes&quot;, which has also been wiped from the BBC archive. He then teamed up with Dick Lester to devise a series of six TV programmes &quot;Before Midnight&quot; for ABC Weekend TV in Birmingham in 1958. This led to a 13-programme series called &quot;After Hours&quot; in which he appeared alongside Dick Emery, Clive Dunn, David Lodge, Joe Gibbons and Benny Lee. The show featured the &quot;olde English sport of drats, later known as nurdling&quot;. Some of the sketches were adapted into a stage revue at the Cambridge Theatre, &quot;Don&#x27;t Shoot, We&#x27;re English&quot;. He also appeared in the film comedy &quot;Raising a Riot&quot;, starring Kenneth More, which featured his five-year-old daughter &quot;Fusty&quot;. He joked that she got better billing.

From 1960 to 1964, he had a television series, &quot;It&#x27;s a Square World&quot;, which won a BAFTA award in 1962 and Grand Prix de la Presse at Montreux in 1963. A prominent feature of the series was the imaginary flea circus where plays were enacted on tiny sets using nothing but special effects to show the movement of things too small to see and sounds with Bentine&#x27;s commentary. One, titled &quot;The Beast of the Black Bog Tarn&quot;, was set in a (miniature) haunted house.

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in April 1963 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the BBC Television Theatre.

In 1969–70 he was presenter of &quot;The Golden Silents&quot; on BBC TV, which attempted authentic showings of silent films, without the commentaries with which they were usually shown on television before then.

From 1974 to 1980 he wrote, designed, narrated and presented the children&#x27;s television programme &quot;Michael Bentine&#x27;s Potty Time&quot; and made one-off comedy specials.

From January to May 1984 Bentine put out 11 half-hour episodes, in two series, of &quot;The Michael Bentine Show&quot; on Radio 4. These have subsequently been repeated, several times, on the BBC&#x27;s archive radio station BBC7 (now BBC Radio 4 Extra).

He was the writer of 16 best-selling novels, comedies and non-fiction books. Four of his books, &quot;The Long Banana Skin&quot; (1975), &quot;The Door Marked Summer&quot; (1981), &quot;Doors of the Mind&quot; and &quot;The Reluctant Jester&quot; (1992) are autobiographical.

===Other interests===
In 1968, travelling on the British Hovercraft Corporation (BHC) SR.N6, &quot;GH–2012&quot;, Bentine took part in the first hovercraft expedition up the River Amazon.

In the 1995 New Year Honours, Bentine received a CBE from Queen Elizabeth II &quot;for services to entertainment&quot;. In 1971, Bentine received the Order of Merit of Peru following his fund-raising work for the 1970 Great Peruvian earthquake.

Bentine was a crack pistol shot and helped to start the idea of a counter-terrorist wing within 22 SAS Regiment. In doing so, he became the first non-SAS person ever to fire a gun inside the close-quarters battle training house at Hereford.

His interests included parapsychology. This was as a result of his and his family&#x27;s extensive research into the paranormal, which resulted in his writing &quot;The Door Marked Summer&quot; and &quot;Doors of the Mind&quot;. He was, for the final years of his life, president of the Association for the Scientific Study of Anomalous Phenomena.

On 14 December 1977, he appeared with Arthur C. Clarke on Patrick Moore&#x27;s BBC &quot;The Sky at Night&quot; programme. The broadcast was entitled &quot;Suns, Spaceships and Bug-Eyed Monsters&quot; – a light-hearted look at how science fiction had become science fact, as well as how ideas of space travel had become reality through the 20th century. In the opening of the programme, Moore introduces Bentine with Bentine confirming that he was the possessor of a &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest Degree&quot;. This remark was typical of Bentine&#x27;s comic approach to most things in life that concealed his knowledge of science. Bentine appeared in a subsequent broadcast on a similar theme with Moore in 1980. Following the death of Arthur C. Clarke, &quot;BBC Sky at Night&quot; magazine released a copy of the 1977 archive programme on the cover of their May 2008 edition.

==Family and health==

Bentine was married twice. With his first wife Marie Barradell, married 1941–1947, he had a daughter:
* Elaine (1942–1983)

In 1949, he married his second wife, Clementina Stuart, a Royal Ballet dancer. They had four children:
* Marylla &quot;Fusty&quot; (1949–1987)
* Stuart &quot;Gus&quot; (1950–1971)
* Richard &quot;Peski&quot; (born 1959)
* Serena &quot;Suki&quot; (born 1961)

Of his five children, the two eldest daughters, Elaine and Marylla, died from cancer (breast cancer and lymphoma) in the 1980s. His elder son, Stuart, was killed with a pilot friend when a Piper PA-18 Super Cub crashed into a hillside at Ditcham Park Woods near Petersfield, Hampshire, on 28 August 1971. Their bodies and the aircraft were not found until October 1971. The AAIB after an 11-month investigation found that the aircraft went into clouds when taking action to avoid power cables while flying low in poor visibility, and subsequently, went out of control. Bentine&#x27;s subsequent investigation into regulations governing private airfields resulted in his writing a report for Special Branch into the use of personal aircraft in smuggling operations. He fictionalised much of the material in his novel &quot;Lords of the Levels&quot;.

From 1975 until his death in 1996, he and his wife spent their winters at a second home in Palm Springs, California, US.

Shortly before his death from prostate cancer at the age of 74, he was visited in hospital by Prince Charles.

<doc id="20419" wikidata="Q185935" url="?curid=20419" title="Mania">
<text>Mania, also known as manic syndrome, is a psychiatric behavioral syndrome defined as a state of abnormally elevated arousal, affect, and energy level. During a manic episode, an individual will experience rapidly changing emotions and moods, highly influenced by surrounding stimuli. Although mania is often conceived of as a &quot;mirror image&quot; to depression, the heightened mood can be dysphoric as well as euphoric. As the mania intensifies, irritability can be more pronounced and result in anxiety or anger.

The symptoms of mania include elevated mood (either euphoric or irritable), flight of ideas, pressure of speech, increased energy, decreased &quot;need&quot; and desire for sleep, and hyperactivity. They are most plainly evident in fully developed hypomanic states, however, in full-blown mania, these symptoms become progressively exacerbated. In severe manic episodes, these symptoms may even be obscured by other signs and symptoms characteristic of psychosis, such as delusions (it may include delusions of grandeur and paranoid delusions), hallucinations, fragmentation of behavior, and catatonia.

==Causes and diagnosis==
Mania is a syndrome with multiple causes. Although the vast majority of cases occur in the context of bipolar disorder, it is a key component of other psychiatric disorders (such as schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type) and may also occur secondary to various general medical conditions, such as multiple sclerosis; certain medications may perpetuate a manic state, for example prednisone; or substances prone to abuse, especially stimulants, such as amphetamine and cocaine. In the current DSM-5, hypomanic episodes are separated from the more severe full manic episodes, which, in turn, are characterized as either mild, moderate, or severe, with certain diagnostic criteria (e.g., catatonia, psychosis). Mania is divided into three stages: hypomania, or stage I; acute mania, or stage II; and delirious mania (delirium), or stage III. This &quot;staging&quot; of a manic episode is useful from a descriptive and differential diagnostic point of view.

Mania varies in intensity, from mild mania (hypomania) to delirious mania, marked by such symptoms as disorientation, acute psychosis, incoherence, and catatonia. Standardized tools such as Altman Self-Rating Mania Scale and Young Mania Rating Scale can be used to measure severity of manic episodes. Because mania and hypomania have also long been associated with creativity and artistic talent, it is not always the case that the clearly manic/hypomanic bipolar patient needs or wants medical help; such persons often either retain sufficient self-control to function normally or are unaware that they have &quot;gone manic&quot; severely enough to be committed or to commit themselves. Manic persons often can be mistaken for being under the influence of drugs.

== Classification ==
=== Mixed states ===

In a mixed affective state, the individual, though meeting the general criteria for a hypomanic (discussed below) or manic episode, experiences three or more concurrent depressive symptoms. This has caused some speculation, among clinicians, that mania and depression, rather than constituting &quot;true&quot; polar opposites, are, rather, two independent axes in a unipolar—bipolar spectrum.

A mixed affective state, especially with prominent manic symptoms, places the patient at a greater risk for suicide. Depression on its own is a risk factor but, when coupled with an increase in energy and goal-directed activity, the patient is far more likely to act with violence on suicidal impulses.

=== Hypomania ===

Hypomania, which means &quot;less than mania&quot;, is a lowered state of mania that does little to impair function or decrease quality of life. Although creativity and hypomania have been historically linked, a review and meta-analysis exploring this relationship found that this assumption may be too general and empirical research evidence is lacking. In hypomania, there is less need for sleep and both goal-motivated behaviour and metabolism increase. Some studies exploring brain metabolism in subjects with hypomania, however, did not find any conclusive link; while there are studies that reported abnormalities, some failed to detect differences. Though the elevated mood and energy level typical of hypomania could be seen as a benefit, true mania itself generally has many undesirable consequences, including suicidal tendencies, and hypomania can, if the prominent mood is irritable as opposed to euphoric, be a rather unpleasant experience. In addition, the exaggerated case of hypomania can lead to problems. For instance, trait-based positivity for a person could make them more engaging and outgoing, and cause them to have a positive outlook in life. When exaggerated in hypomania, however, such a person can display excessive optimism, grandiosity, and poor decision-making, often with little regard to the consequences.

=== Associated disorders ===
A single manic episode, in the absence of secondary causes, (i.e., substance use disorders, certain medications, or general medical conditions) is often sufficient to diagnose bipolar I disorder. Hypomania may be indicative of bipolar II disorder. Manic episodes are often complicated by delusions and/or hallucinations; and if the psychotic features persist for a duration significantly longer than the episode of typical mania (two weeks or more), a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder is more appropriate. Certain obsessive–compulsive spectrum disorders as well as impulse-control disorders share the suffix &quot;-mania,&quot; namely, kleptomania, pyromania, and trichotillomania. Despite the unfortunate association implied by the name, however, no connection exists between mania or bipolar disorder and these disorders. Furthermore, evidence indicates a vitamin B12 deficiency can also cause symptoms characteristic of mania and psychosis.

Hyperthyroidism can produce similar symptoms to those of mania, such as agitation, elevated mood, increased energy, hyperactivity, sleep disturbances and sometimes, especially in severe cases, psychosis.
Postpartum psychosis can also cause manic episodes (unipolar mania).

== Signs and symptoms ==
A &quot;manic episode&quot; is defined in the American Psychiatric Association&#x27;s diagnostic manual (DSM) as a &quot;distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy, lasting at least 1 week and present most of the day, nearly every day (or any duration, if hospitalization is necessary),&quot; where the mood is not caused by drugs/medication or a non-mental medical illness (e.g., hyperthyroidism), and: (a) is causing obvious difficulties at work or in social relationships and activities, or (b) requires admission to hospital to protect the person or others, or (c) the person has psychosis.

To be classified as a manic episode, while the disturbed mood and an increase in goal-directed activity or energy is present, at least three (or four, if only irritability is present) of the following must have been consistently present:
# Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity. 
# Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after 3 hours of sleep). 
# More talkative than usual, or acts pressured to keep talking.
# Flights of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing. 
# Increase in goal-directed activity, or psychomotor acceleration. 
# Distractibility (too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external stimuli). 
# Excessive involvement in activities with a high likelihood of painful consequences. (e.g., extravagant shopping, improbable commercial schemes, hypersexuality).

Though the activities one participates in while in a manic state are not &quot;always&quot; negative, those with the potential to have negative outcomes are far more likely.

If the person is concurrently depressed, they are said to be having a mixed episode.

The World Health Organization&#x27;s International Classification of Diseases (ICD) defines &quot;a manic episode&quot; as one where mood is higher than the person&#x27;s situation warrants and may vary from relaxed high spirits to barely controllable exuberance, is accompanied by hyperactivity, a compulsion to speak, a reduced sleep requirement, difficulty sustaining attention, and/or often increased distractibility. Frequently, confidence and self-esteem are excessively enlarged, and grand, extravagant ideas are expressed. Behavior that is out-of-character and risky, foolish or inappropriate may result from a loss of normal social restraint.

Some people also have physical symptoms, such as sweating, pacing, and weight loss. In full-blown mania, often the manic person will feel as though their goal(s) are of paramount importance, that there are no consequences, or that negative consequences would be minimal, and that they need not exercise restraint in the pursuit of what they are after. Hypomania is different, as it may cause little or no impairment in function. The hypomanic person&#x27;s connection with the external world, and its standards of interaction, remain intact, although intensity of moods is heightened. But those with prolonged unresolved hypomania do run the risk of developing full mania, and may cross that &quot;line&quot; without even realizing they have done so.

One of the signature symptoms of mania (and to a lesser extent, hypomania) is what many have described as racing thoughts. These are usually instances in which the manic person is excessively distracted by objectively unimportant stimuli. This experience creates an absent-mindedness where the manic individual&#x27;s thoughts totally preoccupy them, making them unable to keep track of time, or be aware of anything besides the flow of thoughts. Racing thoughts also interfere with the ability to fall asleep.

Manic states are always relative to the normal state of intensity of the affected individual; thus, already irritable patients may find themselves losing their tempers even more quickly, and an academically gifted person may, during the hypomanic stage, adopt seemingly &quot;genius&quot; characteristics and an ability to perform and articulate at a level far beyond that which they would be capable of during euthymia. A very simple indicator of a manic state would be if a heretofore clinically depressed patient suddenly becomes inordinately energetic, enthusiastic, cheerful, aggressive, or &quot;over-happy&quot;. Other, often less obvious, elements of mania include delusions (generally of either grandeur or persecution, according to whether the predominant mood is euphoric or irritable), hypersensitivity, hypervigilance, hypersexuality, hyper-religiosity, hyperactivity and impulsivity, a compulsion to over explain (typically accompanied by pressure of speech), grandiose schemes and ideas, and a decreased need for sleep (for example, feeling rested after only 3 or 4 hours of sleep). In the case of the latter, the eyes of such patients may both look and seem abnormally &quot;wide open&quot;, rarely blinking, and may contribute to some clinicians&#x27; erroneous belief that these patients are under the influence of a stimulant drug, when the patient, in fact, is either not on any mind-altering substances or is actually on a depressant drug. Individuals may also engage in out-of-character behavior during the episode, such as questionable business transactions, wasteful expenditures of money (e.g., spending sprees), risky sexual activity, abuse of recreational substances, excessive gambling, reckless behavior (such as extreme speeding or other daredevil activity), abnormal social interaction (e.g., over-familiarity and conversing with strangers), or highly vocal arguments. These behaviours may increase stress in personal relationships, lead to problems at work, and increase the risk of altercations with law enforcement. There is a high risk of impulsively taking part in activities potentially harmful to the self and others.

Although &quot;severely elevated mood&quot; sounds somewhat desirable and enjoyable, the experience of mania is ultimately often quite unpleasant and sometimes disturbing, if not frightening, for the person involved and for those close to them, and it may lead to impulsive behaviour that may later be regretted. It can also often be complicated by the individual&#x27;s lack of judgment and insight regarding periods of exacerbation of characteristic states. Manic patients are frequently grandiose, obsessive, impulsive, irritable, belligerent, and frequently deny anything is wrong with them. Because mania frequently encourages high energy and decreased perception of need or ability to sleep, within a few days of a manic cycle, sleep-deprived psychosis may appear, further complicating the ability to think clearly. Racing thoughts and misperceptions lead to frustration and decreased ability to communicate with others.

Mania may also, as earlier mentioned, be divided into three &quot;stages&quot;. Stage I corresponds with hypomania and may feature typical hypomanic characteristics, such as gregariousness and euphoria. In stages II and III mania, however, the patient may be extraordinarily irritable, psychotic or even delirious. These latter two stages are referred to as acute and delirious (or Bell&#x27;s), respectively.

==Causes==
Various triggers have been associated with switching from euthymic or depressed states into mania. One common trigger of mania is antidepressant therapy. Studies show that the risk of switching while on an antidepressant is between 6-69 percent. Dopaminergic drugs such as reuptake inhibitors and dopamine agonists may also increase risk of switch. Other medications possibly include glutaminergic agents and drugs that alter the HPA axis. Lifestyle triggers include irregular sleep-wake schedules and sleep deprivation, as well as extremely emotional or stressful stimuli.

Various genes that have been implicated in genetic studies of bipolar have been manipulated in preclinical animal models to produce syndromes reflecting different aspects of mania. CLOCK and DBP polymorphisms have been linked to bipolar in population studies, and behavioral changes induced by knockout are reversed by lithium treatment. Metabotropic glutamate receptor 6 has been genetically linked to bipolar, and found to be under-expressed in the cortex. Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide has been associated with bipolar in gene linkage studies, and knockout in mice produces mania like-behavior. Targets of various treatments such as GSK-3, and ERK1 have also demonstrated mania like behavior in preclinical models.

Mania may be associated with strokes, especially cerebral lesions in the right hemisphere.

Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus in Parkinson&#x27;s disease has been associated with mania, especially with electrodes placed in the ventromedial STN. A proposed mechanism involves increased excitatory input from the STN to dopaminergic nuclei.

There are certain psychoactive substances that can induce a state of manic psychosis, including: amphetamine, cathinone, cocaine, MDMA, methamphetamine, methylphenidate, oxycodone, phencyclidine, designer drugs, etc.

Mania can also be caused by physical trauma or illness. When the causes are physical, it is called secondary mania. In some individuals, manic symptoms are also correlated with the season of spring.

== Mechanism ==

The mechanism underlying mania is unknown, but the neurocognitive profile of mania is highly consistent with dysfunction in the right prefrontal cortex, a common finding in neuroimaging studies. Various lines of evidence from post-mortem studies and the putative mechanisms of anti-manic agents point to abnormalities in GSK-3, dopamine, Protein kinase C, and Inositol monophosphatase.

Meta analysis of neuroimaging studies demonstrate increased thalamic activity, and bilaterally reduced inferior frontal gyrus activation. Activity in the amygdala and other subcortical structures such as the ventral striatum tend to be increased, although results are inconsistent and likely dependent upon task characteristics such as valence. Reduced functional connectivity between the ventral prefrontal cortex and amygdala along with variable findings supports a hypothesis of general dysregulation of subcortical structures by the prefrontal cortex. A bias towards positively valenced stimuli, and increased responsiveness in reward circuitry may predispose towards mania. Mania tends to be associated with right hemisphere lesions, while depression tends to be associated with left hemisphere lesions.

Post-mortem examinations of bipolar disorder demonstrate increased expression of Protein Kinase C (PKC). While limited, some studies demonstrate manipulation of PKC in animals produces behavioral changes mirroring mania, and treatment with PKC inhibitor tamoxifen (also an anti-estrogen drug) demonstrates antimanic effects. Traditional antimanic drugs also demonstrate PKC inhibiting properties, among other effects such as GSK3 inhibition.

Manic episodes may be triggered by dopamine receptor agonists, and this combined with tentative reports of increased VMAT2 activity, measured via PET scans of radioligand binding, suggests
a role of dopamine in mania. Decreased cerebrospinal fluid levels of the serotonin metabolite 5-HIAA have been found in manic patients too, which may be explained by a failure of serotonergic regulation and dopaminergic hyperactivity.

Limited evidence suggests that mania is associated with behavioral reward hypersensitivity, as well as with neural reward hypersensitivity. Electrophysiological evidence supporting this comes from studies associating left frontal EEG activity with mania. As left frontal EEG activity is generally thought to be a reflection of behavioral activation system activity, this is thought to support a role for reward hypersensitivity in mania. Tentative evidence also comes from one study that reported an association between manic traits and feedback negativity during receipt of monetary reward or loss. Neuroimaging evidence during acute mania is sparse, but one study reported elevated orbitofrontal cortex activity to monetary reward, and another study reported elevated striatal activity to reward omission. The latter finding was interpreted in the context of either elevated baseline activity (resulting in a null finding of reward hypersensitivity), or reduced ability to discriminate between reward and punishment, still supporting reward hyperactivity in mania. Punishment hyposensitivity, as reflected in a number of neuroimaging studies as reduced lateral orbitofrontal response to punishment, has been proposed as a mechanism of reward hypersensitivity in mania.

==Diagnosis==

In the ICD-10, there are several disorders with the manic syndrome: organic manic disorder (), mania without psychotic symptoms (), mania with psychotic symptoms (), other manic episodes (), unspecified manic episode (), manic type of schizoaffective disorder (), bipolar disorder, current episode manic without psychotic symptoms (), bipolar affective disorder, current episode manic with psychotic symptoms ().

== Treatment ==
Before beginning treatment for mania, careful differential diagnosis must be performed to rule out secondary causes.

The acute treatment of a manic episode of bipolar disorder involves the utilization of either a mood stabilizer (e.g.,carbamazepine, valproate, lithium, or lamotrigine) or an atypical antipsychotic (e.g., olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, aripiprazole, or cariprazine). More recently, substances such as iloperidone have been approved for the acute treatment of manic episodes related to bipolar I disorder. The use of antipsychotic agents in the treatment of acute mania was reviewed by Tohen and Vieta in 2009.

When the manic behaviours have gone, long-term treatment then focuses on prophylactic treatment to try to stabilize the patient&#x27;s mood, typically through a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. The likelihood of having a relapse is very high for those who have experienced two or more episodes of mania or depression. While medication for bipolar disorder is important to manage symptoms of mania and depression, studies show relying on medications alone is not the most effective method of treatment. Medication is most effective when used in combination with other bipolar disorder treatments, including psychotherapy, self-help coping strategies, and healthy lifestyle choices.

Lithium is the classic mood stabilizer to prevent further manic and depressive episodes. A systematic review found that long term lithium treatment substantially reduces the risk of bipolar manic relapse, by 42%. Anticonvulsants such as valproate, oxcarbazepine, and carbamazepine are also used for prophylaxis. More recent drug solutions include lamotrigine and topiramate, both anticonvulsants as well.

In some cases, long-acting benzodiazepines, particularly clonazepam, are used after other options are exhausted. In more urgent circumstances, such as in emergency rooms, lorazepam, combined with haloperidol, is used to promptly alleviate symptoms of agitation, aggression, and psychosis.

Antidepressant monotherapy is not recommended for the treatment of depression in patients with bipolar disorders I or II, and no benefit has been demonstrated by combining antidepressants with mood stabilizers in these patients. Some atypical antidepressants, however, such as mirtazapine and trazodone, have been occasionally used after other options have failed.

== Society and culture ==

In &quot;Electroboy: A Memoir of Mania&quot; by Andy Behrman, he describes his experience of mania as &quot;the most perfect prescription glasses with which to see the world... life appears in front of you like an oversized movie screen.&quot; Behrman indicates early in his memoir that he sees himself not as a person with an uncontrollable disabling illness, but as a director of the movie that is his vivid and emotionally alive life. There is some evidence that people in the creative industries have bipolar disorder more often than those in other occupations.
Winston Churchill had periods of manic symptoms that may have been both an asset and a liability.

English actor Stephen Fry, who has bipolar disorder, recounts manic behaviour during his adolescence: &quot;When I was about 17 ... going around London on two stolen credit cards, it was a sort of fantastic reinvention of myself, an attempt to. I bought ridiculous suits with stiff collars and silk ties from the 1920s, and would go to the Savoy and Ritz and drink cocktails.&quot; While he has experienced suicidal thoughts, he says the manic side of his condition has had positive contributions on his life.

==Etymology==
The nosology of the various stages of a manic episode has changed over the decades. The word derives from the Ancient Greek μανία (&quot;manía&quot;), &quot;madness, frenzy&quot; and the verb μαίνομαι (&quot;maínomai&quot;), &quot;to be mad, to rage, to be furious.&quot;

<text>Multimedia refers to the integration of multiple forms of content, such as text, audio, images, video, and interactive elements into a single digital platform or application. This integration allows for a more immersive and engaging experience compared to traditional single-medium content. Multimedia is utilized in various fields, including education, entertainment, communication, game design, and digital art, reflecting its broad impact on modern technology and media.

Multimedia encompasses various types of content, each serving different purposes:

* Text - Fundamental to multimedia, providing context and information.

* Audio - Includes music, sound effects, and voiceovers that enhance the experience. Recent developments include spatial audio and advanced sound design.

* Images - Static visual content, such as photographs and illustrations. Advances include high-resolution and 3D imaging technologies.

* Video - Moving images that convey dynamic content. High-definition (HD), 4K, and 360-degree video are recent innovations enhancing viewer engagement.

* Animation - the technique of creating moving images from still pictures, often used in films, television, and video games to bring characters and stories to life.

Multimedia can be recorded for playback on computers, laptops, smartphones, and other electronic devices. In the early years of multimedia, the term &quot;rich media&quot; was synonymous with interactive multimedia. Over time, hypermedia extensions brought multimedia to the World Wide Web, and streaming services became more common.

== Terminology ==
The term &quot;multimedia&quot; was coined by singer and artist Bob Goldstein (later &#x27;Bobb Goldsteinn&#x27;) to promote the July 1966 opening of his &quot;Lightworks at L&#x27;Oursin&quot; show in Southampton, New York, Long Island. Goldstein was perhaps aware of an American artist named Dick Higgins, who had two years previously discussed a new approach to art-making he called &quot;intermedia&quot;.

On August 10, 1966, Richard Albarino of &quot;Variety&quot; borrowed the terminology, reporting: &quot;Brainchild of song scribe-comic Bob (&#x27;Washington Square&#x27;) Goldstein, the &#x27;Lightworks&#x27; is the latest &quot;multi-media&quot; music-cum-visuals to debut as discothèque fare.&quot; Two years later, in 1968, the term &quot;multimedia&quot; was re-appropriated to describe the work of a political consultant, David Sawyer, the husband of Iris Sawyer—one of Goldstein&#x27;s producers at L&#x27;Oursin.

 In the intervening forty years, the word has taken on different meanings. In the late 1970s, the term referred to presentations consisting of multi-projector slide shows timed to an audio track. However, by the 1990s, &#x27;multimedia&#x27; had taken on its current meaning.

In the 1993 first edition of &quot;Multimedia: Making It Work&quot;, Tay Vaughan declared, &quot;Multimedia is any combination of text, graphic art, sound, animation, and video that is delivered by computer. When you allow the user – the viewer of the project – to control what and when these elements are delivered, it is &quot;interactive multimedia&quot;. When you provide a structure of linked elements through which the user can navigate, interactive multimedia becomes &quot;hypermedia&quot;.&quot; This book contained the &quot;Tempra Show&quot; software. This was a later, rebranded version of the 1985 DOS multimedia software &quot;VirtulVideo Producer,&quot; about which the Smithsonian declared, &quot;It is one of the first, if not the first, multi-media authoring systems on the market.&quot; 

The German language society Gesellschaft für deutsche Sprache recognized the word&#x27;s significance and ubiquitousness in the 1990s by awarding it the title of German &#x27;Word of the Year&#x27; in 1995. The institute summed up its rationale by stating, &quot;[Multimedia] has become a central word in the wonderful new media world&quot;.

In common usage, &quot;multimedia&quot; refers to the usage of multiple media of communication, including video, still images, animation, audio, and text, in such a way that they can be accessed interactively. Video, still images, animation, audio, and written text are the building blocks on which multimedia takes shape. In the 1990s, some computers were called &quot;multimedia computers&quot; because they represented advances in graphical and audio quality, such as the Amiga 1000, which could produce 4096 colors (12-bit color), outputs for TVs and VCRs, and four-voice stereo audio. Multimedia used to be saved on CD-ROMs, which could store roughly 700 MB of data, and floppy disks, which could only store 1.44 MB. Multimedia files are now easier to keep and retrieve because of the widespread usage of USB devices, cloud storage, and solid-state drives (SSDs), which provide significantly greater speed and space. Greater storage allowed for larger digital media files and therefore more complex multimedia.

The term &quot;video,&quot; if not used exclusively to describe motion photography, is ambiguous in multimedia terminology. &quot;Video&quot; is often used to describe the file format, delivery format, or presentation format instead of &quot;footage,&quot; which is used to distinguish motion photography from &quot;animation&quot; of rendered motion imagery. Multiple forms of information content are often not considered modern forms of presentation, such as audio or video. Likewise, single forms of information content with single methods of information processing (e.g., non-interactive audio) are often called multimedia, perhaps to distinguish static media from active media. In the fine arts, for example, Leda Luss Luyken&#x27;s ModulArt brings two key elements of musical composition and film into the world of painting: variation of a theme and movement of and within a picture, making &quot;ModulArt&quot; an interactive multimedia form of art. Performing arts may also be considered multimedia, considering that performers and props are multiple forms of both content and media.

In modern times, a multimedia device can be referred to as an electronic device, such as a smartphone, a video game system, or a computer. Each and every one of these devices has a main function but also has other uses beyond their intended purpose, such as reading, writing, recording video and audio, listening to music, and playing video games. This has led them to be called &quot;multimedia devices.&quot; While previous media was always local, many are now handled through web-based solutions, particularly streaming.

== Major characteristics ==
Multimedia presentations are presentations featuring multiple types of media. The different types of media can include text, graphics, audio, video, and animations. These different types of media convey information to their target audience and effectively communicate with them. Videos are a great visual example to use in multimedia presentations because they can create visual aids to the presenter&#x27;s ideas. They are commonly used among education and many other industries to benefit students and workers, as they effectively retain chunks of information in a limited amount of time and can be stored easily. Another example is charts and graphs, as the presenters can show their audience the trends using data associated with their researches. This provides the audience a visual idea of a company&#x27;s capabilities and performances. Audio also helps people understand the message being presented, as most modern videos are combined with audio to increase their efficiency, while animations are made to simplify things from the presenter&#x27;s perspective. These technological methods allow efficient communication and understanding across a wide range of audiences (with an even wider range of abilities) throughout different fields, which create a more engaging experience for the audience. With the creation of Zoom and other such platforms, the immersive interaction is even more widely available to more people. Now people can be the audience for a presentation without having to travel to see it. This makes conferences more accessible to more people. &quot;With the increasing remote working trends in today’s digital age, virtual meetings have become integral to business and social communication. For people with disabilities, these virtual meetings on digital platforms can sometimes pose accessibility challenges.&quot; 

Multimedia games and simulations may be used in a physical environment with special effects, with multiple users in an online network, or locally with an offline computer, game system, simulator, virtual reality, or augmented reality.

The various formats of technological or digital multimedia may be intended to enhance the users&#x27; experience, for example, to make it easier and faster to convey information. Or in entertainment or art, combine an array of artistic insights that include elements from different art forms to engage, inspire, or captivate an audience.
Enhanced levels of interactivity are made possible by combining multiple forms of media content. Online multimedia is increasingly becoming object-oriented and data-driven, enabling applications with collaborative end-user innovation and personalization on multiple forms of content over time. Examples of these range from multiple forms of content on websites, like photo galleries with both images (pictures) and titles (text) user-updated, to simulations whose coefficients, events, illustrations, animations, or videos are modifiable, allowing the multimedia &quot;experience&quot; to be altered without reprogramming. In addition to seeing and hearing, haptic technology enables virtual objects to be felt. Emerging technology involving illusions of taste and smell may also enhance the multimedia experience.

== Categorization ==
Multimedia may be broadly divided into linear and non-linear categories:
*Linear active content progresses often without any navigational control, only focusing on the user to watch the entire piece by involving higher levels of emotional and sensory stimulation based on what&#x27;s being shown as a cinema presentation;
*Non-linear uses interactivity to control progress as with a video game or self-paced computer-based training so that the actions made will be based on how the user interacts within the simulated world. Hypermedia is an example of non-linear content.

Multimedia presentations can be live or recorded:
*A recorded presentation may allow interactivity via a navigation system;
*A live multimedia presentation may allow interactivity via an interaction with the presenter or performer.

== Usage/Application ==

Multimedia finds its application in various areas, including, but not limited to, advertisements, art, education, entertainment, engineering, medicine, mathematics, business, scientific research, and spatial temporal applications. Several examples are as follows:

=== Creative industries ===
Creative industries use multimedia for various purposes, ranging from fine arts, entertainment, commercial art, and journalism, to media and software services provided for any of the industries listed below. An individual multimedia designer may cover the spectrum throughout their career. Requests for their skills range from technical to analytical to creative. Multimedia, but more impressively in the modern day, the interactivity of the multimedia created forms the foundation for which most creative endeavors that take place online. Microsoft is one of the biggest computer industries in the world, and the core foundation of its success relies on the ability of multimedia designers to optimize user experience through interacting with their products.

=== Commercial uses ===
Marketing and commercial practices increasingly rely on interactive multimedia, allowing for more sophisticated tactics and increased customer retention. Advertising companies heavily utilize social media, online interfaces, and television to promote products, while ads and websites that utilize pop-ups need shorter, more concise methods to be as efficient and pleasing to potential customers as possible. These platforms can be used by commercial businesses to specifically target their desired audience with a message, advertisement, or promotion. External and internal office communications are often developed by hired creative service firms to display information in a variety of situations. This can range from providing more engaging presentations to educating trainees or new workers on a company&#x27;s policies or process. Commercial multimedia developers may also be hired to design for governmental services or nonprofit service applications, usually in the form of campaign websites and commercials aimed at the general public. Data mining within multimedia platforms can also allow advertisers to adjust their marketing techniques to quickly and efficiently understand the demographic of their target audience. : Recently developed techniques include digital billboards, often placed on the side of buildings and wrapped around the edge or corner. Clips can then be added at differing angles to create a three-dimensional optical illusion, which is more likely to draw the attention of an observer.

=== Entertainment and fine arts ===
Multimedia is heavily used in the entertainment industry, especially to develop special effects in movies and animations (VFX, 3D animation, etc.). Multimedia games are a popular pastime and are software programs available either as CD-ROMs or online. Video games are considered multimedia, as they meld animation, audio, and interactivity to give the player an immersive experience. While video games can vary in terms of animation style or audio type, the element of interactivity makes them a striking example of &quot;interactive multimedia&quot;. &quot;Interactive multimedia&quot; refers to multimedia applications that allow users to actively participate instead of just sitting by as passive recipients of information.
In the arts, there are multimedia artists who blend techniques using different media that in some way incorporate interaction with the viewer. Another approach entails the creation of multimedia that can be displayed in a traditional fine arts arena, such as an art gallery. Video has become an intrinsic part of many concerts and theatrical productions in the modern era and has spawned content creation opportunities for many media professionals. The first interactive music-only CD, No World Order by Todd Rundgren, was released in 1993. The CD acted as a customizable album. Although multimedia display material may be volatile, the survivability of the content is as strong as any traditional medium.

=== Education ===
In education, multimedia is used to produce computer-based training courses (popularly called CBTs) and reference books like encyclopedias and almanacs. A CBT lets the user go through a series of presentations, text about a particular topic, and associated illustrations in various information formats.

Learning theory in the past decade has expanded dramatically because of the introduction of multimedia. Several lines of research have evolved, e.g., cognitive load and multimedia learning.

From multimedia learning (MML) theory, David Roberts has developed a large group lecture practice using PowerPoint based on the use of full-slide images in conjunction with a reduction of visible text (all text can be placed in the notes view&#x27; section of PowerPoint). The method has been applied and evaluated in 9 disciplines. In each experiment, students&#x27; engagement and active learning have been approximately 66% greater than with the same material being delivered using bullet points, text, and speech, corroborating a range of theories presented by multimedia learning scholars like Sweller and Mayer. The idea of media convergence is also becoming a major factor in education, particularly higher education. Defined as separate technologies such as voice (and telephony features), data (and productivity applications), and video that now share resources and interact with each other, media convergence is rapidly changing the curriculum in universities all over the world. Higher education has been implementing the use of social media applications such as Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, etc. to increase student collaboration and develop new processes in how information can be conveyed to students.

==== Educational technology ====

Multimedia provides students with an alternate means of acquiring knowledge designed to enhance teaching and learning through various media and platforms. In the 1960s, technology began to expand into classrooms through devices such as screens and telewriters. This technology allows students to learn at their own pace and gives teachers the ability to observe the individual needs of each student. The capacity for multimedia to be used in multi-disciplinary settings is structured around the idea of creating a hands-on learning environment through the use of technology. Lessons can be tailored to the subject matter as well as personalized to the students&#x27; varying levels of knowledge on the topic. Learning content can be managed through activities that utilize and take advantage of multimedia platforms. This kind of usage of modern multimedia encourages interactive communication between students and teachers and opens feedback channels, introducing an active learning process, especially with the prevalence of new media and social media. Technology has impacted multimedia as it is largely associated with the use of computers or other electronic devices and digital media due to its capabilities concerning research, communication, problem-solving through simulations, and feedback opportunities. The innovation of technology in education through the use of multimedia allows for diversification among classrooms to enhance the overall learning experience for students.

Within education, video games, specifically fast-paced action games, are able to play a big role in improving cognitive abilities involving attention, task switching, and resistance to distractors. Research also shows that, though video games may take time away from schoolwork, implementing games into the school curriculum has an increased probability of moving attention from games to curricular goals. 

=== Social work ===
Multimedia is a robust education methodology within the social work context. The five different types of multimedia that support the education process are narrative media, interactive media, communicative media, adaptive media, and productive media. Contrary to long-standing belief, multimedia technology in social work education existed before the prevalence of the internet. It takes the form of images, audio, and video into the curriculum.

First introduced to social work education by Seabury &amp; Maple in 1993, multimedia technology is utilized to teach social work practice skills, including interviewing, crisis intervention, and group work. In comparison with conventional teaching methods, including face-to-face courses, multimedia education shortens transportation time, increases knowledge and confidence in a richer and more authentic context for learning, generates interaction between online users, and enhances understanding of conceptual materials for novice students.

In an attempt to examine the impact of multimedia technology on students&#x27; studies, A. Elizabeth Cauble &amp; Linda P. Thurston conducted research in which Building Family Foundations (BFF), an interactive multimedia training platform, was utilized to assess social work students&#x27; reactions to multimedia technology on variables of knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy. The results state that respondents show a substantial increase in academic knowledge, confidence, and attitude. Multimedia also benefits students because it brings experts online, fits students&#x27; schedule, and allows students to choose courses that suit them.

Mayer&#x27;s Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning suggests that &quot;people learn more from words and pictures than from words alone.&quot; According to Mayer and other scholars, multimedia technology stimulates people&#x27;s brains by implementing visual and auditory effects and thereby assists online users to learn efficiently. Researchers suggest that when users establish dual channels while learning, they tend to understand and memorize better. The mixed literature of this theory is still present in the fields of multimedia and social work.

=== Language communication ===
With the spread and development of the English language around the world, multimedia has become an important way of communicating between different people and cultures. Multimedia technology creates a platform where language can be taught. The traditional form of teaching English as a Second Language in classrooms has drastically changed with the prevalence of technology, making it easier for students to obtain language learning skills. Multimedia motivates students to learn more languages through audio, visual, and animation support. It also helps create English contexts since an important aspect of learning a language is developing their grammar, vocabulary, and knowledge of pragmatics and genres. In addition, cultural connections in terms of forms, contexts, meanings, and ideologies have to be constructed. By improving thought patterns, multimedia develops students&#x27; communicative competence by improving their capacity to understand the language. One of the studies, carried out by Izquierdo, Simard and Pulido, presented the correlation between &quot;Multimedia Instruction (MI) and learners&#x27; second language (L2)&quot; and its effects on learning behavior. Their findings, based on Gardner&#x27;s theory of the &quot;socio-educational model of learner motivation and attitudes,&quot; show that there is easier access to language learning materials as well as increased motivation with MI along with the use of computer-assisted language learning.

=== Journalism ===
Newspaper companies all over the world are trying to embrace the new phenomenon by implementing its practices in their work. While some have been slow to come around, other major newspapers like &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;USA Today,&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; are setting a precedent for the positioning of the newspaper industry in a globalized world. To keep up with the changing world of multimedia, journalistic practices are adopting and utilizing different multimedia functions through the inclusion of visuals such as varying audio, video, text, etc. in their writings.

News reporting is not limited to traditional media outlets. Freelance journalists can use different new media to produce multimedia pieces for their news stories. It engages global audiences and tells stories with technology, which develops new communication techniques for both media producers and consumers. The Common Language Project, later renamed The Seattle Globalist, is an example of this type of multimedia journalism production.

Multimedia reporters who are mobile (usually driving around a community with cameras, audio and video recorders, and laptop computers) are often referred to as mojos, or &quot;mobile &quot;journalists.

=== Multimedia Engineering ===
Software engineers may use multimedia in computer simulations for anything from entertainment to training, such as military or industrial training. Multimedia for software interfaces is often done as a collaboration between creative professionals and software engineers. Multimedia helps expand the teaching practices that can be found in engineering to allow for more innovative methods to not only educate future engineers but to help evolve the scope of understanding of where multimedia can be used in specialized engineer careers like software engineers.

Multimedia is also allowing major car manufacturers, such as Ford and General Motors, to expand the design and safety standards of their cars. By using a game engine and virtual reality glasses, these companies are able to test the safety features and the design of the car before a prototype is even made. Building a car virtually reduces the time it takes to produce new vehicles, cutting down on the time needed to test designs and allowing the designers to make changes in real time. It also reduces expenses since, with a virtual car, making real-world prototypes is no longer needed.

=== Mathematical and scientific research ===

In mathematical and scientific research, multimedia is mainly used for modeling and simulation with binary code. For example, a scientist can look at a molecular model of a particular substance and manipulate it to arrive at a new substance. Representative research can be found in journals such as the &quot;Journal of Multimedia&quot;. One well-known example of this being applied would be in the movie Interstellar, where Executive Director Kip Thorne helped create one of the most realistic depictions of a black hole in film. The visual effects team under Paul Franklin took Kip Thorne&#x27;s mathematical data and applied it into their own visual effects engine called &quot;Double Negative Gravitational Renderer,&quot; a.k.a. &quot;Gargantua,&quot; to create a &quot;real&quot; black hole used in the final cut. Later on, the visual effects team went on to publish a black hole study.

=== Medicine ===
Medical professionals and students have a wide variety of ways to learn new techniques and procedures through interactive media, online courses, and lectures. The methods of conveying information to students have drastically evolved with the help of multimedia. From the 1800s to today, lessons are commonly taught using chalkboards. Projected aids, such as the epidiascope and slide projectors, were introduced into classrooms around the 1960s. With the growing use of computers, the medical field has begun to incorporate new devices and procedures to assist in teaching students, performing procedures, and analyzing patient data. As well as providing that data in a meaningful way to the patients.

=== Virtual reality ===

Virtual reality is a technology that creates a simulated environment, often using computer-generated imagery or a combination of real and virtual content, to immerse users in an interactive and lifelike experience. The aim of virtual reality is to make users feel as if they are physically present in a different environment, even though they are typically still physically located in the real world. Virtual reality finds applications across various fields, including gaming, education, healthcare, training, and entertainment. In gaming, users can be transported to fantastical worlds, experiencing games in a more immersive way. In education, VR can provide realistic simulations for training purposes, allowing users to practice skills in a risk-free environment. Healthcare professionals use VR for therapeutic purposes and medical training. The U.S. Air Force has shown using VR for training programs for their new pilots to simulate piloting an aircraft. People have also used VR in a court room to show the judge how an interaction took place to try and get a clearer understanding of why the client might have done what they did. This allows new pilots to learn in a safe environment and get comfortable before getting in a real aircraft.

Head-mounted display (HMD): Users wear a headset that covers their eyes and ears, providing visual and auditory stimuli. These headsets are equipped with screens that display the virtual environment, and some may also have built-in speakers or headphones for audio. 

Motion tracking: Sensors track the user&#x27;s movements, allowing them to interact with the virtual world. This can include head movements, hand gestures, and sometimes even full-body movements, enhancing the sense of immersion.

Input devices: Controllers or other input devices are used to interact with the virtual environment. These devices can simulate hands or tools, enabling users to manipulate objects or navigate within the virtual space.

Computer processing: Powerful computers or gaming consoles are often required to generate and render the complex graphics and simulations needed for a convincing virtual experience.

=== Augmented reality ===

Augmented reality overlays digital content or output onto the real world using media such as audio, animation, and text. Augmented reality became widely popular only in the 21st century; however, some of the earlier versions of such were things like the Sega Genesis Activator Controller back in 1992, which allowed users to literally stand in an octagon and control in-game movement with physical movement, or to stretch back even further, the R.O.B. NES Robot back in 1984, which, with its array of accessories, was able to also provide users with the sensation of holding a firearm. These multimedia input devices are among the earliest of the augmented reality devices, allowing users to input commands to facilitate a different user experience. A more modern example of augmented reality is Pokémon GO, a mobile game released on July 6, 2016, which allows users to see a Pokémon in a real-world environment.

<doc id="20421" wikidata="Q1912691" url="?curid=20421" title="Max Headroom (TV series)">
<text>Max Headroom is an American satirical cyberpunk science fiction television series by Chrysalis Visual Programming and Lakeside Productions for Lorimar-Telepictures that aired in the United States on ABC from March 31, 1987, to May 5, 1988. The series is set in a futuristic dystopia ruled by an oligarchy of television networks, and features the character and media personality Max Headroom. The story is based on the Channel 4 British TV film produced by Chrysalis, &quot;Max Headroom: 20 Minutes into the Future&quot;.

== Premise ==
In the future, an oligarchy of television networks rules the world. Even the government functions primarily as a puppet of the network executives, serving mainly to pass laws—such as banning &quot;off&quot; switches on televisions—that protect and consolidate the networks&#x27; power. Television technology has advanced to the point that viewers&#x27; physical movements and thoughts can be monitored through their television sets. Almost all non-television technology has been discontinued or destroyed. The only real check on the power of the networks is Edison Carter, a crusading investigative journalist who regularly exposes the unethical practices of his own employer, and the team of allies both inside and outside the system who assist him in getting his reports to air and protecting him from the forces that wish to silence or kill him.

==Characters==
=== Edison Carter ===
Edison Carter (Matt Frewer) is a hard-hitting reporter for Network 23, who sometimes uncovers things that his superiors in the network would prefer be kept private. Eventually, one of these instances requires him to flee his workspace, and he is injured in a motorcycle accident in a parking lot.

Edison cares about his co-workers, especially Theora Jones and Bryce Lynch, and he has a deep respect for his producer, Murray (although he rarely shows it).

=== Max Headroom ===
Max Headroom (Frewer) is a computer reconstruction of Carter, created after Bryce Lynch uploads a copy of his mind. He appears as a computer-rendered bust of Carter superimposed on a wire-frame background. Since Carter&#x27;s last sight before the motorcycle crash are the sign &quot;Max. headroom&quot; on a parking garage gate, these are the reconstruction&#x27;s first words and ultimately his name. While Carter is a dedicated professional, Max is a wisecracking observer of human contradictions.

Despite being the titular character, Max appears rarely in the show. While he occasionally plays a significant part in a plot—sometimes by traveling through networks to gain information or by revealing secrets about Carter that Carter himself would not divulge—his most frequent role is as comic relief, delivering brief quips in reaction to events or giving a humorous soliloquy at the end of an episode.

=== Theora Jones ===
Theora Jones first appeared in the British-made television pilot film for the series. She was Network 23&#x27;s star controller (&quot;stolen&quot; from the World One Network by Murray) and, working with Edison, the network&#x27;s star reporter, she often helped save the day for everyone. She was also a potential love interest for Edison, but that subplot was not explored fully on the show before it was cancelled.

Network 23&#x27;s personnel files list her father as unknown, her mother as deceased, and her brother as Shawn Jones; Shawn is the focus on the second episode broadcast, &quot;Rakers&quot;.

Theora Jones was played by Amanda Pays, who along with Matt Frewer and W. Morgan Sheppard, was one of only three cast members to also appear in the American-made series that followed.

=== Ben Cheviot ===
Cheviot (George Coe), was one of the executives on Network 23&#x27;s board of directors. He later becomes the board&#x27;s new chairman after Ned Grossberg is fired in the wake of the Blipvert incident. He is mostly ethical and almost invariably backs Edison Carter, occasionally against the wishes of the Network 23 board of directors. However, he has compromised himself on a few occasions when he felt the ratings for the Network would rise using methods that were questionable such as allowing the network to copyright the exclusive news of a terrorist organization, and mixing sex and politics. He once had an affair with board member Julia Fornby, though by the start of the show they had ended it long ago. Cheviot, while usually rolling over for his greatest client, did not do so when they attempted to supplant television networks themselves.

=== Bryce Lynch ===
Bryce Lynch (Chris Young), a child prodigy and computer hacker, is Network 23&#x27;s one-man technology research department.

In the stereotypical hacker ethos, Bryce has few principles and fewer loyalties. He seems to accept any task, even morally questionable ones, as long as he is allowed to have the freedom to play with technology however he sees fit. This, in turn, makes him a greater asset to the technological needs and demands of the network, and the whims of its executives and stars. However, he also generally does not hurt or infringe on others, making him a rare neutral character in the Max Headroom universe.

In the pilot episode of the series, Bryce is enlisted by evil network CEO Ned Grossberg (Charles Rocket) to investigate the mental patterns of unconscious reporter Edison Carter, to determine whether or not Carter has discovered the secrets of the &quot;Blipverts&quot; scandal. Bryce uploads the contents of Carter&#x27;s memory into the Network 23 computer system, creating Max Headroom. It had been Bryce, following orders from Grossberg, who fought a hacking battle of sorts with Theora Jones that led to Edison hitting his head on a traffic barrier and falling unconscious.

After the first episode, Bryce is generally recruited by Carter and his controller, Theora Jones, to provide technical aid to their investigative reporting efforts.

=== Murray McKenzie ===
Murray (Jeffrey Tambor), Carter&#x27;s serious and high-strung producer, whose job often becomes a balancing act between supporting Carter&#x27;s stories and pleasing Network 23&#x27;s executives. In his younger years he was also a field reporter and may have had some experience with the systems of a controller, though the system in his younger years had changed since and would not be reliable to replace one. When creating the &quot;What I Want To Know Show&quot; it was a toss-up between Edison Carter and another reporter and Murray &quot;Choose The Best&quot; a decision that would have future repercussions. Murray is divorced and sees his kids on weekends.

=== Blank Reg ===
Reg (W. Morgan Sheppard) is a &quot;blank&quot;, a person not indexed in the government&#x27;s database. He broadcasts the underground Big Time Television Network from his bus. He is a good friend of Edison Carter, and saves him on more than one occasion. With colleague/lover Dominique, he operates and is the onscreen voice of Big Time television, &quot;All day every day, making tomorrow seem like yesterday.&quot;

He dresses in a punk style and has a Mohawk haircut. He has an energetic personality and a strong nostalgic streak, defending antiquated music videos and printed books in equal measure, despite not having the ability to read.

=== Ned Grossberg ===
Ned Grossberg is a recurring villain on the series, played by former &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; cast member Charles Rocket.

In the pilot episode, Grossberg is the chairman of Network 23, a major city television station with the highest-rated investigative-news show in town, hosted by Edison Carter. In the Max Headroom world, real-time ratings equal advertising dollars, and advertisements have replaced stocks as the measure of corporate worth.

Grossberg, with his secret prodigy Bryce Lynch, develops a high-speed advertising delivery method known as Blipverts, which condenses full advertisements into a few seconds. When Carter discovers that Blipverts are killing people, Grossberg orders Lynch to prevent Carter from getting out of the building. Knocked unconscious, Carter&#x27;s memories are extracted into a computer by Lynch in order to determine whether Carter uncovered Grossberg&#x27;s knowledge of the danger of Blipverts. The resulting computer file of the memory-extraction process becomes Max Headroom, making Grossberg directly responsible for the creation of the character. In the end, Grossberg is publicly exposed as responsible for the Blipverts scandal, and is removed as chairman of Network 23.

A few episodes later, in &quot;Grossberg&#x27;s Return&quot;, Grossberg reappears as a board member of Network 66. Again, he invents a dubious advertising medium and convinces the chairman of the network to adopt it. When the advertising method is shown to be a complete fraud, the resulting public reaction against the network leads to the chairman being removed, and Grossberg manages to assume the chairmanship.

When under stress, Grossberg exhibits a tic of slightly stretching his neck in his suit&#x27;s collar, first seen in episode 1 when he confronts Lynch in his lab regarding Max retaining Carter&#x27;s memory about the blipverts.

In the UK telefilm &quot;Max Headroom: 20 Minutes Into the Future&quot; upon which the American series was based, the character was called Grossman and was played by Nickolas Grace.

===Other characters===
*Dominique (Concetta Tomei), co-proprietor of Big Time TV along with Blank Reg, managing the business aspects of running the station. It is implied that she and Reg are romantically involved, if not husband and wife. Although Dominique may not be a blank like Reg, as she possesses credit tubes, she behaves culturally as one.
*Breughel (Jere Burns), an intelligent, sociopathic criminal-for-hire who, along with Mahler, makes money disposing of corpses for other criminals by selling them to body banks around the city. However, he is not above selling out his employers if it means a big payoff, a fact which Edison Carter takes advantage of on several occasions while working on stories.
*Mahler (Rick Ducommun), Breughel&#x27;s accomplice, who serves primarily as the muscle of the duo&#x27;s body-harvesting operation. In &quot;Dream Thieves&quot;, it is revealed that Breughel killed Mahler and sold off his body during a slow night of business, and replaced him with a new man whom he nicknamed &quot;Mahler&quot; as a mocking tribute.
*Rik (J.W. Smith), a streetwise pedicab driver whom Edison Carter frequently employs when looking for information about the city&#x27;s underworld.
*Blank Bruno (Peter Crook), Bryce&#x27;s mentor, who is a revolutionary Blank who works to make life better for the city&#x27;s Blank population by any means short of murder. He has a pet toad, which he calls &quot;Gob&quot;.
*Blank Traker (Brian Brophy, Season 1 / Michael Preston, Season 2), one of Bruno&#x27;s fellow revolutionaries. 
*Martinez (Ricardo Gutierrez), one of Network 23&#x27;s helicopter pilots, he often works with Carter when he is out on assignment.
*Janie Crane (Lisa Niemi), one of Network 23&#x27;s second-tier reporters, who ends up breaking a few important stories of her own throughout the series.
*Angie Barry (Rosalind Chao), one of Network 23&#x27;s second-tier reporters. She often fills-in for Carter when he is indisposed.
*Joel Dung Po (Rob Narita), one of Network 23&#x27;s second-tier reporters.
*Julia Formby (Virginia Kiser), one of Network 23&#x27;s board members. In &quot;Body Banks&quot;, it is revealed that she once had an affair with Cheviot, for which she is blackmailed by a wealthy member of the Plantagenet family into stealing Max Headroom from Network 23 in the hope that Max&#x27;s program might be used to preserve the mind of his mother.
*Gene Ashwell (Hank Garrett), one of Network 23&#x27;s board members, who frequently panics when the network faces a crisis. It is revealed in &quot;Deities&quot; that he is a member of the Vu-Age Church, and is responsible for kidnapping Max on behalf of the church&#x27;s leader.
*Ms. Lauren (Sharon Barr), one of Network 23&#x27;s board members. Replaced Formby on the board after Formby grew weary of &quot;handling things at night&quot;.
*Mr. Edwards (Lee Wilkof), one of Network 23&#x27;s board members. He has a groveling disposition, and regards ratings as more important than life itself. Once cried at the thought of no one watching the network, and compared the potential end of network television to the end of the world.
*Simon Peller (Sherman Howard), a corrupt politician who receives financial backing from Network 23. He shares a mutual animosity with Carter, who despises Peller&#x27;s underhanded political tactics.
*Mr. Bartlett (Andreas Katsulas), one of the board members of Network 66. An incautious risk-taker, he frequently becomes directly involved in the network&#x27;s shady projects, going behind even Ned Grossberg&#x27;s back on occasion.
*Chubb Shaw (James F. Dean), one of the board members of Network 66.
*Dragul (John Durbin), a Network censor who disregards Blanks, and lives by the orders of computers even in defeat.
*Ped Xing (Arsenio Trinidad, Season 1 / Sab Shimono, Season 2), the head of the Zik-Zak corporation, Network 23&#x27;s primary sponsor.

==Development and production==
The series was based on the Channel 4 British TV film produced by Chrysalis, &quot;Max Headroom: 20 Minutes into the Future&quot;. Cinemax aired the UK pilot followed by a six-week run of highlights from &quot;The Max Headroom Show&quot;, a UK music video show where Headroom appears between music videos. ABC took an interest in the pilot and asked Chrysalis/Lakeside to produce the series for American audiences.

&quot;Max Headroom: 20 Minutes into the Future&quot; was re-shot as a pilot program for a new series broadcast by the U.S. ABC television network. The pilot featured plot changes and some minor visual touches, but retained the same basic storyline. The only original cast retained for the series were Matt Frewer (Max Headroom/Edison Carter) and Amanda Pays (Theora Jones); a third original cast member, W. Morgan Sheppard, joined the series as &quot;Blank Reg&quot; in later episodes. Among the non-original cast, Jeffrey Tambor co-starred as &quot;Murray&quot;, Edison Carter&#x27;s neurotic producer.

The show went into production in late 1986 and ran for six episodes in the first season and eight in the second.

==Episodes==

===Season 1 (1987)===
===Season 2 (1987–88)===
=== Notes ===
*Although unaired as part of the original U.S run, &quot;Baby Grobags&quot; was shown as part of the Australian series run.
*At least one unproduced script, &quot;Theora&#x27;s Tale&quot;, has surfaced, as have the titles of two other stories (&quot;The Trial&quot; and &quot;Xmas&quot;). Currently, little is known of &quot;The Trial&quot; aside from its title; George R. R. Martin wrote &quot;Xmas&quot;, in pre-production at cancellation time; &quot;Theora&#x27;s Tale&quot; would have featured the &quot;Video Freedom Alliance&quot; kidnapping Theora, and war in Antarctica, between rival advertisers Zik Zak and Zlin.

==Home media==
Shout! Factory (under license from Warner Bros. Home Entertainment) released &quot;Max Headroom: The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in the United States and Canada on August 10, 2010. The bonus features includes a round-table discussion with most of the major cast members (other than Matt Frewer), and interviews with the writers and producers.

==Reception==
The series began as a mid-season replacement in spring of 1987, and did well enough to be renewed for the fall television season, but the viewer ratings could not be sustained in direct competition with CBS&#x27;s Top 20 hit &quot;Dallas&quot; (also produced by Lorimar) and NBC&#x27;s Top 30 hit &quot;Miami Vice.&quot; &quot;Max Headroom&quot; was canceled part-way into its second season. The entire series, along with two previously unbroadcast episodes, was rerun in spring 1988 during the Writers Guild of America strike. In the late 1990s, U.S. cable TV channels Bravo and the Sci-Fi Channel re-ran the series. Reruns also briefly appeared on TechTV in 2001. A cinema spin-off titled &quot;Max Headroom for President&quot; was announced with production intended to start in early 1988 in order to capitalize on the 1988 United States presidential election, but it was never made.

&quot;Max Headroom&quot; has been called &quot;the first cyberpunk television series&quot;, with &quot;deep roots in the Western philosophical tradition&quot;.

==Reboot==

In 2022, a reboot of Max Headroom was announced, with Halt and Catch Fire co-creator Christopher Cantwell set to serve as the showrunner. Original Max Headroom actor Matt Frewer is slated to reprise his role in the revived series.

<doc id="20423" wikidata="Q12156" url="?curid=20423" title="Malaria">
<text>Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that affects vertebrates and &quot;Anopheles&quot; mosquitoes. Human malaria causes symptoms that typically include fever, fatigue, vomiting, and headaches. In severe cases, it can cause jaundice, seizures, coma, or death. Symptoms usually begin 10 to 15 days after being bitten by an infected &quot;Anopheles&quot; mosquito. If not properly treated, people may have recurrences of the disease months later. In those who have recently survived an infection, reinfection usually causes milder symptoms. This partial resistance disappears over months to years if the person has no continuing exposure to malaria. The mosquito vector is itself harmed by &quot;Plasmodium&quot; infections, causing reduced lifespan.

Human malaria is caused by single-celled microorganisms of the &quot;Plasmodium&quot; group. It is spread exclusively through bites of infected female &quot;Anopheles&quot; mosquitoes. The mosquito bite introduces the parasites from the mosquito&#x27;s saliva into a person&#x27;s blood. The parasites travel to the liver, where they mature and reproduce. Five species of &quot;Plasmodium&quot; commonly infect humans. The three species associated with more severe cases are &quot;P. falciparum&quot; (which is responsible for the vast majority of malaria deaths), &quot;P. vivax&quot;, and &quot;P. knowlesi&quot; (a simian malaria that spills over into thousands of people a year). &quot;P. ovale&quot; and &quot;P. malariae&quot; generally cause a milder form of malaria. Malaria is typically diagnosed by the microscopic examination of blood using blood films, or with antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests. Methods that use the polymerase chain reaction to detect the parasite&#x27;s DNA have been developed, but they are not widely used in areas where malaria is common, due to their cost and complexity.

The risk of disease can be reduced by preventing mosquito bites through the use of mosquito nets and insect repellents or with mosquito-control measures such as spraying insecticides and draining standing water. Several medications are available to prevent malaria for travellers in areas where the disease is common. Occasional doses of the combination medication sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine are recommended in infants and after the first trimester of pregnancy in areas with high rates of malaria. As of 2023, two malaria vaccines have been endorsed by the World Health Organization. The recommended treatment for malaria is a combination of antimalarial medications that includes artemisinin. The second medication may be either mefloquine (noting first its potential toxicity and the possibility of death), lumefantrine, or sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine. Quinine, along with doxycycline, may be used if artemisinin is not available. In areas where the disease is common, malaria should be confirmed if possible before treatment is started due to concerns of increasing drug resistance. Resistance among the parasites has developed to several antimalarial medications; for example, chloroquine-resistant &quot;P. falciparum&quot; has spread to most malarial areas, and resistance to artemisinin has become a problem in some parts of Southeast Asia. 

The disease is widespread in the tropical and subtropical regions that exist in a broad band around the equator. This includes much of sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America. In 2022, some 249 million cases of malaria worldwide resulted in an estimated 608,000 deaths, with 80 percent being five years old or less. Around 95% of the cases and deaths occurred in sub-Saharan Africa. Rates of disease decreased from 2010 to 2014, but increased from 2015 to 2021. According to UNICEF, nearly every minute, a child under five died of malaria in 2021, and &quot;many of these deaths are preventable and treatable&quot;. Malaria is commonly associated with poverty and has a significant negative effect on economic development. In Africa, it is estimated to result in losses of US$12 billion a year due to increased healthcare costs, lost ability to work, and adverse effects on tourism. The malaria caseload in India was slashed by 69 per cent from 6.4 million (64 lakh) in 2017 to two million (20 lakh) in 2023. Similarly, the estimated malaria deaths decreased from 11,100 to 3,500 (a 68-per cent decrease) in the same period.


== Etymology ==
The term &quot;malaria&quot; originates from Medieval &#x27;bad air&#x27;, a part of miasma theory; the disease was formerly called &quot;ague&quot; or &quot;marsh fever&quot; due to its association with swamps and marshland. The term appeared in English at least as early as 1768. Malaria was once common in most of Europe and North America, where it is no longer endemic, though imported cases do occur.
The scientific study of malaria is called malariology.

==Signs and symptoms==
Adults with malaria tend to experience chills and fever—classically in periodic intense bouts lasting around six hours, followed by a period of sweating and fever relief—as well as headache, fatigue, abdominal discomfort, and muscle pain. Children tend to have more general symptoms: fever, cough, vomiting, and diarrhea.

Initial manifestations of the disease—common to all malaria species—are similar to flu-like symptoms, and can resemble other conditions such as sepsis, gastroenteritis, and viral diseases. The presentation may include headache, fever, shivering, joint pain, vomiting, hemolytic anemia, jaundice, hemoglobin in the urine, retinal damage, and convulsions.

The classic symptom of malaria is paroxysm—a cyclical occurrence of sudden coldness followed by shivering and then fever and sweating, occurring every two days (tertian fever) in &quot;P. vivax&quot; and &quot;P. ovale&quot; infections, and every three days (quartan fever) for &quot;P. malariae&quot;. &quot;P. falciparum&quot; infection can cause recurrent fever every 36–48 hours, or a less pronounced and almost continuous fever.

Symptoms typically begin 10–15 days after the initial mosquito bite, but can occur as late as several months after infection with some &quot;P. vivax&quot; strains. Travellers taking preventative malaria medications may develop symptoms once they stop taking the drugs.

Severe malaria is usually caused by &quot;P. falciparum&quot; (often referred to as falciparum malaria). Symptoms of falciparum malaria arise 9–30 days after infection. Individuals with cerebral malaria frequently exhibit neurological symptoms, including abnormal posturing, nystagmus, conjugate gaze palsy (failure of the eyes to turn together in the same direction), opisthotonus, seizures, or coma.

Diagnosis based on skin odor profiles

Humans emanate a large range of smells. Studies have been conducted on how to detect human malaria infections through volatile compounds from the skin - suggesting that volatile biomarkers may be a reliable source for the detection of infection, including those asymptomatic. Using skin body odor profiles can be efficient in diagnosing global populations, and the screening and monitoring of infection to officially eradicate malaria. Research findings have predominantly relied on chemical explanations to explain the differences in attractiveness among humans based on distinct odor profiles. The existence of volatile compounds, like fatty acids, and lactic acid is an essential reason on why some individuals are more appealing to mosquitos than others.

Volatile compounds

Kanika Khanna, a postdoctoral scholar at the University of California, Berkeley studying the structural basis of membrane manipulation and cell-cell fusion by bacterial pathogens, discusses studies that determine how odor profiles can be used to diagnose the disease. Within the study, samples of volatile compounds from around 400 children within schools in Western Kenya were collected - to identify asymptomatic infections. These biomarkers have been established as a non-invasive way to detect malarial infections. In addition, these volatile compounds were heavily detected by mosquito antennae as an attractant, making the children more vulnerable to the bite of the mosquitos.

Fatty acids

Fatty acids have been identified as an attractive compound for mosquitoes, they are typically found in volatile emissions from the skin. These fatty acids that produce body odor profiles originate from the metabolism of glycerol, lactic acid, amino acids, and lipids - through the action of bacteria found within the skin. They create a &quot;chemical signature&quot; for the mosquitoes to locate a potential host, humans in particular.

Lactic acid

Lactic acid, a naturally produced levorotatory isomer, has been titled an attractant of mosquitoes for a long time. Lactic acid is predominantly produced by eccrine-sweat glands, creating a large amount of sweat on the surface of the skin. Due to the high levels of lactic acid released from the human body, it has been hypothesized to represent a specific human host-recognition cue for anthropophilic (attracted to humans) mosquitoes.

Pungent foot odor

Most studies use human odors as stimuli to attract host seeking mosquitoes and have reported a strong and significant attractive effect. The studies have found human odor samples very effective in attracting mosquitoes. Foot odors have been demonstrated to have the highest attractiveness to anthropophilic mosquitoes. Some of these studies have included traps that had been baited with nylon socks previously worn by human participants and were deemed efficient in catching adult mosquitos. Foot odors have high numbers of volatile compounds, which in turn elicit an olfactory response from mosquitoes.

===Complications===
Malaria has several serious complications, including the development of respiratory distress, which occurs in up to 25% of adults and 40% of children with severe &quot;P. falciparum&quot; malaria. Possible causes include respiratory compensation of metabolic acidosis, noncardiogenic pulmonary oedema, concomitant pneumonia, and severe anaemia. Although rare in young children with severe malaria, acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs in 5–25% of adults and up to 29% of pregnant women. Coinfection of HIV with malaria increases mortality. Kidney failure is a feature of blackwater fever, where haemoglobin from lysed red blood cells leaks into the urine.

Infection with &quot;P. falciparum&quot; may result in cerebral malaria, a form of severe malaria that involves encephalopathy. It is associated with retinal whitening, which may be a useful clinical sign in distinguishing malaria from other causes of fever. An enlarged spleen, enlarged liver or both of these, severe headache, low blood sugar, and haemoglobin in the urine with kidney failure may occur. Complications may include spontaneous bleeding, coagulopathy, and shock. 

Cerebral malaria can bring about death within forty-eight hours of the first symptoms of the infection being evident. 

Malaria during pregnancy can cause stillbirths, infant mortality, miscarriage, and low birth weight, particularly in &quot;P. falciparum&quot; infection, but also with &quot;P. vivax&quot;.

==Cause==
Malaria is caused by infection with parasites in the genus &quot;Plasmodium&quot;. In humans, malaria is caused by six &quot;Plasmodium&quot; species: &quot;P. falciparum&quot;, &quot;P. malariae&quot;, &quot;P. ovale curtisi&quot;, &quot;P. ovale wallikeri&quot;, &quot;P. vivax&quot; and &quot;P. knowlesi&quot;. Among those infected, &quot;P. falciparum&quot; is the most common species identified (~75%) followed by &quot;P. vivax&quot; (~20%). Although &quot;P. falciparum&quot; traditionally accounts for the majority of deaths, recent evidence suggests that &quot;P. vivax&quot; malaria is associated with potentially life-threatening conditions about as often as with a diagnosis of &quot;P. falciparum&quot; infection. &quot;P. vivax&quot; proportionally is more common outside Africa. Some cases have been documented of human infections with several species of &quot;Plasmodium&quot; from higher apes, but except for &quot;P. knowlesi&quot;—a zoonotic species that causes malaria in macaques—these are mostly of limited public health importance.

The &quot;Anopheles&quot; mosquitos initially get infected by &quot;Plasmodium&quot; by taking a blood meal from a previously &quot;Plasmodium&quot; infected person or animal. Parasites are then typically introduced by the bite of an infected &quot;Anopheles&quot; mosquito. Some of these inoculated parasites, called &quot;sporozoites&quot;, probably remain in the skin, but others travel in the bloodstream to the liver, where they invade hepatocytes. They grow and divide in the liver for 2–10 days, with each infected hepatocyte eventually harboring up to 40,000 parasites. The infected hepatocytes break down, releasing these invasive &quot;Plasmodium&quot; cells, called &quot;merozoites&quot;, into the bloodstream. In the blood, the merozoites rapidly invade individual red blood cells, replicating over 24–72 hours to form 16–32 new merozoites. The infected red blood cell lyses, and the new merozoites infect new red blood cells, resulting in a cycle that continuously amplifies the number of parasites in an infected person. Over rounds of this infection cycle, a small portion of parasites do not replicate, but instead develop into early sexual stage parasites called male and female &quot;gametocytes&quot;. These gametocytes develop in the bone marrow for 11 days, then return to the blood circulation to await uptake by the bite of another mosquito. Once inside a mosquito, the gametocytes undergo sexual reproduction, and eventually form daughter sporozoites that migrate to the mosquito&#x27;s salivary glands to be injected into a new host when the mosquito bites.

The liver infection causes no symptoms; all symptoms of malaria result from the infection of red blood cells. Symptoms develop once there are more than around 100,000 parasites per milliliter of blood. Many of the symptoms associated with severe malaria are caused by the tendency of &quot;P. falciparum&quot; to bind to blood vessel walls, resulting in damage to the affected vessels and surrounding tissue. Parasites sequestered in the blood vessels of the lung contribute to respiratory failure. In the brain, they contribute to coma. In the placenta they contribute to low birthweight and preterm labor, and increase the risk of abortion and stillbirth. The destruction of red blood cells during infection often results in anemia, exacerbated by reduced production of new red blood cells during infection.

Only female mosquitoes feed on blood; male mosquitoes feed on plant nectar and do not transmit the disease. Females of the mosquito genus &quot;Anopheles&quot; prefer to feed at night. They usually start searching for a meal at dusk, and continue through the night until they succeed. However, in Africa, due to the extensive use of bed nets, they began to bite earlier, before bed-net time. Malaria parasites can also be transmitted by blood transfusions, although this is rare.

===Recurrent malaria===
Symptoms of malaria can recur after varying symptom-free periods. Depending upon the cause, recurrence can be classified as either recrudescence, relapse, or reinfection. Recrudescence is when symptoms return after a symptom-free period due to failure to remove blood-stage parasites by adequate treatment. Relapse is when symptoms reappear after the parasites have been eliminated from the blood but have persisted as dormant hypnozoites in liver cells. Relapse commonly occurs between 8 and 24 weeks after the initial symptoms and is often seen in &quot;P. vivax&quot; and &quot;P. ovale&quot; infections. &quot;P. vivax&quot; malaria cases in temperate areas often involve overwintering by hypnozoites, with relapses beginning the year after the mosquito bite. Reinfection means that parasites were eliminated from the entire body but new parasites were then introduced. Reinfection cannot readily be distinguished from relapse and recrudescence, although recurrence of infection within two weeks of treatment ending is typically attributed to treatment failure. People may develop some immunity when exposed to frequent infections.

==Pathophysiology==


Malaria infection develops via two phases: one that involves the liver (exoerythrocytic phase), and one that involves red blood cells, or erythrocytes (erythrocytic phase). When an infected mosquito pierces a person&#x27;s skin to take a blood meal, sporozoites in the mosquito&#x27;s saliva enter the bloodstream and migrate to the liver where they infect hepatocytes, multiplying asexually and asymptomatically for a period of 8–30 days.

After a potential dormant period in the liver, these organisms differentiate to yield thousands of merozoites, which, following rupture of their host cells, escape into the blood and infect red blood cells to begin the erythrocytic stage of the life cycle. The parasite escapes from the liver undetected by wrapping itself in the cell membrane of the infected host liver cell.

The parasites multiply asexually within red blood cells, periodically breaking out to infect new ones. This repeated cycle results in synchronized waves of merozoites escaping and invading red blood cells, which cause the characteristic fever patterns.

Some &quot;P. vivax&quot; sporozoites do not immediately develop into exoerythrocytic-phase merozoites, but instead, produce hypnozoites that remain dormant for periods ranging from several months (7–10 months is typical) to several years. After a period of dormancy, they reactivate and produce merozoites. Hypnozoites are responsible for long incubation and late relapses in &quot;P. vivax&quot; infections, although their existence in &quot;P. ovale&quot; is uncertain.

The parasite is relatively protected from attack by the body&#x27;s immune system because for most of its human life cycle it resides within the liver and blood cells and is relatively invisible to immune surveillance. However, circulating infected blood cells are destroyed in the spleen. To avoid this fate, the &quot;P. falciparum&quot; parasite displays adhesive proteins on the surface of the infected blood cells, causing the blood cells to stick to the walls of small blood vessels, thereby sequestering the parasite from passage through the general circulation and the spleen. The blockage of the microvasculature causes symptoms such as those in placental malaria. Sequestered red blood cells can breach the blood–brain barrier and cause cerebral malaria.

===Genetic resistance===

Due to the high levels of mortality and morbidity caused by malaria—especially the &quot;P. falciparum&quot; species—it has placed the greatest selective pressure on the human genome in recent history. Several genetic factors provide some resistance to it including sickle cell trait, thalassaemia traits, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, and the absence of Duffy antigens on red blood cells.

The impact of sickle cell trait on malaria immunity illustrates some evolutionary trade-offs that have occurred because of endemic malaria. Sickle cell trait causes a change in the haemoglobin molecule in the blood. Normally, red blood cells have a very flexible, biconcave shape that allows them to move through narrow capillaries; however, when the modified haemoglobin S molecules are exposed to low amounts of oxygen, or crowd together due to dehydration, they can stick together forming strands that cause the cell to distort into a curved sickle shape. In these strands, the molecule is not as effective in taking or releasing oxygen, and the cell is not flexible enough to circulate freely. In the early stages of malaria, the parasite can cause infected red cells to sickle, and so they are removed from circulation sooner. This reduces the frequency with which malaria parasites complete their life cycle in the cell. Individuals who are homozygous (with two copies of the abnormal haemoglobin beta allele) have sickle-cell anaemia, while those who are heterozygous (with one abnormal allele and one normal allele) experience resistance to malaria without severe anaemia. Although the shorter life expectancy for those with the homozygous condition would tend to disfavour the trait&#x27;s survival, the trait is preserved in malaria-prone regions because of the benefits provided by the heterozygous form.

===Liver dysfunction===
Liver dysfunction as a result of malaria is uncommon and usually only occurs in those with another liver condition such as viral hepatitis or chronic liver disease. The syndrome is sometimes called &quot;malarial hepatitis&quot;. While it has been considered a rare occurrence, malarial hepatopathy has seen an increase, particularly in Southeast Asia and India. Liver compromise in people with malaria correlates with a greater likelihood of complications and death.

=== Effects on vaccine response ===
Malaria infection affects the immune responses following vaccination for various diseases. For example, malaria suppresses immune responses to polysaccharide vaccines. A potential solution is to give curative treatment before vaccination in areas where malaria is present.

==Diagnosis==


Due to the non-specific nature of malaria symptoms, diagnosis is typically suspected based on symptoms and travel history, then confirmed with a laboratory test to detect the presence of the parasite in the blood (parasitological test). In areas where malaria is common, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends clinicians suspect malaria in any person who reports having fevers, or who has a current temperature above 37.5 °C without any other obvious cause. Malaria should be suspected in children with signs of anemia: pale palms or a laboratory test showing hemoglobin levels below 8 grams per deciliter of blood. In areas of the world with little to no malaria, the WHO recommends only testing people with possible exposure to malaria (typically travel to a malaria-endemic area) and unexplained fever.

In sub-Saharan Africa, testing is low, with only about one in four (28%) of children with a fever receiving medical advice or a rapid diagnostic test in 2021. There was a 10-percentage point gap in testing between the richest and the poorest children (33% vs 23%). Additionally, a greater proportion of children in Eastern and Southern Africa (36%) were tested than in West and Central Africa (21%). According to UNICEF, 61% of children with a fever were taken for advice or treatment from a health facility or provider in 2021. Disparities are also observed by wealth, with an 18 percentage point difference in care-seeking behaviour between children in the richest (71%) and the poorest (53%) households.

Malaria is usually confirmed by the microscopic examination of blood films or by antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests (RDT). Microscopy—i.e. examining Giemsa-stained blood with a light microscope—is the gold standard for malaria diagnosis. Microscopists typically examine both a &quot;thick film&quot; of blood, allowing them to scan many blood cells in a short time, and a &quot;thin film&quot; of blood, allowing them to clearly see individual parasites and identify the infecting &quot;Plasmodium&quot; species. Under typical field laboratory conditions, a microscopist can detect parasites when there are at least 100 parasites per microliter of blood, which is around the lower range of symptomatic infection. Microscopic diagnosis is relatively resource intensive, requiring trained personnel, specific equipment and a consistent supply of microscopy slides and stains.

In places where microscopy is unavailable, malaria is diagnosed with RDTs, rapid antigen tests that detect parasite proteins in a fingerstick blood sample. A variety of RDTs are commercially available, targeting the parasite proteins histidine rich protein 2 (HRP2, detects &quot;P. falciparum&quot; only), lactate dehydrogenase, or aldolase. The HRP2 test is widely used in Africa, where &quot;P. falciparum&quot; predominates. However, since HRP2 persists in the blood for up to five weeks after an infection is treated, an HRP2 test sometimes cannot distinguish whether someone currently has malaria or previously had it. Additionally, some &quot;P. falciparum&quot; parasites in the Amazon region lack the &quot;HRP2&quot; gene, complicating detection. RDTs are fast and easily deployed to places without full diagnostic laboratories. However they give considerably less information than microscopy, and sometimes vary in quality from producer to producer and lot to lot.

Serological tests to detect antibodies against &quot;Plasmodium&quot; from the blood have been developed, but are not used for malaria diagnosis due to their relatively poor sensitivity and specificity. Highly sensitive nucleic acid amplification tests have been developed, but are not used clinically due to their relatively high cost, and poor specificity for active infections.

===Classification===
Malaria is classified into either &quot;severe&quot; or &quot;uncomplicated&quot; by the World Health Organization (WHO). It is deemed severe when &quot;any&quot; of the following criteria are present, otherwise it is considered uncomplicated.
* Decreased consciousness
* Significant weakness such that the person is unable to walk
* Inability to feed
* Two or more convulsions
* Low blood pressure (less than 70 mmHg in adults and 50 mmHg in children)
* Breathing problems
* Circulatory shock
* Kidney failure or hemoglobin in the urine
* Bleeding problems, or hemoglobin less than 50 g/L (5 g/dL)
* Pulmonary oedema
* Blood glucose less than 2.2 mmol/L (40 mg/dL)
* Acidosis or lactate levels of greater than 5 mmol/L
* A parasite level in the blood of greater than 100,000 per microlitre (μL) in low-intensity transmission areas, or 250,000 per μL in high-intensity transmission areas

Cerebral malaria is defined as a severe &quot;P. falciparum&quot;-malaria presenting with neurological symptoms, including coma (with a Glasgow coma scale less than 11, or a Blantyre coma scale less than 3), or with a coma that lasts longer than 30 minutes after a seizure.

==Prevention==
Methods used to prevent malaria include medications, mosquito elimination and the prevention of bites. As of 2023, there are two malaria vaccines, approved for use in children by the WHO: RTS,S and R21. The presence of malaria in an area requires a combination of high human population density, high &quot;Anopheles&quot; mosquito population density and high rates of transmission from humans to mosquitoes and from mosquitoes to humans. If any of these is lowered sufficiently, the parasite eventually disappears from that area, as happened in North America, Europe, and parts of the Middle East. However, unless the parasite is eliminated from the whole world, it could re-establish if conditions revert to a combination that favors the parasite&#x27;s reproduction. Furthermore, the cost per person of eliminating anopheles mosquitoes rises with decreasing population density, making it economically unfeasible in some areas.

Prevention of malaria may be more cost-effective than treatment of the disease in the long run, but the initial costs required are out of reach of many of the world&#x27;s poorest people. There is a wide difference in the costs of control (i.e. maintenance of low endemicity) and elimination programs between countries. For example, in China—whose government in 2010 announced a strategy to pursue malaria elimination in the Chinese provinces—the required investment is a small proportion of public expenditure on health. In contrast, a similar programme in Tanzania would cost an estimated one-fifth of the public health budget. In 2021, the World Health Organization confirmed that China has eliminated malaria. In 2023, the World Health Organization confirmed that Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Belize have eliminated malaria.

In areas where malaria is common, children under five years old often have anaemia, which is sometimes due to malaria. Giving children with anaemia in these areas preventive antimalarial medication improves red blood cell levels slightly but does not affect the risk of death or need for hospitalisation.

===Mosquito control===

Vector control refers to methods used to decrease malaria by reducing the levels of transmission by mosquitoes. For individual protection, the most effective insect repellents are based on DEET or picaridin. However, there is insufficient evidence that mosquito repellents can prevent malaria infection. Insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) are effective, have been commonly used to prevent malaria, and their use has contributed significantly to the decrease in malaria in the 21st century. ITNs and IRS may not be sufficient to eliminate the disease, as these interventions depend on how many people use nets, how many gaps in insecticide there are (low coverage areas), if people are not protected when outside of the home, and an increase in mosquitoes that are resistant to insecticides. Modifications to people&#x27;s houses to prevent mosquito exposure may be an important long term prevention measure.

====Insecticide-treated nets====
Mosquito nets help keep mosquitoes away from people and reduce infection rates and transmission of malaria. Nets are not a perfect barrier and are often treated with an insecticide designed to kill the mosquito before it has time to find a way past the net. Insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) are estimated to be twice as effective as untreated nets and offer greater than 70% protection compared with no net. Between 2000 and 2008, the use of ITNs saved the lives of an estimated 250,000 infants in Sub-Saharan Africa. According to UNICEF, only 36% of households had sufficient ITNs for all household members in 2019. In 2000, 1.7 million (1.8%) African children living in areas of the world where malaria is common were protected by an ITN. That number increased to 20.3 million (18.5%) African children using ITNs in 2007, leaving 89.6 million children unprotected and to 68% African children using mosquito nets in 2015. The percentage of children sleeping under ITNs in sub-Saharan Africa increased from less than 40% in 2011 to over 50% in 2021. Most nets are impregnated with pyrethroids, a class of insecticides with low toxicity. They are most effective when used from dusk to dawn. It is recommended to hang a large &quot;bed net&quot; above the center of a bed and either tuck the edges under the mattress or make sure it is large enough such that it touches the ground. ITNs are beneficial towards pregnancy outcomes in malaria-endemic regions in Africa but more data is needed in Asia and Latin America.

In areas of high malaria resistance, piperonyl butoxide (PBO) combined with pyrethroids in mosquito netting is effective in reducing malaria infection rates. Questions remain concerning the durability of PBO on nets as the impact on mosquito mortality was not sustained after twenty washes in experimental trials.

UNICEF notes that the use of insecticide-treated nets has been increased since 2000 through accelerated production, procurement and delivery, stating that &quot;over 2.5 billion ITNs have been distributed globally since 2004, with 87% (2.2 billion) distributed in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2021, manufacturers delivered about 220 million ITNs to malaria endemic countries, a decrease of 9 million ITNs compared with 2020 and 33 million less than were delivered in 2019&quot;. As of 2021, 66% of households in sub-Saharan Africa had ITNs, with figures &quot;ranging from 31 per cent in Angola in 2016 to approximately 97 per cent in Guinea-Bissau in 2019&quot;. Slightly more than half of the households with an ITN had enough of them to protect all members of the household, however.

====Indoor residual spraying====
Indoor residual spraying is the spraying of insecticides on the walls inside a home. After feeding, many mosquitoes rest on a nearby surface while digesting the bloodmeal, so if the walls of houses have been coated with insecticides, the resting mosquitoes can be killed before they can bite another person and transfer the malaria parasite. As of 2006, the World Health Organization recommends 12 insecticides in IRS operations, including DDT and the pyrethroids cyfluthrin and deltamethrin. This public health use of small amounts of DDT is permitted under the Stockholm Convention, which prohibits its agricultural use. One problem with all forms of IRS is insecticide resistance. Mosquitoes affected by IRS tend to rest and live indoors, and due to the irritation caused by spraying, their descendants tend to rest and live outdoors, meaning that they are less affected by the IRS. Communities using insecticide treated nets, in addition to indoor residual spraying with &#x27;non-pyrethroid-like&#x27; insecticides found associated reductions in malaria. Additionally, the use of &#x27;pyrethroid-like&#x27; insecticides in addition to indoor residual spraying did not result in a detectable additional benefit in communities using insecticide treated nets.

==== Housing modifications ====
Housing is a risk factor for malaria and modifying the house as a prevention measure may be a sustainable strategy that does not rely on the effectiveness of insecticides such as pyrethroids. The physical environment inside and outside the home that may improve the density of mosquitoes are considerations. Examples of potential modifications include how close the home is to mosquito breeding sites, drainage and water supply near the home, availability of mosquito resting sites (vegetation around the home), the proximity to live stock and domestic animals, and physical improvements or modifications to the design of the home to prevent mosquitoes from entering, such as window screens.

In addition to installing window screens, house screening measures include screening ceilings, doors, and eaves. In 2021, the World Health Organization&#x27;s (WHO) Guideline Development Group conditionally recommended screening houses in this manner to reduce malaria transmission. However, the WHO does point out that there are local considerations that need to be addressed when incorporating these techniques. These considerations include the delivery method, maintenance, house design, feasibility, resource needs, and scalability.

Several studies have suggested that screening houses can have a significant impact on malaria transmission. Beyond the protective barrier screening provides, it also does not call for daily behavioral changes in the household. Screening eaves can also have a community-level protective effect, ultimately reducing mosquito-biting densities in neighboring houses that do not have this intervention in place.

In some cases, studies have used insecticide-treated (e.g., transfluthrin) or untreated netting to deter mosquito entry. One widely used intervention is the In2Care BV EaveTube. In 2021, In2Care BV received funding from the United States Agency for International Development to develop a ventilation tube that would be installed in housing walls. When mosquitoes approach households, the goal is for them to encounter these EaveTubes instead. Inside these EaveTubes is insecticide-treated netting that is lethal to insecticide-resistant mosquitoes. This approach to mosquito control is called the Lethal House Lure method. The WHO is currently evaluating the efficacy of this product for widespread use.

==== Mass drug administration ====
Mass drug administration (MDA) involves the administration of drugs to the entire population of an area regardless of disease status. A 2021 Cochrane review on the use of community administration of ivermectin found that, to date, low quality evidence shows no significant impact on reducing incidence of malaria transmission from the community administration of ivermectin.

==== Mosquito-targeted drug delivery ====

One potential way to reduce the burden of malaria is to target the infection in mosquitoes, before it enters the mammalian host (during sporogeny). Drugs may be used for this purpose which have unacceptable toxicity profiles in humans. For example, aminoquinoline derivates show toxicity in humans, but this has not been shown in mosquitoes. Primaquine is particularly effective against Plasmodium gametocytes. Likewise, pyrroloquinazolinediamines show unacceptable toxicity in mammals, but it is unknown whether this is the case in mosquitoes. Pyronaridine, thiostrepton, and pyrimethamine have been shown to dramatically reduce ookinete formation in &quot;P. berghei&quot;, while artefenomel, NPC-1161B, and tert-butyl isoquine reduce exflagellation in &quot;P. Falciparum&quot;. 

====Other mosquito control methods====
People have tried a number of other methods to reduce mosquito bites and slow the spread of malaria. Efforts to decrease mosquito larvae by decreasing the availability of open water where they develop, or by adding substances to decrease their development, are effective in some locations. Electronic mosquito repellent devices, which make very high-frequency sounds that are supposed to keep female mosquitoes away, have no supporting evidence of effectiveness. There is a low certainty evidence that fogging may have an effect on malaria transmission. Larviciding by hand delivery of chemical or microbial insecticides into water bodies containing low larval distribution may reduce malarial transmission. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether larvivorous fish can decrease mosquito density and transmission in the area.

===Medications===
There are a number of medications that can help prevent or interrupt malaria in travellers to places where infection is common. Many of these medications are also used in treatment. In places where &quot;Plasmodium&quot; is resistant to one or more medications, three medications—mefloquine, doxycycline, or the combination of atovaquone/proguanil (&quot;Malarone&quot;)—are frequently used for prevention. Doxycycline and the atovaquone/proguanil are better tolerated while mefloquine is taken once a week. Areas of the world with chloroquine-sensitive malaria are uncommon. Antimalarial mass drug administration to an entire population at the same time may reduce the risk of contracting malaria in the population, however the effectiveness of mass drug administration may vary depending on the prevalence of malaria in the area. Other factors such as drug administration plus other protective measures such as mosquito control, the proportion of people treated in the area, and the risk of reinfection with malaria may play a role in the effectiveness of mass drug treatment approaches.

The protective effect does not begin immediately, and people visiting areas where malaria exists usually start taking the drugs one to two weeks before they arrive, and continue taking them for four weeks after leaving (except for atovaquone/proguanil, which only needs to be started two days before and continued for seven days afterward). The use of preventive drugs is often not practical for those who live in areas where malaria exists, and their use is usually given only to pregnant women and short-term visitors. This is due to the cost of the drugs, side effects from long-term use, and the difficulty in obtaining antimalarial drugs outside of wealthy nations. During pregnancy, medication to prevent malaria has been found to improve the weight of the baby at birth and decrease the risk of anaemia in the mother. The use of preventive drugs where malaria-bearing mosquitoes are present may encourage the development of partial resistance.

Giving antimalarial drugs to infants through intermittent preventive therapy can reduce the risk of having malaria infection, hospital admission, and anaemia.

Mefloquine is more effective than sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in preventing malaria for HIV-negative pregnant women. Cotrimoxazole is effective in preventing malaria infection and reduce the risk of getting anaemia in HIV-positive women. Giving Dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine and mefloquine in addition to the daily cotrimoxazole to HIV-positive pregnant women seem to be more efficient in preventing malaria infection than cotrimoxazole alone.

Prompt treatment of confirmed cases with artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) may also reduce transmission.

=== Research on malaria vaccines ===
Malaria vaccines have been another goal of research. The first promising studies demonstrating the potential for a malaria vaccine were performed in 1967 by immunising mice with live, radiation-attenuated sporozoites, which provided significant protection to the mice upon subsequent injection with normal, viable sporozoites. Since the 1970s, there has been considerable progress in developing similar vaccination strategies for humans.

In 2013, WHO and the malaria vaccine funders group set a goal to develop vaccines designed to interrupt malaria transmission with malaria eradication&#x27;s long-term goal. The first vaccine, called RTS,S, was approved by European regulators in 2015. As of 2023, two malaria vaccines have been licensed for use. Other approaches to combat malaria may require investing more in research and greater primary health care. Continuing surveillance will also be important to prevent the return of malaria in countries where the disease has been eliminated.

As of 2019 it is undergoing pilot trials in 3 sub-Saharan African countries—Ghana, Kenya and Malawi—as part of the WHO&#x27;s Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme (MVIP).
Immunity (or, more accurately, tolerance) to &quot;P. falciparum&quot; malaria does occur naturally, but only in response to years of repeated infection. An individual can be protected from a &quot;P. falciparum&quot; infection if they receive about a thousand bites from mosquitoes that carry a version of the parasite rendered non-infective by a dose of X-ray irradiation. The highly polymorphic nature of many &quot;P. falciparum&quot; proteins results in significant challenges to vaccine design. Vaccine candidates that target antigens on gametes, zygotes, or ookinetes in the mosquito midgut aim to block the transmission of malaria. These transmission-blocking vaccines induce antibodies in the human blood; when a mosquito takes a blood meal from a protected individual, these antibodies prevent the parasite from completing its development in the mosquito. Other vaccine candidates, targeting the blood-stage of the parasite&#x27;s life cycle, have been inadequate on their own. For example, SPf66 was tested extensively in areas where the disease was common in the 1990s, but trials showed it to be insufficiently effective.

As of 2020, the RTS,S vaccine has been shown to reduce the risk of malaria by about 40% in children in Africa. A preprint study of the R21 vaccine has shown 77% vaccine efficacy.

In 2021, researchers from the University of Oxford reported findings from a Phase IIb trial of a candidate malaria vaccine, R21/Matrix-M, which demonstrated efficacy of 77% over 12-months of follow-up. This vaccine is the first to meet the World Health Organization&#x27;s Malaria Vaccine Technology Roadmap goal of a vaccine with at least 75% efficacy.

Germany-based BioNTECH SE is developing an mRNA-based malaria vaccine BN165 which has recently initiated a Phase 1 study [clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT05581641] in December 2022. The vaccine, based on the circumsporozite protein (CSP) is being tested in adults aged 18–55 yrs at 3 dose levels to select a safe and tolerable dose of a three-dose schedule. Unlike GSK&#x27;s RTS,S (AS01) and Serum Institute of India&#x27;s R21/MatrixM, BNT-165 is being studied in adult age groups meaning it could be developed for Western travelers as well as those living in endemic countries. For the travelers profile, a recent commercial assessment forecast potential gross revenues of BNT-165 at $479m (2030) 5-yrs post launch, POS-adjusted revenues.

===Others===
Community participation and health education strategies promoting awareness of malaria and the importance of control measures have been successfully used to reduce the incidence of malaria in some areas of the developing world. Recognising the disease in the early stages can prevent it from becoming fatal. Education can also inform people to cover over areas of stagnant, still water, such as water tanks that are ideal breeding grounds for the parasite and mosquito, thus cutting down the risk of the transmission between people. This is generally used in urban areas where there are large centers of population in a confined space and transmission would be most likely in these areas. Intermittent preventive therapy is another intervention that has been used successfully to control malaria in pregnant women and infants, and in preschool children where transmission is seasonal.

==Treatment==
Malaria is treated with antimalarial medications; the ones used depend on the type and severity of the disease. While medications against fever are commonly used, their effects on outcomes are not clear. Providing free antimalarial drugs to households may reduce childhood deaths when used appropriately. Programmes which presumptively treat all causes of fever with antimalarial drugs may lead to overuse of antimalarials and undertreat other causes of fever. Nevertheless, the use of malaria rapid-diagnostic kits can help to reduce over-usage of antimalarials.
===Uncomplicated malaria===
Simple or uncomplicated malaria may be treated with oral medications. Artemisinin drugs are effective and safe in treating uncomplicated malaria. Artemisinin in combination with other antimalarials (known as artemisinin-combination therapy, or ACT) is about 90% effective when used to treat uncomplicated malaria. The most effective treatment for &quot;P. falciparum&quot; infection is the use of ACT, which decreases resistance to any single drug component. Artemether-lumefantrine (six-dose regimen) is more effective than the artemether-lumefantrine (four-dose regimen) or other regimens not containing artemisinin derivatives in treating falciparum malaria. Another recommended combination is dihydroartemisinin and piperaquine. Artemisinin-naphthoquine combination therapy showed promising results in treating falciparum malaria but more research is needed to establish its efficacy as a reliable treatment. Artesunate plus mefloquine performs better than mefloquine alone in treating uncomplicated falciparum malaria in low transmission settings. Atovaquone-proguanil is effective against uncomplicated falciparum with a possible failure rate of 5% to 10%; the addition of artesunate may reduce failure rate. Azithromycin monotherapy or combination therapy has not shown effectiveness in treating &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot; or &quot;Plasmodium vivax&quot; malaria. Amodiaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine may achieve less treatment failures when compared to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine alone in uncomplicated falciparum malaria. There is insufficient data on chlorproguanil-dapsone in treating uncomplicated falciparum malaria. The addition of primaquine with artemisinin-based combination therapy for falciparum malaria reduces its transmission at day 3-4 and day 8 of infection. Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus artesunate is better than sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine in controlling treatment failure at day 28. However, the latter is better than the former in reducing gametocytes in blood at day 7.

Infection with &quot;P. vivax&quot;, &quot;P. ovale&quot; or &quot;P. malariae&quot; usually does not require hospitalisation. Treatment of &quot;P. vivax&quot; malaria requires both elimination of the parasite in the blood with chloroquine or with artemisinin-based combination therapy and clearance of parasites from the liver with an 8-aminoquinoline agent such as primaquine or tafenoquine. These two drugs act against blood stages as well, the extent to which they do so still being under investigation.

To treat malaria during pregnancy, the WHO recommends the use of quinine plus clindamycin early in the pregnancy (1st trimester), and ACT in later stages (2nd and 3rd trimesters). There is limited safety data on the antimalarial drugs in pregnancy.

===Severe and complicated malaria===
Cases of severe and complicated malaria are almost always caused by infection with &quot;P. falciparum&quot;. The other species usually cause only febrile disease. Severe and complicated malaria cases are medical emergencies since mortality rates are high (10% to 50%).

Recommended treatment for severe malaria is the intravenous use of antimalarial drugs. For severe malaria, parenteral artesunate was superior to quinine in both children and adults. In another systematic review, artemisinin derivatives (artemether and arteether) were as efficacious as quinine in the treatment of cerebral malaria in children. Treatment of severe malaria involves supportive measures that are best done in a critical care unit. This includes the management of high fevers and the seizures that may result from it. It also includes monitoring for poor breathing effort, low blood sugar, and low blood potassium. Artemisinin derivatives have the same or better efficacy than quinolones in preventing deaths in severe or complicated malaria. Quinine loading dose helps to shorten the duration of fever and increases parasite clearance from the body. There is no difference in effectiveness when using intrarectal quinine compared to intravenous or intramuscular quinine in treating uncomplicated/complicated falciparum malaria. There is insufficient evidence for intramuscular arteether to treat severe malaria. The provision of rectal artesunate before transfer to hospital may reduce the rate of death for children with severe malaria. In children with malaria and concomitant hypoglycaemia, sublingual administration of glucose appears to result in better increases in blood sugar after 20 minutes when compared to oral administration, based on very limited data.

Cerebral malaria is the form of severe and complicated malaria with the worst neurological symptoms. There is insufficient data on whether osmotic agents such as mannitol or urea are effective in treating cerebral malaria. Routine phenobarbitone in cerebral malaria is associated with fewer convulsions but possibly more deaths. There is no evidence that steroids would bring treatment benefits for cerebral malaria.

Managing cerebral malaria
Cerebral malaria usually makes a patient comatose. If the cause of the coma is in doubt, testing for other locally prevalent causes of encephalopathy (bacterial, viral or fungal infection) should be carried out. In areas where there is a high prevalence of malaria infection (e.g. tropical region) treatment can start without testing first. To manage the cerebral malaria when confirmed the following can be done:

* People who are in coma should be given meticulous nursing care ( monitor vital signs, turn patient every 2 hours, avoid lying the patient in a wet bed etc.)
* A sterile urethral catheter should be inserted to help with urinating
* To aspirate stomach content, a sterile nasogastric tube should be inserted.
* In the occasion of convulsions, a slow intravenous injection of benzodiazepine is administered.

There is insufficient evidence to show that blood transfusion is useful in either reducing deaths for children with severe anaemia or in improving their haematocrit in one month. There is insufficient evidence that iron chelating agents such as deferoxamine and deferiprone improve outcomes of those with malaria falciparum infection.

===Monoclonal antibodies===
A 2022 clinical trial shows that a monoclonal antibody mAb L9LS offers protection against malaria. It binds the &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot; circumsporozoite protein (CSP-1), essential to disease, and makes it ineffective.

===Resistance===
Drug resistance poses a growing problem in 21st-century malaria treatment. In the 2000s (decade), malaria with partial resistance to artemisins emerged in Southeast Asia. Resistance is now common against all classes of antimalarial drugs apart from artemisinins. Treatment of resistant strains became increasingly dependent on this class of drugs. The cost of artemisinins limits their use in the developing world. Malaria strains found on the Cambodia–Thailand border are resistant to combination therapies that include artemisinins, and may, therefore, be untreatable. Exposure of the parasite population to artemisinin monotherapies in subtherapeutic doses for over 30 years and the availability of substandard artemisinins likely drove the selection of the resistant phenotype. Resistance to artemisinin has been detected in Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam, and there has been emerging resistance in Laos. Resistance to the combination of artemisinin and piperaquine was first detected in 2013 in Cambodia, and by 2019 had spread across Cambodia and into Laos, Thailand and Vietnam (with up to 80 percent of malaria parasites resistant in some regions).

There is insufficient evidence in unit packaged antimalarial drugs in preventing treatment failures of malaria infection. However, if supported by training of healthcare providers and patient information, there is improvement in compliance of those receiving treatment.

==Prognosis==
When properly treated, people with malaria can usually expect a complete recovery. However, severe malaria can progress extremely rapidly and cause death within hours or days. In the most severe cases of the disease, fatality rates can reach 20%, even with intensive care and treatment. Over the longer term, developmental impairments have been documented in children who have had episodes of severe malaria. Chronic infection without severe disease can occur in an immune-deficiency syndrome associated with a decreased responsiveness to &quot;Salmonella&quot; bacteria and the Epstein–Barr virus.

During childhood, malaria causes anaemia during a period of rapid brain development, and also direct brain damage resulting from cerebral malaria. Some survivors of cerebral malaria have an increased risk of neurological and cognitive deficits, behavioural disorders, and epilepsy. Malaria prophylaxis was shown to improve cognitive function and school performance in clinical trials when compared to placebo groups.

==Epidemiology==


The WHO estimates that in 2021 there were 247 million total cases of malaria resulting in 619,000 deaths. Children under five years old are the most affected, accounting for 67% of malaria deaths worldwide in 2019. About 125 million pregnant women are at risk of infection each year; in Sub-Saharan Africa, maternal malaria is associated with up to 200,000 estimated infant deaths yearly. Since 2015, the WHO European Region has been free of malaria. The last country to report an indigenous malaria case was Tajikistan in 2014. There are about 1300–1500 malaria cases per year in the United States. The United States eradicated malaria as a major public health concern in 1951, though small outbreaks persist. Locally acquired mosquito-borne malaria occurred in the United States in 2003, when eight cases of locally acquired &quot;P. vivax&quot; malaria were identified in Florida, and again in May 2023, in four cases, as well as one case in Texas, and in August in one case in Maryland. About 900 people died from the disease in Europe between 1993 and 2003. Both the global incidence of disease and resulting mortality have declined in recent years. According to the WHO and UNICEF, deaths attributable to malaria in 2015 were reduced by 60% from a 2000 estimate of 985,000, largely due to the widespread use of insecticide-treated nets and artemisinin-based combination therapies. Between 2000 and 2019, malaria mortality rates among all ages halved from about 30 to 13 per 100,000 population at risk. During this period, malaria deaths among children under five also declined by nearly half (47%) from 781,000 in 2000 to 416,000 in 2019.

Malaria is presently endemic in a broad band around the equator, in areas of the Americas, many parts of Asia, and much of Africa; in Sub-Saharan Africa, 85–90% of malaria fatalities occur. An estimate for 2009 reported that countries with the highest death rate per 100,000 of population were Ivory Coast (86.15), Angola (56.93) and Burkina Faso (50.66). A 2010 estimate indicated the deadliest countries per population were Burkina Faso, Mozambique and Mali. The Malaria Atlas Project aims to map global levels of malaria, providing a way to determine the global spatial limits of the disease and to assess disease burden. This effort led to the publication of a map of &quot;P. falciparum&quot; endemicity in 2010 and an update in 2019. As of 2021, 84 countries have endemic malaria.

The geographic distribution of malaria within large regions is complex, and malaria-afflicted and malaria-free areas are often found close to each other. Malaria is prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions because of rainfall, consistent high temperatures and high humidity, along with stagnant waters where mosquito larvae readily mature, providing them with the environment they need for continuous breeding. In drier areas, outbreaks of malaria have been predicted with reasonable accuracy by mapping rainfall. Malaria is more common in rural areas than in cities. For example, several cities in the Greater Mekong Subregion of Southeast Asia are essentially malaria-free, but the disease is prevalent in many rural regions, including along international borders and forest fringes. In contrast, malaria in Africa is present in both rural and urban areas, though the risk is lower in the larger cities.

===Climate change===
Climate change is likely to affect malaria transmission, but the degree of effect and the areas affected is uncertain. Greater rainfall in certain areas of India, and following an El Niño event is associated with increased mosquito numbers.

Since 1900 there has been substantial change in temperature and rainfall over Africa. However, factors that contribute to how rainfall results in water for mosquito breeding are complex, incorporating the extent to which it is absorbed into soil and vegetation for example, or rates of runoff and evaporation. Recent research has provided a more in-depth picture of conditions across Africa, combining a malaria climatic suitability model with a continental-scale model representing real-world hydrological processes.

==History==
Although the parasite responsible for &quot;P. falciparum&quot; malaria has been in existence for 50,000–100,000 years, the population size of the parasite did not increase until about 10,000 years ago, concurrently with advances in agriculture and the development of human settlements. Close relatives of the human malaria parasites remain common in chimpanzees. Some evidence suggests that the &quot;P. falciparum&quot; malaria may have originated in gorillas.

References to the unique periodic fevers of malaria are found throughout history. Ancient Indian physician Sushruta believed that the disease is caused due to biting insects, long before the Roman Columella associated the disease with insects from swamps. Hippocrates described periodic fevers, labelling them tertian, quartan, subtertian and quotidian. Malaria may have contributed to the decline of the Roman Empire, and was so pervasive in Rome that it was known as the &quot;Roman fever&quot;. Several regions in ancient Rome were considered at-risk for the disease because of the favourable conditions present for malaria vectors. This included areas such as southern Italy, the island of Sardinia, the Pontine Marshes, the lower regions of coastal Etruria and the city of Rome along the Tiber. The presence of stagnant water in these places was preferred by mosquitoes for breeding grounds. Irrigated gardens, swamp-like grounds, run-off from agriculture, and drainage problems from road construction led to the increase of standing water.

Malaria is not referenced in the medical books of the Mayans or Aztecs. Despite this, antibodies against malaria have been detected in some South American mummies, indicating that some malaria strains in the Americas might have a pre-Columbian origin. European settlers and the West Africans they enslaved likely brought malaria to the Americas starting in the 16th century.

Scientific studies on malaria made their first significant advance in 1880, when Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran—a French army doctor working in the military hospital of Constantine in Algeria—observed parasites inside the red blood cells of infected people for the first time. He, therefore, proposed that malaria is caused by this organism, the first time a protist was identified as causing disease. For this and later discoveries, he was awarded the 1907 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. A year later, Carlos Finlay, a Cuban doctor treating people with yellow fever in Havana, provided strong evidence that mosquitoes were transmitting disease to and from humans. This work followed earlier suggestions by Josiah C. Nott, and work by Sir Patrick Manson, the &quot;father of tropical medicine&quot;, on the transmission of filariasis.

In April 1894, a Scottish physician, Sir Ronald Ross, visited Sir Patrick Manson at his house on Queen Anne Street, London. This visit was the start of four years of collaboration and fervent research that culminated in 1897 when Ross, who was working in the Presidency General Hospital in Calcutta, proved the complete life-cycle of the malaria parasite in mosquitoes. He thus proved that the mosquito was the vector for malaria in humans by showing that certain mosquito species transmit malaria to birds. He isolated malaria parasites from the salivary glands of mosquitoes that had fed on infected birds. For this work, Ross received the 1902 Nobel Prize in Medicine. After resigning from the Indian Medical Service, Ross worked at the newly established Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and directed malaria-control efforts in Egypt, Panama, Greece and Mauritius. The findings of Finlay and Ross were later confirmed by a medical board headed by Walter Reed in 1900. Its recommendations were implemented by William C. Gorgas in the health measures undertaken during construction of the Panama Canal. This public-health work saved the lives of thousands of workers and helped develop the methods used in future public-health campaigns against the disease.

In 1896, Amico Bignami discussed the role of mosquitoes in malaria. In 1898, Bignami, Giovanni Battista Grassi and Giuseppe Bastianelli succeeded in showing experimentally the transmission of malaria in humans, using infected mosquitoes to contract malaria themselves which they presented in November 1898 to the Accademia dei Lincei.

The first effective treatment for malaria came from the bark of cinchona tree, which contains quinine. This tree grows on the slopes of the Andes, mainly in Peru. The indigenous peoples of Peru made a tincture of cinchona to control fever. Its effectiveness against malaria was found and the Jesuits introduced the treatment to Europe around 1640; by 1677, it was included in the London Pharmacopoeia as an antimalarial treatment. It was not until 1820 that the active ingredient, quinine, was extracted from the bark, isolated and named by the French chemists Pierre Joseph Pelletier and Joseph Bienaimé Caventou.

Quinine was the predominant malarial medication until the 1920s when other medications began to appear. In the 1940s, chloroquine replaced quinine as the treatment of both uncomplicated and severe malaria until resistance supervened, first in Southeast Asia and South America in the 1950s and then globally in the 1980s.

The medicinal value of &quot;Artemisia annua&quot; has been used by Chinese herbalists in traditional Chinese medicines for 2,000 years. In 1596, Li Shizhen recommended tea made from qinghao specifically to treat malaria symptoms in his &quot;Compendium of Materia Medica&quot;, however the efficacy of tea, made with &quot;A. annua&quot;, for the treatment of malaria is dubious, and is discouraged by the World Health Organization (WHO). Artemisinins, discovered by Chinese scientist Tu Youyou and colleagues in the 1970s from the plant &quot;Artemisia annua&quot;, became the recommended treatment for &quot;P. falciparum&quot; malaria, administered in severe cases in combination with other antimalarials. Tu says she was influenced by a traditional Chinese herbal medicine source, &quot;The Handbook of Prescriptions for Emergency Treatments&quot;, written in 340 by Ge Hong. For her work on malaria, Tu Youyou received the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

&quot;Plasmodium vivax&quot; was used between 1917 and the 1940s for malariotherapy—deliberate injection of malaria parasites to induce a fever to combat certain diseases such as tertiary syphilis. In 1927, the inventor of this technique, Julius Wagner-Jauregg, received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discoveries. The technique was dangerous, killing about 15% of patients, so it is no longer in use.

The first pesticide used for indoor residual spraying was DDT. Although it was initially used exclusively to combat malaria, its use quickly spread to agriculture. In time, pest control, rather than disease control, came to dominate DDT use, and this large-scale agricultural use led to the evolution of pesticide-resistant mosquitoes in many regions. The DDT resistance shown by &quot;Anopheles&quot; mosquitoes can be compared to antibiotic resistance shown by bacteria. During the 1960s, awareness of the negative consequences of its indiscriminate use increased, ultimately leading to bans on agricultural applications of DDT in many countries in the 1970s. Before DDT, malaria was successfully eliminated or controlled in tropical areas like Brazil and Egypt by removing or poisoning the breeding grounds of the mosquitoes or the aquatic habitats of the larval stages, for example by applying the highly toxic arsenic compound Paris Green to places with standing water.

===Names===
Various types of malaria have been called by the names below:

==Eradication efforts==
Malaria has been successfully eliminated or significantly reduced in certain areas, but not globally. Malaria was once common in the United States, but the US eliminated malaria from most parts of the country in the early 20th century using vector control programs, which combined the monitoring and treatment of infected humans, draining of wetland breeding grounds for agriculture and other changes in water management practices, and advances in sanitation, including greater use of glass windows and screens in dwellings. The use of the pesticide DDT and other means eliminated malaria from the remaining pockets in southern states of the US in the 1950s, as part of the National Malaria Eradication Program. Most of Europe, North America, Australia, North Africa and the Caribbean, and parts of South America, Asia and Southern Africa have also eliminated malaria. The WHO defines &quot;elimination&quot; (or &quot;malaria-free&quot;) as having no domestic transmission (indigenous cases) for the past three years. They also define &quot;pre-elimination&quot; and &quot;elimination&quot; stages when a country has fewer than 5 or 1, respectively, cases per 1000 people at risk per year. In 2021, the total of international and national funding for malaria control and elimination was $3.5 billion—only half of what is estimated to be needed. According to UNICEF, to achieve the goal of a malaria-free world, annual funding would need to more than double to reach the US$6.8 billion target.

In parts of the world with rising living standards, the elimination of malaria was often a collateral benefit of the introduction of window screens and improved sanitation. A variety of usually simultaneous interventions represents best practice. These include antimalarial drugs to prevent or treat infection; improvements in public health infrastructure to diagnose, sequester and treat infected individuals; bednets and other methods intended to keep mosquitoes from biting humans; and vector control strategies such as larvaciding with insecticides, ecological controls such as draining mosquito breeding grounds or introducing fish to eat larvae and indoor residual spraying (IRS) with insecticides.

===Initial WHO program (1955–1969)===
In 1955 the WHO launched the Global Malaria Eradication Program (GMEP). The program relied largely on DDT for mosquito control and rapid diagnosis and treatment to break the transmission cycle. The program eliminated the disease in &quot;North America, Europe, the former Soviet Union&quot;, and in &quot;Taiwan, much of the Caribbean, the Balkans, parts of northern Africa, the northern region of Australia, and a large swath of the South Pacific&quot; and dramatically reduced mortality in Sri Lanka and India.

However, failure to sustain the program, increasing mosquito tolerance to DDT, and increasing parasite tolerance led to a resurgence. In many areas early successes partially or completely reversed, and in some cases rates of transmission increased. Experts tie malarial resurgence to multiple factors, including poor leadership, management and funding of malaria control programs; poverty; civil unrest; and increased irrigation. The evolution of resistance to first-generation drugs (e.g. chloroquine) and to insecticides exacerbated the situation. The program succeeded in eliminating malaria only in areas with &quot;high socio-economic status, well-organized healthcare systems, and relatively less intensive or seasonal malaria transmission&quot;.

For example, in Sri Lanka, the program reduced cases from about one million per year before spraying to just 18 in 1963 and 29 in 1964. Thereafter the program was halted to save money and malaria rebounded to 600,000 cases in 1968 and the first quarter of 1969. The country resumed DDT vector control but the mosquitoes had evolved resistance in the interim, presumably because of continued agricultural use. The program switched to malathion, but despite initial successes, malaria continued its resurgence into the 1980s.

Due to vector and parasite resistance and other factors, the feasibility of eradicating malaria with the strategy used at the time and resources available led to waning support for the program. WHO suspended the program in 1969 and attention instead focused on controlling and treating the disease. Spraying programs (especially using DDT) were curtailed due to concerns over safety and environmental effects, as well as problems in administrative, managerial and financial implementation. Efforts shifted from spraying to the use of bednets impregnated with insecticides and other interventions.

===After 1969===
Target 6C of the Millennium Development Goals included reversal of the global increase in malaria incidence by 2015, with specific targets for children under five years old. Since 2000, support for malaria eradication increased, although some actors in the global health community (including voices within the WHO) view malaria eradication as a premature goal and suggest that the establishment of strict deadlines for malaria eradication may be counterproductive as they are likely to be missed. One of the targets of Goal 3 of the UN&#x27;s Sustainable Development Goals is to end the malaria epidemic in all countries by 2030.

In 2006, the organization Malaria No More set a public goal of eliminating malaria from Africa by 2015, and the organization claimed they planned to dissolve if that goal was accomplished. In 2007, World Malaria Day was established by the 60th session of the World Health Assembly. As of 2018, they are still functioning. 
, The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria has distributed 230 million insecticide-treated nets intended to stop mosquito-borne transmission of malaria. The U.S.-based Clinton Foundation has worked to manage demand and stabilize prices in the artemisinin market. Other efforts, such as the Malaria Atlas Project, focus on analysing climate and weather information required to accurately predict malaria spread based on the availability of habitat of malaria-carrying parasites. The Malaria Policy Advisory Committee (MPAC) of the World Health Organization (WHO) was formed in 2012, &quot;to provide strategic advice and technical input to WHO on all aspects of malaria control and elimination&quot;.

In 2015 the WHO targeted a 90% reduction in malaria deaths by 2030, and Bill Gates said in 2016 that he thought global eradication would be possible by 2040. According to the WHO&#x27;s World Malaria Report 2015, the global mortality rate for malaria fell by 60% between 2000 and 2015. The WHO targeted a further 90% reduction between 2015 and 2030, with a 40% reduction and eradication in 10 countries by 2020. However, the 2020 goal was missed with a slight increase in cases compared to 2015. Additionally, UNICEF reported that the number of malaria deaths for all ages increased by 10% between 2019 and 2020, in part due to service disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, before experiencing a minor decline in 2021.

Before 2016, the Global Fund against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria had provided 659 million ITN (insecticide treated bed nets), organise support and education to prevents malaria. The challenges are high due to the lack of funds, the fragile health structure and the remote indigenous population that could be hard to reach and educate. Most of indigenous population rely on self-diagnosis, self-treatment, healer, and traditional medicine. The WHO applied for fund to the Gates Foundation which favour the action of malaria eradication in 2007. Six countries, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, Armenia, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Sri Lanka managed to have no endemic cases of malaria for three consecutive years and certified malaria-free by the WHO despite the stagnation of the funding in 2010. The funding is essential to finance the cost of medication and hospitalisation cannot be supported by the poor countries where the disease is widely spread. The goal of eradication has not been met; nevertheless, the decrease rate of the disease is considerable.

While 31 out of 92 endemic countries were estimated to be on track with the WHO goals for 2020, 15 countries reported an increase of 40% or more between 2015 and 2020. Between 2000 and 30 June 2021, twelve countries were certified by the WHO as being malaria-free. Argentina and Algeria were declared free of malaria in 2019. El Salvador and China were declared malaria-free in the first half of 2021.

Regional disparities were evident: Southeast Asia was on track to meet WHO&#x27;s 2020 goals, while Africa, Americas, Eastern Mediterranean and West Pacific regions were off-track. The six Greater Mekong Subregion countries aim for elimination of &quot;P. falciparum&quot; transmitted malaria by 2025 and elimination of all malaria by 2030, having achieved a 97% and 90% reduction of cases respectively since 2000. Ahead of World Malaria Day, 25 April 2021, WHO named 25 countries in which it is working to eliminate malaria by 2025 as part of its E-2025 initiative.

A major challenge to malaria elimination is the persistence of malaria in border regions, making international cooperation crucial.

In 2018, WHO announced that Paraguay was free of malaria, after a national malaria eradication effort that began in 1950.

In March 2023, the WHO certified Azerbaijan and Tajikistan as malaria-free, and Belize in June 2023. Cabo Verde, the latest country to eradicate Malaria, was certified in January 2024, bringing the total number of countries and territories certified malaria-free to 44. In October 2024, the WHO certified Egypt to be malaria-free.

===Potential eradication of malaria by year 2050===
Experts say that malaria could be eliminated as wild disease of humans by the year 2050. World class experts (41 of them) in fields such as malariology, biomedicine, economics and health policy advocated more funding, a central data repository for dealing with local outbreaks of malaria, and training the workers needed to carry out the plan. Details are published in &quot;The Lancet&quot;. The report refers to current knowledge, recent research and financial matters to describe a respectable plan. 
The number of countries in which malaria was endemic was reduced from 200 to 86 in the years from 1900 to 2017. A further reduction by another 20 countries occurred by 2020. In light of the indication of possible practical accomplishment, countries and regions are planning further progress. Through the use of optimal diagnostic techniques, effective treatment and vector reduction the world should be nearly free of malaria by 2050. This will require technical improvements in organizational efficiency and more money.

==Society and culture==
=== Economic impact ===
Malaria is not just a disease commonly associated with poverty; some evidence suggests that it is also a cause of poverty and a major hindrance to economic development. Although tropical regions are most affected, malaria&#x27;s furthest influence reaches into some temperate zones that have extreme seasonal changes. The disease has been associated with major negative economic effects on regions where it is widespread. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it was a major factor in the slow economic development of the American southern states.

A comparison of average per capita GDP in 1995, adjusted for parity of purchasing power, between countries with malaria and countries without malaria gives a fivefold difference (US$1,526 versus US$8,268). In the period 1965 to 1990, countries where malaria was common had an average per capita GDP that increased only 0.4% per year, compared to 2.4% per year in other countries.

Poverty can increase the risk of malaria since those in poverty do not have the financial capacities to prevent or treat the disease. In its entirety, the economic impact of malaria has been estimated to cost Africa US$12 billion every year. The economic impact includes costs of health care, working days lost due to sickness, days lost in education, decreased productivity due to brain damage from cerebral malaria, and loss of investment and tourism. The disease has a heavy burden in some countries, where it may be responsible for 30–50% of hospital admissions, up to 50% of outpatient visits, and up to 40% of public health spending.

Cerebral malaria is one of the leading causes of neurological disabilities in African children. Studies comparing cognitive functions before and after treatment for severe malarial illness continued to show significantly impaired school performance and cognitive abilities even after recovery. Consequently, severe and cerebral malaria have far-reaching socioeconomic consequences that extend beyond the immediate effects of the disease.

===Counterfeit and substandard drugs===
Sophisticated counterfeits have been found in several Asian countries such as Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam, and are a major cause of avoidable death in those countries. The WHO said that studies indicate that up to 40% of artesunate-based malaria medications are counterfeit, especially in the Greater Mekong region. They have established a rapid alert system to rapidly report information about counterfeit drugs to relevant authorities in participating countries. There is no reliable way for doctors or lay people to detect counterfeit drugs without help from a laboratory. Companies are attempting to combat the persistence of counterfeit drugs by using new technology to provide security from source to distribution.

Another clinical and public health concern is the proliferation of substandard antimalarial medicines resulting from inappropriate concentration of ingredients, contamination with other drugs or toxic impurities, poor quality ingredients, poor stability and inadequate packaging. A 2012 study demonstrated that roughly one-third of antimalarial medications in Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa failed chemical analysis, packaging analysis, or were falsified.

===War===

Throughout history, the contraction of malaria has played a prominent role in the fates of government rulers, nation-states, military personnel, and military actions. In 1910, Nobel Prize in Medicine-winner Sir Ronald Ross (himself a malaria survivor), published a book titled &quot;The Prevention of Malaria&quot; that included a chapter titled &quot;The Prevention of Malaria in War&quot;. The chapter&#x27;s author, Colonel C. H. Melville, Professor of Hygiene at Royal Army Medical College in London, addressed the prominent role that malaria has historically played during wars: &quot;The history of malaria in war might almost be taken to be the history of war itself, certainly the history of war in the Christian era. ... It is probably the case that many of the so-called camp fevers, and probably also a considerable proportion of the camp dysentery, of the wars of the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were malarial in origin.&quot; In British-occupied India the cocktail gin and tonic may have come about as a way of taking quinine, known for its antimalarial properties.

The Scottish attempt to build a canal near what is now the Panamanian one was largely defeated by malaria. Starting with the establishment of &quot;New Caledonia&quot;, The Darièn Gap Project drained the kingdom — not yet part of the United Kingdom — of most of its wealth. The cost of the bail-out from London was the independence of Scotland. 

Malaria was the most significant health hazard encountered by U.S. troops in the South Pacific during World War II, where about 500,000 men were infected. According to Joseph Patrick Byrne, &quot;Sixty thousand American soldiers died of malaria during the African and South Pacific campaigns.&quot;

Significant financial investments have been made to procure existing and create new antimalarial agents. During World War I and World War II, inconsistent supplies of the natural antimalaria drugs cinchona bark and quinine prompted substantial funding into research and development of other drugs and vaccines. American military organisations conducting such research initiatives include the Navy Medical Research Center, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, and the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases of the US Armed Forces.

Additionally, initiatives have been founded such as Malaria Control in War Areas (MCWA), established in 1942, and its successor, the Communicable Disease Center (now known as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC) established in 1946. According to the CDC, MCWA &quot;was established to control malaria around military training bases in the southern United States and its territories, where malaria was still problematic&quot;.

==Research==
The Malaria Eradication Research Agenda (malERA) initiative was a consultative process to identify which areas of research and development (R&amp;D) must be addressed for worldwide eradication of malaria.

===Medications===
Malaria parasites contain apicoplasts, organelles related to the plastids found in plants, complete with their own genomes. These apicoplasts are thought to have originated through the endosymbiosis of algae and play a crucial role in various aspects of parasite metabolism, such as fatty acid biosynthesis. Over 400 proteins have been found to be produced by apicoplasts and these are now being investigated as possible targets for novel antimalarial drugs.

With the onset of drug-resistant &quot;Plasmodium&quot; parasites, new strategies are being developed to combat the widespread disease. One such approach lies in the introduction of synthetic pyridoxal-amino acid adducts, which are taken up by the parasite and ultimately interfere with its ability to create several essential B vitamins. Antimalarial drugs using synthetic metal-based complexes are attracting research interest.
* (+)-SJ733: Part of a wider class of experimental drugs called spiroindolone. It inhibits the ATP4 protein of infected red blood cells that cause the cells to shrink and become rigid like the aging cells. This triggers the immune system to eliminate the infected cells from the system as demonstrated in a mouse model. As of 2014, a Phase 1 clinical trial to assess the safety profile in human is planned by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.
* NITD246 and NITD609: Also belonged to the class of spiroindolone and target the ATP4 protein.

On the basis of molecular docking outcomes, compounds 3j, 4b, 4h, 4m were exhibited selectivity towards PfLDH. The post docking analysis displayed stable dynamic behavior of all the selected compounds compared to Chloroquine. The end state thermodynamics analysis stated 3j compound as a selective and potent PfLDH inhibitor.

===New targets===
Targeting &quot;Plasmodium&quot; liver-stage parasites selectively is emerging as an alternative strategy in the face of resistance to the latest frontline combination therapies against blood stages of the parasite.

In research conducted in 2019, using experimental analysis with knockout (KO) mutants of &quot;Plasmodium berghei&quot;, the authors were able to identify genes that are potentially essential in the liver stage. Moreover, they generated a computational model to analyse pre–erytrocytic development and liver–stage metabolism. Combining both methods they identified seven metabolic subsystems that become essential compared to the blood stage. Some of these metabolic pathways are fatty acid synthesis and elongation, tricarboxylic acid, amino acid and heme metabolism among others.

Specifically, they studied three subsystems: fatty acid synthesis and elongation, and amino sugar biosynthesis. For the first two pathways they demonstrated a clear dependence of the liver stage on its own fatty acid metabolism.

They proved for the first time the critical role of amino sugar biosynthesis in the liver stage of &quot;P. berghei&quot;. The uptake of N–acetyl–glucosamine appears to be limited in the liver stage, being its synthesis needed for the parasite development.

These findings and the computational model provide a basis for the design of antimalarial therapies targeting metabolic proteins.
===Genomic research===
The genome of &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot; was sequenced and published in the year 2002.

A species of malaria plasmodium tends to have rather polymorphic antigens which can serve as immune system targets. Some searches of P. falciparum genes for hotspots of encoded variations found sections of genes that when tested proved to encode for antigens. When such antigens are used for vaccine targets a strain of plasmodium with a different allele for the antigen can sometimes escape the immune response stimulated by the vaccine.
Two related viruses, MaRNAV-1 and MaRNAV-2 in Plasmodium vivax and in avian Leucocytozoon respectively, were found through RNA-Sequencing of blood. The finding of a virus infecting a human malaria plasmodium is a first discovery of its kind. It should lead to better understanding of malaria biology.

===Other===
A non-chemical vector control strategy involves genetic manipulation of malaria mosquitoes. Advances in genetic engineering technologies make it possible to introduce foreign DNA into the mosquito genome and either decrease the lifespan of the mosquito, or make it more resistant to the malaria parasite. Sterile insect technique is a genetic control method whereby large numbers of sterile male mosquitoes are reared and released. Mating with wild females reduces the wild population in the subsequent generation; repeated releases eventually eliminate the target population.

Genomics is central to malaria research. With the sequencing of &quot;P. falciparum&quot;, one of its vectors &quot;Anopheles gambiae&quot;, and the human genome, the genetics of all three organisms in the malaria life cycle can be studied. Another new application of genetic technology is the ability to produce genetically modified mosquitoes that do not transmit malaria, potentially allowing biological control of malaria transmission.

In one study, a genetically modified strain of &quot;Anopheles stephensi&quot; was created that no longer supported malaria transmission, and this resistance was passed down to mosquito offspring.

Gene drive is a technique for changing wild populations, for instance to combat or eliminate insects so they cannot transmit diseases (in particular mosquitoes in the cases of malaria, zika, dengue and yellow fever).

In a study conducted in 2015, researchers observed a specific interaction between malaria and co-infection with the nematode Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, a pulmonary migrating helminth, in mice. The co-infection was found to reduce the virulence of the &quot;Plasmodium&quot; parasite, the causative agent of malaria. This reduction was attributed to the nematode infection causing increased destruction of erythrocytes, or red blood cells. Given that &quot;Plasmodium&quot; has a predilection for older host erythrocytes, the increased erythrocyte destruction and ensuing erythropoiesis result in a predominantly younger erythrocyte population, which in turn leads to a decrease in &quot;Plasmodium&quot; population. Notably, this effect appears to be largely independent of the host&#x27;s immune control of &quot;Plasmodium&quot;.

Finally, a review article published in December 2020 noted a correlation between malaria-endemic regions and COVID-19 case fatality rates. The study found that, on average, regions where malaria is endemic reported lower COVID-19 case fatality rates compared to regions without endemic malaria.

In 2017, a bacterial strain of the genus Serratia was genetically modified to prevent malaria in mosquitos and in 2023, it has been reported that the bacterium Delftia tsuruhatensis naturally prevents the development of malaria by secreting a molecule called Harmane.

Other avenue that can contribute to understanding of malaria transmission, is the source of meal for the vector when they have the parasites. Its known that plant sugars are the primary source of nutrients for survival of adult mosquitoes, therefore utilising this link for management of the vector will contribute in mitigating malaria transmission.

==Other animals==
While none of the main four species of malaria parasite that cause human infections are known to have animal reservoirs, &quot;P. knowlesi&quot; is known to infect both humans and non-human primates. Other non-human primate malarias (particularly &quot;P. cynomolgi&quot; and &quot;P. simium&quot;) have also been found to have spilled over into humans. Nearly 200 &quot;Plasmodium&quot; species have been identified that infect birds, reptiles, and other mammals, and about 30 of them naturally infect non-human primates. Some malaria parasites of non-human primates (NHP) serve as model organisms for human malarial parasites, such as &quot;P. coatneyi&quot; (a model for &quot;P. falciparum&quot;) and &quot;P. cynomolgi&quot; (a model for &quot;P. vivax&quot;). Diagnostic techniques used to detect parasites in NHP are similar to those employed for humans. Malaria parasites that infect rodents are widely used as models in research, such as &quot;P. berghei&quot;. Avian malaria primarily affects species of the order Passeriformes, and poses a substantial threat to birds of Hawaii, the Galapagos, and other archipelagoes. The parasite &quot;P. relictum&quot; is known to play a role in limiting the distribution and abundance of endemic Hawaiian birds. Global warming is expected to increase the prevalence and global distribution of avian malaria, as elevated temperatures provide optimal conditions for parasite reproduction.

<doc id="20424" wikidata="Q26388" url="?curid=20424" title="Lunar phase">
<text>A lunar phase or Moon phase is the apparent shape of the Moon&#x27;s directly sunlit portion as viewed from the Earth. Because the Moon is tidally locked with the Earth, the same hemisphere is always facing the Earth. In common usage, the four major phases are the new moon, the first quarter, the full moon and the last quarter; the four minor phases are waxing crescent, waxing gibbous, waning gibbous, and waning crescent. A lunar month is the time between successive recurrences of the same phase: due to the eccentricity of the Moon&#x27;s orbit, this duration is not perfectly constant but averages about 29.5 days.

The appearance of the Moon (its phase) gradually changes over a lunar month as the relative orbital positions of the Moon around Earth, and Earth around the Sun, shift. The visible side of the Moon is sunlit to varying extents, depending on the position of the Moon in its orbit, with the sunlit portion varying from 0% (at new moon) to nearly 100% (at full moon).

==Phases of the Moon==


There are four &quot;principal&quot; (primary, or major) lunar phases: the new moon, first quarter, full moon, and last quarter (also known as third or final quarter), when the Moon&#x27;s ecliptic longitude is at an angle to the Sun (as viewed from the center of the Earth) of 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270° respectively. Each of these phases appears at slightly different times at different locations on Earth, and tabulated times are therefore always &quot;geocentric&quot; (calculated for the Earth&#x27;s center).

Between the principal phases are &quot;intermediate&quot; phases, during which the apparent shape of the illuminated Moon is either crescent or . On average, the intermediate phases last one-quarter of a synodic month, or 7.38 days.

The term &#x27; is used for an intermediate phase when the Moon&#x27;s apparent shape is thickening, from new to a full moon; and &#x27; when the shape is thinning. The duration from full moon to new moon (or new moon to full moon) varies from approximately to about .

Due to lunar motion relative to the meridian and the ecliptic, in Earth&#x27;s northern hemisphere:
*A new moon appears highest at the summer solstice and lowest at the winter solstice.
*A first-quarter moon appears highest at the spring equinox and lowest at the autumn equinox.
*A full moon appears highest at the winter solstice and lowest at the summer solstice.
*A last-quarter moon appears highest at the autumn equinox and lowest at the spring equinox.

Non-Western cultures may use a different number of lunar phases; for example, traditional Hawaiian culture has a total of 30 phases (one per day).

==Lunar libration==

As seen from Earth, the Moon&#x27;s eccentric orbit makes it both slightly change its apparent size, and to be seen from slightly different angles. The effect is subtle to the naked eye, from night to night, yet somewhat obvious in time-lapse photography.

Lunar libration causes part of the back side of the Moon to be visible to a terrestrial observer some of the time. Because of this, around 59% of the Moon&#x27;s surface has been imaged from the ground.

==Principal and intermediate phases of the Moon==


===Waxing and waning===

When the Sun and Moon are aligned on the same side of the Earth (conjunct), the Moon is &quot;new&quot;, and the side of the Moon facing Earth is not illuminated by the Sun. As the Moon &quot;waxes&quot; (the amount of illuminated surface as seen from Earth increases), the lunar phases progress through the new moon, crescent moon, first-quarter moon, moon, and full moon phases. The Moon then &quot;wanes&quot; as it passes through the gibbous moon, third-quarter moon, and crescent moon phases, before returning back to new moon.

The terms &quot;old moon&quot; and &quot;new moon&quot; are not interchangeable. The &quot;old moon&quot; is a waning sliver (which eventually becomes undetectable to the naked eye) until the moment it aligns with the Sun and begins to wax, at which point it becomes new again. &quot;Half moon&quot; is often used to mean the first- and third-quarter moons, while the term &quot;quarter&quot; refers to the extent of the Moon&#x27;s cycle around the Earth, not its shape.

When an illuminated hemisphere is viewed from a certain angle, the portion of the illuminated area that is visible will have a two-dimensional shape as defined by the intersection of an ellipse and circle (in which the ellipse&#x27;s major axis coincides with the circle&#x27;s diameter). If the half-ellipse is convex with respect to the half-circle, then the shape will be gibbous (bulging outwards), whereas if the half-ellipse is concave with respect to the half-circle, then the shape will be a crescent. When a crescent moon occurs, the phenomenon of earthshine may be apparent, where the night side of the Moon dimly reflects indirect sunlight reflected from Earth.

===Orientation by latitude===

In the Northern Hemisphere, if the left side of the Moon is dark, then the bright part is thickening, and the Moon is described as (shifting toward full moon). If the right side of the Moon is dark, then the bright part is thinning, and the Moon is described as waning (past full and shifting toward new moon). Assuming that the viewer is in the Northern Hemisphere, the right side of the Moon is the part that is always waxing. (That is, if the right side is dark, the Moon is becoming darker; if the right side is lit, the Moon is getting brighter.)

In the Southern Hemisphere, the Moon is observed from a perspective inverted, or rotated 180°, to that of the Northern and to all of the images in this article, so that the opposite sides appear to wax or wane.

Closer to the Equator, the lunar terminator will appear horizontal during the morning and evening. Since the above descriptions of the lunar phases only apply at middle or high latitudes, observers moving towards the tropics from northern or southern latitudes will see the Moon rotated anti-clockwise or clockwise with respect to the images in this article.

The lunar crescent can open upward or downward, with the &quot;horns&quot; of the crescent pointing up or down, respectively. When the Sun appears above the Moon in the sky, the crescent opens downward; when the Moon is above the Sun, the crescent opens upward. The crescent Moon is most clearly and brightly visible when the Sun is below the horizon, which implies that the Moon must be above the Sun, and the crescent must open upward. This is therefore the orientation in which the crescent Moon is most often seen from the tropics. The waxing and waning crescents look very similar. The waxing crescent appears in the western sky in the evening, and the waning crescent in the eastern sky in the morning.

===Earthshine===

When the Moon (seen from Earth) is a thin crescent, Earth (as viewed from the Moon) is almost fully lit by the Sun. Often, the dark side of the Moon is dimly illuminated by indirect sunlight reflected from Earth, but is bright enough to be easily visible from Earth. This phenomenon is called earthshine, sometimes picturesquely described as &quot;the old moon in the new moon&#x27;s arms&quot; or &quot;the new moon in the old moon&#x27;s arms&quot;.

==Timekeeping ==

Archaeologists have reconstructed methods of timekeeping that go back to prehistoric times, at least as old as the Neolithic. The natural units for timekeeping used by most historical societies are the day, the solar year and the lunation. The first crescent of the new moon provides a clear and regular marker in time and pure lunar calendars (such as the Islamic Hijri calendar) rely completely on this metric. The fact, however, that a year of twelve lunar months is ten or eleven days shorter than the solar year means that a lunar calendar drifts out of step with the seasons. Lunisolar calendars resolve this issue with a year of thirteen lunar months every few years, or by restarting the count at the first new (or full) moon after the winter solstice. The Sumerian calendar is the first recorded to have used the former method; Chinese calendar uses the latter, despite delaying its start until the second or even third new moon after the solstice. The Hindu calendar, also a lunisolar calendar, further divides the month into two fourteen day periods that mark the waxing moon and the waning moon. 

The ancient Roman calendar was broadly a lunisolar one; on the decree of Julius Caesar in the first century BCE, Rome changed to a solar calendar of twelve months, each of a fixed number of days except in a leap year. This, the Julian calendar (slightly revised in 1582 to correct the leap year rule), is the basis for the Gregorian calendar that is almost exclusively the civil calendar in use worldwide today.

==Calculating phase==
Each of the four intermediate phases lasts approximately seven days (7.38 days on average), but varies ±11.25% due to lunar apogee and perigee.

The number of days counted from the time of the new moon is the Moon&#x27;s &quot;age&quot;. Each complete cycle of phases is called a &quot;lunation&quot;.

The approximate age of the Moon, and hence the approximate phase, can be calculated for any date by calculating the number of days since a known new moon (such as 1 January 1900 or 11 August 1999) and reducing this modulo 29.53059 days (the mean length of a synodic month). The difference between two dates can be calculated by subtracting the Julian day number of one from that of the other, or there are simpler formulae giving (for instance) the number of days since 31 December 1899. However, this calculation assumes a perfectly circular orbit and makes no allowance for the time of day at which the new moon occurred and therefore may be incorrect by several hours. (It also becomes less accurate the larger the difference between the required date and the reference date.) It is accurate enough to use in a novelty clock application showing lunar phase, but specialist usage taking account of lunar apogee and perigee requires a more elaborate calculation. Also, due to lunar libration it is not uncommon to see up to 101% of the full moon or even up to 5% of the lunar backside.

== Effect of parallax ==

The Earth subtends an angle of about two degrees when seen from the Moon. This means that an observer on Earth who sees the Moon when it is close to the eastern horizon sees it from an angle that is about 2 degrees different from the line of sight of an observer who sees the Moon on the western horizon. The Moon moves about 12 degrees around its orbit per day, so, if these observers were stationary, they would see the phases of the Moon at times that differ by about one-sixth of a day, or 4 hours. But in reality, the observers are on the surface of the rotating Earth, so someone who sees the Moon on the eastern horizon at one moment sees it on the western horizon about 12 hours later. This adds an oscillation to the apparent progression of the lunar phases. They appear to occur more slowly when the Moon is high in the sky than when it is below the horizon. The Moon appears to move jerkily, and the phases do the same. The amplitude of this oscillation is never more than about four hours, which is a small fraction of a month. It does not have any obvious effect on the appearance of the Moon. It does however affect accurate calculations of the times of lunar phases.

== Misconceptions ==
=== Orbital period ===
It can be confusing that the Moon&#x27;s orbital sidereal period is 27.3 days while the phases complete a cycle once every 29.5 days (synodic period). This is due to the Earth&#x27;s orbit around the Sun. The Moon orbits the Earth 13.4 times a year, but only passes between the Earth and Sun 12.4 times.

=== Eclipses ===

It might be expected that once every month, when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun during a new moon, its shadow would fall on Earth causing a solar eclipse, but this does not happen every month. Nor is it true that during every full moon, the Earth&#x27;s shadow falls on the Moon, causing a lunar eclipse. Solar and lunar eclipses are not observed &quot;every&quot; month because the plane of the Moon&#x27;s orbit around the Earth is tilted by about 5° with respect to the plane of Earth&#x27;s orbit around the Sun (the plane of the ecliptic). Thus, when new and full moons occur, the Moon usually lies to the north or south of a direct line through the Earth and Sun. Although an eclipse can only occur when the Moon is either new (solar) or full (lunar), it must also be positioned very near the intersection of Earth&#x27;s orbital plane about the Sun and the Moon&#x27;s orbital plane about the Earth (that is, at one of its nodes). This happens about twice per year, and so there are between four and seven eclipses in a calendar year. Most of these eclipses are partial; total eclipses of the Moon or Sun are less frequent.

=== Mechanism ===
The phases are not caused by the Earth&#x27;s shadow falling on the moon, as some people believe.

<text>The Metonic cycle or enneadecaeteris (from , from ἐννεακαίδεκα, &quot;nineteen&quot;) is a period of almost exactly 19 years after which the lunar phases recur at the same time of the year. The recurrence is not perfect, and by precise observation the Metonic cycle defined as 235 synodic months is just 2 hours, 4 minutes and 58 seconds longer than 19 tropical years. Meton of Athens, in the 5th century BC, judged the cycle to be a whole number of days, 6,940. Using these whole numbers facilitates the construction of a lunisolar calendar.

A tropical year (about 365.24 days) is longer than 12 lunar months (about 354.36 days) and shorter than 13 of them (about 383.90 days). In a Metonic calendar (a type of lunisolar calendar), there are twelve years of 12 lunar months and seven years of 13 lunar months.

==Application in traditional calendars==
In the Babylonian and Hebrew lunisolar calendars, the years 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17, and 19 are the long (13-month) years of the Metonic cycle. This cycle forms the basis of the Greek and Hebrew calendars. A 19-year cycle is used for the computation of the date of Easter each year.
The Babylonians applied the 19-year cycle from the late sixth century BC.

According to Livy, the second king of Rome, Numa Pompilius (reigned 715–673 BC), inserted intercalary months in such a way that &quot;in the twentieth year the days should fall in with the same position of the sun from which they had started&quot;. As &quot;the twentieth year&quot; takes place nineteen years after &quot;the first year&quot;, this seems to indicate that the Metonic cycle was applied to Numa&#x27;s calendar.

Diodorus Siculus reports that Apollo is said to have visited the Hyperboreans once every 19 years.

The Metonic cycle has been implemented in the Antikythera mechanism which offers unexpected evidence for the popularity of the calendar based on it.

The (19-year) Metonic cycle is a lunisolar cycle, as is the (76-year) Callippic cycle. An important example of an application of the Metonic cycle in the Julian calendar is the 19-year lunar cycle insofar as provided with a Metonic structure. Meton introduced the 19 year cycle to the Attic calendar in 432 BC. In the following century, Callippus developed the Callippic cycle of four 19-year periods for a 76-year cycle with a mean year of exactly 365.25 days.

Around AD 260 the Alexandrian computist Anatolius, who became bishop of Laodicea in AD 268, was the first to devise a method for determining the date of Easter Sunday. However, it was some later, somewhat different, version of the Metonic 19-year lunar cycle which, as the basic structure of Dionysius Exiguus&#x27; and also of Bede&#x27;s Easter table, would ultimately prevail throughout Christendom, at least until in the year 1582, when the Gregorian calendar was introduced.

The Coligny calendar is a Celtic lunisolar calendar using the Metonic cycle. The bronze plaque on which it was found dates from c. AD 200, but the internal evidence points to the calendar itself being several centuries older, created in the Iron Age or late Bronze Age.

The Metonic cycle is thought to be numerically encoded on the Berlin Gold Hat from central Europe, dating from c. 1000-800 BC. 

The Runic calendar is a perpetual calendar based on the 19-year-long Metonic cycle. It is also known as a Rune staff or Runic Almanac. This calendar does not rely on knowledge of the duration of the tropical year or of the occurrence of leap years. It is set at the beginning of each year by observing the first full moon after the winter solstice. The oldest one known, and the only one from the Middle Ages, is the Nyköping staff, which is believed to date from the 13th century.

The Bahá&#x27;í calendar, established during the middle of the 19th century, is also based on cycles of 19 solar years.

===Hebrew calendar===
A Small Maḥzor (Hebrew מחזור, , meaning &quot;cycle&quot;) is a 19-year cycle in the lunisolar calendar system used by the Jewish people. It is similar to, but slightly different in usage from, the Greek Metonic cycle (being based on a month of days, giving a cycle of  ≈ 6939.69 days), and likely derived from or alongside the much earlier Babylonian calendar.

===Polynesia===
It is possible that the Polynesian kilo-hoku (astronomers) discovered the Metonic cycle in the same way Meton had, by trying to make the month fit the year.

==Mathematical basis==

The Metonic cycle is the most accurate cycle of time (in a timespan of less than 100 years) for synchronizing the tropical year and the lunar month (synodic month), when the method of synchronizing is the intercalation of a thirteenth lunar month in a calendar year from time to time. The traditional lunar year of 12 synodic months is about 354 days, approximately eleven days short of the solar year. Thus, every 2 to 3 years there is a discrepancy of 22 to 33 days, or a full synodic month. For example, if the winter solstice and the new moon coincide, it takes 19 tropical years for the coincidence to recur. The mathematical logic is this:
*A tropical year lasts 365.2422 days. 
*:a span of 19 tropical years (365.2422 × 19) lasts 6,939.602 days 
That duration is almost the same as 235 synodic months:
*A synodic month lasts 29.53059 days.
*:a span of 235 synodic months (29.53059 × 235) lasts 6,939.689 days 
Thus the algorithm is correct to 0.087 days (2 hours, 5 minutes and 16 seconds).

For a lunisolar calendar to &#x27;catch up&#x27; to this discrepancy and thus maintain seasonal consistency, seven intercalary months are added (one at a time), at intervals of every 2–3 years during the course of 19 solar years. Thus twelve of those years have 12 lunar months and seven have 13 months.

<text>Marcello Malpighi (10 March 1628 – 30 November 1694) was an Italian biologist and physician, who is referred to as the &quot;founder of microscopical anatomy, histology and father of physiology and embryology&quot;. Malpighi&#x27;s name is borne by several physiological features related to the biological excretory system, such as the Malpighian corpuscles and Malpighian pyramids of the kidneys and the Malpighian tubule system of insects. The splenic lymphoid nodules are often called the &quot;Malpighian bodies of the spleen&quot; or Malpighian corpuscles. The botanical family Malpighiaceae is also named after him. He was the first person to see capillaries in animals, and he discovered the link between arteries and veins that had eluded William Harvey. Malpighi was one of the earliest people to observe red blood cells under a microscope, after Jan Swammerdam. His treatise &quot;De polypo cordis&quot; (1666) was important for understanding blood composition, as well as how blood clots. In it, Malpighi described how the form of a blood clot differed in the right against the left sides of the heart.

The use of the microscope enabled Malpighi to discover that insects do not use lungs to breathe, but small holes in their skin called tracheae. Malpighi also studied the anatomy of the brain and concluded this organ is a gland. In terms of modern endocrinology, this deduction is correct because the hypothalamus of the brain has long been recognized for its hormone-secreting capacity.

Because Malpighi had a wide knowledge of both plants and animals, he made contributions to the scientific study of both. The Royal Society of London published two volumes of his botanical and zoological works in 1675 and 1679. Another edition followed in 1687, and a supplementary volume in 1697. In his autobiography, Malpighi speaks of his &quot;Anatome Plantarum&quot;, decorated with the engravings of Robert White, as &quot;the most elegant format in the whole literate world.&quot;

His study of plants led him to conclude that plants had tubules similar to those he saw in insects like the silkworm (using his microscope, he probably saw the stomata, through which plants exchange carbon dioxide with oxygen). Malpighi observed that when a ring-like portion of bark was removed on a trunk a swelling occurred in the tissues above the ring, and he correctly interpreted this as growth stimulated by food coming down from the leaves, and being blocked above the ring.

==Early years==
Malpighi was born on 10 March 1628 at Crevalcore near Bologna, Italy. The son of well-to-do parents, Malpighi was educated in his native city, entering the University of Bologna at the age of 17. In a posthumous work delivered and dedicated to the Royal Society in London in 1697, Malpighi says he completed his grammatical studies in 1645, at which point he began to apply himself to the study of peripatetic philosophy. He completed these studies in about 1649, where at the persuasion of his mother Frances Natalis, he began to study physics. When his parents and grandmother became ill, he returned to his family home near Bologna to care for them. Malpighi studied Aristotelian philosophy at the University of Bologna while he was very young. He joined the school of anatomy under Bartolomeo Massari and was one of nine students who met at the home of the master to conduct dissections. He married Francesca the daughter of Massari but it was short-lived as she died shortly after. Despite opposition from the university authorities because he was non-Bolognese by birth, in 1653 he was granted doctorates in both medicine and philosophy. He later graduated as a medical doctor at the age of 25. Subsequently, he was appointed as a teacher, whereupon he immediately dedicated himself to further study in anatomy and medicine. For most of his career, Malpighi combined an intense interest in scientific research with a fond love of teaching. He was invited to correspond with the Royal Society in 1667 by Henry Oldenburg, and became a fellow of the society the next year.

In 1656, Ferdinand II of Tuscany invited him to the professorship of theoretical medicine at the University of Pisa. There Malpighi began his lifelong friendship with Giovanni Borelli, mathematician and naturalist, who was a prominent supporter of the Accademia del Cimento, one of the first scientific societies. Malpighi questioned the prevailing medical teachings at Pisa, tried experiments on colour changes in blood, and attempted to recast anatomical, physiological, and medical problems of the day. Family responsibilities and poor health prompted Malpighi&#x27;s return in 1659 to the University of Bologna, where he continued to teach and do research with his microscopes. In 1661 he identified and described the pulmonary and capillary network connecting small arteries with small veins. Malpighi&#x27;s views evoked increasing controversy and dissent, mainly from envy and lack of understanding on the part of his colleagues.

==Career==

In 1653, his father, mother, and grandmother being dead, Malpighi left his family villa and returned to the University of Bologna to study anatomy. In 1656, he was made a reader at Bologna, and then a professor of physics at Pisa, where he began to abandon the disputative method of learning and apply himself to a more experimental method of research. Based on this research, he wrote some &quot;Dialogues against the Peripatetics and Galenists&quot; (those who followed the precepts of Galen and were spearheaded at the University Bologna by fellow physician but inveterate foe Giovanni Girolamo Sbaraglia), which were destroyed when his house burned down. Weary of philosophical disputation, in 1660, Malpighi returned to Bologna and dedicated himself to the study of anatomy. He subsequently discovered a new structure of the lungs which led him to several disputes with the learned medical men of the times. In 1662, he was made a professor of physics at the Academy of Messina.

Retiring from university life to his villa in the country near Bologna in 1663, he worked as a physician while continuing to conduct experiments on the plants and insects he found on his estate. There he made discoveries of the structure of plants which he published in his &quot;Observations&quot;. At the end of 1666, Malpighi was invited to return to the public academy at Messina, which he did in 1667. Although he accepted temporary chairs at the universities of Pisa and Messina, throughout his life he continuously returned to Bologna to practice medicine, a city that repaid him by erecting a monument in his memory after his death.

As a physician, Malpighi&#x27;s medical consultations with his patients, which were mostly those belonging to social elite classes, proved useful in better understanding the links between the human anatomy, disease pathology, and treatments for said diseases. Furthermore, Malpighi conducted his consultations not only by bedside, but also by post, using letters to request and conduct them for various patients. These letters served as social connections for the medical practices he performed, allowing his ideas to reach the public even in the face of criticism. These connections that Malpighi created in his practice became even more widespread due to the fact that he practised in various countries. However, long distances complicated consults for some of his patients. The manner in which Malpighi practised medicine also reveals that it was customary in his time for Italian patients to have multiple attending physicians as well as consulting physicians. One of Malpighi&#x27;s principles of medical practice was that he did not rely on anecdotes or experiences concerning remedies for various illnesses. Rather, he used his knowledge of human anatomy and disease pathology to practice what he denoted as &quot;rational&quot; medicine (&quot;rational&quot; medicine was in contrast to &quot;empirics&quot;). Malpighi did not abandon traditional substances or treatments, but he did not employ their use simply based on past experiences that did not draw from the nature of the underlying anatomy and disease process. Specifically in his treatments, Malpighi&#x27;s goal was to reset fluid imbalances by coaxing the body to correct them on its own. For example, fluid imbalances should be fixed over time by urination and not by artificial methods such as purgatives and vesicants. In addition to Malpighi&#x27;s &quot;rational&quot; approaches, he also believed in so-called &quot;miraculous,&quot; or &quot;supernatural&quot; healing. For this to occur, though, he argued that the body could not have attempted to expel any malignant matter, such as vomit. Cases in which this did occur, when healing could not be considered miraculous, were known as &quot;crises.&quot;

In 1668, Malpighi received a letter from Mr. Oldenburg of the Royal Society in London, inviting him to correspond. Malpighi wrote his history of the silkworm in 1668, and sent the manuscript to Mr. Oldenburg. As a result, Malpighi was made a member of the Royal Society in 1669. In 1671, Malpighi&#x27;s &quot;Anatomy of Plants&quot; was published in London by the Royal Society, and he simultaneously wrote to Mr. Oldenburg, telling him of his recent discoveries regarding the lungs, fibres of the spleen and testicles, and several other discoveries involving the brain and sensory organs. He also shared more information regarding his research on plants. At that time, he related his disputes with some younger physicians who were strenuous supporters of the Galenic principles and opposed all new discoveries. Following many other discoveries and publications, in 1691, Malpighi was invited to Rome by Pope Innocent XII to become a papal physician and professor of medicine at the Papal Medical School. He remained in Rome until his death.

Marcello Malpighi is buried in the church of Santi Gregorio e Siro, in Bologna, where nowadays can be seen a marble monument to the scientist with an inscription in Latin remembering – among other things – his &quot;SUMMUM INGENIUM / INTEGERRIMAM VITAM / FORTEM STRENUAMQUE MENTEM / AUDACEM SALUTARIS ARTIS AMOREM&quot; (great genius, honest life, strong and tough mind, daring love for the medical art).

==Research==
Around the age of 38, and with a remarkable academic career behind him, Malpighi decided to dedicate his free time to anatomical studies. Although he conducted some of his studies using vivisection and others through the dissection of corpses, his most illustrative efforts appear to have been based on the use of the microscope. Because of this work, many microscopic anatomical structures are named after Malpighi, including a skin layer (Malpighi layer) and two different Malpighian corpuscles in the kidneys and the spleen, as well as the Malpighian tubules in the excretory system of insects.

Although a Dutch spectacle maker created the compound lens and inserted it in a microscope around the turn of the 17th century, and Galileo had applied the principle of the compound lens to the making of his microscope patented in 1609, its possibilities as a microscope had remained unexploited for half a century, until Robert Hooke improved the instrument. Following this, Marcello Malpighi, Hooke, and two other early investigators associated with the Royal Society, Nehemiah Grew and Antoine van Leeuwenhoek were fortunate to have a virtually untried tool in their hands as they began their investigations.

In 1661, Malpighi observed capillary structures in frog lungs. Malpighi&#x27;s first attempt at examining circulation in the lungs was in September 1660, with the dissection of sheep and other mammals where he would inject black ink into the pulmonary artery. Tracing the inks distribution through the artery to the veins in the animal&#x27;s lungs however, the chosen sheep/mammal&#x27;s large size was limiting for his observation of capillaries as they were too small for magnification. Malpighi&#x27;s frog dissection in 1661, proved to be a suitable size that could be magnified to display the capillary network not seen in the larger animals. In discovering and observing the capillaries in the frog&#x27;s lungs, Malpighi studied the movement of the blood in a contained system. This contrasted the previous view of an open circulatory system in which blood would come from the liver/spleen and pool into open spaces in the body. This discovery of capillaries also contributed to William Harvey&#x27;s theory of blood circulation, with capillaries acting as the connection from veins to arteries and confirming a closed system of circulation in animals.

Furthering his analysis of the lungs, Malpighi identified the airways branched into thin membraned spherical cavities which he likened to honeycomb holes surrounded by capillary vessels, in his 1661 work &quot;De pulmonibus observationes anatomicae&quot;. These lung structures now known as alveoli he used to describe the air pathway as continuous inhalation and exhalation with the alveoli at the ends of the pathway acting as a &quot;imperfect sponge&quot; for the air to enter the body. Extrapolating to humans, he offered an explanation for how air and blood mix in the lungs. Malpighi also used the microscope for his studies of the skin, kidneys, and liver. For example, after he dissected a black male, Malpighi made some groundbreaking headway into the discovery of the origin of black skin. He found that the black pigment was associated with a layer of mucus just beneath the skin.

In the years 1663–1667, at the University of Messina where his research focus was on studying the human nervous system where he identified and described nerve endings in the body, structure of the brain, and optic nerve. All of his work in 1665 surrounding the nervous system he published in 3 separate works published in the same year titled, De Lingua about taste and the tongue, De Cerebro about the brain and De Externo Tactus Organo about feeling/touch sensation. In regards to his work on the tongue he discovered small muscle bumps, taste buds, which he called &quot;papillae&quot; and when examining them he described a linked connection to nerve endings that gave the taste sensation when eating. Furthermore, in 1686 through studying a bovine tongue Malpighi dividing the tongue papillae into separate &quot;patches&quot; on the tongues length. When studying the brain, he was one of the first to try to map the grey and white tissue and hypothesized a connection between the brain and spinal cord through nerve endings.

Malpighi&#x27;s work on plant anatomy was inspired in Messina when visiting his patron Visconte Ruffo&#x27;s garden where a chestnut tree&#x27;s split branch had a structure that intrigued him, this structure in modern literature being xylem. He examined the structure in different plants and noted the arrangement of xylem was in either a ring shape or in scattered groupings in the stem. This distinction was later used by biologists to separate the two major families of plants.

A talented sketch artist, Malpighi seems to have been the first author to have made detailed drawings of individual organs of flowers. In his &quot;Anatome plantarum&quot; is a longitudinal section of a flower of &quot;Nigella&quot; (his Melanthi, literally honey-flower) with details of the nectariferous organs. He adds that it is strange that nature has produced on the leaves of the flower shell-like organs in which honey is produced.

Malpighi had success in tracing the ontogeny of plant organs, and the serial development of the shoot owing to his instinct shaped in the sphere of animal embryology. He specialized in seedling development, and in 1679, he published a volume containing a series of exquisitely drawn and engraved images of the stages of development of Leguminosae (beans) and Cucurbitaceae (squash, melons). Later, he published material depicting the development of the date palm. The great Swedish botanist Linnaeus named the genus &quot;Malpighia&quot; in honour of Malpighi&#x27;s work with plants; &quot;Malpighia&quot; is the type genus for the Malpighiaceae, a family of tropical and subtropical flowering plants.

Because Malpighi was concerned with teratology (the scientific study of the visible conditions caused by the interruption or alteration of normal development) he expressed grave misgivings about the view of his contemporaries that the galls of trees and herbs gave birth to insects. He conjectured (correctly) that the creatures in question arose from eggs previously laid in the plant tissue.

Malpighi&#x27;s investigations of the lifecycle of plants and animals led him to the topic of reproduction. He created detailed drawings of his studies of chick embryo development, starting from 2–3 days after fertilization with these drawings of embryos having a focus on the developmental timing of the limbs and organs. Additionally, seed development in plants (such as the lemon tree), and the transformation of caterpillars into insects. Malpighi also postulated about the embryotic growth of humans, written in a letter to Girolamo Correr, a patron of scientists, Malphighi suggested that all the components of the circulatory system would have been developed at the same time in embryo. His discoveries helped to illuminate philosophical arguments surrounding the topics of &quot;emboîtment&quot;, pre-existence, preformation, epigenesis, and metamorphosis.

==Years in Rome==

In 1691 Pope Innocent XII invited him to Rome as papal physician. He taught medicine in the Papal Medical School and wrote a long treatise about his studies which he donated to the Royal Society of London.

Marcello Malpighi died of apoplexy (an old-fashioned term for a stroke or stroke-like symptoms) in Rome on 30 November 1694, at the age of 66. In accordance with his wishes, an autopsy was performed. The Royal Society published his studies in 1696. Asteroid 11121 Malpighi is named in his honour.

<doc id="20431" wikidata="Q41273" url="?curid=20431" title="Momentum">
<text>In Newtonian mechanics, momentum (: momenta or momentums; more specifically linear momentum or translational momentum) is the product of the mass and velocity of an object. It is a vector quantity, possessing a magnitude and a direction. If is an object&#x27;s mass and is its velocity (also a vector quantity), then the object&#x27;s momentum (from Latin &quot;&quot; &quot;push, drive&quot;) is: formula_1
In the International System of Units (SI), the unit of measurement of momentum is the kilogram metre per second (kg⋅m/s), which is dimensionally equivalent to the newton-second.

Newton&#x27;s second law of motion states that the rate of change of a body&#x27;s momentum is equal to the net force acting on it. Momentum depends on the frame of reference, but in any inertial frame of reference, it is a &quot;conserved&quot; quantity, meaning that if a closed system is not affected by external forces, its total momentum does not change. Momentum is also conserved in special relativity (with a modified formula) and, in a modified form, in electrodynamics, quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, and general relativity. It is an expression of one of the fundamental symmetries of space and time: translational symmetry.

Advanced formulations of classical mechanics, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics, allow one to choose coordinate systems that incorporate symmetries and constraints. In these systems the conserved quantity is generalized momentum, and in general this is different from the kinetic momentum defined above. The concept of generalized momentum is carried over into quantum mechanics, where it becomes an operator on a wave function. The momentum and position operators are related by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

In continuous systems such as electromagnetic fields, fluid dynamics and deformable bodies, a momentum density can be defined as momentum per volume (a volume-specific quantity). A continuum version of the conservation of momentum leads to equations such as the Navier–Stokes equations for fluids or the Cauchy momentum equation for deformable solids or fluids.

==Classical==
Momentum is a vector quantity: it has both magnitude and direction. Since momentum has a direction, it can be used to predict the resulting direction and speed of motion of objects after they collide. Below, the basic properties of momentum are described in one dimension. The vector equations are almost identical to the scalar equations (see multiple dimensions).

===Single particle===
The momentum of a particle is conventionally represented by the letter . It is the product of two quantities, the particle&#x27;s mass (represented by the letter ) and its velocity ():
formula_2

The unit of momentum is the product of the units of mass and velocity. In SI units, if the mass is in kilograms and the velocity is in meters per second then the momentum is in kilogram meters per second (kg⋅m/s). In cgs units, if the mass is in grams and the velocity in centimeters per second, then the momentum is in gram centimeters per second (g⋅cm/s).

Being a vector, momentum has magnitude and direction. For example, a 1 kg model airplane, traveling due north at 1 m/s in straight and level flight, has a momentum of 1 kg⋅m/s due north measured with reference to the ground.

===Many particles===
The momentum of a system of particles is the vector sum of their momenta. If two particles have respective masses and , and velocities and , the total momentum is
formula_3
The momenta of more than two particles can be added more generally with the following:
formula_4

A system of particles has a center of mass, a point determined by the weighted sum of their positions:
formula_5

If one or more of the particles is moving, the center of mass of the system will generally be moving as well (unless the system is in pure rotation around it). If the total mass of the particles is formula_6, and the center of mass is moving at velocity , the momentum of the system is:

formula_7

This is known as Euler&#x27;s first law.

===Relation to force===

If the net force applied to a particle is constant, and is applied for a time interval , the momentum of the particle changes by an amount
formula_8

In differential form, this is Newton&#x27;s second law; the rate of change of the momentum of a particle is equal to the instantaneous force acting on it,
formula_9

If the net force experienced by a particle changes as a function of time, , the change in momentum (or impulse ) between times and is
formula_10

Impulse is measured in the derived units of the newton second (1 N⋅s = 1 kg⋅m/s) or dyne second (1 dyne⋅s = 1 g⋅cm/s)

Under the assumption of constant mass , it is equivalent to write

formula_11

hence the net force is equal to the mass of the particle times its acceleration.

&quot;Example&quot;: A model airplane of mass 1 kg accelerates from rest to a velocity of 6 m/s due north in 2 s. The net force required to produce this acceleration is 3 newtons due north. The change in momentum is 6 kg⋅m/s due north. The rate of change of momentum is 3 (kg⋅m/s)/s due north which is numerically equivalent to 3 newtons.

===Conservation===
In a closed system (one that does not exchange any matter with its surroundings and is not acted on by external forces) the total momentum remains constant. This fact, known as the law of conservation of momentum, is implied by Newton&#x27;s laws of motion. Suppose, for example, that two particles interact. As explained by the third law, the forces between them are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. If the particles are numbered 1 and 2, the second law states that and . Therefore,

formula_12
with the negative sign indicating that the forces oppose. Equivalently,

formula_13

If the velocities of the particles are and before the interaction, and afterwards they are and , then

formula_14

This law holds no matter how complicated the force is between particles. Similarly, if there are several particles, the momentum exchanged between each pair of particles adds to zero, so the total change in momentum is zero. The conservation of the total momentum of a number of interacting particles can be expressed as formula_15

This conservation law applies to all interactions, including collisions (both elastic and inelastic) and separations caused by explosive forces. It can also be generalized to situations where Newton&#x27;s laws do not hold, for example in the theory of relativity and in electrodynamics.

===Dependence on reference frame===
Momentum is a measurable quantity, and the measurement depends on the frame of reference. For example: if an aircraft of mass 1000 kg is flying through the air at a speed of 50 m/s its momentum can be calculated to be 50,000 kg.m/s. If the aircraft is flying into a headwind of 5 m/s its speed relative to the surface of the Earth is only 45 m/s and its momentum can be calculated to be 45,000 kg.m/s. Both calculations are equally correct. In both frames of reference, any change in momentum will be found to be consistent with the relevant laws of physics.

Suppose is a position in an inertial frame of reference. From the point of view of another frame of reference, moving at a constant speed relative to the other, the position (represented by a primed coordinate) changes with time as

formula_16

This is called a Galilean transformation.

If a particle is moving at speed in the first frame of reference, in the second, it is moving at speed

formula_17

Since does not change, the second reference frame is also an inertial frame and the accelerations are the same:

formula_18

Thus, momentum is conserved in both reference frames. Moreover, as long as the force has the same form, in both frames, Newton&#x27;s second law is unchanged. Forces such as Newtonian gravity, which depend only on the scalar distance between objects, satisfy this criterion. This independence of reference frame is called Newtonian relativity or Galilean invariance.

A change of reference frame can often simplify calculations of motion. For example, in a collision of two particles, a reference frame can be chosen where one particle begins at rest. Another commonly used reference frame is the center of mass frame – one that is moving with the center of mass. In this frame, the total momentum is zero.

===Application to collisions===
If two particles, each of known momentum, collide and coalesce, the law of conservation of momentum can be used to determine the momentum of the coalesced body. If the outcome of the collision is that the two particles separate, the law is not sufficient to determine the momentum of each particle. If the momentum of one particle after the collision is known, the law can be used to determine the momentum of the other particle. Alternatively if the combined kinetic energy after the collision is known, the law can be used to determine the momentum of each particle after the collision. Kinetic energy is usually not conserved. If it is conserved, the collision is called an &quot;elastic collision&quot;; if not, it is an &quot;inelastic collision&quot;.

====Elastic collisions====

An elastic collision is one in which no kinetic energy is transformed into heat or some other form of energy. Perfectly elastic collisions can occur when the objects do not touch each other, as for example in atomic or nuclear scattering where electric repulsion keeps the objects apart. A slingshot maneuver of a satellite around a planet can also be viewed as a perfectly elastic collision. A collision between two pool balls is a good example of an &quot;almost&quot; totally elastic collision, due to their high rigidity, but when bodies come in contact there is always some dissipation.

A head-on elastic collision between two bodies can be represented by velocities in one dimension, along a line passing through the bodies. If the velocities are and before the collision and and after, the equations expressing conservation of momentum and kinetic energy are:

formula_19

A change of reference frame can simplify analysis of a collision. For example, suppose there are two bodies of equal mass , one stationary and one approaching the other at a speed (as in the figure). The center of mass is moving at speed and both bodies are moving towards it at speed . Because of the symmetry, after the collision both must be moving away from the center of mass at the same speed. Adding the speed of the center of mass to both, we find that the body that was moving is now stopped and the other is moving away at speed . The bodies have exchanged their velocities. Regardless of the velocities of the bodies, a switch to the center of mass frame leads us to the same conclusion. Therefore, the final velocities are given by

formula_20

In general, when the initial velocities are known, the final velocities are given by

formula_21

If one body has much greater mass than the other, its velocity will be little affected by a collision while the other body will experience a large change.

====Inelastic collisions====

In an inelastic collision, some of the kinetic energy of the colliding bodies is converted into other forms of energy (such as heat or sound). Examples include traffic collisions, in which the effect of loss of kinetic energy can be seen in the damage to the vehicles; electrons losing some of their energy to atoms (as in the Franck–Hertz experiment); and particle accelerators in which the kinetic energy is converted into mass in the form of new particles.

In a perfectly inelastic collision (such as a bug hitting a windshield), both bodies have the same motion afterwards. A head-on inelastic collision between two bodies can be represented by velocities in one dimension, along a line passing through the bodies. If the velocities are and before the collision then in a perfectly inelastic collision both bodies will be travelling with velocity after the collision. The equation expressing conservation of momentum is:

formula_22

If one body is motionless to begin with (e.g. formula_23), the equation for conservation of momentum is

formula_24

so

formula_25

In a different situation, if the frame of reference is moving at the final velocity such that formula_26, the objects would be brought to rest by a perfectly inelastic collision and 100% of the kinetic energy is converted to other forms of energy. In this instance the initial velocities of the bodies would be non-zero, or the bodies would have to be massless.

One measure of the inelasticity of the collision is the coefficient of restitution , defined as the ratio of relative velocity of separation to relative velocity of approach. In applying this measure to a ball bouncing from a solid surface, this can be easily measured using the following formula:

formula_27

The momentum and energy equations also apply to the motions of objects that begin together and then move apart. For example, an explosion is the result of a chain reaction that transforms potential energy stored in chemical, mechanical, or nuclear form into kinetic energy, acoustic energy, and electromagnetic radiation. Rockets also make use of conservation of momentum: propellant is thrust outward, gaining momentum, and an equal and opposite momentum is imparted to the rocket.

===Multiple dimensions===

Real motion has both direction and velocity and must be represented by a vector. In a coordinate system with axes, velocity has components in the -direction, in the -direction, in the -direction. The vector is represented by a boldface symbol:

formula_28

Similarly, the momentum is a vector quantity and is represented by a boldface symbol:

formula_29

The equations in the previous sections, work in vector form if the scalars and are replaced by vectors and . Each vector equation represents three scalar equations. For example,

formula_30

represents three equations:

formula_31

The kinetic energy equations are exceptions to the above replacement rule. The equations are still one-dimensional, but each scalar represents the magnitude of the vector, for example,

formula_32

Each vector equation represents three scalar equations. Often coordinates can be chosen so that only two components are needed, as in the figure. Each component can be obtained separately and the results combined to produce a vector result.

A simple construction involving the center of mass frame can be used to show that if a stationary elastic sphere is struck by a moving sphere, the two will head off at right angles after the collision (as in the figure).

=== Objects of variable mass ===

The concept of momentum plays a fundamental role in explaining the behavior of variable-mass objects such as a rocket ejecting fuel or a star accreting gas. In analyzing such an object, one treats the object&#x27;s mass as a function that varies with time: . The momentum of the object at time is therefore . One might then try to invoke Newton&#x27;s second law of motion by saying that the external force on the object is related to its momentum by , but this is incorrect, as is the related expression found by applying the product rule to :

formula_33

This equation does not correctly describe the motion of variable-mass objects. The correct equation is

formula_34

where is the velocity of the ejected/accreted mass &quot;as seen in the object&#x27;s rest frame&quot;. This is distinct from , which is the velocity of the object itself as seen in an inertial frame.

This equation is derived by keeping track of both the momentum of the object as well as the momentum of the ejected/accreted mass (). When considered together, the object and the mass () constitute a closed system in which total momentum is conserved.

formula_35

==Generalized==

Newton&#x27;s laws can be difficult to apply to many kinds of motion because the motion is limited by &quot;constraints&quot;. For example, a bead on an abacus is constrained to move along its wire and a pendulum bob is constrained to swing at a fixed distance from the pivot. Many such constraints can be incorporated by changing the normal Cartesian coordinates to a set of &quot;generalized coordinates&quot; that may be fewer in number. Refined mathematical methods have been developed for solving mechanics problems in generalized coordinates. They introduce a &quot;generalized momentum&quot;, also known as the &quot;canonical momentum&quot; or &quot;conjugate momentum&quot;, that extends the concepts of both linear momentum and angular momentum. To distinguish it from generalized momentum, the product of mass and velocity is also referred to as &quot;mechanical momentum&quot;, &quot;kinetic momentum&quot; or &quot;kinematic momentum&quot;. The two main methods are described below.

===Lagrangian mechanics===
In Lagrangian mechanics, a Lagrangian is defined as the difference between the kinetic energy and the potential energy :

formula_36

If the generalized coordinates are represented as a vector and time differentiation is represented by a dot over the variable, then the equations of motion (known as the Lagrange or Euler–Lagrange equations) are a set of equations:

formula_37

If a coordinate is not a Cartesian coordinate, the associated generalized momentum component does not necessarily have the dimensions of linear momentum. Even if is a Cartesian coordinate, will not be the same as the mechanical momentum if the potential depends on velocity. Some sources represent the kinematic momentum by the symbol .

In this mathematical framework, a generalized momentum is associated with the generalized coordinates. Its components are defined as

formula_38

Each component is said to be the &quot;conjugate momentum&quot; for the coordinate .

Now if a given coordinate does not appear in the Lagrangian (although its time derivative might appear), then is constant. This is the generalization of the conservation of momentum.

Even if the generalized coordinates are just the ordinary spatial coordinates, the conjugate momenta are not necessarily the ordinary momentum coordinates. An example is found in the section on electromagnetism.

===Hamiltonian mechanics===
In Hamiltonian mechanics, the Lagrangian (a function of generalized coordinates and their derivatives) is replaced by a Hamiltonian that is a function of generalized coordinates and momentum. The Hamiltonian is defined as

formula_39

where the momentum is obtained by differentiating the Lagrangian as above. The Hamiltonian equations of motion are

formula_40

As in Lagrangian mechanics, if a generalized coordinate does not appear in the Hamiltonian, its conjugate momentum component is conserved.

===Symmetry and conservation===
Conservation of momentum is a mathematical consequence of the homogeneity (shift symmetry) of space (position in space is the canonical conjugate quantity to momentum). That is, conservation of momentum is a consequence of the fact that the laws of physics do not depend on position; this is a special case of Noether&#x27;s theorem. For systems that do not have this symmetry, it may not be possible to define conservation of momentum. Examples where conservation of momentum does not apply include curved spacetimes in general relativity or time crystals in condensed matter physics.

==Momentum density==
===In deformable bodies and fluids===

====Conservation in a continuum====
In fields such as fluid dynamics and solid mechanics, it is not feasible to follow the motion of individual atoms or molecules. Instead, the materials must be approximated by a continuum in which, at each point, there is a particle or fluid parcel that is assigned the average of the properties of atoms in a small region nearby. In particular, it has a density and velocity that depend on time and position . The momentum per unit volume is .

Consider a column of water in hydrostatic equilibrium. All the forces on the water are in balance and the water is motionless. On any given drop of water, two forces are balanced. The first is gravity, which acts directly on each atom and molecule inside. The gravitational force per unit volume is , where is the gravitational acceleration. The second force is the sum of all the forces exerted on its surface by the surrounding water. The force from below is greater than the force from above by just the amount needed to balance gravity. The normal force per unit area is the pressure . The average force per unit volume inside the droplet is the gradient of the pressure, so the force balance equation is

formula_41

If the forces are not balanced, the droplet accelerates. This acceleration is not simply the partial derivative because the fluid in a given volume changes with time. Instead, the material derivative is needed:

formula_42

Applied to any physical quantity, the material derivative includes the rate of change at a point and the changes due to advection as fluid is carried past the point. Per unit volume, the rate of change in momentum is equal to . This is equal to the net force on the droplet.

Forces that can change the momentum of a droplet include the gradient of the pressure and gravity, as above. In addition, surface forces can deform the droplet. In the simplest case, a shear stress , exerted by a force parallel to the surface of the droplet, is proportional to the rate of deformation or strain rate. Such a shear stress occurs if the fluid has a velocity gradient because the fluid is moving faster on one side than another. If the speed in the direction varies with , the tangential force in direction per unit area normal to the direction is

formula_43

where is the viscosity. This is also a flux, or flow per unit area, of -momentum through the surface.

Including the effect of viscosity, the momentum balance equations for the incompressible flow of a Newtonian fluid are

formula_44

These are known as the Navier–Stokes equations.

The momentum balance equations can be extended to more general materials, including solids. For each surface with normal in direction and force in direction , there is a stress component . The nine components make up the Cauchy stress tensor , which includes both pressure and shear. The local conservation of momentum is expressed by the Cauchy momentum equation:

formula_45

where is the body force.

The Cauchy momentum equation is broadly applicable to deformations of solids and liquids. The relationship between the stresses and the strain rate depends on the properties of the material (see Types of viscosity).

====Acoustic waves====

A disturbance in a medium gives rise to oscillations, or waves, that propagate away from their source. In a fluid, small changes in pressure can often be described by the acoustic wave equation:

formula_46

where is the speed of sound. In a solid, similar equations can be obtained for propagation of pressure (P-waves) and shear (S-waves).

The flux, or transport per unit area, of a momentum component by a velocity is equal to . In the linear approximation that leads to the above acoustic equation, the time average of this flux is zero. However, nonlinear effects can give rise to a nonzero average. It is possible for momentum flux to occur even though the wave itself does not have a mean momentum.

===In electromagnetics===

====Particle in a field====

In Maxwell&#x27;s equations, the forces between particles are mediated by electric and magnetic fields. The electromagnetic force (&quot;Lorentz force&quot;) on a particle with charge due to a combination of electric field and magnetic field is

formula_47

(in SI units).
It has an electric potential and magnetic vector potential .
In the non-relativistic regime, its generalized momentum is

formula_48

while in relativistic mechanics this becomes

formula_49

The quantity is sometimes called the &quot;potential momentum&quot;. It is the momentum due to the interaction of the particle with the electromagnetic fields. The name is an analogy with the potential energy , which is the energy due to the interaction of the particle with the electromagnetic fields. These quantities form a four-vector, so the analogy is consistent; besides, the concept of potential momentum is important in explaining the so-called hidden momentum of the electromagnetic fields.

====Conservation====
In Newtonian mechanics, the law of conservation of momentum can be derived from the law of action and reaction, which states that every force has a reciprocating equal and opposite force. Under some circumstances, moving charged particles can exert forces on each other in non-opposite directions. Nevertheless, the combined momentum of the particles and the electromagnetic field is conserved.

=====Vacuum=====
The Lorentz force imparts a momentum to the particle, so by Newton&#x27;s second law the particle must impart a momentum to the electromagnetic fields.

In a vacuum, the momentum per unit volume is

formula_50

where is the vacuum permeability and is the speed of light. The momentum density is proportional to the Poynting vector which gives the directional rate of energy transfer per unit area:

formula_51

If momentum is to be conserved over the volume over a region , changes in the momentum of matter through the Lorentz force must be balanced by changes in the momentum of the electromagnetic field and outflow of momentum. If is the momentum of all the particles in , and the particles are treated as a continuum, then Newton&#x27;s second law gives

formula_52

The electromagnetic momentum is

formula_53

and the equation for conservation of each component of the momentum is

formula_54

The term on the right is an integral over the surface area of the surface representing momentum flow into and out of the volume, and is a component of the surface normal of . The quantity is called the Maxwell stress tensor, defined as

formula_55 

=====Media=====
The above results are for the &quot;microscopic&quot; Maxwell equations, applicable to electromagnetic forces in a vacuum (or on a very small scale in media). It is more difficult to define momentum density in media because the division into electromagnetic and mechanical is arbitrary. The definition of electromagnetic momentum density is modified to

formula_56

where the H-field is related to the B-field and the magnetization by

formula_57

The electromagnetic stress tensor depends on the properties of the media.

==Non-classical==

===Quantum mechanical===

In quantum mechanics, momentum is defined as a self-adjoint operator on the wave function. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle defines limits on how accurately the momentum and position of a single observable system can be known at once. In quantum mechanics, position and momentum are conjugate variables.

For a single particle described in the position basis the momentum operator can be written as

formula_58

where is the gradient operator, is the reduced Planck constant, and is the imaginary unit. This is a commonly encountered form of the momentum operator, though the momentum operator in other bases can take other forms. For example, in momentum space the momentum operator is represented by the eigenvalue equation

formula_59

where the operator acting on a wave eigenfunction yields that wave function multiplied by the eigenvalue , in an analogous fashion to the way that the position operator acting on a wave function yields that wave function multiplied by the eigenvalue .

For both massive and massless objects, relativistic momentum is related to the phase constant by

formula_60

Electromagnetic radiation (including visible light, ultraviolet light, and radio waves) is carried by photons. Even though photons (the particle aspect of light) have no mass, they still carry momentum. This leads to applications such as the solar sail. The calculation of the momentum of light within dielectric media is somewhat controversial (see Abraham–Minkowski controversy).

===Relativistic===
====Lorentz invariance====
Newtonian physics assumes that absolute time and space exist outside of any observer; this gives rise to Galilean invariance. It also results in a prediction that the speed of light can vary from one reference frame to another. This is contrary to what has been observed. In the special theory of relativity, Einstein keeps the postulate that the equations of motion do not depend on the reference frame, but assumes that the speed of light is invariant. As a result, position and time in two reference frames are related by the Lorentz transformation instead of the Galilean transformation.

Consider, for example, one reference frame moving relative to another at velocity in the direction. The Galilean transformation gives the coordinates of the moving frame as

formula_61

while the Lorentz transformation gives

formula_62

where is the Lorentz factor:

formula_63

Newton&#x27;s second law, with mass fixed, is not invariant under a Lorentz transformation. However, it can be made invariant by making the &quot;inertial mass&quot; of an object a function of velocity:

formula_64

 is the object&#x27;s invariant mass.

The modified momentum,

formula_65

obeys Newton&#x27;s second law:

formula_66

Within the domain of classical mechanics, relativistic momentum closely approximates Newtonian momentum: at low velocity, is approximately equal to , the Newtonian expression for momentum.

====Four-vector formulation====

In the theory of special relativity, physical quantities are expressed in terms of four-vectors that include time as a fourth coordinate along with the three space coordinates. These vectors are generally represented by capital letters, for example for position. The expression for the &quot;four-momentum&quot; depends on how the coordinates are expressed. Time may be given in its normal units or multiplied by the speed of light so that all the components of the four-vector have dimensions of length. If the latter scaling is used, an interval of proper time, , defined by

formula_67

is invariant under Lorentz transformations (in this expression and in what follows the metric signature has been used, different authors use different conventions). Mathematically this invariance can be ensured in one of two ways: by treating the four-vectors as Euclidean vectors and multiplying time by ; or by keeping time a real quantity and embedding the vectors in a Minkowski space. In a Minkowski space, the scalar product of two four-vectors and is defined as

formula_68

In all the coordinate systems, the (contravariant) relativistic four-velocity is defined by

formula_69

and the (contravariant) four-momentum is

formula_70

where is the invariant mass. If (in Minkowski space), then

formula_71

Using Einstein&#x27;s mass–energy equivalence, , this can be rewritten as

formula_72

Thus, conservation of four-momentum is Lorentz-invariant and implies conservation of both mass and energy.

The magnitude of the momentum four-vector is equal to :

formula_73

and is invariant across all reference frames.

The relativistic energy–momentum relationship holds even for massless particles such as photons; by setting it follows that

formula_74

In a game of relativistic &quot;billiards&quot;, if a stationary particle is hit by a moving particle in an elastic collision, the paths formed by the two afterwards will form an acute angle. This is unlike the non-relativistic case where they travel at right angles.

The four-momentum of a planar wave can be related to a wave four-vector

formula_75

For a particle, the relationship between temporal components, , is the Planck–Einstein relation, and the relation between spatial components, , describes a de Broglie matter wave.

== History of the concept ==
=== Impetus ===
==== John Philoponus ====
In about 530 AD, John Philoponus developed a concept of momentum in &quot;On Physics&quot;, a commentary to Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Physics&quot;. Aristotle claimed that everything that is moving must be kept moving by something. For example, a thrown ball must be kept moving by motions of the air. Philoponus pointed out the absurdity in Aristotle&#x27;s claim that motion of an object is promoted by the same air that is resisting its passage. He proposed instead that an impetus was imparted to the object in the act of throwing it.

==== Ibn Sīnā ====

In 1020, Ibn Sīnā (also known by his Latinized name Avicenna) read Philoponus and published his own theory of motion in &quot;The Book of Healing&quot;. He agreed that an impetus is imparted to a projectile by the thrower; but unlike Philoponus, who believed that it was a temporary virtue that would decline even in a vacuum, he viewed it as a persistent, requiring external forces such as air resistance to dissipate it.

==== Peter Olivi, Jean Buridan ====
In the 13th and 14th century, Peter Olivi and Jean Buridan read and refined the work of Philoponus, and possibly that of Ibn Sīnā. Buridan, who in about 1350 was made rector of the University of Paris, referred to impetus being proportional to the weight times the speed. Moreover, Buridan&#x27;s theory was different from his predecessor&#x27;s in that he did not consider impetus to be self-dissipating, asserting that a body would be arrested by the forces of air resistance and gravity which might be opposing its impetus.

=== Quantity of motion ===

==== René Descartes ====
In &quot;Principles of Philosophy&quot; (&quot;Principia Philosophiae&quot;) from 1644, the French philosopher René Descartes defined &quot;quantity of motion&quot; (&quot;Latin: quantitas motus&quot;) as the product of size and speed, and claimed that the total quantity of motion in the universe is conserved.

This should not be read as a statement of the modern law of conservation of momentum, since Descartes had no concept of mass as distinct from weight and size. (The concept of mass, as distinct from weight, was introduced by Newton in 1686.) More important, he believed that it is speed rather than velocity that is conserved. So for Descartes, if a moving object were to bounce off a surface, changing its direction but not its speed, there would be no change in its quantity of motion. Galileo, in his &quot;Two New Sciences&quot; (published in 1638), used the Italian word to similarly describe Descartes&#x27;s quantity of motion.

==== Christiaan Huygens ====

In the 1600s, Christiaan Huygens concluded quite early that Descartes&#x27;s laws for the elastic collision of two bodies must be wrong, and he formulated the correct laws. An important step was his recognition of the Galilean invariance of the problems. His views then took many years to be circulated. He passed them on in person to William Brouncker and Christopher Wren in London, in 1661. What Spinoza wrote to Henry Oldenburg about them, in 1666 during the Second Anglo-Dutch War, was guarded. Huygens had actually worked them out in a manuscript in the period 1652–1656. The war ended in 1667, and Huygens announced his results to the Royal Society in 1668. He published them in the in 1669.

=== Momentum ===

==== John Wallis ====
In 1670, John Wallis, in , stated the law of conservation of momentum: &quot;the initial state of the body, either of rest or of motion, will persist&quot; and &quot;If the force is greater than the resistance, motion will result&quot;. Wallis used &quot;momentum&quot; for quantity of motion, and for force.

==== Gottfried Leibniz ====
In 1686, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, in &quot;Discourse on Metaphysics&quot;, gave an argument against Descartes&#x27; construction of the conservation of the &quot;quantity of motion&quot; using an example of dropping blocks of different sizes different distances. He points out that force is conserved but quantity of motion, construed as the product of size and speed of an object, is not conserved.

==== Isaac Newton ====

In 1687, Isaac Newton, in , just like Wallis, showed a similar casting around for words to use for the mathematical momentum. His Definition II defines , &quot;quantity of motion&quot;, as &quot;arising from the velocity and quantity of matter conjointly&quot;, which identifies it as momentum. Thus when in Law II he refers to , &quot;change of motion&quot;, being proportional to the force impressed, he is generally taken to mean momentum and not motion.

==== John Jennings ====
In 1721, John Jennings published &quot;Miscellanea&quot;, where the momentum in its current mathematical sense is attested, five years before the final edition of Newton&#x27;s . &quot;Momentum&quot; or &quot;quantity of motion&quot; was being defined for students as &quot;a rectangle&quot;, the product of and , where is &quot;quantity of material&quot; and is &quot;velocity&quot;, .

In 1728, the Cyclopedia states:

<text>A mood stabilizer is a psychiatric medication used to treat mood disorders characterized by intense and sustained mood shifts, such as bipolar disorder and the bipolar type of schizoaffective disorder.

==Uses==
Mood stabilizers are best known for the treatment of bipolar disorder, preventing mood shifts to mania (or hypomania) and depression. Mood stabilizers are also used in schizoaffective disorder when it is the bipolar type.

==Examples==
The term &quot;mood stabilizer&quot; does not describe a mechanism, but rather an effect. More precise terminology based on pharmacology is used to further classify these agents. Drugs commonly classed as mood stabilizers include:

===Mineral===
; Lithium
: Lithium is the &quot;classic&quot; mood stabilizer, the first to be approved by the US FDA, and still popular in treatment. Therapeutic drug monitoring is required to ensure lithium levels remain in the therapeutic range: 0.6 to 0.8 or 0.8–1.2 mEq/L (or millimolar). Signs and symptoms of toxicity include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and ataxia. The most common side effects are lethargy and weight gain (up to ). The less common side effects of using lithium are blurred vision, a slight tremble in the hands, and a feeling of being mildly ill. In general, these side effects occur in the first few weeks after commencing lithium treatment. These symptoms can often be improved by lowering the dose.

===Anticonvulsants===
Many agents described as &quot;mood stabilizers&quot; are also categorized as anticonvulsants. The term &quot;anticonvulsant mood stabilizers&quot; is sometimes used to describe these as a class. Although this group is also defined by effect rather than mechanism, there is at least a preliminary understanding of the mechanism of most of the anticonvulsants used in the treatment of mood disorders.

; Valproate
: Available in extended release form. This drug can be very irritating to the stomach, especially when taken as a free acid. Liver function and CBC should be monitored. Common side effects include sleepiness, nausea, dry mouth. More serious side effects include liver dysfunction, pancreatitis and polycystic ovary syndrome. Weight gain is possible.
; Lamotrigine (aka Lamictal)
: FDA approved for bipolar disorder maintenance therapy, not for acute mood problems like depression or mania/hypomania. The usual target dose is 100–200 mg daily, titrated to by 25 mg increments every 2 weeks. Lamotrigine can cause Stevens–Johnson syndrome, a very rare but potentially fatal skin condition.
; Carbamazepine
: FDA approved for the treatment of acute manic or mixed (i.e., both depressed and manic mood features) episodes in people with bipolar disorder type I. Carbamazepine can rarely cause a dangerous decrease in neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, called agranulocytosis. It interacts with many medications, including other mood stabilizers (e.g. lamotrigine) and antipsychotics (e.g. quetiapine). It is considered second-line for bipolar disorder due to its side effects.

There is insufficient evidence to support the use of various other anticonvulsants, such as gabapentin and topiramate, as mood stabilizers.

===Antipsychotics===
Some atypical antipsychotics (aripiprazole, asenapine, cariprazine, lurasidone, olanzapine, paliperidone, quetiapine, risperidone, and ziprasidone) also have mood stabilizing effects and are thus commonly prescribed even when psychotic symptoms are absent.

===Other===
; Omega-3 fatty acids
: It is also conjectured that omega-3 fatty acids may have a mood stabilizing effect. Compared with placebo, omega-3 fatty acids appear better able to augment known mood stabilizers in reducing depressive (but perhaps not manic) symptoms of bipolar disorder; additional trials would be needed to establish the effects of omega-3 fatty acids alone.
; Levothyroxine
: It is known that even subclinical hypothyroidism can blunt a patient&#x27;s response to both mood stabilizers and antidepressants. Furthermore, preliminary research into the use of thyroid augmentation in patients with refractory and rapid-cycling bipolar disorder has been positive, showing a slowing in cycle frequency and reduction in symptoms. Most studies have been conducted on an open-label basis. One large, controlled study of 300 mcg daily dose of levothyroxine (T4) found it superior to placebo for this purpose. In general, studies have shown T4 to be well tolerated and to show efficacy even in patients without overt hypothyroidism. Hypothyrodism is common among bipolar patients regardless of the mood stabilizer used.

===Combination therapy===
In routine practice, monotherapy is often not sufficiently effective for acute and/or maintenance therapy and thus most patients are given combination therapies. Combination therapy (atypical antipsychotic with lithium or valproate) shows better efficacy over monotherapy in the manic phase in terms of efficacy and prevention of relapse. However, side effects are more frequent and discontinuation rates due to adverse events are higher with combination therapy than with monotherapy.

==Relationship to antidepressants==
Most mood stabilizers are primarily antimanic agents, meaning that they are effective at treating mania and mood cycling and shifting, but are not effective at treating acute depression. The principal exceptions to that rule, because they treat both manic and depressive symptoms, are lamotrigine, lithium carbonate, olanzapine and quetiapine. There is a need for caution when treating bipolar patients with antidepressant medication due to the risks that they pose.
Nevertheless, antidepressants are still often prescribed in addition to mood stabilizers during depressive phases. This brings some risks, however, as antidepressants can induce mania (increases risk by 34%), psychosis (relative risk not reported), cycle acceleration, and other disturbing problems in people with bipolar disorder—in particular, when taken alone. The risk of antidepressant-induced mania when given to patients concomitantly on antimanic agents is not known for certain but may still exist. SSRIs and bupropion appear to have lower chances of switching, while SNRIs and tricyclics are more likely to cause switching. A single large, population based study reports that the manic &quot;switch&quot; risk is not increased over regular mood stabilizer treatment when an antidepressant is combined with a mood stabilizer. When an antidepressant is used alone, the risk is about 3 times the regular value. Gitlin (2018) notes that &quot;the potential issue of worsening suicidality in adolescents and young adults treated with antidepressants [...] both controversial and infrequently seen.&quot;

Equally critical is the question of whether adding antidepressant has any effect on bipolar depression. High-quality data is lacking in this field, and simply using different analytical approaches can lead to different conclusions. It&#x27;s also possible that the effect depends on the mood stabilizer used: one study finds no effect when antidepressant is added to lithium or valporate, but some efficacy when it&#x27;s added to atypical antipsychotics.

==Pharmacodynamics==
As mentioned above, &quot;mood stabilizers&quot; do not have a unified mechanism of action; the term simply describes how these drugs can be used.

The precise mechanism of action of lithium is still unknown, and it is suspected that it acts at various points of the neuron between the nucleus and the synapse. Lithium is known to inhibit the enzyme GSK-3B. This improves the functioning of the circadian clock—which is thought to be often malfunctioning in people with bipolar disorder—and positively modulates gene transcription of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). The resulting increase in neural plasticity may be central to lithium&#x27;s therapeutic effects. How lithium works in the human body is not completely understood, but its benefits are most likely related to its effects on electrolytes such as potassium, sodium, calcium and magnesium. Lithium is, broadly speaking, neuroprotective.

The classical theory of valporate&#x27;s action involves affecting GABA levels and blocking voltage-gated sodium channels (which would affect the brain&#x27;s glutamate system). It has since been found to have many other cellular effects, such as inhibiting histone deacetylases and increasing LEF1. It is also neuroprotective.

Carbamazepine is mainly a sodium channel blocker, though it too has other activities. Lamotrigine is a similar case.

One possible downstream target of several mood stabilizers such as lithium, valproate, and carbamazepine is the arachidonic acid cascade.

<text>Mere Christianity is a Christian apologetical book by the British author C. S. Lewis. It was adapted from a series of BBC radio talks made between 1941 and 1944, originally published as three separate volumes: &quot;Broadcast Talks&quot; (1942), &quot;Christian Behaviour&quot; (1943), and &quot;Beyond Personality&quot; (1944). The book consists of four parts: the first presents Lewis&#x27;s arguments for the existence of God; the second contains his defence of Christian theology, including his notable &quot;Liar, lunatic, or Lord&quot; trilemma; the third has him exploring Christian ethics, among which are cardinal and theological virtues; in the final, he writes on the Christian conception of God.

&quot;Mere Christianity&quot; was published in the United Kingdom by Geoffrey Bles on 7 July 1952. While initial reviews to the book were generally positive, modern reviewers were more critical of it, and its overall reception was relatively mixed. The praise was primarily directed to Lewis&#x27;s humorous, straightforward style of writing; the criticism was primarily around the validity of his trilemma, which defends the Christian doctrine of the divinity of Jesus, and how he should have considered providing more choices.

Deemed a classic in Lewis&#x27;s career and religious literature, &quot;Mere Christianity&quot; has often received a wide readership decades following its release, and contributed to establishing its author&#x27;s reputation as &quot;one of the most &#x27;original&#x27; exponents of the Christian faith&quot; in the 20th century. The work, with Lewis&#x27;s arguments for God&#x27;s existence in it, continued to be examined in scholarly circles. &quot;Mere Christianity&quot; has retained popularity among Christians from various denominations, and appeared in several lists of finest Christian books. Often used as a tool of evangelism, it has been translated into over thirty languages, and cited by a number of public figures as their influence to their conversion to Christianity. Several &quot;biographies&quot; of the book have also been written.

== Background ==
After reading Lewis&#x27;s &quot;The Problem of Pain&quot; James Welch, the Director of Religious Broadcasting for the BBC, wrote Lewis the following:I write to ask whether you would be willing to help us in our work of religious broadcasting ... The microphone is a limiting, and rather irritating, instrument, but the quality of thinking and depth of conviction which I find in your book ought sure to be shared with a great many other people. Welch suggested two potential subjects. Lewis responded with thanks and observed that modern literature, the first, did not suit him, choosing instead the Christian faith as Lewis understood it.

In the preface to later editions, Lewis described his desire to avoid contested theological doctrine by focusing on core beliefs of the Christian Faith. 

Every Wednesday from 7:45 pm to 8 pm during August 1941, Lewis gave live talks entitled &quot;Right or Wrong: A Clue to the Meaning of the Universe&quot; which would become the first book in &quot;Mere Christianity&quot;. The first set of talks became very popular and flooded Lewis with responses from an adoring and irate public. This feedback led to Lewis&#x27;s going back on air to answer listeners&#x27; questions.

The following January and February, Lewis gave the next set of talks on what would become &quot;What Christians Believe&quot;. The talks remained popular and because of the success of the newly released &quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot;, Lewis’s publisher was happy to publish the broadcast talks as books that year.

In Autumn 1942, the third series of talks were, ironically, cut down from 15 to 10 minutes. Due to a miscommunication, Lewis had prepared for 15 minutes, but added the cut material back into the next book and added several more chapters.

The fourth set of talks did not take place until 1944. The script drafts had a much wider scope originally, and Lewis prepared for 10-minute talks when the BBC was giving him 15. The timing of these talks was important and strictly adhered to due to technology and World War II, Germany would broadcast propaganda through the English-spoken &quot;Lord Hawhaw&quot; during any dead air. Due to the timing of the fourth set of talks (10:20 pm), Lewis said he could not do them all live and would have to record some.

=== The Case for Christianity (Broadcast Talks in UK) ===

The core of the first section centres on an argument from morality, the basis of which is the &quot;law of human nature&quot;, a &quot;rule about right and wrong,&quot; which, Lewis maintained, is commonly available and known to all human beings. He cites, as an example, the case of Nazi Germany, writing: This law was called the Law of nature because people thought that everyone knew it by nature and did not need to be taught it. They did not mean, of course, that you might not find an odd individual here and there who did not know it, just as you find a few people who are colour-blind or have no ear for a tune. But taking the race as a whole, they thought that the human idea of decent behaviour was obvious to everyone. And I believe they were right. If they were not, then all the things we said about the war were nonsense. What was the sense in saying the enemy were in the wrong unless Right is a real thing which the Nazis at bottom knew as well as we did and ought to have practised? If they had had no notion of what we mean by right, then, though we might still have had to fight them, we could no more have blamed them for that than for the colour of their hair.

On a mundane level, it is generally accepted that stealing is a violation of this moral law. Lewis argues that the moral law is like scientific laws (e.g. gravity) or mathematics in that it was not contrived by humans. However, it is unlike scientific laws in that it can be broken or ignored, and it is known intuitively, rather than through experimentation. After introducing the moral law, Lewis argues that thirst reflects the fact that people naturally need water, and there is no other substance which satisfies that need. Lewis points out that earthly experience does not satisfy the human craving for &quot;joy&quot; and that only God could fit the bill; humans cannot know to yearn for something if it does not exist.

After providing reasons for his conversion to theism, Lewis explicates various conceptions of God. Pantheism, he argues, is incoherent, and atheism too simple. Eventually, he arrives at Jesus Christ, and invokes a well-known argument now known as &quot;Lewis&#x27;s trilemma&quot;. Lewis, arguing that Jesus was claiming to be God, uses logic to advance three possibilities: either he really was God, was deliberately lying, or was not God but thought himself to be (which would make him delusional and likely insane). The book goes on to say that the latter two possibilities are not consistent with Jesus&#x27; character and it was most likely that he was being truthful.

=== Christian Behaviour ===

The next third of the book explores the ethics resulting from Christian belief. He cites the four cardinal virtues: prudence, justice, temperance, and fortitude. After touching on these, he goes into the three theological virtues: hope, faith, and charity. Lewis also explains morality as being composed of three &quot;layers&quot;: relationships between man and man, the motivations and attitudes of the man himself, and contrasting worldviews.

Lewis also covers such topics as social relations and forgiveness, sexual ethics and the tenets of Christian marriage, and the relationship between morality and psychoanalysis. He also writes about &quot;the great sin&quot;: pride, which he argues to be the root cause of all evil and rebellion.

His most important point is that Christianity mandates that one &quot;love your neighbour as yourself.&quot; He points out that all persons unconditionally love themselves. Even if one does not &quot;like&quot; oneself, one would still love oneself. Christians, he writes, must also apply this attitude to others, even if they do not like them. Lewis calls this one of the &quot;great secrets&quot;: when one acts as if he loves others, he will presently come to love them.

== Critical reception ==

Initial reviews of &quot;Mere Christianity&quot; generally show enthusiasm, and most of them were from Christian publications. However, combining them with the reviews published decades later indicated a more mixed reception. The historian Stephanie L. Derrick observed that the book&#x27;s literary elements, such as its eloquence, were the aspect most frequently noted by contemporary publications. The historian George M. Marsden summarised that &quot;Mere Christianity&quot; &quot;has been hated as well as loved. Nonetheless, as a popular presentation of the faith it has drawn less systematic criticism than would a book that purported to be a definitive treatise on Christian apologetics and theology.&quot; On the general reception to the book, the Lewis biographer Margaret Patterson Hannay described it as his &quot;most popular and ... most disparaged&quot; work, adding that &quot;probably because its fans have spoken of it as a profound piece of theology, while it is, as was designed to be, only a primer&quot;.

Describing the book as &quot;a rare gift&quot;, Edward Skillin of the &quot;Commonweal&quot; magazine commented of Lewis&#x27;s ability to make &quot;complicated matters&quot; more accessible especially to laypeople. On a passage of the book, Edward D. Myers of &quot;Theology Today&quot; noted, &quot;This is clear, it is simple, it is eminently Christian, and it is typical of the ease with which Mr. Lewis puts great matters into plain language.&quot; Joseph McSorley of &quot;The Catholic World&quot; found Lewis writing &quot;with his customary clarity and incisiveness, and with proofs that the average man will find convincing. It is a delight to see him demolish in a paragraph many of the heresies which have contributed to our present ghastly condition.&quot; &quot;The Tablet&quot;, a Catholic magazine, wrote:

We have never read arguments better marshalled and handled so that they can be remembered, or any book more useful to the Christian, in the Army or elsewhere, who finds himself called upon to argue briefly from first premises, to say why morality is not herd-instinct, why there is a special and unique character attaching to the sense of obligation, why the conviction that there is a law of right and wrong and a transcendent morality is only intelligible if there is a God.

&quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; wrote of Lewis&#x27;s &quot;quite unique power&quot; of making theology interesting, even &quot;exciting and (one might almost say) uproariously funny&quot;. The reviewer added: &quot;No writer of popular apologetics today is more effective than Mr. C. S. Lewis.&quot; &quot;The Clergy Review&quot; G. D. Smith opined that Lewis &quot;shows himself a master in the rare art of conveying profound truths in simple and compelling language&quot;. J. H. Homes of the &quot;New York Herald Tribune Weekly Book Review&quot; wrote that &quot;his clarity of thought and simplicity of expression have a magic about them which makes plain the most abstruse problems of theological speculation&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; said: &quot;His learning is abundantly seasoned with common sense, his humor and his irony are always at the service of the most serious purposes, and his originality is the offspring of enthusiastically loyal orthodoxy.&quot;

The author Colin Duriez praised it as easy to understand, and the biographer Thomas C. Peters opined that his straightforward language makes the book fit to a wide audience. There had been also criticism, which was primarily directed towards Lewis&#x27;s &quot;Liar, lunatic, or Lord&quot; trilemma. The Lewis biographer and Christian apologist Alister McGrath, while commending the book in general, felt that his trilemma is a weak defence for the doctrine of the divinity of Jesus, calling this the book&#x27;s &quot;most obvious concern&quot;. He wrote his argument is mostly unsupported by the modern biblical scholarship, and argued that others options such as that Jesus was mistaken about his identity should have gotten into consideration of alternatives.

Scathing criticism came from the philosopher John Beversluis, in his book &quot;C. S. Lewis and the Search for Rational Religion&quot; (1985). Beversluis analysed Lewis&#x27;s arguments for Christianity, arriving in the conclusion that each of them is built on faulty logic. He argued that Lewis made his arguments convincing by creating false analogies, with an instance in his trilemma. Beversluis said there are more alternatives in addition to Jesus being a liar or lunatic, one of which is that his disciples misinterpreted his words. The philosopher Victor Reppert replied to Beversluis in &quot;C. S. Lewis&#x27;s Dangerous Idea&quot; (2003), noting that Beversluis was correct in pointing out that many of Lewis&#x27;s arguments are not strictly logical but overestimating the degree to which Lewis rested his case for Christianity on reason alone. Reppert continued that Lewis, in his autobiography, &quot;Surprised by Joy&quot; (1955), realised Christianity rests on far more than solely reason.

== Legacy ==

&quot;Mere Christianity&quot; has been referred to as a classic of Lewis&#x27;s career, as well as of religious literature, particularly in the category of Christian apologetics. Commentators have also seen it as a guide to the basics of the Christian faith and to his theology. The book, along with his arguments for the existence of God, have frequently received academic evaluation, either complimenting or critical. Analysing Lewis&#x27;s books, the Australian archeologist Warwick Ball believed &quot;Mere Christianity&quot; is perhaps his most influential and widely read apologetic work; the American philosopher C. Stephen Evans called his moral argument the &quot;most widely-convincing apologetic argument of the twentieth century&quot;; McGrath considered it &quot;perhaps as outstanding an example of a lucid and intelligent presentation of the rational and moral case for Christian belief as we are ever likely to see&quot;.

&quot;Mere Christianity&quot; has retained popularity years after its publication, and has been compared to other well-known Christian works, including Augustine&#x27;s &quot;The City of God&quot; and G. K. Chesterton&#x27;s &quot;The Everlasting Man&quot; (1925). The BBC journalist Justin Phillips observed that it &quot;continues to transform the lives of those who read it. There is no reason why it won&#x27;t continue to be potent for decades to come.&quot; According to the authors Roger Lancelyn Green and Walter Hooper, its success led to the acknowledgment of Lewis as &quot;one of the most &#x27;original&#x27; exponents of the Christian faith&quot; of the 20th century. The book, Hooper continued, shows Lewis&#x27;s ability of providing a comprehensible guidance of the Christian beliefs/theology to everyone, and &quot;has become synonymous with Lewis&quot;. The academic Bruce L. Edwards noted that it contributes to shaping Lewis&#x27;s reputation as &quot;a witty, articulate proponent of Christianity&quot;. The author Marvin D. Hinten wrote: &quot;When people are asked which C. S. Lewis book has most influenced them spiritually, the most common answer is &quot;Mere Christianity&quot;.&quot;

According to Peters, the book is more popular among Christians of various denominations, including Catholic, Latter-day Saint, Orthodox, and Protestant, but less among non-Christians. It is often used as an evangelistic tool, predominantly in Christian-majority countries, including the United States, where its influence is most felt. Furthermore, its influence is strengthened by the publication of its translations; according to Marsden, it has been translated to about thirty-six languages. In the next decades, &quot;Mere Christianity&quot; is continued to be reprinted and sold by Christian and online booksellers. For instance, soon after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, it was translated into the several native languages of its breakaway states, which was done by Orthodox Christians to rebuild their influence. As of 2010, the book had been in BookScan Religion Bestseller&#x27;s list for 513 weeks, consecutively. There is also a considerable readership in China, with 60,000 copies had been sold there as of 2014.

The book has also been cited by a number of public figures as their influence to their conversion, or re-conversion, to Christianity as well as other Christian denominations. The American geneticist Francis Collins related his story of conversion from atheism in his book, &quot;The Language of God&quot; (2006), and described &quot;Mere Christianity&quot; as having influenced him to embrace Christianity. The American attorney Charles Colson&#x27;s conversion happened after him reading a copy of the book given by his friend, Thomas L. Phillips (the chairman of the board of the Raytheon Company). His story became popular, enhanced by the release of his autobiography in 1976, which was consequently declared the &quot;Year of the Evangelicals&quot; by the &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine. Catholic converts include the British philanthropist Leonard Cheshire, the German economist E. F. Schumacher, the American author Sheldon Vanauken, the American columnist Ross Douthat, the American theologian Peter Kreeft, and the American philosopher Francis J. Beckwith.

&quot;Mere Christianity&quot; has been featured in several lists. It was included in the 2000 book, &quot;100 Christian Books That Changed the Century&quot;, by William J. Petersen and Randy Petersen. In 2000 and 2006, the evangelical magazine &quot;Christianity Today&quot; editorial board included &quot;Mere Christianity&quot; in its &quot;Books of the Century&quot; and &quot;The Top 50 Books That Have Shaped Evangelicals&quot;, respectively. In a 2013 article to &quot;Christianity Today&quot;, McGrath ranked it the first among the five books by Lewis he liked the most. In the same year&#x27;s &quot;The Best Christian Book of All Time Tournament&quot;, run by InterVarsity Christian Fellowship, &quot;Mere Christianity&quot; was voted as the all-time, best Christian book, only after Augustine&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Confessions&quot;. In 2018, &quot;Christianity Today&quot; Greg Cootsona, a writer of the relationship between religion and science, featured it in his &quot;5 Books That Bring Science and Christianity Together&quot; listing.

&quot;Mere Christianity&quot; has influenced other Christian publications, with the scholar Gary L. Tandy noting that it remains the standard for assessing them, mainly the apologetic ones. Subsequent publications with allusion to the book in their titles include N. T. Wright&#x27;s &quot;Simply Christian&quot; (2006) and McGrath&#x27;s &quot;Mere Apologetics&quot; (2012). The American pastor Tim Keller referred to his apologetic &quot;The Reason for God&quot; (2012) as &quot;&quot;Mere Christianity&quot; for dummies&quot;. The bimonthly ecumenical Christian magazine &quot;Touchstone&quot;, which started publication in 1986, is subtitled &quot;A Journal of Mere Christianity&quot;. Paul McCusker&#x27;s &quot;C. S. Lewis &amp; Mere Christianity&quot;, which provides insights to the work in its historical context, was published in 2014; it was praised for being well-researched but was criticised for its factual errors. Another &quot;biography&quot; of the book, &quot;C. S. Lewis&#x27;s Mere Christianity&quot;, written by Marsden, was released in 2016, and received a positive reception from critics, with some criticism to its conclusion.

<text>A mathematical game is a game whose rules, strategies, and outcomes are defined by clear mathematical parameters. Often, such games have simple rules and match procedures, such as tic-tac-toe and dots and boxes. Generally, mathematical games need not be conceptually intricate to involve deeper computational underpinnings. For example, even though the rules of Mancala are relatively basic, the game can be rigorously analyzed through the lens of combinatorial game theory.

Mathematical games differ sharply from mathematical puzzles in that mathematical puzzles require specific mathematical expertise to complete, whereas mathematical games do not require a deep knowledge of mathematics to play. Often, the arithmetic core of mathematical games is not readily apparent to players untrained to note the statistical or mathematical aspects.

Some mathematical games are of deep interest in the field of recreational mathematics.

When studying a game&#x27;s core mathematics, arithmetic theory is generally of higher utility than actively playing or observing the game itself. To analyze a game numerically, it is particularly useful to study the rules of the game insofar as they can yield equations or relevant formulas. This is frequently done to determine winning strategies or to distinguish if the game has a solution.

Additionally, mathematical games can aid children in grasping fundamental concepts such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, enhancing their arithmetic skills in an engaging manner.

== List of games ==

Sometimes it is not immediately obvious that a particular game involves chance. Often a card game is described as &quot;pure strategy&quot; and such, but a game with any sort of random shuffling or face-down dealing of cards should not be considered to be &quot;no chance&quot;. Several abstract strategy games are listed below:

=== Lattice board ===

* Angels and Devils
* Arimaa
* Checkers (English draughts)
**Checkers variants
* Chess
** Chess variants
* Chomp
* Domineering
* Dots and boxes
* Go
** Go variants
*Gomoku
* Hex
* Hexapawn
* L game
*Othello
*Pente
* Philosopher&#x27;s football
* Rhythmomachy
*Tak
* Tic-tac-toe
** Tic-tac-toe variants

=== Non-lattice boards and other games ===

* Graph pebbling
* Hackenbush
* Chopsticks (hand game)
*Mancala
* Nim
* Sim
* Sprouts
* Four fours

=== Chance involved or imperfect information ===
* 24
* Prisoner&#x27;s dilemma

<text>Martin Gardner (October 21, 1914May 22, 2010) was an American popular mathematics and popular science writer with interests also encompassing magic, scientific skepticism, micromagic, philosophy, religion, and literatureespecially the writings of Lewis Carroll, L. Frank Baum, and G. K. Chesterton. He was a leading authority on Lewis Carroll; &quot;The Annotated Alice&quot;, which incorporated the text of Carroll&#x27;s two Alice books, was his most successful work and sold over a million copies. He had a lifelong interest in magic and illusion and in 1999, &quot;MAGIC&quot; magazine named him as one of the &quot;100 Most Influential Magicians of the Twentieth Century&quot;. He was considered the doyen of American puzzlers. He was a prolific and versatile author, publishing more than 100 books.

Gardner was best known for creating and sustaining interest in recreational mathematics—and by extension, mathematics in general—throughout the latter half of the 20th century, principally through his &quot;Mathematical Games&quot; columns. These appeared for twenty-five years in &quot;Scientific American&quot;, and his subsequent books collecting them.

Gardner was one of the foremost anti-pseudoscience polemicists of the 20th century. His 1957 book &quot;Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science&quot; is a seminal work of the skeptical movement. In 1976, he joined with fellow skeptics to found CSICOP, an organization promoting scientific inquiry and the use of reason in examining extraordinary claims.

==Biography==

===Youth and education===
Martin Gardner was born into a prosperous family in Tulsa, Oklahoma, to James Henry Gardner, a petroleum geologist, and his wife, Willie Wilkerson Spiers, a Montessori-trained teacher. His mother taught Martin to read before he started school, reading him &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, and this began a lifelong interest in the Oz books of L. Frank Baum. His fascination with mathematics started in his boyhood when his father gave him a copy of Sam Loyd&#x27;s &quot;Cyclopedia of 5000 Puzzles, Tricks and Conundrums&quot;.
He attended the University of Chicago where he studied history, literature and sciences under their intellectually-stimulating Great Books curriculum and earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in philosophy in 1936. Early jobs included reporter on the &quot;Tulsa Tribune&quot;, writer at the University of Chicago Office of Press Relations, and case worker in Chicago&#x27;s Black Belt for the city&#x27;s Relief Administration. During World War II, he served for four years in the U.S. Navy as a yeoman on board the destroyer escort USS &quot;Pope&quot; in the Atlantic. His ship was still in the Atlantic when the war came to an end with the surrender of Japan in August 1945.

After the war, Gardner returned to the University of Chicago. He attended graduate school for a year there, but he did not earn an advanced degree.

===Early career===
In the late 1940s, Gardner moved to New York City and became a writer and editor at &quot;Humpty Dumpty&quot; magazine, where for eight years, he wrote features and stories for it and several other children&#x27;s magazines. His paper-folding puzzles at that magazine led to his first work at &quot;Scientific American.&quot; For many decades, Gardner, his wife Charlotte, and their two sons, Jim and Tom, lived in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York, where he earned his living as a freelance author, publishing books with several different publishers, and also publishing hundreds of magazine and newspaper articles.

===Middle age===
In 1950, he wrote an article in the &quot;Antioch Review&quot; entitled &quot;The Hermit Scientist&quot;. It was one of Gardner&#x27;s earliest articles about junk science, and in 1952 a much-expanded version became his first published book: &quot;In the Name of Science: An Entertaining Survey of the High Priests and Cultists of Science, Past and Present&quot;. The year 1960 saw the original edition of the best-selling book of his career, &quot;The Annotated Alice&quot;.

In 1957 Gardner started writing a column for &quot;Scientific American&quot; called &quot;Mathematical Games&quot;. It ran for over a quarter century and dealt with the subject of recreational mathematics. The &quot;Mathematical Games&quot; column became the most popular feature of the magazine and was the first thing that many readers turned to. In September 1977 &quot;Scientific American&quot; acknowledged the prestige and popularity of Gardner&#x27;s column by moving it from the back to the very front of the magazine.

===Retirement and death===
In 1979, Gardner left &quot;Scientific American&quot;. He and his wife Charlotte moved to Hendersonville, North Carolina. He continued to write math articles, sending them to &quot;The Mathematical Intelligencer&quot;, &quot;Math Horizons&quot;, &quot;The College Mathematics Journal&quot;, and &quot;Scientific American&quot;. He also revised some of his older books such as &quot;Origami, Eleusis, and the Soma Cube&quot;. Charlotte died in 2000 and in 2004 Gardner returned to Oklahoma, where his son, James Gardner, was a professor of education at the University of Oklahoma in Norman. He died there on May 22, 2010. An autobiography&quot;Undiluted Hocus-Pocus: The Autobiography of Martin Gardner&quot;was published posthumously.

==Mathematical Games column==


The &quot;Mathematical Games&quot; column began with a free-standing article on hexaflexagons which ran in the December 1956 issue of &quot;Scientific American&quot;. Flexagons became a bit of a fad and soon people all over New York City were making them. Gerry Piel, the &quot;SA&quot; publisher at the time, asked Gardner, &quot;Is there enough similar material to this to make a regular feature?&quot; Gardner said he thought so. The January 1957 issue contained his first column, entitled &quot;Mathematical Games&quot;. Almost 300 more columns were to follow.

It ran from 1956 to 1981 with sporadic columns afterwards and was the first introduction of many subjects to a wider audience, notably:

* Flexagons (Dec 1956)
* The Game of Hex (Jul 1957)
* The Soma cube (Sep 1958)
* Squaring the square (Nov 1958)
* The Three Prisoners problem (Oct 1959)
* Polyominoes (Nov 1960)
* The Paradox of the unexpected hanging (Mar 1963)
* Rep-tiles (May 1963)
* The Superellipse (Sep 1965)
* Pentominoes (Oct 1965)
* The mathematical art of M. C. Escher (Apr 1966)
* Fractals and the Koch snowflake curve (Mar 1967)
* Conway&#x27;s Game of Life (Oct 1970)
* Intransitive dice (Dec 1970)
* Newcomb&#x27;s paradox (Jul 1973)
* Tangrams (Aug 1974)
* Penrose tilings (Jan 1977)
* Public-key cryptography (Aug 1977)
* Hofstadter&#x27;s &quot;Godel, Escher, Bach&quot; (Jul 1979)
* The Monster group (Jun 1980)
Gardner had problems learning calculus and never took a mathematics course after high school. While editing &quot;Humpty Dumpty Magazine&quot; he constructed many paper folding puzzles. At a magic show in 1956 fellow magician Royal Vale Heath introduced Gardner to the intricately folded paper shapes known as flexagons and steered him to the four Princeton University professors who had invented and investigated their mathematical properties. The subsequent article Gardner wrote on hexaflexagons led directly to the column.

Gardner&#x27;s son Jim once asked him what was his favorite puzzle, and Gardner answered almost immediately: &quot;The monkey and the coconuts&quot;. It had been the subject of his April 1958 Games column and in 2001 he chose to make it the first chapter of his &quot;best of&quot; collection, &quot;The Colossal Book of Mathematics&quot;.

In the 1980s &quot;Mathematical Games&quot; began to appear only irregularly. Other authors began to share the column, and the June 1986 issue saw the final installment under that title. In 1981, on Gardner&#x27;s retirement from &quot;Scientific American&quot;, the column was replaced by Douglas Hofstadter&#x27;s &quot;Metamagical Themas&quot;, a name that is an anagram of &quot;Mathematical Games&quot;.

Virtually all of the games columns were collected in book form starting in 1959 with &quot;The Scientific American Book of Mathematical Puzzles &amp; Diversions&quot;. Over the next four decades fourteen more books followed. Donald Knuth called them the canonical books.

==Influence==
Martin Gardner had a major impact on mathematics in the second half of the 20th century. His column ran for 25 years and was read avidly by the generation of mathematicians and physicists who grew up in the years 1956 to 1981. His writing inspired, directly or indirectly, many who would go on to careers in mathematics, science, and other related endeavors.

Gardner&#x27;s admirers included such diverse individuals as W. H. Auden, Arthur C. Clarke, Carl Sagan, Isaac Asimov, Richard Dawkins, Stephen Jay Gould, and the entire French literary group known as the Oulipo. Salvador Dalí once sought him out to discuss four-dimensional hypercubes. David Auerbach wrote: &quot;A case can be made, in purely practical terms, for Martin Gardner as one of the most influential writers of the 20th century. His popularizations of science and mathematical games in Scientific American, over the 25 years he wrote for them, might have helped create more young mathematicians and computer scientists than any other single factor prior to the advent of the personal computer.&quot; Colm Mulcahy described him as &quot;without doubt the best friend mathematics ever had.&quot;

Gardner&#x27;s column introduced the public to books such as A K Dewdney’s &quot;Planiverse&quot; and Douglas Hofstadter’s &quot;Gödel, Escher, Bach&quot;. His writing was credited as both broad and deep. Noam Chomsky once wrote, &quot;Martin Gardner&#x27;s contribution to contemporary intellectual culture is uniquein its range, its insight, and understanding of hard questions that matter.&quot; Gardner repeatedly alerted the public (and other mathematicians) to recent discoveries in mathematics–recreational and otherwise. In addition to introducing many first-rate puzzles and topics such as Penrose tiles and Conway&#x27;s Game of Life, he was equally adept at writing columns about traditional mathematical topics such as knot theory, Fibonacci numbers, Pascal&#x27;s triangle, the Möbius strip, transfinite numbers, four-dimensional space, Zeno&#x27;s paradoxes, Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem, and the four-color problem.

Gardner set a new high standard for writing about mathematics. In a 2004 interview he said, &quot;I go up to calculus, and beyond that I don&#x27;t understand any of the papers that are being written. I consider that that was an advantage for the type of column I was doing because I had to understand what I was writing about, and that enabled me to write in such a way that an average reader could understand what I was saying. If you are writing popularly about math, I think it&#x27;s good not to know too much math.&quot; John Horton Conway called him &quot;the most learned man I have ever met.&quot;

== Gardner&#x27;s mathematical grapevine ==
Gardner maintained an extensive network of experts and amateurs with whom he regularly exchanged information and ideas. Doris Schattschneider would later term this circle of collaborators &quot;Gardner&#x27;s mathematical grapevine&quot; or &quot;MG2&quot;.

Gardner&#x27;s role as a hub of this network helped facilitate several introductions that led to further fruitful collaborations. Mathematicians Conway, Berlekamp, and Guy, who met as a result of Gardner&#x27;s influence, would go on to write &quot;Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays&quot;, a foundational book in combinatorial game theory that Gardner subsequently championed. Gardner also introduced Conway to Benoit Mandelbrot because he knew of their mutual interest in Penrose tiles. Gardner&#x27;s network was also responsible for introducing Doris Schattschneider and Marjorie Rice, who worked together to document the newly discovered pentagon tilings.

Gardner credited his network with generating further material for his columns: &quot;When I first started the column, I was not in touch with any mathematicians, and gradually mathematicians who were creative in the field found out about the column and began corresponding with me. So my most interesting columns were columns based on the material I got from them, so I owe them a big debt of gratitude.&quot;

Gardner prepared each of his columns in a painstaking and scholarly fashion and conducted copious correspondence to be sure that everything was fact-checked for mathematical accuracy. Communication was often by postcard or telephone and Gardner kept meticulous notes of everything, typically on index cards. Archives of some of his correspondence stored at Stanford University occupy some 63 linear feet of shelf space. This correspondence led to columns about the rep-tiles and pentominos of Solomon W. Golomb; the space filling curves of Bill Gosper; the aperiodic tiles of Roger Penrose; the Game of Life invented by John H. Conway; the superellipse and the Soma cube of Piet Hein; the trapdoor functions of Diffie, Hellman, and Merkle; the flexagons of Stone, Tuckerman, Feynman, and Tukey; the geometrical delights in a book by H. S. M. Coxeter; the game of Hex invented by Piet Hein and John Nash; Tutte&#x27;s account of squaring the square; and many other topics.

The wide array of mathematicians, physicists, computer scientists, philosophers, magicians, artists, writers, and other influential thinkers who can be counted as part of Gardner&#x27;s mathematical grapevine includes:

==Public key cryptography==

In his August 1977 column, &quot;A new kind of cipher that would take millions of years to break&quot;, Gardner described a new cryptographic system invented by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman. The system, based on trapdoor functions, was known as RSA (after the three researchers) and has become a component of the majority of secure data transmission schemes. Since RSA is a relatively slow algorithm it is not widely used to directly encrypt data. More often, it is used to transmit shared keys for symmetric-key cryptography.

Gardner identified the memorandum that his column was based on and invited readers to write to Rivest to request a copy of it. Over seven thousand requests came pouring in, some of them from other countries. This caused significant consternation in the US defense agencies and possible legal problems for Gardner himself. The National Security Agency (NSA) asked the RSA team to stop distributing the report and one letter to the IEEE suggested that disseminating such information might be violating the Arms Export Control Act and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations. In the end the defense establishment could provide no legal basis for suppressing the new technology, and when a detailed paper about RSA was published in &quot;Communications of the ACM&quot;, the NSA’s crypto monopoly was effectively terminated.

==Pseudoscience and skepticism==

Gardner was a critic of fringe science. His book &quot;Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science&quot; (1952, revised 1957) launched the modern skeptical movement. It debunked dubious movements and theories including Fletcherism, Lamarckism, food faddism, Dowsing Rods, Charles Fort, Rudolf Steiner, Dianetics, the Bates method for improving eyesight, Einstein deniers, the Flat Earth theory, the lost continents of Atlantis and Lemuria, Immanuel Velikovsky&#x27;s Worlds in Collision, the reincarnation of Bridey Murphy, Wilhelm Reich&#x27;s orgone theory, the spontaneous generation of life, extra-sensory perception and psychokinesis, homeopathy, phrenology, palmistry, graphology, and numerology. This book and his subsequent efforts (&quot;Science: Good, Bad and Bogus&quot;, 1981; &quot;Order and Surprise&quot;, 1983, &quot;Gardner&#x27;s Whys &amp; Wherefores&quot;, 1989, etc.) provoked a lot of criticism from the advocates of alternative science and New Age philosophy. He kept up running dialogues (both public and private) with many of them for decades.

In a review of &quot;Science: Good, Bad and Bogus&quot;, Stephen Jay Gould called Gardner &quot;The Quack Detector&quot;, a writer who &quot;expunge[d] nonsense&quot; and in so doing had &quot;become a priceless national resource.&quot; In 1976 Gardner joined with fellow skeptics philosopher Paul Kurtz, psychologist Ray Hyman, sociologist Marcello Truzzi, and stage magician James Randi to found the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (now called the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry). Intellectuals including astronomer Carl Sagan, author and biochemist Isaac Asimov, psychologist B. F. Skinner, and journalist Philip J. Klass became fellows of the program. From 1983 to 2002 he wrote a monthly column called &quot;Notes of a Fringe Watcher&quot; (originally &quot;Notes of a Psi-Watcher&quot;) for &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot;, that organization&#x27;s monthly magazine. These columns have been collected in five books starting with &quot;The New Age: Notes of a Fringe Watcher&quot; in 1988.

Gardner was a critic of self-proclaimed Israeli psychic Uri Geller and wrote two satirical booklets about him in the 1970s using the pen name &quot;Uriah Fuller&quot; in which he explained how such purported psychics do their seemingly impossible feats such as mentally bending spoons and reading minds.

Martin Gardner continued to criticize junk science throughout his life. His targets included not just safe subjects like astrology and UFO sightings, but more vigorously defended topics such as chiropractic, vegetarianism, creationism, Scientology, the Laffer Curve, and Christian Science. His final work, written just a month before his death in 2010, was an article excoriating the &quot;dubious medical opinions and bogus science&quot; of Oprah Winfreyparticularly her support for the thoroughly discredited theory that vaccinations cause autism; it went on to bemoan the &quot;needless deaths of children&quot; that such notions are likely to cause.

&quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; named him one of the Ten Outstanding Skeptics of the Twentieth Century. In 2010 he was posthumously honored with an award for his contributions in the skeptical field from the Independent Investigations Group. In 1982 the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry awarded Gardner its &quot;In Praise of Reason Award&quot; for his &quot;heroic efforts in defense of reason and the dignity of the skeptical attitude&quot;, and in 2011 it added Gardner to its Pantheon of Skeptics.

==Magic==
Martin Gardner held a lifelong fascination with magic and illusion that began when his father demonstrated a trick to him. He wrote for a magic magazine in high school and worked in a department store demonstrating magic tricks while he was at the University of Chicago. Gardner&#x27;s first published writing (at the age of fifteen) was a magic trick in &quot;The Sphinx&quot;, the official magazine of the Society of American Magicians. He focused mainly on micromagic (table or close-up magic) and, from the 1930s on, published a significant number of original contributions to this secretive field. Magician Joe M. Turner said, &quot;The Encyclopedia of Impromptu Magic&quot;, which Gardner wrote in 1985, &quot;is guaranteed to show up in any poll of magicians&#x27; favorite magic books.&quot; His first magic book for the general public, &quot;Mathematics, Magic and Mystery&quot; (Dover, 1956), is still considered a classic in the field. He was well known for his innovative tapping and spelling effects, with and without playing cards, and was most proud of the effect he called the &quot;Wink Change&quot;.

Many of Gardner&#x27;s lifelong friends were magicians. These included William Simon who introduced Gardner to Charlotte Greenwald, whom he married in 1952, Dai Vernon, Jerry Andrus, statistician Persi Diaconis, and polymath Raymond Smullyan. Gardner considered fellow magician James Randi his closest friend. Diaconis and Smullyan like Gardner straddled the two worlds of mathematics and magic. Mathematics and magic were frequently intertwined in Gardner&#x27;s work. One of his earliest books, &quot;Mathematics, Magic and Mystery&quot; (1956), was about mathematically based magic tricks. Mathematical magic tricks were often featured in his &quot;Mathematical Games&quot; column–for example, his August 1962 column was titled &quot;A variety of diverting tricks collected at a fictitious convention of magicians.&quot; From 1998 to 2002 he wrote a monthly column on magic tricks called &quot;Trick of the Month&quot; in The Physics Teacher, a journal published by the American Association of Physics Teachers.

In 1999 &quot;Magic magazine&quot; named Gardner one of the &quot;100 Most Influential Magicians of the Twentieth Century&quot;. In 2005 he received a &#x27;Lifetime Achievement Fellowship&#x27; from the Academy of Magical Arts. The last work to be published during his lifetime was a magic trick in the May 2010 issue of &quot;Word Ways: The Journal of Recreational Linguistics&quot;.

==Theism and religion==
Gardner was raised as a Methodist—his mother was very religious—but rejected established religion as an adult. He considered himself a philosophical theist and a fideist. He believed in a personal God, in an afterlife, and prayer, but rejected established religion. Nevertheless, he had an abiding fascination with religious belief. In his autobiography, he stated: &quot;When many of my fans discovered that I believed in God and even hoped for an afterlife, they were shocked and dismayed ... I do not mean the God of the Bible, especially the God of the Old Testament, or any other book that claims to be divinely inspired. For me God is a &quot;Wholly Other&quot; transcendent intelligence, impossible for us to understand. He or she is somehow responsible for our universe and capable of providing, how I have no inkling, an afterlife.&quot;

Gardner described his own belief as philosophical theism inspired by the works of philosopher Miguel de Unamuno. While eschewing systematic religious doctrine, he retained a belief in God, asserting that reason or science cannot confirm or confirm this belief. At the same time, he was skeptical of claims that any god has communicated with human beings through spoken or telepathic revelation or through miracles in the natural world. Gardner has been quoted as saying that he regarded parapsychology and other research into the paranormal as tantamount to &quot;tempting God&quot; and seeking &quot;signs and wonders&quot;. He stated that while he would expect tests on the efficacy of prayers to be negative, he would not rule out &quot;a priori&quot; the possibility that unknown paranormal forces may allow prayers to influence the physical world.

Gardner wrote repeatedly about what public figures such as Robert Maynard Hutchins, Mortimer Adler, and William F. Buckley, Jr. believed and whether their beliefs were logically consistent. He sometimes attacked prominent religious figures such as Mary Baker Eddy because their claims were unsupportable. His semi-autobiographical novel &quot;The Flight of Peter Fromm&quot; depicts a traditionally Protestant Christian struggling with his faith, examining 20th-century scholarship and intellectual movements and ultimately rejecting Christianity while remaining a theist.

Gardner said that he suspected that the fundamental nature of human consciousness may not be knowable or discoverable unless perhaps a physics more profound than (&quot;underlying&quot;) quantum mechanics is someday developed. In this regard, he said, he belonged to &quot;a group of thinkers known as the &#x27;mysterians&#x27;.&quot; His philosophical views, in general, are described and defended in his book &quot;The Whys of a Philosophical Scrivener&quot; (1983, revised 1999).

==Annotated works==
Gardner was considered a leading authority on Lewis Carroll. His annotated version of &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; and &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot;, explaining the many mathematical riddles, wordplay, and literary references found in the Alice books, was first published as &quot;The Annotated Alice&quot; (Clarkson Potter, 1960). Sequels were published with new annotations as &quot;More Annotated Alice&quot; (Random House, 1990), and finally as &quot;The Annotated Alice: The Definitive Edition&quot; (Norton, 1999), combining notes from the earlier editions and new material. The original book arose when Gardner found the Alice books &quot;sort of frightening&quot; when he was young, but found them fascinating as an adult. He felt that someone ought to annotate them, and suggested to a publisher that Bertrand Russell be asked; when the publisher was unable to get past Russell&#x27;s secretary, Gardner was asked to take on the project himself.

There had long been annotated books written by scholars for other scholars, but Gardner was the first to write such a work for the general public, and soon many other writers followed his lead. Gardner himself went on to produce annotated editions of G. K. Chesterton&#x27;s &quot;The Innocence Of Father Brown&quot; and &quot;The Man Who Was Thursday&quot;, as well as of celebrated poems including &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot;, &quot;Casey at the Bat&quot;, &quot;The Night Before Christmas&quot;, and &quot;The Hunting of the Snark&quot;.

==Novels and short stories==
Gardner wrote two novels. He was a fan of the Oz books written by L. Frank Baum, and in 1988 he published &quot;Visitors from Oz&quot;, based on the characters in Baum&#x27;s various Oz books. Gardner was a founding member of the International Wizard of Oz Club, and winner of its 1971 L. Frank Baum Memorial Award. His other novel was &quot;The Flight of Peter Fromm&quot; (1973), which reflected his lifelong fascination with religious belief and the problem of faith.

His short stories were collected in &quot;The No-Sided Professor and Other Tales of Fantasy, Humor, Mystery, and Philosophy&quot; (1987).

==Autobiography==
At the age of 95 Gardner wrote &quot;Undiluted Hocus-Pocus: The Autobiography of Martin Gardner&quot;. He was living in a one-room apartment in Norman, Oklahoma and, as was his custom, wrote it on a typewriter and edited it using scissors and rubber cement. He took the title from a poem, a so-called grook, by his good friend Piet Hein, which perfectly expresses Gardner&#x27;s abiding sense of mystery and wonder about existence.
==Word play==
Gardner&#x27;s interest in wordplay led him to conceive of a magazine on recreational linguistics. In 1967 he pitched the idea to Greenwood Periodicals and nominated Dmitri Borgmann as editor. The resulting journal, &quot;Word Ways&quot;, carried many of his articles—some of them posthumously—until publication ceased in 2020. He also wrote a &quot;Puzzle Tale&quot; column for &quot;Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction&quot; magazine from 1977 to 1986. Gardner was a member of the all-male literary banqueting club the Trap Door Spiders, which served as the basis of Isaac Asimov&#x27;s fictional group of mystery solvers, the Black Widowers.

==Pen names==
Gardner often used pen names. In 1952, while working for the children&#x27;s magazine &quot;Humpty Dumpty&quot;, he contributed stories written by &quot;Humpty Dumpty Jnr&quot;. For several years starting in 1953 he was a managing editor of &quot;Polly Pigtails&quot;, a magazine for young girls, and also wrote under that name. His &quot;Annotated Casey at the Bat&quot; (1967) included a parody of the poem, attributed to &quot;Nitram Rendrag&quot; (his name spelled backwards). Using the pen name &quot;Uriah Fuller&quot;, he wrote two books attacking the alleged psychic Uri Geller. In later years, Gardner often wrote parodies of his favorite poems under the name &quot;Armand T. Ringer&quot;, an anagram of his name. In 1983 one George Groth panned Gardner&#x27;s book &quot;The Whys of a Philosophical Scrivener&quot; in the &quot;New York Review of Books&quot;. Only in the last line of the review was it revealed that George Groth was Martin Gardner himself.

In his January 1960 &quot;Mathematical Games&quot; column, Gardner introduced the fictitious &quot;Dr. Matrix&quot; and wrote about him often over the next two decades. Dr. Matrix was not exactly a pen name, although Gardner did pretend that everything in these columns came from the fertile mind of the good doctor. Then in 1979 Dr. Matrix himself published an article in the quite respectable &quot;Two-Year College Mathematics Journal&quot;. It was called &quot;Martin Gardner: Defending the Honor of the Human Mind&quot; and contained a biography of Gardner and a history of his &quot;Mathematical Games&quot; column. It would be a further decade before Martin published an article in such a mathematics journal under his own name.

==Philosophy of mathematics==
Gardner wrote on the philosophy of mathematics. He wrote negative reviews of &quot;The Mathematical Experience&quot; by Philip J. Davis and Reuben Hersh and &quot;What Is Mathematics, Really?&quot; by Hersh, both of which were critical of aspects of mathematical Platonism, and the first of which was well received by the mathematical community. While Gardner was often perceived as a hard-core Platonist, his reviews demonstrated some formalist tendencies. Gardner maintained that his views are widespread among mathematicians, but Hersh has countered that in his experience as a professional mathematician and speaker, this is not the case.

==Mathematics education==
In the August 1998 edition of Scientific American, Gardner wrote his final piece for Scientific American titled, &quot;A Quarter Century of Recreational Mathematics.&quot;  In it he wrote,

He recalls how as a young boy a math teacher had scolded him for working on a bit of recreational mathematics and laments at how wrongheaded this attitude is. He notes that the magazine &quot;Mathematics Teacher&quot; published by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, and specially dedicated to improving mathematics instruction for grades 8–14, often has articles on recreational topics but that most teachers do not use them.

Martin Gardner was also frustrated by the fact that the history curriculum rarely featured scientists and mathematicians. In a New York Times review of Stanislaw Ulam&#x27;s autobiographical book, &quot;Adventures Of a Mathematician&quot;, he said,

==Legacy and awards==
The numerous awards Gardner received include:
* 1987 – Leroy P. Steele Prize for his many books and articles on mathematics
* 1971 – L. Frank Baum Memorial Award from the International Wizard of Oz Club
* 1980 – The main-belt asteroid &quot;2587 Gardner&quot; discovered by Edward L. G. Bowell at Anderson Mesa Station is named after Martin Gardner.
* 1990 – Allendoerfer Award (along with Fan Chung &amp; Ronald Graham) from The Mathematical Association of America (MAA)
* 1994 – JPBM Communications Award from the Joint Policy Board for Mathematics
* 1997 – became a Fellow (Class: Humanities and Arts, Section: Literature) of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
* 1998 – Trevor Evans Award from the MAA
* 1999 – listed in the &quot;100 Most Influential Magicians of the Twentieth Century&quot; by Magic magazine.
* 2011 – Houdini Hall of Honor award (posthumous) from the Independent Investigations Group

The Mathematical Association of America has established a Martin Gardner Lecture to be given each year on the last day of MAA MathFest, the summer meeting of the MAA. The first annual lecture, &quot;Recreational Mathematics and Computer Science: Martin Gardner&#x27;s Influence on Research&quot;, was given by Erik Demaine of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on Saturday, August 3, 2019, at MathFest in Cincinnati. The 2021 lecture &quot;Surprising discoveries of three amateur mathematicians: M.C. Escher, Marjorie Rice, and Rinus Roelofs&quot; was virtual and was given by Doris Schattschneider.

There are eight bricks honoring Gardner in the Paul R. Halmos Commemorative Walk, installed by The Mathematical Association of America (MAA) at their Conference Center in Washington, D.C. Gardner has an Erdős number of 1.

==Gathering 4 Gardner==

Martin Gardner continued to write up until his death in 2010, and his community of fans grew to span several generations. Moreover, his influence was so broad that many of his fans had little or no contact with each other. This led Atlanta entrepreneur and puzzle collector Tom Rodgers to the idea of hosting a weekend gathering celebrating Gardner&#x27;s contributions to recreational mathematics, rationality, magic, puzzles, literature, and philosophy. Although Gardner was famously shy, and would usually decline an honor if it required him to make a personal appearance, Rogers persuaded him to attend the first such &quot;Gathering 4 Gardner&quot; (G4G), held in Atlanta in January 1993.

A second such get-together was held in 1996, again with Gardner in attendance. A video was made for the CBC Television program &quot;The Nature of Things with David Suzuki&quot;. It featured Gardner along with many members of his circle and was called &quot;Martin Gardner: Mathemagician&quot; and broadcast on March 14, 1996. At this point Rogers and his friends decided to make the gathering a regular, bi-annual event. Participants over the years have ranged from long-time Gardner friends such as John Horton Conway, Elwyn Berlekamp, Ronald Graham, Donald Coxeter, and Richard K. Guy, to newcomers like mathematician and mathematical artist Erik Demaine, mathematical video maker Vi Hart, and Fields Medalist Manjul Bhargava.

The attendees at G4G include magicians, mathematicians, jugglers, philosophers, scientific skeptics, fans of Lewis Carroll, puzzle collectors, fans of Conway&#x27;s game of life, Rubic&#x27;s cubers, chess masters, and any other topic that Gardner was interested in or had written about.

The first gathering in 1993 was G4G1 and the 1996 event was G4G2. Since then it has been in even-numbered years. The 2018 event was G4G13. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the G4G14 event was not held until 2022. Two years later G4G15 took place. All G4Gs up to 2024 have been in Atlanta.

==Bibliography==
In a publishing career spanning 80 years (1930–2010), Gardner authored or edited over 100 books and countless articles, columns and reviews. A comprehensive bibliography of his works was published in 2023 by Dana Richards, with a foreword by Donald Knuth.

He was a frequent contributor to &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;.

All Gardner&#x27;s works were non-fiction except for two novels&quot;The Flight of Peter Fromm&quot; (1973) and &quot;Visitors from Oz&quot; (1998)and two collections of short pieces&quot;The Magic Numbers of Dr. Matrix&quot; (1967, 1985) and &quot;The No-Sided Professor&quot; (1987).

<text>MIDI time code (MTC) embeds the same timing information as standard SMPTE timecode as a series of small &#x27;quarter-frame&#x27; MIDI messages. There is no provision for the user bits in the standard MIDI time code messages, and SysEx messages are used to carry this information instead. The quarter-frame messages are transmitted in a sequence of eight messages, thus a complete timecode value is specified every two frames. If the MIDI data stream is running close to capacity, the MTC data may arrive a little behind schedule which has the effect of introducing a small amount of jitter. In order to avoid this it is ideal to use a completely separate MIDI port for MTC data. Larger full-frame messages, which encapsulate a frame worth of timecode in a single message, are used to locate to a time while timecode is not running. 

Unlike standard SMPTE timecode, MIDI timecode&#x27;s quarter-frame, and full-frame messages carry a two-bit flag value that identifies the rate of the timecode, specifying it as either:
* 24 frame/s (standard rate for film work) 
* 25 frame/s (standard rate for PAL video)
* 29.97 frame/s (drop-frame timecode for NTSC video)
* 30 frame/s (non-drop timecode for NTSC video) 

MTC distinguishes between film speed and video speed only by the rate at which timecode advances, not by the information contained in the timecode messages; thus, 29.97 frame/s dropframe is represented as 30 frame/s dropframe at 0.1% pulldown. 

MTC allows the synchronisation of a sequencer or DAW with other devices that can synchronise to MTC or for these devices to &#x27;slave&#x27; to a tape machine that is striped with SMPTE. For this to happen a SMPTE to MTC converter needs to be employed. It is possible for a tape machine to synchronise to an MTC signal (if converted to SMPTE) if the tape machine is able to &#x27;slave&#x27; to incoming timecode via motor control, which is a rare feature.

==Time code format==
The MIDI time code is 32 bits long, of which 24 are used, while 8 bits are unused and always zero. Because the full-time code messages require that the most significant bits of each byte are zero (valid MIDI data bytes), there are really only 28 available bits and 4 spare bits.

Like most audiovisual timecodes such as SMPTE time code, it encodes only time of day, repeating each 24 hours. Time is given in units of hours, minutes, seconds, and frames. There may be 24, 25, or 30 frames per second.

Unlike most other timecodes, the components are encoded in straight binary, not binary-coded decimal.

Each component is assigned one byte:
; Byte 0 : codice_1: Rate (0–3) and hour (0–23).
:* codice_2: 24 frames/s
:* codice_3: 25 frames/s
:* codice_4: 29.97 frames/s (SMPTE drop-frame timecode)
:* codice_5: 30 frames/s
; Byte 1 : codice_6: Minute (0–59)
; Byte 2 : codice_7: Second (0–59)
; Byte 3 : codice_8: Frame (0–29, or less at lower frame rates)

=== Full time code ===
When there is a jump in the time code, a single full-time code is sent to synchronize attached equipment. This takes the form of a special global system exclusive message:
: codice_9
The manufacturer ID of codice_10 indicates a real-time universal message, the channel of codice_10 indicates it is a global broadcast. The following ID of codice_12 identifies this is a time code type message, and the second codice_12 indicates it is a full-time code message. The 4 bytes of time code follow. Although MIDI is generally little-endian, the 4 time code bytes follow in big-endian order, followed by a codice_14 &quot;end of exclusive&quot; byte.

After a jump, the time clock stops until the first following quarter-frame message is received.

=== Quarter-frame messages ===
When the time is running continuously, the 32-bit time code is broken into 8 4-bit pieces, and one piece is transmitted each quarter frame. I.e. 96—120 times per second, depending on the frame rate. Since it takes eight quarter frames for a complete time code message, the complete SMPTE time is updated every two frames. A quarter-frame message consists of a status byte of 0xF1, followed by a single 7-bit data value: 3 bits to identify the piece, and 4 bits of partial time code. When time is running forward, the piece numbers increment from 0–7; with the time that piece 0 is transmitted is the coded instant, and the remaining pieces are transmitted later.

If the MIDI data stream is being rewound, the piece numbers count backward. Again, piece 0 is transmitted at the coded moment.

The time code is divided little-endian as follows:

<doc id="20437" wikidata="Q909534" url="?curid=20437" title="Mass transfer">
<text>Mass transfer is the net movement of mass from one location (usually meaning stream, phase, fraction, or component) to another. Mass transfer occurs in many processes, such as absorption, evaporation, drying, precipitation, membrane filtration, and distillation. Mass transfer is used by different scientific disciplines for different processes and mechanisms. The phrase is commonly used in engineering for physical processes that involve diffusive and convective transport of chemical species within physical systems.

Some common examples of mass transfer processes are the evaporation of water from a pond to the atmosphere, the purification of blood in the kidneys and liver, and the distillation of alcohol. In industrial processes, mass transfer operations include separation of chemical components in distillation columns, absorbers such as scrubbers or stripping, adsorbers such as activated carbon beds, and liquid-liquid extraction. Mass transfer is often coupled to additional transport processes, for instance in industrial cooling towers. These towers couple heat transfer to mass transfer by allowing hot water to flow in contact with air. The water is cooled by expelling some of its content in the form of water vapour.

==Astrophysics==

In astrophysics, mass transfer is the process by which matter gravitationally bound to a body, usually a star, fills its Roche lobe and becomes gravitationally bound to a second body, usually a compact object (white dwarf, neutron star or black hole), and is eventually accreted onto it. It is a common phenomenon in binary systems, and may play an important role in some types of supernovae and pulsars.

==Chemical engineering==

Mass transfer finds extensive application in chemical engineering problems. It is used in reaction engineering, separations engineering, heat transfer engineering, and many other sub-disciplines of chemical engineering like electrochemical engineering.

The driving force for mass transfer is usually a difference in chemical potential, when it can be defined, though other thermodynamic gradients may couple to the flow of mass and drive it as well. A chemical species moves from areas of high chemical potential to areas of low chemical potential. Thus, the maximum theoretical extent of a given mass transfer is typically determined by the point at which the chemical potential is uniform. For single phase-systems, this usually translates to uniform concentration throughout the phase, while for multiphase systems chemical species will often prefer one phase over the others and reach a uniform chemical potential only when most of the chemical species has been absorbed into the preferred phase, as in liquid-liquid extraction.

While thermodynamic equilibrium determines the theoretical extent of a given mass transfer operation, the actual rate of mass transfer will depend on additional factors including the flow patterns within the system and the diffusivities of the species in each phase. This rate can be quantified through the calculation and application of mass transfer coefficients for an overall process. These mass transfer coefficients are typically published in terms of dimensionless numbers, often including Péclet numbers, Reynolds numbers, Sherwood numbers, and Schmidt numbers, among others.

==Analogies between heat, mass, and momentum transfer==

There are notable similarities in the commonly used approximate differential equations for momentum, heat, and mass transfer. The molecular transfer equations of Newton&#x27;s law for fluid momentum at low Reynolds number (Stokes flow), Fourier&#x27;s law for heat, and Fick&#x27;s law for mass are very similar, since they are all linear approximations to transport of conserved quantities in a flow field. 
At higher Reynolds number, the analogy between mass and heat transfer and momentum transfer becomes less useful due to the nonlinearity of the Navier–Stokes equation (or more fundamentally, the general momentum conservation equation), but the analogy between heat and mass transfer remains good. A great deal of effort has been devoted to developing analogies among these three transport processes so as to allow prediction of one from any of the others.

<doc id="20448" wikidata="Q1954749" url="?curid=20448" title="Museum of Jurassic Technology">
<text>The Museum of Jurassic Technology at 9341 Venice Boulevard in the Palms district of Los Angeles, California, was founded by David Hildebrand Wilson and Diana Drake Wilson in 1988. It calls itself &quot;an educational institution dedicated to the advancement of knowledge and the public appreciation of the Lower Jurassic&quot;, the relevance of the term &quot;Lower Jurassic&quot; to the museum&#x27;s collections being left uncertain and unexplained.

The museum&#x27;s collection includes a mixture of artistic, scientific, ethnographic, and historic items, as well as some unclassifiable exhibits; the diversity evokes the cabinets of curiosities that were the 16th-century predecessors of modern natural-history museums. The factual claims of many of the museum&#x27;s exhibits strain credibility, provoking an array of interpretations.

David Hildebrand Wilson received a MacArthur Foundation fellowship in 2001.

==Overview==
The museum contains an unusual collection of exhibits and objects with varying and uncertain degrees of authenticity. &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Edward Rothstein described it as a &quot;museum about museums&quot;, &quot;where the persistent question is: what kind of place is this?&quot; &quot;Smithsonian&quot; magazine called it &quot;a witty, self-conscious homage to private museums of yore . . . when natural history was only barely charted by science, and museums were closer to Renaissance cabinets of curiosity.&quot; In a similar vein, &quot;The Economist&quot; said the museum &quot;captures a time chronicled in Richard Holmes&#x27;s recent book &quot;The Age of Wonder&quot;, when science mingled with poetry in its pursuit of answers to life&#x27;s mysterious questions.&quot;

Lawrence Weschler&#x27;s 1995 book, &quot;Mr. Wilson&#x27;s Cabinet of Wonder: Pronged Ants, Horned Humans, Mice on Toast, And Other Marvels of Jurassic Technology&quot;, attempts to explain the mystery of the Museum of Jurassic Technology. Weschler deeply explores the museum through conversations with its founder, David Wilson, and through outside research on several exhibitions. His investigations into the history of certain exhibits led to varying results of authenticity; some exhibits seem to have been created by Wilson&#x27;s imagination while other exhibits might be suitable for display in a natural history museum. The Museum of Jurassic Technology at its heart, according to Wilson, is &quot;a museum interested in presenting phenomena that other natural history museums are unwilling to present.&quot;

The museum&#x27;s introductory slideshow recounts that &quot;In its original sense, the term, &#x27;museum&#x27; meant &#x27;a spot dedicated to the Muses, a place where man&#x27;s mind could attain a mood of aloofness above everyday affairs&#x27;&quot;. In this spirit, the dimly lit atmosphere, wood and glass vitrines, and labyrinthine floorplan lead visitors through an eclectic range of exhibits on art, natural history, history of science, philosophy, and anthropology, with a special focus on the history of museums and the variety of paths to knowledge. The museum attracts approximately 25,000 visitors per year.

==Exhibits==
The museum maintains more than thirty permanent exhibits, including:
*The Delani/Sonnabend Halls: Recalling the intertwining story of an ill-fated opera singer, Madalena Delani, with a theoretician of memory, Geoffrey Sonnabend, whose three-part work &quot;Obliscence: Theories of Forgetting and the Problem of Matter&quot; suggests that memory is an elaborate construction that humankind has created &quot;to buffer ourselves against the intolerable knowledge of the irreversible passage of time and the irretrievability of its moments and events.&quot; There is only experience and the decay of experience, an idea he illustrates with a complex diagram of a plane intersecting a cone.
*Tell the Bees: Belief, Knowledge, and Hypersymbolic Cognition: An exhibit of pre-scientific cures and remedies
*The Garden of Eden on Wheels: Collections from Los Angeles Area Trailer Parks
*The Unique World of Microminiatures of Hagop Sandaldjian: A collection of micro-miniature sculptures, each carved from a single human hair and placed within the eye of a needle. Currently on display: Goofy, Pope John Paul II, and Napoleon I. Other microminiatures include violins; dancers; a crucifix (made of a single strand of the artist&#x27;s hair and gold); characters like Donald Duck, Pinocchio, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs; a self-portrait; a golf player; and a baseball player swinging his bat.
*Micromosaics of Harold &quot;Henry&quot; Dalton: Microscopic mosaics from the 19th century depicting flowers, animals, and other objects, made entirely from individual butterfly wing scales and diatoms
*The Stereofloral Radiographs of Albert G. Richards: A collection of stereographic radiographs of flowers
*Rotten Luck: The Decaying Dice of Ricky Jay: A collection of decomposing antique dice once owned by magician Ricky Jay and documented in his book &quot;Dice: Deception, Fate, and Rotten Luck&quot;
*No One May Ever Have the Same Knowledge Again: Letters to Mt. Wilson Observatory : A small room dedicated to unusual letters and theories received by the Mount Wilson Observatory circa 1915–1935
*The World is Bound with Secret Knots: The Life and Works of Athanasius Kircher: A survey of the fields of study, writings and inventions of the 17th-century Jesuit polymath who was the founder of the Kircherian Museum in Rome
*The Lives of Perfect Creatures: The Dogs of the Soviet Space Program: An oil portrait gallery of the heroic cosmonaut canines
*Fairly Safely Venture: String Figures from Many Lands and their Venerable Collectors

From 1992 to 2006, the museum&#x27;s Foundation Collection was on display in its Tochtermuseum at the Karl Ernst Osthaus-Museum in Hagen, Germany. This exhibition was part of the Museum of Museums wing at the KEOM, which came into being under the stewardship of director Michael Fehr.

==Auxiliary functions==

In 2005, the museum opened its Tula Tea Room, a Russian-style tea room where Georgian tea and accompanying cookies are served, the cost covered by the price of admission. This room is a miniature reconstruction of the study of Tsar Nicolas II from the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg, Russia. The tea room is shared with a number of live doves and other birds.

The Borzoi Kabinet Theater screens a series of poetic documentaries produced by the Museum of Jurassic Technology in collaboration with the St. Petersburg–based arts and science collective Kabinet. The series of films, entitled &quot;A Chain of Flowers&quot;, draws its name from the quotation by Charles Willson Peale: &quot;The Learner must be led always from familiar objects toward the unfamiliar, guided along, as it were, a chain of flowers into the mysteries of life&quot;. The titles of the films are &quot;Levsha: The Cross-eyed Lefty from Tula and the Steel Flea&quot; (2001), &quot;Obshee Delo: The Common Task&quot; (2005), &quot;Bol&#x27;shoe Sovietskaia Zatmenie: The Great Soviet Eclipse&quot; (2008), &quot;The Book of Wisdom and Lies&quot; (2011), and &quot;Language of the Birds&quot; (2012).

==In popular culture==

The museum was the subject of a 1995 book by Lawrence Weschler entitled &quot;Mr. Wilson&#x27;s Cabinet of Wonder: Pronged Ants, Horned Humans, Mice on Toast, and Other Marvels of Jurassic Technology&quot;, which describes in detail many of its exhibits. The museum is mentioned in the 2008 novel &quot;The Museum of Innocence&quot;, by Turkish Nobel-laureate Orhan Pamuk.

<doc id="20451" wikidata="Q831111" url="?curid=20451" title="Men at Work">
<text>Men at Work are an Australian rock band that was formed in Melbourne, 1978. They were best known for breakthrough hits such as &quot;Down Under&quot;, &quot;Who Can It Be Now?&quot;, &quot;Be Good Johnny&quot;, &quot;Overkill&quot;, and &quot;It&#x27;s a Mistake&quot;. Its founding member and frontman is Colin Hay, who performs on lead vocals and guitar. After playing as an acoustic duo with Ron Strykert from 1978–1979, Hay formed the group with Strykert playing bass guitar with Jerry Speiser on drums. They were soon joined by Greg Ham on flute, saxophone and keyboards, and John Rees on bass guitar, with Strykert switching back to lead guitar. The group was managed by Russell Depeller, a friend of Hay, whom he met at La Trobe University. This line-up achieved national and international success during the early to mid-1980s.

In January 1983, they were the first Australian artists to have a simultaneous No. 1 album and No. 1 single on the United States &quot;Billboard&quot; charts: &quot;Business as Usual&quot; (released on 9 November 1981) and &quot;Down Under&quot; (1981), respectively. With the same works, they achieved the distinction of a simultaneous No. 1 album and No. 1 single on the Australian, New Zealand, and United Kingdom charts. Their second album &quot;Cargo&quot; (2 May 1983) was No. 1 in Australia, No. 2 in New Zealand, No. 3 in the US, and No. 8 in the UK. Their third album &quot;Two Hearts&quot; (3 April 1985) reached the top 20 in Australia and top 50 in the US.

They won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 1983, they were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in 1994, and they have sold over 30 million albums worldwide. In May 2001, &quot;Down Under&quot; was listed at No. 4 on the APRA Top 30 Australian songs and &quot;Business as Usual&quot; appeared in the book &quot;100 Best Australian Albums&quot; (October 2010).

In 1984, Speiser and Rees were asked to leave the group, leaving Hay, Ham, and Strykert as a trio, accompanied by session musicians. During the recording of the &quot;Two Hearts&quot; album, Strykert decided to leave. Soon after the 1985 release of &quot;Two Hearts&quot;, Ham left also, leaving Hay as the sole remaining member. Hay elected to work as a solo artist shortly thereafter in early 1986, and the Men at Work name was retired.

From 1996 until 2002, Hay and Ham revived the name and toured the world as Men at Work (accompanied by new group members). On 19 April 2012, Ham was found dead at his home from an apparent heart attack.

In 2019, Hay once again revived the Men at Work moniker and began touring with another new group of musicians. No other previous Men At Work members are involved in the current revival.

==History==
===Origins===
The nucleus of Men at Work formed in Melbourne around June 1979 with Colin Hay on lead vocals and guitar, Ron Strykert on bass guitar, and Jerry Speiser on drums. They were soon joined by Greg Ham on flute, sax and keyboards, and then John Rees on bass guitar, with Strykert switching to lead guitar. Hay had immigrated to Australia in 1967 from Scotland with his family. In 1978, he had formed an acoustic duo with Strykert, which expanded by mid-1979 with the addition of Speiser. Around this time as a side project, keyboardist Greg Sneddon (ex-Alroy Band), a former bandmate of Jerry Speiser, together with Speiser, Hay and Strykert, performed and recorded the music to &quot;Riff Raff&quot;, a low budget stage musical, upon which Sneddon had worked.

Hay asked Greg Ham to join the group, but Ham hesitated, as he was finishing his music degree. Ultimately, he decided to join the band in October 1979. John Rees, a friend of Jerry, joined soon after. The name Men At Work was thrown into the hat by Colin Hay, and was seconded by Ron Strykert, when a name was required to put on the blackboard outside The Cricketer&#x27;s Arms Hotel, Richmond. The band built a &quot;grass roots&quot; reputation as a pub rock band. In 1980, the group issued their debut single, &quot;Keypunch Operator&quot; backed by &quot;Down Under&quot;, with both tracks co-written by Hay and Strykert. It was &quot;self-financed&quot; and appeared on their own independent, M. A. W. label. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, felt the A-side was &quot;a fast-paced country-styled rocker with a clean sound and quirky rhythm&quot;. Despite not appearing in the top 100 on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart, by the end of that year the group had &quot;grown in stature to become the most in-demand and highly paid, unsigned band of the year&quot;.

=== International success – &quot;Business as Usual&quot; and &quot;Cargo&quot; (1981–1983) ===
Early in 1981 Men at Work signed with CBS Records, the Australian branch of CBS Records International, (which became Sony Music) on the recommendation of Peter Karpin, the label&#x27;s A&amp;R person. The group&#x27;s first single with CBS Records in Australia &quot;Who Can It Be Now?&quot;, was released in June 1981 which reached No. 2 and remained in the chart for 24 weeks. It had been produced by United States–based Peter McIan, who was also working on their debut album, &quot;Business as Usual&quot;.

McIan, together with the band worked on the arrangements for all the songs that appeared on &quot;Business As Usual&quot;. Their next single was a re-arranged and &quot;popified&quot; version of &quot;Down Under&quot;. It appeared in October that year and reached No. 1 in November, where it remained for six weeks. &quot;Business as Usual&quot; was also released in October and went to No. 1 on the Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart, spending a total of nine weeks at the top spot. &quot;The Canberra Times&quot;″ Garry Raffaele opined that it &quot;generally stays at a high level, tight and jerky ... There is a delicacy about this music — and that is not a thing you can say about too many rock groups. The flute and reeds of Greg Ham do much to further that&quot;. McFarlane noted that &quot;[a]side from the strength of the music, part of the album&#x27;s appeal was its economy. The production sound was low-key, but clean and uncluttered. Indeed, the songs stood by themselves with little embellishment save for a bright, melodic, singalong quality&quot;.

By February the following year both &quot;Down Under&quot; and &quot;Business as Usual&quot; had reached No. 1 on the respective Official New Zealand Music Charts – the latter was the first Australian album to reach that peak in New Zealand. Despite its strong Australian and New Zealand showing, and having an American producer (McIan), &quot;Business as Usual&quot; was twice rejected by Columbia&#x27;s US parent company. Thanks to the persistence of Russell Depeller and Karpin, the album was finally released in the US and the United Kingdom in April 1982 – six months after its Australian release. Their next single, &quot;Be Good Johnny&quot;, was issued in Australia in April 1982 and reached No. 8 in Australia, and No. 3 in New Zealand.

Men at Work initially broke through to North American audiences in the western provinces of Canada with &quot;Who Can It Be Now?&quot; hitting the top 10 on radio stations in Winnipeg by May 1982. It peaked at No. 8 on the Canadian &quot;RPM&quot; Top Singles Chart in July. In August the group toured Canada and the United States to promote the album and related singles, supporting Fleetwood Mac. The band became more popular on Canadian radio in the following months and also started receiving top 40 US airplay by August. In October &quot;Who Can It Be Now?&quot; reached No. 1 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, while Canada was one single ahead with &quot;Down Under&quot; topping the Canadian charts that same month. In the following month &quot;Business as Usual&quot; began a 15-week run at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

While &quot;Who Can It Be Now?&quot; was still in the top ten in the US, &quot;Down Under&quot; was finally released in that market. It entered the US charts at No. 79 and ten weeks later, it was No. 1. By January 1983 Men at Work had the top album and single in both the US and the UK – never previously achieved by an Australian act. &quot;Be Good Johnny&quot; received moderate airplay in the US; it reached the top 20 in Canada.

&quot;Down Under&quot; gained international media exposure in September 1983 through television coverage of the Australian challenge for the America&#x27;s Cup yacht trophy in September 1983 when it was adopted as the theme song by the crew of the successful &quot;Australia II&quot;.

The band released their second album, &quot;Cargo&quot;, in April 1983, which also peaked at No. 1 – for two weeks – on the Australian charts. In New Zealand it reached No. 2. It had been finished in mid-1982 with McIan producing again, but was held back due to the success of their debut album on the international market, where &quot;Business as Usual&quot; was still riding high. &quot;Cargo&quot; appeared at No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and No. 8 in the UK. The lead single, &quot;Dr. Heckyll &amp; Mr. Jive&quot; was issued in Australia ahead of the album in October 1982 and reached No. 6, it peaked at No. 28 in the US the following year as the third single in that country. &quot;Overkill&quot;, followed in March 1983 made it to No. 5 in Australia, and No. 3 in the US. &quot;It&#x27;s a Mistake&quot; reached No. 6 in the US. The band toured the world extensively in 1983.

===&quot;Two Hearts&quot; and break-up (1984–1986)===
In 1984, long standing tensions between Hay and Speiser led to a split in the band. Both Rees and Speiser were told they were &quot;not required&quot;, as Hay, Ham and Strykert used session musicians to record their third album, &quot;Two Hearts&quot; (23 April 1985). Hay later attributed the firing to a dispute over the band&#x27;s manager, Russell Deppler, stating, &quot;The rhythm section got sacked because they wanted to sack the manager, who was my friend.&quot; Speiser opined, &quot;Russell was good for hustling gigs in Melbourne and Sydney but once the band became international and multi-million, the sheep farmer from Warrnambool had no idea.&quot; Studio musicians included Jeremy Alsop on bass guitar (ex-Ram Band, Pyramid, Broderick Smith Band); and Mark Kennedy on drums (Spectrum, Ayers Rock, Marcia Hines Band). &quot;Two Hearts&quot; was produced by Hay and Ham. It was a critical and commercial failure compared to their previous albums and only peaked at No. 16 in Australia, and No. 50 on the US chart. Strykert had left during its production.

Four tracks were released as singles, &quot;Everything I Need&quot; (May 1985), &quot;Man with Two Hearts&quot;, &quot;Maria&quot; (August), and &quot;Hard Luck Story&quot; (October); only the lead single charted in Australia (No. 37) and the US (No. 47). The album relied heavily on drum machines and synthesisers, and reduced the presence of Ham&#x27;s saxophone, giving it a different feel compared to its predecessors. Hay and Ham hired new bandmates, to tour in support of &quot;Two Hearts&quot;, with Alsop and Kennedy joined by James Black on guitar and keyboards (Mondo Rock, The Black Sorrows). Soon after a third guitarist, Colin Bayley (Mi-Sex), was added and Kennedy was replaced on drums by Chad Wackerman (Frank Zappa). Australian singers Kate Ceberano and Renée Geyer had also worked on the album and performed live as guest vocalists.

On 13 July 1985 Men at Work performed three tracks for the Oz for Africa concert (part of the global Live Aid program)—&quot;Maria&quot;, &quot;Overkill&quot;, and an unreleased one, &quot;The Longest Night&quot;. They were broadcast in Australia (on both Seven Network and Nine Network) and on MTV in the US. &quot;Maria&quot; and &quot;Overkill&quot; were also broadcast by American Broadcasting Company (ABC) during their Live Aid telecast. Ham left during the band&#x27;s time touring behind the album. The final Men at Work performances during 1985 had jazz saxophonist Paul Williamson (The Black Sorrows), replacing Ham. As of October 1985, the band&#x27;s official line-up was a sextet of Hay, Alsop, Bayley, Black, Wackerman and Williamson (as pictured on the Australia-only single &quot;Sail To You&quot;), but by early 1986 the band was defunct. At that time, Hay started recording his first solo album, &quot;Looking for Jack&quot; (January 1987), which had Alsop and Wackerman as session musicians.

===Partial reunion and second break-up (1996–2002)===
By mid-1996, after a ten-year absence, Hay and Ham reformed Men at Work to tour South America. They had enjoyed strong fan support there during their earlier career and demands for a reunion had persisted. The 1996 line up had Stephen Hadley on bass guitar and backing vocals (ex-The Black Sorrows, Paul Kelly Band); Simon Hosford on guitar and backing vocals (Colin Hay backing band); and John Watson on drums (The Black Sorrows). The tour culminated in a performance in São Paulo, which was recorded for the Brazilian release of a live album, &quot;Brazil &#x27;96&quot;, in 1997, which was co-produced by Hay and Ham for Sony Music. It was re-released worldwide in 1998 as &quot;Brazil&quot; with a bonus track, &quot;The Longest Night&quot;, the first new studio track since &quot;Two Hearts&quot;.

In 1997 drummer Tony Floyd replaced Watson but by 1998 the lineup was Hay, Ham, James Ryan (guitar, backing vocals), Rick Grossman (of the Hoodoo Gurus) on bass and Peter Maslen (ex-Boom Crash Opera) on drums. In 1999 Ryan, Grossman and Maslen were out and Hosford and Floyd were back in, along with bassist Stuart Speed. Rodrigo Aravena was brought in on bass in 2000, along with Heta Moses on drums. Moses was replaced by Warren Trout in 2001 as Stephen Hadley returned on bass.

The band toured Australia, South America, Europe and the US from 1998 to 2000. Men at Work performed &quot;Down Under&quot; at the closing ceremony of the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, alongside Paul Hogan of &quot;&quot;Crocodile&quot; Dundee&quot; (1986).

One of their European tours for mid-2000 was cancelled and the group had disbanded once again by 2002, although Hay and Ham periodically reunited Men at Work with guest musicians (including an appearance in February 2009, when they performed &quot;Down Under&quot; as a duo at the Australia Unites Victorian Bushfire Appeal Telethon).

=== Copyright lawsuit and the death of Greg Ham ===
In February 2010, Larrikin Music Publishing won a case against Hay and Strykert, their record label (Sony BMG Music Entertainment) and music publishing company (EMI Songs Australia), arising from the uncredited appropriation of &quot;Kookaburra&quot;, originally written in 1932 by Marion Sinclair, and for which Larrikin owned the publishing rights, as the flute line in the Men at Work song &quot;Down Under&quot;. In early 2009 the Australian music-themed TV quiz, &quot;Spicks and Specks&quot;, had posed a question which suggested that &quot;Down Under&quot; contained elements of &quot;Kookaburra&quot;.

Larrikin, then headed by Norman Lurie, filed suit after Larrikin was sold to another company and had demanded between 40% and 60% of the previous six years of earnings from the song. In February 2010, the judge ruled that &quot;Down Under&quot; did contain a flute riff based on &quot;Kookaburra&quot; but stipulated that neither was it necessarily the hook nor a substantial part of the hit song (Hay and Strykert had written the track years before the flute riff was added by Ham). In July 2010, a judge ruled that Larrikin should be paid 5% of past (since 2002) and future profits. Ham took the verdict particularly hard, feeling responsible for having performed the flute riff at the centre of the lawsuit and worried that he would only be remembered for copying someone else&#x27;s music, resulting in depression and anxiety. Ham&#x27;s body was found in his Carlton North home on 19 April 2012 after he suffered a fatal heart attack at age 58.

===Post 2012===
In June 2019, Hay toured Europe with a group of Los Angeles–based session musicians under the name Men at Work, despite the band featuring no other original members of the band. The new lineup consisted of Hay (vocals, guitar), Scheila Gonzalez (saxophone, keyboards, vocals, flute), San Miguel Perez (guitar, backing vocals), Yosmel Montejo (bass, backing vocals), Jimmy Branly (drums, percussion) and Cecilia Noël (backing vocals).

In 2021 Australian producer Christian &#x27;Luude&#x27; Benson (from the Tasmanian tech house dance duo Choomba) remixed &quot;Down Under&quot; as a drum and bass track, which became popular online. Hay re-recorded the vocal for the track&#x27;s official release, now credited to Luude featuring Colin Hay, with the record charting at number 32 on the UK Singles chart on 7 January 2022 and at number 48 in Australia (on the ARIA Top 50 Singles for the week of 10 January 2022).

== Other projects ==
Hay maintained a solo career and has played with Ringo Starr &amp; His All-Starr Band in 2003, 2008 and ongoing since 2018. Strykert relocated to Hobart in 2009 from Los Angeles, and continued to play music and released his first solo album, &quot;Paradise&quot;, in September that year. He expressed resentment towards Hay, mainly over royalties. Ham remained musically active and played sax with the Melbourne-based group The Nudist Funk Orchestra until his death. Rees was a music teacher in Melbourne and also played the violin and bass guitar for the band Beggs 2 Differ. Speiser played drums for the band The Afterburner.

<text>Meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS), also known as neonatal aspiration of meconium, is a medical condition affecting newborn infants. It describes the spectrum of disorders and pathophysiology of newborns born in meconium-stained amniotic fluid (MSAF) and have meconium within their lungs. Therefore, MAS has a wide range of severity depending on what conditions and complications develop after parturition. Furthermore, the pathophysiology of MAS is multifactorial and extremely complex which is why it is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in term infants.

The word &quot;meconium&quot; is derived from the Greek word &quot;mēkōnion&quot; meaning &quot;juice from the opium poppy&quot; as the sedative effects it had on the foetus were observed by Aristotle.

Meconium is a sticky dark-green substance which contains gastrointestinal secretions, amniotic fluid, bile acids, bile, blood, mucus, cholesterol, pancreatic secretions, lanugo, vernix caseosa and cellular debris. Meconium accumulates in the foetal gastrointestinal tract throughout the third trimester of pregnancy and it is the first intestinal discharge released within the first 48 hours after birth. Notably, since meconium and the whole content of the gastrointestinal tract is located &#x27;extracorporeally,&#x27; its constituents are hidden and normally not recognised by the foetal immune system.

For the meconium within the amniotic fluid to successfully cause MAS, it has to enter the respiratory system during the period when the fluid-filled lungs transition into an air-filled organ capable of gas exchange.

==Causes==
The main theories of meconium passage into amniotic fluid are caused by fetal maturity or from foetal stress as a result of hypoxia or infection. Other factors that promote the passage of meconium &quot;in utero&quot; include placental insufficiency, maternal hypertension, pre-eclampsia and maternal drug use of tobacco and cocaine. However, the exact mechanism for meconium passage into the amniotic fluid is not completely understood and it may be a combination of several factors.

=== Meconium passage as a result of foetal distress ===
There may be an important association between foetal distress and hypoxia with MSAF. It is believed that foetal distress develops into foetal hypoxia causing the foetus to defecate meconium resulting in MSAF and then perhaps MAS. Other stressors which causes foetal distress, and therefore meconium passage, includes when umbilical vein oxygen saturation is below 30%.

Foetal hypoxic stress during parturition can stimulate colonic activity, by enhancing intestinal peristalsis and relaxing the anal sphincter, which results in the passage of meconium. Then, because of intrauterine gasping or from the first few breaths after delivery, MAS may develop. Furthermore, aspiration of thick meconium leads to obstruction of airways resulting in a more severe hypoxia.

The association between foetal distress and meconium passage is not a definite cause-effect relationship as over of infants with MSAF are vigorous at birth and do not have any distress or hypoxia. Additionally, foetal distress occurs frequently without the passage of meconium as well.

=== Meconium passage as a result of foetal maturity ===
Although meconium is present in the gastrointestinal tract early in development, MSAF rarely occurs before 34 weeks gestation.

Peristalsis of the foetal intestines is present as early as 8 weeks gestation and the anal sphincter develops at about 20–22 weeks. The early control mechanisms of the anal sphincter are not well understood, however there is evidence that the foetus does defecate routinely into the amniotic cavity even in the absence of distress. The presence of fetal intestinal enzymes have been found in the amniotic fluid of women who are as early as 14–22 weeks pregnant. Thus, suggesting there is free passage of the intestinal contents into the amniotic fluid.

Motilin is found in higher concentrations in post-term than pre-term foetal gastrointestinal tracts. Similarly, intestinal parasympathetic innervation and myelination also increases in later gestations. Therefore, the increased incidence of MAS in post-term pregnancies may reflect the maturation and development of the peristalsis within the gastrointestinal tract in the newborn.

==Pathophysiology==
As MAS describes a spectrum of disorders of newborns born through MSAF, without any congenital respiratory disorders or other underlying pathology, there are numerous hypothesised mechanisms and causes for the onset of this syndrome. Long-term consequences may arise from these disorders, for example, infants that develop MAS have higher rates of developing neurodevelopmental defects due to poor respiration.

=== Airway obstruction ===
In the first 15 minutes of meconium aspiration, there is obstruction of larger airways which causes increased lung resistance, decreased lung compliance, acute hypoxemia, hypercapnia, atelectasis and respiratory acidosis. After 60 minutes of exposure, the meconium travels further down into the smaller airways. Once within the terminal bronchioles and alveoli, the meconium triggers inflammation, pulmonary edema, vasoconstriction, bronchoconstriction, collapse of airways and inactivation of surfactant.

=== Foetal hypoxia ===
The lung areas which do not or only partially participate in ventilation, because of obstruction and/or destruction, will become hypoxic and an inflammatory response may consequently occur. Partial obstruction will lead to air trapping and hyperinflation of certain lung areas and pneumothorax may follow. Chronic hypoxia will lead to an increase in pulmonary vascular smooth muscle tone and persistent pulmonary hypertension causing respiratory and circulatory failure.

=== Infection ===
Microorganisms, most commonly Gram-negative rods, and endotoxins are found in samples of MSAF at a higher rate than in clear amniotic fluid, for example 46.9% of patients with MSAF also had endotoxins present. A microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity (MIAC) is more common in patients with MSAF and this could ultimately lead to an intra-amniotic inflammatory response. MIAC is associated with high concentrations of cytokines (such as IL-6), chemokines (such as IL-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1), complement, phospholipase A2 and matrix-degrading enzymes. Therefore, these aforementioned mediators within the amniotic fluid during MIAC and intra-amniotic infection could, when aspirated &quot;in&quot; &quot;utero&quot;, induce lung inflammation within the foetus.

=== Pulmonary inflammation ===
Meconium has a complex chemical composition, so it is difficult to identify a single agent responsible for the several diseases that arise. As meconium is stored inside the intestines, and is partly unexposed to the immune system, when it becomes aspirated the innate immune system recognises as a foreign and dangerous substance. The immune system, which is present at birth, responds within minutes with a low specificity and no memory in order to try to eliminate microbes. Meconium perhaps leads to chemical pneumonitis as it is a potent activator of inflammatory mediators which include cytokines, complement, prostaglandins and reactive oxygen species.

Meconium is a source of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukins (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8), and mediators produced by neutrophils, macrophages and epithelial cells that may injure the lung tissue directly or indirectly. For example, proteolytic enzymes are released from neutrophilic granules and these may damage the lung membrane and surfactant proteins. Additionally, activated leukocytes and cytokines generate reactive nitrogen and oxygen species which have cytotoxic effects. Oxidative stress results in vasoconstriction, bronchoconstriction, platelet aggregation and accelerated cellular apoptosis. Recently, it has been hypothesised that meconium is a potent activator of toll-like receptor (TLRs) and complement, key mediators in inflammation, and may thus contribute to the inflammatory response in MAS.

Meconium contains high amounts of phospholipase A2 (PLA2), a potent proinflammatory enzyme, which may directly (or through the stimulation of arachidonic acid) lead to surfactant dysfunction, lung epithelium destruction, tissue necrosis and an increase in apoptosis. Meconium can also activate the coagulation cascade, production of platelet-activating factor (PAF) and other vasoactive substances that may lead to destruction of capillary endothelium and basement membranes. Injury to the alveolocapillary membrane results in leakage of liquid, plasma proteins, and cells into the interstitium and alveolar spaces.

=== Surfactant inactivation ===
Surfactant is synthesised by type II alveolar cells and is made of a complex of phospholipids, proteins and saccharides. It functions to lower surface tension (to allow for lung expansion during inspiration), stabilise alveoli at the end of expiration (to prevent alveolar collapse) and prevents lung oedema. Surfactant also contributes to lung protection and defence as it is also an anti-inflammatory agent. Surfactant enhances the removal of inhaled particles and senescent cells away from the alveolar structure.

The extent of surfactant inhibition depends on both the concentration of surfactant and meconium. If the surfactant concentration is low, even very highly diluted meconium can inhibit surfactant function whereas, in high surfactant concentrations, the effects of meconium are limited. Meconium may impact surfactant mechanisms by preventing surfactant from spreading over the alveolar surface, decreasing the concentration of surfactant proteins (SP-A and SP-B), and by changing the viscosity and structure of surfactant. Several morphological changes occur after meconium exposure, the most notable being the detachment of airway epithelium from stroma and the shedding of epithelial cells into the airway. These indicate a direct detrimental effect on lung alveolar cells because of the introduction of meconium into the lungs.

=== Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension ===
Persistent pulmonary hypertension (PPHN) is the failure of the foetal circulation to adapt to extra-uterine conditions after birth. PPHN is associated with various respiratory diseases, including MAS (as 15-20% of infants with MAS develop PPHN), but also pneumonia and sepsis. A combination of hypoxia, pulmonary vasoconstriction and ventilation/perfusion mismatch can trigger PPHN, depending on the concentration of meconium within the respiratory tract. PPHN in newborns is the leading cause of death in MAS.

=== Apoptosis ===
Apoptosis is an important mechanism in the clearance of injured cells and in tissue repair, however too much apoptosis may cause harm, such as acute lung injury. Meconium induces apoptosis and DNA cleavage of lung airway epithelial cells, this is detected by the presence of fragmented DNA within the airways and in alveolar epithelial nuclei. Meconium induces an inflammatory reaction within the lungs as there is an increase of autophagocytic cells and levels of caspase 3 after exposure. After 8 hours of meconium exposure, in rabbit foetuses, the total amount of apoptotic cells is 54%. Therefore, the majority of meconium-induced lung damage may be due to the apoptosis of lung epithelium.

== Diagnosis ==

Respiratory distress in an infant born through the darkly coloured MSAF as well as meconium obstructing the airways is usually sufficient to diagnose MAS. Additionally, newborns with MAS can have other types of respiratory distress such as tachypnea and hypercapnia. Sometimes it is hard to diagnose MAS as it can be confused with other diseases that also cause respiratory distress, such as pneumonia. Additionally, X-rays and lung ultrasounds can be quick, easy and cheap imaging techniques to diagnose lung diseases like MAS.

== Prevention ==
In general, the incidence of MAS has been significantly reduced over the past two decades as the number of post-term deliveries has minimized.

=== Prevention during pregnancy ===
Prevention during pregnancy may include amnioinfusion and antibiotics but the effectiveness of these treatments are questionable.

=== Prevention during parturition ===
As previously mentioned, oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal suctioning is not an ideal preventative treatment for both vigorous and depressed (not breathing) infants.

== Treatment ==
Most infants born through MSAF do not require any treatments (other than routine postnatal care) as they show no signs of respiratory distress, as only approximately 5% of infants born through MSAF develop MAS. However, infants which do develop MAS need to be admitted to a neonatal unit where they will be closely observed and provided any treatments needed. Observations include monitoring heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation and blood glucose (to detect worsening respiratory acidosis or the development of hypoglycemia). In general, treatment of MAS is more supportive in nature.

=== Assisted ventilation techniques ===
To clear the airways of meconium, tracheal suctioning can be used however, the efficacy of this method is in question and it can cause harm.

In cases of MAS, there is a need for supplemental oxygen for at least 12 hours in order to maintain oxygen saturation of haemoglobin at 92% or more. The severity of respiratory distress can vary significantly between newborns with MAS, as some require minimal or no supplemental oxygen requirement and, in severe cases, mechanical ventilation may be needed. The desired oxygen saturation is between 90 and 95% and PaO2 may be as high as 90mmHg. In cases where there is thick meconium deep within the lungs, mechanical ventilation may be required. In extreme cases, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may be utilised in infants who fail to respond to ventilation therapy. While on ECMO, the body can have time to absorb the meconium and for all the associated disorders to resolve. There has been an excellent response to this treatment, as the survival rate of MAS while on ECMO is more than 94%.

Ventilation of infants with MAS can be challenging and, as MAS can affect each individual differently, ventilation administration may need to be customised. Some newborns with MAS can have homogenous lung changes and others can have inconsistent and patchy changes to their lungs. It is common for sedation and muscle relaxants to be used to optimise ventilation and minimise the risk of pneumothorax associated with dyssynchronous breathing.

=== Inhaled nitric oxide ===
Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) acts on vascular smooth muscle causing selective pulmonary vasodilation. This is ideal in the treatment of PPHN as it causes vasodilation within ventilated areas of the lung thus, decreasing the ventilation-perfusion mismatch and thereby, improves oxygenation. Treatment utilising iNO decreases the need for ECMO and mortality in newborns with hypoxic respiratory failure and PPHN as a result of MAS. However, approximately 30-50% of infants with PPHN do not respond to iNO therapy.

=== Antiinflammatories ===
As inflammation is such a huge issue in MAS, treatment has consisted of anti-inflammatories.

==== Glucocorticoids ====
Glucocorticoids have a strong anti-inflammatory activity and works to reduce the migration and activation of neutrophils, eosinophils, mononuclear cells, and other cells. They reduce the migration of neutrophils into the lungs ergo, decreasing their adherence to the endothelium. Thus, there is a reduction in the action of mediators released from these cells and therefore, a reduced inflammatory response.

Glucocorticoids also possess a genomic mechanism of action in which, once bound to a glucocorticoid receptor, the activated complex moves into the nucleus and inhibits transcription of mRNA. Ultimately, effecting whether various proteins get produced or not. Inhibiting the transcription of nuclear factor (NF-κB) and protein activator (AP-1) attenuates the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF etc.), enzymes (PLA2, COX-2, iNOs etc.) and other biologically active substances. The anti-inflammatory effect of glucocorticoids is also demonstrated by enhancing the activity of lipocortines which inhibit the activity of PLA2 and therefore, decrease the production of arachidonic acid and mediators of lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase pathways.

Anti-inflammatories need to be administered as quickly as possible as the effect of these drugs can diminish even just an hour after meconium aspiration. For example, early administration of dexamethasone significantly enhanced gas exchange, reduced ventilatory pressures, decreased the number of neutrophils in the bronchoalveolar area, reduced oedema formation and oxidative lung injury. However, glucocorticoids may increase the risk of infection and this risk increases with the dose and duration of glucocorticoid treatment. Other issues can arise, such as aggravation of diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, skin atrophy and growth retardation in children.

==== Inhibitors of phosphodiesterase ====
Phosphodiesterases (PDE) degrades cAMP and cGMP and, within the respiratory system of a newborn with MAS, various isoforms of PDE may be involved due to their pro-inflammatory and smooth muscle contractile activity. Therefore, non-selective and selective inhibitors of PDE could potentially be used in MAS therapy. However, the use of PDE inhibitors can cause cardiovascular side effects. Non-selective PDE inhibitors, such as methylxanthines, increase concentrations of cAMP and cGMP in the cells leading to bronchodilation and vasodilation. Additionally, methylxanthines decreases the concentrations of calcium, acetylcholine and monoamines, this controls the release of various mediators of inflammation and bronchoconstriction, including prostaglandins. Selective PDE inhibitors target one subtype of phosphodiesterase and in MAS the activities of PDE-3, PDE-4, PDE-5 and PDE-7 may become enhanced. For example, Milrinone (a selective PDE3 inhibitor) improved oxygenation and survival of neonates with MAS.

==== Inhibitors of cyclooxygenase ====
Arachidonic acid is metabolised, via cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase, to various substances including prostaglandins and leukotrienes, which exhibit potent pro-inflammatory and vasoactive effects. By inhibiting COX, and more specifically COX-2, (either through selective or non-selective drugs) inflammation and oedema can be reduced. However, COX inhibitors may induce peptic ulcers and cause hyperkalemia and hypernatremia. Additionally, COX inhibitors have not shown any great response in the treatment of MAS.

=== Antibiotics ===
Meconium is typically sterile however, it can contain various cultures of bacteria so appropriate antibiotics may need to be prescribed.

=== Surfactant treatment ===
Lung lavage with diluted surfactant has potential benefits depending on how early it is given in newborns with MAS. This treatment shows promise as it has an effect on air leaks, pneumothorax, the need for ECMO and death. Early intervention and using it on newborns with mild MAS is more effective. However, there are risks as a large volume of fluid instillation to the lung of a newborn can be dangerous (particularly in cases of severe MAS with pulmonary hypertension) as it can exacerbate hypoxia and lead to mortality.

=== Previous treatments ===
Originally, it was believed that MAS developed as a result of the meconium being a physical blockage of the airways. Thus, to prevent newborns, who were born through MSAF, from developing MAS, suctioning of the oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal area before delivery of the shoulders followed by tracheal aspiration was utilised for 20 years. This treatment was believed to be effective as it was reported to significantly decrease the incidence of MAS compared to those newborns born through MSAF who were not treated. This claim was later disproved and future studies concluded that oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal suctioning, before delivery of the shoulders in infants born through MSAF, does not prevent MAS or its complications. In fact, it can cause more issues and damage (e.g. mucosal damage), thus it is not a recommended preventative treatment. Suctioning may not significantly reduce the incidence of MAS as meconium passage and aspiration may occur &quot;in-utero.&quot; Thereby making the suctioning redundant and useless as the meconium may already be deep within the lungs at the time of birth.

Historically, amnioinfusion has been used when MSAF was present, which involves a transcervical infusion of fluid during labour. The idea was to dilute the thick meconium to reduce its potential pathophysiology and reduce cases of MAS, since MAS is more prevalent in cases of thick meconium. However, there are associated risks, such as umbilical cord prolapse and prolongation of labour. The UK National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) Guidelines recommend against the use of amnioinfusion in women with MSAF.

== Prevalence ==

1 in every 7 pregnancies have MSAF and, of these cases, approximately 5% of these infants develop MAS. MSAF is observed 23-52% in pregnancies at 42 weeks. Therefore, the frequency of MAS increases as the length of gestation increases, such that the prevalence is greatest in post-term pregnancies. Conversely, preterm births are not frequently associated with MSAF (only approximately 5% in total contain MSAF). The rate of MAS declines in populations where labour is induced in women that have pregnancies exceeding 41 weeks. There are many suspected pre-disposing factors that are thought to increase the risk of MAS. For example, the risk of MSAF is higher in African American, African and Pacific Islander mothers, compared to mothers from other ethnic groups.

== Future research ==
Research is being focused on developing both a successful method for preventing MAS as well as an effective treatment. For example, investigations are being made in the efficiency of anti-inflammatory agents, surfactant replacement therapy and antibiotic therapy. More research needs to be conducted on the pharmacological properties of, for example, glucocorticoids, including dosages, administration, timing or any drug interactions. Additionally, there is still research being conducted on whether intubation and suctioning of meconium in newborns with MAS is beneficial, harmful or is simply a redundant and outdated treatment. In general, there is still no generally accepted therapeutic protocol and effective treatment plan for MAS.

<text>Meconium is the earliest stool of a mammalian infant resulting from defecation. Unlike later feces, meconium is composed of materials ingested during the time the infant spends in the uterus: intestinal epithelial cells, lanugo, mucus, amniotic fluid, bile, and water. Meconium, unlike later feces, is viscous and sticky like tar – its color usually being a very dark olive green and it is almost odorless. When diluted in amniotic fluid, it may appear in various shades of green, brown, or yellow. It should be completely passed by the end of the first few days after birth, with the stools progressing toward yellow (digested milk).

== Clinical significance ==

=== Meconium in amniotic fluid ===
Meconium is normally retained in the infant&#x27;s bowel until after birth, but sometimes it is expelled into the amniotic fluid prior to birth or during labor and delivery. The stained amniotic fluid is recognized by medical staff as a possible sign of fetal distress. Some post-dates pregnancies (when they are more than 40 weeks pregnant) may also have meconium-stained amniotic fluid without fetal distress. Medical staff may aspirate the meconium from the nose and mouth of a newborn immediately after delivery in the event the baby shows signs of respiratory distress to decrease the risk of meconium aspiration syndrome, which can occur in meconium-stained amniotic fluid.

Most of the time that the amniotic fluid is stained with meconium, it will be homogeneously distributed throughout the fluid, making it brown. This indicates that the fetus passed the meconium some time ago such that sufficient mixing occurred as to establish the homogeneous mixture. Terminal meconium occurs when the fetus passes the meconium a short enough time before birth/cesarean section that the amniotic fluid remains clear, but individual clumps of meconium are in the fluid.

=== Failure to pass meconium ===

The failure to pass meconium is a symptom of several diseases including Hirschsprung&#x27;s disease and cystic fibrosis.

The meconium sometimes becomes thickened and congested in the intestines, a condition known as meconium ileus. Meconium ileus is often the first sign of cystic fibrosis. In cystic fibrosis, the meconium can form a bituminous black-green mechanical obstruction in a segment of the ileum. Beyond this, there may be a few separate grey-white globular pellets. Below this level, the bowel is a narrow and empty micro-colon. Above the level of the obstruction, there are several loops of hypertrophied bowel distended with fluid. No meconium is passed, and abdominal distension and vomiting appear soon after birth. About 20% of cases of cystic fibrosis present with meconium ileus, while approximately 20% of one series of cases of meconium ileus did not have cystic fibrosis. The presence of meconium ileus is not related to the severity of the cystic fibrosis. The obstruction can be relieved in a number of ways.

Meconium ileus should be distinguished from meconium plug syndrome, in which a tenacious mass of mucus prevents the meconium from passing and there is no risk of intestinal perforation. Meconium ileus has a significant risk of intestinal perforation. In a barium enema, meconium plug syndrome shows a normal or dilated colon as compared to micro-colon in meconium ileus.

=== Testing meconium for drugs ===
Meconium can be tested for various drugs, to check for &quot;in utero&quot; exposure. Using meconium, a Canadian research group showed that by measuring a by-product of alcohol, fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE), they could objectively detect excessive maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy. 

In the US, the results of meconium testing may be used by child protective services and other law enforcement agencies if the capacity of the parents to look after their child is in question. Meconium can also be analyzed to detect the tobacco use of mothers during their pregnancy, which is commonly under-reported.

== Sterility ==
The issue of whether meconium is sterile remains debated and is an area of ongoing research. Although some researchers have reported evidence of bacteria in meconium, this has not been consistently confirmed. Other researchers have raised questions about whether these findings may be due to contamination after sample collection and that meconium is, in fact, sterile until after birth. Further researchers have hypothesized that there may be bacteria in the womb, but these are a normal part of pregnancy and could have an important role in shaping the developing immune system and are not harmful to the baby.

== Etymology ==
The Latin term &quot;meconium&quot; derives from Greek , &quot;mēkōnion&quot;, a diminutive of , &quot;mēkōn&quot; &#x27;poppy&#x27;, in reference either to its tar-like appearance that may resemble some raw opium preparations or to Aristotle&#x27;s belief that it induces sleep in the fetus.

==Other uses==
* In biology, meconium describes the metabolic waste product from the pupal stage of an insect that is expelled through the anal opening of the adult upon eclosion from the pupa. Other insects, such as beetles and some Hymenoptera (Aculeata) expel the meconium at the end of the larval stage, before becoming a pupa.

<text>The (Montreux) Convention regarding the Regime of the Straits, often known simply as the Montreux Convention, is an international agreement governing the Bosporus and Dardanelles straits in Turkey. Signed on 20 July 1936 at the Montreux Palace in Switzerland, it went into effect on 9 November 1936, addressing the long running Straits Question over who should control the strategically vital link between the Black and Mediterranean seas.

The Montreux Convention regulates maritime traffic through the Bosporus and Dardanelles straits in Turkey. It guarantees &quot;complete freedom&quot; of passage for all civilian vessels in times of peace. In peacetime, military vessels are limited in number, tonnage and weaponry, with specific provisions governing their mode of entry and duration of stay. If they want to pass through the Strait, warships must provide advance notification to the Turkish authorities, which, in turn, must inform the parties to the convention. In wartime, if Turkey is not involved in the conflict, warships of the nations at war may not pass through the Straits, except when returning to their base. When Turkey is at war, or feels threatened by a war, it may take any decision about the passage of warships as it sees fit. The United States is not a signatory to the Convention.

While it was designed for a particular geopolitical context, and remains unchanged since its adoption, the Montreux Convention has endured as a &quot;solid example of a rules-based international order&quot;, since most of its terms are still followed.

==Background==

The convention was one of a series of agreements in the 19th and 20th centuries that sought to address the long-running Straits Question of who should control the strategically vital link between the Black Sea and Mediterranean Sea. In 1923, the Treaty of Lausanne had demilitarised the Dardanelles and opened the Straits to unrestricted civilian and military traffic under the supervision of the International Straits Commission of the League of Nations.

By the late 1930s, the strategic situation in the Mediterranean had altered with the rise of Fascist Italy, which controlled the Greek-inhabited Dodecanese islands off the west coast of Turkey and had constructed fortifications on Rhodes, Leros and Kos. The Turks feared that Italy would seek to exploit access to the Straits to expand its power into Anatolia and the Black Sea region. There were also fears of Bulgarian rearmament. Although Turkey was not legally permitted to refortify the Straits, it nonetheless did so secretly.

In April 1935, the Turkish government dispatched a lengthy diplomatic note to the signatories of the Treaty of Lausanne proposing a conference to agree a new regime for the Straits and requested that the League of Nations authorise the reconstruction of the Dardanelles forts. In the note, Turkish Foreign Minister Tevfik Rüştü Aras explained that the international situation had changed greatly since 1923. Europe had then been moving towards disarmament and an international guarantee to defend the Straits. The Abyssinia Crisis of 1934–1935, the denunciation by Germany of the Treaty of Versailles and international moves towards rearmament meant that &quot;the only guarantee intended to guard against the total insecurity of the Straits has just disappeared in its turn&quot;. Indeed, Aras said that &quot;the Powers most closely concerned are proclaiming the existence of a threat of general conflagration&quot;. The key weaknesses of the present regime were that the machinery for collective guarantees were too slow and ineffective, and there was no contingency for a general threat of war and no provision for Turkey to defend itself. Turkey was therefore prepared to enter into negotiations with a view to concluding, in the near future, agreements for regulation of the Straits with essential security provisions for the inviolability of Turkey&#x27;s territory, and also for continued development of commercial navigation between the Mediterranean and the Black Sea.

The response to the note was generally favourable; Australia, Bulgaria, France, Germany, Greece, Japan, Romania, the Soviet Union, Turkey, the United Kingdom and Yugoslavia attended negotiations at Montreux, Switzerland, which began on 22 June 1936. Two major powers were notably absent: Italy, whose aggressively expansionist policies had prompted the conference, refused to attend, and the increasingly isolationist United States declined even to send an observer.

Turkey, the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union each put forward their own set of proposals, each aimed chiefly at protecting the proponent&#x27;s own interests. The British favoured the continuation of a relatively restrictive approach, the Turks sought a more liberal regime that reasserted their control over the Straits, and the Soviets proposed a regime that would guarantee absolute freedom of passage. The British, supported by France, sought to exclude the Soviet fleet from the Mediterranean Sea, where it might threaten the vital shipping lanes to India, Egypt and the Far East. In the end, the British conceded some of their requests, but the Soviets succeeded in ensuring that the Black Sea countries, including the Soviet Union, were given exemptions from the military restrictions imposed on non-Black Sea nations. The agreement was ratified by all of the conference attendees with the exception of Germany, which had not been a signatory to the Treaty of Lausanne, and with reservations by Japan, and came into force on 9 November 1936; it was registered with the &quot;League of Nations Treaty Series&quot; on 11 December 1936.

Britain&#x27;s willingness to make concessions has been attributed to a desire to avoid Turkey being driven to ally itself with or to fall under the influence of Adolf Hitler or Benito Mussolini. It was thus the first in a series of steps by Britain and France to ensure that Turkey would either remain neutral or tilt towards the Western Allies in the event of any future conflict with the Axis.

==Terms==

As mentioned in its preamble, the Convention replaced the terms of the Lausanne Treaty of 1923 regarding the Straits. This had dictated the demilitarisation of the Greek islands of Lemnos and Samothrace, along with the demilitarisation of the Sea of Marmara and the Bosporus, the Dardanelles, and the Turkish islands of İmroz, Bozcaada and Tavşan.

The Convention consists of 29 Articles, four annexes and one protocol. Articles 2–7 consider the passage of merchant ships. Articles 8–22 consider the passage of war vessels. The key principle — freedom of passage and navigation — is laid out in articles 1 and 2. Article 1 provides, &quot;The High Contracting Parties recognise and affirm the principle of freedom of passage and navigation by sea in the Straits&quot;. Article 2 states, &quot;In time of peace, merchant vessels shall enjoy complete freedom of passage and navigation in the Straits, by day and by night, under any flag with any kind of cargo&quot;.

The International Straits Commission was abolished, thereby allowing the full resumption of Turkish military control over the Straits and the refortification of the Dardanelles. Turkey was authorised to close the Straits to all foreign warships during a war or when it was threatened by aggression. Also, Turkey was authorised to refuse transit from merchant ships belonging to countries at war with it.

A number of highly specific restrictions in Article 14 and 18 were imposed on what type of warships are allowed passage. Non-Black Sea powers wishing to send a vessel must notify Turkey 15 days prior to the requested passing, and Black Sea states must notify 8 days prior to passage. Also, no more than nine foreign warships, with a total aggregate tonnage of 15,000 tons, may pass at any one time. Furthermore, no single ship heavier than 10,000 tonnes can pass. An aggregate tonnage of all non-Black Sea warships in the Black Sea must be no more than 45,000 tons, with no one nation exceeding 30,000 tons at any given time, and they are permitted to stay in the Black Sea for at most 21 days. Only Black Sea states may transit capital ships of any tonnage, escorted by no more than two destroyers. Any revision to articles 14 and 18 requires 3/4 majority of signatory countries and must include Turkey.

Under Article 12, Black Sea states are also allowed to send submarines through the Straits with prior notice as long as the vessels have been constructed, purchased or sent for repair outside the Black Sea. The less restrictive rules applicable to Black Sea states were agreed as effectively a concession to the Soviet Union, the only Black Sea state other than Turkey with any significant number of capital ships or submarines. The passage of civil aircraft between the Mediterranean and the Black seas is permitted only along routes authorised by the Turkish government.

In time of war, Turkey not being belligerent, warships of belligerent Powers shall not pass, except to return to their base. (art. 19)

==Implementation==
The terms of the convention were largely a reflection of the international situation in the mid-1930s. They largely served Turkish and Soviet interests by enabling Turkey to regain military control of the Straits and assuring Soviet dominance of the Black Sea. Although the Convention restricted the Soviets&#x27; ability to send naval forces into the Mediterranean Sea — satisfying British concerns about Soviet intrusion into what was considered a British sphere of influence — it also ensured that outside powers could not exploit the Straits to threaten the Soviet Union. This feature was to have significant repercussions during World War II; the Montreux regime prevented the Axis powers from sending naval forces through the Straits to attack the Soviet Union. The Axis powers, thereby, were severely limited in naval capability for their Black Sea campaigns, relying principally on small vessels transported overland by rail and canal networks.

Auxiliary vessels and armed merchant ships comprised a grey area, though, and the transit of such Axis vessels through the straits led to friction between the Allies and Turkey. After a number of German auxiliary ships had been permitted to transit the Straits, repeated protests from Moscow and London prompted the Turkish government to ban passage of &quot;suspicious&quot; Axis ships from June 1944.

=== Aircraft carriers ===
Although the Montreux Convention is cited by the Turkish government as prohibiting aircraft carriers from transiting the Straits, the treaty actually contains no explicit prohibition on aircraft carriers. However, modern aircraft carriers are heavier than the 15,000-ton limit imposed on warships, which makes it impossible for non–Black Sea powers to transit modern aircraft carriers through the Straits.

Under Article 11, Black Sea states are permitted to transit capital ships of any tonnage through the straits, but Annex II specifically excludes aircraft carriers from the definition of capital ship. In 1936, it was common for battleships to carry observation aircraft. Therefore, aircraft carriers were defined as ships that were &quot;designed or adapted primarily for the purpose of carrying and operating aircraft at sea&quot;. The inclusion of aircraft on any other ship does not classify it as an aircraft carrier.

The Soviet Union designated its &quot;Kiev&quot;-class and &quot;Kuznetsov&quot;-class ships as &quot;aircraft-carrying cruisers&quot; because the ships were armed with P-500 and P-700 cruise missiles, which also form the main armament of the &quot;Slava&quot;-class cruiser and the &quot;Kirov&quot;-class battlecruiser. The result was that the Soviet Navy could send its aircraft-carrying cruisers through the Straits in compliance with the convention, but at the same time, the Convention denied access to NATO aircraft carriers, which exceeded the 15,000-ton limit. While the Soviet Union built its aircraft-carrying cruisers in the Black Sea, neither the Soviet Union nor Russia has ever based them in the Black Sea.

Turkey chose to accept the designation of the Soviet aircraft carrying cruisers as aircraft cruisers, as any revision of the convention could leave Turkey with less control over the Straits, and the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea had already established a more liberal passage through other straits. By allowing the Soviet aircraft-carrying cruisers to transit the Straits, Turkey could leave the more restrictive Montreux Convention in place.

==Controversies==
=== Istanbul Canal ===
If it comes to fruition, the long-proposed Kanal Istanbul (Istanbul Canal) project could, according to Turkey, circumvent the Montreux Convention in the 21st century and allow greater Turkish autonomy with respect to the passage of military ships, which are limited in number, tonnage, and weaponry, from the Black Sea to the Sea of Marmara. The canal project would involve building a artificial waterway through Thrace to connect the Sea of Marmara with the Black Sea. That route would run nearly parallel to the Bosporus, but ships transiting it would arguably not be subject to the terms of the Montreux Convention. Currently, the Dardanelles is heavily congested with shipping and there are long waits to pass through the Bosporus. The Kanal project&#x27;s stated purposes are to speed up shipping and boost revenue by providing an alternate maritime route.

In January 2018, the Turkish Prime Minister and a former Transport Minister, Binali Yıldırım, announced that the Kanal would not be subject to the terms of the Montreux Convention. That announcement was received negatively by the Russian media and government, and many have disputed the Turkish government&#x27;s interpretation of the convention.

===Soviet Union===
The convention was repeatedly challenged by the Soviet Union during World War II and the Cold War. As early as 1939, Joseph Stalin sought to reopen the Straits Question and proposed joint Turkish and Soviet control of the Straits, complaining that &quot;a small state [Turkey] supported by Great Britain held a great state by the throat and gave it no outlet&quot;. After the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact was signed by the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov informed his German counterparts that the Soviet Union wished to take military control of the Straits and to establish its own military base there.

The Soviets returned to the issue in 1945 and 1946, demanding a revision of the Montreux Convention at a conference excluding most of its signatories; their demands included a permanent Soviet military presence and joint control of the Straits. These demands were firmly rejected by Turkey, despite an ongoing Soviet &quot;strategy of tension&quot;. For several years after World War II, the Soviets exploited the restriction on the number of foreign warships by ensuring that one of theirs was always in the Straits, thus effectively blocking any state other than Turkey from sending warships through the Straits. Soviet pressure expanded into a full demand to revise the Montreux Convention, which led to the 1946 Turkish Straits crisis and Turkey abandoning its policy of neutrality. In 1947, Turkey became the recipient of US military and economic assistance under the Truman Doctrine of containment and joined NATO along with Greece, in 1952.

===United States===
The United States has not signed the convention but has generally complied with it. The passage of US warships through the Straits has also raised controversy, as the convention forbids the transit of non-Black Sea nations&#x27; warships with guns of a calibre larger than . In the 1960s, the US sent warships carrying 420 mm calibre ASROC missiles through the Straits, prompting Soviet protests. The Turkish government rejected Soviet complaints, pointing out that guided missiles were not guns and that, since such weapons had not existed at the time of the convention, they were not restricted.

According to Jason Ditz of Antiwar.com, the Montreux Convention is an obstacle to a US naval buildup in the Black Sea because of the stipulations regulating warship traffic by nations not sharing a Black Sea coastline. The US thinktank Stratfor has suggested that those stipulations place Turkey&#x27;s relationship to the US and its obligations as a NATO member in conflict with Russia and the regulations of the Montreux Convention.

=== Militarisation of Greek islands ===
The Convention annulled the terms of the earlier Lausanne Treaty on the Straits, including the demilitarisation of the Greek islands of Lemnos and Samothrace. Turkey recognised Greece&#x27;s right to militarise them via a letter sent to the Greek Prime Minister on 6 May 1936 by the Turkish Ambassador in Athens, Ruşen Eşref. The Turkish government reiterated this position when the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Rüştu Aras, in his address to the Turkish National Assembly on the occasion of the ratification of the Montreux Treaty, recognised Greece&#x27;s legal right to deploy troops on Lemnos and Samothrace with the following statement: &quot;The provisions pertaining to the islands of Lemnos and Samothrace, which belong to our neighbour and friendly country Greece and were demilitarised in application of the 1923 Lausanne Treaty, were also abolished by the new Montreux Treaty, which gives us great pleasure&quot;.

As the relationship between Greece and Turkey deteriorated over the following decades, Turkey denied that the treaty affected the Greek islands and sought to bring back into force the relevant part of the Lausanne Treaty on the Straits.

===1994 reforms===
The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which entered into force in November 1994, has prompted calls for the Montreux Convention to be revised and adapted to make it compatible with UNCLOS&#x27;s regime governing straits used for international navigation. However, Turkey&#x27;s longstanding refusal to sign UNCLOS has meant that Montreux remains in force without further amendments. Furthermore, even if Turkey ratified UNCLOS, the Montreux Convention would continue to govern passage in the Straits given its status as a &quot;long-standing international convention&quot; under Article 35(c) of UNCLOS.

The safety of vessels passing through the Bosporus has become more of a concern in recent years as the volume of traffic has increased greatly since the convention was signed: from 4,500 ships passing through in 1934 to 49,304 by 1998. As well as the obvious environmental concerns, the Straits bisect the city of Istanbul, with over 14 million people living on its shores, and so maritime incidents in the Straits pose a considerable risk to public safety. The Convention does not, however, make any provision for the regulation of shipping for the purposes of safety or environmental protection. In January 1994, the Turkish government adopted new &quot;Maritime Traffic Regulations for the Turkish Straits and the Marmara Region&quot; to introduce a new regulatory regime &quot;to ensure the safety of navigation, life and property and to protect the environment in the region&quot; but without violating the Montreux principle of free passage. The new regulations provoked controversy when Russia, Greece, Cyprus, Romania, Ukraine and Bulgaria raised objections. However, they were approved by the International Maritime Organisation on the grounds that they were not intended to prejudice &quot;the rights of any ship using the Straits under international law&quot;. The regulations were revised in November 1998 to address Russian concerns.

=== Russo-Ukrainian War ===
After the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, the Ukrainian government appealed to Turkey to exercise its authority under the Montreux Convention to limit the transit of Russian warships from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea. At least six Russian warships and a submarine had crossed the Turkish straits in February. After initial reluctance, attributed to the country&#x27;s close ties with both Russia and Ukraine, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu announced on 27 February that his government would legally recognise the Russian invasion as a &quot;war&quot;, which provides grounds for implementing the convention with respect to military vessels. This blockage of naval vessels also applies to NATO powers who cannot now move their vessels from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea. However, Çavuşoğlu reiterated that pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Turkey cannot block Russian warships based in the Black Sea from returning to their registered base. Around 27–28 February, Turkey refused permission for three out of four Russian warships to enter the Black Sea as their home base was not on the Black Sea.

Up until 2022, Russia had deployed its &quot;Kilo&quot;-class submarines from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean, arguing that these vessels were ultimately destined for &quot;maintenance&quot; at facilities in the Baltic Sea. There was criticism of this since the submarines would then remain deployed in the Mediterranean for an extensive period of time. Since this was becoming more difficult to justify, one analysis in May 2022 suggested that the Russians may have found a work-around to the problem, potentially using the country&#x27;s internal waterways to permit transit to vessels up to the size of the &quot;Kilo&quot;-class boats between the Black Sea and the Baltic. The ability to use the internal waterways to facilitate such a transit has yet to be confirmed.

Two Russian Federation ships (the missile cruiser &quot;Varyag&quot;, the flagship of the Russian Pacific Fleet, and &quot;Admiral Tributs&quot;, a large anti-submarine destroyer) waited in the Mediterranean seeking to enter the Black Sea for nine months. In October 2022, they were refused permission and left the Mediterranean Sea through the Suez Canal.

On 2 January 2024 Turkey refused passage through the strait to two minehunters donated by the British Royal Navy to the Ukrainian Navy pursuant to the Convention.

<doc id="20455" wikidata="Q41421" url="?curid=20455" title="Michael Jordan">
<text>Michael Jeffrey Jordan (born February 17, 1963), also known by his initials MJ, is an American businessman and former professional basketball player. He played 15 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) between 1984 and 2003, winning six NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls. He was integral in popularizing basketball and the NBA around the world in the 1980s and 1990s, becoming a global cultural icon.

Jordan played college basketball with the North Carolina Tar Heels. As a freshman, he was a member of the Tar Heels&#x27; national championship team in 1982. Jordan joined the Bulls in 1984 as the third overall draft pick and quickly emerged as a league star, entertaining crowds with his prolific scoring while gaining a reputation as one of the best defensive players. His leaping ability, demonstrated by performing slam dunks from the free-throw line in Slam Dunk Contests, earned him the nicknames &quot;Air Jordan&quot; and &quot;His Airness&quot;. Jordan won his first NBA title with the Bulls in 1991 and followed that achievement with titles in 1992 and 1993, securing a three-peat. Citing physical and mental exhaustion from basketball and superstardom, Jordan abruptly retired from basketball before the 1993–94 NBA season to play Minor League Baseball in the Chicago White Sox organization. He returned to the Bulls in March 1995 and led them to three more championships in 1996, 1997, and 1998, as well as a then-record 72 regular season wins in the 1995–96 NBA season. Jordan retired for the second time in January 1999, returning for two more NBA seasons from 2001 to 2003 as a member of the Washington Wizards. He was selected to play for the United States national team during his college and NBA careers, winning four gold medals—at the 1983 Pan American Games, 1984 Summer Olympics, 1992 Tournament of the Americas and 1992 Summer Olympics—while also being undefeated.

Jordan&#x27;s individual accolades include six NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) awards, ten NBA scoring titles (both all-time records), five NBA MVP awards, 10 All-NBA First Team designations, nine All-Defensive First Team honors, fourteen NBA All-Star Game selections, three NBA All-Star Game MVP awards, three NBA steals titles, and the 1988 NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award. He holds the NBA records for career regular season scoring average (30.1 points per game) and career playoff scoring average (33.4 points per game). He is one of only eight players to achieve the basketball Triple Crown. In 1999, Jordan was named the 20th century&#x27;s greatest North American athlete by ESPN and was second to Babe Ruth on the Associated Press&#x27; list of athletes of the century. Jordan was twice inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, once in 2009 for his individual career, and again in 2010 as part of the 1992 United States men&#x27;s Olympic basketball team (&quot;The Dream Team&quot;). He became a member of the United States Olympic Hall of Fame in 2009, a member of the North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame in 2010, and an individual member of the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2015 and a &quot;Dream Team&quot; member in 2017. Jordan was named to the NBA 50th Anniversary Team in 1996 and to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021. The trophy for the NBA Most Valuable Player Award is named in his honor.

One of the most effectively marketed athletes of his generation, Jordan made many product endorsements. He fueled the success of Nike&#x27;s Air Jordan sneakers, which were introduced in 1984 and remain popular. Jordan starred as himself in the live-action/animation hybrid film &quot;Space Jam&quot; (1996) and was the central focus of the Emmy-winning documentary series &quot;The Last Dance&quot; (2020). He became part-owner and head of basketball operations for the Charlotte Hornets (then named the Bobcats) in 2006 and bought a controlling interest in 2010, before selling his majority stake in 2023. Jordan is also a co-owner of 23XI Racing in the NASCAR Cup Series. In 2016, he became the first billionaire player in NBA history. That same year, President Barack Obama awarded Jordan the Presidential Medal of Freedom. , his net worth is estimated at $3.5 billion by &quot;Forbes&quot;, making him one of the richest celebrities.

== Early life ==
Michael Jeffrey Jordan was born at Cumberland Hospital in Brooklyn, New York City, on February 17, 1963, to bank employee Deloris (née Peoples) and equipment supervisor James R. Jordan Sr. He has two older brothers, James Jr. and Larry, as well as an older sister named Deloris and a younger sister named Roslyn. Jordan and his siblings were raised Methodist.

In 1968, the family moved to Wilmington, North Carolina. Jordan attended Emsley A. Laney High School, where he played basketball, baseball, and football. He tried out for the basketball varsity team during his sophomore year, but at a height of , he was deemed too short. Motivated to prove his worth, Jordan became the star of Laney&#x27;s junior varsity team and tallied some 40-point games. The following summer, he grew and trained rigorously. Upon earning a spot on the varsity roster, Jordan averaged more than 25 points per game (ppg) over his final two seasons of high school play. As a senior, he was selected for the 1981 McDonald&#x27;s All-American Game and scored 30 points, after averaging 26.8 ppg, 11.6 rebounds (rpg), and 10.1 assists per game (apg) for the season.

Jordan was recruited by numerous college basketball programs, including Duke, North Carolina, South Carolina, Syracuse, and Virginia. In 1981, he accepted a basketball scholarship to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where Jordan majored in cultural geography. He chose this field of study because of its relationship to meteorology, as Jordan was interested in a career as a meteorologist.

== College career ==

As a freshman in coach Dean Smith&#x27;s team-oriented system, Jordan was named ACC Freshman of the Year after averaging 13.4 ppg on 53.4% shooting (field goal percentage). He made the game-winning jump shot in the 1982 NCAA Championship game against Georgetown, which was led by future NBA rival Patrick Ewing. Jordan later described this shot as the major turning point in his basketball career. During his three seasons with the Tar Heels, Jordan averaged 17.7 ppg on 54.0% shooting and added 5.0 rpg and 1.8 apg.

Jordan was selected by consensus to the NCAA All-American First Team in both his sophomore (1983) and junior (1984) seasons. After winning the Naismith and the Wooden College Player of the Year awards in 1984, Jordan left North Carolina a year before his scheduled graduation to enter the 1984 NBA draft. Jordan returned to North Carolina to complete his degree in 1986, when he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in geography. In 2002, Jordan was named to the ACC 50th Anniversary men&#x27;s basketball team honoring the 50 greatest players in ACC history.

== Professional career ==

=== Chicago Bulls (1984–1993; 1995–1998) ===

==== Early NBA years (1984–1987) ====
The Chicago Bulls selected Jordan with the third overall pick of the 1984 NBA draft after Hakeem Olajuwon (Houston Rockets) and Sam Bowie (Portland Trail Blazers). One of the primary reasons why Jordan was not drafted sooner was because the first two teams were in need of a center. Trail Blazers general manager Stu Inman contended that it was not a matter of drafting a center but more a matter of taking Bowie over Jordan, in part because Portland already had Clyde Drexler, who was a guard with similar skills to Jordan. Citing Bowie&#x27;s injury-laden college career, ESPN named the Blazers&#x27; choice of Bowie as the worst draft pick in North American professional sports history.

Jordan made his NBA debut at Chicago Stadium on October 26, 1984, and scored 16 points. In 2021, a ticket stub from the game sold at auction for $264,000, setting a record for a collectible ticket stub. During his rookie 1984–85 season with the Bulls, Jordan averaged 28.2 ppg on 51.5% shooting. He helped the Bulls improve from 27–55 to 38–44 and qualify for the postseason for the first time since the 1980–81 season. Jordan quickly became a fan favorite even in opposing arenas. Roy S. Johnson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Jordan as &quot;the phenomenal rookie of the Bulls&quot; in November, and he appeared on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; with the heading &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; in December. The fans voted in Jordan as an All-Star starter during his rookie season. Controversy arose before the 1985 NBA All-Star Game when word surfaced that several veteran players, led by Isiah Thomas, were upset by the amount of attention Jordan was receiving. This led to a so-called &quot;freeze-out&quot; on Jordan, where players refused to pass the ball to him. The controversy left Jordan relatively unaffected when he returned to regular season play, and he would go on to be voted the NBA Rookie of the Year. The Bulls lost to the Milwaukee Bucks in four games in the first round of the playoffs.

An often-cited moment was on August 26, 1985, when Jordan shook the arena during a Nike exhibition game in Trieste, Italy, by shattering the glass of the backboard with a dunk. The moment was filmed and is often referred to as an important milestone in Jordan&#x27;s rise. The shoes Jordan wore during the game were auctioned in August 2020 for $615,000, a record for a pair of sneakers. Jordan&#x27;s 1985–86 season was cut short when he broke his foot in the third game of the year, causing him to miss 64 games. The Bulls made the playoffs despite Jordan&#x27;s injury and a 30–52 record, at the time the fifth-worst record of any team to qualify for the playoffs in NBA history. Jordan recovered in time to participate in the postseason and performed well upon his return. On April 20 at the Boston Garden, in Game 2 of the First Round, a 135–131 double overtime loss to the eventual NBA champion Boston Celtics, Jordan scored a playoff career-high 63 points, breaking Elgin Baylor&#x27;s single-game playoff scoring record. The Celtics team, though, swept the series in three games.

Jordan completely recovered in time for the 1986–87 season, and had one of the most prolific scoring seasons in NBA history; he became the only player other than Wilt Chamberlain to score 3,000 points in a season, averaging a league-high 37.1 ppg on 48.2% shooting. Jordan also demonstrated his defensive prowess, as he became the first player in NBA history to record 200 steals and 100 blocked shots in a season. Despite Jordan&#x27;s success, Magic Johnson won the NBA Most Valuable Player Award. The Bulls reached 40 wins, and advanced to the playoffs for the third consecutive year but were again swept by the Celtics.

==== Pistons roadblock (1987–1990) ====
Jordan led the league in scoring during the 1987–88 season, averaging 35.0 ppg on 53.5% shooting, and won his first league MVP Award. He was named the NBA Defensive Player of the Year after averaging 1.6 blocks per game (bpg), a league-high 3.1 steals per game (spg), and leading the Bulls defense to the fewest points per game allowed in the league. The Bulls finished 50–32, and made it past the first round of the playoffs for the first time in Jordan&#x27;s career, as they defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in five games. In the Eastern Conference Semifinals, the Bulls lost in five games to the more experienced Detroit Pistons, who were led by Isiah Thomas and a group of physical players known as the &quot;Bad Boys&quot;.

In the 1988–89 season, Jordan again led the league in scoring, averaging 32.5 ppg on 53.8% shooting from the field, along with 8.0 rpg and 8.0 apg. During the season, Sam Vincent, Chicago&#x27;s point guard, was having trouble running the offense, and Jordan expressed his frustration with head coach Doug Collins, who then put Jordan at point guard. In his time as a point guard, Jordan had 10 triple-doubles in 11 games, with averages of 33.6 ppg, 11.4 rpg, 10.8 apg, 2.9 spg, and 0.8 bpg on 51% shooting.

The Bulls finished with a 47–35 record, and advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals, defeating the Cavaliers and New York Knicks along the way. The Cavaliers series included a career highlight for Jordan when he hit &quot;The Shot&quot; over Craig Ehlo at the buzzer in the fifth and final game of the series. In the Eastern Conference Finals, the Pistons again defeated the Bulls, this time in six games, by utilizing their &quot;Jordan Rules&quot; method of guarding Jordan, which consisted of double and triple teaming him every time he touched the ball.

The Bulls entered the 1989–90 season as a team on the rise, with their core group of Jordan and young improving players like Scottie Pippen and Horace Grant, and under the guidance of new coach Phil Jackson. On March 28, 1990, Jordan scored a career-high 69 points in a 117–113 road win over the Cavaliers. He averaged a league-leading 33.6 ppg on 52.6% shooting, to go with 6.9 rpg and 6.3 apg, in leading the Bulls to a 55–27 record. They again advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals after beating the Bucks and Philadelphia 76ers; despite pushing the series to seven games, the Bulls lost to the Pistons for the third consecutive season.

==== First three-peat (1991–1993) ====

After the Bulls&#x27; previous losses to the Pistons, Phil Jackson, along with assistant coach Tex Winter, focused on implementing the triangle offense to counteract the Pistons&#x27; defense and other teams that heavily targeted Jordan. This system, however, required Jordan to adjust his playing style. In his book &quot;Eleven Rings&quot;, Jackson recalled, &quot;I was planning to ask Michael to reduce the number of shots he took so that other members of the team could get more involved in the offense. I knew this would be a challenge for him.&quot; In &quot;The Last Dance&quot;, Jordan admitted he was initially reluctant to back the system. Nevertheless, he eventually embraced the change, which led to success for the team.

In the 1990–91 season, Jordan won his second MVP award after averaging 31.5 ppg on 53.9% shooting, 6.0 rpg, and 5.5 apg for the regular season. The Bulls finished in first place in their division for the first time in sixteen years and set a franchise record with 61 wins in the regular season. With Scottie Pippen developing into an All-Star, the Bulls had elevated their play. The Bulls defeated the New York Knicks and the Philadelphia 76ers in the opening two rounds of the playoffs. They advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals where their rival, the Detroit Pistons, awaited them; this time, the Bulls beat the Pistons in a four-game sweep.

The Bulls advanced to the Finals for the first time in franchise history to face the Los Angeles Lakers. The Bulls won the series in five games, and compiled a 15–2 playoff record along the way. Perhaps the best-known moment of the series came in Game 2 when, attempting a dunk, Jordan avoided a potential Sam Perkins block by switching the ball from his right hand to his left in mid-air to lay the shot into the basket. In his first Finals appearance, Jordan had 31.2 ppg on 56% shooting from the field, 11.4 apg, 6.6 rpg, 2.8 spg, and 1.4 bpg. Jordan won his first NBA Finals MVP award and cried while holding the Finals trophy.

Jordan and the Bulls continued their dominance in the 1991–92 season, establishing a 67–15 record, topping their franchise record from the 1990–91 campaign. Jordan won his second consecutive MVP award with averages of 30.1 ppg, 6.4 rpg, and 6.1 apg on 52% shooting. After winning a physical seven-game series over the New York Knicks in the second round of the playoffs and finishing off the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Conference Finals in six games, the Bulls met Clyde Drexler and the Portland Trail Blazers in the Finals. The media, hoping to recreate a Magic–Bird rivalry, highlighted the similarities between &quot;Air&quot; Jordan and Clyde &quot;The Glide&quot; during the pre-Finals hype.

In a Game 1 victory, Jordan scored a Finals-record 35 points in the first half, including a record-setting six three-point field goals. After the sixth three-pointer, he jogged down the court shrugging as he looked courtside. Marv Albert, who broadcast the game, later stated that it was as if Jordan was saying: &quot;I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m doing this.&quot; The Bulls went on to defeat the Blazers in six games. Jordan was named Finals MVP for the second year in a row, and finished the series averaging 35.8 ppg, 4.8 rpg, and 6.5 apg, while shooting 52.6% from the floor.

In the 1992–93 season, despite a 32.6 ppg, 6.7 rpg, and 5.5 apg campaign, including a second-place finish in Defensive Player of the Year voting, Jordan&#x27;s streak of consecutive MVP seasons ended, as he lost the award to his friend Charles Barkley, upsetting him. Jordan and the Bulls met Barkley and his Phoenix Suns in the 1993 NBA Finals. The Bulls won their third NBA championship on a game-winning shot by John Paxson and a last-second block by Horace Grant, but Jordan was once again Chicago&#x27;s leader. He averaged a Finals-record 41.0 ppg during the six-game series, and became the first player in NBA history to win three consecutive Finals MVP awards. Jordan scored more than 30 points in every game of the series, including 40 or more points in four consecutive games. With his third Finals triumph, Jordan capped off a seven-year run where he attained seven scoring titles and three championships, but there were signs that Jordan was tiring of his massive celebrity and all of the non-basketball hassles in his life.

==== Gambling ====
During the 1993 NBA playoffs, Jordan was seen gambling in Atlantic City, New Jersey, the night before Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the New York Knicks. The previous year, he admitted that he had to cover $57,000 in gambling losses, and author Richard Esquinas wrote a book in 1993 claiming he had won $1.25 million from Jordan on the golf course. David Stern, the commissioner of the NBA, denied in 1995 and 2006 that Jordan&#x27;s 1993 retirement was a secret suspension by the league for gambling, but the rumor spread widely.

In 2005, Jordan discussed his gambling with Ed Bradley of &quot;60 Minutes&quot; and admitted that he made reckless decisions. Jordan stated: Yeah, I&#x27;ve gotten myself into situations where I would not walk away and I&#x27;ve pushed the envelope. Is that compulsive? Yeah, it depends on how you look at it. If you&#x27;re willing to jeopardize your livelihood and your family, then yeah. When Bradley asked him if his gambling ever got to the level where it jeopardized his livelihood or family, Jordan replied: &quot;No.&quot; In 2010, Ron Shelton, director of &quot;Jordan Rides the Bus&quot;, said that he began working on the documentary believing that the NBA had suspended him, but that research &quot;convinced [him it] was nonsense&quot;.

==== First retirement and stint in Minor League Baseball (1993–1995) ====

On October 6, 1993, Jordan announced his retirement, saying that he lost his desire to play basketball. He later said that the murder of his father three months earlier helped shape his decision. James R. Jordan Sr. was murdered on July 23, 1993, at a highway rest area in Lumberton, North Carolina, by two teenagers, Daniel Green and Larry Martin Demery, who carjacked his Lexus. His body, dumped in a South Carolina swamp, was not discovered until August 3. Green and Demery were sentenced to life imprisonment. However, in &quot;The Last Dance&quot;, Jordan stated that he retired due to physical and mental exhaustion from basketball and superstardom.

Jordan was close to his father; as a child, Jordan imitated the way his father stuck out his tongue while absorbed in work. Jordan later adopted it as his own signature, often displaying it as he drove to the basket. In 1996, Jordan founded a Chicago-area Boys &amp; Girls Club and dedicated it to his father. In his 1998 autobiography &quot;For the Love of the Game&quot;, Jordan wrote that he was preparing for retirement as early as the summer of 1992. The added exhaustion due to the &quot;Dream Team&quot; run in the 1992 Summer Olympics solidified Jordan&#x27;s feelings about the game and his celebrity status. Jordan&#x27;s announcement sent shock waves throughout the NBA and appeared on the front pages of newspapers around the world.

Jordan further surprised the sports world by signing a Minor League Baseball (MiLB) contract with the Chicago White Sox on February 7, 1994. He reported to spring training in Sarasota, Florida, and was assigned to the team&#x27;s minor league system on March 31. Jordan said that this decision was made to pursue the dream of his late father, who always envisioned his son as a Major League Baseball (MLB) player. The White Sox were owned by Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf, who continued to honor Jordan&#x27;s basketball contract during the years he played baseball.

In 1994, Jordan played for the Birmingham Barons, a Double-A minor league affiliate of the Chicago White Sox, batting .202 with three home runs, 51 runs batted in, 30 stolen bases, 114 strikeouts, 51 bases on balls, and 11 errors. His strikeout total led the team and his games played tied for the team lead. His 30 stolen bases were second on the team only to Doug Brady. Jordan also appeared for the Scottsdale Scorpions in the 1994 Arizona Fall League, batting .252 against the top prospects in baseball. On November 1, 1994, his 23 was retired by the Bulls in a ceremony that included the erection of a permanent sculpture known as &quot;The Spirit&quot; outside the new United Center.

==== Return to the NBA (1995) ====
The Bulls went 55–27 in 1993–94 without Jordan in the lineup and lost to the New York Knicks in the second round of the playoffs. In March 1995, Jordan decided to quit baseball because he feared he might become a replacement player during the Major League Baseball strike. During the 1994–95 season, Jordan returned to the Bulls midway through the season. On March 18, 1995, Jordan announced his comeback to the NBA in a two-word press release: &quot;I&#x27;m back.&quot; The next day, Jordan took to the court with the Bulls to face the Indiana Pacers in Indianapolis, scoring 19 points. The game had the highest Nielsen rating of any regular season NBA game since 1975. Although he could have worn his original number even though the Bulls retired it, Jordan wore No. 45, his baseball number.

Despite his 18-month hiatus from the NBA, Jordan played well, making a game-winning jump shot against Atlanta in his fourth game back. He scored 55 points in his next game, against the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden on March 28, 1995. Boosted by Jordan&#x27;s comeback, the Bulls went 13–4 to make the playoffs and advanced to the Eastern Conference Semifinals against the Orlando Magic. At the end of Game 1, Orlando&#x27;s Nick Anderson stripped Jordan from behind, leading to the game-winning basket for the Magic; he later commented that Jordan &quot;didn&#x27;t look like the old Michael Jordan&quot;, and said, &quot;No. 45 doesn&#x27;t explode like No. 23 used to&quot;.

Jordan responded by scoring 38 points in the next game, which Chicago won. Before the game, Jordan decided that he would immediately resume wearing his former No. 23. The Bulls were fined $25,000 for failing to report the impromptu number change to the NBA. Jordan was fined an additional $5,000 for opting to wear white sneakers when the rest of the Bulls wore black. He averaged 31 ppg in the playoffs, but Orlando won the series in six games.

==== Second three-peat (1996–1998) ====
Jordan was freshly motivated by the playoff defeat, and he trained aggressively for the 1995–96 season. The Bulls were strengthened by the addition of rebound specialist Dennis Rodman, and the team dominated the league, starting the season at 41–3. The Bulls finished with the best regular season record in NBA history, 72–10, a mark broken two decades later by the 2015–16 Golden State Warriors. Jordan led the league in scoring with 30.4 ppg, and he won the league&#x27;s regular season and All-Star Game MVP awards.

In the playoffs, the Bulls lost only three games in four series (Miami Heat 3–0, New York Knicks 4–1, and Orlando Magic 4–0), as they defeated the Seattle SuperSonics 4–2 in the NBA Finals to win their fourth championship. The series was one of the tougher ones for Jordan as he had a 41.5% field goal percentage and his scoring average dropped nearly nine points from his average during the rest of the playoffs. Nevertheless, Jordan was named Finals MVP for a record fourth time; he achieved only the second sweep of the MVP awards in the All-Star Game, regular season, and NBA Finals after Willis Reed in the 1969–70 season. Upon winning the championship, his first since his father&#x27;s murder, Jordan reacted emotionally, clutching the game ball and crying on the locker room floor.

In the 1996–97 season, the Bulls stood at a 69–11 record but ended the season by losing their final two games to finish the year 69–13, missing out on a second consecutive 70-win season. The Bulls again advanced to the Finals, where they faced the Utah Jazz. That team included Karl Malone, who had beaten Jordan for the NBA MVP award in a tight race (986–957). The series against the Jazz featured two of the more memorable clutch moments of Jordan&#x27;s career. He won Game 1 for the Bulls with a buzzer-beating jump shot. In Game 5, with the series tied 2–2, Jordan played despite being feverish and dehydrated from a stomach virus. In what is known as &quot;The Flu Game&quot;, Jordan scored 38 points, including the game-winning three-pointer with 25 seconds remaining. The Bulls won 90–88 and went on to win the series in six games. For the fifth time in as many Finals appearances, Jordan received the Finals MVP award. During the 1997 NBA All-Star Game, he posted the first triple-double in All-Star Game history in a victorious effort, but the MVP award went to Glen Rice.
The Bulls compiled a 62–20 record in the 1997–98 season. Jordan led the league with 28.7 ppg, securing his fifth regular season MVP award, plus honors for All-NBA First Team, First Defensive Team, and the All-Star Game MVP. The Bulls won the Eastern Conference Championship for a third straight season, including surviving a seven-game series with the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals; it was the first time Jordan had played in a Game 7 since the 1992 Eastern Conference Semifinals with the New York Knicks. After winning, they moved on for a rematch with the Jazz in the Finals.

The Bulls returned to the Delta Center for Game 6 on June 14, 1998, leading the series 3–2. Jordan executed a series of plays, considered to be one of the greatest clutch performances in NBA Finals history. With 41.9 seconds remaining and the Bulls trailing 86–83, Phil Jackson called a timeout. When play resumed, Jordan received the inbound pass, drove to the basket, and sank a shot over several Jazz defenders, cutting Utah&#x27;s lead to 86–85. The Jazz brought the ball upcourt and passed the ball to Malone, who was set up in the low post and was being guarded by Rodman. Malone jostled with Rodman and caught the pass, but Jordan cut behind him and stole the ball out of his hands.

Jordan then dribbled down the court and paused, eyeing his defender, Jazz guard Bryon Russell. With 10 seconds remaining, Jordan started to dribble right, then crossed over to his left, possibly pushing off Russell, although the officials did not call a foul. With 5.2 seconds left, Jordan made the climactic shot of his Bulls career, a top-key jumper over a stumbling Russell to give Chicago an 87–86 lead. Afterwards, the Jazz&#x27; John Stockton narrowly missed a game-winning three-pointer, and the buzzer sounded as Jordan and the Bulls won their sixth NBA championship, achieving a second three-peat in the decade. Once again, Jordan was voted Finals MVP for a record sixth time, having led all scorers by averaging 33.5 ppg, including 45 in the deciding Game 6. The 1998 Finals holds the highest television rating of any Finals series, and Game 6 holds the highest television rating of any game in NBA history.

==== Second retirement (1999–2001) ====

With Phil Jackson&#x27;s contract expiring, the pending departures of Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman looming, and being in the latter stages of an owner-induced lockout of NBA players, Jordan retired for the second time on January 13, 1999. On January 19, 2000, Jordan returned to the NBA not as a player but as part owner and president of basketball operations for the Washington Wizards. Jordan&#x27;s responsibilities with the Wizards were comprehensive, as he controlled all aspects of the Wizards&#x27; basketball operations, and had the final say in all personnel matters; opinions of Jordan as a basketball executive were mixed. He managed to purge the team of several highly paid, unpopular players (like forward Juwan Howard and point guard Rod Strickland) but used the first pick in the 2001 NBA draft to select high school student Kwame Brown, who did not live up to expectations and was traded away after four seasons.

Despite his January 1999 claim that he was &quot;99.9% certain&quot; he would never play another NBA game, Jordan expressed interest in making another comeback in the summer of 2001, this time with his new team. Inspired by the NHL comeback of his friend Mario Lemieux the previous winter, Jordan spent much of the spring and summer of 2001 in training, holding several invitation-only camps for NBA players in Chicago. Jordan hired his old Chicago Bulls head coach, Doug Collins, as Washington&#x27;s coach for the upcoming season, a decision that many saw as foreshadowing another Jordan return.

=== Washington Wizards (2001–2003) ===
On September 25, 2001, Jordan announced his return to the NBA to play for the Washington Wizards, indicating his intention to donate his salary as a player to a relief effort for the victims of the September 11 attacks. In an injury-plagued 2001–02 season, Jordan led the team in scoring (22.9 ppg), assists (5.2 apg), and steals (1.4 spg), and was an MVP candidate, as he led the Wizards to a winning record and playoff contention; Jordan would eventually finish 13th in the MVP ballot. After he suffered torn cartilage in his right knee, and subsequent knee soreness, the Wizards missed the playoffs, and Jordan&#x27;s season ended after only 60 games, the fewest he had played in a regular season since playing 17 games after returning from his first retirement during the 1994–95 season. Jordan started 53 of his 60 games for the season, averaging 24.3 ppg, 5.4 apg, and 6.0 rpg, and shooting 41.9% from the field in his 53 starts. His last seven appearances were in a reserve role, in which he averaged just over 20 minutes per game. The Wizards finished the season with a 37–45 record, an 18-game improvement.
Playing in his 14th and final NBA All-Star Game in 2003, Jordan passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the all-time leading scorer in All-Star Game history, a record since broken by Kobe Bryant and LeBron James. That year, Jordan was the only Washington player to play in all 82 games, starting in 67 of them as he came off the bench in 15. Jordan averaged 20.0 ppg, 6.1 rpg, 3.8 assists, and 1.5 spg per game. He also shot 45% from the field, and 82% from the free-throw line. Although Jordan turned 40 during the season, he scored 20 or more points 42 times, 30 or more points nine times, and 40 or more points three times. On February 21, 2003, Jordan became the first 40-year-old to tally 43 points in an NBA game. During his stint with the Wizards, all of Jordan&#x27;s home games at the MCI Center were sold out and the Wizards were the second most-watched team in the NBA, averaging 20,172 fans a game at home and 19,311 on the road. Jordan&#x27;s final two seasons did not result in a playoff appearance for the Wizards, and he was often unsatisfied with the play of those around him. At several points, Jordan openly criticized his teammates to the media, citing their lack of focus and intensity, notably that of Kwame Brown, the number-one draft pick in the 2001 NBA draft.

==== Final retirement (2003) ====
With the recognition that 2002–03 would be Jordan&#x27;s final season, tributes were paid to him throughout the NBA. In his final game at the United Center in Chicago, which was his old home court, Jordan received a four-minute standing ovation. The Miami Heat retired the No. 23 jersey on April 11, 2003, even though Jordan never played for the team. At the 2003 All-Star Game, Jordan was offered a starting spot from Tracy McGrady and Allen Iverson but refused both; he accepted the spot of Vince Carter. Jordan played in his final NBA game on April 16, 2003, in Philadelphia. After scoring 13 points in the game, Jordan went to the bench with 4 minutes and 13 seconds left in the third quarter and his team trailing the Philadelphia 76ers 75–56. Just after the start of the fourth quarter, the First Union Center crowd began chanting &quot;We want Mike!&quot; After much encouragement from coach Doug Collins, Jordan finally rose from the bench and re-entered the game, replacing Larry Hughes with 2:35 remaining. At 1:45, Jordan was intentionally fouled by the 76ers&#x27; Eric Snow, and stepped to the line to make both free throws. After the second foul shot, the 76ers in-bounded the ball to rookie John Salmons, who in turn was intentionally fouled by Bobby Simmons one second later, stopping time so that Jordan could return to the bench. He received a three-minute standing ovation from his teammates, his opponents, the officials, and the crowd of 21,257 fans.

== National team career ==

Jordan made his debut as a college player for the U.S. national basketball team at the 1983 Pan American Games in Caracas, Venezuela. He led the team in scoring with 17.3 ppg as the U.S., coached by Jack Hartman, won the gold medal. The following year, Jordan won another gold medal in the 1984 Summer Olympics. The 1984 U.S. team was coached by Bob Knight and featured young players such as Patrick Ewing, Sam Perkins, Chris Mullin, Steve Alford, and Wayman Tisdale. Jordan led the team in scoring, averaging 17.1 ppg for the tournament.

In 1992, Jordan, now an NBA player, was a member of the star-studded squad that was dubbed the &quot;Dream Team&quot;, which included Larry Bird and Magic Johnson. The team won two gold medals: the first in the 1992 Tournament of the Americas, and the second in the 1992 Summer Olympics. Jordan was the only player to start all eight games in the Olympics. He averaged 14.9 ppg on 45% shooting from the field and 68% from the free-throw line, and was second on the team in scoring. He was undefeated in the four tournaments he played for the United States national team, and Jordan won all 30 games he took part in.

Jordan was a shooting guard who could also play as a small forward, the position he would primarily play during his second return to professional basketball with the Washington Wizards. Jordan was known throughout his career as a strong clutch performer. With the Bulls, he decided 25 games with field goals or free throws in the last 30 seconds, including two NBA Finals games and five other playoff contests. His competitiveness was visible in his prolific trash talk and well-known work ethic. Jordan often used perceived slights to fuel his performances. Sportswriter Wright Thompson described him as &quot;a killer, in the Darwinian sense of the word, immediately sensing and attacking someone&#x27;s weakest spot&quot;. As the Bulls organization built the franchise around Jordan, management had to trade away players who were not &quot;tough enough&quot; to compete with him in practice. To improve his defense, Jordan spent hours studying film of opponents. On offense, he relied more upon instinct and improvization. Jordan&#x27;s fierce competitiveness greatly impacted his teammates, sometimes motivating them but also leading to tension and alienation.

Noted as a durable player, Jordan did not miss four or more games while active for a full season from 1986–87 to 2001–02, when he injured his right knee. Of the 15 seasons Jordan was in the NBA, he played all 82 regular season games nine times. Jordan has frequently cited David Thompson, Walter Davis, and Jerry West as influences. Confirmed at the start of his career, and possibly later on, Jordan had a special &quot;Love of the Game Clause&quot; written into his contract, which was unusual at the time, and allowed him to play basketball against anyone at any time, anywhere.

Jordan had a versatile offensive game and was capable of aggressively driving to the basket as well as drawing fouls from his opponents at a high rate. His 8,772 free throw attempts are the 11th-highest total in NBA history. Early in Jordan&#x27;s career, he weighed in at around and was more athletic in terms of play style. As his career progressed, Jordan also developed the ability to post up his opponents and score with his trademark fadeaway jump shot, using his leaping ability to avoid block attempts. According to Hubie Brown, this move alone made Jordan nearly unstoppable. Around this time, he bulked up to in order to adapt to the increased physicality of NBA defenses during the 1990s, sacrificing some athleticism for added strength in the post. Despite media criticism by some as a selfish player early in his career, Jordan was willing to defer to this teammates, with a career average of 5.3 apg and a season-high of 8.0 apg. For a guard, Jordan was also a good rebounder, finishing with 6.2 rpg. Defensively, he averaged 2.3 spg and 0.8 bpg.

The three-point field goal was not Jordan&#x27;s strength, especially in his early years. Later on in his career, Jordan improved his three-point shooting, and finished his career with a three-point field goal percentage of 32%. His best years shooting from three occurred in the 1989–90 and 1992–93 seasons, where he shot 37% and 35% from three, respectively (Jordan did shoot higher percentages from 1994 to 1997, but in those years, the three-point line was temporarily moved inwards). 

Overall, Jordan&#x27;s effective field goal percentage was 51%, and he had six seasons with at least 50% shooting, five of which were consecutive (1988–1992). Jordan also shot 51% and 50% from the field, and 30% and 33% from three-point range, throughout his first and second retirements, respectively, finishing his Bulls career with 31.5 points per game on 50.5 FG% shooting and his overall career with 49.7 FG% shooting.

In 1988, Jordan was honored with the NBA Defensive Player of the Year and the Most Valuable Player awards, becoming the first NBA player to win both awards in a career let alone season. He also set both seasonal and career records for blocked shots by a guard, and combined this with his ball-thieving ability to become a standout defensive player. Despite his defensive prowess, the 1988 season has come under scrutiny due to the large discrepancy between Jordan&#x27;s steals&#x27; numbers at home versus on the road. Such stat inflation was common, and a 2024 study by Tom Haberstroh found that there were games where Jordan was often credited with steals that could not have happened. For example, in one game, he was credited with more steals than the opposing team had live-ball turnovers. Jordan ranks fourth in NBA history in total steals with 2,514, trailing John Stockton, Jason Kidd and Chris Paul. Jerry West often stated that he was more impressed with Jordan&#x27;s defensive contributions than his offensive ones. Doc Rivers declared Jordan &quot;the best superstar defender in the history of the game&quot;.

Jordan was known to have strong eyesight. Broadcaster Al Michaels said that Jordan was able to read baseball box scores on a television clearly from about away. During the 2001 NBA Finals, Phil Jackson compared Jordan&#x27;s dominance to Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, stating: &quot;Michael would get fouled on every play and still have to play through it and just clear himself for shots instead and would rise to that occasion.&quot;

== Legacy ==

Jordan&#x27;s talent was clear from his first NBA season; by November 1984, he was being compared to Julius Erving. Larry Bird said that rookie Jordan was the best player he ever saw, and that Jordan was &quot;one of a kind&quot;, and comparable to Wayne Gretzky as an athlete. In his first game in Madison Square Garden against the New York Knicks, Jordan received a near minute-long standing ovation. After Jordan established the single game playoff record of 63 points against the Boston Celtics on April 20, 1986, Bird described him as &quot;God disguised as Michael Jordan&quot;.

Jordan led the NBA in scoring in 10 seasons (NBA record) and tied Wilt Chamberlain&#x27;s record of seven consecutive scoring titles. Jordan was a fixture of the NBA All-Defensive First Team, making the roster nine times (NBA record shared with Gary Payton, Kevin Garnett, and Kobe Bryant). He also holds the top career regular season and playoff scoring averages of 30.1 and 33.4 ppg, respectively. By 1998, the season of his Finals-winning shot against the Jazz, he was well known throughout the league as a clutch performer. In the regular season, Jordan was the Bulls&#x27; primary threat in the final seconds of a close game and in the playoffs; he would always ask for the ball at crunch time. Jordan&#x27;s total of 5,987 points in the playoffs is the second-highest among NBA career playoff scoring leaders. He scored 32,292 points in the regular season, placing him fifth on the NBA all-time scoring list behind LeBron James, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Karl Malone, and Bryant.

With five regular season MVPs (tied for second place with Bill Russell—only Abdul-Jabbar has won more, with six), six Finals MVPs (NBA record), and three NBA All-Star Game MVPs, Jordan is among the most decorated players in NBA history. He finished among the top three in regular season MVP voting 10 times. Jordan was named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996, and selected to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021. He is one of only eight players in history to achieve the basketball Triple Crown—winning an NCAA championship, an NBA championship, and an Olympic gold medal (doing so twice with the 1984 and 1992 U.S. men&#x27;s basketball teams). Since 1976, the year of the ABA–NBA merger, Jordan and Pippen are the only two players to win six NBA Finals playing for one team. In the All-Star Game fan ballot, Jordan received the most votes nine times.
Many of Jordan&#x27;s contemporaries have said that he is the greatest basketball player of all time. In 1999, an ESPN survey of journalists, athletes and other sports figures ranked Jordan the greatest North American athlete of the 20th century. Jordan placed second to Babe Ruth in the Associated Press&#x27; December 1999 list of 20th century athletes. The Associated Press also voted Jordan the greatest basketball player of the 20th century. He has also appeared on the front cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; a record 50 times. In the September 1996 issue of &quot;Sport&quot;, which was the publication&#x27;s 50th-anniversary issue, Jordan was named the greatest athlete of the past 50 years.

Jordan&#x27;s athletic leaping ability, highlighted in his back-to-back Slam Dunk Contest championships in 1987 and 1988, is credited by many people with having influenced a generation of young players. Several NBA players, including James and Dwyane Wade, have stated that they considered Jordan as their role model while they were growing up. Commentators have also dubbed a number of next-generation players &quot;the next Michael Jordan&quot; upon their entry to the NBA, including Penny Hardaway, Grant Hill, Allen Iverson, Bryant, Vince Carter, James, and Wade. Some analysts, such as The Ringer&#x27;s Dan Devine, drew parallels between Jordan&#x27;s experiment at point guard in the 1988–89 season and the modern NBA; for Devine, it &quot;inadvertently foreshadowed the modern game&#x27;s stylistic shift toward monster-usage primary playmakers&quot;, such as Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Luka Dončić, and James. Don Nelson stated: &quot;I would&#x27;ve been playing him at point guard the day he showed up as a rookie.&quot;

Although Jordan was a well-rounded player, his &quot;Air Jordan&quot; image is also often credited with inadvertently decreasing the jump shooting skills, defense, and fundamentals of young players, a fact Jordan himself has lamented, saying: &quot;I think it was the exposure of Michael Jordan; the marketing of Michael Jordan. Everything was marketed towards the things that people wanted to see, which was scoring and dunking. That Michael Jordan still played defense and an all-around game, but it was never really publicized.&quot; During his heyday, Jordan did much to increase the status of the game; television ratings increased only during his time in the league. The popularity of the NBA in the U.S. declined after his last title. As late as 2022, NBA Finals television ratings had not returned to the level reached during his last championship-winning season.

In August 2009, the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts, opened a Michael Jordan exhibit that contained items from his college and NBA careers as well as from the 1992 &quot;Dream Team&quot;; the exhibit also has a batting baseball glove to signify Jordan&#x27;s short career in the Minor League Baseball. After Jordan received word of his acceptance into the Hall of Fame, he selected Class of 1996 member David Thompson to present him. As Jordan would later explain during his induction speech in September 2009, he was not a fan of the Tar Heels when growing up in North Carolina but greatly admired Thompson, who played for the rival NC State Wolfpack. In September, Jordan was inducted into the Hall with several former Bulls teammates in attendance, including Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, Charles Oakley, Ron Harper, Steve Kerr, and Toni Kukoč. Dean Smith and Doug Collins, two of Jordan&#x27;s former coaches, were also among those present. His emotional reaction during his speech when Jordan began to cry was captured by Associated Press photographer Stephan Savoia and would later go viral on social media as the &quot;Crying Jordan&quot; Internet meme. In 2016, President Barack Obama honored Jordan with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. In October 2021, he was named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team. In September 2022, Jordan&#x27;s jersey in which he played the opening game of the 1998 NBA Finals was sold for $10.1 million, making it the most expensive game-worn sports memorabilia in history. In December 2022, the NBA unveiled a new MVP trophy, named in Jordan&#x27;s honor, to be awarded beginning with the 2022–23 season, which replaced the original trophy, named in honor of former NBA commissioner Maurice Podoloff.

== Post-retirement ==

After his third retirement, Jordan assumed that he would be able to return to his front office position as Director of Basketball Operations with the Wizards. Jordan&#x27;s previous tenure had produced mixed results and may have also influenced the trade of Richard &quot;Rip&quot; Hamilton for Jerry Stackhouse, although Jordan was not technically Director of Basketball Operations in 2002. On May 7, 2003, Wizards owner Abe Pollin fired Jordan from the role. Jordan later stated that he felt betrayed, and that if he had known he would be fired upon retiring, he never would have come back to play for the Wizards.

Over the next few years, Jordan played golf in celebrity charity tournaments and spent time with his family in Chicago. He also promoted his Jordan Brand clothing line and rode motorcycles. Since 2004, Jordan has owned Michael Jordan Motorsports, a professional closed-course motorcycle road racing team that competed with two Suzukis in the premier Superbike championship sanctioned by the American Motorcyclist Association (AMA) until the end of the 2013 season.

=== Charlotte Bobcats/Hornets ===
On June 15, 2006, Jordan bought a minority stake in the Charlotte Bobcats (known as the Hornets since 2013), becoming the team&#x27;s second-largest shareholder behind majority owner Robert L. Johnson. As part of the deal, Jordan took full control over the basketball side of the operation, with the title Managing Member of Basketball Operations. Despite his previous success as an endorser, Jordan made an effort not to be included in Charlotte&#x27;s marketing campaigns. A decade earlier, he had made a bid to become part-owner of Charlotte&#x27;s original NBA team, the Charlotte Hornets, but talks collapsed when owner George Shinn refused to give Jordan complete control of basketball operations.

In February 2010, it was reported that Jordan was seeking majority ownership of the Bobcats. As February wore on, it became apparent that Jordan and former Houston Rockets president George Postolos were the leading contenders for ownership of the team. On February 27, the Bobcats announced that Johnson had reached an agreement with Jordan and his group, MJ Basketball Holdings, to buy the team from Johnson pending NBA approval. On March 17, the NBA Board of Governors unanimously approved Jordan&#x27;s purchase, making him the first former player to become the majority owner of an NBA team, and the league&#x27;s only African-American majority owner.

During the 2011 NBA lockout, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that Jordan led a group of 10 to 14 hardline owners who wanted to cap the players&#x27; share of basketball-related income at 50 percent and as low as 47. Journalists observed that, during the labor dispute in 1998, Jordan told Washington Wizards then-owner Abe Pollin: &quot;If you can&#x27;t make a profit, you should sell your team.&quot; Jason Whitlock of FoxSports.com called Jordan &quot;a hypocrite sellout who can easily betray the very people who made him a billionaire global icon&quot; for wanting &quot;current players to pay for his incompetence&quot;. He cited Jordan&#x27;s executive decisions to draft disappointing players Kwame Brown and Adam Morrison.

During the 2011–12 NBA season that was shortened to 66 games by the lockout, the Bobcats posted a 7–59 record. The team closed out the season with a 23-game losing streak; their .106 winning percentage was the worst in NBA history. Before the next season, Jordan said: &quot;I&#x27;m not real happy about the record book scenario last year. It&#x27;s very, very frustrating.&quot;

During the 2019 NBA offseason, Jordan sold a minority piece of the Hornets to Gabe Plotkin and Daniel Sundheim, retaining the majority for himself, as well as the role of chairman. In 2023, Jordan finalized the sale of his majority stake to Gabe Plotkin and Rick Schnall, ending his 13-year tenure as majority owner, although he kept a minority stake. The sale was officially completed in August 2023 for approximately $3 billion, more than 10 times the $275 million Jordan had paid for the team.

=== 23XI Racing ===
On September 21, 2020, Jordan and NASCAR driver Denny Hamlin announced they would be fielding a NASCAR Cup Series team with Bubba Wallace driving, beginning competition in the 2021 season. On October 22, the team&#x27;s name was confirmed to be 23XI Racing (pronounced twenty-three eleven) and the team&#x27;s entry would bear No. 23. After the team&#x27;s inaugural season, it added a second car with No. 45, driven by Kurt Busch in 2022 and Tyler Reddick in 2023. Ty Gibbs, John Hunter Nemechek, and Daniel Hemric also drove for 23XI as substitute drivers during the 2022 season. The team fielded a third car, No. 67, driven by Travis Pastrana in the 2023 Daytona 500. Reddick won the 2024 NASCAR Cup Series regular season championship, the first for the team. 23XI Racing acquired a third charter from the defunct Stewart-Haas Racing, the No. 35 driven by Riley Herbst beginning in 2025.

== Personal life ==

Jordan married Juanita Vanoy at A Little White Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas on September 2, 1989. They had three children: Jeffrey, Marcus, and Jasmine. The Jordans filed for divorce on January 4, 2002, citing irreconcilable differences, but reconciled shortly thereafter. They again filed for divorce and were granted a final decree of dissolution of marriage on December 29, 2006, commenting that the decision was made &quot;mutually and amicably&quot;. It is reported that Juanita received a $168 million settlement (equivalent to $ million in ), making it the largest celebrity divorce settlement on public record at the time.

In 1991, Jordan purchased a lot in Highland Park, Illinois, where he planned to build a 56,000-square-foot (5,200 m2) mansion. It was completed in 1995. Jordan listed the mansion for sale in 2012. He also owns homes in North Carolina and Jupiter Island, Florida.

On July 21, 2006, a judge in Cook County, Illinois, determined that Jordan did not owe his alleged former lover Karla Knafel $5 million in a breach of contract claim. Jordan had allegedly paid Knafel $250,000 to keep their relationship a secret. Knafel claimed Jordan promised her $5 million for remaining silent and agreeing not to file a paternity suit after Knafel learned she was pregnant in 1991; a DNA test showed that Jordan was not the father of the child.

Jordan proposed to his longtime girlfriend, Cuban-American model Yvette Prieto, on Christmas 2011, and they were married on April 27, 2013, at Bethesda-by-the-Sea Episcopal Church. It was announced on November 30, 2013, that the two were expecting their first child together. On February 11, 2014, Prieto gave birth to identical twin daughters named Victoria and Ysabel. In 2019, Jordan became a grandfather when his daughter Jasmine gave birth to a son, whose father is professional basketball player Rakeem Christmas.

== Media figure and business interests ==

=== Endorsements ===

Jordan is one of the most marketed sports figures in history. He has been a major spokesman for such brands as Nike, Coca-Cola, Chevrolet, Gatorade, McDonald&#x27;s, Ball Park Franks, Rayovac, Wheaties, Hanes, and MCI. In the early stages of his career, he appeared in an anti-drug PSA sponsored by McDonald&#x27;s. Jordan has had a long relationship with Gatorade, appearing in over 20 commercials for the company since 1991, including the &quot;Be Like Mike&quot; commercials in which a song was sung by children wishing to be like Jordan.

Nike created a signature shoe for Jordan, called the Air Jordan, in 1984. One of his more popular commercials for the shoe involved Spike Lee playing the part of Mars Blackmon. In the commercials, Lee, as Blackmon, attempted to find the source of Jordan&#x27;s abilities and became convinced that &quot;it&#x27;s gotta be the shoes&quot;. The hype and demand for the shoes even brought on a spate of &quot;shoe-jackings&quot;, in which people were robbed of their sneakers at gunpoint. Subsequently, Nike spun off the Jordan line into its own division named the &quot;Jordan Brand&quot;. The company features a list of athletes and celebrities as endorsers. The brand has also sponsored college sports programs such as those of North Carolina, UCLA, California, Oklahoma, Florida, Georgetown, and Marquette.

Jordan also has been associated with the Looney Tunes cartoon characters. A Nike commercial shown during 1992&#x27;s Super Bowl XXVI featured Jordan and Bugs Bunny playing basketball. The Super Bowl commercial inspired the 1996 live action/animated film &quot;Space Jam&quot;, which starred Jordan and Bugs in a fictional story set during the former&#x27;s first retirement from basketball. They have subsequently appeared together in several commercials for MCI. Jordan also made an appearance in the music video for Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Jam&quot; (1992).

Since 2008, Jordan&#x27;s yearly income from endorsements is estimated to be over $40 million. In addition, when his power at the ticket gates was at its highest point, the Bulls regularly sold out both their home and road games. Due to this, Jordan set records in player salary by signing annual contracts worth in excess of US$30 million per season. An academic study found that his first NBA comeback resulted in an increase in the market capitalization of his client firms of more than $1 billion.

Most of Jordan&#x27;s endorsement deals, including his first deal with Nike, were engineered by his agent, David Falk. Jordan has described Falk as &quot;the best at what he does&quot; and that &quot;marketing-wise, he&#x27;s great. He&#x27;s the one who came up with the concept of &#x27;Air Jordan&#x27;.&quot;

=== Business ventures ===
In June 2010, Jordan was ranked by &quot;Forbes&quot; as the 20th-most-powerful celebrity in the world, with $55 million earned between June 2009 and June 2010. According to &quot;Forbes&quot;, Jordan Brand generates $1 billion in sales for Nike. In June 2014, Jordan was named the first NBA player to become a billionaire, after he increased his stake in the Charlotte Hornets from 80% to 89.5%. On January 20, 2015, Jordan was honored with the &quot;Charlotte Business Journal&quot;&#x27;s Business Person of the Year for 2014. In 2017, he became a part owner of the Miami Marlins of Major League Baseball.

&quot;Forbes&quot; designated Jordan as the athlete with the highest career earnings in 2017. From his Jordan Brand income and endorsements, Jordan&#x27;s 2015 income was an estimated $110 million, the most of any retired athlete. , his net worth is estimated at $3.5 billion by &quot;Forbes&quot;, making him the fourth-richest African-American, behind David Steward, Robert F. Smith, and Alex Karp, and one of the richest celebrities.

Jordan co-owns an automotive group which bears his name. The company has a Nissan dealership in Durham, North Carolina, acquired in 1990, and formerly had a Lincoln–Mercury dealership from 1995 until its closure in June 2009. The company also owned a Nissan franchise in Glen Burnie, Maryland. The restaurant industry is another business interest of Jordan&#x27;s. Restaurants he has owned include a steakhouse in New York City&#x27;s Grand Central Terminal, among others; that restaurant closed in 2018. Jordan is the majority investor in a golf course, Grove XXIII in Hobe Sound, Florida.

In September 2020, Jordan became an investor and advisor for DraftKings.

=== Philanthropy ===
From 2001 to 2014, Jordan hosted an annual golf tournament, the Michael Jordan Celebrity Invitational, that raised money for various charities. In 2006, Jordan and his wife Juanita pledged $5 million to Chicago&#x27;s Hales Franciscan High School. The Jordan Brand has made donations to Habitat for Humanity and a Louisiana branch of the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America.

The Make-A-Wish Foundation named Jordan its Chief Wish Ambassador in 2008. In 2013, he granted his 200th wish for the organization. As of 2019, Jordan has raised more than $5 million for the Make-A-Wish Foundation. In 2023, he donated $10 million to the organization for his 60th birthday.

In 2015, Jordan donated a settlement of undisclosed size from a lawsuit against supermarkets that had used his name without permission to 23 different Chicago charities. In 2017, Jordan funded two Novant Health Michael Jordan Family Clinics in Charlotte, North Carolina, by giving $7 million, the biggest donation he had made at the time. The following year, after Hurricane Florence damaged parts of North Carolina, including his former hometown of Wilmington, Jordan donated $2 million to relief efforts. He gave $1 million to aid the Bahamas&#x27; recovery following Hurricane Dorian in 2019.

Amidst the public uproar about the police shootings of two African-American men, Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, and two deadly attacks against police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge, Jordan made $1 million donations to two organizations, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and the Institute for Community-Police Relations. Jordan says the goal is to &quot;build trust and respect between communities and law enforcement.&quot; He also said &quot;I can no longer stay silent. We need to find solutions that ensure people of color receive fair and equal treatment AND that police officers – who put their lives on the line every day to protect us all – are respected and supported.&quot;

On June 5, 2020, in the wake of the protests following the murder of George Floyd, Jordan and his brand announced in a joint statement that they would be donating $100 million over the next 10 years to organizations dedicated to &quot;ensuring racial equality, social justice and greater access to education&quot;. In February 2021, Jordan funded two Novant Health Michael Jordan Family Clinics in New Hanover County, North Carolina, by giving $10 million. In 2024, he funded the opening of another Novant Health Clinic, this time in Wilmington.

=== Film and television ===
Jordan played himself in the 1996 comedy film &quot;Space Jam&quot;. The film received mixed reviews, but it was a box office success, making $230 million worldwide, and earned more than $1 billion through merchandise sales.

In 2000, Jordan was the subject of an IMAX documentary about his career with the Chicago Bulls, especially the 1998 NBA playoffs, titled &quot;Michael Jordan to the Max&quot;. Two decades later, the same period of Jordan&#x27;s life was covered in much greater and more personal detail by the Emmy Award-winning &quot;The Last Dance&quot;, a 10-part TV documentary which debuted on ESPN in April and May 2020. &quot;The Last Dance&quot; relied heavily on about 500 hours of candid film of Jordan&#x27;s and his teammates&#x27; off-court activities which an NBA Entertainment crew had shot over the course of the 1997–98 NBA season for use in a documentary. The project was delayed for many years because Jordan had not yet given his permission for the footage to be used. Jordan was interviewed at three homes associated with the production and did not want cameras in his home or on his plane, as according to director Jason Hehir &quot;there are certain aspects of his life that he wants to keep private&quot;.

Jordan granted rapper Travis Scott permission to film a music video for his single &quot;Franchise&quot; at his home in Highland Park, Illinois. Jordan appeared in the 2022 miniseries &quot;The Captain&quot;, which follows the life and career of Derek Jeter.

<text>Musicology is the academic, research-based study of music, as opposed to musical composition or performance. Musicology research combines and intersects with many fields, including psychology, sociology, acoustics, neurology, natural sciences, formal sciences and computer science.

Musicology is traditionally divided into three branches: music history, systematic musicology, and ethnomusicology. Historical musicologists study the history of musical traditions, the origins of works, and the biographies of composers. Ethnomusicologists draw from anthropology (particularly field research) to understand how and why people make music. Systematic musicology includes music theory, aesthetics, pedagogy, musical acoustics, the science and technology of musical instruments, and the musical implications of physiology, psychology, sociology, philosophy and computing. Cognitive musicology is the set of phenomena surrounding the cognitive modeling of music. When musicologists carry out research using computers, their research often falls under the field of computational musicology. Music therapy is a specialized form of applied musicology which is sometimes considered more closely affiliated with health fields, and other times regarded as part of musicology proper.

==Background==
The word &quot;musicology&quot; comes from Greek &#x27;music&#x27; and , &#x27;domain of study&#x27;. 

The 19th-century philosophical trends that led to the re-establishment of formal musicology education in German and Austrian universities had combined methods of systematization with evolution. These models were established not only in the field of physical anthropology, but also cultural anthropology. This was influenced by Hegel&#x27;s ideas on ordering &quot;phenomena&quot; which can be understood &amp; distinguished from &quot;simple&quot; to &quot;complex&quot; stages of evolution. They are further classified into &quot;primitive&quot; &amp; &quot;developed&quot; sections; whereas the particular stages of history are understood &amp; distinguished as &quot;ancient&quot; to &quot;modern&quot;. Comparative methods became more widespread in musicology beginning around 1880.

==Parent disciplines==
The parent disciplines of musicology include:
* General history
* Cultural studies
* Philosophy (particularly aesthetics and semiotics)
* Ethnology and cultural anthropology
* Archaeology and prehistory
* Psychology and sociology
* Physiology and neuroscience
* Acoustics and psychoacoustics
* Information sciences and mathematics

Musicology also has two central, practically oriented sub-disciplines with no parent discipline: performance practice and research, and the theory, analysis and composition of music. The disciplinary neighbors of musicology address other forms of art, performance, ritual, and communication, including the history and theory of the visual and plastic arts and architecture; linguistics, literature and theater; religion and theology; and sport. Musical knowledge is applied within medicine, education and music therapy—which, effectively, are parent disciplines of applied musicology.

==Subdisciplines==

===Historical musicology===
Music history or historical musicology is concerned with the composition, performance, reception and criticism of music over time. Historical studies of music are for example concerned with a composer&#x27;s life and works, the developments of styles and genres (such as baroque concertos), the social function of music for a particular group of people, (such as court music), or modes of performance at a particular place and time (such as Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s choir in Leipzig). Like the comparable field of art history, different branches and schools of historical musicology emphasize different types of musical works and approaches to music. There are also national differences in various definitions of historical musicology. In theory, &quot;music history&quot; could refer to the study of the history of any type or genre of music, such as the music of India or rock music. In practice, these research topics are more often considered within ethnomusicology and &quot;historical musicology&quot; is typically assumed to imply Western Art music of the European tradition.

The methods of historical musicology include source studies (especially manuscript studies), palaeography, philology (especially textual criticism), style criticism, historiography (the choice of historical method), musical analysis (analysis of music to find &quot;inner coherence&quot;) and iconography. The application of musical analysis to further these goals is often a part of music history, though pure analysis or the development of new tools of music analysis is more likely to be seen in the field of music theory. Music historians create a number of written products, ranging from journal articles describing their current research, new editions of musical works, biographies of composers and other musicians, book-length studies or university textbook chapters or entire textbooks. Music historians may examine issues in a close focus, as in the case of scholars who examine the relationship between words and music for a given composer&#x27;s art songs. On the other hand, some scholars take a broader view and assess the place of a given type of music, such as the symphony in society using techniques drawn from other fields, such as economics, sociology or philosophy.

===New musicology===
&quot;New musicology&quot; is a term applied since the late 1980s to a wide body of work emphasizing cultural study, analysis and criticism of music. Such work may be based on feminist, gender studies, queer theory or postcolonial theory, or the work of Theodor W. Adorno. Although New Musicology emerged from within historical musicology, the emphasis on cultural study within the Western art music tradition places New Musicology at the junction between historical, ethnological and sociological research in music.

New musicology was a reaction against traditional historical musicology, which according to Susan McClary, &quot;fastidiously declares issues of musical signification off-limits to those engaged in legitimate scholarship.&quot; Charles Rosen, however, retorts that McClary, &quot;sets up, like so many of the &#x27;new musicologists&#x27;, a straw man to knock down, the dogma that music has no meaning, and no political or social significance.&quot; Today, many musicologists no longer distinguish between musicology and new musicology since it has been recognized that many of the scholarly concerns once associated with new musicology already were mainstream in musicology, so that the term &quot;new&quot; no longer applies.

===Ethnomusicology===
Ethnomusicology, formerly comparative musicology, is the study of music in its cultural context. It is often considered the anthropology or ethnography of music. Jeff Todd Titon has called it the study of &quot;people making music&quot;. Although it is most often concerned with the study of non-Western music, it also includes the study of Western music from an anthropological or sociological perspective, cultural studies and sociology as well as other disciplines in the social sciences and humanities. Some ethnomusicologists primarily conduct historical studies, but the majority are involved in long-term participant observation or combine ethnographic, musicological, and historical approaches in their fieldwork. Therefore, ethnomusicological scholarship can be characterized as featuring a substantial, intensive fieldwork component, often involving long-term residence within the community studied. Closely related to ethnomusicology is the emerging branch of sociomusicology. For instance, Ko (2011) proposed the hypothesis of &quot;Biliterate and Trimusical&quot; in Hong Kong sociomusicology.

===Popular music studies===

Popular music studies, known, &quot;misleadingly&quot;, as &quot;popular musicology&quot;, emerged in the 1980s as an increasing number of musicologists, ethnomusicologists and other varieties of historians of American and European culture began to write about popular music past and present. The first journal focusing on popular music studies was &quot;Popular Music&quot; which began publication in 1981. The same year an academic society solely devoted to the topic was formed, the International Association for the Study of Popular Music. The association&#x27;s founding was partly motivated by the interdisciplinary agenda of popular musicology though the group has been characterized by a polarized &#x27;musicological&#x27; and &#x27;sociological&#x27; approach also typical of popular musicology.

===Music theory, analysis and composition===
Music theory is a field of study that describes the elements of music and includes the development and application of methods for composing and for analyzing music through both notation and, on occasion, musical sound itself. Broadly, theory may include any statement, belief or conception of or about music (Boretz, 1995). A person who studies or practices music theory is a music theorist.

Some music theorists attempt to explain the techniques composers use by establishing rules and patterns. Others model the experience of listening to or performing music. Though extremely diverse in their interests and commitments, many Western music theorists are united in their belief that the acts of composing, performing and listening to music may be explicated to a high degree of detail (this, as opposed to a conception of musical expression as fundamentally ineffable except in musical sounds). Generally, works of music theory are both descriptive and prescriptive, attempting both to define practice and to influence later practice.

Musicians study music theory to understand the structural relationships in the (nearly always notated) music. Composers study music theory to understand how to produce effects and structure their own works. Composers may study music theory to guide their precompositional and compositional decisions. Broadly speaking, music theory in the Western tradition focuses on harmony and counterpoint, and then uses these to explain large scale structure and the creation of melody.

===Music psychology===
Music psychology applies the content and methods of psychology to understand how music is created, perceived, responded to, and incorporated into individuals&#x27; and societies&#x27; daily lives. Its primary branches include cognitive musicology, which emphasizes the use of computational models for human musical abilities and cognition, and the cognitive neuroscience of music, which studies the way that music perception and production manifests in the brain using the methodologies of cognitive neuroscience. While aspects of the field can be highly theoretical, much of modern music psychology seeks to optimize the practices and professions of music performance, composition, education and therapy.

===Performance practice and research===
Performance practice draws on many of the tools of historical musicology to answer the specific question of how music was performed in various places at various times in the past. Although previously confined to early music, recent research in performance practice has embraced questions such as how the early history of recording affected the use of vibrato in classical music or instruments in Klezmer.

Within the rubric of musicology, performance practice tends to emphasize the collection and synthesis of evidence about how music should be performed. The important other side, learning how to sing authentically or perform a historical instrument is usually part of conservatory or other performance training. However, many top researchers in performance practice are also excellent musicians.

Music performance research (or music performance science) is strongly associated with music psychology. It aims to document and explain the psychological, physiological, sociological and cultural details of how music is actually performed (rather than how it should be performed). The approach to research tends to be systematic and empirical and to involve the collection and analysis of both quantitative and qualitative data. The findings of music performance research can often be applied in music education.

==Education and careers==

Musicologists in tenure track professor positions typically hold a PhD in musicology. In the 1960s and 1970s, some musicologists obtained professor positions with an MA as their highest degree, but in the 2010s, the PhD is the standard minimum credential for tenure track professor positions. As part of their initial training, musicologists typically complete a BMus or a BA in music (or a related field such as history) and in many cases an MA in musicology. Some individuals apply directly from a bachelor&#x27;s degree to a PhD, and in these cases, they may not receive an MA. In the 2010s, given the increasingly interdisciplinary nature of university graduate programs, some applicants for musicology PhD programs may have academic training both in music and outside of music (e.g., a student may apply with a BMus and an MA in psychology). In music education, individuals may hold an M.Ed and an Ed.D.

Most musicologists work as instructors, lecturers or professors in colleges, [universities or conservatories. The job market for tenure track professor positions is very competitive. Entry-level applicants must hold a completed PhD or the equivalent degree and applicants to more senior professor positions must have a strong record of publishing in peer-reviewed journals. Some PhD-holding musicologists are only able to find insecure positions as sessional lecturers. The job tasks of a musicologist are the same as those of a professor in any other humanities discipline: teaching undergraduate and/or graduate classes in their area of specialization and, in many cases some general courses (such as Music Appreciation or Introduction to Music History); conducting research in their area of expertise, publishing articles about their research in peer-reviewed journals, authors book chapters, books or textbooks; traveling to conferences to give talks on their research and learn about research in their field; and, if their program includes a graduate school, supervising MA and PhD students, giving them guidance on the preparation of their theses and dissertations. Some musicology professors may take on senior administrative positions in their institution, such as Dean or Chair of the School of Music.

==Role of women==
The vast majority of major musicologists and music historians from past generations have been men, as in the 19th century and early 20th century; women&#x27;s involvement in teaching music was mainly in elementary and secondary music teaching. Nevertheless, some women musicologists have reached the top ranks of the profession. Carolyn Abbate (born 1956) is an American musicologist who did her PhD at Princeton University. She has been described by the &quot;Harvard Gazette&quot; as &quot;one of the world&#x27;s most accomplished and admired music historians&quot;.

Susan McClary (born 1946) is a musicologist associated with new musicology who incorporates feminist music criticism in her work. McClary holds a PhD from Harvard University. One of her best known works is &quot;Feminine Endings&quot; (1991), which covers musical constructions of gender and sexuality, gendered aspects of traditional music theory, gendered sexuality in musical narrative, music as a gendered discourse and issues affecting women musicians.

<text>Film promotion is the practice of promotion specifically in the film industry, and usually occurs in coordination with the process of film distribution. Sometimes this is called the press junket or film junket. Film promotion generally includes press releases, advertising campaigns, merchandising, franchising, media, and interviews with the key people involved in making the film, such as the film&#x27;s actors and directors. This process is an important part of any release because of the inherent high financial risk; film studios will invest in expensive marketing campaigns to maximize revenue early in the release cycle. Marketing budgets tend to equal about half the production budget. Publicity is generally handled by the distributor and exhibitors.

==Techniques ==
=== In theaters/cinemas ===
Trailers are a mainstay of film promotion because they are delivered directly to movie-goers. These trailers are presented to the public at the theater or on the television at home. Generally, they tell the story of the movie in a highly condensed fashion, compressing maximum appeal into two and a half minutes. 
* Film posters
* Slideshows - stills, trivia, and trivia games from the film shown between movie showtimes.
* Standees (freestanding paperboard life-size images of figures from the film)
* Cardboard 3D displays, sometimes producing sound

===Television and radio===
* Hollywood movie distributors spend about $4 billion a year to buy paid advertising (30-second TV commercials, magazine/newspaper ads, etc.) and over half that total is placed on broadcast and cable TV, which are the main vehicles for advertising movies to audiences. TV is effective because it is an audio-visual medium – like film – and can deliver a vast audience quickly, which is crucial because films typically don’t linger in theaters for more than 4–6 weeks, according to &quot;Marketing to Moviegoers: Second Edition&quot;.
* Product placement: paid active or passive insertion (as on-set posters, and action figures) of film branding in drama or sitcom shows, or as passing mentions in dialogue. For example, 20th Century Fox commissioned an &quot;I, Robot&quot;-themed motorcycle, featured on two episodes (2:17, 2:18) of &quot;American Chopper&quot;. The film &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; was placed throughout an episode of the TV show &quot;Medium&quot;.
* Extended placement: full episodes of television talk shows (&quot;Oprah&quot;), entertainment news programs (&quot;ET&quot;), or network news programs (&quot;20/20&quot;), devoted to compensated exposure of the film, stars, clips, director, etc.
** In addition, interviews with actors and directors, which are filmed in series at a hotel with local and national entertainment reporters, are featured on local news shows, programs on cable networks, and series such as Byron Allen&#x27;s series of entertainment series like &quot;Entertainment Studios&quot;.
* Production and paid broadcast of behind-the-scenes documentary-style shows, the type of which are mainly produced for HBO, Showtime, and Starz
* Advance trailers, longer previews, or behind-the-scenes footage on streaming media and Blu-ray/DVDs

===Internet===
* Virtual relationship hyperlink marketing, wherein a major search engine (like Yahoo or Bing&#x27;s main page) offers articles seemingly presenting interesting news-related items, but which are actually back-end loaded with a links page containing multiple &quot;mental references&quot; to film characters, storylines, or products. Example: Bond, Transformers, etc..., are connected to scientific invention news stories about advanced weaponry or robotics discoveries, which quickly leads the reader to pages loaded with the latest 007 or Megatron movie clip or art director&#x27;s fantastical ideas and designs, thus hooking readers with a &quot;bait and switch&quot; story.
* Creation of standalone studio-sponsored websites specific to a given film.
* Online digital film screeners: screeners streamed over the Internet allow studios to send individually controlled copies of their films to various recipients with different expiry dates as a security measure against unauthorized distribution.
* Viral marketing: free distribution of trailers on movie-oriented websites and video user-generated content websites, and rapid dissemination of links to this content by email and blogs. Includes alleged leakage of supposed &quot;rushes&quot; and &quot;early trailers&quot; of film scenes. Sometimes, the efforts go further such as in the lead time to the successful premiere of the film, &quot;The Muppets&quot; which was preceded by several original shorts on YouTube over a number of years while the film was in production.
* Creation of Internet marketing campaigns using paid advertisement and social media marketing.

===Print===
* Paid advertisement in newspapers, magazines, and inserts in books.
* Cross-promotion of original book or novelization, including special printings, or new cover jackets (&quot;Now a major motion picture.&quot;)
* Comic special editions or special episodes

===Merchandising===
* Paid co-branding (&quot;Eragon&quot; in &quot;American Chopper&quot;-two episodes), or co-advertising (Aston Martin and James Bond films) of a product with the film
* Promotional giveaways: branded drink cups, toys, or food combinations at fast food chains
* Building a life-sized Barbie Dreamhouse that people can rent for stays on AirBnB

===Promotional tours and interviews===
Film actors, directors, and producers appear for television, cable, radio, print, and online media interviews, which can be conducted in person or remotely. During film production, these can take place &quot;on set&quot;. After the film&#x27;s premiere, key personnel make appearances in major market cities or participate remotely via satellite videoconference or telephone. The purpose of interviews is to encourage journalists to publish stories about their &quot;exclusive interviews&quot; with the film&#x27;s stars, thereby creating &quot;marketing buzz&quot; around the film and stimulating audience interest in watching the film.

When it comes to feature films picked up by a major film studio for international distribution, promotional tours are notoriously grueling. Key cast and crew are often contracted to travel to several major cities around the world to promote the film and sit for dozens of interviews. In every interview, they are supposed to stay &quot;on message&quot; by energetically expressing their enthusiasm for the film in a way that appears candid, fun, and fresh. They are expected to disclose just enough behind-the-scenes information about the filmmaking process or the filmmakers&#x27; artistic vision to make each journalist feel like he or she got a nice scoop, while at the same time tactfully avoiding disclosure of anything embarrassing, humiliating, or truly negative that may be detrimental to the film&#x27;s box office gross and profit or influence a critic&#x27;s review as well as the public&#x27;s opinion.

===Audience research===
There are seven distinct types of research conducted by film distributors in connection with domestic theatrical releases, according to &quot;Marketing to Moviegoers: Second Edition.&quot; Such audience research can cost $1 million per film, especially when scores of TV advertisements are tested and re-tested. The bulk of research is done by major studios for the roughly 170 major releases they mount each year that are supported by tens of millions of advertising buys for each film. Independent film distributors, which typically spend less than $10 million in media buys per film, don’t have the budget or breadth of advertising materials to analyze, so they spend little or nothing on pre-release audience research.

When audience research is conducted for domestic theatrical release, it involves these areas:
*Positioning studies versus other films that will premiere at the same time.
*Test screenings of finished or nearly finished films; this is the most well-known.
*Testing of audience response to advertising materials.
*Tracking surveys of audience awareness of a film starting six weeks before premiere.
*Exit surveys questioning filmgoers about their demographic makeup and the effectiveness of marketing.
*Title testing in an early stage.
*Concept testing that would occur in the development phase of a film before it is produced.

Marketing can play a big role in whether or not a film gets the green light. Audience research is a strong factor in determining the ability of a film to sell in theaters, which is ultimately how films make their money. As part of a movie&#x27;s marketing strategy, audience research comes into account as producers create promotional materials. These promotional materials consistently change and evolve as a direct consequence of audience research up until the film opens in theaters.

IBIS made a study with information using 97% of America&#x27;s economy regarding the market size of movie and Video production. They calculated that the United States market size, measured by revenue of the Movie &amp; Video Production industry, is $18.2bn in 2022.

<text>&quot;Maggie Out&quot; was a chant popular during the miners&#x27; strike, student grant protests, poll tax protests and other public demonstrations that fell within the time when Margaret Thatcher was the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.

==Lyrics==

The chant called for her to be removed from that role. It was referred to, in that context, during a parliamentary session in 1982. 
When Margaret Thatcher felt compelled to resign some people had memories of chanting it for thirteen years. People were passionate about this group activity and associated it with varied political struggles from that time.

It is a variant of the &quot;Oggy Oggy Oggy, Oi Oi Oi&quot; chant. When used in that format, the lyrics were:

The Larks produced a track called &quot;Maggie, Maggie, Maggie (Out, Out, Out)&quot; which was included on the Miners&#x27; Benefit LP &quot;Here We Go&quot; on Sterile Records.

Upon Thatcher&#x27;s resignation, groups of opponents gathered at Downing Street, chanting a variation – replacing the word &quot;out&quot; with &quot;gone&quot;.

Following the death of Thatcher on 8 April 2013, this chant was revived in the format of &quot;Maggie, Maggie Maggie (Dead, Dead, Dead)&quot; at celebratory parties held in Glasgow, London and Reading.
