<text>Otorhinolaryngology ( , abbreviated ORL and also known as otolaryngology, otolaryngology–head and neck surgery (ORL–H&amp;N or OHNS), or ear, nose, and throat (ENT)) is a surgical subspecialty within medicine that deals with the surgical and medical management of conditions of the head and neck. Doctors who specialize in this area are called otorhinolaryngologists, otolaryngologists, head and neck surgeons, or ENT surgeons or physicians. 

Patients seek treatment from an otorhinolaryngologist for diseases of the ear, nose, throat, base of the skull, head, and neck. These commonly include functional diseases that affect the senses and activities of eating, drinking, speaking, breathing, swallowing, and hearing. In addition, ENT surgery encompasses the surgical management of cancers and benign tumors and reconstruction of the head and neck as well as plastic surgery of the face, scalp, and neck.

==Etymology==
The term is a combination of Neo-Latin combining forms (&quot;&quot; + &quot;&quot; + &quot;&quot; + &quot;&quot;) derived from four Ancient Greek words: (cf. Greek ).

==Training==
Otorhinolaryngologists are physicians (MD, DO, MBBS, MBChB, etc.) who complete both medical school and an average of five–seven years of post-graduate surgical training in ORL-H&amp;N. In the United States, trainees complete at least five years of surgical residency training. This comprises three to six months of general surgical training and four and a half years in ORL-H&amp;N specialist surgery. In Canada and the United States, practitioners complete a five-year residency training after medical school.

Following residency training, some otolaryngologist-head &amp; neck surgeons complete an advanced sub-specialty fellowship, where training can be one to two years in duration. Fellowships include head and neck surgical oncology, facial plastic surgery, rhinology and sinus surgery, neuro-otology, pediatric otolaryngology, and laryngology. In the United States and Canada, otorhinolaryngology is one of the most competitive specialties in medicine in which to obtain a residency position following medical school.

In the United Kingdom, entrance to higher surgical training is competitive and involves a rigorous national selection process. The training programme consists of 6 years of higher surgical training after which trainees frequently undertake fellowships in a sub-speciality prior to becoming a consultant.

The typical total length of education, training and post-secondary school is 12–14 years. Otolaryngology is among the more highly compensated surgical specialties in the United States. In 2022, the average annual income was $469,000.

=== Microvascular reconstruction repair ===
Microvascular reconstruction repair is a common operation that is done on patients who see an otorhinolaryngologist. It is a surgical procedure that involves moving a composite piece of tissue from the patient&#x27;s body and to the head and/or neck. Microvascular head-and-neck reconstruction is used to treat head-and-neck cancers, including those of the larynx and pharynx, oral cavity, salivary glands, jaws, calvarium, sinuses, tongue and skin. The tissue that is most commonly moved during this procedure is from the arms, legs, and back, and can come from the skin, bone, fat, and/or muscle. 

When performing this procedure, the decision on which is moved is determined on the reconstructive needs. Transfer of the tissue to the head and neck allows surgeons to rebuild the patient&#x27;s jaw, optimize tongue function, and reconstruct the throat. When the pieces of tissue are moved, they require their own blood supply for a chance of survival in their new location. After the surgery is completed, the blood vessels that feed the tissue transplant are reconnected to new blood vessels in the neck. These blood vessels are typically no more than 1 to 3 millimeters in diameter, which means that these connections need to be made with a microscope, which is why the procedure is called &quot;microvascular surgery&quot;.

<text>Otterlo is a village in the municipality of Ede of province of Gelderland in the Netherlands, in or near the Nationaal Park De Hoge Veluwe.

The Kröller-Müller Museum, named after Helene Kröller-Müller, is situated nearby and has the world&#x27;s second largest collection of Vincent van Gogh paintings.

Otterlo was a separate municipality until 1818, when it merged with Ede.

== History ==
=== Second World War ===
During the first four years of the war, Otterlo was relatively unharmed. The local resistance made use of a secret telephone connection from an electrician&#x27;s house, which in 2021 still stands at the dorpsstraat, behind barber Prophitius, to communicate with the allies below the river Rhine (1944/1945). During the war, multiple families hid Jewish people from the Germans. One location was betrayed however, resulting in a raid in 1944 at the house &#x27;De Lindenhof&#x27; at the Hoenderlooseweg. 

During the liberation of Netherlands in April 1945, Otterlo was the center of a fierce and bloody battle between German and British and Canadian soldiers. See the Battle of Otterlo.

<text>The modern Olympic Games (Olympics; ) are the world&#x27;s leading international sporting events. They feature summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes from around the world participate in a variety of competitions. The Olympic Games are considered the world&#x27;s foremost sports competition, with more than 200 teams, representing sovereign states and territories, participating. By default, the Games generally substitute for any world championships during the year in which they take place (however, each class usually maintains its own records). The Olympics are staged every four years. Since 1994, they have alternated between the Summer and Winter Olympics every two years during the four-year Olympiad.

Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games, held in Olympia, Greece, from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894, leading to the first modern Games in Athens in 1896. The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement, which encompasses all entities and individuals involved in the Olympic Games. The Olympic Charter defines their structure and authority.

The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in numerous changes to the Olympic Games. Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for snow and ice sports, the Paralympic Games for athletes with disabilities, the Youth Olympic Games for athletes aged 14 to 18, the five Continental Games (Pan American, African, Asian, European, and Pacific), and the World Games for sports that are not contested in the Olympic Games. The IOC also endorses the Deaflympics and the Special Olympics. The IOC need to adapt to a variety of economic, political, and technological advancements. The abuse of amateur rules prompted the IOC to shift away from pure amateurism, as envisioned by Coubertin, to the acceptance of professional athletes participating at the Games. The growing importance of mass media has created the issue of corporate sponsorship and general commercialisation of the Games. World Wars I and II led to the cancellation of the 1916, 1940, and 1944 Olympics; large-scale boycotts during the Cold War limited participation in the 1980 and 1984 Olympics; and the 2020 Olympics were postponed until 2021 because of the COVID-19 restrictions.

The Olympic Movement consists of international sports federations (IFs), National Olympic Committees (NOCs), and organising committees for each specific Olympic Games. As the decision-making body, the IOC is responsible for choosing the host city for each Games, and organises and funds the Games according to the Olympic Charter. The IOC also determines the Olympic programme, consisting of the sports to be contested at the Games. There are several Olympic rituals and symbols, such as the Olympic flag, torch, and opening and closing ceremonies. Over 14,000 athletes competed at the 2020 Summer Olympics and 2022 Winter Olympics combined, in 40 different sports and 448 events. The first-, second-, and third-place finishers in each event receive Olympic medals: gold, silver, and bronze, respectively.

The Games have grown to the point that nearly every nation is now represented; colonies and overseas territories are often allowed to field their own teams. This growth has created numerous challenges and controversies, including boycotts, doping, match fixing, bribery, and terrorism. Every two years, the Olympics and its media exposure provide athletes with the chance to attain national and international fame. The Games also provide an opportunity for the host city and country to showcase themselves to the world.

The Olympic Games have become a significant global event, fostering international cooperation and cultural exchange. At the same time, hosting the Olympic Games can also bring significant economic benefits and challenges to the host city, affecting infrastructure, tourism and local communities.
==Ancient Olympics==
The Ancient Olympic Games (, &quot;ta Olympia&quot;) were religious and athletic festivals held every four years at the sanctuary of Zeus in Olympia, Greece. The date of the festival was determined according to a complicated formula whereby the midpoint of the festival would occur during the second full moon after the summer solstice—usually late August or early September. This &quot;came after the annual harvest but before the picking of the olives.&quot; Heralds were sent from Elis to announce the dates. Competition at first was among only &quot;legitimate sons of free-born Greek parents.&quot; However, after Macedonia, and then Rome, conquered Greece, the ten Olympic judges loosened the earlier standard and permitted anyone who spoke Greek to participate. Tens of thousands of Greeks would make the difficult journey to attend the festival. Some sources say as many as 40,000 attended. These Games featured mainly athletic but also combat sports such as wrestling and the pankration, horse and chariot racing events. It has been widely written that during the Games, all conflicts among the participating city-states were postponed until the Games were finished. This cessation of hostilities was known as the Olympic peace or truce. This idea is a modern myth because the Greeks never suspended their wars. The truce did allow those religious pilgrims who were traveling to Olympia to pass through warring territories unmolested because they were protected by Zeus. See also Finley and Pleket.

The origin of the Olympics is shrouded in mystery and legend; one of the most popular myths identifies Heracles and his father Zeus as the progenitors of the Games. According to legend, it was Heracles who first called the Games &quot;Olympic&quot; and established the custom of holding them every four years. The myth continues that after Heracles completed his twelve labours, he built the Olympic Stadium as an honour to Zeus. Following its completion, he walked in a straight line for 200 steps and called this distance a &quot;stadion&quot; (, Latin: , &quot;stage&quot;), which later became a unit of distance. The most widely accepted inception date for the Ancient Olympics is 776 BC; this is based on inscriptions, found at Olympia, listing the winners of a footrace held every four years starting in 776 BC. For the first thirteen Olympics, the &quot;stadion&quot; footrace was the only event contested, and victory in that sprint was so valued that the next Olympiad was named after the winner, e.g. &quot;the third year of the eighteenth Olympiad when Ladas of Argos won the stadion.&quot; The Ancient Games varied over time, but they came to feature running events, a pentathlon (consisting of a jumping event, discus and javelin throws, a foot race, and wrestling), boxing, wrestling, pankration, and equestrian events. Tradition has it that Coroebus, a cook from the city of Elis, was the first Olympic champion, which indicates that the competition was not limited to the aristocracy.

The Olympics were of fundamental religious importance, and the sporting events, which were held alongside ritual sacrifices honouring both Zeus (whose famous statue by Phidias stood in his temple at Olympia) and Pelops (divine hero and mythical king of Olympia), did not start until the festival&#x27;s second day. (Pelops was famous for his chariot race with King Oenomaus of Pisatis.) The winners of the events were admired and immortalised in poems and statues. Although a wreath made from the sacred olive tree in the precinct of Zeus was the only official prize at the Olympic Games, winners&#x27; fame brought them economic wealth, too, in the form of subsidies from their hometowns and wealthy sponsors. See, e.g., Finley and Pleket, and Perrottet The Games were held every four years, and this period, known as an Olympiad, was used by Greeks as one of their units of time measurement. The Games were part of a cycle known as the Panhellenic Games, which included the Pythian Games, the Nemean Games, and the Isthmian Games.

The Olympic Games reached the height of their success in the 6th and 5th centuries BC, but then gradually declined in importance as the Romans gained power and influence in Greece. While there is no scholarly consensus as to when the Games officially ended, the most commonly held date is 393 AD, when the emperor Theodosius I decreed that all pagan cults and practices be eliminated. Another date commonly cited is 426 AD, when his successor, Theodosius II, ordered the destruction of all Greek temples.

==Modern Games==
===Forerunners===

Various uses of the term &quot;Olympic&quot; to describe athletic events in the modern era have been documented since the 17th century. The first such event was the Cotswold Games or &quot;Cotswold Olimpick Games&quot;, an annual meeting near Chipping Campden, England, involving various sports. It was first organised by the lawyer Robert Dover between 1612 and 1642, with several later celebrations leading up to the present day. The British Olympic Association, in its bid for the 2012 Olympic Games in London, mentioned these games as &quot;the first stirrings of Britain&#x27;s Olympic beginnings&quot;.

, a national Olympic festival held annually from 1796 to 1798 in Revolutionary France also attempted to emulate the ancient Olympic Games. The competition included several disciplines from the ancient Greek Olympics. The 1796 Games also marked the introduction of the metric system into sport.

In 1834 and 1836, the Olympic games were held in Ramlösa, Sweden, and in Stockholm, in 1843, organised by Gustaf Johan Schartau and others. At most 25,000 spectators saw the games.

In 1850, an Olympian Class was started by William Penny Brookes at Much Wenlock, in Shropshire, England. In 1859, Brookes changed the name to the Wenlock Olympian Games. This annual sports festival continues to this day. The Wenlock Olympian Society was founded by Brookes on 15 November 1860.

Between 1862 and 1867, Liverpool held an annual Grand Olympic Festival. Devised by John Hulley and Charles Pierre Melly, these games were the first to be wholly amateur in nature and international in outlook, although only &#x27;gentlemen amateurs&#x27; could compete. The programme of the first modern Olympiad in Athens in 1896 was almost identical to that of the Liverpool Olympics. In 1865 Hulley, Brookes and E.G. Ravenstein founded the National Olympian Association in Liverpool, a forerunner of the British Olympic Association. Its articles of foundation provided the framework for the International Olympic Charter. In 1866, a national Olympic Games in Great Britain was organised at London&#x27;s Crystal Palace.

===Revival===

Greek interest in reviving the Olympic Games began with the Greek War of Independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1821. It was first proposed by poet and newspaper editor Panagiotis Soutsos in his poem &quot;Dialogue of the Dead&quot;, published in 1833. Evangelos Zappas, a wealthy Greek-Romanian philanthropist, first wrote to King Otto of Greece, in 1856, offering to fund a permanent revival of the Olympic Games. Zappas sponsored the first Olympic Games in 1859, which was held in an Athens city square. Athletes participated from Greece and the Ottoman Empire. Zappas funded the restoration of the ancient Panathenaic Stadium so that it could host all future Olympic Games.

The stadium hosted the Olympics in 1870 and 1875. Thirty thousand spectators attended that Games in 1870, though no official attendance records are available for the 1875 Games. In 1890, after attending the Olympian Games of the Wenlock Olympian Society, Baron Pierre de Coubertin, who aimed to promote international peace and friendship through sports, was inspired to found the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Coubertin built on the ideas and work of Brookes and Zappas with the aim of establishing internationally rotating Olympic Games that would occur every four years. He presented these ideas during the first Olympic Congress of the newly created International Olympic Committee. This meeting was held from 16 to 23 June 1894, at the University of Paris. On the last day of the Congress, it was decided that the first Olympic Games to come under the auspices of the IOC would take place in Athens in 1896. The IOC elected the Greek writer Demetrius Vikelas as its first president.

===1896 Games===
The first Games held under the auspices of the IOC were hosted in the Panathenaic Stadium in Athens in 1896. The Games brought together 14 nations and 241 athletes who competed in 43 events. Zappas and his cousin Konstantinos Zappas had left the Greek government a trust to fund future Olympic Games. This trust was used to help finance the 1896 Games. George Averoff contributed generously for the refurbishment of the stadium in preparation for the Games. The Greek government also provided funding, which was expected to be recouped through the sale of tickets and from the sale of the first Olympic commemorative stamp set.

Greek officials and the public were enthusiastic about the experience of hosting an Olympic Games. This feeling was shared by many of the athletes, who even demanded that Athens be the permanent Olympic host city. The IOC intended for subsequent Games to be rotated to various host cities around the world. The second Olympics was held in Paris.

===Changes and adaptations===
After the success of the 1896 Games, the Olympics entered a period of stagnation which threatened its survival. The Olympic Games held at the Paris Exposition in 1900 and the Louisiana Purchase Exposition at St. Louis in 1904 failed to attract much participation or notice. Of the 650 athletes in the 1904 Olympics, 580 were American; the winner of the marathon was later disqualified upon discovery of a photograph of him riding in a car during the race. The Games rebounded with the 1906 Intercalated Games (so-called because they were the second Olympics to take place within the third Olympiad), which were held in Athens. These Games attracted a broad international field of participants and generated a great deal of public interest, marking the beginning of a rise in both the popularity and the size of the Olympics. The 1906 Games were officially recognised by the IOC at the time (although not any longer), and no Intercalated Games have been held since.

====Winter Games====
The Winter Olympics was created to feature snow and ice sports that were logistically impossible to hold during the Summer Games. Figure skating (in 1908 and 1920) and ice hockey (in 1920) were featured as Olympic events at the Summer Olympics. The IOC desired to expand this list of sports to encompass other winter activities. At the 1921 Olympic Congress in Lausanne, it was decided to hold a winter version of the Olympic Games. A winter sports week (it was actually 11 days) was held in 1924 in Chamonix, France, in connection with the Paris Games held three months later; this event became the first Winter Olympic Games. Although, it was intended that the &quot;same&quot; country host both the Winter and Summer Games in a given year, this idea was quickly abandoned. The IOC mandated that the Winter Games be celebrated every four years in the same year as their summer counterpart. This tradition was upheld through the 1992 Games in Albertville, France; after that, beginning with the 1994 Games, the Winter Olympics were held every four years, two years after each Summer Olympics.

====Paralympics====
In 1948, Sir Ludwig Guttmann, determined to promote the rehabilitation of soldiers after World War II, organised a multi-sport event between several hospitals to coincide with the 1948 London Olympics. Originally known as the Stoke Mandeville Games, Guttmann&#x27;s event became an annual sports festival. Over the next 12 years, Guttmann and others continued their efforts to use sports as an avenue to healing.

In 1960, Guttmann brought 400 athletes to Rome to compete in the &quot;Parallel Olympics&quot;, which ran in parallel with the Summer Olympics and came to be known as the first Paralympics. Since then, the Paralympics have been held in every Olympic year and, starting with the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, the host city for the Olympics has also played host to the Paralympics. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) signed an agreement in 2001 which guaranteed that host cities would be contracted to manage both the Olympic and Paralympic Games. The agreement came into effect at the 2008 Summer Games in Beijing, and at the 2010 Winter Games in Vancouver.

Two years before the 2012 Games, the LOCOG chairman Lord Coe made the following statement about the Paralympics and Olympics in London:
====Youth Games====

In 2010, the Olympic Games were complemented by the Youth Games, which give athletes between the ages of 14 and 18 the chance to compete. The Youth Olympic Games were conceived by IOC president Jacques Rogge in 2001 and approved during the 119th Congress of the IOC. The first Summer Youth Games were held in Singapore from 14 to 26 August 2010, while the inaugural Winter Games were hosted in Innsbruck, Austria, two years later. These Games will be shorter than the senior Games; the summer version will last twelve days, while the winter version will last nine days. The IOC allows 3,500 athletes and 875 officials to participate at the Summer Youth Games, and 970 athletes and 580 officials at the Winter Youth Games. The sports to be contested will coincide with those scheduled for the senior Games, however there will be variations on the sports including mixed NOC and mixed gender teams as well as a reduced number of disciplines and events.

===21st-century Games===
Over 14,000 athletes competed at the 2020 Summer Olympics and 2022 Winter Olympics combined, in 40 different sports and 448 events. The Summer Olympics have grown from 241 participants representing 14 nations in 1896, to more than 11,300 competitors representing 206 nations in 2020. The scope and scale of the Winter Olympics is smaller; for example, Beijing hosted 2,971 athletes from 91 nations in 2022. Most of the athletes and officials are housed in the Olympic Village for the duration of the Games. This accommodation centre is designed to be a self-contained home for all Olympic participants, and is furnished with cafeterias, health clinics, and locations for religious expression.

The IOC has allowed the formation of National Olympic Committees (NOCs) to represent individual nations. These do not meet the strict requirements for political sovereignty that other international organisations demand. As a result, colonies and dependencies are permitted to compete at Olympic Games, examples being territories such as Puerto Rico, Bermuda, and Hong Kong, all of which compete as separate nations despite being legally a part of another country. The current version of the Olympic Charter allows for the establishment of new NOCs to represent nations that qualify as &quot;an independent State recognised by the international community&quot;. Consequently, the IOC did not allow the formation of NOCs for Sint Maarten and Curaçao when they gained the same constitutional status as Aruba in 2010, although the IOC had recognised the Aruban Olympic Committee in 1986. Since 2012, athletes from the former Netherlands Antilles have had the option to represent either the Netherlands or Aruba.

===Cost of the Games===

The Oxford Olympics Study 2016 found that, since 1960, sports-related costs for the Summer Games were on average US$5.2 billion and for the Winter Games $3.1 billion. These figures do not include wider infrastructure costs like roads, urban rail, and airports, which often cost as much or more than the sports-related costs. The most expensive Summer Games were Beijing 2008 at US$40–44 billion, and the most expensive Winter Games were Sochi 2014 at US$51 billion. As of 2016, costs per athlete were, on average, US$599,000 for the Summer Games and $1.3 million for the Winter Games; for London 2012, the cost per athlete was $1.4 million, and the figure was $7.9 million for Sochi 2014.

Where ambitious construction for the 1976 Summer Games in Montreal and the 1980 Summer Games in Moscow had burdened organisers with expenses greatly in excess of revenues, Los Angeles strictly controlled expenses for the 1984 Summer Games by using existing facilities and only two new that were paid for by corporate sponsors. The Organizing Committee led by Peter Ueberroth used some of the profits to endow the LA84 Foundation to promote youth sports in Southern California, educate coaches and maintain a sports library. The 1984 Summer Olympics are often considered until that date, the most financially successful modern Olympics and a model for future Games.

Budget overruns are common for the Games. Average overrun for Games since 1960 is 156% in real terms, which means that actual costs turned out to be on average 2.56 times the budget that was estimated at the time of winning the bid to host the Games. Montreal 1976 had the highest cost overrun for Summer Games, and for any Games, at 720%; Lake Placid 1980 had the highest cost overrun for Winter Games, at 324%. London 2012 had a cost overrun of 76%, Sochi 2014 of 289%.

It has been documented that cost and cost overrun for the Games follow a power-law distribution, which means that, first, the Games are prone to large cost overruns and, second, it is only a matter of time until an overrun occurs that is larger than the largest to date. In short, hosting the Games is economically and financially extremely risky.

The final cost for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics was reported to be JPY 1,423.8 billion (US$13 billion). This was achieved by balancing revenues and expenditures through various efforts to increase revenue and continuously review expenditures. The primary sources of revenue included the International Olympic Committee (IOC) contribution of JPY 86.8 billion (US$0.8 billion), TOP sponsorship of JPY 56.9 billion (US$0.5 billion), local sponsorship of JPY 376.1 billion (US$3.4 billion), an insurance payout of JPY 50 billion (US$0.5 billion) for the postponement of the Games, and other sources including licensing. The expenditures included JPY 195.5 billion (US$1.8 billion) for venue-related costs and JPY 444.9 billion (US$4 billion) for service expenditures. The total cost also accounted for COVID-19 countermeasures amounting to JPY 35.3 billion (US$0.3 billion). Despite initial estimates, the total costs were reduced by JPY 220.2 billion (US$2 billion) from the budget announced in December 2020, and JPY 29.2 billion (US$0.3 billion) from the estimated budget in December 2021. This successful financial management resulted in a balanced budget for the Tokyo 2020 Games.

===Economic and social impact on host cities and countries===
Seeking a scholarly institution to independently research the Games, Bob Barney led efforts to establish the International Centre for Olympic Studies in 1989, endeavouring to write about sociocultural impacts of the Olympic Games. He felt that the Olympics &quot;is worthy of study because it is one of the biggest meetings in a global context and has many political, economic, and other problems associated with it&quot;. He began &quot;Olympika&quot; in 1992, the first peer-reviewed academic journal focused on the Olympic Games. The International Society of Olympic Historians was founded in 1991, which publishes the &quot;Journal of Olympic History&quot;.

Some economists are sceptical about the economic benefits of hosting the Olympic Games, emphasising that such &quot;mega-events&quot; often have large costs while yielding relatively few tangible benefits in the long run. Hosting (or even bidding for) the Olympics appears to increase the host country&#x27;s exports, as the host or candidate country sends a signal about trade openness when bidding to host the Games. Research suggests that hosting the Summer Olympics has a positive effect on the philanthropic contributions of corporations headquartered in the host city, which seems to benefit the local nonprofit sector. This effect begins in the years leading up to the Games and might persist for several years afterwards, though not permanently.

The Games have had significant negative effects on host communities; for example, the Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions reports that the Olympics displaced more than two million people over two decades, often disproportionately affecting disadvantaged groups. The 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi were the most expensive Olympic Games in history, costing in excess of US$50 billion. According to a report by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development released at the time of the games, the cost would not boost Russia&#x27;s national economy, but could attract business to Sochi and the southern Krasnodar region of Russia as a result of improved services. But by December 2014, eight months after the games &quot;The Guardian&quot; stated that Sochi &quot;now feels like a ghost town&quot;, citing the spread-out nature of the stadiums and arenas and the still-unfinished infrastructure. At least four cities withdrew their bids for the 2022 Winter Olympics, citing the high costs or lack of local support, resulting in only a two-city race between Almaty, Kazakhstan and Beijing, China who hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics. &quot;The Guardian&quot; stated that the biggest threat to the future of the Olympics is few cities or countries want to host them. Bidding for the 2024 Summer Olympics became a two-city race between Paris and Los Angeles, so the IOC took the unusual step of simultaneously awarding both the 2024 Games to Paris and the 2028 Games to Los Angeles. Both of the bids were praised for high technical plans and innovative ways to use a record-breaking number of existing and temporary facilities.

==International Olympic Committee==

The Olympic Movement encompasses a large number of national and international sporting organisations and federations, recognised media partners, as well as athletes, officials, judges, and every other person and institution that agrees to abide by the rules of the Olympic Charter. As the umbrella organisation of the Olympic Movement, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) is responsible for selecting the host city, overseeing the planning of the Olympic Games, updating and approving the Olympic sports programme, and negotiating sponsorship and broadcasting rights.

The Olympic Movement is made of three major elements:
* International Federations (IFs) are the governing bodies that supervise a sport at an international level. For example, the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA) is the IF for association football, and the Fédération Internationale de Volleyball is the international governing body for volleyball. There are currently 35 IFs in the Olympic Movement, representing each of the Olympic sports.
* National Olympic Committees (NOCs) represent and regulate the Olympic Movement within each country. For example, the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) is the NOC of the Russian Federation. There are currently 206 NOCs recognised by the IOC.
* Organising Committees for the Olympic Games (OCOGs) are temporary committees responsible for the organisation of each Olympic Games. OCOGs are dissolved after each Games once the final report is delivered to the IOC.

French and English are the official languages of the Olympic Movement. The other language used at each Olympic Games is the language of the host country (or languages, if a country has more than one official language apart from French or English). Every proclamation (such as the announcement of each country during the parade of nations in the opening ceremony) is spoken in these three (or more) languages, or the main two depending on whether the host country is an English or French speaking country: French is always spoken first, followed by an English translation, and then the dominant language of the host nation (when this is not English or French).

===Allegations of bribery and corruption===
The IOC has often been accused of being an intractable organisation, with several life members on the committee. The presidential terms of Avery Brundage and Juan Antonio Samaranch were especially controversial. Brundage fought strongly for amateurism and against the commercialisation of the Olympic Games, even as these attitudes came to be seen as incongruous with the realities of modern sports. The advent of state-sponsored athletes from the Eastern Bloc countries further eroded the ideology of the pure amateur, as it placed self-financed amateurs of Western countries at a disadvantage. Brundage was accused of antisemitism and of racism in resisting the exclusion of South Africa. Under the Samaranch presidency, the office was accused of both nepotism and corruption. Samaranch&#x27;s ties with the Franco regime in Spain were also a source of criticism.

In 1998, it was reported that several IOC members had taken gifts from members of the Salt Lake City bid committee for the hosting of the 2002 Winter Olympics. There were soon four independent investigations underway: by the IOC, the United States Olympic Committee (USOC), the Salt Lake Organizing Committee (SLOC), and the United States Department of Justice (DOJ). Although nothing strictly illegal had occurred, it was felt that the acceptance of the gifts was morally dubious. As a result of the investigation, ten members of the IOC were expelled and a further ten sanctioned. Stricter rules were adopted for future bids, and caps were introduced to define how much IOC members could accept from bid cities. Additionally, new term and age limits were put into place for IOC membership, and fifteen former Olympic athletes were added to the committee. Nevertheless, from sporting and business standpoints, the 2002 Olympics were one of the most successful Winter Games in history; records were set in both the broadcasting and marketing programs. Over 2 billion viewers watched more than 13 billion viewer-hours. The 2002 Games were also a financial success, raising more money with fewer sponsors than any prior Olympic Games, leaving SLOC with a surplus of $40 million. This excess revenue was used to create the Utah Athletic Foundation (also known as the Utah Olympic Legacy Foundation), which maintains and operates many of the surviving Olympic venues.

It was reported in 1999 that the Nagano Olympic bid committee had spent approximately $14 million on entertaining the 62 IOC members and many of their associates. The precise figures are unknown since Nagano destroyed the financial records after the IOC requested that the entertainment expenditures should not be made public.

In July 2000, when the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported on the tangled nature of how the IOC redistributes profits from sponsorships and broadcasting rights, Olympic historian Bob Barney stated that he had &quot;yet to see matters of corruption in the IOC&quot;, but noted there were &quot;matters of unaccountability&quot;. He later noted that when the spotlight is on the athletes, it has &quot;the power to eclipse impressions of scandal or corruption&quot;, with respect to the Olympic bid process.

An August 2004, a BBC documentary, &quot;Panorama: Buying the Games&quot;, reported the results of an investigation into bribes allegedly used in the bidding process for the 2012 Summer Olympics. The documentary claimed that it was possible to bribe IOC members into voting for a particular candidate city. After being narrowly defeated in their bid for the 2012 Games, Parisian mayor Bertrand Delanoë specifically accused the British prime minister Tony Blair and the London bid committee, headed by former Olympic champion Sebastian Coe, of breaking the bid rules. He cited French president Jacques Chirac as a witness; Chirac gave guarded interviews concerning his involvement but the allegation was never fully explored. Turin&#x27;s bid to host the 2006 Winter Olympics was also clouded by controversy; a prominent IOC member, Marc Hodler, closely connected to the rival bid of Sion, alleged bribery of IOC officials by members of the Turin Organising Committee. These accusations led to a wide-ranging investigation, and also served to sour many IOC members against Sion&#x27;s bid which potentially helped Turin to capture the host city nomination.

==Commercialisation==
===Under national organising committees===
The Olympic Games have been commercialised to various degrees since the inaugural 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens, when a number of companies paid for advertising, including Kodak. In 1908, Oxo, mouthwash, and Indian Foot Powder became official sponsors of the London Olympic Games. Coca-Cola first sponsored the Summer Olympics in 1928, and has remained an Olympic sponsor ever since. Before the IOC took control of sponsorship, the NOCs had responsibility for negotiating their own contracts for sponsorship and use of the Olympic symbols.

===Under IOC control===
The IOC originally resisted funding by corporate sponsors. It was not until the retirement of IOC President Avery Brundage, in 1972, that the IOC began to explore the potential of the television medium and the lucrative advertising markets available to them. Under the leadership of Juan Antonio Samaranch, the Games began to shift toward international sponsors who sought to link their products to the Olympic brand.

===Budget===
During the first half of the 20th century, the IOC ran on a small budget. As president of the IOC from 1952 to 1972, Avery Brundage rejected all attempts to link the Olympics with commercial interest. He believed that the lobby of corporate interests would unduly impact the IOC&#x27;s decision-making. His resistance to this revenue stream meant the IOC left organising committees to negotiate their own sponsorship contracts and use the Olympic symbols. When Brundage retired, the IOC had US$2 million in assets; eight years later the IOC coffers had swelled to US$45 million. This was primarily due to a shift in ideology toward expansion of the Games through corporate sponsorship and the sale of television rights. When Juan Antonio Samaranch was elected IOC president in 1980, his desire was to make the IOC financially independent.

The 1984 Summer Olympics became a watershed moment in Olympic history. The Los Angeles-based organising committee, led by Peter Ueberroth, was able to generate a surplus of US$225 million, which was an unprecedented amount at that time. The organising committee had been able to create such a surplus in part by selling exclusive sponsorship rights to select companies. The IOC sought to gain control of these sponsorship rights. Samaranch helped to establish The Olympic Programme (TOP) in 1985, in order to create an Olympic brand. Membership in TOP was, and is, very exclusive and expensive. Fees cost US$50 million for a four-year membership. Members of TOP received exclusive global advertising rights for their product category, and use of the Olympic symbol, the interlocking rings, in their publications and advertisements.

===Effect of television===

The 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin were the first Games to be broadcast on television, though only to local audiences. The 1956 Winter Olympics in Italy were the first internationally televised Olympic Games, and the broadcasting rights for the following Winter Games in California were sold for the first time to specialised television broadcasting networks—CBS paid US$394,000 for the American rights. In the following decades, the Olympics became one of the ideological fronts of the Cold War, and the International Olympic Committee wanted to take advantage of this heightened interest via the broadcast medium. The sale of broadcast rights enabled the IOC to increase the exposure of the Olympic Games, thereby generating more interest, which in turn enhanced the appeal of TV air time to the advertisers. This cycle allowed the IOC to charge ever-increasing fees for those rights. For example, CBS paid US$375 million for the American broadcast rights for the 1998 Nagano Games, while NBC spent US$3.5 billion for the American rights to air every Olympic Games from 2000 to 2012.

In 2011, NBC agreed to a $4.38 billion contract with the IOC to broadcast the Olympics through the 2020 Games, the most expensive television rights deal in Olympic history. NBC then agreed to a $7.75 billion contract extension on 7 May 2014, to air the Olympics through the 2032 Games. NBC also acquired the American television rights to the Youth Olympic Games, beginning in 2014, and the Paralympic Games. More than half of the Olympic Committee&#x27;s global sponsors are American companies, and NBC is one of the major sources of revenue for the IOC.

Viewership increased exponentially from the 1960s until the end of the 20th century. This was due to the advent of satellites for broadcasting live television worldwide starting in 1964, and the introduction of colour television in 1968. The global audience for the 1968 Mexico City Games was estimated to be 600 million, whereas the audience numbers at the Los Angeles Games of 1984 had increased to 900 million; this number had swelled to 3.5 billion by the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. With such high costs charged to broadcast the Games, the added pressure of the internet, and increased competition from cable, the television lobby demanded concessions from the IOC to boost ratings. The IOC responded by making a number of changes to the Olympic programme; at the Summer Games, the gymnastics competition was expanded from seven to nine nights, and a Champions Gala was added to attract greater interest; the events programmes were also expanded for swimming and diving, both popular sports with a broad base of television viewers. Due to the substantial fees NBC has paid for rights to the Olympics, the IOC has allowed the network to influence the event scheduling to maximise U.S. television ratings when possible. Notable examples of maximizing U.S. television viewership include scheduling the finals of the swimming events only during the mornings of the host cities Beijing (during the 2008 Summer Olympics) and Tokyo (during the 2020 Summer Olympics), which coincide with the evening prime time broadcast slots of the United States.

===Olympic marketing===
The funds from licensing programs support everything that goes into the Games, alongside other revenue streams from ticket sales and broadcasting rights, which represent more than 60 percent.

The sale of the Olympic brand has been controversial. The argument is that the Games have become indistinguishable from any other commercialised sporting spectacle. Another criticism is that the Games are funded by host cities and national governments; the IOC incurs none of the cost, yet controls all the rights and profits from the Olympic symbols. The IOC also takes a percentage of all sponsorship and broadcast income. Host cities continue to compete ardently for the right to host the Games, even though there is no certainty that they will earn back their investments. Research has shown that trade is around 30 percent higher for countries that have hosted the Olympics.

==Symbols==
The Olympic Movement uses symbols to represent the ideals embodied in the Olympic Charter. The Olympic symbol, better known as the Olympic rings, consists of five intertwined rings and represents the unity of the five inhabited continents (Africa, The Americas (is considered one continent), Asia, Europe, and Oceania). The coloured version of the rings—blue, yellow, black, green, and red—over a white field forms the Olympic flag. These colours were chosen because every nation had at least one of them on its national flag. The flag was adopted in 1914 but flown for the first time only at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium. It has since been hoisted during each celebration of the Games. The IOC maintains exclusive ownership and control of the use of Olympic Symbols through the Nairobi Treaty on the Protection of the Olympic Symbol.

The Olympic motto, , a Latin expression meaning &quot;Faster, Higher, Stronger&quot; was proposed by Pierre de Coubertin in 1894 and has been official since 1924. The motto was coined by Coubertin&#x27;s friend, the Dominican priest Henri Didon OP, for a Paris youth gathering of 1891.

Coubertin&#x27;s Olympic ideals are expressed in the Olympic creed:

Months before each Games, the Olympic Flame is lit at the Temple of Hera in Olympia in a ceremony that reflects ancient Greek rituals. A female performer, acting as a priestess joined by ten female performers as Vestal Virgins, ignites a torch by placing it inside a parabolic mirror which focuses the sun&#x27;s rays; she then lights the torch of the first relay bearer (who also is a Greek athlete), thus initiating the Olympic torch relay that will carry the flame to the host city&#x27;s Olympic stadium, where it plays an important role in the opening ceremony. Though the flame has been an Olympic symbol since 1928, the torch relay was only introduced at the 1936 Summer Games to promote the Third Reich.

The Olympic mascot, an animal, a human or an anthropomorphic figure representing the cultural heritage of the host country, was introduced in 1968. It has played an important part of the Games&#x27; identity promotion since the 1980 Summer Olympics, when the Soviet bear cub Misha reached international stardom. The mascot of the Summer Olympics in London was named Wenlock after the town of Much Wenlock in Shropshire. Much Wenlock still hosts the Wenlock Olympian Games, which were an inspiration to Pierre de Coubertin for the Olympic Games. The mascot for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games is an anthropomorphic Phrygian cap based on the one Marianne wore at the time of the French Revolution.

==Ceremonies==
===Opening ceremony===

As mandated by the Olympic Charter, various elements frame the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games. This ceremony takes place on a Friday and is held prior to the commencement of the sporting events (apart from some group-stage football matches, softball games, and rowing heats). Most of the rituals for the opening ceremony were established at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp. The ceremony typically starts with the entrance of the president of the International Olympic Committee and a representative of the host country followed by the hoisting of the host country&#x27;s flag and a performance of its national anthem. The host nation then presents artistic displays of music, singing, dance, and theatre representative of its culture. The artistic presentations have grown in scale and complexity as successive hosts attempt to provide a ceremony that outlasts its predecessor&#x27;s in terms of memorability. The opening ceremony of the Beijing Games reportedly cost $100 million, with much of the cost incurred in the artistic segment.

After the artistic portion of the ceremony, the athletes parade into the stadium grouped by nation. Greece is traditionally the first nation to enter and leads the parade in order to honour the origins of the Olympics. Nations then enter the stadium alphabetically according to the host country&#x27;s chosen language, with the host country&#x27;s athletes being the last to enter. During the 2004 Summer Olympics, which was hosted in Athens, Greece, the Greek flag entered the stadium first, while the Greek delegation entered last. Beginning with the 2020 Summer Olympics, the succeeding hosts of the respective Olympic Games (summer or winter) will enter immediately before the current host in descending order. Speeches are given by the President of the Organizing Committee, the IOC president, and the head of state/representative of the host country, formally opening the Games. Finally, the Olympic torch is brought into the stadium and passed on until it reaches the final torch carrier, often a successful Olympic athlete from the host nation, who lights the Olympic flame in the stadium&#x27;s cauldron.

===Closing ceremony===

The closing ceremony of the Olympic Games takes place on a Sunday and after all sporting events have concluded. Flag-bearers from each participating country enter the stadium, followed by the athletes who enter together, without any national distinction. Three national flags are hoisted while the corresponding national anthems are played: the flag of the current host country; the flag of Greece, to honour the birthplace of the Olympic Games; and the flag of the country hosting the next Summer or Winter Olympic Games. The president of the organising committee and the IOC president make their closing speeches, the Games are officially closed, and the Olympic flame is extinguished. In what is known as the Antwerp Ceremony, the current mayor of the city that organised the Games transfers a special Olympic flag to the president of the IOC, who then passes it on to the current mayor of the city hosting the next Olympic Games. The next host nation then also briefly introduces itself with artistic displays of dance and theatre representative of its culture.

As is customary, the last medal presentation of the Games is held as part of the closing ceremony. Typically, the marathon medals are presented at the Summer Olympics, while the cross-country skiing mass start medals are awarded at the Winter Olympics.

===Medal presentation===

A medal ceremony is held after the conclusion of each Olympic event. The winner, and the second- and third-place competitors or teams, stand on top of a three-tiered to be awarded their respective medals by a member of the IOC. After the medals have been received, the national flags of the three medallists are raised while the national anthem of the gold medallist&#x27;s country is played. Volunteering citizens of the host country also act as hosts during the medal ceremonies, assisting the officials who present the medals and acting as flag-bearers. In the Summer Olympics, each medal ceremony is held at the venue where the event has taken place, but the ceremonies at the Winter Olympics are usually held in a special &quot;plaza&quot;.

The practice of awarding Olympic medals at podium ceremonies was established at the 1932 Winter Olympics, based on pedestals used at the 1930 British Empire Games, as proposed by Melville Marks Robinson.

==Sports==

The Olympic Games programme consists of 35 sports, 30 disciplines and 408 events. For example, wrestling is a Summer Olympic sport, comprising two disciplines: Greco-Roman and Freestyle. It is further broken down into fourteen events for men and four events for women, each representing a different weight class. The Summer Olympics programme includes 26 sports, while the Winter Olympics programme features 15 sports. Athletics, swimming, fencing, and artistic gymnastics are the only summer sports that have never been absent from the Olympic programme. Cross-country skiing, figure skating, ice hockey, Nordic combined, ski jumping, and speed skating have been featured at every Winter Olympics programme since its inception in 1924. Current Olympic sports, like badminton, basketball, and volleyball, first appeared on the programme as demonstration sports, and were later promoted to full Olympic sports. Some sports that were featured in earlier Games were later dropped from the programme.

Olympic sports are governed by international sports federations (IFs) recognised by the IOC as the global supervisors of those sports. There are 35 federations represented at the IOC. There are sports recognised by the IOC that are not included in the Olympic programme. These sports are not considered Olympic sports, but they can be promoted to this status during a programme revision that occurs in the first IOC session following a celebration of the Olympic Games. During such revisions, sports can be excluded or included in the programme on the basis of a two-thirds majority vote of the members of the IOC. There are recognised sports that have never been on an Olympic programme in any capacity, for example, orienteering.

In October and November 2004, the IOC established an Olympic Programme Commission, which was tasked with reviewing the sports on the Olympic programme and all non-Olympic recognised sports. The goal was to apply a systematic approach to establishing the Olympic programme for each celebration of the Games. The commission formulated seven criteria to judge whether a sport should be included on the Olympic programme. These criteria are history and tradition of the sport, universality, popularity of the sport, image, athletes&#x27; health, development of the International Federation that governs the sport, and costs of holding the sport. From this study five recognised sports emerged as candidates for inclusion at the 2012 Summer Olympics: golf, karate, rugby sevens, roller sports and squash. These sports were reviewed by the IOC Executive Board and then referred to the General Session in Singapore in July 2005. Of the five sports recommended for inclusion only two were selected as finalists: karate and squash. Neither sport attained the required two-thirds vote and consequently they were not promoted to the Olympic programme. In October 2009 the IOC voted to instate golf and rugby sevens as Olympic sports for the 2016 and 2020 Summer Olympic Games.

The 114th IOC Session, in 2002, limited the Summer Games programme to a maximum of 28 sports, 301 events, and 10,500 athletes. Three years later, at the 117th IOC Session, the first major programme revision was performed, which resulted in the exclusion of baseball and softball from the official programme of the 2012 London Games. Since there was no agreement in the promotion of two other sports, the 2012 programme featured just 26 sports. The 2016 and 2020 Games will return to the maximum of 28 sports given the addition of rugby and golf.

===Amateurism and professionalism===
The ethos of the aristocracy as exemplified in the English public school greatly influenced Pierre de Coubertin. The public schools subscribed to the belief that sport formed an important part of education, an attitude summed up in the saying &quot;mens sana in corpore sano&quot;, a sound mind in a sound body. In this ethos, a gentleman was one who became an all-rounder, not the best at one specific thing. There was also a prevailing concept of fairness, in which practising or training was considered tantamount to cheating. Those who practised a sport professionally were considered to have an unfair advantage over those who practised it merely as a hobby.

The exclusion of professionals caused several controversies throughout the history of the modern Olympics. The 1912 Olympic pentathlon and decathlon champion Jim Thorpe was stripped of his medals when it was discovered that he had played semi-professional baseball before the Olympics. His medals were posthumously restored by the IOC in 1983 after a ruling found that the decision to strip him of his medals fell outside of the 30-day period. Swiss and Austrian skiers boycotted the 1936 Winter Olympics in support of their skiing teachers, who were not allowed to compete because they earned money with their sport and were thus considered professionals.

The advent of the state-sponsored &quot;full-time amateur athlete&quot; of the Eastern Bloc countries eroded the ideology of the pure amateur, as it put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage. The Soviet Union entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students, soldiers, or working in a profession, but all of whom were in reality paid by the state to train on a full-time basis. The situation greatly disadvantaged American and Western European athletes, and was a major factor in the decline of American medal hauls in the 1970s and 1980s. As a result, the Olympics shifted away from amateurism, as envisioned by Pierre de Coubertin, to allowing participation of professional athletes, but only in the 1990s, after the collapse of the Soviet Union and its influence within the International Olympic Committee.

====Team Canada ice hockey dispute====
Near the end of the 1960s, the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) felt their amateur players could no longer be competitive against the Soviet team&#x27;s full-time athletes and the other constantly improving European teams. They pushed for the ability to use players from professional leagues but met opposition from the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) and IOC. At the IIHF Congress in 1969, the IIHF decided to allow Canada to use nine non-NHL professional hockey players at the 1970 World Championships in Montreal and Winnipeg, Canada. The decision was reversed in January 1970 after Brundage said that ice hockey&#x27;s status as an Olympic sport would be in jeopardy if the change was made. In response, Canada withdrew from international ice hockey competition and officials stated that they would not return until &quot;open competition&quot; was instituted. Günther Sabetzki became president of the IIHF in 1975 and helped to resolve the dispute with the CAHA. In 1976, the IIHF agreed to allow &quot;open competition&quot; between all players in the World Championships. However, NHL players were still not allowed to play in the Olympics until 1988, because of the IOC&#x27;s amateur-only policy.

==Controversies==
===Boycotts===


Australia, France, Greece, Switzerland and the United Kingdom are the only countries to be represented at every Olympic Games since their inception in 1896. While countries sometimes miss an Olympics due to a lack of qualified athletes, some choose to boycott a celebration of the Games for various reasons. The Olympic Council of Ireland boycotted the 1936 Berlin Games, because the IOC insisted its team needed to be restricted to the Irish Free State rather than representing the entire island of Ireland.

There were three boycotts of the 1956 Melbourne Olympics: the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland refused to attend because of the repression of the Hungarian uprising by the Soviet Union, but did send an equestrian delegation to Stockholm; Cambodia, Egypt, Iraq, and Lebanon boycotted the Games because of the Suez Crisis; and the People&#x27;s Republic of China boycotted the Games due to the participation of the Republic of China, composed of athletes coming from Taiwan.

In 1972 and 1976 a large number of African countries threatened the IOC with a boycott to force them to ban South Africa and Rhodesia, because of their segregationist rule. New Zealand was also one of the African boycott targets, because its national rugby union team had toured apartheid-ruled South Africa. The IOC conceded in the first two cases, but refused to ban New Zealand on the grounds that rugby was not an Olympic sport. Fulfilling their threat, twenty African countries were joined by Guyana and Iraq in a withdrawal from the Montreal Games, after a few of their athletes had already competed.

The Republic of China (Taiwan) was excluded from the 1976 Games by order of Pierre Elliott Trudeau, the prime minister of Canada. Trudeau&#x27;s action was widely condemned as having brought shame on Canada for having succumbed to political pressure to keep the Chinese delegation from competing under its name. The ROC refused a proposed compromise that would have still allowed them to use the ROC flag and anthem as long as the name was changed. Athletes from Taiwan did not participate again until 1984, when they returned under the name of Chinese Taipei and with a special flag and anthem.

In 1980 and 1984, the Cold War opponents boycotted each other&#x27;s Games. The United States and sixty-five other countries boycotted the Moscow Olympics in 1980 because of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. This boycott reduced the number of nations participating to 80, the lowest number since 1956. The Soviet Union and 15 other nations countered by boycotting the Los Angeles Olympics of 1984. Although a boycott led by the Soviet Union depleted the field in certain sports, 140 National Olympic Committees took part, which was a record at the time. The fact that Romania, a Warsaw Pact country, opted to compete despite Soviet demands led to a warm reception of the Romanian team by the United States. When the Romanian athletes entered during the opening ceremonies, they received a standing ovation from the spectators, which comprised mostly U.S. citizens. The boycotting nations of the Eastern Bloc staged their own alternate event, the Friendship Games, in July and August.

There had been growing calls for boycotts of Chinese goods and the 2008 Olympics in Beijing in protest of China&#x27;s human rights record, and in response to Tibetan disturbances. Ultimately, no nation supported a boycott. In August 2008, the government of Georgia called for a boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics, set to be held in Sochi, Russia, in response to Russia&#x27;s participation in the 2008 South Ossetia war. Continuing human rights violations in China have led to &quot;diplomatic boycotts&quot;, where athletes still compete at the Games but diplomats do not attend, of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing by several countries, most notably the United States.

===Politics===
The Olympic Games have been used as a platform to promote political ideologies almost from its inception. Nazi Germany wished to portray the National Socialist Party as benevolent and peace-loving when they hosted the 1936 Games, though they used the Games to display Aryan superiority. Germany was the most successful nation at the Games, which did much to support their allegations of Aryan supremacy, but notable victories by African American Jesse Owens, who won four gold medals, and Hungarian Jew Ibolya Csák, blunted the message. The Soviet Union did not participate until the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki. Instead, starting in 1928, the Soviets organised an international sports event called Spartakiads. During the interwar period of the 1920s and 1930s, communist and socialist organisations in several countries, including the United States, attempted to counter what they called the &quot;bourgeois&quot; Olympics with the Workers Olympics. It was not until the 1956 Summer Games that the Soviets emerged as a sporting superpower and, in doing so, took full advantage of the publicity that came with winning at the Olympics. Soviet Union&#x27;s success might be attributed to a heavy state&#x27;s investment in sports to fulfill its political agenda on an international stage.

Individual athletes have also used the Olympic stage to promote their own political agenda. At the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, two American track and field athletes, Tommie Smith and John Carlos, who finished first and third in the 200 metres, performed the Black Power salute on the victory stand. The second-place finisher, Peter Norman of Australia, wore an Olympic Project for Human Rights badge in support of Smith and Carlos. In response to the protest, IOC president Avery Brundage ordered Smith and Carlos suspended from the US team and banned from the Olympic Village. When the US Olympic Committee refused, Brundage threatened to ban the entire US track team. This threat led to the expulsion of the two athletes from the Games. In another notable incident in the gymnastics competition, while standing on the medal podium after the balance beam event final, in which Natalia Kuchinskaya of the Soviet Union had controversially taken the gold, Czechoslovakian gymnast Věra Čáslavská quietly turned her head down and away during the playing of the Soviet national anthem. The action was Čáslavská&#x27;s silent protest against the recent Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. Her protest was repeated when she accepted her medal for her floor exercise routine when the judges changed the preliminary scores of the Soviet Larisa Petrik to allow her to tie with Čáslavská for the gold. While Čáslavská&#x27;s countrymen supported her actions and her outspoken opposition to Communism (she had publicly signed and supported Ludvik Vaculik&#x27;s &quot;Two Thousand Words&quot; manifesto), the new regime responded by banning her from both sporting events and international travel for many years and made her an outcast from society until the fall of communism.

Currently, the government of Iran has taken steps to avoid any competition between its athletes and those from Israel. An Iranian judoka, Arash Miresmaeili, did not compete in a match against an Israeli during the 2004 Summer Olympics. Although he was officially disqualified for being overweight, Miresmaeli was awarded US$125,000 in prize money by the Iranian government, an amount paid to all Iranian gold medal winners. He was officially cleared of intentionally avoiding the bout, but his receipt of the prize money raised suspicion.

In 2022, in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the IOC Executive Board &quot;recommends no participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes and officials, urges International Sports Federations and organizers of sports events worldwide to do everything in their power to ensure that no athlete or sports official from Russia or Belarus be allowed to take part under the name of Russia or Belarus.&quot; In 2023, the IOC announced that Russian and Belarusian athletes could participate in the Olympics under certain conditions: they must not represent their country or any associated organization, and those actively supporting the Russian invasion of Ukraine are barred from competing. This decision aimed to allow athletes to compete and enhance their stature. While 32 athletes accepted the invitation, 28 qualified athletes declined. Competing under a neutral flag and uniform, these athletes had a neutral song played if they won any medals, instead of their national anthems. Additionally, the audience was prohibited from waving their flags.

===Use of performance-enhancing drugs===
In the early 20th century, many Olympic athletes began using drugs to improve their athletic abilities. For example, in 1904, Thomas Hicks, a gold medallist in the marathon, was given strychnine by his coach (at the time, taking different substances was allowed, as there was no data regarding the effect of these substances on a body of an athlete). The only Olympic death linked to performance enhancing occurred at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. A Danish cyclist, Knud Enemark Jensen, fell from his bicycle and later died. A coroner&#x27;s inquiry found that he was under the influence of amphetamines. By the mid-1960s, sports federations started to ban the use of performance-enhancing drugs; in 1967 the IOC followed suit.

According to British journalist Andrew Jennings, a KGB colonel stated that the agency&#x27;s officers had posed as anti-doping authorities from the International Olympic Committee to undermine doping tests and that Soviet athletes were &quot;rescued with [these] tremendous efforts&quot;. On the topic of the 1980 Summer Olympics, a 1989 Australian study said &quot;There is hardly a medal winner at the Moscow Games, certainly not a gold medal winner, who is not on one sort of drug or another: usually several kinds. The Moscow Games might as well have been called the Chemists&#x27; Games.&quot;

In 2016, documents obtained revealed the Soviet Union&#x27;s plans for a statewide doping system in track and field in preparation for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Dated prior to the country&#x27;s decision to boycott the Games, the document detailed the existing steroids operations of the program, along with suggestions for further enhancements. The communication, directed to the Soviet Union&#x27;s head of track and field, was prepared by Sergei Portugalov of the Institute for Physical Culture. Portugalov was also one of the main figures involved in the implementation of the Russian doping programme prior to the 2016 Summer Olympics.

The first Olympic athlete to test positive for the use of performance-enhancing drugs was Hans-Gunnar Liljenwall, a Swedish pentathlete at the 1968 Summer Olympics, who lost his bronze medal for alcohol use. One of the most publicised doping-related disqualifications occurred after the 1988 Summer Olympics where Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson (who won the 100-metre dash) tested positive for stanozolol.

In 1999, the IOC formed the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) in an effort to systematise the research and detection of performance-enhancing drugs. There was a sharp increase in positive drug tests at the 2000 Summer Olympics and 2002 Winter Olympics due to improved testing conditions. Several medallists in weightlifting and cross-country skiing from post-Soviet states were disqualified because of doping offences. The IOC-established drug testing regimen (now known as the Olympic Standard) has set the worldwide benchmark that other sporting federations attempt to emulate. During the Beijing games, 3,667 athletes were tested by the IOC under the auspices of the World Anti-Doping Agency. Both urine and blood tests were used to detect banned substances. In London over 6,000 Olympic and Paralympic athletes were tested. Prior to the Games 107 athletes tested positive for banned substances and were not allowed to compete.

In 2024, rumors about China&#x27;s doping spread as many of the athletes, especially in swimming, were accused of doping before Tokyo 2020. 23 Chinese swimmers were tested positive for prohibited substances, with both the World Anti-Doping Agency and World Aquatics accepting Chinese claims that positive tests were caused by tainted food. After the FBI and Justice Department started investigating, the IOC threatened to revoke the 2034 Olympics in Salt Lake City, unless they dropped the investigation.

====Russian doping scandal====
Doping in Russian sports has a systemic nature. Russia has had 44 Olympic medals stripped for doping violations – the most of any country, and more than a quarter of the global total. From 2011 to 2015, more than a thousand Russian competitors in various sports, including summer, winter, and Paralympic sports, benefited from a cover-up. Russia was partially banned from the 2016 Summer Olympics and was banned from the 2018 Winter Olympics (while still being allowed to participate as the &quot;Olympic Athletes from Russia&quot;) due to the state-sponsored doping programme.

In December 2019, Russia was banned for four years from all major sporting events for systematic doping and lying to WADA. The ban was issued by WADA on 9 December 2019, and the Russian anti-doping agency RUSADA had 21 days to make an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). The ban meant that Russian athletes would only be allowed to compete under the Olympic flag after passing anti-doping tests. Russia appealed the decision to the CAS. The CAS, on review of Russia&#x27;s appeal of its case from WADA, ruled on 17 December 2020, to reduce the penalty that WADA had placed. Instead of banning Russia from sporting events, the ruling allowed Russia to participate at the Olympics and other international events, but for a period of two years, the team cannot use the Russian name, flag, or anthem and must present themselves as &quot;Neutral Athlete&quot; or &quot;Neutral Team&quot;. The ruling does allow for team uniforms to display &quot;Russia&quot; on the uniform as well as the use of the Russian flag colors within the uniform&#x27;s design, although the name should be up to equal predominance as the &quot;Neutral Athlete/Team&quot; designation.

In February 2022, during the Beijing Olympics, the international news media reported on 9 February that the issue of doping was again raised over a positive test for trimetazidine by the ROC&#x27;s Kamila Valieva, which was officially confirmed on 11 February. Valieva&#x27;s sample in question was taken by the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) at the 2022 Russian Figure Skating Championships on 25 December, but the sample was not analyzed at the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) laboratory where it was sent for testing until 8 February, one day after the team event concluded. The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) was expected to hear the case on 13 February with a decision scheduled for announcement on 14 February ahead of her scheduled appearance in the women&#x27;s singles event beginning 15 February. Due to Valieva being a minor at the time, as well as being classified as a &quot;protected person&quot; under WADA guidelines, RUSADA and the IOC announced on 12 February that they would broaden the scope of their respective investigations to include members of her entourage (e.g. coaches, team doctors, etc.). By the end of the Beijing Olympics, a total five athletes were reported for doping violations. A decision by RUSADA was issued in mid-October, which was endorsed by WADA, stating that the details of the Valieva hearing and its scheduled dates would be placed under international guidelines for the protection of minors (Valieva was 15 years old when the positive test results were disclosed) and not to be disclosed publicly. Although Russia as a country is currently banned from participating in international skating events due to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Valieva has continued to compete within Russian borders without being hindered by RUSADA as recently as the Russian Grand Prix held in October 2022. In mid-November, WADA requested that CAS take up the review of the Valieva case with an eye towards a 4-year suspension of Valieva, which would exclude her from competition at the next Winter Olympics, and to rescind her first-place performance at the previous Beijing Olympics because, &quot;the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) did not meet a WADA-imposed Nov. 4 deadline to deliver a verdict on Valiyeva&#x27;s case.&quot;

===Sex discrimination===
Women were first allowed to compete at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, but at the 1992 Summer Olympics 35 countries were still only fielding all-male delegations. This number dropped rapidly over the following years. In 2000, Bahrain sent two women competitors for the first time: Fatema Hameed Gerashi and Mariam Mohamed Hadi Al Hilli. In 2004, Robina Muqimyar and Fariba Rezayee became the first women to compete for Afghanistan at the Olympics. In 2008, the United Arab Emirates sent female athletes for the first time; Maitha Al Maktoum competed in taekwondo, and Latifa Al Maktoum in equestrian. Both athletes were from Dubai&#x27;s ruling family.

By 2010, only three countries had never sent female athletes to the Games: Brunei, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar. Brunei had taken part in only three celebrations of the Games, sending a single athlete on each occasion, but Saudi Arabia and Qatar had been competing regularly with all-male teams. In 2010, the International Olympic Committee announced it would &quot;press&quot; these countries to enable and facilitate the participation of women for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. Anita DeFrantz, chair of the IOC&#x27;s Women and Sports Commission, suggested that countries be barred if they prevented women from competing. Shortly thereafter, the Qatar Olympic Committee announced that it &quot;hoped to send up to four female athletes in shooting and fencing&quot; to the 2012 Summer Games.
In 2008, Ali Al-Ahmed, director of the Institute for Gulf Affairs, likewise called for Saudi Arabia to be barred from the Games, describing its ban on women athletes as a violation of the International Olympic Committee charter. He noted: &quot;For the last 15 years, many international nongovernmental organisations worldwide have been trying to lobby the IOC for better enforcement of its own laws banning gender discrimination.  While their efforts did result in increasing numbers of women Olympians, the IOC has been reluctant to take a strong position and threaten the discriminating countries with suspension or expulsion.&quot; In July 2010, &quot;The Independent&quot; reported: &quot;Pressure is growing on the International Olympic Committee to kick out Saudi Arabia, who are likely to be the only major nation not to include women in their Olympic team for 2012. ... Should Saudi Arabia ... send a male-only team to London, we understand they will face protests from equal rights and women&#x27;s groups which threaten to disrupt the Games&quot;.

At the 2012 Summer Olympics, every participating nation included female athletes for the first time in Olympic history. Saudi Arabia included two female athletes in its delegation; Qatar, four; and Brunei, one (Maziah Mahusin, in the 400 m hurdles). Qatar made one of its first female Olympians, Bahiya al-Hamad (shooting), its flagbearer at the 2012 Games, and runner Maryam Yusuf Jamal of Bahrain became the first Persian Gulf female athlete to win a medal when she won a bronze for her showing in the 1500 m race.

The only sports on the Olympic programme that features men and women individually competing against one another are the equestrian disciplines, as there is no &quot;Women&#x27;s Eventing&quot;, or &quot;Men&#x27;s Dressage&quot;. As of 2008, there were still more medal events for men than women. With the addition of women&#x27;s boxing to the programme in the 2012 Summer Olympics, however, women athletes were able to compete in all the sports open to men. In the winter Olympics, women are still unable to compete in the Nordic combined. After men were included in artistic swimming at the Paris 2024 games, the only remaining Olympic event in which male athletes may not compete is rhythmic gymnastics. Despite being eligible to qualify for the 2024 Paris games, no men were included on any artistic swimming team.

A recent addition to the games has been the inclusion of mixed events, whereby men and women of the same nation compete together against other teams. Beginning in 2018, the sport of curling introduced a mixed event where teams of one man and one women competed in their own tournament for a medal. As of the 2024 Paris games, there are now 13 mixed medal events across 11 disciplines at the summer games.

===War and terrorism===
The world wars caused three Olympiads to pass without a celebration of the Games: the 1916 Games were cancelled because of World War I, and the summer and winter games of 1940 and 1944 were cancelled because of World War II. The Russo-Georgian War between Georgia and Russia erupted on the opening day of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Both American President George W. Bush and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin were attending the Olympics at that time and spoke together about the conflict at a luncheon hosted by the Chinese president Hu Jintao.

Terrorism most directly affected the Olympic Games in 1972. When the Summer Games were held in Munich, Germany, eleven members of the Israeli Olympic team were taken hostage by the Palestinian terrorist group Black September in what is now known as the Munich massacre. The terrorists killed two of the athletes soon after taking them hostage and killed the other nine during a failed liberation attempt. A German police officer and five of the terrorists also died. Following the selection of Barcelona, Spain, to host the 1992 Summer Olympics, the separatist ETA terrorist organisation launched attacks in the region, including the 1991 bombing in the Catalonian city of Vic that killed ten people.

Terrorism affected two Olympic Games held in the United States. During the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, a bomb was detonated at the Centennial Olympic Park, killing two people and injuring 111 others. The bomb was set by Eric Rudolph, an American domestic terrorist, who is serving a life sentence for the bombing. The 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City took place just five months after the September 11 attacks, which meant a higher level of security than ever before provided for an Olympic Games. The opening ceremonies of the Games featured symbols relating to 9/11, including the flag that flew at Ground Zero and honour guards of NYPD and FDNY members.

==Citizenship==
===IOC rules for citizenship===
The Olympic Charter requires that an athlete be a legal national of the country for which they compete. Dual nationals may compete for either country, as long as three years have passed since the competitor competed for the former country. However, if the NOCs and IF involved agree, then the IOC Executive Board may reduce or cancel this period. This waiting period exists only for athletes who previously competed for one nation and want to compete for another. If an athlete gains a new or second nationality, then they do not need to wait any designated amount of time before participating for the new or second nation. The IOC is only concerned with issues of citizenship and nationality after individual nations have granted citizenship to athletes.

In October 2023, the IOC suspended the Russian Olympic Committee, and the suspension was upheld in February 2024 by the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Without any NOC from Russia to approve a change of citizenship in under three years from Russia to another country, the IOC Executive Board approved changes of nationality in November 2023
and March 2024 for a total of five athletes from Russia to another country, including Georgi Tiblov and Aleksandr Komarov in wrestling (from Russia to Serbia), Mikhail Yakolev in cycling (from Russia to Israel), Valeriia Liubimova in cycling, and Anastasiia Kirpichnikova in swimming (both from Russia to France).

===Reasons for changing citizenship===
Occasionally, an athlete will become a citizen of a different country to enable them to compete in the Olympics. This is often because they are attracted to sponsorship deals or training facilities in the other country, or the athlete might be unable to qualify from within their country of birth. In preparation for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, the Russian Olympic Committee naturalised a South Korean-born short-track speed-skater, Ahn Hyun-soo, and an American-born snowboarder, Vic Wild. The two athletes won five gold medals and one bronze medal between them at the 2014 Games.

==Champions and medallists==
Medals are awarded to the athletes or teams who place first, second, and third in each event. The winners receive gold medals, which were solid gold until 1912, later made of gilded silver, and now gold-plated silver. Every gold medal must contain at least six grams of pure gold. The runners-up are awarded silver medals and the third-place athletes receive bronze medals. In events contested by a single-elimination tournament (most notably boxing), third place might not be determined and the losers of both semi-finals each receive a bronze medal.

At the 1896 Olympics, only the winner and runner-up of each event received medalssilver for first and bronze for second, with no gold medals awarded. The current three-medal format was introduced at the 1904 Olympics. From 1948 onward, athletes placing fourth, fifth, and sixth have received certificates, which came to be known officially as Olympic diplomas; from 1984, these have also been awarded to the seventh- and eighth-place finishers. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, the gold, silver, and bronze medal winners were also presented with olive wreaths. The IOC does not keep statistics of medals won on a national level (except for team sports), but the NOCs and the media record medal statistics and use them as a measure of each nation&#x27;s success.

==Nations==
===Participants===

As of the 2020 Summer Games in Tokyo, all of the current 207 NOCs (and 19 obsolete NOCs) have participated in at least one edition of the Summer Olympics. Competitors from five nations—Australia, France, Great Britain, Greece, and Switzerland—have competed in all 28 Summer Olympics. Athletes competing under the Olympic flag, Mixed Teams and the Refugee Team have competed at six Summer Olympics Games.

A total of 119 NOCs (110 of the current 207 NOCs, and nine obsolete NOCs) have participated in at least one edition of the Winter Olympics. Competitors from 12 nations — Austria, Canada, Finland, France, Great Britain, Hungary, Italy, Norway, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States — have participated in all 23 Winter Games to date.

===Host nations and cities===

The host city for an Olympic Games had historically been chosen seven to eight years ahead of their celebration. Beginning with the 2024 and 2028 Olympics selection process in 2017, the IOC has proceeded to announce the winning bid with a longer lead-in time in order to provide time for the winning cities/regions to prepare. The process of selection is carried out in two phases that span a two-year period. The prospective host city applies to its country&#x27;s National Olympic Committee; if more than one city from the same country submits a proposal to its NOC, the national committee typically holds an internal selection, since only one city per NOC can be presented to the International Olympic Committee for consideration. Once the deadline for submission of proposals by the NOCs is reached, the first phase (Application) begins with the applicant cities asked to complete a questionnaire regarding several key criteria related to the organisation of the Olympic Games. In this form, the applicants must give assurances that they will comply with the Olympic Charter and with any other regulations established by the IOC Executive Committee. The evaluation of the filled questionnaires by a specialised group provides the IOC with an overview of each applicant&#x27;s project and their potential to host the Games. On the basis of this technical evaluation, the IOC Executive Board selects the applicants that will proceed to the candidature stage.

Once the candidate cities are selected, they must submit to the IOC a bigger and more detailed presentation of their project as part of a candidature file. Each city is thoroughly analysed by an evaluation commission. This commission will also visit the candidate cities, interviewing local officials and inspecting prospective venue sites, and submit a report on its findings one month prior to the IOC&#x27;s final decision. During the interview process the candidate city must also guarantee that it will be able to fund the Games. After the work of the evaluation commission, a list of candidates is presented to the General Session of the IOC, which must assemble in a country that does not have a candidate city in the running. The IOC members gathered in the Session have the final vote on the host city. Once elected, the host city bid committee (together with the NOC of the respective country) signs a Host City Contract with the IOC, officially becoming an Olympic host nation and host city.

By 2032, the Olympic Games will have been hosted by 47 cities in 23 countries. As of 2021, since the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, the Olympics have been held in Asia or Oceania four times, a sharp increase compared to the previous 92 years of modern Olympic history. The 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro were the first Olympics for a South American country. No bids from countries in Africa have succeeded, although Egypt (thrice) and South Africa (in 2004) have tried.

<doc id="22577" wikidata="Q35501" url="?curid=22577" title="Old Prussian language">
<text>Old Prussian is an extinct West Baltic language belonging to the Baltic branch of the Indo-European languages, which was once spoken by the Old Prussians, the Baltic peoples of the Prussian region. The language is called Old Prussian to avoid confusion with the German dialects of Low Prussian and High Prussian and with the adjective &quot;Prussian&quot; as it relates to the later German state. Old Prussian began to be written down in the Latin alphabet in about the 13th century, and a small amount of literature in the language survives. In modern times, there has been a revival movement of Old Prussian, and there are families which use Old Prussian as their first language.

==Classification==
Old Prussian is an Indo-European language belonging to the Baltic branch. It is considered to be a Western Baltic language.

Old Prussian was closely related to the other extinct West Baltic languages, namely Sudovian, West Galindian and possibly Skalvian and Old Curonian. Other linguists consider Western Galindian and Skalvian to be Prussian dialects.

It is related to the East Baltic languages such as Lithuanian and Latvian, and more distantly related to Slavic. Compare the words for &#x27;land&#x27;: Old Prussian &quot;&quot; [zemē], , , , () and .

Old Prussian had loanwords from Slavic languages (e.g., Old Prussian &#x27; [kurtis] &#x27;hound&#x27;, like Lithuanian &#x27; and Latvian &#x27;, cognate with Slavic (compare , ; ; )), as well as a few borrowings from Germanic, including from Gothic (e.g., Old Prussian &#x27; &#x27;awl&#x27; as with Lithuanian &#x27;, Latvian &#x27;) and from Scandinavian languages.

==Influence on other languages==
===Germanic===
The Low German language spoken in Prussia (or West Prussia and East Prussia), called Low Prussian (cf. High Prussian, High German), preserved a number of Baltic Prussian words, such as &#x27;, from the Old Prussian &#x27;, for &quot;shoe&quot; in contrast to common (Standard German &quot;&quot;), as did the High Prussian Oberland subdialect.

Until the 1938 changing of place names in East Prussia, Old Prussian river- and place-names, such as &#x27; and &#x27;, could still be found.

===Polish===
One of the hypotheses regarding the origin of – a phonological merger of dentialveolar and postalveolar sibilants in many Polish dialects – states that it originated as a feature of Polonized Old Prussians in Masuria (see Masurian dialects) and spread from there.

==History==

===Original territory===

In addition to Prussia proper, the original territory of the Old Prussians may have included eastern parts of Pomerelia (some parts of the region east of the Vistula River). The language may also have been spoken much further east and south in what became Polesia and part of Podlasie, before conquests by Rus and Poles starting in the 10th century and the German colonisation of the area starting in the 12th century.

===Decline===
With the conquest of the Old Prussian territory by the Teutonic Knights in the 13th century, and the subsequent influx of Polish, Lithuanian and especially German speakers, Old Prussian experienced a 400-year-long decline as an &quot;oppressed language of an oppressed population&quot;. Groups of people from Germany, Poland, Lithuania, Scotland, England, and Austria (see Salzburg Protestants) found refuge in Prussia during the Protestant Reformation and thereafter. Old Prussian ceased to be spoken probably around the beginning of the 18th century, because many of its remaining speakers died in the famines and the bubonic plague outbreak which harrowed the East Prussian countryside and towns from 1709 until 1711.

===Revitalization===

In the 1980s, linguists Vladimir Toporov and Vytautas Mažiulis started reconstructing the Prussian language as a scientific project and a humanitarian gesture. Some enthusiasts thereafter began to revive the language based on their reconstruction.

Most current speakers live in Germany, Poland, Lithuania and Kaliningrad (Russia). Additionally, a few children are native in Revived Prussian.

Today, there are websites, online dictionaries, learning apps and games for Revived Prussian, and one children&#x27;s book – Antoine de Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s &quot;The Little Prince&quot; – was translated into Revived Prussian by Piotr Szatkowski (Pīteris Šātkis) and published by the Prusaspirā Society in 2015. Moreover, some bands use Revived Prussian, most notably in the Kaliningrad Oblast by the bands Romowe Rikoito, Kellan and Āustras Laīwan, as well as in Lithuania by Kūlgrinda on their 2005 album (&#x27;Prussian Hymns&#x27;), and Latvia by Rasa Ensemble in 1988 and Valdis Muktupāvels in his 2005 oratorio &quot;Pārcēlātājs Pontifex&quot; featuring several parts sung in Prussian.

==Dialects==
The Elbing Vocabulary and the Catechisms display systematical differences in phonology, vocabulary and grammar. Some scholars postulate that this is due to them being recordings of different dialects:
Pomesanian and Sambian.

Phonetical distinctions are: Pom. &quot;ē&quot; is Samb. &quot;ī&quot; (&#x27; &#x27;world&#x27;); Pom. &quot;ō&quot;, Samb. &quot;ū&quot; after a labial (&#x27; &#x27;mother&#x27;) or Pom. &quot;ō&quot;, Samb. &quot;ā&quot; (&#x27; &#x27;father&#x27;; &#x27; &#x27;brother&#x27;), which influences the nominative suffixes of feminine ā-stems (&#x27; &#x27;blood&#x27;). The nominative suffixes of the masculine o-stems are weakened to &quot;-is&quot; in Pomesanian; in Sambian they are syncopated (&#x27; &#x27;god&#x27;).

Vocabulary differences encompass Pom. &#x27; [zmoy] (cf. Lith. &quot;žmuo)&quot; , Samb. &#x27; &#x27;man&#x27;; Pom. &#x27;, Samb. &#x27; &#x27;son&#x27; and Pom. &#x27;, Samb. &#x27; [lauks] &#x27;field&#x27;.
The neuter gender is more often found in Pomesianan than in Sambian.

Others argue that the Catechisms are written in a Yatvingized Prussian. The differences noted above could therefore be explained as being features of a different West Baltic language Yatvingian/Sudovian.

==Phonology==
===Consonants===
The Prussian language is described to have the following consonants:


There is said to have existed palatalization (i.e. , ) among nearly all of the consonant sounds except for , and possibly for and . Whether or not the palatalization was phonemic remains unclear.

Apart from the palatalizations Proto-Baltic consonants were almost completely preserved. The only changes postulated are turning Proto-Baltic into Prussian and subsequently changing Proto-Baltic into .

===Vowels===
The following description is based on the phonological analysis by Schmalstieg:
* could also have been realized as 
* is not universally accepted, p.e. by Levin (1975)

====Diphthongs====
Schmalstieg proposes three native diphthongs:

* may have also been realized as a mid-back diphthong after palatalized consonants.
* occurs in the word , which is thought to be a loanword.

==Grammar==
With other remains being merely word lists, the grammar of Old Prussian is reconstructed chiefly on the basis of the three Catechisms.

===Nouns===

====Gender====
Old Prussian preserved the Proto-Baltic neuter. Therefore, it had three genders (masculine, feminine, neuter).

====Number====
Most scholars agree that there are two numbers, singular and plural, in Old Prussian, while some consider remnants of a dual identifiable in the existent corpus.

====Cases====
There is no consensus on the number of cases that Old Prussian had, and at least four can be determined with certainty: nominative, genitive, accusative and dative, with different suffixes. Most scholars agree, that there are traces of a vocative case, such as in the phrase &#x27; &#x27;O God the Lord&#x27;, reflecting the inherited PIE vocative ending *&#x27;, differing from nominative forms in o-stem nouns only.

Some scholars find instrumental forms, while the traditional view is that no instrumental case existed in Old Prussian. There could be some locative forms, e.g. (&#x27;in the evening&#x27;).

====Noun stems====
Declensional classes were &quot;a&quot;-stems (also called &quot;o&quot;-stems), &quot;(i)ja&quot;-stems (also called &quot;(i)jo&quot;-stems), &quot;ā&quot;-stems (feminine), &quot;ē&quot;-stems (feminine), &quot;i&quot;-stems, &quot;u&quot;-stems, and consonant-stems. Some also list &quot;ī&quot;/&quot;jā&quot;-stems as a separate stem, while others include &quot;jā&quot;-stems into &quot;ā&quot;-stems and do not mention &quot;ī&quot;-stems at all.

===Adjectives===
There were three adjective stems (&quot;a&quot;-stems, &quot;i&quot;-stems, &quot;u&quot;-stems), of which only the first agreed with the noun in gender.

There was a comparative and a superlative form.

===Verbal morphology===
When it comes to verbal morphology present, future and past tense are attested, as well as optative forms (used with imperative or permissive forms of verbs), infinitive, and four participles (active/passive present/past).

==Orthography==
The orthography varies depending on the author.
As the authors of many sources were themselves not proficient in Old Prussian, they wrote the words as they heard them using the orthographical conventions of their mother tongue. 
For example, the use of for both and is based on German orthography.
Additionally, the writers misunderstood some phonemes and, when copying manuscripts, they added further mistakes.

==Corpus of Old Prussian==
===Onomastics===
There was Prussian toponomy and hydronomy within the territory of (Baltic) Prussia. Georg Gerullis undertook the first basic study of these names in &quot;&quot; (&#x27;The Old Prussian Place-names&#x27;), written and published with the help of Walter de Gruyter, in 1922.

Another source are personal names.

===Evidence from other languages===
Further sources for Prussian words are Vernacularisms in the German dialects of East and West Prussia, as well as words of Old Curonian origin in Latvian and West-Baltic vernacularisms in Lithuanian and Belarusian.

===Vocabularies===
Two Prussian vocabularies are known. The older one by Simon Grunau (Simon Grunovius), a historian of the Teutonic Knights, encompasses 100 words (in strongly varying versions). He also recorded an expression: (&#x27;This (is) our lord, our lord&#x27;). The vocabulary is part of the &quot; written .

The second one is the so-called Elbing Vocabulary, which consists of 802 thematically sorted words and their German equivalents. Peter Holcwesscher from Marienburg copied the manuscript around 1400; the original dates from the beginning of the 14th or the end of the 13th century. It was found in 1825 by Fr Neumann among other manuscripts acquired by him from the heritage of the Elbing merchant A. Grübnau; it was thus dubbed the &quot;.

===Fragmentary texts===
There are separate words found in various historical documents.

The following fragments are commonly thought of as Prussian, but are probably actually Lithuanian (at least the adage, however, has been argued to be genuinely West Baltic, only an otherwise unattested dialect):
# An adage of 1583, &#x27;: the form &#x27; in the second instance corresponds to Lithuanian future tense &quot; (&#x27;will give&#x27;)
# &quot; (&#x27;Strike! Strike!&#x27;)

====Fragmentary Lord&#x27;s Prayer====
Additionally, there is one manuscript fragment of the first words of the in Prussian, from the beginning of the 15th century:

====Maletius&#x27; Sudovian Book====
Vytautas Mažiulis lists another few fragmentary texts recorded in several versions by Hieronymus Maletius in the Sudovian Book in the middle of the 16th century. Palmaitis regards them as Sudovian proper.
#&quot; (&#x27;Run, run, devils!&#x27;)
#&quot; (&#x27;Hello our friend!&#x27;)
#&#x27; – a drinking toast, reconstructed as &#x27; (&#x27;A cheer for a cheer, a tit for tat&#x27;, literally: &#x27;A healthy one after a healthy one, one after another!&#x27;)
#&quot; (&#x27;A carter drives here, a carter drives here!&#x27;)
#&#x27; – also recorded as &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27; (&#x27;Oh my dear holy fire!&#x27;)

===Complete texts===
In addition to the texts listed beneath, there are several colophons written by Prussian scriptors who worked in Prague and in the court of Lithuanian duke Butautas Kęstutaitis.

====Basel Epigram====
The so-called Basel Epigram is the oldest written Prussian sentence (1369). It reads: 
This jocular inscription was most probably made by a Prussian student studying in Prague (Charles University); found by Stephen McCluskey (1974) in manuscript MS F.V.2 (book of physics &quot;&quot; by Nicholas Oresme), fol. 63r, stored in the Basel University library.

====Catechisms====
The longest texts preserved in Old Prussian are three Catechisms printed in in 1545, 1545, and 1561 respectively. The first two consist of only six pages of text in Old Prussian – the second one being a correction of the first. The third catechism, or &quot;Enchiridion&quot;, consists of 132 pages of text, and is a translation of Luther&#x27;s Small Catechism by a German cleric called Abel Will, with his Prussian assistant Paul Megott. Will himself knew little or no Old Prussian, and his Prussian interpreter was probably illiterate, but according to Will spoke Old Prussian quite well. The text itself is mainly a word-for-word translation, and Will phonetically recorded Megott&#x27;s oral translation. Because of this, the &quot;Enchiridion&quot; exhibits many irregularities, such as the lack of case agreement in phrases involving an article and a noun, which followed word-for-word German originals as opposed to native Old Prussian syntax.

====Trace of Crete====
The &quot;Trace of Crete&quot; is a short poem added by a Baltic writer in Chania to a manuscript of the &quot; Logica Parva&quot; by Paul of Venice.

<text>OSGi is an open specification and open source project under the Eclipse Foundation.

It is a continuation of the work done by the OSGi Alliance (formerly known as the Open Services Gateway initiative), which was an open standards organization for software founded in March 1999. The foundation originally specified and maintained the OSGi standard. The alliance transferred its work to the Eclipse Foundation at the end of 2020.

The OSGi specification describes a modular system and a service platform for the Java programming language that implements a complete and dynamic component model, something that does not exist in standalone Java or VM environments. It has a service-oriented architecture based on micro services each implemented as an extended Java class file archive (JAR (file format)).

==Description==

OSGi is built around a service-oriented architecture. Applications or components, come in the form of bundles for deployment, can be remotely installed, started, stopped, updated, and uninstalled without requiring a reboot. Management of Java packages/classes is specified in great detail. Application life cycle management is implemented via APIs that enable remote downloading of management policies. The service registry enables bundles to detect the addition of new services or the removal of services, and adapt accordingly.

The OSGi specifications have evolved beyond the original focus of service gateways, and are now used in applications ranging from mobile phones to the open-source Eclipse IDE. Other application areas include automobiles, industrial automation, building automation, PDAs, grid computing, entertainment, fleet management and application servers.

In October 2020, the OSGi Alliance announced the transition of the standardization effort to the Eclipse Foundation, subsequent to which it would shut down. All artifacts have been transferred to the Eclipse Foundation, where an “OSGi Working Group&quot; continues to maintain and evolve the specification.

== Specification process ==
The OSGi specification is developed by the members in an open process and made available to the public free of charge under the OSGi Specification License. The OSGi Alliance has a compliance program that is open to members only. As of November 2010, there are seven certified OSGi framework implementations. A separate page lists both certified and non-certified OSGi Specification Implementations, which include OSGi frameworks and other OSGi specifications.

== Architecture ==

OSGi is a Java framework for developing and deploying modular software programs and libraries. Each bundle is a tightly coupled, dynamically loadable collection of classes, jars, and configuration files that explicitly declare their external dependencies (if any).

The framework is conceptually divided into the following areas:
;Bundles:Bundles are normal JAR components with extra manifest headers.
;Services:The services layer connects bundles in a dynamic way by offering a publish-find-bind model for plain old Java interfaces (POJIs) or plain old Java objects (POJOs).
;Services Registry:The application programming interface for management services.
;Life-Cycle:The application programming interface for life cycle management (install, start, stop, update, and uninstall) for bundles.
;Modules:The layer that defines encapsulation and declaration of dependencies (how a bundle can import and export code).
;Security:The layer that handles the security aspects by limiting bundle functionality to pre-defined capabilities.
;Execution Environment:Defines what methods and classes are available in a specific platform. There is no fixed list of execution environments, since it is subject to change as the Java Community Process creates new versions and editions of Java. However, the following set is currently supported by most OSGi implementations:
:*CDC-1.0/Foundation-1.0
:*CDC-1.1/Foundation-1.1
:*OSGi/Minimum-1.0
:*OSGi/Minimum-1.1
:*JRE-1.1
:*From J2SE-1.2 up to J2SE-1.6

==Bundles==
A bundle is a group of Java classes and additional resources equipped with a detailed manifest codice_1 file on all its contents, as well as additional services needed to give the included group of Java classes more sophisticated behaviors, to the extent of deeming the entire aggregate a component.

Below is an example of a typical codice_1 file with OSGi Headers:

 Bundle-Name: Hello World
 Bundle-SymbolicName: org.wikipedia.helloworld
 Bundle-Description: A Hello World bundle
 Bundle-ManifestVersion: 2
 Bundle-Version: 1.0.0
 Bundle-Activator: org.wikipedia.Activator
 Export-Package: org.wikipedia.helloworld;version=&quot;1.0.0&quot;
 Import-Package: org.osgi.framework;version=&quot;1.3.0&quot;

The meaning of the contents in the example is as follows:

# Bundle-Name: Defines a human-readable name for this bundle, Simply assigns a short name to the bundle.
# Bundle-SymbolicName: The only required header, this entry specifies a unique identifier for a bundle, based on the reverse domain name convention (used also by the java packages).
# Bundle-Description: A description of the bundle&#x27;s functionality.
# Bundle-ManifestVersion: Indicates the OSGi specification to use for reading this bundle.
# Bundle-Version: Designates a version number to the bundle.
# Bundle-Activator: Indicates the class name to be invoked once a bundle is activated.
# Export-Package: Expresses which Java packages contained in a bundle will be made available to the outside world.
# Import-Package: Indicates which Java packages will be required from the outside world to fulfill the dependencies needed in a bundle.

== Life-cycle ==
A Life Cycle layer adds bundles that can be dynamically installed, started, stopped, updated and uninstalled. Bundles rely on the module layer for class loading but add an API to manage the modules in run time. The life cycle layer introduces dynamics that are normally not part of an application. Extensive dependency mechanisms are used to assure the correct operation of the environment. Life cycle operations are fully protected with the security architecture.
Below is an example of a typical Java class implementing the codice_3 interface:

package org.wikipedia;

import org.osgi.framework.BundleActivator;
import org.osgi.framework.BundleContext;

public class Activator implements BundleActivator {
 private BundleContext context;

 @Override
 public void start(BundleContext context) throws Exception {
 System.out.println(&quot;Starting: Hello World&quot;);
 this.context = context;

 @Override
 public void stop(BundleContext context) throws Exception {
 System.out.println(&quot;Stopping: Goodbye Cruel World&quot;);
 this.context = null;
}
==Services==
===Standard services===
The OSGi Alliance has specified many services. Services are specified by a Java interface. Bundles can implement this interface and register the service with the Service Registry. Clients of the service can find it in the registry, or react to it when it appears or disappears.

The table below shows a description of OSGi System Services:

== Organization ==
The OSGi Alliance was founded by Ericsson, IBM, Motorola, Sun Microsystems and others in March 1999. Before incorporating as a nonprofit corporation, it was called the Connected Alliance.

Among its members are () more than 35 companies from quite different business areas, for example Adobe Systems, Deutsche Telekom, Hitachi, IBM, Liferay, Makewave, NEC, NTT, Oracle, Orange SA, ProSyst, Salesforce, Siemens, Software AG and TIBCO Software.

The Alliance has a board of directors that provides the organization&#x27;s overall governance. OSGi officers have various roles and responsibilities in supporting the alliance. Technical work is conducted within Expert Groups (EGs) chartered by the board of directors, and non-technical work is conducted in various working groups and committees. The technical work conducted within Expert Groups include developing specifications, reference implementations, and compliance tests. These Expert Groups have produced five major releases of the OSGi specifications ().

Dedicated Expert Groups exist for the enterprise, mobile, vehicle and the core platform areas.

The Enterprise Expert Group (EEG) is the newest EG and is addressing Enterprise / Server-side applications.
In November 2007 the Residential Expert Group (REG) started to work on specifications to remotely manage residential/home-gateways.
In October 2003, Nokia, Motorola, IBM, ProSyst and other OSGi members formed a Mobile Expert Group (MEG) that will specify a MIDP-based service platform for the next generation of smart mobile phones, addressing some of the needs that CLDC cannot manage other than CDC. MEG became part of OSGi as with R4.

<text>Estrogen (also spelled oestrogen in British English; see spelling differences) is a category of sex hormone responsible for the development and regulation of the female reproductive system and secondary sex characteristics. There are three major endogenous estrogens that have estrogenic hormonal activity: estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), and estriol (E3). Estradiol, an estrane, is the most potent and prevalent. Another estrogen called estetrol (E4) is produced only during pregnancy.

Estrogens are synthesized in all vertebrates and some insects. Quantitatively, estrogens circulate at lower levels than androgens in both men and women. While estrogen levels are significantly lower in males than in females, estrogens nevertheless have important physiological roles in males.

Like all steroid hormones, estrogens readily diffuse across the cell membrane. Once inside the cell, they bind to and activate estrogen receptors (ERs) which in turn modulate the expression of many genes. Additionally, estrogens bind to and activate rapid-signaling membrane estrogen receptors (mERs), such as GPER (GPR30).

In addition to their role as natural hormones, estrogens are used as medications, for instance in menopausal hormone therapy, hormonal birth control and feminizing hormone therapy for transgender women, intersex people, and nonbinary people.

Synthetic and natural estrogens have been found in the environment and are referred to as xenoestrogens. Estrogens are among the wide range of endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) and can cause health issues and reproductive disfunction in both wildlife and humans.

==Types and examples==

The four major naturally occurring estrogens in women are estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), estriol (E3), and estetrol (E4). Estradiol (E2) is the predominant estrogen during reproductive years both in terms of absolute serum levels as well as in terms of estrogenic activity. During menopause, estrone is the predominant circulating estrogen and during pregnancy estriol is the predominant circulating estrogen in terms of serum levels. Given by subcutaneous injection in mice, estradiol is about 10-fold more potent than estrone and about 100-fold more potent than estriol. Thus, estradiol is the most important estrogen in non-pregnant females who are between the menarche and menopause stages of life. However, during pregnancy this role shifts to estriol, and in postmenopausal women estrone becomes the primary form of estrogen in the body. Another type of estrogen called estetrol (E4) is produced only during pregnancy. All of the different forms of estrogen are synthesized from androgens, specifically testosterone and androstenedione, by the enzyme aromatase.

Minor endogenous estrogens, the biosyntheses of which do not involve aromatase, include 27-hydroxycholesterol, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), 7-oxo-DHEA, 7α-hydroxy-DHEA, 16α-hydroxy-DHEA, 7β-hydroxyepiandrosterone, androstenedione (A4), androstenediol (A5), 3α-androstanediol, and 3β-androstanediol. Some estrogen metabolites, such as the catechol estrogens 2-hydroxyestradiol, 2-hydroxyestrone, 4-hydroxyestradiol, and 4-hydroxyestrone, as well as 16α-hydroxyestrone, are also estrogens with varying degrees of activity. The biological importance of these minor estrogens is not entirely clear.

==Biological function==
The actions of estrogen are mediated by the estrogen receptor (ER), a dimeric nuclear protein that binds to DNA and controls gene expression. Like other steroid hormones, estrogen enters passively into the cell where it binds to and activates the estrogen receptor. The estrogen:ER complex binds to specific DNA sequences called a hormone response element to activate the transcription of target genes (in a study using an estrogen-dependent breast cancer cell line as model, 89 such genes were identified). Since estrogen enters all cells, its actions are dependent on the presence of the ER in the cell. The ER is expressed in specific tissues including the ovary, uterus and breast. The metabolic effects of estrogen in postmenopausal women have been linked to the genetic polymorphism of the ER.

While estrogens are present in both men and women, they are usually present at significantly higher levels in women of reproductive age. They promote the development of female secondary sexual characteristics, such as breasts, darkening and enlargement of nipples, and thickening of the endometrium and other aspects of regulating the menstrual cycle. In males, estrogen regulates certain functions of the reproductive system important to the maturation of sperm&lt;ref name=&quot;titleScience News Online (12/6/97): Estrogens Emerging Manly Alter Ego&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and may be necessary for a healthy libido.



===Overview of actions===

* Musculoskeletal
** Anabolic: Increases muscle mass and strength, speed of muscle regeneration, and bone density, increased sensitivity to exercise, protection against muscle damage, stronger collagen synthesis, increases the collagen content of connective tissues, tendons, and ligaments, but also decreases stiffness of tendons and ligaments (especially during menstruation). Decreased stiffness of tendons gives women much lower predisposition to muscle strains but soft ligaments are much more prone to injuries (ACL tears are 2-8x more common among women than men).
** Reduce bone resorption, increase bone formation
** In mice, estrogen has been shown to increase the proportion of the fastest-twitch (type IIX) muscle fibers by over 40%.
* Metabolic
** Anti-inflammatory properties
** Accelerate metabolism
** Gynoid fat distribution: increased fat storage or estrogenic fat in some body parts such as breasts, buttocks, and legs but decreased abdominal and visceral fat (androgenic obesity).
** Estradiol also regulates energy expenditure, body weight homeostasis, and seems to have much stronger anti-obesity effects than testosterone in general.
* Other structural
** Maintenance of vessels and skin
* Protein synthesis
** Increase hepatic production of binding proteins
** Increase production of the hepatokine adropin.
* Coagulation
** Increase circulating level of factors 2, 7, 9, 10, plasminogen
** Decrease antithrombin III
** Increase platelet adhesiveness
** Increase vWF (estrogen -&gt; Angiotensin II -&gt; Vasopressin)
** Increase PAI-1 and PAI-2 also through Angiotensin II
* Lipid
** Increase HDL, triglyceride
** Decrease LDL, fat deposition
* Fluid balance
** Salt (sodium) and water retention, including facial swelling and edema
** Estrogen is associated with edema, including facial and abdominal swelling.
* Melanin
** Estrogen is known to cause darkening of skin, especially in the face and areolae. Pale skinned women will develop browner and yellower skin during pregnancy, as a result of the increase of estrogen, known as the &quot;mask of pregnancy&quot;. Estrogen may explain why women have darker eyes than men, and also a lower risk of skin cancer than men; a European study found that women generally have darker skin than men.
* Lung function
** Promotes lung function by supporting alveoli (in rodents but probably in humans).
* Sexual
** Mediate formation of female secondary sex characteristics
** Stimulate endometrial growth
** Increase uterine growth
** Increase vaginal lubrication
** Thicken the vaginal wall
* Uterus lining
** Estrogen together with progesterone promotes and maintains the uterus lining in preparation for implantation of fertilized egg and maintenance of uterus function during gestation period, also upregulates oxytocin receptor in myometrium
* Ovulation
** Surge in estrogen level induces the release of luteinizing hormone, which then triggers ovulation by releasing the egg from the Graafian follicle in the ovary.
* Sexual behavior
** Estrogen is required for female mammals to engage in lordosis behavior during estrus (when animals are &quot;in heat&quot;). This behavior is required for sexual receptivity in these mammals and is regulated by the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus.
** Sex drive is dependent on androgen levels only in the presence of estrogen, but without estrogen, free testosterone level actually decreases sexual desire (instead of increasing sex drive), as demonstrated for those women who have hypoactive sexual desire disorder, and the sexual desire in these women can be restored by administration of estrogen (using oral contraceptive).

===Female pubertal development===
Estrogens are responsible for the development of female secondary sexual characteristics during puberty, including breast development, widening of the hips, and female fat distribution. Conversely, androgens are responsible for pubic and body hair growth, as well as acne and axillary odor.

====Breast development====
Estrogen, in conjunction with growth hormone (GH) and its secretory product insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), is critical in mediating breast development during puberty, as well as breast maturation during pregnancy in preparation of lactation and breastfeeding. Estrogen is primarily and directly responsible for inducing the ductal component of breast development, as well as for causing fat deposition and connective tissue growth. It is also indirectly involved in the lobuloalveolar component, by increasing progesterone receptor expression in the breasts and by inducing the secretion of prolactin. Allowed for by estrogen, progesterone and prolactin work together to complete lobuloalveolar development during pregnancy.

Androgens such as testosterone powerfully oppose estrogen action in the breasts, such as by reducing estrogen receptor expression in them.

===Female reproductive system===
Estrogens are responsible for maturation and maintenance of the vagina and uterus, and are also involved in ovarian function, such as maturation of ovarian follicles. In addition, estrogens play an important role in regulation of gonadotropin secretion. For these reasons, estrogens are required for female fertility.

===Neuroprotection and DNA repair===

Estrogen regulated DNA repair mechanisms in the brain have neuroprotective effects. Estrogen regulates the transcription of DNA base excision repair genes as well as the translocation of the base excision repair enzymes between different subcellular compartments.

===Brain and behavior===

====Sex drive====
Estrogens are involved in libido (sex drive) in both women and men.

====Cognition====
Verbal memory scores are frequently used as one measure of higher level cognition. These scores vary in direct proportion to estrogen levels throughout the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and menopause. Furthermore, estrogens when administered shortly after natural or surgical menopause prevents decreases in verbal memory. In contrast, estrogens have little effect on verbal memory if first administered years after menopause. Estrogens also have positive influences on other measures of cognitive function. However the effect of estrogens on cognition is not uniformly favorable and is dependent on the timing of the dose and the type of cognitive skill being measured.

The protective effects of estrogens on cognition may be mediated by estrogen&#x27;s anti-inflammatory effects in the brain. Studies have also shown that the Met allele gene and level of estrogen mediates the efficiency of prefrontal cortex dependent working memory tasks. Researchers have urged for further research to illuminate the role of estrogen and its potential for improvement on cognitive function.

====Mental health====
Estrogen is considered to play a significant role in women&#x27;s mental health. Sudden estrogen withdrawal, fluctuating estrogen, and periods of sustained low estrogen levels correlate with a significant lowering of mood. Clinical recovery from postpartum, perimenopause, and postmenopause depression has been shown to be effective after levels of estrogen were stabilized and/or restored. Menstrual exacerbation (including menstrual psychosis) is typically triggered by low estrogen levels, and is often mistaken for premenstrual dysphoric disorder.

Compulsions in male lab mice, such as those in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), may be caused by low estrogen levels. When estrogen levels were raised through the increased activity of the enzyme aromatase in male lab mice, OCD rituals were dramatically decreased. Hypothalamic protein levels in the gene COMT are enhanced by increasing estrogen levels which are believed to return mice that displayed OCD rituals to normal activity. Aromatase deficiency is ultimately suspected which is involved in the synthesis of estrogen in humans and has therapeutic implications in humans having obsessive-compulsive disorder.

Local application of estrogen in the rat hippocampus has been shown to inhibit the re-uptake of serotonin. Contrarily, local application of estrogen has been shown to block the ability of fluvoxamine to slow serotonin clearance, suggesting that the same pathways which are involved in SSRI efficacy may also be affected by components of local estrogen signaling pathways.

====Parenthood====
Studies have also found that fathers had lower levels of cortisol and testosterone but higher levels of estrogen (estradiol) than did non-fathers.

====Binge eating====
Estrogen may play a role in suppressing binge eating. Hormone replacement therapy using estrogen may be a possible treatment for binge eating behaviors in females. Estrogen replacement has been shown to suppress binge eating behaviors in female mice. The mechanism by which estrogen replacement inhibits binge-like eating involves the replacement of serotonin (5-HT) neurons. Women exhibiting binge eating behaviors are found to have increased brain uptake of neuron 5-HT, and therefore less of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the cerebrospinal fluid. Estrogen works to activate 5-HT neurons, leading to suppression of binge like eating behaviors.

It is also suggested that there is an interaction between hormone levels and eating at different points in the female menstrual cycle. Research has predicted increased emotional eating during hormonal flux, which is characterized by high progesterone and estradiol levels that occur during the mid-luteal phase. It is hypothesized that these changes occur due to brain changes across the menstrual cycle that are likely a genomic effect of hormones. These effects produce menstrual cycle changes, which result in hormone release leading to behavioral changes, notably binge and emotional eating. These occur especially prominently among women who are genetically vulnerable to binge eating phenotypes.

Binge eating is associated with decreased estradiol and increased progesterone. Klump et al. Progesterone may moderate the effects of low estradiol (such as during dysregulated eating behavior), but that this may only be true in women who have had clinically diagnosed binge episodes (BEs). Dysregulated eating is more strongly associated with such ovarian hormones in women with BEs than in women without BEs.

The implantation of 17β-estradiol pellets in ovariectomized mice significantly reduced binge eating behaviors and injections of GLP-1 in ovariectomized mice decreased binge-eating behaviors.

The associations between binge eating, menstrual-cycle phase and ovarian hormones correlated.

====Masculinization in rodents====
In rodents, estrogens (which are locally aromatized from androgens in the brain) play an important role in psychosexual differentiation, for example, by masculinizing territorial behavior; the same is not true in humans. In humans, the masculinizing effects of prenatal androgens on behavior (and other tissues, with the possible exception of effects on bone) appear to act exclusively through the androgen receptor. Consequently, the utility of rodent models for studying human psychosexual differentiation has been questioned.

===Skeletal system===
Estrogens are responsible for both the pubertal growth spurt, which causes an acceleration in linear growth, and epiphyseal closure, which limits height and limb length, in both females and males. In addition, estrogens are responsible for bone maturation and maintenance of bone mineral density throughout life. Due to hypoestrogenism, the risk of osteoporosis increases during menopause.

===Cardiovascular system===
Women are less impacted by heart disease due to vasculo-protective action of estrogen which helps in preventing atherosclerosis. It also helps in maintaining the delicate balance between fighting infections and protecting arteries from damage thus lowering the risk of cardiovascular disease. During pregnancy, high levels of estrogens increase coagulation and the risk of venous thromboembolism. Estrogen has been shown to upregulate the peptide hormone adropin.

===Immune system===
The effect of estrogen on the immune system is in general described as Th2 favoring, rather than suppressive, as is the case of the effect of male sex hormone - testosterone. Indeed, women respond better to vaccines, infections and are generally less likely to develop cancer, the tradeoff of this is that they are more likely to develop an autoimmune disease. The Th2 shift manifests itself in a decrease of cellular immunity and increase in humoral immunity (antibody production) shifts it from cellular to humoral by downregulating cell-mediated immunity and enhancing Th2 immune response by stimulating IL-4 production and Th2 differentiation. Type 1 and type 17 immune responses are downregulated, likely to be at least partially due to IL-4, which inhibits Th1. Effect of estrogen on different immune cells&#x27; cell types is in line with its Th2 bias. Activity of basophils, eosinophils, M2 macrophages and is enhanced, whereas activity of NK cells is downregulated. Conventional dendritic cells are biased towards Th2 under the influence of estrogen, whereas plasmacytoid dendritic cells, key players in antiviral defence, have increased IFN-g secretion. Estrogen also influences B cells by increasing their survival, proliferation, differentiation and function, which corresponds with higher antibody and B cell count generally detected in women.

On a molecular level estrogen induces the above-mentioned effects on cell via acting on intracellular receptors termed ER α and ER β, which upon ligation form either homo or heterodimers. The genetic and nongenetic targets of the receptors differ between homo and heterodimers. Ligation of these receptors allows them to translocate to the nucleus and act as transcription factors either by binding estrogen response elements (ERE) on DNA or binding DNA together with other transcriptional factors e.g. Nf-kB or AP-1, both of which result in RNA polymerase recruitment and further chromatin remodelation. A non-transcriptional response to oestrogen stimulation was also documented (termed membrane-initiated steroid signalling, MISS). This pathway stimulates the ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways, which are known to increase cellular proliferation and affect chromatin remodelation.

===Associated conditions===
Researchers have implicated estrogens in various estrogen-dependent conditions, such as ER-positive breast cancer, as well as a number of genetic conditions involving estrogen signaling or metabolism, such as estrogen insensitivity syndrome, aromatase deficiency, and aromatase excess syndrome.

High estrogen can amplify stress-hormone responses in stressful situations.

==Biochemistry==
===Biosynthesis===

Estrogens, in females, are produced primarily by the ovaries, and during pregnancy, the placenta. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulates the ovarian production of estrogens by the granulosa cells of the ovarian follicles and corpora lutea. Some estrogens are also produced in smaller amounts by other tissues such as the liver, pancreas, bone, adrenal glands, skin, brain, adipose tissue, and the breasts. These secondary sources of estrogens are especially important in postmenopausal women.
The pathway of estrogen biosynthesis in extragonadal tissues is different. These tissues are not able to synthesize C19 steroids, and therefore depend on C19 supplies from other tissues and the level of aromatase.

In females, synthesis of estrogens starts in theca interna cells in the ovary, by the synthesis of androstenedione from cholesterol. Androstenedione is a substance of weak androgenic activity which serves predominantly as a precursor for more potent androgens such as testosterone as well as estrogen. This compound crosses the basal membrane into the surrounding granulosa cells, where it is converted either immediately into estrone, or into testosterone and then estradiol in an additional step. The conversion of androstenedione to testosterone is catalyzed by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD), whereas the conversion of androstenedione and testosterone into estrone and estradiol, respectively is catalyzed by aromatase, enzymes which are both expressed in granulosa cells. In contrast, granulosa cells lack 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase, whereas theca cells express these enzymes and 17β-HSD but lack aromatase. Hence, both granulosa and theca cells are essential for the production of estrogen in the ovaries.

Estrogen levels vary through the menstrual cycle, with levels highest near the end of the follicular phase just before ovulation.

Note that in males, estrogen is also produced by the Sertoli cells when FSH binds to their FSH receptors.

===Distribution===
Estrogens are plasma protein bound to albumin and/or sex hormone-binding globulin in the circulation.

===Metabolism===
Estrogens are metabolized via hydroxylation by cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP1A1 and CYP3A4 and via conjugation by estrogen sulfotransferases (sulfation) and UDP-glucuronyltransferases (glucuronidation). In addition, estradiol is dehydrogenated by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase into the much less potent estrogen estrone. These reactions occur primarily in the liver, but also in other tissues.
===Excretion===
Estrogens are inactivated primarily by the kidneys and liver and excreted via the gastrointestinal tract in the form of conjugates, found in feces, bile, and urine.

==Medical use==
Estrogens are used as medications, mainly in hormonal contraception, hormone replacement therapy, and to treat gender dysphoria in transgender women and other transfeminine individuals as part of feminizing hormone therapy.

==Chemistry==
The estrogen steroid hormones are estrane steroids.

==History==
In 1929, Adolf Butenandt and Edward Adelbert Doisy independently isolated and purified estrone, the first estrogen to be discovered. Then, estriol and estradiol were discovered in 1930 and 1933, respectively. Shortly following their discovery, estrogens, both natural and synthetic, were introduced for medical use. Examples include estriol glucuronide (Emmenin, Progynon), estradiol benzoate, conjugated estrogens (Premarin), diethylstilbestrol, and ethinylestradiol.

The word estrogen derives from Ancient Greek. It is derived from &quot;oestros&quot; (a periodic state of sexual activity in female mammals), and genos (generating). It was first published in the early 1920s and referenced as &quot;oestrin&quot;. With the years, American English adapted the spelling of estrogen to fit with its phonetic pronunciation.

==Society and culture==

===Etymology===
The name &quot;estrogen&quot; is derived from the Greek (), literally meaning &quot;verve&quot; or &quot;inspiration&quot; but figuratively sexual passion or desire, and the suffix &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;producer of&quot;.

===Environment===
A range of synthetic and natural substances that possess estrogenic activity have been identified in the environment and are referred to xenoestrogens.
* Synthetic substances such as bisphenol A as well as metalloestrogens (e.g., cadmium).
* Plant products with estrogenic activity are called phytoestrogens (e.g., coumestrol, daidzein, genistein, miroestrol).
* Those produced by fungi are known as mycoestrogens (e.g., zearalenone).

Estrogens are among the wide range of endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) because they have high estrogenic potency. When an EDC makes its way into the environment, it may cause male reproductive dysfunction to wildlife and humans. The estrogen excreted from farm animals makes its way into fresh water systems. During the germination period of reproduction the fish are exposed to low levels of estrogen which may cause reproductive dysfunction to male fish.

===Cosmetics===
Some hair shampoos on the market include estrogens and placental extracts; others contain phytoestrogens. In 1998, there were case reports of four prepubescent African-American girls developing breasts after exposure to these shampoos. In 1993, the FDA determined that not all over-the-counter topically applied hormone-containing drug products for human use are generally recognized as safe and effective and are misbranded. An accompanying proposed rule deals with cosmetics, concluding that any use of natural estrogens in a cosmetic product makes the product an unapproved new drug and that any cosmetic using the term &quot;hormone&quot; in the text of its labeling or in its ingredient statement makes an implied drug claim, subjecting such a product to regulatory action.

In addition to being considered misbranded drugs, products claiming to contain placental extract may also be deemed to be misbranded cosmetics if the extract has been prepared from placentas from which the hormones and other biologically active substances have been removed and the extracted substance consists principally of protein. The FDA recommends that this substance be identified by a name other than &quot;placental extract&quot; and describing its composition more accurately because consumers associate the name &quot;placental extract&quot; with a therapeutic use of some biological activity.

<text>Roland Octapad is a range of MIDI electronic drum percussion controllers produced by the Roland Corporation.

==Roland Pad-8==

The first model, introduced in 1985, was the Pad-8. Originally to be called MPC-8 (MIDI Percussion Controller 8), but was renamed Pad-8 to avoid legal implications with MPC Electronics. It was an influential device at that time, allowing drummers and percussionists the opportunity to trigger virtually any MIDI sound source without the need of a full electronic drum set. 

=== Features ===
The Pad 8 Consists of eight individual pads (divided in two rows of four pads) and six external pad trigger ports. The controlled had no internal sound source and limited memory for four user patches. A unique initialization procedure, when powered on, would load a &quot;patch preset&quot; and configure the Pad-8 to work with either the Roland&#x27;s TR-909 or TR-707/TR-727. 

The Pad 8 could only transmit on a single MIDI channel (channel 10 on power up), however each of the 14 pads is assigned a different MIDI-Note number. Both MIDI channel and note numbers could be edited to suite the device being controlled over MIDI.

There is one parameter adjustable for each pad: MIDI Note. The remaining five parameters adjustable are global: MIDI Channel; Pad Sensitivity; Volume Curve; Minimum Velocity; and the Gate Time.

=== Notable Users/Endorsers ===

* Hard Corps
* Michael Shrieve/ David Beal
* Stephen Morris (New Order)
* John Molo (Bruce Hornsby &amp; The Range)
* Norman Hassas (UB40)
* Eric Clapton
* Phil Collins (Genesis, Mike &amp; Mechanics, Howard Jones, and Solo project)
* Danny Carey (Tool)

==Roland Pad-80==

The second model, introduced in 1989, was the Pad-80 Octapad II. Again the Pad-80 was an eight pad MIDI controller that allowed for various types of MIDI sound sources. Improvements in this second model included the ability to play up to three notes per pad, and velocity switching, which allowed the user to stack or alternate between the assigned notes depending on how hard the pads were struck. This feature became useful for creating more realistic sounding drum parts, and in addition allowed drummers to play melodic instruments with greater ease. These new features were groundbreaking at the time, and are still utilized in Roland&#x27;s electronic percussion today.

The memory was increased, allowing up to 64 different patches internally and another 64 patches to be stored on a Roland M-256E memory card. Further improvements to the MIDI specification included the control of modulation, pitch bend and aftertouch using a foot pedal, along with full System Exclusive (SysEx) capability. The Pad-80 had a patch chain function that allowed a series of 32 patches to be arranged in any sequence, eight of these chains could be stored in memory.

==Roland SPD-8 (1990), SPD-11 (1993), and SPD-20 (1998)==
After the Pad-80, Roland continued to release SPD-8 with on-board sounds, as a standalone instrument in 1990, SPD-11 in 1993, which not only had more sounds but also built-in effects processing, and SPD-20 in 1998, which had more on-board sounds. These SPD Series products apart from the SPD-20 and 20x had not been named &quot;Octapad&quot; on the product panel.

==Octapad SPD-30 (2010)==
Roland continued the line in 2010 with the Octapad SPD-30 which includes on-board sounds and effects. Version 2 was released as a firmware update in 2012.

== Octapad SPD-20x (2015) and SPD-20 Pro (2020) ==
Roland released the SPD-20x in 2015 and the SPD-20 Pro in 2020 with more on-board sounds and an additional external trigger socket.

<doc id="22588" wikidata="Q57112" url="?curid=22588" title="Oswald Spengler">
<text>Oswald Arnold Gottfried Spengler (29 May 1880 – 8 May 1936) was a German polymath whose areas of interest included history, philosophy, mathematics, science, and art, as well as their relation to his organic theory of history. He is best known for his two-volume work &quot;The Decline of the West&quot; (&quot;Der Untergang des Abendlandes&quot;), published in 1918 and 1922, covering human history. Spengler&#x27;s model of history postulates that human cultures and civilizations are akin to biological entities, each with a limited, predictable, and deterministic lifespan.

Spengler predicted that about the year 2000, Western civilization would enter the period of pre‑death emergency which would lead to 200 years of Caesarism (extra-constitutional omnipotence of the executive branch of government) before Western civilization&#x27;s final collapse.

Spengler is regarded as a German nationalist and a critic of republicanism, and he was a prominent member of the Weimar-era Conservative Revolution. While the Nazis had viewed his writings as a means to provide a &quot;respectable pedigree&quot; to their ideology, Spengler later criticized Nazism due to its excessive racialist elements. He saw Benito Mussolini, and entrepreneurial types, like the mining magnate Cecil Rhodes, as examples of the impending Caesars of Western culturelater showcasing his disappointment in Mussolini&#x27;s colonialist adventures.

==Biography==

=== Early life and family ===
Oswald Arnold Gottfried Spengler was born on 29 May 1880 in Blankenburg, Duchy of Brunswick, German Empire, the oldest surviving child of Bernhard Spengler (1844–1901) and Pauline Spengler (1840–1910), née Grantzow, the descendant of an artistic family. Oswald&#x27;s elder brother was born prematurely in 1879, when his mother tried to move a heavy laundry basket, and died at the age of three weeks. Oswald was born ten months after his brother&#x27;s death. His younger sisters were Adele (1881–1917), Gertrud (1882–1957), and Hildegard (1885–1942). Oswald&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Theodor Spengler (1806–1876), was a metallurgical inspector (&quot;Hütteninspektor&quot;) in Altenbrak.

Spengler&#x27;s maternal great-grandfather, Friedrich Wilhelm Grantzow, a tailor&#x27;s apprentice in Berlin, had three children out of wedlock with a Jewish woman named Bräunchen Moses ( 1769–1849) whom he later married, on 26 May 1799. Shortly before the wedding, Moses was baptized as Johanna Elisabeth Anspachin; the surname was chosen after her birthplace—Anspach. Her parents, Abraham and Reile Moses, were both deceased by then. The couple had another five children, one of whom was Spengler&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Gustav Adolf Grantzow (1811–1883)—a solo dancer and ballet master in Berlin, who in 1837 married Katharina Kirchner (1813–1873), a solo dancer from a Munich Catholic family; the second of their four daughters was Oswald Spengler&#x27;s mother Pauline Grantzow. Like the Grantzows in general, Pauline was of a Bohemian disposition, and, before marrying Bernhard Spengler, accompanied her dancer sisters on tours. In appearance, she was plump. Her temperament, which Oswald inherited, was moody, irritable, and morose.

=== Education ===
When Oswald was ten years of age, his family moved to the university city of Halle. Here he received a classical education at the local Gymnasium (academically oriented secondary school), studying Greek, Latin, mathematics and sciences. Here, too, he developed his propensity for the arts—especially poetry, drama, and music—and came under the influence of the ideas of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich Nietzsche. At 17, he wrote a drama titled &quot;Montezuma&quot;.

After his father&#x27;s death in 1901, Spengler attended several universities (Munich, Berlin, and Halle) as a private scholar, taking courses in a wide range of subjects. His studies were undirected. In 1903, he failed his doctoral thesis on Heraclitus—titled &quot;Der metaphysische Grundgedanke der heraklitischen Philosophie&quot; (&quot;The Fundamental Metaphysical Thought of the Heraclitean Philosophy&quot;) and conducted under the direction of Alois Riehl—because of insufficient references. He took the doctoral oral exam again and received his PhD from Halle on 6 April 1904. In December 1904, he began to write the secondary dissertation (&quot;Staatsexamensarbeit&quot;) necessary to qualify as a high school teacher. This became &quot;The Development of the Organ of Sight in the Higher Realms of the Animal Kingdom&quot; (&quot;Die Entwicklung des Sehorgans bei den Hauptstufen des Tierreiches&quot;), a text now lost. It was approved and he received his teaching certificate. In 1905, Spengler suffered a nervous breakdown.

=== Career ===
Spengler briefly served as a teacher in Saarbrücken then in Düsseldorf. From 1908 to 1911 he worked at a grammar school (&quot;Realgymnasium&quot;) in Hamburg, where he taught science, German history, and mathematics. Biographers report that his life as a teacher was uneventful.

In 1911, following his mother&#x27;s death, he moved to Munich, where he lived for the rest of his life. While there, he was a cloistered scholar, supported by his modest inheritance. Spengler survived on very limited means and was marked by loneliness. He owned no books, and took work as a tutor and wrote for magazines to earn additional income. Due to a severe heart problem, Spengler was exempted from military service. During the war, his inheritance was useless because it was invested overseas; thus, he lived in genuine poverty for this period.

He began work on the first volume of &quot;The Decline of the West&quot; intending to focus on Germany within Europe. However, the Agadir Crisis of 1911 affected him deeply, so he widened the scope of his study. According to Spengler the book was completed in 1914, but the first edition was published in the summer of 1918, shortly before the end of World War I. Spengler wrote about the years immediately prior to World War I in &quot;Decline&quot;:

When the first volume of &quot;The Decline of the West&quot; was published, it was a wild success. Spengler became an instant celebrity. The national humiliation of the Treaty of Versailles (1919), followed by economic depression in 1923 and hyperinflation, seemed to prove Spengler right. &quot;Decline&quot; comforted Germans because it could be used as a rationale for their diminished pre-eminence, i.e. due to larger world-historical processes. The book met with wide success outside of Germany as well, and by 1919 had been translated into several other languages.

The second volume of &quot;Decline&quot; was published in 1922. In it, Spengler argued that German socialism differed from Marxism; instead, he said it was more compatible with traditional German conservatism. Spengler declined an appointment as Professor of Philosophy at the University of Göttingen, saying he needed time to focus on writing.

The book was widely discussed, even by those who had not read it. Historians took umbrage at his unapologetically non-scientific approach. Novelist Thomas Mann compared reading Spengler&#x27;s book to reading Arthur Schopenhauer&#x27;s works for the first time. Academics gave it a mixed reception. Sociologist Max Weber described Spengler as a &quot;very ingenious and learned dilettante&quot;, while philosopher Karl Popper called the thesis &quot;pointless&quot;. The first volume of &quot;Decline&quot; was published in English by Alfred A. Knopf in 1926, the second in 1928.

===Aftermath===
In 1924, following the social-economic upheaval and hyperinflation, Spengler entered politics in an effort to bring Reichswehr General Hans von Seeckt to power as the country&#x27;s leader. The attempt failed and Spengler proved ineffective in practical politics.

A 1928 &quot;Time&quot; review of the second volume of &quot;Decline&quot; described the immense influence and controversy Spengler&#x27;s ideas enjoyed during the 1920s: &quot;When the first volume of &quot;The Decline of the West&quot; appeared in Germany a few years ago, thousands of copies were sold. Cultivated European discourse quickly became Spengler-saturated. Spenglerism spurted from the pens of countless disciples. It was imperative to read Spengler, to sympathize or revolt. It still remains so&quot;.

In 1931, he published &quot;Man and Technics&quot;, which warned against the dangers of technology and industrialism to culture. He especially pointed to the tendency of Western technology to spread to hostile &quot;Colored races&quot; which would then use the weapons against the West. It was poorly received because of its anti-industrialism. This book contains the well-known Spengler quote &quot;Optimism is cowardice&quot;.

Despite voting for Hitler over Hindenburg in 1932, Spengler found the Führer vulgar. He met Hitler in 1933 and after a lengthy discussion remained unimpressed, saying that Germany did not need a heroic tenor but a real hero &quot;. He quarreled publicly with Alfred Rosenberg, and his pessimism and remarks about the Führer resulted in isolation and public silence. He further rejected offers from Joseph Goebbels to give public speeches. However, Spengler did become a member of the German Academy that year.

&quot;The Hour of Decision&quot;, published in 1934, was a bestseller, but was later banned for its critique of National Socialism. Spengler&#x27;s criticisms of liberalism were welcomed by the Nazis, but Spengler disagreed with their biological ideology and anti-Semitism. While racial mysticism played a key role in his own worldview, Spengler had always been an outspoken critic of the racial theories professed by the Nazis and many others in his time, and was not inclined to change his views during and after Hitler&#x27;s rise to power. Although a German nationalist, Spengler viewed the Nazis as too narrowly German, and not occidental enough to lead the fight against other peoples. The book also warned of a coming world war in which Western Civilization risked being destroyed, and was widely distributed abroad before eventually being banned by the National Socialist German Workers Party in Germany. A &quot;Time&quot; review of &quot;The Hour of Decision&quot; noted Spengler&#x27;s international popularity as a polemicist, observing that &quot;When Oswald Spengler speaks, many a Western Worldling stops to listen&quot;. The review recommended the book for &quot;readers who enjoy vigorous writing&quot;, who &quot;will be glad to be rubbed the wrong way by Spengler&#x27;s harsh aphorisms&quot; and his pessimistic predictions.

=== Later life and death ===

On 13 October 1933, Spengler became one of the hundred senators of the German Academy.

Spengler spent his final years in Munich, listening to Beethoven, reading Molière and Shakespeare, buying several thousand books, and collecting ancient Turkish, Persian and Indian weapons. He made occasional trips to the Harz mountains and to Italy.

Spengler died of a heart attack on 8 May 1936, in Munich, at age 55. He was buried in the Nordfriedhof in Munich.

==Views==

=== Influences ===
In the introduction to &quot;The Decline of the West&quot;, Spengler cites Johann W. von Goethe and Friedrich Nietzsche as his major influences. Goethe&#x27;s vitalism and Nietzsche&#x27;s cultural criticism, in particular, are highlighted in his works.

 Spengler was also influenced by the universal and cyclical vision of world history proposed by the German historian Eduard Meyer. The belief in the progression of civilizations through an evolutionary process comparable with living beings can be traced back to classical antiquity, although it is difficult to assess the extent of the influence those thinkers had on Spengler: Cato the Elder, Cicero, Seneca, Florus, Ammianus Marcellinus, and later, Francis Bacon, who compared different empires with each other with the help of biological analogies.

===&quot;The Decline of the West&quot; (1918)===

The concept of historical philosophy developed by Spengler is founded upon two assumptions: 
* the existence of social entities called &#x27;Cultures&#x27; (&quot;Kulturen&quot;) and regarded as the largest possible actors in human history, which itself had no metaphysical sense, 
* the parallelism between the evolution of those Cultures and the evolution of living beings.

Spengler enumerates nine Cultures: Ancient Egyptian, Babylonian, Indian, Chinese, Greco-Roman or &#x27;Apollonian&#x27;, &#x27;Magian&#x27; or &#x27;Arabic&#x27; (including early and Byzantine Christianity and Islam), Mexican, Western or &#x27;Faustian&#x27;, and Russian. They interacted with each other in time and space but were distinctive due to &#x27;internal&#x27; attributes. According to Spengler, &quot;Cultures are organisms, and world-history is their collective biography.&quot;

Spengler also compares the evolution of Cultures to the different ages of human life, &quot;Every Culture passes through the age-phases of the individual man. Each has its childhood, youth, manhood and old age.&quot; When a Culture enters its late stage, Spengler argues, it becomes a &#x27;Civilization&#x27; (&quot;Zivilisation&quot;), a petrified body characterized in the modern age by technology, imperialism, and mass society, which he expected to fossilize and decline from the 2000s onward. The first-millennium Near East was, in his view, not a transition between Classical Antiquity, Western Christianity, and Islam, but rather an emerging new Culture he named &#x27;Arabian&#x27; or &#x27;Magian&#x27;, explaining messianic Judaism, early Christianity, Gnosticism, Mandaeism, Zoroastrianism, and Islam as different expressions of a single Culture sharing a unique worldview.

The great historian of antiquity Eduard Meyer thought highly of Spengler, although he also had some criticisms of him. Spengler&#x27;s obscurity, intuitiveness, and mysticism were easy targets, especially for the positivists and neo-Kantians who rejected the possibility that there was meaning in world history. The critic and aesthete Count Harry Kessler thought him unoriginal and rather inane, especially in regard to his opinion on Nietzsche. Philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, however, shared Spengler&#x27;s cultural pessimism. Spengler&#x27;s work became an important foundation for social cycle theory.

===&quot;Prussianism and Socialism&quot; (1919)===
==== Nazism and Fascism ====
Spengler was an important influence on Nazi ideology. He &quot;provided skeletal Nazi ideas&quot; to the early Nazi movement &quot;and gave them a respectable pedigree&quot;. Key parts of his writings were incorporated into Nazi Party ideology.

Spengler&#x27;s criticism of the Nazi Party was taken seriously by Hitler, and Carl Deher credited him for inspiring Hitler to carry out the Night of the Long Knives in which Ernst Röhm and other leaders of the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA) were executed. In 1934, Spengler pronounced the funeral oration for one of the victims of the Night of the Long Knives and retired in 1935 from the board of the highly influential Nietzsche Archive which was viewed as opposition to the regime.

Spengler considered Judaism to be a &quot;disintegrating element&quot; (zersetzendes Element) that acts destructively &quot;wherever it intervenes&quot; (wo es auch eingreift). In his view, Jews are characterized by a &quot;cynical intelligence&quot; (zynische Intelligenz) and their &quot;money thinking&quot; (Gelddenken). Therefore, they were incapable of adapting to Western culture and represented a foreign body in Europe. He also clarifies in &quot;The Decline of the West&quot; that this is a pattern shared in all civilizations: He mentions how the ancient Jew would have seen the cynical, atheistic Romans of the late Roman empire the same way Westerners today see Jews. Alexander Bein argues that with these characterizations Spengler contributed significantly to the enforcement of Jewish stereotypes in pre-WW2 German circles.

Spengler viewed Nazi anti-Semitism as self-defeating, and personally took an ethnological view of race and culture. In his private papers, he remarked upon &quot;how much envy of the capability of other people in view of one&#x27;s lack of it lies hidden in anti-Semitism!&quot;, and arguing that &quot;when one would rather destroy business and scholarship than see Jews in them, one is an ideologue, i.e., a danger for the nation. Idiotic.&quot;

Spengler, however, regarded the transformation of ultra-capitalist mass democracies into dictatorial regimes as inevitable, and he had expressed acknowledgement for Benito Mussolini and the Italian Fascist movement as a first symptom of this development.

==Legacy==
Spengler influenced other academics, including historians Arnold J. Toynbee, Carroll Quigley, and Samuel P. Huntington. Others include fascist ideologues Francis Parker Yockey and Oswald Mosley. John Calvert notes that Oswald Spengler&#x27;s criticism of Western civilisation remains popular among Islamists.

<text>An oracle is a person or thing considered to provide insight, wise counsel or prophetic predictions, most notably including precognition of the future, inspired by deities. If done through occultic means, it is a form of divination.

== Description ==
The word &quot;oracle&quot; comes from the Latin verb &quot;ōrāre&quot;, &quot;to speak&quot; and properly refers to the priest or priestess uttering the prediction. In extended use, &quot;oracle&quot; may also refer to the &quot;site of the oracle&quot;, and the oracular utterances themselves, are called &quot;khrēsmoí&quot; (χρησμοί) in Greek.

Oracles were thought to be portals through which the gods spoke directly to people. In this sense, they were different from seers (&quot;manteis&quot;, μάντεις) who interpreted signs sent by the gods through bird signs, animal entrails, and other various methods.

The most important oracles of Greek antiquity were Pythia (priestess to Apollo at Delphi), and the oracle of Dione and Zeus at Dodona in Epirus. Other oracles of Apollo were located at Didyma and Mallus on the coast of Anatolia, at Corinth and Bassae in the Peloponnese, and at the islands of Delos and Aegina in the Aegean Sea.

The Sibylline Oracles are a collection of oracular utterances written in Greek hexameters, ascribed to the Sibyls, prophetesses who uttered divine revelations in frenzied states.

==Origins==
Walter Burkert observes that &quot;Frenzied women from whose lips the God speaks&quot; are recorded in the Near East as in Mari in the second millennium BC and in Assyria in the first millennium BC. In Egypt, the goddess Wadjet (eye of the moon) was depicted as a snake-headed woman or a woman with two snake-heads. Her oracle was in the renowned temple in Per-Wadjet (Greek name Buto). The oracle of Wadjet may have been the source for the oracular tradition which spread from Egypt to Greece. Evans linked Wadjet with the &quot;Minoan Snake Goddess&quot;.

At the oracle of Dodona, she is called Diōnē (the feminine form of &quot;Diós&quot;, genitive of &quot;Zeus&quot;; or of &quot;dīos&quot;, &quot;godly&quot;, literally &quot;heavenly&quot;), who represents the earth-fertile soil, probably the chief female goddess of the proto-Indo-European pantheon. Python, daughter (or son) of Gaia was the earth dragon of Delphi represented as a serpent and became the chthonic deity, enemy of Apollo, who slew her and possessed the oracle.

==In classical antiquity==
===Pythia at Delphi===
The Pythia was the mouthpiece of the oracles of the god Apollo, and was also known as the Oracle of Delphi.

The Delphic Oracle exerted considerable influence throughout Hellenic culture. Distinctively, this woman was essentially the highest authority both civilly and religiously in male-dominated ancient Greece. She responded to the questions of citizens, foreigners, kings, and philosophers on issues of political impact, war, duty, crime, family, laws—even personal issues. The semi-Hellenic countries around the Greek world, such as Lydia, Caria, and even Egypt also respected her and came to Delphi as supplicants.

Croesus, king of Lydia beginning in 560 BC, tested the oracles of the world to discover which gave the most accurate prophecies. He sent out emissaries to seven sites who were all to ask the oracles on the same day what the king was doing at that very moment. Croesus proclaimed the oracle at Delphi to be the most accurate, who correctly reported that the king was making a lamb-and-tortoise stew, and so he graced her with a magnitude of precious gifts. He then consulted Delphi before attacking Persia, and according to Herodotus was advised: &quot;If you cross the river, a great empire will be destroyed&quot;. Believing the response favourable, Croesus attacked, but it was his own empire that ultimately was destroyed by the Persians.

She allegedly also proclaimed that there was no man wiser than Socrates, to which Socrates said that, if so, this was because he alone was aware of his own ignorance. After this confrontation, Socrates dedicated his life to a search for knowledge that was one of the founding events of western philosophy. He claimed that she was &quot;an essential guide to personal and state development.&quot; This oracle&#x27;s last recorded response was given in 362 AD, to Julian the Apostate.

The oracle&#x27;s powers were highly sought after and never doubted. Any inconsistencies between prophecies and events were dismissed as failure to correctly interpret the responses, not an error of the oracle. Very often prophecies were worded ambiguously, so as to cover all contingencies – especially so &quot;ex post facto&quot;. One famous such response to a query about participation in a military campaign was &quot;You will go you will return never in war will you perish&quot;. This gives the recipient liberty to place a comma before or after the word &quot;never&quot;, thus covering both possible outcomes. Another was the response to the Athenians when the vast army of king Xerxes I was approaching Athens with the intent of razing the city to the ground. &quot;Only the wooden palisades may save you&quot;, answered the oracle, probably aware that there was sentiment for sailing to the safety of southern Italy and re-establishing Athens there. Some thought that it was a recommendation to fortify the Acropolis with a wooden fence and make a stand there. Others, Themistocles among them, said the oracle was clearly for fighting at sea, the metaphor intended to mean war ships. Others still insisted that their case was so hopeless that they should board every ship available and flee to Italy, where they would be safe beyond any doubt. In the event, variations of all three interpretations were attempted: some barricaded the Acropolis, the civilian population was evacuated over sea to nearby Salamis Island and to Troizen, and the war fleet fought victoriously at Salamis Bay. Should utter destruction have happened, it could always be claimed that the oracle had called for fleeing to Italy after all.

===Sibyl at Cumae===
Cumae was the first Greek colony on the mainland of Italy, near Naples, dating back to the 8th century BC. The &quot;sibylla&quot; or prophetess at Cumae became famous because of her proximity to Rome and the Sibylline Books acquired and consulted in emergencies by Rome wherein her prophecies were transcribed. The Cumaean Sibyl was called &quot;Herophile&quot; by Pausanias and Lactantius, &quot;Deiphobe, daughter of Glaucus&quot; by Virgil, as well as &quot;Amaltheia&quot;, &quot;Demophile&quot;, or &quot;Taraxandra&quot; by others. Sibyl&#x27;s prophecies became popular with Christians as they were thought to predict the birth of Jesus Christ.

===Oracle at Didyma=== 
Didyma near Ionia in Asia Minor in the domain of the famous city of Miletus.

===Oracle at Dodona===
Dodona in northwestern Greece was another oracle devoted to the Mother Goddess identified at other sites with Rhea or Gaia, but here called Dione. The shrine of Dodona, set in a grove of oak trees, was the oldest Hellenic oracle, according to the fifth-century historian Herodotus, and dated from pre-Hellenic times, perhaps as early as the second millennium BC, when the tradition may have spread from Egypt. By the time of Herodotus, Zeus had displaced the Mother Goddess, who had been assimilated to Aphrodite, and the worship of the deified hero Heracles had been added. Dodona became the second most important oracle in ancient Greece, after Delphi. At Dodona, Zeus was worshipped as Zeus Naios or Naos (god of springs Naiads, from a spring under the oaks), or as Zeus Bouleos (chancellor). Priestesses and priests interpreted the rustling of the leaves of the oak tree that stood on this spot as Zeus&#x27; sanctuary to determine the correct actions to be taken.

===Oracle at Abae=== 
The oracle of Abae was one of the most important oracles. It was almost completely destroyed by the Persians during the Second Persian invasion of Greece.
===Other oracles===
Erythrae near Ionia in Asia Minor was home to a prophetess.

Trophonius was an oracle at Lebadea of Boeotia devoted to the chthonian Zeus Trophonius. Trophonius was a Greek hero nursed by Europa.

Near the Menestheus&#x27;s port or &quot;Menesthei Portus&quot; (), modern El Puerto de Santa María, Spain, was the Oracle of Menestheus (), to whom also the inhabitants of Gades offered sacrifices.

At the Ikaros island in the Persian Gulf (modern Failaka Island in Kuwait), there was an oracle of Artemis Tauropolus.

At Claros, there was the oracle of Apollo Clarius.

At Ptoion, there was an oracle of Ptoios and later of Apollo.

At Gryneium, there was a sanctuary of Apollo with an ancient oracle.

At Livadeia, there was the oracle of Trophonius.

The oracle of Zeus Ammon at Siwa Oasis was so famous that Alexander the Great visited it when he conquered Egypt. 

There was also another oracle of Zeus Ammon at Aphytis in Chalkidiki.

The oracle of Zeus at Olympia.

In the city of Anariace (Ἀναριάκη) at the Caspian Sea, there was an oracle for sleepers. Persons should sleep in the temple in order to learn the divine will.

The oracle of Apollo at Eutresis and the oracle of Apollo at Tegyra.

Oracle of Aphrodite at Paphos.

There were many &quot;oracles of the dead&quot;, such as in Argolis, Cumae, Herakleia in Pontos, in the Temple of Poseidon in Taenaron, but the most important was the Necromanteion of Acheron.

==In other cultures==

The term &quot;oracle&quot; is also applied in modern English to parallel institutions of divination in other cultures. Specifically, it is used in the context of Christianity for the concept of divine revelation, and in the context of Judaism for the Urim and Thummim breastplate, and in general any utterance considered prophetic.

===Celtic polytheism===
In Celtic polytheism, divination was performed by the priestly caste, either the druids or the vates. This is reflected in the role of &quot;seers&quot; in Dark Age Wales (&quot;dryw&quot;) and Ireland (&quot;fáith&quot;).

===China===
In China, oracle bones were used for divination in the late Shang dynasty (c. 1600–1046 BC). Diviners applied heat to these bones, usually ox scapulae or tortoise plastrons, and interpreted the resulting cracks.

A different divining method, using the stalks of the yarrow plant, was practiced in the subsequent Zhou dynasty (1046–256 BC). Around the late 9th century BC, the divination system was recorded in the &quot;I Ching&quot;, or &quot;Book of Changes&quot;, a collection of linear signs used as oracles. In addition to its oracular power, the &quot;I Ching&quot; has had a major influence on the philosophy, literature and statecraft of China since the Zhou period.

=== Egypt ===

According to the Ancient Egyptian religion, some ancient Egyptian gods (and rarely deified humans), acted as intermediaries between humans and the divine. This was exemplified by the Ancient Egyptian title &quot;Reporter/Herald&quot; (&quot;wḥmw&quot;), whom in the religious context, reports requests and petitions to the local gods.

===Hawaii===
In Hawaii, oracles were found at certain &quot;heiau&quot;, Hawaiian temples. These oracles were found in towers covered in white &quot;kapa&quot; cloth made from plant fibres. In here, priests received the will of gods. These towers were called &quot; &#x27;Anu&#x27;u&quot;. An example of this can be found at Ahu&#x27;ena heiau in Kona.

===India and Nepal===
In ancient India, the oracle was known as &quot;ākāśavānī&quot; (&quot;voice/speech from the sky/aether&quot;) or &quot;aśarīravānī&quot; (&quot;a disembodied voice (or voice of the unseen)&quot;) (&quot;asariri&quot; in Tamil), and was related to the message of a god. Oracles played key roles in many of the major incidents of the epics Mahabharata and Ramayana. An example is that Kamsa (or Kansa), the evil uncle of Krishna, was informed by an oracle that the eighth son of his sister Devaki would kill him. The opening verse of the &quot;Tiruvalluva Maalai&quot;, a medieval Tamil anthology usually dated by modern scholars to between c. 7th and 10th centuries CE, is attributed to an &quot;asariri&quot; or oracle. However, there are no references in any Indian literature of the oracle being a specific person.

Contemporarily, Theyyam or &quot;theiyam&quot; in Malayalam - a south Indian language - the process by which a Priest invites a Hindu god or goddess to use his or her body as a medium or channel and answer other devotees&#x27; questions, still happens. The same is called &quot;arulvaakku&quot; or &quot;arulvaak&quot; in Tamil, another south Indian language - Adhiparasakthi Siddhar Peetam is famous for arulvakku in Tamil Nadu. The people in and around Mangalore in Karnataka call the same, Buta Kola, &quot;paathri&quot; or &quot;darshin&quot;; in other parts of Karnataka, it is known by various names such as, &quot;prashnaavali&quot;, &quot;vaagdaana&quot;, &quot;asei&quot;, &quot;aashirvachana&quot; and so on. In Nepal it is known as, &quot;Devta ka dhaamee&quot; or &quot;jhaakri&quot;.

===Nigeria===
The Igbo people of southeastern Nigeria in Africa have a long tradition of using oracles. In Igbo villages, oracles were usually female priestesses to a particular deity, usually dwelling in a cave or other secluded location away from urban areas, and, much as the oracles of ancient Greece, would deliver prophecies in an ecstatic state to visitors seeking advice. Two of their ancient oracles became especially famous during the pre-colonial period: the Agbala oracle at Awka and the Chukwu oracle at Arochukwu. Although the vast majority of Igbos today are Christian, many of them still use oracles.

Among the related Yoruba peoples of the same country, the Babalawos (and their female counterparts, the Iyanifas) serve collectively as the principal aspects of the tribe&#x27;s world-famous Ifa divination system. Due to this, they customarily officiate at a great many of its traditional and religious ceremonies.

===Norse mythology===
In Norse mythology, Odin took the severed head of the god Mimir to Asgard for consultation as an oracle. The &quot;Havamal&quot; and other sources relate the sacrifice of Odin for the oracular runes whereby he lost an eye (external sight) and won wisdom (internal sight; insight).

===Pre-Columbian Americas===
In the migration myth of the Mexitin, i.e., the early Aztecs, a mummy-bundle (perhaps an effigy) carried by four priests directed the trek away from the cave of origins by giving oracles. An oracle led to the foundation of Mexico-Tenochtitlan. The Yucatec Mayas knew oracle priests or &quot;chilanes&quot;, literally &#x27;mouthpieces&#x27; of the deity. Their written repositories of traditional knowledge, the Books of Chilam Balam, were all ascribed to one famous oracle priest who had correctly predicted the coming of the Spaniards and its associated disasters.

===Tibet===
In Tibet, oracles (Chinese: 护法) have played, and continue to play, an important part in religion and government. The word &quot;oracle&quot; is used by Tibetans to refer to the spirit that enters those men and women who act as media between the natural and the spiritual realms. The media are, therefore, known as &quot;kuten&quot;, which literally means, &quot;the physical basis&quot;. In the 29-Article Ordinance for the More Effective Governing of Tibet (), an imperial decree published in 1793 by the Qianlong Emperor, article 1 states that the creation of Golden Urn is to ensure prosperity of Gelug, and to eliminate cheating and corruption in the selection process performed by oracles.

The Dalai Lama, who lives in exile in northern India, still consults an oracle known as the &quot;Nechung Oracle&quot;, which is considered the official state oracle of the government of Tibet. The Dalai Lama has, according to centuries-old custom, consulted the Nechung Oracle during the new year festivities of Losar. Nechung and Gadhong are the primary oracles currently consulted; former oracles such as Karmashar and Darpoling are no longer active in exile. The Gadhong oracle has died leaving Nechung to be the only primary oracle. Another oracle the Dalai Lama consults is the &quot;Tenma Oracle&quot;, for which a young Tibetan woman by the name of Khandro La is the medium for the mountain goddesses Tseringma along with the other 11 goddesses. The Dalai Lama gives a complete description of the process of trance and spirit possession in his book &quot;Freedom in Exile&quot;.
Dorje Shugden oracles were once consulted by the Dalai Lamas until the 14th Dalai Lama banned the practice, even though he consulted Dorje Shugden for advice to escape and was successful in it. Due to the ban, many of the abbots that were worshippers of Dorje Shugden have been forced to go against the Dalai Lama.

<text>Oracle Corporation is an American multinational computer technology company headquartered in Austin, Texas. Co-founded in 1977 in Santa Clara, California, by Larry Ellison, who remains executive chairman, Oracle was the third-largest software company in the world in 2020 by revenue and market capitalization. The company&#x27;s 2023 ranking in the &quot;Forbes&quot; Global 2000 was 80. 

The company sells database software, particularly Oracle Database, and cloud computing. Oracle&#x27;s core application software is a suite of enterprise software products, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) software, human capital management (HCM) software, customer relationship management (CRM) software, enterprise performance management (EPM) software, Customer Experience Commerce (CX Commerce) and supply chain management (SCM) software.

==History==


Larry Ellison, Bob Miner, and Ed Oates co-founded Oracle in 1977 in Santa Clara, California, as Software Development Laboratories (SDL). Ellison took inspiration from the 1970 paper written by Edgar F. Codd on relational database management systems (RDBMS) named &quot;A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks.&quot; He heard about the IBM System R database from an article in the &quot;IBM Research Journal&quot; provided by Oates. Ellison wanted to make Oracle&#x27;s product compatible with System R, but failed to do so as IBM kept the error codes for their DBMS a secret. SDL changed its name to Relational Software, Inc (RSI) in 1979, then again to Oracle Systems Corporation in 1983, to align itself more closely with its flagship product Oracle Database. The name also drew from the codename of a 1977 Central Intelligence Agency project, which was also Oracle&#x27;s first customer. At this stage, Bob Miner served as the company&#x27;s senior programmer. On March 12, 1986, the company had its initial public offering.

In 1989, Oracle moved its world headquarters to the Redwood Shores neighborhood of Redwood City, California, though its campus was not completed until 1995.

In 1995, Oracle Systems Corporation changed its name to Oracle Corporation, officially named Oracle, but is sometimes referred to as Oracle Corporation, the name of the holding company.

Oracle acquired the following technology companies:

# PeopleSoft (2005), an ERP company
# Siebel (2006), a CRM company
# BEA Systems (2008), an enterprise infrastructure software company
# Sun Microsystems (2010), a computer hardware and software company (noted for its Java programming language).

On July 15, 2013, Oracle transferred its stock listing from Nasdaq to the New York Stock Exchange. At the time, it was the largest-ever U.S. market transfer.

In an effort to compete with Amazon Web Services and its products, Oracle announced in 2019 it was partnering with former rival Microsoft. The alliance claimed that Oracle Cloud and Microsoft Azure would be directly connected, allowing customers of each to store data on both cloud computing platforms and run software on either Oracle or Azure. Some saw this not only as an attempt to compete with Amazon but also with Google and Salesforce, which acquired Looker and Tableau Software, respectively.

In December 2020, Oracle announced that it was moving its world headquarters from Redwood Shores to Austin, Texas.

In December 2021, Oracle announced the acquisition of Cerner, a health information technology company. The acquisition of Cerner was completed on June 8, 2022, for US$28.3 billion in cash. Also in December 2021, Oracle announced the acquisition of Federos, an artificial intelligence (AI) and automation tools company for network performance.

In February 2023, the company announced it was going to invest $1.5 billion into the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, including opening a data centre in the country&#x27;s capital, Riyadh.

In April 2024, Oracle announced it was moving its world headquarters from Austin to a new complex in Nashville, Tennessee. No timeframe was given.

In June 2024, Oracle announced a $1 billion investment in Spain to enhance artificial intelligence and cloud computing. This investment will create a new cloud region in Madrid in partnership with Telefónica. The goal is to help Spanish businesses and the public sector with digital transformation and to meet European Union regulations.

In January 2025, President Donald Trump announced Stargate, a joint venture by Oracle, OpenAI, SoftBank and investment firm MGX to invest $500 billion over four years in artificial intelligence infrastructure in the US.

==Products and services==
Oracle designs, manufactures, and sells both software and hardware products and offers services that complement them (such as financing, training, consulting, and hosting services). Many of the products have been added to Oracle&#x27;s portfolio through acquisitions.

===Software===
Oracle&#x27;s E-delivery service (Oracle Software Delivery Cloud) provides generic downloadable Oracle software and documentation.

====Databases====
* Oracle Database
** Release 10: In 2004, Oracle Corporation shipped release 10&quot;g&quot; (&quot;g&quot; standing for &quot;grid&quot;) as the then latest version of Oracle Database. (Oracle Application Server 10&quot;g&quot; using Java EE integrated with the server part of that version of the database, making it possible to deploy web-technology applications. The application server was the first middle-tier software designed for grid computing. The interrelationship between Oracle 10&quot;g&quot; and Java allowed developers to set up stored procedures written in the Java language, as well as, those written in the traditional Oracle database programming language, PL/SQL.)
** Release 11: Release 11g became available in 2007. Oracle Corporation released Oracle Database 11g Release 2 in September 2009. This version was available in four commercial editions—Enterprise Edition, Standard Edition, Standard Edition One, and Personal Edition—and in one free edition—the Express Edition. The licensing of these editions shows various restrictions and obligations that were called complex by licensing expert Freirich Florea. The Enterprise Edition (DB EE), the most expensive of the Database Editions, has the fewest restrictions—but nevertheless has complex licensing. Oracle Corporation constrains the Standard Edition (DB SE) and Standard Edition One (SE1) with more licensing restrictions, in accordance with their lower price.
** Release 12: Release 12&quot;c&quot; (&quot;c&quot; standing for &quot;cloud&quot;) became available on July 1, 2013.

Oracle Corporation has acquired and developed the following additional database technologies:
* Berkeley DB, which offers embedded database processing
* Oracle Rdb, a relational database system running on OpenVMS platforms. Oracle acquired Rdb in 1994 from Digital Equipment Corporation. Oracle has since made many enhancements to this product and development continues .
* TimesTen, which features in-memory database operations
* Oracle Essbase, which continues the Hyperion Essbase tradition of multi-dimensional database management
* MySQL, a relational database management system licensed under the GNU General Public License, initially developed by MySQL AB
* Oracle NoSQL Database, a scalable, distributed key-value NoSQL database

====Middleware====

Oracle Fusion Middleware is a family of middleware software products, including (for instance) application server, system integration, business process management (BPM), user interaction, content management, identity management and business intelligence (BI) products.

=====Oracle Secure Enterprise Search=====
Oracle Secure Enterprise Search (SES), Oracle&#x27;s enterprise-search offering, gives users the ability to search for content across multiple locations, including websites, XML files, file servers, content management systems, enterprise resource planning systems, customer relationship management systems, business intelligence systems, and databases.

The exact nature of the agreement is still unknown, but it implies that Oracle will become TikTok&#x27;s technology partner and assume responsibility for the company&#x27;s U.S. user data. The agreement is still pending approval from regulatory government bodies.

==Marketing==

===Sales practices===
In 1990, Oracle laid off 10% (about 400 people) of its work force because of accounting errors. This crisis came about because of Oracle&#x27;s &quot;up-front&quot; marketing strategy, in which sales people urged potential customers to buy the largest possible amount of software all at once. The sales people then booked the value of future license sales in the current quarter, thereby increasing their bonuses. This became a problem when the future sales subsequently failed to materialize. Oracle eventually had to restate its earnings twice, and also settled (out of court) class-action lawsuits arising from its having overstated its earnings. Ellison stated in 1992 that Oracle had made &quot;an incredible business mistake&quot;.

===Competition===
In 1994, Informix overtook Sybase and became Oracle&#x27;s most important rival. The intense war between Informix CEO Phil White and Ellison made front-page news in Silicon Valley for three years. Informix claimed that Oracle had hired away Informix engineers to disclose important trade secrets about an upcoming product. Informix finally dropped its lawsuit against Oracle in 1997. In November 2005, a book detailing the war between Oracle and Informix was published, titled &quot;The Real Story of Informix Software and Phil White&quot;. It gave a detailed chronology of the battle of Informix against Oracle, and how Informix Software&#x27;s CEO Phil White landed in jail because of his obsession with overtaking Ellison.

Once it had overcome Informix and Sybase, Oracle Corporation enjoyed years of dominance in the database market until the use of Microsoft SQL Server became widespread in the late 1990s and IBM acquired Informix Software in 2001 (to complement its Db2 database). Oracle competes for new database licenses on UNIX, GNU, and Windows operating systems primarily against IBM&#x27;s Db2 and Microsoft SQL Server. IBM&#x27;s Db2 dominates the mainframe database market.

In 2004, Oracle&#x27;s sales grew at a rate of 14.5% to $6.2 billion, giving it 41.3% and the top share of the relational-database market (&quot;InformationWeek&quot; – March 2005), with market share estimated at up to 44.6% in 2005 by some sources.
Oracle Corporation&#x27;s main competitors in the database arena remain IBM Db2 and Microsoft SQL Server, and to a lesser extent Sybase and Teradata, with free databases such as PostgreSQL and MySQL also having a significant share of the market. EnterpriseDB, based on PostgreSQL, has made inroads by proclaiming that its product delivers Oracle compatibility features at a much lower price-point.

In the software-applications market, Oracle Corporation primarily competes against SAP. On March 22, 2007, Oracle sued SAP, accusing them of fraud and unfair competition.

In the market for business intelligence software, many other software companies—small and large—have successfully competed in quality with Oracle and SAP products. Business intelligence vendors can be categorized into the &quot;big four&quot; consolidated BI firms such as Oracle, who has entered BI market through a recent trend of acquisitions (including Hyperion Solutions), and the independent &quot;pure play&quot; vendors such as MicroStrategy, Actuate, and SAS.

Oracle Financials was ranked in the Top 20 Most Popular Accounting Software Infographic by Capterra in 2014, beating out SAP and a number of their other competitors.

====Oracle and SAP====
From 1988, Oracle Corporation and the German company SAP AG had a decade-long history of cooperation, beginning with the integration of SAP&#x27;s R/3 enterprise application suite with Oracle&#x27;s relational database products. Despite the SAP partnership with Microsoft, and the increasing integration of SAP applications with Microsoft products (such as Microsoft SQL Server, a competitor to Oracle Database), Oracle and SAP continue their cooperation. According to Oracle Corporation, the majority of SAP&#x27;s customers use Oracle databases.

In 2004, Oracle began to increase its interest in the enterprise-applications market (in 1989, Oracle had already released Oracle Financials). A series of acquisitions by Oracle Corporation began, most notably with those of PeopleSoft, Siebel Systems and Hyperion.

SAP recognized that Oracle had started to become a competitor in a markets where SAP had the leadership, and saw an opportunity to lure in customers from those companies that Oracle Corporation had acquired. SAP would offer those customers special discounts on the licenses for its enterprise applications.

Oracle Corporation would resort to a similar strategy, by advising SAP customers to get &quot;OFF SAP&quot; (a play on the words of the acronym for its middleware platform &quot;Oracle Fusion for SAP&quot;), and also by providing special discounts on licenses and services to SAP customers who chose Oracle Corporation products.

 Oracle and SAP (the latter through its recently acquired subsidiary TomorrowNow) compete in the third-party enterprise software maintenance and support market. On March 22, 2007, Oracle filed a lawsuit against SAP. In Oracle Corporation v. SAP AG Oracle alleged that TomorrowNow, which provides discount support for legacy Oracle product lines, used the accounts of former Oracle customers to systematically download patches and support documents from Oracle&#x27;s website and to appropriate them for SAP&#x27;s use. Some analysts have suggested the suit could form part of a strategy by Oracle Corporation to decrease competition with SAP in the market for third-party enterprise software maintenance and support.

On July 3, 2007, SAP admitted that TomorrowNow employees had made &quot;inappropriate downloads&quot; from the Oracle support website. However, it claims that SAP personnel and SAP customers had no access to Oracle intellectual property via TomorrowNow. SAP&#x27;s CEO Henning Kagermann stated that &quot;Even a single inappropriate download is unacceptable from my perspective. We regret very much that this occurred.&quot; Additionally, SAP announced that it had &quot;instituted changes&quot; in TomorrowNow&#x27;s operational oversight.

On November 23, 2010, a U.S. district court jury in Oakland, California, found that SAP AG must pay Oracle Corp $1.3 billion for copyright infringement, awarding damages that could be the largest-ever for copyright infringement. While admitting liability, SAP estimated the damages at no more than $40 million, while Oracle claimed that they are at least $1.65 billion. The awarded amount is one of the 10 or 20 largest jury verdicts in U.S. legal history. SAP said they were disappointed by the verdict and might appeal. On September 1, 2011, a federal judge overturned the judgment and offered a reduced amount or a new trial, calling Oracle&#x27;s original award &quot;grossly&quot; excessive. Oracle chose a new trial.

On August 3, 2012, SAP and Oracle agreed on a judgment for $306 million in damages, pending approval from the U.S. district court judge, &quot;to save time and expense of [a] new trial&quot;. After the accord has been approved, Oracle can ask a federal appeals court to reinstate the earlier jury verdict. In addition to the damages payment, SAP has already paid Oracle $120 million for its legal fees.

===Media===
Oracle Corporation produces and distributes the &quot;Oracle ClearView&quot; series of videos as part of its marketing mix.

== Finances ==

Oracle was ranked No. 82 in the 2018 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue. According to Bloomberg, Oracle&#x27;s CEO-to-employee pay ratio is 1,205:1. The CEO&#x27;s compensation in 2017 was $108,295,023. Oracle is one of the approved employers of ACCA and the median employee compensation rate was $89,887.

==Carbon footprint==
Oracle reported total carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions (direct + indirect) for the twelve months ending December 31, 2020 at 428 kilotonnes (+63/+17% year over year) and plans to reduce emissions 26% by 2025 from a 2015 base year.

==Controversies==
===Trashgate===
In 2000, Oracle attracted attention from the computer industry and the press after hiring private investigators to dig through the trash of organizations involved in an antitrust trial against Microsoft. The Chairman of Oracle Corporation, Larry Ellison, staunchly defended his company&#x27;s hiring of an East Coast detective agency to investigate groups that supported rival Microsoft Corporation during its antitrust trial, calling the snooping a &quot;public service&quot;. The investigation reportedly included a $1,200 offer to janitors at the Association for Competitive Technology to look through Microsoft&#x27;s trash. When asked how he would feel if others were looking into Oracle&#x27;s business activities, Ellison said: &quot;We will ship our garbage to Redmond, and they can go through it. We believe in full disclosure.&quot;

===&quot;Can&#x27;t break it, can&#x27;t break in&quot;===
In 2002, Oracle Corporation marketed many of its products using the slogan &quot;Can&#x27;t break it, can&#x27;t break in&quot;, or &quot;Unbreakable&quot;. This signified a claim of information security. Oracle Corporation also stressed the reliability of networked databases and network access to databases as major selling points.

However, two weeks after its introduction, David Litchfield, Alexander Kornbrust, Cesar Cerrudo and others demonstrated a whole suite of successful attacks against Oracle products. Oracle Corporation&#x27;s chief security officer Mary Ann Davidson said that, rather than representing a literal claim of Oracle&#x27;s products&#x27; impregnability, she saw the campaign in the context of fourteen independent security evaluations that Oracle Corporation&#x27;s database server had passed.

===Relationship with John Ashcroft===
In 2004, then-United States Attorney General John Ashcroft sued Oracle Corporation to prevent it from acquiring a multibillion-dollar intelligence contract. After Ashcroft&#x27;s resignation from government, he founded a lobbying firm, The Ashcroft Group, which Oracle hired in 2005. With the group&#x27;s help, Oracle went on to acquire the contract.

===Expeditionary Combat Support System===
Computer Sciences Corporation, as the prime contractor, reportedly spent a billion dollars developing the Expeditionary Combat Support System for the United States Air Force. It yielded no significant capability, because, according to an Air Force source, the prime contractor &quot;was simply not up to the task of adapting&quot; the Oracle software, on which the system was based, to meet the specialized performance criteria.

===Cover Oregon Healthcare Exchange===
Oracle Corporation was awarded a contract by the State of Oregon&#x27;s Oregon Health Authority (OHA) to develop Cover Oregon, the state&#x27;s healthcare exchange website, as part of the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. When the site tried to go live on October 1, 2013, it failed, and registrations had to be taken using paper applications until the site could be fixed.

On April 25, 2014, the State of Oregon voted to discontinue Cover Oregon and instead use the federal exchange to enroll Oregon residents. The cost of switching to the federal portal was estimated at $5 million, whereas fixing Cover Oregon would have required another $78 million.

Oracle president Safra Catz responded to Cover Oregon and the OHA in a letter claiming that the site&#x27;s problems were due to OHA mismanagement, specifically that a third-party systems integrator was not hired to manage the complex project.

In August 2014, Oracle Corporation sued Cover Oregon for breach of contract, and then later that month the state of Oregon sued Oracle Corporation, in a civil complaint for breach of contract, fraud, filing false claims and &quot;racketeering&quot;. In September 2016, the two sides reached a settlement valued at over $100 million to the state, and a six-year agreement for Oracle to continue modernizing state software and IT.

===Class action tracking lawsuit===
In August 2022, a class action lawsuit was filed against Oracle by the law firm Lieff Cabraser. The lawsuit alleges that Oracle engaged in &quot;deliberate and purposeful surveillance of the general population via their digital and online existence&quot;, specifically focusing on Oracle operating a surveillance machine which tracks in real-time and records indefinitely the personal information of hundreds of millions of people. The litigants argues that through such surveillance, the company violates the Federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act, California&#x27;s state constitution, the California Invasion of Privacy Act, competition law, and California Common Law.

The lawsuit was settled in July 2024 when Oracle paid $115 million to some of its customers and agreed to stop tracking users.

=== Heritage Foundation database of employees for Republican administration ===
In 2023, Oracle was contracted by conservative think tank Heritage Foundation to construct a database of conservative employees to help staff a prospective Republican presidency in 2025, part of the Foundation&#x27;s Project 2025.

=== Violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ===

==== Africa ====
In August 2011, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that Oracle was being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for paying bribes to government officials in order to win business in Africa, in contravention of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).

==== India ====
In 2012 Oracle agreed to pay about $2 million to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC at the time alleged that the company&#x27;s Indian subsidiary structured transactions with foreign governments in a way that enabled them to hold about $2.2 million of the proceeds inside funds that could be used for unauthorized purposes and therefore was a violation of the FCPA.

==== India, Turkey, United Arab Emirates ====
In September 2022, Oracle settled with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) without admitting or denying its findings, by agreeing to pay $23 million to settle the charges. The SEC announced that Oracle violated the FCPA between 2014 and 2019 when its subsidiaries in India, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) created slush funds to bribe foreign officials in order to win business.

==== South African National Treasury contract and corruption probe ====
In 2017, a whistleblower notified the SEC and US Department of Justice, alleging possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in awarding of a contract by National Treasury in 2015.

In March 2024, South Africa&#x27;s Special Investigating Unit found that there were conflicts of interest, irregular processes, and non-compliance with policies and legislation, and said it would petition to blacklist Oracle in South Africa, cancel the contract and recover the money paid.

=== Ownership of JavaScript trademark ===
In November 2024, Deno Land filed a petition with the US Patent and Trademark Office to cancel Oracle&#x27;s registered trademark for &quot;JavaScript&quot; because it is &quot;a generic term that Oracle has never controlled and thus isn&#x27;t eligible under the law for trademark protection&quot;, &quot;Oracle abandoned the JavaScript trademark because it doesn&#x27;t actually use the term in any of the products or services it sells&quot;, and because Oracle made false statements when Oracle applied for the trademark. In February 2024, Oracle denied all three claims.

==Events==

===Acquisition of Sun Microsystems===

In January 2010, Oracle completed its acquisition of Sun Microsystems—valued at more than $7 billion—a move that transformed Oracle from solely a software company to a manufacturer of both software and hardware. The acquisition was delayed for several months by the European Commission because of concerns about MySQL, but was unconditionally approved in the end. In September 2011, U.S. State Department Embassy cables were leaked to WikiLeaks. One cable revealed that the U.S. pressured the E.U. to allow Oracle to acquire Sun.

The Sun acquisition was closely watched by free software users and some companies, due to the fear that Oracle might end Sun&#x27;s traditional support of free projects. Since the acquisition, Oracle has discontinued OpenSolaris and StarOffice, and sued Google over the Java patents Oracle acquired from Sun.

===Fraud Accusations by the US Department of Justice===
On July 29, 2010, the United States Department of Justice (DoJ) filed suit against Oracle Corporation alleging fraud. The lawsuit argues that the government received deals inferior to those Oracle gave to its commercial clients. The DoJ added its heft to an already existing whistleblower lawsuit filed by Paul Frascella, who was once senior director of contract services at Oracle. It was settled in 2011.

===Lawsuit against Google===
==== Background ====
Oracle, the plaintiff, acquired ownership of the Java computer programming language when it acquired Sun Microsystems in January 2010. The Java software includes sets of pre-developed software code to allow programs and apps to accomplish common tasks in a consistent manner. The pre-developed code is organized into separate &quot;packages&quot; which each contain a set of &quot;classes&quot;. Each class contains numerous methods, which instruct a program or app to do a certain task. Software developers &quot;became accustomed to using Java&#x27;s designations at the package, class, and method level&quot;.

Oracle and Google (the defendant) tried to negotiate an agreement for Oracle to license Java to Google, which would have allowed Google to use Java in developing programs for mobile devices using the Android operating system. However, the two companies never reached an agreement. After negotiations failed, Google created its own programming platform, which was based on Java, and contained 37 copied Java packages as well as new packages developed by Google.

==== First trial ====
In 2010, Oracle sued Google for copyright infringement for the use of the 37 Java packages. The case was handled in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California and assigned to Judge William Alsup (who taught himself how to code computers). In the lawsuit, Oracle sought between $1.4 billion and $6.1 billion. In June 2011 the judge had to force Google through a judicial order to make public the details about Oracle&#x27;s claim for damages.

By the end of the first jury trial (the legal dispute would eventually go on to another trial) the arguments made by Oracle&#x27;s attorneys focused on a Java function called &quot;rangeCheck&quot;:The argument centered on a function called rangeCheck. Of all the lines of code that Oracle had tested—15 million in total—these were the only ones that were &#x27;literally&#x27; copied. Every keystroke, a perfect duplicate. – &quot;The Verge&quot;, 10/19/17Although Google admitted to copying the packages, Judge Alsup found that none of the Java packages were covered under copyright protection, and therefore Google did not infringe.

==== First appeal ====
After the case was over, Oracle appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (750 F.3d 1339 (2014)). On May 9, 2014, the appeals court partially reversed Judge Alsup&#x27;s decision, finding that Java APIs are copyrightable. API stands for &quot;application programming interface&quot; and are how different computer programs or apps communicate with each other. However, the appeals court also left open the possibility that Google might have a &quot;fair use&quot; defense.

==== Supreme Court petition ====
On October 6, 2014, Google filed a petition to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, but the Supreme Court denied the petition.

==== Second trial ====
The case was then returned to the U.S. District Court for another trial about Google&#x27;s fair use defense. Oracle sought $9 billion in damages. In May 2016, the trial jury found that Google&#x27;s use of Java&#x27;s APIs was considered fair use.

==== Second appeal ====
In February 2017, Oracle filed another appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. This time it was asking for a new trial because the District Court &quot;repeatedly undermined Oracle&#x27;s case&quot;, which Oracle argued led the jury to make the wrong decision. According to ZDNet, &quot;For example, it [Oracle] says the court wrongly bought Google&#x27;s claim that Android was limited to smartphones while Java was for PCs, whereas Oracle contends that Java and Android both compete as platforms for smart TVs, cars, and wearables.&quot;

===Discontinuation of OpenSolaris===
On August 13, 2010, an internal Oracle memo leaked to the Internet cited plans for ending the OpenSolaris operating system project and community. With Oracle planning to develop Solaris only in a closed source fashion, OpenSolaris developers moved to the Illumos and OpenIndiana project, among others.

===Discontinuation of OpenSSO===
As Oracle completed their acquisition of Sun Microsystems in February 2010, they announced that OpenSSO would no longer be their strategic product. Shortly after, OpenSSO was forked to OpenAM. and will continue to be developed and supported by ForgeRock.

===Mark Hurd as president===
On September 6, 2010, Oracle announced that former Hewlett-Packard CEO Mark Hurd was to replace Charles Phillips, who resigned as Oracle co-president. In an official statement made by Larry Ellison, Phillips had previously expressed his desire to transition out of the company. Ellison had asked Phillips to stay on through the integration of Sun Microsystems Inc. In a separate statement regarding the transition, Ellison said &quot;Mark did a brilliant job at HP and I expect he&#x27;ll do even better at Oracle. There is no executive in the IT world with more relevant experience than Mark.&quot;

On September 7, 2010, HP announced a civil lawsuit against Mark Hurd &quot;to protect HP&#x27;s trade secrets&quot;, in response to Oracle hiring Hurd. On September 20, Oracle and HP published a joint press release announcing the resolution of the lawsuit on confidential terms and reaffirming commitment to long-term strategic partnership between the companies.

===OpenOffice.org issue===
A number of OpenOffice.org developers formed The Document Foundation and received backing by Google, Novell, Red Hat, and Canonical, as well as some others, but were unable to get Oracle to donate the brand OpenOffice.org, causing a fork in the development of OpenOffice.org with the foundation now developing and promoting LibreOffice. Oracle expressed no interest in sponsoring the new project and asked the OpenOffice.org developers that started the project to resign from the company due to &quot;conflicts of interest&quot;. On November 1, 2010, 33 of the OpenOffice.org developers gave their letters of resignation. On June 1, 2011, Oracle donated OpenOffice.org to the Apache Software Foundation.

===HP and Oracle lawsuit===
On June 15, 2011, HP filed a lawsuit in California Superior Court in Santa Clara, claiming that Oracle had breached an agreement to support the Itanium microprocessor used in HP&#x27;s high-end enterprise servers. Oracle called the lawsuit &quot;an abuse of the judicial process&quot; and said that had it known SAP&#x27;s Léo Apotheker was about to be hired as HP&#x27;s new CEO, any support for HP&#x27;s Itanium servers would not have been implied.

On August 1, 2012, a California judge said in a tentative ruling that Oracle must continue porting its software at no cost until HP discontinues its sales of Itanium-based servers. HP was awarded $3 billion in damages against Oracle in 2016. HP argued Oracle&#x27;s canceling support damaged HP&#x27;s Itanium server brand. Oracle had announced that it would appeal both the decision and damages, but the decision stayed.

===GSA business bidding ban===
On April 20, 2012, the US General Services Administration banned Oracle from the most popular portal for bidding on GSA contracts for undisclosed reasons. Oracle has previously used this portal for around four hundred million dollars a year in revenue. Oracle previously settled a lawsuit filed under the False Claims Act, which accused the company of overbilling the US government between 1998 and 2006. The 2011 settlement forced Oracle to pay $199.5 million to the General Services Administration.

=== Cerner acquisition ===

On December 20, 2021, Oracle announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire Cerner Corporation (now &quot;Oracle Health&quot; and &quot;Oracle Life Sciences&quot;) for approximately , creating a dedicated Industry Business Unit within the company. Cerner is the largest international supplier of health information technology, such as electronic health records (EHR), revenue cycle solutions, and biomedical device integration platforms, and has its headquarters in Kansas City, Missouri, US. The deal closed in early July 2022 after receiving final approval from European regulators, making it Oracle&#x27;s largest acquisition and one of the largest in corporate history.

Oracle&#x27;s purchase of Cerner is part of an effort to introduce Oracle products into the healthcare market, particularly in the United States although Oracle plans to expand Cerner&#x27;s global operations. It mirrors closely to expansions of other large information technology companies such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon into the healthcare sector. Cerner already used Oracle solutions for its &quot;largest business and most important clinical system&quot;, and Oracle announced its intention to integrate autonomous solutions such as the Oracle Voice Digital Assistant into Cerner clinical solutions. Oracle additionally has shared its plans to improve the usability and user experience of Cerner solutions.

While the acquisition was originally met with mixed reactions by industry and investors, some industry experts have developed a more positive perception of the purchase. Cerner won a major contract in 2017 to supply its EHR software to the US Department of Defense and Veterans Administration Hospitals, which resulted in Cerner &quot;leaving its traditional base of hospital systems high and dry&quot; with delays in resolving issues and implementing innovations. Oracle&#x27;s acquisition allows for the larger corporation to support Cerner&#x27;s operations, with the goal of &quot;addressing basic operational issues... improving resiliency and usability&quot; in the short-term. Some opinions have expressed longer-term concern, with Oracle Health expecting a decline in US-based sales in 2024, although an increase in global sales. Additionally, clients of Cerner have reported minimal improvements to the core system and a focus by Oracle on future advancements over resolving current issues.

A September 2024 announcement by Oracle listed &quot;tens of thousands of engineering hours and millions of dollars&quot; of investments in the core clinical operations, and the release of the highly anticipated Oracle Clinical Digital Assistant, a generative AI system that automatically creates consultation documentation and proposes orders.

=== U.S. TikTok&#x27;s operations ===
On September 13, 2020, Bloomberg News reported that Oracle won a bidding war with other U.S.-based companies to take over social media company TikTok&#x27;s operations in the United States following the company&#x27;s pressure to forcibly be shut down by the Trump administration. Oracle was described as a &quot;trusted tech partner&quot; by TikTok, suggesting the deal may not be as structured as an outright sale. On September 19, 2020, the Trump administration approved of the sale of TikTok&#x27;s US operations to Oracle &quot;[delaying] — by one week — restrictions that were originally to take effect&quot; on September 20 as indicated by the United States Department of Commerce.

On February 10, 2021, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing a source familiar with the matter, the Biden administration would be backing off from banning TikTok and shelving the sale of TikTok indefinitely, as the U.S. Commerce Department began reviewing whether or not Trump&#x27;s claims about TikTok can justify the attempts to ban it.
On February 27, 2023, Biden changed his &quot;indefinite&quot; stance on TikTok as he echoed Trump&#x27;s 2020 claims of disapproval. Biden said Federal agencies have thirty days to remove TikTok from all federal devices. Federal contractors must meet the same standard in ninety days. On March 8, 2024, Biden said he would sign a bipartisan bill banning TikTok in the United States if the Chinese company ByteDance didn&#x27;t divest.

==Offices==
Since December 2020, Oracle Corporation&#x27;s world headquarters has been located in Austin, Texas. Oracle has plans to build its largest office hub, with 8500 jobs, in Nashville, Tennessee within the next few decades.

Oracle has a large office complex located on the San Francisco Peninsula in the Redwood Shores area of Redwood City. This complex was home to Oracle world headquarters from 1989 to 2020. It is located on the former site of Marine World/Africa USA, which moved from Redwood Shores to Vallejo in 1986. Oracle Corporation originally leased two buildings on the Oracle Parkway site, moving its finance and administration departments from the corporation&#x27;s former headquarters on Davis Drive, Belmont, California. Eventually, Oracle purchased the complex and constructed four additional buildings.

The distinctive Oracle Parkway buildings, nicknamed the Emerald City, served as sets for the futuristic headquarters of the fictional company &quot;NorthAm Robotics&quot; in the Robin Williams film &quot;Bicentennial Man&quot; (1999). The campus also represented the headquarters of Cyberdyne Systems in the movie &quot;Terminator Genisys&quot; (2015).

== Corporate structures ==
Oracle Corporation operates in multiple markets and has acquired several companies which formerly functioned autonomously. In some cases these provided the starting points for global business units (GBUs) targeting particular vertical markets. Oracle Corporation GBUs include:

* Communications
* Construction and engineering—formerly the Primavera GBU
* Financial services 
* Food and Beverages
* Health sciences
* Hospitality
* Retail
* Energy and Water

==Sponsorships==
On October 20, 2006, the Golden State Warriors and the Oracle Corporation announced a 10-year agreement in which the Oakland Arena would become known as the Oracle Arena. The agreement ended after the 2018–2019 NBA season when the Warriors relocated to the Chase Center in San Francisco.

Larry Ellison&#x27;s sailing team competes as Oracle Team USA. The team has won the America&#x27;s Cup twice, in 2010 (as BMW Oracle Racing) and in 2013, despite being penalized for cheating.

Sean Tucker&#x27;s &quot;Challenger II&quot; stunt biplane is sponsored by Oracle and performs frequently at air shows around the US.

In January 2019, the San Francisco Giants entered into a 20-year agreement to rename their stadium Oracle Park.

From the 2022 Formula One season, Oracle signed a five-year deal worth $500m to become title sponsors of Red Bull Racing, after already being a sponsor effective from the 2021 season. In 1994 and 1995, Oracle sponsored Benetton. It was revealed in July 2022 that NASCAR&#x27;s Joe Gibbs Racing team tried to sign a sponsorship with Oracle after Mars Inc. would announce they would leave JGR after the 2022 season, but the deal reportedly fell through.

<text>The Official Monster Raving Loony Party (OMRLP) is a political party established in the United Kingdom in 1982 by the musician David Sutch, also known as Screaming Lord Sutch, 3rd Earl of Harrow, or simply Lord Sutch. It is notable for its deliberately bizarre policies and it effectively exists to satirise British politics, and by fielding novelty candidates to offer itself as an alternative for protest voters, especially in constituencies where the party holding a safe seat is unlikely to lose it.

==History==
===Sutch era===
Starting in 1963, David Sutch, head of the rock group Screaming Lord Sutch and the Savages, stood in British parliamentary elections under a range of party names, initially as the National Teenage Party candidate. At that time, the minimum voting age was 21. The party&#x27;s name was intended to highlight what Sutch and others viewed as hypocrisy, since teenagers were unable to vote because of their supposed immaturity while the adults running the country were involved in scandals such as the Profumo affair.

Sutch moved to America in 1968. After being shot during a mugging attempt while living in the United States, Sutch returned to Britain (and to politics) during the 1980s. The Raving Loony name first appeared at the Bermondsey by-election of 1983.

A similar concept had appeared earlier in the Election Night Special sketch on the television comedy series &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;, in which the Silly and Sensible parties competed; and a similar skit by &quot;The Goodies&quot;, in which Graeme Garden stood as a Science Loony. A Science Fiction Looney candidate had also competed in the 1976 Cambridge by-election.

Two others were important in the formation of the OMRLP: John Desmond Dougrez-Lewis stood in the Crosby by-election of 1981 (won by the Social Democratic Party&#x27;s co-founder Shirley Williams); and Dougrez-Lewis stood in the by-election as Tarquin Fin-tim-lin-bin-whin-bim-lim-bus-stop-F&#x27;tang-F&#x27;tang-Olé-Biscuitbarrel, taken from the Election Night Special Monty Python sketch. He had changed his name by deed poll from John Desmond Lewis, on behalf of the Cambridge University Raving Loony Society (Curls), an &quot;anti-political party&quot; and charity fundraising group formed largely as a fun counter-response to increasingly polarised student politics in Cambridge. It was responsible for a number of fun stunts. Its Oxford University equivalents were the &quot;Oxford Raving Lunatics&quot;. Dougrez-Lewis became Sutch&#x27;s agent at the notorious Bermondsey by-election, where the OMRLP banner was first officially unfurled. Reverting to his original name, Dougrez-Lewis stood for the new party in Cambridge in the 1983 general election.

Another serial offbeat by-election candidate was Commander Bill Boaks, a retired World War II hero who took part in sinking the &quot;Bismarck&quot;. Boaks campaigned and stood for election for over 30 years on limited funds, always on the issue of road safety. Boaks proved influential on Sutch&#x27;s direction as the leading anti-politician: &quot;It&#x27;s the ones who &quot;don&#x27;t&quot; vote you really want, because they&#x27;re the ones who think.&quot;

Boaks thought that increased traffic and more roads would cause problems, and he addressed road safety with flamboyant campaigning and a variety of tactics, including private prosecution of public figures who escaped public prosecution for drunk driving. He successfully campaigned with Sutch and others to pedestrianise London&#x27;s Carnaby Street. While recovering from being struck by a motorcycle, Boaks was one of Sutch&#x27;s counting agents at Bermondsey in 1983. Following Boaks&#x27;s death, popular opinion towards road safety has become closer to his views.

Screaming Lord Sutch died by suicide on 16 June 1999 while suffering from clinical depression after his mother, Annie, died in 1998. A biography of Sutch, &quot;The Man Who Was Screaming Lord Sutch&quot; (by Graham Sharpe, the media relations manager of bookmaker William Hill), was published in April 2005, describing what remained of the party as &quot;wannabes, never-would-bes and some bloody-well-shouldn&#x27;t-bes&quot;.

===Post-Sutch===
Sutch&#x27;s funeral – organised by his lifetime friend, the session drummer Carlo Little – was attended by members of the OMRLP and Raving Loony Green Giant Party, including Stuart Hughes, who with Freddie Zapp brought along a huge floral tribute shaped as an OMRLP rosette. The running of the OMRLP fell to Alan &quot;Howling Laud&quot; Hope and his cat, Catmando, who were the joint winners of the 1999 membership ballot for the replacement for Sutch. Although Hope took over as party leader after Sutch&#x27;s death, the real day-to-day running of the party has always been done by other party members.

The OMRLP fielded 15 candidates in the 2001 general election, at which it had its best general election results to date.

The manifesto, entitled &quot;The Manicfesto&quot;, for the 2005 general election featured the major commitment of their long held pledge to abolish income tax, citing as always that it was only meant to be a temporary measure during the Napoleonic Wars. Also included was another old staple, the &quot;Putting Parliament on Wheels&quot; idea of having Parliament sit throughout the country rather than solely in Londonwith special emphasis this time in its creation negating the need for national/regional assemblies.

The OMRLP has fielded candidates since 2001, with reduced success and losing their deposits. 

The OMRLP&#x27;s official headquarters was originally the Golden Lion Hotel in Ashburton, Devon, then the Dog &amp; Partridge pub at Yateley in Hampshire, but this was lost shortly after the 2005 general election. Conference venues are now chosen in advance: the 2006 conference was held at Torrington in Devon, and the 2007 conference was held in Jersey. The conference was held in Blackpool in 2017.

The party&#x27;s last elected representative was R. U. Seerius (formerly Jon Brewer) on the 11 member Sawley Parish Council in Derbyshire, first elected (uncontested) in 2005. He was no longer a member as of May 2007, having failed to appear in no fewer than 11 statutory meetings during his time in office, due to illness.

The OMRLP succeeded in standing in the two by-elections of 19 July 2007 in Sedgefield and Ealing Southall, but again achieving derisory results: Alan Hope acquiring 129 votes (0.46%) and John Cartwright taking 188 (0.51%), beating the English Democrats but coming behind the Christian Party of the Reverend George Hargreaves and David Braid.

In recognition that reforms were needed, Peter &#x27;T.C.&#x27; Owen was moved from the honorary position of party chairman to that of deputy leader (and thus effective day-to-day leader) of the OMRLP, while Anthony &quot;The Jersey Flyer&quot; Blyth (owner of the Ommaroo Hotel and a member of the Jersey Heritage Trust) took over Owen&#x27;s role. Owen is one of four Raving Loonies to have scored more than 1000 votes in an election (he polled 2,859 votes in the 1994 European elections).

On 31 May 2017, Hope was interviewed by Andrew Neil on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Daily Politics&quot; programme.

==Electoral performance==
In 1987, the OMRLP won its first seat on Ashburton Town Council in Devon, as Alan &quot;Howling Laud&quot; Hope was elected unopposed. He subsequently became deputy mayor and later mayor of Ashburton in 1998 (mainly opposed by the local Conservatives; they allegedly never forgave him for becoming a member of the OMRLP) until he moved to Hampshire after Sutch&#x27;s death. For over a decade, his hotel The Golden Lion in Ashburton (referred to by some in the party as &quot;The Mucky Mog&quot;) was the party&#x27;s headquarters and conference centre.

To date, two councillors have subsequently become mayors: Alan Hope in Ashburton in Devon and Chris &quot;Screwy&quot; Driver on the Isle of Sheppey in Kent.

At the Bootle by-election in May 1990, the Loony candidate (Sutch) received more votes than the candidate for the continuing Social Democrats. The story was a major headline in many UK newspapers; ironically, the by-election itself had attracted little coverage. Bootle is still regarded by the party as their most significant result in politics, albeit one largely lampooning the political world. 

In the 1995 Perth and Kinkross by-election The OMRLP did better than UKIP and Scottish greens. And In the 2019 Brecon and Radnorshire by-election, the OMRLP candidate Lady Lily the Pink polled more votes than the United Kingdom Independence Party. The party got a record number of votes in the 2019 general election, when it polled 9,739 votes. Having fielded 24 candidates, this was, numerically, the party&#x27;s highest vote at a general election. However, it has yet to improve on its best vote share of 0.1% at the 1992 general election.

The party has yet to save its deposit at a by-election, although the party&#x27;s former leader, Screaming Lord Sutch, came close at the 1994 Rotherham by-election, winning 4.2% of the vote. The threshold for saving a deposit is 5%.

===Parish and town councillors===
As of 2021, the party has seven parish and town councillors, one via the Molesey Residents Association.
===2010 William Hill branding===
For the 2010 general election, the OMRLP used the description &quot;Monster Raving Loony William Hill Party&quot;, which was met with criticism by some members, with John Cartwright, Loony candidate in Croydon, publicly stating: &quot;I am not and will not be a mercenary, or an advert, for a commercial company during the course of the election campaign.&quot;

==Membership==
The statement of accounts for the period 1 January to 31 December 2008 outlines membership at 1,354, made up of 173 paying members and 1,181 &quot;lifetime but non-paying&quot;. It currently costs £15 per year for membership, which includes a party rosette, a certificate of insanity, a Loony badge, a party membership card and a letter from the party&#x27;s leader. A £20.00 membership is available for those overseas.

Sir Patrick Moore (1923–2012), the British TV amateur astronomer, was the finance minister of the party for a short time. He once said that the Monster Raving Loony Party &quot;had an advantage over all the other parties, in that they knew they were loonies&quot;.

In 1992, the Glasgow band Hugh Reed and the Velvet Underpants released the song &quot;Vote Monster Raving Looney&quot;, despite not having any actual ties to the party.

==Policies and electoral strategy==
The OMRLP are distinguished by having a deliberately bizarre manifesto, which contains things that seem to be impossible or too absurd to implement – usually to highlight what they see as real-life absurdities. Despite its satirical nature, some of the things that have featured in Loony manifestos have actually become law, such as &quot;passports for pets&quot;, abolition of dog licences and all-day pub openings.

Other suggestions so far unadopted included minting a 99p coin and forbidding greyhound racing in order to &quot;stop the country going to the dogs&quot;.

The Loonies generally field as many candidates as possible in United Kingdom general elections, some (but by no means all) standing under ridiculous names they have adopted via deed poll. Sutch himself stood against all three main party leaders (John Major, Neil Kinnock and Paddy Ashdown) in the 1992 general election. Parliamentary candidates have to pay their own deposit (which currently stands at £500) and cover all of their expenses. No OMRLP candidate has managed to get the required 5% of the popular vote needed to retain their deposit, but this does not stop people standing. Sutch came closest with 4.2% and over 1,100 votes at the 1994 Rotherham by-election, while Stuart Hughes still holds the record for the largest number of votes for a Loony candidate at a Parliamentary election, with 1,442 at the 1992 general election in the Honiton seat in east Devon. The all-time highest vote achieved was by comedian Danny Blue, who secured 3,339 votes in the 1994 European elections under the pseudonym of &quot;John Major&quot;. Bamford had also acted as an election agent for Lindi St Clair&#x27;s rival Corrective Party, and was a former close associate of Stuart Hughes.

In the run-up to the 2011 Alternative Vote referendum, the party adopted an equivocal stance, advising its supporters, on 8 April, to &quot;vote as you see fit&quot;. In response to mainstream parties debating Brexit, the OMRLP suggested sending Noel Edmonds to the European Parliament &quot;because he understands Deal or No Deal&quot;. It has advocated an &quot;al dente Brexit&quot; rather than a hard or soft Brexit.

==In popular culture==

Screaming Lord Sutch appeared as himself in the opening episode of television sitcom &quot;The New Statesman&quot;, standing for election in the seat of Haltemprice, which was won by Alan B&#x27;Stard for the Conservative Party. Sutch and his party polled second, ahead of Labour and the SDP.

The party&#x27;s regular appearances at by-elections were satirised in the &quot;Blackadder the Third&quot; episode &quot;Dish and Dishonesty&quot;, with a candidate from the Standing at the Back Dressed Stupidly and Looking Stupid Party standing as one of Baldrick&#x27;s rivals in a by-election held in a rotten borough.

A candidate was shown canvassing for a by-election on the &quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot; episode &quot;I&#x27;ll Retire to Bedlam&quot; where a regional news programme filmed him knocking on the Meldrews&#x27; door. He explained the nature of the party, that they had some clearly set out policies, and that people could choose to vote for them as a protest vote; all while dressed vaguely as a bee. Later in the episode, another candidate for one of the major parties was shaking hands with patients in hospital, then came up to Victor to shake his hand and asked if Victor would be voting for him. Victor replied that he would be voting for the Monster Raving Loony Party and that he found their political platform the most sensible of all the major parties.

<doc id="22594" wikidata="Q191756" url="?curid=22594" title="Omega-3 fatty acid">
<text>Omega−3 fatty acids, also called omega−3 oils, ω−3 fatty acids or &quot;n&quot;−3 fatty acids, are polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) characterized by the presence of a double bond three atoms away from the terminal methyl group in their chemical structure. They are widely distributed in nature, are important constituents of animal lipid metabolism, and play an important role in the human diet and in human physiology. The three types of omega−3 fatty acids involved in human physiology are α-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). ALA can be found in plants, while DHA and EPA are found in algae and fish. Marine algae and phytoplankton are primary sources of omega−3 fatty acids. DHA and EPA accumulate in fish that eat these algae. Common sources of plant oils containing ALA include walnuts, edible seeds, and flaxseeds as well as hempseed oil, while sources of EPA and DHA include fish and fish oils, and algae oil.
Almost without exception, animals are unable to synthesize the essential omega−3 fatty acid ALA and can only obtain it through diet. However, they can use ALA, when available, to form EPA and DHA, by creating additional double bonds along its carbon chain (desaturation) and extending it (elongation). Namely, ALA (18 carbons and 3 double bonds) is used to make EPA (20 carbons and 5 double bonds), which is then used to make DHA (22 carbons and 6 double bonds). The ability to make the longer-chain omega−3 fatty acids from ALA may be impaired in aging. In foods exposed to air, unsaturated fatty acids are vulnerable to oxidation and rancidity.

There is no high-quality evidence that dietary supplementation with omega−3 fatty acids reduces the risk of cancer or cardiovascular disease. Fish oil supplement studies have failed to support claims of preventing heart attacks or strokes or any vascular disease outcomes.

==History==
In 1929, George and Mildred Burr discovered that fatty acids were critical to health. If fatty acids were absent from the diet, a life-threatening deficiency syndrome ensued. The Burrs coined the phrase &quot;essential fatty acids&quot;. Since then, researchers have shown a growing interest in unsaturated essential fatty acids as they form the framework for the organism&#x27;s cell membranes. Subsequently, awareness of the health benefits of essential fatty acids has dramatically increased since the 1980s.

On September 8, 2004, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave &quot;qualified health claim&quot; status to EPA and DHA omega−3 fatty acids, stating, &quot;supportive but not conclusive research shows that consumption of EPA and DHA [omega−3] fatty acids may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease&quot;. This updated and modified their health risk advice letter of 2001 (see below).

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency has recognized the importance of DHA omega−3 and permits the following claim for DHA: &quot;DHA, an omega−3 fatty acid, supports the normal physical development of the brain, eyes, and nerves primarily in children under two years of age.&quot;

Historically, whole food diets contained sufficient amounts of omega−3, but because omega−3 is readily oxidized, the trend toward shelf-stable processed foods has led to a deficiency in omega−3 in manufactured foods.

==Nomenclature==
The terms &quot;ω−3 (&quot;omega−3&quot;) fatty acid&quot; and &quot;n−3 fatty acid&quot; are derived from the nomenclature of organic chemistry. One way in which an unsaturated fatty acid is named is determined by the location, in its carbon chain, of the double bond which is closest to the methyl end of the molecule. In general terminology, &quot;n&quot; (or ω) represents the locant of the methyl end of the molecule, while the number &quot;n−x&quot; (or ω−&quot;x&quot;) refers to the locant of its nearest double bond. Thus, in omega&quot;−&quot;3 fatty acids in particular, there is a double bond located at the carbon numbered 3, starting from the methyl end of the fatty acid chain. This classification scheme is useful since most chemical changes occur at the carboxyl end of the molecule, while the methyl group and its nearest double bond are unchanged in most chemical or enzymatic reactions.

In the expressions &quot;n−x&quot; or ω−&quot;x&quot;, the symbol is a minus sign rather than a hyphen (or dash), although it is never read as such. Also, the symbol &quot;n&quot; (or ω) represents the locant of the methyl end, counted from the carboxyl end of the fatty acid carbon chain. For instance, in an omega−3 fatty acid with 18 carbon atoms (see illustration), where the methyl end is at location 18 from the carboxyl end, &quot;n&quot; (or ω) represents the number 18, and the notation n−3 (or ω−3) represents the subtraction 18−3 = 15, where 15 is the locant of the double bond which is closest to the methyl end, counted from the carboxyl end of the chain.

Although &quot;n&quot; and ω (omega) are synonymous, the IUPAC recommends that &quot;n&quot; be used to identify the highest carbon number of a fatty acid. Nevertheless, the more common name – omega&quot;−&quot;3 fatty acid – is used in both the lay media and scientific literature.

===Example===
For example, α-linolenic acid (ALA; illustration) is an 18-carbon chain having three double bonds, the first located at the third carbon from the methyl end of the fatty acid chain. Hence, it is an omega&quot;−&quot;3 fatty acid. Counting from the other end of the chain, that is the carboxyl end, the three double bonds are located at carbons 9, 12, and 15. These three locants are typically indicated as Δ9c, Δ12c, Δ15c, or cisΔ9, cisΔ12, cisΔ15, or cis-cis-cis-Δ9,12,15, where &quot;c&quot; or &quot;cis&quot; means that the double bonds have a &quot;cis&quot; configuration.

α-Linolenic acid is polyunsaturated (containing more than one double bond) and is also described by a lipid number, 18:3, meaning that there are 18 carbon atoms and 3 double bonds.

==Chemistry==
An omega−3 fatty acid is a fatty acid with multiple double bonds, where the first double bond is between the third and fourth carbon atoms from the end of the carbon atom chain. &quot;Short-chain&quot; omega−3 fatty acids have a chain of 18 carbon atoms or less, while &quot;long-chain&quot; omega−3 fatty acids have a chain of 20 or more.

Three omega−3 fatty acids are important in human physiology, α-linolenic acid (18:3, &quot;n&quot;−3; ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5, &quot;n&quot;−3; EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6, &quot;n&quot;−3; DHA). These three polyunsaturates have either 3, 5, or 6 double bonds in a carbon chain of 18, 20, or 22 carbon atoms, respectively. As with most naturally-produced fatty acids, all double bonds are in the &quot;cis&quot;-configuration, in other words, the two hydrogen atoms are on the same side of the double bond; and the double bonds are interrupted by methylene bridges (--), so that there are two single bonds between each pair of adjacent double bonds.

The atoms at bis-allylic (between double bonds) sites are prone to oxidation by free radicals. Replacement of hydrogen atoms with deuterium atoms in this location protects the omega−3 fatty acid from lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis.

===List of omega−3 fatty acids===
This table lists several different names for the most common omega−3 fatty acids found in nature.

==Forms==
Omega−3 fatty acids occur naturally in two forms, triglycerides and phospholipids. In the triglycerides, they, together with other fatty acids, are bonded to glycerol; three fatty acids are attached to glycerol. Phospholipid omega−3 is composed of two fatty acids attached to a phosphate group via glycerol.

The triglycerides can be converted to the free fatty acid or to methyl or ethyl esters, and the individual esters of omega−3 fatty acids are available.

==Mechanism of action==
The &#x27;essential&#x27; fatty acids were given their name when researchers found that they are essential to normal growth in young children and animals. The omega−3 fatty acid DHA, also known as docosahexaenoic acid, is found in high abundance in the human brain. It is produced by a desaturation process, but humans lack the desaturase enzyme, which acts to insert double bonds at the ω6 and ω3 position. Therefore, the ω6 and ω3 polyunsaturated fatty acids cannot be synthesized, are appropriately called essential fatty acids, and must be obtained from the diet.

In 1964, it was discovered that enzymes found in sheep tissues convert omega−6 arachidonic acid into the inflammatory agent, prostaglandin E2, which is involved in the immune response of traumatized and infected tissues. By 1979, eicosanoids were further identified, including thromboxanes, prostacyclins, and leukotrienes. The eicosanoids typically have a short period of activity in the body, starting with synthesis from fatty acids and ending with metabolism by enzymes. If the rate of synthesis exceeds the rate of metabolism, the excess eicosanoids may have deleterious effects. Researchers found that certain omega−3 fatty acids are also converted into eicosanoids and docosanoids, but at a slower rate. If both omega−3 and omega−6 fatty acids are present, they will &quot;compete&quot; to be transformed, so the ratio of long-chain omega−3:omega−6 fatty acids directly affects the type of eicosanoids that are produced.

===Interconversion===

====Conversion efficiency of ALA to EPA and DHA====
Humans can convert short-chain omega−3 fatty acids to long-chain forms (EPA, DHA) with an efficiency below 5%. The omega−3 conversion efficiency is greater in women than in men, but less studied. Higher ALA and DHA values found in plasma phospholipids of women may be due to the higher activity of desaturases, especially that of delta-6-desaturase.

These conversions occur competitively with omega−6 fatty acids, which are essential closely related chemical analogues that are derived from linoleic acid. They both utilize the same desaturase and elongase proteins in order to synthesize inflammatory regulatory proteins. The products of both pathways are vital for growth making a balanced diet of omega−3 and omega−6 important to an individual&#x27;s health. A balanced intake ratio of 1:1 was believed to be ideal in order for proteins to be able to synthesize both pathways sufficiently, but this has been controversial as of recent research.

The conversion of ALA to EPA and further to DHA in humans has been reported to be limited, but varies with individuals. Women have higher ALA-to-DHA conversion efficiency than men, which is presumed to be due to the lower rate of use of dietary ALA for beta-oxidation. One preliminary study showed that EPA can be increased by lowering the amount of dietary linoleic acid, and DHA can be increased by elevating intake of dietary ALA.

====Omega−6 to omega−3 ratio====

Human diet has changed rapidly in recent centuries resulting in a reported increased diet of omega−6 in comparison to omega−3. The rapid evolution of human diet away from a 1:1 omega−3 and omega−6 ratio, such as during the Neolithic Agricultural Revolution, has presumably been too fast for humans to have adapted to biological profiles adept at balancing omega−3 and omega−6 ratios of 1:1. This is commonly believed to be the reason why modern diets are correlated with many inflammatory disorders. While omega−3 polyunsaturated fatty acids may be beneficial in preventing heart disease in humans, the level of omega−6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (and, therefore, the ratio) does not matter.

Both omega−6 and omega−3 fatty acids are essential: humans must consume them in their diet. Omega−6 and omega−3 eighteen-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids compete for the same metabolic enzymes, thus the omega−6:omega−3 ratio of ingested fatty acids has significant influence on the ratio and rate of production of eicosanoids, a group of hormones intimately involved in the body&#x27;s inflammatory and homeostatic processes, which include the prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and thromboxanes, among others. Altering this ratio can change the body&#x27;s metabolic and inflammatory state.

Metabolites of omega−6 are more inflammatory (esp. arachidonic acid) than those of omega−3. However, in terms of heart health, omega−6 fatty acids are less harmful than they are presumed to be. A meta-analysis of six randomized trials found that replacing saturated fat with omega−6 fats reduced the risk of coronary events by 24%.

A healthy ratio of omega−6 to omega−3 is needed; healthy ratios, according to some authors, range from 1:1 to 1:4. Other authors believe that a ratio of 4:1 (4 times as much omega−6 as omega−3) is already healthy.

Typical Western diets provide ratios of between 10:1 and 30:1 (i.e., dramatically higher levels of omega−6 than omega−3). The ratios of omega−6 to omega−3 fatty acids in some common vegetable oils are: canola 2:1, hemp 2–3:1, soybean 7:1, olive 3–13:1, sunflower (no omega−3), flax 1:3, cottonseed (almost no omega−3), peanut (no omega−3), grapeseed oil (almost no omega−3) and corn oil 46:1.

== Biochemistry ==

===Transporters===
DHA in the form of lysophosphatidylcholine is transported into the brain by a membrane transport protein, MFSD2A, which is exclusively expressed in the endothelium of the blood–brain barrier.

== Dietary sources ==
===Dietary recommendations===
In the United States, the Institute of Medicine publishes a system of Dietary Reference Intakes, which includes Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for individual nutrients, and Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges (AMDRs) for certain groups of nutrients, such as fats. When there is insufficient evidence to determine an RDA, the institute may publish an Adequate Intake (AI) instead, which has a similar meaning but is less certain. The AI for α-linolenic acid is 1.6 grams/day for men and 1.1 grams/day for women, while the AMDR is 0.6% to 1.2% of total energy. Because the physiological potency of EPA and DHA is much greater than that of ALA, it is not possible to estimate one AMDR for all omega−3 fatty acids. Approximately 10 percent of the AMDR can be consumed as EPA and/or DHA. The Institute of Medicine has not established a RDA or AI for EPA, DHA or the combination, so there is no Daily Value (DVs are derived from RDAs), no labeling of foods or supplements as providing a DV percentage of these fatty acids per serving, and no labeling a food or supplement as an excellent source, or &quot;High in...&quot; As for safety, there was insufficient evidence as of 2005 to set an upper tolerable limit for omega−3 fatty acids, although the FDA has advised that adults can safely consume up to a total of 3 grams per day of combined DHA and EPA, with no more than 2 g from dietary supplements.

The European Commission sponsored a working group to develop recommendations on dietary fat intake in pregnancy and lactation. In 2008, the working group published consensus recommendations, including the following:

* &quot;pregnant and lactating women should aim to achieve an average dietary intake of at least 200 mg DHA/day&quot;
* &quot;women of childbearing age should aim to consume one to two portions of sea fish per week, including oily fish&quot;
* &quot;intake of the DHA precursor, α-linolenic acid, is far less effective with regard to DHA deposition in fetal brain than preformed DHA&quot;
However, the seafood supply to meet these recommendations is currently too low in most European countries and if met would be unsustainable.

In the EU, the EFSA publishes the Dietary Reference Values (DRVs), recommending Adequate Intake values for EPA+DHA and DHA:
: AI, Adequate Intake
: i.e. the second half of the first year of life (from the beginning of the 7th month to the 1st birthday)
: in addition to combined intakes of EPA and DHA of 250 mg/day

The American Heart Association (AHA) has made recommendations for EPA and DHA due to their cardiovascular benefits: individuals with no history of coronary heart disease or myocardial infarction should consume oily fish two times per week; and &quot;Treatment is reasonable&quot; for those having been diagnosed with coronary heart disease. For the latter the AHA does not recommend a specific amount of EPA + DHA, although it notes that most trials were at or close to 1000 mg/day. The benefit appears to be on the order of a 9% decrease in relative risk. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) approved a claim &quot;EPA and DHA contributes to the normal function of the heart&quot; for products that contain at least 250 mg EPA + DHA. The report did not address the issue of people with pre-existing heart disease. The World Health Organization recommends regular fish consumption (1-2 servings per week, equivalent to 200 to 500 mg/day EPA + DHA) as protective against coronary heart disease and ischaemic stroke.

===Contamination===
Heavy metal poisoning from consuming fish oil supplements is highly unlikely, because heavy metals (mercury, lead, nickel, arsenic, and cadmium) selectively bind with protein in the fish flesh rather than accumulate in the oil.

However, other contaminants (PCBs, furans, dioxins, and PBDEs) might be found, especially in less-refined fish oil supplements.

Throughout their history, the Council for Responsible Nutrition and the World Health Organization have published acceptability standards regarding contaminants in fish oil. The most stringent current standard is the International Fish Oils Standard. Fish oils that are molecularly distilled under vacuum typically make this highest-grade; levels of contaminants are stated in parts per billion per trillion.

=== Rancidity ===
A 2022 study found that a number of products on the market used oxidised oils, with the rancidity often masked by flavourings. Another study in 2015 found that an average of 20% of products had excess oxidation. Whether rancid fish oil is harmful remains unclear. Some studies show that highly oxidised fish oil can have a negative impact on cholesterol levels. Animal testing showed that high doses have toxic effects. Furthermore, rancid oil is likely to be less effective than fresh fish oil.

===Fish===
The most widely available dietary source of EPA and DHA is oily fish, such as salmon, herring, mackerel, anchovies, and sardines. Oils from these fishes have around seven times as much omega−3 as omega−6. Other oily fish, such as tuna, also contain &quot;n&quot;−3 in somewhat lesser amounts. Although fish are a dietary source of omega−3 fatty acids, fish do not synthesize omega−3 fatty acids, but rather obtain them via their food supply, including algae or plankton.

In order for farmed marine fish to have amounts of EPA and DHA comparable to those of wild-caught fish, their feed must be supplemented with EPA and DHA, most commonly in the form of fish oil. For this reason, 81% of the global fish oil supply in 2009 was consumed by aquaculture. By 2019, two alternative sources of EPA and DHA for fish have been partially commercialized: genetically modified canola oil and &quot;Schizochytrium&quot; algal oil.

====Fish oil====
Marine and freshwater fish oil vary in content of arachidonic acid, EPA and DHA. They also differ in their effects on organ lipids.

Not all forms of fish oil may be equally digestible. Of four studies that compare bioavailability of the glyceryl ester form of fish oil vs. the ethyl ester form, two have concluded the natural glyceryl ester form is better, and the other two studies did not find a significant difference. No studies have shown the ethyl ester form to be superior, although it is cheaper to manufacture. 

===Krill===

Krill oil is a source of omega−3 fatty acids. The effect of krill oil, at a lower dose of EPA + DHA (62.8%), was demonstrated to be similar to that of fish oil on blood lipid levels and markers of inflammation in healthy humans. While not an endangered species, krill are a mainstay of the diets of many ocean-based species including whales, causing environmental and scientific concerns about their sustainability.
Preliminary studies indicate that the DHA and EPA omega−3 fatty acids found in krill oil are more bio-available than in fish oil. Additionally, krill oil contains astaxanthin, a marine-source keto-carotenoid antioxidant that may act synergistically with EPA and DHA.

===Plant sources===



Linseed (or flaxseed) (&quot;Linum usitatissimum&quot;) and its oil are perhaps the most widely available botanical source of the omega−3 fatty acid ALA. Flaxseed oil consists of approximately 55% ALA, which makes it six times richer than most fish oils in omega−3 fatty acids. A portion of this is converted by the body to EPA and DHA, though the actual converted percentage may differ between men and women.

The longer-chain EPA and DHA are only naturally made by marine algae and phytoplankton. The microalgae &quot;Crypthecodinium cohnii&quot; and &quot;Schizochytrium&quot; are rich sources of DHA, but not EPA, and can be produced commercially in bioreactors for use as food additives. Oil from brown algae (kelp) is a source of EPA. The alga &quot;Nannochloropsis&quot; also has high levels of EPA.

Some transgenic initiatives have transferred the ability to make EPA and DHA into existing high-yielding crop species of land plants:
* &quot;Camelina sativa&quot;: In 2013, Rothamsted Research reported two genetically modified forms of this plant. Oil from the seeds of this plant contained on average 15% ALA, 11% EPA, and 8% DHA in one development and 11% ALA and 24% EPA in another.
* Canola: In 2011, CSIRO, GRDC, and Nufarm developed a version of canola that produces DHA in seeds; the oil contains 10% DHA and almost no EPA. In 2018, it was approved as an animal feed additive in Australia. In 2021, the US FDA acknowledged it as a New Dietary Ingredient for humans. Separately, Cargill has commercialized a different strain of canola that produces EPA and DHA for fish feed. The oil contains 8.1% EPA and 0.8% DHA.

===Eggs===
Eggs produced by hens fed a diet of greens and insects contain higher levels of omega−3 fatty acids than those produced by chickens fed corn or soybeans. In addition to feeding chickens insects and greens, fish oils may be added to their diets to increase the omega−3 fatty acid concentrations in eggs.

The addition of flax and canola seeds, both good sources of alpha-linolenic acid, to the diets of laying chickens, increases the omega−3 content of the eggs, predominantly DHA. However, this enrichment could lead to an increment of lipid oxidation in the eggs if the seeds are used in higher doses, without using an appropriate antioxidant.

The addition of green algae or seaweed to the diets boosts the content of DHA and EPA, which are the forms of omega−3 approved by the FDA for medical claims. A common consumer complaint is &quot;Omega−3 eggs can sometimes have a fishy taste if the hens are fed marine oils&quot;.

===Meat===
Omega−3 fatty acids are formed in the chloroplasts of green leaves and algae. While seaweeds and algae are the sources of omega−3 fatty acids present in fish, grass is the source of omega−3 fatty acids present in grass-fed animals. When cattle are taken off omega−3 fatty acid-rich grass and shipped to a feedlot to be fattened on omega−3 fatty acid deficient grain, they begin losing their store of this beneficial fat. Each day that an animal spends in the feedlot, the amount of omega−3 fatty acids in its meat is diminished.

The omega−6:omega−3 ratio of grass-fed beef is about 2:1, making it a more useful source of omega−3 than grain-fed beef, which usually has a ratio of 4:1.

In a 2009 joint study by the USDA and researchers at Clemson University in South Carolina, grass-fed beef was compared with grain-finished beef. The researchers found that grass-finished beef is higher in moisture content, 42.5% lower total lipid content, 54% lower in total fatty acids, 54% higher in beta-carotene, 288% higher in vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol), higher in the B-vitamins thiamin and riboflavin, higher in the minerals calcium, magnesium, and potassium, 193% higher in total omega−3s, 117% higher in CLA (cis-9, trans-11 octadecenoic acid, a conjugated linoleic acid, which is a potential cancer fighter), 90% higher in vaccenic acid (which can be transformed into CLA), lower in the saturated fats, and has a healthier ratio of omega−6 to omega−3 fatty acids (1.65 vs 4.84). Protein and cholesterol content were equal.

The omega−3 content of chicken meat may be enhanced by increasing the animals&#x27; dietary intake of grains high in omega−3, such as flax, chia, and canola.

Kangaroo meat is also a source of omega−3, with fillet and steak containing 74 mg per 100 g of raw meat.

===Seal oil===
Seal oil is a source of EPA, DPA, and DHA, and is commonly used in Arctic regions. According to Health Canada, it helps to support the development of the brain, eyes, and nerves in children up to 12 years of age. Like all seal products, it is not allowed to be imported into the European Union.

A Canadian company, FeelGood Natural Health, pleaded guilty in 2023 to illegally selling seal oil capsules to American consumers. The company sold over 900 bottles of the capsules, worth over $10,000. Seal oil is made from the blubber of dead seals, and is illegal to sell in the United States under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. The global population of harp seals stands at around 7 million, and they have been hunted in Canada for thousands of years. FeelGood was sentenced to pay a fine of $20,000 and three years of probation.

===Other sources===
A trend in the early 21st century was to fortify food with omega−3 fatty acids.

==Health effects of omega−3 supplementation==
The association between supplementation and a lower risk of all-cause mortality is inconclusive.

===Cancer===
There is insufficient evidence that supplementation with omega−3 fatty acids has an effect on different cancers. Omega−3 supplements do not improve body weight, muscle maintenance or quality of life in cancer patients.

===Cardiovascular disease===
Moderate and high quality evidence from a 2020 review showed that EPA and DHA, such as that found in omega−3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplements, does not appear to improve mortality or cardiovascular health. There is weak evidence indicating that α-linolenic acid may be associated with a small reduction in the risk of a cardiovascular event or the risk of arrhythmia.

A 2018 meta-analysis found no support that daily intake of one gram of omega−3 fatty acid in individuals with a history of coronary heart disease prevents fatal coronary heart disease, nonfatal myocardial infarction or any other vascular event. However, omega−3 fatty acid supplementation greater than one gram daily for at least a year may be protective against cardiac death, sudden death, and myocardial infarction in people who have a history of cardiovascular disease. No protective effect against the development of stroke or all-cause mortality was seen in this population. A 2021 meta-analysis found that supplementation was associated with a reduced risk of myocardial infarction and coronary heart disease.

Fish oil supplementation has not been shown to benefit revascularization or abnormal heart rhythms and has no effect on heart failure hospital admission rates. Furthermore, fish oil supplement studies have failed to support claims of preventing heart attacks or strokes. In the EU, a review by the European Medicines Agency of omega−3 fatty acid medicines containing a combination of an ethyl ester of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid at a dose of 1 g per day concluded that these medicines are not effective in secondary prevention of heart problems in people who have had a myocardial infarction.

Evidence suggests that omega−3 fatty acids modestly lower blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) in people with hypertension and in people with normal blood pressure. Omega−3 fatty acids can also reduce heart rate, an emerging risk factor. Some evidence suggests that people with certain circulatory problems, such as varicose veins, may benefit from the consumption of EPA and DHA, which may stimulate blood circulation and increase the breakdown of fibrin, a protein involved in blood clotting and scar formation.
Omega−3 fatty acids reduce blood triglyceride levels, but do not significantly change the level of LDL cholesterol or HDL cholesterol. The American Heart Association position (2011) is that borderline elevated triglycerides, defined as 150–199 mg/dL, can be lowered by 0.5–1.0 grams of EPA and DHA per day; high triglycerides 200–499 mg/dL benefit from 1–2 g/day; and &gt;500 mg/dL be treated under a physician&#x27;s supervision with 2–4 g/day using a prescription product. In this population, omega−3 fatty acid supplementation decreases the risk of heart disease by about 25%.

A 2019 review found that omega−3 fatty acid supplements make little or no difference to cardiovascular mortality and that people with myocardial infarction have no benefit in taking the supplements. A 2021 review found that omega−3 supplementation did not affect cardiovascular disease outcomes.

A 2021 review concluded that use of omega−3 supplements was associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation in people having high blood triglycerides. A meta-analysis showed that use of marine omega−3 supplementation was associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation, with the risk appearing to increase for doses greater than one gram per day.

===Chronic kidney disease===
In people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who require hemodialysis, vascular blockage due to clotting may prevent dialysis therapy. Omega−3 fatty acids contribute to the production of eicosanoid molecules that reduce clotting. However, a Cochrane review in 2018 did not find clear evidence that omega−3 supplementation has any impact on the prevention of vascular blockage in people with CKD. There was also moderate certainty that supplementation did not prevent hospitalisation or death within a 12-month period.

===Stroke===
A 2022 Cochrane review of controlled trials did not find clear evidence that marine-derived omega−3 supplementation improves cognitive and physical recovery or social, and emotional wellbeing following stroke diagnosis, nor prevents stroke recurrence and mortality. In this review, mood appeared to worsen slightly among those receiving 3g fish oil supplementation for 12 weeks; psychometric scores changed by 1.41 (0.07 to 2.75) points less than those receiving palm and soy oil. However, this represented only a single small study and was not observed in a study lasting more than 3 months. Overall, the review was limited by the small amount of high-quality evidence available.

===Inflammation===
A 2013 systematic review found tentative evidence of benefit for lowering inflammation levels in healthy adults and in people with one or more biomarkers of metabolic syndrome. Consumption of omega−3 fatty acids from marine sources lowers blood markers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, and TNF alpha.

For rheumatoid arthritis, one systematic review found consistent but modest evidence for the effect of marine n−3 PUFAs on symptoms such as &quot;joint swelling and pain, duration of morning stiffness, global assessments of pain and disease activity&quot; as well as the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The American College of Rheumatology has stated that there may be modest benefit from the use of fish oils, but that it may take months for effects to be seen, and cautions for possible gastrointestinal side effects and the possibility of the supplements containing mercury or vitamin A at toxic levels. The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health has concluded that &quot;supplements containing omega−3 fatty acids... may help relieve rheumatoid arthritis symptoms&quot; but warns that such supplements &quot;may interact with drugs that affect blood clotting&quot;.

===Developmental disabilities===
One meta-analysis concluded that omega−3 fatty acid supplementation demonstrated a modest effect for improving ADHD symptoms. A Cochrane review of PUFA (not necessarily omega−3) supplementation found &quot;there is little evidence that PUFA supplementation provides any benefit for the symptoms of ADHD in children and adolescents&quot;, while a different review found &quot;insufficient evidence to draw any conclusion about the use of PUFAs for children with specific learning disorders&quot;. Another review concluded that the evidence is inconclusive for the use of omega−3 fatty acids in behavior and non-neurodegenerative neuropsychiatric disorders such as ADHD and depression.

A 2015 meta-analysis of the effect of omega−3 supplementation during pregnancy did not demonstrate a decrease in the rate of preterm birth or improve outcomes in women with singleton pregnancies with no prior preterm births. A 2018 Cochrane systematic review with moderate to high quality of evidence suggested that omega−3 fatty acids may reduce risk of perinatal death, risk of low body weight babies; and possibly mildly increased LGA babies.

A 2021 umbrella review with moderate to high quality of evidence suggested that &quot;omega-3 supplementation during pregnancy can exert favorable effects against pre-eclampsia, low-birth weight, pre-term delivery, and post-partum depression, and can improve anthropometric measures, immune system, and visual activity in infants and cardiometabolic risk factors in pregnant mothers.&quot;

===Mental health===
Omega−3 supplementation has not been shown to significantly affect symptoms of anxiety, major depressive disorder or schizophrenia. A 2021 Cochrane review concluded that there is not &quot;sufficient high‐certainty evidence to determine the effects of n‐3PUFAs as a treatment for MDD&quot;. Omega−3 fatty acids have also been investigated as an add-on for the treatment of depression associated with bipolar disorder although there is limited data available. Two reviews have suggested that omega−3 fatty acid supplementation significantly improves depressive symptoms in perinatal women.

A 2015 study concluded that there are multiple factors responsible for depression and deficiency of omega−3 fatty acids can be one of them. It further stated that only those patients who have depression due to insufficient omega−3 fatty acids can respond well to the omega−3 supplements while others are unlikely to get any positive effects. Meta-analysis suggest that supplements with higher concentration of EPA than DHA are more likely to act as anti-depressants.

In contrast to dietary supplementation studies, there is significant difficulty in interpreting the literature regarding dietary intake of omega−3 fatty acids (e.g. from fish) due to participant recall and systematic differences in diets. There is also controversy as to the efficacy of omega−3, with many meta-analysis papers finding heterogeneity among results which can be explained mostly by publication bias. A significant correlation between shorter treatment trials was associated with increased omega−3 efficacy for treating depressed symptoms further implicating bias in publication.

===Cognitive aging===
A 2016 Cochrane review found no convincing evidence for the use of omega‐3 PUFA supplements in treatment of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease or dementia. There is preliminary evidence of effect on mild cognitive problems, but none supporting an effect in healthy people or those with dementia. A 2020 review suggested that omega−3 supplementation has no effect on global cognitive function but has a mild benefit in improving memory in non-demented adults.

A 2022 review found promising evidence for prevention of cognitive decline in people who regularly eat long-chain omega−3 rich foods. Conversely, clinical trials with participants already diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s show no effect. A 2020 review concluded that long-chain omega−3 supplements do not deter cognitive decline in older adults.

===Brain and visual functions===
Brain function and vision rely on dietary intake of DHA to support a broad range of cell membrane properties, particularly in grey matter, which is rich in membranes. A major structural component of the mammalian brain, DHA is the most abundant omega−3 fatty acid in the brain. Omega−3 PUFA supplementation has no effect on macular degeneration or development of visual loss.

===Atopic diseases===
Results of studies investigating the role of LCPUFA supplementation and LCPUFA status in the prevention and therapy of atopic diseases (allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, atopic dermatitis, and allergic asthma) are controversial; therefore, it could not be stated either that the nutritional intake of n−3 fatty acids has a clear preventive or therapeutic role, or that the intake of n-6 fatty acids has a promoting role in the context of atopic diseases.

=== Phenylketonuria ===
People with PKU often have low intake of omega−3 fatty acids, because nutrients rich in omega−3 fatty acids are excluded from their diet due to high protein content.

===Asthma===
As of 2015, there was no evidence that taking omega−3 supplements can prevent asthma attacks in children.

===Diabetes===
A 2019 review found that omega−3 supplements have no effect on prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes. A 2021 meta-analysis found that supplementation with omega−3 had positive effects on diabetes biomarkers, such as fasting blood glucose and insulin resistance.

===Sexual health===
A 2017 animal study examined the effects of omega−3 supplement on BPF-induced erectile dysfunction. Rats in the treatment group were found to have significantly improved erection quality.

<text>Ore is natural rock or sediment that contains one or more valuable minerals, typically including metals, concentrated above background levels, and that is economically viable to mine and process. The grade of ore refers to the concentration of the desired material it contains. The value of the metals or minerals a rock contains must be weighed against the cost of extraction to determine whether it is of sufficiently high grade to be worth mining and is therefore considered an ore. A complex ore is one containing more than one valuable mineral.

Minerals of interest are generally oxides, sulfides, silicates, or native metals such as copper or gold. Ore bodies are formed by a variety of geological processes generally referred to as ore genesis and can be classified based on their deposit type. Ore is extracted from the earth through mining and treated or refined, often via smelting, to extract the valuable metals or minerals. Some ores, depending on their composition, may pose threats to health or surrounding ecosystems.

The word ore is of Anglo-Saxon origin, meaning &quot;lump of metal&quot;.

== Gangue and tailings ==
In most cases, an ore does not consist entirely of a single mineral, but it is mixed with other valuable minerals and with unwanted or valueless rocks and minerals. The part of an ore that is not economically desirable and that cannot be avoided in mining is known as gangue. The valuable ore minerals are separated from the gangue minerals by froth flotation, gravity concentration, electric or magnetic methods, and other operations known collectively as mineral processing or ore dressing.

Mineral processing consists of first liberation, to free the ore from the gangue, and concentration to separate the desired mineral(s) from it. Once processed, the gangue is known as tailings, which are useless but potentially harmful materials produced in great quantity, especially from lower grade deposits.

== Ore deposits ==
An ore deposit is an economically significant accumulation of minerals within a host rock. This is distinct from a mineral resource in that it is a mineral deposit occurring in high enough concentration to be economically viable. An ore deposit is one occurrence of a particular ore type. Most ore deposits are named according to their location, or after a discoverer (e.g. the Kambalda nickel shoots are named after drillers), or after some whimsy, a historical figure, a prominent person, a city or town from which the owner came, something from mythology (such as the name of a god or goddess) or the code name of the resource company which found it (e.g. MKD-5 was the in-house name for the Mount Keith nickel sulphide deposit).

=== Classification ===
Ore deposits are classified according to various criteria developed via the study of economic geology, or ore genesis. The following is a general categorization of the main ore deposit types:

=== Magmatic deposits ===

Magmatic deposits are ones who originate directly from magma
* Pegmatites are very coarse grained, igneous rocks. They crystallize slowly at great depth beneath the surface, leading to their very large crystal sizes. Most are of granitic composition. They are a large source of industrial minerals such as quartz, feldspar, spodumene, petalite, and rare lithophile elements.
* Carbonatites are an igneous rock whose volume is made up of over 50% carbonate minerals. They are produced from mantle derived magmas, typically at continental rift zones. They contain more rare earth elements than any other igneous rock, and as such are a major source of light rare earth elements.
* Magmatic Sulfide Deposits form from mantle melts which rise upwards, and gain sulfur through interaction with the crust. This causes the sulfide minerals present to be immiscible, precipitating out when the melt crystallizes. Magmatic sulfide deposits can be subdivided into two groups by their dominant ore element:
** Ni-Cu, found in komatiites, anorthosite complexes, and flood basalts. This also includes the Sudbury Nickel Basin, the only known astrobleme source of such ore.
** Platinum Group Elements (PGE) from large mafic intrusions and tholeiitic rock.
* Stratiform Chromites are strongly linked to PGE magmatic sulfide deposits. These highly mafic intrusions are a source of chromite, the only chromium ore. They are so named due to their strata-like shape and formation via layered magmatic injection into the host rock. Chromium is usually located within the bottom of the intrusion. They are typically found within intrusions in continental cratons, the most famous example being the Bushveld Complex in South Africa.
* Podiform Chromitites are found in ultramafic oceanic rocks resulting from complex magma mixing. They are hosted in serpentine and dunite rich layers and are another source of chromite.
* Kimberlites are a primary source for diamonds. They originate from depths of 150 km in the mantle and are mostly composed of crustal xenocrysts, high amounts of magnesium, other trace elements, gases, and in some cases diamond.
=== Metamorphic deposits ===
These are ore deposits which form as a direct result of metamorphism.
* Skarns occur in numerous geologic settings worldwide. They are silicates derived from the recrystallization of carbonates like limestone through contact or regional metamorphism, or fluid related metasomatic events. Not all are economic, but those with potential value are classified depending on the dominant element such as Ca, Fe, Mg, or Mn among many others. They are one of the most diverse and abundant mineral deposits. As such they are classified solely by their common mineralogy, mainly garnets and pyroxenes.
* Greisens, like skarns, are a metamorphosed silicate, quartz-mica mineral deposit. Formed from a granitic protolith due to alteration by intruding magmas, they are large ore sources of tin and tungsten in the form of wolframite, cassiterite, stannite and scheelite.

=== Porphyry copper deposits ===

These are the leading source of copper ore. Porphyry copper deposits form along convergent boundaries and are thought to originate from the partial melting of subducted oceanic plates and subsequent concentration of Cu, driven by oxidation. These are large, round, disseminated deposits containing on average 0.8% copper by weight.

Hydrothermal Hydrothermal deposits are a large source of ore. They form as a result of the precipitation of dissolved ore constituents out of fluids.
* Mississippi Valley-Type (MVT) deposits precipitate from relatively cool, basal brinal fluids within carbonate strata. These are sources of lead and zinc sulphide ore.
* Sediment-Hosted Stratiform Copper Deposits (SSC) form when copper sulphides precipitate out of brinal fluids into sedimentary basins near the equator. These are the second most common source of copper ore after porphyry copper deposits, supplying 20% of the worlds copper in addition to silver and cobalt.
* Volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) deposits form on the seafloor from precipitation of metal rich solutions, typically associated with hydrothermal activity. They take the general form of a large sulphide rich mound above disseminated sulphides and viens. VMS deposits are a major source of zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), silver (Ag), and gold (Au).
* Sedimentary exhalative sulphide deposits (SEDEX) are a copper sulphide ore which form in the same manor as VMS from metal rich brine but are hosted within sedimentary rocks and are not directly related to volcanism.
* Orogenic gold deposits are a bulk source for gold, with 75% of gold production originating from orogenic gold deposits. Formation occurs during late stage mountain building (&quot;see orogeny&quot;) where metamorphism forces gold containing fluids into joints and fractures where they precipitate. These tend to be strongly correlated with quartz veins.
* Epithermal vein deposits form in the shallow crust from concentration of metal bearing fluids into veins and stockworks where conditions favour precipitation. These volcanic related deposits are a source of gold and silver ore, the primary precipitants.

=== Sedimentary deposits ===
Laterites form from the weathering of highly mafic rock near the equator. They can form in as little as one million years and are a source of iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), and aluminum (Al). They may also be a source of nickel and cobalt when the parent rock is enriched in these elements.

Banded iron formations (BIFs) are the highest concentration of any single metal available. They are composed of chert beds alternating between high and low iron concentrations. Their deposition occurred early in Earth&#x27;s history when the atmospheric composition was significantly different from today. Iron rich water is thought to have upwelled where it oxidized to Fe (III) in the presence of early photosynthetic plankton producing oxygen. This iron then precipitated out and deposited on the ocean floor. The banding is thought to be a result of changing plankton population.

Sediment Hosted Copper forms from the precipitation of a copper rich oxidized brine into sedimentary rocks. These are a source of copper primarily in the form of copper-sulfide minerals.

Placer deposits are the result of weathering, transport, and subsequent concentration of a valuable mineral via water or wind. They are typically sources of gold (Au), platinum group elements (PGE), sulfide minerals, tin (Sn), tungsten (W), and rare-earth elements (REEs). A placer deposit is considered alluvial if formed via river, colluvial if by gravity, and eluvial when close to their parent rock.

=== Manganese nodules ===
Polymetallic nodules, also called manganese nodules, are mineral concretions on the sea floor formed of concentric layers of iron and manganese hydroxides around a core. They are formed by a combination of diagenetic and sedimentary precipitation at the estimated rate of about a centimeter over several million years. The average diameter of a polymetallic nodule is between 3 and 10 cm (1 and 4 in) in diameter and are characterized by enrichment in iron, manganese, heavy metals, and rare earth element content when compared to the Earth&#x27;s crust and surrounding sediment. The proposed mining of these nodules via remotely operated ocean floor trawling robots has raised a number of ecological concerns.

== Extraction ==


The extraction of ore deposits generally follows these steps. Progression from stages 1–3 will see a continuous disqualification of potential ore bodies as more information is obtained on their viability:

# Prospecting to find where an ore is located. The prospecting stage generally involves mapping, geophysical survey techniques (aerial and/or ground-based surveys), geochemical sampling, and preliminary drilling.
# After a deposit is discovered, exploration is conducted to define its extent and value via further mapping and sampling techniques such as targeted diamond drilling to intersect the potential ore body. This exploration stage determines ore grade, tonnage, and if the deposit is a viable economic resource.
# A feasibility study then considers the theoretical implications of the potential mining operation in order to determine if it should move ahead with development. This includes evaluating the economically recoverable portion of the deposit, marketability and payability of the ore concentrates, engineering, milling and infrastructure costs, finance and equity requirements, potential environmental impacts, political implications, and a cradle to grave analysis from the initial excavation all the way through to reclamation. Multiple experts from differing fields must then approve the study before the project can move on to the next stage. Depending on the size of the project, a pre-feasibility study is sometimes first performed to decide preliminary potential and if a much costlier full feasibility study is even warranted.
# Development begins once an ore body has been confirmed economically viable and involves steps to prepare for its extraction such as building of a mine plant and equipment.
# Production can then begin and is the operation of the mine in an active sense. The time a mine is active is dependent on its remaining reserves and profitability. The extraction method used is entirely dependent on the deposit type, geometry, and surrounding geology. Methods can be generally categorized into surface mining such as open pit or strip mining, and underground mining such as block caving, cut and fill, and stoping.
# Reclamation, once the mine is no longer operational, makes the land where a mine had been suitable for future use.

With rates of ore discovery in a steady decline since the mid 20th century, it is thought that most surface level, easily accessible sources have been exhausted. This means progressively lower grade deposits must be turned to, and new methods of extraction must be developed.

== Hazards ==

Some ores contain heavy metals, toxins, radioactive isotopes and other potentially negative compounds which may pose a risk to the environment or health. The exact effects an ore and its tailings have is dependent on the minerals present. Tailings of particular concern are those of older mines, as containment and remediation methods in the past were next to non-existent, leading to high levels of leaching into the surrounding environment. Mercury and arsenic are two ore related elements of particular concern. Additional elements found in ore which may have adverse health affects in organisms include iron, lead, uranium, zinc, silicon, titanium, sulfur, nitrogen, platinum, and chromium. Exposure to these elements may result in respiratory and cardiovascular problems and neurological issues. These are of particular danger to aquatic life if dissolved in water. Ores such as those of sulphide minerals may severely increase the acidity of their immediate surroundings and of water, with numerous, long lasting impacts on ecosystems. When water becomes contaminated it may transport these compounds far from the tailings site, greatly increasing the affected range.

Uranium ores and those containing other radioactive elements may pose a significant threat if leaving occurs and isotope concentration increases above background levels. Radiation can have severe, long lasting environmental impacts and cause irreversible damage to living organisms.

== History ==

Metallurgy began with the direct working of native metals such as gold, lead and copper. Placer deposits, for example, would have been the first source of native gold. The first exploited ores were copper oxides such as malachite and azurite, over 7000 years ago at Çatalhöyük . These were the easiest to work, with relatively limited mining and basic requirements for smelting. It is believed they were once much more abundant on the surface than today. After this, copper sulphides would have been turned to as oxide resources depleted and the Bronze Age progressed. Lead production from galena smelting may have been occurring at this time as well.

The smelting of arsenic-copper sulphides would have produced the first bronze alloys. The majority of bronze creation however required tin, and thus the exploitation of cassiterite, the main tin source, began. Some 3000 years ago, the smelting of iron ores began in Mesopotamia. Iron oxide is quite abundant on the surface and forms from a variety of processes.

Until the 18th century gold, copper, lead, iron, silver, tin, arsenic and mercury were the only metals mined and used. In recent decades, Rare Earth Elements have been increasingly exploited for various high-tech applications. This has led to an ever-growing search for REE ore and novel ways of extracting said elements.

== Trade ==
Ores (metals) are traded internationally and comprise a sizeable portion of international trade in raw materials both in value and volume. This is because the worldwide distribution of ores is unequal and dislocated from locations of peak demand and from smelting infrastructure.

Most base metals (copper, lead, zinc, nickel) are traded internationally on the London Metal Exchange, with smaller stockpiles and metals exchanges monitored by the COMEX and NYMEX exchanges in the United States and the Shanghai Futures Exchange in China. The global Chromium market is currently dominated by the United States and China.

Iron ore is traded between customer and producer, though various benchmark prices are set quarterly between the major mining conglomerates and the major consumers, and this sets the stage for smaller participants.

Other, lesser, commodities do not have international clearing houses and benchmark prices, with most prices negotiated between suppliers and customers one-on-one. This generally makes determining the price of ores of this nature opaque and difficult. Such metals include lithium, niobium-tantalum, bismuth, antimony and rare earths. Most of these commodities are also dominated by one or two major suppliers with &gt;60% of the world&#x27;s reserves. China is currently leading in world production of Rare Earth Elements.

The World Bank reports that China was the top importer of ores and metals in 2005 followed by the US and Japan.

<text>Optical brighteners, optical brightening agents (OBAs), fluorescent brightening agents (FBAs), or fluorescent whitening agents (FWAs), are chemical compounds that absorb light in the ultraviolet and violet region (usually 340-370 nm) of the electromagnetic spectrum, and re-emit light in the blue region (typically 420-470 nm) through the phenomenon of fluorescence. These additives are often used to enhance the appearance of color of fabric and paper, causing a &quot;whitening&quot; effect; they make intrinsically yellow/orange materials look less so, by compensating the deficit in blue and purple light reflected by the material, with the blue and purple optical emission of the fluorophore.

==Properties==
The most common classes of compounds with this property are the stilbenes, e.g., 4,4′-diamino-2,2′-stilbenedisulfonic acid. Older, non-commercial fluorescent compounds include umbelliferone, which absorbs in the UV portion of the spectrum and re-emit it in the blue portion of the visible spectrum. A white surface treated with an optical brightener can emit more visible light than that which shines on it, making it appear brighter. The blue light emitted by the brightener compensates for the diminishing blue of the treated material and changes the hue away from yellow or brown and toward white.


Approximately 400 brightener types are listed in the international Colour Index database, but fewer than 90 are produced commercially, and only a handful are commercially important. The Colour Index Generic Names and Constitution Numbers can be assigned to a specific substance. However, some are duplicated, since manufacturers apply for the index number when they produce it. The global OBA production for paper, textiles, and detergents is dominated by just a few di- and tetra-sulfonated triazole-stilbenes and a di-sulfonated stilbene-biphenyl derivatives. The stilbene derivatives are subject to fading upon prolonged exposure to UV, due to the formation of optically inactive cis-stilbenes. They are also degraded by oxygen in air, like most dye colorants. All brighteners have extended conjugation and/or aromaticity, allowing for electron movement. Some non-stilbene brighteners are used in more permanent applications such as whitening synthetic fiber.

Brighteners can be &quot;boosted&quot; by the addition of certain polyols, such as high molecular weight polyethylene glycol or polyvinyl alcohol. These additives increase the visible blue light emissions significantly. Brighteners can also be &quot;quenched&quot;. Excess brightener will often cause a greening effect as emissions start to show above the blue region in the visible spectrum.

==Common uses==
Brighteners are commonly added to laundry detergents to make the clothes appear cleaner. Normally cleaned laundry appears yellowish, which consumers do not like. Optical brighteners have replaced bluing which was formerly used to produce the same effect.

Brighteners are used in many papers, especially high brightness papers, resulting in their strongly fluorescent appearance under UV illumination. Paper brightness is typically measured at 457 nm, well within the fluorescent activity range of brighteners. Paper used for banknotes does not contain optical brighteners, so a common method for detecting counterfeit notes is to check for fluorescence.

Optical brighteners have also found use in cosmetics. One application is to formulas for washing and conditioning grey or blonde hair, where the brightener can not only increase the luminance and sparkle of the hair, but can also correct dull, yellowish discoloration without darkening the hair. Some advanced face and eye powders contain optical brightener microspheres that brighten shadowed or dark areas of the skin, such as &quot;tired eyes&quot;.

End uses of optical brighteners include:
# Detergent whitener (instead of bluing agents)
# Paper brightening (internal or in a coating)
# Fiber whitening (internal, added to polymer melts)
# Textile whitening (external, added to fabric finishes)
# Color-correcting or brightening additive in advanced cosmetic formulas (shampoos, conditioners, eye makeup)

==Misuse==
From around 2002 to 2012, chemical brighteners were used by many Chinese farmers to enhance the appearance of their white mushrooms. This illegal use was mostly eliminated by the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture.

<text>Oil painting is a painting method involving the procedure of painting with pigments combined with a drying oil as the binder. It has been the most common technique for artistic painting on canvas, wood panel or copper for several centuries. The advantages of oil for painting images include &quot;greater flexibility, richer and denser color, the use of layers, and a wider range from light to dark&quot;. 

The oldest known oil paintings were created by Buddhist artists in Afghanistan, and date back to the 7th century AD. Oil paint was later adopted by Europeans for painting statues and woodwork from at least the 12th century, but its common use for painted images began with Early Netherlandish painting in Northern Europe, and by the height of the Renaissance, oil painting techniques had almost completely replaced the use of egg tempera paints for panel paintings in most of Europe, though not for Orthodox icons or wall paintings, where tempera and fresco, respectively, remained the usual choice.

Commonly used drying oils include linseed oil, poppy seed oil, walnut oil, and safflower oil. The choice of oil imparts a range of properties to the paint, such as the amount of yellowing or drying time. The paint could be thinned with turpentine. Certain differences, depending on the oil, are also visible in the sheen of the paints. An artist might use several different oils in the same painting depending on specific pigments and effects desired. The paints themselves also develop a particular consistency depending on the medium. The oil may be boiled with a resin, such as pine resin or frankincense, to create a varnish to provide protection and texture. The paint itself can be molded into different textures depending on its plasticity.

==Techniques==
Traditional oil painting techniques often begin with the artist sketching the subject onto the canvas with charcoal or thinned paint. Oil paint is usually mixed with linseed oil, artist grade mineral spirits, or other solvents to make the paint thinner, faster or slower drying. (Because the solvents thin the oil in the paint, they can also be used to clean paint brushes.) A basic rule of oil paint application is &#x27;fat over lean&#x27;, meaning that each additional layer of paint should contain more oil than the layer below to allow proper drying. If each additional layer contains less oil, the final painting will crack and peel. The consistency on the canvas depends on the layering of the oil paint. This rule does not ensure permanence; it is the quality and type of oil that leads to a strong and stable paint film.

Other media can be used with the oil, including cold wax, resins, and varnishes. These additional media can aid the painter in adjusting the translucency of the paint, the sheen of the paint, the density or &#x27;body&#x27; of the paint, and the ability of the paint to hold or conceal the brushstroke. These aspects of the paint are closely related to the expressive capacity of oil paint.

Traditionally, paint was most often transferred to the painting surface using paintbrushes, but there are other methods, including using palette knives and rags. Palette knives can scrape off any paint from a canvas and can also be used for application. Oil paint remains wet longer than many other types of artists&#x27; materials, enabling the artist to change the color, texture, or form of the figure. At times, the painter might even remove an entire layer of paint and begin anew. This can be done with a rag and some turpentine for a time while the paint is wet, but after a while the hardened layer must be scraped off. Oil paint dries by oxidation, not evaporation, and is usually dry to the touch within two weeks (some colors dry within days).

== History ==
The earliest known surviving oil paintings are Buddhist murals created in Bamiyan, Afghanistan. Bamiyan is a historic settlement along the Silk Road and is famous for the Bamiyan Buddhas, a series of giant statues, behind which rooms and tunnels are carved from the rock. The murals are located in these rooms. The artworks display a wide range of pigments and ingredients and even include the use of a final varnish layer. The application technique and refined level of the paint media used in the murals and their survival into the present day suggest that oil paints had been used in Asia for some time before the 7th century. The technique used, of binding pigments in oil, was unknown in Europe for another 900 years or so. In Northern Europe, practitioners of Early Netherlandish painting developed oil painting techniques which other Europeans adopted from around the late 15th century. From the Renaissance on, oil painting technology had almost completely replaced the earlier use of tempera paints in the majority of Europe.

Most European Renaissance sources, in particular Vasari, falsely credit northern European painters of the 15th century, and Jan van Eyck in particular, with the invention of oil paints. However, Theophilus Presbyter (a pseudonymous author who is sometimes identified as Roger of Helmarshausen) gives instructions for oil-based painting in his treatise, (&#x27;on various arts&#x27;), written about 1125. At this period, it was probably used for painting sculptures, carvings, and wood fittings, perhaps especially for outdoor use. Surfaces exposed to the weather or of items like shields—both those used in tournaments and those hung as decorations—were more durable when painted in oil-based media than when painted in traditional tempera paints. However, early Netherlandish paintings with artists like Van Eyck and Robert Campin in the early and mid-15th century were the first to make oil the usual painting medium and explore the use of layers and glazes, followed by the rest of Northern Europe, and then Italy.

Such works were painted on wooden panels, but towards the end of the 15th century canvas began to be used as a support, as it was cheaper, easier to transport, allowed larger works, and did not require complicated preliminary layers of gesso (a fine type of plaster). Venice, where sail-canvas was easily available, was a leader in the move to canvas. Small cabinet paintings were also made on metal, especially copper plates. These supports were more expensive but very firm, allowing intricately fine detail. Often printing plates from printmaking were reused for this purpose. The increasing use of oil spread through Italy from Northern Europe, starting in Venice in the late 15th century. By 1540, the previous method for painting on panel (tempera) had become all but extinct, although Italians continued to use chalk-based fresco for wall paintings, which was less successful and durable in damper northern climates.

Renaissance techniques used several thin almost transparent layers or glazes, usually each allowed to dry before the next was added, greatly increasing the time a painting took. The underpainting or ground beneath these was usually white (typically gesso coated with a primer), allowing light to reflect through the layers. But van Eyck, and Robert Campin a little later, used a wet-on-wet technique in places, painting a second layer soon after the first. Initially, the aim was, as with the established techniques of tempera and fresco, to produce a smooth surface when no attention was drawn to the brushstrokes or texture of the painted surface. Among the earliest impasto effects, using a raised or rough texture in the surface of the paint, are those from the later works of the Venetian painter Giovanni Bellini, around 1500.

This became much more common in the 16th century, as many painters began to draw attention to the process of their painting, by leaving individual brushstrokes obvious, and a rough painted surface. Another Venetian, Titian, was a leader in this. In the 17th century some artists, including Rembrandt, began to use dark grounds. Until the mid-19th century, there was a division between artists who exploited &quot;effects of handling&quot; in their paintwork, and those who continued to aim at &quot;an even, glassy surface from which all evidences of manipulation had been banished&quot;.

Before the 19th century, artists or their apprentices ground pigments and mixed their paints for the range of painting media. This made portability difficult and kept most painting activities confined to the studio. This changed when tubes of oil paint became widely available following the American portrait painter John Goffe Rand&#x27;s invention of the squeezable or collapsible metal tube in 1841. Artists could mix colors quickly and easily, which enabled, for the first time, relatively convenient plein air painting (a common approach in French Impressionism)

==Ingredients==

The linseed oil itself comes from the flax seed, a common fiber crop. Linen, a &quot;support&quot; for oil painting (see relevant section), also comes from the flax plant. Safflower oil or the walnut or poppyseed oil or Castor Oil are sometimes used in formulating lighter colors like white because they &quot;yellow&quot; less on drying than linseed oil, but they have the slight drawback of drying more slowly and may not provide the strongest paint film. Linseed oil tends to dry yellow and can change the hue of the color. In some regions, this technique is referred to as the drying oil technique. 

Recent advances in chemistry have produced modern water miscible oil paints that can be used and cleaned up with water. Small alterations in the molecular structure of the oil create this water miscible property.

==Supports for oil painting==
The earliest oil paintings were almost all panel paintings on wood, which had been seasoned and prepared in a complicated and rather expensive process with the panel constructed from several pieces of wood, although such support tends to warp. Panels continued to be used well into the 17th century, including by Rubens, who painted several large works on wood. The artists of the Italian regions moved towards canvas in the early 16th century, led partly by a wish to paint larger images, which would have been too heavy as panels. Canvas for sails was made in Venice and so easily available and cheaper than wood.

Smaller paintings, with very fine detail, were easier to paint on a very firm surface, and wood panels or copper plates, often reused from printmaking, were often chosen for small cabinet paintings even in the 19th century. Portrait miniatures normally used very firm supports, including ivory, or stiff paper card.

Traditional artists&#x27; canvas is made from linen, but less expensive cotton fabric has been used. The artist first prepares a wooden frame called a &quot;stretcher&quot; or &quot;strainer&quot;. The difference between the two names is that &quot;stretchers&quot; are slightly adjustable, while &quot;strainers&quot; are rigid and lack adjustable corner notches. The canvas is then pulled across the wooden frame and tacked or stapled tightly to the back edge. Then the artist applies a &quot;size&quot; to isolate the canvas from the acidic qualities of the paint. Traditionally, the canvas was coated with a layer of animal glue (modern painters use rabbit skin glue) as the size and primed with lead white paint, sometimes with added chalk. Panels were prepared with a &quot;gesso&quot;, a mixture of glue and chalk.

Modern acrylic &quot;gesso&quot; is made of titanium dioxide with an acrylic binder. It is frequently used on canvas, whereas real gesso is not suitable for canvas. The artist might apply several layers of gesso, sanding each smooth after it has dried. Acrylic gesso is very difficult to sand. One manufacturer makes a &quot;sandable&quot; acrylic gesso, but it is intended for panels only and not canvas. It is possible to make the gesso a particular color, but most store-bought gesso is white. The gesso layer, depending on its thickness, will tend to draw the oil paint into the porous surface. Excessive or uneven gesso layers are sometimes visible on the surface of finished paintings as a change that&#x27;s not from the paint.

Standard sizes for oil paintings were set in France in the 19th century. The standards were used by most artists, not only the French, as it was—and still is—supported by the main suppliers of artists&#x27; materials. Size 0 (&quot;toile de 0&quot;) to size 120 (&quot;toile de 120&quot;) is divided into separate &quot;runs&quot; for figures (&quot;figure&quot;), landscapes (), and marines () that more or less preserve the diagonal. Thus a &quot;0 figure&quot; corresponds in height with a &quot;paysage 1&quot; and a &quot;marine 2&quot;.

Although surfaces like linoleum, wooden panel, paper, slate, pressed wood, Masonite, and cardboard have been used, the most popular surface since the 16th century has been canvas, although many artists used panel through the 17th century and beyond. The panel is more expensive, heavier, harder to transport, and prone to warp or split in poor conditions. For fine detail, however, the absolute solidity of a wooden panel has an advantage.

Some artists are now painting directly onto prepared Aluminium Composite Material (ACM) panels. Others combine the perceived benefits of canvas and panel by gluing canvas onto panels made from ACM, Masonite or other material.

==Process==
Oil paint is made by mixing pigments of colors with an oil medium. Since the 19th century the different main colors are purchased in paint tubes pre-prepared before painting begins, further shades of color are usually obtained by mixing small quantities as the painting process is underway. An artist&#x27;s palette, traditionally a thin wood board held in the hand, is used for holding and mixing paints. Pigments may be any number of natural or synthetic substances with color, such as sulfides for yellow or cobalt salts for blue. Traditional pigments were based on minerals or plants, but many have proven unstable over long periods. Modern pigments often use synthetic chemicals. The pigment is mixed with oil, usually linseed, but other oils may be used. The various oils dry differently, which creates assorted effects.

A brush is most commonly employed by the artist to apply the paint, often over a sketched outline of their subject (which could be in another medium). Brushes are made from a variety of fibers to create different effects. For example, brushes made with hog bristles might be used for bolder strokes and impasto textures. Fitch hair and mongoose hair brushes are fine and smooth, and thus answer well for portraits and detail work. Even more expensive are red sable brushes (weasel hair). The finest quality brushes are called &quot;kolinsky sable&quot;; these brush fibers are taken from the tail of the Siberian weasel. This hair keeps a superfine point, has smooth handling, and good memory (it returns to its original point when lifted off the canvas), known to artists as a brush&#x27;s &quot;snap&quot;. Floppy fibers with no snap, such as squirrel hair, are generally not used by oil painters.

In the past few decades, many synthetic brushes have been marketed. These are very durable and can be quite good, as well as cost efficient.
Brushes come in multiple sizes and are used for different purposes. The &quot;type&quot; of brush also makes a difference. For example, a &quot;round&quot; is a pointed brush used for detail work. &quot;Flat&quot; brushes are used to apply broad swaths of color. &quot;Bright&quot; is a flat brush with shorter brush hairs, used for &quot;scrubbing in&quot;. &quot;Filbert&quot; is a flat brush with rounded corners. &quot;Egbert&quot; is a very long, and rare, filbert brush. The artist might also apply paint with a palette knife, which is a flat metal blade. A palette knife may also be used to remove paint from the canvas when necessary. A variety of unconventional tools, such as rags, sponges, and cotton swabs, may be used to apply or remove paint. Some artists even paint with their fingers.
Old masters usually applied paint in thin layers known as &quot;glazes&quot; that allow light to penetrate completely through the layer, a method also simply called &quot;indirect painting&quot;. This technique is what gives oil paintings their luminous characteristics. This method was first perfected through an adaptation of the egg tempera painting technique (egg yolks used as a binder, mixed with pigment), and was applied by the Early Netherlandish painters in Northern Europe with pigments usually ground in linseed oil. This approach has been called the &quot;mixed technique&quot; or &quot;mixed method&quot; in modern times. The first coat (the underpainting) is laid down, often painted with egg tempera or turpentine-thinned paint. This layer helps to &quot;tone&quot; the canvas and to cover the white of the gesso. Many artists use this layer to sketch out the composition. This first layer can be adjusted before proceeding further, an advantage over the &quot;cartooning&quot; method used in fresco technique. After this layer dries, the artist might then proceed by painting a &quot;mosaic&quot; of color swatches, working from darkest to lightest. The borders of the colors are blended when the &quot;mosaic&quot; is completed and then left to dry before applying details.

Artists in later periods, such as the Impressionist era (late 19th century), often expanded on this wet-on-wet method, blending the wet paint on the canvas without following the Renaissance-era approach of layering and glazing. This method is also called &quot;alla prima&quot;. This method was created due to the advent of painting outdoors, instead of inside a studio, because while outside, an artist did not have the time to let each layer of paint dry before adding a new layer. Several contemporary artists use a combination of both techniques to add bold color (wet-on-wet) and obtain the depth of layers through glazing.

When the image is finished and has dried for up to a year, an artist often seals the work with a layer of varnish that is typically made from dammar gum crystals dissolved in turpentine. Such varnishes can be removed without disturbing the oil painting itself, to enable cleaning and conservation. Some contemporary artists decide not to varnish their work, preferring the surface unvarnished to avoid a glossy look.

== Impact on modern art ==
Oil painters such as Claude Monet and Vincent van Gogh revolutionized the medium in ways that profoundly shaped the evolution of modern art. Their groundbreaking innovations in technique, color, and form redefined traditional oil painting and set the stage for various art movements that followed. Their influence extends through Expressionism, Fauvism, Abstract Expressionism, and beyond, fundamentally altering how modern artists approach color, texture, and emotional expression.

Monet’s works, especially his later series like &quot;Water Lilies&quot;, are considered a precursor to abstract art. His emphasis on capturing the transient effects of light and his near-abstraction of form in his late works, such as &quot;Water Lilies: The Clouds&quot; (1920), pushed the boundaries of traditional representational painting. Artists like Jackson Pollock drew inspiration from Monet’s large-scale canvases and his focus on the physical process of painting, using techniques that emphasized the action of creating art over the final product.

Vincent van Gogh&#x27;s influence on modern art is equally significant, particularly through his emotive use of color and texture. His impasto technique, where thick layers of paint create a tactile, almost sculptural quality, was groundbreaking at the time and had a lasting impact on 20th-century movements such as Expressionism and Fauvism. His iconic works like &quot;Starry Night&quot; and &quot;Sunflowers&quot; showcase his emotional intensity, using exaggerated colors and dramatic compositions to convey psychological depth. Early 20th-century Expressionists, such as Edvard Munch and Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, were inspired by Van Gogh’s ability to express inner turmoil and existential angst through distorted forms and vibrant hues.

<doc id="22609" wikidata="Q7084096" url="?curid=22609" title="Old Glory">
<text>Old Glory is a nickname for the flag of the United States. The original &quot;Old Glory&quot; was a flag owned by the 19th-century American sea captain William Driver (March 17, 1803 – March 3, 1886). He flew the flag during his career at sea and later brought it to Nashville, Tennessee, where he settled. Driver greatly prized the flag and ensured its safety from the Confederates, who attempted to seize the flag during the American Civil War. In 1922, Driver&#x27;s daughter and niece claimed to own the original &quot;Old Glory&quot;, which became part of the collection of the Smithsonian Institution, which remains at the National Museum of American History.

==History of the original &quot;Old Glory&quot;==


Captain William Driver was born on March 17, 1803, in Salem, Massachusetts. At age 13, Driver ran away from home to become a cabin boy on a ship.

At 21, Driver qualified as a master mariner and assumed command of his own ship, the &quot;Charles Doggett&quot;. In celebration of his appointment, Driver&#x27;s mother and other women sewed the flag and gave it to him as a gift in 1824. It was believed that while leaving the harbor, the Captain unfurled his new flag, calling out &quot;Behold Old Glory.&quot; With this flag flying over his ship, Driver went on to have a colorful career as a U.S. merchant seaman, sailing to China, India, Gibraltar, and the South Pacific. He participated in the tortoiseshell trade and knew some Fijian. In 1831, while voyaging in the South Pacific, Driver&#x27;s ship &quot;was the sole surviving vessel of six that departed Salem the same day.&quot; In Tahiti, where they withdrew because of illness, Driver picked up the 65 descendants of the mutineers of HMS &quot;Bounty&quot; and brought them back to Pitcairn Island (a noteworthy act that helped publicize Driver&#x27;s nickname for the flag). Driver was convinced that God saved his ship to rescue the islanders.

Driver was deeply attached to the flag, writing: &quot;It has ever been my staunch companion and protection. Savages and heathens, lowly and oppressed, hailed and welcomed it at the far end of the wide world. Then, why should it not be called Old Glory?&quot;

Driver retired from seafaring in 1837 after his wife Martha Silsbee Babbage died from throat cancer. Driver was 34-years-old and had three young children. He settled in Nashville, Tennessee, where his three brothers operated a store. Driver remarried the next year to Sarah Jane Parks, a Southerner with whom he had several more children. Driver took his flag to Nashville, flying it on holidays, rain or shine. The flag was so large that he attached it to a rope from his attic window and stretched it on a pulley across the street to secure it to a locust tree. Driver worked as a salesman and served as vestryman of Christ Episcopal Church.

In 1860, Driver, his wife, and daughters repaired the flag, sewing on ten additional stars. Driver added by appliqué a small white anchor in the lower right corner to symbolize his maritime career. By that time, the secession crisis had begun, and Driver&#x27;s family was split. While Driver was a staunch Unionist, two of his sons were fervent Confederates who enlisted in local regiments. One of Driver&#x27;s sons died from wounds suffered at Perryville. In March 1862, Driver wrote: &quot;Two sons in the army of the South! My entire house estranged . . . and when I come home . . . no one to soothe me.&quot;

Soon after Tennessee seceded from the Union, Governor Isham G. Harris sent men to Driver&#x27;s home to demand the flag. Driver, 58 years old, turned the men away at his door after demanding they produce a search warrant. An armed group returned to Driver&#x27;s front porch, who refused to produce the flag, saying &quot;If you want my flag you&#x27;ll have to take it over my dead body.&quot;

To save the flag from further threats, Driver and some of his Unionist neighbors secretly sewed it into a coverlet. The flag was thus hidden until February 1862, when Nashville fell to Union forces. When the Union Army, led by the 6th Ohio Infantry, entered the city, Driver went to Tennessee state capitol after seeing the U.S. flag, and the 6th Ohio&#x27;s regimental colors raised on the Capitol flagstaffand asked to see the general in command.

Horace Fisher, the aide-de-camp to the Union commander in the city, Brigadier General William &quot;Bull&quot; Nelson, described Driver as &quot;a stout, middle-aged man, with hair well shot with gray, short in stature, broad in shoulder, and with a roll in his gait.&quot; Introducing himself as a sea captain and Unionist, Driver had brought the coverlet with him and with a pocket knife ripped open the seams, revealing the flag. Nelson accepted the flag and ordered it run up on the Capitol flagstaff. The 6th Ohio later adopted the motto &quot;Old Glory.&quot;

That night, a violent storm threatened to tear the flag, so Driver replaced it with a newer flag, taking the original Old Glory for safekeeping. The flag remained in his home until December 1864, when the Battle of Nashville was fought. As Confederate troopers under the command of John Bell Hood sought to retake the city, Driver hung the flag out of the third-story window and left to join the city&#x27;s defense. For the rest of the American Civil War, Driver served as provost marshal of Nashville, serving in hospitals.

Mary Jane Roland, Driver&#x27;s daughter, said Driver gave her the flag as a gift on July 10, 1873, telling her, &quot;This is my old ship flag Old Glory. I love it as a mother loves her child. Take it and cherish it as I have always cherished it; for it has been my steadfast friend and protector in all parts of the world—savage, heathen and civilized.&quot;

Driver died on March 3, 1886, and was buried in the Nashville City Cemetery, where, at Driver&#x27;s request, his rescue of the &quot;Bounty&quot; descendants is noted on his grave stone.

Following Driver&#x27;s death, a family feud erupted over the ownership of the flag. Driver&#x27;s niece, Harriet Ruth Waters Cooke, the daughter of Driver&#x27;s youngest sister, said she inherited the flag and presented her version of Old Glory to the Essex Institute in Salem, which became the Peabody Essex Museum, along with family memorabilia that included a letter from the Pitcairn Islands to Driver. Cooke published a family memoir in 1889, omitting any mention of Mary Jane Roland.

Roland wrote an account of the flag, publishing &quot;Old Glory, The True Story&quot; in 1918. In that memoir, Roland disputed Cooke&#x27;s narrative. She presented evidence for her claim that the flag she owned was the true Old Glory. In 1922, Roland gave her Old Glory to President Warren G. Harding. Harding had the flag sent to the Smithsonian Institution. The same year, the Peabody Essex Museum sent its Old Glory to the Smithsonian.

In 2019, Captain Driver&#x27;s great-great grandson, Jack Benz, published a novel depicting the life and adventures of Captain William Driver using information collected from personal research and inherited from Captain Driver&#x27;s descendants. 

==Smithsonian Institution collection==
The Smithsonian Institution has regarded the Roland flag as the authentic Old Glory, since &quot;documentary evidence in the Tennessee State Library and Archives suggests it was the one hidden in the quilt and presented to Union troops who took Nashville. The Roland flag is 17×10 feet. The Peabody flag is 12×6 feet.

In June 2006, the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Museum of American History (NMAH) loaned the Roland flag to the Tennessee State Museum in Nashville for an eight-month exhibit entitled &quot;Old Glory: An American Treasure Comes Home&quot;. The flag was in fragile condition and had to be carefully shipped and displayed.

A conservation evaluation of both flags by NMAH curator Jennifer Locke Jones and Thomassen-Krauss began in 2012. Preliminary findings indicate that the larger Roland flag has the stronger claim to being the original Old Glory but that the Peabody flag dated to the same era and is a legitimate Driver family heirloom and Civil War–era relic. The Roland Old Glory is heavily worn on the fly edges, consistent with the wear of a seagoing flag.

The Peabody Essex Museum has in its collection fragmentary scraps from what was claimed to be Old Glory.

<doc id="22611" wikidata="Q443777" url="?curid=22611" title="Orlando Letelier">
<text>Marcos Orlando Letelier del Solar (13 April 1932 – 21 September 1976) was a Chilean economist, politician and diplomat during the presidency of Salvador Allende. A refugee from the military dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet, Letelier accepted several academic positions in Washington, D.C. following his exile from Chile. In 1976, agents of Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional (DINA), the Pinochet regime&#x27;s secret police, assassinated Letelier in Washington in a car bombing. These agents had been working in collaboration with members of the Coordination of United Revolutionary Organizations, an anti-Castro militant group.

==Background==
Sergio Orlando Letelier del Solar was born in Temuco, Chile, the youngest child of Orlando Letelier Ruiz and Inés del Solar. He studied at the Instituto Nacional and, at the age of sixteen, was accepted as a cadet at the Chilean Military Academy, where he completed his secondary studies. Later, he abandoned a military career. He did not finish college and never received a university degree. In 1955, he joined the recently formed Copper Office (&quot;Departamento del Cobre&quot;, now CODELCO), where he worked until 1959 as a research analyst in the copper industry.

On 17 December 1955, Letelier married Isabel Margarita Morel Gumucio with whom he had four children: Cristián, José, Francisco, and Juan Pablo.

In 1959 Letelier was fired from the Copper Office, ostensibly for having supported Salvador Allende&#x27;s unsuccessful second presidential campaign. The Letelier family left for Venezuela, where Orlando became a copper consultant to the Finance Ministry.

==Political career==

While at university, Letelier became a student representative in the University of Chile&#x27;s Student Union. In 1959, he joined the Chilean Socialist Party (PS). In 1971, President Allende appointed him ambassador to the United States. His specific mission was to advocate in defense of the Chilean nationalization of copper, which had replaced the private ownership model favoured by the US government.

In 1973, Letelier was recalled to Chile and served successively as Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Interior and Defense.

In the coup d&#x27;état of 11 September 1973, he was the first high-ranking member of the Allende administration to be arrested. He was held for twelve months in various concentration camps and suffered severe torture: first at the Tacna Regiment, then at the Military Academy; later he was sent for eight months to a political prison on Dawson Island; from there he was transferred to the basement of the Air Force War Academy, and finally to the concentration camp of Ritoque. Following international diplomatic pressure, especially from Diego Arria, then Governor of Distrito Federal of Venezuela, he was released in September 1974 on the condition that he immediately leave Chile.

After his release, he and his family resettled in Caracas, but later moved to the United States on the recommendation of American writer Saul Landau.

In 1975, Letelier moved to Washington D.C., where he became senior fellow of the Washington, D.C.–based Institute for Policy Studies, a think tank Landau was involved in. Letelier became director of the Amsterdam-based Transnational Institute and taught at the School of International Service of the American University in Washington, D.C.

Letelier wrote several articles criticizing the &quot;Chicago Boys&quot;, a group of South American economists trained at the University of Chicago by Milton Friedman and Arnold Harberger who returned to their home countries to promote and advise leaders on the benefits of a free-market economy.

This economic model was used to great effect in Chile where General Pinochet sought to dismantle the country&#x27;s socialist economic system and replace it with a free-market economy. Letelier believed that in a resource-driven economy such as Chile, allowing markets to operate freely simply guaranteed the movement of wealth from the lower and middle classes to the monopolists and financial speculators. He soon became the leading voice of the Chilean resistance, preventing several loans (especially from Europe) from being awarded to the Chilean government. On 10 September 1976, he was stripped of his Chilean nationality.

==Death==

Letelier was killed by a car bombing on 21 September 1976 in Sheridan Circle in Washington, D.C., along with his American secretary and interpreter, Ronni Karpen Moffitt.

Moffitt&#x27;s husband, Michael Moffitt, was injured but survived. Several people were prosecuted and convicted for the murder. Among them were Michael Townley, a U.S. expatriate working for DINA, General Manuel Contreras, former head of DINA, and Brigadier Pedro Espinoza, also formerly of DINA. Townley was convicted in the United States in 1978 and served 62 months in prison for the murder; he is now free as a participant in the United States Federal Witness Protection Program. Contreras and Espinoza were convicted in Chile in 1993.

During the FBI investigation into the assassination, documents in Letelier&#x27;s possession were copied and leaked to journalists Rowland Evans and Robert Novak of &quot;The Washington Times&quot; and Jack Anderson by the FBI before being returned to his widow. The documents purportedly show Letelier was working with Eastern Bloc Intelligence agencies for a decade and coordinating his activities with the surviving political leadership of the Popular Unity coalition exiled in East Berlin. The FBI suspected that these individuals had been recruited by the Stasi. Documents in the briefcase showed that Letelier had maintained contact with Salvador Allende&#x27;s daughter, Beatriz Allende who was married to Cuban DGI station chief Luis Fernandez Ona.

Letelier&#x27;s funeral was held at St. Matthew&#x27;s Cathedral in Washington D.C., followed by a march to the site of the car-bombing at Sheridan Circle on Massachusetts Avenue, where folksinger Joan Baez sang in honor of Letelier. Several thousand U.S. citizens and Chilean exiles took part.

Diego Arria intervened again by bringing Letelier&#x27;s body to Caracas for burial, where he remained until 1994 after the end of Pinochet&#x27;s rule.

General Augusto Pinochet, who died on 10 December 2006, was never brought to trial for the murders, despite some evidence implicating him as having ordered them. However, in a letter dated March 14, 1976, Townley discussed plans for the assassination and noted that he in fact received the assassination order from Manuel Contreras&#x27;s deputy Pedro Espinoza. Townley also later claimed he conducted his operations, including the assassination of Letelier, by &quot;following orders from Gen. Contreras.&quot; Following the assassination, the United States cut military aid to Chile, and took a stance of &#x27;unobtrusiveness&#x27; within the country.

==Aftermath==

Following the death of Pinochet in December 2006, the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS), for which both Letelier and Moffitt worked, called for the release of all classified documents relating to the Letelier–Moffitt assassination.

According to the IPS, the Clinton administration de-classified more than 16,000 documents relating to Chile, but withheld documents relating to the Letelier-Moffitt assassination in Washington on the grounds that they were associated with an ongoing investigation. The IPS said the Clinton administration had re-opened the investigation into the Letelier-Moffitt murders and sent agents to Chile to gather additional evidence that Pinochet had authorized the crime. The former Chilean Secret Police Chief, Manuel Contreras, who was convicted for his role in the crime in 1993, later pointed the finger at his superiors, claiming that all relevant orders had come from Pinochet.

==Subsequent disclosures==

A US State Department document made available by the National Security Archive on 10 April 2010 reveals that a démarche protesting Pinochet&#x27;s Operation Condor assassination program was proposed and sent on 23 August 1976 to US diplomatic missions in Uruguay, Argentina, and Chile to be delivered to their host governments but later rescinded on 16 September 1976 by Henry Kissinger, following concerns raised by US ambassadors assigned there of both personal safety and a likely diplomatic contretemps. Five days later, the Letelier assassination took place.

Documents released in 2015 revealed a CIA report dated 28 April 1978, which claimed that the agency by then had knowledge that Pinochet ordered the murders. The report stated, &quot;Contreras told a confidante he authorized the assassination of Letelier on orders from Pinochet.&quot; A State Department document also referred to eight separate CIA reports from around the same date, each sourced to &quot;extremely sensitive informants&quot; who provided evidence of Pinochet&#x27;s direct involvement in ordering the assassination and in directing the subsequent cover-up. However, letters written by Letelier assassin Michael Townley, and which were published by the National Security Archive in November 2023, implied otherwise and instead linked Townley, DINA head Manuel Contreras and Contreras&#x27; deputy Pedro Esponiza to the assassination order. Townley noted in his March 1978 &quot;confession&quot; letter that while the Chilean bore responsibility, he carried out his DINA operations on order on Contreras, writing that “It is obvious that they intend to use the fact that I am a foreigner, to attempt to divert the responsibility of the Chilean government, and also to stop me from talking about the other things that I have done for DINA following orders from Gen. Contreras.&quot; In a U.S. Department of Justice affidavit from August 1991, U.S. Justice Department attorney Eric B. Marcy noted that numerous confession letters were obtained from his wife between 1982 and 1990 and that while the Pinochet regime employed Operación Mascarada to cover up its role in Letelier and Montiff&#x27;s assassination, the people in the Pinochet regime who Townley sought protect from were in fact Contreras and Espinoza. In one letter, Townley noted how he received the order to assassinate Letelier from Espinoza in March 1976 and, after the assassination was carried out, disclosed details on how he in fact was the one who recruited the assassination team which consisted of American Cuban exiles after entering the U.S. while in possession of phony visas he obtained in Paraguay. In another letter, Townley even accused Contreas of deceiving Pinochet about the assassination details.

During the tenure of Richard D. Downie at the William J. Perry Center for Hemispheric Defense Studies, a U.S. Southern Command educational institution located at the National Defense University, the role of Jaime Garcia Covarrubias, a Chilean professor who was head of counterintelligence for DINA—Pinochet’s state terrorism organization—in the 1970s, in the torture and murder of seven detainees was revealed inside the center. The case was first brought to Downie&#x27;s attention in early 2008 by Center Assistant Professor Martin Edwin Andersen, a senior staff member who earlier, as a senior advisor for policy planning at the Criminal Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, was the first national security whistleblower to receive the U.S. Office of Special Counsel&#x27;s &quot;Public Servant Award.&quot; By 2023, the time of the fiftieth anniversary of the far-right coup, Garcia Covarrubias was serving life imprisonment for his role in three separate cases of the murders of nine unarmed people, being found guilty in the case involving four university students and others. In an October 1987 investigative report in The Nation, Andersen broke the story of how, in a June 1976 meeting in the Hotel Carrera in Santiago, Kissinger gave the bloody military junta in neighboring Argentina the &quot;green light&quot; for their own dirty &quot;war.&quot;

On 22 November 2023, Michael Townley confession documents were published by the National Security Archive. Included among the documents were letters from March 1976 and March 1978 where Townley personally detailed his role in planning and undergoing Letelier&#x27;s assassination. In addition to personally implicating in earlier letters that Espinoza was the one who gave him the order to go through with the assassination and Contreras as being the one who he took order from when he took part in missions for DINA, it was also noted in the August 1991 U.S. Department of Justice affidavit that Townley in fact prepared his confession letters prior to his departure from Chile &quot;in order to protect him from the fugitives Manuel Contreras and Pedro Espinoza.&quot; In a separate letter which Townley sent to Manuel Contreras on March 1, 1978, he referred to Contreras as &quot;Don Manuel&quot; and made clear his belief that Contreras had not “let his Excellency [Pinochet] know the truth about this case” when he brought up Letelier&#x27;s assassination.

<doc id="22614" wikidata="Q30875" url="?curid=22614" title="Oscar Wilde">
<text>Oscar Fingal O&#x27;Fflahertie Wills Wilde (16 October 185430 November 1900) was an Irish poet and playwright. After writing in different forms throughout the 1880s, he became one of the most popular and influential playwrights in London in the early 1890s. He is best remembered for his epigrams and plays, his 1891 novel &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;, and his criminal conviction for gross indecency for homosexual acts.

Wilde&#x27;s parents were Anglo-Irish intellectuals in Dublin. In his youth, Wilde learned to speak fluent French and German. At university, he read Greats; he demonstrated himself to be an exceptional classicist, first at Trinity College Dublin, then at Magdalen College, Oxford. He became associated with the emerging philosophy of aestheticism, led by two of his tutors, Walter Pater and John Ruskin. After university, Wilde moved to London into fashionable cultural and social circles.

Wilde tried his hand at various literary activities: he wrote a play, published a book of poems, lectured in the United States and Canada on &quot;The English Renaissance&quot; in art and interior decoration, and then returned to London where he lectured on his American travels and wrote reviews for various periodicals. Known for his biting wit, flamboyant dress and glittering conversational skill, Wilde became one of the best-known personalities of his day. At the turn of the 1890s, he refined his ideas about the supremacy of art in a series of dialogues and essays, and incorporated themes of decadence, duplicity, and beauty into what would be his only novel, &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; (1890). Wilde returned to drama, writing &quot;Salome&quot; (1891) in French while in Paris, but it was refused a licence for England due to an absolute prohibition on the portrayal of Biblical subjects on the English stage. Undiscouraged, Wilde produced four society comedies in the early 1890s, which made him one of the most successful playwrights of late-Victorian London.

At the height of his fame and success, while &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot; (1895) and &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; (1895) were still being performed in London, Wilde issued a civil writ against John Sholto Douglas, the 9th Marquess of Queensberry for criminal libel. The Marquess was the father of Wilde&#x27;s lover, Lord Alfred Douglas. The libel hearings unearthed evidence that caused Wilde to drop his charges and led to his own arrest and criminal prosecution for gross indecency with other males. The jury was unable to reach a verdict and so a retrial was ordered. In the second trial Wilde was convicted and sentenced to two years&#x27; hard labour, the maximum penalty, and was jailed from 1895 to 1897. During his last year in prison he wrote &quot;De Profundis&quot; (published posthumously in abridged form in 1905), a long letter that discusses his spiritual journey through his trials and is a dark counterpoint to his earlier philosophy of pleasure. On the day of his release, he caught the overnight steamer to France, never to return to Britain or Ireland. In France and Italy, he wrote his last work, &quot;The Ballad of Reading Gaol&quot; (1898), a long poem commemorating the harsh rhythms of prison life.

== Early life ==

Oscar Wilde was born at 21 Westland Row, Dublin (now home of the Oscar Wilde Centre, Trinity College), the second of three children born to an Anglo-Irish couple: Jane, née Elgee, and Sir William Wilde. Oscar was two years younger than his brother, William (Willie) Wilde.

Jane Wilde was a niece (by marriage) of the novelist, playwright and clergyman Charles Maturin, who may have influenced her own literary career. She believed, mistakenly, that she was of Italian ancestry, and under the pseudonym &quot;Speranza&quot; (the Italian word for &#x27;hope&#x27;), she wrote poetry for the revolutionary Young Irelanders in 1848; she was a lifelong Irish nationalist. Jane Wilde read the Young Irelanders&#x27; poetry to Willie and Oscar, inculcating a love of these poets in her sons. Her interest in the neo-classical revival showed in the paintings and busts of ancient Greece and Rome in her home.

Sir William Wilde was Ireland&#x27;s leading oto-ophthalmologic (ear and eye) surgeon and was knighted in 1864 for his services as medical adviser and assistant commissioner to the censuses of Ireland. He also wrote books about Irish archaeology and peasant folklore. A renowned philanthropist, his dispensary for the care of the city&#x27;s poor at the rear of Trinity College Dublin (TCD), was the forerunner of the Dublin Eye and Ear Hospital, now located at Adelaide Road. On his father&#x27;s side Wilde was descended from a Dutch soldier, Colonel de Wilde, who came to Ireland with King William of Orange&#x27;s invading army in 1690, and numerous Anglo-Irish ancestors. On his mother&#x27;s side, Wilde&#x27;s ancestors included a bricklayer from County Durham, who emigrated to Ireland sometime in the 1770s.

Wilde was baptised as an infant in St. Mark&#x27;s Church, Dublin, the local Church of Ireland (Anglican) church. When the church was closed, the records were moved to the nearby St. Ann&#x27;s Church, Dawson Street. A Catholic priest in Glencree, County Wicklow, also claimed to have baptised Wilde and his brother Willie.

In addition to his two full siblings, Wilde had three paternal half-siblings, who were born out of wedlock before the marriage of his father: Henry Wilson, born in 1838 to one woman, and Emily and Mary Wilde, born in 1847 and 1849, respectively, to a second woman. Sir William acknowledged paternity of his children and provided for their education, arranging for them to be raised by his relatives.

The family moved to No 1 Merrion Square in 1855. With both Sir William and Lady Wilde&#x27;s success and delight in social life, the home soon became the site of a &quot;unique medical and cultural milieu&quot;. Guests at their salon included Sheridan Le Fanu, Charles Lever, George Petrie, Isaac Butt, William Rowan Hamilton and Samuel Ferguson.

Wilde&#x27;s sister, Isola Francesca Emily Wilde, was born on 2 April 1857. She was named in tribute to Iseult of Ireland, wife of Mark of Cornwall and lover of the Cornish knight, Sir Tristan. She shared the name Francesca with her mother, while Emily was the name of her maternal aunt. Oscar would later describe how his sister was like &quot;a golden ray of sunshine dancing about our home&quot; and he was grief stricken when she died at the age of nine of a febrile illness. His poem &quot;&quot; was written in her memory; the first stanza reads:

&lt;poem&gt;
Tread lightly, she is near
Under the snow
Speak gently, she can hear
The daisies grow.&lt;/poem&gt;

Until he was nine Wilde was educated at home, where a French nursemaid and a German governess taught him their languages. He joined his brother Willie at Portora Royal School in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, which he attended from 1864 to 1871. At Portora, although he was not as popular as his older brother, Wilde impressed his peers with the humorous and inventive school stories he told. Later in life, he claimed that his fellow students had regarded him as a prodigy for his ability to speed read, claiming that he could read two facing pages simultaneously and consume a three-volume book in half an hour, retaining enough information to give a basic account of the plot. He excelled academically, particularly in the subject of classics, in which he ranked fourth in the school in 1869. His aptitude for giving oral translations of Greek and Latin texts won him multiple prizes, including the Carpenter Prize for Greek Testament. He was one of only three students at Portora to win a Royal School scholarship to Trinity in 1871.

In 1871, when Wilde was seventeen, his elder half-sisters Mary and Emily died aged 22 and 24, fatally burned at a dance at Drumacon, Co Monaghan. One of the sisters had brushed against the flames of a fire or a candelabra and her dress caught fire; in various versions, the man she was dancing with carried her and her sister down to douse the flames in the snow, or her sister ran her down the stairs and rolled her in the snow, causing her own muslin dress to catch fire too.

Until his early twenties, Wilde summered at Moytura House, a villa his father had built in Cong, County Mayo. There the young Wilde and his brother Willie played with George Moore.

== University education: 1870s ==

=== Trinity College Dublin ===
Wilde left Portora with a royal scholarship to read classics at Trinity College Dublin (TCD), from 1871 to 1874, sharing rooms with his older brother Willie Wilde. Trinity, one of the leading classical schools, placed him with scholars such as R. Y. Tyrell, Arthur Palmer, Edward Dowden and his tutor, Professor J. P. Mahaffy, who inspired his interest in Greek literature. As a student, Wilde worked with Mahaffy on the latter&#x27;s book &quot;Social Life in Greece&quot;. Wilde, despite later reservations, called Mahaffy &quot;my first and best teacher&quot; and &quot;the scholar who showed me how to love Greek things&quot;. For his part, Mahaffy boasted of having created Wilde; later, he said Wilde was &quot;the only blot on my tutorship&quot;.

The University Philosophical Society also provided an education, as members discussed intellectual and artistic subjects such as the work of Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Algernon Charles Swinburne weekly. Wilde quickly became an established member – the members&#x27; suggestion book for 1874 contains two pages of banter sportingly mocking Wilde&#x27;s emergent aestheticism. He presented a paper titled &quot;Aesthetic Morality&quot;. At Trinity, Wilde established himself as an outstanding student: he came first in his class in his first year, won a scholarship by competitive examination in his second and, in his finals, won the Berkeley Gold Medal in Greek, the university&#x27;s highest academic award. He was encouraged to compete for a demyship, a half-scholarship worth £95 per year (), at Magdalen College, Oxford, which he won easily.

=== Magdalen College, Oxford ===
At Magdalen, he read Greats from 1874 to 1878. He applied to join the Oxford Union, but failed to be elected.

Attracted by its dress, secrecy and ritual, Wilde petitioned the Apollo Masonic Lodge at Oxford, and was soon raised to the Sublime Degree of Master Mason. During a resurgent interest in Freemasonry in his third year, he commented he &quot;would be awfully sorry to give it up if I secede from the Protestant Heresy&quot;. Wilde&#x27;s active involvement in Freemasonry lasted only for the time he spent at Oxford; he allowed his membership of the Apollo University Lodge to lapse after failing to pay subscriptions.

Catholicism deeply appealed to him, especially its rich liturgy, and he discussed converting to it with clergy several times. In 1877, Wilde was left speechless after an audience with Pope Pius IX in Rome. He eagerly read the books of Cardinal Newman, a noted Anglican priest who had converted to Catholicism and risen in the church hierarchy. He became more serious in 1878, when he met the Reverend Sebastian Bowden, a priest in the Brompton Oratory who had received some high-profile converts. Neither Mahaffy nor Sir William, who threatened to cut off his son&#x27;s funding, thought much of the plan; but Wilde, the supreme individualist, balked at the last minute from pledging himself to any formal creed, and on the appointed day of his baptism into Catholicism, he sent Father Bowden a bunch of altar lilies instead. Wilde did retain a lifelong interest in Catholic theology and liturgy.

While at Magdalen College, Wilde became well known for his role in the aesthetic and decadent movements. He wore his hair long, openly scorned &quot;manly&quot; sportsthough he occasionally boxedand decorated his rooms with peacock feathers, lilies, sunflowers, blue china and other &quot;objets d&#x27;art&quot;. He entertained lavishly, and once remarked to some friends, &quot;I find it harder and harder every day to live up to my blue china.&quot; The line spread famously; aesthetes adopted it as a slogan, but it was criticized as being terribly vacuous. Some elements disdained the aesthetes, but their languorous attitudes and showy costumes became a recognisable pose. When four of his fellow students physically assaulted Wilde, he fended them off single-handedly, to the surprise of his detractors. By his third year Wilde had truly begun to develop himself and his myth, and considered his learning to be more expansive than what was within the prescribed texts. He was rusticated for one term, after he had returned late to a college term from a trip to Greece with Mahaffy.

Wilde did not meet Walter Pater until his third year, but had been enthralled by his &quot;Studies in the History of the Renaissance&quot;, published during Wilde&#x27;s final year in Trinity. Pater argued that man&#x27;s sensibility to beauty should be refined above all else, and that each moment should be felt to its fullest extent. Years later, in &quot;De Profundis&quot;, Wilde described Pater&#x27;s &quot;Studies...&quot; as &quot;that book that has had such a strange influence over my life&quot;. He learned tracts of the book by heart, and carried it with him on travels in later years. Pater gave Wilde his sense of almost flippant devotion to art, though he gained a purpose for it through the lectures and writings of critic John Ruskin. Ruskin despaired at the self-validating aestheticism of Pater, arguing that the importance of art lies in its potential for the betterment of society. Ruskin admired beauty, but believed it must be allied with, and applied to, moral good. When Wilde eagerly attended Ruskin&#x27;s lecture series &quot;The Aesthetic and Mathematic Schools of Art in Florence&quot;, he learned about aesthetics as the non-mathematical elements of painting. Despite being given to neither early rising nor manual labour, Wilde volunteered for Ruskin&#x27;s project to convert a swampy country lane into a smart road neatly edged with flowers.

Wilde won the 1878 Newdigate Prize for his poem &quot;&quot;, which reflected on his visit there in the previous year, and he duly read it at Encaenia. In November 1878, he graduated Bachelor of Arts with a double first, having been placed in the first class in Classical Moderations (the first part of the course) and then again in the final examination in Literae Humaniores (Greats). Wilde wrote to a friend, &quot;The dons are &quot; beyond words – the Bad Boy doing so well in the end!&quot;

== Apprenticeship of an aesthete: 1880s ==

=== Debut in society ===
After graduation from Oxford, Wilde returned to Dublin, where he met again Florence Balcombe, a childhood sweetheart. She became engaged to Bram Stoker and they married in 1878. Wilde was disappointed but stoic. He wrote to Balcombe remembering; &quot;the two sweet years – the sweetest years of all my youth&quot; during which they had been close. He also stated his intention to &quot;return to England, probably for good&quot;. This he did in 1878, only briefly visiting Ireland twice after that.

Unsure of his next step, Wilde wrote to various acquaintances enquiring about Classics positions at Oxford or Cambridge. &quot;The Rise of Historical Criticism&quot; was his submission for the Chancellor&#x27;s Essay prize of 1879, which, though no longer a student, he was still eligible to enter. Its subject, &quot;Historical Criticism among the Ancients&quot; seemed ready-made for Wilde – with both his skill in composition and ancient learning – but he struggled to find his voice in the long, flat, scholarly style. Unusually, no prize was awarded that year.

With the last of his inheritance from the sale of his father&#x27;s houses, he set himself up as a bachelor in London. The 1881 British Census listed Wilde as a boarder at 1 (now 44) Tite Street, Chelsea, where Frank Miles, a society painter, was the head of the household.

Lillie Langtry was introduced to Wilde at Frank Miles&#x27; studio in 1877. The most glamorous woman in England, Langtry assumed great importance to Wilde during his early years in London, and they remained close friends for many years; he tutored her in Latin and later encouraged her to pursue acting. She wrote in her autobiography that he &quot;possessed a remarkably fascinating and compelling personality&quot;, and &quot;the cleverness of his remarks received added value from his manner of delivering them.&quot;

Wilde regularly attended the theatre and was especially taken with star actresses such as Ellen Terry and Sarah Bernhardt. In 1880 he completed his first play, &quot;Vera; or, The Nihilists&quot;, a tragic melodrama about Russian nihilism, and distributed privately printed copies to various actresses whom he hoped to interest in its sole female role. A one-off performance in London was advertised in November 1881 with Mrs. Bernard Beere as Vera, but withdrawn by Wilde for what was claimed to be consideration for political feeling in England.

He had been publishing lyrics and poems in magazines since entering Trinity College, especially in &quot;Kottabos&quot; and the &quot;Dublin University Magazine&quot;. In mid-1881, at 27 years old, he published &quot;Poems&quot;, which collected, revised and expanded his poems.

Though the book sold out its first print run of 750 copies, it was not generally well received by the critics: &quot;Punch&quot;, for example, said that &quot;The poet is Wilde, but his poetry&#x27;s tame&quot;. By a tight vote, the Oxford Union condemned the book for alleged plagiarism. The librarian, who had requested the book for the library, returned the presentation copy to Wilde with a note of apology. Biographer Richard Ellmann argues that Wilde&#x27;s poem &quot;&quot; was a sincere, though flamboyant, attempt to explain the dichotomies the poet saw in himself; one line reads: &quot;To drift with every passion till my soul / Is a stringed lute on which all winds can play&quot;.

The book had further printings in 1882. It was bound in a rich, enamel parchment cover (embossed with gilt blossom) and printed on hand-made Dutch paper; over the next few years, Wilde presented many copies to the dignitaries and writers who received him during his lecture tours.

=== North America: 1882 ===

Aestheticism was sufficiently in vogue to be caricatured by Gilbert and Sullivan in &quot;Patience&quot; (1881). Richard D&#x27;Oyly Carte, an English impresario, invited Wilde to make a lecture tour of North America, simultaneously priming the pump for the US tour of &quot;Patience&quot; and selling this most charming aesthete to the American public. Wilde journeyed on the SS &quot;Arizona&quot;, arriving on 2 January 1882, and disembarking the following day. Originally planned to last four months, the tour continued for almost a year owing to its commercial success. Wilde sought to transpose the beauty he saw in art into daily life. This was a practical as well as philosophical project: in Oxford he had surrounded himself with blue china and lilies, and now one of his lectures was on interior design. In a British Library article on aestheticism and decadence, Carolyn Burdett writes, 

When asked to explain reports that he had paraded down Piccadilly in London carrying a lily, long hair flowing, Wilde replied, &quot;It&#x27;s not whether I did it or not that&#x27;s important, but whether people believed I did it&quot;. Wilde believed that the artist should hold forth higher ideals, and that pleasure and beauty would replace utilitarian ethics.
Wilde and aestheticism were both mercilessly caricatured and criticised in the press: the &quot;Springfield Republican&quot;, for instance, commented on Wilde&#x27;s behaviour during his visit to Boston to lecture on aestheticism, suggesting that Wilde&#x27;s conduct was more a bid for notoriety rather than devotion to beauty and the aesthetic. T. W. Higginson, a cleric and abolitionist, wrote in &quot;Unmanly Manhood&quot; of his general concern that Wilde, &quot;whose only distinction is that he has written a thin volume of very mediocre verse&quot;, would improperly influence the behaviour of men and women.

According to biographer Michèle Mendelssohn, Wilde was the subject of anti-Irish caricature and was portrayed as a monkey, a blackface performer and a Christy&#x27;s Minstrel throughout his career. &quot;&quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; put a sunflower-worshipping monkey dressed as Wilde on the front of the January 1882 issue. The drawing stimulated other American maligners and, in England, had a full-page reprint in the &quot;Lady&#x27;s Pictorial&quot;. ... When the &quot;National Republican&quot; discussed Wilde, it was to explain &#x27;a few items as to the animal&#x27;s pedigree.&#x27; And on 22 January 1882, the &quot;Washington Post&quot; illustrated the Wild Man of Borneo alongside Oscar Wilde of England and asked &#x27;How far is it from this to this?&#x27;&quot; When he visited San Francisco, the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; reported, &quot;The city is divided into two camps, those who thought Wilde was an engaging speaker and an original thinker, and those who thought he was the most pretentious fraud ever perpetrated on a groaning public.&quot; Though his press reception was hostile, Wilde was well received in diverse settings across America: he drank whiskey with miners in Leadville, Colorado, and was fêted at the most fashionable salons in many cities he visited.

=== London life and marriage ===

His earnings, plus expected income from &quot;The Duchess of Padua&quot;, allowed him to move to Paris between February and mid-May 1883. While there he met Robert Sherard, whom he entertained constantly. &quot;We are dining on the Duchess tonight&quot;, Wilde would declare before taking him to an expensive restaurant. In August he briefly returned to New York for the production of &quot;Vera&quot;, the rights of which he had sold to the American actress Marie Prescott. The play was initially well received by the audience, but when the critics wrote lukewarm reviews, attendance fell sharply and the play closed a week after it had opened.

In London, he had been introduced in 1881 to Constance Lloyd, daughter of Horace Lloyd, a wealthy Queen&#x27;s Counsel (lawyer). She happened to be visiting Dublin in 1884 when Wilde was lecturing at the Gaiety Theatre. He proposed to her, and they married on 29 May 1884 at the Anglican St James&#x27;s Church, Paddington, in London. Although Constance had an annual allowance of £250, which was generous for a young woman (), the Wildes had relatively luxurious tastes. They had preached to others for so long on the subject of design that people expected their home to set new standards. No 16 Tite Street was duly renovated in seven months at considerable expense. The couple had two sons, Cyril (1885) and Vyvyan (1886). Wilde became the sole literary signatory of George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s petition for a pardon of the anarchists arrested (and later executed) after the Haymarket massacre in Chicago in 1886.

 In 1886, while at Oxford, Wilde met Robert Ross. Ross, who had read Wilde&#x27;s poems before they met, seemed unrestrained by the Victorian prohibition against homosexuality. By Richard Ellmann&#x27;s account, he was a precocious seventeen-year-old who &quot;so young and yet so knowing, was determined to seduce Wilde&quot;. According to Daniel Mendelsohn, Wilde, who had long alluded to Greek love, was &quot;initiated into homosexual sex&quot; by Ross, while his &quot;marriage had begun to unravel after his wife&#x27;s second pregnancy, which left him physically repelled&quot;.

Wilde had a number of favourite haunts in London. These included the Café Royal in Piccadilly, Hatchards bookstore in Piccadilly, and the department stores Liberty &amp; Co. on Great Marlborough Street and Harrods in Knightsbridge; Wilde was among Harrods&#x27; first selected customers who were granted extended credit.

== Prose writing: 1886–1891 ==

=== Journalism and editorship: 1886–1889 ===
Criticism over artistic matters in &quot;The Pall Mall Gazette&quot; provoked a letter of self-defence, and soon Wilde was a contributor to that and other journals during 1885–87. Although Richard Ellmann has claimed that Wilde enjoyed reviewing, Wilde&#x27;s wife would tell friends that &quot;Mr Wilde hates journalism&quot;. Like his parents before him, Wilde supported Ireland&#x27;s cause, and when Charles Stewart Parnell was falsely accused of inciting murder, he wrote a series of astute columns defending the politician in the &quot;Daily Chronicle&quot;.

His flair, having previously been put mainly into socialising, suited journalism and rapidly attracted notice. With his youth nearly over and a family to support, in mid-1887 Wilde became the editor of &quot;The Lady&#x27;s World&quot; magazine, his name prominent on the cover. He promptly renamed it as &quot;The Woman&#x27;s World&quot; and raised its tone, adding serious articles on parenting, culture, and politics, while keeping discussions of fashion and arts. Two pieces of fiction were usually included, one to be read to children, the other for adult readers. Wilde worked hard to solicit good contributions from his wide artistic acquaintance, including those of Lady Wilde and his wife, Constance, while his own &quot;Literary and Other Notes&quot; were themselves popular and amusing.

The initial vigour and excitement which he brought to the job began to fade as administration, commuting and office life became tedious. At the same time as Wilde&#x27;s interest flagged, the publishers became concerned about circulation: sales, at the relatively high price of one shilling, remained low. Increasingly sending instructions to the magazine by letter, Wilde began a new period of creative work and his own column appeared less regularly. In October 1889, Wilde had finally found his voice in prose and, at the end of the second volume, Wilde left &quot;The Woman&#x27;s World&quot;. The magazine outlasted him by only a year.
Wilde&#x27;s period at the helm of the magazine played a pivotal role in his development as a writer and facilitated his ascent to fame. Whilst Wilde the journalist supplied articles under the guidance of his editors, Wilde the editor was forced to learn to manipulate the literary marketplace on his own terms.

During the 1880s, Wilde was a close friend of the artist James McNeill Whistler and they dined together on many occasions. At one of these dinners, Whistler produced a &quot;bon mot&quot; that Wilde found particularly witty, Wilde exclaimed that he wished that he had said it. Whistler retorted &quot;You will, Oscar, you will.&quot; Herbert Viviana mutual friend of Wilde and Whistlerattended the dinner and recorded it in his article &quot;The Reminiscences of a Short Life&quot;, which appeared in &quot;The Sun&quot; in 1889. The article alleged that Wilde had a habit of passing off other people&#x27;s witticisms as his ownespecially Whistler&#x27;s. Wilde considered Vivian&#x27;s article to be a scurrilous betrayal, and it directly caused the broken friendship between Wilde and Whistler. &quot;The Reminiscences&quot; also caused great acrimony between Wilde and Vivian, Wilde accusing Vivian of &quot;the inaccuracy of an eavesdropper with the method of a blackmailer&quot; and banishing Vivian from his circle. Vivian&#x27;s allegations did not diminish Wilde&#x27;s reputation as an epigrammatist. London theatre director Luther Munday recounted some of Wilde&#x27;s typical quips: Wilde said of Whistler that &quot;he had no enemies but was intensely disliked by his friends&quot;, of Hall Caine that &quot;he wrote at the top of his voice&quot;, of Rudyard Kipling that &quot;he revealed life by splendid flashes of vulgarity&quot;, of Henry James that &quot;he wrote fiction as if it were a painful duty&quot;, and of Marion Crawford that &quot;he immolated himself on the altar of local colour&quot;.

=== Shorter fiction ===

Wilde had been regularly writing fairy stories for magazines. He published &quot;The Happy Prince and Other Tales&quot; in 1888. In 1891 he published two more collections, &quot;Lord Arthur Savile&#x27;s Crime and Other Stories&quot;, and in September &quot;A House of Pomegranates&quot; was dedicated &quot;To Constance Mary Wilde&quot;. &quot;The Portrait of Mr. W. H.&quot;, which Wilde had begun in 1887, was first published in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Edinburgh Magazine&quot; in July 1889. It is a short story which reports a conversation in which the theory that Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets were written out of the poet&#x27;s love of the boy actor &quot;Willie Hughes&quot;, is advanced, retracted, and then propounded again. The only evidence for this is two supposed puns within the sonnets themselves.

The anonymous narrator is at first sceptical, then believing, and finally flirtatious with the reader: he concludes that &quot;there is really a great deal to be said of the Willie Hughes theory of Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets.&quot; By the end fact and fiction have melded together. Arthur Ransome wrote that Wilde &quot;read something of himself into Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets&quot; and became fascinated with the &quot;Willie Hughes theory&quot; despite the lack of biographical evidence for the historical William Hughes&#x27; existence. Instead of writing a short but serious essay on the question, Wilde tossed the theory to the three characters of the story, allowing it to unfold as background to the plot an early masterpiece of Wilde&#x27;s combining many elements that interested him: conversation, literature and the idea that to shed oneself of an idea one must first convince another of its truth. Ransome concludes that Wilde succeeds precisely because the literary criticism is unveiled with such a deft touch.

Though containing nothing but &quot;special pleading&quot; – it would not, he says &quot;be possible to build an airier castle in Spain than this of the imaginary William Hughes&quot; – we continue listening nonetheless to be charmed by the telling. &quot;You must believe in Willie Hughes,&quot; Wilde told an acquaintance, &quot;I almost do, myself.&quot;

=== Essays and dialogues ===
Wilde, having tired of journalism, had been busy setting out his aesthetic ideas more fully in a series of longer prose pieces which were published in the major literary-intellectual journals of the day. In January 1889, &quot;The Decay of Lying: A Dialogue&quot; appeared in &quot;The Nineteenth Century&quot;, and &quot;Pen, Pencil and Poison&quot;, a satirical biography of Thomas Griffiths Wainewright, in &quot;The Fortnightly Review&quot;, edited by Wilde&#x27;s friend Frank Harris. Two of Wilde&#x27;s four writings on aesthetics are dialogues: though Wilde had evolved professionally from lecturer to writer, he retained an oral tradition of sorts. Having always excelled as a wit and raconteur, he often composed by assembling phrases, &quot;bons mots&quot; and witticisms into a longer, cohesive work.

Wilde was concerned about the effect of moralising on art; he believed in art&#x27;s redemptive, developmental powers: &quot;Art is individualism, and individualism is a disturbing and disintegrating force. There lies its immense value. For what it seeks is to disturb monotony of type, slavery of custom, tyranny of habit, and the reduction of man to the level of a machine.&quot; In his only political text, &quot;The Soul of Man Under Socialism&quot;, he argued political conditions should establish this primacy – private property should be abolished, and cooperation should be substituted for competition. He wrote &quot;Socialism, Communism, or whatever one chooses to call it, by converting private property into public wealth, and substituting co-operation for competition, will restore society to its proper condition of a thoroughly healthy organism, and insure the material well-being of each member of the community. It will, in fact, give Life its proper basis and its proper environment&quot;. At the same time, he stressed that the government most amenable to artists was no government at all. Wilde envisioned a society where mechanisation has freed human effort from the burden of necessity, effort which can instead be expended on artistic creation. George Orwell summarised, &quot;In effect, the world will be populated by artists, each striving after perfection in the way that seems best to him.&quot;

This point of view did not align him with the Fabians, intellectual socialists who advocated using state apparatus to change social conditions, nor did it endear him to the monied classes whom he had previously entertained. Hesketh Pearson, introducing a collection of Wilde&#x27;s essays in 1950, remarked how &quot;The Soul of Man Under Socialism&quot; had been an inspirational text for revolutionaries in Tsarist Russia but laments that in the Stalinist era &quot;it is doubtful whether there are any uninspected places in which it could now be hidden&quot;.
Wilde considered including this pamphlet and &quot;The Portrait of Mr. W. H.&quot;, his essay-story on Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets, in a new anthology in 1891, but eventually decided to limit it to purely aesthetic subjects. &quot;Intentions&quot; packaged revisions of four essays: &quot;The Decay of Lying&quot;; &quot;Pen, Pencil and Poison&quot;; &quot;The Truth of Masks&quot; (first published 1885); and &quot;The Critic as Artist&quot; in two parts. For Pearson the biographer, the essays and dialogues exhibit every aspect of Wilde&#x27;s genius and character: wit, romancer, talker, lecturer, humanist and scholar and concludes that &quot;no other productions of his have as varied an appeal&quot;. 1891 turned out to be Wilde&#x27;s &quot;annus mirabilis&quot;; apart from his three collections he also produced his only novel.

=== &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; ===
The first version of &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; was published as the lead story in the July 1890 edition of &quot;Lippincott&#x27;s Monthly Magazine&quot;, along with five others. The story begins with a man painting a picture of Gray. When Gray, who has a &quot;face like ivory and rose leaves&quot;, sees his finished portrait, he breaks down. Distraught that his beauty will fade while the portrait stays beautiful, he inadvertently makes a Faustian bargain in which only the painted image grows old while he stays beautiful and young. For Wilde, the purpose of art would be to guide life as if beauty alone were its object. As Gray&#x27;s portrait allows him to escape the corporeal ravages of his hedonism, Wilde sought to juxtapose the beauty he saw in art with daily life.

Reviewers immediately criticised the novel&#x27;s decadence and homosexual allusions; the &quot;Daily Chronicle&quot; for example, called it &quot;unclean&quot;, &quot;poisonous&quot;, and &quot;heavy with the mephitic odours of moral and spiritual putrefaction&quot;. Wilde vigorously responded, writing to the editor of the &quot;Scots Observer&quot;, in which he clarified his stance on ethics and aesthetics in art – &quot;If a work of art is rich and vital and complete, those who have artistic instincts will see its beauty and those to whom ethics appeal more strongly will see its moral lesson.&quot; He nevertheless revised it extensively for book publication in 1891: six new chapters were added, some overtly decadent passages and homo-eroticism excised, and a preface was included consisting of twenty-two epigrams, such as &quot;Books are well written, or badly written. That is all.&quot;

Contemporary reviewers and modern critics have postulated numerous possible sources of the story, a search Jershua McCormack argues is futile because Wilde &quot;has tapped a root of Western folklore so deep and ubiquitous that the story has escaped its origins and returned to the oral tradition&quot;. Wilde claimed the plot was &quot;an idea that is as old as the history of literature but to which I have given a new form&quot;. Modern critic Robin McKie considered the novel to be technically mediocre, saying that the conceit of the plot had guaranteed its fame, but the device is never pushed to its full. On the other hand, Robert McCrum of &quot;The Guardian&quot; lists it among the 100 best novels ever written in English, calling it &quot;an arresting, and slightly camp, exercise in late-Victorian gothic&quot;. The novel has been the subject of many adaptations to film and stage, and one of its most quoted lines, &quot;there is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about&quot;, features in Monty Python&#x27;s &quot;Oscar Wilde sketch&quot; in an episode of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;.

== Theatrical career: 1892–1895 ==

=== &quot;Salomé&quot; ===
The 1891 census records the Wildes&#x27; residence at 16 Tite Street, where Oscar lived with his wife Constance and two sons. Not content with being better known than ever in London, though, he returned to Paris in October 1891, this time as a respected writer. He was received at the &quot;salons littéraires&quot;, including the famous &quot;mardis&quot; of Stéphane Mallarmé, a renowned symbolist poet of the time. Wilde&#x27;s two plays during the 1880s, &quot;Vera; or, The Nihilists&quot; and &quot;The Duchess of Padua&quot;, had not met with much success. He had continued his interest in the theatre and now, after finding his voice in prose, his thoughts turned again to the dramatic form as the biblical iconography of Salome filled his mind. One evening, after discussing depictions of Salome throughout history, he returned to his hotel and noticed a blank copybook lying on the desk, and it occurred to him to write in it what he had been saying. The result was a new play, &quot;Salomé&quot;, written rapidly and in French.

A tragedy, it tells the story of Salome, the stepdaughter of the tetrarch Herod Antipas, who, to her stepfather&#x27;s dismay but mother&#x27;s delight, requests the head of Jokanaan (John the Baptist) on a silver platter as a reward for dancing the Dance of the Seven Veils. When Wilde returned to London just before Christmas the &quot;Paris Echo&quot; referred to him as &quot;le great event&quot; of the season. Rehearsals of the play, starring Sarah Bernhardt, began but the play was refused a licence by the Lord Chamberlain since it depicted biblical characters. &quot;Salome&quot; was published jointly in Paris and London in 1893 in the original French, and in London a year later in Lord Alfred Douglas&#x27;s English translation with illustrations by Aubrey Beardsley, though it was not performed until 1896 in Paris, during Wilde&#x27;s incarceration.

=== Comedies of society ===
Wilde, who had first set out to irritate Victorian society with his dress and talking points, then to outrage it with &quot;Dorian Gray&quot;, his novel of vice hidden beneath art, finally found a way to critique society on its own terms. &quot;Lady Windermere&#x27;s Fan&quot; was first performed on 20 February 1892 at St James&#x27;s Theatre, packed with the cream of society. On the surface a witty comedy, there is subtle subversion underneath: &quot;it concludes with collusive concealment rather than collective disclosure&quot;. The audience, like Lady Windermere, are forced to soften harsh social codes in favour of a more nuanced view. The play was enormously popular, touring the country for months, but largely trashed by conservative critics. The success of the play saw Wilde earn £7,000 in the first year alone ().

His first hit play was followed by &quot;A Woman of No Importance&quot; in 1893, another Victorian comedy, revolving around the spectre of illegitimate births, mistaken identities and late revelations. Wilde was commissioned to write two more plays and &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot;, written in 1894, followed in January 1895.

Peter Raby said these essentially English plays were well-pitched: &quot;Wilde, with one eye on the dramatic genius of Ibsen, and the other on the commercial competition in London&#x27;s West End, targeted his audience with adroit precision&quot;.

=== Queensberry family ===

In mid-1891, Lionel Johnson introduced Wilde to Lord Alfred Douglas, Johnson&#x27;s cousin, who was at the time an undergraduate at Oxford. Known to his family and friends as &quot;Bosie&quot;, he was a handsome and spoilt young man. An intimate friendship sprang up between Wilde and Douglas and by 1893 Wilde was infatuated with Douglas and they consorted together regularly in a tempestuous affair. If Wilde was relatively indiscreet, even flamboyant, in the way he acted, Douglas was reckless in public. Wilde, who was earning up to £100 a week from his plays (his salary at &quot;The Woman&#x27;s World&quot; had been £6), indulged Douglas&#x27;s every whim: material, artistic, or sexual.

Douglas soon initiated Wilde into the Victorian underground of gay prostitution, and Wilde was introduced to a series of young working-class male prostitutes (rent boys) from 1892 onwards by Alfred Taylor. These infrequent rendezvous usually took the same form: Wilde would meet the boy, offer him gifts, dine him privately and then take him to a hotel room. Unlike Wilde&#x27;s idealised relations with Ross, John Gray, and Douglas, all of whom remained part of his aesthetic circle, these consorts were uneducated and knew nothing of literature. Soon his public and private lives had become sharply divided; in &quot;De Profundis&quot; he wrote to Douglas that &quot;It was like feasting with panthers; the danger was half the excitement... I did not know that when they were to strike at me it was to be at another&#x27;s piping and at another&#x27;s pay.&quot;

Douglas and some Oxford friends founded a journal, &quot;The Chameleon&quot;, to which Wilde &quot;sent a page of paradoxes originally destined for the &quot;Saturday Review&quot;&quot;. &quot;&quot; was to come under attack six months later at Wilde&#x27;s trial, where he was forced to defend the magazine to which he had sent his work. In any case, it became unique: &quot;The Chameleon&quot; was not published again.

Lord Alfred&#x27;s father, the Marquess of Queensberry, was known for his outspoken atheism, brutish manner and creation of the modern rules of boxing. Queensberry, who feuded regularly with his son, confronted Wilde and Lord Alfred about the nature of their relationship several times, but Wilde was able to mollify him. In June 1894, he called on Wilde at 16 Tite Street, without an appointment, and clarified his stance: &quot;I do not say that you are it, but you look it, and pose at it, which is just as bad. And if I catch you and my son again in any public restaurant I will thrash you&quot; to which Wilde responded: &quot;I don&#x27;t know what the Queensberry rules are, but the Oscar Wilde rule is to shoot on sight&quot;. His account in &quot;De Profundis&quot; was less triumphant: &quot;It was when, in my library at Tite Street, waving his small hands in the air in epileptic fury, your father... stood uttering every foul word his foul mind could think of, and screaming the loathsome threats he afterwards with such cunning carried out&quot;. Queensberry only described the scene once, saying Wilde had &quot;shown him the white feather&quot;, meaning he had acted in a cowardly way. Though trying to remain calm, Wilde saw that he was becoming ensnared in a brutal family quarrel. He did not wish to bear Queensberry&#x27;s insults, but he knew that confronting him could lead to disaster were his liaisons disclosed publicly.

=== &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; ===

Wilde&#x27;s final play again returns to the theme of switched identities: the play&#x27;s two protagonists engage in &quot;bunburying&quot; (the maintenance of alternative personas in the town and country) which allows them to escape Victorian social mores. &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; is even lighter in tone than Wilde&#x27;s earlier comedies. While their characters often rise to serious themes in moments of crisis, &quot;Earnest&quot; lacks the by-now-stock Wildean characters: there is no &quot;woman with a past&quot;, the principals are neither villainous nor cunning, simply idle , and the idealistic young women are not that innocent. Mostly set in drawing rooms and almost completely lacking in action or violence, &quot;Earnest&quot; lacks the self-conscious decadence found in &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; and &quot;Salome&quot;.

The play, now considered Wilde&#x27;s masterpiece, was rapidly written in Wilde&#x27;s artistic maturity in late 1894. It was first performed on 14 February 1895, at St James&#x27;s Theatre in London, Wilde&#x27;s second collaboration with George Alexander, the actor-manager. Both author and producer assiduously revised, prepared and rehearsed every line, scene and setting in the months before the premiere, creating a carefully constructed representation of late-Victorian society, yet simultaneously mocking it. During rehearsal Alexander requested that Wilde shorten the play from four acts to three, which the author did. Premieres at St James&#x27;s seemed like &quot;brilliant parties&quot;, and the opening of &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; was no exception. Allan Aynesworth (who played Algernon) recalled to Hesketh Pearson, &quot;In my fifty-three years of acting, I never remember a greater triumph than [that] first night.&quot; &quot;Earnest&quot;″s immediate reception as Wilde&#x27;s best work to date finally crystallised his fame into a solid artistic reputation. In a review of the play for &quot;The Pall Mall Gazette&quot; H. G. Wells wrote, &quot;More humorous dealing with theatrical conventions it would be difficult to imagine. Mr Oscar Wilde has decorated a humour that is Gilbertian with innumerable spangles of that wit that is all his own&quot;. &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; remains his most popular play.

Wilde&#x27;s professional success was mirrored by an escalation in his feud with Queensberry. Queensberry had planned to insult Wilde publicly by throwing a bouquet of rotting vegetables onto the stage; Wilde was tipped off and had Queensberry barred from entering the theatre. Fifteen weeks later Wilde was in prison.

== Trials ==
=== &quot;Wilde v Queensberry&quot; ===
On 18 February 1895, the Marquess of Queensberry left his calling card at Wilde&#x27;s club, the Albemarle, inscribed: &quot;For Oscar Wilde, posing somdomite&quot;. Wilde, encouraged by Douglas and against the advice of his friends, initiated a private prosecution against Queensberry for defamatory libel, since the note amounted to a public accusation that Wilde had committed the crime of sodomy.

Queensberry was arrested for criminal libel, a charge carrying a possible sentence of up to two years in prison. Under the Libel Act 1843, Queensberry could avoid conviction for libel only by demonstrating that his accusation was in fact true, and furthermore that there was some &quot;public benefit&quot; to having made the accusation openly. Queensberry&#x27;s lawyers thus hired private detectives to find evidence of Wilde&#x27;s homosexual liaisons.

Wilde&#x27;s friends had advised him against the prosecution at a &quot;Saturday Review&quot; meeting at the Café Royal on 24 March 1895; Frank Harris warned him that &quot;they are going to prove sodomy against you&quot; and advised him to flee to France. Wilde and Douglas walked out in a huff, Wilde saying &quot;it is at such moments as these that one sees who are one&#x27;s true friends&quot;. The scene was witnessed by George Bernard Shaw who recalled it to Arthur Ransome a day or so before Ransome&#x27;s trial for libelling Douglas in 1913. To Ransome it confirmed what he had said in his 1912 book on Wilde: that Douglas&#x27;s rivalry for Wilde with Robbie Ross and his arguments with his father had resulted in Wilde&#x27;s public disaster, as Wilde wrote in &quot;De Profundis&quot;. Douglas lost his case. Shaw included an account of the argument between Harris, Douglas and Wilde in the preface to his play &quot;The Dark Lady of the Sonnets&quot;.

The libel trial became a &quot;cause célèbre&quot; as salacious details of Wilde&#x27;s private life with Taylor and Douglas began to appear in the press. A team of private detectives had directed Queensberry&#x27;s lawyers, led by Edward Carson QC, to the world of the Victorian underground. Wilde&#x27;s association with blackmailers and male prostitutes, cross-dressers and homosexual brothels was recorded, and various persons involved were interviewed, some being coerced to appear as witnesses since they too were accomplices to the crimes of which Wilde was accused.
The trial opened at the Old Bailey in central London on 3 April 1895 before Mr. Justice Richard Henn Collins, a fellow Dubliner, amid scenes of near hysteria both in the press and the public galleries. The extent of the evidence massed against Wilde forced him to declare meekly, &quot;I am the prosecutor in this case&quot;. Wilde&#x27;s lawyer, Sir Edward Clarke, opened the case by pre-emptively asking Wilde about two suggestive letters Wilde had written to Douglas, which the defence had in its possession. He characterised the first as a &quot;prose sonnet&quot; and admitted that the &quot;poetical language&quot; might seem strange to the court but claimed its intent was innocent. Wilde stated that the letters had been obtained by blackmailers who had attempted to extort money from him, but he had refused, suggesting they should take the £60 () offered, &quot;unusual for a prose piece of that length&quot;. He claimed to regard the letters as works of art rather than something of which to be ashamed.

Carson, who was also a Dubliner who had attended Trinity College Dublin, at the same time as Wilde, cross-examined Wilde on how he perceived the moral content of his works. Wilde replied with characteristic wit and flippancy, claiming that works of art are not capable of being moral or immoral but only well or poorly made, and that only &quot;brutes and illiterates&quot;, whose views on art &quot;are incalculably stupid&quot;, would make such judgements about art. Carson, a leading barrister, diverged from the normal practice of asking closed questions. Carson pressed Wilde on each topic from every angle, squeezing out nuances of meaning from Wilde&#x27;s answers, removing them from their aesthetic context and portraying Wilde as evasive and decadent. While Wilde won the most laughs, Carson scored the most legal points. To undermine Wilde&#x27;s credibility, and to justify Queensberry&#x27;s description of Wilde as a &quot;posing somdomite&quot;, Carson drew from the witness an admission of his capacity for &quot;posing&quot;, by demonstrating that he had lied about his age under oath. Playing on this, he returned to the topic throughout his cross-examination. Carson also tried to justify Queensberry&#x27;s characterisation by quoting from Wilde&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;, referring in particular to a scene in the second chapter, in which Lord Henry Wotton explains his decadent philosophy to Dorian, an &quot;innocent young man&quot;, in Carson&#x27;s words.

Carson then moved to the factual evidence and questioned Wilde about his friendships with lower-class males, some of whom were as young as sixteen when Wilde had met them. Wilde admitted being on a first-name basis and lavishing gifts upon them, but insisted that nothing untoward had occurred and that the men were merely good friends of his. Carson repeatedly pointed out the unusual nature of these relationships and insinuated that the men were prostitutes. Wilde replied that he did not believe in social barriers, and simply enjoyed the society of young men. Then Carson asked Wilde directly whether he had ever kissed a certain servant boy, Wilde responded, &quot;Oh, dear no. He was a particularly plain boy – unfortunately ugly – I pitied him for it.&quot; Carson pressed him on the answer, repeatedly asking why the boy&#x27;s ugliness was relevant. Wilde hesitated, then for the first time became flustered: &quot;You sting me and insult me and try to unnerve me; and at times one says things flippantly when one ought to speak more seriously&quot;.

In his opening speech for the defence, Carson announced that he had located several male prostitutes who were to testify that they had had sex with Wilde. On the advice of his lawyers, Wilde dropped the prosecution. Queensberry was found not guilty, as the court declared that his accusation that Wilde was &quot;posing as a Somdomite &quot; was justified, &quot;true in substance and in fact&quot;. Under the Libel Act 1843, Queensberry&#x27;s acquittal rendered Wilde legally liable for the considerable expenses Queensberry had incurred in his defence, which left Wilde bankrupt.

=== &quot;Regina v Wilde&quot; ===
After Wilde left the court, a warrant for his arrest was applied for on charges of sodomy and gross indecency. Robbie Ross found Wilde at the Cadogan Hotel, Pont Street, Knightsbridge, with Reginald Turner. Both men advised Wilde to go at once to Dover and try to get a boat to France; his mother advised him to stay and fight. Wilde, lapsing into inaction, could only say, &quot;The train has gone. It&#x27;s too late.&quot; On 6 April 1895, Wilde was arrested for &quot;gross indecency&quot; under Section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885, a term meaning homosexual acts not amounting to buggery (an offence under a separate statute). At Wilde&#x27;s instruction, Ross and Wilde&#x27;s butler forced their way into the bedroom and library of 16 Tite Street, packing some personal effects, manuscripts, and letters. Wilde was then imprisoned on remand at Holloway, where he received daily visits from Douglas.

Events moved quickly and his prosecution opened on 26 April 1895, before Mr Justice Charles. Wilde pleaded not guilty. He had already begged Douglas to leave London for Paris, but Douglas complained bitterly, even wanting to give evidence; he was pressed to go and soon fled to the Hotel du Monde. Fearing persecution, Ross and many others also left the United Kingdom during this time. Under cross-examination, Wilde was at first hesitant, then spoke eloquently:


This response was counter-productive in a legal sense, for it only served to reinforce the charges of homosexual behaviour. The trial ended with the jury unable to reach a verdict. Wilde&#x27;s counsel, Sir Edward Clarke, was finally able to get a magistrate to allow Wilde and his friends to post bail. The Reverend Stewart Headlam put up most of the £5,000 surety required by the court, having disagreed with Wilde&#x27;s treatment by the press and the courts. Wilde was freed from Holloway and, shunning attention, went into hiding at the house of Ernest and Ada Leverson, two of his firm friends. Edward Carson approached Sir Frank Lockwood QC, the Solicitor General, and asked &quot;Can we not let up on the fellow now?&quot; Lockwood answered that he would like to do so, but feared that the case had become too politicised to be dropped.

The final trial was presided over by Mr Justice Wills. On 25 May 1895, Wilde and Alfred Taylor were convicted of gross indecency and sentenced to two years&#x27; hard labour. The judge described the sentence, the maximum allowed, as &quot;totally inadequate for a case such as this&quot;, and that the case was &quot;the worst case I have ever tried&quot;. Wilde&#x27;s response of &quot;And I? May I say nothing, my Lord?&quot; was drowned out in cries of &quot;Shame&quot; in the courtroom.

Although it is widely believed that the charges were related to Wilde&#x27;s consensual activities, &quot;The Trials of Oscar Wilde&quot;, which includes an original transcript of the libel trial (which came to light in 2000), suggests that he took advantage of teenagers. Antony Edmonds feels that Wilde would have faced prosecution today: &quot;For example, he certainly paid for sex with youths under the age of 18 which is a criminal offence. But even if his activities had led only to exposure and not to arrest, he would have been savagely pilloried in the media. Wilde was 39 when he seduced Alphonse Conway, and Conway was an inexperienced boy of 16&quot;. Another teenager who said he had engaged in sex acts with Wilde, Walter Grainger, who was 16 at the time, said Wilde had threatened him with &quot;very serious trouble&quot; if he told anyone about their relationship. Marriageable age (and the age of consent) in England was 16 at the time, having been 13 as recently as 1885: the Offences against the Person Act 1875 raised the age of consent to 13 years old, and a decade later, the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 raised the age of consent to 16 years old, just ten years before the trial.

== Imprisonment ==

Having been convicted in &quot;one of the first celebrity trials&quot;, Wilde was incarcerated from 25 May 1895 to 18 May 1897.

He first entered Newgate Prison in London for processing, then was moved to Pentonville Prison, where the &quot;hard labour&quot; to which he had been sentenced consisted of many hours of walking a treadmill and picking oakum (separating the fibres in scraps of old navy ropes), and where prisoners were allowed to read only the Bible and &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;.

A few months later he was moved to Wandsworth Prison in London. Inmates there also followed the regimen of &quot;hard labour, hard fare and a hard bed&quot;, which wore harshly on Wilde&#x27;s delicate health. In November he collapsed during chapel from illness and hunger. His right ear drum was ruptured in the fall, an injury that later contributed to his death. He spent two months in the infirmary.

Richard B. Haldane, the Liberal MP and reformer, visited Wilde and had him transferred in November to Reading Gaol, west of London on 23 November 1895. The transfer itself was the lowest point of his incarceration, as a crowd jeered and spat at him on the platform at Clapham Junction railway station (in 2019 a rainbow plaque was unveiled at the station recalling this event). He spent the remainder of his sentence at Reading, addressed and identified only as &quot;C.3.3&quot; – the occupant of the third cell on the third floor of C ward.

About five months after Wilde arrived at Reading Gaol, Charles Thomas Wooldridge, a trooper in the Royal Horse Guards, was brought to Reading to await his trial for murdering his wife on 29 March 1896; on 17 June Wooldridge was sentenced to death and returned to Reading for his execution, which took place on Tuesday, 7 July 1896 – the first hanging at Reading in 18 years. From Wooldridge&#x27;s hanging, Wilde later wrote &quot;The Ballad of Reading Gaol&quot;.

Wilde was not, at first, even allowed paper and pen, but Haldane eventually succeeded in allowing access to books and writing materials. Wilde requested, among others, the Bible in French; Italian and German grammars; some Ancient Greek texts; Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;; Joris-Karl Huysmans&#x27;s new French novel about Christian redemption, &quot;En route&quot;; and essays by St Augustine, Cardinal Newman and Walter Pater.

Between January and March 1897 Wilde wrote a 50,000-word letter to Douglas. He was not allowed to send it but was permitted to take it with him when released from prison. In reflective mode, Wilde coldly examines his career to date, how he had been a colourful &quot;agent provocateur&quot; in Victorian society, his art, like his paradoxes, seeking to subvert as well as sparkle. His estimation of himself was: one who &quot;stood in symbolic relations to the art and culture of my age&quot;. It was from these heights that his life with Douglas began, and Wilde examines that particularly closely, repudiating him for what Wilde finally sees as his arrogance and vanity: he had not forgotten Douglas&#x27; remark, when he was ill, &quot;When you are not on your pedestal you are not interesting.&quot; Wilde blamed himself, though, for the ethical degradation of character that he allowed Douglas to bring about in him, and took responsibility for his own fall: &quot;I am here for having tried to put your father in prison.&quot; The first half concludes with Wilde forgiving Douglas, for his own sake as much as Douglas&#x27;s. The second half of the letter traces Wilde&#x27;s spiritual journey of redemption and fulfilment through his prison reading. He realised that his ordeal had filled his soul with the fruit of experience, however bitter it tasted at the time.
 ... I wanted to eat of the fruit of all the trees in the garden of the world ... And so, indeed, I went out, and so I lived. My only mistake was that I confined myself so exclusively to the trees of what seemed to me the sun-lit side of the garden, and shunned the other side for its shadow and its gloom.
Wilde was released from prison on 19 May 1897 and sailed that evening for Dieppe, France. He never returned to the United Kingdom.

On his release, he gave the manuscript to Ross, who may or may not have carried out Wilde&#x27;s instructions to send a copy to Douglas (who later denied having received it). The letter was partially published in 1905 as &quot;De Profundis&quot;; its complete and correct publication first occurred in 1962 in &quot;The Letters of Oscar Wilde&quot;.

== Final years: 1897–1900 ==

=== Exile ===
Though Wilde&#x27;s health had suffered greatly from the harshness and diet of prison, he had a feeling of spiritual renewal. He immediately wrote to the Society of Jesus requesting a six-month Catholic retreat; when the request was denied, Wilde wept. &quot;I intend to be received into the Catholic Church before long&quot;, Wilde told a journalist who asked about his religious intentions.

He spent his last three years impoverished and in exile. He took the name &quot;Sebastian Melmoth&quot;, after Saint Sebastian and the titular character of &quot;Melmoth the Wanderer&quot; (a Gothic novel by Charles Maturin, Wilde&#x27;s great-uncle). Wilde wrote two long letters to the editor of the &quot;Daily Chronicle&quot;, describing the brutal conditions of English prisons and advocating penal reform. His discussion of the dismissal of Warder Martin for giving biscuits to an anaemic child prisoner repeated the themes of the corruption and degeneration of punishment that he had earlier outlined in &quot;The Soul of Man under Socialism&quot;.

Wilde spent mid-1897 with Robert Ross in the seaside village of Berneval-le-Grand in northern France, where he wrote &quot;The Ballad of Reading Gaol&quot;, narrating the execution of Charles Thomas Wooldridge, who murdered his wife in a rage at her infidelity. It moves from an objective story-telling to symbolic identification with the prisoners. No attempt is made to assess the justice of the laws which convicted them but rather the poem highlights the brutality of the punishment that all convicts share. Wilde juxtaposes the executed man and himself with the line &quot;Yet each man kills the thing he loves&quot;. He adopted the proletarian ballad form and the author was credited as &quot;C33&quot;, Wilde&#x27;s cell number in Reading Gaol. He suggested that it be published in &quot;Reynolds&#x27; Magazine&quot;, &quot;because it circulates widely among the criminal classes – to which I now belong – for once I will be read by my peers – a new experience for me&quot;. It was an immediate roaring commercial success, going through seven editions in less than two years, only after which &quot;[Oscar Wilde]&quot; was added to the title page, though many in literary circles had known Wilde to be the author.

Although Douglas had been the cause of his misfortunes, he and Wilde were reunited in August 1897 at Rouen. This meeting was disapproved of by the friends and families of both men. Constance Wilde was already refusing to meet Wilde or allow him to see their sons, though she sent him money – three pounds a week. During the latter part of 1897, Wilde and Douglas lived together near Naples for a few months until they were separated by their families under the threat of cutting off all funds.

Wilde&#x27;s final address was at the dingy Hôtel d&#x27;Alsace (now known as L&#x27;Hôtel), on rue des Beaux-Arts in Saint-Germain-des-Prés, Paris. &quot;This poverty really breaks one&#x27;s heart: it is so &quot;sale&quot; [filthy], so utterly depressing, so hopeless. Pray do what you can&quot; he wrote to his publisher. He corrected and published &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot; and &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;, the proofs of which, according to Ellmann, show a man &quot;very much in command of himself and of the play&quot;, but he refused to write anything else: &quot;I can write, but have lost the joy of writing&quot;.

He wandered the boulevards alone and spent what little money he had on alcohol. A series of embarrassing chance encounters with hostile English visitors, or Frenchmen he had known in better days, drowned his spirit. Soon Wilde was sufficiently confined to his hotel to joke, on one of his final trips outside, &quot;My wallpaper and I are fighting a duel to the death. One of us has got to go&quot;. On 12 October 1900 he sent a telegram to Ross: &quot;Terribly weak. Please come&quot;. His moods fluctuated; Max Beerbohm relates how their mutual friend Reginald &#x27;Reggie&#x27; Turner had found Wilde very depressed after a nightmare. &quot;I dreamt that I had died, and was supping with the dead!&quot; &quot;I am sure,&quot; Turner replied, &quot;that you must have been the life and soul of the party.&quot; In early 1900 in Sicily, Oscar Wilde became involved in a relationship with the 15 year old Giuseppe Loverde.

=== Death ===

By 25 November 1900, Wilde had developed meningitis, then called &quot;cerebral meningitis&quot;. Robbie Ross arrived on 29 November, sent for a priest, and Wilde was conditionally baptised into the Catholic Church by Fr Cuthbert Dunne, a Passionist priest from Dublin, Fr Dunne recorded the baptism:

 As the &quot;voiture&quot; rolled through the dark streets that wintry night, the sad story of Oscar Wilde was in part repeated to me... Robert Ross knelt by the bedside, assisting me as best he could while I administered conditional baptism, and afterwards answering the responses while I gave Extreme Unction to the prostrate man and recited the prayers for the dying. As the man was in a semi-comatose condition, I did not venture to administer the Holy Viaticum; still I must add that he could be roused and was roused from this state in my presence. When roused, he gave signs of being inwardly conscious... Indeed I was fully satisfied that he understood me when told that I was about to receive him into the Catholic Church and gave him the Last Sacraments... And when I repeated close to his ear the Holy Names, the Acts of Contrition, Faith, Hope and Charity, with acts of humble resignation to the Will of God, he tried all through to say the words after me.

Wilde died of meningitis on 30 November 1900. Different opinions are given as to the cause of the disease: Richard Ellmann judged it was syphilitic; Merlin Holland, Wilde&#x27;s grandson, thought this to be a misconception, noting that Wilde&#x27;s meningitis followed a surgical intervention, perhaps a mastoidectomy; Wilde&#x27;s physicians, Paul Cleiss and A&#x27;Court Tucker, reported that the condition stemmed from an old suppuration of the right ear (from the prison injury, see above) treated for several years (&quot;&quot;) and made no allusion to syphilis.

=== Burial ===


Wilde was initially buried in the Cimetière de Bagneux outside Paris; in 1909 his remains were disinterred and transferred to Père Lachaise Cemetery, inside the city. His tomb there was designed by Sir Jacob Epstein. It was commissioned by Robert Ross, who asked for a small compartment to be made for his own ashes, which were duly transferred in 1950. The modernist angel depicted as a relief on the tomb was originally complete with male genitalia, which were initially censored by French authorities with a golden leaf. The genitals have since been vandalised; their current whereabouts are unknown. In 2000, Leon Johnson, a multimedia artist, installed a silver prosthesis to replace them. In 2011, the tomb was cleaned of the many lipstick marks left there by admirers and a glass barrier was installed to prevent further marks or damage.

The epitaph is a verse from &quot;The Ballad of Reading Gaol&quot;,

&lt;poem&gt;
And alien tears will fill for him
Pity&#x27;s long-broken urn,
For his mourners will be outcast men,
And outcasts always mourn.
&lt;/poem&gt;

=== Posthumous pardon ===
In 2017, Wilde was among an estimated 50,000 men who were pardoned for homosexual acts that were no longer considered offences under the Policing and Crime Act 2017 (homosexuality was decriminalised in England and Wales in 1967). The 2017 Act implements what is known informally as the Alan Turing law.

=== Honours ===

On 14 February 1995, Wilde was commemorated with a stained-glass window at Poets&#x27; Corner in Westminster Abbey. The memorial, above the monument to Geoffrey Chaucer, was unveiled by his grandson Merlin Holland, while Sir John Gielgud read from the final part of &quot;De Profundis&quot; and Dame Judi Dench read an extract from &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;.

In 2014, Wilde was one of the inaugural honorees in the Rainbow Honor Walk, a walk of fame in San Francisco&#x27;s Castro neighbourhood noting LGBTQ people who have &quot;made significant contributions in their fields&quot;.

The Oscar Wilde Temple, an installation by visual artists McDermott &amp; McGough, opened in 2017 in cooperation with Church of the Village in New York City, then moved to Studio Voltaire in London the next year.

== Biographies ==

Wilde&#x27;s life has been the subject of numerous biographies since his death. The earliest were memoirs by those who knew him: often they are personal or impressionistic accounts which can be good character sketches but are sometimes factually unreliable. Frank Harris, his friend and editor, wrote a biography, &quot;Oscar Wilde: His Life and Confessions&quot; (1916); though prone to exaggeration and sometimes factually inaccurate, it offers a good literary portrait of Wilde. Lord Alfred Douglas wrote two books about his relationship with Wilde. &quot;Oscar Wilde and Myself&quot; (1914), largely ghost-written by T. W. H. Crosland, vindictively reacted to Douglas&#x27;s discovery that &quot;De Profundis&quot; was addressed to him and defensively tried to distance him from Wilde&#x27;s scandalous reputation. Both authors later regretted their work. Later, in &quot;Oscar Wilde: A Summing Up&quot; (1939) and his &quot;Autobiography&quot;, Douglas was more sympathetic to Wilde. Of Wilde&#x27;s other close friends, Robert Sherard; Robert Ross, his literary executor; and Charles Ricketts variously published biographies, reminiscences or correspondence. The first more or less objective biography of Wilde came about when Hesketh Pearson wrote &quot;Oscar Wilde: His Life and Wit&quot; (1946). In 1954 Wilde&#x27;s son Vyvyan Holland published his memoir &quot;Son of Oscar Wilde&quot;, which recounts the difficulties Wilde&#x27;s wife and children faced after his imprisonment. It was revised and updated by Merlin Holland in 1989.


&quot;Oscar Wilde: A Critical Study&quot; by Arthur Ransome was published in 1912. The book only briefly mentioned Wilde&#x27;s life, but subsequently, Ransome (and The Times Book Club) were sued for libel by Lord Alfred Douglas. At the High Court in London in April 1913, Douglas lost the libel action after a reading of &quot;De Profundis&quot; refuted his claims.

Richard Ellmann wrote his 1987 biography &quot;Oscar Wilde&quot;, for which he posthumously won a National (US) Book Critics Circle Award in 1988 and a Pulitzer Prize in 1989. In 1997, it was the basis for the British film &quot;Wilde&quot;, directed by Brian Gilbert and starring Stephen Fry as the title character.

Neil McKenna&#x27;s 2003 biography, &quot;The Secret Life of Oscar Wilde&quot;, offers an exploration of Wilde&#x27;s sexuality. Often speculative in nature, it was widely criticised for its pure conjecture and lack of scholarly rigour. Thomas Wright&#x27;s &quot;Oscar&#x27;s Books&quot; (2008) explores Wilde&#x27;s reading from his childhood in Dublin to his death in Paris. After tracking down many books that once belonged to Wilde&#x27;s Tite Street library (dispersed at the time of his trials), Wright was the first to examine Wilde&#x27;s marginalia.

In 2018, Matthew Sturgis&#x27; &quot;Oscar: A Life&quot;, was published in London. The book incorporates rediscovered letters and other documents and is the most extensively researched biography of Wilde to appear since 1988. Rupert Everett starred as Wilde in, and wrote the screenplay for, &quot;The Happy Prince&quot; (2018), a biographical drama film about Wilde following his release from prison.

Parisian literati also produced several biographies and monographs on him. André Gide wrote &quot;In Memoriam, Oscar Wilde&quot; and Wilde also features in his journals. Thomas Louis, who had earlier translated books on Wilde into French, produced his own &quot;L&#x27;esprit d&#x27;Oscar Wilde&quot; in 1920. Modern books include Philippe Jullian&#x27;s &quot;Oscar Wilde&quot;, and &quot;L&#x27;affaire Oscar Wilde, ou, Du danger de laisser la justice mettre le nez dans nos draps&quot; (&quot;The Oscar Wilde Affair, or, On the Danger of Allowing Justice to put its Nose in our Sheets&quot;) by , a French religious historian.

<text>Ostracism (, &quot;ostrakismos&quot;) was an Athenian democratic procedure in which any citizen could be expelled from the city-state of Athens for ten years. While some instances clearly expressed popular anger at the citizen, ostracism was often used preemptively. It was used as a way of neutralizing someone thought to be a threat to the state or a potential tyrant, though in many cases popular opinion often informed the expulsion. The word 
&quot;&quot; continues to be used for various forms of shunning.

==Procedure==
The term &quot;ostracism&quot; is derived from the pottery shards that were used as voting tokens, called &quot;ostraka&quot; (singular: &quot;ostrakon&quot; ) in Greek. Broken pottery, abundant and virtually free, served as a kind of scrap paper (in contrast to papyrus, which was imported from Egypt as a high-quality writing surface, and too costly to be disposable).

Each year the Athenians were asked in the assembly whether they wished to hold an ostracism. The question was put in the sixth of the ten months used for state business under the democracy (January or February in the modern Gregorian calendar). The process of ostracism could be divided into five elements according to Philochorus: 1) It was a two-stage process, 2) it was open to all Athens citizens, 3) it was overseen by outside officials, 4) must meet a specific quorum, 5) regulated penalties.

The majority of citizen must come to a unified agreement to start the procedures of Ostracism. If they voted &quot;yes&quot;, then an ostracism would be held two months later. In a section of the agora set off and suitably barriered that was called perischoinisma (περισχοίνισμα), citizens gave the name of those they wished to be ostracized to a scribe, as many of them were illiterate, and they then scratched the name on pottery shards. The shards were piled up facing down, so the votes would remain anonymous. Ostracism served as a political tool to eliminate rivals. It also helped to reflect the Athenians&#x27; belief in the importance of civic engagement and the power of collective decision making. Nine &quot;Archontes&quot; and the council of the five hundred supervised the process while the &quot;Archontes&quot; counted the &quot;ostraka&quot; submitted and sorted the names into separate piles. The person whose pile contained the most &quot;ostraka&quot; would be banished, provided that a quorum was met. According to Plutarch, the ostracism was considered valid if the total number of votes cast was at least 6,000; according to a fragment of Philochorus, at least 6,000 votes had to be cast against the person who was to be banished. Plutarch&#x27;s evidence for a quorum of 6,000 agrees with the number required for grants of citizenship in the following century and is generally preferred.

The person newly ostracized had ten days to leave the city. If he attempted to return, the penalty was death. The property of the man banished was not confiscated and there was no loss of status. After ten years, he was allowed to return without stigma. It was possible for the assembly to recall an ostracized person ahead of time; before the Persian invasion of 479 BC, an amnesty was declared under which at least two ostracised leaders—Pericles&#x27; father, Xanthippus, and Aristides &#x27;the Just&#x27;—are known to have returned. Similarly, Cimon, ostracised in 461 BC, was recalled during an emergency.

==History==
Ostracism was not in use throughout the entire period of Athenian democracy (circa 506–322 BC), but only occurred in the fifth century BC. The standard account, found in Aristotle&#x27;s Constitution of the Athenians 22.3, attributes the establishment to Cleisthenes, a pivotal reformer in the creation of the democracy. In that case, ostracism would have been in place from around 506 BC. The first victim of the practice was not expelled until 487 BC—nearly 20 years later. Over the course of the next 60 years some 12 or more individuals followed him. The list may not be complete. The list of known ostracisms is as follows:

*487 Hipparchos son of Charmos, a relative of the tyrant Peisistratos
*486 Megacles son of Hippocrates; Cleisthenes&#x27; nephew (possibly ostracised twice)
*485 Kallixenos nephew of Cleisthenes (not known for certain)
*484 Xanthippus son of Ariphron, Pericles&#x27; father
*482 Aristides son of Lysimachus
*471 Themistocles son of Neocles (last possible year)
*461 Cimon son of Miltiades
*460 Alcibiades, father of Cleinias (possibly ostracised twice)
*457 Menon son of Meneclides (less certain)
*442 Thucydides son of Melesias
*440s Callias son of Didymos (less certain)
*440s Damon son of Damonides (less certain)
*416 Hyperbolus son of Antiphanes (±1 year)

Around 12,000 political ostraka have been excavated in the Athenian agora and in the Kerameikos. The second victim, Cleisthenes&#x27; nephew Megacles, is named by 4647 of these, but for a second undated ostracism not listed above. The known ostracisms seem to fall into three distinct phases: the 480s BC, mid-century 461–443 BC and finally the years 417–415: this roughly correlates with the clustering of known expulsions, although Themistocles before 471 may count as an exception. This may suggest that ostracism fell in and out of fashion.

The last known ostracism was that of Hyperbolus in circa 417 BC. There is no sign of its use after the Peloponnesian War, when democracy was restored after the oligarchic coup of the Thirty had collapsed in 403 BC. However, while ostracism was not an active feature of the fourth-century version of democracy, it remained; the question was put to the assembly each year, but they did not wish to hold one.

==Distinction from other Athenian democratic processes==
Ostracism was crucially different from Athenian law at the time; there was no charge and no defense could be mounted by the person expelled. The two stages of the procedure ran in the reverse order from that used under almost any trial system—it is as if a jury were first asked &quot;Do you want to find someone guilty?&quot;, and subsequently asked &quot;Whom do you wish to accuse?&quot;. The judicial framework is perhaps the institution&#x27;s most peculiar feature: it can take place at most once a year, and only for one person. It resembles the Greek &quot;pharmakos&quot; or scapegoat—though in contrast, &quot;pharmakos&quot; generally ejected a lowly member of the community.

A further distinction between these two modes (and not obvious from a modern perspective) is that ostracism was an automatic procedure that required no initiative from any individual, with the vote simply occurring on the wish of the electorate—a diffuse exercise of power. By contrast, an Athenian trial needed the initiative of a particular citizen-prosecutor. While prosecution often led to a counterattack (or was a counterattack itself), no such response was possible in the case of ostracism as responsibility lay with the polity as a whole. In contrast to a trial, ostracism generally reduced political tension rather than increased it.

Although ten years of exile may have been challenging for Athenians, it was a lenient punishment compared to the sentences that courts could impose. When dealing with politicians held to be acting against the interests of the people, Athenian juries could inflict severe penalties such as death, unpayably large fines, confiscation of property, permanent exile, or loss of citizens&#x27; rights through &quot;atimia&quot;.&quot;&quot; Further, the elite Athenians who suffered ostracism were rich or noble men who had connections or &quot;xenoi&quot; in the wider Greek world and who, unlike genuine exiles, were able to access their income in Attica from abroad. In Plutarch, following the anti-democratic thought common in elite sources, people might be recalled early, thus being an example of the inconsistency of majoritarianism characteristic of Athenian democracy. However, ten years of exile usually resolved whatever had prompted the expulsion. Ostracism was a pragmatic measure; the concept of serving out the full sentence did not apply as it was a preventive measure, not a punitive one.

An example of the practicalities of ostracism comes from the cache of 190 ostraka discovered dumped in a well next to the acropolis. From the handwriting, they appear to have been written by fourteen individuals and bear the name of Themistocles, ostracised before 471 BC, and were evidently meant for distribution to voters. This was not necessarily evidence of electoral fraud (being no worse than modern voting instruction cards), but their being dumped in the well may suggest that their creators wished to hide them. If so, these ostraka provide an example of organized groups attempting to influence the outcome of ostracisms. The two-month gap between the first and second phases would have allowed for such a campaign.

There is another interpretation, however, according to which these ostraka were prepared beforehand by enterprising businessmen who offered them for sale to citizens who could not easily inscribe the desired names for themselves or who simply wished to save time.

The two-month gap is a key feature in the institution, much as in elections under modern liberal democracies. It prevented the candidate for expulsion being chosen out of immediate anger, although an Athenian general such as Cimon would have not wanted to lose a battle the week before such a second vote. It opened a period for discussion (or perhaps agitation), whether informally in daily talk or public speeches before the Athenian assembly or Athenian courts. In this process a consensus, or rival consensuses, might emerge.

==Purpose==
Because ostracism was carried out by thousands of people over many decades of an evolving political situation and culture, it did not serve one monolithic purpose. Observations can be made about the outcomes, as well as the initial purpose for which it was created.

The first instance of people ostracized in the decade after the defeat of the first Persian invasion at Marathon in 490 BC were related or connected to the tyrant Peisistratos, who had controlled Athens for 36 years up to 527 BC. After his son Hippias was deposed with Spartan help in 510 BC, the family sought refuge with the Persians. Nearly twenty years later Hippias landed with an invasion force at Marathon. Tyranny and Persian aggression were paired threats facing the new democratic regime at Athens, and ostracism was used against both.

Tyranny and democracy had arisen at Athens out of clashes between regional and factional groups organized around politicians, including Cleisthenes. As a reaction, in many of its features the democracy strove to reduce the role of factions as the focus of citizen loyalties. Ostracism may have been intended to work in the same to similar ends: by temporarily decapitating a faction, it could help defuse confrontations that threatened the order of the State.

In later decades when the threat of tyranny was remote, ostracism seems to have been used to decide between radically opposed policies. For instance, in 443 BC Thucydides, son of Melesias (not to be confused with the historian of the same name) was ostracized. He led an aristocratic opposition to Athenian imperialism and in particular to Pericles&#x27; building program on the acropolis, which was funded by taxes created for the wars against the Achaemenid Empire. By expelling Thucydides the Athenian people sent a clear message about the direction of Athenian policy. Similar but controversial claims have been made about the ostracism of Cimon in 461 BC.

The motives of individual voting citizens cannot be known. Many of the surviving ostraka name people otherwise unattested. They may well be just someone the submitter disliked, and voted for in a moment of private spite. Some ostraka bear the word &quot;Limos&quot; (hunger) instead of a human name. As such, it may be seen as a secular, civic variant of Athenian curse tablets, studied in scholarly literature under the Latin name &quot;defixiones&quot;, where small dolls were wrapped in lead sheets written with curses and then buried, sometimes stuck through with nails for good measure.

In one anecdote about Aristides, known as &quot;the Just&quot;, who was ostracised in 482, an illiterate citizen, not recognising him, asked him to write the name Aristides on his ostrakon. When Aristides asked why, the man replied it was because he was sick of hearing him being called &quot;the Just&quot;. Perhaps merely the sense that someone had become too arrogant or prominent was enough to get someone&#x27;s name onto an ostrakon. Ostracism rituals could have also been an attempt to dissuade people from covertly committing murder or assassination of intolerable or emerging individuals of power so as to create an open arena or outlet for those harbouring primal frustrations and urges or political motivations. The solution for murder, in Gregory H. Padowitz&#x27;s theory, would then be &quot;ostracism&quot; which would ultimately be beneficial for all parties—the ostracised individual would live and get a second chance and society would be spared feuds, civil war, political tensions and/or murder.

==Fall into disuse==
The last ostracism, that of Hyperbolos in or near 417 BC, is narrated by Plutarch in three separate &quot;lives&quot;: Hyperbolos is pictured urging the people to expel one of his rivals, but they, Nicias and Alcibiades, laying aside their hostility for a moment, use their influence to have him ostracised instead. According to Plutarch, the people then become disgusted with ostracism and abandoned the procedure forever.

In part ostracism lapsed as a procedure at the end of the fifth century because it was replaced by the &quot;graphe paranomon&quot;, a regular court action under which a much larger number of politicians might be targeted, instead of just one a year as with ostracism, and with greater severity.

It may already seemed like an anachronism as factional alliances organised around important men became less significant and power was more specifically located in the interaction of the individual speaker with the power of the assembly and the courts. The threat to the democratic system in the late fifth century came not from tyranny but from oligarchic coups, threats of which became prominent after two brief seizures of power, in 411 BC by &quot;the Four Hundred&quot; and in 404 BC by &quot;the Thirty&quot;, which were not dependent on single powerful individuals. Ostracism was not an effective defence against the oligarchic threat and it was not so used.

==Analogues==
Other cities are known to have set up forms of ostracism on the Athenian model, namely Megara, Miletos, Argos and Syracuse, Sicily. In the last of these it was referred to as &quot;petalismos&quot;, because the names were written on olive leaves. Little is known about these institutions. Furthermore, pottery shards identified as &quot;ostraka&quot; have been found in Chersonesos Taurica, leading historians to the conclusion that a similar institution existed there as well, in spite of the silence of the ancient records on that count.

A similar modern practice is the recall election, in which the electoral body removes its representation from an elected officer.

Unlike under modern voting procedures, the Athenians did not have to adhere to a strict format for the inscribing of &quot;ostraka&quot;. Many extant &quot;ostraka&quot; show that it was possible to write expletives, short epigrams or cryptic injunctions beside the name of the candidate without invalidating the vote. For example:
* Kallixenes, son of Aristonimos, &quot;the traitor&quot;
* Archen, &quot;lover of foreigners&quot;
* Agasias, &quot;the donkey&quot;
* Megacles, &quot;the adulterer&quot;

==Modern usage==
Ostracism is evident in several animal species, as well as in modern human interactions. The social psychologist Kipling Williams defines ostracism as &quot;any act or acts of ignoring and excluding of an individual or groups by an individual or a group&quot; without necessarily involving &quot;acts of verbal or physical abuse&quot;.

Williams suggests that the most common form of ostracism is silent treatment, wherein refusing to communicate with a person effectively ignores and excludes them.

=== Computer networks ===
Ostracism in the context of computer networks (such as the Internet) is termed &quot;cyberostracism&quot;. In email communication, in particular, it is relatively easy to engage in silent treatment, in the form of &quot;unanswered emails&quot; or &quot;ignored emails&quot;. Being ostracised on social media is seen to be threatening to the fundamental human needs of belonging, self-esteem, control and meaningful existence. Cyber-rejection (receiving &quot;dislikes&quot;) caused more threat to the need of belonging and self-esteem, and lead to social withdrawal. Cyber-ostracism (being ignored or receiving fewer &quot;likes&quot;) conversely lead to more prosocial behavior. Ostracism is thought to be associated with social media disorder.

=== Reactions ===
Williams and his colleagues have charted responses to ostracism in some five thousand cases, and found two distinctive patterns of response. The first is increased group-conformity, in a quest for re-admittance; the second is to become more provocative and hostile to the group, seeking attention rather than acceptance.

=== Age ===
Older adults report experiencing ostracism less frequently, with a particular dip being around the age of retirement. Regardless of age, ostracism is strongly associated with negative emotions, reduced life satisfaction and dysfunctional social behaviour.

===Whistleblowing===
Research suggests that ostracism is a common retaliatory strategy used by organizations in response to whistleblowing. Kipling Williams, in a survey on US whistleblowers, found that all respondents reported post-whistleblowing ostracism. Alexander Brown similarly found that post-whistleblowing ostracism is a common response, and indeed describes ostracism as form of &quot;&quot; reprisal, as it is normally so difficult to identify and investigate.

===Qahr and ashti===
Qahr and ashti is a culture-specific Iranian form of personal shunning, most frequently of another family member in Iran. While modern Western concepts of ostracism are based upon enforcing conformity within a societally-recognized group, qahr is a private (batini), family-orientated affair of conflict or display of anger that is never disclosed to the public at large, as to do so would be a breach of social etiquette.

&quot;Qahr&quot; is avoidance of a lower-ranking family member who has committed a perceived insult. It is one of several ritualised social customs of Iranian culture.

&quot;Gozasht&quot; means &#x27;tolerance, understanding and a desire or willingness to forgive&#x27; and is an essential component of Qahr and Ashti for the psychological needs of closure and cognition, as well as a culturally accepted source for practicing necessary religious requirements of &quot;tawbah&quot; &quot;(repentance, see Koran 2:222)&quot; and &quot;du&#x27;a&quot; (supplication).

<text>Omega (, ; uppercase Ω, lowercase ω; Ancient Greek ὦ, later ὦ μέγα, Modern Greek ωμέγα) is the twenty-fourth and last letter in the Greek alphabet. In the Greek numeric system/isopsephy (gematria), it has a value of 800. The word literally means &quot;great O&quot; (&quot;o mega&quot;, mega meaning &quot;great&quot;), as opposed to omicron, which means &quot;little O&quot; (&quot;o mikron&quot;, micron meaning &quot;little&quot;).

In phonetic terms, the Ancient Greek Ω represented a long open-mid back rounded vowel , comparable to the &quot;aw&quot; of the English word &quot;raw&quot; in dialects without the cot–caught merger, in contrast to omicron which represented the close-mid back rounded vowel , and the digraph &quot;ου&quot; which represented the long close-mid back rounded vowel . In Modern Greek, both omega and omicron represent the mid back rounded vowel or . The letter omega is transliterated into a Latin-script alphabet as &quot;ō&quot; or simply &quot;o&quot;.

As the final letter in the Greek alphabet, omega is often used to denote the last, the end, or the ultimate limit of a set, in contrast to alpha, the first letter of the Greek alphabet; see Alpha and Omega.

==History==
Ω was not part of the early (8th century BC) Greek alphabets. It was introduced in the late 7th century BC in the Ionian cities of Asia Minor to denote a long open-mid back rounded vowel . It is a variant of omicron (Ο), broken up at the side (), with the edges subsequently turned outward (, , , ).
The Dorian city of Knidos as well as a few Aegean islands, namely Paros, Thasos and Melos, chose the exact opposite innovation, using a broken-up circle for the short and a closed circle for the long .

The name Ωμέγα is Byzantine; in Classical Greek, the letter was called &quot;ō&quot; () (pronounced /ɔ̂ː/), whereas the omicron was called &quot;ou&quot; () (pronounced /ôː/). 
The modern lowercase shape goes back to the uncial form , a form that developed during the 3rd century BC in ancient handwriting on papyrus, from a flattened-out form of the letter () that had its edges curved even further upward.

In addition to the Greek alphabet, Omega was also adopted into the early Cyrillic alphabet (see Cyrillic omega (Ѡ, ѡ)). A Raetic variant is conjectured to be at the origin or parallel evolution of the Elder Futhark ᛟ.

Omega was also adopted into the Latin alphabet, as a letter of the 1982 revision to the African reference alphabet. It&#x27;s in sparse use (see Latin omega).

== The symbol Ω (uppercase letter) ==
The uppercase letter Ω is used as a symbol:
* In chemistry:
** For oxygen-18, a natural, stable isotope of oxygen
** For omega loop, a protein structural motif consisting of a loop of six or more amino acid residues in any sequence, a structure named for its resemblance to the Greek letter.
* In physics:
** For ohm – SI unit of electrical resistance; formerly also used upside down (℧) to represent mho, the old name for the inverse of an ohm (now siemens with symbol S) used for electrical conductance. Unicode has a separate code point (HTML entity codice_1), but it is included only for backward compatibility, and the canonically equivalent code point (codice_2) is preferred.
** In statistical mechanics, Ω refers to the multiplicity (number of microstates) in a system.
