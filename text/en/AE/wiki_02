<text>Mechanical engineering is the study of physical machines that may involve force and movement. It is an engineering branch that combines engineering physics and mathematics principles with materials science, to design, analyze, manufacture, and maintain mechanical systems. It is one of the oldest and broadest of the engineering branches.

Mechanical engineering requires an understanding of core areas including mechanics, dynamics, thermodynamics, materials science, design, structural analysis, and electricity. In addition to these core principles, mechanical engineers use tools such as computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), computer-aided engineering (CAE), and product lifecycle management to design and analyze manufacturing plants, industrial equipment and machinery, heating and cooling systems, transport systems, motor vehicles, aircraft, watercraft, robotics, medical devices, weapons, and others.

Mechanical engineering emerged as a field during the Industrial Revolution in Europe in the 18th century; however, its development can be traced back several thousand years around the world. In the 19th century, developments in physics led to the development of mechanical engineering science. The field has continually evolved to incorporate advancements; today mechanical engineers are pursuing developments in such areas as composites, mechatronics, and nanotechnology. It also overlaps with aerospace engineering, metallurgical engineering, civil engineering, structural engineering, electrical engineering, manufacturing engineering, chemical engineering, industrial engineering, and other engineering disciplines to varying amounts. Mechanical engineers may also work in the field of biomedical engineering, specifically with biomechanics, transport phenomena, biomechatronics, bionanotechnology, and modelling of biological systems.

==History==
The application of mechanical engineering can be seen in the archives of various ancient and medieval societies. The six classic simple machines were known in the ancient Near East. The wedge and the inclined plane (ramp) were known since prehistoric times. Mesopotamian civilization is credited with the invention of the wheel by several, mainly old sources. However, some recent sources either suggest that it was invented independently in both Mesopotamia and Eastern Europe or credit prehistoric Eastern Europeans with the invention of the wheel The lever mechanism first appeared around 5,000 years ago in the Near East, where it was used in a simple balance scale, and to move large objects in ancient Egyptian technology. The lever was also used in the shadoof water-lifting device, the first crane machine, which appeared in Mesopotamia circa 3000 BC. The earliest evidence of pulleys date back to Mesopotamia in the early 2nd millennium BC.

The Saqiyah was developed in the Kingdom of Kush during the 4th century BC. It relied on animal power reducing the tow on the requirement of human energy. Reservoirs in the form of Hafirs were developed in Kush to store water and boost irrigation. Bloomeries and blast furnaces were developed during the seventh century BC in Meroe. Kushite sundials applied mathematics in the form of advanced trigonometry.

The earliest practical water-powered machines, the water wheel and watermill, first appeared in the Persian Empire, in what are now Iraq and Iran, by the early 4th century BC. In ancient Greece, the works of Archimedes (287–212 BC) influenced mechanics in the Western tradition. The geared Antikythera mechanisms was an Analog computer invented around the 2nd century BC.

In Roman Egypt, Heron of Alexandria (c. 10–70 AD) created the first steam-powered device (Aeolipile). In China, Zhang Heng (78–139 AD) improved a water clock and invented a seismometer, and Ma Jun (200–265 AD) invented a chariot with differential gears. The medieval Chinese horologist and engineer Su Song (1020–1101 AD) incorporated an escapement mechanism into his astronomical clock tower two centuries before escapement devices were found in medieval European clocks. He also invented the world&#x27;s first known endless power-transmitting chain drive.

The cotton gin was invented in India by the 6th century AD, and the spinning wheel was invented in the Islamic world by the early 11th century, Dual-roller gins appeared in India and China between the 12th and 14th centuries. The worm gear roller gin appeared in the Indian subcontinent during the early Delhi Sultanate era of the 13th to 14th centuries.

During the Islamic Golden Age (7th to 15th century), Muslim inventors made remarkable contributions in the field of mechanical technology. Al-Jazari, who was one of them, wrote his famous &quot;Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices&quot; in 1206 and presented many mechanical designs.

In the 17th century, important breakthroughs in the foundations of mechanical engineering occurred in England and the Continent. The Dutch mathematician and physicist Christiaan Huygens invented the pendulum clock in 1657, which was the first reliable timekeeper for almost 300 years, and published a work dedicated to clock designs and the theory behind them. In England, Isaac Newton formulated Newton&#x27;s Laws of Motion and developed the calculus, which would become the mathematical basis of physics. Newton was reluctant to publish his works for years, but he was finally persuaded to do so by his colleagues, such as Edmond Halley. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, who earlier designed a mechanical calculator, is also credited with developing the calculus during the same time period.

During the early 19th century Industrial Revolution, machine tools were developed in England, Germany, and Scotland. This allowed mechanical engineering to develop as a separate field within engineering. They brought with them manufacturing machines and the engines to power them. The first British professional society of mechanical engineers was formed in 1847 Institution of Mechanical Engineers, thirty years after the civil engineers formed the first such professional society Institution of Civil Engineers. On the European continent, Johann von Zimmermann (1820–1901) founded the first factory for grinding machines in Chemnitz, Germany in 1848.

In the United States, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) was formed in 1880, becoming the third such professional engineering society, after the American Society of Civil Engineers (1852) and the American Institute of Mining Engineers (1871). The first schools in the United States to offer an engineering education were the United States Military Academy in 1817, an institution now known as Norwich University in 1819, and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1825. Education in mechanical engineering has historically been based on a strong foundation in mathematics and science.

==Education==

Degrees in mechanical engineering are offered at various universities worldwide. Mechanical engineering programs typically take four to five years of study depending on the place and university and result in a Bachelor of Engineering (B.Eng. or B.E.), Bachelor of Science (B.Sc. or B.S.), Bachelor of Science Engineering (B.Sc.Eng.), Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.), Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering (B.M.E.), or Bachelor of Applied Science (B.A.Sc.) degree, in or with emphasis in mechanical engineering. In Spain, Portugal and most of South America, where neither B.S. nor B.Tech. programs have been adopted, the formal name for the degree is &quot;Mechanical Engineer&quot;, and the course work is based on five or six years of training. In Italy the course work is based on five years of education, and training, but in order to qualify as an Engineer one has to pass a state exam at the end of the course. In Greece, the coursework is based on a five-year curriculum.

In the United States, most undergraduate mechanical engineering programs are accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) to ensure similar course requirements and standards among universities. The ABET web site lists 302 accredited mechanical engineering programs as of 11 March 2014. Mechanical engineering programs in Canada are accredited by the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB), and most other countries offering engineering degrees have similar accreditation societies.

In Australia, mechanical engineering degrees are awarded as Bachelor of Engineering (Mechanical) or similar nomenclature, although there are an increasing number of specialisations. The degree takes four years of full-time study to achieve. To ensure quality in engineering degrees, Engineers Australia accredits engineering degrees awarded by Australian universities in accordance with the global Washington Accord. Before the degree can be awarded, the student must complete at least 3 months of on the job work experience in an engineering firm. Similar systems are also present in South Africa and are overseen by the Engineering Council of South Africa (ECSA).

In India, to become an engineer, one needs to have an engineering degree like a B.Tech. or B.E., have a diploma in engineering, or by completing a course in an engineering trade like fitter from the Industrial Training Institute (ITIs) to receive a &quot;ITI Trade Certificate&quot; and also pass the All India Trade Test (AITT) with an engineering trade conducted by the National Council of Vocational Training (NCVT) by which one is awarded a &quot;National Trade Certificate&quot;. A similar system is used in Nepal.

Some mechanical engineers go on to pursue a postgraduate degree such as a Master of Engineering, Master of Technology, Master of Science, Master of Engineering Management (M.Eng.Mgt. or M.E.M.), a Doctor of Philosophy in engineering (Eng.D. or Ph.D.) or an engineer&#x27;s degree. The master&#x27;s and engineer&#x27;s degrees may or may not include research. The Doctor of Philosophy includes a significant research component and is often viewed as the entry point to academia. The Engineer&#x27;s degree exists at a few institutions at an intermediate level between the master&#x27;s degree and the doctorate.

===Coursework===
Standards set by each country&#x27;s accreditation society are intended to provide uniformity in fundamental subject material, promote competence among graduating engineers, and to maintain confidence in the engineering profession as a whole. Engineering programs in the U.S., for example, are required by ABET to show that their students can &quot;work professionally in both thermal and mechanical systems areas.&quot; The specific courses required to graduate, however, may differ from program to program. Universities and institutes of technology will often combine multiple subjects into a single class or split a subject into multiple classes, depending on the faculty available and the university&#x27;s major area(s) of research.

The fundamental subjects required for mechanical engineering usually include:
* Mathematics (in particular, calculus, differential equations, and linear algebra)
* Basic physical sciences (including physics and chemistry)
* Statics and dynamics
* Strength of materials and solid mechanics
* Materials engineering, composites
* Thermodynamics, heat transfer, energy conversion, and HVAC
* Fuels, combustion, internal combustion engine
* Fluid mechanics (including fluid statics and fluid dynamics)
* Mechanism and Machine design (including kinematics and dynamics)
* Instrumentation and measurement
* Manufacturing engineering, technology, or processes
* Vibration, control theory and control engineering
* Hydraulics and Pneumatics
* Mechatronics and robotics
* Engineering design and product design
* Drafting, computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM)

Mechanical engineers are also expected to understand and be able to apply basic concepts from chemistry, physics, tribology, chemical engineering, civil engineering, and electrical engineering. All mechanical engineering programs include multiple semesters of mathematical classes including calculus, and advanced mathematical concepts including differential equations, partial differential equations, linear algebra, differential geometry, and statistics, among others.

In addition to the core mechanical engineering curriculum, many mechanical engineering programs offer more specialized programs and classes, such as control systems, robotics, transport and logistics, cryogenics, fuel technology, automotive engineering, biomechanics, vibration, optics and others, if a separate department does not exist for these subjects.

Most mechanical engineering programs also require varying amounts of research or community projects to gain practical problem-solving experience. In the United States it is common for mechanical engineering students to complete one or more internships while studying, though this is not typically mandated by the university. Cooperative education is another option. Future work skills research puts demand on study components that feed student&#x27;s creativity and innovation.

==Job duties==
Mechanical engineers research, design, develop, build, and test mechanical and thermal devices, including tools, engines, and machines.

Mechanical engineers typically do the following:
* Analyze problems to see how mechanical and thermal devices might help solve the problem.
* Design or redesign mechanical and thermal devices using analysis and computer-aided design.
* Develop and test prototypes of devices they design.
* Analyze the test results and change the design as needed.
* Oversee the manufacturing process for the device.
* Manage a team of professionals in specialized fields like mechanical drafting and designing, prototyping, 3D printing or/and CNC Machines specialists.

Mechanical engineers design and oversee the manufacturing of many products ranging from medical devices to new batteries. They also design power-producing machines such as electric generators, internal combustion engines, and steam and gas turbines as well as power-using machines, such as refrigeration and air-conditioning systems.

Like other engineers, mechanical engineers use computers to help create and analyze designs, run simulations and test how a machine is likely to work.

===License and regulation===
Engineers may seek license by a state, provincial, or national government. The purpose of this process is to ensure that engineers possess the necessary technical knowledge, real-world experience, and knowledge of the local legal system to practice engineering at a professional level. Once certified, the engineer is given the title of Professional Engineer United States, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Bangladesh and South Africa), Chartered Engineer (in the United Kingdom, Ireland, India and Zimbabwe), &quot;Chartered Professional Engineer&quot; (in Australia and New Zealand) or &quot;European Engineer&quot; (much of the European Union).

In the U.S., to become a licensed Professional Engineer (PE), an engineer must pass the comprehensive FE (Fundamentals of Engineering) exam, work a minimum of 4 years as an &quot;Engineering Intern (EI)&quot; or &quot;Engineer-in-Training (EIT)&quot;, and pass the &quot;Principles and Practice&quot; or PE (Practicing Engineer or Professional Engineer) exams. The requirements and steps of this process are set forth by the National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying (NCEES), composed of engineering and land surveying licensing boards representing all U.S. states and territories.

In Australia (Queensland and Victoria) an engineer must be registered as a Professional Engineer within the State in which they practice, for example Registered Professional Engineer of Queensland or Victoria, RPEQ or RPEV. respectively.

In the UK, current graduates require a BEng plus an appropriate master&#x27;s degree or an integrated MEng degree, a minimum of 4 years post graduate on the job competency development and a peer-reviewed project report to become a Chartered Mechanical Engineer (CEng, MIMechE) through the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. CEng MIMechE can also be obtained via an examination route administered by the City and Guilds of London Institute.

In most developed countries, certain engineering tasks, such as the design of bridges, electric power plants, and chemical plants, must be approved by a professional engineer or a chartered engineer. &quot;Only a licensed engineer, for instance, may prepare, sign, seal and submit engineering plans and drawings to a public authority for approval, or to seal engineering work for public and private clients.&quot; This requirement can be written into state and provincial legislation, such as in the Canadian provinces, for example the Ontario or Quebec&#x27;s Engineer Act.

In other countries, such as the UK, no such legislation exists; however, practically all certifying bodies maintain a code of ethics independent of legislation, that they expect all members to abide by or risk expulsion.

===Salaries and workforce statistics===
The total number of engineers employed in the U.S. in 2015 was roughly 1.6 million. Of these, 278,340 were mechanical engineers (17.28%), the largest discipline by size. In 2012, the median annual income of mechanical engineers in the U.S. workforce was $80,580. The median income was highest when working for the government ($92,030), and lowest in education ($57,090). In 2014, the total number of mechanical engineering jobs was projected to grow 5% over the next decade. As of 2009, the average starting salary was $58,800 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree.

==Subdisciplines==
The field of mechanical engineering can be thought of as a collection of many mechanical engineering science disciplines. Several of these subdisciplines which are typically taught at the undergraduate level are listed below, with a brief explanation and the most common application of each. Some of these subdisciplines are unique to mechanical engineering, while others are a combination of mechanical engineering and one or more other disciplines. Most work that a mechanical engineer does uses skills and techniques from several of these subdisciplines, as well as specialized subdisciplines. Specialized subdisciplines, as used in this article, are more likely to be the subject of graduate studies or on-the-job training than undergraduate research. Several specialized subdisciplines are discussed in this section.

===Mechanics===

Mechanics is, in the most general sense, the study of forces and their effect upon matter. Typically, engineering mechanics is used to analyze and predict the acceleration and deformation (both elastic and plastic) of objects under known forces (also called loads) or stresses. Subdisciplines of mechanics include
* Statics, the study of non-moving bodies under known loads, how forces affect static bodies
* Dynamics, the study of how forces affect moving bodies. Dynamics includes kinematics (about movement, velocity, and acceleration) and kinetics (about forces and resulting accelerations).
* Mechanics of materials, the study of how different materials deform under various types of stress
* Fluid mechanics, the study of how fluids react to forces
* Kinematics, the study of the motion of bodies (objects) and systems (groups of objects), while ignoring the forces that cause the motion. Kinematics is often used in the design and analysis of mechanisms.
* Continuum mechanics, a method of applying mechanics that assumes that objects are continuous (rather than )

Mechanical engineers typically use mechanics in the design or analysis phases of engineering. If the engineering project were the design of a vehicle, statics might be employed to design the frame of the vehicle, in order to evaluate where the stresses will be most intense. Dynamics might be used when designing the car&#x27;s engine, to evaluate the forces in the pistons and cams as the engine cycles. Mechanics of materials might be used to choose appropriate materials for the frame and engine. Fluid mechanics might be used to design a ventilation system for the vehicle (see HVAC), or to design the intake system for the engine.

===Mechatronics and robotics===

Mechatronics is a combination of mechanics and electronics. It is an interdisciplinary branch of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and software engineering that is concerned with integrating electrical and mechanical engineering to create hybrid automation systems. In this way, machines can be automated through the use of electric motors, servo-mechanisms, and other electrical systems in conjunction with special software. A common example of a mechatronics system is a CD-ROM drive. Mechanical systems open and close the drive, spin the CD and move the laser, while an optical system reads the data on the CD and converts it to bits. Integrated software controls the process and communicates the contents of the CD to the computer.

Robotics is the application of mechatronics to create robots, which are often used in industry to perform tasks that are dangerous, unpleasant, or repetitive. These robots may be of any shape and size, but all are preprogrammed and interact physically with the world. To create a robot, an engineer typically employs kinematics (to determine the robot&#x27;s range of motion) and mechanics (to determine the stresses within the robot).

Robots are used extensively in industrial automation engineering. They allow businesses to save money on labor, perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform them economically, and to ensure better quality. Many companies employ assembly lines of robots, especially in Automotive Industries and some factories are so robotized that they can run by themselves. Outside the factory, robots have been employed in bomb disposal, space exploration, and many other fields. Robots are also sold for various residential applications, from recreation to domestic applications.

===Structural analysis===
Structural analysis is the branch of mechanical engineering (and also civil engineering) devoted to examining why and how objects fail and to fix the objects and their performance. Structural failures occur in two general modes: static failure, and fatigue failure. &quot;Static structural failure&quot; occurs when, upon being loaded (having a force applied) the object being analyzed either breaks or is deformed plastically, depending on the criterion for failure. &quot;Fatigue failure&quot; occurs when an object fails after a number of repeated loading and unloading cycles. Fatigue failure occurs because of imperfections in the object: a microscopic crack on the surface of the object, for instance, will grow slightly with each cycle (propagation) until the crack is large enough to cause ultimate failure.

Failure is not simply defined as when a part breaks, however; it is defined as when a part does not operate as intended. Some systems, such as the perforated top sections of some plastic bags, are designed to break. If these systems do not break, failure analysis might be employed to determine the cause.

Structural analysis is often used by mechanical engineers after a failure has occurred, or when designing to prevent failure. Engineers often use online documents and books such as those published by ASM to aid them in determining the type of failure and possible causes.

Once theory is applied to a mechanical design, physical testing is often performed to verify calculated results. Structural analysis may be used in an office when designing parts, in the field to analyze failed parts, or in laboratories where parts might undergo controlled failure tests.

===Thermodynamics and thermo-science===
Thermodynamics is an applied science used in several branches of engineering, including mechanical and chemical engineering. At its simplest, thermodynamics is the study of energy, its use and transformation through a system. Typically, engineering thermodynamics is concerned with changing energy from one form to another. As an example, automotive engines convert chemical energy (enthalpy) from the fuel into heat, and then into mechanical work that eventually turns the wheels.

Thermodynamics principles are used by mechanical engineers in the fields of heat transfer, thermofluids, and energy conversion. Mechanical engineers use thermo-science to design engines and power plants, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, heat exchangers, heat sinks, radiators, refrigeration, insulation, and others.

===Design and drafting===

Drafting or technical drawing is the means by which mechanical engineers design products and create instructions for manufacturing parts. A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required materials, and other pertinent information. A U.S. mechanical engineer or skilled worker who creates technical drawings may be referred to as a drafter or draftsman. Drafting has historically been a two-dimensional process, but computer-aided design (CAD) programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions.

Instructions for manufacturing a part must be fed to the necessary machinery, either manually, through programmed instructions, or through the use of a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) or combined CAD/CAM program. Optionally, an engineer may also manually manufacture a part using the technical drawings. However, with the advent of computer numerically controlled (CNC) manufacturing, parts can now be fabricated without the need for constant technician input. Manually manufactured parts generally consist of spray coatings, surface finishes, and other processes that cannot economically or practically be done by a machine.

Drafting is used in nearly every subdiscipline of mechanical engineering, and by many other branches of engineering and architecture. Three-dimensional models created using CAD software are also commonly used in finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

==Modern tools==
Many mechanical engineering companies, especially those in industrialized nations, have incorporated computer-aided engineering (CAE) programs into their existing design and analysis processes, including 2D and 3D solid modeling computer-aided design (CAD). This method has many benefits, including easier and more exhaustive visualization of products, the ability to create virtual assemblies of parts, and the ease of use in designing mating interfaces and tolerances.

Other CAE programs commonly used by mechanical engineers include product lifecycle management (PLM) tools and analysis tools used to perform complex simulations. Analysis tools may be used to predict product response to expected loads, including fatigue life and manufacturability. These tools include finite element analysis (FEA), computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM).

Using CAE programs, a mechanical design team can quickly and cheaply iterate the design process to develop a product that better meets cost, performance, and other constraints. No physical prototype need be created until the design nears completion, allowing hundreds or thousands of designs to be evaluated, instead of a relative few. In addition, CAE analysis programs can model complicated physical phenomena which cannot be solved by hand, such as viscoelasticity, complex contact between mating parts, or non-Newtonian flows.

As mechanical engineering begins to merge with other disciplines, as seen in mechatronics, multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) is being used with other CAE programs to automate and improve the iterative design process. MDO tools wrap around existing CAE processes, allowing product evaluation to continue even after the analyst goes home for the day. They also use sophisticated optimization algorithms to more intelligently explore possible designs, often finding better, innovative solutions to difficult multidisciplinary design problems.

==Areas of research==
Mechanical engineers are constantly pushing the boundaries of what is physically possible in order to produce safer, cheaper, and more efficient machines and mechanical systems. Some technologies at the cutting edge of mechanical engineering are listed below (see also exploratory engineering).

===Micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS)===

Micron-scale mechanical components such as springs, gears, fluidic and heat transfer devices are fabricated from a variety of substrate materials such as silicon, glass and polymers like SU8. Examples of MEMS components are the accelerometers that are used as car airbag sensors, modern cell phones, gyroscopes for precise positioning and microfluidic devices used in biomedical applications.

===Friction stir welding (FSW)===
Friction stir welding, a new type of welding, was discovered in 1991 by The Welding Institute (TWI). The innovative steady state (non-fusion) welding technique joins materials previously un-weldable, including several aluminum alloys. It plays an important role in the future construction of airplanes, potentially replacing rivets. Current uses of this technology to date include welding the seams of the aluminum main Space Shuttle external tank, Orion Crew Vehicle, Boeing Delta II and Delta IV Expendable Launch Vehicles and the SpaceX Falcon 1 rocket, armor plating for amphibious assault ships, and welding the wings and fuselage panels of the new Eclipse 500 aircraft from Eclipse Aviation among an increasingly growing pool of uses.

===Composites===

Composites or composite materials are a combination of materials which provide different physical characteristics than either material separately. Composite material research within mechanical engineering typically focuses on designing (and, subsequently, finding applications for) stronger or more rigid materials while attempting to reduce weight, susceptibility to corrosion, and other undesirable factors. Carbon fiber reinforced composites, for instance, have been used in such diverse applications as spacecraft and fishing rods.

===Mechatronics===
Mechatronics is the synergistic combination of mechanical engineering, electronic engineering, and software engineering. The discipline of mechatronics began as a way to combine mechanical principles with electrical engineering. Mechatronic concepts are used in the majority of electro-mechanical systems. Typical electro-mechanical sensors used in mechatronics are strain gauges, thermocouples, and pressure transducers.

===Nanotechnology===
At the smallest scales, mechanical engineering becomes nanotechnology—one speculative goal of which is to create a molecular assembler to build molecules and materials via mechanosynthesis. For now that goal remains within exploratory engineering. Areas of current mechanical engineering research in nanotechnology include nanofilters, nanofilms, and nanostructures, among others.
===Finite element analysis===
Finite Element Analysis is a computational tool used to estimate stress, strain, and deflection of solid bodies. It uses a mesh setup with user-defined sizes to measure physical quantities at a node. The more nodes there are, the higher the precision. This field is not new, as the basis of Finite Element Analysis (FEA) or Finite Element Method (FEM) dates back to 1941. But the evolution of computers has made FEA/FEM a viable option for analysis of structural problems. Many commercial software applications such as NASTRAN, ANSYS, and ABAQUS are widely used in industry for research and the design of components. Some 3D modeling and CAD software packages have added FEA modules. In the recent times, cloud simulation platforms like SimScale are becoming more common.

Other techniques such as finite difference method (FDM) and finite-volume method (FVM) are employed to solve problems relating heat and mass transfer, fluid flows, fluid surface interaction, etc.

===Biomechanics===
Biomechanics is the application of mechanical principles to biological systems, such as humans, animals, plants, organs, and cells. Biomechanics also aids in creating prosthetic limbs and artificial organs for humans. Biomechanics is closely related to engineering, because it often uses traditional engineering sciences to analyze biological systems. Some simple applications of Newtonian mechanics and/or materials sciences can supply correct approximations to the mechanics of many biological systems.

In the past decade, reverse engineering of materials found in nature such as bone matter has gained funding in academia. The structure of bone matter is optimized for its purpose of bearing a large amount of compressive stress per unit weight. The goal is to replace crude steel with bio-material for structural design.

Over the past decade the Finite element method (FEM) has also entered the Biomedical sector highlighting further engineering aspects of Biomechanics. FEM has since then established itself as an alternative to in vivo surgical assessment and gained the wide acceptance of academia. The main advantage of Computational Biomechanics lies in its ability to determine the endo-anatomical response of an anatomy, without being subject to ethical restrictions. This has led FE modelling to the point of becoming ubiquitous in several fields of Biomechanics while several projects have even adopted an open source philosophy (e.g. BioSpine).

===Computational fluid dynamics===
Computational fluid dynamics, usually abbreviated as CFD, is a branch of fluid mechanics that uses numerical methods and algorithms to solve and analyze problems that involve fluid flows. Computers are used to perform the calculations required to simulate the interaction of liquids and gases with surfaces defined by boundary conditions. With high-speed supercomputers, better solutions can be achieved. Ongoing research yields software that improves the accuracy and speed of complex simulation scenarios such as turbulent flows. Initial validation of such software is performed using a wind tunnel with the final validation coming in full-scale testing, e.g. flight tests.

===Acoustical engineering===
Acoustical engineering is one of many other sub-disciplines of mechanical engineering and is the application of acoustics. Acoustical engineering is the study of Sound and Vibration. These engineers work effectively to reduce noise pollution in mechanical devices and in buildings by soundproofing or removing sources of unwanted noise. The study of acoustics can range from designing a more efficient hearing aid, microphone, headphone, or recording studio to enhancing the sound quality of an orchestra hall. Acoustical engineering also deals with the vibration of different mechanical systems.

==Related fields==
Manufacturing engineering, aerospace engineering, automotive engineering and marine engineering are grouped with mechanical engineering at times. A bachelor&#x27;s degree in these areas will typically have a difference of a few specialized classes.

<text>Monkey Island is a series of adventure games. The first four games were produced and published by LucasArts, earlier known as Lucasfilm Games. The fifth was developed by Telltale Games with LucasArts, while the sixth was developed by Terrible Toybox with Lucasfilm Games and Devolver Digital.

The games follow the adventures of the hapless Guybrush Threepwood as he struggles to become the most notorious pirate in the Caribbean, defeat the plans of the evil undead pirate LeChuck and win the heart of Governor Elaine Marley. The plots often involve the mysterious Monkey Island and its secrets.

&quot;Monkey Island&quot; was created by Ron Gilbert, Tim Schafer, and Dave Grossman. Gilbert worked on the first two games before leaving LucasArts. Grossman and Schafer had success on other games before they both left LucasArts. The rights to &quot;Monkey Island&quot; remained with LucasArts, and the third and fourth games were created without direct involvement from the original writing staff. Grossman was the project leader of the fifth game in the series and Gilbert was involved with the first design of the game. Gilbert&#x27;s studio developed the sixth game, &quot;Return to Monkey Island&quot; (2022), with Grossman assisting.

==Background==
Ron Gilbert&#x27;s two main inspirations for the story were Disneyland&#x27;s Pirates of the Caribbean ride and Tim Powers&#x27; book &quot;On Stranger Tides&quot;. The book was the inspiration for the story and characters, while the ride was the inspiration for the ambiance. Gilbert said in an interview that:

&quot;[the POTC Ride] keeps you moving through the adventure but I&#x27;ve always wished I could get off and wander around, learn more about the characters, and find a way onto those pirate ships. So with &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot; I wanted to create a game that had the same flavor, but where you could step off the boat and enter that whole storybook world”.

==Media==
===Games===

====&quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot;====

The series debuted in 1990 with &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot; on the Amiga, MS-DOS, Atari ST and Macintosh platforms; the game was later ported to FM Towns and Mega-CD (1993). A remake version with updated graphics and new voiceovers was released for PlayStation Network, PC Windows, Xbox Live Arcade and OS X. An iPhone version was also released on July 23, 2009.

The game starts off with the main character Guybrush Threepwood stating &quot;I want to be a pirate!&quot; To do so, he must prove himself to three old pirate captains. During the perilous pirate trials, he meets the beautiful governor Elaine Marley, with whom he falls in love, unaware that the ghost pirate LeChuck also has his eyes on her. When Elaine is kidnapped, Guybrush procures crew and ship to track LeChuck down, defeat him and rescue his love.

====&quot;Monkey Island 2: LeChuck&#x27;s Revenge&quot;====

The second game, &quot;Monkey Island 2: LeChuck&#x27;s Revenge&quot; from 1991, was available for fewer platforms; it was only released for PC MS-DOS, Amiga, Macintosh, and later for FM Towns. A Special Edition version, in a similar style as &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition&quot;, was released in July 2010 for iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, Mac, PC, PS3 and Xbox 360.

As Guybrush, with a treasure chest in hand, and Elaine hang onto ropes in a void, he tells her the story of the game. He has decided to find the greatest of all treasures, that of Big Whoop. Unwittingly he helps revive LeChuck, who is now in zombie form. Guybrush is eventually captured by his nemesis, but escapes with help from Wally and finds the treasure only to find himself dangling from a rope, as depicted at the beginning of the game. As Guybrush concludes his story, his rope breaks and he finds himself facing LeChuck, whom he finally defeats using voodoo. The surrealistic ending is open to a number of interpretations. In the manual of &quot;The Curse of Monkey Island&quot;, it is stated that Guybrush falls victim to a hex implemented by LeChuck.

====&quot;The Curse of Monkey Island&quot;====

&quot;The Curse of Monkey Island&quot;, the third in the series, was released exclusively for Microsoft Windows on PC in 1997, after a 6-year hiatus. &quot;The Curse of Monkey Island&quot; was released at the height of some of the biggest technological advancements in the gaming industry—digital audio, CD-ROM technology, and improved graphics.

&quot;Monkey Island I&quot; and &quot;II&quot; were originally released on floppy disks with text dialogue only. Entire conversations between characters would appear as written text, or as captions above their heads.
The visuals of the third installment were also an improvement over the original game, using a more modern cel animation style. &quot;The Curse of Monkey Island&quot; is the only game in the series to feature this style of animation; subsequent games used three-dimensional polygon animation.

Threepwood, unwittingly, turns Elaine into a gold statue with a cursed ring, and she is subsequently stolen by pirates. He tracks her down before searching for another ring that can lift the curse. LeChuck appears in a fiery demon form, and is hot on Threepwood’s heels until a stand-off on LeChuck&#x27;s amusement park ride, Monkey Mountain.

====&quot;Escape from Monkey Island&quot;====

&quot;Escape from Monkey Island&quot;, the fourth installment, was released in 2000 for PC Windows, and in 2001 for Macintosh and PlayStation 2.

When Guybrush Threepwood and Elaine Marley return from their honeymoon, they find that Elaine has been declared officially dead, her mansion is under a destruction order, and her position as governor is up for election. Guybrush investigates and unearths a conspiracy by LeChuck and evil real estate developer Ozzie Mandrill to use a voodoo talisman, &quot;The Ultimate Insult&quot;, to make all pirates docile in order to turn the Caribbean into a center of tourism.

====&quot;Tales of Monkey Island&quot;====

&quot;Tales of Monkey Island&quot; is the fifth installment within the series, co-developed by Telltale Games and LucasArts, with a simultaneous release both on WiiWare and PC. Unlike other installments, &quot;Tales&quot; is an episodic adventure consisting of five different episodes. The first episode was released on July 7, with the last one released on December 8, 2009.

During a heated battle with his nemesis, the evil pirate LeChuck, Guybrush unwittingly unleashes an insidious pox that rapidly spreads across the Caribbean, turning pirates into zombie-like monsters. The Voodoo Lady sends Guybrush in search of a legendary sea sponge to stem the epidemic, but this seemingly straightforward quest has surprises around every corner.

====&quot;Return to Monkey Island&quot;====

With the purchase of LucasArts by the Walt Disney Company in 2012, the rights to the franchise are now property of Disney. In the second half of 2010s, Disney Interactive ceased the production on gaming and transitioned to a licensing model. Gilbert wrote on Twitter that he was interested in buying the &quot;Monkey Island&quot; and &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot; properties. Fans of the series launched an online petition asking Disney to sell the franchise to Gilbert; by December 2021, the petition had gathered about 29,000 signatures.

&quot;Return to Monkey Island&quot;, the sixth &quot;Monkey Island&quot; installment, was released on September 19, 2022 on the Nintendo Switch and Windows, coming to other formats later. It is a collaboration between Gilbert&#x27;s Terrible Toybox studio and Lucasfilm Games, and published by Devolver Digital. A frame story in the game serves to explain and continue from the ending of &quot;LeChuck&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, while the main narrative takes place after the other games in the series. Ron Gilbert has expressed his desire to tell a simple and focused pirate story in the game, while also redefining the adventure game user interface and deepening the greater lore. In addition to Gilbert, Grossman returns as co-writer, with music from veteran series composers Michael Land, Peter McConnell, and Clint Bajakian, and Dominic Armato, Alexandra Boyd, and Denny Delk reprising their roles as Guybrush, Elaine, and Murray. Jess Harnell replaces the retired Earl Boen as the voice of LeChuck.

====Other appearances====
Stan&#x27;s Used Coffins is referred to in one of the levels of the LucasArts game &quot;Outlaws&quot;. In &quot;Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine&quot;, Guybrush can be accessed as a playable character via a cheat code; in addition, a &quot;Monkey Island&quot;-themed secret room can be found in the game&#x27;s final level. Guybrush also appears in &quot;Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II&quot; as a playable skin for Starkiller named &quot;Guybrush Threepkiller&quot;.

Guybrush is paid homage in the Naughty Dog video game &quot;Uncharted 4: A Thief&#x27;s End&quot;, where a pirate with major similarities to Guybrush is featured as one of the twelve pirate captains that founded Libertalia. Although he remains unnamed throughout the game, the resemblance is uncanny and his sigil is represented by a monkey. His portrait can be seen in the Libertalia treasury with the other founders and though his name is partly scratched out, the letters still visible spell out the truncated name &quot;Guy Wood&quot;.

Several elements from the &quot;Monkey Island&quot; series appear in &quot;Sea of Thieves&quot; as part of its June 2021 &quot;A Pirate&#x27;s Life&quot; update. Developed in collaboration with Disney and primarily themed after &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot;, multiple references to the characters and locales from the Monkey Island franchise can be found in journals by Kate Capsize scattered around the wreckage of The Headless Monkey during the update&#x27;s first Tall Tale, accompanied by an original arrangement of the Monkey Island theme. According to the journals, Guybrush and Elaine Threepwood are celebrating their honeymoon somewhere upon the Sea of Thieves, while Kate perished attempting to get revenge on Guybrush for framing her. 

A full &quot;Monkey Island&quot;-themed expansion for the game, &quot;The Legend of Monkey Island&quot;, was released on July 20, 2023 and spread across three monthly episodes. In the story, set between &quot;Curse&quot; and &quot;Escape&quot;, Guybrush and Elaine&#x27;s honeymoon on the Sea of Thieves is interrupted by LeChuck, who traps them in a dream version of Mêlée Island where everyone worships Guybrush as a legendary pirate. To stop LeChuck from restoring the legendary Burning Blade and conquering the Sea of Thieves, the Pirate Lord recruits the now-revived Kate Capsize and the player pirates to enter the dreamworld and rescue Guybrush and Elaine.

In an update to &quot;Hitman 3&quot;, a new pirate-themed map was added, which featured an Easter Egg referencing &quot;Monkey Island&quot; in the form of a gravestone in the environment reading &quot;G Threepwood, Mighty Pirate&quot;, a clear reference to Guybrush.

In &quot;The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt&quot;, while completing the ‘Fists of Fury’ quest in the &quot;Blood and Wine&quot; expansion patch, the protagonist Geralt encounters a man named Mancomb, a reference to a character of the same name in the first game of the series.

===Cancelled film===
Shortly after Pixar, a spinout from Lucasfilm, found success with the first &quot;Toy Story&quot; film in 1995, there had been a push across Hollywood for more digitally animated films. Lucasfilm&#x27;s Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM), in the midst of transitioning from practical to digital effects, offered its services for producing these films to other studios. One of the first projects they tried to work on was with Universal Pictures to revive the Universal Classic Monsters line with a film called &quot;Frankenstein and the Wolfman&quot;. While several scripts and preliminary art was produced for this film, shake-ups at Universal due to the financial failure of &quot;&quot; led to changes in leadership for the film and ultimately its cancellation.

David Carson, who had been set to direct &quot;Frankenstein and the Wolfman&quot; but left after the Universal shake-up, came back to ILM with the idea of an animated film based on the first &quot;Monkey Island&quot; game around 2000. With initial support from ILM, Carson worked an initial script with Corey Rosen and Scott Leberecht as to pitch the idea to Amblin Entertainment, the production company owned by Steven Spielberg. Spielberg had told Carson that he had previously told George Lucas that he should have made a &quot;Monkey Island&quot; movie years before, and other meetings with Amblin went well to proceed to further screenwriting work. The rest of ILM&#x27;s story department was brought in to help write, including Steve Purcell, but this team worked separately from the writers that were developing the actual games, creating a disconnect between story the film was going with and the narrative already established in the video game series. As they continued to work out the screenplay, the direction of the film continued to veer further from the video game series, including at one point where Spielberg had suggested the game be about the monkeys on Monkey Island instead of the pirates. According to Carson, the lack of a creative direction at this point led to the film being shelved at ILM.

Details about the film were first revealed publicly in 2011 as part of the &quot;Monkey Island Special Edition Collection&quot; which included some of the film&#x27;s concept art, storyboards, and scripts.

It had been rumored that Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio had been involved in the writing of the &quot;Monkey Island&quot; script which they subsequently used as the basis for the first &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; film. Both Elliott and Rossio had been to ILM and were shown parts of the &quot;Monkey Island&quot; script, around the same time they were working on their script for &quot;Pirates&quot;. When &quot;Pirates&quot; was released, many fans of the &quot;Monkey Island&quot; series made comparisons of parts of the film to the games, and when news of the cancelled film first arose in 2011, the potential connection of Elliott and Rossio to the &quot;Monkey Island&quot; script started. Both Carson and Rossio stated that many of the tropes in both &quot;Monkey Island&quot; and &quot;Pirates&quot; are based on the classic pirate movies and that there was no direct reuse of the cancelled &quot;Monkey Island&quot; film in &quot;Pirates&quot;.

== The &quot;Secret&quot; of Monkey Island ==
None of the first five games explicitly reveal the &quot;Secret of Monkey Island&quot;. The team behind &quot;Escape from Monkey Island&quot; attempted to resolve the issue by showing that the Giant Monkey Head was actually the control room of a Giant Monkey Robot. The cut-scene in which the revelation was made is called &quot;The Real Secret of Monkey Island&quot;.

Gilbert stated that he never told anyone what the true secret of Monkey Island is. In a 2004 interview, Gilbert stated that when the game was originally conceived, it was considered &quot;too big&quot;, so they split it into three parts. He added that he &quot;knows what the third [part] is&quot; and &quot;how the story&#x27;s supposed to end&quot;, indicating that he had a definite concept of the “secret” and a conclusive third game.

The true nature of the secret is the main focus of &quot;Return to Monkey Island&quot;, with several characters competing amongst themselves in a race to discover &quot;the Secret&quot;. The game&#x27;s conclusion reveals the secret to be a novelty T-shirt earned as a prize at a pirate-themed amusement park, which has acted as the setting for all of Guybrush Threepwood’s previous adventures. Threepwood, as the game&#x27;s narrator, is intentionally ambiguous as to whether this is the actual secret, even suggesting that the secret means different things to different people, and putting forth the notion that the story of the journey (and the joy of speculating about the secret with others) is more valuable than the reward itself.

After the release of &quot;Return to Monkey Island&quot;, Gilbert stated in an interview that the true secret (as conceived during development of the first installment of the series) is that Guybrush was, in fact, inside of a pirate-themed amusement park the entire time.

<text>Cardiff Arms Park (), also known as The Arms Park, is primarily a rugby union stadium, and also has a bowling green. It is situated in Cardiff, Wales, next to the Millennium Stadium. The Arms Park was host to the British Empire and Commonwealth Games in 1958, and hosted four games in the 1991 Rugby World Cup, including the third-place play-off. The Arms Park also hosted the inaugural Heineken Cup Final of 1995–96 and the following year in 1996–97.

The history of the rugby ground begins with the first stands appearing for spectators in the ground in 1881–1882. Originally the Arms Park had a cricket ground to the north and a rugby union stadium to the south. By 1969, the cricket ground had been demolished to make way for the present day rugby ground to the north and a second rugby stadium to the south, called the National Stadium. The National Stadium, which was used by Wales national rugby union team, was officially opened on 7 April 1984, however in 1997 it was demolished to make way for the Millennium Stadium in 1999, which hosted the 1999 Rugby World Cup and became the national stadium of Wales. The rugby ground has remained the home of the semi-professional Cardiff RFC yet the professional Cardiff Blues regional rugby union team moved to the Cardiff City Stadium in 2009, but returned three years later.

The site is owned by Cardiff Athletic Club and has been host to many sports, apart from rugby union and cricket; they include athletics, association football, greyhound racing, tennis, British baseball and boxing. The site also has a bowling green to the north of the rugby ground, which is used by Cardiff Athletic Bowls Club, which is the bowls section of the Cardiff Athletic Club. The National Stadium also hosted many music concerts including Michael Jackson, Dire Straits, David Bowie, Bon Jovi, The Rolling Stones and U2.

== History ==

=== Early history of the site ===
The Cardiff Arms Park site was originally called the Great Park, a swampy meadow behind the Cardiff Arms Hotel. The hotel was built by Sir Thomas Morgan, during the reign of Charles I. Cardiff Arms Park was named after this hotel. From 1803, the Cardiff Arms Hotel and the Park had become the property of the Bute family. The Arms Park soon became a popular place for sporting events, and by 1848, Cardiff Cricket Club was using the site for its cricket matches. However, by 1878, Cardiff Arms Hotel had been demolished.

The 3rd Marquess of Bute stipulated that the ground could only be used for &quot;recreational purposes&quot;. At that time Cardiff Arms Park had a cricket ground to the north and a rugby union ground to the south. 1881–2 saw the first stands for spectators; they held 300 spectators and cost £50. The architect was Archibald Leitch, who also designed Ibrox Stadium and Old Trafford. In 1890, new standing areas were constructed along the entire length of the ground, with additional stands erected in 1896.

=== 1912 redevelopment ===
By 1912, the Cardiff Football Ground, as it was then known, had a new south stand and temporary stands on the north, east and west ends of the ground. The south stand was covered, while the north terrace was initially without a roof. The improvements were partly funded by the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU). The opening ceremony took place on 5 October 1912, with a match between Newport RFC and Cardiff RFC. The new ground was opened by Lord Ninian Crichton-Stuart. This new development increased the ground capacity to 43,000 and much improved facilities at the ground compared to the earlier stands.

In 1922, The 4th Marquess of Bute sold the entire site and it was bought by the Cardiff Arms Park Company Limited for £30,000. It was then leased to the Cardiff Athletic Club (cricket and rugby sections) for 99 years at a cost of £200 per annum.

=== North and South Stand redevelopments ===

During 1934 the cricket pavilion had been demolished to make way for the new North Stand which was built on the rugby union ground, costing around £20,000. However, in 1941 the new North Stand and part of the west terracing was badly damaged in the Blitz by the Luftwaffe during the Second World War.

At a general meeting of the WRU in June 1953 they made a decision &quot;That until such time as the facilities at Swansea were improved, all international matches be played at Cardiff&quot;. At the same time, plans were made for a new South Stand which was estimated to cost £60,000; the tender price, however, came out at £90,000, so a compromise was made and it was decided to build a new upper South Stand costing £64,000 instead, with the Cardiff Athletic Club contributing £15,000 and the remainder coming from the WRU. The new South Stand opened in 1956, in time for the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games. This brought the overall capacity of the Arms Park up to 60,000 spectators, of which 12,800 were seated and the remainder standing.

The Arms Park hosted the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games, which was used for the athletics events, but this event caused damage to the drainage system, so much so, that other rugby unions (England, Scotland and Ireland) complained after the Games about the state of the pitch. On 4 December 1960, due to torrential rain, the River Taff burst its banks with the Arms Park pitch being left under of water. The Development Committee was set up to resolve these issues on a permanent basis. They looked at various sites in Cardiff, but they all proved to be unsatisfactory. They also could not agree a solution with the Cardiff Athletic Club, so they purchased about of land at Island Farm in Bridgend, which was previously used as a prisoner-of-war camp. It is best known for being the camp where the biggest escape attempt was made by German prisoners of war in Great Britain during the Second World War. Due to problems including transport issues Glamorgan County Council never gave outline planning permission for the proposals and by June 1964 the scheme was abandoned. At that stage, the cricket ground to the north was still being used by Glamorgan County Cricket Club, and the rugby union ground to the south was used by the national Wales team and Cardiff RFC.

By 7 October 1966, the first floodlit game was held at Cardiff Arms Park, a game in which Cardiff RFC beat the Barbarians by 12 points to 8.

=== National Stadium redevelopment ===


The National Stadium, which was previously known as the Welsh National Rugby Ground, was designed by Osborne V Webb &amp; Partners and built by G A Williamson &amp; Associates of Porthcawl and Andrew Scott &amp; Company of Port Talbot. In 1969 construction began on the stadium which replaced the existing rugby ground built in 1881. The stadium was home to the Wales national rugby union team since 1964 and the Wales national football team since 1989. In 1997 the stadium was demolished to make way for the new Millennium Stadium.

=== Millennium Stadium ===

Thirteen years after the National Stadium had opened in 1984, it was considered too small and did not have the facilities required of the time and it was demolished and a new stadium, the Millennium Stadium, was built in its place (completed to a north–south alignment and opened in June 1999). This would become the fourth redevelopment on the site.

Construction involved the demolition of a number of buildings, primarily the existing National Stadium, Wales Empire Pool in Wood Street, Cardiff Empire Telephone Exchange building and the newly built Territorial Auxiliary and Volunteer Reserve building both in Park Street, and the Social Security offices in Westgate Street. The Millennium Stadium is now on roughly two-thirds of the National Stadium, but it no longer uses the Arms Park name. Since 2016 it has been known as the Principality Stadium.

===Rugby ground ===

Only the rugby ground and the Cardiff Athletic Bowls Club now use the name Cardiff Arms Park. The rugby ground has two main stands, the North Stand and the South Stand. Both the Stands have terracing below seating. The other stands in the ground are the Westgate Street end Family Stand, which has rows of seating below executive boxes, plus the club shop, and the River Taff end (the Barry Nelmes Suite, named after Barry Nelmes, the former Cardiff RFC captain), which has 26 executive boxes. The rugby ground has two main entrances, the south entrance, and the Gwyn Nicholls Memorial Gates (Angel Hotel entrance), which was unveiled on 26 December 1949 in honour of the Welsh international rugby player Gwyn Nicholls. The Cardiff Athletic Clubhouse is situated in the corner of the ground between the South Stand and the Westgate Street end.

The South Stand of the rugby ground formed a complete unit with the North Stand of the National Stadium. Now the same structure of the South Stand of the rugby ground is also physically attached to the North Stand of the Millennium Stadium. This section is known colloquially as Glanmor&#x27;s Gap, after Glanmor Griffiths, former chair and President of the WRU. This came about because the WRU were unable to secure enough funding to include the North Stand in the Millennium Stadium, and the National Lottery Commission would not provide any additional funds to be used for the construction of a new ground for Cardiff RFC. The Millennium Stadium was therefore built with the old reinforced concrete structure of the National Stadium (North Stand) and the new steel Millennium Stadium structure built around it.

There was doubt about the future of the Arms Park after 2010 following the move of the Cardiff Blues to the Cardiff City Stadium. Cardiff RFC Ltd, the company that runs Cardiff Blues and Cardiff RFC, still has a 15-year lease on the Arms Park, but talks are underway to release the rugby club from the terms of the lease, to enable the Millennium Stadium to be redeveloped with a new North Stand and adjoining convention centre. However, it still has the original requirement on the lease, that the land will only be used for &quot;recreational purposes&quot;, as stipulated by the Bute family. But the Arms Park site is a prime piece of real estate in the centre of Cardiff, which means that it may be difficult to sell the land to property developers. The estimated value of the whole Arms Park site could be at least £25 million, although with the &quot;recreational use&quot; requirement, its actual value could be a lot less than that figure. A decision by Cardiff Athletic Club on the future of the Arms Park has yet to be made. In 2011, the Cardiff Blues regional rugby union team made a £6 million bid for the Arms Park, later the WRU made an increased bid of £10 million for the site. Both bids were rejected by the trustees of the Cardiff Athletic Club. However, in 2012 Cardiff Blues announced that they would be making a permanent return to Cardiff Arms Park following declining attendances at the Cardiff City Stadium. During the 2013 off-season, the pitch at the rugby ground was replaced with an all weather 3G (third generation) artificial turf surface from FieldTurf at a cost of £400,000, intended to prevent any adverse weather conditions from affecting the rugby.

; Proposed redevelopment

An agreement in principle was reached in December 2015 between the landlord of the stadium site (Cardiff Athletic Club) and its tenant (Cardiff Blues) to give the club a 150-year lease on the stadium site. This could see the redevelopment of the Arms Park, including a new 15,000 seater stadium at 90 degrees to the existing stadium costing between £20 million and £30 million and surrounded by new offices and apartments. If the final agreement goes ahead, Cardiff Athletic Club would receive an upfront payment of approximately £8 million. As part of the agreement, the bowls section would have to vacate its current site at the Arms Park and move to a new facility. At present Cardiff Blues pay Cardiff Athletic Club rent of around £115,000 per annum, however this would nearly double to around £200,000.

=== Bowling green ===
Cardiff Arms Park is best known as a rugby union stadium, but Cardiff Athletic Bowls Club (CABC) was established in 1923, and ever since then, the club has used the Arms Park as its bowling green. The bowls club is a section of the Cardiff Athletic Club and shares many of the facilities of the Cardiff Arms Park athletics centre.
 
The Les Spence Memorial Gates were erected in memory of the former Cardiff RFU player, who captained the team in 1936–37. He was born in 1907 and became chairman of the Cardiff RFU and president of the WRU between 1973 and 1974. He was awarded an MBE and died in 1988.

The club has produced two Welsh international bowlers; Mr. C Standfast in 1937 and Mr. B Hawkins who represented Wales in the 1982 World Pairs and captained Wales in 1982 and 1984.
== Usage ==

=== Association football ===
The Riverside Football Club, founded in 1899, played some matches at the Arms Park until 1910, when they moved to Ninian Park, and later became Cardiff City Football Club.

On 31 May 1989, Wales played its first international game against West Germany at the National Stadium in a World Cup qualifying match, which ended goalless. It was also the first ever international football match held in Great Britain that was watched by all-seater spectators.

The adjoining Cardiff Rugby Club ground has also been used for Association Football. In July 1995, Ton Pentre played two Intertoto Cup games there, against Heerenveen (Netherlands) and Uniao Leiria (Portugal) as their own ground was not suitable. The Heerenveen game - the first ever soccer match to be played there - kicked off at 6pm on Saturday 1 July 1995 and resulted in the Dutch side winning 7–0. The Wales U-21 team have also played a home game there in the late 1990s.

On 5 April 2017, the ground was used to host the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s football matches as part of the 2017 Welsh Varsity, between Cardiff University and Swansea University. The women&#x27;s game finished in a 1-1 draw, while the men&#x27;s game resulted in a 1-0 win for Swansea.

=== Athletics ===
In 1958, the British Empire and Commonwealth Games were held in Cardiff. The event was (to date) the biggest sporting event ever held in Wales; however, it would not have been possible without the financial support given by the WRU and the Cardiff Athletic Club. Both the opening and closing ceremonies took place at Cardiff Arms Park, plus all the track and field events, on what had been the greyhound track. It would turn out to be the last time that South Africa would participate in the Games until 1994. South Africa withdrew from the Commonwealth Games in 1961.

=== Baseball and British baseball ===
Baseball was established early on in Cardiff, and one of the earliest of games to be held at the Arms Park was on 18 May 1918. It was a charity match in aid of the Prisoner of War Fund between Welsh and American teams of the U.S. Beaufort and U.S. Jupiter. British baseball matches have also regularly taken place at the Arms Park and hosted the annual England versus Wales international game every four years. The games are now usually held at Roath Park.

=== Boxing ===
The first boxing contest held at the Arms Park was on 24 January 1914, when Bombardier Billy Wells beat Gaston Pigot by a knockout in the first round of a 20-round contest. Boxing contests were held later on 14 June 1943, 12 August 1944, 4 October 1951 and 10 September 1952.

Around 25,000 spectators watched international boxing on 1 October 1993, at the National Stadium with a World Boxing Council (WBC) Heavyweight title bout between Lennox Lewis and Frank Bruno. It was the first time that two British-born boxers had fought for the world heavyweight title. Lewis beat Bruno by a technical knockout in the 7th round, in what was called the &quot;Battle of Britain&quot;. On 30 September 1995, Steve Robinson the World Boxing Organization (WBO) World Featherweight Champion, lost against Prince Naseem Hamed at the rugby ground in 8 rounds.

=== Cricket ===
In 1819, Cardiff Cricket Club was formed and by 1848 they had moved to their new home at the Arms Park. Glamorgan County Cricket Club, at the time not a first-class county, played their first match at the ground in June 1869 against Monmouthshire Cricket Club. The county club played their first County Championship match on the ground in 1921, competing there every season (except while first-class cricket was suspended during the Second World War) until their final match on the ground against Somerset in August 1966.

Cardiff Cricket Club played their final game at the ground against Lydney Cricket Club on 17 September 1966. Both Cardiff Cricket Club and Glamorgan then moved to a new ground at Sophia Gardens on the opposite bank of the River Taff to the Arms Park following work on the creation of the national rugby stadium.

The first first-class cricket match to be held on the ground was between West of England and East of England, on 20 June 1910. In all more than 240 first-class matches were played on the ground, all but two involving Glamorgan as the home team. Only one List A cricket match was played on the ground, Glamorgan&#x27;s Gillette Cup fixture against Somerset on 22 May 1963.

=== Greyhound racing ===

Greyhound racing took place at the Arms Park for fifty years from 1927 until 1977.

=== Rugby union ===
In 1876, the Cardiff RFC was formed and soon after they also used the park. On 12 April 1884, the first international match was played at the ground between Wales and Ireland, when 5,000 people watched Wales beat Ireland by two tries and a drop goal to nil.

The Arms Park rugby ground became the permanent home of the Wales national rugby union team in 1964. Later, the National Stadium was also home to the WRU Challenge Cup from 1972 until the match held at the Stadium on 26 April 1997, at a much reduced capacity, between Cardiff RFC and Swansea RFC. Cardiff RFC won the match 33–26.

The National Stadium is best known as the venue for what is considered to be &quot;the greatest try ever scored&quot; by Gareth Edwards for the Barbarians against New Zealand in what is also called &quot;the greatest match ever played&quot; on 27 January 1973. The final result was a win for the Barbarians. The score, 23–11, which translates to 27–13 in today&#x27;s scoring system.

The scorers were:

Barbarians: Tries: Gareth Edwards, Fergus Slattery, John Bevan, J P R Williams; Conversions: Phil Bennett (2); Penalty: Phil Bennett.

All Blacks: Tries: Grant Batty (2); Penalty: Joseph Karam.

The National Stadium hosted four games in the 1991 Rugby World Cup, including the third-place play-off. The National Stadium was also host to the inaugural Heineken Cup final of 1995–96 when Toulouse beat Cardiff RFC by 21–18 after extra time, in front of 21,800 spectators. The following final in 1996–97 was also held at the National Stadium, this time it was between Brive and Leicester Tigers. Brive won the match 28–9, in front of a crowd of 41,664.

In 2008, the rugby ground hosted all the games in Pool A of the 2008 IRB Junior World Championship and also the semi-final on 18 June 2008, in which England beat South Africa 26–18.
Until February 2012, it had been assumed that the last professional rugby union game to take place at the Arms Park was on 17 May 2009, when Edinburgh beat the Cardiff Blues 36–14 in a Celtic League match during the 2008–09 season.

However, on Tuesday, 7 February 2012, it was confirmed that Cardiff Blues would face Connacht at the Arms Park on Friday, 10 February 2012. The Pro12 League game result was a win for the Cardiff Blues 22–15 and attendance of 8,000. The following Tuesday, it was announced that the match against Ulster on Friday, 17 February, would also be at the Arms Park, resulting in a Blues win, 21–14 and attendance of 8,600. The agreement signed during 2009 tied Cardiff Blues to a 20-year contract to play a maximum of 18 games per season for a set fee, rather than per match at Cardiff City Stadium. But on 23 February, it was announced that the two Welsh &#x27;derbies&#x27; against the Scarlets and the Ospreys would be played at Cardiff City Stadium, rather than the Arms Park, because of Cardiff Blues&#x27; anticipation that the attendance figures would far exceed the maximum capacity of 9,000. On 8 May 2012, it was announced that Cardiff Blues would be returning to the Arms Park on a permanent basis after just three years at the Cardiff City Stadium.

On 23 May 2014, the rugby ground hosted the final of the 2013–14 Amlin Challenge Cup in which Northampton Saints beat Bath 30–16.

=== Tennis ===
Tennis courts were laid out in the Arms Park for Cardiff Tennis Club until the club moved to Sophia Gardens in 1967. In 2003, the club amalgamated with Lisvane Tennis Club to form Lisvane (CAC) Tennis Club, which is still a section of Cardiff Athletic Club (CAC).

=== Music concerts ===
Major music concerts were also held at the National Stadium from 1987 until 1996, they included Tina Turner, U2, Michael Jackson, The Rolling Stones, Dire Straits, Bon Jovi and R.E.M. The last music concert was held on 14 July 1996. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses held their annual conventions at the National Stadium.

== Singing tradition ==

The National Stadium was known primarily as the venue for massed voices singing such hymns as &quot;Cwm Rhondda&quot;, &quot;Calon Lân&quot;, &quot;Men of Harlech&quot; and &quot;Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau&quot; (&quot;Land of my Fathers&quot; – the national anthem of Wales). The legendary atmosphere including singing of the crowd was said to be worth at least a try or a goal to the home nation. This tradition of singing has now passed on to the Millennium Stadium.

The Arms Park has its own choir, called the Cardiff Arms Park Male Choir. It was formed in 1966 as the Cardiff Athletic Club Male Voice Choir, and today performs internationally with a schedule of concerts and tours. In 2000, the choir changed their name to become the Cardiff Arms Park Male Choir.

<text>Mikhail Timofeyevich Kalashnikov ( , ; ; 10November 191923December 2013) was a Soviet and Russian lieutenant general, inventor, military engineer, writer, and small arms designer. He is most famous for developing the AK-47 assault rifle and its improvements, the AKM and AK-74, as well as the RPK light machine gun and PK machine gun.

Kalashnikov was, according to himself, a self-taught tinkerer who combined innate mechanical skills with the study of weaponry to design arms that achieved battlefield ubiquity. Even though Kalashnikov felt sorrow at the weapons&#x27; uncontrolled distribution, he took pride in his inventions and in their reputation for reliability, emphasizing that his rifle is &quot;a weapon of defense&quot; and &quot;not a weapon for offense&quot;.

==Early life==

Kalashnikov was born in the village of Kurya, in present-day Altai Krai, Russia, as the seventeenth child of the 19 children of Aleksandra Frolovna Kalashnikova (née Kaverina) and Timofey Aleksandrovich Kalashnikov, who were peasants. In his youth, Mikhail suffered from various illnesses and was on the verge of death at age six. He was attracted to all kinds of machinery, but also wrote poetry, dreaming of becoming a poet. He later went on to write six books and continued to write poetry all of his life. In 1930, his father and most of his family had their properties confiscated and were deported as kulaks to the village of Nizhnyaya Mokhovaya, Tomsk Oblast. After deportation, his family had to combine farming with hunting, and thus Mikhail frequently used his father&#x27;s rifle in his teens. Kalashnikov continued hunting into his 90s.

After completing seventh grade, Mikhail, with his stepfather&#x27;s permission, left his family and returned to Kurya, hiking for nearly 1,000 km. In Kurya, he found a job in mechanics at a tractor station. A party organizer embedded within the factory noticed the man&#x27;s dexterity and issued him a directive (&quot;napravlenie&quot;) to work at a nearby weapons design bureau, where he was employed as a tester of fitted stocks in rifles. In 1938, he was conscripted into the Red Army. Because of his engineering skills he was assigned as a tank mechanic, and later became a tank commander. While training, he made his first inventions, which concerned not only tanks, but also small weapons, and was personally awarded a wrist watch by Georgy Zhukov. Kalashnikov served on the T-34s of the 24th Tank Regiment, 108th Tank Division stationed in Stryi before the regiment retreated after the Battle of Brody in June 1941. He was wounded in combat in the Battle of Bryansk in October 1941 and hospitalised until April 1942. In the last few months of being in hospital, he overheard some fellow soldiers bemoaning their current rifles, which were plagued with reliability issues, such as jamming. As he continued to overhear the complaints that the Soviet soldiers had, as soon as he was discharged, he went to work on what would become the famous AK-47 assault rifle.
Seeing the drawbacks of the standard infantry weapons at the time, he decided to construct a new rifle for the Soviet military. During this time Kalashnikov began designing a submachine gun. Although his first submachine gun design was not accepted into service, his talent as a designer was noticed. From 1942 onwards, Kalashnikov was assigned to the Central Scientific-developmental Firing Range for Rifle Firearms of the Chief Artillery Directorate of the Red Army.

In 1944, he designed a gas-operated carbine for the new 7.62×39mm cartridge. This weapon, influenced by the Garand rifle design, lost out to the new Simonov carbine which would eventually be adopted as the SKS; but it became a basis for his entry in an assault rifle competition in 1946. His winning entry, the &quot;Mikhtim&quot; (so named by taking the first letters of his name and patronymic, Mikhail Timofeyevich) became the prototype for the development of a family of prototype rifles. 

This process culminated in 1947, when he designed the AK-47 (standing for &quot;Avtomat Kalashnikova model 1947&quot;). In 1949, the AK became the standard issue assault rifle of the Soviet Army and went on to become Kalashnikov&#x27;s most famous invention.

While developing his first assault rifles, Kalashnikov competed with two much more experienced weapon designers, Vasily Degtyaryov and Georgy Shpagin, who both accepted the superiority of the AK-47 design. Kalashnikov named Alexandr Zaitsev and Vladimir Deikin as his major collaborators during those years.

==Later career==
From 1949, Mikhail Kalashnikov lived and worked in Izhevsk, Udmurtia. He held a degree of Doctor of Technical Sciences (1971) and was a member of 16 academies.

Over the course of his career, he evolved the basic design into a weapons family. The AKM (), first brought into service in 1959, was lighter and cheaper to manufacture, owing to the use of a stamped steel receiver (in place of the AK-47&#x27;s milled steel receiver) and contained detail improvements such as a re-shaped stock and muzzle compensator. From the AKM, he developed a squad automatic weapon variant, known as the RPK ().

He also developed the general-purpose PK machine gun (), which used the more powerful 7.62×54mmR cartridge of the Mosin–Nagant rifle. It is cartridge belt-fed, not magazine-fed, as it is intended to provide heavy sustained fire from a tripod mount, or be used as a light, bipod-mounted weapon. The common characteristics of all these weapons are their simple design, ruggedness and ease of maintenance in all operating conditions.

Approximately 100 million AK-47 assault rifles had been produced by 2009, and about half of them are counterfeit, manufactured at a rate of about a million per year. Izhmash, the official manufacturer of AK-47 in Russia, did not patent the weapon until 1997, and in 2006 accounted for only 10% of the world&#x27;s production.

Kalashnikov stated that his motivation was always to serve his country, not to earn money. 

Kalashnikov&#x27;s grandson, Igor, ran a German company called Marken Marketing International. The company revamps trademarks and produces merchandise carrying the Kalashnikov name, such as vodka, umbrellas and knives. One of the items is a knife named for the AK-74.

During a visit to the United States in the early 2000s, Kalashnikov was invited to tour a Virginia holding site for the forthcoming American Wartime Museum. Kalashnikov, a former tank commander, became visibly moved at the sight of his old tank in action, painted with his name in Cyrillic.

==Death==
After a prolonged illness, Kalashnikov was hospitalized on 17 November 2013, in an Udmurtian medical facility in Izhevsk, the capital of Udmurtia and where he lived. He died 23 December 2013, at age 94 from gastric hemorrhage. In January 2014, a letter that Kalashnikov wrote six months before his death to the leader of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, was published by the Russian daily newspaper &quot;Izvestia&quot;. In the letter, he stated that he was suffering &quot;spiritual pain&quot; about whether he was responsible for the deaths caused by the weapons he created. Translated from the published letter he states, &quot;I keep having the same unsolved question: if my rifle claimed people&#x27;s lives, then can it be that I... a Christian and an Orthodox believer, was to blame for their deaths?&quot;.

The patriarch wrote back, thanked Kalashnikov, and said that he &quot;was an example of patriotism and a correct attitude toward the country&quot;. Kirill added about the design responsibility for the deaths by the rifle, &quot;the church has a well-defined position when the weapon is defense of the Motherland, the Church supports its creators and the military, which use it.&quot;

He became one of the first people buried in the Federal Military Memorial Cemetery.

==Family==
Kalashnikov&#x27;s father, Timofey Aleksandrovich Kalashnikov (1883–1930), was a peasant. He completed two grades of parochial school and could read and write. In 1901, he married Aleksandra Frolovna Kaverina (1884–1957), who was illiterate throughout her life. They had 19 children, but only eight survived to adult age; Kalashnikov was born 17th, and was close to death at age six.

In 1930, the government labeled Timofey Aleksandrovich a kulak, confiscated his property, and deported him to Siberia, along with most of the family. The eldest three siblings, daughters Agasha (b. 1905) and Anna and son Victor, were already married by 1930, and remained in Kuriya. After her husband&#x27;s death in 1930, Aleksandra Frolovna married Efrem Kosach, a widower who had three children of his own.

Mikhail Kalashnikov married twice, the first time to Ekaterina Danilovna Astakhova of Altai Krai. He married the second time to Ekaterina Viktorovna Moiseyeva (1921–1977). She was an engineer and did much technical drawing work for her husband. They had four children: daughters Nelli (b. 1942), Elena (b. 1948) and Natalya (1953–1983), and a son Victor (1942–2018). Victor also became a prominent small arms designer.

The title to the AK-47 trademark belonged to Mikhail Kalashnikov&#x27;s family until 4 April 2016, when the Kalashnikov Concern won a lawsuit to invalidate the registration of the trademark.

<text>A multi-user dungeon (MUD, ), also known as a multi-user dimension or multi-user domain, is a multiplayer real-time virtual world, usually text-based or storyboarded. MUDs combine elements of role-playing games, hack and slash, player versus player, interactive fiction, and online chat. Players can read or view descriptions of rooms, objects, other players, and non-player characters, and perform actions in the virtual world that are typically also described. Players typically interact with each other and the world by typing commands that resemble a natural language, as well as using a character typically called an avatar.

Traditional MUDs implement a role-playing video game set in a fantasy world populated by fictional races and monsters, with players choosing classes in order to gain specific skills or powers. The objective of this sort of game is to slay monsters, explore a fantasy world, complete quests, go on adventures, create a story by roleplaying, and advance the created character. Many MUDs were fashioned around the dice-rolling rules of the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; series of games.

Such fantasy settings for MUDs are common, while many others have science fiction settings or are based on popular books, movies, animations, periods of history, worlds populated by anthropomorphic animals, and so on. Not all MUDs are games; some are designed for educational purposes, while others are purely chat environments, and the flexible nature of many MUD servers leads to their occasional use in areas ranging from computer science research to geoinformatics to medical informatics to analytical chemistry. MUDs have attracted the interest of academic scholars from many fields, including communications, sociology, law, and economics. At one time, there was interest from the United States military in using them for teleconferencing.

Most MUDs are run as hobbies and are free to play; some may accept donations or allow players to purchase virtual items, while others charge a monthly subscription fee. MUDs can be accessed via standard telnet clients, or specialized MUD clients, which are designed to improve the user experience. Numerous games are listed at various web portals, such as The Mud Connector.

The history of modern massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) like &quot;EverQuest&quot; and &quot;Ultima Online&quot;, and related virtual world genres such as the social virtual worlds exemplified by &quot;Second Life&quot;, can be traced directly back to the MUD genre. Indeed, before the invention of the term MMORPG, games of this style were simply called graphical MUDs. A number of influential MMORPG designers began as MUD developers and/or players (such as Raph Koster, Brad McQuaid, Matt Firor, and Brian Green) or were involved with early MUDs (like Mark Jacobs and J. Todd Coleman).

==Early history==
=== Origins ===
&quot;Colossal Cave Adventure&quot;, created in 1975 by Will Crowther on a DEC PDP-10 computer, was the first widely played adventure game. The game was significantly expanded in 1976 by Don Woods. Also called &quot;Adventure&quot;, it contained many D&amp;D features and references, including a computer controlled dungeon master.

Numerous dungeon crawlers were created on the PLATO system at the University of Illinois and other American universities that used PLATO, beginning in 1975. Among them were &quot;pedit5&quot;, &quot;oubliette&quot;, &quot;moria&quot;, &quot;avatar&quot;, &quot;krozair&quot;, &quot;dungeon&quot;, &quot;dnd&quot;, &quot;crypt&quot;, and &quot;drygulch&quot;. By 1978–79, these games were heavily in use on various PLATO systems, and exhibited a marked increase in sophistication in terms of 3D graphics, storytelling, user involvement, team play, and depth of objects and monsters in the dungeons.

Inspired by &quot;Adventure&quot;, a group of students at MIT in the summer of 1977 wrote a game for the PDP-10 minicomputer; called &quot;Zork&quot;, it became quite popular on the ARPANET. &quot;Zork&quot; was ported, under the filename DUNGEN (&quot;dungeon&quot;), to FORTRAN by a programmer working at DEC in 1978.

In 1978 Roy Trubshaw, a student at the University of Essex in the UK, started working on a multi-user adventure game in the MACRO-10 assembly language for a DEC PDP-10. He named the game &quot;MUD&quot; (&quot;Multi-User Dungeon&quot;), in tribute to the &quot;Dungeon&quot; variant of &quot;Zork&quot;, which Trubshaw had greatly enjoyed playing. Trubshaw converted MUD to BCPL (the predecessor of C), before handing over development to Richard Bartle, a fellow student at the University of Essex, in 1980. The game revolved around gaining points till one achieved the Wizard rank, giving the character immortality and special powers over mortals.

=== Wider access and early derivatives ===

&quot;MUD&quot;, better known as &quot;Essex MUD&quot; and &quot;MUD1&quot; in later years, ran on the University of Essex network, and became more widely accessible when a guest account was set up that allowed users on JANET (a British academic X.25 computer network) to connect on weekends and between the hours of 2 AM and 8 AM on weekdays. It became the first Internet multiplayer online role-playing game in 1980 and started the online gaming industry as a whole when the university connected its internal network to ARPANet.

The original &quot;MUD&quot; game was closed down in late 1987, reportedly under pressure from CompuServe, to whom Richard Bartle had licensed the game. This left &quot;MIST&quot;, a derivative of &quot;MUD1&quot; with similar gameplay, as the only remaining MUD running on the University of Essex network, becoming one of the first of its kind to attain broad popularity. &quot;MIST&quot; ran until the machine that hosted it, a PDP-10, was superseded in early 1991.

1985 saw the origin of a number of projects inspired by the original &quot;MUD&quot;. These included &quot;Gods&quot; by Ben Laurie, a &quot;MUD1&quot; clone that included online creation in its endgame, and which became a commercial MUD in 1988; and &quot;MirrorWorld&quot;, a tolkienesque MUD started by Pip Cordrey who gathered some people on a BBS he ran to create a &quot;MUD1&quot; clone that would run on a home computer.

Neil Newell, an avid &quot;MUD1&quot; player, started programming his own MUD called &quot;SHADES&quot; during Christmas 1985, because &quot;MUD1&quot; was closed down during the holidays. Starting out as a hobby, &quot;SHADES&quot; became accessible in the UK as a commercial MUD via British Telecom&#x27;s Prestel and Micronet networks. A scandal on &quot;SHADES&quot; led to the closure of Micronet, as described in Indra Sinha&#x27;s net-memoir, &quot;The Cybergypsies&quot;.

At the same time, Compunet started a project named &quot;Multi-User Galaxy Game&quot; as a science fiction alternative to &quot;MUD1&quot;, a copy of which they were running on their system at the time. When one of the two programmers left CompuNet, the remaining programmer, Alan Lenton, decided to rewrite the game from scratch and named it &quot;Federation II&quot; (at the time no &quot;Federation I&quot; existed). The MUD was officially launched in 1989. &quot;Federation II&quot; was later picked up by AOL, where it became known simply as &quot;Federation: Adult Space Fantasy&quot;. &quot;Federation&quot; later left AOL to run on its own after AOL began offering unlimited service.

=== Other early MUD-like games ===
In 1978, around the same time Roy Trubshaw wrote &quot;MUD&quot;, Alan E. Klietz wrote a game called &quot;Scepter&quot; (Scepter of Goth), and later called &quot;Milieu&quot; using Multi-Pascal on a CDC Cyber 6600 series mainframe which was operated by the Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium. Klietz ported &quot;Milieu&quot; to an IBM XT in 1983, naming the new port &quot;Scepter of Goth&quot;. &quot;Scepter&quot; supported 10 to 16 simultaneous users, typically connecting in by modem. It was the first commercial MUD; franchises were sold to a number of locations. &quot;Scepter&quot; was first owned and run by GamBit (of Minneapolis, Minnesota), founded by Bob Alberti. GamBit&#x27;s assets were later sold to Interplay Productions.

In 1984, Mark Peterson wrote &quot;The Realm of Angmar&quot;, beginning as a clone of &quot;Scepter of Goth&quot;. In 1994, Peterson rewrote &quot;The Realm of Angmar&quot;, adapting it to MS-DOS (the basis for many dial-in BBS systems), and renamed it &quot;Swords of Chaos&quot;. For a few years this was a popular form of MUD, hosted on a number of BBS systems, until widespread Internet access eliminated most BBSes.

In 1984, Mark Jacobs created and deployed a commercial gaming site, &quot;Gamers World&quot;. The site featured two games coded and designed by Jacobs, a MUD called &quot;Aradath&quot; (which was later renamed, upgraded and ported to GEnie as &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Gate&quot;) and a 4X science-fiction game called &quot;Galaxy&quot;, which was also ported to GEnie. At its peak, the site had about 100 monthly subscribers to both &quot;Aradath&quot; and &quot;Galaxy&quot;. GEnie was shut down in the late 1990s, although &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Gate&quot; was later brought to AOL before it was finally released on its own. Dragon&#x27;s Gate was closed on February 10, 2007.

In the summer of 1980, University of Virginia classmates John Taylor and Kelton Flinn wrote &quot;Dungeons of Kesmai&quot;, a six player game inspired by &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; which used roguelike ASCII graphics. They founded the Kesmai company in 1982 and in 1985 an enhanced version of &quot;Dungeons of Kesmai&quot;, &quot;Island of Kesmai&quot;, was launched on CompuServe. Later, its 2-D graphical descendant &quot;Legends of Kesmai&quot; was launched on AOL in 1996. The games were retired commercially in 2000.

The popularity of MUDs of the University of Essex tradition escalated in the United States during the late 1980s when affordable personal computers with 300 to 2400 bit/s modems enabled role-players to log into multi-line BBSs and online service providers such as CompuServe. During this time it was sometimes said that MUD stands for &quot;Multi Undergraduate Destroyer&quot; due to their popularity among college students and the amount of time devoted to them.

&quot;&quot; was published by Yehuda Simmons in 1989. It was the first persistent game world of its kind without the traditional hourly resets and points-based puzzle solving progression systems. Avalon introduced equilibrium and balance (cooldowns), skill-based player vs player combat and concepts such as player-run governments and player housing.

=== Later history ===
In 2004, significant usages of MUDs included &quot;online gaming, education...socializing&quot;, and religious rituals or other religious activities.

==Popular variants==

===AberMUD===
The first popular MUD codebase was AberMUD, written in 1987 by Alan Cox, named after the University of Wales, Aberystwyth. Alan Cox had played the original University of Essex MUD, and the gameplay was heavily influenced by it. AberMUD was initially written in B for a Honeywell L66 mainframe under GCOS3/TSS. In late 1988 it was ported to C, which enabled it to spread rapidly to many Unix platforms upon its release in 1989. AberMUD&#x27;s popularity resulted in several inspired works, the most notable of which were TinyMUD, LPMud, and DikuMUD.

===TinyMUD===
&quot;Monster&quot; was a multi-user adventure game created by Richard Skrenta for the VAX and written in VMS Pascal. It was publicly released in November 1988. &quot;Monster&quot; was disk-based and modifications to the game were immediate. &quot;Monster&quot; pioneered the approach of allowing players to build the game world, setting new puzzles or creating dungeons for other players to explore. Monster, which comprised about 60,000 lines of code, had many features which appeared to be designed to allow &quot;Colossal Cave Adventure&quot; to work in it. Though there never were many network-accessible Monster servers, it inspired James Aspnes to create a stripped-down version of &quot;Monster&quot; which he called TinyMUD.

TinyMUD, written in C and released in late 1989, spawned a number of descendants, including TinyMUCK and TinyMUSH. TinyMUCK version 2 contained a full programming language named MUF (Multi-User Forth), while MUSH greatly expanded the command interface. To distance itself from the combat-oriented traditional MUDs it was said that the &quot;D&quot; in TinyMUD stood for Multi-User &quot;Domain&quot; or &quot;Dimension&quot;; this, along with the eventual popularity of acronyms other than MUD (such as MUCK, MUSH, MUSE, and so on) for this kind of server, led to the eventual adoption of the term MU* to refer to the TinyMUD family. UberMUD, UnterMUD, and MOO were inspired by TinyMUD but are not direct descendants.

TinyMUD is also used to refer to the first database run under the TinyMUD codebase, which is also known as TinyMUD Classic; it ran from August 1989 to April 1990, and still comes back up every August during a holiday called Brigadoon Day, a reference to the Scottish village in the musical Brigadoon.

===Hourglass===
The first version of Hourglass was written by Yehuda Simmons and later Daniel James for &quot;&quot; which debuted in 1989 at the last of the London MUD mega Meets aptly named &quot;Adventure &#x27;89&quot; and initially hosted on the IOWA system. Initially written in ARM assembly language on the Acorn Archimedes 440, in 1994 it made the leap from the venerable Archimedes to Debian Linux on the PC and later Red Hat where, other than shifting to Ubuntu, it has remained ever since. An early version of Hourglass was also ported to the PC, named Vortex, by Ben Maizels in 1992.

Although written specifically for &quot;Avalon: The Legend Lives&quot;, it went on to spawn a number of games, including &quot;Avalon: The First Age&quot;, which ran from 1999 to 2014. The now defunct 1996 &quot;Age of Thrones&quot; and notably &quot;Achaea, Dreams of Divine Lands&quot; started life in Vortex prior to moving to its own Rapture engine. Hourglass continues to be developed as of 2016 and &quot;Avalon: The Legend Lives&quot; currently has 2,901,325 written words and 2,248,374 lines of game code (with 2,417,900 instructions). The original game came in at 1 KB in 1989, compared to 102 GB in January 2016.

===LPMud===

In 1989, LPMud was developed by Lars Pensjö (hence the LP in LPMud). Pensjö had been an avid player of TinyMUD and AberMUD and wanted to create a world with the flexibility of TinyMUD and the gameplay of AberMUD. In order to accomplish this he wrote what is nowadays known as a virtual machine, which he called the LPMud driver, that ran the C-like LPC programming language used to create the game world. Pensjö&#x27;s interest in LPMud eventually waned and development was carried on by others such as Jörn &quot;Amylaar&quot; Rennecke, Felix &quot;Dworkin&quot; Croes, Tim &quot;Beek&quot; Hollebeek and Lars Düning. During the early 1990s, LPMud was one of the most popular MUD codebases. Descendants of the original LPMud include MudOS, DGD, SWLPC, FluffOS, and the Pike programming language, the latter the work of long-time LPMud developer Fredrik &quot;Profezzorn&quot; Hübinette.

===DikuMUD===

In 1990, the release of DikuMUD, which was inspired by AberMUD, led to a virtual explosion of hack and slash MUDs based upon its code. DikuMUD inspired numerous derivative codebases, including CircleMUD, Merc, ROM, SMAUG, and GodWars. The original Diku team comprised Sebastian Hammer, Tom Madsen, Katja Nyboe, Michael Seifert, and Hans Henrik Staerfeldt. DikuMUD had a key influence on the early evolution of the MMORPG genre, with &quot;EverQuest&quot; (created by avid DikuMUD player Brad McQuaid) displaying such Diku-like gameplay that Verant developers were made to issue a sworn statement that no actual DikuMUD code was incorporated.

===Simutronics===

In 1987, David Whatley, having previously played &quot;Scepter of Goth&quot; and &quot;Island of Kesmai&quot;, founded Simutronics with Tom and Susan Zelinski. In the same year they demonstrated a prototype of &quot;GemStone&quot; to GEnie. After a short-lived instance of &quot;GemStone II&quot;, &quot;GemStone III&quot; was officially launched in February 1990. &quot;GemStone III&quot; became available on AOL in September 1995, followed by the release of &quot;DragonRealms&quot; in February 1996. By the end of 1997 &quot;GemStone III&quot; and &quot;DragonRealms&quot; had become the first and second most played games on AOL.

==Gameplay==

The typical MUD will describe to the player the room or area they are standing in, listing the objects, players and non-player characters (NPCs) in the area, as well as all of the exits. To carry out a task the player would enter a text command such as take apple or attack dragon. Movement around the game environment is generally accomplished by entering the direction (or an abbreviation of it) in which the player wishes to move, for example typing north or just n would cause the player to exit the current area via the path to the north.

MUD clients are computer applications that make the MUD telnet interface more accessible to users, with features such as syntax highlighting, keyboard macros, and connection assistance. Prominent clients include TinyTalk, TinyFugue, TinTin++, and zMUD.

==Style==
While there have been many variations in overall focus, gameplay and features in MUDs, some distinct sub-groups have formed that can be used to help categorize different game mechanics, game genres and non-game uses.

===Hack and slash MUDs===

Perhaps the most common approach to game design in MUDs is to loosely emulate the structure of a &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; campaign focused more on fighting and advancement than role-playing. When these MUDs restrict player-killing in favor of player versus environment conflict and questing, they are labeled hack and slash MUDs. This may be considered particularly appropriate since, due to the room-based nature of traditional MUDs, ranged combat is typically difficult to implement, resulting in most MUDs equipping characters mainly with close-combat weapons. This style of game was also historically referred to within the MUD genre as &quot;adventure games&quot;, but video gaming as a whole has developed a meaning of &quot;adventure game&quot; that is greatly at odds with this usage.

===Player versus player MUDs===

Most MUDs restrict player versus player combat, often abbreviated as PK (Player Killing). This is accomplished through hard coded restrictions and various forms of social intervention. MUDs without these restrictions are commonly known as PK MUDs. Taking this a step further are MUDs devoted &quot;solely&quot; to this sort of conflict, called pure PK MUDs, the first of which was &quot;Genocide&quot; in 1992. &quot;Genocide&quot; ideas were influential in the evolution of player versus player online gaming.

===Roleplaying MUDs===

Roleplaying MUDs, generally abbreviated as RP MUDs, encourage or enforce that players act out the role of their playing characters at all times. Some RP MUDs provide an immersive gaming environment, while others only provide a virtual world with no game elements. MUDs where roleplay is enforced and the game world is heavily computer-modeled are sometimes known as roleplay intensive MUDs, or RPIMUDs. In many cases, role-playing MUDs attempt to differentiate themselves from hack and slash types, by dropping the &quot;MUD&quot; name entirely, and instead using MUX (Multi-User Experience) or MUSH (Multi-User Shared Hallucination).

===Social MUDs===

Social MUDs de-emphasize game elements in favor of an environment designed primarily for socializing. They are differentiated from talkers by retaining elements beyond online chat, typically online creation as a community activity and some element of role-playing. Often such MUDs have broadly defined contingents of socializers and roleplayers. Server software in the TinyMUD family, or MU*, is traditionally used to implement social MUDs.

===Talkers===

A less-known MUD variant is the talker, a variety of online chat environment typically based on server software like ew-too or NUTS. Most of the early Internet talkers were LPMuds with the majority of the complex game machinery stripped away, leaving just the communication commands. The first Internet talker was &quot;Cat Chat&quot; in 1990.

===Educational MUDs===
Taking advantage of the flexibility of MUD server software, some MUDs are designed for educational purposes rather than gaming or chat. &quot;MicroMUSE&quot; is considered by some to have been the first educational MUD, but it can be argued that its evolution into this role was not complete until 1994, which would make the first of many educational MOOs, &quot;Diversity University&quot; in 1993, also the first educational MUD. The MUD medium lends itself naturally to constructionist learning pedagogical approaches. The Mud Institute (TMI) was an LPMud opened in February 1992 as a gathering place for people interested in developing LPMud and teaching LPC after it became clear that Lars Pensjö had lost interest in the project. TMI focussed on both the LPMud driver and library, the driver evolving into MudOS, the TMI Mudlib was never officially released, but was influential in the development of other libraries.

===Graphical MUDs===

A graphical MUD is a MUD that uses computer graphics to represent parts of the virtual world and its visitors. A prominent early graphical MUD was &quot;Habitat&quot;, written by Randy Farmer and Chip Morningstar for Lucasfilm in 1985. Some graphical MUDs require players to download a special client and the game&#x27;s artwork, while others provide a rich experience by being website-based. Graphical MUDs range from simply enhancing the user interface (e.g. Wolfery provides an option to set the room picture, but otherwise remains a text-based interaction) to simulating 3D worlds with visual spatial relationships and customized avatar appearances (e.g. Ultima Online provides a rich point-and-click experience).

Games such as &quot;Meridian 59&quot;, &quot;EverQuest&quot;, &quot;Ultima Online&quot; and &quot;Dark Age of Camelot&quot; were routinely called graphical MUDs in their earlier years. &quot;RuneScape&quot; was actually originally intended to be a &quot;text-based&quot; MUD, but graphics were added very early in development. However, with the increase in computing power and Internet connectivity during the late 1990s, and the shift of online gaming to the mass market, the term &quot;graphical MUD&quot; fell out of favor, being replaced by MMORPG (massively multiplayer online role-playing game) a term coined by Richard Garriott in 1997.

== Development ==

Within a MUD&#x27;s technical infrastructure, a mudlib (concatenation of &quot;MUD library&quot;) defines the rules of the in-game world. Examples of mudlibs include Ain Soph Mudlib, CDlib, Discworld Mudlib, Lima Mudlib, LPUniversity Mudlib, MorgenGrauen Mudlib, Nightmare Mudlib, and TMI Mudlib.

MUDs that include object-oriented programming can add complex features, such as adding elements to the game world and giving users more ways to interact with it, that MUDs without it cannot.

== Community ==

MUD history has been preserved primarily through community sites and blogs and not through mainstream sources with journalistic repute. As of the late 1990s, a website called The Mud Connector has served as a central and curated repository for active MUDs. In 1995, &quot;The Independent&quot; reported that over 60,000 people regularly played about 600 MUDs, up from 170 MUDs three years prior. &quot;The Independent&quot; also noted distinct patterns of socialization within MUD communities.

In 2004, MUDs were relatively popular in the United States and mostly text-based.

Seraphina Brennan of &quot;Massively&quot; wrote that the MUD community was &quot;in decline&quot; as of 2009.

==Psychology and engagement==
Sherry Turkle developed a theory that the constant use (and in many cases, overuse) of MUDs allows users to develop different personalities in their environments. She uses examples, dating back to the text-based MUDs of the mid-1990s, showing college students who simultaneously live different lives through characters in separate MUDs, up to three at a time, all while doing schoolwork. The students claimed that it was a way to &quot;shut off&quot; their own lives for a while and become part of another reality. Turkle claims that this could present a psychological problem of identity for today&#x27;s youths.

&quot;A Story About A Tree&quot; is a short essay written by Raph Koster regarding the death of a &quot;LegendMUD&quot; player named Karyn, raising the subject of inter-human relationships in virtual worlds.

Observations of MUD-play show styles of play that can be roughly categorized. Achievers focus on concrete measurements of success such as experience points, levels, and wealth; Explorers investigate every nook and cranny of the game, and evaluate different game mechanical options; Socializers devote most of their energy to interacting with other players; and then there are Killers who focus on interacting negatively with other players, if permitted, killing the other characters or otherwise thwarting their play. Few players play only one way; most exhibit a diverse style. According to Richard Bartle, &quot;People go there as part of a hero&#x27;s journey—a means of self-discovery&quot;.

Research has suggested that various factors combine in MUDs to provide users with a sense of &quot;presence&quot; rather than simply communication.

==Grammatical usage and derived terms==
As a noun, the word MUD is variously written MUD, Mud, and mud, depending on speaker and context. It is also used as a verb, with to mud meaning to play or interact with a MUD and mudding referring to the act of doing so. A mudder is, naturally, one who MUDs. Compound words and portmanteaux such as mudlist, mudsex, and mudflation are also regularly coined. Puns on the &quot;wet dirt&quot; meaning of &quot;mud&quot; are endemic, as with, for example, the names of the ROM (Rivers of MUD), MUCK, MUSH, and CoffeeMUD codebases and the MUD &quot;Muddy Waters&quot;.

<text>Muslims () are people who adhere to Islam, a monotheistic religion belonging to the Abrahamic tradition. They consider the Quran, the foundational religious text of Islam, to be the verbatim word of the God of Abraham (or &quot;Allah&quot;) as it was revealed to Muhammad, the last Islamic prophet. Alongside the Quran, Muslims also believe in previous revelations, such as the Tawrat (Torah), the Zabur (Psalms), and the Injeel (Gospel). These earlier revelations are associated with Judaism and Christianity, which are regarded by Muslims as earlier versions of Islam. The majority of Muslims also follow the teachings and practices attributed to Muhammad (&quot;sunnah&quot;) as recorded in traditional accounts (hadith).

With an estimated population of almost 1.9 billion followers as of 2020 year estimation, Muslims comprise around 25% of the world&#x27;s total population. In descending order, the percentage of people who identify as Muslims on each continental landmass stands at: 45% of Africa, 25% of Asia and Oceania collectively, 6% of Europe, and 1% of the Americas. Additionally, in subdivided geographical regions, the figure stands at: 91% of the Middle East–North Africa, 90% of Central Asia, 65% of the Caucasus, 42% of Southeast Asia, 32% of South Asia, and 42% of sub-Saharan Africa.

While, there are several Islamic schools and branches, as well as non-denominational Muslims, the two largest denominations are Sunni Islam (75–90% of all Muslims) and Shia Islam (10–13% of all Muslims). By sheer numbers, South Asia accounts for the largest portion (31%) of the global Muslim population. By country, Indonesia is the largest in the Muslim world, holding around 12% of all Muslims worldwide; with Pakistan having the second largest number of Muslims in the world after Indonesia. Outside of the Muslim-majority countries, India and China are home to the largest (11%) and second-largest (2%) Muslim populations, respectively. Due to high Muslim population growth, Islam is the fastest-growing religion in the world. Muslims have experienced persecution of varying severity, especially in China, India, some parts of Africa, and Southeast Asia.

==Etymology==

The word &quot;muslim&quot; or &quot;moslem&quot; is the active participle of the same verb of which &quot;islām&quot; is a verbal noun, based on the triliteral &quot;S-L-M&quot; &quot;to be whole, intact&quot;. A female adherent is a &quot;muslima&quot; (; also transliterated as &quot;muslimah&quot;). The plural form in Arabic is &quot;muslimūn&quot; () or &quot;muslimīn&quot; (), and its feminine equivalent is &quot;muslimāt&quot; ().

The ordinary word in English is &quot;Muslim&quot;. For most of the 20th century, the preferred spelling in English was &quot;Moslem&quot;, but this has now fallen into disuse. That spelling and its pronunciation was opposed by many Muslims in English-speaking countries because it resembled the Arabic word &quot;aẓ-ẓālim&quot; (), meaning &quot;the oppressor&quot;. In the United States, the Associated Press instructed news outlets to switch to the spelling &quot;Muslim&quot; in 1991, making it the most common spelling thereafter. The last major newspaper in the United Kingdom to use the spelling &quot;Moslem&quot; was the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, which switched to &quot;Muslim&quot; in 2004.

The word &quot;Mosalman&quot; or &quot;Mussulman&quot; (, alternatively &quot;musalmān&quot;) is a common equivalent for &quot;Muslim&quot; used in Central and South Asia. In English it was sometimes spelled Mussulman and has become archaic in usage; however, cognates of this word remain the standard term for &quot;Muslim&quot; in various other European languages. Until at least the mid-1960s, many English-language writers used the term &quot;Mohammedans&quot; or &quot;Mahometans&quot;. Although such terms were not necessarily intended to be pejorative, Muslims argue that the terms are offensive because they allegedly imply that Muslims worship Muhammad rather than God. Other obsolete terms include &quot;Muslimite&quot; and &quot;Muslimist&quot;. In medieval Europe, Muslims were commonly called Saracens.

The Muslim philologist Ibn al-Anbari said:

In several places in the Quran, the word &quot;muslim&quot; conveys a universal meaning, beyond the description of the followers of Muhammad, for example:

Until the 8th century, the term &quot;muslim&quot; was more inclusive, including anyone who was considered to be submitting to God (e.g. Christians and Jews), and the term &quot;mu&#x27;min&quot; was instead used to refer to believers in Islam as a distinct religion.

==Qualifier==

To become a Muslim and to convert to Islam, it is essential to utter the &quot;Shahada&quot; in front of Muslim witnesses, one of the Five Pillars of Islam, a declaration of faith and trust that professes that there is only one God &quot;(Allah)&quot; and that Muhammad is God&#x27;s messenger. It is a set statement normally recited in Arabic: &quot;ašhadu ʾan-lā ʾilāha ʾillā-llāhu wa ʾašhadu ʾanna muħammadan rasūlu-llāh&quot; () &quot;I testify that there is no god [worthy of worship] except Allah, and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah.&quot;

In Sunni Islam, the shahada has two parts: &quot;la ilaha illa&#x27;llah&quot; (there is no god but Allah), and &quot;Muhammadun rasul Allah&quot; (Muhammad is the messenger of God), which are sometimes referred to as the first &quot;shahada&quot; and the second &quot;shahada&quot;. The first statement of the shahada is also known as the &quot;tahlīl&quot;.

In Shia Islam, the shahada also has a third part, a phrase concerning Ali, the first Shia Imam and the fourth Rashid caliph of Sunni Islam: (), which translates to &quot;Ali is the &quot;wali&quot; of God&quot;.

In Quranist Islam, the shahada is the testimony that there is no god but Allah (&quot;la ilaha illa&#x27;llah&quot; ).

The religious practices of Muslims are enumerated in the Five Pillars of Islam: the declaration of faith (&quot;shahadah&quot;), daily prayers (&quot;salah&quot;), almsgiving (&quot;zakat&quot;), fasting during the month of Ramadan (&quot;sawm&quot;), and the pilgrimage to Mecca (&quot;hajj&quot;) at least once in a lifetime.

==In Islamic theology==

The majority of theological traditions of Islam accept that works do not determine if someone is a Muslim or not. God alone would know about the belief of a person. Fellow Muslims can only accept the personal declaration of faith. Only the Khawārij developed an understanding of Muslim identity based mainly on the adherence to liturgical and legal norms.

When asked about one&#x27;s beliefs, it is recommended to say the &quot;Istit̲h̲nāʾ&quot;, for example, &quot;&quot;in-sha&#x27;allah&quot; I am Muslim a believer&quot; (so God will, I am Muslim), since only God knows the future of a person. Among Asharites, it is also seen as a sign of humility and the individual&#x27;s longing to improve, because the creature has no assurance of their own state (of belief) until the end of life.

The Qur&#x27;an describes many prophets and messengers within Judaism and Christianity, and their respective followers, as Muslim. Some of those that were mentioned are: Adam, Noah, Abraham, Ishmael, Jacob, Moses, and Jesus and his apostles are all considered to be Muslims in the Qur&#x27;an. The Qur&#x27;an states that these men were Muslims because they submitted to God, preached His message and upheld His values, which included praying, charity, fasting and pilgrimage. Thus, in Surah 3:52 of the Qur&#x27;an, Jesus&#x27; disciples tell him, &quot;We believe in God; and you be our witness that we are Muslims (&quot;wa-shahad be anna muslimūn&quot;).&quot; In Islamic belief, before the Qur&#x27;an, God had given the Tawrat (Torah) to the prophets and messengers amongst the Children of Israel, the Zabur (Psalms) to David and the Injil (Gospel) to Jesus, who are all considered important Muslim prophets.

==Demographics==

The most populous Muslim-majority country is Indonesia, home to 12.7% of the world&#x27;s Muslims, followed by Pakistan (11.0%), Bangladesh (9.2%), Nigeria (5.3%) and Egypt (4.9%). About 20% of the world&#x27;s Muslims live in the Middle East and North Africa. Non-majority India contains 10.9% of the world&#x27;s Muslims. Arab Muslims form the largest ethnic group among Muslims in the world, followed by Bengalis, and Punjabis.

Over 75–90% of Muslims are Sunni. The second and third largest sects, Shia and Ahmadiyya, make up 10–13%, and 1% respectively. While the majority of the population in the Middle East identify as either Sunni or Shia, a significant number of Muslims identify as non-denominational.

With about 1.8 billion followers (2015), almost a quarter of earth&#x27;s population, Islam is the second-largest and the fastest-growing religion in the world, primarily due to the young age and high fertility rate of Muslims, with Muslims having a rate of (3.1) compared to the world average of (2.5). According to the same study, religious switching has no impact on Muslim population, since the number of people who embrace Islam and those who leave Islam are roughly equal.

As of 2010, 49 countries in the world had Muslim majorities, in which Muslims comprised more than 50% of the population. In 2010, 74.1% of the world&#x27;s Muslim population lived in countries where Muslims are in the majority, while 25.9% of the world&#x27;s Muslim population lived in countries where Muslims are in the minority. A Pew Center study in 2010 found that 3% of the world&#x27;s Muslims population live in non-Muslim-majority developed countries. India&#x27;s Muslim population is the world&#x27;s largest Muslim-minority population in the world (11% of the world&#x27;s Muslim population). Followed by Ethiopia (28 million), China (22 million), Russia (16 million) and Tanzania (13 million). Sizable minorities are also found in the Americas (5.2 million or 0.6%), Australia (714,000 or 1.9%) and parts of Europe (44 million or 6%).

A Pew Center study in 2016 found that Muslims have the highest number of adherents under the age of 15 (34% of the total Muslim population) of any major religion, while only 7% are aged 60+ (the smallest percentage of any major religion). According to the same study, Muslims have the highest fertility rates (3.1) of any major religious group. The study also found that Muslims (tied with Hindus) have the lowest average levels of education with an average of 5.6 years of schooling, though both groups have made the largest gains in educational attainment in recent decades among major religions. About 36% of all Muslims have no formal schooling, and Muslims have the lowest average levels of higher education of any major religious group, with only 8% having graduate and post-graduate degrees.

==Culture==

Muslim culture or Islamic culture are terms used to describe the cultural practices common to Muslims and historically Islamic people. The early forms of Muslim culture, from the Rashidun Caliphate to early Umayyad period, were predominantly Arab, Byzantine, Persian and Levantine. With the rapid expansion of the Arab Islamic empires, Muslim culture has influenced and assimilated much from the Indonesian, Pakistani (Punjabi, Pashtun, Baloch Kashmiri, Sindhi), Hindustani, Bengali, Nigerian, Egyptian, Persian, Turkic, Caucasian, Malay, Somali, Berber, and Moro cultures.

<text>In multiplayer online games, a MUSH (a backronymed variation on MUD most often expanded as Multi-User Shared Hallucination, though Multi-User Shared Hack, Habitat, and Holodeck are also observed) is a text-based online social medium to which multiple users are connected at the same time. MUSHes are often used for online social interaction and role-playing games, although the first forms of MUSH do not appear to be coded specifically to implement gaming activity. MUSH software was originally derived from MUDs; today&#x27;s two major MUSH variants are descended from TinyMUD, which was fundamentally a social game.
MUSH has forked over the years and there are now different varieties with different features, although most have strong similarities and one who is fluent in coding one variety can switch to coding for the other with only a little effort. The source code for most widely used MUSH servers is open source and available from its current maintainers.

A primary feature of MUSH codebases that tends to distinguish it from other multi-user environments is the ability, by default, of any player to extend the world by creating new rooms or objects and specifying their behavior in the MUSH&#x27;s internal scripting language. 

The programming language for MUSH, usually referred to as &quot;MUSHcode&quot; or &quot;softcode&quot; (to distinguish it from &quot;hardcode&quot;the language in which the MUSH server itself is written) was developed by Larry Foard. TinyMUSH started life as a set of enhancements to the original TinyMUD code. &quot;MUSHcode&quot; is similar in syntax to Lisp.

==Roleplay==
Traditionally, roleplay consists of a series of &quot;poses&quot;. Each character makes a &quot;pose&quot;that is, writes a description of speech, actions, etc. which the character performs. Special commands allow players to print OOC (out of character) messages, distinguished by a prefixed string from IC (in character) action. This medium borrows traits from both improvisational stage acting and writing. Roleplaying is one of the primary activities of MUSHes, along with socializing.

There is nothing in the code base that restricts a new MUSH from being a traditional hack-and-slash MUD-style game. However, the earliest uses of MUSH servers were for roleplaying and socializing, and these early trends have largely governed their descendants.

==Administration==
All MUSH servers provide a flag that, when set on a player, bestows the ability to view and modify nearly everything in the game&#x27;s database. Such players are usually called Wizards, and typically form the basis for the MUSH administration.

==Software==
Maintainers and developers of MUSH servers have traditionally shared ideas with one another, so most MUSH servers include concepts or code developed originally in other servers. There is particular interest in ensuring that common MUSHcode features work similarly across servers.

PennMUSH, TinyMUSH, TinyMUX and RhostMUSH are all open-source MUSH servers

<text>Microevolution is the change in allele frequencies that occurs over time within a population. This change is due to four different processes: mutation, selection (natural and artificial), gene flow and genetic drift. This change happens over a relatively short (in evolutionary terms) amount of time compared to the changes termed macroevolution.

Population genetics is the branch of biology that provides the mathematical structure for the study of the process of microevolution. Ecological genetics concerns itself with observing microevolution in the wild. Typically, observable instances of evolution are examples of microevolution; for example, bacterial strains that have antibiotic resistance.

Microevolution provides the raw material for macroevolution.

==Difference from macroevolution==
Macroevolution is guided by sorting of interspecific variation (&quot;species selection&quot;), as opposed to sorting of intraspecific variation in microevolution. Species selection may occur as (a) effect-macroevolution, where organism-level traits (aggregate traits) affect speciation and extinction rates, and (b) strict-sense species selection, where species-level traits (e.g. geographical range) affect speciation and extinction rates. Macroevolution does not produce evolutionary novelties, but it determines their proliferation within the clades in which they evolved, and it adds species-level traits as non-organismic factors of sorting to this process.

==Four processes==
===Mutation===
Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence of a cell&#x27;s genome and are caused by radiation, viruses, transposons and mutagenic chemicals, as well as errors that occur during meiosis or DNA replication. Errors are introduced particularly often in the process of DNA replication, in the polymerization of the second strand. These errors can also be induced by the organism itself, by cellular processes such as hypermutation. Mutations can affect the phenotype of an organism, especially if they occur within the protein coding sequence of a gene. Error rates are usually very low—1 error in every 10–100 million bases—due to the proofreading ability of DNA polymerases. (Without proofreading error rates are a thousandfold higher; because many viruses rely on DNA and RNA polymerases that lack proofreading ability, they experience higher mutation rates.) Processes that increase the rate of changes in DNA are called mutagenic: mutagenic chemicals promote errors in DNA replication, often by interfering with the structure of base-pairing, while UV radiation induces mutations by causing damage to the DNA structure. Chemical damage to DNA occurs naturally as well, and cells use DNA repair mechanisms to repair mismatches and breaks in DNA—nevertheless, the repair sometimes fails to return the DNA to its original sequence.

In organisms that use chromosomal crossover to exchange DNA and recombine genes, errors in alignment during meiosis can also cause mutations. Errors in crossover are especially likely when similar sequences cause partner chromosomes to adopt a mistaken alignment making some regions in genomes more prone to mutating in this way. These errors create large structural changes in DNA sequence—duplications, inversions or deletions of entire regions, or the accidental exchanging of whole parts between different chromosomes (called translocation).

Mutation can result in several different types of change in DNA sequences; these can either have no effect, alter the product of a gene, or prevent the gene from functioning. Studies in the fly &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; suggest that if a mutation changes a protein produced by a gene, this will probably be harmful, with about 70 percent of these mutations having damaging effects, and the remainder being either neutral or weakly beneficial. Due to the damaging effects that mutations can have on cells, organisms have evolved mechanisms such as DNA repair to remove mutations. Therefore, the optimal mutation rate for a species is a trade-off between costs of a high mutation rate, such as deleterious mutations, and the metabolic costs of maintaining systems to reduce the mutation rate, such as DNA repair enzymes. Viruses that use RNA as their genetic material have rapid mutation rates, which can be an advantage since these viruses will evolve constantly and rapidly, and thus evade the defensive responses of e.g. the human immune system.

Mutations can involve large sections of DNA becoming duplicated, usually through genetic recombination. These duplications are a major source of raw material for evolving new genes, with tens to hundreds of genes duplicated in animal genomes every million years. Most genes belong to larger families of genes of shared ancestry. Novel genes are produced by several methods, commonly through the duplication and mutation of an ancestral gene, or by recombining parts of different genes to form new combinations with new functions.

Here, domains act as modules, each with a particular and independent function, that can be mixed together to produce genes encoding new proteins with novel properties. For example, the human eye uses four genes to make structures that sense light: three for color vision and one for night vision; all four arose from a single ancestral gene. Another advantage of duplicating a gene (or even an entire genome) is that this increases redundancy; this allows one gene in the pair to acquire a new function while the other copy performs the original function. Other types of mutation occasionally create new genes from previously noncoding DNA.

===Selection===

&quot;Selection&quot; is the process by which heritable traits that make it more likely for an organism to survive and successfully reproduce become more common in a population over successive generations.

It is sometimes valuable to distinguish between naturally occurring selection, natural selection, and selection that is a manifestation of choices made by humans, artificial selection. This distinction is rather diffuse. Natural selection is nevertheless the dominant part of selection.

The natural genetic variation within a population of organisms means that some individuals will survive more successfully than others in their current environment. Factors which affect reproductive success are also important, an issue which Charles Darwin developed in his ideas on sexual selection.

Natural selection acts on the phenotype, or the observable characteristics of an organism, but the genetic (heritable) basis of any phenotype which gives a reproductive advantage will become more common in a population (see allele frequency). Over time, this process can result in adaptations that specialize organisms for particular ecological niches and may eventually result in the speciation (the emergence of new species).

Natural selection is one of the cornerstones of modern biology. The term was introduced by Darwin in his groundbreaking 1859 book &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;, in which natural selection was described by analogy to artificial selection, a process by which animals and plants with traits considered desirable by human breeders are systematically favored for reproduction. The concept of natural selection was originally developed in the absence of a valid theory of heredity; at the time of Darwin&#x27;s writing, nothing was known of modern genetics. The union of traditional Darwinian evolution with subsequent discoveries in classical and molecular genetics is termed the &quot;modern evolutionary synthesis&quot;. Natural selection remains the primary explanation for adaptive evolution.

===Genetic drift===
Genetic drift is the change in the relative frequency in which a gene variant (allele) occurs in a population due to random sampling. That is, the alleles in the offspring in the population are a random sample of those in the parents. And chance has a role in determining whether a given individual survives and reproduces. A population&#x27;s allele frequency is the fraction or percentage of its gene copies compared to the total number of gene alleles that share a particular form.

Genetic drift is an evolutionary process which leads to changes in allele frequencies over time. It may cause gene variants to disappear completely, and thereby reduce genetic variability. In contrast to natural selection, which makes gene variants more common or less common depending on their reproductive success, the changes due to genetic drift are not driven by environmental or adaptive pressures, and may be beneficial, neutral, or detrimental to reproductive success.

The effect of genetic drift is larger in small populations, and smaller in large populations. Vigorous debates wage among scientists over the relative importance of genetic drift compared with natural selection. Ronald Fisher held the view that genetic drift plays at the most a minor role in evolution, and this remained the dominant view for several decades. In 1968 Motoo Kimura rekindled the debate with his neutral theory of molecular evolution which claims that most of the changes in the genetic material are caused by genetic drift. The predictions of neutral theory, based on genetic drift, do not fit recent data on whole genomes well: these data suggest that the frequencies of neutral alleles change primarily due to selection at linked sites, rather than due to genetic drift by means of sampling error.

===Gene flow===

Gene flow is the exchange of genes between populations, which are usually of the same species. Examples of gene flow within a species include the migration and then breeding of organisms, or the exchange of pollen. Gene transfer between species includes the formation of hybrid organisms and horizontal gene transfer.

Migration into or out of a population can change allele frequencies, as well as introducing genetic variation into a population. Immigration may add new genetic material to the established gene pool of a population. Conversely, emigration may remove genetic material. As barriers to reproduction between two diverging populations are required for the populations to become new species, gene flow may slow this process by spreading genetic differences between the populations. Gene flow is hindered by mountain ranges, oceans and deserts or even man-made structures such as the Great Wall of China, which has hindered the flow of plant genes.

Depending on how far two species have diverged since their most recent common ancestor, it may still be possible for them to produce offspring, as with horses and donkeys mating to produce mules. Such hybrids are generally infertile, due to the two different sets of chromosomes being unable to pair up during meiosis. In this case, closely related species may regularly interbreed, but hybrids will be selected against and the species will remain distinct. However, viable hybrids are occasionally formed and these new species can either have properties intermediate between their parent species, or possess a totally new phenotype. The importance of hybridization in developing new species of animals is unclear, although cases have been seen in many types of animals, with the gray tree frog being a particularly well-studied example.

Hybridization is, however, an important means of speciation in plants, since polyploidy (having more than two copies of each chromosome) is tolerated in plants more readily than in animals. Polyploidy is important in hybrids as it allows reproduction, with the two different sets of chromosomes each being able to pair with an identical partner during meiosis. Polyploid hybrids also have more genetic diversity, which allows them to avoid inbreeding depression in small populations.

Horizontal gene transfer is the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another organism that is not its offspring; this is most common among bacteria. In medicine, this contributes to the spread of antibiotic resistance, as when one bacteria acquires resistance genes it can rapidly transfer them to other species. Horizontal transfer of genes from bacteria to eukaryotes such as the yeast &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; and the adzuki bean beetle &quot;Callosobruchus chinensis&quot; may also have occurred. An example of larger-scale transfers are the eukaryotic bdelloid rotifers, which appear to have received a range of genes from bacteria, fungi, and plants. Viruses can also carry DNA between organisms, allowing transfer of genes even across biological domains. Large-scale gene transfer has also occurred between the ancestors of eukaryotic cells and prokaryotes, during the acquisition of chloroplasts and mitochondria.

&quot;Gene flow&quot; is the transfer of alleles from one population to another.

Migration into or out of a population may be responsible for a marked change in allele frequencies. Immigration may also result in the addition of new genetic variants to the established gene pool of a particular species or population.

There are a number of factors that affect the rate of gene flow between different populations. One of the most significant factors is mobility, as greater mobility of an individual tends to give it greater migratory potential. Animals tend to be more mobile than plants, although pollen and seeds may be carried great distances by animals or wind.

Maintained gene flow between two populations can also lead to a combination of the two gene pools, reducing the genetic variation between the two groups. It is for this reason that gene flow strongly acts against speciation, by recombining the gene pools of the groups, and thus, repairing the developing differences in genetic variation that would have led to full speciation and creation of daughter species.

For example, if a species of grass grows on both sides of a highway, pollen is likely to be transported from one side to the other and vice versa. If this pollen is able to fertilise the plant where it ends up and produce viable offspring, then the alleles in the pollen have effectively been able to move from the population on one side of the highway to the other.

==Origin and extended use of the term==

===Origin===
The term &quot;microevolution&quot; was first used by botanist Robert Greenleaf Leavitt in the journal &quot;Botanical Gazette&quot; in 1909, addressing what he called the &quot;mystery&quot; of how formlessness gives rise to form.
:&quot;..The production of form from formlessness in the egg-derived individual, the multiplication of parts and the orderly creation of diversity among them, in an actual evolution, of which anyone may ascertain the facts, but of which no one has dissipated the mystery in any significant measure. This microevolution forms an integral part of the grand evolution problem and lies at the base of it, so that we shall have to understand the minor process before we can thoroughly comprehend the more general one...&quot;

However, Leavitt was using the term to describe what we would now call developmental biology; it was not until Russian Entomologist Yuri Filipchenko used the terms &quot;macroevolution&quot; and &quot;microevolution&quot; in 1927 in his German language work, &quot;Variabilität und Variation&quot;, that it attained its modern usage. The term was later brought into the English-speaking world by Filipchenko&#x27;s student Theodosius Dobzhansky in his book Genetics and the Origin of Species (1937).

===Use in creationism===
In young Earth creationism and baraminology a central tenet is that evolution can explain diversity in a limited number of created kinds which can interbreed (which they call &quot;microevolution&quot;) while the formation of new &quot;kinds&quot; (which they call &quot;macroevolution&quot;) is impossible. This acceptance of &quot;microevolution&quot; only within a &quot;kind&quot; is also typical of old Earth creationism.

Scientific organizations such as the American Association for the Advancement of Science describe microevolution as small scale change within species, and macroevolution as the formation of new species, but otherwise not being different from microevolution. In macroevolution, an accumulation of microevolutionary changes leads to speciation. The main difference between the two processes is that one occurs within a few generations, whilst the other takes place over thousands of years (i.e. a quantitative difference). Essentially they describe the same process; although evolution beyond the species level results in beginning and ending generations which could not interbreed, the intermediate generations could.

Opponents to creationism argue that changes in the number of chromosomes can be accounted for by intermediate stages in which a single chromosome divides in generational stages, or multiple chromosomes fuse, and cite the chromosome difference between humans and the other great apes as an example. Creationists insist that since the actual divergence between the other great apes and humans was not observed, the evidence is circumstantial.

Describing the fundamental similarity between macro and microevolution in his authoritative textbook &quot;Evolutionary Biology,&quot; biologist Douglas Futuyma writes,

Contrary to the claims of some antievolution proponents, evolution of life forms beyond the species level (i.e. speciation) has indeed been observed and documented by scientists on numerous occasions. In creation science, creationists accepted speciation as occurring within a &quot;created kind&quot; or &quot;baramin&quot;, but objected to what they called &quot;third level-macroevolution&quot; of a new genus or higher rank in taxonomy. There is ambiguity in the ideas as to where to draw a line on &quot;species&quot;, &quot;created kinds&quot;, and what events and lineages fall within the rubric of microevolution or macroevolution.

<text>MySQL () is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). Its name is a combination of &quot;My&quot;, the name of co-founder Michael Widenius&#x27;s daughter My, and &quot;SQL&quot;, the acronym for Structured Query Language. A relational database organizes data into one or more data tables in which data may be related to each other; these relations help structure the data. SQL is a language that programmers use to create, modify and extract data from the relational database, as well as control user access to the database. In addition to relational databases and SQL, an RDBMS like MySQL works with an operating system to implement a relational database in a computer&#x27;s storage system, manages users, allows for network access and facilitates testing database integrity and creation of backups.

MySQL is free and open-source software under the terms of the GNU General Public License, and is also available under a variety of proprietary licenses. MySQL was owned and sponsored by the Swedish company MySQL AB, which was bought by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle Corporation). In 2010, when Oracle acquired Sun, Widenius forked the open-source MySQL project to create MariaDB.

MySQL has stand-alone clients that allow users to interact directly with a MySQL database using SQL, but more often, MySQL is used with other programs to implement applications that need relational database capability. MySQL is a component of the LAMP web application software stack (and others), which is an acronym for &quot;Linux, Apache, MySQL, Perl/PHP/Python&quot;. MySQL is used by many database-driven web applications, including Drupal, Joomla, phpBB, and WordPress. MySQL is also used by many popular websites, including Facebook, Flickr, MediaWiki, Twitter, and YouTube.

==Overview==
MySQL is written in C and C++. Its SQL parser is written in yacc, but it uses a home-brewed lexical analyzer. MySQL works on many system platforms, including AIX, BSDi, FreeBSD, HP-UX, ArcaOS, eComStation, IBM i, IRIX, Linux, macOS, Microsoft Windows, NetBSD, Novell NetWare, OpenBSD, OpenSolaris, OS/2 Warp, QNX, Oracle Solaris, Symbian, SunOS, SCO OpenServer, SCO UnixWare, Sanos and Tru64. A port of MySQL to OpenVMS also exists.

The MySQL server software itself and the client libraries use dual-licensing distribution. They are offered under GPL version 2, or a proprietary license.

Support can be obtained from the official manual. Free support additionally is available in different IRC channels and forums. Oracle offers paid support via its MySQL Enterprise products. They differ in the scope of services and in price. Additionally, a number of third party organisations exist to provide support and services.

MySQL has received positive reviews, and reviewers noticed it &quot;performs extremely well in the average case&quot; and that the &quot;developer interfaces are there, and the documentation (not to mention feedback in the real world via Web sites and the like) is very, very good&quot;. It has also been tested to be a &quot;fast, stable and true multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server&quot;.

==History==

MySQL was created by a Swedish company, MySQL AB, founded by Swedes David Axmark and Allan Larsson, along with Finnish Michael &quot;Monty&quot; Widenius.
Original development of MySQL by Widenius and Axmark began in 1994. The first version of MySQL appeared on 23 May 1995. It was initially created for personal usage from mSQL based on the low-level language ISAM, which the creators considered too slow and inflexible. They created a new SQL interface, while keeping the same API as mSQL. By keeping the API consistent with the mSQL system, many developers were able to use MySQL instead of the (proprietarily licensed) mSQL antecedent.

===Milestones===
Additional milestones in MySQL development included:
* First internal release on 23 May 1995
* Version 3.19: End of 1996, from www.tcx.se
* Version 3.20: January 1997
* Windows version was released on 8 January 1998 for Windows 95 and NT
* Version 3.21: production release 1998, from www.mysql.com
* Version 3.22: alpha, beta from 1998
* Version 3.23: beta from June 2000, production release 22 January 2001
* Version 4.0: beta from August 2002, production release March 2003 (unions).
* Version 4.1: beta from June 2004, production release October 2004 (R-trees and B-trees, subqueries, prepared statements).
* Version 5.0: beta from March 2005, production release October 2005 (cursors, stored procedures, triggers, views, XA transactions).
** The developer of the Federated Storage Engine states that &quot;The Federated Storage Engine is a proof-of-concept storage engine&quot;, but the main distributions of MySQL version 5.0 included it and turned it on by default. Documentation of some of the short-comings appears in &quot;MySQL Federated Tables: The Missing Manual&quot;.
* Sun Microsystems acquired MySQL AB in 2008.
* Version 5.1: production release 27 November 2008 (event scheduler, partitioning, plugin API, row-based replication, server log tables)
** Version 5.1 contained 20 known crashing and wrong result bugs in addition to the 35 present in version 5.0 &quot;(almost all fixed as of release 5.1.51)&quot;.
** MySQL 5.1 and 6.0-alpha showed poor performance when used for data warehousing partly due to its inability to utilize multiple CPU cores for processing a single query.
* Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems on 27 January 2010.
* The day Oracle announced the purchase of Sun, Michael &quot;Monty&quot; Widenius forked MySQL, launching MariaDB, and took a swath of MySQL developers with him.

* MySQL Server 5.5 was generally available (). Enhancements and features include:
** The default storage engine is InnoDB, which supports transactions and referential integrity constraints.
** Improved InnoDB I/O subsystem
** Improved SMP support
** Semisynchronous replication.
** SIGNAL and RESIGNAL statement in compliance with the SQL standard.
** Support for supplementary Unicode character sets utf16, utf32, and utf8mb4.
** New options for user-defined partitioning.
* MySQL Server 6.0.11-alpha was announced on 22 May 2009 as the last release of the 6.0 line. Future MySQL Server development uses a New Release Model. Features developed for 6.0 are being incorporated into future releases.
* The general availability of MySQL 5.6 was announced in February 2013. New features included performance improvements to the query optimizer, higher transactional throughput in InnoDB, new NoSQL-style memcached APIs, improvements to partitioning for querying and managing very large tables, column type that correctly stores milliseconds, improvements to replication, and better performance monitoring by expanding the data available through the . The InnoDB storage engine also included support for full-text search and improved group commit performance.
* The general availability of MySQL 5.7 was announced in October 2015. As of MySQL 5.7.8, August 2015, MySQL supports a native JSON data type defined by RFC 7159.
* MySQL Server 8.0 was announced in April 2018, including NoSQL Document Store, atomic and crash safe DDL sentences and JSON Extended syntax, new functions, such as JSON table functions, improved sorting, and partial updates. Previous MySQL Server 8.0.0-dmr (Milestone Release) was announced 12 September 2016.
* MySQL was declared DBMS of the year 2019 from the DB-Engines ranking

=== Release history ===
Work on version 6 stopped after the Sun Microsystems acquisition. The MySQL Cluster product uses version 7. The decision was made to jump to version 8 as the next major version number.

===Legal disputes and acquisitions===
On 15 June 2001, NuSphere sued MySQL AB, TcX DataKonsult AB and its original authors Michael (&quot;Monty&quot;) Widenius and David Axmark in U.S. District Court in Boston for &quot;breach of contract, tortious interference with third party contracts and relationships and unfair competition&quot;.

In 2002, MySQL AB sued Progress NuSphere for copyright and trademark infringement in United States district court. NuSphere had allegedly violated MySQL AB&#x27;s copyright by linking MySQL&#x27;s GPL&#x27;ed code with NuSphere Gemini table without being in compliance with the license. After a preliminary hearing before Judge Patti Saris on 27 February 2002, the parties entered settlement talks and eventually settled. After the hearing, FSF commented that &quot;Judge Saris made clear that she sees the GNU GPL to be an enforceable and binding license.&quot;

In October 2005, Oracle Corporation acquired Innobase OY, the Finnish company that developed the third-party InnoDB storage engine that allows MySQL to provide such functionality as transactions and foreign keys. After the acquisition, an Oracle press release mentioned that the contracts that make the company&#x27;s software available to MySQL AB would be due for renewal (and presumably renegotiation) some time in 2006. During the MySQL Users Conference in April 2006, MySQL AB issued a press release that confirmed that MySQL AB and Innobase OY agreed to a &quot;multi-year&quot; extension of their licensing agreement.

In February 2006, Oracle Corporation acquired Sleepycat Software, makers of the Berkeley DB, a database engine providing the basis for another MySQL storage engine. This had little effect, as Berkeley DB was not widely used, and was dropped (due to lack of use) in MySQL 5.1.12, a pre-GA release of MySQL 5.1 released in October 2006.

In January 2008, Sun Microsystems bought MySQL AB for $1 billion.

In April 2009, Oracle Corporation entered into an agreement to purchase Sun Microsystems, then owners of MySQL copyright and trademark. Sun&#x27;s board of directors unanimously approved the deal. It was also approved by Sun&#x27;s shareholders, and by the U.S. government on 20 August 2009. On 14 December 2009, Oracle pledged to continue to enhance MySQL as it had done for the previous four years.

A movement against Oracle&#x27;s acquisition of MySQL AB, to &quot;Save MySQL&quot; from Oracle was started by one of the MySQL AB founders, Monty Widenius. The petition of 50,000+ developers and users called upon the European Commission to block approval of the acquisition. At the same time, some Free Software opinion leaders (including Pamela Jones of Groklaw, Jan Wildeboer and Carlo Piana, who also acted as co-counsel in the merger regulation procedure) advocated for the unconditional approval of the merger. As part of the negotiations with the European Commission, Oracle committed that MySQL server will continue until at least 2015 to use the dual-licensing strategy long used by MySQL AB, with proprietary and GPL versions available. The antitrust of the EU had been &quot;pressuring it to divest MySQL as a condition for approval of the merger&quot;. But the US Department of Justice, at the request of Oracle, pressured the EU to approve the merger unconditionally. The European Commission eventually unconditionally approved Oracle&#x27;s acquisition of MySQL AB on 21 January 2010.

In January 2010, before Oracle&#x27;s acquisition of MySQL AB, Monty Widenius started a GPL-only fork, MariaDB. MariaDB is based on the same code base as MySQL server 5.5 and aims to maintain compatibility with Oracle-provided versions.

==Features==
MySQL is offered under two different editions: the open source MySQL Community Server and the proprietary Enterprise Server. MySQL Enterprise Server is differentiated by a series of proprietary extensions which install as server plugins, but otherwise shares the version numbering system and is built from the same code base.

Major features as available in MySQL 5.6:
* A broad subset of , as well as extensions
* Cross-platform support
* Stored procedures, using a procedural language that closely adheres to SQL/PSM
* Triggers
* Cursors
* Updatable views
* Online Data Definition Language (DDL) when using the InnoDB Storage Engine.
* Information schema
* Performance Schema that collects and aggregates statistics about server execution and query performance for monitoring purposes.
* A set of SQL Mode options to control runtime behavior, including a strict mode to better adhere to SQL standards.
* X/Open XA distributed transaction processing (DTP) support; two phase commit as part of this, using the default InnoDB storage engine
* Transactions with savepoints when using the default InnoDB Storage Engine. The NDB Cluster Storage Engine also supports transactions.
* ACID compliance when using InnoDB and NDB Cluster Storage Engines
* SSL support
* Query caching
* Sub-SELECTs (i.e. nested SELECTs)
* Built-in replication support
** Asynchronous replication: master-slave from one master to many slaves or many masters to one slave
** Semi synchronous replication: Master to slave replication where the master waits on replication
** Synchronous replication: Multi-master replication is provided in MySQL Cluster.
** Virtual Synchronous: Self managed groups of MySQL servers with multi master support can be done using: Galera Cluster or the built in Group Replication plugin
* Full-text indexing and searching
* Embedded database library
* Unicode support
* Partitioned tables with pruning of partitions in optimizer
* Shared-nothing clustering through MySQL Cluster
* Multiple storage engines, allowing one to choose the one that is most effective for each table in the application.
* Native storage engines InnoDB, MyISAM, Merge, Memory (heap), Federated, Archive, CSV, Blackhole, NDB Cluster.
* Commit grouping, gathering multiple transactions from multiple connections together to increase the number of commits per second.

The developers release minor updates of the MySQL Server approximately every two months. The sources can be obtained from MySQL&#x27;s website or from MySQL&#x27;s GitHub repository, both under the GPL license.

===Limitations===
When using some storage engines other than the default of InnoDB, MySQL does not comply with the full SQL standard for some of the implemented functionality, including foreign key references. Check constraints are parsed but ignored by all storage engines before MySQL version 8.0.15.

Up until MySQL 5.7, triggers are limited to one per action / timing, meaning that at most one trigger can be defined to be executed after an operation, and one before on the same table.
No triggers can be defined on views.

Before MySQL 8.0.28, inbuilt functions like would return after 03:14:07 UTC on 19 January 2038. In 2017, an attempt to solve the problem was submitted, but was not used for the final solution that was shipped in 2022.

===Deployment===
MySQL can be built and installed manually from source code, but it is more commonly installed from a binary package unless special customizations are required. On most Linux distributions, the package management system can download and install MySQL with minimal effort, though further configuration is often required to adjust security and optimization settings.

Though MySQL began as a low-end alternative to more powerful proprietary databases, it has gradually evolved to support higher-scale needs as well. It is still most commonly used in small to medium scale single-server deployments, either as a component in a LAMP-based web application or as a standalone database server. Much of MySQL&#x27;s appeal originates in its relative simplicity and ease of use, which is enabled by an ecosystem of open source tools such as phpMyAdmin.
In the medium range, MySQL can be scaled by deploying it on more powerful hardware, such as a multi-processor server with gigabytes of memory.

There are, however, limits to how far performance can scale on a single server (&#x27;scaling up&#x27;), so on larger scales, multi-server MySQL (&#x27;scaling out&#x27;) deployments are required to provide improved performance and reliability. A typical high-end configuration can include a powerful master database which handles data write operations and is replicated to multiple slaves that handle all read operations. The master server continually pushes binlog events to connected slaves so in the event of failure a slave can be promoted to become the new master, minimizing downtime. Further improvements in performance can be achieved by caching the results from database queries in memory using memcached, or breaking down a database into smaller chunks called shards which can be spread across a number of distributed server clusters.

===High availability software===
Oracle MySQL offers a high availability solution with a mix of tools including the MySQL router and the MySQL shell. They are based on Group Replication, open source tools.

MariaDB offers a similar offer in terms of products.

===Cloud deployment===
MySQL can also be run on cloud computing platforms such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. Some common deployment models for MySQL on the cloud are:

; Virtual machine image
: In this implementation, cloud users can upload a machine image of their own with MySQL installed, or use a ready-made machine image with an optimized installation of MySQL on it, such as the one provided by Amazon EC2.

; MySQL as a service
: Some cloud platforms offer MySQL &quot;as a service&quot;. In this configuration, application owners do not have to install and maintain the MySQL database on their own. Instead, the database service provider takes responsibility for installing and maintaining the database, and application owners pay according to their usage. Notable cloud-based MySQL services are the Amazon Relational Database Service; Oracle MySQL HeatWave Database Service, Azure Database for MySQL, Rackspace; HP Converged Cloud; Heroku and Jelastic. In this model the database service provider takes responsibility for maintaining the host and database.

==User interfaces==
===Graphical user interfaces===
A graphical user interface (GUI) is a type of interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices or programs through graphical icons and visual indicators such as secondary notation, as opposed to text-based interfaces, typed command labels or text navigation.

Third-party proprietary and free graphical administration applications (or &quot;front ends&quot;) are available that integrate with MySQL and enable users to work with database structure and data visually.

====MySQL Workbench====

MySQL Workbench is the integrated environment for MySQL. It was developed by MySQL AB, and enables users to graphically administer MySQL databases and visually design database structures.

MySQL Workbench is available in three editions, the regular free and open source &quot;Community Edition&quot; which may be downloaded from the MySQL website, and the proprietary &quot;Standard Edition&quot; which extends and improves the feature set of the Community Edition, and the MySQL Cluster CGE.

====Other GUI tools====
* Adminer
* Database Workbench
* DBeaver
* DBEdit
* DbForge
* HeidiSQL
* LibreOffice Base
* Navicat
* OpenOffice.org Base
* phpMyAdmin
* SQLBuddy
* SQLyog
* Toad for MySQL
* Webmin

===Command-line interfaces===
A command-line interface is a means of interacting with a computer program where the user issues commands to the program by typing in successive lines of text (command lines). MySQL ships with many command line tools, from which the main interface is the client.

MySQL Utilities is a set of utilities designed to perform common maintenance and administrative tasks. Originally included as part of the MySQL Workbench, the utilities are a stand-alone download available from Oracle.

Percona Toolkit is a cross-platform toolkit for MySQL, developed in Perl. Percona Toolkit can be used to prove replication is working correctly, fix corrupted data, automate repetitive tasks, and speed up servers. Percona Toolkit is included with several Linux distributions such as CentOS and Debian, and packages are available for Fedora and Ubuntu as well. Percona Toolkit was originally developed as Maatkit, but as of late 2011, Maatkit is no longer developed.

MySQL shell is a tool for interactive use and administration of the MySQL database. It supports JavaScript, Python or SQL modes and it can be used for administration and access purposes.

==Application programming interfaces==
Many programming languages with language-specific APIs include libraries for accessing MySQL databases. These include MySQL Connector/Net for .NET/CLI Languages, and the JDBC driver for Java.

In addition, an ODBC interface called MySQL Connector/ODBC allows additional programming languages that support the ODBC interface to communicate with a MySQL database, such as ASP or ColdFusion. The HTSQL URL-based query method also ships with a MySQL adapter, allowing direct interaction between a MySQL database and any web client via structured URLs. Other drivers exists for languages like Python or Node.js.

==Project forks==
A variety of MySQL forks exist, including the following.

=== Current ===
; MariaDB
: MariaDB is a community-developed fork of the MySQL relational database management system intended to remain free under the GNU GPL. The fork has been led by the original developers of MySQL, who forked it due to concerns over its acquisition by Oracle.
; Percona Server for MySQL
: Percona Server for MySQL, forked by Percona, aims to retain close compatibility to the official MySQL releases. Also included in Percona Server for MySQL is XtraDB, Percona&#x27;s fork of the InnoDB Storage Engine.

=== Abandoned ===
; Drizzle
: Drizzle was a free software/open source relational database management system (DBMS) that was forked from the now-defunct 6.0 development branch of the MySQL DBMS. Like MySQL, Drizzle had a client/server architecture and uses SQL as its primary command language. Drizzle was distributed under version 2 and 3 of the GNU General Public License (GPL) with portions, including the protocol drivers and replication messaging under the BSD license.
; WebScaleSQL
: WebScaleSQL was a software branch of MySQL 5.6, and was announced on 27 March 2014 by Facebook, Google, LinkedIn and Twitter as a joint effort to provide a centralized development structure for extending MySQL with new features specific to its large-scale deployments, such as building large replicated databases running on server farms. Thus, WebScaleSQL opened a path toward deduplicating the efforts each company had been putting into maintaining its own branch of MySQL, and toward bringing together more developers. By combining the efforts of these companies and incorporating various changes and new features into MySQL, WebScaleSQL aimed at supporting the deployment of MySQL in large-scale environments. The project&#x27;s source code is licensed under version 2 of the GNU General Public License, and is hosted on GitHub.
; OurDelta
: The OurDelta distribution, created by the Australian company Open Query (later acquired by Catalyst IT Australia), had two versions: 5.0, which was based on MySQL, and 5.1, which was based on MariaDB. It included patches developed by Open Query and by other notable members of the MySQL community including Jeremy Cole and Google. Once the patches were incorporated into the MariaDB mainline, OurDelta&#x27;s objectives were achieved and OurDelta passed on its build and packaging toolchain to Monty Program (now MariaDB Plc).

<text>Modernism was an early 20th-century movement in literature, visual arts, and music that emphasized experimentation, abstraction, and subjective experience. Philosophy, politics, architecture, and social issues were all aspects of this movement. Modernism centered around beliefs in a &quot;growing alienation&quot; from prevailing &quot;morality, optimism, and convention&quot; and a desire to change how &quot;human beings in a society interact and live together&quot;.

The modernist movement emerged during the late 19th century in response to significant changes in Western culture, including secularization and the growing influence of science. It is characterized by a self-conscious rejection of tradition and the search for newer means of cultural expression. Modernism was influenced by widespread technological innovation, industrialization, and urbanization, as well as the cultural and geopolitical shifts that occurred after World War I. Artistic movements and techniques associated with modernism include abstract art, literary stream-of-consciousness, cinematic montage, musical atonality and twelve-tonality, modernist architecture, and urban planning.

Modernism took a critical stance towards the Enlightenment concept of rationalism. The movement also rejected the concept of absolute originality — the idea of &quot;Creatio ex nihilo&quot; creation out of nothing — upheld in the 19th century by both realism and Romanticism, replacing it with techniques of collage, reprise, incorporation, rewriting, recapitulation, revision, and parody. Another feature of modernism was reflexivity about artistic and social convention, which led to experimentation highlighting how works of art are made as well as the material from which they are created. Debate about the timeline of modernism continues, with some scholars arguing that it evolved into late modernism or high modernism. Postmodernism, meanwhile, rejects many of the principles of modernism.

== Overview and definition ==
Modernism was a cultural movement that impacted the arts as well as the broader &quot;Zeitgeist&quot;. It is commonly described as a system of thought and behavior marked by self-consciousness or self-reference, prevalent within the avant-garde of various arts and disciplines. It is also often perceived, especially in the West, as a socially progressive movement that affirms the power of human beings to create, improve, and reshape their environment with the aid of practical experimentation, scientific knowledge, or technology. From this perspective, modernism encourages the re-examination of every aspect of existence. Modernists analyze topics to find the ones they believe to be holding back progress, replacing them with new ways of reaching the same end.

According to historian Roger Griffin, modernism can be defined as a broad cultural, social, or political initiative sustained by the ethos of &quot;the temporality of the new&quot;. Griffin believed that modernism aspired to restore a &quot;sense of sublime order and purpose to the contemporary world, thereby counteracting the (perceived) erosion of an overarching &#x27;nomos&#x27;, or &#x27;sacred canopy&#x27;, under the fragmenting and secularizing impact of modernity&quot;. Therefore, phenomena apparently unrelated to each other such as &quot;Expressionism, Futurism, Vitalism, Theosophy, Psychoanalysis, Nudism, Eugenics, Utopian town planning and architecture, modern dance, Bolshevism, Organic Nationalism — and even the cult of self-sacrifice that sustained the Hecatomb of the First World War — disclose a common cause and psychological matrix in the fight against (perceived) decadence.&quot; All of them embody bids to access a &quot;supra-personal experience of reality&quot; in which individuals believed they could transcend their mortality and eventually that they would cease to be victims of history to instead become its creators.

== Modernism, Romanticism, Philosophy and Symbol ==
Literary modernism is often summed up in a line from W. B. Yeats: &quot;Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold&quot; (in &#x27;The Second Coming&#x27;). Modernists often search for a metaphysical &#x27;centre&#x27; but experience its collapse. (Postmodernism, by way of contrast, celebrates that collapse, exposing the failure of metaphysics, such as Jacques Derrida&#x27;s deconstruction of metaphysical claims.) 

Philosophically, the collapse of metaphysics can be traced back to the Scottish philosopher David Hume (1711–1776), who argued that we never actually perceive one event causing another. We only experience the &#x27;constant conjunction&#x27; of events, and do not perceive a metaphysical &#x27;cause&#x27;. Similarly, Hume argued that we never know the self as object, only the self as subject, and we are thus blind to our true natures. Moreover, if we only &#x27;know&#x27; through sensory experience—such as sight, touch and feeling—then we cannot &#x27;know&#x27; and neither can we make metaphysical claims. 

Thus, modernism can be driven emotionally by the desire for metaphysical truths, while understanding their impossibility. Some modernist novels, for instance, feature characters like Marlow in &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; or Nick Carraway in &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; who believe that they have encountered some great truth about nature or character, truths that the novels themselves treat ironically while offering more mundane explanations. Similarly, many poems of Wallace Stevens convey a struggle with the sense of nature&#x27;s significance, falling under two headings: poems in which the speaker denies that nature has meaning, only for nature to loom up by the end of the poem; and poems in which the speaker claims nature has meaning, only for that meaning to collapse by the end of the poem.

Modernism often rejects nineteenth century realism, &quot;if&quot; the latter is understood as focusing on the embodiment of meaning within a naturalistic representation. At the same time, some modernists aim at a more &#x27;real&#x27; realism, one that is uncentered. Picasso&#x27;s proto-cubist painting, Les Demoiselles d&#x27;Avignon of 1907 (see picture above), does not present its subjects from a single point of view (that of a single viewer), but instead presents a flat, two-dimensional picture plane. &#x27;The Poet&#x27; of 1911 is similarly decentred, presenting the body from multiple points of view. As the Peggy Guggenheim Collection website puts it, &#x27;Picasso presents multiple views of each object, as if he had moved around it, and synthesizes them into a single compound image&#x27;.

Modernism, with its sense that &#x27;things fall apart,&#x27; can be seen as the apotheosis of romanticism, if romanticism is the (often frustrated) quest for metaphysical truths about character, nature, a higher power and meaning in the world. Modernism often yearns for a romantic or metaphysical centre, but later finds its collapse.

This distinction between modernism and romanticism extends to their respective treatments of &#x27;symbol&#x27;. The romantics at times see an essential relation (the &#x27;ground&#x27;) between the symbol (or the &#x27;vehicle&#x27;, in I.A. Richards&#x27;s terms) and its &#x27;tenor&#x27; (its meaning)—for example in Coleridge&#x27;s description of nature as &#x27;that eternal language which thy God / Utters&#x27;. But while some romantics may have perceived nature and its symbols as God&#x27;s language, for other romantic theorists it remains inscrutable. As Goethe (not himself a romantic) said, ‘the idea [or meaning] remains eternally and infinitely active and inaccessible in the image’. This was extended in modernist theory which, drawing on its symbolist precursors, often emphasizes the inscrutability and failure of symbol and metaphor. For example, Wallace Stevens seeks and fails to find meaning in nature, even if he at times seems to sense such a meaning. As such, symbolists and modernists at times adopt a mystical approach to suggest a non-rational sense of meaning. 

For these reasons, modernist metaphors may be unnatural, as for instance in T.S. Eliot&#x27;s description of an evening &#x27;spread out against the sky / Like a patient etherized upon a table&#x27;. Similarly, for many later modernist poets nature is unnaturalized and at times mechanized, as for example in Stephen Oliver&#x27;s image of the moon busily &#x27;hoisting&#x27; itself into consciousness.

== Origins and early history ==

=== Romanticism and realism ===

Modernism developed out of Romanticism&#x27;s revolt against the effects of the Industrial Revolution and bourgeois values. Literary scholar Gerald Graff, argues that, &quot;The ground motive of modernism was criticism of the 19th-century bourgeois social order and its world view; the modernists, carrying the torch of Romanticism.&quot;
While J. M. W. Turner (1775–1851), one of the most notable landscape painters of the 19th century, was a member of the Romantic movement, his pioneering work in the study of light, color, and atmosphere &quot;anticipated the French Impressionists&quot; and therefore modernism &quot;in breaking down conventional formulas of representation; though unlike them, he believed that his works should always express significant historical, mythological, literary, or other narrative themes.&quot;
However, the modernists were critical of the Romantics&#x27; belief that art serves as a window into the nature of reality. They argued that since each viewer interprets art through their own subjective perspective, it can never convey the ultimate metaphysical truth that the Romantics sought. Nonetheless, the modernists did not completely reject the idea of art as a means of understanding the world. To them, it was a tool for challenging and disrupting the viewer&#x27;s point of view, rather than as a direct means of accessing a higher reality.

Modernism often rejects 19th-century realism when the latter is understood as focusing on the embodiment of meaning within a naturalistic representation. Instead, some modernists aim at a more &#x27;real&#x27; realism, one that is uncentered. For instance, Picasso&#x27;s 1907 Proto-Cubist painting &quot;Les Demoiselles d&#x27;Avignon&quot; does not present its subjects from a single point of view, instead presenting a flat, two-dimensional picture plane. &quot;The Poet&quot; of 1911 is similarly decentered, presenting the body from multiple points of view. As the Peggy Guggenheim Collection comments, &quot;Picasso presents multiple views of each object, as if he had moved around it, and synthesizes them into a single compound image.&quot;

Modernism, with its sense that &quot;things fall apart,&quot; is often seen as the apotheosis of Romanticism. As August Wilhelm Schlegel, an early German Romantic, described it, while Romanticism searches for metaphysical truths about character, nature, higher power, and meaning in the world, modernism, although yearning for such a metaphysical center, only finds its collapse.

=== The early 19th century ===
In the context of the Industrial Revolution (~1760–1840), influential innovations included steam-powered industrialization, especially the development of railways starting in Britain in the 1830s, and the subsequent advancements in physics, engineering, and architecture they led to. A major 19th-century engineering achievement was the Crystal Palace, the huge cast-iron and plate-glass exhibition hall built for the Great Exhibition of 1851 in London. Glass and iron were used in a similar monumental style in the construction of major railway terminals throughout the city, including King&#x27;s Cross station (1852) and Paddington Station (1854). These technological advances spread abroad, leading to later structures such as the Brooklyn Bridge (1883) and the Eiffel Tower (1889), the latter of which broke all previous limitations on how tall man-made objects could be. While such engineering feats radically altered the 19th-century urban environment and the daily lives of people, the human experience of time itself was altered with the development of the electric telegraph in 1837, as well as the adoption of &quot;standard time&quot; by British railway companies from 1845, a concept which would be adopted throughout the rest of the world over the next fifty years.

Despite continuing technological advances, the ideas that history and civilization were inherently progressive and that such advances were always good came under increasing attack in the 19th century. Arguments arose that the values of the artist and those of society were not merely different, but in fact oftentimes opposed, and that society&#x27;s current values were antithetical to further progress; therefore, civilization could not move forward in its present form. Early in the century, the philosopher Schopenhauer (1788–1860) (&quot;The World as Will and Representation&quot;, 1819/20) called into question previous optimism. His ideas had an important influence on later thinkers, including Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900). Similarly, Søren Kierkegaard (1813–1855) and Nietzsche both later rejected the idea that reality could be understood through a purely objective lens, a rejection that had a significant influence on the development of existentialism and nihilism.
Around 1850, the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood (a group of English poets, painters, and art critics) began to challenge the dominant trends of industrial Victorian England in &quot;opposition to technical skill without inspiration.&quot; They were influenced by the writings of the art critic John Ruskin (1819–1900), who had strong feelings about the role of art in helping to improve the lives of the urban working classes in the rapidly expanding industrial cities of Britain. Art critic Clement Greenberg described the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood as proto-modernists: &quot;There the proto-modernists were, of all people, the Pre-Raphaelites (and even before them, as proto-proto-modernists, the German Nazarenes). The Pre-Raphaelites foreshadowed Manet (1832–1883), with whom modernist painting most definitely begins. They acted on a dissatisfaction with painting as practiced in their time, holding that its realism wasn&#x27;t truthful enough.&quot;

Two of the most significant thinkers of the mid-19th century were biologist Charles Darwin (1809–1882), author of &quot;On the Origin of Species through Natural Selection&quot; (1859), and political scientist Karl Marx (1818–1883), author of &quot;Das Kapital&quot; (1867). Despite coming from different fields, both of their theories threatened the established order. Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution by natural selection undermined religious certainty and the idea of human uniqueness; in particular, the notion that human beings are driven by the same impulses as &quot;lower animals&quot; proved to be difficult to reconcile with the idea of an ennobling spirituality. Meanwhile, Marx&#x27;s arguments that there are fundamental contradictions within the capitalist system and that workers are anything but free led to the formulation of Marxist theory.

=== The late 19th century ===
Art historians have suggested various dates as starting points for modernism. Historian William Everdell argued that modernism began in the 1870s when metaphorical (or ontological) continuity began to yield to the discrete with mathematician Richard Dedekind&#x27;s (1831–1916) Dedekind cut and Ludwig Boltzmann&#x27;s (1844–1906) statistical thermodynamics. Everdell also believed modernism in painting began in 1885–1886 with post-Impressionist artist Georges Seurat&#x27;s development of Divisionism, the &quot;dots&quot; used to paint &quot;A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte&quot;. On the other hand, visual art critic Clement Greenberg called German philosopher Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) &quot;the first real modernist&quot;, although he also wrote, &quot;What can be safely called modernism emerged in the middle of the last century—and rather locally, in France, with Charles Baudelaire (1821–1867) in literature and Manet in painting, and perhaps with Gustave Flaubert (1821–1880), too, in prose fiction. (It was a while later, and not so locally, that modernism appeared in music and architecture).&quot; The poet Baudelaire&#x27;s &quot;Les Fleurs du mal&quot; (&quot;The Flowers of Evil&quot;) and the author Flaubert&#x27;s &quot;Madame Bovary&quot; were both published in 1857. Baudelaire&#x27;s essay &quot;The Painter of Modern Life&quot; (1863) inspired young artists to break away from tradition and innovate new ways of portraying their world in art.

Beginning in the 1860s, two approaches in the arts and letters developed separately in France. The first was Impressionism, a school of painting that initially focused on work done not in studios, but outdoors (&quot;en plein air&quot;). Impressionist paintings attempted to convey that human beings do not see objects, but instead see light itself. The school gathered adherents despite internal divisions among its leading practitioners and became increasingly influential. Initially rejected from the most important commercial show of the time, the government-sponsored Paris Salon, the Impressionists organized yearly group exhibitions in commercial venues during the 1870s and 1880s, timing them to coincide with the official Salon. In 1863, the Salon des Refusés, created by Emperor Napoleon III, displayed all of the paintings rejected by the Paris Salon. While most were in standard styles, but by inferior artists, the work of Manet attracted attention and opened commercial doors to the movement. The second French school was symbolism, which literary historians see beginning with Charles Baudelaire and including the later poets Arthur Rimbaud (1854–1891) with Une Saison en Enfer (&quot;A Season in Hell&quot;, 1873), Paul Verlaine (1844–1896), Stéphane Mallarmé (1842–1898), and Paul Valéry (1871–1945). The symbolists &quot;stressed the priority of suggestion and evocation over direct description and explicit analogy,&quot; and were especially interested in &quot;the musical properties of language.&quot;

Cabaret, which gave birth to so many of the arts of modernism, including the immediate precursors of film, may be said to have begun in France in 1881 with the opening of the Black Cat in Montmartre, the beginning of the ironic monologue, and the founding of the Society of Incoherent Arts.

The theories of Sigmund Freud (1856–1939), Krafft-Ebing and other sexologists were influential in the early days of modernism. Freud&#x27;s first major work was &quot;Studies on Hysteria&quot; (with Josef Breuer, 1895). Central to Freud&#x27;s thinking is the idea &quot;of the primacy of the unconscious mind in mental life&quot;, so that all subjective reality was based on the interactions between basic drives and instincts, through which the outside world was perceived. Freud&#x27;s description of subjective states involved an unconscious mind full of primal impulses, and counterbalancing self-imposed restrictions derived from social values.
The works of Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900) were another major precursor of modernism, with a philosophy in which psychological drives, specifically the &quot;will to power&quot; (&quot;Wille zur macht&quot;), were of central importance: &quot;Nietzsche often identified life itself with &#x27;will to power&#x27;, that is, with an instinct for growth and durability.&quot; Henri Bergson (1859–1941), on the other hand, emphasized the difference between scientific, clock time and the direct, subjective human experience of time. His work on time and consciousness &quot;had a great influence on 20th-century novelists&quot; especially those modernists who used the &quot;stream of consciousness&quot; technique, such as Dorothy Richardson, James Joyce, and Virginia Woolf (1882–1941). Also important in Bergson&#x27;s philosophy was the idea of &quot;élan vital&quot;, the life force, which &quot;brings about the creative evolution of everything.&quot; His philosophy also placed a high value on intuition, though without rejecting the importance of the intellect.

Important literary precursors of modernism included esteemed writers such as Fyodor Dostoevsky (1821–1881), whose novels include &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; (1866) and &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; (1880); Walt Whitman (1819–1892), who published the poetry collection &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; (1855–1891); and August Strindberg (1849–1912), especially his later plays, including the trilogy &quot;To Damascus&quot; 1898–1901,&quot;A Dream Play&quot; (1902) and &quot;The Ghost Sonata&quot; (1907). Henry James has also been suggested as a significant precursor to modernism in works as early as &quot;The Portrait of a Lady&quot; (1881).

== Modernism emerges ==

=== 1901 to 1930 ===


Out of the collision of ideals derived from Romanticism and an attempt to find a way for knowledge to explain that which was as yet unknown, came the first wave of modernist works in the opening decade of the 20th century. Although their authors considered them to be extensions of existing trends in art, these works broke the implicit understanding the general public had of art: that artists were the interpreters and representatives of bourgeois culture and ideas. These &quot;modernist&quot; landmarks include the atonal ending of Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s Second String Quartet in 1908, the Expressionist paintings of Wassily Kandinsky starting in 1903, and culminating with his first abstract painting and the founding of the Blue Rider group in Munich in 1911, and the rise of fauvism and the inventions of Cubism from the studios of Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, and others, in the years between 1900 and 1910.

An important aspect of modernism is how it relates to tradition through its adoption of techniques like reprise, incorporation, rewriting, recapitulation, revision, and parody in new forms. 

T. S. Eliot made significant comments on the relation of the artist to tradition, including: &quot;[W]e shall often find that not only the best, but the most individual parts of [a poet&#x27;s] work, may be those in which the dead poets, his ancestors, assert their immortality most vigorously.&quot; However, the relationship of modernism with tradition was complex, as literary scholar Peter Child&#x27;s indicates: &quot;There were paradoxical if not opposed trends towards revolutionary and reactionary positions, fear of the new and delight at the disappearance of the old, nihilism and fanatical enthusiasm, creativity, and despair.&quot;

An example of how modernist art can apply older traditions while also incorporating new techniques can be found within the music of the composer Arnold Schoenberg. On the one hand, he rejected traditional tonal harmony, the hierarchical system of organizing works of music that had guided musical composition for at least a century and a half. Schoenberg believed he had discovered a wholly new way of organizing sound based on the use of twelve-note rows. Yet, while this was indeed a wholly new technique, its origins can be traced back to the work of earlier composers such as Franz Liszt, Richard Wagner, Gustav Mahler, Richard Strauss, and Max Reger.

In the world of art, in the first decade of the 20th century, young painters such as Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse caused much controversy and attracted great criticism with their rejection of traditional perspective as the means of structuring paintings, though the Impressionist Claude Monet had already been innovative in his use of perspective. In 1907, as Picasso was painting , Oskar Kokoschka was writing &quot;Mörder, Hoffnung der Frauen&quot; (&quot;Murderer, Hope of Women&quot;), the first Expressionist play (produced with scandal in 1909), and Arnold Schoenberg was composing his String Quartet No.2 in F sharp minor (1908), his first composition without a tonal center.

A primary influence that led to Cubism was the representation of three-dimensional form in the late works of Paul Cézanne, which were displayed in a retrospective at the 1907 Salon d&#x27;Automne. In Cubist artwork, objects are analyzed, broken up, and reassembled in an abstract form; instead of depicting objects from one viewpoint, the artist depicts the subject from a multitude of viewpoints to represent the subject in a greater context. Cubism was brought to the attention of the general public for the first time in 1911 at the Salon des Indépendants in Paris (held 21 April – 13 June). Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Henri Le Fauconnier, Robert Delaunay, Fernand Léger and Roger de La Fresnaye were shown together in Room 41, provoking a &#x27;scandal&#x27; out of which Cubism emerged and spread throughout Paris and beyond. Also in 1911, Kandinsky painted &quot;Bild mit Kreis&quot; (&quot;Picture with a Circle&quot;), which he later called the first abstract painting. In 1912, Metzinger and Gleizes wrote the first (and only) major Cubist manifesto, &quot;Du &quot;Cubisme&quot;&quot;, published in time for the Salon de la Section d&#x27;Or, the largest Cubist exhibition to date. In 1912 Metzinger painted and exhibited his enchanting &quot;La Femme au Cheval (Woman with a Horse)&quot; and &quot;Danseuse au Café (Dancer in a Café)&quot;. Albert Gleizes painted and exhibited his &quot;Les Baigneuses&quot; (The Bathers) and his monumental &quot;Le Dépiquage des Moissons&quot; (Harvest Threshing). This work, along with &quot;La Ville de Paris&quot; (&quot;City of Paris&quot;) by Robert Delaunay, was the largest and most ambitious Cubist painting undertaken during the pre-war Cubist period.
In 1905, a group of four German artists, led by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, formed Die Brücke (The Bridge) in the city of Dresden. This was arguably the founding organization for the German Expressionist movement, though they did not use the word itself. A few years later, in 1911, a like-minded group of young artists formed Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider) in Munich. The name came from Wassily Kandinsky&#x27;s &quot;Der Blaue Reiter&quot; painting of 1903. Among their members were Kandinsky, Franz Marc, Paul Klee, and August Macke. However, the term &quot;Expressionism&quot; did not firmly establish itself until 1913. Though initially mainly a German artistic movement, most predominant in painting, poetry and the theatre between 1910 and 1930, most precursors of the movement were not German. Furthermore, there have been Expressionist writers of prose fiction, as well as non-German speaking Expressionist writers, and, while the movement had declined in Germany with the rise of Adolf Hitler in the 1930s, there were subsequent Expressionist works.
Expressionism is notoriously difficult to define, in part because it &quot;overlapped with other major &#x27;isms&#x27; of the modernist period: with Futurism, Vorticism, Cubism, Surrealism and Dada.&quot; Richard Murphy also comments: &quot;[The] search for an all-inclusive definition is problematic to the extent that the most challenging Expressionists,&quot; such as the novelist Franz Kafka, poet Gottfried Benn, and novelist Alfred Döblin were simultaneously the most vociferous anti-Expressionists. What, however, can be said, is that it was a movement that developed in the early 20th century mainly in Germany in reaction to the dehumanizing effect of industrialization and the growth of cities, and that &quot;one of the central means by which Expressionism identifies itself as an avant-garde movement, and by which it marks its distance to traditions and the cultural institution as a whole is through its relationship to realism and the dominant conventions of representation.&quot; More explicitly: the Expressionists rejected the ideology of realism.
There was a concentrated Expressionist movement in early 20th-century German theater, of which Georg Kaiser and Ernst Toller were the most famous playwrights. Other notable Expressionist dramatists included Reinhard Sorge, Walter Hasenclever, Hans Henny Jahnn, and Arnolt Bronnen. They looked back to Swedish playwright August Strindberg and German actor and dramatist Frank Wedekind as precursors of their dramaturgical experiments. Oskar Kokoschka&#x27;s &quot;Murderer, the Hope of Women&quot; was the first fully Expressionist work for the theater, which opened on 4 July 1909 in Vienna. The extreme simplification of characters to mythic types, choral effects, declamatory dialogue and heightened intensity would become characteristic of later Expressionist plays. The first full-length Expressionist play was &quot;The Son&quot; by Walter Hasenclever, which was published in 1914 and first performed in 1916.

Futurism is another modernist movement. In 1909, the Parisian newspaper &quot;Le Figaro&quot; published F. T. Marinetti&#x27;s first manifesto. Soon afterward, a group of painters (Giacomo Balla, Umberto Boccioni, Carlo Carrà, Luigi Russolo, and Gino Severini) co-signed the Futurist Manifesto. Modeled on Marx and Engels&#x27; famous &quot;Communist Manifesto&quot; (1848), such manifestos put forward ideas that were meant to provoke and to gather followers. However, arguments in favor of geometric or purely abstract painting were, at this time, largely confined to &quot;little magazines&quot; which had only tiny circulations. Modernist primitivism and pessimism were controversial, and the mainstream in the first decade of the 20th century was still inclined towards a faith in progress and liberal optimism.
Abstract artists, taking as their examples the Impressionists, as well as Paul Cézanne (1839–1906) and Edvard Munch (1863–1944), began with the assumption that color and shape, not the depiction of the natural world, formed the essential characteristics of art. Western art had been, from the Renaissance up to the middle of the 19th century, underpinned by the logic of perspective and an attempt to reproduce an illusion of visible reality. The arts of cultures other than the European had become accessible and showed alternative ways of describing visual experience to the artist. By the end of the 19th century, many artists felt a need to create a new kind of art that encompassed the fundamental changes taking place in technology, science and philosophy. The sources from which individual artists drew their theoretical arguments were diverse and reflected the social and intellectual preoccupations in all areas of Western culture at that time. Wassily Kandinsky, Piet Mondrian, and Kazimir Malevich all believed in redefining art as the arrangement of pure color. The use of photography, which had rendered much of the representational function of visual art obsolete, strongly affected this aspect of modernism.

Modernist architects and designers, such as Frank Lloyd Wright and Le Corbusier, believed that new technology rendered old styles of building obsolete. Le Corbusier thought that buildings should function as &quot;machines for living in&quot;, analogous to cars, which he saw as machines for traveling in. Just as cars had replaced the horse, so modernist design should reject the old styles and structures inherited from Ancient Greece or the Middle Ages. Following this machine aesthetic, modernist designers typically rejected decorative motifs in design, preferring to emphasize the materials used and pure geometrical forms. The skyscraper is the archetypal modernist building, and the Wainwright Building, a 10-story office building completed in 1891 in St. Louis, Missouri, United States, is among the first skyscrapers in the world. Ludwig Mies van der Rohe&#x27;s Seagram Building in New York (1956–1958) is often regarded as the pinnacle of this modernist high-rise architecture. Many aspects of modernist design persist within the mainstream of contemporary architecture, though previous dogmatism has given way to a more playful use of decoration, historical quotation, and spatial drama.
In 1913—which was the year of philosopher Edmund Husserl&#x27;s &quot;Ideas&quot;, physicist Niels Bohr&#x27;s quantized atom, Ezra Pound&#x27;s founding of imagism, the Armory Show in New York, and in Saint Petersburg the &quot;first futurist opera&quot;, Mikhail Matyushin&#x27;s &quot;Victory over the Sun&quot;—another Russian composer, Igor Stravinsky, composed &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot;, a ballet that depicts human sacrifice and has a musical score full of dissonance and primitive rhythm. This caused an uproar on its first performance in Paris. At this time, though modernism was still &quot;progressive&quot;, it increasingly saw traditional forms and social arrangements as hindering progress and recast the artist as a revolutionary, engaged in overthrowing rather than enlightening society. Also in 1913, a less violent event occurred in France with the publication of the first volume of Marcel Proust&#x27;s important novel sequence &quot;À la recherche du temps perdu&quot; (1913–1927) (&quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot;). This is often presented as an early example of a writer using the stream-of-consciousness technique, but Robert Humphrey comments that Proust &quot;is concerned only with the reminiscent aspect of consciousness&quot; and that he &quot;was deliberately recapturing the past for the purpose of communicating; hence he did not write a stream-of-consciousness novel.&quot;

Stream of consciousness was an important modernist literary innovation, and it has been suggested that Arthur Schnitzler (1862–1931) was the first to make full use of it in his short story &quot;Leutnant Gustl&quot; (&quot;None but the brave&quot;) (1900). Dorothy Richardson was the first English writer to use it, in the early volumes of her novel sequence &quot;Pilgrimage&quot; (1915–1967). Other modernist novelists that are associated with the use of this narrative technique include James Joyce in &quot;Ulysses&quot; (1922) and Italo Svevo in &quot;La coscienza di Zeno&quot; (1923).

However, with the coming of the Great War of 1914–1918 (World War I) and the Russian Revolution of 1917, the world was drastically changed, and doubt was cast on the beliefs and institutions of the past. The failure of the previous status quo seemed self-evident to a generation that had seen millions die fighting over scraps of earth: before 1914, it had been argued that no one would fight such a war, since the cost was too high. The birth of a machine age, which had made major changes in the conditions of daily life in the 19th century had now radically changed the nature of warfare. The traumatic nature of recent experience altered basic assumptions, and a realistic depiction of life in the arts seemed inadequate when faced with the fantastically surreal nature of trench warfare. The view that mankind was making steady moral progress now seemed ridiculous in the face of the senseless slaughter, described in works such as Erich Maria Remarque&#x27;s novel &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; (1929). Therefore, modernism&#x27;s view of reality, which had been a minority taste before the war, became more generally accepted in the 1920s.

In literature and visual art, some modernists sought to defy expectations mainly to make their art more vivid or to force the audience to take the trouble to question their own preconceptions. This aspect of modernism has often seemed a reaction to consumer culture, which developed in Europe and North America in the late 19th century. Whereas most manufacturers try to make products that will be marketable by appealing to preferences and prejudices, high modernists reject such consumerist attitudes to undermine conventional thinking. The art critic Clement Greenberg expounded this theory of modernism in his essay &quot;Avant-Garde and Kitsch&quot;. Greenberg labeled the products of consumer culture &quot;kitsch&quot;, because their design aimed simply to have maximum appeal, with any difficult features removed. For Greenberg, modernism thus formed a reaction against the development of such examples of modern consumer culture as commercial popular music, Hollywood, and advertising. Greenberg associated this with the revolutionary rejection of capitalism.

Some modernists saw themselves as part of a revolutionary culture that included political revolution. In Russia after the 1917 Revolution, there was indeed initially a burgeoning of avant-garde cultural activity, which included Russian Futurism. However, others rejected conventional politics as well as artistic conventions, believing that a revolution of political consciousness had greater importance than a change in political structures. But many modernists saw themselves as apolitical. Others, such as T. S. Eliot, rejected mass popular culture from a conservative position. Some even argue that Modernism in literature and art functioned to sustain an elite culture that excluded the majority of the population.

Surrealism, which originated in the early 1920s, came to be regarded by the public as the most extreme form of modernism, or &quot;the avant-garde of modernism&quot;. The word &quot;surrealist&quot; was coined by Guillaume Apollinaire and first appeared in the preface to his play &quot;Les Mamelles de Tirésias&quot;, which was written in 1903 and first performed in 1917. Major surrealists include Paul Éluard, Robert Desnos, Max Ernst, Hans Arp, Antonin Artaud, Raymond Queneau, Joan Miró, and Marcel Duchamp.

By 1930, modernism had won a place in the political and artistic establishment, although by this time modernism itself had changed.

=== Modernism continues: 1930–1945 ===
Modernism continued to evolve during the 1930s. Between 1930 and 1932 composer Arnold Schoenberg worked on &quot;Moses und Aron&quot;, one of the first operas to make use of the twelve-tone technique, Pablo Picasso painted in 1937 &quot;Guernica&quot;, his cubist condemnation of fascism, while in 1939 James Joyce pushed the boundaries of the modern novel further with &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;. Also by 1930 modernism began to influence mainstream culture, so that, for example, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine began publishing work, influenced by modernism, by young writers and humorists like Dorothy Parker, Robert Benchley, E. B. White, S. J. Perelman, and James Thurber, amongst others. Perelman is highly regarded for his humorous short stories that he published in magazines in the 1930s and 1940s, most often in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, which are considered to be the first examples of surrealist humor in America. Modern ideas in art also began to appear more frequently in commercials and logos, an early example of which, from 1916, is the famous London Underground logo designed by Edward Johnston.

One of the most visible changes of this period was the adoption of new technologies into the daily lives of ordinary people in Western Europe and North America. Electricity, the telephone, the radio, the automobile—and the need to work with them, repair them and live with them—created social change. The kind of disruptive moment that only a few knew in the 1880s became a common occurrence. For example, the speed of communication reserved for the stock brokers of 1890 became part of family life, at least in middle class North America. Associated with urbanization and changing social mores also came smaller families and changed relationships between parents and their children.
Another strong influence at this time was Marxism. After the generally primitivistic/irrationalism aspect of pre-World War I modernism (which for many modernists precluded any attachment to merely political solutions) and the neoclassicism of the 1920s (as represented most famously by T. S. Eliot and Igor Stravinsky—which rejected popular solutions to modern problems), the rise of fascism, the Great Depression, and the march to war helped to radicalize a generation. Bertolt Brecht, W. H. Auden, André Breton, Louis Aragon, and the philosophers Antonio Gramsci and Walter Benjamin are perhaps the most famous exemplars of this modernist form of Marxism. There were, however, also modernists explicitly of &#x27;the right&#x27;, including Salvador Dalí, Wyndham Lewis, T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, the Dutch author Menno ter Braak and others.

Significant modernist literary works continued to be created in the 1920s and 1930s, including further novels by Marcel Proust, Virginia Woolf, Robert Musil, and Dorothy Richardson. The American modernist dramatist Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s career began in 1914, but his major works appeared in the 1920s, 1930s and early 1940s. Two other significant modernist dramatists writing in the 1920s and 1930s were Bertolt Brecht and Federico García Lorca. D. H. Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot; was privately published in 1928, while another important landmark for the history of the modern novel came with the publication of William Faulkner&#x27;s &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot; in 1929. In the 1930s, in addition to further major works by Faulkner, Samuel Beckett published his first major work, the novel &quot;Murphy&quot; (1938). Then in 1939 James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; appeared. This is written in a largely idiosyncratic language, consisting of a mixture of standard English lexical items and neologistic multilingual puns and portmanteau words, which attempts to recreate the experience of sleep and dreams. In poetry T. S. Eliot, E. E. Cummings, and Wallace Stevens were writing from the 1920s until the 1950s. While modernist poetry in English is often viewed as an American phenomenon, with leading exponents including Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot, Marianne Moore, William Carlos Williams, H.D., and Louis Zukofsky, there were important British modernist poets, including David Jones, Hugh MacDiarmid, Basil Bunting, and W. H. Auden. European modernist poets include Federico García Lorca, Anna Akhmatova, Constantine Cavafy, and Paul Valéry.
The modernist movement continued during this period in Soviet Russia. In 1930 composer Dimitri Shostakovich&#x27;s (1906–1975) opera &quot;The Nose&quot; was premiered, in which he uses a montage of different styles, including folk music, popular song and atonality. Among his influences was Alban Berg&#x27;s (1885–1935) opera &quot;Wozzeck&quot; (1925), which &quot;had made a tremendous impression on Shostakovich when it was staged in Leningrad.&quot; However, from 1932 socialist realism began to oust modernism in the Soviet Union, and in 1936 Shostakovich was attacked and forced to withdraw his 4th Symphony. Alban Berg wrote another significant, though incomplete, modernist opera, &quot;Lulu&quot;, which premiered in 1937. Berg&#x27;s Violin Concerto was first performed in 1935. Like Shostakovich, other composers faced difficulties in this period.

In Germany Arnold Schoenberg (1874–1951) was forced to flee to the U.S. when Hitler came to power in 1933, because of his modernist atonal style as well as his Jewish ancestry. His major works from this period are a Violin Concerto, Op. 36 (1934/36), and a Piano Concerto, Op. 42 (1942). Schoenberg also wrote tonal music in this period with the Suite for Strings in G major (1935) and the Chamber Symphony No. 2 in E minor, Op. 38 (begun in 1906, completed in 1939). During this time Hungarian modernist Béla Bartók (1881–1945) produced a number of major works, including &quot;Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta&quot; (1936) and the &quot;Divertimento for String Orchestra&quot; (1939), String Quartet No. 5 (1934), and No. 6 (his last, 1939). But he too left for the US in 1940, because of the rise of fascism in Hungary. Igor Stravinsky (1882–1971) continued writing in his neoclassical style during the 1930s and 1940s, writing works like the &quot;Symphony of Psalms&quot; (1930), Symphony in C (1940), and &quot;Symphony in Three Movements&quot; (1945). He also emigrated to the US because of World War II. Olivier Messiaen (1908–1992), however, served in the French army during the war and was imprisoned at Stalag VIII-A by the Germans, where he composed his famous &quot;Quatuor pour la fin du temps&quot; (&quot;Quartet for the End of Time&quot;). The quartet was first performed in January 1941 to an audience of prisoners and prison guards.

In painting, during the 1920s and 1930s and the Great Depression, modernism was defined by Surrealism, late Cubism, Bauhaus, De Stijl, Dada, German Expressionism, and modernist and masterful color painters like Henri Matisse and Pierre Bonnard as well as the abstractions of artists like Piet Mondrian and Wassily Kandinsky which characterized the European art scene. In Germany, Max Beckmann, Otto Dix, George Grosz and others politicized their paintings, foreshadowing the coming of World War II, while in America, modernism is seen in the form of American Scene painting and the social realism and Regionalism movements that contained both political and social commentary dominated the art world. Artists like Ben Shahn, Thomas Hart Benton, Grant Wood, George Tooker, John Steuart Curry, Reginald Marsh, and others became prominent. Modernism is defined in Latin America by painters Joaquín Torres-García from Uruguay and Rufino Tamayo from Mexico, while the muralist movement with Diego Rivera, David Siqueiros, José Clemente Orozco, Pedro Nel Gómez and Santiago Martínez Delgado, and Symbolist paintings by Frida Kahlo, began a renaissance of the arts for the region, characterized by a freer use of color and an emphasis on political messages.

Diego Rivera is perhaps best known by the public world for his 1933 mural, &quot;Man at the Crossroads&quot;, in the lobby of the RCA Building at Rockefeller Center. When his patron Nelson Rockefeller discovered that the mural included a portrait of Vladimir Lenin and other communist imagery, he fired Rivera, and the unfinished work was eventually destroyed by Rockefeller&#x27;s staff. Frida Kahlo&#x27;s works are often characterized by their stark portrayals of pain. Kahlo was deeply influenced by indigenous Mexican culture, which is apparent in her paintings&#x27; bright colors and dramatic symbolism. Christian and Jewish themes are often depicted in her work as well; she combined elements of the classic religious Mexican tradition, which were often bloody and violent. Frida Kahlo&#x27;s Symbolist works relate strongly to surrealism and to the magic realism movement in literature.

Political activism was an important piece of David Siqueiros&#x27; life, and frequently inspired him to set aside his artistic career. His art was deeply rooted in the Mexican Revolution. The period from the 1920s to the 1950s is known as the Mexican Renaissance, and Siqueiros was active in the attempt to create an art that was at once Mexican and universal. The young Jackson Pollock attended the workshop and helped build floats for the parade.

During the 1930s, radical leftist politics characterized many of the artists connected to surrealism, including Pablo Picasso. On 26 April 1937, during the Spanish Civil War, the Basque town of Gernika was bombed by Nazi Germany&#x27;s Luftwaffe. The Germans were attacking to support the efforts of Francisco Franco to overthrow the Basque government and the Spanish Republican government. Pablo Picasso painted his mural-sized &quot;Guernica&quot; to commemorate the horrors of the bombing.

During the Great Depression of the 1930s and through the years of World War II, American art was characterized by social realism and American Scene painting, in the work of Grant Wood, Edward Hopper, Ben Shahn, Thomas Hart Benton, and several others. &quot;Nighthawks&quot; (1942) is a painting by Edward Hopper that portrays people sitting in a downtown diner late at night. It is not only Hopper&#x27;s most famous painting, but one of the most recognizable in American art. The scene was inspired by a diner in Greenwich Village. Hopper began painting it immediately after the attack on Pearl Harbor. After this event there was a large feeling of gloominess over the country, a feeling that is portrayed in the painting. The urban street is empty outside the diner, and inside none of the three patrons is apparently looking or talking to the others but instead is lost in their own thoughts. This portrayal of modern urban life as empty or lonely is a common theme throughout Hopper&#x27;s work.

&quot;American Gothic&quot; is a painting by Grant Wood from 1930 portraying a pitchfork-holding farmer and a younger woman in front of a house of Carpenter Gothic style, it is one of the most familiar images in 20th-century American art. Art critics had favorable opinions about the painting; like Gertrude Stein and Christopher Morley, they assumed the painting was meant to be a satire of rural small-town life. It was thus seen as part of the trend towards increasingly critical depictions of rural America, along the lines of Sherwood Anderson&#x27;s 1919 &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot;, Sinclair Lewis&#x27;s 1920 &quot;Main Street&quot;, and Carl Van Vechten&#x27;s &quot;The Tattooed Countess&quot; in literature. However, with the onset of the Great Depression, the painting came to be seen as a depiction of steadfast American pioneer spirit.

The situation for artists in Europe during the 1930s deteriorated rapidly as the Nazis&#x27; power in Germany and across Eastern Europe increased. &quot;Degenerate art&quot; was a term adopted by the Nazi regime in Germany for virtually all modern art. Such art was banned because it was un-German or Jewish Bolshevist in nature, and those identified as degenerate artists were subjected to sanctions. These included being dismissed from teaching positions, being forbidden to exhibit or to sell their art, and in some cases being forbidden to produce art entirely. Degenerate Art was also the title of an exhibition, mounted by the Nazis in Munich in 1937. The climate became so hostile for artists and art associated with modernism and abstraction that many left for the Americas. German artist Max Beckmann and scores of others fled Europe for New York. In New York City a new generation of young and exciting modernist painters led by Arshile Gorky, Willem de Kooning, and others were just beginning to come of age.

Arshile Gorky&#x27;s portrait of someone who might be Willem de Kooning is an example of the evolutionModernism&#x27;s stress on freedom of expression, experimentation, radicalism, and primitivism disregards conventional expectations. I of Abstract Expressionism from the context of figure painting, Cubism and Surrealism. Along with his friends de Kooning and John D. Graham, Gorky created bio morphically shaped and abstracted figurative compositions that by the 1940s evolved into totally abstract paintings. Gorky&#x27;s work seems to be a careful analysis of memory, emotion and shape, using line and color to express feeling and nature.

=== Attacks on early modernism ===
n many art forms this often meant startling and alienating audiences with bizarre and unpredictable effects, as in the strange and disturbing combinations of motifs in Surrealism or the use of extreme dissonance and atonality in modernist music. In literature this often involved the rejection of intelligible plots or characterization in novels, or the creation of poetry that defied clear interpretation. Within the Catholic Church, the specter of Protestantism and Martin Luther was at play in anxieties over modernism and the notion that doctrine develops and changes over time.

From 1932, socialist realism began to oust modernism in the Soviet Union, where it had previously endorsed Russian Futurism and Constructivism, primarily under the homegrown philosophy of Suprematism.

The Nazi government of Germany deemed modernism narcissistic and nonsensical, as well as &quot;Jewish&quot; (see Antisemitism) and &quot;Negro&quot;. The Nazis exhibited modernist paintings alongside works by the mentally ill in an exhibition entitled &quot;Degenerate Art&quot;. Accusations of &quot;formalism&quot; could lead to the end of a career, or worse. For this reason, many modernists of the post-war generation felt that they were the most important bulwark against totalitarianism, the &quot;canary in the coal mine&quot;, whose repression by a government or other group with supposed authority represented a warning that individual liberties were being threatened. Louis A. Sass compared madness, specifically schizophrenia, and modernism in a less fascist manner by noting their shared disjunctive narratives, surreal images, and incoherence.

== After 1945 ==
While &quot;The Oxford Encyclopedia of British Literature&quot; states that modernism ended by c. 1939 with regard to British and American literature, &quot;When (if) modernism petered out and postmodernism began has been contested almost as hotly as when the transition from Victorianism to modernism occurred.&quot; Clement Greenberg sees modernism ending in the 1930s, with the exception of the visual and performing arts, but with regard to music, Paul Griffiths notes that, while modernism &quot;seemed to be a spent force&quot; by the late 1920s, after World War II, &quot;a new generation of composers—Boulez, Barraqué, Babbitt, Nono, Stockhausen, Xenakis&quot; revived modernism&quot;. In fact, many literary modernists lived into the 1950s and 1960s, though generally they were no longer producing major works. The term &quot;late modernism&quot; is also sometimes applied to modernist works published after 1930. Among the modernists (or late modernists) still publishing after 1945 were Wallace Stevens, Gottfried Benn, T. S. Eliot, Anna Akhmatova, William Faulkner, Dorothy Richardson, John Cowper Powys, and Ezra Pound. Basil Bunting, born in 1901, published his most important modernist poem, &quot;Briggflatts&quot; in 1965. In addition, Hermann Broch&#x27;s &quot;The Death of Virgil&quot; was published in 1945 and Thomas Mann&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot; in 1947. Samuel Beckett, who died in 1989, has been described as a &quot;later modernist&quot;. Beckett is a writer with roots in the Expressionist tradition of modernism, who produced works from the 1930s until the 1980s, including &quot;Molloy&quot; (1951), &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; (1953), &quot;Happy Days&quot; (1961), and &quot;Rockaby&quot; (1981). The terms &quot;minimalist&quot; and &quot;post-modernist&quot; have also been applied to his later works. The poets Charles Olson (1910–1970) and J. H. Prynne (born 1936) are among the writers in the second half of the 20th century who have been described as late modernists.

More recently, the term &quot;late modernism&quot; has been redefined by at least one critic and used to refer to works written after 1945, rather than 1930. With this usage goes the idea that the ideology of modernism was significantly re-shaped by the events of World War II, especially the Holocaust and the dropping of the atom bomb.

The post-war period left the capitals of Europe in upheaval, with an urgency to economically and physically rebuild and to politically regroup. In Paris (the former center of European culture and the former capital of the art world), the climate for art was a disaster. Important collectors, dealers, and modernist artists, writers, and poets fled Europe for New York and America. The surrealists and modern artists from every cultural center of Europe had fled the onslaught of the Nazis for safe haven in the United States. Many of those who did not flee perished. A few artists, notably Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, and Pierre Bonnard, remained in France and survived.

The 1940s in New York City heralded the triumph of American Abstract Expressionism, a modernist movement that combined lessons learned from Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, Surrealism, Joan Miró, Cubism, Fauvism, and early modernism via great teachers in America like Hans Hofmann and John D. Graham. American artists benefited from the presence of Piet Mondrian, Fernand Léger, Max Ernst and the André Breton group, Pierre Matisse&#x27;s gallery, and Peggy Guggenheim&#x27;s gallery &quot;The Art of This Century&quot;, as well as other factors.

Paris, moreover, recaptured much of its luster in the 1950s and 1960s as the center of a machine art florescence, with both of the leading machine art sculptors Jean Tinguely and Nicolas Schöffer having moved there to launch their careers—and which florescence, in light of the technocentric character of modern life, may well have a particularly long-lasting influence.

=== Theatre of the Absurd ===

The term &quot;Theatre of the Absurd&quot; is applied to plays, written primarily by Europeans, that express the belief that human existence has no meaning or purpose and therefore all communication breaks down. Logical construction and argument gives way to irrational and illogical speech and to its ultimate conclusion, silence. While there are significant precursors, including Alfred Jarry (1873–1907), the Theatre of the Absurd is generally seen as beginning in the 1950s with the plays of Samuel Beckett.

Critic Martin Esslin coined the term in his 1960 essay &quot;Theatre of the Absurd&quot;. He related these plays based on a broad theme of the absurd, similar to the way Albert Camus uses the term in his 1942 essay, &quot;The Myth of Sisyphus&quot;. The Absurd in these plays takes the form of man&#x27;s reaction to a world apparently without meaning, and/or man as a puppet controlled or menaced by invisible outside forces. Though the term is applied to a wide range of plays, some characteristics coincide in many of the plays: broad comedy, often similar to vaudeville, mixed with horrific or tragic images; characters caught in hopeless situations forced to do repetitive or meaningless actions; dialogue full of clichés, wordplay, and nonsense; plots that are cyclical or absurdly expansive; either a parody or dismissal of realism and the concept of the &quot;well-made play&quot;.

Playwrights commonly associated with the Theatre of the Absurd include Samuel Beckett (1906–1989), Eugène Ionesco (1909–1994), Jean Genet (1910–1986), Harold Pinter (1930–2008), Tom Stoppard (born 1937), Alexander Vvedensky (1904–1941), Daniil Kharms (1905–1942), Friedrich Dürrenmatt (1921–1990), Alejandro Jodorowsky (born 1929), Fernando Arrabal (born 1932), Václav Havel (1936–2011) and Edward Albee (1928–2016).

=== Pollock and abstract influences ===
During the late 1940s, Jackson Pollock&#x27;s radical approach to painting revolutionized the potential for all contemporary art that followed him. To some extent, Pollock realized that the journey toward making a work of art was as important as the work of art itself. Like Pablo Picasso&#x27;s innovative reinventions of painting and sculpture in the early 20th century via Cubism and constructed sculpture, Pollock redefined the way art is made. His move away from easel painting and conventionality was a liberating signal to the artists of his era and to all who came after. Artists realized that Jackson Pollock&#x27;s process—placing unstretched raw canvas on the floor where it could be attacked from all four sides using artistic and industrial materials; dripping and throwing linear skeins of paint; drawing, staining, and brushing; using imagery and non-imagery—essentially blasted art-making beyond any prior boundary. Abstract Expressionism generally expanded and developed the definitions and possibilities available to artists for the creation of new works of art.

The other Abstract Expressionists followed Pollock&#x27;s breakthrough with new breakthroughs of their own. In a sense the innovations of Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline, Mark Rothko, Philip Guston, Hans Hofmann, Clyfford Still, Barnett Newman, Ad Reinhardt, Robert Motherwell, Peter Voulkos and others opened the floodgates to the diversity and scope of all the art that followed them. Re-readings into abstract art by art historians such as Linda Nochlin, Griselda Pollock and Catherine de Zegher critically show, however, that pioneering women artists who produced major innovations in modern art had been ignored by official accounts of its history.

=== International figures from British art ===
Henry Moore (1898–1986) emerged after World War II as Britain&#x27;s leading sculptor. He was best known for his semi-abstract monumental bronze sculptures which are located around the world as public works of art. His forms are usually abstractions of the human figure, typically depicting mother-and-child or reclining figures, usually suggestive of the female body, apart from a phase in the 1950s when he sculpted family groups. These sculptures are generally pierced or contain hollow spaces.
In the 1950s, Moore began to receive increasingly significant commissions, including a reclining figure for the UNESCO building in Paris in 1958. With many more public works of art, the scale of Moore&#x27;s sculptures grew significantly. The last three decades of Moore&#x27;s life continued in a similar vein, with several major retrospectives taking place around the world, notably a prominent exhibition in the summer of 1972 in the grounds of the Forte di Belvedere overlooking Florence. By the end of the 1970s, there were some 40 exhibitions a year featuring his work. On the campus of the University of Chicago in December 1967, 25 years to the minute after the team of physicists led by Enrico Fermi achieved the first controlled, self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction, Moore&#x27;s &quot;Nuclear Energy&quot; was unveiled. Also in Chicago, Moore commemorated science with a large bronze sundial, locally named &quot;Man Enters the Cosmos&quot; (1980), which was commissioned to recognize the space exploration program.

The &quot;London School&quot; of figurative painters, including Francis Bacon (1909–1992), Lucian Freud (1922–2011), Frank Auerbach (born 1931), Leon Kossoff (born 1926), and Michael Andrews (1928–1995), have received widespread international recognition.

Francis Bacon was an Irish-born British figurative painter known for his bold, graphic and emotionally raw imagery. His painterly but abstracted figures typically appear isolated in glass or steel geometrical cages set against flat, nondescript backgrounds. Bacon began painting during his early 20s but worked only sporadically until his mid-30s. His breakthrough came with the 1944 triptych &quot;Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion&quot; which sealed his reputation as a uniquely bleak chronicler of the human condition. His output can be crudely described as consisting of sequences or variations on a single motif; beginning with the 1940s male heads isolated in rooms, the early 1950s screaming popes, and mid to late 1950s animals and lone figures suspended in geometric structures. These were followed by his early 1960s modern variations of the crucifixion in the triptych format. From the mid-1960s to early 1970s, Bacon mainly produced strikingly compassionate portraits of friends. Following the suicide of his lover George Dyer in 1971, his art became more personal, inward-looking, and preoccupied with themes and motifs of death. During his lifetime, Bacon was equally reviled and acclaimed.

Lucian Freud was a German-born British painter, known chiefly for his thickly impastoed portrait and figure paintings, who was widely considered the pre-eminent British artist of his time. His works are noted for their psychological penetration, and for their often discomforting examination of the relationship between artist and model. According to William Grimes of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Lucien Freud and his contemporaries transformed figure painting in the 20th century. In paintings like &quot;Girl with a White Dog&quot; (1951–1952), Freud put the pictorial language of traditional European painting in the service of an anti-romantic, confrontational style of portraiture that stripped bare the sitter&#x27;s social facade. Ordinary people—many of them his friends—stared wide-eyed from the canvas, vulnerable to the artist&#x27;s ruthless inspection.&quot;

=== After Abstract Expressionism ===

In abstract painting during the 1950s and 1960s, several new directions like hard-edge painting and other forms of geometric abstraction began to appear in artist studios and in radical avant-garde circles as a reaction against the subjectivism of Abstract Expressionism. Clement Greenberg became the voice of post-painterly abstraction when he curated an influential exhibition of new painting that toured important art museums throughout the United States in 1964. Color field painting, hard-edge painting, and lyrical abstraction emerged as radical new directions.

By the late 1960s however, postminimalism, process art and Arte Povera also emerged as revolutionary concepts and movements that encompassed both painting and sculpture, via lyrical abstraction and the post-minimalist movement, and in early conceptual art. Process art, as inspired by Pollock enabled artists to experiment with and make use of a diverse encyclopaedia of style, content, material, placement, sense of time, aplastic, and real space. Nancy Graves, Ronald Davis, Howard Hodgkin, Larry Poons, Jannis Kounellis, Brice Marden, Colin McCahon, Bruce Nauman, Richard Tuttle, Alan Saret, Walter Darby Bannard, Lynda Benglis, Dan Christensen, Larry Zox, Ronnie Landfield, Eva Hesse, Keith Sonnier, Richard Serra, Pat Lipsky, Sam Gilliam, Mario Merz and Peter Reginato were some of the younger artists who emerged during the era of late modernism that spawned the heyday of the art of the late 1960s.

=== Pop art ===
In 1962, the Sidney Janis Gallery mounted &quot;The New Realists&quot;, the first major pop art group exhibition in an uptown art gallery in New York City. Janis mounted the exhibition in a 57th Street storefront near his gallery. The show had a great impact on the New York School as well as the greater worldwide art scene. Earlier in England in 1958 the term &quot;Pop Art&quot; was used by Lawrence Alloway to describe paintings associated with the consumerism of the post World War II era. This movement rejected Abstract Expressionism and its focus on the hermeneutic and psychological interior in favor of art that depicted material consumer culture, advertising, and the iconography of the mass production age. The early works of David Hockney and the works of Richard Hamilton and Eduardo Paolozzi (who created the ground-breaking &quot;I was a Rich Man&#x27;s Plaything&quot;, 1947) are considered seminal examples in the movement. Meanwhile, in the downtown scene in New York&#x27;s East Village 10th Street galleries, artists were formulating an American version of pop art. Claes Oldenburg had his storefront, and the Green Gallery on 57th Street began to show the works of Tom Wesselmann and James Rosenquist. Later Leo Castelli exhibited the works of other American artists, including those of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein for most of their careers. There is a connection between the radical works of Marcel Duchamp and Man Ray, the rebellious Dadaists with a sense of humor, and pop artists like Claes Oldenburg, Andy Warhol, and Roy Lichtenstein, whose paintings reproduce the look of Ben-Day dots, a technique used in commercial reproduction.

=== Minimalism ===

Minimalism describes movements in various forms of art and design, especially visual art and music, wherein artists intend to expose the essence or identity of a subject through eliminating all nonessential forms, features, or concepts. Minimalism is any design or style wherein the simplest and fewest elements are used to create the maximum effect.

As a specific movement in the arts, it is identified with developments in post–World War II Western art, most strongly with American visual arts in the 1960s and early 1970s. Prominent artists associated with this movement include Donald Judd, John McCracken, Agnes Martin, Dan Flavin, Robert Morris, Ronald Bladen, Anne Truitt, and Frank Stella. It derives from the reductive aspects of modernism and is often interpreted as a reaction against Abstract Expressionism and a bridge to Post minimal art practices. By the early 1960s, minimalism emerged as an abstract movement in art (with roots in the geometric abstraction of Kazimir Malevich, the Bauhaus and Piet Mondrian) that rejected the idea of relational and subjective painting, the complexity of Abstract Expressionist surfaces, and the emotional zeitgeist and polemics present in the arena of action painting. Minimalism argued that extreme simplicity could capture all of the sublime representation needed in art. Minimalism is variously construed either as a precursor to postmodernism, or as a postmodern movement itself. In the latter perspective, early Minimalism yielded advanced modernist works, but the movement partially abandoned this direction when some artists like Robert Morris changed direction in favor of the anti-form movement.

Hal Foster, in his essay &quot;The Crux of Minimalism&quot;, examines the extent to which Donald Judd and Robert Morris both acknowledge and exceed Greenbergian modernism in their published definitions of minimalism. He argues that minimalism is not a &quot;dead end&quot; of modernism, but a &quot;paradigm shift toward postmodern practices that continue to be elaborated today.&quot;

====Minimal music====
The terms have expanded to encompass a movement in music that features such repetition and iteration as those of the compositions of La Monte Young, Terry Riley, Steve Reich, Philip Glass, and John Adams. Minimalist compositions are sometimes known as systems music. The term &#x27;minimal music&#x27; is generally used to describe a style of music that developed in America in the late 1960s and 1970s; and that was initially connected with the composers. The minimalism movement originally involved some composers, and other lesser known pioneers included Pauline Oliveros, Phill Niblock, and Richard Maxfield. In Europe, the music of Louis Andriessen, Karel Goeyvaerts, Michael Nyman, Howard Skempton, Eliane Radigue, Gavin Bryars, Steve Martland, Henryk Górecki, Arvo Pärt and John Tavener.

==== Postminimalism ====

In the late 1960s, Robert Pincus-Witten coined the term &quot;postminimalism&quot; to describe minimalist-derived art which had content and contextual overtones that minimalism rejected. The term was applied by Pincus-Witten to the work of Eva Hesse, Keith Sonnier, Richard Serra and new work by former minimalists Robert Smithson, Robert Morris, Sol LeWitt, Barry Le Va, and others. Other minimalists, including Donald Judd, Dan Flavin, Carl Andre, Agnes Martin, John McCracken and others, continued to produce late modernist paintings and sculpture for the remainder of their careers.

Since then, many artists have embraced minimal or post-minimal styles, and the label &quot;postmodern&quot; has been attached to them.

====Collage, assemblage, installations====

Related to Abstract Expressionism was the emergence of combining manufactured items with artist materials, moving away from previous conventions of painting and sculpture. The work of Robert Rauschenberg exemplifies this trend. His &quot;combines&quot; of the 1950s were forerunners of pop art and installation art, and used assemblages of large physical objects, including stuffed animals, birds and commercial photographs. Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, Larry Rivers, John Chamberlain, Claes Oldenburg, George Segal, Jim Dine, and Edward Kienholz were among important pioneers of both abstraction and pop art. Creating new conventions of art-making, they made acceptable in serious contemporary art circles the radical inclusion in their works of unlikely materials. Another pioneer of collage was Joseph Cornell, whose more intimately scaled works were seen as radical because of both his personal iconography and his use of found objects.

==== Neo-Dada ====
In 1917, Marcel Duchamp submitted a urinal as a sculpture for the inaugural exhibition of the Society of Independent Artists, which was to be staged at the Grand Central Palace in New York. He professed his intent that people look at the urinal as if it were a work of art because he said it was a work of art. This urinal, named &quot;Fountain&quot; was signed with the pseudonym &quot;R. Mutt&quot;. It is also an example of what Duchamp would later call &quot;readymades&quot;. This and Duchamp&#x27;s other works are generally labelled as Dada. Duchamp can be seen as a precursor to conceptual art, other famous examples being John Cage&#x27;s &quot;4′33″&quot;, which is four minutes and thirty three seconds of silence, and Rauschenberg&#x27;s &quot;Erased de Kooning Drawing&quot;. Many conceptual works take the position that art is the result of the viewer viewing an object or act as art, not of the intrinsic qualities of the work itself. In choosing &quot;an ordinary article of life&quot; and creating &quot;a new thought for that object&quot;, Duchamp invited onlookers to view &quot;Fountain&quot; as a sculpture.

Marcel Duchamp famously gave up &quot;art&quot; in favor of chess. Avant-garde composer David Tudor created a piece, &quot;Reunion&quot; (1968), written jointly with Lowell Cross, that features a chess game in which each move triggers a lighting effect or projection. Duchamp and Cage played the game at the work&#x27;s premier.

Steven Best and Douglas Kellner identify Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns as part of the transitional phase, influenced by Duchamp, between modernism and postmodernism. Both used images of ordinary objects, or the objects themselves, in their work, while retaining the abstraction and painterly gestures of high modernism.

==== Performance and happenings ====

During the late 1950s and 1960s artists with a wide range of interests began to push the boundaries of contemporary art. Yves Klein in France, Carolee Schneemann, Yayoi Kusama, Charlotte Moorman and Yoko Ono in New York City, and Joseph Beuys, Wolf Vostell and Nam June Paik in Germany were pioneers of performance-based works of art. Groups like The Living Theatre with Julian Beck and Judith Malina collaborated with sculptors and painters to create environments, radically changing the relationship between audience and performer, especially in their piece &quot;Paradise Now&quot;. The Judson Dance Theater, located at the Judson Memorial Church, New York; and the Judson dancers, notably Yvonne Rainer, Trisha Brown, Elaine Summers, Sally Gross, Simonne Forti, Deborah Hay, Lucinda Childs, Steve Paxton and others; collaborated with artists Robert Morris, Robert Whitman, John Cage, Robert Rauschenberg, and engineers like Billy Klüver. Park Place Gallery was a center for musical performances by electronic composers Steve Reich, Philip Glass, and other notable performance artists, including Joan Jonas.

These performances were intended as works of a new art form combining sculpture, dance, and music or sound, often with audience participation. They were characterized by the reductive philosophies of Minimalism and the spontaneous improvisation and expressivity of Abstract Expressionism. Images of Schneemann&#x27;s performances of pieces meant to create shock within the audience are occasionally used to illustrate these kinds of art, and she is often photographed while performing her piece &quot;Interior Scroll&quot;. However, according to modernist philosophy surrounding performance art, it is cross-purposes to publish images of her performing this piece, for performance artists reject publication entirely: the performance itself is the medium. Thus, other media cannot illustrate performance art; performance is momentary, evanescent, and personal, not for capturing; representations of performance art in other media, whether by image, video, narrative or, otherwise, select certain points of view in space or time or otherwise involve the inherent limitations of each medium. The artists deny that recordings illustrate the medium of performance as art.

During the same period, various avant-garde artists created Happenings, mysterious and often spontaneous and unscripted gatherings of artists and their friends and relatives in various specified locations, often incorporating exercises in absurdity, physicality, costuming, spontaneous nudity, and various random or seemingly disconnected acts. Notable creators of happenings included Allan Kaprow—who first used the term in 1958, Claes Oldenburg, Jim Dine, Red Grooms, and Robert Whitman.

==== Intermedia, multi-media ====
Another trend in art which has been associated with the term postmodern is the use of a number of different media together. Intermedia is a term coined by Dick Higgins and meant to convey new art forms along the lines of Fluxus, concrete poetry, found objects, performance art, and computer art. Higgins was the publisher of the Something Else Press, a concrete poet married to artist Alison Knowles and an admirer of Marcel Duchamp. Ihab Hassan includes &quot;Intermedia, the fusion of forms, the confusion of realms,&quot; in his list of the characteristics of postmodern art. One of the most common forms of &quot;multi-media art&quot; is the use of video-tape and CRT monitors, termed video art. While the theory of combining multiple arts into one art is quite old, and has been revived periodically, the postmodern manifestation is often in combination with performance art, where the dramatic subtext is removed, and what is left is the specific statements of the artist in question or the conceptual statement of their action.

==== Fluxus ====
Fluxus was named and loosely organized in 1962 by George Maciunas (1931–1978), a Lithuanian-born American artist. Fluxus traces its beginnings to John Cage&#x27;s 1957 to 1959 Experimental Composition classes at The New School for Social Research in New York City. Many of his students were artists working in other media with little or no background in music. Cage&#x27;s students included Fluxus founding members Jackson Mac Low, Al Hansen, George Brecht and Dick Higgins.

Fluxus encouraged a do-it-yourself aesthetic and valued simplicity over complexity. Like Dada before it, Fluxus included a strong current of anti-commercialism and an anti-art sensibility, disparaging the conventional market-driven art world in favor of an artist-centered creative practice. Fluxus artists preferred to work with whatever materials were at hand, and either created their own work or collaborated in the creation process with their colleagues.

Andreas Huyssen criticizes attempts to claim Fluxus for postmodernism as &quot;either the master-code of postmodernism or the ultimately unrepresentable art movement—as it were, postmodernism&#x27;s sublime.&quot; Instead he sees Fluxus as a major Neo-Dadaist phenomenon within the avant-garde tradition. It did not represent a major advance in the development of artistic strategies, though it did express a rebellion against &quot;the administered culture of the 1950s, in which a moderate, domesticated modernism served as ideological prop to the Cold War.&quot;

=== Avant-garde popular music ===

Modernism had an uneasy relationship with popular forms of music (both in form and aesthetic) while rejecting popular culture. Despite this, Stravinsky used jazz idioms on his pieces like &quot;Ragtime&quot; from his 1918 theatrical work &quot;Histoire du Soldat&quot; and 1945&#x27;s &quot;Ebony Concerto&quot;.

In the 1960s, as popular music began to gain cultural importance and question its status as commercial entertainment, musicians began to look to the post-war avant-garde for inspiration. In 1959, music producer Joe Meek recorded &quot;I Hear a New World&quot; (1960), which &quot;Tiny Mix Tapes&quot;″ Jonathan Patrick calls a &quot;seminal moment in both electronic music and avant-pop history [...] a collection of dreamy pop vignettes, adorned with dubby echoes and tape-warped sonic tendrils&quot; which would be largely ignored at the time. Other early Avant-pop productions included the Beatles&#x27;s 1966 song &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;, which incorporated techniques from musique concrète, avant-garde composition, Indian music, and electro-acoustic sound manipulation into a 3-minute pop format, and the Velvet Underground&#x27;s integration of La Monte Young&#x27;s minimalist and drone music ideas, beat poetry, and 1960s pop art.

=== Late period ===
The continuation of Abstract Expressionism, color field painting, lyrical abstraction, geometric abstraction, minimalism, abstract illusionism, process art, pop art, postminimalism, and other late 20th-century modernist movements in both painting and sculpture continued through the first decade of the 21st century and constitute radical new directions in those mediums.

At the turn of the 21st century, well-established artists such as Sir Anthony Caro, Lucian Freud, Cy Twombly, Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, Agnes Martin, Al Held, Ellsworth Kelly, Helen Frankenthaler, Frank Stella, Kenneth Noland, Jules Olitski, Claes Oldenburg, Jim Dine, James Rosenquist, Alex Katz, Philip Pearlstein, and younger artists including Brice Marden, Chuck Close, Sam Gilliam, Isaac Witkin, Sean Scully, Mahirwan Mamtani, Joseph Nechvatal, Elizabeth Murray, Larry Poons, Richard Serra, Walter Darby Bannard, Larry Zox, Ronnie Landfield, Ronald Davis, Dan Christensen, Pat Lipsky, Joel Shapiro, Tom Otterness, Joan Snyder, Ross Bleckner, Archie Rand, Susan Crile, and others continued to produce vital and influential paintings and sculpture.

==== Modern architecture ====
Many skyscrapers in Hong Kong and Frankfurt have been inspired by Le Corbusier and modernist architecture, and his style is still used as influence for buildings worldwide.

== Modernism in Asia ==
The terms &quot;modernism&quot; and &quot;modernist&quot;, according to scholar William J. Tyler, &quot;have only recently become part of the standard discourse in English on modern Japanese literature and doubts concerning their authenticity vis-à-vis Western European modernism remain&quot;. Tyler finds this odd, given &quot;the decidedly modern prose&quot; of such &quot;well-known Japanese writers as Kawabata Yasunari, Nagai Kafu, and Jun&#x27;ichirō Tanizaki&quot;. However, &quot;scholars in the visual and fine arts, architecture, and poetry readily embraced &quot;modanizumu&quot; as a key concept for describing and analysing Japanese culture in the 1920s and 1930s&quot;. In 1924, various young Japanese writers, including Kawabata and Riichi Yokomitsu started a literary journal &quot;Bungei Jidai&quot; (&quot;The Artistic Age&quot;). This journal was &quot;part of an &#x27;art for art&#x27;s sake&#x27; movement, influenced by European Cubism, Expressionism, Dada, and other modernist styles&quot;.

Japanese modernist architect Kenzō Tange (1913–2005) was one of the most significant architects of the 20th century, combining traditional Japanese styles with modernism, and designing major buildings on five continents. Tange was also an influential patron of the Metabolist movement. He said: &quot;It was, I believe, around 1959 or at the beginning of the sixties that I began to think about what I was later to call structuralism&quot;, He was influenced from an early age by the Swiss modernist, Le Corbusier, Tange gained international recognition in 1949 when he won the competition for the design of Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park.

In China, the &quot;New Sensationists&quot; (新感觉派, Xīn Gǎnjué Pài) were a group of writers based in Shanghai who in the 1930s and 1940s, were influenced, to varying degrees, by Western and Japanese modernism. They wrote fiction that was more concerned with the unconscious and with aesthetics than with politics or social problems. Among these writers were Mu Shiying and Shi Zhecun.

In India, the Progressive Artists&#x27; Group was a group of modern artists, mainly based in Mumbai, India formed in 1947. Though it lacked any particular style, it synthesized Indian art with European and North America influences from the first half of the 20th century, including Post-Impressionism, Cubism and Expressionism.

== Modernism in Africa ==
Peter Kalliney suggests that &quot;Modernist concepts, especially aesthetic autonomy, were fundamental to the literature of decolonization in anglophone Africa.&quot; In his opinion, Rajat Neogy, Christopher Okigbo, and Wole Soyinka, were among the writers who &quot;repurposed modernist versions of aesthetic autonomy to declare their freedom from colonial bondage, from systems of racial discrimination, and even from the new postcolonial state&quot;.

== Relationship with postmodernism ==
By the early 1980s, the postmodern movement in art and architecture began to establish its position through various and intermedia formats. Postmodernism in music and literature began to take hold earlier. In music, postmodernism is described in one reference work as a &quot;term introduced in the 1970s&quot;, while in British literature, &quot;The Oxford Encyclopaedia of British Literature&quot; sees modernism &quot;ceding its predominance to postmodernism&quot; as early as 1939. However, dates are highly debatable, especially as, according to Andreas Huyssen: &quot;one critic&#x27;s postmodernism is another critic&#x27;s modernism.&quot; This includes those who are critical of the division between the two, see them as two aspects of the same movement, and believe that late modernism continues.

Modernism is an all-encompassing label for a wide variety of cultural movements. Postmodernism is essentially a centralized movement that named itself, based on socio-political theory, although the term is now used in a wider sense to refer to activities from the 20th century onwards which exhibit awareness of and reinterpret the modern.

Postmodern theory asserts that the attempt to canonize modernism &quot;after the fact&quot; is doomed to unresolvable contradictions. And since the crux of postmodernism critiques any claim to a single discernible truth, postmodernism and modernism conflict on the existence of truth. Where modernists approach the issue of &#x27;truth&#x27; with different theories (correspondence, coherence, pragmatist, semantic, etc.), postmodernists approach the issue of truth negatively by disproving the very existence of an accessible truth.

In a narrower sense, what was modernist was not necessarily also postmodernist. Those elements of modernism which accentuated the benefits of rationality and socio-technological progress were only modernist. 

Modernist reactions against postmodernism include remodernism, which rejects the cynicism and deconstruction of postmodern art in favor of reviving early modernist aesthetic currents.

== Criticism of late modernity ==
Although artistic modernism tended to reject capitalist values such as consumerism, 20th century civil society embraced global mass production and the proliferation of cheap and accessible commodities. This period of social development is known as &quot;late or high modernity&quot; and originates in advanced in Western societies. The German sociologist Jürgen Habermas, in &quot;The Theory of Communicative Action&quot; (1981), developed the first substantive critique of the culture of late modernity. Another important early critique of late modernity is the American sociologist George Ritzer&#x27;s &quot;The McDonaldization of Society&quot; (1993). Ritzer describes how late modernity became saturated with fast food consumer culture. Other authors have demonstrated how modernist devices appeared in popular cinema, and later on in music videos. Modernist design has entered the mainstream of popular culture, as simplified and stylized forms became popular, often associated with dreams of a space age high-tech future.

In 2008, Janet Bennett published &quot;Modernity and Its Critics&quot; through The Oxford Handbook of Political Theory. Merging of consumer and high -end versions of modernist culture led to a radical transformation of the meaning of &quot;modernism&quot;. First, it implied that a movement based on the rejection of tradition had become a tradition of its own. Second, it demonstrated that the distinction between elite modernist and mass consumerist culture had lost its precision. Modernism had become so institutionalized that it was now &quot;post avant-garde&quot;, indicating that it had lost its power as a revolutionary movement. Many have interpreted this transformation as the beginning of the phase that became known as postmodernism. For others, such as art critic Robert Hughes, postmodernism represents an extension of modernism.

&quot;Anti-Modern&quot; or &quot;Counter-Modern&quot; movements seek to emphasize holism, connection and spirituality as remedies or antidotes to modernism. Such movements see modernism as reductionist, and therefore subject to an inability to see systemic and emergent effects.

Some traditionalist artists like Alexander Stoddart reject modernism generally as the product of &quot;an epoch of false money allied with false culture&quot;.

In some fields, the effects of modernism have remained stronger and more persistent than in others. Visual art has made the most complete break with its past. Most major capital cities have museums devoted to modern art as distinct from post-Renaissance art ( to ). Examples include the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Tate Modern in London, and the Centre Pompidou in Paris. These galleries make no distinction between modernist and postmodernist phases, seeing both as developments within modern art.

<text>Herbert Marshall McLuhan (, ; July 21, 1911 – December 31, 1980) was a Canadian philosopher whose work is among the cornerstones of the study of media theory. He studied at the University of Manitoba and the University of Cambridge. He began his teaching career as a professor of English at several universities in the United States and Canada before moving to the University of Toronto in 1946, where he remained for the rest of his life. He is known as the &quot;father of media studies&quot;.

McLuhan coined the expression &quot;the medium is the message&quot; (in the first chapter of his &quot;Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man&quot;), as well as the term &quot;global village.&quot; He predicted the World Wide Web almost 30 years before it was invented. He was a fixture in media discourse in the late 1960s, though his influence began to wane in the early 1970s. In the years following his death, he continued to be a controversial figure in academic circles. However, with the arrival of the Internet and the World Wide Web, interest was renewed in his work and perspectives.

== Life and career ==
McLuhan was born on July 21, 1911, in Edmonton, Alberta, and was named &quot;Marshall&quot; from his maternal grandmother&#x27;s surname. His brother, Maurice, was born two years later. His parents were both also born in Canada: his mother, Elsie Naomi (née Hall), was a Baptist school teacher who later became an actress; and his father, Herbert Ernest McLuhan, was a Methodist with a real-estate business in Edmonton. When the business failed at the start of World War I, McLuhan&#x27;s father enlisted in the Canadian Army. After a year of service, he contracted influenza and remained in Canada, away from the front lines. After Herbert&#x27;s discharge from the army in 1915, the McLuhan family moved to Winnipeg, Manitoba, where Marshall grew up and went to school, attending Kelvin Technical School before enrolling in the University of Manitoba in 1928.

=== Undergraduate education ===
After studying for one year as an engineering student, he changed majors and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree (1933), winning a University Gold Medal in Arts and Sciences. He went on to receive a Master of Arts degree (1934) in English from the university as well. He had long desired to pursue graduate studies in England and was accepted by Trinity Hall, Cambridge, having failed to secure a Rhodes Scholarship to study at Oxford.

Though having already earned his BA and MA in Manitoba, Cambridge required him to enroll as an undergraduate &quot;affiliated&quot; student, with one year&#x27;s credit towards a three-year bachelor&#x27;s degree, before entering any doctoral studies. He went up to Cambridge in the autumn of 1934, studied under I. A. Richards and F. R. Leavis, and was influenced by New Criticism. Years afterward, upon reflection, he credited the faculty there with influencing the direction of his later work because of their emphasis on the &quot;training of perception&quot;, as well as such concepts as Richards&#x27; notion of &quot;feedforward&quot;. These studies formed an important precursor to his later ideas on technological forms. He received the required bachelor&#x27;s degree from Cambridge in 1936 and entered their graduate program.

=== Conversion to Catholicism ===
At the University of Manitoba, McLuhan explored his conflicted relationship with religion and turned to literature to &quot;gratify his soul&#x27;s hunger for truth and beauty,&quot; later referring to this stage as agnosticism. While studying the trivium at Cambridge, he took the first steps toward his eventual conversion to Catholicism in 1937, founded on his reading of G. K. Chesterton. In 1935, he wrote to his mother:Had I not encountered Chesterton I would have remained agnostic for many years at least. Chesterton did not convince me of religious faith, but he prevented my despair from becoming a habit or hardening into misanthropy. He opened my eyes to European culture and encouraged me to know it more closely. He taught me the reasons for all that in me was simply blind anger and misery.At the end of March 1937, McLuhan completed what was a slow but total conversion process, when he was formally received into the Catholic Church. After consulting a minister, his father accepted the decision to convert. His mother, however, felt that his conversion would hurt his career and was inconsolable. McLuhan was devout throughout his life, but his religion remained a private matter. He had a lifelong interest in the number three (e.g., the trivium, the Trinity) and sometimes said that the Virgin Mary provided intellectual guidance for him. For the rest of his career, he taught in Catholic institutions of higher education.

=== Early career, marriage, and doctorate ===

Unable to find a suitable job in Canada, he went to the United States to take a job as a teaching assistant at the University of Wisconsin–Madison for the 1936–37 academic year. From 1937 to 1944, he taught English at Saint Louis University (with an interruption from 1939 to 1940 when he returned to Cambridge). There he taught courses on Shakespeare, eventually tutoring and befriending Walter J. Ong, who would write his doctoral dissertation on a topic that McLuhan had called to his attention, as well as become a well-known authority on communication and technology.

McLuhan met Corinne Lewis in St. Louis, a teacher and aspiring actress from Fort Worth, Texas, whom he married on August 4, 1939. They spent 1939–40 in Cambridge, where he completed his master&#x27;s degree (awarded in January 1940) and began to work on his doctoral dissertation on Thomas Nashe and the verbal arts. While the McLuhans were in England, World War II had erupted in Europe. For this reason, he obtained permission to complete and submit his dissertation from the United States, without having to return to Cambridge for an oral defence. In 1940, the McLuhans returned to Saint Louis University, where they started a family as he continued teaching. He was awarded a Doctor of Philosophy degree in December 1943.

He next taught at Assumption College in Windsor, Ontario, from 1944 to 1946, then moved to Toronto in 1946 where he joined the faculty of St. Michael&#x27;s College, a Catholic college of the University of Toronto, where Hugh Kenner would be one of his students. Canadian economist and communications scholar Harold Innis was a university colleague who had a strong influence on his work. McLuhan wrote in 1964: &quot;I am pleased to think of my own book &quot;The Gutenberg Galaxy&quot; as a footnote to the observations of Innis on the subject of the psychic and social consequences, first of writing then of printing.&quot;

=== Later career and reputation ===

In the early 1950s, McLuhan began the Communication and Culture seminars at the University of Toronto, funded by the Ford Foundation. As his reputation grew, he received a growing number of offers from other universities. During this period, he published his first major work, &quot;The Mechanical Bride&quot; (1951), in which he examines the effect of advertising on society and culture. Throughout the 1950s, he and Edmund Carpenter also produced an important academic journal called &quot;Explorations&quot;. McLuhan and Carpenter have been characterized as the Toronto School of communication theory, together with Harold Innis, Eric A. Havelock, and Northrop Frye. During this time, McLuhan supervised the doctoral thesis of modernist writer Sheila Watson on the subject of Wyndham Lewis. Hoping to keep him from moving to another institute, the University of Toronto created the Centre for Culture and Technology (CCT) in 1963.

From 1967 to 1968, McLuhan was named the Albert Schweitzer Chair in Humanities at Fordham University in the Bronx. While at Fordham, he was diagnosed with a benign brain tumor, which was treated successfully. He returned to Toronto where he taught at the University of Toronto for the rest of his life and lived in Wychwood Park, a bucolic enclave on a hill overlooking the downtown where Anatol Rapoport was his neighbour.

In 1970, he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada. In 1975, the University of Dallas hosted him from April to May, appointing him to the McDermott Chair. Marshall and Corinne McLuhan had six children: Eric, twins Mary and Teresa, Stephanie, Elizabeth, and Michael. The associated costs of a large family eventually drove him to advertising work and accepting frequent consulting and speaking engagements for large corporations, including IBM and AT&amp;T.

=== Death ===
In September 1979, McLuhan suffered a stroke which affected his ability to speak. The University of Toronto&#x27;s School of Graduate Studies tried to close his research center shortly thereafter, but was deterred by substantial protests. McLuhan never fully recovered from the stroke and died in his sleep on December 31, 1980. He is buried at Holy Cross Cemetery in Thornhill, Ontario, Canada.

== Major works ==
During his years at Saint Louis University (1937–1944), McLuhan worked concurrently on two projects: his doctoral dissertation and the manuscript that was eventually published in 1951 as a book, titled &quot;The Mechanical Bride: Folklore of Industrial Man&quot;, which included only a representative selection of the materials that McLuhan had prepared for it.

McLuhan&#x27;s 1942 Cambridge University doctoral dissertation surveys the history of the verbal arts (grammar, logic, and rhetoric—collectively known as the trivium) from the time of Cicero down to the time of Thomas Nashe. In his later publications, McLuhan at times uses the Latin concept of the &quot;trivium&quot; to outline an orderly and systematic picture of certain periods in the history of Western culture. McLuhan suggests that the Late Middle Ages, for instance, were characterized by the heavy emphasis on the formal study of logic. The key development that led to the Renaissance was not the rediscovery of ancient texts, but a shift in emphasis from the formal study of logic to rhetoric and grammar. Modern life is characterized by the re-emergence of grammar as its most salient feature—a trend McLuhan felt was exemplified by the New Criticism of Richards and Leavis.

McLuhan also began the academic journal &quot;Explorations&quot; with anthropologist Edmund &quot;Ted&quot; Carpenter. In a letter to Walter Ong, dated 31 May 1953, McLuhan reports that he had received a two-year grant of $43,000 from the Ford Foundation to carry out a communication project at the University of Toronto involving faculty from different disciplines, which led to the creation of the journal.

At a Fordham lecture in 1999, Tom Wolfe suggested that a major under-acknowledged influence on McLuhan&#x27;s work is the Jesuit philosopher Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, whose ideas anticipated those of McLuhan, especially the evolution of the human mind into the &quot;noosphere.&quot; In fact, McLuhan warns against outright dismissing or whole-heartedly accepting de Chardin&#x27;s observations early on in his second published book &quot;The Gutenberg Galaxy&quot;:

In his private life, McLuhan wrote to friends saying: &quot;I am not a fan of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin. The idea that anything is better because it comes later is surely borrowed from pre-electronic technologies.&quot; Further, McLuhan noted to a Catholic collaborator: &quot;The idea of a Cosmic thrust in one direction ... is surely one of the lamest semantic fallacies ever bred by the word &#x27;evolution&#x27;.… That development should have any direction at all is inconceivable except to the highly literate community.&quot;

Some of McLuhan&#x27;s main ideas were influenced or prefigured by anthropologists like Edward Sapir and Claude Lévi-Strauss, arguably with a more complex historical and psychological analysis. The idea of the retribalization of Western society by the far-reaching techniques of communication, the view on the function of the artist in society, and the characterization of means of transportation, like the railroad and the airplane, as means of communication, are prefigured in Sapir&#x27;s 1933 article on &quot;Communication&quot; in the Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences, while the distinction between &quot;hot&quot; and &quot;cool&quot; media draws from Lévi-Strauss&#x27; distinction between hot and cold societies.

=== &quot;The Mechanical Bride&quot; (1951) ===
McLuhan&#x27;s first book, &quot;The Mechanical Bride: Folklore of Industrial Man&quot; (1951), is a pioneering study in the field now known as popular culture. In the book, McLuhan turns his attention to analysing and commenting on numerous examples of persuasion in contemporary popular culture. This followed naturally from his earlier work as both dialectic and rhetoric in the classical trivium aimed at persuasion. At this point, his focus shifted dramatically, turning inward to study the influence of communication media independent of their content. His famous aphorism &quot;the medium is the message&quot; (elaborated in his &quot;Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man&quot;, 1964) calls attention to this intrinsic effect of communications media.

His interest in the critical study of popular culture was influenced by the 1933 book &quot;Culture and Environment&quot; by F. R. Leavis and Denys Thompson, and the title &quot;The Mechanical Bride&quot; is derived from a piece by the Dadaist artist Marcel Duchamp.

&quot;The Mechanical Bride&quot; is composed of 59 short essays that may be read in any order—what he styled the &quot;mosaic approach&quot; to writing a book. Each essay begins with a newspaper or magazine article, or an advertisement, followed by McLuhan&#x27;s analysis thereof. The analyses bear on aesthetic considerations as well as on the implications behind the imagery and text. McLuhan chose these ads and articles not only to draw attention to their symbolism, as well as their implications for the corporate entities who created and disseminated them, but also to mull over what such advertising implies about the wider society at which it is aimed. Roland Barthes&#x27;s essays 1957 &quot;Mythologies&quot;, echoes McLuhan&#x27;s &quot;Mechanical Bride&quot;, as a series of exhibits of popular mass culture (like advertisements, newspaper articles and photographs) that are analyzed in a semiological way.

=== &quot;The Gutenberg Galaxy&quot; (1962) ===

Written in 1961 and first published by University of Toronto Press, &quot;The Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man&quot; (1962) is a pioneering study in the fields of oral culture, print culture, cultural studies, media ecology or media-adequacy.

Throughout the book, McLuhan makes efforts to reveal how communication technology (i.e., alphabetic writing, the printing press, and the electronic media) affects cognitive organization, which in turn has profound ramifications for social organization:
[I]f a new technology extends one or more of our senses outside us into the social world, then new ratios among all of our senses will occur in that particular culture. It is comparable to what happens when a new note is added to a melody. And when the sense ratios alter in any culture then what had appeared lucid before may suddenly become opaque, and what had been vague or opaque will become translucent.

==== Movable type ====
McLuhan&#x27;s episodic history takes the reader from pre-alphabetic, tribal humankind to the electronic age. According to McLuhan, the invention of movable type greatly accelerated, intensified, and ultimately enabled cultural and cognitive changes that had already been taking place since the invention and implementation of the alphabet, by which McLuhan means phonemic orthography. (McLuhan is careful to distinguish the phonetic alphabet from logographic or logogramic writing systems, such as Egyptian hieroglyphs or ideograms.)

Print culture, ushered in by the advance in printing during the middle of the 15th century when the Gutenberg press was invented, brought about the cultural predominance of the visual over the aural/oral. Quoting (with approval) an observation on the nature of the printed word from William Ivins&#x27; &quot;Prints and Visual Communication&quot;, McLuhan remarks:
In this passage [Ivins] not only notes the ingraining of lineal, sequential habits, but, even more important, points out the visual homogenizing of experience of print culture, and the relegation of auditory and other sensuous complexity to the background.…The technology and social effects of typography incline us to abstain from noting interplay and, as it were, &quot;formal&quot; causality, both in our inner and external lives. Print exists by virtue of the static separation of functions and fosters a mentality that gradually resists any but a separative and compartmentalizing or specialist outlook.

The main concept of McLuhan&#x27;s argument (later elaborated upon in &quot;The Medium Is the Massage&quot;) is that new technologies (such as alphabets, printing presses, and even speech) exert a gravitational effect on cognition, which in turn, affects social organization: print technology changes our perceptual habits—&quot;visual homogenizing of experience&quot;—which in turn affects social interactions—&quot;fosters a mentality that gradually resists all but a…specialist outlook&quot;. According to McLuhan, this advance of print technology contributed to and made possible most of the salient trends in the modern period in the Western world: individualism, democracy, Protestantism, capitalism, and nationalism. For McLuhan, these trends all reverberate with print technology&#x27;s principle of &quot;segmentation of actions and functions and principle of visual quantification.&quot;

==== Global village ====
In the early 1960s, McLuhan wrote that the visual, individualistic print culture would soon be brought to an end by what he called &quot;electronic interdependence&quot; wherein electronic media replaces visual culture with aural/oral culture. In this new age, humankind would move from individualism and fragmentation to a collective identity, with a &quot;tribal base.&quot; McLuhan&#x27;s coinage for this new social organization is the &quot;global village&quot;.

The term is sometimes described as having negative connotations in &quot;The Gutenberg Galaxy&quot;, but McLuhan was interested in exploring effects, not making value judgments:
Instead of tending towards a vast Alexandrian library the world has become a computer, an electronic brain, exactly as an infantile piece of science fiction. And as our senses have gone outside us, Big Brother goes inside. So, unless aware of this dynamic, we shall at once move into a phase of panic terrors, exactly befitting a small world of tribal drums, total interdependence, and superimposed co-existence.… Terror is the normal state of any oral society, for in it everything affects everything all the time.…In our long striving to recover for the Western world a unity of sensibility and of thought and feeling we have no more been prepared to accept the tribal consequences of such unity than we were ready for the fragmentation of the human psyche by print culture.

Key to McLuhan&#x27;s argument is the idea that technology has no &quot;per se&quot; moral bent—it is a tool that profoundly shapes an individual&#x27;s and, by extension, a society&#x27;s self-conception and realization:

Is it not obvious that there are always enough moral problems without also taking a moral stand on technological grounds?…Print is the extreme phase of alphabet culture that detribalizes or decollectivizes man in the first instance. Print raises the visual features of alphabet to highest intensity of definition. Thus, print carries the individuating power of the phonetic alphabet much further than manuscript culture could ever do. Print is the technology of individualism. If men decided to modify this visual technology by an electric technology, individualism would also be modified. To raise a moral complaint about this is like cussing a buzz-saw for lopping off fingers. &quot;But&quot;, someone says, &quot;we didn&#x27;t know it would happen.&quot; Yet even witlessness is not a moral issue. It is a problem, but not a moral problem; and it would be nice to clear away some of the moral fogs that surround our technologies. It would be good for morality.

The moral valence of technology&#x27;s effects on cognition is, for McLuhan, a matter of perspective. For instance, McLuhan contrasts the considerable alarm and revulsion that the growing quantity of books aroused in the latter 17th century with the modern concern for the &quot;end of the book.&quot; If there can be no universal moral sentence passed on technology, McLuhan believes that &quot;there can only be disaster arising from unawareness of the causalities and effects inherent in our technologies&quot;.

Though the World Wide Web was invented almost 30 years after &quot;The Gutenberg Galaxy&quot;, and 10 years after his death, McLuhan prophesied the web technology seen today as early as 1962:

The next medium, whatever it is—it may be the extension of consciousness—will include television as its content, not as its environment, and will transform television into an art form. A computer as a research and communication instrument could enhance retrieval, obsolesce mass library organization, retrieve the individual&#x27;s encyclopedic function and flip into a private line to speedily tailored data of a saleable kind.

Furthermore, McLuhan coined and certainly popularized the usage of the term &quot;surfing&quot; to refer to rapid, irregular, and multidirectional movement through a heterogeneous body of documents or knowledge, e.g., statements such as &quot;Heidegger surf-boards along on the electronic wave as triumphantly as Descartes rode the mechanical wave.&quot; Paul Levinson&#x27;s 1999 book &quot;Digital McLuhan&quot; explores the ways that McLuhan&#x27;s work may be understood better through using the lens of the digital revolution.

McLuhan frequently quoted Walter Ong&#x27;s &quot;Ramus, Method, and the Decay of Dialogue&quot; (1958), which evidently had prompted McLuhan to write &quot;The Gutenberg Galaxy&quot;. Ong wrote a highly favorable review of this new book in &quot;America&quot;. However, Ong later tempered his praise, by describing McLuhan&#x27;s &quot;The Gutenberg Galaxy&quot; as &quot;a racy survey, indifferent to some scholarly detail, but uniquely valuable in suggesting the sweep and depth of the cultural and psychological changes entailed in the passage from illiteracy to print and beyond.&quot; McLuhan himself said of the book, &quot;I&#x27;m not concerned to get any kudos out of [&quot;The Gutenberg Galaxy&quot;]. It seems to me a book that somebody should have written a century ago. I wish somebody else had written it. It will be a useful prelude to the rewrite of &quot;Understanding Media&quot; [the 1960 NAEB report] that I&#x27;m doing now.&quot;

McLuhan&#x27;s &quot;The Gutenberg Galaxy&quot; won Canada&#x27;s highest literary award, the Governor-General&#x27;s Award for Non-Fiction, in 1962. The chairman of the selection committee was McLuhan&#x27;s colleague at the University of Toronto and oftentime intellectual sparring partner, Northrop Frye.

=== &quot;Understanding Media&quot; (1964) ===
McLuhan&#x27;s best-known work, &quot;Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man&quot; (1964), is a seminal study in media theory. Dismayed by the way in which people approach and use new media such as television, McLuhan famously argues that in the modern world &quot;we live mythically and integrally…but continue to think in the old, fragmented space and time patterns of the pre-electric age.&quot;

McLuhan proposes that media themselves, not the content they carry, should be the focus of study—popularly quoted as &quot;the medium is the message&quot;. His insight is that a medium affects the society in which it plays a role not by the content it delivers, but by its own characteristics. McLuhan points to the light bulb as a clear demonstration of this. A light bulb does not have content in the way that a newspaper has articles, or a television has programs, but it is a medium that has a social effect; that is, a light bulb enables people to create spaces at night that would otherwise be enveloped by darkness. He describes the light bulb as a medium without any content. McLuhan writes, &quot;a light bulb creates an environment by its mere presence.&quot; More controversially, he postulates that content has little effect on society—for example, whether television broadcasts children&#x27;s shows or violent programming, its effect on society is identical. He notes that all media have characteristics that engage the viewer in different ways; for instance, a passage in a book can be reread at will, but a movie must be screened again in its entirety to study any part of it.

==== &quot;Hot&quot; and &quot;cool&quot; media ====
In the first part of &quot;Understanding Media&quot;, McLuhan writes that different media invite different degrees of participation on the part of a person who chooses to consume a medium. Using terminology derived from French anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss&#x27;s distinction between hot and cold societies, McLuhan argues that a cool medium requires increased involvement due to decreased description, while a hot medium is the opposite, decreasing involvement and increasing description. In other words, a society that appears to be actively participating in streaming content but does not consider the tool&#x27;s effects is not allowing an &quot;extension of ourselves&quot;. A movie is thus said to be &quot;high definition&quot;, demanding a viewer&#x27;s attention, and a comic book &quot;low definition&quot;, requiring much more conscious participation by the reader to extract value: &quot;Any hot medium allows of less participation than a cool one, as a lecture makes for less participation than a seminar, and a book for less than a dialogue.&quot;

Some media, such as movies, are &quot;hot&quot;—that is, they enhance a single sense, in this case vision, in such a manner that a person does not need to exert much effort to perceive a detailed moving image. Hot media usually, but not always, provide complete involvement with considerable stimulus. In contrast, &quot;cool&quot; print may also occupy visual space, using visual senses, but require focus and comprehension to immerse readers. Hot media creation favour analytical precision, quantitative analysis and sequential ordering, as they are usually sequential, linear, and logical. They emphasize one sense (for example, of sight or sound) over the others. For this reason, hot media include film (especially silent films), radio, the lecture, and photography.

McLuhan contrasts &quot;hot&quot; media with &quot;cool&quot;—specifically, television [of the 1960s i.e. small black-and-white screens], which he claims requires more effort from the viewer to determine meaning; and comics, which, due to their minimal presentation of visual detail, require a high degree of effort to fill in details the cartoonist may have intended to portray. Cool media are usually, but not always, those that provide little involvement with substantial stimulus. They require more active participation on the part of the user, including the perception of abstract patterning and simultaneous comprehension of all parts. Therefore, in addition to television, cool media include seminars and cartoons. McLuhan describes the term &quot;cool media&quot; as emerging from jazz and popular music used, in this context, to mean &quot;detached&quot;.

This appears to force media into binary categories, but McLuhan&#x27;s hot and cool exist on a continuum: they are more correctly measured on a scale than as dichotomous terms.

==== Critiques of &quot;Understanding Media&quot; ====
Some theorists have attacked McLuhan&#x27;s definition and treatment of the word &quot;medium&quot; for being too simplistic. Umberto Eco, for instance, contends that McLuhan&#x27;s medium conflates channels, codes, and messages under the overarching term of the medium, confusing the vehicle, internal code, and content of a given message in his framework.

In &quot;Media Manifestos&quot;, Régis Debray also takes issue with McLuhan&#x27;s envisioning of the medium. Like Eco, he is ill at ease with this reductionist approach, summarizing its ramifications as follows:

 The list of objections could be and has been lengthened indefinitely: confusing technology itself with its use of the media makes of the media an abstract, undifferentiated force and produces its image in an imaginary &quot;public&quot; for mass consumption; the magical naivete of supposed causalities turns the media into a catch-all and contagious &quot;mana&quot;; apocalyptic millenarianism invents the figure of a &quot;homo mass-mediaticus&quot; without ties to historical and social context, and so on.

Furthermore, when &quot;Wired&quot; magazine interviewed him in 1995, Debray said he saw McLuhan &quot;more as a poet than a historian, a master of intellectual collage rather than a systematic analyst.… McLuhan overemphasizes the technology behind cultural change at the expense of the usage that the messages and codes make of that technology.&quot;

Dwight Macdonald, in turn, reproached McLuhan for his focus on television and for his &quot;aphoristic&quot; prose style, which he believes leaves &quot;Understanding Media&quot; filled with &quot;contradictions, non-sequiturs, facts that are distorted and facts that are not facts, exaggerations, and chronic rhetorical vagueness.&quot;

Brian Winston&#x27;s &quot;Misunderstanding Media&quot;, published in 1986, chides McLuhan for what he sees as his technologically deterministic stances. Raymond Williams furthers this point of contention, claiming:

The work of McLuhan was a particular culmination of an aesthetic theory which became, negatively, a social theory ... It is an apparently sophisticated technological determinism which has the significant effect of indicating a social and cultural determinism.… For if the medium—whether print or television—is the cause, all other causes, all that men ordinarily see as history, are at once reduced to effects.

David Carr wrote that there has been a long line of &quot;academics who have made a career out of deconstructing McLuhan’s effort to define the modern media ecosystem&quot;, whether it be due to what they see as McLuhan&#x27;s ignorance of sociohistorical context or the style of his argument.

While some critics have taken issue with McLuhan&#x27;s writing style and mode of argument, McLuhan himself urged readers to think of his work as &quot;probes&quot; or &quot;mosaics&quot; offering a toolkit approach to thinking about media. His eclectic writing style has also been praised for its postmodern sensibilities and suitability for virtual space.

=== &quot;The Medium Is the Massage&quot; (1967) ===

&quot;The Medium Is the Massage: An Inventory of Effects&quot;, published in 1967, was McLuhan&#x27;s best seller, &quot;eventually selling nearly a million copies worldwide.&quot; Initiated by Quentin Fiore, McLuhan adopted the term &quot;massage&quot; to denote the effect each medium has on the human sensorium, taking inventory of the &quot;effects&quot; of numerous media in terms of how they &quot;massage&quot; the sensorium.

Fiore, at the time a prominent graphic designer and communications consultant, set about composing the visual illustration of these effects which were compiled by Jerome Agel. Near the beginning of the book, Fiore adopted a pattern in which an image demonstrating a media effect was presented with a textual synopsis on the facing page. The reader experiences a repeated shifting of analytic registers—from &quot;reading&quot; typographic print to &quot;scanning&quot; photographic facsimiles—reinforcing McLuhan&#x27;s overarching argument in this book: namely, that each medium produces a different &quot;massage&quot; or &quot;effect&quot; on the human sensorium.

In &quot;The Medium Is the Massage&quot;, McLuhan also rehashed the argument—which first appeared in the Prologue to 1962&#x27;s &quot;The Gutenberg Galaxy&quot;—that all media are &quot;extensions&quot; of our human senses, bodies and minds.

Finally, McLuhan described key points of change in how man has viewed the world and how these views were changed by the adoption of new media. &quot;The technique of invention was the discovery of the nineteenth [century]&quot;, brought on by the adoption of fixed points of view and perspective by typography, while &quot;[t]he technique of the suspended judgment is the discovery of the twentieth century,&quot; brought on by the bard abilities of radio, movies and television.The past went that-a-way. When faced with a totally new situation we tend always to attach ourselves to the objects, to the flavor of the most recent past. We look at the present through a rear-view mirror. We march backward into the future. Suburbia lives imaginatively in Bonanza-land.An audio recording version of McLuhan&#x27;s famous work was made by Columbia Records. The recording consists of a pastiche of statements made by McLuhan &quot;interrupted&quot; by other speakers, including people speaking in various phonations and falsettos, discordant sounds and 1960s incidental music in what could be considered a deliberate attempt to translate the disconnected images seen on TV into an audio format, resulting in the prevention of a connected stream of conscious thought. Various audio recording techniques and statements are used to illustrate the relationship between spoken, literary speech and the characteristics of electronic audio media. McLuhan biographer Philip Marchand called the recording &quot;the 1967 equivalent of a McLuhan video.&quot;&quot;I wouldn&#x27;t be seen dead with a living work of art.&quot;—&#x27;Old man&#x27; speaking

&quot;Drop this jiggery-pokery and talk straight turkey.&quot;—&quot;Middle-aged man&quot; speaking

=== &quot;War and Peace in the Global Village&quot; (1968) ===

In &quot;War and Peace in the Global Village&quot;, McLuhan used James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;, an inspiration for this study of war throughout history, as an indicator as to how war may be conducted in the future.

Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Wake&quot; is claimed to be a gigantic cryptogram that reveals a cyclic pattern for human history through its Ten Thunders. Each &quot;thunder&quot; below is a 100-character portmanteau of other words to create a statement McLuhan likens to an effect that each technology has on the society into which it is introduced. In order to glean the most understanding out of each, the reader must break the portmanteau into separate words (many of these themselves portmanteaus of words taken from multiple languages other than English) and speak them aloud for the spoken effect of each word. There is much dispute over what each portmanteau truly denotes.

McLuhan claims that the ten thunders in &quot;Wake&quot; represent different stages in the history of man:
*&quot;Thunder 1: Paleolithic to Neolithic.&quot; Speech. Split of East/West. From herding to harnessing animals.
*&quot;Thunder 2: Clothing as weaponry.&quot; Enclosure of private parts. First social aggression.
*&quot;Thunder 3: Specialism.&quot; Centralism via wheel, transport, cities: civil life.
*&quot;Thunder 4: Markets and truck gardens.&quot; Patterns of nature submitted to greed and power.
*&quot;Thunder 5: Printing.&quot; Distortion and translation of human patterns and postures and pastors.
*&quot;Thunder 6: Industrial Revolution.&quot; Extreme development of print process and individualism.
*&quot;Thunder 7: Tribal man again.&quot; All characters end up separate, private man. Return of choric.
*&quot;Thunder 8: Movies.&quot; Pop art, pop Kulch via tribal radio. Wedding of sight and sound.
*&quot;Thunder 9: Car and Plane.&quot; Both centralizing and decentralizing at once create cities in crisis. Speed and death.
*&quot;Thunder 10: Television.&quot; Back to tribal involvement in tribal mood-mud. The last thunder is a turbulent, muddy wake, and murk of non-visual, tactile man.

=== &quot;From Cliché to Archetype&quot; (1970) ===

Collaborating with Canadian poet Wilfred Watson in &quot;From Cliché to Archetype&quot; (1970), McLuhan approaches the various implications of the verbal cliché and of the archetype. One major facet in McLuhan&#x27;s overall framework introduced in this book that is seldom noticed is the provision of a new term that actually succeeds the global village: the &quot;global theater&quot;.

In McLuhan&#x27;s terms, a &quot;cliché&quot; is a &quot;normal&quot; action, phrase, etc. which becomes so often used that we are &quot;anesthetized&quot; to its effects. McLuhan provides the example of Eugène Ionesco&#x27;s play &quot;The Bald Soprano&quot;, whose dialogue consists entirely of phrases Ionesco pulled from an Assimil language book: &quot;Ionesco originally put all these idiomatic English clichés into literary French which presented the English in the most absurd aspect possible.&quot;

McLuhan&#x27;s &quot;archetype&quot; &quot;is a quoted extension, medium, technology, or environment.&quot; &quot;Environment&quot; would also include the kinds of &quot;awareness&quot; and cognitive shifts brought upon people by it, not totally unlike the psychological context Carl Jung described.

McLuhan also posits that there is a factor of interplay between the &quot;cliché&quot; and the &quot;archetype&quot;, or a &quot;doubleness&quot;:

Another theme of the Wake [&quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;] that helps in the understanding of the paradoxical shift from cliché to archetype is &#x27;past time are pastimes.&#x27; The dominant technologies of one age become the games and pastimes of a later age. In the 20th century, the number of &#x27;past times&#x27; that are simultaneously available is so vast as to create cultural anarchy. When all the cultures of the world are simultaneously present, the work of the artist in the elucidation of form takes on new scope and new urgency. Most men are pushed into the artist&#x27;s role. The artist cannot dispense with the principle of &#x27;doubleness&#x27; or &#x27;interplay&#x27; because this type of hendiadys dialogue is essential to the very structure of consciousness, awareness, and autonomy.

McLuhan relates the cliché-to-archetype process to the Theater of the Absurd:
Pascal, in the seventeenth century, tells us that the heart has many reasons of which the head knows nothing. The Theater of the Absurd is essentially a communicating to the head of some of the silent languages of the heart which in two or three hundred years it has tried to forget all about. In the seventeenth century world the languages of the heart were pushed down into the unconscious by the dominant print cliché.

The &quot;languages of the heart&quot;, or what McLuhan otherwise defined as oral culture, were thus made archetype by means of the printing press, and turned into cliché.

According to McLuhan, the satellite medium encloses the Earth in a man-made environment, which &quot;ends &#x27;Nature&#x27; and turns the globe into a repertory theater to be programmed.&quot; All previous environments (book, newspaper, radio, etc.) and their artifacts are retrieved under these conditions (&quot;past times are pastimes&quot;). McLuhan thereby meshes this into the term &quot;global theater&quot;. This updates his concept of the global village, which, in its own definitions, can be said to be subsumed into the overall condition of the global theater.

=== &quot;The Global Village&quot; (1989) ===

In his posthumous book, &quot;The Global Village: Transformations in World Life and Media in the 21st Century&quot; (1989), McLuhan, collaborating with Bruce R. Powers, provides a strong conceptual framework for understanding the cultural implications of the technological advances associated with the rise of a worldwide electronic network. This is a major work of McLuhan&#x27;s as it contains the most extensive elaboration of his concept of &quot;acoustic space&quot;, and provides a critique of standard 20th-century communication models such as the Shannon–Weaver model.

McLuhan distinguishes between the existing worldview of &quot;visual space&quot;—a linear, quantitative, classically geometric model—and that of &quot;acoustic space&quot;—a holistic, qualitative order with an intricate, paradoxical topology: &quot;Acoustic Space has the basic character of a sphere whose focus or center is simultaneously everywhere and whose margin is nowhere.&quot; The transition from &quot;visual&quot; to &quot;acoustic&quot; &quot;space&quot; was not automatic with the advent of the global network, but would have to be a conscious project. The &quot;universal environment of simultaneous electronic flow&quot; inherently favors right-brain Acoustic Space, yet we are held back by habits of adhering to a fixed point of view. There are no boundaries to sound. We hear from all directions at once. Yet Acoustic and Visual Space are inseparable. The resonant interval is the invisible borderline between Visual and Acoustic Space. This is like the television camera that the Apollo 8 astronauts focused on the Earth after they had orbited the Moon.

McLuhan illustrates how it feels to exist within acoustic space by quoting from the autobiography of Jacques Lusseyran, &quot;And There Was Light.&quot; Lusseyran lost his eyesight in a violent accident as a child, and the autobiography describes how a reordering of his sensory life and perception followed:When I came upon the myth of objectivity in certain modern thinkers, it made me angry. So, there was only one world for these people, the same for everyone. And all the other worlds were to be counted as illusions left over from the past. Or why not call them by their name—hallucinations? I had learned to my cost how wrong they were. From my own experience I knew very well that it was enough to take from a man a memory here, an association there, to deprive him of hearing or sight, for the world to undergo immediate transformation, and for another world, entirely different, but entirely coherent, to be born. Another world? Not really. The same world, rather, but seen from a different angle, and counted in entirely new measures. When this happened all the hierarchies they called objective were turned upside down, scattered to the four winds, not even theories but like whims.Reading, writing, and hierarchical ordering are associated with the left brain and visual space, as are the linear concept of time and phonetic literacy. The left brain is the locus of analysis, classification, and rationality. The right brain and acoustic space are the locus of the spatial, tactile, and musical. &quot;Comprehensive awareness&quot; results when the two sides of the brain are in true balance. Visual Space is associated with the simplified worldview of Euclidean geometry, the intuitive three dimensions useful for the architecture of buildings and the surveying of land. It is linearly rational and has no grasp of the acoustic. Acoustic Space is multisensory. McLuhan writes about robotism in the context of Japanese Zen Buddhism and how it can offer us new ways of thinking about technology. The Western way of thinking about technology is too related to the left brain, which has a rational and linear focus. What he called robotism might better be called androidism in the wake of &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and the novels of Philip K. Dick. Robotism-androidism emerges from the further development of the right brain, creativity and a new relationship to spacetime (most humans are still living in 17th-century classical Newtonian physics spacetime). Robots-androids will have much greater flexibility than humans have had until now, in both mind and body. Robots-androids will teach humanity this new flexibility. And this flexibility of androids (what McLuhan calls robotism) has a strong affinity with Japanese culture and life. McLuhan quotes from Ruth Benedict&#x27;s &quot;The Chrysanthemum and the Sword&quot; an anthropological study of Japanese culture published in 1946:Occidentals cannot easily credit the ability of the Japanese to swing from one behavior to another without psychic cost. Such extreme possibilities are not included in our experience. Yet in Japanese life the contradictions, as they seem to us, are as deeply based in their view of life as our uniformities are in ours.The ability to live in the present and instantly readjust.

==== Beyond existing communication models ====
&quot;All Western scientific models of communication are—like the Shannon–Weaver model—linear, sequential, and logical as a reflection of the late medieval emphasis on the Greek notion of efficient causality.&quot; McLuhan and Powers criticize the Shannon-Weaver model of communication as emblematic of left-hemisphere bias and linearity, descended from a print-era perversion of Aristotle&#x27;s notion of efficient causality.

A third term of &quot;The Global Village&quot; that McLuhan and Powers develop at length is The Tetrad. McLuhan had begun development on the Tetrad as early as 1974. The tetrad is an analogical, simultaneous, fourfold pattern of transformation. &quot;At full maturity the tetrad reveals the metaphoric structure of the artifact as having two figures and two grounds in dynamic and analogical relationship to each other.&quot; Like the camera focused on the Earth by the Apollo 8 astronauts, the tetrad reveals figure (Moon) and ground (Earth) simultaneously. The right-brain hemisphere thinking is the capability of being in many places at the same time. Electricity is acoustic. It is simultaneously everywhere. The Tetrad, with its fourfold Möbius topological structure of enhancement, reversal, retrieval and obsolescence, is mobilized by McLuhan and Powers to illuminate the media or technological inventions of cash money, the compass, the computer, the database, the satellite, and the global media network.

== Key concepts ==
=== Tetrad of media effects ===
In &quot;Laws of Media&quot; (1988), published posthumously by his son Eric, McLuhan summarized his ideas about media in a concise tetrad of media effects. The tetrad is a means of examining the effects on society of any technology (i.e., any medium) by dividing its effects into four categories and displaying them simultaneously. McLuhan designed the tetrad as a pedagogical tool, phrasing his laws as questions with which to consider any medium:

*What does the medium enhance?
*What does the medium make obsolete?
*What does the medium retrieve that had been obsolesced earlier?
*What does the medium flip into when pushed to extremes?

The laws of the tetrad exist simultaneously, not successively or chronologically, and allow the questioner to explore the &quot;grammar and syntax&quot; of the &quot;language&quot; of media. McLuhan departs from his mentor Harold Innis in suggesting that a medium &quot;overheats,&quot; or reverses into an opposing form, when taken to its extreme.

Visually, a tetrad can be depicted as four diamonds forming an X, with the name of a medium in the centre. The two diamonds on the left of a tetrad are the &quot;Enhancement&quot; and &quot;Retrieval&quot; qualities of the medium, both &quot;Figure&quot; qualities. The two diamonds on the right of a tetrad are the &quot;Obsolescence&quot; and &quot;Reversal&quot; qualities, both &quot;Ground&quot; qualities.

Using the example of radio:

* Enhancement (figure): What the medium amplifies or intensifies. &quot;Radio amplifies news and music via sound.&quot;
* Obsolescence (ground): What the medium drives out of prominence. &quot;Radio reduces the importance of print and the visual.&quot;
* Retrieval (figure): What the medium recovers which was previously lost. &quot;Radio returns the spoken word to the forefront.&quot;
* Reversal (ground): What the medium does when pushed to its limits. &quot;Acoustic radio flips into audio-visual TV.&quot;

=== Figure and ground ===
McLuhan adapted the Gestalt psychology idea of a &quot;figure and a ground&quot;, which underpins the meaning of &quot;the medium is the message.&quot; He used this concept to explain how a form of communications technology, the medium, or &quot;figure&quot;, necessarily operates through its context, or &quot;ground&quot;.

McLuhan believed that in order to grasp fully the effect of a new technology, one must examine figure (medium) and ground (context) together, since neither is completely intelligible without the other. McLuhan argued that we must study media in their historical context, particularly in relation to the technologies that preceded them. The present environment, itself made up of the effects of previous technologies, gives rise to new technologies, which, in their turn, further affect society and individuals.

All technologies have embedded within them their own assumptions about time and space. The message which the medium conveys can only be understood if the medium and the environment in which the medium is used—and which, simultaneously, it effectively creates—are analysed together. He believed that an examination of the figure-ground relationship can offer a critical commentary on culture and society.

===Opposition between optic and haptic perception===

In McLuhan&#x27;s (and Harley Parker&#x27;s) work, electric media have an affinity with haptic and hearing perception, while mechanical media have an affinity with visual perception. This opposition between optic and haptic had previously been formulated by art historians Alois Riegl in his 1901 &quot;Late Roman Art Industry&quot;, and by Erwin Panofsky, in his 1927 &quot;Perspective as Symbolic Form&quot;.

In his &quot;The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction&quot; (1935), Walter Benjamin observed how, in perceptions of modern Western culture, from about the 19th century a shift began from the optic toward the haptic. This shift is one of the main recurring topics in McLuhan&#x27;s work, which McLuhan attributes to the advent of the electronic era.

== Legacy ==
===Influence===
After the publication of &quot;Understanding Media&quot;, McLuhan received an astonishing amount of publicity, making him perhaps the most-publicized 20th-century English teacher and arguably the most controversial. This publicity began with the work of two California advertising executives, Howard Gossage and Gerald Feigen, who used personal funds to fund their practice of &quot;genius scouting&quot;. Much enamoured of McLuhan&#x27;s work, Feigen and Gossage arranged for McLuhan to meet with editors of several major New York magazines in May 1965 at the Lombardy Hotel in New York. Philip Marchand reports that, as a direct consequence of these meetings, McLuhan was offered the use of an office in the headquarters of both &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot; anytime he wanted it.

In August 1965, Feigen and Gossage held what they called a &quot;McLuhan festival&quot; in the offices of Gossage&#x27;s advertising agency in San Francisco. During this &quot;festival&quot;, McLuhan met with advertising executives, members of the mayor&#x27;s office, and editors from the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; and &quot;Ramparts&quot; magazine. More significant was the presence at the festival of Tom Wolfe, who wrote about McLuhan in a subsequent article, &quot;What If He Is Right?&quot;, published in &quot;New York&quot; magazine and Wolfe&#x27;s own &quot;The Pump House Gang&quot;. According to Feigen and Gossage, their work had only a moderate effect on McLuhan&#x27;s eventual celebrity: they claimed that their work only &quot;probably speeded up the recognition of his genius by about six months.&quot; In any case, McLuhan soon became a fixture of media discourse. &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine did a cover story on him; articles appeared in &quot;Life&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Fortune&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, and others. Cartoons about him appeared in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. In 1969, &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine published a lengthy interview with him. In a running gag on the popular sketch comedy &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;, the &quot;poet&quot; Henry Gibson would randomly say, &quot;Marshall McLuhan, what are you doin&#x27;?&quot;

McLuhan was credited with coining the phrase &quot;Turn on, tune in, drop out&quot; by its popularizer, Timothy Leary, in the 1960s. In a 1988 interview with Neil Strauss, Leary said the slogan was &quot;given to him&quot; by McLuhan during a lunch in New York City. Leary said McLuhan &quot;was very much interested in ideas and marketing, and he started singing something like, &#x27;Psychedelics hit the spot / Five hundred micrograms, that’s a lot,&#x27; to the tune of a Pepsi commercial. Then he started going, &#x27;Tune in, turn on, and drop out.

During his lifetime and afterward, McLuhan heavily influenced cultural critics, thinkers, and media theorists such as Neil Postman, Jean Baudrillard, Timothy Leary, Terence McKenna, William Irwin Thompson, Paul Levinson, Douglas Rushkoff, Jaron Lanier, Hugh Kenner, and John David Ebert, as well as political leaders such as Pierre Elliott Trudeau and Jerry Brown. Andy Warhol was paraphrasing McLuhan with his now famous &quot;15 minutes of fame&quot; quote. When asked in the 1970s for a way to sedate violence in Angola, he suggested a massive spread of TV devices. Douglas Coupland argued that McLuhan &quot;was conservative, socially, but he never let politics enter his writing or his teaching&quot;.

===Popular culture===
Woody Allen&#x27;s Oscar-winning &quot;Annie Hall&quot; (1977) featured McLuhan in a cameo as himself. In the film, a pompous academic is arguing with Allen in a cinema queue when McLuhan suddenly appears and silences him, saying, &quot;You know nothing of my work.&quot;

The character &quot;Brian O&#x27;Blivion&quot; in David Cronenberg&#x27;s 1983 film &quot;Videodrome&quot; is a &quot;media oracle&quot; based on McLuhan.

In 1991, McLuhan was named the &quot;patron saint&quot; of &quot;Wired&quot; magazine and a quote of his appeared on the masthead for the first ten years of its publication.

McLuhan&#x27;s perspective on the cycle of cultural identity inspired Duke Ellington&#x27;s album &quot;The Afro-Eurasian Eclipse&quot;.

He is mentioned by name in a Peter Gabriel–penned lyric in the song &quot;Broadway Melody of 1974&quot;, on Genesis&#x27;s concept album &quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot;: &quot;Marshall McLuhan, casual viewin&#x27;, head buried in the sand.&quot;

McLuhan is jokingly referred to in an episode of &quot;The Sopranos&quot; titled &quot;House Arrest&quot;.

Despite his death in 1980, someone claiming to be McLuhan posted on a &quot;Wired&quot; mailing list in 1996. The information this person provided convinced one &quot;Wired&quot; writer that &quot;if the poster was not McLuhan himself, it was a bot programmed with an eerie command of McLuhan&#x27;s life and inimitable perspective.&quot;

McLuhan is the subject of the 1993 play &quot;The Medium&quot;, the first major work by the Saratoga International Theater Institute and director Anne Bogart. The play was revived by SITI Company for a farewell tour in 2022.

===Recognition===
A new centre known as the McLuhan Program in Culture and Technology, formed soon after his death in 1980, was the successor to McLuhan&#x27;s Centre for Culture and Technology at the University of Toronto. Since 1994, it was part of the University of Toronto Faculty of Information. In 2008, the centre incorporated in the Coach House Institute, which was subsequently renamed The McLuhan Centre for Culture and Technology. In 2011, at the time of his centenary, the centre established a &quot;Marshall McLuhan Centenary Fellowship&quot; program in his honour. The centre closed in 2023. The Canadian Embassy in Manila awards a Marshall McLuhan Fellowship for &quot;Excellence in Journalism ... that promotes professional, responsible and courageous media.&quot; 

In Toronto, Marshall McLuhan Catholic Secondary School is named after him.

The media room at Canada House in Berlin is called the Marshall McLuhan Salon. It includes a multimedia information centre and an auditorium, and hosts a permanent exhibition dedicated to McLuhan, based on its collection of film and audio items by and about him.

<text>Multiple inheritance is a feature of some object-oriented computer programming languages in which an object or class can inherit features from more than one parent object or parent class. It is distinct from single inheritance, where an object or class may only inherit from one particular object or class.

Multiple inheritance has been a controversial issue for many years, with opponents pointing to its increased complexity and ambiguity in situations such as the &quot;diamond problem&quot;, where it may be ambiguous as to which parent class a particular feature is inherited from if more than one parent class implements said feature. This can be addressed in various ways, including using virtual inheritance. Alternate methods of object composition not based on inheritance such as mixins and traits have also been proposed to address the ambiguity.

==Details==
In object-oriented programming (OOP), &quot;inheritance&quot; describes a relationship between two classes in which one class (the &quot;child&quot; class) &quot;subclasses&quot; the &quot;parent&quot; class. The child inherits methods and attributes of the parent, allowing for shared functionality. For example, one might create a variable class &quot;Mammal&quot; with features such as eating, reproducing, etc.; then define a child class &quot;Cat&quot; that inherits those features without having to explicitly program them, while adding new features like &quot;chasing mice&quot;.

Multiple inheritance allows programmers to use more than one totally orthogonal hierarchy simultaneously, such as allowing &quot;Cat&quot; to inherit from &quot;Cartoon character&quot; and &quot;Pet&quot; and &quot;Mammal&quot; and access features from within all of those classes.

==Implementations==
Languages that support multiple inheritance include: C++, Common Lisp (via Common Lisp Object System (CLOS)), EuLisp (via The EuLisp Object System TELOS), Curl, Dylan, Eiffel, Logtalk, Object REXX, Scala (via use of mixin classes), OCaml, Perl, POP-11, Python, R, Raku, and Tcl (built-in from 8.6 or via Incremental Tcl (Incr Tcl) in earlier versions).

IBM System Object Model (SOM) runtime supports multiple inheritance, and any programming language targeting SOM can implement new SOM classes inherited from multiple bases.

Some object-oriented languages, such as Swift, Java, Fortran since its 2003 revision, C#, and Ruby implement &quot;single inheritance&quot;, although protocols, or &quot;interfaces,&quot; provide some of the functionality of true multiple inheritance.

PHP uses traits classes to inherit specific method implementations. Ruby uses modules to inherit multiple methods.

== The diamond problem ==
The &quot;diamond problem&quot; (sometimes referred to as the &quot;Deadly Diamond of Death&quot;) is an ambiguity that arises when two classes B and C inherit from A, and class D inherits from both B and C. If there is a method in A that B and C have overridden, and D does not override it, then which version of the method does D inherit: that of B, or that of C?

For example, in the context of GUI software development, a class codice_1 may inherit from both classes codice_2 (for appearance) and codice_3 (for functionality/input handling), and classes codice_2 and codice_3 both inherit from the codice_6 class. Now if the codice_7 method is called for a codice_1 object and there is no such method in the codice_1 class but there is an overridden codice_7 method in codice_2 or codice_3 (or both), which method should be eventually called?

It is called the &quot;diamond problem&quot; because of the shape of the class inheritance diagram in this situation. In this case, class A is at the top, both B and C separately beneath it, and D joins the two together at the bottom to form a diamond shape.

=== Mitigation ===

Languages have different ways of dealing with these problems of repeated inheritance.

* C# (since C# 8.0) allows default interface method implementation, causing a class codice_13, implementing interfaces codice_14 and codice_15 with similar methods having default implementations, to have two &quot;inherited&quot; methods with the same signature, causing the diamond problem. It is mitigated either by requiring codice_13 to implement the method itself, hence removing ambiguity, or forcing the caller to first cast the codice_13 object to the appropriate interface to use its default implementation of that method (e.g. codice_18).
* C++ by default follows each inheritance path separately, so a codice_19 object would actually contain two separate codice_13 objects, and uses of codice_13&#x27;s members have to be properly qualified. If the inheritance from codice_13 to codice_23 and the inheritance from codice_13 to codice_25 are both marked &quot;codice_26&quot; (for example, &quot;codice_27&quot;), C++ takes special care to only create one codice_13 object, and uses of codice_13&#x27;s members work correctly. If virtual inheritance and nonvirtual inheritance are mixed, there is a single virtual codice_13, and a nonvirtual codice_13 for each nonvirtual inheritance path to codice_13. C++ requires stating explicitly which parent class the feature to be used is invoked from i.e. codice_33. C++ does not support explicit repeated inheritance since there would be no way to qualify which superclass to use (i.e. having a class appear more than once in a single derivation list [class Dog : public Animal, Animal]). C++ also allows a single instance of the multiple class to be created via the virtual inheritance mechanism (i.e. codice_34 and codice_35 will reference the same object).
* Common Lisp CLOS attempts to provide both reasonable default behavior and the ability to override it. By default, to put it simply, the methods are sorted in codice_36, when B is written before C in the class definition. The method with the most specific argument classes is chosen (D&gt;(B,C)&gt;A) ; then in the order in which parent classes are named in the subclass definition (B&gt;C). However, the programmer can override this, by giving a specific method resolution order or stating a rule for combining methods. This is called method combination, which may be fully controlled. The MOP (metaobject protocol) also provides means to modify the inheritance, dynamic dispatch, class instantiation, and other internal mechanisms without affecting the stability of the system.
* Curl allows only classes that are explicitly marked as &quot;shared&quot; to be inherited repeatedly. Shared classes must define a &quot;secondary constructor&quot; for each regular constructor in the class. The regular constructor is called the first time the state for the shared class is initialized through a subclass constructor, and the secondary constructor will be invoked for all other subclasses.
* In Eiffel, the ancestors&#x27; features are chosen explicitly with select and rename directives. This allows the features of the base class to be shared between its descendants or to give each of them a separate copy of the base class. Eiffel allows explicit joining or separation of features inherited from ancestor classes. Eiffel will automatically join features together, if they have the same name and implementation. The class writer has the option to rename the inherited features to separate them. Multiple inheritance is a frequent occurrence in Eiffel development; most of the effective classes in the widely used EiffelBase library of data structures and algorithms, for example, have two or more parents.
* Go prevents the diamond problem at compile time. If a structure codice_19 embeds two structures codice_23 and codice_25 which both have a method codice_40, thus satisfying an interface codice_13, the compiler will complain about an &quot;ambiguous selector&quot; if codice_42 is called, or if an instance of codice_19 is assigned to a variable of type codice_13. codice_23 and codice_25&#x27;s methods can be called explicitly with codice_47 or codice_48.
* Java 8 introduces default methods on interfaces. If codice_49 are interfaces, codice_50 can each provide a different implementation to an abstract method of codice_13, causing the diamond problem. Either class codice_19 must reimplement the method (the body of which can simply forward the call to one of the super implementations), or the ambiguity will be rejected as a compile error. Prior to Java 8, Java was not subject to the Diamond problem risk, because it did not support multiple inheritance and interface default methods were not available.
* JavaFX Script in version 1.2 allows multiple inheritance through the use of mixins. In case of conflict, the compiler prohibits the direct usage of the ambiguous variable or function. Each inherited member can still be accessed by casting the object to the mixin of interest, e.g. codice_53.
* Kotlin allows multiple inheritance of Interfaces, however, in a Diamond problem scenario, the child class must override the method that causes the inheritance conflict and specify which parent class implementation should be used. eg codice_54
* Logtalk supports both interface and implementation multi-inheritance, allowing the declaration of method &quot;aliases&quot; that provide both renaming and access to methods that would be masked out by the default conflict resolution mechanism.
* In OCaml, parent classes are specified individually in the body of the class definition. Methods (and attributes) are inherited in the same order, with each newly inherited method overriding any existing methods. OCaml chooses the last matching definition of a class inheritance list to resolve which method implementation to use under ambiguities. To override the default behavior, one simply qualifies a method call with the desired class definition.
* Perl uses the list of classes to inherit from as an ordered list. The compiler uses the first method it finds by depth-first searching of the superclass list or using the C3 linearization of the class hierarchy. Various extensions provide alternative class composition schemes. The order of inheritance affects the class semantics. In the above ambiguity, class codice_23 and its ancestors would be checked before class codice_25 and its ancestors, so the method in codice_13 would be inherited through codice_23. This is shared with Io and Picolisp. In Perl, this behavior can be overridden using the codice_59 or other modules to use C3 linearization or other algorithms.
* Python has the same structure as Perl, but, unlike Perl, includes it in the syntax of the language. The order of inheritance affects the class semantics. Python had to deal with this upon the introduction of new-style classes, all of which have a common ancestor, codice_60. Python creates a list of classes using the C3 linearization (or Method Resolution Order (MRO)) algorithm. That algorithm enforces two constraints: children precede their parents and if a class inherits from multiple classes, they are kept in the order specified in the tuple of base classes (however in this case, some classes high in the inheritance graph may precede classes lower in the graph). Thus, the method resolution order is: codice_19, codice_23, codice_25, codice_13.
* Ruby classes have exactly one parent but may also inherit from multiple &quot;modules;&quot; ruby class definitions are executed, and the (re)definition of a method obscures any previously existing definition at the time of execution. In the absence of runtime metaprogramming this has approximately the same semantics as rightmost depth first resolution.
* Scala allows multiple instantiation of &quot;traits&quot;, which allows for multiple inheritance by adding a distinction between the class hierarchy and the trait hierarchy. A class can only inherit from a single class, but can mix-in as many traits as desired. Scala resolves method names using a right-first depth-first search of extended &#x27;traits&#x27;, before eliminating all but the last occurrence of each module in the resulting list. So, the resolution order is: [codice_19, codice_25, codice_13, codice_23, codice_13], which reduces down to [codice_19, codice_25, codice_23, codice_13].
* Tcl allows multiple parent classes; the order of specification in the class declaration affects the name resolution for members using the C3 linearization algorithm.

Languages that allow only single inheritance, where a class can only derive from one base class, do not have the diamond problem. The reason for this is that such languages have at most one implementation of any method at any level in the inheritance chain regardless of the repetition or placement of methods. Typically these languages allow classes to implement multiple protocols, called interfaces in Java. These protocols define methods but do not provide concrete implementations. This strategy has been used by ActionScript, C#, D, Java, Nemerle, Object Pascal, Objective-C, Smalltalk, Swift and PHP. All these languages allow classes to implement multiple protocols.

Moreover, Ada, C#, Java, Object Pascal, Objective-C, Swift and PHP allow multiple-inheritance of interfaces (called protocols in Objective-C and Swift). Interfaces are like abstract base classes that specify method signatures without implementing any behaviour. (&quot;Pure&quot; interfaces such as the ones in Java up to version 7 do not permit any implementation or instance data in the interface.) Nevertheless, even when several interfaces declare the same method signature, as soon as that method is implemented (defined) anywhere in the inheritance chain, it overrides any implementation of that method in the chain above it (in its superclasses). Hence, at any given level in the inheritance chain, there can be at most one implementation of any method. Thus, single-inheritance method implementation does not exhibit the Diamond Problem even with multiple-inheritance of interfaces. With the introduction of default implementation for interfaces in Java 8 and C# 8, it is still possible to generate a Diamond Problem, although this will only appear as a compile-time error.

<text>Media studies is a discipline and field of study that deals with the content, history, and effects of various media; in particular, the mass media. Media studies may draw on traditions from both the social sciences and the humanities, but it mostly draws from its core disciplines of mass communication, communication, communication sciences, and communication studies.

Researchers may also develop and employ theories and methods from disciplines including cultural studies, rhetoric (including digital rhetoric), philosophy, literary theory, psychology, political science, political economy, economics, sociology, anthropology, social theory, art history and criticism, film theory, and information theory.

== Origin ==

Former priest and American educator John Culkin was one of the earliest advocates for the implementation of media studies curriculum in schools. He believed students should be capable of scrutinizing mass media, and valued the application of modern communication techniques within the education system. In 1975, Culkin introduced the first media studies M.A. program in the U.S, which has since graduated more than 2,000 students.
Culkin was also responsible for bringing his colleague and fellow media scholar Marshall McLuhan to Fordham University, and subsequently founding the Center for Understanding Media, which became the New School program. Both educators are recognized as pioneers in the discipline, credited with paving the way for media studies curriculum within the education system. 

== Global contributions and perspectives on media studies ==

=== Canada ===
In his book &quot;Understanding Media, The Extensions of Man&quot;, media theorist Marshall McLuhan suggested that &quot;the medium is the message&quot;, and that all human artefacts and technologies are media. His book introduced the usage of terms such as &quot;media&quot; into our language along with other precepts, among them &quot;global village&quot; and &quot;Age of Information&quot;. A medium is anything that mediates our interaction with the world or other humans. Given this perspective, media study is not restricted to just media of communications but all forms of technology. Media and their users form an ecosystem, and the study of this ecosystem is known as media ecology. Media ecology also holds that our environment ultimately changes due to technology. Griffin, Ledbetter, and Sparks elaborate on this theory in their book, stating “...adding smartphones to a family doesn&#x27;t create a &#x27;family plus smartphones.&#x27; The technology changes the family into something different than what it was before.” 

McLuhan says that the &quot;technique of fragmentation that is the essence of machine technology&quot; shaped the restructuring of human work and association and &quot;the essence of automation technology is the opposite&quot;. He uses an example of the electric light to make this connection and to explain how &quot;the medium is the message&quot;. The electric light is pure information and it is a medium without a message, unless it is used to spell out some verbal ad or a name. The characteristic of all media means the &quot;content&quot; of any medium is always another medium. For example, the content of writing is speech, the written word is the content of print, and print is the content of the telegraph. The change that the medium or technology introduces into human affairs is the &quot;message&quot;. If the electric light is used for a Friday night football game or to light up a desk, it could be argued that the content of the electric light is these activities. The fact that it is the medium that shapes and controls the form of human association and action makes it the message. The electric light is overlooked as a communication medium because it does not have any content. It is not until the electric light is used to spell a brand name that it is recognized as medium. Similar to radio and other mass media, electric light eliminates time and space factors in human association, creating deeper involvement. McLuhan compared the &quot;content&quot; to a juicy piece of meat being carried by a burglar to distract the &quot;watchdog of the mind&quot;. The effect of the medium is made strong because it is given another media &quot;content&quot;. The content of a movie is a book, play, or maybe even an opera.

McLuhan talks about media being &quot;hot&quot; or &quot;cold&quot; and touches on the principle that distinguishes them from one another. A hot medium (i.e., radio or a movie) extends a single sense in &quot;high definition&quot;. High definition refers to the state of being well filled with data. A cool medium (i.e., a telephone or television) is considered &quot;low definition&quot; because a small amount of data/information is given and has to be filled in. Hot media are low in participation, because they give one most of the information while excluding certain information. Meanwhile, cool media are high in participation, because inclusively provides information but relies on the viewer to fill in the blanks. McLuhan used lecturing as an example for hot media and seminars as an example for low media. Using a hot medium in a hot or cool culture makes a difference.

In his book, &quot;Empire and Communications&quot;, University of Toronto professor Harold Innis highlighted media technologies as a powerful contributor to the rise and collapse of empires. Innis’ theory of media bias utilizes historical evidence to argue that a medium will be biased towards either time or space. He claims that this inherent bias will reveal a medium’s significance to the development of its civilization. Innis identifies media biased towards time as a medium durable in character like clay, stone, or parchment. Time biased media are heavy and difficult to relocate, which keeps their message centralized and thus maintains economic and social control within the hands of a hierarchical authority structure. He defines media in favor of space as a lighter, more transferable medium like papyrus. Opposite to media in favor of time, Innis explains that the transferable quality of media biased towards space permits civilizations to expand more quickly across vast areas, thus benefiting the growth of sectors like trade. Space biased media influences an empire to decentralize its power and widen its reach of influence. Though these biases are in competition with each other, Innis argued that an empire requires the presence of both time and space biased media to succeed as a lasting civilization.

=== France ===
One prominent French media critic is the sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, who wrote books like &quot;On Television&quot; (New Press, 1999). Bourdieu asserts that television provides far less autonomy (or freedom) than we think. From his perspective, the market (which creates a hunt for higher advertising revenue) not only imposes uniformity and banality, but also necessitates a form of invisible censorship. For example, television producers often &quot;pre-interview&quot; participants in news and public affairs programs to ensure that they will speak in simple, attention-grabbing terms. When the search for viewers leads to an emphasis on the sensational and the spectacular, people with complex or nuanced views are not allowed a hearing.

Bourdieu is also remembered in the discipline for his theory of the habitus. In his written work &quot;Outline of a Theory of Practice&quot; (Bourdieu, 1977), Bourdieu claims an audience&#x27;s preference in media is shaped by their social context. How an individual interprets and engages with their surroundings, or their habitus, is defined by the lasting and transferable elements of character which structure their consumer preferences. Bourdieu explains that, though durable, the habitus is not set in stone; it instead acts as a “strategy-generating principle” allowing individuals to navigate new and unfamiliar situations.

Bourdieu expanded on the theory of the habitus, introducing his famous term, cultural capital. According to the French sociologist, cultural capital signifies an individual’s socially or culturally valuable skills and knowledge. He claims that these competencies are developed through one’s upbringing and access to education resources, and can be unconsciously shaped by their social environment. Bourdieu highlights this accumulation of competencies as a determining factor in one’s life chances. One’s cultural capital, such as a university degree, can lead them to be offered more opportunities, thus linking the concept to both economic and social capital. Bourdieu explains that it is through the content of the different capitals that the habitus will structure an individual&#x27;s consumer taste.

=== Germany ===
In Germany, two main branches of media theory or media studies can be identified.

The first major branch of media theory has its roots in the humanities and cultural studies, such as film studies (&quot;Filmwissenschaft&quot;), theater studies (&quot;Theaterwissenschaft&quot;), German language and literature studies (&quot;Germanistik&quot;), and Comparative Literature Studies (&quot;Komparatistik&quot;). This branch has broadened out substantially since the 1990s, causing a culturally-based media studies (often emphasized more recently through the disciplinary title &quot;Medienkulturwissenschaft&quot;) in Germany to be developed and established.

This plurality of perspectives make it difficult to single out one particular site where the branch of Medienwissenschaft originated. While the Frankfurt-based theatre scholar Hans-Theis Lehmanns&#x27; term &quot;post dramatic theater&quot; points directly to the increased blending of co-presence and mediatized material in the German theater (and elsewhere) since the 1970s, the field of theater studies from the 1990s onwards at the Freie Universität Berlin, led in particular by Erika Fischer-Lichte, showed particular interest in the ways in which theatricality influenced notions of performativity in aesthetic events. Within the field of Film Studies, again, both Frankfurt and Berlin were dominant in the development of new perspectives on moving image media. Heide Schlüpman in Frankfurt and , first in Bochum then in Berlin, were key theorists contributing to an aesthetic theory of the cinema (Schlüpmann) as &quot;dispositif&quot; and the moving image as a medium, particularly in the context of illusion (Koch). Many scholars who became known as media scholars in Germany were originally scholars of German, such as Friedrich Kittler, who taught at the Humboldt Universität zu Berlin and completed both his dissertation and habilitation in the context of &quot;Germanistik&quot;. One of the early publications in this branch of media studies was a volume edited by Helmut Kreuzer entitled &quot;Literature Studies - Media Studies&quot; (&quot;Literaturwissenschaft – Medienwissenschaft&quot;), which summarizes the presentations given at the Düsseldorfer Germanistentag in 1976.

The second branch of media studies in Germany is comparable to Communication Studies. Pioneered by Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann in the 1940s, this branch studies mass media, its institutions, and its effects on society and individuals. The German Institute for Media and Communication Policy, founded in 2005 by media scholar Lutz Hachmeister, is one of the few independent research institutions that is dedicated to issues surrounding media and communications policies.

The term &quot;Wissenschaft&quot; cannot be directly translated to &quot;studies&quot;, as it invokes both scientific methods and the humanities. Accordingly, German media theory combines philosophy, psychoanalysis, history, and scientific studies with media-specific research.

=== Poland ===
According to the Zeszyty Prasoznawcze, translated to Press Journals in English, one of the &quot;architects&quot; of media studies in Poland is Professor Walery Pisarek. Pisarek spent over 40 years of his career studying how topics such as persuasion, language, and propaganda intersect with media studies and linguistics, specifically in Poland. This focus on linguistics also led to Pisarek&#x27;s support of the Polish Language Act, a piece of legislation that protected the Polish language and its use while also promoting the Polish culture and history.

=== United Kingdom ===
Much research in the field of news media studies has been led by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism. Details of the research projects and results are published in the RISJ annual report. In addition to the research performed at the Reuters Institute, media researchers in the United Kingdom have also used comments from the British press to look at their impression of media studies as a topic for study. Researchers Lucy Bennett and Jenny Kidd found that there was a link between the Conservative party in Britain and the idea that media studies was not an academic field worth studying due to its lack of scientific principles and employability for students.

Stuart Hall, a Jamaican-born social scientist, also contributed to the field of media studies through his writings on cultural studies, separate but similar to media studies. Hall&#x27;s main viewpoint was that the mainstream media as a whole served the beliefs of the rich and powerful within society, an idea that was heavily influenced by Karl Marx and Antonio Gramsci in his writings. By naming his theory &quot;cultural studies&quot;, Hall was able to bring in the cultural element of media studies that he felt was often left out by academics in the field.

=== United States ===
Despite the field normally being called mass communication in American circles, many theories within the realm of media studies have evolved from the United States. Elihu Katz’s uses and gratifications theory examines why individuals choose to take in media. At its core, the uses and gratifications theory explores how there is no single reason why people consume the messages that they do. Instead, one person consumes specific media for different reasons than another person may consume the same media. Some possible gratifications include “companionship”, “escape”, and “information”.

A newer theory from the 2010s comes from danah boyd and Alice Marwick when they studied how media eliminates borders between contexts. In their joint article, they refer to this as part of a process called ‘context collapse’. Context collapse refers to how a media platform can flatten multiple audiences into one and allow information intended for one audience to reach another unintended audience. An individual may present themselves to multiple audiences in various ways, but through context collapse, they are put in front of every audience at the same time and must choose which identity to assume.

In the United States, there is a rise in research surrounding social media and its use as a media form for communication. As the amount of social media research is on the rise, many researchers are calling on social media corporations to release data about their services to the general public.

== Media studies in education ==

=== Australia ===
Media is studied as a broad subject in most states in Australia. Media studies in Australia was first developed as an area of study in Victorian universities in the early 1960s, and in secondary schools in the mid 1960s.

Today, almost all Australian universities teach media studies. According to the Government of Australia&#x27;s &quot;Excellence in Research for Australia&quot; report, the leading universities in the country for media studies (which were ranked well above world standards by the report&#x27;s scoring methodology) are Monash University, QUT, RMIT, University of Melbourne, University of Queensland, and UTS.

In secondary schools, an early film studies course was first introduced as a part of the Victorian junior secondary curriculum during the mid 1960s. By the early 1970s, an expanded media studies course was being taught. The course became part of the senior secondary curriculum (later known as the Victorian Certificate of Education or &quot;VCE&quot;) in the 1980s. It has since become, and continues to be, a strong component of the VCE. Notable figures in the development of the Victorian secondary school curriculum were the long time Rusden College media teacher Peter Greenaway, Trevor Barr (who authored one of the first media text books &quot;Reflections of Reality&quot;) and later John Murray (who authored &quot;The Box in the Corner&quot;, &quot;In Focus&quot;, and &quot;10 Lessons in Film Appreciation&quot;).

Today, Australian states and territories that teach media studies at a secondary level are Australian Capital Territory, Northern Territory, Queensland, South Australia, Victoria, and Western Australia. Media studies does not appear to be taught in the state of New South Wales at a secondary level.

In Victoria, the VCE media studies course is structured as: Unit 1 – Representation, Technologies of Representation, and New Media; Unit 2 – Media Production, Australian Media Organisations; Unit 3 – Narrative Texts, Production Planning; and Unit 4 – Media Process, Social Values, and Media Influence. Media studies also forms a major part of the primary and junior secondary curriculum, and includes areas such as photography, print media, and television.

Victoria also hosts the peak media teaching body known as ATOM which publishes &quot;Metro&quot; and &quot;Screen Education&quot; magazines.

=== Canada ===
In Canada, media studies and communication studies are incorporated in the same departments and cover a wide range of approaches (from critical theory and organizations to research-creation and political economy, for example). Over time, research developed to employ theories and methods from cultural studies, philosophy, political economy, gender, sexuality and race theory, management, rhetoric, film theory, sociology, and anthropology. Harold Innis and Marshall McLuhan are famous Canadian scholars for their contributions to the fields of media ecology and political economy in the 20th century. They were both important members of the Toronto School of Communication at the time. More recently, the School of Montreal and its founder James R. Taylor significantly contributed to the field of organizational communication by focusing on the ontological processes of organizations.

In 1945 and 1946, Carleton University and the University of Western Ontario (respectively) created journalism specific programs or schools. A journalism specific program was also created at Ryerson in 1950. The first communication programs in Canada were started at Ryerson and Concordia Universities. The Radio and Television Arts program at Ryerson was started in the 1950s, while the Film, Media Studies/Media Arts, and Photography programs also originated from programs started in the 1950s. The Communication studies department at Concordia was created in the late 1960s. Ryerson&#x27;s Radio and Television, Film, Media and Photography programs were renowned by the mid 1970s, and its programs were being copied by other colleges and universities nationally and internationally. Western University later followed suit, establishing The Faculty of Information and Media Studies. Carleton later expanded upon its school of journalism, introducing the mass communication and media studies program in 1978.

Today, most universities offer undergraduate degrees in Media and Communication Studies, and many Canadian scholars actively contribute to the field, among which: Brian Massumi (philosophy, cultural studies), Kim Sawchuk (cultural studies, feminist, ageing studies), Carrie Rentschler (feminist theory), and François Cooren (organizational communication).

=== China ===
There are two universities in China that specialize in media studies. Communication University of China, formerly known as the Beijing Broadcasting Institute, dates back to 1954 and includes media studies. CUC has 15,307 full-time students, including 9,264 undergraduates, 3,512 candidates for doctor and master&#x27;s degrees, and 16,780 students in programs of continuing education. The other university known for media studies in China is Zhejiang University of Media and Communications (ZUMC) which has campuses in Hangzhou and Tongxiang. Almost 10,000 full-time students are currently studying in over 50 programs at the 13 Colleges and Schools of ZUMC. Both institutions have produced some of China&#x27;s brightest broadcasting talents for television, as well as leading journalists at magazines and newspapers.

=== Czech Republic ===
There is no university focused on journalism and media studies, but there are seven public universities which have a department of media studies. The three biggest universities are based in Prague (Charles University), Brno (Masaryk University) and Olomouc (Palacký University). There are another nine private universities and colleges that have a media studies department.

=== France ===
Numerous French post-secondary institutions offer courses in communications and media studies at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Media and communications programs at ESCP Business School, Paris Institute of Political Studies, and Grenoble Alpes University center around the study of journalism and other multimedia content, teaching media creation and management strategies.

=== Germany ===
&quot;Medienwissenschaften&quot; is currently one of the most popular courses of study at universities in Germany, with many applicants mistakenly assuming that studying it will automatically lead to a career in TV or other media. This has led to widespread disillusionment, with students blaming the universities for offering highly theoretical course content. The universities maintain that practical journalistic training is not the aim of the academic studies they offer.

=== India ===
Media Studies is a fast growing academic field in India, with several dedicated departments and research institutes. With a view to making the best use of communication facilities for information, publicity, and development, the Government of India in 1962-63 sought the advice of the Ford Foundation/UNESCO team of internationally known mass communication specialists who recommended setting up a national institute for training, teaching, and research in mass communication. Anna University was the first university to start a Master of Science in Electronic Media program. It offers a five-year integrated program and a two-year program in Electronic Media. The Department of Media Sciences was started in January 2002, branching off from the UGC&#x27;s Educational Multimedia Research Centre (EMMRC). The National Institute of Open Schooling, the world&#x27;s largest open schooling system, offers Mass Communication as a subject of studies at senior secondary level. All the major universities in the country have mass media and journalism studies departments, including Asian College of Journalism, Chennai, Indian Institute of Mass Communication, New Delhi, Xavier Institute of Communications, Mumbai, Parul University, Vadodara, Amity University, Jawaharlal Neheru University, Apeejay Institute of Mass Communications, Brainware University Kolkata, and others. Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), Delhi has media studies as an emphasis.

=== Netherlands ===
In the Netherlands, media studies is split into several academic courses, such as (applied) communication sciences, communication and information sciences, communication and media, media and culture or theater, and film and television sciences. While communication sciences focuses on the way people communicate, be it mediated or unmediated, media studies tends to narrow the communication down to just mediated communication.

Communication sciences (or a derivative thereof) can be studied at Erasmus University Rotterdam, Radboud University, Tilburg University, University of Amsterdam, University of Groningen, University of Twente, Roosevelt Academy, University of Utrecht, VU University Amsterdam, and Wageningen University and Research Centre.

Media studies (or something similar) can be studied at the University of Amsterdam, VU University Amsterdam, Erasmus University Rotterdam, University of Groningen, University of Maastricht, and the University of Utrecht.

Nine Dutch universities collaborate in the overarching Netherlands Research school for Media Studies (RMeS), which acts as a platform for graduate students to build connections within the media studies discipline and to represent Dutch media scholars on an international level.

=== New Zealand ===
Media studies in New Zealand is a healthy discipline, mainly due to renewed activity in the country&#x27;s film industry, and is taught at both secondary and tertiary education institutes. Media studies in NZ can be regarded as a singular success, with the subject well-established in the tertiary sector (such as Screen and Media Studies at the University of Waikato; Media Studies, Victoria University of Wellington; Film, Television and Media Studies, University of Auckland; Media Studies, Massey University; Communication Studies, University of Otago).

Different courses can offer students a range of specializations, such as cultural studies, media theory and analysis, practical film-making, journalism, and communications studies. Media studies has been a nationally mandated and very popular subject in secondary (high) schools, taught across three years in a very structured and developmental fashion, with Scholarship in Media Studies available for academically gifted students. According to the New Zealand Ministry of Education Subject Enrollment figures, 229 New Zealand schools offered Media Studies as a subject in 2016, representing more than 14,000 students.

=== Pakistan ===
In Pakistan, media studies programs are widely offered. International Islamic University has the oldest department in the country, now called the &quot;Department of Media and Communication Studies&quot;. Later on, the University of Karachi and the Federal Urdu University of Arts, Science, and Technology established departments of mass communication in 2002. Peshawar University, BZU Multaan, Islamia University Bahwalpur also started communication programs. Now, newly established universities are also offering mass communication programs, in which University of Gujrat emerged as a leading figure. Bahria University, which was established by the Pakistan Navy, is also offering a BS in media studies.

=== Switzerland ===
In Switzerland, media and communication studies are offered by several higher education institutions, including the International Institute in Geneva, Zurich University of Applied Sciences, University of Lugano, University of Fribourg, and others. The Swiss programs study current trends and strategies used by media corporations, while examining their influence and consequences on modern day society.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the United Kingdom, media studies developed in the 1960s from the academic study of English and, more broadly, from literary criticism. The key date, according to Andrew Crisell, is 1959:

When Joseph Trenaman left the BBC&#x27;s Further Education Unit to become the first holder of the Granada Research Fellowship in Television at Leeds University. Soon after in 1966, the Centre for Mass Communication Research was founded at Leicester University, and degree programs in media studies began to sprout at polytechnics and other universities during the 1970s and 1980s.

James Halloran at the University of Leicester is credited for his influence in the development of media studies and communication studies, as the head of the university&#x27;s Centre for Mass Communication Research and founder of the International Association for Media and Communication Research. Media Studies is now taught all over the UK. It is taught at Key Stages 1– 3, Entry Level, GCSE and at A level; the Scottish Qualifications Authority also offers formal qualifications at a number of different levels. It is offered through a large area of exam boards, including AQA and WJEC.

As mentioned earlier, much research in the field of news media studies has been led by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, which is one of the leaders in news media research for the United Kingdom. The Institute focuses on journalism and news media as topics of study.

=== United States ===
Mass communication, communication studies or simply &#x27;communication&#x27; are names that are used far more frequently than “media studies” for academic departments in the United States. However, the focus of such programs sometimes excludes certain media—film, book publishing, video games, etc. The title “media studies” may be used to designate film studies and rhetorical or critical theory, or it may appear in combinations like “media studies and communication” to join two fields or emphasize a different focus. It involves the study of many emerging contemporary media and platforms, with social media growing in popularity in recent years. Broadcast and cable television is no longer the primary form of entertainment, with various screens offering worldwide events and pastimes around the clock. Many institutions within the United States have since changed and revised their media studies programs.

In 1999, the MIT Comparative Media Studies program started under the leadership of Henry Jenkins. The program has since grown to include a graduate program; it is MIT&#x27;s largest humanities major, and, following a 2012 merger with the Writing and Humanistic Studies program, now has a roster of twenty faculty, including Pulitzer Prize-winning author Junot Díaz, science fiction writer Joe Haldeman, games scholar T. L. Taylor, and media scholars William Uricchio (a CMS co-founder), Edward Schiappa, and Heather Hendershot. Now named Comparative Media Studies/Writing, the department places an emphasis on what Jenkins and colleagues have termed &quot;applied humanities&quot;: it hosts several research groups for civic media, digital humanities, games, computational media, documentary, and mobile design, and these groups are used to provide graduate students with research assistantships to cover the cost of tuition and living expenses. The incorporation of Writing and Humanistic Studies also placed MIT&#x27;s Science Writing program, Writing Across the Curriculum, and Writing and Communications Center under the same roof.

In 2000, the Department of Media Studies was officially established in 2000 at the University of Virginia; the interdisciplinary major has rapidly grown and doubled in size in 2011. This is partly thanks to the acquisition of Professor Siva Vaidhyanathan, a cultural historian and media scholar, as well as the Inaugural Verklin Media Policy and Ethics Conference, endowed by the CEO of Canoe Ventures and UVA alumnus David Verklin.

University of California, Irvine had professor Mark Poster, who was one of the first and foremost theorists of media culture in the US and boasted a strong Department of Film &amp; Media Studies. University of California, Berkeley has three institutional structures within media studies that take place in the department of Film and Media (formerly Film Studies Program), including famous theorists as Mary Ann Doane and Linda Williams, the Center for New Media, and a long established interdisciplinary program formerly titled Mass Communications, which recently changed its name to Media Studies. This change eliminated any connotations that may have accompanied the term “mass” in the former title. Until recently, Radford University in Virginia used the title &quot;media studies&quot; for a department that taught practitioner-oriented major concentrations in journalism, advertising, broadcast production, and web design. In 2008, those programs were combined with a previous department of communication (speech and public relations) to create a School of Communication. (A media studies major at Radford still means someone concentrating on journalism, broadcasting, advertising or Web production.)

Brooklyn College has collaborated with City University of New York to offer graduate studies in television and media since 2015. Currently, the Department of Television and Radio administers an MS in Media Studies, and hosts the Center for the Study of World Television.

<text>A microprocessor is a computer processor for which the data processing logic and control is included on a single integrated circuit (IC), or a small number of ICs. The microprocessor contains the arithmetic, logic, and control circuitry required to perform the functions of a computer&#x27;s central processing unit (CPU). The IC is capable of interpreting and executing program instructions and performing arithmetic operations. The microprocessor is a multipurpose, clock-driven, register-based, digital integrated circuit that accepts binary data as input, processes it according to instructions stored in its memory, and provides results (also in binary form) as output. Microprocessors contain both combinational logic and sequential digital logic, and operate on numbers and symbols represented in the binary number system.

The integration of a whole CPU onto a single or a few integrated circuits using Very-Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) greatly reduced the cost of processing power. Integrated circuit processors are produced in large numbers by highly automated metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) fabrication processes, resulting in a relatively low unit price. Single-chip processors increase reliability because there are fewer electrical connections that can fail. As microprocessor designs improve, the cost of manufacturing a chip (with smaller components built on a semiconductor chip the same size) generally stays the same according to Rock&#x27;s law.

Before microprocessors, small computers had been built using racks of circuit boards with many medium- and small-scale integrated circuits, typically of TTL type. Microprocessors combined this into one or a few large-scale ICs. While there is disagreement over who deserves credit for the invention of the microprocessor, the first commercially available microprocessor was the Intel 4004, designed by Federico Faggin and introduced in 1971.

Continued increases in microprocessor capacity have since rendered other forms of computers almost completely obsolete (see history of computing hardware), with one or more microprocessors used in everything from the smallest embedded systems and handheld devices to the largest mainframes and supercomputers.

A microprocessor is distinct from a microcontroller including a system on a chip. A microprocessor is related but distinct from a digital signal processor, a specialized microprocessor chip, with its architecture optimized for the operational needs of digital signal processing.

==Structure==
The complexity of an integrated circuit is bounded by physical limitations on the number of transistors that can be put onto one chip, the number of package terminations that can connect the processor to other parts of the system, the number of interconnections it is possible to make on the chip, and the heat that the chip can dissipate. Advancing technology makes more complex and powerful chips feasible to manufacture.

A minimal hypothetical microprocessor might include only an arithmetic logic unit (ALU), and a control logic section. The ALU performs addition, subtraction, and operations such as AND or OR. Each operation of the ALU sets one or more flags in a status register, which indicate the results of the last operation (zero value, negative number, overflow, or others). The control logic retrieves instruction codes from memory and initiates the sequence of operations required for the ALU to carry out the instruction. A single operation code might affect many individual data paths, registers, and other elements of the processor.

As integrated circuit technology advanced, it was feasible to manufacture more and more complex processors on a single chip. The size of data objects became larger; allowing more transistors on a chip allowed word sizes to increase from 4- and 8-bit words up to today&#x27;s 64-bit words. Additional features were added to the processor architecture; more on-chip registers sped up programs, and complex instructions could be used to make more compact programs. Floating-point arithmetic, for example, was often not available on 8-bit microprocessors, but had to be carried out in software. Integration of the floating-point unit, first as a separate integrated circuit and then as part of the same microprocessor chip, sped up floating-point calculations.

Occasionally, physical limitations of integrated circuits made such practices as a bit slice approach necessary. Instead of processing all of a long word on one integrated circuit, multiple circuits in parallel processed subsets of each word. While this required extra logic to handle, for example, carry and overflow within each slice, the result was a system that could handle, for example, 32-bit words using integrated circuits with a capacity for only four bits each.

The ability to put large numbers of transistors on one chip makes it feasible to integrate memory on the same die as the processor. This CPU cache has the advantage of faster access than off-chip memory and increases the processing speed of the system for many applications. Processor clock frequency has increased more rapidly than external memory speed, so cache memory is necessary if the processor is not to be delayed by slower external memory.

The design of some processors has become complicated enough to be difficult to fully test, and this has caused problems at large cloud providers.

===Special-purpose designs===
A microprocessor is a general purpose processing entity. Several specialized processing devices have followed:

* A digital signal processor (DSP) is specialized for signal processing.
* Graphics processing units (GPUs) are processors designed primarily for real-time rendering of images.
* Other specialized units exist for video processing and machine vision. (See: Hardware acceleration.)
* Microcontrollers in embedded systems and peripheral devices. 
* Systems on chip (SoCs) often integrate one or more microprocessor and microcontroller cores with other components such as radio modems, and are used in smartphones and tablet computers.

===Speed and power considerations===

Microprocessors can be selected for differing applications based on their word size, which is a measure of their complexity. Longer word sizes allow each clock cycle of a processor to carry out more computation, but correspond to physically larger integrated circuit dies with higher standby and operating power consumption. 4-, 8- or 12-bit processors are widely integrated into microcontrollers operating embedded systems. Where a system is expected to handle larger volumes of data or require a more flexible user interface, 16-, 32- or 64-bit processors are used. An 8- or 16-bit processor may be selected over a 32-bit processor for system on a chip or microcontroller applications that require extremely low-power electronics, or are part of a mixed-signal integrated circuit with noise-sensitive on-chip analog electronics such as high-resolution analog to digital converters, or both.
Some people say that running 32-bit arithmetic on an 8-bit chip could end up using more power, as the chip must execute software with multiple instructions.
However, others say that modern 8-bit chips are always more power-efficient than 32-bit chips when running equivalent software routines.

==Embedded applications==
Thousands of items that were traditionally not computer-related include microprocessors. These include household appliances, vehicles (and their accessories), tools and test instruments, toys, light switches/dimmers and electrical circuit breakers, smoke alarms, battery packs, and hi-fi audio/visual components (from DVD players to phonograph turntables). Such products as cellular telephones, DVD video system and HDTV broadcast systems fundamentally require consumer devices with powerful, low-cost, microprocessors. Increasingly stringent pollution control standards effectively require automobile manufacturers to use microprocessor engine management systems to allow optimal control of emissions over the widely varying operating conditions of an automobile. Non-programmable controls would require bulky, or costly implementation to achieve the results possible with a microprocessor.

A microprocessor control program (embedded software) can be tailored to fit the needs of a product line, allowing upgrades in performance with minimal redesign of the product. Unique features can be implemented in product line&#x27;s various models at negligible production cost.

Microprocessor control of a system can provide control strategies that would be impractical to implement using electromechanical controls or purpose-built electronic controls. For example, an internal combustion engine&#x27;s control system can adjust ignition timing based on engine speed, load, temperature, and any observed tendency for knocking—allowing the engine to operate on a range of fuel grades.

==History==

The advent of low-cost computers on integrated circuits has transformed modern society. General-purpose microprocessors in personal computers are used for computation, text editing, multimedia display, and communication over the Internet. Many more microprocessors are part of embedded systems, providing digital control over myriad objects from appliances to automobiles to cellular phones and industrial process control. Microprocessors perform binary operations based on Boolean logic, named after George Boole. The ability to operate computer systems using Boolean Logic was first proven in a 1938 thesis by master&#x27;s student Claude Shannon, who later went on to become a professor. Shannon is considered &quot;The Father of Information Theory&quot;. In 1951 Microprogramming was invented by Maurice Wilkes at the  University of Cambridge, UK, from the realisation that the central processor could be controlled by a specialised program in a dedicated ROM. Wilkes is also credited with the idea of symbolic labels, macros and subroutine libraries. 

Following the development of MOS integrated circuit chips in the early 1960s, MOS chips reached higher transistor density and lower manufacturing costs than bipolar integrated circuits by 1964. MOS chips further increased in complexity at a rate predicted by Moore&#x27;s law, leading to large-scale integration (LSI) with hundreds of transistors on a single MOS chip by the late 1960s. The application of MOS LSI chips to computing was the basis for the first microprocessors, as engineers began recognizing that a complete computer processor could be contained on several MOS LSI chips. Designers in the late 1960s were striving to integrate the central processing unit (CPU) functions of a computer onto a handful of MOS LSI chips, called microprocessor unit (MPU) chipsets.

While there is disagreement over who invented the microprocessor, the first commercially available microprocessor was the Intel 4004, released as a single MOS LSI chip in 1971. The single-chip microprocessor was made possible with the development of MOS silicon-gate technology (SGT). The earliest MOS transistors had aluminium metal gates, which Italian physicist Federico Faggin replaced with silicon self-aligned gates to develop the first silicon-gate MOS chip at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1968. Faggin later joined Intel and used his silicon-gate MOS technology to develop the 4004, along with Marcian Hoff, Stanley Mazor and Masatoshi Shima in 1971. The 4004 was designed for Busicom, which had earlier proposed a multi-chip design in 1969, before Faggin&#x27;s team at Intel changed it into a new single-chip design. The 4-bit Intel 4004 was soon followed by the 8-bit Intel 8008 in 1972. The MP944 chipset used in the F-14 Central Air Data Computer in 1970 has also been cited as an early microprocessor, but was not known to the public until declassified in 1998.

Other embedded uses of 4-bit and 8-bit microprocessors, such as terminals, printers, various kinds of automation etc., followed soon after. Affordable 8-bit microprocessors with 16-bit addressing also led to the first general-purpose microcomputers from the mid-1970s on.

The first use of the term &quot;microprocessor&quot; is attributed to Viatron Computer Systems describing the custom integrated circuit used in their System 21 small computer system announced in 1968.

Since the early 1970s, the increase in capacity of microprocessors has followed Moore&#x27;s law; this originally suggested that the number of components that can be fitted onto a chip doubles every year. With present technology, it is actually every two years, and as a result Moore later changed the period to two years.

===First projects===
These projects delivered a microprocessor at about the same time: Garrett AiResearch&#x27;s Central Air Data Computer (CADC) (1970), Texas Instruments&#x27; TMS 1802NC (September 1971) and Intel&#x27;s 4004 (November 1971, based on an earlier 1969 Busicom design). Arguably, Four-Phase Systems AL1 microprocessor was also delivered in 1969.

====Four-Phase Systems AL1 (1969)====
The Four-Phase Systems AL1 was an 8-bit bit slice chip containing eight registers and an ALU. It was designed by Lee Boysel in 1969. At the time, it formed part of a nine-chip, 24-bit CPU with three AL1s. It was later called a microprocessor when, in response to 1990s litigation by Texas Instruments, Boysel constructed a demonstration system where a single AL1 with a 1969 datestamp formed part of a courtroom demonstration computer system, together with RAM, ROM, and an input-output device. The AL1 wasn&#x27;t sold individually, but was part of the System IV/70 announced in September 1970 and first delivered in February 1972.

====Garrett AiResearch CADC (1970)====

In 1968, Garrett AiResearch (who employed designers Ray Holt and Steve Geller) was invited to produce a digital computer to compete with electromechanical systems then under development for the main flight control computer in the US Navy&#x27;s new F-14 Tomcat fighter. The design was complete by 1970, and used a MOS-based chipset as the core CPU. The design was significantly (approximately 20 times) smaller and much more reliable than the mechanical systems it competed against and was used in all of the early Tomcat models. This system contained &quot;a 20-bit, pipelined, parallel multi-microprocessor&quot;. The Navy refused to allow publication of the design until 1997. Released in 1998, the documentation on the CADC, and the MP944 chipset, are well known. Ray Holt&#x27;s autobiographical story of this design and development is presented in the book: The Accidental Engineer.
Ray Holt graduated from California State Polytechnic University, Pomona in 1968, and began his computer design career with the CADC. From its inception, it was shrouded in secrecy until 1998 when at Holt&#x27;s request, the US Navy allowed the documents into the public domain. Holt has claimed that no one has compared this microprocessor with those that came later. According to Parab et al. (2007), This convergence of DSP and microcontroller architectures is known as a digital signal controller.

====Gilbert Hyatt (1970) ====
In 1990, American engineer Gilbert Hyatt was awarded U.S. Patent No. 4,942,516, which was based on a 16-bit serial computer he built at his Northridge, California, home in 1969 from boards of bipolar chips after quitting his job at Teledyne in 1968; though the patent had been submitted in December 1970 and prior to Texas Instruments&#x27; filings for the TMX 1795 and TMS 0100, Hyatt&#x27;s invention was never manufactured. This nonetheless led to claims that Hyatt was the inventor of the microprocessor and the payment of substantial royalties through a Philips N.V. subsidiary, until Texas Instruments prevailed in a complex legal battle in 1996, when the U.S. Patent Office overturned key parts of the patent, while allowing Hyatt to keep it. Hyatt said in a 1990 &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; article that his invention would have been created had his prospective investors backed him, and that the venture investors leaked details of his chip to the industry, though he did not elaborate with evidence to support this claim. In the same article, &quot;The Chip&quot; author T.R. Reid was quoted as saying that historians may ultimately place Hyatt as a co-inventor of the microprocessor, in the way that Intel&#x27;s Noyce and TI&#x27;s Kilby share credit for the invention of the chip in 1958: &quot;Kilby got the idea first, but Noyce made it practical. The legal ruling finally favored Noyce, but they are considered co-inventors. The same could happen here.&quot; Hyatt would go on to fight a decades-long legal battle with the state of California over alleged unpaid taxes on his patent&#x27;s windfall after 1990, which would culminate in a landmark Supreme Court case addressing states&#x27; sovereign immunity in &quot;Franchise Tax Board of California v. Hyatt (2019)&quot;.

====Texas Instruments TMX 1795 (1970–1971)====
Texas Instruments developed in 1970–1971 a one-chip CPU replacement for the Datapoint 2200 terminal, the TMX 1795 (later TMC 1795). Like Intel&#x27;s later 8008, it was rejected by customer Datapoint. According to Gary Boone, the TMX 1795 never reached production. Still it reached a prototype state at 1971 February 24. Since it was built to the same specification, its instruction set was very similar to the Intel 8008.

====Texas Instruments TMS 1802NC (1971)====
The TMS1802NC, announced September 17, 1971, was the first microcontroller and at launch implemented a four-function calculator. The TMS1802NC, despite its designation, was not part of the TMS 1000 series; it was later redesignated as part of the TMS 0100 series, which was used in the TI Datamath calculator. It was marketed as a calculator-on-a-chip and also &quot;fully programmable&quot;, but this programming had to done during manufacturing. Its chip integrated a CPU with an 11-bit instruction word, 3520 bits (320 instructions) of ROM and 182 bits of RAM.

====Pico/General Instrument (1971)====
In 1971, Pico Electronics and General Instrument (GI) introduced their first collaboration in ICs, a complete single-chip calculator IC for the Monroe/Litton Royal Digital III calculator. This chip could also arguably lay claim to be one of the first microprocessors or microcontrollers having ROM, RAM and a RISC instruction set on-chip. The layout for the four layers of the PMOS process was hand drawn at x500 scale on mylar film, a significant task at the time given the complexity of the chip.

Pico was a spinout by five GI design engineers whose vision was to create single-chip calculator ICs. They had significant previous design experience on multiple calculator chipsets with both GI and Marconi-Elliott. The key team members had originally been tasked by Elliott Automation to create an 8-bit computer in MOS and had helped establish a MOS Research Laboratory in Glenrothes, Scotland in 1967.

Calculators were becoming the largest single market for semiconductors so Pico and GI went on to have significant success in this burgeoning market. GI continued to innovate in microprocessors and microcontrollers with products including the CP1600, IOB1680 and PIC1650. In 1987, the GI Microelectronics business was spun out into the Microchip PIC microcontroller business.

====Intel 4004 (1971) ====

The Intel 4004 is often (falsely) regarded as the first true microprocessor built on a single chip, priced at . The first known advertisement for the 4004 is dated November 15, 1971, and appeared in &quot;Electronic News&quot;. The microprocessor was designed by a team consisting of Italian engineer Federico Faggin, American engineers Marcian Hoff and Stanley Mazor, and Japanese engineer Masatoshi Shima.

The project that produced the 4004 originated in 1969, when Busicom, a Japanese calculator manufacturer, asked Intel to build a chipset for high-performance desktop calculators. Busicom&#x27;s original design called for a programmable chip set consisting of seven different chips. Three of the chips were to make a special-purpose CPU with its program stored in ROM and its data stored in shift register read-write memory. Ted Hoff, the Intel engineer assigned to evaluate the project, believed the Busicom design could be simplified by using dynamic RAM storage for data, rather than shift register memory, and a more traditional general-purpose CPU architecture. Hoff came up with a four-chip architectural proposal: a ROM chip for storing the programs, a dynamic RAM chip for storing data, a simple I/O device, and a 4-bit central processing unit (CPU). Although not a chip designer, he felt the CPU could be integrated into a single chip, but as he lacked the technical know-how the idea remained just a wish for the time being.

While the architecture and specifications of the MCS-4 came from the interaction of Hoff with Stanley Mazor, a software engineer reporting to him, and with Busicom engineer Masatoshi Shima, during 1969, Mazor and Hoff moved on to other projects. In April 1970, Intel hired Italian engineer Federico Faggin as project leader, a move that ultimately made the single-chip CPU final design a reality (Shima meanwhile designed the Busicom calculator firmware and assisted Faggin during the first six months of the implementation). Faggin, who originally developed the silicon gate technology (SGT) in 1968 at Fairchild Semiconductor and designed the world&#x27;s first commercial integrated circuit using SGT, the Fairchild 3708, had the correct background to lead the project into what would become the first commercial general purpose microprocessor. Since SGT was his very own invention, Faggin also used it to create his new methodology for random logic design that made it possible to implement a single-chip CPU with the proper speed, power dissipation and cost. The manager of Intel&#x27;s MOS Design Department was Leslie L. Vadász at the time of the MCS-4 development but Vadász&#x27;s attention was completely focused on the mainstream business of semiconductor memories so he left the leadership and the management of the MCS-4 project to Faggin, who was ultimately responsible for leading the 4004 project to its realization. Production units of the 4004 were first delivered to Busicom in March 1971 and shipped to other customers in late 1971.

===8-bit designs===
The Intel 4004 was followed in 1972 by the Intel 8008, intel&#x27;s first 8-bit microprocessor. The 8008 was not, however, an extension of the 4004 design, but instead the culmination of a separate design project at Intel, arising from a contract with Computer Terminals Corporation, of San Antonio TX, for a chip for a terminal they were designing, the Datapoint 2200—fundamental aspects of the design came not from Intel but from CTC. In 1968, CTC&#x27;s Vic Poor and Harry Pyle developed the original design for the instruction set and operation of the processor. In 1969, CTC contracted two companies, Intel and Texas Instruments, to make a single-chip implementation, known as the CTC 1201. In late 1970 or early 1971, TI dropped out being unable to make a reliable part. In 1970, with Intel yet to deliver the part, CTC opted to use their own implementation in the Datapoint 2200, using traditional TTL logic instead (thus the first machine to run &quot;8008 code&quot; was not in fact a microprocessor at all and was delivered a year earlier). Intel&#x27;s version of the 1201 microprocessor arrived in late 1971, but was too late, slow, and required a number of additional support chips. CTC had no interest in using it. CTC had originally contracted Intel for the chip, and would have owed them for their design work. To avoid paying for a chip they did not want (and could not use), CTC released Intel from their contract and allowed them free use of the design. Intel marketed it as the 8008 in April, 1972, as the world&#x27;s first 8-bit microprocessor. It was the basis for the famous &quot;Mark-8&quot; computer kit advertised in the magazine &quot;Radio-Electronics&quot; in 1974. This processor had an 8-bit data bus and a 14-bit address bus.

The 8008 was the precursor to the successful Intel 8080 (1974), which offered improved performance over the 8008 and required fewer support chips. Federico Faggin conceived and designed it using high voltage N channel MOS. The Zilog Z80 (1976) was also a Faggin design, using low voltage N channel with depletion load and derivative Intel 8-bit processors: all designed with the methodology Faggin created for the 4004. Motorola released the competing 6800 in August 1974, and the similar MOS Technology 6502 was released in 1975 (both designed largely by the same people). The 6502 family rivaled the Z80 in popularity during the 1980s.

A low overall cost, little packaging, simple computer bus requirements, and sometimes the integration of extra circuitry (e.g. the Z80&#x27;s built-in memory refresh circuitry) allowed the home computer &quot;revolution&quot; to accelerate sharply in the early 1980s. This delivered such inexpensive machines as the Sinclair ZX81, which sold for . A variation of the 6502, the MOS Technology 6510 was used in the Commodore 64 and yet another variant, the 8502, powered the Commodore 128.

The Western Design Center, Inc (WDC) introduced the CMOS WDC 65C02 in 1982 and licensed the design to several firms. It was used as the CPU in the Apple IIe and IIc personal computers as well as in medical implantable grade pacemakers and defibrillators, automotive, industrial and consumer devices. WDC pioneered the licensing of microprocessor designs, later followed by ARM (32-bit) and other microprocessor intellectual property (IP) providers in the 1990s.

Motorola introduced the MC6809 in 1978. It was an ambitious and well thought-through 8-bit design that was source compatible with the 6800, and implemented using purely hard-wired logic (subsequent 16-bit microprocessors typically used microcode to some extent, as CISC design requirements were becoming too complex for pure hard-wired logic).

Another early 8-bit microprocessor was the Signetics 2650, which enjoyed a brief surge of interest due to its innovative and powerful instruction set architecture.

A seminal microprocessor in the world of spaceflight was RCA&#x27;s RCA 1802 (aka CDP1802, RCA COSMAC) (introduced in 1976), which was used on board the &quot;Galileo&quot; probe to Jupiter (launched 1989, arrived 1995). RCA COSMAC was the first to implement CMOS technology. The CDP1802 was used because it could be run at very low power, and because a variant was available fabricated using a special production process, silicon on sapphire (SOS), which provided much better protection against cosmic radiation and electrostatic discharge than that of any other processor of the era. Thus, the SOS version of the 1802 was said to be the first radiation-hardened microprocessor.

The RCA 1802 had a static design, meaning that the clock frequency could be made arbitrarily low, or even stopped. This let the &quot;Galileo&quot; spacecraft use minimum electric power for long uneventful stretches of a voyage. Timers or sensors would awaken the processor in time for important tasks, such as navigation updates, attitude control, data acquisition, and radio communication. Current versions of the Western Design Center 65C02 and 65C816 also have static cores, and thus retain data even when the clock is completely halted.

===12-bit designs===
The Intersil 6100 family consisted of a 12-bit microprocessor (the 6100) and a range of peripheral support and memory ICs. The microprocessor recognised the DEC PDP-8 minicomputer instruction set. As such it was sometimes referred to as the CMOS-PDP8. Since it was also produced by Harris Corporation, it was also known as the Harris HM-6100. By virtue of its CMOS technology and associated benefits, the 6100 was being incorporated into some military designs until the early 1980s.

===16-bit designs===

The first multi-chip 16-bit microprocessor was the National Semiconductor IMP-16, introduced in early 1973. An 8-bit version of the chipset was introduced in 1974 as the IMP-8.

Other early multi-chip 16-bit microprocessors include the MCP-1600 that Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) used in the LSI-11 OEM board set and the packaged PDP-11/03 minicomputer—and the Fairchild Semiconductor MicroFlame 9440, both introduced in 1975–76. In late 1974, National introduced the first 16-bit single-chip microprocessor, the National Semiconductor PACE, which was later followed by an NMOS version, the INS8900.

Next in list is the General Instrument CP1600, released in February 1975, which was used mainly in the Intellivision console.

Another early single-chip 16-bit microprocessor was TI&#x27;s TMS 9900, which was also compatible with their TI-990 line of minicomputers. The 9900 was used in the TI 990/4 minicomputer, the TI-99/4A home computer, and the TM990 line of OEM microcomputer boards. The chip was packaged in a large ceramic 64-pin DIP package, while most 8-bit microprocessors such as the Intel 8080 used the more common, smaller, and less expensive plastic 40-pin DIP. A follow-on chip, the TMS 9980, was designed to compete with the Intel 8080, had the full TI 990 16-bit instruction set, used a plastic 40-pin package, moved data 8 bits at a time, but could only address 16 KB. A third chip, the TMS 9995, was a new design. The family later expanded to include the 99105 and 99110.

The Western Design Center (WDC) introduced the CMOS 65816 16-bit upgrade of the WDC CMOS 65C02 in 1984. The 65816 16-bit microprocessor was the core of the Apple IIGS and later the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, making it one of the most popular 16-bit designs of all time.

Intel &quot;upsized&quot; their 8080 design into the 16-bit Intel 8086, the first member of the x86 family, which powers most modern PC type computers. Intel introduced the 8086 as a cost-effective way of porting software from the 8080 lines, and succeeded in winning much business on that premise. The 8088, a version of the 8086 that used an 8-bit external data bus, was the microprocessor in the first IBM PC. Intel then released the 80186 and 80188, the 80286 and, in 1985, the 32-bit 80386, cementing their PC market dominance with the processor family&#x27;s backwards compatibility. The 80186 and 80188 were essentially versions of the 8086 and 8088, enhanced with some onboard peripherals and a few new instructions. Although Intel&#x27;s 80186 and 80188 were not used in IBM PC type designs, second source versions from NEC, the V20 and V30 frequently were. The 8086 and successors had an innovative but limited method of memory segmentation, while the 80286 introduced a full-featured segmented memory management unit (MMU). The 80386 introduced a flat 32-bit memory model with paged memory management.

The 16-bit Intel x86 processors up to and including the 80386 do not include floating-point units (FPUs). Intel introduced the 8087, 80187, 80287 and 80387 math coprocessors to add hardware floating-point and transcendental function capabilities to the 8086 through 80386 CPUs. The 8087 works with the 8086/8088 and 80186/80188, the 80187 works with the 80186 but not the 80188, the 80287 works with the 80286 and the 80387 works with the 80386. The combination of an x86 CPU and an x87 coprocessor forms a single multi-chip microprocessor; the two chips are programmed as a unit using a single integrated instruction set. The 8087 and 80187 coprocessors are connected in parallel with the data and address buses of their parent processor and directly execute instructions intended for them. The 80287 and 80387 coprocessors are interfaced to the CPU through I/O ports in the CPU&#x27;s address space, this is transparent to the program, which does not need to know about or access these I/O ports directly; the program accesses the coprocessor and its registers through normal instruction opcodes.

===32-bit designs===
16-bit designs had only been on the market briefly when 32-bit implementations started to appear.

The most significant of the 32-bit designs is the Motorola MC68000, introduced in 1979. The 68k, as it was widely known, had 32-bit registers in its programming model but used 16-bit internal data paths, three 16-bit Arithmetic Logic Units, and a 16-bit external data bus (to reduce pin count), and externally supported only 24-bit addresses (internally it worked with full 32 bit addresses). In PC-based IBM-compatible mainframes the MC68000 internal microcode was modified to emulate the 32-bit System/370 IBM mainframe. Motorola generally described it as a 16-bit processor. The combination of high performance, large (16 megabytes or 224 bytes) memory space and fairly low cost made it the most popular CPU design of its class. The Apple Lisa and Macintosh designs made use of the 68000, as did other designs in the mid-1980s, including the Atari ST and Amiga.

The world&#x27;s first single-chip fully 32-bit microprocessor, with 32-bit data paths, 32-bit buses, and 32-bit addresses, was the AT&amp;T Bell Labs BELLMAC-32A, with first samples in 1980, and general production in 1982. After the divestiture of AT&amp;T in 1984, it was renamed the WE 32000 (WE for Western Electric), and had two follow-on generations, the WE 32100 and WE 32200. These microprocessors were used in the AT&amp;T 3B5 and 3B15 minicomputers; in the 3B2, the world&#x27;s first desktop super microcomputer; in the &quot;Companion&quot;, the world&#x27;s first 32-bit laptop computer; and in &quot;Alexander&quot;, the world&#x27;s first book-sized super microcomputer, featuring ROM-pack memory cartridges similar to today&#x27;s gaming consoles. All these systems ran the UNIX System V operating system.

The first commercial, single chip, fully 32-bit microprocessor available on the market was the HP FOCUS.

Intel&#x27;s first 32-bit microprocessor was the iAPX 432, which was introduced in 1981, but was not a commercial success. It had an advanced capability-based object-oriented architecture, but poor performance compared to contemporary architectures such as Intel&#x27;s own 80286 (introduced 1982), which was almost four times as fast on typical benchmark tests. However, the results for the iAPX432 was partly due to a rushed and therefore suboptimal Ada compiler.

Motorola&#x27;s success with the 68000 led to the MC68010, which added virtual memory support. The MC68020, introduced in 1984 added full 32-bit data and address buses. The 68020 became hugely popular in the Unix supermicrocomputer market, and many small companies (e.g., Altos, Charles River Data Systems, Cromemco) produced desktop-size systems. The MC68030 was introduced next, improving upon the previous design by integrating the MMU into the chip. The continued success led to the MC68040, which included an FPU for better math performance. The 68050 failed to achieve its performance goals and was not released, and the follow-up MC68060 was released into a market saturated by much faster RISC designs. The 68k family faded from use in the early 1990s.

Other large companies designed the 68020 and follow-ons into embedded equipment. At one point, there were more 68020s in embedded equipment than there were Intel Pentiums in PCs. The ColdFire processor cores are derivatives of the 68020.

During this time (early to mid-1980s), National Semiconductor introduced a very similar 16-bit pinout, 32-bit internal microprocessor called the NS 16032 (later renamed 32016), the full 32-bit version named the NS 32032. Later, National Semiconductor produced the NS 32132, which allowed two CPUs to reside on the same memory bus with built in arbitration. The NS32016/32 outperformed the MC68000/10, but the NS32332—which arrived at approximately the same time as the MC68020—did not have enough performance. The third generation chip, the NS32532, was different. It had about double the performance of the MC68030, which was released around the same time. The appearance of RISC processors like the AM29000 and MC88000 (now both dead) influenced the architecture of the final core, the NS32764. Technically advanced—with a superscalar RISC core, 64-bit bus, and internally overclocked—it could still execute Series 32000 instructions through real-time translation.

When National Semiconductor decided to leave the Unix market, the chip was redesigned into the Swordfish Embedded processor with a set of on-chip peripherals. The chip turned out to be too expensive for the laser printer market and was killed. The design team went to Intel and there designed the Pentium processor, which is very similar to the NS32764 core internally. The big success of the Series 32000 was in the laser printer market, where the NS32CG16 with microcoded BitBlt instructions had very good price/performance and was adopted by large companies like Canon. By the mid-1980s, Sequent introduced the first SMP server-class computer using the NS 32032. This was one of the design&#x27;s few wins, and it disappeared in the late 1980s. The MIPS R2000 (1984) and R3000 (1989) were highly successful 32-bit RISC microprocessors. They were used in high-end workstations and servers by SGI, among others. Other designs included the Zilog Z80000, which arrived too late to market to stand a chance and disappeared quickly.

The ARM first appeared in 1985. This is a RISC processor design, which has since come to dominate the 32-bit embedded systems processor space due in large part to its power efficiency, its licensing model, and its wide selection of system development tools. Semiconductor manufacturers generally license cores and integrate them into their own system on a chip products; only a few such vendors such as Apple are licensed to modify the ARM cores or create their own. Most cell phones include an ARM processor, as do a wide variety of other products. There are microcontroller-oriented ARM cores without virtual memory support, as well as symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) applications processors with virtual memory.

From 1993 to 2003, the 32-bit x86 architectures became increasingly dominant in desktop, laptop, and server markets, and these microprocessors became faster and more capable. Intel had licensed early versions of the architecture to other companies, but declined to license the Pentium, so AMD and Cyrix built later versions of the architecture based on their own designs. During this span, these processors increased in complexity (transistor count) and capability (instructions/second) by at least three orders of magnitude. Intel&#x27;s Pentium line is probably the most famous and recognizable 32-bit processor model, at least with the public at broad.

===64-bit designs in personal computers===
While 64-bit microprocessor designs have been in use in several markets since the early 1990s (including the Nintendo 64 gaming console in 1996), the early 2000s saw the introduction of 64-bit microprocessors targeted at the PC market.

With AMD&#x27;s introduction of a 64-bit architecture backwards-compatible with x86, x86-64 (also called AMD64), in September 2003, followed by Intel&#x27;s near fully compatible 64-bit extensions (first called IA-32e or EM64T, later renamed Intel 64), the 64-bit desktop era began. Both versions can run 32-bit legacy applications without any performance penalty as well as new 64-bit software. With operating systems Windows XP x64, Windows Vista x64, Windows 7 x64, Linux, BSD, and macOS that run 64-bit natively, the software is also geared to fully utilize the capabilities of such processors. The move to 64 bits is more than just an increase in register size from the IA-32 as it also doubles the number of general-purpose registers.

The move to 64 bits by PowerPC had been intended since the architecture&#x27;s design in the early 90s and was not a major cause of incompatibility. Existing integer registers are extended as are all related data pathways, but, as was the case with IA-32, both floating-point and vector units had been operating at or above 64 bits for several years. Unlike what happened when IA-32 was extended to x86-64, no new general purpose registers were added in 64-bit PowerPC, so any performance gained when using the 64-bit mode for applications making no use of the larger address space is minimal.

In 2011, ARM introduced the new 64-bit ARM architecture.

===RISC===
In the mid-1980s to early 1990s, a crop of new high-performance reduced instruction set computer (RISC) microprocessors appeared, influenced by discrete RISC-like CPU designs such as the IBM 801 and others. RISC microprocessors were initially used in special-purpose machines and Unix workstations, but then gained wide acceptance in other roles.

The first commercial RISC microprocessor design was released in 1984, by MIPS Computer Systems, the 32-bit R2000 (the R1000 was not released). In 1986, HP released its first system with a PA-RISC CPU. In 1987, in the non-Unix Acorn computers&#x27; 32-bit, then cache-less, ARM2-based Acorn Archimedes became the first commercial success using the ARM architecture, then known as Acorn RISC Machine (ARM); first silicon ARM1 in 1985. The R3000 made the design truly practical, and the R4000 introduced the world&#x27;s first commercially available 64-bit RISC microprocessor. Competing projects would result in the IBM POWER and Sun SPARC architectures. Soon every major vendor was releasing a RISC design, including the AT&amp;T CRISP, AMD 29000, Intel i860 and Intel i960, Motorola 88000, DEC Alpha.

In the late 1990s, only two 64-bit RISC architectures were still produced in volume for non-embedded applications: SPARC and Power ISA, but as ARM has become increasingly powerful, in the early 2010s, it became the third RISC architecture in the general computing segment.

===SMP and multi-core design===
SMP &quot;symmetric multiprocessing&quot; is a configuration of two, four, or more CPU&#x27;s (in pairs) that are typically used in servers, certain workstations and in desktop personal computers, since the 1990s. A multi-core processor is a single CPU that contains more than one microprocessor core.

This popular two-socket motherboard from Abit was released in 1999 as the first SMP enabled PC motherboard, the Intel Pentium Pro was the first commercial CPU offered to system builders and enthusiasts. The Abit BP9 supports two Intel Celeron CPU&#x27;s and when used with a SMP enabled operating system (Windows NT/2000/Linux) many applications obtain much higher performance than a single CPU. The early Celerons are easily overclockable and hobbyists used these relatively inexpensive CPU&#x27;s clocked as high as 533Mhz - far beyond Intel&#x27;s specification. After discovering the capacity of these motherboards Intel removed access to the multiplier in later CPU&#x27;s.

In 2001 IBM released the POWER4 CPU, it was a processor that was developed over five years of research, began in 1996 using a team of 250 researchers. The effort to accomplish the impossible was buttressed by development of and through—remote-collaboration and assigning younger engineers to work with more experienced engineers. The teams work achieved success with the new microprocessor, Power4. It is a two-in-one CPU that more than doubled performance at half the price of the competition, and a major advance in computing. The business magazine &quot;eWeek&quot; wrote: &quot;The newly designed 1GHz Power4 represents a tremendous leap over its predecessor&quot;. An industry analyst, Brad Day of Giga Information Group said: &quot;&quot;IBM is getting very aggressive, and this server is a game changer&quot;.&quot;

The Power4 won &quot;&quot;Analysts’ Choice Award for Best Workstation/Server Processor of 2001&quot;, and&quot; it broke notable records, including winning a contest against the best players on the Jeopardy! U.S. television show.

Intel&#x27;s codename Yonah CPU&#x27;s launched on Jan 6, 2006, and were manufactured with two dies packaged on a multi-chip module. In a hotly-contested marketplace AMD and others released new versions of multi-core CPU&#x27;s, AMD&#x27;s SMP enabled Athlon MP CPU&#x27;s from the AthlonXP line in 2001, Sun released the Niagara and Niagara 2 with eight-cores, AMD&#x27;s Athlon X2 was released in June 2007. The companies were engaged in a never-ending race for speed, indeed more demanding software mandated more processing power and faster CPU speeds.

By 2012 &quot;dual and quad-core&quot; processors became widely used in PCs and laptops, newer processors - similar to the higher cost professional level Intel Xeon&#x27;s - with additional cores that execute instructions in parallel so software performance typically increases, provided the software is designed to utilize advanced hardware. Operating systems provided support for multiple-cores and SMD CPU&#x27;s, many software applications including large workload and resource intensive applications - such as 3-D games - are programmed to take advantage of multiple core and multi-CPU systems.

Apple, Intel, and AMD currently lead the market with multiple core desktop and workstation CPU&#x27;s. Although they frequently leapfrog each other for the lead in the performance tier. Intel retains higher frequencies and thus has the fastest single core performance, while AMD is often the leader in multi-threaded routines due to a more advanced ISA and the process node the CPU&#x27;s are fabricated on.

Multiprocessing concepts for multi-core/multi-cpu configurations are related to Amdahl&#x27;s law.

==Market statistics==
In 1997, about 55% of all CPUs sold in the world were 8-bit microcontrollers, of which over 2 billion were sold.

In 2002, less than 10% of all the CPUs sold in the world were 32-bit or more. Of all the 32-bit CPUs sold, about 2% are used in desktop or laptop personal computers. Most microprocessors are used in embedded control applications such as household appliances, automobiles, and computer peripherals. Taken as a whole, the average price for a microprocessor, microcontroller, or DSP is just over .

In 2003, about $44 billion (equivalent to about $ billion in ) worth of microprocessors were manufactured and sold. Although about half of that money was spent on CPUs used in desktop or laptop personal computers, those count for only about 2% of all CPUs sold. The quality-adjusted price of laptop microprocessors improved −25% to −35% per year in 2004–2010, and the rate of improvement slowed to −15% to −25% per year in 2010–2013.

About 10 billion CPUs were manufactured in 2008. Most new CPUs produced each year are embedded.

<text>A molecule is a group of two or more atoms that are held together by attractive forces known as chemical bonds; depending on context, the term may or may not include ions that satisfy this criterion. In quantum physics, organic chemistry, and biochemistry, the distinction from ions is dropped and &quot;molecule&quot; is often used when referring to polyatomic ions.

A molecule may be homonuclear, that is, it consists of atoms of one chemical element, e.g. two atoms in the oxygen molecule (O2); or it may be heteronuclear, a chemical compound composed of more than one element, e.g. water (two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom; H2O). In the kinetic theory of gases, the term &quot;molecule&quot; is often used for any gaseous particle regardless of its composition. This relaxes the requirement that a molecule contains two or more atoms, since the noble gases are individual atoms. Atoms and complexes connected by non-covalent interactions, such as hydrogen bonds or ionic bonds, are typically not considered single molecules.

Concepts similar to molecules have been discussed since ancient times, but modern investigation into the nature of molecules and their bonds began in the 17th century. Refined over time by scientists such as Robert Boyle, Amedeo Avogadro, Jean Perrin, and Linus Pauling, the study of molecules is today known as molecular physics or molecular chemistry.

== Etymology ==
According to Merriam-Webster and the Online Etymology Dictionary, the word &quot;molecule&quot; derives from the Latin &quot;moles&quot; or small unit of mass. The word is derived from French &#x27; (1678), from Neo-Latin &#x27;, diminutive of Latin &quot;&quot; &quot;mass, barrier&quot;. The word, which until the late 18th century was used only in Latin form, became popular after being used in works of philosophy by Descartes.

== History ==
The definition of the molecule has evolved as knowledge of the structure of molecules has increased. Earlier definitions were less precise, defining molecules as the smallest particles of pure chemical substances that still retain their composition and chemical properties. This definition often breaks down since many substances in ordinary experience, such as rocks, salts, and metals, are composed of large crystalline networks of chemically bonded atoms or ions, but are not made of discrete molecules.

The modern concept of molecules can be traced back towards pre-scientific and Greek philosophers such as Leucippus and Democritus who argued that all the universe is composed of atoms and voids. Circa 450 BC Empedocles imagined fundamental elements (fire (), earth (), air (), and water ()) and &quot;forces&quot; of attraction and repulsion allowing the elements to interact.

A fifth element, the incorruptible quintessence aether, was considered to be the fundamental building block of the heavenly bodies. The viewpoint of Leucippus and Empedocles, along with the aether, was accepted by Aristotle and passed to medieval and renaissance Europe.

In a more concrete manner, however, the concept of aggregates or units of bonded atoms, i.e. &quot;molecules&quot;, traces its origins to Robert Boyle&#x27;s 1661 hypothesis, in his famous treatise &quot;The Sceptical Chymist&quot;, that matter is composed of &quot;clusters of particles&quot; and that chemical change results from the rearrangement of the clusters. Boyle argued that matter&#x27;s basic elements consisted of various sorts and sizes of particles, called &quot;corpuscles&quot;, which were capable of arranging themselves into groups. In 1789, William Higgins published views on what he called combinations of &quot;ultimate&quot; particles, which foreshadowed the concept of valency bonds. If, for example, according to Higgins, the force between the ultimate particle of oxygen and the ultimate particle of nitrogen were 6, then the strength of the force would be divided accordingly, and similarly for the other combinations of ultimate particles.

Amedeo Avogadro created the word &quot;molecule&quot;. His 1811 paper &quot;Essay on Determining the Relative Masses of the Elementary Molecules of Bodies&quot;, he essentially states, i.e. according to Partington&#x27;s &quot;A Short History of Chemistry&quot;, that:In coordination with these concepts, in 1833 the French chemist Marc Antoine Auguste Gaudin presented a clear account of Avogadro&#x27;s hypothesis, regarding atomic weights, by making use of &quot;volume diagrams&quot;, which clearly show both semi-correct molecular geometries, such as a linear water molecule, and correct molecular formulas, such as H2O:

In 1917, an unknown American undergraduate chemical engineer named Linus Pauling was learning the Dalton hook-and-eye bonding method, which was the mainstream description of bonds between atoms at the time. Pauling, however, was not satisfied with this method and looked to the newly emerging field of quantum physics for a new method. In 1926, French physicist Jean Perrin received the Nobel Prize in physics for proving, conclusively, the existence of molecules. He did this by calculating the Avogadro constant using three different methods, all involving liquid phase systems. First, he used a gamboge soap-like emulsion, second by doing experimental work on Brownian motion, and third by confirming Einstein&#x27;s theory of particle rotation in the liquid phase.

In 1927, the physicists Fritz London and Walter Heitler applied the new quantum mechanics to the deal with the saturable, nondynamic forces of attraction and repulsion, i.e., exchange forces, of the hydrogen molecule. Their valence bond treatment of this problem, in their joint paper, was a landmark in that it brought chemistry under quantum mechanics. Their work was an influence on Pauling, who had just received his doctorate and visited Heitler and London in Zürich on a Guggenheim Fellowship.

Subsequently, in 1931, building on the work of Heitler and London and on theories found in Lewis&#x27; famous article, Pauling published his ground-breaking article &quot;The Nature of the Chemical Bond&quot; in which he used quantum mechanics to calculate properties and structures of molecules, such as angles between bonds and rotation about bonds. On these concepts, Pauling developed hybridization theory to account for bonds in molecules such as CH4, in which four sp³ hybridised orbitals are overlapped by hydrogen&#x27;s &quot;1s&quot; orbital, yielding four sigma (σ) bonds. The four bonds are of the same length and strength, which yields a molecular structure as shown below:
== Molecular science ==

The science of molecules is called &quot;molecular chemistry&quot; or &quot;molecular physics&quot;, depending on whether the focus is on chemistry or physics. Molecular chemistry deals with the laws governing the interaction between molecules that results in the formation and breakage of chemical bonds, while molecular physics deals with the laws governing their structure and properties. In practice, however, this distinction is vague. In molecular sciences, a molecule consists of a stable system (bound state) composed of two or more atoms. Polyatomic ions may sometimes be usefully thought of as electrically charged molecules. The term &quot;unstable molecule&quot; is used for very reactive species, i.e., short-lived assemblies (resonances) of electrons and nuclei, such as radicals, molecular ions, Rydberg molecules, transition states, van der Waals complexes, or systems of colliding atoms as in Bose–Einstein condensate.

== Prevalence ==

Molecules as components of matter are common. They also make up most of the oceans and atmosphere. Most organic substances are molecules. The substances of life are molecules, e.g. proteins, the amino acids of which they are composed, the nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), sugars, carbohydrates, fats, and vitamins. The nutrient minerals are generally ionic compounds, thus they are not molecules, e.g. iron sulfate.

However, the majority of familiar solid substances on Earth are made partly or completely of crystals or ionic compounds, which are not made of molecules. These include all of the minerals that make up the substance of the Earth, sand, clay, pebbles, rocks, boulders, bedrock, the molten interior, and the core of the Earth. All of these contain many chemical bonds, but are &quot;not&quot; made of identifiable molecules.

No typical molecule can be defined for salts nor for covalent crystals, although these are often composed of repeating unit cells that extend either in a plane, e.g. graphene; or three-dimensionally e.g. diamond, quartz, sodium chloride. The theme of repeated unit-cellular-structure also holds for most metals which are condensed phases with metallic bonding. Thus solid metals are not made of molecules. In glasses, which are solids that exist in a vitreous disordered state, the atoms are held together by chemical bonds with no presence of any definable molecule, nor any of the regularity of repeating unit-cellular-structure that characterizes salts, covalent crystals, and metals.

== Bonding ==
Molecules are generally held together by covalent bonding. Several non-metallic elements exist only as molecules in the environment either in compounds or as homonuclear molecules, not as free atoms: for example, hydrogen.

While some people say a metallic crystal can be considered a single giant molecule held together by metallic bonding, others point out that metals behave very differently than molecules.

=== Covalent ===
A covalent bond is a chemical bond that involves the sharing of electron pairs between atoms. These electron pairs are termed &quot;shared pairs&quot; or &quot;bonding pairs&quot;, and the stable balance of attractive and repulsive forces between atoms, when they share electrons, is termed &quot;covalent bonding&quot;.

=== Ionic ===

Ionic bonding is a type of chemical bond that involves the electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions, and is the primary interaction occurring in ionic compounds. The ions are atoms that have lost one or more electrons (termed cations) and atoms that have gained one or more electrons (termed anions). This transfer of electrons is termed &quot;electrovalence&quot; in contrast to covalence. In the simplest case, the cation is a metal atom and the anion is a nonmetal atom, but these ions can be of a more complicated nature, e.g. molecular ions like NH4+ or SO42−. At normal temperatures and pressures, ionic bonding mostly creates solids (or occasionally liquids) without separate identifiable molecules, but the vaporization/sublimation of such materials does produce separate molecules where electrons are still transferred fully enough for the bonds to be considered ionic rather than covalent.
== Molecular size ==

Most molecules are far too small to be seen with the naked eye, although molecules of many polymers can reach macroscopic sizes, including biopolymers such as DNA. Molecules commonly used as building blocks for organic synthesis have a dimension of a few angstroms (Å) to several dozen Å, or around one billionth of a meter. Single molecules cannot usually be observed by light (as noted above), but small molecules and even the outlines of individual atoms may be traced in some circumstances by use of an atomic force microscope. Some of the largest molecules are macromolecules or supermolecules.

The smallest molecule is the diatomic hydrogen (H2), with a bond length of 0.74 Å.

Effective molecular radius is the size a molecule displays in solution.
The table of permselectivity for different substances contains examples.

== Molecular formulas ==

=== Chemical formula types ===
The chemical formula for a molecule uses one line of chemical element symbols, numbers, and sometimes also other symbols, such as parentheses, dashes, brackets, and &quot;plus&quot; (+) and &quot;minus&quot; (−) signs. These are limited to one typographic line of symbols, which may include subscripts and superscripts.

A compound&#x27;s empirical formula is a very simple type of chemical formula. It is the simplest integer ratio of the chemical elements that constitute it. For example, water is always composed of a 2:1 ratio of hydrogen to oxygen atoms, and ethanol (ethyl alcohol) is always composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen in a 2:6:1 ratio. However, this does not determine the kind of molecule uniquely – dimethyl ether has the same ratios as ethanol, for instance. Molecules with the same atoms in different arrangements are called isomers. Also carbohydrates, for example, have the same ratio (carbon:hydrogen:oxygen= 1:2:1) (and thus the same empirical formula) but different total numbers of atoms in the molecule.

The molecular formula reflects the exact number of atoms that compose the molecule and so characterizes different molecules. However different isomers can have the same atomic composition while being different molecules.

The empirical formula is often the same as the molecular formula but not always. For example, the molecule acetylene has molecular formula C2H2, but the simplest integer ratio of elements is CH.

The molecular mass can be calculated from the chemical formula and is expressed in conventional atomic mass units equal to 1/12 of the mass of a neutral carbon-12 (12C isotope) atom. For network solids, the term formula unit is used in stoichiometric calculations.
=== Structural formula ===

For molecules with a complicated 3-dimensional structure, especially involving atoms bonded to four different substituents, a simple molecular formula or even semi-structural chemical formula may not be enough to completely specify the molecule. In this case, a graphical type of formula called a structural formula may be needed. Structural formulas may in turn be represented with a one-dimensional chemical name, but such chemical nomenclature requires many words and terms which are not part of chemical formulas.
== Molecular geometry ==


Molecules have fixed equilibrium geometries—bond lengths and angles— about which they continuously oscillate through vibrational and rotational motions. A pure substance is composed of molecules with the same average geometrical structure. The chemical formula and the structure of a molecule are the two important factors that determine its properties, particularly its reactivity. Isomers share a chemical formula but normally have very different properties because of their different structures. Stereoisomers, a particular type of isomer, may have very similar physico-chemical properties and at the same time different biochemical activities.

== Molecular spectroscopy ==


Molecular spectroscopy deals with the response (spectrum) of molecules interacting with probing signals of known energy (or frequency, according to the Planck relation). Molecules have quantized energy levels that can be analyzed by detecting the molecule&#x27;s energy exchange through absorbance or emission.
Spectroscopy does not generally refer to diffraction studies where particles such as neutrons, electrons, or high energy X-rays interact with a regular arrangement of molecules (as in a crystal).

Microwave spectroscopy commonly measures changes in the rotation of molecules, and can be used to identify molecules in outer space. Infrared spectroscopy measures the vibration of molecules, including stretching, bending or twisting motions. It is commonly used to identify the kinds of bonds or functional groups in molecules. Changes in the arrangements of electrons yield absorption or emission lines in ultraviolet, visible or near infrared light, and result in colour. Nuclear resonance spectroscopy measures the environment of particular nuclei in the molecule, and can be used to characterise the numbers of atoms in different positions in a molecule.

== Theoretical aspects ==

The study of molecules by molecular physics and theoretical chemistry is largely based on quantum mechanics and is essential for the understanding of the chemical bond. The simplest of molecules is the hydrogen molecule-ion, H2+, and the simplest of all the chemical bonds is the one-electron bond. H2+ is composed of two positively charged protons and one negatively charged electron, which means that the Schrödinger equation for the system can be solved more easily due to the lack of electron–electron repulsion. With the development of fast digital computers, approximate solutions for more complicated molecules became possible and are one of the main aspects of computational chemistry.

When trying to define rigorously whether an arrangement of atoms is &quot;sufficiently stable&quot; to be considered a molecule, IUPAC suggests that it &quot;must correspond to a depression on the potential energy surface that is deep enough to confine at least one vibrational state&quot;. This definition does not depend on the nature of the interaction between the atoms, but only on the strength of the interaction. In fact, it includes weakly bound species that would not traditionally be considered molecules, such as the helium dimer, He2, which has one vibrational bound state and is so loosely bound that it is only likely to be observed at very low temperatures.

Whether or not an arrangement of atoms is &quot;sufficiently stable&quot; to be considered a molecule is inherently an operational definition. Philosophically, therefore, a molecule is not a fundamental entity (in contrast, for instance, to an elementary particle); rather, the concept of a molecule is the chemist&#x27;s way of making a useful statement about the strengths of atomic-scale interactions in the world that we observe.

<text>In music theory, the term mode or modus is used in a number of distinct senses, depending on context.

Its most common use may be described as a type of musical scale coupled with a set of characteristic melodic and harmonic behaviors. It is applied to major and minor keys as well as the seven diatonic modes (including the former as Ionian and Aeolian) which are defined by their starting note or tonic. (Olivier Messiaen&#x27;s modes of limited transposition are strictly a scale type.) Related to the diatonic modes are the eight church modes or Gregorian modes, in which authentic and plagal forms of scales are distinguished by ambitus and tenor or reciting tone. Although both diatonic and Gregorian modes borrow terminology from ancient Greece, the Greek &quot;tonoi&quot; do not otherwise resemble their medieval/modern counterparts.

Previously, in the Middle Ages the term modus was used to describe intervals, individual notes, and rhythms (see ). Modal rhythm was an essential feature of the modal notation system of the Notre-Dame school at the turn of the 12th century. In the mensural notation that emerged later, modus specifies the subdivision of the &quot;longa&quot;.

Outside of Western classical music, &quot;mode&quot; is sometimes used to embrace similar concepts such as &quot;Octoechos&quot;, &quot;maqam&quot;, &quot;pathet&quot; etc. (see below).

== Mode as a general concept ==
Regarding the concept of mode as applied to pitch relationships generally, in 2001 Harold S. Powers proposed that &quot;mode&quot; has &quot;a twofold sense&quot;, denoting either a &quot;particularized scale&quot; or a &quot;generalized tune&quot;, or both: 

In 1792, Sir Willam Jones applied the term &quot;mode&quot; to the music of &quot;the Persians and the Hindoos&quot;. As early as 1271, Amerus applied the concept to &quot;cantilenis organicis&quot; (lit. &quot;organic songs&quot;, most probably meaning &quot;polyphony&quot;). It is still heavily used with regard to Western polyphony before the onset of the common practice period, as for example &quot;modale Mehrstimmigkeit&quot; by Carl Dahlhaus or &quot;Alte Tonarten&quot; of the 16th and 17th centuries found by Bernhard Meier.

The word encompasses several additional meanings. Authors from the 9th century until the early 18th century (e.g., Guido of Arezzo) sometimes employed the Latin &quot;modus&quot; for interval, or for qualities of individual notes. In the theory of late-medieval mensural polyphony (e.g., Franco of Cologne), &quot;modus&quot; is a rhythmic relationship between long and short values or a pattern made from them; in mensural music most often theorists applied it to division of longa into 3 or 2 breves.

==Modes and scales==
A musical scale is a series of pitches in a distinct order.

The concept of &quot;mode&quot; in Western music theory has three successive stages: in Gregorian chant theory, in Renaissance polyphonic theory, and in tonal harmonic music of the common practice period. In all three contexts, &quot;mode&quot; incorporates the idea of the diatonic scale, but differs from it by also involving an element of melody type. This concerns particular repertories of short musical figures or groups of tones within a certain scale so that, depending on the point of view, mode takes on the meaning of either a &quot;particularized scale&quot; or a &quot;generalized tune&quot;. Modern musicological practice has extended the concept of mode to earlier musical systems, such as those of Ancient Greek music, Jewish cantillation, and the Byzantine system of &quot;octoechoi&quot;, as well as to other non-Western types of music.

By the early 19th century, the word &quot;mode&quot; had taken on an additional meaning, in reference to the difference between major and minor keys, specified as &quot;major mode&quot; and &quot;minor mode&quot;. At the same time, composers were beginning to conceive &quot;modality&quot; as something outside of the major/minor system that could be used to evoke religious feelings or to suggest folk-music idioms.

==Greek modes==
Early Greek treatises describe three interrelated concepts that are related to the later, medieval idea of &quot;mode&quot;: (1) scales (or &quot;systems&quot;), (2) &quot;tonos&quot; – pl. &quot;tonoi&quot; – (the more usual term used in medieval theory for what later came to be called &quot;mode&quot;), and (3) &quot;harmonia&quot; (harmony) – pl. &quot;harmoniai&quot; – this third term subsuming the corresponding &quot;tonoi&quot; but not necessarily the converse.

===Greek scales===
The Greek scales in the Aristoxenian tradition were:

These names are derived from ancient Greeks&#x27; cultural subgroups (Dorians), small regions in central Greece (Locris), and certain Anatolian peoples (Lydia, Phrygia) (not ethnically Greek, but in close contact with them). The association of these ethnic names with the octave species appears to precede Aristoxenus, who criticized their application to the &quot;tonoi&quot; by the earlier theorists whom he called the &quot;Harmonicists&quot;. According to , he felt that their diagrams, which exhibit 28 consecutive dieses, were
: &quot;... devoid of any musical reality since more than two quarter-tones are never heard in succession.&quot;

Depending on the positioning (spacing) of the interposed tones in the tetrachords, three &quot;genera&quot; of the seven octave species can be recognized. The diatonic genus (composed of tones and semitones), the chromatic genus (semitones and a minor third), and the enharmonic genus (with a major third and two quarter tones or dieses). The framing interval of the perfect fourth is fixed, while the two internal pitches are movable. Within the basic forms, the intervals of the chromatic and diatonic genera were varied further by three and two &quot;shades&quot; (&quot;chroai&quot;), respectively.

In contrast to the medieval modal system, these scales and their related &quot;tonoi&quot; and &quot;harmoniai&quot; appear to have had no hierarchical relationships amongst the notes that could establish contrasting points of tension and rest, although the &quot;mese&quot; (&quot;middle note&quot;) might have functioned as some sort of central, returning tone for the melody.

===&quot;Tonoi&quot;===
The term &quot;tonos&quot; (pl. &quot;tonoi&quot;) was used in four senses:
: &quot;as note, interval, region of the voice, and pitch. We use it of the region of the voice whenever we speak of Dorian, or Phrygian, or Lydian, or any of the other tones&quot;.
Cleonides attributes thirteen &quot;tonoi&quot; to Aristoxenus, which represent a progressive transposition of the entire system (or scale) by semitone over the range of an octave between the Hypodorian and the Hypermixolydian. According to Cleonides, Aristoxenus&#x27;s transpositional &quot;tonoi&quot; were named analogously to the octave species, supplemented with new terms to raise the number of degrees from seven to thirteen. However, according to the interpretation of at least three modern authorities, in these transpositional &quot;tonoi&quot; the Hypodorian is the lowest, and the Mixolydian next-to-highest – the reverse of the case of the octave species, with nominal base pitches as follows (descending order):

Ptolemy, in his &quot;Harmonics&quot;, ii.3–11, construed the &quot;tonoi&quot; differently, presenting all seven octave species within a fixed octave, through chromatic inflection of the scale degrees (comparable to the modern conception of building all seven modal scales on a single tonic). In Ptolemy&#x27;s system, therefore there are only seven &quot;tonoi&quot;. Pythagoras also construed the intervals arithmetically (if somewhat more rigorously, initially allowing for 1:1 = Unison, 2:1 = Octave, 3:2 = Fifth, 4:3 = Fourth and 5:4 = Major Third within the octave). In their diatonic genus, these &quot;tonoi&quot; and corresponding &quot;harmoniai&quot; correspond with the intervals of the familiar modern major and minor scales. See Pythagorean tuning and Pythagorean interval.

===&quot;Harmoniai&quot;===

In music theory the Greek word &quot;harmonia&quot; can signify the enharmonic genus of tetrachord, the seven octave species, or a style of music associated with one of the ethnic types or the &quot;tonoi&quot; named by them.

Particularly in the earliest surviving writings, &quot;harmonia&quot; is regarded not as a scale, but as the epitome of the stylised singing of a particular district or people or occupation. When the late-6th-century poet Lasus of Hermione referred to the Aeolian &quot;harmonia&quot;, for example, he was more likely thinking of a melodic style characteristic of Greeks speaking the Aeolic dialect than of a scale pattern. By the late 5th century BC, these regional types are being described in terms of differences in what is called &quot;harmonia&quot; – a word with several senses, but here referring to the pattern of intervals between the notes sounded by the strings of a lyra or a kithara.

However, there is no reason to suppose that, at this time, these tuning patterns stood in any straightforward and organised relations to one another. It was only around the year 400 that attempts were made by a group of theorists known as the harmonicists to bring these &quot;harmoniai&quot; into a single system and to express them as orderly transformations of a single structure. Eratocles was the most prominent of the harmonicists, though his ideas are known only at second hand, through Aristoxenus, from whom we learn they represented the &quot;harmoniai&quot; as cyclic reorderings of a given series of intervals within the octave, producing seven octave species. We also learn that Eratocles confined his descriptions to the enharmonic genus.

=== Philosophical &quot;harmoniai&quot; in Plato and Aristotle===
In the &quot;Republic&quot;, Plato uses the term inclusively to encompass a particular type of scale, range and register, characteristic rhythmic pattern, textual subject, etc. Plato held that playing music in a particular &quot;harmonia&quot; would incline one towards specific behaviors associated with it, and suggested that soldiers should listen to music in Dorian or Phrygian &quot;harmoniai&quot; to help harden them but avoid music in Lydian, Mixolydian, or Ionian &quot;harmoniai&quot;, for fear of being softened. Plato believed that a change in the musical modes of the state would cause a wide-scale social revolution.

The philosophical writings of Plato and Aristotle () include sections that describe the effect of different &quot;harmoniai&quot; on mood and character formation. For example, Aristotle stated in his &quot;Politics&quot;:

Aristotle continues by describing the effects of rhythm, and concludes about the combined effect of rhythm and &quot;harmonia&quot; (viii:1340b:10–13): 

The word &quot;ethos&quot; () in this context means &quot;moral character&quot;, and Greek ethos theory concerns the ways that music can convey, foster, and even generate ethical states.

===&quot;Melos&quot;===
Some treatises also describe &quot;melic&quot; composition (), &quot;the employment of the materials subject to harmonic practice with due regard to the requirements of each of the subjects under consideration&quot; – which, together with the scales, &quot;tonoi&quot;, and &quot;harmoniai&quot; resemble elements found in medieval modal theory. According to Aristides Quintilianus, melic composition is subdivided into three classes: dithyrambic, nomic, and tragic. These parallel his three classes of rhythmic composition: systaltic, diastaltic and hesychastic. Each of these broad classes of melic composition may contain various subclasses, such as erotic, comic and panegyric, and any composition might be elevating (diastaltic), depressing (systaltic), or soothing (hesychastic).

According to Thomas J. Mathiesen, music as a performing art was called &quot;melos&quot;, which in its perfect form () comprised not only the melody and the text (including its elements of rhythm and diction) but also stylized dance movement. Melic and rhythmic composition (respectively, and ) were the processes of selecting and applying the various components of melos and rhythm to create a complete work. According to Aristides Quintilianus:
==Western Church==

Tonaries, lists of chant titles grouped by mode, appear in western sources around the turn of the 9th century. The influence of developments in Byzantium, from Jerusalem and Damascus, for instance the works of Saints John of Damascus (d. 749) and Cosmas of Maiouma, are still not fully understood. The eight-fold division of the Latin modal system, in a four-by-two matrix, was certainly of Eastern provenance, originating probably in Syria or even in Jerusalem, and was transmitted from Byzantine sources to Carolingian practice and theory during the 8th century. However, the earlier Greek model for the Carolingian system was probably ordered like the later Byzantine &quot;oktōēchos&quot;, that is, with the four principal (authentic) modes first, then the four plagals, whereas the Latin modes were always grouped the other way, with the authentics and plagals paired.

The 6th-century scholar Boethius had translated Greek music theory treatises by Nicomachus and Ptolemy into Latin. Later authors created confusion by applying mode as described by Boethius to explain plainchant modes, which were a wholly different system. In his &quot;De institutione musica&quot;, book 4 chapter 15, Boethius, like his Hellenistic sources, twice used the term &quot;harmonia&quot; to describe what would likely correspond to the later notion of &quot;mode&quot;, but also used the word &quot;modus&quot; – probably translating the Greek word τρόπος (&quot;tropos&quot;), which he also rendered as Latin &quot;tropus&quot; – in connection with the system of transpositions required to produce seven diatonic octave species, so the term was simply a means of describing transposition and had nothing to do with the church modes.

Later, 9th-century theorists applied Boethius&#x27;s terms &quot;tropus&quot; and &quot;modus&quot; (along with &quot;tonus&quot;) to the system of church modes. The treatise &quot;De Musica&quot; (or &quot;De harmonica institutione&quot;) of Hucbald synthesized the three previously disparate strands of modal theory: chant theory, the Byzantine &quot;oktōēchos&quot; and Boethius&#x27;s account of Hellenistic theory. The late-9th- and early 10th-century compilation known as the &quot;Alia musica&quot; imposed the seven octave transpositions, known as &quot;tropus&quot; and described by Boethius, onto the eight church modes, but its compilator also mentions the Greek (Byzantine) echoi translated by the Latin term &quot;sonus&quot;. Thus, the names of the modes became associated with the eight church tones and their modal formulas – but this medieval interpretation does not fit the concept of the ancient Greek harmonics treatises. The modern understanding of mode does not reflect that it is made of different concepts that do not all fit.
According to Carolingian theorists the eight church modes, or Gregorian modes, can be divided into four pairs, where each pair shares the &quot;final&quot; note and the four notes above the final, but they have different intervals concerning the species of the fifth. If the octave is completed by adding three notes above the fifth, the mode is termed &quot;authentic&quot;, but if the octave is completed by adding three notes below, it is called &quot;plagal&quot; (from Greek πλάγιος, &quot;oblique, sideways&quot;). Otherwise explained: if the melody moves mostly above the final, with an occasional cadence to the sub-final, the mode is authentic. Plagal modes shift range and also explore the fourth below the final as well as the fifth above. In both cases, the strict ambitus of the mode is one octave. A melody that remains confined to the mode&#x27;s ambitus is called &quot;perfect&quot;; if it falls short of it, &quot;imperfect&quot;; if it exceeds it, &quot;superfluous&quot;; and a melody that combines the ambituses of both the plagal and authentic is said to be in a &quot;mixed mode&quot;.

Although the earlier (Greek) model for the Carolingian system was probably ordered like the Byzantine &quot;oktōēchos&quot;, with the four authentic modes first, followed by the four plagals, the earliest extant sources for the Latin system are organized in four pairs of authentic and plagal modes sharing the same final: protus authentic/plagal, deuterus authentic/plagal, tritus authentic/plagal, and tetrardus authentic/plagal.

Each mode has, in addition to its final, a &quot;reciting tone&quot;, sometimes called the &quot;dominant&quot;. It is also sometimes called the &quot;tenor&quot;, from Latin &quot;tenere&quot; &quot;to hold&quot;, meaning the tone around which the melody principally centres. The reciting tones of all authentic modes began a fifth above the final, with those of the plagal modes a third above. However, the reciting tones of modes 3, 4, and 8 rose one step during the 10th and 11th centuries with 3 and 8 moving from B to C (half step) and that of 4 moving from G to A (whole step).

After the reciting tone, every mode is distinguished by scale degrees called &quot;mediant&quot; and &quot;participant&quot;. The mediant is named from its position between the final and reciting tone. In the authentic modes it is the third of the scale, unless that note should happen to be B, in which case C substitutes for it. In the plagal modes, its position is somewhat irregular. The participant is an auxiliary note, generally adjacent to the mediant in authentic modes and, in the plagal forms, coincident with the reciting tone of the corresponding authentic mode (some modes have a second participant).

Only one accidental is used commonly in Gregorian chant – B may be lowered by a half-step to B. This usually (but not always) occurs in modes V and VI, as well as in the upper tetrachord of IV, and is optional in other modes except III, VII and VIII.

In 1547, the Swiss theorist Henricus Glareanus published the &quot;Dodecachordon&quot;, in which he solidified the concept of the church modes, and added four additional modes: the Aeolian (mode 9), Hypoaeolian (mode 10), Ionian (mode 11), and Hypoionian (mode 12). A little later in the century, the Italian Gioseffo Zarlino at first adopted Glarean&#x27;s system in 1558, but later (1571 and 1573) revised the numbering and naming conventions in a manner he deemed more logical, resulting in the widespread promulgation of two conflicting systems.

Zarlino&#x27;s system reassigned the six pairs of authentic–plagal mode numbers to finals in the order of the natural hexachord, C–D–E–F–G–A, and transferred the Greek names as well, so that modes 1 through 8 now became C-authentic to F-plagal, and were now called by the names Dorian to Hypomixolydian. The pair of G modes were numbered 9 and 10 and were named Ionian and Hypoionian, while the pair of A modes retained both the numbers and names (11, Aeolian, and 12 Hypoaeolian) of Glarean&#x27;s system. While Zarlino&#x27;s system became popular in France, Italian composers preferred Glarean&#x27;s scheme because it retained the traditional eight modes, while expanding them. Luzzasco Luzzaschi was an exception in Italy, in that he used Zarlino&#x27;s new system.

In the late-18th and 19th centuries, some chant reformers (notably the editors of the Mechlin, Pustet-Ratisbon (Regensburg), and Rheims-Cambrai Office-Books, collectively referred to as the Cecilian Movement) renumbered the modes once again, this time retaining the original eight mode numbers and Glareanus&#x27;s modes 9 and 10, but assigning numbers 11 and 12 to the modes on the final B, which they named Locrian and Hypolocrian (even while rejecting their use in chant). The Ionian and Hypoionian modes (on C) become in this system modes 13 and 14.

Given the confusion between ancient, medieval, and modern terminology, &quot;today it is more consistent and practical to use the traditional designation of the modes with numbers one to eight&quot;, using Roman numeral (I–VIII), rather than using the pseudo-Greek naming system. Medieval terms, first used in Carolingian treatises, later in Aquitanian tonaries, are still used by scholars today: the Greek ordinals (&quot;first&quot;, &quot;second&quot;, etc.) transliterated into the Latin alphabet protus (πρῶτος), deuterus (δεύτερος), tritus (τρίτος), and tetrardus (τέταρτος). In practice they can be specified as authentic or as plagal like &quot;protus authentus / plagalis&quot;.


===Use===
A mode indicated a primary pitch (a final), the organization of pitches in relation to the final, the suggested range, the melodic formulas associated with different modes, the location and importance of cadences, and the affect (i.e., emotional effect/character). Liane Curtis writes that &quot;Modes should not be equated with scales: principles of melodic organization, placement of cadences, and emotional affect are essential parts of modal content&quot; in medieval and Renaissance music.

Dahlhaus lists &quot;three factors that form the respective starting points for the modal theories of Aurelian of Réôme, Hermannus Contractus, and Guido of Arezzo&quot;:
* the relation of modal formulas to the comprehensive system of tonal relationships embodied in the diatonic scale
* the partitioning of the octave into a modal framework
* the function of the modal final as a relational center.
The oldest medieval treatise regarding modes is &quot;Musica disciplina&quot; by Aurelian of Réôme (dating from around 850) while Hermannus Contractus was the first to define modes as partitionings of the octave. However, the earliest Western source using the system of eight modes is the Tonary of St Riquier, dated between about 795 and 800.

Various interpretations of the &quot;character&quot; imparted by the different modes have been suggested. Three such interpretations, from Guido of Arezzo (995–1050), Adam of Fulda (1445–1505), and Juan de Espinosa Medrano (1632–1688), follow:


==Modern modes==

Modern Western modes use the same set of notes as the major scale, in the same order, but starting from one of its seven degrees in turn as a tonic, and so present a different sequence of whole and half steps. With the interval sequence of the major scale being W–W–H–W–W–W–H, where &quot;W&quot; means a whole tone (whole step) and &quot;H&quot; means a semitone (half step), it is thus possible to generate the following modes:

For the sake of simplicity, the examples shown above are formed by natural notes (also called &quot;white notes&quot;, as they can be played using the white keys of a piano keyboard). However, any transposition of each of these scales is a valid example of the corresponding mode. In other words, transposition preserves mode.

Although the names of the modern modes are Greek and some have names used in ancient Greek theory for some of the &quot;harmoniai&quot;, the names of the modern modes are conventional and do not refer to the sequences of intervals found even in the diatonic genus of the Greek octave species sharing the same name.

===Analysis===

Each mode has characteristic intervals and chords that give it its distinctive sound. The following is an analysis of each of the seven modern modes. The examples are provided in a key signature with no sharps or flats (scales composed of natural notes).

====Ionian (I)====
The Ionian mode is the modern major scale. The example composed of natural notes begins on C, and is also known as the C-major scale:


*Tonic triad: C major
*Tonic seventh chord: CM7
*Dominant triad: G (in modern tonal thinking, the fifth or dominant scale degree, which in this case is G, is the next-most important chord root after the tonic)
*Seventh chord on the dominant: G7 (a dominant seventh chord, so-called because of its position in this – and only this – modal scale)

====Dorian (II)====
The Dorian mode is the second mode. The example composed of natural notes begins on D:

The Dorian mode is very similar to the modern natural minor scale (see Aeolian mode below). The only difference with respect to the natural minor scale is in the sixth scale degree, which is a major sixth (M6) above the tonic, rather than a minor sixth (m6).

*Tonic triad: Dm
*Tonic seventh chord: Dm7
*Dominant triad: Am
*Seventh chord on the dominant: Am7 (a minor seventh chord)

====Phrygian (III)====
The Phrygian mode is the third mode. The example composed of natural notes starts on E:


The Phrygian mode is very similar to the modern natural minor scale (see Aeolian mode below). The only difference with respect to the natural minor scale is in the second scale degree, which is a minor second (m2) above the tonic, rather than a major second (M2).

*Tonic triad: Em
*Tonic seventh chord: Em7
*Dominant triad: Bdim
*Seventh chord on the dominant: Bø7 (a half-diminished seventh chord)

====Lydian (IV)====
The Lydian mode is the fourth mode. The example composed of natural notes starts on F:


The single tone that differentiates this scale from the major scale (Ionian mode) is its fourth degree, which is an augmented fourth (A4) above the tonic (F), rather than a perfect fourth (P4).

*Tonic triad: F
*Tonic seventh chord: FM7
*Dominant triad: C
*Seventh chord on the dominant: CM7 (a major seventh chord)

====Mixolydian (V)====
The Mixolydian mode is the fifth mode. The example composed of natural notes begins on G:


The single tone that differentiates this scale from the major scale (Ionian mode) is its seventh degree, which is a minor seventh (m7) above the tonic (G), rather than a major seventh (M7). Therefore, the seventh scale degree becomes a subtonic to the tonic because it is now a whole tone lower than the tonic, in contrast to the seventh degree in the major scale, which is a semitone tone lower than the tonic (leading-tone).

*Tonic triad: G
*Tonic seventh chord: G7 (the dominant seventh chord in this mode is the seventh chord built on the tonic degree)
*Dominant triad: Dm
*Seventh chord on the dominant: Dm7 (a minor seventh chord)

====Aeolian (VI)====
The Aeolian mode is the sixth mode. It is also called the natural minor scale. The example composed of natural notes begins on A, and is also known as the A natural-minor scale:

*Tonic triad: Am
*Tonic seventh chord: Am7
*Dominant triad: Em
*Seventh chord on the dominant: Em7 (a minor seventh chord)

====Locrian (VII)====
The Locrian mode is the seventh mode. The example composed of natural notes begins on B:


The distinctive scale degree here is the diminished fifth (d5). This makes the tonic triad diminished, so this mode is the only one in which the chords built on the tonic and dominant scale degrees have their roots separated by a diminished, rather than perfect, fifth. Similarly the tonic seventh chord is half-diminished.
*Tonic triad: Bdim or B°
*Tonic seventh chord: Bm75 or Bø7
*Dominant triad: F
*Seventh chord on the dominant: FM7 (a major seventh chord)

=== Summary ===
The modes can be arranged in the following sequence, which follows the circle of fifths. In this sequence, each mode has one more lowered interval relative to the tonic than the mode preceding it. Thus, taking Lydian as reference, Ionian (major) has a lowered fourth; Mixolydian, a lowered fourth and seventh; Dorian, a lowered fourth, seventh, and third; Aeolian (natural minor), a lowered fourth, seventh, third, and sixth; Phrygian, a lowered fourth, seventh, third, sixth, and second; and Locrian, a lowered fourth, seventh, third, sixth, second, and fifth. Put another way, the augmented fourth of the Lydian mode has been reduced to a perfect fourth in Ionian, the major seventh in Ionian to a minor seventh in Mixolydian, etc.

The first three modes are sometimes called major, the next three minor, and the last one diminished (Locrian), according to the quality of their tonic triads. The Locrian mode is traditionally considered theoretical rather than practical because the triad built on the first scale degree is diminished. Because diminished triads are not consonant they do not lend themselves to cadential endings and cannot be tonicized according to traditional practice.

* The Ionian mode corresponds to the major scale. Scales in the Lydian mode are major scales with an augmented fourth. The Mixolydian mode corresponds to the major scale with a minor seventh.
* The Aeolian mode is identical to the natural minor scale. The Dorian mode corresponds to the natural minor scale with a major sixth. The Phrygian mode corresponds to the natural minor scale with a minor second.
* The Locrian is neither a major nor a minor mode because, although its third scale degree is minor, the fifth degree is diminished instead of perfect. For this reason it is sometimes called a &quot;diminished&quot; scale, though in jazz theory this term is also applied to the octatonic scale. This interval is enharmonically equivalent to the augmented fourth found between scale degrees 1 and 4 in the Lydian mode and is also referred to as the tritone.

===Use===
Use and conception of modes or modality today is different from that in early music. As Jim Samson explains, &quot;Clearly any comparison of medieval and modern modality would recognize that the latter takes place against a background of some three centuries of harmonic tonality, permitting, and in the 19th century requiring, a dialogue between modal and diatonic procedure&quot;. Indeed, when 19th-century composers revived the modes, they rendered them more strictly than Renaissance composers had, to make their qualities distinct from the prevailing major-minor system. Renaissance composers routinely sharped leading tones at cadences and lowered the fourth in the Lydian mode.

The Ionian, or Iastian, mode is another name for the major scale used in much Western music. The Aeolian forms the base of the most common Western minor scale; in modern practice the Aeolian mode is differentiated from the minor by using only the seven notes of the Aeolian mode. By contrast, minor mode compositions of the common practice period frequently raise the seventh scale degree by a semitone to strengthen the cadences, and in conjunction also raise the sixth scale degree by a semitone to avoid the awkward interval of an augmented second. This is particularly true of vocal music.

Traditional folk music provides countless examples of modal melodies. For example, Irish traditional music makes extensive usage not only of the major and minor (Aeolian) modes, but also the Mixolydian and Dorian modes. Within the context of Irish traditional music, the tunes are most commonly played in the keys of G-Major/A-Dorian/D-Mixolydian/E-Aeolian (minor) and D-Major/E-Dorian/A-Mixolydian/B-Aeolian (minor). Some Irish music is written in A-Major/F#-Aeolian (minor), with B-Dorian and E-Mixolydian tunes not being completely unheard of. Rarer still are Irish tunes in E-Major/F#-Dorian/B-Mixolydian. 

In some regions of Ireland, such as the west-central coast area of counties Galway and Clare, &quot;flat&quot; keys are far more prevalent than in other areas. Instruments will be constructed or pitched accordingly to allow for modal playing in C-Major/D-Dorian/G-Mixolydian or F-Major/G-Dorian/C-Mixolydian/D-Aeolian (minor), with some rare exceptions in Eb-Major/C-minor being played regionally. Some tunes are even composed in Bb-Major, with modulating sections in F-Mixolydian. A-minor is less popularly played in the region, despite the localised prevalence of tunes in C-Major and related modes. Much Flamenco music is in the Phrygian mode, though frequently with the third and seventh degrees raised by a semitone.

Zoltán Kodály, Gustav Holst, and Manuel de Falla use modal elements as modifications of a diatonic background, while modality replaces diatonic tonality in the music of Claude Debussy and Béla Bartók.

==Other types==
While the term &quot;mode&quot; is still most commonly understood to refer to Ionian, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian, or Locrian modes in the diatonic scale; in modern music theory the word &quot;mode&quot; is also often used differently, to mean scales &quot;other&quot; than the diatonic. This is seen, for example, in melodic minor scale harmony, which is based on the seven rotations of the ascending melodic minor scale, yielding some interesting scales as shown below. The &quot;chord&quot; row lists tetrads that can be built from the pitches in the given mode (in jazz notation, the symbol Δ is for a major seventh).

Since Dorian mode is the &quot;middle&quot; mode, we compare it with other modes:

(♯ and ♭ are dual, 2 and 7 are dual, 3 and 6 are dual, 4 and 5 are dual)

Dorian is self-dual, Mixolydian mode and Aeolian mode are dual, Ionian mode and Phrygian mode are dual, etc.

Or remove two diatonic notes to get pentatonic scale:

Scales that are called &quot;harmonic&quot; contain all seven types of seventh chords (like the harmonic major scale and the harmonic minor scale).

e.g. for Dorian ♯4:

* 1st: Minor seventh chord
* 2nd: Dominant seventh chord
* 3rd: Major seventh chord
* 4th (start with the ♯4): Diminished seventh chord
* 5th: Minor major seventh chord
* 6th: Half-diminished seventh chord
* 7th: Augmented major seventh chord

and for Dorian ♭5:

* 1st: Half-diminished seventh chord
* 2nd: Minor seventh chord
* 3rd: Minor major seventh chord
* 4th: Dominant seventh chord
* 5th (start with the ♭5): Augmented major seventh chord
* 6th: Diminished seventh chord
* 7th: Major seventh chord

In contrast, the original Dorian mode (also the natural major scale and the natural minor scale) does not contain minor major seventh chord and augmented major seventh chord and diminished seventh chord.


The Dorian mode, and Aeolian dominant scale (Dorian ♯3 ♭6 scale), and Neapolitan major scale (Dorian ♭2 ♯7 scale), and double harmonic scale (Dorian ♭2 ♯3 ♭6 ♯7 scale), are all self-dual. However, there are no harmonic scales that are self-dual. From that, we can list the scales and the triad qualities and the seventh chord qualities in each scale as degrees of Dorian mode and Aeolian dominant scale (Dorian ♯3 ♭6 scale) and Neapolitan major scale (Dorian ♭2 ♯7 scale) and double harmonic scale (Dorian ♭2 ♯3 ♭6 ♯7 scale) and the two types of Dorian harmonic scale:
(for Dorian mode and Aeolian dominant scale and Neapolitan major scale and double harmonic scale, the 2nd / 7th scales, the 3rd / 6th scales, the 4th / 5th scales, are dual scales, and for the scale of a type of Dorian harmonic scale, its dual is the 2nd / 7th scale, the 3rd / 6th scale, the 4th / 5th scale, of another Dorian harmonic scale).



Aeolian dominant scale (Dorian ♯3 ♭6 scale) can be called &quot;anti-Dorian scale&quot;, since it and Dorian scale are the only two scales which are self-dual.

; Dual triads:

: major triad ~ minor triad
: diminished triad (self-dual)
: augmented triad (self-dual)
; Dual seventh chords:

; Dual keys:
: A ~ G
: E ~ C
: B ~ F
: F♯ ~ B♭
: C♯ ~ E♭
: D♯ ~ D♭

<text>Mechanics () is the area of physics concerned with the relationships between force, matter, and motion among physical objects. Forces applied to objects may result in displacements, which are changes of an object&#x27;s position relative to its environment.

Theoretical expositions of this branch of physics has its origins in Ancient Greece, for instance, in the writings of Aristotle and Archimedes (see History of classical mechanics and Timeline of classical mechanics). During the early modern period, scientists such as Galileo Galilei, Johannes Kepler, Christiaan Huygens, and Isaac Newton laid the foundation for what is now known as classical mechanics.

As a branch of classical physics, mechanics deals with bodies that are either at rest or are moving with velocities significantly less than the speed of light. It can also be defined as the physical science that deals with the motion of and forces on bodies not in the quantum realm.

== History ==
=== Antiquity ===

The ancient Greek philosophers were among the first to propose that abstract principles govern nature. The main theory of mechanics in antiquity was Aristotelian mechanics, though an alternative theory is exposed in the pseudo-Aristotelian &quot;Mechanical Problems&quot;, often attributed to one of his successors.

There is another tradition that goes back to the ancient Greeks where mathematics is used more extensively to analyze bodies statically or dynamically, an approach that may have been stimulated by prior work of the Pythagorean Archytas. Examples of this tradition include pseudo-Euclid (&quot;On the Balance&quot;), Archimedes (&quot;On the Equilibrium of Planes&quot;, &quot;On Floating Bodies&quot;), Hero (&quot;Mechanica&quot;), and Pappus (&quot;Collection&quot;, Book VIII).

=== Medieval age ===
In the Middle Ages, Aristotle&#x27;s theories were criticized and modified by a number of figures, beginning with John Philoponus in the 6th century. A central problem was that of projectile motion, which was discussed by Hipparchus and Philoponus.

Persian Islamic polymath Ibn Sīnā published his theory of motion in &quot;The Book of Healing&quot; (1020). He said that an impetus is imparted to a projectile by the thrower, and viewed it as persistent, requiring external forces such as air resistance to dissipate it. Ibn Sina made distinction between &#x27;force&#x27; and &#x27;inclination&#x27; (called &quot;mayl&quot;), and argued that an object gained mayl when the object is in opposition to its natural motion. So he concluded that continuation of motion is attributed to the inclination that is transferred to the object, and that object will be in motion until the mayl is spent. He also claimed that a projectile in a vacuum would not stop unless it is acted upon, consistent with Newton&#x27;s first law of motion.

On the question of a body subject to a constant (uniform) force, the 12th-century Jewish-Arab scholar Hibat Allah Abu&#x27;l-Barakat al-Baghdaadi (born Nathanel, Iraqi, of Baghdad) stated that constant force imparts constant acceleration. According to Shlomo Pines, al-Baghdaadi&#x27;s theory of motion was &quot;the oldest negation of Aristotle&#x27;s fundamental dynamic law [namely, that a constant force produces a uniform motion], [and is thus an] anticipation in a vague fashion of the fundamental law of classical mechanics [namely, that a force applied continuously produces acceleration].&quot;

Influenced by earlier writers such as Ibn Sina and al-Baghdaadi, the 14th-century French priest Jean Buridan developed the theory of impetus, which later developed into the modern theories of inertia, velocity, acceleration and momentum. This work and others was developed in 14th-century England by the Oxford Calculators such as Thomas Bradwardine, who studied and formulated various laws regarding falling bodies. The concept that the main properties of a body are uniformly accelerated motion (as of falling bodies) was worked out by the 14th-century Oxford Calculators.

=== Early modern age ===

Two central figures in the early modern age are Galileo Galilei and Isaac Newton. Galileo&#x27;s final statement of his mechanics, particularly of falling bodies, is his &quot;Two New Sciences&quot; (1638). Newton&#x27;s 1687 &quot;Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica&quot; provided a detailed mathematical account of mechanics, using the newly developed mathematics of calculus and providing the basis of Newtonian mechanics.

There is some dispute over priority of various ideas: Newton&#x27;s &quot;Principia&quot; is certainly the seminal work and has been tremendously influential, and many of the mathematics results therein could not have been stated earlier without the development of the calculus. However, many of the ideas, particularly as pertain to inertia and falling bodies, had been developed by prior scholars such as Christiaan Huygens and the less-known medieval predecessors. Precise credit is at times difficult or contentious because scientific language and standards of proof changed, so whether medieval statements are &quot;equivalent&quot; to modern statements or &quot;sufficient&quot; proof, or instead &quot;similar&quot; to modern statements and &quot;hypotheses&quot; is often debatable.

=== Modern age ===
Two main modern developments in mechanics are general relativity of Einstein, and quantum mechanics, both developed in the 20th century based in part on earlier 19th-century ideas. The development in the modern continuum mechanics, particularly in the areas of elasticity, plasticity, fluid dynamics, electrodynamics, and thermodynamics of deformable media, started in the second half of the 20th century.

== Types of mechanical bodies ==
The often-used term body needs to stand for a wide assortment of objects, including particles, projectiles, spacecraft, stars, parts of machinery, parts of solids, parts of fluids (gases and liquids), etc.

Other distinctions between the various sub-disciplines of mechanics concern the nature of the bodies being described. Particles are bodies with little (known) internal structure, treated as mathematical points in classical mechanics. Rigid bodies have size and shape, but retain a simplicity close to that of the particle, adding just a few so-called degrees of freedom, such as orientation in space.

Otherwise, bodies may be semi-rigid, i.e. elastic, or non-rigid, i.e. fluid. These subjects have both classical and quantum divisions of study.

For instance, the motion of a spacecraft, regarding its orbit and attitude (rotation), is described by the relativistic theory of classical mechanics, while the analogous movements of an atomic nucleus are described by quantum mechanics.

== Sub-disciplines ==
The following are the three main designations consisting of various subjects that are studied in mechanics.

Note that there is also the &quot;theory of fields&quot; which constitutes a separate discipline in physics, formally treated as distinct from mechanics, whether it be classical fields or quantum fields. But in actual practice, subjects belonging to mechanics and fields are closely interwoven. Thus, for instance, forces that act on particles are frequently derived from fields (electromagnetic or gravitational), and particles generate fields by acting as sources. In fact, in quantum mechanics, particles themselves are fields, as described theoretically by the wave function.

=== Classical ===
The following are described as forming classical mechanics:
* Newtonian mechanics, the original theory of motion (kinematics) and forces (dynamics)
* Analytical mechanics is a reformulation of Newtonian mechanics with an emphasis on system energy, rather than on forces. There are two main branches of analytical mechanics:
** Hamiltonian mechanics, a theoretical formalism, based on the principle of conservation of energy
** Lagrangian mechanics, another theoretical formalism, based on the principle of the least action
* Classical statistical mechanics generalizes ordinary classical mechanics to consider systems in an unknown state; often used to derive thermodynamic properties.
* Celestial mechanics, the motion of bodies in space: planets, comets, stars, galaxies, etc.
* Astrodynamics, spacecraft navigation, etc.
* Solid mechanics, elasticity, plasticity, or viscoelasticity exhibited by deformable solids
* Fracture mechanics 
* Acoustics, sound (density, variation, propagation) in solids, fluids and gases
* Statics, semi-rigid bodies in mechanical equilibrium
* Fluid mechanics, the motion of fluids
* Soil mechanics, mechanical behavior of soils
* Continuum mechanics, mechanics of continua (both solid and fluid)
* Hydraulics, mechanical properties of liquids
* Fluid statics, liquids in equilibrium
* Applied mechanics (also known as engineering mechanics)
* Biomechanics, solids, fluids, etc. in biology
* Biophysics, physical processes in living organisms
* Relativistic or Einsteinian mechanics

=== Quantum ===

The following are categorized as being part of quantum mechanics:
* Schrödinger wave mechanics, used to describe the movements of the wavefunction of a single particle.
* Matrix mechanics is an alternative formulation that allows considering systems with a finite-dimensional state space.
* Quantum statistical mechanics generalizes ordinary quantum mechanics to consider systems in an unknown state; often used to derive thermodynamic properties.
* Particle physics, the motion, structure, and behavior of fundamental particles
* Nuclear physics, the motion, structure, and reactions of nuclei
* Condensed matter physics, quantum gases, solids, liquids, etc.

Historically, classical mechanics had been around for nearly a quarter millennium before quantum mechanics developed. Classical mechanics originated with Isaac Newton&#x27;s laws of motion in Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, developed over the seventeenth century. Quantum mechanics developed later, over the nineteenth century, precipitated by Planck&#x27;s postulate and Albert Einstein&#x27;s explanation of the photoelectric effect. Both fields are commonly held to constitute the most certain knowledge that exists about physical nature.

Classical mechanics has especially often been viewed as a model for other so-called exact sciences. Essential in this respect is the extensive use of mathematics in theories, as well as the decisive role played by experiment in generating and testing them.

Quantum mechanics is of a bigger scope, as it encompasses classical mechanics as a sub-discipline which applies under certain restricted circumstances. According to the correspondence principle, there is no contradiction or conflict between the two subjects, each simply pertains to specific situations. The correspondence principle states that the behavior of systems described by quantum theories reproduces classical physics in the limit of large quantum numbers, i.e. if quantum mechanics is applied to large systems (for e.g. a baseball), the result would almost be the same if classical mechanics had been applied. Quantum mechanics has superseded classical mechanics at the foundation level and is indispensable for the explanation and prediction of processes at the molecular, atomic, and sub-atomic level. However, for macroscopic processes classical mechanics is able to solve problems which are unmanageably difficult (mainly due to computational limits) in quantum mechanics and hence remains useful and well used.
Modern descriptions of such behavior begin with a careful definition of such quantities as displacement (distance moved), time, velocity, acceleration, mass, and force. Until about 400 years ago, however, motion was explained from a very different point of view. For example, following the ideas of Greek philosopher and scientist Aristotle, scientists reasoned that a cannonball falls down because its natural position is in the Earth; the Sun, the Moon, and the stars travel in circles around the Earth because it is the nature of heavenly objects to travel in perfect circles.

Often cited as father to modern science, Galileo brought together the ideas of other great thinkers of his time and began to calculate motion in terms of distance travelled from some starting position and the time that it took. He showed that the speed of falling objects increases steadily during the time of their fall. This acceleration is the same for heavy objects as for light ones, provided air friction (air resistance) is discounted. The English mathematician and physicist Isaac Newton improved this analysis by defining force and mass and relating these to acceleration. For objects traveling at speeds close to the speed of light, Newton&#x27;s laws were superseded by Albert Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity. [A sentence illustrating the computational complication of Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity.] For atomic and subatomic particles, Newton&#x27;s laws were superseded by quantum theory. For everyday phenomena, however, Newton&#x27;s three laws of motion remain the cornerstone of dynamics, which is the study of what causes motion.

=== Relativistic ===

Akin to the distinction between quantum and classical mechanics, Albert Einstein&#x27;s general and special theories of relativity have expanded the scope of Newton and Galileo&#x27;s formulation of mechanics. The differences between relativistic and Newtonian mechanics become significant and even dominant as the velocity of a body approaches the speed of light. For instance, in Newtonian mechanics, the kinetic energy of a free particle is , whereas in relativistic mechanics, it is (where is the Lorentz factor; this formula reduces to the Newtonian expression in the low energy limit).

For high-energy processes, quantum mechanics must be adjusted to account for special relativity; this has led to the development of quantum field theory.
