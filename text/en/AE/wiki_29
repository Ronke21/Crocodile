<text>In Greek mythology, the Minotaur (, &quot;Mīnṓtauros&quot;), also known as Asterion, is a mythical creature portrayed during classical antiquity with the head and tail of a bull and the body of a man or, as described by Roman poet Ovid, a being &quot;part man and part bull&quot;. He dwelt at the center of the Labyrinth, which was an elaborate maze-like construction designed by the architect Daedalus and his son Icarus, upon command of King Minos of Crete. According to tradition, every nine years the people of Athens were compelled by King Minos to choose fourteen young noble citizens (seven men and seven women) to be offered as sacrificial victims to the Minotaur in retribution for the death of Minos&#x27;s son Androgeos. The Minotaur was eventually slain by the Athenian hero Theseus, who managed to navigate the labyrinth with the help of a thread offered to him by the King&#x27;s daughter, Ariadne.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;Minotaur&quot; derives from the Ancient Greek a compound of the name (Minos) and the noun &quot;tauros&quot; meaning , thus it is translated as the . In Crete, the Minotaur was known by the name Asterion () or Asterius (), a name shared with Minos&#x27;s foster-father.

&quot;Minotaur&quot; was originally a proper noun in reference to this mythic figure. That is, there was only the one Minotaur. In contrast, the use of &quot;minotaur&quot; as a common noun to refer to members of a generic &quot;species&quot; of bull-headed creatures developed much later, in 20th century fantasy genre fiction.

The Minotaur was called &quot;&quot; in Latin and in Etruscan. English pronunciation of the word &quot;Minotaur&quot; is varied; the following can be found in dictionaries: , , .

==Creation myth==

After ascending the throne of the island of Crete, Minos competed with his brothers as ruler. Minos prayed to the sea god Poseidon to send him a snow-white bull as a sign of the god&#x27;s favor. Minos was to sacrifice the bull to honor Poseidon, but owing to the bull&#x27;s beauty he decided instead to keep him. Minos believed that the god would accept a substitute sacrifice. To punish Minos, Poseidon arranged with Aphrodite for Minos&#x27;s wife, Pasiphaë, to fall in love with the bull. Pasiphaë had the master craftsman, Daedalus, fashion for her a hollow wooden cow, into which she climbed to let the bull mate with her. She then fell pregnant and bore Asterius, the Minotaur, making him a grandchild of Helios. Pasiphaë nursed the Minotaur but he grew in size and became ferocious. As the unnatural offspring of a woman and a beast, the Minotaur had no natural source of nourishment and thus devoured humans for sustenance. Minos, following advice from the oracle at Delphi, had Daedalus construct a gigantic Labyrinth to hold the Minotaur. Its location was near Minos&#x27;s palace in Knossos.

==Appearance==
The Minotaur is commonly represented in Classical art with the body of a man and the head and tail of a bull. According to Sophocles&#x27;s , when the river spirit Achelous seduced Deianira, one of the guises he assumed was a man with the head of a bull. From classical antiquity through the Renaissance, the Minotaur appears at the center of many depictions of the Labyrinth. Ovid&#x27;s Latin account of the Minotaur, which did not describe which half was bull and which half man, was the most widely available during the Middle Ages, and several later versions show a man&#x27;s head and torso on a bull&#x27;s body - the reverse of the Classical configuration, reminiscent of a centaur. This alternative tradition survived into the Renaissance, and is reflected in Dryden&#x27;s elaborated translation of Virgil&#x27;s description of the Minotaur in Book VI of the &quot;Aeneid&quot;: &quot;The lower part a beast, a man above/The monument of their polluted love.&quot; It still figures in some modern depictions, such as Steele Savage&#x27;s illustrations for Edith Hamilton&#x27;s &quot;Mythology&quot; (1942).

== Theseus myth ==

All the stories agree that prince Androgeus, son of King Minos, died and that the fault lay with the Athenians. The sacrifice of young Athenian men and women was a penalty for his death.

In some versions he was killed by the Athenians because of their jealousy of the victories he had won at the Panathenaic Games; in others he was killed at Marathon by the Cretan Bull, his mother&#x27;s former taurine lover, because Aegeus, king of Athens, had commanded Androgeus to slay it. The common tradition holds that Minos waged a war of revenge for the death of his son, and won. The consequence of Athens losing the war was the regular sacrifice of several of their youths and maidens. Pausanias&#x27; account of the myth said that Minos had led a fleet against Athens and simply harassed the Athenians until they had agreed to send children as sacrifices. In his account of the Minotaur&#x27;s birth, Catullus refers to yet another version in which Athens was &quot;compelled by the cruel plague to pay penalties for the killing of Androgeon&quot;. To avert a plague caused by divine retribution for the Cretan prince&#x27;s death, Aegeus had to send into the Labyrinth &quot;young men at the same time as the best of unwed girls as a feast&quot; for the Minotaur. Some accounts declare that Minos required seven Athenian youths and seven maidens, chosen by lots, to be sent every seventh year (or ninth); some versions say every year.
When the time for the third sacrifice approached, the Athenian prince Theseus volunteered to slay the Minotaur. Isocrates orates that Theseus thought that he would rather die than rule a city that paid a tribute of children&#x27;s lives to their enemy. He promised his father Aegeus that he would change the somber black sail of the boat carrying the victims from Athens to Crete, and put up a white sail for his return journey if he was successful; the crew would leave up the black sail if he was killed.

In Crete, Minos&#x27;s daughter Ariadne fell madly in love with Theseus and helped him navigate the Labyrinth. In most accounts she gave him a ball of thread, allowing him to retrace his path. According to various classical sources and representations, Theseus killed the Minotaur with his bare hands, sometimes with a club or a sword. He then led the Athenians out of the Labyrinth, and they sailed with Ariadne away from Crete. On the way home, Theseus abandoned Ariadne on the island of Naxos and continued to Athens. The returning group neglected to replace the black sail with the promised white sail, and from his lookout on Cape Sounion, King Aegeus saw the black-sailed ship approach. Presuming his son dead, he killed himself by leaping into the sea that is since named after him. His death secured the throne for Theseus.

==Interpretations==

The contest between Theseus and the Minotaur was frequently represented in Greek art. A Knossian didrachm exhibits on one side the Labyrinth, on the other the Minotaur surrounded by a semicircle of small balls, probably intended for stars; one of the monster&#x27;s names was Asterion or Asterius (&quot;star&quot;). Pasiphaë gave birth to Asterius, who was called the Minotaur. He had the face of a bull, but the rest of him was human; and Minos, in compliance with certain oracles, shut him up and guarded him in the Labyrinth.While the ruins of Minos&#x27;s palace at Knossos were discovered, the Labyrinth never was. The multiplicity of rooms, staircases and corridors in the palace has led some archaeologists to suggest that the palace itself was the source of the Labyrinth myth, with over 1300 maze-like compartments, an idea that is now generally discredited.
Homer, describing the shield of Achilles, remarked that Daedalus had constructed a ceremonial dancing ground for Ariadne, but does not associate this with the term &quot;labyrinth&quot;.

Some 19th century mythologists proposed that the Minotaur was a personification of the sun and a Minoan adaptation of the Baal-Moloch of the Phoenicians. The slaying of the Minotaur by Theseus in that case could be interpreted as a memory of Athens breaking tributary relations with Minoan Crete.

According to A.B. Cook, &quot;Minos&quot; and &quot;Minotaur&quot; were different forms of the same personage, representing the sun-god of the Cretans, who depicted the sun as a bull. He and J. G. Frazer both explain Pasiphaë&#x27;s union with the bull as a sacred ceremony, at which the queen of Knossos was wedded to a bull-formed god, just as the wife of the Tyrant in Athens was wedded to Dionysus. E. Pottier, who does not dispute the historical personality of Minos, in view of the story of Phalaris, considers it probable that in Crete (where a bull cult may have existed by the side of that of the labrys) victims were tortured by being shut up in the belly of a red-hot brazen bull. The story of Talos, the Cretan man of brass, who heated himself red-hot and clasped strangers in his embrace as soon as they landed on the island, is probably of similar origin.

Kerényi Károly viewed the Minotaur, or Asterios, as a god associated with stars, comparable to Dionysus. Coins minted at Knossos from the fifth century showed labyrinth patterns encircling a goddess&#x27;s head crowned with a wreath of grain, a bull&#x27;s head, or a star. Kerényi argued that the star in the Labyrinth was in fact Asterios, making the Minotaur a &quot;luminous&quot; deity in Crete, associated with a goddess known as the Mistress of the Labyrinth.

A geological interpretation also exists. Citing early descriptions of the minotaur by Callimachus as being entirely focused on the &quot;cruel bellowing&quot;
it made from its underground labyrinth, and the extensive tectonic activity in the region, science journalist Matt Kaplan has theorised that the myth may well stem from geology.

===Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;===

The Minotaur (, Italian for &#x27;infamy of Crete&#x27;), appears briefly in Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;, in Canto 12 (l. 12–13, 16–21), where Dante and his guide Virgil find themselves picking their way among boulders dislodged on the slope and preparing to enter into the seventh circle of hell. Dante and Virgil encounter the beast first among the &quot;men of blood&quot;: those damned for their violent natures. Some commentators believe that Dante, in a reversal of classical tradition, bestowed the beast with a man&#x27;s head upon a bull&#x27;s body, though this representation had already appeared in the Middle Ages.


In these lines, Virgil taunts the Minotaur to distract him, and reminds the Minotaur that he was killed by Theseus the Duke of Athens with the help of the monster&#x27;s half-sister Ariadne. The Minotaur is the first infernal guardian whom Virgil and Dante encounter within the walls of Dis.
The Minotaur seems to represent the entire zone of Violence, much as Geryon represents Fraud in Canto XVI, and serves a similar role as gatekeeper for the entire seventh Circle.

Giovanni Boccaccio writes of the Minotaur in his literary commentary of the Commedia: &quot;When he had grown up and become a most ferocious animal, and of incredible strength, they tell that Minos had him shut up in a prison called the labyrinth, and that he had sent to him there all those whom he wanted to die a cruel death&quot;. Dante Gabriel Rossetti, in his own commentary, compares the Minotaur with all three sins of violence within the seventh circle: &quot;The Minotaur, who is situated at the rim of the tripartite circle, fed, according to the poem was biting himself (violence against one&#x27;s body) and was conceived in the &#x27;false cow&#x27; (violence against nature, daughter of God).&quot;

Virgil and Dante then pass quickly by to the centaurs (Nessus, Chiron and Pholus) who guard the Flegetonte (&quot;river of blood&quot;), to continue through the seventh Circle.

<text>Memex memory expansion] is a hypothetical electromechanical device for interacting with microform documents and described in Vannevar Bush&#x27;s 1945 article &quot;As We May Think&quot;. Bush envisioned the memex as a device in which individuals would compress and store all of their books, records, and communications, &quot;mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility&quot;. The individual was supposed to use the memex as an automatic personal filing system, making the memex &quot;an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory&quot;.

The concept of the memex influenced the development of early hypertext systems, eventually leading to the creation of the World Wide Web, and personal knowledge base software. The hypothetical implementation depicted by Bush for the purpose of concrete illustration was based upon a document bookmark list of static microfilm pages and lacked a true hypertext system, where parts of pages would have internal structure beyond the common textual format. 

==Development==
===An electromechanical memex device===
In &quot;As We May Think&quot;, Vannevar Bush describes a memex as an electromechanical device enabling individuals to develop and read a large self-contained research library, create and follow associative trails of links and personal annotations, and recall these trails at any time to share them with other researchers. This device would closely mimic the associative processes of the human mind, but it would be gifted with permanent recollection. As Bush writes, &quot;Thus science may implement the ways in which man produces, stores, and consults the record of the race&quot;.

The technology used would have been a combination of electromechanical controls and microfilm cameras and readers, all integrated into a large desk. Most of the microfilm library would have been contained within the desk, but the user could add or remove microfilm reels at will. A memex would hypothetically read and write content on these microfilm reels, using electric photocells to read coded symbols recorded next to individual microfilm frames while the reels spun at high speed, stopping on command. The coded symbols would enable the memex to index, search, and link content to create and follow associative trails.

The top of the desk would have slanting translucent screens on which material could be projected for convenient reading. The top of the memex would have a transparent platen. When a longhand note, photograph, memoranda, or other things were placed on the platen, the depression of a lever would cause the item to be photographed onto the next blank space in a section of the memex film.

According to Bush, the memex could become &quot;a sort of mechanized private file and library&quot;. The memex device as described by Bush &quot;would use microfilm storage, dry photography, and analog computing to give postwar scholars access to a huge, indexed repository of knowledge any section of which could be called up with a few keystrokes.&quot;

===Associative trails===
An associative trail as conceived by Bush would be a way to create a new &quot;linear&quot; sequence of microfilm frames across any arbitrary sequence of microfilm frames by creating a chained sequence of links in the way just described, along with personal comments and &quot;side trails&quot;. At the time, Bush saw the current ways of indexing information as limiting and instead proposed a way to store information that was analogous to the mental association of the human brain: storing information with the capability of easy access at a later time using certain cues (in this case, a series of numbers as a code to retrieve data).

===Other features===
According to Bush, the memex would have features other than linking. The user could record new information on microfilm, by taking photos from paper or from a touch-sensitive translucent screen. A user could &quot;...insert a comment of his own, either linking it into the main trail or joining it by a side trail to a particular item. ...Thus he builds a trail of his interest through the maze of materials available to him.&quot; A user could also create a copy of an interesting trail (containing references and personal annotations) and &quot;...pass it to his friend for insertion in his own memex, there to be linked into the more general trail.&quot; 

In September 1945, &quot;Life&quot; magazine published an illustration by Alfred D. Crimi showing the &quot;Memex desk&quot;. According to &quot;Life&quot; magazine, the Memex desk &quot;would instantly bring files and material on an subject to the operator&#x27;s fingertips&quot;. The mechanical core of the desk would also include &quot;a mechanism which automatically photographs longhand notes, pictures and letters, then file them in the desk for future reference.&quot;

===Extending, storing, and consulting the record of the species===
Bush&#x27;s 1945 &quot;As We May Think&quot; idea for the memex extended far beyond a mechanism that might augment the research of one individual working in isolation. In Bush&#x27;s idea, the ability to connect, annotate, and share both published works and personal trails would profoundly change the process by which the &quot;world&#x27;s record&quot; is created and used:

==Legacy==
Bush said of his &quot;As We May Think&quot; memex device that &quot;technical difficulties of all sorts have been ignored,&quot; but that, &quot;also ignored are means as yet unknown which may come any day to accelerate technical progress as violently as did the advent of the thermionic tube.&quot; Michael Buckland concluded that Bush&#x27;s 1945 vision for an information retrieval machine is unhistorically viewed in relation to the subsequent development of electronic computer technology. Buckland studied the historical background of information retrieval in and before 1939 because the Memex was based on Bush&#x27;s work during 1938–1940 in building a photoelectric microfilm selector, an electronic retrieval technology invented by Emanuel Goldberg for Zeiss Ikon in the 1920s. According to Buckland, the legacy of Bush is twofold: a significant engineering achievement in building a rapid prototype microfilm selector, and &quot;a speculative article&quot; which through &quot;the social prestige of its author, has had an immediate and lasting effect in stimulating others.&quot;

The pioneer of human–computer interaction Douglas Engelbart was inspired by Bush&#x27;s proposal for a co-evolution between humans and machines. In a 1999 publication, Engelbart recollects that reading &quot;As We May Think&quot; in 1945 he &quot;became &#x27;infected&#x27; with the idea of building a means to extend and navigate this great pool of human knowledge&quot;. Around 1961, Engelbart re-read Bush&#x27;s article, and from 1962 onward Engelbart developed a series of technical designs. Engelbart updated the Memex microfilm storage desk and thereby arrived at a pioneering vision for a personal computer connected to an electronic visual display and a mouse pointing device. In 1962, Engelbart sent Bush a draft article for comment; Bush never replied. The article was published in 1963 under the title &quot;A Conceptual Framework for the Augmentation of Man&#x27;s Intellect&quot;.
In 1965, J. C. R. Licklider dedicated his book &quot;Libraries of the Future&quot; to Bush. Licklider wrote that he had often heard of the memex and &quot;trails of reference&quot;, even before he had read &quot;As We May Think&quot;. Also in 1965, Ted Nelson coined the word hypertext in a paper that quoted Bush&#x27;s memex idea at length. In 1968, Nelson collaborated with Andries van Dam to implement the Hypertext Editing System (HES). In his 1987 book entitled &quot;Literary Machines&quot;, Nelson defined hypertext as &quot;non-sequential writing with reader-controlled links&quot;. In 2000, Tim Berners-Lee published a statement, acknowledging the influence of hypertext, the work of Engelbart and Bush&#x27;s &quot;As We May Think&quot; on the development of the World Wide Web. In 2003, Microsoft promoted a life-logging research project under the name MyLifeBits as an attempt to fulfill Bush&#x27;s memex vision.

==1959 Memex II==
In 1959, Vannevar Bush described an improved &quot;Memex II&quot;. In the manuscript draft of &quot;Memex II&quot; he wrote, &quot;Professional societies will no longer print papers...&quot; and states that individuals will either order sets of papers to come on tape – complete with photographs and diagrams – or download &#x27;facsimiles&#x27; by telephone. Each society would maintain a &#x27;master memex&#x27; containing all papers, references, tables &quot;intimately interconnected by trails, so that one may follow a detailed matter from paper to paper, going back through the classics, recording criticism in the margins.&quot;

==1967 Memex revisited==
In 1967, Vannevar Bush published a retrospective article entitled &quot;Memex Revisited&quot; in his book &quot;Science Is Not Enough&quot;. Published 22 years after his initial conception of the Memex, Bush details the various technological advancements that have made his vision a possibility. Specifically, Bush cites photocells, transistors, cathode ray tubes, magnetic and videotape, &quot;high-speed electric circuits&quot;, and &quot;miniaturization of solid-state devices&quot; such as the TV and radio. The article claims that magnetic tape would be central to the creation of a modern Memex device. The erasable quality of the tape is of special significance, as this would allow for modification of information stored in the proposed Memex.

In the article, Bush stresses the continued importance of supplementing &quot;how creative men think&quot; and relates that the systems for indexing data are still insufficient and rely too much on linear pathways rather than the association-based system of the human brain. Bush writes that a machine with the &quot;speed and flexibility&quot; of the brain is not attainable, but improvements could be made in regard to the capacity to obtain informational &quot;permanence and clarity&quot;.

Bush also relates that, unlike digital technology, Memex would be of no significant aid to business or profitable ventures, and as a consequence, its development would occur only long after the mechanization of libraries and the introduction of what he describes as the specialized &quot;group machine&quot;, which would be useful for the sharing of ideas in fields such as medicine. Furthermore, although Bush discusses the compressional ability and rapidity so key to modern machines, he relates that speed will not be an integral part of Memex, stating that a tenth of a second would be an acceptable interval for its data retrieval, rather than the billionths of a second that modern computers are capable of. &quot;For Memex,&quot; he writes, &quot;the problem is not swift access, but selective access&quot;. Bush states that although the code-reading and potential linking capabilities of the rapid selector would be key to the creation of Memex, there is still an issue of enabling &quot;moderately rapid access to really large memory storage&quot;. There is an issue concerning selection, Bush conveys, and despite the fact that improvements have been made in the speed of digital selection, according to Bush, &quot;selection, in the broad sense, is still a stone adze in the hands of the cabinetmaker&quot;. Bush goes on to discuss the record-making process and how Memex could incorporate systems of voice-control and user-propagated learning. He proposes a machine that could respond to &quot;simple remarks&quot; as well as build trails based on its user&#x27;s &quot;habits of association,&quot; as Belinda Barnet described them in &quot;The Technical Evolution of Vannevar Bush&#x27;s Memex.&quot; Barnet also makes the distinction between the idea of a constructive Memex and the &quot;permanent trails&quot; described in &quot;As We May Think,&quot; and attributes Bush&#x27;s machine learning concepts to Claude Shannon&#x27;s mechanical mouse and work with &quot;feedback and machine learning&quot;.

==DARPA Memex Program==
Inspired by Bush&#x27;s hypothetical device in his 1945 article, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency launched a program named Memex in 2014 to fight human trafficking crimes on the dark web. DARPA later released the Memex artificial intelligence search technologies as open-source software. In 2016, DARPA Memex program received the 2016 Presidential Award for Extraordinary Efforts to Combat Trafficking in Persons for developing the anti-trafficking technology tool. Dozens of law enforcement organizations worldwide use the Memex software to conduct investigations.

<doc id="20637" wikidata="Q170474" url="?curid=20637" title="Modulation">
<text>In electronics and telecommunications, modulation is the process of varying one or more properties of a periodic waveform, called the &quot;carrier signal&quot;, with a separate signal called the &quot;modulation signal&quot; that typically contains information to be transmitted. For example, the modulation signal might be an audio signal representing sound from a microphone, a video signal representing moving images from a video camera, or a digital signal representing a sequence of binary digits, a bitstream from a computer. 

This carrier wave usually has a much higher frequency than the message signal does. This is because it is impractical to transmit signals with low frequencies. Generally, to receive a radio wave one needs a radio antenna with length that is one-fourth of wavelength. For low frequency radio waves, wavelength is on the scale of kilometers and building such a large antenna is not practical. In radio communication, the modulated carrier is transmitted through space as a radio wave to a radio receiver. 

Another purpose of modulation is to transmit multiple channels of information through a single communication medium, using frequency-division multiplexing (FDM). For example, in cable television (which uses FDM), many carrier signals, each modulated with a different television channel, are transported through a single cable to customers. Since each carrier occupies a different frequency, the channels do not interfere with each other. At the destination end, the carrier signal is demodulated to extract the information bearing modulation signal.

A modulator is a device or circuit that performs modulation. A demodulator (sometimes &quot;detector&quot;) is a circuit that performs demodulation, the inverse of modulation. A modem (from modulator–demodulator), used in bidirectional communication, can perform both operations. The lower frequency band occupied by the modulation signal is called the &quot;baseband&quot;, while the higher frequency band occupied by the modulated carrier is called the &quot;passband&quot;.

In analog modulation, an analog modulation signal is &quot;impressed&quot; on the carrier. Examples are amplitude modulation (AM) in which the amplitude (strength) of the carrier wave is varied by the modulation signal, and frequency modulation (FM) in which the frequency of the carrier wave is varied by the modulation signal. These were the earliest types of modulation, and are used to transmit an audio signal representing sound in AM and FM radio broadcasting. More recent systems use digital modulation, which impresses a digital signal consisting of a sequence of binary digits (bits), a bitstream, on the carrier, by means of mapping bits to elements from a discrete alphabet to be transmitted. This alphabet can consist of a set of real or complex numbers, or sequences, like oscillations of different frequencies, so-called frequency-shift keying (FSK) modulation. A more complicated digital modulation method that employs multiple carriers, orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), is used in WiFi networks, digital radio stations and digital cable television transmission.

==Analog modulation methods==


In analog modulation, the modulation is applied continuously in response to the analog information signal. Common analog modulation techniques include:
* Amplitude modulation (AM) (here the amplitude of the carrier signal is varied in accordance with the instantaneous amplitude of the modulating signal)
** Double-sideband modulation (DSB)
*** Double-sideband modulation with carrier (DSB-WC) (used on the AM radio broadcasting band)
*** Double-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission (DSB-SC)
*** Double-sideband reduced carrier transmission (DSB-RC)
** Single-sideband modulation (SSB, or SSB-AM)
*** Single-sideband modulation with carrier (SSB-WC)
*** Single-sideband modulation suppressed carrier modulation (SSB-SC)
** Vestigial sideband modulation (VSB, or VSB-AM)
** Quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM)
* Angle modulation, which is approximately constant envelope
** Frequency modulation (FM) (here the frequency of the carrier signal is varied in accordance with the instantaneous amplitude of the modulating signal)
** Phase modulation (PM) (here the phase shift of the carrier signal is varied in accordance with the instantaneous amplitude of the modulating signal)
** Transpositional Modulation (TM), in which the waveform inflection is modified resulting in a signal where each quarter cycle is transposed in the modulation process. TM is a pseudo-analog modulation (AM). Where an AM carrier also carries a phase variable phase f(ǿ). TM is f(AM,ǿ)
==Digital modulation methods==
In digital modulation, an analog carrier signal is modulated by a discrete signal. Digital modulation methods can be considered as digital-to-analog conversion and the corresponding demodulation or detection as analog-to-digital conversion. The changes in the carrier signal are chosen from a finite number of M alternative symbols (the &quot;modulation alphabet&quot;).

A simple example: A telephone line is designed for transferring audible sounds, for example, tones, and not digital bits (zeros and ones). Computers may, however, communicate over a telephone line by means of modems, which are representing the digital bits by tones, called symbols. If there are four alternative symbols (corresponding to a musical instrument that can generate four different tones, one at a time), the first symbol may represent the bit sequence 00, the second 01, the third 10 and the fourth 11. If the modem plays a melody consisting of 1000 tones per second, the symbol rate is 1000 symbols/second, or 1000 baud. Since each tone (i.e., symbol) represents a message consisting of two digital bits in this example, the bit rate is twice the symbol rate, i.e. 2000 bits per second.

According to one definition of digital signal, the modulated signal is a digital signal. According to another definition, the modulation is a form of digital-to-analog conversion. Most textbooks would consider digital modulation schemes as a form of digital transmission, synonymous to data transmission; very few would consider it as analog transmission.

The most fundamental digital modulation techniques are based on keying:
* PSK (phase-shift keying): a finite number of phases are used.
* FSK (frequency-shift keying): a finite number of frequencies are used.
* ASK (amplitude-shift keying): a finite number of amplitudes are used.
* QAM (quadrature amplitude modulation): a finite number of at least two phases and at least two amplitudes are used.

In QAM, an in-phase signal (or I, with one example being a cosine waveform) and a quadrature phase signal (or Q, with an example being a sine wave) are amplitude modulated with a finite number of amplitudes and then summed. It can be seen as a two-channel system, each channel using ASK. The resulting signal is equivalent to a combination of PSK and ASK.

In all of the above methods, each of these phases, frequencies or amplitudes are assigned a unique pattern of binary bits. Usually, each phase, frequency or amplitude encodes an equal number of bits. This number of bits comprises the &quot;symbol&quot; that is represented by the particular phase, frequency or amplitude.

If the alphabet consists of formula_1 alternative symbols, each symbol represents a message consisting of &quot;N&quot; bits. If the symbol rate (also known as the baud rate) is formula_2 symbols/second (or baud), the data rate is formula_3 bit/second.

For example, with an alphabet consisting of 16 alternative symbols, each symbol represents 4 bits. Thus, the data rate is four times the baud rate.

In the case of PSK, ASK or QAM, where the carrier frequency of the modulated signal is constant, the modulation alphabet is often conveniently represented on a constellation diagram, showing the amplitude of the I signal at the x-axis, and the amplitude of the Q signal at the y-axis, for each symbol.

===Modulator and detector principles of operation===
PSK and ASK, and sometimes also FSK, are often generated and detected using the principle of QAM. The I and Q signals can be combined into a complex-valued signal &quot;I&quot;+&quot;jQ&quot; (where &quot;j&quot; is the imaginary unit). The resulting so called equivalent lowpass signal or equivalent baseband signal is a complex-valued representation of the real-valued modulated physical signal (the so-called passband signal or RF signal).

These are the general steps used by the modulator to transmit data:
# Group the incoming data bits into codewords, one for each symbol that will be transmitted.
# Map the codewords to attributes, for example, amplitudes of the I and Q signals (the equivalent low pass signal), or frequency or phase values.
# Adapt pulse shaping or some other filtering to limit the bandwidth and form the spectrum of the equivalent low pass signal, typically using digital signal processing.
# Perform digital to analog conversion (DAC) of the I and Q signals (since today all of the above is normally achieved using digital signal processing, DSP).
# Generate a high-frequency sine carrier waveform, and perhaps also a cosine quadrature component. Carry out the modulation, for example by multiplying the sine and cosine waveform with the I and Q signals, resulting in the equivalent low pass signal being frequency shifted to the modulated passband signal or RF signal. Sometimes this is achieved using DSP technology, for example direct digital synthesis using a waveform table, instead of analog signal processing. In that case, the above DAC step should be done after this step.
# Amplification and analog bandpass filtering to avoid harmonic distortion and periodic spectrum.

At the receiver side, the demodulator typically performs:
# Bandpass filtering.
# Automatic gain control, AGC (to compensate for attenuation, for example fading).
# Frequency shifting of the RF signal to the equivalent baseband I and Q signals, or to an intermediate frequency (IF) signal, by multiplying the RF signal with a local oscillator sine wave and cosine wave frequency (see the superheterodyne receiver principle).
# Sampling and analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) (sometimes before or instead of the above point, for example by means of undersampling).
# Equalization filtering, for example, a matched filter, compensation for multipath propagation, time spreading, phase distortion and frequency selective fading, to avoid intersymbol interference and symbol distortion.
# Detection of the amplitudes of the I and Q signals, or the frequency or phase of the IF signal.
# Quantization of the amplitudes, frequencies or phases to the nearest allowed symbol values.
# Mapping of the quantized amplitudes, frequencies or phases to codewords (bit groups).
# Parallel-to-serial conversion of the codewords into a bit stream.
# Pass the resultant bit stream on for further processing such as removal of any error-correcting codes.

As is common to all digital communication systems, the design of both the modulator and demodulator must be done simultaneously. Digital modulation schemes are possible because the transmitter-receiver pair has prior knowledge of how data is encoded and represented in the communications system. In all digital communication systems, both the modulator at the transmitter and the demodulator at the receiver are structured so that they perform inverse operations.

Asynchronous methods do not require a receiver reference clock signal that is phase synchronized with the sender carrier signal. In this case, modulation symbols (rather than bits, characters, or data packets) are asynchronously transferred. The opposite is synchronous modulation.

===List of common digital modulation techniques===
The most common digital modulation techniques are:
* Phase-shift keying (PSK)
** Binary PSK (BPSK), using M=2 symbols
** Quadrature PSK (QPSK), using M=4 symbols
** 8PSK, using M=8 symbols
** 16PSK, using M=16 symbols
** Differential PSK (DPSK)
** Differential QPSK (DQPSK)
** Offset QPSK (OQPSK)
** π/4–QPSK
* Frequency-shift keying (FSK)
** Audio frequency-shift keying (AFSK)
** Multi-frequency shift keying (M-ary FSK or MFSK)
** Dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF)
* Amplitude-shift keying (ASK)
* On-off keying (OOK), the most common ASK form
** M-ary vestigial sideband modulation, for example 8VSB
* Quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), a combination of PSK and ASK
** Polar modulation like QAM a combination of PSK and ASK
* Continuous phase modulation (CPM) methods
** Minimum-shift keying (MSK)
** Gaussian minimum-shift keying (GMSK)
** Continuous-phase frequency-shift keying (CPFSK)
* Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation
** Discrete multitone (DMT), including adaptive modulation and bit-loading
* Wavelet modulation
* Trellis coded modulation (TCM), also known as Trellis modulation
* Spread spectrum techniques
** Direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS)
** Chirp spread spectrum (CSS) according to IEEE 802.15.4a CSS uses pseudo-stochastic coding
** Frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) applies a special scheme for channel release

MSK and GMSK are particular cases of continuous phase modulation. Indeed, MSK is a particular case of the sub-family of CPM known as continuous-phase frequency-shift keying (CPFSK) which is defined by a rectangular frequency pulse (i.e. a linearly increasing phase pulse) of one-symbol-time duration (total response signaling).

OFDM is based on the idea of frequency-division multiplexing (FDM), but the multiplexed streams are all parts of a single original stream. The bit stream is split into several parallel data streams, each transferred over its own sub-carrier using some conventional digital modulation scheme. The modulated sub-carriers are summed to form an OFDM signal. This dividing and recombining help with handling channel impairments. OFDM is considered as a modulation technique rather than a multiplex technique since it transfers one bit stream over one communication channel using one sequence of so-called OFDM symbols. OFDM can be extended to multi-user channel access method in the orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) and multi-carrier code-division multiple access (MC-CDMA) schemes, allowing several users to share the same physical medium by giving different sub-carriers or spreading codes to different users.

Of the two kinds of RF power amplifier, switching amplifiers (Class D amplifiers) cost less and use less battery power than linear amplifiers of the same output power. However, they only work with relatively constant-amplitude-modulation signals such as angle modulation (FSK or PSK) and CDMA, but not with QAM and OFDM. Nevertheless, even though switching amplifiers are completely unsuitable for normal QAM constellations, often the QAM modulation principle are used to drive switching amplifiers with these FM and other waveforms, and sometimes QAM demodulators are used to receive the signals put out by these switching amplifiers.

===Automatic digital modulation recognition (ADMR)===
Automatic digital modulation recognition in intelligent communication systems is one of the most important issues in software-defined radio and cognitive radio. According to incremental expanse of intelligent receivers, automatic modulation recognition becomes a challenging topic in telecommunication systems and computer engineering. Such systems have many civil and military applications. Moreover, blind recognition of modulation type is an important problem in commercial systems, especially in software-defined radio. Usually in such systems, there are some extra information for system configuration, but considering blind approaches in intelligent receivers, we can reduce information overload and increase transmission performance. Obviously, with no knowledge of the transmitted data and many unknown parameters at the receiver, such as the signal power, carrier frequency and phase offsets, timing information, etc., blind identification of the modulation is made fairly difficult. This becomes even more challenging in real-world scenarios with multipath fading, frequency-selective and time-varying channels.

There are two main approaches to automatic modulation recognition. The first approach uses likelihood-based methods to assign an input signal to a proper class. Another recent approach is based on feature extraction.

===Digital baseband modulation===
Digital baseband modulation changes the characteristics of a baseband signal, i.e., one without a carrier at a higher frequency.

This can be used as equivalent signal to be later frequency-converted to a carrier frequency, or for direct communication in baseband. The latter methods both involve relatively simple line codes, as often used in local buses, and complicated baseband signalling schemes such as used in DSL.

==Pulse modulation methods==
Pulse modulation schemes aim at transferring a narrowband analog signal over an analog baseband channel as a two-level signal by modulating a pulse wave. Some pulse modulation schemes also allow the narrowband analog signal to be transferred as a digital signal (i.e., as a quantized discrete-time signal) with a fixed bit rate, which can be transferred over an underlying digital transmission system, for example, some line code. These are not modulation schemes in the conventional sense since they are not channel coding schemes, but should be considered as source coding schemes, and in some cases analog-to-digital conversion techniques.

;Analog-over-analog methods
* Pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM)
* Pulse-width modulation (PWM) and pulse-depth modulation (PDM)
* Pulse-frequency modulation (PFM)
* Pulse-position modulation (PPM)

;Analog-over-digital methods
* Pulse-code modulation (PCM)
** Differential PCM (DPCM)
*** Adaptive DPCM (ADPCM)
* Delta modulation (DM or Δ-modulation)
** Delta-sigma modulation (ΣΔ)
** Continuously variable slope delta modulation (CVSDM), also called adaptive delta modulation (ADM)
* Pulse-density modulation (PDM)

==Miscellaneous modulation techniques==
* The use of on-off keying to transmit Morse code at radio frequencies is known as continuous wave (CW) operation.
* Adaptive modulation
* Space modulation is a method whereby signals are modulated within airspace such as that used in instrument landing systems.
* The microwave auditory effect has been pulse modulated with audio waveforms to evoke understandable spoken numbers.

<text>macOS, originally Mac OS X, previously shortened as OS X, is a Unix-like operating system developed and marketed by Apple since 2001. It is the primary operating system for Apple&#x27;s Mac computers. Within the market of desktop and laptop computers, it is the second most widely used desktop OS, after Microsoft Windows and ahead of all Linux distributions, including ChromeOS and SteamOS. , the most recent release of macOS is macOS 15 Sequoia, the 21st major version of macOS.

Mac OS X succeeded classic Mac OS, the primary Macintosh operating system from 1984 to 2001. Its underlying architecture came from NeXT&#x27;s NeXTSTEP, as a result of Apple&#x27;s acquisition of NeXT, which also brought Steve Jobs back to Apple. The first desktop version, Mac OS X 10.0, was released on March 24, 2001. Mac OS X Leopard and all later versions of macOS, other than OS X Lion, are UNIX 03 certified. The derivatives of macOS are Apple&#x27;s other operating systems: iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, tvOS, and audioOS. macOS has supported three major processor architectures: originally PowerPC-based Macs in 1999; Intel Core-based Macs from 2006; and self-designed 64-bit Arm Apple M series Macs since 2020.

A prominent part of macOS&#x27;s original brand identity was the use of Roman numeral X, pronounced &quot;ten&quot;, as well as code naming each release after species of big cats, and later, places within California. Apple shortened the name to &quot;OS X&quot; in 2011 and then changed it to &quot;macOS&quot; in 2016 to align with the branding of Apple&#x27;s other operating systems. After 16 distinct versions of macOS 10, macOS Big Sur was presented as version 11 in 2020, and every subsequent version has also incremented the major version number, similarly to classic Mac OS and iOS, but is still named after places within California.

== History ==
=== Development ===

The heritage of what would become macOS had originated at NeXT, a company founded by Steve Jobs following his departure from Apple in 1985. There, the Unix-like NeXTSTEP operating system was developed, before being launched in 1989. The kernel of NeXTSTEP is based upon the Mach kernel, which was originally developed at Carnegie Mellon University, with additional kernel layers and low-level user space code derived from parts of FreeBSD and other BSD operating systems. Its graphical user interface was built on top of an object-oriented GUI toolkit using the programming language.

Throughout the 1990s, Apple had tried to create a &quot;next-generation&quot; OS to succeed its classic Mac OS through the Taligent, Copland and Gershwin projects, but all were eventually abandoned. This led Apple to acquire NeXT in 1997, allowing NeXTSTEP, later called OPENSTEP, to serve as the basis for Apple&#x27;s next generation operating system.
This purchase also led to Steve Jobs returning to Apple as an interim, and then the permanent CEO, shepherding the transformation of the programmer-friendly OPENSTEP into a system that would be adopted by Apple&#x27;s primary market of home users and creative professionals. The project was first codenamed &quot;Rhapsody&quot; before officially being named Mac OS X.

=== Mac OS X ===
The letter &quot;X&quot; in Mac OS X&#x27;s name refers to the number 10, a Roman numeral, and Apple has stated that it should be pronounced &quot;ten&quot; in this context. However, it is also commonly pronounced like the letter &quot;X&quot;. The iPhone X, iPhone XR and iPhone XS all later followed this convention.

Previous Macintosh operating systems (versions of the classic Mac OS) were named using Arabic numerals, as with Mac OS 8 and Mac OS 9. Until macOS 11 Big Sur, all versions of the operating system were given version numbers of the form 10.&quot;x&quot;, with this going from 10.0 up until 10.15; starting with macOS 11 Big Sur, Apple switched to numbering major releases with numbers that increase by 1 with every major release.

The first version of Mac OS X, Mac OS X Server 1.0, was a transitional product, featuring an interface resembling the classic Mac OS, though it was not compatible with software designed for the older system. Consumer releases of Mac OS X included more backward compatibility. Mac OS applications could be rewritten to run natively via the Carbon API; many could also be run directly through the Classic Environment with a reduction in performance.

The consumer version of Mac OS X was launched in 2001 with Mac OS X 10.0. Reviews were variable, with extensive praise for its sophisticated, glossy Aqua interface, but criticizing it for sluggish performance. With Apple&#x27;s popularity at a low, the maker of FrameMaker, Adobe Inc., declined to develop new versions of it for Mac OS X. &quot;Ars Technica&quot; columnist John Siracusa, who reviewed every major OS X release up to 10.10, described the early releases in retrospect as &quot;dog-slow, feature poor&quot; and Aqua as &quot;unbearably slow and a huge resource hog&quot;.

Apple rapidly developed several new releases of Mac OS X. Siracusa&#x27;s review of version 10.3, Panther, noted &quot;It&#x27;s strange to have gone from years of uncertainty and vaporware to a steady annual supply of major new operating system releases.&quot; Version 10.4, Tiger, reportedly shocked executives at Microsoft by offering a number of features, such as fast file searching and improved graphics processing, that Microsoft had spent several years struggling to add to Windows Vista with acceptable performance.

As the operating system evolved, it moved away from the classic Mac OS, with applications being added and removed. Considering music to be a key market, Apple developed the iPod music player and music software for the Mac, including iTunes and GarageBand. Targeting the consumer and media markets, Apple emphasized its new &quot;digital lifestyle&quot; applications such as the iLife suite, integrated home entertainment through the Front Row media center and the Safari web browser. With the increasing popularity of the internet, Apple offered additional online services, including the .Mac, MobileMe and most recently iCloud products. It later began selling third-party applications through the Mac App Store.

Newer versions of Mac OS X also included modifications to the general interface, moving away from the striped gloss and transparency of the initial versions. Some applications began to use a brushed metal appearance, or non-pinstriped title bar appearance in version 10.4. In Leopard, Apple announced a unification of the interface, with a standardized gray-gradient window style.

In 2006, the first Intel Macs were released with a specialized version of Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger.

A key development for the system was the announcement and release of the iPhone from 2007 onwards. While Apple&#x27;s previous iPod media players used a minimal operating system, the iPhone used an operating system based on Mac OS X, which would later be called &quot;iPhone OS&quot; and then iOS. The simultaneous release of two operating systems based on the same frameworks placed tension on Apple, which cited the iPhone as forcing it to delay Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard. However, after Apple opened the iPhone to third-party developers its commercial success drew attention to Mac OS X, with many iPhone software developers showing interest in Mac development.

In 2007, Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard was the sole release with universal binary components, allowing installation on both Intel Macs and select PowerPC Macs. It is also the final release with PowerPC Mac support. Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard was the first version of Mac OS X to be built exclusively for Intel Macs, and the final release with 32-bit Intel Mac support. The name was intended to signal its status as an iteration of Leopard, focusing on technical and performance improvements rather than user-facing features; indeed it was explicitly branded to developers as being a &#x27;no new features&#x27; release. Since its release, several OS X or macOS releases (namely OS X Mountain Lion, OS X El Capitan, macOS High Sierra, and macOS Monterey) follow this pattern, with a name derived from its predecessor, similar to the &#x27;tick–tock model&#x27; used by Intel.

In two succeeding versions, Lion and Mountain Lion, Apple moved some applications to a highly skeuomorphic style of design inspired by contemporary versions of iOS while simplifying some elements by making controls such as scroll bars fade out when not in use. This direction was, like brushed metal interfaces, unpopular with some users, although it continued a trend of greater animation and variety in the interface previously seen in design aspects such as the Time Machine backup utility, which presented past file versions against a swirling nebula, and the glossy translucent dock of Leopard and Snow Leopard. In addition, with Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, Apple ceased to release separate server versions of Mac OS X, selling server tools as a separate downloadable application through the Mac App Store. A review described the trend in the server products as becoming &quot;cheaper and simpler... shifting its focus from large businesses to small ones.&quot;

=== OS X ===

In 2012, with the release of OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, the name of the system was officially shortened from Mac OS X to OS X, after the previous version shortened the system name in a similar fashion a year prior. That year, Apple removed the head of OS X development, Scott Forstall, and design was changed towards a more minimal direction. Apple&#x27;s new user interface design, using deep color saturation, text-only buttons and a minimal, &#x27;flat&#x27; interface, was debuted with iOS 7 in 2013. With OS X engineers reportedly working on iOS 7, the version released in 2013, OS X 10.9 Mavericks, was something of a transitional release, with some of the skeuomorphic design removed, while most of the general interface of Mavericks remained unchanged. The next version, OS X 10.10 Yosemite, adopted a design similar to iOS 7 but with greater complexity suitable for an interface controlled with a mouse.

From 2012 onwards, the system has shifted to an annual release schedule similar to that of iOS and Mac OS X releases prior to 10.4 Tiger. It also steadily cut the cost of updates from Snow Leopard onwards, before removing upgrade fees altogether in OS X Mavericks. Some journalists and third-party software developers have suggested that this decision, while allowing more rapid feature release, meant less opportunity to focus on stability, with no version of OS X recommendable for users requiring stability and performance above new features. Apple&#x27;s 2015 update, OS X 10.11 El Capitan, was announced to focus specifically on stability and performance improvements.

=== macOS ===

In 2016, with the release of macOS 10.12 Sierra, the name was changed from OS X to macOS with the purpose of aligning it with the branding of Apple&#x27;s other primary operating systems: iOS, watchOS, and tvOS. macOS Sierra added Siri, iCloud Drive, picture-in-picture support, a Night Shift mode that switches the display to warmer colors at night, and two Continuity features: Universal Clipboard, which syncs a user&#x27;s clipboard across their Apple devices, and Auto Unlock, which can unlock a user&#x27;s Mac with their Apple Watch. macOS Sierra also adds support for the Apple File System (APFS), Apple&#x27;s successor to the dated HFS+ file system. macOS 10.13 High Sierra, released in 2017, included performance improvements, Metal 2 and HEVC support, and made APFS the default file system for SSD boot drives.

Its successor, macOS 10.14 Mojave, was released in 2018, adding a dark mode option and a dynamic wallpaper setting. It was succeeded by macOS 10.15 Catalina in 2019, which replaces iTunes with separate apps for different types of media, and introduces the Catalyst system for porting iOS apps.

In 2020, Apple announced macOS 11 Big Sur at that year&#x27;s WWDC. This was the first increment in the primary version number of macOS since the release of Mac OS X Public Beta in 2000; updates to macOS 11 were given 11.x numbers, matching the version numbering scheme used by Apple&#x27;s other operating systems. Big Sur brought major changes to the user interface and was the first version to run on Apple Silicon, based on the ARM architecture. The numbering system started with Big Sur continued in 2021 with macOS 12 Monterey, 2022 with macOS 13 Ventura, 2023 with macOS 14 Sonoma, and 2024 with macOS 15 Sequoia.

=== Timeline of releases ===
== Architecture ==

At macOS&#x27;s core is a POSIX-compliant operating system built on top of the XNU kernel, (which incorporated large parts of FreeBSD kernel) and FreeBSD userland for the standard Unix facilities available from the command line interface. Apple has released this family of software as a free and open source operating system named Darwin. On top of Darwin, Apple layered a number of components, including the Aqua interface and the Finder, to complete the GUI-based operating system which is macOS.

With its original introduction as Mac OS X, the system brought a number of new capabilities to provide a more stable and reliable platform than its predecessor, the classic Mac OS. For example, pre-emptive multitasking and memory protection improved the system&#x27;s ability to run multiple applications simultaneously without them interrupting or corrupting each other. Many aspects of macOS&#x27;s architecture are derived from OPENSTEP, which was designed to be portable, to ease the transition from one platform to another. For example, NeXTSTEP was ported from the original 68k-based NeXT workstations to x86 and other architectures before NeXT was purchased by Apple, and OPENSTEP was later ported to the PowerPC architecture as part of the Rhapsody project.

Prior to macOS High Sierra, and on drives other than solid state drives (SSDs), the default file system is HFS+, which it inherited from the classic Mac OS. Operating system designer Linus Torvalds had criticized HFS+, saying it is &quot;probably the worst file system ever&quot;, whose design is &quot;actively corrupting user data&quot;. He criticized the case insensitivity of file names, a design made worse when Apple extended the file system to support Unicode.

The Darwin subsystem in macOS manages the file system, which includes the Unix permissions layer. In 2003 and 2005, two Macworld editors expressed criticism of the permission scheme; Ted Landau called misconfigured permissions &quot;the most common frustration&quot; in macOS, while Rob Griffiths suggested that some users may even have to reset permissions every day, a process which can take up to 15 minutes. More recently, another Macworld editor, Dan Frakes, called the procedure of repairing permissions vastly overused. He argues that macOS typically handles permissions properly without user interference, and resetting permissions should only be tried when problems emerge.

The architecture of macOS incorporates a layered design:
the layered frameworks aid rapid development of applications by providing existing code for common tasks. Apple provides its own software development tools, most prominently an integrated development environment called Xcode. Xcode provides interfaces to compilers that support several programming languages including C, C++, Objective-C, and Swift. For the Mac transition to Intel processors, it was modified so that developers could build their applications as a universal binary, which provides compatibility with both the Intel-based and PowerPC-based Macintosh lines. First and third-party applications can be controlled programmatically using the AppleScript framework, retained from the classic Mac OS, or using the newer Automator application that offers pre-written tasks that do not require programming knowledge.

=== Software compatibility ===
Apple offered two main APIs to develop software natively for macOS: Cocoa and Carbon. Cocoa was a descendant of APIs inherited from OPENSTEP with no ancestry from the classic Mac OS, while Carbon was an adaptation of classic Mac OS APIs, allowing Mac software to be minimally rewritten to run natively on Mac OS X.

The Cocoa API was created as the result of a 1993 collaboration between NeXT Computer and Sun Microsystems. This heritage is highly visible for Cocoa developers, since the &quot;NS&quot; prefix is ubiquitous in the framework, standing variously for NeXTSTEP or NeXT/Sun. The official OPENSTEP API, published in September 1994, was the first to split the API between Foundation and ApplicationKit and the first to use the &quot;NS&quot; prefix. Traditionally, Cocoa programs have been mostly written in Objective-C, with Java as an alternative. However, on July 11, 2005, Apple announced that &quot;features added to Cocoa in Mac OS X versions later than 10.4 will not be added to the Cocoa-Java programming interface.&quot; macOS also used to support the Java Platform as a &quot;preferred software package&quot;—in practice this means that applications written in Java fit as neatly into the operating system as possible while still being cross-platform compatible, and that graphical user interfaces written in Swing look almost exactly like native Cocoa interfaces. Since 2014, Apple has promoted its new programming language Swift as the preferred language for software development on Apple platforms.

Apple&#x27;s original plan with macOS was to require all developers to rewrite their software into the Cocoa APIs. This caused much outcry among existing Mac developers, who threatened to abandon the platform rather than invest in a costly rewrite, and the idea was shelved. To permit a smooth transition from Mac OS 9 to Mac OS X, the Carbon Application Programming Interface (API) was created. Applications written with Carbon were initially able to run natively on both classic Mac OS and Mac OS X, although this ability was later dropped as Mac OS X developed. Carbon was not included in the first product sold as Mac OS X: the little-used original release of Mac OS X Server 1.0, which also did not include the Aqua interface. Apple limited further development of Carbon from the release of Leopard onwards and announced that Carbon applications would not run at 64-bit. A number of macOS applications continued to use Carbon for some time afterwards, especially ones with heritage dating back to the classic Mac OS and for which updates would be difficult, uneconomic or not necessary. This included Microsoft Office up to Office 2016, and Photoshop up to CS5. Early versions of macOS could also run some classic Mac OS applications through the Classic Environment with performance limitations; this feature was removed from 10.5 onwards and all Macs using Intel processors.

Because macOS is POSIX compliant, many software packages written for the other Unix-like systems including Linux can be recompiled to run on it, including many scientific and technical programs. Third-party projects such as Homebrew, Fink, MacPorts and pkgsrc provide pre-compiled or pre-formatted packages. Apple and others have provided versions of the X Window System graphical interface which can allow these applications to run with an approximation of the macOS look-and-feel. The current Apple-endorsed method is the open-source XQuartz project; earlier versions could use the X11 application provided by Apple, or before that the XDarwin project.

Applications can be distributed to Macs and installed by the user from any source and by any method such as downloading (with or without code signing, available via an Apple developer account) or through the Mac App Store, a marketplace of software maintained by Apple through a process requiring the company&#x27;s approval. Apps installed through the Mac App Store run within a sandbox, restricting their ability to exchange information with other applications or modify the core operating system and its features. This has been cited as an advantage, by allowing users to install apps with confidence that they should not be able to damage their system, but also as a disadvantage due to blocking the Mac App Store&#x27;s use for professional applications that require elevated privileges. Applications without any code signature cannot be run by default except from a computer&#x27;s administrator account.

Apple produces macOS applications. Some are included with macOS and some sold separately. This includes iWork, Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, iLife, and the database application FileMaker. Numerous other developers also offer software for macOS.

In 2018, Apple introduced an application layer, codenamed Marzipan, to port iOS apps to macOS. macOS Mojave included ports of four first-party iOS apps including Home and News, and it was announced that the API would be available for third-party developers to use from 2019. With macOS Catalina in 2019, the application layer was made available to third-party developers as Mac Catalyst.

=== Hardware compatibility ===
List of macOS versions, the supported systems on which they run, and their RAM requirements

Tools such as XPostFacto and patches applied to the installation media have been developed by third parties to enable installation of newer versions of macOS on systems not officially supported by Apple. This includes a number of pre-G3 Power Macintosh systems that can be made to run up to and including Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar, all G3-based Macs which can run up to and including Tiger, and sub-867 MHz G4 Macs can run Leopard by removing the restriction from the installation DVD or entering a command in the Mac&#x27;s Open Firmware interface to tell the Leopard Installer that it has a clock rate of 867 MHz or greater. Except for features requiring specific hardware such as graphics acceleration or DVD writing, the operating system offers the same functionality on all supported hardware.

As most Mac hardware components, or components similar to those, since the Intel transition are available for purchase, some technology-capable groups have developed software to install macOS on non-Apple computers. These are referred to as Hackintoshes, a portmanteau of the words &quot;hack&quot; and &quot;Macintosh&quot;. This violates Apple&#x27;s EULA (and is therefore unsupported by Apple technical support, warranties etc.), but communities that cater to personal users, who do not install for resale and profit, have generally been ignored by Apple. These self-made computers allow more flexibility and customization of hardware, but at a cost of leaving the user more responsible for their own machine, such as on matter of data integrity or security. Psystar, a business that attempted to profit from selling macOS on non-Apple certified hardware, was sued by Apple in 2008.

In April 2002, eWeek announced a rumor that Apple had a version of Mac OS X code-named Marklar, which ran on Intel x86 processors. The idea behind Marklar was to keep Mac OS X running on an alternative platform should Apple become dissatisfied with the progress of the PowerPC platform. These rumors subsided until late in May 2005, when various media outlets, such as &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and CNET, announced that Apple would unveil Marklar in the coming months.

On June 6, 2005, Steve Jobs announced in his keynote address at WWDC that Apple would be making the transition from PowerPC to Intel processors over the following two years, and that Mac OS X would support both platforms during the transition. Jobs also confirmed rumors that Apple had versions of Mac OS X running on Intel processors for most of its developmental life. Intel-based Macs would run a new recompiled version of OS X along with Rosetta, a binary translation layer which enables software compiled for PowerPC Mac OS X to run on Intel Mac OS X machines. The system was included with Mac OS X versions up to version 10.6.8. Apple dropped support for Classic mode on the new Intel Macs. Third party emulation software such as Mini vMac, Basilisk II and SheepShaver provided support for some early versions of Mac OS. A new version of Xcode and the underlying command-line compilers supported building universal binaries that would run on either architecture.

PowerPC-only software is supported with Apple&#x27;s official binary translation software, Rosetta, though applications eventually had to be rewritten to run properly on the newer versions released for Intel processors. Apple initially encouraged developers to produce universal binaries with support for both PowerPC and Intel. PowerPC binaries suffer a performance penalty when run on Intel Macs through Rosetta. Moreover, some PowerPC software, such as kernel extensions and System Preferences plugins, are not supported on Intel Macs at all. Plugins for Safari need to be compiled for the same platform as Safari, so when Safari is running on Intel, it requires plug-ins that have been compiled as Intel-only or universal binaries, so PowerPC-only plug-ins will not work. While Intel Macs can run PowerPC, Intel, and universal binaries, PowerPC Macs support only universal and PowerPC builds.

Support for the PowerPC platform was dropped following the transition. In 2009, Apple announced at WWDC that Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard would drop support for PowerPC processors and be Intel-only. Rosetta continued to be offered as an optional download or installation choice in Snow Leopard before it was discontinued with Mac OS X 10.7 Lion. In addition, new versions of Mac OS X first- and third-party software increasingly required Intel processors, including new versions of iLife, iWork, Aperture and Logic Pro.

=== Intel–Apple silicon transition ===
Rumors of Apple shifting Macs from Intel to in-house ARM processors used by iOS devices began circulating as early as 2011, and ebbed and flowed throughout the 2010s. Rumors intensified in 2020, when numerous reports announced that the company would announce its shift to its custom processors at WWDC.

Apple officially announced its shift to processors designed in-house on June 22, 2020, at WWDC 2020, with the transition planned to last for approximately two years. The first release of macOS to support ARM was macOS Big Sur. Big Sur and later versions support Universal 2 binaries, which are applications consisting of both Intel (x86-64) and Apple silicon (AArch64) binaries; when launched, only the appropriate binary is run. Additionally, Intel binaries can be run on Apple silicon-based Macs using the Rosetta 2 binary translation software. The transition was completed at WWDC 2023 with the announce of the Apple silicon Mac Pro, ending the transition in 3 years, slightly behind schedule.

The change in processor architecture allows Macs with ARM processors to be able to run iOS and iPadOS apps natively.

== Features ==
=== Aqua user interface ===

One of the major differences between the classic Mac OS and the current macOS was the addition of Aqua, a graphical user interface with water-like elements, in the first major release of Mac OS X. Every window element, text, graphic, or widget is drawn on-screen using spatial anti-aliasing technology. ColorSync, a technology introduced many years before, was improved and built into the core drawing engine, to provide color matching for printing and multimedia professionals. Also, drop shadows were added around windows and isolated text elements to provide a sense of depth. New interface elements were integrated, including sheets (dialog boxes attached to specific windows) and drawers, which would slide out and provide options.

The use of soft edges, translucent colors, and pinstripes, similar to the hardware design of the first iMacs, brought more texture and color to the user interface when compared to what Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X Server 1.0&#x27;s &quot;Platinum&quot; appearance had offered. According to Siracusa, the introduction of Aqua and its departure from the then conventional look &quot;hit like a ton of bricks.&quot;
Bruce Tognazzini (who founded the original Apple Human Interface Group) said that the Aqua interface in Mac OS X 10.0 represented a step backwards in usability compared with the original Mac OS interface.
Third-party developers started producing skins for customizable applications and other operating systems which mimicked the Aqua appearance. To some extent, Apple has used the successful transition to this new design as leverage, at various times threatening legal action against people who make or distribute software with an interface the company says is derived from its copyrighted design.

Apple has continued to change aspects of the macOS appearance and design, particularly with tweaks to the appearance of windows and the menu bar. Since 2012, Apple has sold almost all of its Mac models with high-resolution Retina displays, and macOS and its APIs have extensive support for resolution-independent development on supporting high-resolution displays. Reviewers have described Apple&#x27;s support for the technology as superior to that on Windows.

The human interface guidelines published by Apple for macOS are followed by many applications, giving them consistent user interface and keyboard shortcuts. In addition, new services for applications are included, which include spelling and grammar checkers, special characters palette, color picker, font chooser and dictionary; these global features are present in every Cocoa application, adding consistency. The graphics system OpenGL composites windows onto the screen to allow hardware-accelerated drawing. This technology, introduced in version 10.2, is called Quartz Extreme, a component of Quartz. Quartz&#x27;s internal imaging model correlates well with the Portable Document Format (PDF) imaging model, making it easy to output PDF to multiple devices. As a side result, PDF viewing and creating PDF documents from any application are built-in features. Reflecting its popularity with design users, macOS also has system support for a variety of professional video and image formats and includes an extensive pre-installed font library, featuring many prominent brand-name designs.

=== Built-in components ===
The Finder is a file browser allowing quick access to all areas of the computer, which has been modified throughout subsequent releases of macOS. Quick Look has been part of the Finder since version 10.5. It allows for dynamic previews of files, including videos and multi-page documents without opening any other applications. Spotlight, a file searching technology which has been integrated into the Finder since version 10.4, allows rapid real-time searches of data files; mail messages; photos; and other information based on item properties (metadata) or content. macOS makes use of a Dock, which holds file and folder shortcuts as well as minimized windows.

Apple added Exposé in version 10.3 (called Mission Control since version 10.7), a feature which includes three functions to help accessibility between windows and desktop. Its functions are to instantly reveal all open windows as thumbnails for easy navigation to different tasks, display all open windows as thumbnails from the current application, and hide all windows to access the desktop. FileVault is optional encryption of the user&#x27;s files with the 128-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-128).

Features introduced in version 10.4 include Automator, an application designed to create an automatic workflow for different tasks; Dashboard, a full-screen group of small applications called desktop widgets that can be called up and dismissed in one keystroke; and Front Row, a media viewer interface accessed by the Apple Remote. Sync Services allows applications to access a centralized extensible database for various elements of user data, including calendar and contact items. The operating system then managed conflicting edits and data consistency.

All system icons are scalable up to 512×512 pixels as of version 10.5 to accommodate various places where they appear in larger size, including for example the Cover Flow view, a three-dimensional graphical user interface included with iTunes, the Finder, and other Apple products for visually skimming through files and digital media libraries via cover artwork. That version also introduced Spaces, a virtual desktop implementation which enables the user to have more than one desktop and display them in an Exposé-like interface; an automatic backup technology called Time Machine, which allows users to view and restore previous versions of files and application data; and Screen Sharing was built in for the first time.

In more recent releases, Apple has developed support for emoji characters by including the proprietary Apple Color Emoji font. Apple has also connected macOS with social networks such as Twitter and Facebook through the addition of share buttons for content such as pictures and text. Apple has brought several applications and features that originally debuted in iOS, its mobile operating system, to macOS in recent releases, notably the intelligent personal assistant Siri, which was introduced in version 10.12 of macOS.

=== Multilingual support ===
There are 47 system languages available in macOS for the user at the moment of installation; the system language is used throughout the entire operating system environment. Input methods for typing in dozens of scripts can be chosen independently of the system language. Recent updates have added increased support for Chinese characters and interconnections with popular social networks in China.

=== Updating methods ===
macOS can be updated using the Software Update settings pane in System Settings or the codice_1 command line utility. Until OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, a separate Software Update application performed this functionality. In Mountain Lion and later, this was merged into the Mac App Store application, although the underlying update mechanism remains unchanged and is fundamentally different from the download mechanism used when purchasing an App Store application. In macOS 10.14 Mojave, the updating function was moved again to the Software Update settings pane.

Most Macs receive six or seven years of macOS updates. After a new major release of macOS, the previous two releases still receive occasional updates, but many security vulnerabilities are only patched in the latest macOS release.

== Release history ==

Timeline of versions

Mac OS X versions were named after big cats, with the exception of Mac OS X Server 1.0 and the original public beta, from Mac OS X 10.0 until OS X 10.9 Mavericks, when Apple switched to using California locations. Prior to its release, version 10.0 was code named internally at Apple as &quot;Cheetah&quot;, and Mac OS X 10.1 was code named internally as &quot;Puma&quot;. After the immense buzz surrounding Mac OS X 10.2, codenamed &quot;Jaguar&quot;, Apple&#x27;s product marketing began openly using the code names to promote the operating system. Mac OS X 10.3 was marketed as &quot;Panther&quot;, Mac OS X 10.4 as &quot;Tiger&quot;, Mac OS X 10.5 as &quot;Leopard&quot;, Mac OS X 10.6 as &quot;Snow Leopard&quot;, Mac OS X 10.7 as &quot;Lion&quot;, OS X 10.8 as &quot;Mountain Lion&quot;, and OS X 10.9 as &quot;Mavericks&quot;.

&quot;Panther&quot;, &quot;Tiger&quot; and &quot;Leopard&quot; are registered as trademarks of Apple, but &quot;Cheetah&quot;, &quot;Puma&quot; and &quot;Jaguar&quot; have never been registered. Apple has also registered &quot;Lynx&quot; and &quot;Cougar&quot; as trademarks, though these were allowed to lapse. Computer retailer Tiger Direct sued Apple for its use of the name &quot;Tiger&quot;. On May 16, 2005, a US federal court in the Southern District of Florida ruled that Apple&#x27;s use did not infringe on Tiger Direct&#x27;s trademark.

=== Mac OS X Public Beta ===
On September 13, 2000, Apple released a US$29.95 &quot;preview&quot; version of Mac OS X, internally codenamed Kodiak, to gain feedback from users.

The &quot;PB&quot;, as it was known, marked the first public availability of the Aqua interface and Apple made many changes to the UI based on customer feedback. Mac OS X Public Beta expired and ceased to function in Spring 2001.

=== Mac OS X 10.0 ===
On March 24, 2001, Apple released Mac OS X 10.0 (internally codenamed Cheetah).
The initial version was slow, incomplete, and had very few applications available at launch, mostly from independent developers. While many critics suggested that the operating system was not ready for mainstream adoption, they recognized the importance of its initial launch as a base on which to improve. Simply releasing Mac OS X was received by the Macintosh community as a great accomplishment, for attempts to overhaul the Mac OS had been underway since 1996, and delayed by countless setbacks.

=== Mac OS X 10.1 ===
Later that year, on September 25, 2001, Mac OS X 10.1 (internally codenamed Puma) was released. It featured increased performance and provided missing features, such as DVD playback. Apple released 10.1 as a free upgrade CD for 10.0 users, in addition to the $129 boxed version for people running Mac OS 9. It was discovered that the upgrade CDs were full install CDs that could be used with Mac OS 9 systems by removing a specific file; Apple later re-released the CDs in an actual stripped-down format that did not facilitate installation on such systems. On January 7, 2002, Apple announced that Mac OS X was to be the default operating system for all Macintosh products by the end of that month.

=== Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar ===
On August 23, 2002, Apple followed up with Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar, the first release to use its code name as part of the branding.
It brought significant performance improvements, and an updated version of Aqua&#x27;s visual design. Jaguar also included over 150 new user-facing features, including Quartz Extreme for compositing graphics directly on an ATI Radeon or Nvidia GeForce2 MX AGP-based video card with at least 16 MB of VRAM, a system-wide repository for contact information in the new Address Book, and the iChat instant messaging client. The Happy Mac icon — which had appeared during the Mac OS startup sequence since the original Macintosh — was replaced with a grey Apple logo.

=== Mac OS X 10.3 Panther ===
Mac OS X v10.3 Panther was released on October 24, 2003. It significantly improved performance and incorporated the most extensive update yet to the user interface. Panther included as many or more new features as Jaguar had the year before, including an updated Finder, incorporating a brushed-metal interface, Fast user switching, Exposé (Window manager), FileVault, Safari, iChat AV (which added video conferencing features to iChat), improved Portable Document Format (PDF) rendering and much greater Microsoft Windows interoperability. Support for some early G3 computers such as &quot;beige&quot; Power Macs and &quot;WallStreet&quot; PowerBooks was discontinued.

=== Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger ===

Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger was released on April 29, 2005. Apple stated that Tiger contained more than 200 new features. As with Panther, certain older machines were no longer supported; Tiger requires a Mac with 256 MB and a built-in FireWire port. Among the new features, Tiger introduced Spotlight, Dashboard, Smart Folders, updated Mail program with Smart Mailboxes, QuickTime 7, Safari 2, Automator, VoiceOver, Core Image and Core Video. The initial release of the Apple TV used a modified version of Tiger with a different graphical interface and fewer applications and services. On January 10, 2006, Apple released the first Intel-based Macs along with the 10.4.4 update to Tiger. This operating system functioned identically on the PowerPC-based Macs and the new Intel-based machines, with the exception of the Intel release lacking support for the Classic environment.

=== Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard ===
Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard was released on October 26, 2007. It was called by Apple &quot;the largest update of Mac OS X&quot;. It brought more than 300 new features. Leopard supports both PowerPC- and Intel x86-based Macintosh computers; support for the G3 processor was dropped and the G4 processor required a minimum clock rate of 867 MHz, and at least 512 MB of RAM to be installed. The single DVD works for all supported Macs (including 64-bit machines). New features include a new look, an updated Finder, Time Machine, Spaces, Boot Camp pre-installed, full support for 64-bit applications (including graphical applications), new features in Mail and iChat, and a number of new security features. Leopard is an Open Brand UNIX 03 registered product on the Intel platform. It was also the first BSD-based OS to receive UNIX 03 certification. Leopard dropped support for the Classic Environment and all Classic applications. It was the final version of Mac OS X to support the PowerPC architecture.

=== Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard ===
Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard was released on August 28, 2009. Rather than delivering big changes to the appearance and end user functionality like the previous releases of , Snow Leopard focused on &quot;under the hood&quot; changes, increasing the performance, efficiency, and stability of the operating system. For most users, the most noticeable changes were: the disk space that the operating system frees up after a clean install compared to Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, a more responsive Finder rewritten in Cocoa, faster Time Machine backups, more reliable and user-friendly disk ejects, a more powerful version of the Preview application, as well as a faster Safari web browser. Snow Leopard only supported machines with Intel CPUs, required at least 1 GB of RAM, and dropped default support for applications built for the PowerPC architecture (Rosetta could be installed as an additional component to retain support for PowerPC-only applications).

Snow Leopard also featured new 64-bit technology capable of supporting greater amounts of RAM, improved support for multi-core processors through Grand Central Dispatch, and advanced GPU performance with OpenCL.

The 10.6.6 update introduced support for the Mac App Store, Apple&#x27;s digital distribution platform for macOS applications.

=== OS X 10.7 Lion ===
OS X 10.7 Lion was released on July 20, 2011. It brought developments made in Apple&#x27;s iOS, such as an easily navigable display of installed applications called Launchpad and a greater use of multi-touch gestures, to the Mac. This release removed Rosetta, making it incompatible with PowerPC applications.

Changes made to the GUI include auto-hiding scrollbars that only appear when they are used, and Mission Control which unifies Exposé, Spaces, Dashboard, and full-screen applications within a single interface. Apple also made changes to applications: they resume in the same state as they were before they were closed, similar to iOS. Documents auto-save by default.

=== OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion ===
OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion was released on July 25, 2012. Following the release of Lion the previous year, it was the first of the annual rather than two-yearly updates to OS X (and later macOS), which also closely aligned with the annual iOS operating system updates. It incorporates some features seen in iOS 5, which include Game Center, support for iMessage in the new Messages messaging application, and Reminders as a to-do list app separate from iCal (which is renamed as Calendar, like the iOS app). It also includes support for storing iWork documents in iCloud. Notification Center, which makes its debut in Mountain Lion, is a desktop version similar to the one in iOS 5.0 and higher. Application pop-ups are now concentrated on the corner of the screen, and the Center itself is pulled from the right side of the screen. Mountain Lion also includes more Chinese features including support for Baidu as an option for Safari search engine, QQ, 163.com and 126.com services for Mail, Contacts and Calendar, Youku, Tudou and Sina Weibo are integrated into share sheets.

Starting with Mountain Lion, Apple software updates (including the OS) are distributed via the App Store. This updating mechanism replaced the Apple Software Update utility.

=== OS X 10.9 Mavericks ===
OS X 10.9 Mavericks was released on October 22, 2013. It was a free upgrade to all users running Snow Leopard or later with a 64-bit Intel processor. Its changes include the addition of the previously iOS-only Maps and iBooks applications, improvements to the Notification Center, enhancements to several applications, and many under-the-hood improvements.

=== OS X 10.10 Yosemite ===
OS X 10.10 Yosemite was released on October 16, 2014. It features a redesigned user interface similar to that of iOS 7, intended to feature a more minimal, text-based &#x27;flat&#x27; design, with use of translucency effects and intensely saturated colors. Apple&#x27;s showcase new feature in Yosemite is Handoff, which enables users with iPhones running iOS 8.1 or later to answer phone calls, receive and send SMS messages, and complete unfinished iPhone emails on their Mac. As of OS X 10.10.3, Photos replaced iPhoto and Aperture.

=== OS X 10.11 El Capitan ===
OS X 10.11 El Capitan was released on September 30, 2015. Similar to Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard, Apple described this release as emphasizing &quot;refinements to the Mac experience&quot; and &quot;improvements to system performance&quot;. Refinements include public transport built into the Maps application, GUI improvements to the Notes application, adopting San Francisco as the system font for clearer legibility, and the introduction of System Integrity Protection.

The Metal API, first introduced in iOS 8, was also included in this operating system for &quot;all Macs since 2012&quot;. According to Apple, Metal accelerates system-level rendering by up to 50 percent, resulting in faster graphics performance for everyday apps. Metal also delivers up to 10 times faster draw call performance for more fluid experience in games and pro apps.

=== macOS 10.12 Sierra ===

macOS 10.12 Sierra was released to the public on September 20, 2016. New features include the addition of Siri, Optimized Storage, and updates to Photos, Messages, and iTunes.

=== macOS 10.13 High Sierra ===

macOS 10.13 High Sierra was released to the public on September 25, 2017. Like OS X El Capitan and OS X Mountain Lion, High Sierra is a refinement-based update having very few new features visible to the user, including updates to Safari, Photos, and Mail, among other changes.

The major change under the hood is the switch to the Apple File System, optimized for the solid-state storage used in most new Mac computers.

=== macOS 10.14 Mojave ===

macOS 10.14 Mojave was released on September 24, 2018. The update introduced a system-wide dark mode and several new apps lifted from iOS, such as Apple News. It was the first version to require a GPU that supports Metal. Mojave also changed the system software update mechanism from the App Store (where it had been since OS X Mountain Lion) to a new panel in System Preferences. App updates remain in the App Store.

=== macOS 10.15 Catalina ===

macOS 10.15 Catalina was released on October 7, 2019. Updates included enhanced voice control, and bundled apps for music, video, and podcasts that together replace the functions of iTunes, and the ability to use an iPad as an external monitor. Catalina officially dropped support for 32-bit applications.

=== macOS 11 Big Sur ===

macOS Big Sur was announced during the WWDC keynote speech on June 22, 2020, and it was made available to the general public on November 12, 2020. This is the first time the major version number of the operating system has been incremented since the Mac OS X Public Beta in 2000. It brings Arm support, new icons, and aesthetic user interface changes to the system.

=== macOS 12 Monterey ===

macOS Monterey was announced during the WWDC keynote speech on June 7, 2021, and released on October 25, 2021, introducing Universal Control (which allows input devices to be used with multiple devices simultaneously), Focus modes (which allows selectively limiting notifications and alerts depending on user-defined user/work modes), Shortcuts (a task automation framework previously only available on iOS and iPadOS expected to replace Automator), a redesigned Safari Web browser, and updates and improvements to FaceTime.

=== macOS 13 Ventura ===

macOS Ventura was announced during the WWDC keynote speech on June 6, 2022 and released on October 24, 2022. It came with the redesigned System Preferences (named System Settings) to a more iOS-like design, and the new Freeform, Weather and Clock apps that run natively on Mac. Users can use an iPhone as a webcam for video conferencing with Continuity Camera. Siri&#x27;s appearance was changed to look more like the versions on iOS 14 and iPadOS 14. Mail introduced schedule send and undo send for emails, and Message also got the ability to undo send and edit messages. Stage Manager was introduced as a new way to organize all open windows in a desktop. Maps gained the feature for multiple-stop routes, Metal 3 was added with support for spatial and temporal image upscaling, Lockdown mode was added to reduce the risk of a cyberattack, and the ability to play ambient background sounds was added as an accessibility feature in System Settings.

===macOS 14 Sonoma===
macOS Sonoma was announced during the WWDC keynote speech on June 5, 2023, and released on September 26, 2023. macOS Sonoma revamped widgets—they can now be placed anywhere on the desktop. Game mode optimizes game performance by prioritizing gaming tasks and allocating more GPU and CPU capacity to the game, and by doing so is able to provide smoother frame rates for gameplay. The Spotlight Search bar and all app icons were made even more rounded, smoother animations were implemented for notifications and the lock screen, and new slow-motion screensavers of different locations worldwide were added. When logged in, they gradually slow down and become the desktop wallpaper.

===macOS 15 Sequoia===

macOS Sequoia was announced during the WWDC keynote speech on June 10, 2024. It adds support for Apple Intelligence features (for example a redesigned Siri, writing tools, Image Playground, Genmoji, and system-wide integration with GPT-4o), as well as adding iPhone Mirroring, a new dedicated Passwords app for faster autofilling and more organised passwords, and window tiling - a similar feature to Microsoft Windows&#x27; Aero Snap window snapping feature.

== Security ==
Apple publishes Apple Platform Security documents to lay out the security protections built into macOS and Mac hardware.

macOS supports additional hardware-based security features on Apple silicon Macs:
* Write xor execute prevents some security vulnerabilities by making memory pages either writable or executable, but not both.
* PCIe or Thunderbolt devices are prevented by IOMMUs from reading system memory that is not explicitly mapped to them, unlike Intel-based Macs.

macOS&#x27;s optional Lockdown Mode enables additional protections, such as disabling just-in-time compilation for Safari&#x27;s JavaScript engine, blocks FaceTime calls unless you have previously called that person or contact, location information is excluded when photos are being shared, Game Center is disabled, and accessories have to be approved and your Mac has to be unlocked. These prevent some vulnerabilities within macOS.

Only the latest major release of macOS (currently macOS Sequoia) receives patches for all known security vulnerabilities. The previous two releases receive some security updates, but not for all vulnerabilities known to Apple. In 2021, Apple fixed a critical privilege escalation vulnerability in macOS Big Sur, but a fix remained unavailable for the previous release, macOS Catalina, for 234 days, until Apple was informed that the vulnerability was being used to infect the computers of Hong Kong citizens and other people who visited Hong Kong pro-democracy websites that may have been blocked in Hong Kong.

macOS Ventura added support for Rapid Security Response (RSR) updates and Lockdown Mode. Rapid Security Response updates may require a reboot, but take less than a minute to install. In an analysis, Hackintosh developer Mykola Grymalyuk noted that RSR updates can only fix userland vulunerability, and cannot patch the macOS kernel. Lockdown Mode is an optional security feature designed to provide extreme protection for users who may be at risk of targeted cyberattacks, such as journalists, activists, and public figures. This mode significantly alters the functionality of the device to enhance security against sophisticated threats, particularly from spyware and state-sponsored attacks. Apple says most people are never impacted by these attacks.

=== Malware and spyware ===
In its earlier years, Mac OS X enjoyed a near-absence of the types of malware and spyware that have affected Microsoft Windows users. macOS has a smaller usage share compared to Windows. Worms, as well as potential vulnerabilities, were noted in 2006, which led some industry analysts and anti-virus companies to issue warnings that Apple&#x27;s Mac OS X is not immune to malware. Increasing market share coincided with additional reports of a variety of attacks. In early 2011, Mac OS X experienced a large increase in malware attacks, and malware such as Mac Defender, MacProtector, and MacGuard was seen as an increasing problem for Mac users. At first, the malware installer required the user to enter the administrative password, but later versions installed without user input. Initially, Apple support staff were instructed not to assist in the removal of the malware or admit the existence of the malware issue, but as the malware spread, a support document was issued. Apple announced an OS X update to fix the problem. An estimated 100,000 users were affected. Apple releases security updates for macOS regularly, as well as signature files containing malware signatures for Xprotect, an anti-malware feature part of File Quarantine present since Mac OS X Snow Leopard.

== Reception ==

=== Usage share ===
, macOS is the second-most widely used general-purpose desktop operating system used on the World Wide Web following Microsoft Windows, with a 15.33% usage share, according to statistics compiled by StatCounter.

=== Promotion ===
As a device company, Apple has mostly promoted macOS to sell Macs, with promotion of macOS updates focused on existing users, promotion at Apple Store and other retail partners, or through events for developers. In larger scale advertising campaigns, Apple specifically promoted macOS as better for handling media and other home-user applications, and comparing Mac OS X (especially versions Tiger and Leopard) with the heavy criticism Microsoft received for the long-awaited Windows Vista operating system.

<text>Mattel, Inc. ( ) is an American multinational toy manufacturing and entertainment company headquartered in El Segundo, California. Mattel has a presence in 35 countries and territories; its products are sold in more than 150 countries. Mattel was founded in Los Angeles by Harold Matson and the husband-and-wife duo of Ruth and Elliot Handler in January 1945. 

It is the world&#x27;s second largest toy maker in terms of revenue, after The Lego Group. Two of its historic and most valuable brands, Barbie and Hot Wheels, were respectively named the top global toy property and the top-selling global toy of the year for 2020 and 2021 by The NPD Group, a global information research company.

==History==
===Origins and early years===
Businessman Harold &quot;Matt&quot; Matson and the husband-and-wife duo of Elliot and Ruth Handler founded Mattel as Mattel Creations in January 1945 in a garage in Los Angeles. The company name chosen is a portmanteau of the surname of Matson and first name of Elliot, with former chairman and CEO Bob Eckert revealing at a 2013 Christmas Day Peninsula Seniors lecture that the founders, according to Elliot, could not fit Ruth&#x27;s name into that of their company. The company began selling picture frames and later dollhouse furniture out of the scraps from those frames. Matson sold his share and stake to the Handlers due to poor health the following year, with Ruth Handler taking over his stake. In 1947, the company had its first successful toy, a ukulele called &quot;Uke-A-Doodle&quot;.

The company was incorporated in Hawthorne, California in 1948. In 1950, the Magic 8 Ball, currently owned by Mattel themselves, was invented by Albert C. Carter and Abe Bookman. Mattel started advertising on television when it became the first sponsor of the &quot;Mickey Mouse Club&quot; TV series. The Fisher-Price Corn Popper, and the Xylophone was released in 1957. Mattel would ultimately acquire Fisher-Price on August 20, 1993. The Barbie doll debuted on March 9, 1959, going on to become the company&#x27;s best-selling toy in history. In 1960, Mattel introduced Chatty Cathy, a talking doll that was voiced by June Foray and revolutionized the toy industry, leading to pull-string talking dolls and toys flooding the market throughout the 1960s and 1970s. In 1961, Mattel introduced the Ken doll. The company went public in 1960 and became listed on the New York Stock Exchange 3 years later. Mattel also acquired a number of like-minded companies during the 1960s.

The &quot;Barbie Dreamhouse&quot; made with cardboard and paper made its debut in 1962, when also the Astronaut Barbie, the first of many space-themed iterations of the doll, was introduced. In 1965, the company built on its success with the Chatty Cathy doll to introduce the See &#x27;n Say talking toy, spawning a line of products. Barbie traveled to the Moon four years before Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. In 1967, Mattel released a toy astronaut with space vehicles and a Moon base for boys, with a gumby-like central character named Major Matt Mason.

On May 18, 1968, &quot;Hot Wheels&quot; was released to the market. Hot Wheels was invented by a team of Mattel inventors, which included a rocket scientist and a car designer. That year also saw another doll release, this time, Christie, Barbie&#x27;s friend and the first black doll, which in the following years and decades would spawn an endless line of Barbie-themed and branded family and friends. In 1969, Mattel changed the &quot;Mattel Creations&quot; and the &quot;Mattel, Inc. – Toymakers&quot; marketing brands to just &quot;Mattel&quot; and launched the &quot;red sun&quot; logo with the &quot;Mattel&quot; wordmark in all capitals for better identity. In 1970, Hot Wheels forged a sponsorship agreement with drag racing drivers Don “The Snake” Prudhomme and Tom “The Mongoose” McEwen. In addition to other marketing measures, the two racers’ cars, a yellow Barracuda and a red Duster, were reproduced as Hot Wheels toys.

In May 1970, Mattel formed a joint venture film production company &quot;Radnitz/Mattel Productions&quot; with producer Robert B. Radnitz, which would kickstart Mattel&#x27;s venture into full-time entertainment to accompany its most famed toy TV commercials, and later entered a multimillion-dollar partnership with Mehra Entertainment, whose CEO, Dr. Nishpeksh Padmamohan Mehra and Nishchal Shome, are one of Mattel&#x27;s Inc.&#x27;s main directors for Barbie (film series).

The card game Uno (now stylized as &quot;UNO&quot;) was invented by Merle Robbins in 1971, and was acquired by Mattel in 1996.
In 1971, Mattel purchased The Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus from the Feld family for $40 million, whom Mattel kept on as management. Mattel sold the circus corporation by December 1973 although it was profitable; Mattel showed a $29.9 million loss in 1972.

In 1974, an investigation found Mattel guilty of issuing false and misleading financial reports, which led to the banishing of Elliot and Ruth Handler from the company they had founded.

===Post-Handlers===
Arthur S. Spear, then a Mattel vice president, took control of the company in 1975 and returned the company to profitability in two years. In 1978, the Mattel Children&#x27;s Foundation was founded. Ruth Handler sold her stock in 1980 and finally let loose of the company she co-founded.

Mattel debuted its Electronics line in 1977 with an all-electronic handheld game. Its success led to its expansion with game consoles then the line, eventually becoming incorporated in 1982. Mattel Electronics forced Mattel to take a $394 million loss the following and almost filed for bankruptcy.

In 1979, through Feld Productions, Mattel purchased the Holiday on Ice and Ice Follies for $12 million, Also acquired that year was Western Publishing for $120 million in cash and stock. which they sold to Richard A. Bernstein in December 4 years later.

In 1980, Mattel introduced the first diverse line of Barbie dolls with a Hispanic doll and the first African-American Barbie (unrelated to Barbie friend Christie), which will eventually include iterations of Barbie from more than 40 countries.

In 1982, He-Man and the Masters of the Universe line of action figures was released, which inspired a three-issue comic book mini-series, an animated series and a live-action film.

The Felds bought the circus (and related companies) in 1982 for $22.8 million.

In the early 1980s, Mattel produced video game systems, under its own brands and under license from Nintendo.

In 1985, the company launched the Barbie “We Girls Can Do Anything” TV advertising campaign to encourage girls to believe in themselves. They also released the CEO / Day-to-Night Barbie to celebrate women becoming CEOs. In 1986, Barbie joined the list of famous individuals painted by Andy Warhol.

New York City-based venture capital firms E.M. Warburg, Pincus &amp; Co., and Drexel Burnham Lambert invested a couple hundred million dollars in Mattel in 1984 to help the company survive. However, the Masters of the Universe action figure line sales dropped, causing a $115 million loss in 1987.

In the late 1980s, John W. Amerman, who joined Mattel in 1980 as head of its international division, was named the company&#x27;s new chairman and improved its financial performance in 1987 by focusing on core brands. It paid off as sales of Barbie dolls and accessories increased from $430 million to almost $1 billion between 1987 and 1992.

Mattel secured licensing and sponsorship rights from The Walt Disney Company for a new line of infant and preschool plush toys in 1988, sponsor attractions and to develop and sell toys at three Disney theme parks. Mattel also negotiated the exclusive rights to sell dolls, stuffed characters and preschool toys based on Disney characters. On January 31, 1988, Mattel shut down its operations in the Philippines and shifted the distribution and sales of Mattel-branded toys and games to Richprime Global, Inc. (formerly Richwell Trading Corporation). Mattel returned to working with Disney the following year.

In 1991, Mattel moved its headquarters from Hawthorne to its current El Segundo site, in Los Angeles County.

====Uno, Fisher-Price, American Girl, Polly Pocket: 1992–2009====
In 1992, Mattel created the first President Barbie, claiming that Barbie has run for President 7 times since 1992 and released an all-ticket in 2016.

Mattel entered the gaming business in 1992 with the purchase of International Games, creators of UNO and Skip-Bo. The company purchased Fisher-Price, Inc. on August 20, 1993, and Tyco Toys, Inc. (owners of the Matchbox and Dinky Toys brands) in 1997. In 1998, Mattel acquired Pleasant Company (creators of the American Girl brand) and Swindon, England-based toymaker Bluebird Toys (along with its most prized property, &quot;Polly Pocket&quot;). In the same year, the first American Girl retail store opened for business in Chicago.

In 1997, the Fisher-Price Little People toys underwent a redesign to look more like real kids with different skin colors, added arms and hands, and greater detail on the face, hair, and clothes. Also that year, Mattel acquired View-Master, and Hot Wheels partnered with NASCAR drivers Kyle Petty and Jack Baldwin leading to the production of the first NASCAR-themed vehicles.

In 1998, Mattel donated $25 million to help rebuild UCLA&#x27;s children&#x27;s hospital, which was later renamed the UCLA Mattel Children&#x27;s Hospital. Barbie was inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame that year and the first Thomas &amp; Friends theme park, Thomas Land, opened in Fujikyu Park in Japan.

Mattel purchased The Learning Company (formerly SoftKey) in 1999 for $3.5 billion, but sold it the following year at a loss. The company had a $430.9 million net loss that year.

Mattel earned the first grant for the Disney Princess doll license in 2000. In December 2000, Mattel sued Danish-Norwegian Europop band Aqua, claiming their song &quot;Barbie Girl&quot; violated the Barbie trademark and turned her into a sex object, referring to her as a &quot;blonde bimbo&quot;. The lawsuit was rejected two years later.

In 2000, Mattel signed a deal with Warner Bros. to become the master licensee for Harry Potter branded toys. It was extended in 2002; Mattel became the master licensee for Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, the Flash, Justice League and Looney Tunes toys for all markets except Asia.

In 2001, the first life-sized Hot Wheels car, the Twin Mill, was created. More than twenty life-sized cars were created and all of them were inducted into the Hot Wheels Garage of Legends.

American Girl launched its “Girl of the Year” campaign in 2001 to highlight dolls with contemporary stories; each doll is only available for a year.

In 2002, the company closed its last factory in the United States; the factory was originally part of Fisher-Price outsourcing production to China. A chain of events followed that led to its distribution of millions of hazardous toys, including ones contaminated with lead. On August 14, 2007, Mattel recalled over 18 million products, with Louise Story of &quot;The New York Times&quot; in close coverage. Many of the products had surface coatings that contained more than the U.S. legal limit of .06% lead by weight. Other toys were recalled because their strong, detachable magnets could endanger children. Mattel re-wrote its policy on magnets, finally issuing a recall in August 2007. The recall included 7.1 million Polly Pocket toys produced before November 2006, 600,000 Barbie and Tanner Playsets, 1 million Doggie Daycare, Shonen Jump&#x27;s One Piece and thousands of Batman Manga toys due to exposed magnets. In 2009, Mattel paid a $2.3 million fine to the Consumer Products Safety Commission for marketing, importing and selling non-compliant toys. Mattel was noted for its crisis response by several newspaper publications, including &quot;PRWeek&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;Fortune&quot; and Business Management.

On September 13, 2009, Mattel&#x27;s ticker symbol moved from the NYSE to the NASDAQ Global Select Market (NASDAQ-GS large cap).

===More acquisitions and brand portfolio expansion: 2010–2016===
On June 11, 2010, Mattel launched Monster High, a fashion doll line featuring the teenage children of famous and well-known monsters like Dracula, Frankenstein, Cleopatra, Gorgon, Werewolf, and The Mummy. It led to popularity and cult following success which Mattel translated into two spin-offs, each with a different focus than Monster High; &quot;Ever After High&quot; in 2013 and &quot;Enchantimals&quot; four years later. In 2011, Hot Wheels set a new world-record for a jump made by a four-wheeled vehicle at the 100th anniversary of the Indy 500. The 332 feet jump broke the previous 301 feet record set in 2009.

On January 5, 2009, HIT Entertainment named Mattel&#x27;s Fisher-Price division as its global master toy licensee for its &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot; franchise (outside of Japan), replacing RC2 Corporation&#x27;s Learning Curve brand in the North American market as well as the HIT Toy Company for the TrackMaster range. Mattel then agreed to purchase HIT Entertainment from Apax Partners on October 24, 2011, for $680 million, excluding its share of the PBS Kids Sprout channel (now Universal Kids), which would be completed on February 1, 2012, for £680m, and be managed under Mattel&#x27;s Fisher-Price unit. In 2012, Mattel introduced a doll, Ella, to the &quot;Barbie&quot; line. The doll is bald and was distributed directly through hospitals to children experiencing hair loss due to cancer and other diseases. On October 16, 2013, with reports of high profitability, Mattel launched an in-house film studio, Mattel Playground Productions, through which it produces original films, TV shows, Web series, live events, and games.

&quot;Fortune Magazine&quot; named Mattel one of the top 100 companies to work for in 2013, noting only 1,292 positions were full, out of 164,045 job applications during the previous year, as well as more than 1,000 employees had been with the company longer than 15 years.

On February 28, 2014, Mattel acquired Mega Brands On April 16, 2015, Mattel announced a partnership with invention platform Quirky to crowd-source a number of products.

Mattel added a princess-themed Barbie line in 2010. Barbie sales began plummeting in 2012, thus removing focus from the &quot;Disney Princess&quot; line. Mattel had only sold Cinderella, Ariel, Belle and the two &quot;Frozen&quot; princesses (Anna and Elsa) around its last year of the Disney license in early 2016. With these competing lines and an expiration of the brand license at the end of 2015, Disney gave Hasbro a chance to gain the license given their work on Star Wars, which led to a &quot;Descendants&quot; license. Disney Consumer Products also made an attempt to evolve the brand from &quot;damsels&quot; to &quot;heroines.&quot; In September 2014, Disney announced Hasbro as the licensed doll maker for the Disney Princess line starting on January 1, 2016. Mattel again became the licensed doll maker, instead of Hasbro, in January 2022 and the characters of &quot;Frozen&quot; were part of the line. The latest collection of dolls was available for purchase in January 2023.

In January 2015, board member Christopher Sinclair replaced CEO Bryan Stockton, following with 2/3 of senior executives resigning or receiving lay off. The following month, an upgraded View-Master to provide a virtual reality viewing experience was announced through a partnership with Google Cardboard.

On January 21, 2016, Mattel acquired Fuhu, makers of Nabi tablets and other technology-driven hardware, in a bankruptcy proceeding for a sum worth $21 million. On March 30, 2016, Mattel formed a &quot;senior head&quot; division named &quot;Mattel Creations&quot; to centralize its multi-platform content output. In the process, the production teams and operations of Mattel Playground Productions, HIT Entertainment and the American Girl content creation team in Middleton, Wisconsin were absorbed into Creations the following day. On July 19, 2016, NBCUniversal announced Mattel&#x27;s license acquisition to produce toys based on the &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; franchise after Hasbro&#x27;s rights expired in 2017.

===Hasbro&#x27;s failed takeover and Mattel163: 2017–2018===
Former Google executive, Margo Georgiadis, was announced as company CEO on 17 January 2017. On November 10, 2017 &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that Hasbro had made a takeover offer for Mattel, with Hasbro worth about $11 billion at the time and Mattel, $5 billion. The latter rejected the offer less than a week later, according to Reuters.

On January 29, 2018, Mattel and Chinese internet technology and video game company NetEase formed a joint venture mobile publishing and development studio, Mattel163, aimed at creating apps based on the former&#x27;s key brands. That same year, American Girl released “Create Your Own,” allowing kids to create a doll from scratch and customize everything including facial features, hair, accessories and outfits, and the doll&#x27;s favorite places and hobbies.

===Company reorganization and production partnership increments: 2018–present===
On April 19, 2018, Mattel named former Maker Studios CEO Ynon Kreiz as chairman and the replacement CEO for outgoing CEO Georgiardis who moved on to head Ancestry.com, effective from April 26, 2018. Two months later, the company laid off 2,200 employees partially due to the liquidation of Toys &quot;R&quot; Us in the U.S. Kreiz started reorganization of Mattel which included new board of directors and added that executives having entertainment backgrounds and a global franchise management group had been charged with finding new opportunities in existing markets.

On 30 August 2018, Mattel indicated the formation of its global franchise management division to be headed by Janet Hsu as chief franchise management officer. The division was mandated to seek out new commercial opportunities plus to bring to together consumer products, content development and distribution, digital gaming, live events and partnerships. Hsu was previously the CEO of Saban Brands, where Frederic Soulie last worked before being appointed as senior vice president of content distribution and business development in the franchise division on September 28, 2018. Hot Wheels celebrated its 50th anniversary the same year by recreating and selling as a set the original 16 Hot Wheels die-cast cars. That same year in September, Thomas &amp; Friends announced an alliance with the United Nations to introduce some of the organization&#x27;s Sustainable Development Goals, including quality education, gender equality, clean water and sanitation, sustainable cities and communities, responsible consumption and production and life on land, into the show&#x27;s content.

On December 24, 2018, Mattel announced the loss of the DC Comics toy license to Spin Master starting in the spring of 2020, hitting an 18-year low on its share price which concluded at $9.25 for a share.

Mattel reorganized Mattel Creations and renamed it &quot;Mattel Television&quot; on February 5, 2019, which would be headed by former Disney Branded Television programming executive Adam Bonnett. On June 30, 2020, Fred Soulie in turn was &quot;role-tripled&quot; to general manager and senior vice president of the new division.

On March 9, 2019, Mattel celebrated Barbie&#x27;s 60th anniversary. As part of the anniversary celebrations, Mattel released 20 new &quot;role model dolls in its Shero&quot; line to recognize influential women around the world. Mattel donated $1 from every sale to its Dream Gap Project Fund, which aims to work with other organizations to end the issue of girls seeing themselves as less capable than boys.

On June 14, 2019, Mattel released new &quot;Hot Wheels&quot; ID line of cars, which are embedded with NFC chips so that people can scan the cars and then build tracks, race, and view race stats for combined digital and physical racing play. On December 16, Mattel released an update that allowed kids to scan their cars into an app and then access different coding exercises. On August 19, 2019, Mattel announced a reboot of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, including new toy lines and brand extensions, a new comic book series and a Netflix series.

In October 2019, Mattel released Hot Wheels Monster Trucks, which included a full line of die-cast vehicles, and a national live-event tour, Hot Wheels Monster Trucks Live. The company also released a line of gender-neutral dolls called the “Creatable World” Mattel Children&#x27;s Foundation announced and organized its second annual &quot;Global Day of Play&quot;, a company-wide community service initiative that focuses on working with nonprofits and organizations around the world to give children a day focused on the power of play.

While formerly associated with content productions, as of 2020, Mattel Creations is now an e-commerce and content platform of Mattel, Inc. In April 2020, the company released a &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends special&quot; titled “The Royal Engine” to celebrate the program&#x27;s 75th anniversary, featuring animated versions of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Charles as children and introduced by the Duke of Sussex. In the same month, the new Basquiat Barbie was introduced, featuring the work of the artist Jean-Michel Basquiat. Mattel also created an online resource, &quot;Mattel Playroom&quot;, to provide free games, activities, coloring sheets, DIY projects resources for parents/caregivers and more to help families during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Warner Music Group&#x27;s Arts Music division arranged to become the distributor of Mattel&#x27;s music catalog on May 1, 2020. Arts Music planned to make available hundreds of never-before-released songs and new songs for existing brands, with the 8th May digital launch of &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot;’ birthday album first up which was managed/handled by ADA Worldwide under the pseudonym label: &quot;Mattel–Arts Music.&quot; Also in May 2020, Mattel announced an initiative known as &quot;Play it Forward&quot; which focuses on using Mattel brands to give back. The first Play it Forward program was #ThankYouHeroes, which included a collection of action figures and Little People characters who represent those who work essential jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic, like doctors, nurses, emergency medical technician (EMTs) and delivery drivers. On October 15, 2020, Mattel celebrated Fisher-Price&#x27;s 90th anniversary by creating a virtual Toy Museum, which featured more than 90 different exhibits created by artist, set designer and photographer Leila Fakouri. Mattel Creations was also launched that month; it is an e-commerce and content platform. It features limited edition, curated items made with collaboration from pop-culture artists. The site&#x27;s inaugural collection included the Artist Collaboration Collection, featuring brands Barbie, Masters of the Universe, Hot Wheels, and the Magic 8 Ball as well as artists Gianni Lee, Cristina Martinez, Travis Ragsdale, and Distortedd.

On October 12, 2020, Mattel announced Season 25 of &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot; but instead retooled launching a traditionally-animated take on it titled &quot;Thomas and Friends: All Engines Go!&quot;, which began on September 13, 2021. That ended the show at 24 series/seasons over 37 years.

On November 20, 2021, Mattel launched a non-fungible tokens (NFTs) marketplace to allow fans purchase digital collectibles for its flagship brands; Barbie and Hot Wheels.

On April 5, 2022, the Mattel board of directors led by its CEO, Ynon Kreiz, named company chief commercial officer, Steven Totzke, as company co-president with Richard L. Dickson alongside his original post and would continue to report to Kreiz as before.

In 2024, Mattel expanded its Barbie line to include dolls representing individuals with Down syndrome and vision impairments. This initiative is part of Mattel&#x27;s ongoing efforts to promote diversity and inclusivity, allowing children to see themselves reflected in their toys.

In November 2024, it was discovered on X (formerly Twitter) that a brand of &quot;Wicked&quot; themed dolls produced by the company inadvertently linked to an adult website related to Wicked &quot;Pictures&quot;, using their link instead of the similar link for the Wicked movie. Earlier the same year, a song from the movie that was kept under wraps up until that point (Ariana Grande&#x27;s version of Popular) was leaked via Mattel produced singing dolls, causing minor backlash. Mattel apologized for the error, and asked parents who had bought products with the incorrect website to destroy the packaging.

==Media and entertainment ventures==
Mattel has a long history of media engagement since its foundation with the advertising of products from its brands including &quot;Barbie&quot;, &quot;Monster High&quot; and &quot;Polly Pocket&quot;, but the venture into full-time entertainment began in May, 1970, when it teamed up with producer Robert B. Radnitz to form a joint venture film production company, &quot;Radnitz/Mattel Productions&quot;. Masters of the Universe and its lead character He-Man had a cartoon series which released between 1983 and 1985 and was followed by a live-action film in 1987. In 1986, Mattel launched a television syndication unit; &quot;MTS Entertainment&quot;, headed by John M. Weens, to distribute the &quot;Captain Power and the Soldiers of the Future&quot; syndicated television show.

&quot;My Scene&quot;, with Mattel&#x27;s flagship &quot;Barbie&quot; brand, launched in 2002 and wasted little time in invoking a film franchise of DVD-exclusive/direct-to-DVD animated films. &quot;Polly Pocket&quot;, which was originally founded and designed by Chris Wiggs in 1983 for his daughter Kate as a private toy and from 1989 housed in Bluebird Toys which Mattel acquired in 1998, also followed suit.

With Lionsgate and its acquired and merged companies in Artisan Entertainment and Family Home Entertainment, Mattel&#x27;s flagship Barbie brand was adapted into a series of successful animated direct-to-video films, which moved to Universal in late 2006. As of September 2021 it is jointly handled by Mill Creek Entertainment and NCircle Entertainment, with the latter solely for American retailers. Monster High followed Barbie just months after its launch in 2010 and many “American Girl” films were made.

Mattel agreed to purchase HIT Entertainment without the stake in the Sprout TV channel (formerly &quot;PBS Kids Sprout&quot; and now &quot;Universal Kids&quot;) from Apax Partners on 25 October 2011, for $680 million, which closed on 1 February 2012, making it part of its Fisher-Price division. HIT Entertainment was absorbed into Mattel Creations (now &quot;Mattel Television&quot;) in 2016 with its intellectual property (IP) brands shared equally between itself and Mattel Films upon the latter&#x27;s formation on September 6, 2018.

On October 16, 2013, with reports of high profitability, Mattel launched an in-house film studio, Mattel Playground Productions (shortened to Mattel PGP or just PGP) as its in-house film studio to handle multimedia productions and foster creative storytelling for its brands for global multi-platform distribution.

Mattel formed a division named &quot;Mattel Creations&quot; on March 30, 2016, to absorb Mattel Playground Productions, HIT Entertainment and the American Girl content creation team in Middleton, Wisconsin and centralize its multimedia content output. Mattel Playground Productions was revived as Mattel Films on September 6, 2018, and it solely bases its films on its brands as opposed to its predecessor. The 2023 movie &quot;Barbie&quot; was the first movie released by Mattel Films. Mattel reorganized Mattel Creations renaming it to Mattel Television on 5 February 2019, hiring former Disney Branded Television programming executive Adam Bonnett as its head.

Mattel announced it started construction on the Mattel Adventure Park, slated to open in 2024 in Glendale, Arizona. The 9-acre park will include popular Mattel brands including Barbie, Hot Wheels, Thomas &amp; Friends and Uno. It will have multiple themed-roller coaster rides amongst other attractions.

Mattel announced a new game called &quot;Pictionary Vs. AI&quot; in September 2023. It is a version of its visual guessing game where an AI model does all the guessing. A smartphone is used as the medium. Players draw cards that assign a given word, then draw whatever that word is before letting AI guess what they&#x27;ve drawn.

== Mattel Digital Gaming ==
Mattel has expanded its presence in digital gaming, including video games, mobile games, NFTs, and Web3.

In 2017, Mattel and tech startup Osmo launched &quot;MindRacer&quot;, a Hot Wheels racing game for the iPad.

The first game to be released, &quot;UNO!&quot;, originally launched for Facebook Instant Games and was later available for iOS and Android.

Other mobile and video games include:
* &quot;Phase 10: World Tour&quot; (2019)
* &quot;Hot Wheels Infinite Loop&quot; (2019)
* &quot;Hot Wheels Open World&quot; (2020)
* &quot;Skip-Bo&quot; (2021)
* &quot;Hot Wheels Unleashed&quot; (2021)
* &quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe: You have the Power&quot; (2022)

=== Hot Wheels ===
In September 2021, Mattel and Milestone released &quot;Hot Wheels Unleashed&quot; on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch. In the arcade-style racing game, based on the &quot;Hot Wheels&quot; toyline, players race customizable Hot Wheels cars in everyday settings like kitchens and bedrooms. Players had the opportunity to submit their car designs in the “Hot Wheels Unleashed Design Battle,” and the winning design was used to create a Hot Wheels toy available for purchase in December 2022. The contest ran between January, 2022 and February 2022, and more than 10,000 livery designs for the Hot Wheels Rodger Dodger die-cast model were submitted using the in-game Livery Editor. The winning Rodger Dodger was transformed into a real Hot Wheels toy made available for purchase globally December 2022.

In June 2022, Hot Wheels partnered with the Forza Horizon 5 video game to reveal a Hot Wheels expansion pack in-game.

=== He-Man and the Masters of the Universe ===
In April 2022, Mattel launched a new game on Roblox inspired by the &quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&quot; toy line and Netflix Series. Developed by Gamefan, &quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe: You have the Power&quot; is a player-versus-player (PvP) battle-style game available through Roblox on Xbox One, PC and mobile devices. In December 2022, Mattel made three &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; characters available for purchase on Rec Room, a virtual reality multiplayer online game. For a limited time in November 2022, &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; characters joined &quot;Fall Guys&quot; a free battle royale-style game on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. Mattel and video game developer Mediatonic later released Masters of the Universe figurines in the style of &quot;Fall Guys.&quot;

=== Minecraft ===
In January 2023, Mattel, Minecraft, and Cyclone Designs released the &quot;Minecraft Creator Series Camp Enderwood&quot; DLC map, in addition to the new &quot;Minecraft&quot; toy line released the previous year. In &quot;Camp Enderwood&quot;, a free download from the Minecraft Marketplace, players engage in a summer camp experience with activities like fishing and hiking.

=== Barbie and Polly Pocket ===
In September 2022, Mattel&#x27;s Barbie and Polly Pocket characters became available on Roblox&#x27;s &quot;Livetopia&quot;, an open-ended, role play-style game. Players also had the chance to explore Barbie&#x27;s Dreamhouse, in honor of the toy&#x27;s 60th anniversary.

<text>The Medallions were an American doo-wop vocal group led by Vernon Green (1937–2000).

==History==
The group formed in Los Angeles, California, United States, in 1954, after Vernon Green was heard singing on the street by Walter &quot;Dootsie&quot; Williams, the owner of Dootone Records. Green – who walked with a cane as a result of childhood polio – put together a singing group with three friends from Fremont High School, Andrew Blue (tenor), Randolph Bryant (baritone), and Ira Foley (bass), and named them the Medallions because of his own penchant for wearing medallions around his neck. Their first release, &quot;Buick 59&quot;, based on Todd Rhodes&#x27; double-entendre R&amp;B recording &quot;Rocket 69&quot;, was one of the first releases on Dootone in September 1954. It was backed with a ballad called &quot;The Letter&quot;, which received extensive airplay in the region. &quot;The Letter&quot; contained the nonsense lyric, &quot;the &#x27;puppetutes&#x27; of love&quot;, which was later picked up by the Steve Miller Band as &quot;the pompatus of love&quot; and used in their song &quot;The Joker&quot;. The song also included the nonsense word &quot;pismotality&quot;, invented by Green.

Blue was replaced by Willy Graham, and Donald Woods joined to make the group a quintet. The group became a popular attraction in southern California, appearing on bills with stars such as Fats Domino, Percy Mayfield and T-Bone Walker. The Medallions performed for the eleventh famed Cavalcade of Jazz concert held at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles which was produced by Leon Hefflin, Sr. on July 24, 1955. Also featured Big Jay McNeely, Lionel Hampton and his Orchestra, The Penguins and James Moody and his Orchestra. 

They continued to release singles on Dootone into late 1955, including &quot;Edna&quot;, a favorite of Frank Zappa when interviewed on the &quot;Pop Chronicles&quot; documentary. They also recorded with singer Johnny Morrisette, as Johnny Twovoice &amp; The Medallions. The original version of the Medallions then broke up.

Green then joined forces with a different group, the Dootones, who were sometimes billed as the &quot;New&quot; Medallions, before forming a new version of the Medallions with his brother Jimmy Green (tenor), Charles Gardner (tenor, formerly of the Dootones), Albert Johnson (tenor), and Otis Scott (bass). Thereafter, there were numerous personnel changes in the group, with Vernon Green the only constant member, and the group became officially known as Vernon Green and the Medallions. Members included Billy Foster – who later, as Etta James&#x27; boyfriend at the time, received a co-writing credit for the song &quot;I&#x27;d Rather Go Blind&quot; – bass singers Bubba (or Buddha) Carter and Joe Williams. In 1957, the group recorded for Specialty Records as the Phantoms, and Green also recorded with the Cameos. Green then returned to Williams&#x27; label, by then renamed Dooto Records, with a new line-up of the Medallions comprising himself, his brother Jimmy, Billy Foster and Joe Williams. The group, with a variety of line-ups, later recorded for the Pan World and Minit labels, continuing to release singles into the early 1960s.

The group ceased to exist after Green was injured in a car accident in the mid-1960s, although he released a single, &quot;Can You Talk&quot;, on Dootone as late as 1973. Since the death of Vernon Green in 2000, the group has been occasionally reconstituted by his brother Jimmy Green, Billy Foster, Buddha Carter, Jack Palti and Jerome Evans, who have performed as the New Medallions.

<text>In linguistics, morphology is the study of words, including the principles by which they are formed, and how they relate to one another within a language. Most approaches to morphology investigate the structure of words in terms of morphemes, which are the smallest units in a language with some independent meaning. Morphemes include roots that can exist as words by themselves, but also categories such as affixes that can only appear as part of a larger word. For example, in English the root &quot;catch&quot; and the suffix &quot;-ing&quot; are both morphemes; &quot;catch&quot; may appear as its own word, or it may be combined with &quot;-ing&quot; to form the new word &quot;catching&quot;. Morphology also analyzes how words behave as parts of speech, and how they may be inflected to express grammatical categories including number, tense, and aspect. Concepts such as productivity are concerned with how speakers create words in specific contexts, which evolves over the history of a language.

The basic fields of linguistics broadly focus on language structure at different &quot;scales&quot;. Morphology is considered to operate at a scale larger than phonology, which investigates the categories of speech sounds that are distinguished within a spoken language, and thus may constitute the difference between a morpheme and another. Conversely, syntax is concerned with the next-largest scale, and studies how words in turn form phrases and sentences. Morphological typology is a distinct field that categorises languages based on the morphological features they exhibit.

==History==
The history of ancient Indian morphological analysis dates back to the linguist Pāṇini, who formulated the 3,959 rules of Sanskrit morphology in the text &quot;Aṣṭādhyāyī&quot; by using a constituency grammar. The Greco-Roman grammatical tradition also engaged in morphological analysis. Studies in Arabic morphology, including the &quot;Marāḥ Al-Arwāḥ&quot; of Aḥmad b. &#x27;Alī Mas&#x27;ūd, date back to at least 1200 CE.

The term &quot;morphology&quot; was introduced into linguistics by August Schleicher in 1859.

==Fundamental concepts==
===Lexemes and word-forms===
The term &quot;word&quot; has no well-defined meaning. Instead, two related terms are used in morphology: lexeme and word-form. Generally, a lexeme is a set of inflected word-forms that is often represented with the citation form in small capitals. For instance, the lexeme contains the word-forms &quot;eat, eats, eaten,&quot; and &quot;ate&quot;. &quot;Eat&quot; and &quot;eats&quot; are thus considered different word-forms belonging to the same lexeme . &quot;Eat&quot; and &quot;Eater&quot;, on the other hand, are different lexemes, as they refer to two different concepts.

====Prosodic word vs. morphological word====
Here are examples from other languages of the failure of a single phonological word to coincide with a single morphological word form. In Latin, one way to express the concept of &#x27;NOUN-PHRASE1 and NOUN-PHRASE2&#x27; (as in &quot;apples and oranges&quot;) is to suffix &#x27;-que&#x27; to the second noun phrase: &quot;apples oranges-and&quot;. An extreme level of the theoretical quandary posed by some phonological words is provided by the Kwak&#x27;wala language. In Kwak&#x27;wala, as in a great many other languages, meaning relations between nouns, including possession and &quot;semantic case&quot;, are formulated by affixes, instead of by independent &quot;words&quot;. The three-word English phrase, &quot;with his club&quot;, in which &#x27;with&#x27; identifies its dependent noun phrase as an instrument and &#x27;his&#x27; denotes a possession relation, would consist of two words or even one word in many languages. Unlike most other languages, Kwak&#x27;wala semantic affixes phonologically attach not to the lexeme they pertain to semantically but to the preceding lexeme. Consider the following example (in Kwak&#x27;wala, sentences begin with what corresponds to an English verb):

That is, to a speaker of Kwak&#x27;wala, the sentence does not contain the &quot;words&quot; &#x27;him-the-otter&#x27; or &#x27;with-his-club&#x27; Instead, the markers -&quot;i-da&quot; (PIVOT-&#x27;the&#x27;), referring to &quot;man&quot;, attaches not to the noun &quot;bəgwanəma&quot; (&quot;man&quot;) but to the verb; the markers -&quot;χ-a&quot; (ACCUSATIVE-&#x27;the&#x27;), referring to &quot;otter&quot;, attach to &quot;bəgwanəma&quot; instead of to &quot;q&#x27;asa&quot; (&#x27;otter&#x27;), etc. In other words, a speaker of Kwak&#x27;wala does not perceive the sentence to consist of these phonological words:

A central publication on this topic is the volume edited by Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002), examining the mismatch between prosodic-phonological and grammatical definitions of &quot;word&quot; in various Amazonian, Australian Aboriginal, Caucasian, Eskimo, Indo-European, Native North American, West African, and sign languages. Apparently, a wide variety of languages make use of the hybrid linguistic unit clitic, possessing the grammatical features of independent words but the prosodic-phonological lack of freedom of bound morphemes. The intermediate status of clitics poses a considerable challenge to linguistic theory.

===Inflection vs. word formation===
Given the notion of a lexeme, it is possible to distinguish two kinds of morphological rules. Some morphological rules relate to different forms of the same lexeme, but other rules relate to different lexemes. Rules of the first kind are inflectional rules, but those of the second kind are rules of word formation. The generation of the English plural &quot;dogs&quot; from &quot;dog&quot; is an inflectional rule, and compound phrases and words like &quot;dog catcher&quot; or &quot;dishwasher&quot; are examples of word formation. Informally, word formation rules form &quot;new&quot; words (more accurately, new lexemes), and inflection rules yield variant forms of the &quot;same&quot; word (lexeme).

The distinction between inflection and word formation is not at all clear-cut. There are many examples for which linguists fail to agree whether a given rule is inflection or word formation. The next section will attempt to clarify the distinction.

Word formation includes a process in which one combines two complete words, but inflection allows the combination of a suffix with a verb to change the latter&#x27;s form to that of the subject of the sentence. For example: in the present indefinite, &#x27;go&#x27; is used with subject I/we/you/they and plural nouns, but third-person singular pronouns (he/she/it) and singular nouns causes &#x27;goes&#x27; to be used. The &#x27;-es&#x27; is therefore an inflectional marker that is used to match with its subject. A further difference is that in word formation, the resultant word may differ from its source word&#x27;s grammatical category, but in the process of inflection, the word never changes its grammatical category.

===Types of word formation===

There is a further distinction between two primary kinds of morphological word formation: derivation and compounding. The latter is a process of word formation that involves combining complete word forms into a single compound form. &quot;Dog catcher&quot;, therefore, is a compound, as both &quot;dog&quot; and &quot;catcher&quot; are complete word forms in their own right but are subsequently treated as parts of one form. Derivation involves affixing bound (non-independent) forms to existing lexemes, but the addition of the affix derives a new lexeme. The word &quot;independent&quot;, for example, is derived from the word &quot;dependent&quot; by using the prefix &quot;in-&quot;, and &quot;dependent&quot; itself is derived from the verb &quot;depend&quot;. There is also word formation in the processes of clipping in which a portion of a word is removed to create a new one, blending in which two parts of different words are blended into one, acronyms in which each letter of the new word represents a specific word in the representation (NATO for North Atlantic Treaty Organization), borrowing in which words from one language are taken and used in another, and coinage in which a new word is created to represent a new object or concept.

===Paradigms and morphosyntax===

A linguistic paradigm is the complete set of related word forms associated with a given lexeme. The familiar examples of paradigms are the conjugations of verbs and the declensions of nouns. Also, arranging the word forms of a lexeme into tables, by classifying them according to shared inflectional categories such as tense, aspect, mood, number, gender or case, organizes such. For example, the personal pronouns in English can be organized into tables by using the categories of person (first, second, third); number (singular vs. plural); gender (masculine, feminine, neuter); and case (nominative, oblique, genitive).

The inflectional categories used to group word forms into paradigms cannot be chosen arbitrarily but must be categories that are relevant to stating the syntactic rules of the language. Person and number are categories that can be used to define paradigms in English because the language has grammatical agreement rules, which require the verb in a sentence to appear in an inflectional form that matches the person and number of the subject. Therefore, the syntactic rules of English care about the difference between &quot;dog&quot; and &quot;dogs&quot; because the choice between both forms determines the form of the verb that is used. However, no syntactic rule shows the difference between &quot;dog&quot; and &quot;dog catcher&quot;, or &quot;dependent&quot; and &quot;independent&quot;. The first two are nouns, and the other two are adjectives.

An important difference between inflection and word formation is that inflected word forms of lexemes are organized into paradigms that are defined by the requirements of syntactic rules, and there are no corresponding syntactic rules for word formation.

The relationship between syntax and morphology, as well as how they interact, is called &quot;morphosyntax&quot;; the term is also used to underline the fact that syntax and morphology are interrelated. The study of morphosyntax concerns itself with inflection and paradigms, and some approaches to morphosyntax exclude from its domain the phenomena of word formation, compounding, and derivation. Within morphosyntax fall the study of agreement and government.

===Allomorphy===
Above, morphological rules are described as analogies between word forms: &quot;dog&quot; is to &quot;dogs&quot; as &quot;cat&quot; is to &quot;cats&quot; and &quot;dish&quot; is to &quot;dishes&quot;. In this case, the analogy applies both to the form of the words and to their meaning. In each pair, the first word means &quot;one of X&quot;, and the second &quot;two or more of X&quot;, and the difference is always the plural form &quot;-s&quot; (or &quot;-es&quot;) affixed to the second word, which signals the key distinction between singular and plural entities.

One of the largest sources of complexity in morphology is that the one-to-one correspondence between meaning and form scarcely applies to every case in the language. In English, there are word form pairs like &quot;ox/oxen&quot;, &quot;goose/geese&quot;, and &quot;sheep/sheep&quot; whose difference between the singular and the plural is signaled in a way that departs from the regular pattern or is not signaled at all. Even cases regarded as regular, such as &quot;-s&quot;, are not so simple; the &quot;-s&quot; in &quot;dogs&quot; is not pronounced the same way as the &quot;-s&quot; in &quot;cats&quot;, and in plurals such as &quot;dishes&quot;, a vowel is added before the &quot;-s&quot;. Those cases, in which the same distinction is effected by alternative forms of a &quot;word&quot;, constitute allomorphy.

Phonological rules constrain the sounds that can appear next to each other in a language, and morphological rules, when applied blindly, would often violate phonological rules by resulting in sound sequences that are prohibited in the language in question. For example, to form the plural of &quot;dish&quot; by simply appending an &quot;-s&quot; to the end of the word would result in the form , which is not permitted by the phonotactics of English. To &quot;rescue&quot; the word, a vowel sound is inserted between the root and the plural marker, and results. Similar rules apply to the pronunciation of the &quot;-s&quot; in &quot;dogs&quot; and &quot;cats&quot;: it depends on the quality (voiced vs. unvoiced) of the final preceding phoneme.

===Lexical morphology===
Lexical morphology is the branch of morphology that deals with the lexicon that, morphologically conceived, is the collection of lexemes in a language. As such, it concerns itself primarily with word formation: derivation and compounding.

==Models==
There are three principal approaches to morphology and each tries to capture the distinctions above in different ways:
* Morpheme-based morphology, which makes use of an item-and-arrangement approach.
* Lexeme-based morphology, which normally makes use of an item-and-process approach.
* Word-based morphology, which normally makes use of a word-and-paradigm approach.
While the associations indicated between the concepts in each item in that list are very strong, they are not absolute.

===Morpheme-based morphology===

In morpheme-based morphology, word forms are analyzed as arrangements of morphemes. A morpheme is defined as the minimal meaningful unit of a language. In a word such as &quot;independently&quot;, the morphemes are said to be &quot;in-&quot;, &quot;de-&quot;, &quot;pend&quot;, &quot;-ent&quot;, and &quot;-ly&quot;; &quot;pend&quot; is the (bound) root and the other morphemes are, in this case, derivational affixes. In words such as &quot;dogs&quot;, &quot;dog&quot; is the root and the &quot;-s&quot; is an inflectional morpheme. In its simplest and most naïve form, this way of analyzing word forms, called &quot;item-and-arrangement&quot;, treats words as if they were made of morphemes put after each other (&quot;concatenated&quot;) like beads on a string. More recent and sophisticated approaches, such as distributed morphology, seek to maintain the idea of the morpheme while accommodating non-concatenated, analogical, and other processes that have proven problematic for item-and-arrangement theories and similar approaches.

Morpheme-based morphology presumes three basic axioms:
* Baudouin&#x27;s &quot;single morpheme&quot; hypothesis: Roots and affixes have the same status as morphemes.
* Bloomfield&#x27;s &quot;sign base&quot; morpheme hypothesis: As morphemes, they are dualistic signs, since they have both (phonological) form and meaning.
* Bloomfield&#x27;s &quot;lexical morpheme&quot; hypothesis: morphemes, affixes and roots alike are stored in the lexicon.

Morpheme-based morphology comes in two flavours, one Bloomfieldian and one Hockettian. For Bloomfield, the morpheme was the minimal form with meaning, but did not have meaning itself. For Hockett, morphemes are &quot;meaning elements&quot;, not &quot;form elements&quot;. For him, there is a morpheme plural using allomorphs such as &quot;-s&quot;, &quot;-en&quot; and &quot;-ren&quot;. Within much morpheme-based morphological theory, the two views are mixed in unsystematic ways so a writer may refer to &quot;the morpheme plural&quot; and &quot;the morpheme &quot;-s&quot;&quot; in the same sentence.

===Lexeme-based morphology===
Lexeme-based morphology usually takes what is called an item-and-process approach. Instead of analyzing a word form as a set of morphemes arranged in sequence, a word form is said to be the result of applying rules that alter a word-form or stem in order to produce a new one. An inflectional rule takes a stem, changes it as is required by the rule, and outputs a word form; a derivational rule takes a stem, changes it as per its own requirements, and outputs a derived stem; a compounding rule takes word forms, and similarly outputs a compound stem.

===Word-based morphology===

Word-based morphology is (usually) a word-and-paradigm approach. The theory takes paradigms as a central notion. Instead of stating rules to combine morphemes into word forms or to generate word forms from stems, word-based morphology states generalizations that hold between the forms of inflectional paradigms. The major point behind this approach is that many such generalizations are hard to state with either of the other approaches. Word-and-paradigm approaches are also well-suited to capturing purely morphological phenomena, such as morphomes. Examples to show the effectiveness of word-based approaches are usually drawn from fusional languages, where a given &quot;piece&quot; of a word, which a morpheme-based theory would call an inflectional morpheme, corresponds to a combination of grammatical categories, for example, &quot;third-person plural&quot;. Morpheme-based theories usually have no problems with this situation since one says that a given morpheme has two categories. Item-and-process theories, on the other hand, often break down in cases like these because they all too often assume that there will be two separate rules here, one for third person, and the other for plural, but the distinction between them turns out to be artificial. The approaches treat these as whole words that are related to each other by analogical rules. Words can be categorized based on the pattern they fit into. This applies both to existing words and to new ones. Application of a pattern different from the one that has been used historically can give rise to a new word, such as &quot;older&quot; replacing &quot;elder&quot; (where &quot;older&quot; follows the normal pattern of adjectival comparatives) and &quot;cows&quot; replacing &quot;kine&quot; (where &quot;cows&quot; fits the regular pattern of plural formation).

==Morphological typology==

In the 19th century, philologists devised a now classic classification of languages according to their morphology. Some languages are isolating, and have little to no morphology; others are agglutinative whose words tend to have many easily separable morphemes (such as Turkic languages); others yet are inflectional or fusional because their inflectional morphemes are &quot;fused&quot; together (like some Indo-European languages such as Pashto and Russian). That leads to one bound morpheme conveying multiple pieces of information. A standard example of an isolating language is Chinese. An agglutinative language is Turkish (and practically all Turkic languages). Latin and Greek are prototypical inflectional or fusional languages.

It is clear that this classification is not at all clearcut, and many languages (Latin and Greek among them) do not neatly fit any one of these types, and some fit in more than one way. A continuum of complex morphology of language may be adopted.

The three models of morphology stem from attempts to analyze languages that more or less match different categories in this typology. The item-and-arrangement approach fits very naturally with agglutinative languages. The item-and-process and word-and-paradigm approaches usually address fusional languages.

As there is very little fusion involved in word formation, classical typology mostly applies to inflectional morphology. Depending on the preferred way of expressing non-inflectional notions, languages may be classified as synthetic (using word formation) or analytic (using syntactic phrases).

==Examples==
Pingelapese is a Micronesian language spoken on the Pingelap atoll and on two of the eastern Caroline Islands, called the high island of Pohnpei. Similar to other languages, words in Pingelapese can take different forms to add to or even change its meaning. Verbal suffixes are morphemes added at the end of a word to change its form. Prefixes are those that are added at the front. For example, the Pingelapese suffix –&quot;kin&quot; means &#x27;with&#x27; or &#x27;at.&#x27; It is added at the end of a verb.

:&quot;ius&quot; = to use → &quot;ius-kin&quot; = to use with
: = to be good → = to be good at

&quot;sa-&quot; is an example of a verbal prefix. It is added to the beginning of a word and means &#x27;not.&#x27;

: = to be correct → = to be incorrect

There are also directional suffixes that when added to the root word give the listener a better idea of where the subject is headed. The verb &quot;alu&quot; means to walk. A directional suffix can be used to give more detail.

:&quot;-da&quot; = &#x27;up&#x27; → &quot;aluh-da&quot; = to walk up
:&quot;-d&quot;i = &#x27;down&#x27; → &quot;aluh-di&quot; = to walk down
:&quot;-eng&quot; = &#x27;away from speaker and listener&#x27; → &quot;aluh-eng&quot; = to walk away

Directional suffixes are not limited to motion verbs. When added to non-motion verbs, their meanings are a figurative one. The following table gives some examples of directional suffixes and their possible meanings.

<doc id="20648" wikidata="Q106080" url="?curid=20648" title="Melting">
<text>Melting, or fusion, is a physical process that results in the phase transition of a substance from a solid to a liquid. This occurs when the internal energy of the solid increases, typically by the application of heat or pressure, which increases the substance&#x27;s temperature to the melting point. At the melting point, the ordering of ions or molecules in the solid breaks down to a less ordered state, and the solid melts to become a liquid.

Substances in the molten state generally have reduced viscosity as the temperature increases. An exception to this principle is elemental sulfur, whose viscosity increases in the range of 130 °C to 190 °C due to polymerization.

Some organic compounds melt through mesophases, states of partial order between solid and liquid.

== First order phase transition ==
From a thermodynamics point of view, at the melting point the change in Gibbs free energy &quot;∆G&quot; of the substances is zero, but there are non-zero changes in the enthalpy (&quot;H&quot;) and the entropy (&quot;S&quot;), known respectively as the enthalpy of fusion (or latent heat of fusion) and the entropy of fusion. Melting is therefore classified as a first-order phase transition. Melting occurs when the Gibbs free energy of the liquid becomes lower than the solid for that material. The temperature at which this occurs is dependent on the ambient pressure.

Low-temperature helium is the only known exception to the general rule. Helium-3 has a negative enthalpy of fusion at temperatures below 0.3 K. Helium-4 also has a very slightly negative enthalpy of fusion below 0.8 K. This means that, at appropriate constant pressures, heat must be &quot;removed&quot; from these substances in order to melt them.

==Criteria==

Among the theoretical criteria for melting, the Lindemann and Born criteria are those most frequently used as a basis to analyse the melting conditions.

The Lindemann criterion states that melting occurs because of &quot;vibrational instability&quot;, e.g. crystals melt; when the average amplitude of thermal vibrations of atoms is relatively high compared with interatomic distances, e.g. &lt;&quot;δu2&quot;&gt;1/2 &gt; &quot;δLRs&quot;, where &quot;δu&quot; is the atomic displacement, the Lindemann parameter &quot;δL&quot; ≈ 0.20...0.25 and &quot;Rs&quot; is one-half of the inter-atomic distance. The &quot;Lindemann melting criterion&quot; is supported by experimental data both for crystalline materials and for glass-liquid transitions in amorphous materials.

The Born criterion is based on a rigidity catastrophe caused by the vanishing elastic shear modulus, i.e. when the crystal no longer has sufficient rigidity to mechanically withstand the load, it becomes liquid.

==Supercooling==
Under a standard set of conditions, the melting point of a substance is a characteristic property. The melting point is often equal to the freezing point. However, under carefully created conditions, supercooling, or superheating past the melting or freezing point can occur. Water on a very clean glass surface will often supercool several degrees below the freezing point without freezing. Fine emulsions of pure water have been cooled to −38 °C without nucleation to form ice. Nucleation occurs due to fluctuations in the properties of the material. If the material is kept still there is often nothing (such as physical vibration) to trigger this change, and supercooling (or superheating) may occur. Thermodynamically, the supercooled liquid is in the metastable state with respect to the crystalline phase, and it is likely to crystallize suddenly.

== Glasses==
Glasses are amorphous solids, which are usually fabricated when the molten material cools very rapidly to below its glass transition temperature, without sufficient time for a regular crystal lattice to form. Solids are characterised by a high degree of connectivity between their molecules, and fluids have lower connectivity of their structural blocks. Melting of a solid material can also be considered as a percolation via broken connections between particles e.g. connecting bonds. In this approach melting of an amorphous material occurs, when the broken bonds form a percolation cluster with &quot;Tg&quot; dependent on quasi-equilibrium thermodynamic parameters of bonds e.g. on enthalpy (&quot;Hd&quot;) and entropy (&quot;Sd&quot;) of formation of bonds in a given system at given conditions:

:formula_1

where &quot;fc&quot; is the percolation threshold and &quot;R&quot; is the universal gas constant.

Although &quot;Hd&quot; and &quot;Sd&quot; are not true equilibrium thermodynamic parameters and can depend on the cooling rate of a melt, they can be found from available experimental data on viscosity of amorphous materials.

Even below its melting point, quasi-liquid films can be observed on crystalline surfaces. The thickness of the film is temperature-dependent. This effect is common for all crystalline materials. This pre-melting shows its effects in e.g. frost heave, the growth of snowflakes, and, taking grain boundary interfaces into account, maybe even in the movement of glaciers.

==Related concept==

In ultrashort pulse physics, a so-called nonthermal melting may take place. It occurs not because of the increase of the atomic kinetic energy, but because of changes of the interatomic potential due to excitation of electrons. Since electrons are acting like a glue sticking atoms together, heating electrons by a femtosecond laser alters the properties of this &quot;glue&quot;, which may break the bonds between the atoms and melt a material even without an increase of the atomic temperature.

In genetics, melting DNA means to separate the double-stranded DNA into two single strands by heating or the use of chemical agents, polymerase chain reaction.

<doc id="20650" wikidata="Q722612" url="?curid=20650" title="Macroevolution">
<text>Macroevolution comprises the evolutionary processes and patterns which occur at and above the species level. In contrast, microevolution is evolution occurring within the population(s) of a single species. In other words, microevolution is the scale of evolution that is limited to intraspecific (within-species) variation, while macroevolution extends to interspecific (between-species) variation. The evolution of new species (speciation) is an example of macroevolution. This is the common definition for &#x27;macroevolution&#x27; used by contemporary scientists. Although, the exact usage of the term has varied throughout history.

Macroevolution addresses the evolution of species and higher taxonomic groups (genera, families, orders, etc) and uses evidence from phylogenetics, the fossil record, and molecular biology to answer how different taxonomic groups exhibit different species diversity and/or morphological disparity.

== Origin and changing meaning of the term ==
After Charles Darwin published his book &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; in 1859, evolution was widely accepted to be real phenomenon. However, many scientists still disagreed with Darwin that natural selection was the primary mechanism to explain evolution. Prior to the modern synthesis, during the period between the 1880s to the 1930s (dubbed the ‘Eclipse of Darwinism’) many scientists argued in favor of alternative explanations. These included ‘orthogenesis’, and among its proponents was the Russian entomologist Yuri A. Filipchenko. 

Filipchenko appears to have been the one who coined the term ‘macroevolution’ in his book &quot;Variabilität und Variation&quot; (1927). While introducing the concept, he claimed that the field of genetics is insufficient to explain &quot;“the origin of higher systematic units”&quot; above the species level.

Regarding the origin of higher systematic units, Filipchenko stated his claim that ‘like-produces-like’. A taxon must originate from other taxa of equivalent rank. A new species must come from an old species, a genus from an older genus, a family from another family, etc. 

Filipchenko believed this was the only way to explain the origin of the major characters that define species and especially higher taxonomic groups (genera, families, orders, etc). For example, the origin of families must require the sudden appearance of new traits which are different in greater magnitude compared to the characters required for the origin of a genus or species. However, this view is no longer consistent with contemporary understanding of evolution. Furthermore, the Linnaean ranks of ‘genus’ (and higher) are not real entities but artificial concepts which break down when they are combined with the process of evolution.

Nevertheless, Filipchenko’s distinction between microevolution and macroevolution had a major impact on the development of evolutionary science. The term was adopted by Filipchenko&#x27;s protégé Theodosius Dobzhansky in his book &quot;‘Genetics und the Origin of Species’&quot; (1937), a seminal piece that contributed to the development of the Modern Synthesis. ‘Macroevolution’ was also adopted by those who used it to criticize the Modern Synthesis. A notable example of this was the book &quot;The Material Basis of Evolution&quot; (1940) by the geneticist Richard Goldschmidt, a close friend of Filipchenko. Goldschmidt suggested saltational evolutionary changes either due to mutations that affect the rates of developmental processes or due to alterations in the chromosomal pattern. Particularly the latter idea was widely rejected by the modern synthesis, but the hopeful monster concept based on Evolutionary developmental biology (or evo-devo) explanations found a moderate revival in recent times. Occasionally such dramatic changes can lead to novel features that survive.

As an alternative to saltational evolution, Dobzhansky suggested that the difference between macroevolution and microevolution reflects essentially a difference in time-scales, and that macroevolutionary changes were simply the sum of microevolutionary changes over geologic time. This view became broadly accepted, and accordingly, the term macroevolution has been used widely as a neutral label for the study of evolutionary changes that take place over a very large time-scale. Further, species selection suggests that selection among species is a major evolutionary factor that is independent from and complementary to selection among organisms. Accordingly, the level of selection has become the conceptual basis of a third definition, which defines macroevolution as evolution through selection among interspecific variation.

== Microevolution vs Macroevolution ==

The fact that both micro- and macroevolution (including common descent) are supported by overwhelming evidence remains uncontroversial within the scientific community. However, there has been considerable debate over the past 80 years regarding causal and explanatory connection between microevolution and macroevolution.

The ‘Extrapolation’ view holds there is no fundamental difference between the two aside from scale; i.e. macroevolution is merely cumulative microevolution. Hence, the patterns observed at the macroevolutionary scale can be explained by microevolutionary processes over long periods of time. 

The ‘Decoupled’ view holds that microevolutionary processes are decoupled from macroevolutionary processes because there are separate macroevolutionary processes that cannot be sufficiently explained by microevolutionary processes alone. 

&quot; ... macroevolutionary processes are underlain by microevolutionary phenomena and are compatible with microevolutionary theories, but macroevolutionary studies require the formulation of autonomous hypotheses and models (which must be tested using macroevolutionary evidence). In this (epistemologically) very important sense, macroevolution is decoupled from microevolution: macroevolution is an autonomous field of evolutionary study.&quot;
                           Francisco J. Ayala (1983)

Many scientists see macroevolution as a field of study rather than a distinct process that is similar to the process of microevolution. Thus, macroevolution is concerned with the history of life and macroevolutionary explanations encompasses ecology, paleontology, mass extinctions, plate tectonics, and unique events such as the Cambrian explosion.

Within microevolution, the evolutionary process of changing heritable characteristics (e.g. changes in allele frequencies) is described by population genetics, with mechanisms such as mutation, natural selection, and genetic drift. However, the scope of evolution can be expanded to higher scales where different observations are made. Macroevolutionary mechanisms are provided to explain these. For example, speciation can be discussed in terms of the ‘mode’, i.e. how speciation occurs. Different modes of speciation include sympatric and allopatric). Additionally, scientists research the &#x27;tempo&#x27; of speciation, i.e. the rate at which species change genetically and/or morphologically. Classically, competing hypothesis for the tempo of specieation include phyletic gradualism and punctuated equilibrium). Lastly, what are the causes of speciation is also extensively researched. 

More questions can be asked regarding the evolution of species and higher taxonomic groups (genera, families, orders, etc), and how these have evolved across geography and vast spans of geological time. Such questions are researched from various fields of science. This makes the study of &#x27;macroevolution&#x27; interdisciplinary. For example: 

* How different species are related to each other via common ancestry. This topic is researched in the field of phylogenetics.
* The rates of evolutionary change and across time in the fossil record. Why do some groups experience a lot of change while others remain morphologically stable? The latter case are often called &#x27;living fossils&#x27;. However, this term is criticized for wrongly implying that such species have not evolved. The term &#x27;stabilomorph&#x27; has been proposed instead.
* The impacts and causes of major events in palaeontological history, including mass extinctions and evolutionary diversifications. Prominent examples of mass extinctions are the Permian-Triassic and Cretaceous-Paleogene events. In contrast, famous evolutionary radiations include the Cambrian Explosion and Cretaceous Terrestrial Revolution.
* Why different species or high taxonomic groups (even in spite of having similar ages) exhibit different survival/extinction rates, species diversity, and/or morphological disparity. 
* The observation of long-term trends in evolution. Evolutionary trends can be passive (resembling diffusion) or driven (directional). A related question is whether these trends are directed in some way, e.g. towards complexity or simplicity. 
* How the distinctive and of complext traits, which differentiate species and higher taxa from another, have evolved. Examples of this include gene duplication, heterochrony, novelty in evodevo from facilitated variation, and constructive neutral evolution.

==Macroevolutionary processes==

=== Speciation ===

According to the modern definition, the evolutionary transition from the ancestral to the daughter species is microevolutionary, because it results from selection (or, more generally, sorting) among varying organisms. However, speciation has also a macroevolutionary aspect, because it produces the interspecific variation species selection operates on. Another macroevolutionary aspect of speciation is the rate at which it successfully occurs, analogous to reproductive success in microevolution.

Speciation is the process in which populations within one species change to an extent at which they become reproductively isolated, that is, they cannot interbreed anymore. However, this classical concept has been challenged and more recently, a phylogenetic or evolutionary species concept has been adopted. Their main criteria for new species is to be diagnosable and monophyletic, that is, they form a clearly defined lineage.

Charles Darwin first discovered that speciation can be extrapolated so that species not only evolve into new species, but also into new genera, families and other groups of animals. In other words, macroevolution is reducible to microevolution through selection of traits over long periods of time. In addition, some scholars have argued that selection at the species level is important as well. The advent of genome sequencing enabled the discovery of gradual genetic changes both during speciation but also across higher taxa. For instance, the evolution of humans from ancestral primates or other mammals can be traced to numerous but individual mutations.

=== Evolution of new organs and tissues ===
One of the main questions in evolutionary biology is how new structures evolve, such as new organs. Macroevolution is often thought to require the evolution of structures that are &#x27;completely new&#x27;. However, fundamentally novel structures are not necessary for dramatic evolutionary change. As can be seen in vertebrate evolution, most &quot;new&quot; organs are actually not new—they are simply modifications of previously existing organs. For instance, the evolution of mammal diversity in the past 100 million years has not required any major innovation. All of this diversity can be explained by modification of existing organs, such as the evolution of elephant tusks from incisors. Other examples include wings (modified limbs), feathers (modified reptile scales), lungs (modified swim bladders, e.g. found in fish), or even the heart (a muscularized segment of a vein).

The same concept applies to the evolution of &quot;novel&quot; tissues. Even fundamental tissues such as bone can evolve from combining existing proteins (collagen) with calcium phosphate (specifically, hydroxy-apatite). This probably happened when certain cells that make collagen also accumulated calcium phosphate to get a proto-bone cell.

=== Molecular macroevolution ===
Microevolution is facilitated by mutations, the vast majority of which have no or very small effects on gene or protein function. For instance, the activity of an enzyme may be slightly changed or the stability of a protein slightly altered. However, occasionally mutations can dramatically change the structure and functions of protein. This may be called &quot;molecular macroevolution&quot;.

Protein function. There are countless cases in which protein function is dramatically altered by mutations. For instance, a mutation in acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (EC:1.2.1.10) can change it to a 4-hydroxy-2-oxopentanoate pyruvate lyase (EC:4.1.3.39), i.e., a mutation that changes an enzyme from one to another EC class (there are only 7 main classes of enzymes). Another example is the conversion of a yeast galactokinase (Gal1) to a transcription factor (Gal3) which can be achieved by an insertion of only two amino acids.

While some mutations may not change the molecular function of a protein significantly, their biological function may be dramatically changed. For instance, most brain receptors recognize specific neurotransmitters, but that specificity can easily be changed by mutations. This has been shown by acetylcholine receptors that can be changed to serotonin or glycine receptors which actually have very different functions. Their similar gene structure also indicates that they must have arisen from gene duplications.

Protein structure. Although protein structures are highly conserved, sometimes one or a few mutations can dramatically change a protein. For instance, an IgG-binding, 4formula_1+formula_2 fold can be transformed into an albumin-binding, 3-α fold via a single amino-acid mutation. This example also shows that such a transition can happen with neither function nor native structure being completely lost. In other words, even when multiple mutations are required to convert one protein or structure into another, the structure and function is at least partially retained in the intermediary sequences. Similarly, domains can be converted into other domains (and thus other functions). For instance, the structures of SH3 folds can evolve into OB folds which in turn can evolve into CLB folds.

==Examples==

=== Evolutionary faunas ===
A macroevolutionary benchmark study is Sepkoski&#x27;s work on marine animal diversity through the Phanerozoic. His iconic diagram of the numbers of marine families from the Cambrian to the Recent illustrates the successive expansion and dwindling of three &quot;evolutionary faunas&quot; that were characterized by differences in origination rates and carrying capacities. Long-term ecological changes and major geological events are postulated to have played crucial roles in shaping these evolutionary faunas.

=== Stanley&#x27;s rule ===
Macroevolution is driven by differences between species in origination and extinction rates. Remarkably, these two factors are generally positively correlated: taxa that have typically high diversification rates also have high extinction rates. This observation has been described first by Steven Stanley, who attributed it to a variety of ecological factors. Yet, a positive correlation of origination and extinction rates is also a prediction of the Red Queen hypothesis, which postulates that evolutionary progress (increase in fitness) of any given species causes a decrease in fitness of other species, ultimately driving to extinction those species that do not adapt rapidly enough. High rates of origination must therefore correlate with high rates of extinction. Stanley&#x27;s rule, which applies to almost all taxa and geologic ages, is therefore an indication for a dominant role of biotic interactions in macroevolution.

=== &quot;Macromutations&quot;: Single mutations leading to dramatic change ===

While the vast majority of mutations are inconsequential, some can have a dramatic effect on morphology or other features of an organism. One of the best studied cases of a single mutation that leads to massive structural change is the Ultrabithorax mutation in fruit flies. The mutation duplicates the wings of a fly to make it look like a dragonfly, a different order of insect.

=== Evolution of multicellularity ===

The evolution of multicellular organisms is one of the major breakthroughs in evolution. The first step of converting a unicellular organism into a metazoan (a multicellular organism) is to allow cells to attach to each other. This can be achieved by one or a few mutations. In fact, many bacteria form multicellular assemblies, e.g. cyanobacteria or myxobacteria. Another species of bacteria, &quot;Jeongeupia sacculi&quot;, form well-ordered sheets of cells, which ultimately develop into a bulbous structure. Similarly, unicellular yeast cells can become multicellular by a single mutation in the ACE2 gene, which causes the cells to form a branched multicellular form.

=== Evolution of bat wings ===
The wings of bats have the same structural elements (bones) as any other five-fingered mammal (see periodicity in limb development). However, the finger bones in bats are dramatically elongated, so the question is how these bones became so long. It has been shown that certain growth factors such as bone morphogenetic proteins (specifically Bmp2) is over expressed so that it stimulates an elongation of certain bones. Genetic changes in the bat genome identified the changes that lead to this phenotype and it has been recapitulated in mice: when specific bat DNA is inserted in the mouse genome, recapitulating these mutations, the bones of mice grow longer.

=== Limb loss in lizards and snakes ===
Snakes evolved from lizards. Phylogenetic analysis shows that snakes are actually nested within the phylogenetic tree of lizards, demonstrating that they have a common ancestor. This split happened about 180 million years ago and several intermediary fossils are known to document the origin. In fact, limbs have been lost in numerous clades of reptiles, and there are cases of recent limb loss. For instance, the skink genus &quot;Lerista&quot; has lost limbs in multiple cases, with all possible intermediary steps, that is, there are species which have fully developed limbs, shorter limbs with 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 or no toes at all.

=== Human evolution ===
While human evolution from their primate ancestors did not require massive morphological changes, our brain has sufficiently changed to allow human consciousness and intelligence. While the latter involves relatively minor morphological changes it did result in dramatic changes to brain function. Thus, macroevolution does not have to be morphological, it can also be functional.

=== Evolution of viviparity in lizards ===

Most lizards are egg-laying and thus need an environment that is warm enough to incubate their eggs. However, some species have evolved viviparity, that is, they give birth to live young, as almost all mammals do. In several clades of lizards, egg-laying (oviparous) species have evolved into live-bearing ones, apparently with very little genetic change. For instance, a European common lizard, &quot;Zootoca vivipara&quot;, is viviparous throughout most of its range, but oviparous in the extreme southwest portion. That is, within a single species, a radical change in reproductive behavior has happened. Similar cases are known from South American lizards of the genus &quot;Liolaemus&quot; which have egg-laying species at lower altitudes, but closely related viviparous species at higher altitudes, suggesting that the switch from oviparous to viviparous reproduction does not require many genetic changes.

=== Behavior: Activity pattern in mice ===
Most animals are either active at night or during the day. However, some species switched their activity pattern from day to night or vice versa. For instance, the African striped mouse (&quot;Rhabdomys pumilio&quot;), transitioned from the ancestrally nocturnal behavior of its close relatives to a diurnal one. Genome sequencing and transcriptomics revealed that this transition was achieved by modifying genes in the rod phototransduction pathway, among others.

<text>Martin Waldseemüller ( – 16 March 1520) was a German cartographer and humanist scholar. Sometimes known by the Hellenized form of his name, Hylacomylus, his work was influential among contemporary cartographers. His collaborator Matthias Ringmann and he are credited with the first recorded usage of the word &quot;America&quot; to name a portion of the New World in honour of Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci, coming from the Old High German name Emmerich, in a world map they delineated in 1507. Waldseemüller was also the first to map South America as a continent separate from Asia, the first to produce a printed globe, and the first to create a printed wall map of Europe. A set of his maps printed as an appendix to the 1513 edition of Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot; is considered to be the first example of a modern atlas.

==Life and works==
Details of Waldseemüller&#x27;s life are scarce. He was born around 1470 in the German town of Wolfenweiler. His father was a butcher and moved to Freiburg (now Freiburg im Breisgau) in about 1480. Records show that Waldseemüller was enrolled in 1490 at the University of Freiburg, where Gregor Reisch, a noted humanist scholar, was one of his influential teachers; the printer Johannes Schott was his classmate. After finishing at the university, he lived in Basel, where he was ordained a priest, and apparently, gained experience in printing and engraving while working with the printer community in Basel.

Around 1500, an association of humanist scholars formed in Saint Dié, in the Duchy of Lorraine, under the patronage of René II, Duke of Lorraine. They called themselves the &quot;Gymnasium Vosagense&quot; and their leader was Walter Lud. Their initial intention was to publish a new edition of Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot;. Waldseemüller was invited to join the group and contribute his skills as a cartographer. How he came to the group&#x27;s attention is unclear, but Lud later described him as a master cartographer. Matthias Ringmann was also brought into the group because of his previous work with the &quot;Geography&quot; and his knowledge of Greek and Latin. Ringmann and Waldseemüller soon became friends and collaborators.

===1507 world map===
In 1506, the &quot;Gymnasium&quot; obtained a French translation of the Soderini Letter, a booklet attributed to Amerigo Vespucci that provided a sensational account of four alleged Vespucci voyages to explore the coast of lands recently discovered in the western Atlantic. The &quot;Gymnasium&quot; surmised that this was the &quot;new world&quot; or the &quot;antipodes&quot; hypothesized by classical writers. The Soderini Letter gave Vespucci credit for discovery of this new continent and implied that newly obtained Portuguese maps were based on his explorations. They decided to put aside the &quot;Geography&quot; for the moment and publish a brief &quot;Introduction to Cosmography&quot; with an accompanying world map. The &quot;Introduction&quot; was written by Ringmann and included a Latin translation of the Soderini Letter. In a preface to the letter, Ringmann wrote 
&quot;I see no reason why anyone could properly disapprove of a name derived from that of Amerigo, the discoverer, a man of sagacious genius. A suitable form would be Amerige, meaning Land of Amerigo, or America, since Europe and Asia have received women&#x27;s names.&quot;

While Ringmann was writing the &quot;Introduction&quot;, Waldseemüller focused on the creation of a world map using an aggregation of sources, including maps based on the works of Ptolemy, Henricus Martellus, Alberto Cantino, and Nicolò de Caverio. In addition to a large 12-panel wall map, Waldseemüller created a smaller, simplified globe. The wall map was decorated with prominent portraits of Ptolemy and Vespucci. The map and globe were notable for showing the New World as a continent separate from Asia and for naming the southern landmass America. By April 1507, the map, globe and accompanying book, &quot;Introduction to Cosmography&quot;, were published. A thousand copies were printed and sold throughout Europe.

The &quot;Introduction&quot; and map were a great success, and four editions were printed in the first year alone. The map was widely used in universities and was influential among cartographers who admired the craftsmanship that went into its creation. In the following years, other maps were printed that often incorporated the name America. Although Waldseemüller had intended the name to apply only to a specific part of Brazil, other maps applied it to the entire continent. In 1538, Gerardus Mercator used America to name both the north and south continents on his influential map, and by this point, the name was securely fixed on the New World.

===Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot; (1513)===
After 1507, Waldseemüller and Ringmann continued to collaborate on a new edition of Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot;. In 1508, Ringmann travelled to Italy and obtained a Greek manuscript of &quot;Geography&quot; (&quot;Codex Vaticanum Graecorum 191&quot;). With this key reference, they continued to make progress and Waldseemüller was able to finish his maps. Completion was forestalled, though, when their patron, Duke René II, died in 1508. The new edition was finally printed in 1513 by Johannes Schott in Strasbourg. By then, Waldseemüller had pulled out of the project and was not credited for his cartographic work. Nevertheless, his maps were recognized as important contributions to the science of cartography and were considered a standard reference work for many decades.

About 20 of Waldseemüller&#x27;s &quot;tabulae modernae&quot; (modern maps) were included in the new &quot;Geography&quot; as a separate appendix, &quot;Claudii Ptolemaei Supplementem&quot;. This supplement constitutes the first modern atlas. Maps of Lorraine and the upper Rhine region were the first printed maps of those regions and were probably based on survey work done by Waldseemüller himself.

The world map published in the 1513 &quot;Geography&quot; seems to indicate that Waldseemüller had second thoughts about the name and the nature of the lands discovered in the western Atlantic. The New World was no longer clearly shown as a continent separate from Asia, and the name America had been replaced with &quot;Terra Incognita&quot; (Unknown Land). What caused him to make these changes is not clear, but perhaps he was influenced by contemporary criticism that Vespucci had usurped Columbus&#x27;s primacy of discovery.

===Other works===
Waldseemüller was also interested in surveying and surveying instruments. In 1508, he contributed a treatise on surveying and perspective to the fourth edition of Gregor Reisch&#x27;s &quot;Margarita Philosophica&quot;. He included an illustration of a forerunner to the theodolite, a surveying instrument he called the polimetrum. In 1511, he published the &quot;Carta Itineraria Europae&quot;, a road map of Europe that showed important trade routes and pilgrim routes from central Europe to Santiago de Compostela, Spain. It was the first printed wall map of Europe.

In 1516, he produced another large-scale wall map of the world, the &quot;Carta Marina Navigatoria&quot;, printed in Strasbourg. It was designed in the style of portolan charts and consisted of 12 printed sheets.

The Paris Green Globe (or &quot;Globe vert&quot;), has been attributed to Waldseemüller by experts at the Bibliothèque Nationale, but the attribution is not universally accepted.

Waldseemüller died without a will on 16 March 1520 in Saint Dié in the Upper Rhenish Circle of the Holy Roman Empire, where he had served as a canon in the collegiate Church of Saint Dié since 1514.

==1507 map rediscovered==

The 1507 wall map was lost for a long time, but a copy was found in Schloss Wolfegg in southern Germany by Joseph Fischer in 1901. It is the only known copy and was purchased by the United States Library of Congress in May 2003. Five copies of Waldseemüller&#x27;s globular map survive in the form of &quot;gores&quot;: printed map sections that were intended to be cut out and pasted onto a wooden globe.

<doc id="20653" wikidata="Q83431" url="?curid=20653" title="Megadeth">
<text>Megadeth is an American thrash metal band formed in Los Angeles in 1983 by vocalist/guitarist Dave Mustaine. Known for their technically complex guitar work and musicianship, Megadeth is one of the &quot;big four&quot; of American thrash metal along with Metallica, Anthrax and Slayer, responsible for the genre&#x27;s development and popularization. Their music features complex arrangements and fast rhythm sections, dual lead guitars, and lyrical themes of war, politics, religion, death, and personal relationships.

In 1985, Megadeth released their debut album, &quot;Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!&quot;, on the independent record label Combat Records, to moderate success. It caught the attention of bigger labels, which led to Megadeth signing with Capitol Records. Their first major-label album, &quot;Peace Sells... but Who&#x27;s Buying?&quot;, was released in 1986 and was a major hit with the underground metal scene. Band members&#x27; substance abuse issues and personal disputes had brought Megadeth negative publicity during the late 1980s. Nonetheless, the band went on to release a number of platinum-selling albums, including &quot;So Far, So Good... So What!&quot; (1988), &quot;Rust in Peace&quot; (1990) and &quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot; (1992). These albums, along with worldwide tours, brought them public recognition. Megadeth&#x27;s most recent album, &quot;The Sick, the Dying... and the Dead!&quot;, was released in 2022.

Megadeth has undergone multiple lineup changes throughout its -year career, with Mustaine being the sole consistent member of the band. The band temporarily disbanded in 2002 when Mustaine suffered an arm injury and re-established in 2004 without longtime bassist David Ellefson, who had taken legal action against Mustaine. Ellefson settled out of court and rejoined the band in 2010, but was fired in 2021 amid allegations of sexual misconduct. Megadeth&#x27;s current lineup includes Mustaine, bassist James LoMenzo, guitarist Teemu Mäntysaari and drummer Dirk Verbeuren.

Megadeth earned platinum certifications in the United States for five of its sixteen studio albums, and has received twelve Grammy nominations. Megadeth won its first Grammy Award in 2017 for the song &quot;Dystopia&quot; in the Best Metal Performance category. The band&#x27;s mascot, Vic Rattlehead, regularly appears on album artwork and live shows. Megadeth has hosted its own music festival, Gigantour, several times since July 2005, and held its first MegaCruise in October 2019. , the band sold more than fifty million albums worldwide.

==History==
===1983–1985: Formation and &quot;Killing Is My Business&quot;===

On April 11, 1983, Dave Mustaine was fired from Metallica just prior to the band recording their debut album &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot; due to substance abuse and personal conflicts with James Hetfield kicking his dog. As Metallica&#x27;s lead guitarist since 1981, Mustaine had composed some of the group&#x27;s early songs and helped hone the band into a tight live unit. Afterward, Mustaine vowed revenge by forming a band that was faster and heavier than Metallica. On the bus trip back to Los Angeles, Mustaine found a pamphlet by California senator Alan Cranston that read: &quot;The arsenal of megadeath can&#x27;t be rid no matter what the peace treaties come to.&quot; The term &quot;Megadeath&quot; stuck with Mustaine and he wrote a song with that title with the spelling slightly changed to Megadeth, which, according to Mustaine, represented the annihilation of power.

After arriving back in Los Angeles, Mustaine began the search for new bandmates for his band. He formed the band Fallen Angels, which included Lor Kane on vocals, Robby McKinney on guitar and Matt Kisselstein on bass, in April 1983. The band&#x27;s name was changed to Megadeth on Kane&#x27;s recommendation. As the founder, Mustaine added his new neighbors David Ellefson and Greg Handevidt to the band, who had moved from Minnesota to Los Angeles and played bass and guitar, respectively. Ellefson has stated that Handevidt, rather than Kane, came up with the idea to change the band name. A demo was recorded by the lineup (which had expanded to include Richard Girod on drums), though the band realized that they would have to retool some of the songs following the release of Metallica&#x27;s debut album, in July 1983. The only Metallica-era song that ended up on Megadeth&#x27;s debut album was &quot;Mechanix&quot;. Songs from that time period included &quot;No Time&quot;, &quot;Self Destruct&quot;, &quot;Hair Pin Trigger&quot;, &quot;Speak No Evil&quot;, &quot;Eye for Eye&quot; and &quot;Heaven Knows&quot;. &quot;No Time&quot; was an early title for &quot;Set the World Afire&quot;, &quot;Self Destruct&quot; was the original title for &quot;Mary Jane&quot; and &quot;Speak No Evil&quot; was the original title of &quot;Looking Down the Cross&quot;,

While Handevidt would only last a few months, Mustaine and Ellefson formed a tight musical bond. Despite his enthusiasm, Mustaine had trouble finding other members to fill out the lineup. He and Ellefson auditioned about 15 drummers, hoping to find one who understood meter changes in music. After briefly playing with Dijon Carruthers, they selected Lee Rauch. Following six months of trying to find a lead singer, Mustaine decided to perform lead vocals himself. Singers who temporarily joined the band included Billy Bonds and John Cyriis, who would found Agent Steel after his firing from Megadeth.

In 1984, Megadeth recorded a three-song demo tape featuring Mustaine, Ellefson and Rauch. The demo tape, &quot;Last Rites&quot;, was released on March 9, 1984. It featured early versions of &quot;Last Rites/Loved to Death&quot;, &quot;The Skull Beneath the Skin&quot; and &quot;Mechanix&quot;, all of which appeared on the band&#x27;s debut album. The band was unable to find a compatible second guitarist. Kerry King of Slayer filled in on rhythm guitar for several shows in the San Francisco area in 1984, starting with the debut gig on February 17 at Ruthie&#x27;s Inn in Berkeley, California, as well as a gig at The Keystone in Berkeley that April and would play five shows in total with the band. King went back to Slayer and Rauch was replaced with jazz fusion drummer Gar Samuelson. Samuelson officially joined Megadeth on October 24, 1984. Samuelson had previously been in the jazz band The New Yorkers with guitarist Chris Poland. After seeing Samuelson perform with Megadeth as a trio, Poland went backstage and suggested an impromptu audition as lead guitarist for the band; he joined Megadeth in December 1984.

After considering several labels, Mustaine signed the band to Combat Records, a New York-based Independent record label that offered Megadeth the highest budget to record and tour. In 1985, Combat Records gave the band $8,000 to record and produce its debut album. After spending $4,000 of the budget on drugs, alcohol and food, the band fired the original producer and finished the recording themselves.

Despite its low-fidelity sound, &quot;Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!&quot; was relatively successful in underground metal circles and attracted major-label interest. The band was calling itself State Of The Art Speed Metal. Music writer Joel McIver praised its &quot;blistering technicality&quot; and stated that the album &quot;raised the bar for the whole thrash metal scene, with guitarists forced to perform even more accurately and powerfully&quot;. The front cover marked the debut of band mascot Vic Rattlehead, who regularly appeared on subsequent album artwork.

&quot;Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!&quot; features &quot;Mechanix&quot;, a song Mustaine wrote during his time with Metallica. Though Mustaine told the band after his dismissal not to use the music he had written, Metallica recorded a different version of the song, &quot;The Four Horsemen&quot;, with a slower tempo and a melodic middle section. The album also included a cover of Nancy Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;These Boots Are Made for Walkin&#x27;&quot;, at a faster tempo and with altered lyrics. Megadeth&#x27;s version generated controversy during the 1990s, when its writer, Lee Hazlewood, called Mustaine&#x27;s changes &quot;vile and offensive&quot;. Under threat of legal action, the song was removed from pressings released from 1995 to 2001.

In mid-1985, on a bill with Canadian speed metal band Exciter, Megadeth played its first North American tour: the Killing for a Living Tour. Guitarist Mike Albert replaced Poland, who was battling drug addiction. Although Albert was originally supposed to be a permanent replacement, Poland rejoined Megadeth in October 1985, shortly before the group began recording its second album for Combat.

===1986–1987: &quot;Peace Sells... but Who&#x27;s Buying?&quot;===
According to Mustaine, Megadeth was under pressure to deliver another successful album: &quot;That sophomore offering is the &#x27;be-all or end-all&#x27; of any band. You either go to the next level, or it&#x27;s the beginning of the nadir.&quot; Mustaine composed the music for the album, with the other members adding arrangement ideas.

The album was produced on a $25,000 budget from Combat Records. Dissatisfied with its financial limitations, the band left Combat and signed with Capitol Records. Capitol bought the rights to the album, and hired producer Paul Lani to remix the earlier recordings. Released in late 1986, &quot;Peace Sells... but Who&#x27;s Buying?&quot; has clearer production and more sophisticated songwriting. Mustaine wanted to write socially conscious lyrics, unlike mainstream heavy metal bands who sang about &quot;hedonistic pleasures&quot;. The album was noted for its political commentary and helped Megadeth expand its fanbase. The title track was the album&#x27;s second single, and was accompanied by a music video that received regular airplay on MTV.

In February 1987, Megadeth was the opening act on Alice Cooper&#x27;s &quot;Constrictor&quot; tour, and the following month began its first headlining world tour in the United Kingdom. The 72-week tour was supported by Overkill and Necros, and continued in the United States. During the tour, Mustaine and Ellefson considered firing Samuelson for his drug abuse. According to Mustaine, Samuelson had become too much to handle when intoxicated. Drummer Chuck Behler traveled with Megadeth for the last dates of the tour as the other band members feared Samuelson would not be able to continue. Poland quarreled with Mustaine, and was accused of selling band equipment to buy heroin. As a result, Samuelson and Poland were asked to leave Megadeth in 1987, with Behler becoming the band&#x27;s full-time drummer.

Poland was initially replaced by Jay Reynolds of Malice, but as the band began working on its next record, Reynolds was replaced by his guitar teacher, Jeff Young, when Megadeth was six weeks into the recording of its third album.

===1988–1989: &quot;So Far, So Good... So What!&quot;===
With a major-label budget, the Paul Lani-produced &quot;So Far, So Good... So What!&quot; took over five months to record. The production was plagued with problems, partially due to Mustaine&#x27;s struggle with drug addiction. Mustaine later said: &quot;The production of &quot;So Far, So Good... So What!&quot; was horrible, mostly due to substances and the priorities we had or didn&#x27;t have at the time.&quot; Mustaine clashed with Lani, beginning with Lani&#x27;s insistence that the drums be recorded separately from the cymbals, an unheard-of process for rock drummers. Mustaine and Lani became estranged during the mixing, and Lani was replaced by Michael Wagener, who remixed the album.

&quot;So Far, So Good... So What!&quot; was released in January 1988 and was well received by fans and critics. The album featured a cover version of the Sex Pistols&#x27; &quot;Anarchy in the U.K.&quot;; Mustaine changed the lyrics, later saying that he had simply heard them incorrectly. To support the album, Megadeth embarked on a world tour that lasted for nearly eight months. The band (along with Savatage) opened for Dio on the &quot;Dream Evil&quot; tour and supported Iron Maiden on their &quot;Seventh Son of a Seventh Son&quot; tour, both in the United States. They also headlined a North American tour with Warlock and Sanctuary (whose debut album &quot;Refuge Denied&quot; was produced by Mustaine), and a European trek with Testament, Nuclear Assault, Flotsam and Jetsam and Sanctuary.

In June 1988, Megadeth appeared in Penelope Spheeris&#x27; documentary &quot;The Decline of Western Civilization Part II: The Metal Years&quot;. The documentary chronicled the Los Angeles heavy metal scene of the late 1980s, and Spheeris, who had directed Megadeth in the video for &quot;Wake Up Dead&quot;, decided to include them to feature a more serious band in contrast to the glam metal groups. Mustaine remembered the film as a disappointment, as it aligned Megadeth with &quot;a bunch of shit bands&quot;.

In August, the band appeared at the Monsters of Rock festival at Castle Donington in the United Kingdom, performing to an audience of more than 100,000. One show featured a guest appearance by Metallica drummer (and Mustaine&#x27;s former bandmate) Lars Ulrich. The band was added to the Monsters of Rock European tour, but left after the first show due to Ellefson&#x27;s drug problems, for which he was treated immediately. Megadeth was replaced by Testament.

Shortly after the Monsters of Rock appearance, Mustaine fired Behler and Young and canceled Megadeth&#x27;s Australian tour. &quot;On the road, things escalated from a small border skirmish into a full-on raging war,&quot; Mustaine later recalled. &quot;I think a lot of us were inconsistent because of [drugs].&quot; During the tour, Mustaine noticed problems developing with Behler and brought in drummer Nick Menza as Behler&#x27;s drum technician. As with Samuelson, Menza was expected to take over if Behler could not continue the tour. Menza replaced Behler in 1989. Young&#x27;s dismissal resulted from Mustaine&#x27;s suspicions that he was having an affair with Mustaine&#x27;s then-girlfriend, an allegation Young denied.

The band was unable to quickly find a suitable replacement for Young. Although 1989 marked the first time since its inception that Megadeth did not tour nor perform at least one show, they recorded a cover version of Alice Cooper&#x27;s &quot;No More Mr. Nice Guy&quot; which appeared on the soundtrack to the Wes Craven horror movie &quot;Shocker&quot;. The video was directed by Penelope Spheeris, who recalled the filming as a &quot;Herculean task&quot; as Mustaine was unable to play guitar because of his drug addiction. During the March 1989 auditions for a new lead guitarist, Mustaine was arrested for driving under the influence and possession of narcotics after crashing into a parked vehicle occupied by an off-duty police officer. Mustaine entered court-ordered drug rehabilitation shortly afterwards, and became drug-free for the first time in ten years.

===1990–1991: &quot;Rust in Peace&quot;===
With Mustaine sober, Megadeth continued searching for a new lead guitarist. Guns N&#x27; Roses guitarist Slash had been jamming with Mustaine and Ellefson, and although it seemed that he might join Megadeth, he remained with Guns N&#x27; Roses. Dimebag Darrell of Pantera was offered the job, but the deal fell through after Mustaine refused his request to recruit his brother, Pantera drummer Vinnie Paul, as he had already hired Menza. The offer was also extended to Criss Oliva who also declined as he did not want to leave Savatage. Jeff Loomis, who would later go on to form progressive metal titans Nevermore, also auditioned though Mustaine deemed him too young to join as Loomis was only 18 at the time.
Marty Friedman filled the guitarist position at the recommendation of Ron Laffitte, a member of Capitol management. Laffitte had heard &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Kiss&quot;, a solo recording by Friedman when he was in Cacophony. Mustaine and Ellefson were satisfied with Friedman&#x27;s style and thought that he understood Megadeth&#x27;s music. With Friedman in the group, the band completed what fans consider the definitive Megadeth lineup. The revitalized band entered the studio at Rumbo Recorders in March 1990 with co-producer Mike Clink to begin Megadeth&#x27;s most critically acclaimed album, &quot;Rust in Peace&quot;. Clink was the first producer to complete a Megadeth album without being fired. Its recording was documented in &quot;Rusted Pieces&quot;, a home video released in 1991 with six music videos and an interview with the band.

Released in September 1990, &quot;Rust in Peace&quot; debuted at number 23 in the United States and number eight in the United Kingdom. Mustaine had developed a writing style with a rhythmically complex, progressive edge, and the songs featured longer guitar solos and frequent tempo changes. Described as a genre-defining work by &quot;Decibel&quot;, the album solidified Megadeth&#x27;s reputation in the music industry. It features the singles &quot;Holy Wars... The Punishment Due&quot; and &quot;Hangar 18&quot;, both of which were accompanied by music videos and became live staples. &quot;Rust in Peace&quot; received a Grammy nomination in 1991 for Best Metal Performance, and was the group&#x27;s third platinum album, certified in December 1994.

Early in 1990, Megadeth joined Slayer, Testament and Suicidal Tendencies for the successful European Clash of the Titans tour, featuring several American thrash metal bands. An American leg began the following year featuring Megadeth, Slayer and Anthrax, with Alice in Chains as a supporting act. The tour was considered a multi-headliner, as the three main bands alternated time slots. In addition to the Clash of the Titans tour, Megadeth (along with Testament) supported Judas Priest on their &quot;Painkiller&quot; tour in North America late in 1990 and appeared at the second Rock in Rio festival in January 1991. In July 1991 the song &quot;Go to Hell&quot; was featured in the film &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&#x27;s Bogus Journey&quot; and on its soundtrack.

===1992–1993: &quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot;===
The music for Megadeth&#x27;s fifth studio album was written in two different sessions. The first session occurred after the conclusion of the Clash of the Titans tour, while the second session happened in the fall of 1991 following a one-month break. Recording sessions for the album began in January 1992 at Enterprise Studios in Burbank, California. Max Norman was chosen to produce, as the band was pleased with his mixing of &quot;Rust in Peace&quot;. Megadeth spent nearly four months in the studio with Norman, writing and recording what became the band&#x27;s most commercially successful album, &quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot;. The album, whose title was suggested by Menza, features songwriting contributions from each band member. Ellefson explained that the band changed its approach to songwriting for this album, beginning to write more melodic songs.
Released in July 1992, &quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot; entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart at number two and was certified double platinum in the United States. It received a nomination for Best Metal Performance at the 1993 Grammy Awards, and its title track won a Genesis Award from the Humane Society in 1993 for raising awareness for animal rights issues. Ellefson later said that he and Friedman were disappointed that Megadeth did not win the Grammy: &quot;It was such a bizarre moment, because it was as if the amount of work it had taken to ramp up to that hopeful night was literally gone in a second.&quot;

A world tour in support of the album was launched in late 1992, with Pantera and White Zombie as supporting acts. The tour included a North American leg in early 1993, with Stone Temple Pilots as the opening act. One month into the leg, the remaining shows, including dates in Japan, were canceled when Mustaine returned to substance abuse, ending up in a hospital emergency room. After seven weeks in rehab, Mustaine emerged sober again and the band returned to the studio to record &quot;Angry Again&quot;. The song is featured on the soundtrack of the 1993 film &quot;Last Action Hero&quot; and received a Grammy nomination in 1994.

During mid-1993, Megadeth performed at a number of shows with Metallica in Europe. The first was at Milton Keynes Bowl in England, and included Diamond Head. In July, Megadeth was added as the opening act for Aerosmith&#x27;s Get a Grip Tour, but was removed from the bill after three shows. Aerosmith said that Megadeth was &quot;dumped&quot; because of Mustaine&#x27;s erratic behavior, while Capitol Records said it was due to &quot;artistic restrictions&quot;. After the canceled US tour, Megadeth returned to the studio to record &quot;99 Ways to Die&quot;, which appeared on &quot;The Beavis and Butt-Head Experience&quot;, a compilation album released in November featuring songs interspersed with commentary by the main characters of the animated series &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;. The song was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the 1995 Grammy Awards. During these sessions, Megadeth recorded a cover version of Black Sabbath&#x27;s &quot;Paranoid&quot;, which appeared on the Black Sabbath tribute album &quot;Nativity in Black&quot;; it was nominated for a Grammy the following year.

===1994–1995: &quot;Youthanasia&quot;===
In early 1994, Megadeth reunited with producer Max Norman for the follow-up to &quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot;. With three band members living in Arizona, initial work began at Phase Four Studios in Phoenix. A few days into pre-production, problems with Phase Four&#x27;s equipment forced the band to look for another studio. Mustaine insisted on recording in Arizona, but no suitable recording facility could be found. At Norman&#x27;s request, the band built its own recording studio in Phoenix in a rented warehouse, later called &quot;Fat Planet in Hangar 18&quot;. During the studio&#x27;s construction, much of the pre-production songwriting and arrangements were done at Vintage Recorders in Phoenix. At Norman&#x27;s suggestion, the tracks on &quot;Youthanasia&quot; had a slower tempo than previous albums, at about 120 beats per minute. The band abandoned the progressive approach from its previous albums and focused on stronger vocal melodies and more accessible, radio-friendly arrangements. For the first time, Megadeth wrote and arranged the entire album in the studio, including basic tracks recorded live by the entire band. The album&#x27;s recording was video recorded and released as &quot;Evolver: The Making of Youthanasia&quot; in 1995.

After eight months of studio work, &quot;Youthanasia&quot; was released in November 1994. It debuted at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and charted in several European countries. The album was certified gold in Canada the day it was released, and was certified platinum in the US two months later. Megadeth hired fashion photographer Richard Avedon to enhance the band&#x27;s image. Avedon had the band members exchange their jeans and T-shirts for a more conscious appearance. To promote &quot;Youthanasia&quot;, the band played a Halloween show in New York City called &quot;Night of the Living Megadeth&quot;, which was broadcast live on MTV. In November, the band performed twice on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, playing &quot;Train of Consequences&quot; on the first appearance and &quot;A Tout le Monde&quot; on the second.

An eleven-month tour began in South America in November 1994. In 1995, Megadeth played in Europe and North America with several opening acts, including Corrosion of Conformity, Korn and Fear Factory. The tour culminated with an appearance at the Monsters of Rock festival in Brazil, co-headlining with Alice Cooper and Ozzy Osbourne. In January 1995, Megadeth appeared on the soundtrack of the horror movie &quot;Demon Knight&quot; with the song &quot;Diadems&quot;. In July, Megadeth released &quot;Hidden Treasures&quot;, an extended play featuring songs which originally appeared on movie soundtracks and tribute albums.

=== 1996–1999: &quot;Cryptic Writings&quot; and &quot;Risk&quot; ===
After completing the extensive world tour in support of &quot;Youthanasia&quot;, Megadeth took time off in most of 1996 and nearly broke up. During this period, Mustaine began work on MD.45, a side project with vocalist Lee Ving of Fear. The majority of the songs on the album were intended for Megadeth, but due to the band almost disbanding, Mustaine decided to use them for MD.45 instead. The duo hired drummer Jimmy DeGrasso, who had played with Alice Cooper on the South American Monsters of Rock tour earlier that year. Marty Friedman built a studio in his new home in Phoenix and completed his fourth solo album, released in April 1996.

In September 1996, Megadeth went to London to work on songs for the next album. The songwriting was closely supervised by new manager Bud Prager, who contributed musical ideas and lyrics; many lyrics and song titles were changed at his request. Regarding Prager&#x27;s influence, Mustaine later wrote: &quot;I figured maybe this guy [Prager] could help me get that intangible number one record I so badly wanted.&quot; The album, recorded in Nashville, was Megadeth&#x27;s first collaboration with country pop producer Dann Huff, who had met Mustaine in 1990.

&quot;Cryptic Writings&quot; was released in June 1997. The album peaked at number ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and was eventually certified gold in the United States. Its lead single, &quot;Trust&quot;, became Megadeth&#x27;s highest charting song on the Mainstream Rock Tracks at number five, and was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the 1998 Grammy Awards. Although all four singles from the album entered the top 20 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, press response to the album was mixed. The album featured a diverse set of songs which the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described as a &quot;rousing balance&quot; between older material and experimental songs. Asked about the album&#x27;s eclecticism, Mustaine said that &quot;Cryptic Writings&quot; was divided into thirds. One part was based around faster, more aggressive material, another was &quot;radio-orientated music like &quot;Youthanasia&quot;&quot;, and the final third was more melodic.

After more than a year since the band&#x27;s last concert, Megadeth returned as a live act in June 1997, beginning a world tour with the Misfits and touring in the United States with Life of Agony and Coal Chamber. In July, the band participated in Ozzfest &#x27;98 but, halfway through the tour, Menza reportedly discovered a tumor on his knee and left to undergo surgery. Jimmy DeGrasso, who had collaborated with Mustaine in MD.45, was hired to replace Menza for the remainder of the tour. Though initially meant to be a temporary replacement, DeGrasso joined the band permanently after the tour. Mustaine later said that he dismissed Menza from the band because he believed the drummer had lied about having cancer.

Following the band&#x27;s mainstream radio success with &quot;Cryptic Writings&quot;, Megadeth again worked with Dann Huff on its eighth studio album. The band began writing in January 1999, supervised by manager Bud Prager, who was credited with co-writing five of the album&#x27;s twelve songs. With high expectations following the chart success of &quot;Trust&quot;, Prager convinced Mustaine to grant Huff even more control over the album&#x27;s recording, a decision Mustaine later regretted.

&quot;Risk&quot;, released in August 1999, was a critical and commercial failure and led to backlash from many longtime fans. Although its two predecessors incorporated rock elements alongside a more traditional heavy metal sound, &quot;Risk&quot; was virtually devoid of metal. About the band&#x27;s musical direction, Dave Mustaine said: &quot;We hit the nadir of our career with &quot;Risk&quot;, and I vowed after that we were going to get back to our roots. It took a little bit of time to do that.&quot; Despite this, &quot;Risk&quot; was certified gold in the United States. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Crush &#x27;Em&quot;, appeared on the soundtrack for &quot;Universal Soldier: The Return&quot; and was used as an entrance theme for NHL hockey games and professional wrestling events.
On July 14, 1999, former drummer Gar Samuelson died of liver failure at age 41 in Orange City, Florida. Eleven days later, during Megadeth&#x27;s performance at Woodstock 1999, Mustaine dedicated &quot;Peace Sells&quot; to Samuelson&#x27;s memory. That month, Megadeth also recorded a cover version of the Black Sabbath&#x27;s &quot;Never Say Die&quot; for the second Nativity in Black tribute album. The band began a world tour in support of &quot;Risk&quot; in September, playing with Iron Maiden during the European leg. Three months into the tour, Friedman announced his resignation from Megadeth, citing musical differences. Mustaine later said: &quot;I told [Marty] after &quot;Risk&quot; that we had to go back to our roots and play metal, and he quit.&quot;

===2000–2002: &quot;The World Needs a Hero&quot;, breakup, and hiatus===
In January 2000, guitarist Al Pitrelli, formerly of Savatage and the Trans-Siberian Orchestra, became Friedman&#x27;s replacement. Megadeth returned to the studio in April to work on its ninth studio album. A month into production, the band received an offer to join the Maximum Rock tour with Anthrax and Mötley Crüe. Megadeth put the recording on hold and toured North America during the second quarter of 2000. Early in the tour, Anthrax was removed from the bill, allowing Megadeth to play an extended co-headlining set. The tour, however, suffered from poor ticket sales.

After 15 years with Capitol Records, Megadeth left the label in July 2000. According to Mustaine, the departure was due to ongoing tensions with Capitol management. Capitol returned the band&#x27;s newest recordings and released a greatest hits album, &quot;Capitol Punishment: The Megadeth Years&quot;, with two new tracks: &quot;Kill the King&quot; and &quot;Dread and the Fugitive Mind&quot;. In November, Megadeth signed with Sanctuary Records. The band returned to the studio in October to finish its next album, &quot;The World Needs a Hero&quot;, which was near completion when Megadeth joined the Maximum Rock tour six months earlier. Following the negative response to &quot;Risk&quot;, Mustaine fired Bud Prager and produced the album himself. The songs were written by Mustaine alone, except for &quot;Promises&quot;, which had contributions from Pitrelli. Two days before the release of &quot;The World Needs a Hero&quot;, Megadeth appeared in an episode of VH1&#x27;s &quot;Behind the Music&quot; showcasing Mustaine, Ellefson, several past members, and Mustaine&#x27;s old Metallica bandmates James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich.

&quot;The World Needs a Hero&quot; was released in May 2001 and debuted at number sixteen on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It was banned in Malaysia when the national government determined that the album&#x27;s artwork was &quot;unsuitable for the nation&#x27;s youth&quot;. Consequently, the band canceled its concert of August 2 in Kuala Lumpur. The album marked Megadeth&#x27;s return to a more aggressive sound after the stylistic variations of its previous two albums, but critics felt it fell short of expectations. Mustaine compared the album to a huge ship at sea, turning and trying to right itself to get back on course. Its lead single, &quot;Moto Psycho&quot;, reached number 22 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart.
A European tour with AC/DC in support of &quot;The World Needs a Hero&quot; began in mid-2001, followed by an American tour with Iced Earth and Endo in September. Mustaine allowed fans to choose the setlist in each American city. However, the tour was cut short following the September 11 attacks; all dates were canceled, including a DVD shoot in Argentina. The band instead played two shows in Arizona on November 16 and 17, which were filmed and released as Megadeth&#x27;s first live release, &quot;Rude Awakening&quot;. That year, &quot;Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!&quot; was remixed and remastered; the reissue featured modified artwork and several bonus tracks.

In January 2002, Mustaine was hospitalized for the removal of a kidney stone and was administered pain medication that triggered a relapse of his drug addiction. Following his stay, Mustaine checked himself into a treatment center in Texas. While there, Mustaine fell asleep with his left arm over the back of a chair, causing compression of the radial nerve. He was subsequently diagnosed with radial neuropathy, which left him unable to grasp or make a fist with his left hand.

On April 3, Mustaine announced in a press release that he was disbanding Megadeth, as his arm injury rendered him unable to play guitar. For the next four months, he had physical therapy five days a week, and slowly began to &quot;re-teach&quot; his left hand. To fulfill contract obligations to Sanctuary, Megadeth released the compilation album &quot;Still Alive... and Well?&quot;. The first half of the album contains live tracks recorded at the Web Theatre in Phoenix, and the second half has studio recordings from &quot;The World Needs a Hero&quot;.

Following nearly a year of recovery, including physical therapy, Mustaine began work on what was to have been his first solo album. The recording sessions for the new material, with session musicians Vinnie Colaiuta and Jimmie Lee Sloas, began in October 2003 and were completed in April 2004. The project was put on hold when Mustaine agreed to remix and remaster Megadeth&#x27;s eight-album back catalog on Capitol Records, re-recording portions that were missing.

===2004–2005: Reformation and &quot;The System Has Failed&quot;===
In May 2004, Mustaine returned to his solo project. Contractual obligations to the band&#x27;s European label, EMI, resulted in the recording&#x27;s release as a Megadeth album. Mustaine reformed the band and contacted the fan-favorite &quot;Rust in Peace&quot; lineup to re-record backing tracks. While drummer Nick Menza agreed to return, both Marty Friedman and David Ellefson were unable to come to an agreement with Mustaine. Menza was sent home shortly after rehearsals began, a few days before the start of a tour supporting Megadeth&#x27;s upcoming album. Mustaine said Menza was insufficiently prepared for the physical demands of a US tour, and &quot;it just didn&#x27;t work out&quot;. This was the first album without Ellefson. Chris Poland, who played lead guitar on Megadeth&#x27;s first two albums, was hired to contribute guitar solos to the new album, working with Mustaine for the first time since the 1990s. Poland opted to serve only as a session musician, wanting to remain focused on his jazz fusion project OHM.
&quot;The System Has Failed&quot; was released in September 2004. Critics heralded it as a return to form; &quot;Revolver&quot; gave the album a favorable review, calling it &quot;Megadeth&#x27;s most vengeful, poignant and musically complex offering since 1992&#x27;s &quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot;&quot;. The album marked a shift toward the band&#x27;s earlier sound; journalist Amy Sciarretto of &quot;CMJ New Music Report&quot; wrote that the album contained &quot;neo-thrash riffing with biting, politically charged lyrics&quot;. &quot;The System Has Failed&quot; debuted at number eighteen on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was led by &quot;Die Dead Enough&quot;, which reached number 21 on the US Mainstream Rock chart. Mustaine announced that the album would be the band&#x27;s last and would be followed by a farewell tour, after which he would focus on a solo career.

Megadeth began the Blackmail the Universe world tour in October, enlisting touring bassist James MacDonough of Iced Earth and guitarist Glen Drover of Eidolon and King Diamond. Five days before the first show, Menza was replaced by Shawn Drover, who remained with the band as a regular member. The band toured the US with Exodus and Europe with Diamond Head and Dungeon. In June 2005, Capitol released a greatest-hits compilation, &quot;Greatest Hits: Back to the Start&quot;, featuring remixed and remastered versions of songs chosen by fans from Megadeth&#x27;s Capitol albums.

In mid-2005, Mustaine organized an annual thrash metal festival tour, Gigantour. Megadeth headlined the inaugural tour with acts such as Dream Theater, Nevermore, Anthrax and Fear Factory. Performances at the Montreal and Vancouver shows were filmed and recorded for a live DVD-and-CD set released in the second quarter of 2006. On October 9, following the successes of &quot;The System Has Failed&quot; and the Blackmail the Universe world tour, Mustaine announced to a sold-out crowd at the Pepsi Music Rock Festival in Argentina that Megadeth would continue to record and tour. The concert, held at Obras Sanitarias stadium in Buenos Aires in front of 25,000 fans, was filmed and released on DVD as &quot;That One Night: Live in Buenos Aires&quot; in 2007.

===2006–2008: &quot;United Abominations&quot;===
In February 2006, bassist James MacDonough left the band over &quot;personal differences&quot;. He was replaced by James LoMenzo, who had worked with David Lee Roth, White Lion and Black Label Society. The new Megadeth lineup made its live debut headlining the Dubai Desert Rock Festival in the United Arab Emirates with Testament. In March, Capitol released a two-disc DVD, &quot;Arsenal of Megadeth&quot;, which included archive footage, interviews, live shows, and many of the band&#x27;s music videos. Due to licensing issues, soundtrack and non-Capitol videos were not included. The second Gigantour began during the third quarter of 2006; Megadeth again headlined, this time with Lamb of God, Opeth, Arch Enemy and Overkill. The 2006 tour included three dates in Australia, supported by Soulfly, Arch Enemy and Caliban.

In May 2006, Megadeth announced that its eleventh studio album, &quot;United Abominations&quot;, was near completion. Originally scheduled for release in October, Mustaine said that the band was &quot;putting the finishing touches on it&quot; and postponed its release to May of the following year. He commented on the release: &quot;Metal needs a really good old-school record again. I believe I have delivered.&quot; &quot;United Abominations&quot; was the band&#x27;s first album to feature Glen Drover, Shawn Drover and James LoMenzo. It also has a newer version of &quot;A Tout le Monde&quot; entitled &quot;À Tout le Monde (Set Me Free)&quot;. The 2007 version is a duet with Cristina Scabbia of Lacuna Coil; it was recorded at a slightly faster tempo than the original and contains an extended solo.

Released in May 2007, &quot;United Abominations&quot; debuted at number eight on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 54,000 copies in the first week. In March, Megadeth began a North American tour opening for the newly reformed Heaven &amp; Hell. The band played with Down for Canadian shows and with Machine Head for the US dates. A European summer festival tour followed. Late in the year, Megadeth returned to the United States to headline its Tour of Duty. In November, the band brought Gigantour to Australia with a lineup including Static-X, DevilDriver and Lacuna Coil.
In January 2008, Glen Drover quit Megadeth, stating that he was tired of the frequent touring and wanted to spend more time with his family. He also cited personal issues with other band members. Drover was replaced by Chris Broderick, formerly of Nevermore and Jag Panzer. Broderick was initially asked by Mustaine&#x27;s management company at the end of 2007 if he would be interested in auditioning for Megadeth. After an informal meeting at Mustaine&#x27;s house, Broderick was introduced as the band&#x27;s new guitarist. Mustaine complimented Broderick&#x27;s playing skills and called him &quot;the best guitarist Megadeth has ever had&quot;. Broderick&#x27;s former Nevermore bandmate, Van Williams, congratulated Megadeth on &quot;getting one hell of a good player, more importantly they&#x27;re getting a great guy to hang out with and a true friend&quot;.

The new lineup made its live debut at the Helsinki Ice Hall on February 4. The 2008 Gigantour, with 29 North American dates, began shortly afterwards. Mustaine wanted a shorter lineup, allowing each band a chance to perform well. The third tour featured In Flames, Children of Bodom, Job for a Cowboy and High on Fire. Megadeth continued the Tour of Duty in South America and Mexico in May and June. A compilation album, &quot;&quot;, was released in September 2008.

===2009–2010: &quot;Endgame&quot; and Ellefson&#x27;s return===
In February 2009, Megadeth and Testament were scheduled on the European &quot;Priest Feast&quot; tour, with Judas Priest as headliners. At this time, Metallica, who had been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, invited Mustaine to attend the ceremony. Mustaine was informed that he would not be inducted to the Hall of Fame because such honors were granted only to those members who received recording credit on a Metallica album. Mustaine congratulated the group respectfully, and honored his commitment to the European tour with Judas Priest. In April, Megadeth and Slayer co-headlined the Canadian Carnage. This was the first time they had performed together in more than 15 years. Machine Head and Suicide Silence opened for the four shows that occurred later in June.

In May, Megadeth finished recording its twelfth album, &quot;Endgame&quot;. The release date for &quot;Endgame&quot; was announced on the Megadeth official website, and &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; was the first to review the album track-by-track. Megadeth began its Endgame tour in October, and finished it in December. The tour featured a number of supporting acts, including Machine Head, Suicide Silence, and Warbringer. In January 2010, Megadeth was set to embark on the American Carnage tour with Slayer and Testament, but the tour was postponed due to Tom Araya&#x27;s back surgery. Several weeks later, Megadeth&#x27;s &quot;Head Crusher&quot; was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the 2010 Grammy Awards, the band&#x27;s eighth Grammy nomination in 19 years.
In March, Megadeth embarked on the Rust in Peace 20th Anniversary Tour, which took place in North America and had support from Testament and Exodus. During the tour, Megadeth played &quot;Rust in Peace&quot; in its entirety. Prior to the start of the tour, original bassist David Ellefson rejoined Megadeth after eight years. In an interview for &quot;Classic Rock&quot;, he stated that Shawn Drover contacted him, informing him that bassist LoMenzo was leaving the band, saying &quot;if ever there was a time for you and Dave [Mustaine] to talk, now is it&quot;.

Megadeth, along with Metallica, Slayer, and Anthrax, collectively known as the &quot;big four&quot; of thrash metal, agreed to perform on the same bill during mid-2010. These performances were part of the Sonisphere Festival and were held in a number of European countries. One such performance in Sofia, Bulgaria, was filmed and released as a full-length video entitled &quot;The Big Four: Live from Sofia, Bulgaria&quot;. These shows continued the following year in the United States. The first took place in Indio, California, and was the only scheduled show in the United States at the time, although a second American production was held at Yankee Stadium in New York City shortly afterwards.

In July 2010, after the European &quot;big four&quot; shows, Megadeth and Slayer commenced the first leg of the American Carnage Tour, where Megadeth played &quot;Rust in Peace&quot; in its entirety, while Slayer performed its album &quot;Seasons in the Abyss&quot;, both of which were released in 1990. From these shows onward, Vic Rattlehead started making sustained onstage appearances, to improve the visual facet of Megadeth&#x27;s live performances. Shortly afterward, the two bands united with Anthrax for the Jägermeister Music Tour in late 2010. During the final show of the tour, Kerry King joined Megadeth on stage at the Gibson Amphitheatre in Hollywood to perform Megadeth&#x27;s &quot;Rattlehead&quot;. It was the first time that King had performed onstage with Megadeth since 1984. Megadeth and Slayer again shared the stage for the European Carnage Tour in March and April 2011. Megadeth also headlined the fourth annual Rockstar Mayhem Festival in July and August the same year.

In September, the band released the DVD album &quot;Rust in Peace Live&quot;, recorded at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles. Later that month, Megadeth released &quot;Sudden Death&quot; for the video game &quot;Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock&quot;. The song was commissioned by the publishers of the Guitar Hero franchise, who wanted the track to feature dark lyrics and multiple guitar solos. It was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the 2011 Grammy ceremony.

===2011–2014: &quot;Thirteen&quot; and &quot;Super Collider&quot;===
Megadeth returned to its own Vic&#x27;s Garage studio in 2011 to record its thirteenth album, to be produced by Johnny K, because Andy Sneap, the producer of Megadeth&#x27;s previous two albums, was unavailable. The album was titled &quot;Thirteen&quot; and featured previously released tracks such as &quot;Sudden Death&quot; and &quot;Never Dead&quot;. The album was released in November 2011, and charted at number eleven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200; its lead single &quot;Public Enemy No. 1&quot; received a Grammy nomination for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance, but did not win. Shortly after the album was released, Dave Mustaine stated that, after a four-year hiatus, there would be a new Gigantour tour in early 2012. The lineup consisted of Motörhead, Volbeat, and Lacuna Coil alongside Megadeth. After the conclusion of Gigantour, Rob Zombie and Megadeth embarked on a nine-date co-headlining US tour in the summer of 2012.

In September 2012, it was announced that Megadeth would re-release &quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot; in honor of the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary. To mark the occasion, Megadeth launched a tour in which the band performed the album live in its entirety. One performance, filmed at the Pomona Fox Theater, was released as a live album, &quot;Countdown to Extinction: Live,&quot; the following year. Another track from &quot;Thirteen&quot;, &quot;Whose Life (Is It Anyways?)&quot;, was nominated for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance at the 2013 Grammy Awards, but lost to Halestorm&#x27;s &quot;Love Bites (So Do I)&quot;.
In August, Megadeth announced the recording of its fourteenth album with producer Johnny K. At the start of 2013, Megadeth left Roadrunner Records for Mustaine&#x27;s newly founded label, Tradecraft, distributed through Universal Music Group. The album, &quot;Super Collider&quot;, was released in June and debuted at number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, the band&#x27;s highest chart position since 1994&#x27;s &quot;Youthanasia&quot;. Critical reaction to the album, however, was largely negative, with criticism directed towards the album&#x27;s deviation from the band&#x27;s traditional metal sound. Shortly after the release of &quot;Super Collider&quot;, Mustaine stated that he had already started thinking about a fifteenth Megadeth album. He said this had been spurred by the death of Slayer guitarist Jeff Hanneman, which gave him a sense of mortality. Mustaine elaborated: &quot;You know, time is short. Nobody knows how long they&#x27;re gonna live. You see what happened with Jeff Hanneman, so I wanna write as much as I can while I can.&quot;

The 2013 edition of Gigantour featured Black Label Society, Hellyeah, Device, and Newsted as opening bands. At the final show, Jason Newsted, Metallica&#x27;s former bassist, joined Megadeth onstage to perform &quot;Phantom Lord&quot;, a song Mustaine had co-written during his stint with Metallica. Early in 2014, Megadeth was slated to play the Soundwave festival in Australia, but pulled out over a disagreement with tour promoter A. J. Maddah concerning the band&#x27;s sideshows with Newsted. &quot;Icon&quot;, an eleven-song compilation of Megadeth&#x27;s Capitol-era material, was released as part of Universal Music&#x27;s Icon series in February.

Megadeth encountered several setbacks throughout 2014. After Ellefson&#x27;s brother died of cancer in May, the band cancelled its June tour dates to allow him to mourn. A planned August concert in Tel Aviv was canceled due to an armed conflict between Israel and Gaza. Megadeth was scheduled to appear on Motörhead&#x27;s Motörboat cruise in late September, but withdrew because of Mustaine&#x27;s complications following his cervical spine surgery. In October, Mustaine&#x27;s mother-in-law, who suffered from Alzheimer&#x27;s, went missing from a campground; her remains were discovered in late November. That same month, Drover quit the band after ten years, wanting to pursue his own musical interests, but has said he is grateful for the career Mustaine gave him. This was quickly followed by the departure of Broderick, due to artistic and musical differences. Ellefson denied rumors that Megadeth would disband, and said he and Mustaine would continue working on new music. Mustaine later said one of the reasons for Broderick and Drover leaving was their frustration over Megadeth&#x27;s fan base demanding a reunion with Friedman and Menza.

===2015–2018: &quot;Dystopia&quot;===

Lamb of God drummer Chris Adler and guitarist Kiko Loureiro of Angra were brought in to perform on Megadeth&#x27;s fifteenth studio album after Mustaine unsuccessfully attempted to reunite the &quot;Rust in Peace&quot; lineup. In October 2015, Megadeth streamed &quot;Fatal Illusion&quot; off the album &quot;Dystopia&quot;, which was released in January 2016. In support of &quot;Dystopia&quot;, Megadeth embarked on a North American tour in February and March with Suicidal Tendencies, Children of Bodom and Havok (though Havok was soon removed from the tour by Megadeth&#x27;s management following a dispute over a contract). Mustaine announced that Adler, who was performing with both Lamb of God and Megadeth, was no longer in the band due to scheduling conflicts between the two bands. He was replaced by Dirk Verbeuren from Soilwork, on Adler&#x27;s recommendation. A second US tour took place in September and October, with support from Amon Amarth, Suicidal Tendencies, Metal Church, and Butcher Babies. Former drummer Menza died of a heart attack on May 21, 2016, while performing with OHM at a jazz club in Los Angeles.

Asked about any further Big Four gigs, Mustaine called for &quot;the powers-that-be&quot; to help put together a new Big Four tour in 2017 as all the respective bands were promoting new albums. &quot;Dystopia&quot;&#x27;s title track won the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance at the 2017 Grammy Awards, the band&#x27;s first win after 12 nominations. Mustaine, Loureiro, Ellefson, and Verbeuren attended the ceremony; however, album drummer and award recipient Chris Adler did not. While accepting the award, the house band played Mustaine&#x27;s former band Metallica&#x27;s &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; causing some controversy among fans.

In a June 2017 interview with No Brown M&amp;Ms, Mustaine said that Megadeth would enter the studio at the end of the year to begin working on their sixteenth studio album. A month later, Mustaine stated on Twitter that he had begun &quot;collecting ideas&quot; for the new album, but stated that they would &quot;probably&quot; enter the studio in mid-2018 to begin recording it for a 2019 release. The band joined with Scorpions for a co-headlining tour in the fall of 2017.

In 2018, Megadeth marked their 35th anniversary by re-releasing their 1985 debut album &quot;Killing Is My Business... And Business Is Good!&quot;, dubbed &quot;Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! - The Final Kill&quot; on June 8, 2018, as a deluxe package containing remastered versions of all songs to Mustaine&#x27;s intended vision, a re-cut version of &quot;These Boots&quot; lyrically adjusted to Lee Hazlewood&#x27;s version, rare live performances of songs off the album during Alice Cooper&#x27;s Live in the Flesh Tour and the 1984 three song demo.

===2019–2023: Ellefson&#x27;s second departure and &quot;The Sick, the Dying... and the Dead!&quot;===
On May 10, 2019, Megadeth entered the studio in Franklin, Tennessee, to begin pre-production of the next album, once again teaming up with &quot;Dystopia&quot; co-producer Chris Rakestraw. On June 17, the band announced that all shows scheduled in 2019 (with the exception of the MegaCruise) would be cancelled due to Mustaine being diagnosed with throat cancer; of all the cancelled dates, the band was scheduled to support Ozzy Osbourne on the North American leg of the No More Tours II tour, which had been postponed from the summer of 2019 to the summer of 2020 due to Osbourne sustaining an injury while dealing with pneumonia. They were replaced by Marilyn Manson instead. Despite Mustaine&#x27;s illness, the band vowed to continue working on their new album. On November 6, Mustaine shared a video on Instagram teasing a track from the band&#x27;s upcoming album, which was originally set for release in 2019. On July 17, Megadeth announced their partnership with Gimme Radio and Richard Childress Racing on the No. 2 Gimme Radio Chevrolet Camaro, which was driven by Xfinity Series driver Tyler Reddick at the New Hampshire 200 on July 20. On August 21, the band announced that they would embark on their first tour since Mustaine&#x27;s illness in January and February 2020, with Five Finger Death Punch and Bad Wolves supporting on the European tour.

The band was originally scheduled to perform on the first-ever MegaCruise to coincide with the release of the next album, due to sail on October 13, 2019, from Los Angeles and hit ports of San Diego and Ensenada before returning on October 18, including performances by heavy metal acts such as Lamb of God, Anthrax, Testament, Overkill, Corrosion of Conformity, Queensrÿche, Armored Saint, Metal Church, Suicidal Tendencies, DragonForce, Doro, John 5, Death Angel and Toothgrinder, however, Mustaine was not present due to his illness. It was instead a live performance featuring members of each respective band playing Kiss songs.
Megadeth was originally scheduled to embark on a co-headlining tour in North America with Lamb of God dubbed &quot;The Metal Tour of the Year&quot; in the summer of 2020, with Trivium and In Flames as support acts, but was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The tour was rescheduled for the summer of 2021, with Hatebreed replacing In Flames due to the latter being forced to withdraw from the line-up due to international visa issues caused by the pandemic. Megadeth re-entered the studio in Nashville in mid-2020 to resume recording their new album, tentatively planned for release in 2021. While hosting a Masterclass &quot;Front Row Live&quot; for fans via Zoom on January 9, 2021, Mustaine announced the title of the band&#x27;s sixteenth album would be called &quot;The Sick, the Dying... and the Dead!&quot;, however he indicated that the title might be subject to change.

In May 2021, sexually explicit videos of Ellefson were leaked to social media. The videos, reportedly recorded by a 19-year-old fan who was in correspondence with Ellefson, led to initial accusations of child grooming. Ellefson and the fan denied these claims in separate statements and maintained their encounters were consensual. On May 24, Megadeth issued a statement announcing Ellefson&#x27;s dismissal from the band. Ellefson later confirmed that he had actually been dismissed ten days earlier on May 14; the videos originally surfaced on May 10. Following the controversy, Mustaine said there would be no chance for Ellefson to rejoin the band, while Ellefson said he would pursue legal action against the leaked videos.

On Mustaine&#x27;s Gimme Radio program &quot;The Dave Mustaine Show&quot; on June 17, he said that the bass tracks recorded by Ellefson in May 2020 would not appear on the upcoming album and would be re-recorded by a different bassist, which was completed a short time later, but did not say who it was. He also revealed a song title from the album called &quot;The Dogs of Chernobyl&quot;. Mustaine confirmed soon after that a new bassist was chosen with a picture showing the neck of the bass guitar and the unknown member being shown on the floor behind a chair, however, he did not reveal the name, but would announce it soon. Former bassist James LoMenzo filled in for the band&#x27;s upcoming tour with Lamb of God, while Steve Di Giorgio of Testament performed as a session bassist on &quot;The Sick, the Dying... and the Dead!&quot;, which was released in September 2022. LoMenzo was announced as the band&#x27;s official bassist in May 2022.

After several teasers, &quot;We&#x27;ll Be Back&quot;, the first single from the record, was released on June 23, along with the tracklist, followed by next singles &quot;Night Stalkers&quot; and &quot;Soldier On!&quot;, released on July 22 and August 12 respectively.

In November 2022, the band released a cover of a Judas Priest song titled &quot;Delivering The Goods&quot; from their 1978 album, &quot;Killing Machine.&quot;

On February 27, 2023, Megadeth was joined by former guitarist Marty Friedman where they performed three songs at the Budokan in Japan. This marked Friedman&#x27;s first performance with the band since 2000. On June 23, former drummer Lee Rausch died at the age of 58.

===2023–present: Kiko Loureiro&#x27;s departure and upcoming seventeenth studio album===
On September 6, 2023, it was announced that lead guitarist Kiko Loureiro would temporarily be leaving the North American portion of the tour and that he would be replaced by Teemu Mäntysaari. On November 20, 2023, Mäntysaari joined Megadeth as their lead guitarist, after Loureiro announced he would be extending his absence from the band. Loureiro said in a November 28, 2023, podcast interview that he was no longer in the band. Loureiro explained his departure in a January 2024 interview with &quot;Guitar World&quot;, saying: “I had two viable options: to be in Megadeth or not. I chose my personal life. No regrets”.

In a December 2023 interview on &quot;The SDR Show&quot;, Mustaine revealed his intention to release at least three more studio albums as Megadeth, with the first to be released in 2025: &quot;If it takes two years between an album — let&#x27;s just say it does, if I&#x27;m able to put them out fast — it&#x27;ll probably be three years, but let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s two years. And I put an album out. We&#x27;ve still got about a year left on this one, at least. So that&#x27;ll take us into &#x27;25.&quot;

==Controversies==
Mustaine has made numerous inflammatory statements in the press, usually regarding issues with former Metallica bandmates. The feud stemmed from his ejection from the band, how it was conducted, and disagreements on songwriting credits. Mustaine expressed his anger in the movie &quot;&quot;, in a scene he later disapproved of as he felt he was mischaracterized, and that it did not represent the full extent of what happened during the meeting.

During a live performance of &quot;Anarchy in the U.K.&quot; at a 1988 show in Antrim, Northern Ireland, Mustaine dedicated the song to &quot;the cause&quot; of &quot;giving Ireland back to the Irish!&quot; Before the final song, Mustaine said, &quot;This one&#x27;s for the cause! Give Ireland back to the Irish!&quot; This elicited a riot and fighting among the audience between Irish Nationalists, the majority of whom are Catholic, and the predominantly Protestant, British Unionists in attendance. The band had to travel in a bulletproof bus back to Dublin. This incident served as inspiration for the song &quot;Holy Wars... The Punishment Due&quot;.

Controversial or misinterpreted lyrics have caused complications for the band. In 1988, MTV deemed that the song &quot;In My Darkest Hour&quot; encouraged suicide and banned the video. The station banned the video for &quot;A Tout le Monde&quot; for the same reason, though Mustaine said the song was written from the perspective of a dying man saying his last words to his loved ones. According to him, MTV considered the videos for &quot;Skin o&#x27; My Teeth&quot; and &quot;Symphony of Destruction&quot; a &quot;little bit too harsh&quot; and refused to play them.

During a world tour in 2001, the Malaysian government canceled the band&#x27;s show in the nation&#x27;s capital because the authorities had a negative perception of the group&#x27;s image and music. The government deemed the band&#x27;s mascot, Vic Rattlehead, as inappropriate and told the members that they would be arrested if they performed. Dave Mustaine responded: &quot;I recognize what the Malaysian government is trying to do, and it is admirable of them trying to protect the young people in the country. But it just shows the degree of ignorance and apathy that the government has toward the problem.&quot;

In 2003, after recovering from an arm injury that threatened to end his career, Mustaine became a born-again Christian. Minor controversy was sparked by Mustaine&#x27;s announcement that Megadeth would not play certain songs live due to his conversion. In May 2005, Mustaine allegedly threatened to cancel shows in Greece and Israel with extreme metal bands Rotting Christ and Dissection due to the bands&#x27; anti-Christian beliefs. This caused the two bands to cancel appearances.
In July 2004, former bassist Ellefson sued Mustaine for $18.5 million in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Ellefson alleged that Mustaine short-changed him on profits including tour merchandise and publishing royalties. The suit was dismissed in 2005, and Mustaine filed a countersuit alleging that Ellefson had used the band&#x27;s name in an advertisement for musical equipment; the suit was settled out of court.

On May 10, 2021, sexually explicit videos of Ellefson were posted on Twitter. The videos, reportedly recorded by a fan that Ellefson was in correspondence with, initially led to accusations of child grooming. However, Ellefson and the other party both denied the accusations, and the fan publicly claimed they were a consenting adult and the videos were unknowingly released by a third party. The Scottsdale Police Department (SPD) was contacted by Ellefson, who sought charges for revenge porn. Ellefson took a polygraph test to affirm his claims and presented police with a photo of the fan&#x27;s driver&#x27;s license to prove their age. He also shared screen shots of Snapchat and WhatsApp messages related to the allegations. Ellefson&#x27;s partner admitted that she had shared the video with some friends but wasn&#x27;t sure how it got leaked out to others. The SPD report states the fan &quot;was remorseful and agreed to send out a social media statement on...Instagram&quot; that they were &quot;a willing consenting adult during their mutual virtual sexual encounter.&quot; Ellefson then posted her statement and one of his own on May 10, asserting that the allegations of grooming were false. Ellefson stated he has not been extorted in any way, and he believes the videos of their consensual adult encounter were not intentionally leaked. An official statement released the next day from Megadeth stated that the situation was being &quot;watched closely&quot;. Mustaine announced on May 24, 2021, that Ellefson was fired from the band.

==Artistry==
===Influences and style===
Traditional heavy metal bands such as UFO, Black Sabbath, Budgie, Judas Priest, new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) bands such as Raven, Motörhead, Iron Maiden, Diamond Head, and Venom, and punk rock bands such as the Sex Pistols and Ramones had a significant influence on Megadeth&#x27;s sound. Hard rock bands such as AC/DC, Queen, Led Zeppelin, and Rush, as well as German acts like Scorpions and Accept, were also influential on the group&#x27;s guitar style. Although the music has roots in punk, university professor Jason Bivins wrote that Megadeth followed the basic blueprint of Motörhead and Iron Maiden. He described the style as a mix of &quot;the instrumental virtuosity of the NWOBHM with the speed and aggression of hardcore punk&quot;, while also drawing lyrical inspiration from the horror-themed punk band Misfits. Mustaine has also listed albums by the Beatles and David Bowie as recordings that influenced him.

Mustaine is the band&#x27;s primary songwriter. He develops songs starting with a particular riff that, with modifications, becomes the central part of the song. He has said that song fragments are composed separately, and then the band makes a compact structure from them. Drummer Shawn Drover stated that Mustaine had saved many riffs over the years and that some recent material is based on those demo recordings. Ellefson stated that the band constantly creates new material, and that making a recording begins with exchanging ideas after which the band enters the studio and discusses the concept, direction, artwork, and song titles. The lyrics are usually written after the music is arranged. Discussing the band&#x27;s lyrics, Mustaine said that many of the themes are derived from literature, such as the novels of George Orwell.

The music of Megadeth and its underground metal contemporaries from the 1980s featured harsh vocals, double bass drum patterns, staccato riffing, power chords, tremolo picking, and screeching lead guitar work; albums from this period were produced on low budgets. After forming Megadeth, Mustaine followed the thrash metal style of his previous band, Metallica, with more emphasis on speed and intensity. When asked to describe Megadeth&#x27;s guitar style, Mustaine answered: &quot;When you go to a show and see a guitar player who just stands there, that&#x27;s a guitar player. A thrash guitar player is a guy who plays like he wants to beat the guitar&#x27;s guts out.&quot; Most of the songs are recorded in standard guitar tuning as Mustaine believes it to provide a superior melody to alternative methods of tuning.
In 2017, David Ellefson talked in an interview about how the band recently started to use a lower tuning saying: &quot;it&#x27;s just natural with age, for singers it can be a struggle, so rather than quit, than not play, how do you work it around? Well, let&#x27;s drop the guitars, let&#x27;s find a way to work around it.&quot;

During the band&#x27;s early days, Mustaine was the rhythm guitarist, while Chris Poland played lead. Poland performed only on Megadeth&#x27;s first two albums at the time of the book&#x27;s release; (he would go on to play on the 2004 album &quot;The System Has Failed&quot;); music journalists Pete Prown and Harvey P. Newquist credit him with making the music more colorful because of his jazz influences. According to former &quot;Metal Maniacs&quot; editor Jeff Wagner, the band&#x27;s songwriting techniques peaked with the fourth album, &quot;Rust in Peace&quot;, which he described as a &quot;flurry of precision and fluidity, making good on Megadeth&#x27;s claim to being the world&#x27;s state-of-the-art speed metal band&quot;. Musicologist Glenn Pillsbury stated the guitar work on the album was a mixture of Mustaine&#x27;s &quot;controlled chaos&quot; and the &quot;technical brilliance&quot; of Marty Friedman. Studio efforts released in the mid- and late 1990s featured songs with compact structures and less complicated riffing.

Megadeth&#x27;s lyrics often focus on death, war, politics, and religion. The lyricism centers on nihilistic themes, but occasionally deals with topics such as alienation and social problems. The earliest releases featured themes such as occultism, graphic violence, and Satanism. Nuclear warfare and government conspiracy were preoccupations on albums such as &quot;Rust in Peace&quot; and &quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot;. During Megadeth&#x27;s commercial peak, Mustaine elaborated on more personal themes such as addiction and intimate relationships. For the lyrics on &quot;Cryptic Writings&quot;, Mustaine said that he wanted to write songs that had more appeal to a wider audience. The title of &quot;United Abominations&quot; is a satiric play on the name of the United Nations; Mustaine criticized the organization&#x27;s ineffectiveness on a number of songs on that album.

===Legacy===
Having sold more than 50 million units worldwide, Megadeth is one of the few bands from the 1980s American underground metal scene to have achieved mass commercial success. Along with contemporaries Metallica, Slayer, and Anthrax, Megadeth is regarded as one of the core founding groups of thrash metal. These bands are often referred to as the &quot;big four&quot; of thrash metal, responsible for the genre&#x27;s development and popularization. &quot;Loudwire&quot; ranked Megadeth the third best thrash metal band of all time, praising the group&#x27;s &quot;provoking lyrics and mind-warping virtuosity&quot;. &quot;CMJ New Music Report&quot; called the band&#x27;s debut album a seminal release and a representative of &quot;the golden age of speed metal&quot;. Billboard called the band&#x27;s second album &quot;Peace Sells... but Who&#x27;s Buying?&quot; a &quot;landmark of the thrash movement&quot; whose lyrics it found still relevant. MTV also recognized the band as an influential metal act, highlighting the technical aspect of the early albums.

Megadeth is considered one of the most musically influential groups that originated in the 1980s. As part of the early American thrash metal movement, the band&#x27;s music was a direct influence on death metal. Sociologist Keith Kahn-Harris wrote that the mainstream success of Megadeth was one of the reasons for the expansion of extreme metal to countries where it had previously been unknown. The band had influenced many metal bands, including Sepultura, Pantera, Slipknot, Bullet for My Valentine, Trivium, Avenged Sevenfold, Arch Enemy, Children of Bodom, Lamb of God, As I Lay Dying, All That Remains, Evile and Toxic Holocaust.
According to Nielsen SoundScan, Megadeth has sold 9.2 million copies of its albums in the United States between 1991 and 2014.

<text>Blue Marlin and her sister ship compose the &quot;Marlin&quot; class of semisubmersible heavy-lift ships operated by Dockwise Shipping of the Netherlands. Designed to transport very large, semisubmersible drilling rigs above the transport ship&#x27;s deck, she is equipped with 38 cabins to accommodate 60 people, a workout room, sauna and swimming facilities, and a secure citadel for protection against pirate attacks.

== History ==
&quot;Blue Marlin&quot; and her sister ship were owned by Offshore Heavy Transport of Oslo, Norway, from their construction, in April 2000 and November 1999, respectively, until 6 July 2001, when they were purchased by Dockwise. The U.S. Navy hired &quot;Blue Marlin&quot; from Offshore Heavy Transport to move the destroyer back to the United States after the warship was damaged by Al-Qaeda suicide bombers while anchored in the port of Aden, Yemen. During the latter part of 2003, work done on &quot;Blue Marlin&quot; boosted her capacity and added two retractable propulsors to improve maneuverability. The ship re-entered service in January 2004. Following these improvements, &quot;Blue Marlin&quot; delivered the oil platform &quot;Thunder Horse PDQ&quot;, weighing 60,000 tons, to Corpus Christi, Texas, for completion.

In July 2005 &quot;Blue Marlin&quot; moved the gas refinery Snøhvit from its construction site in Cádiz to Hammerfest, an 11-day trip. This transport was filmed for the TV show &quot;Extreme Engineering&quot; on the Discovery Channel, and also the TV show &quot;Mega Movers&quot; on the History Channel.

In November 2005, &quot;Blue Marlin&quot; left Corpus Christi to move the massive sea-based X-band Radar to Adak, Alaska, via the southern tip of South America and Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. It arrived at Pearl Harbor on 9 January 2006, having travelled 15,000 miles. In January 2007, the &quot;Blue Marlin&quot; was employed to move two jackup rigs, the &quot;Rowan Gorilla VI&quot; and the GlobalSantaFe &quot;Galaxy II&quot;, from Halifax Harbour to the North Sea.

On 16 June 2012, the ship arrived in Ferrol Harbour in preparation for transporting the incomplete amphibious warship to Melbourne. The Australian ship was lifted onto &quot;Blue Marlin&quot; on 4 August 2012 and was scheduled to sail on 12 August, bound for Australia BAE Systems shipyard in Williamstown. The ship passed the Port Phillip Heads and arrived at Melbourne on 17 October 2012.

On 5 May 2019, &quot;Blue Marlin&quot; was briefly hijacked off the coast of Equatorial Guinea. The crew took shelter in the ship&#x27;s citadel, while pirates shot up the bridge in frustration. The pirates fled before the arrival of the Equatorial Guinean frigate and Spanish patrol boat .

<text>The Modified Mercalli intensity scale (MM, MMI, or MCS) measures the effects of an earthquake at a given location. This is in contrast with the seismic magnitude usually reported for an earthquake.

Magnitude scales measure the inherent force or strength of an earthquake – an event occurring at greater or lesser depth. (The &quot;&quot; scale is widely used.) The MM scale measures intensity of shaking, at any particular location, on the surface. It was developed from Giuseppe Mercalli&#x27;s Mercalli intensity scale of 1902.

While shaking experienced at the surface is caused by the seismic energy released by an earthquake, earthquakes differ in how much of their energy is radiated as seismic waves. They also differ in the depth at which they occur; deeper earthquakes have less interaction with the surface, their energy is spread throughout a larger volume, and the energy reaching the surface is spread across a larger area. Shaking intensity is localized. It generally diminishes with distance from the earthquake&#x27;s epicenter, but it can be amplified in sedimentary basins and in certain kinds of unconsolidated soils.

Intensity scales categorize intensity empirically, based on the effects reported by untrained observers, and are adapted for the effects that might be observed in a particular region. By not requiring instrumental measurements, they are useful for estimating the magnitude and location of historical (preinstrumental) earthquakes: the greatest intensities generally correspond to the epicentral area, and their degree and extent (possibly augmented by knowledge of local geological conditions) can be compared with other local earthquakes to estimate the magnitude.

==History==
Italian volcanologist Giuseppe Mercalli formulated his first intensity scale in 1883. It had six degrees or categories, has been described as &quot;merely an adaptation&quot; of the then-standard Rossi–Forel scale of 10 degrees, and is now &quot;more or less forgotten&quot;. Mercalli&#x27;s second scale, published in 1902, was also an adaptation of the Rossi–Forel scale, retaining the 10 degrees and expanding the descriptions of each degree. This version &quot;found favour with the users&quot;, and was adopted by the Italian Central Office of Meteorology and Geodynamics.

In 1904, Adolfo Cancani proposed adding two additional degrees for very strong earthquakes, &quot;catastrophe&quot; and &quot;enormous catastrophe&quot;, thus creating a 12-degree scale. His descriptions being deficient, August Heinrich Sieberg augmented them during 1912 and 1923, and indicated a peak ground acceleration for each degree. This became known as the &quot;Mercalli–Cancani scale, formulated by Sieberg&quot;, or the &quot;Mercalli–Cancani–Sieberg scale&quot;, or simply &quot;MCS&quot;, and was used extensively in Europe and remains in use in Italy by the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV).

When Harry O. Wood and Frank Neumann translated this into English in 1931 (along with modification and condensation of the descriptions, and removal of the acceleration criteria), they named it the &quot;modified Mercalli intensity scale of 1931&quot; (MM31). Some seismologists refer to this version the &quot;Wood–Neumann scale&quot;. Wood and Neumann also had an abridged version, with fewer criteria for assessing the degree of intensity.

The Wood–Neumann scale was revised in 1956 by Charles Francis Richter and published in his influential textbook &quot;Elementary Seismology&quot;. Not wanting to have this intensity scale confused with the Richter scale he had developed, he proposed calling it the &quot;modified Mercalli scale of 1956&quot; (MM56).

In their 1993 compendium of historical seismicity in the United States, Carl Stover and Jerry Coffman ignored Richter&#x27;s revision, and assigned intensities according to their slightly modified interpretation of Wood and Neumann&#x27;s 1931 scale, effectively creating a new, but largely undocumented version of the scale.

The basis by which the United States Geological Survey (and other agencies) assigns intensities is nominally Wood and Neumann&#x27;s MM31. However, this is generally interpreted with the modifications summarized by Stover and Coffman because in the decades since 1931, &quot;some criteria are more reliable than others as indicators of the level of ground shaking&quot;. Also, construction codes and methods have evolved, making much of built environment stronger; these make a given intensity of ground shaking seem weaker. Also, some of the original criteria of the most intense degrees (X and above), such as bent rails, ground fissures, landslides, etc., are &quot;related less to the level of ground shaking than to the presence of ground conditions susceptible to spectacular failure&quot;.

The categories &quot;catastrophe&quot; and &quot;enormous catastrophe&quot; added by Cancani (XI and XII) are used so infrequently that current USGS practice is to merge them into a single category &quot;Extreme&quot; abbreviated as &quot;X+&quot;.

==Scale values==
The lesser degrees of the MMI scale generally describe the manner in which the earthquake is felt by people. The greater numbers of the scale are based on observed structural damage.

This table gives MMIs that are typically observed at locations near the epicenter of the earthquake.

=== Correlation with magnitude ===
Magnitude and intensity, while related, are very different concepts. Magnitude is a function of the energy liberated by an earthquake, while intensity is the degree of shaking experienced at a point on the surface, and varies from some maximum intensity at or near the epicenter, out to zero at distance. It depends upon many factors, including the depth of the hypocenter, terrain, distance from the epicenter, whether the underlying strata there amplify surface shaking, and any directionality due to the earthquake mechanism. For example, a magnitude 7.0 quake in Salta, Argentina, in 2011, that was 576.8 km deep, had a maximum felt intensity of V, while a magnitude 2.2 event in Barrow in Furness, England, in 1865, about 1 km deep, had a maximum felt intensity of VIII.

The small table is a rough guide to the degrees of the MMI scale. The colors and descriptive names shown here differ from those used on certain shake maps in other articles.

=== Estimating site intensity and its use in seismic hazard assessment ===
Dozens of intensity-prediction equations have been published to estimate the macroseismic intensity at a location given the magnitude, source-to-site distance, and perhaps other parameters (e.g. local site conditions). These are similar to ground motion-prediction equations for the estimation of instrumental strong-motion parameters such as peak ground acceleration. A summary of intensity prediction equations is available. Such equations can be used to estimate the seismic hazard in terms of macroseismic intensity, which has the advantage of being related more closely to seismic risk than instrumental strong-motion parameters.

=== Correlation with physical quantities ===
The MMI scale is not defined in terms of more rigorous, objectively quantifiable measurements such as shake amplitude, shake frequency, peak velocity, or peak acceleration. Human-perceived shaking and building damage are best correlated with peak acceleration for lower-intensity events, and with peak velocity for higher-intensity events.

=== Comparison to the moment magnitude scale ===
The effects of any one earthquake can vary greatly from place to place, so many MMI values may be measured for the same earthquake. These values can be displayed best using a contoured map of equal intensity, known as an isoseismal map. However, each earthquake has only one magnitude.

<doc id="20664" wikidata="Q1070749" url="?curid=20664" title="The Mickey Mouse Club">
<text>The Mickey Mouse Club is an American variety television show that aired intermittently from 1955 to 1996 and briefly returned to social media in 2017. Created by Walt Disney and produced by Walt Disney Productions, the program was first televised for four seasons, from 1955 to 1959, by ABC. This original run featured a regular, but ever-changing cast of mostly teen performers. ABC broadcast reruns weekday afternoons during the 1958–1959 season, airing right after &quot;American Bandstand&quot;. The show was revived three times after its initial 1955–1959 run on ABC, first from 1977 to 1979 for first-run syndication as The New Mickey Mouse Club, then from 1989 to 1996 as The All-New Mickey Mouse Club (also known to fans as MMC from 1993 to 1996) airing on The Disney Channel, and again from 2017 to 2018 with the moniker Club Mickey Mouse airing on internet social media.

The character of Mickey Mouse appeared in every show, not only in vintage cartoons originally made for theatrical release, but also in the opening, interstitial, and closing segments made especially for the show. In both the vintage cartoons and new animated segments, Mickey was voiced by his creator Walt Disney (Disney had previously voiced the character theatrically from 1928 to 1947 before being replaced by sound effects artist Jimmy MacDonald).

==Before the TV series==
The first official theater-based Mickey Mouse Club began on December 21, 1929, at the Elsinore Theater in Salem, Oregon, with 60 theaters hosting clubs by March 31. The Club released its first issue of the &quot;Official Bulletin of the Mickey Mouse Club&quot; on April 15, 1930. By 1932, the club had one million members, and in 1933 its first UK club opened at Darlington&#x27;s Arcade Cinema. In 1935, Disney began to phase out the club.

==The original: 1955–59 show==
===Members===

&quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot; was hosted by Jimmie Dodd, a songwriter and the Head Mouseketeer, who provided leadership both on and off the screen. In addition to his other contributions, he often provided short segments encouraging younger viewers to make the right moral choices. These little &quot;homilies&quot; became known as &quot;Doddisms&quot;. Roy Williams, a staff artist at Disney, also appeared in the show as the Big Mouseketeer. Williams suggested that the Mickey and Minnie Mouse ears should be worn by the show&#x27;s cast members. Inspired by a visual gag in &quot;The Karnival Kid&quot;, he helped create these ears, along with Chuck Keehne, Hal Adelquist, and Bill Walsh.

The main cast members were called Mouseketeers, and they performed in a variety of musical and dance numbers, as well as some informational segments. The most popular of the Mouseketeers constituted the so-called Red Team, who appeared each day in the show’s opening roll call &amp; closing segments. 9 of those Red Team Mouseketeers were kept under contract for the entire run of the show (1955–1959):
* Sharon Baird
* Bobby Burgess
* Lonnie Burr
* Tommy Cole
* Annette Funicello
* Darlene Gillespie
* Cubby O&#x27;Brien
* Karen Pendleton
* Doreen Tracey

Other Mouseketeers who were Red Team members but did not star on the show for all three seasons included:
* Cheryl Holdridge (second and third year)
* Nancy Abbate (only first year)
* Johnny Crawford (only first year)
* Dennis Day (first and second year; was in the blue team for most of the first year, but he moved to the red team at the end of the first year)
* Mike Smith (only first year)
* Jay-Jay Solari (only second year)
* Don Underhill (only first year; joined the blue team by the end of the first year)

The remaining Mouseketeers, who were members of the White or Blue Teams, were Don Agrati (who was later known as Don Grady when he starred as &quot;Robbie&quot; on &quot;My Three Sons&quot;), Sherry Alberoni, Billie Jean Beanblossom, Eileen Diamond, Dickie Dodd (not related to Jimmie Dodd), Mary Espinosa, Bonnie Lynn Fields, Judy Harriet, Linda Hughes, Dallas Johann, John Lee Johann, Bonni Lou Kern, Charlie Laney, Larry Larsen, Paul Petersen, Lynn Ready, Mickey Rooney Jr., Tim Rooney, Mary Sartori, Bronson Scott, Margene Storey, Ronnie Steiner, and Mark Sutherland. Larry Larsen, on only for the 1956–57 season, was the oldest Mouseketeer, being born in 1939, and Bronson Scott, on only the 1955–56 season, was the youngest Mouseketeer, being born in July 1947. Among the thousands who auditioned but did not make the cut were future Oscar-winning vocalist/songwriter Paul Williams and future Primetime Emmy Award-winning actress Candice Bergen.

The 39 Mouseketeers and the seasons in which they were featured (with the team color which they belonged to are listed for each season):

Notes: Cole and Day were originally Blue Team members, but were promoted to the Red Team later in the first season.

Johann, Petersen, and the Rooney brothers were all let go early in the first season. Dallas&#x27;s brother John Lee replaced him, while Dodd and Steiner were hired as replacements for the Rooney brothers.

For the show&#x27;s fourth season, only a small amount of new footage was filmed and was interspliced with material from previous seasons. It is believed that only six of the Mouseketeers—Funicello, Gillespie, Tracey, Burgess, Pendleton, and O&#x27;Brien—were called back for the filming of new material, while Cole and Baird were merely used for some publicity material.

===Adult co-hosts===
* Jimmie Dodd
* Roy Williams
* Bob Amsberry

Other notable non-Mouseketeer performers appeared in several dramatic segments:
* Tim Considine
* Tommy Kirk
* Roberta Shore (Jymme Shore)
* David Stollery
* Judy Nugent
* Kevin Corcoran, a.k.a. Moochie
* J. Pat O&#x27;Malley
* Sammy Ogg
* Alvy Moore
* Julius Sumner Miller as &quot;Professor Wonderful&quot;

These non-Mouseketeers primarily appeared in several original serials filmed for the series, only some of which have appeared in reruns. Other Mouseketeers were also featured in some of the serials, particularly Annette Funicello and Darlene Gillespie.

===Major serials===
Major serials included:
* &quot;Spin and Marty&quot; starring Tim Considine and David Stollery
* &quot;The Hardy Boys&quot; starring Tim Considine and Tommy Kirk
* &quot;Corky and White Shadow&quot;, starring Darlene Gillespie
* &quot;Walt Disney Presents: Annette&quot;, starring Annette Funicello
* &quot;Adventure in Dairyland&quot;, featuring Annette Funicello and Sammy Ogg, and introducing Kevin Corcoran as Moochie
* &quot;Jiminy Cricket educational serials&quot; (four animated series educating kids on different topics)
* &quot;The Adventures of Clint and Mac&quot; (starring Neil Wolfe as Clint Rogers and Jonathan Bailey as Alastair &quot;Mac&quot; MacIntosh)
* &quot;Boys of the Western Sea&quot; (English-dubbed Danish film divided into nine 10-minute segments)
===Music===
The opening theme, &quot;The Mickey Mouse March&quot;, was written by the show&#x27;s primary adult host, Jimmie Dodd. It was also reprised at the end of each episode, with the slower &quot;it&#x27;s time to say goodbye&quot; verse. A shorter version of the opening title was used later in the series, in syndication, and on Disney Channel reruns. Dodd also wrote many other songs used in individual segments throughout the series.

===Show themes===
Each day of the week had a special show theme, which was reflected in the several segments. The themes were:
* Monday – Fun with Music Day
* Tuesday – Guest Star Day
* Wednesday – Anything Can Happen Day
* Thursday – Circus Day
* Friday – Talent Round-up Day

===Scheduling and air times===
The series ran on ABC Television for an hour each weekday in the 1955 and the 1956 seasons (from 5:00 - 6:00 pm ET), and only a half-hour weekdays in 1957, the final season to feature new programming. Although the show returned for a 1958 season, these programs were repeats from the first two seasons, recut into a half-hour format. &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot; was featured on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Adventure Time&quot;, featuring reruns of &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot; serials and several re-edited segments from &quot;Disneyland&quot; and &quot;Walt Disney Presents&quot;, appeared on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

===Cancellation===
Although the show remained popular, ABC decided to cancel it after its fourth season ended, because Disney and the ABC network could not come to terms for its renewal. The cancellation of the show in September 1959 was attributed to several factors: the Disney studios did not explain high profit margins from merchandise sales, sponsors were uninterested in educational programming for children, and many commercials were needed to pay for the show. After canceling &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot;, ABC also refused to let Disney air the show on another network. Walt Disney filed a lawsuit against ABC, and won the damages in a settlement the following year; however, he had to agree that both the &quot;Mickey Mouse Club&quot; and &quot;Zorro&quot; could not be aired on any major network. This left &quot;Walt Disney Presents&quot; (initially titled &quot;Disneyland&quot;, later retitled &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Wonderful World of Color&quot; when it moved to NBC) as the only Disney series which was left on prime time until 1972 when &quot;The Mouse Factory&quot; went on the air. The prohibition which prevented major U.S. broadcast networks from airing the original &quot;Mickey Mouse Club&quot; (or any later version of it) was disputed when Disney acquired ABC in 1996. Although it would not air on ABC again, Disney ran it on the Disney Channel&#x27;s &quot;Vault Disney&quot; block from 1998 to 2002.

===Australian tour===
Although the series had been ended in America, many members of the cast assembled for highly successful tours of Australia in 1959 and 1960. The television series was very successful in Australia and was still running on Australian television. The cast surprised Australian audiences, as by then they had physically matured and in some cases, bore little resemblance to the cast of youths with whom Australians were so familiar. Mainstream television did not reach Australia until 1956, so the series screened well into the 1960s when the back catalog expired.

===Syndication===
In response to continuing audience demand, the original &quot;Mickey Mouse Club&quot; went into edited syndicated half-hour reruns that enjoyed wide distribution starting in the fall of 1962, achieving strong ratings especially during its first three seasons in syndicated release. Because of its popularity in some markets, a few stations continued to carry it into 1968 before the series was finally withdrawn from syndication. Some new features were added such as &quot;Fun with Science&quot; or &quot;Professor Wonderful&quot; (with scientist Julius Sumner Miller) and &quot;Marvelous Marvin&quot; in the 1964–1965 season; Jimmie Dodd appeared in several of these new segments before his death in November 1964. Several markets expanded the program back to an hour&#x27;s daily run time during the 1960s repeat cycle by adding locally produced and hosted portions involving educational subjects and live audience participation of local children, in a manner not unlike &quot;Romper Room&quot;.

In response to an upsurge in demand from baby boomers entering adulthood, the show again went into syndicated reruns from January 20, 1975, until January 14, 1977. It has since been rerun on cable specialty channels Disney in the United States and Family in Canada. The original &quot;Mickey Mouse Club&quot; films aired five days a week on The Disney Channel from its launch in 1983 until the third version of the series began in 1989. The last airing of the edited 1950s material was on Disney Channel&#x27;s &quot;Vault Disney&quot; from 1997 to September 2002. During the baseball seasons in 1975 and 1976, WGN-TV in Chicago, Illinois, aired the show on a delayed basis due to Cubs baseball coverages.

===Reunions===
Annette Funicello and Tim Considine were reunited on &quot;The New Mickey Mouse Club&quot; in 1977. Darlene Gillespie and Cubby O&#x27;Brien were also reunited on another episode of the same series.

31 out of the 39 original Mouseketeers were reunited for a TV special, which aired on &quot;Disney&#x27;s Wonderful World&quot; in November 1980. Paul Williams – who hosted the special – and Tim Considine were named Honorary Mouseketeers during the special.

Cast members Annette Funicello, Bobby Burgess, Tommy Cole, Sharon Baird, Don Grady, and Sherry Alberoni were reunited on the 100th episode of &quot;The All-New Mickey Mouse Club&quot;, during the show&#x27;s third season in 1990.
Mouseketeers Doreen Tracey, Cubby O&#x27;Brien, Sherry Alberoni, Sharon Baird, Don Grady, Cheryl Holdridge, Bobby Burgess, Karen Pendleton, Tommy Cole, and Mary Espinosa performed together at Disneyland in Fall 2005, in observance of Disneyland&#x27;s 50th birthday, and the 50th anniversary of the television premiere of &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot;.

==1977–79 revival: &quot;The New Mickey Mouse Club&quot;==
In 1977, Walt Disney Productions revived the concept, but modernized the show cosmetically, with a disco re-recording of the theme song and a more ethnically diverse group of young cast members. The sets were brightly colored and simpler than the detailed black and white artwork of the original. Like the original, nearly every day&#x27;s episode included a vintage cartoon, though usually in color from the late 1930s onward. The 1977 Mouseketeers were part of the halftime show of Super Bowl XI on January 9, 1977.

===Serials===
Serials were usually old Disney movies, cut into segments for twice-weekly inclusion. Movies included &quot;Third Man on the Mountain&quot;, &quot;The Misadventures of Merlin Jones&quot; and its sequel &quot;The Monkey&#x27;s Uncle&quot; (both starring Tommy Kirk), &quot;Emil and the Detectives&quot; (retitled &quot;The Three Skrinks&quot;), &quot;Tonka&quot; (retitled &quot;A Horse Called Comanche&quot;), &quot;The Horse Without a Head&quot; (about a toy horse), and &quot;Toby Tyler&quot; (starring Kevin Corcoran). In addition, one original serial was produced, &quot;The Mystery of Rustler&#x27;s Cave&quot;, starring Kim Richards and Robbie Rist. Often shown were scenes from animated Disney films, from &quot;Snow White&quot; to &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; billed as &quot;Mouseka Movie Specials&quot;.

===Theme days===
Theme days were:
* Monday: Who, What, Why, Where, When and How
* Tuesday: Let&#x27;s Go
* Wednesday: Surprise
* Thursday: Discovery
* Friday: Showtime (at Disneyland, with performers usually at Plaza Gardens)

===Syndication===
The series debuted on January 17, 1977, on 38 local television stations in the United States, and by June of that same year, when the series was discontinued, about 70 stations in total had picked up the series. Additional stations picked up the canceled program, which continued to run until January 12, 1979; 130 new episodes, with much of the original material repackaged and a bit of new footage added, and a shortened version of the theme song, was produced to start airing September 5, 1977. Since the 1970s, the series has aired only briefly and sporadically in reruns, and only on the Disney Channel&#x27;s Vault Disney nighttime block (1997-2002). Unlike its 1950s predecessor and the 1989/1990s series that followed, which had DVD releases of select episodes in July 2005, this version has not had a DVD release and has been largely forgotten by many, including many kids of the 1970s who made it their club. On November 20, 1977, &quot;The Mouseketeers at Walt Disney World&quot; was shown on &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot;. WGN-TV in Chicago, Illinois, also aired this version on a delayed basis in 1977 and 1978 during the Cubs baseball season due to game coverages. Action for Children&#x27;s Television successfully got the show canceled because of their objections to the types of commercials that aired during the program. It also aired on BBC One in the United Kingdom from 1978 to 1980, and on TVB Pearl in Hong Kong from 1978.

===Cast===
The cast of 12 (five boys and seven girls) had a more diverse multiethnic background than the 1950s version. Several 1977–1978 cast members went on to become TV stars and other notable icons.

The show&#x27;s most notable alumnus was Lisa Whelchel (born in 1963, in Littlefield, Texas), who later starred in the NBC television sitcom &quot;The Facts of Life&quot;, which ran from 1979 to 1988, before becoming a well-known Christian author, and overall runner-up, and winner of the $100,000 viewers&#x27; choice award, on the of the CBS television reality series &quot;Survivor&quot;. Mouseketeer Julie Piekarski (born in 1963 in St. Louis, Missouri) also appeared with Lisa Whelchel on the first season of &quot;The Facts of Life&quot;. Kelly Parsons (born in 1964, in Coral Gables, Florida) went on to become a beauty queen and runner-up to Miss USA.

Other Mouseketeers (from seasons 1–2) from the 1977 show:
* William &quot;Billy&quot;/&quot;Pop&quot; Attmore: born at US military base in Landstuhl, West Germany, 1965; appeared in a few movies before and after the series, a final season episode of &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; (&quot;Kelly&#x27;s Kids&quot;), and as a streetwise hood in the short-lived &quot;Eischied&quot; crime drama; died July 30, 2023. 
* Scott Craig: born in Van Nuys, California, in 1964; lived in Las Vegas, Nevada, died December 30, 2003, from a respiratory illness.
* Benita &quot;Nita Dee&quot; DiGiampaolo: born in Long Beach, California, in 1966; appeared at the last end of an episode in 1981 of &quot;Fantasy Island&quot; as Elena. Nita appeared in &quot;ABC Family Weekends&quot; in 1978 as Nita and 1978 as Maria. Nita also starred in Upbeat Aesop (ABC) produced by Ron Miziker (A Disney executive).
* Mindy Feldman: born in Burbank, California, in 1968; sister of actor Corey Feldman.
* Angel Florez: born in Stockton, California, in 1963; died April 25, 1995, from an AIDS-related illness.
* Allison Fonte: born in Buena Park, California, in 1964.
* Shawnte Northcutte: born in Los Angeles, California, in 1965; appeared on an episode of &quot;The Facts of Life&quot;, as Madge.
* Todd Turquand: born in Hollywood, California, in 1964.
* Curtis Wong: born in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada in 1962; appeared on an episode of &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot;, as an assistant karate instructor under Soon-Tek Oh.

Disney voice actor and sound effects editor Wayne Allwine voiced Mickey Mouse in the animated lead-ins for the show, replacing Jimmy MacDonald, who in 1947 had replaced Walt Disney as the voice of Mickey for theatrical short cartoons. Walt Disney was the original voice of Mickey, voiced Mickey for the original 1954–1959 run, and provided the voice for animated introductions to the original TV show but died in 1966. Following MacDonald&#x27;s tenure, Allwine provided the voice for the character up to his death in 2009.

Future rock musician Courtney Love (wife of Nirvana lead singer Kurt Cobain) claims to have auditioned for a part on the show, reading a poem by Sylvia Plath; she was not selected.

Former Mouseketeers Annette Funicello and serial star Tim Considine guest-starred in one episode; former Mouseketeers Darlene Gillespie and Cubby O&#x27;Brien were also reunited on another episode.

===Theme song and soundtrack===
The lyrics of the &quot;Mickey Mouse Club March&quot; theme song were slightly different from the original, with two additional lines: &quot;He&#x27;s our favorite Mouseketeer; we know you will agree&quot; and &quot;Take some fun and mix in love, our happy recipe&quot;.

A soundtrack album was released with the show.

A new rendition of the &quot;Mickey Mouse Club March&quot; was made later on in 1999 by Mannheim Steamroller, a contemporary band, in hopes of connecting new-age children and their parents who watched the &quot;Mickey Mouse Club&quot;.

===Distribution===
This incarnation was not distributed by Disney only; while Disney did produce the series, it was co-produced and distributed by SFM Entertainment, which also handled 1970s-era syndication of the original 1950s series. (Disney since re-acquired only distribution rights.)

==1989–94 revival: &quot;The All-New Mickey Mouse Club&quot;==
Reruns of the original &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot; began airing on The Disney Channel with the channel&#x27;s 1983 launch. While the show was popular with younger audiences, the Disney Channel executives felt it had become dated over the years, particularly because it was aired in black-and-white. Their answer was to create a brand-new, rebooted version of the club, one targeted at contemporary audiences. Notably, the all-new &quot;club-members&quot; wore Mouseketeer varsity jackets instead of iconic Mickey Mouse ears. This show was called &quot;The All-New Mickey Mouse Club&quot; (also known as &quot;MMC&quot; to fans).

This version of the series is notable for featuring a number of cast members who went on to achieve global success in music and acting, including actor Ryan Gosling, future NSYNC members Justin Timberlake and JC Chasez, singers Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera, actress Keri Russell, voice actress Deedee Magno, future En Vogue member Rhona Bennett, and Hallmark movie star Nikki DeLoach.

Throughout the show&#x27;s run, Fred Newman was the main adult co-host from the beginning of the series until season 6. In the first season, Newman was joined by other co-host Mowava Pryor. She was then replaced by Terri Eoff from the fourth season until the sixth season. By the show&#x27;s final season, two original members, Chase Hampton and Tiffini Hale, became the co-hosts.

This was also the first version of the club to have any studio audience, though a moderate sized group.

Former Mouseketeer Don Grady guest-starred in the season 1 finale. Grady, along with fellow Mouseketeers Annette Funicello, Bobby Burgess, Tommy Cole, Sharon Baird, and Sherry Alberoni were reunited on the 100th episode, during the show&#x27;s third season. Funicello later appeared on the show again, in an interview with the Mouseketeer Lindsey Alley.

===Scheduling and air times===
For the first five seasons, the series aired Monday through Friday at 5:30 pm. The show&#x27;s sixth season aired Monday to Thursday. In its final season, it aired Thursdays only at 7:00 pm (later moved a half hour later, to 7:30 pm). The series premiered Monday, April 24, 1989, ended production in October 1994, and aired its last original episode in 1996. Seasons 3 and 5 had the most episodes at 55 each, with seasons 1, 2, and 7 running about 45 episodes. Seasons 4 and 6 had about 36 episodes each.

===Skits===
The show was known for its sketch comedy. Some of the sketches played off famous movies, musicals, and even cartoons, as well as holiday-related skits. During the final season, some of the skits showed everyday occurrences in the lives of adolescents.

===Music videos===
The series featured music videos of the Mouseketeers singing their versions of popular songs in front of a live studio audience or at locations within Walt Disney World. This became one of the most popular segments. Due to the age of both the performers and the target demographic, lyrics with objectionable content were generally edited out of the songs and replaced with more appropriate language.

===Live concerts and performances===
A unique feature of the show was the Mouseketeers performing concerts on different days (which were usually taped the day before or in the summer, when the kids had more time). During the final season, the concerts were replaced primarily by live performances that featured singing and dancing in front of the audience.

===Theme days===
This version maintained the &quot;theme day&quot; format from the previous two versions. When Disney decided to revamp the show for its final season, the show was reduced to a single weekly airing, shown only on Thursdays. Although still produced as a daily series during the final season taping in 1994, The Disney Channel, after canceling the series once season 7 production had ended, decided to air the final season in a weekly format, therefore stretching the first-run episodes into early 1996. The final season premiered in May 1995, almost a year after production had started and more than 6 months after the series finale was taped.

Theme days were:
* Music Day – Mondays (seasons 1–5), Tuesdays (season 6)
* Guest Day – Tuesdays (seasons 1–5), Mondays (season 6)
* Anything Can Happen Day – Wednesdays (seasons 1–5)
* Party Day – Thursdays (seasons 1–4, 6), Fridays (season 5)
* Hall of Fame Day – Fridays (seasons 1–4), Thursdays (season 5), Wednesdays (season 6)

===Mouseketeer roster===
The adult co-hosts for the show were Fred Newman (1989–1993), Mowava Pryor (1989–1990), Terri Misner Eoff (1991–1993), Tiffini Hale (1994), and Chase Hampton (1994).

The 35 Mouseketeers and the seasons in which they were featured are:
Note: For the show&#x27;s fourth season, Albert Fields, Tiffini Hale, Chase Hampton, Deedee Magno, and Damon Pampolina were featured in segments as &quot;The Party&quot;, primarily in footage separate from the rest of the cast.

===&quot;Emerald Cove&quot;===
During the last three seasons of MMC they had a pre-recorded drama series called &quot;Emerald Cove&quot; with the older cast members:
*Rhona Bennett
*J.C. Chasez
*Dale Godboldo 
*Ricky Luna
*Tony Lucca 
*Ilana Miller
*Keri Russell
*Marc Worden 
*Matt Morris
*Jennifer McGill
*Joshua Ackerman
*Nikki Deloach

==2017–18 American revival: &quot;Club Mickey Mouse&quot;==

&quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot; was rebooted under the name &quot;Club Mickey Mouse&quot; with a new set of Mouseketeers in September 2017, and for the first time, the series was made available on Facebook and Instagram, rather than its original half hour to full hour format on television, and is more like a reality show than a variety show, with about 90% of its content being behind the scenes. This incarnation of &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot; featured eight Mouseketeers who ranged in age from 15 to 18: Regan Aliyah, Jenna Alvarez, Ky Baldwin, Gabe De Guzman, Leanne Tessa Langston, Brianna Mazzola, Sean Oliu, and Will Simmons. The Mouseketeers were also joined by the guest star Todrick Hall, who also served as a mentor to the cast during the casting, and Jennifer Chia as the host. The series was produced by Disney Digital Network. No new episodes or music videos have been produced since 2018.

==International revivals==

=== 2015 Korean revival: &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot; ===
A new version of the series debuted on July 23, 2015, on Disney Channel Korea. The format of revival included musical performances, games, and skits, as same as the original one in the US. The series had two pilot episodes and ten regular episodes. The Mouseketeers consisted of nine members of S.M. Entertainment&#x27;s pre-debut trainees team SM Rookies, consisting of five boys – Mark, Jeno, Haechan, Jaemin, and Jisung – and four girls – Koeun, Hina, Herin, and Lami.

The series was hosted by Leeteuk of boy band Super Junior.

The show ended on December 17 the same year.

===2017–2021 Malaysian revival: &quot;Club Mickey Mouse&quot;===

&quot;Club Mickey Mouse&quot; was created in Malaysia. The format included musical performances, games and comedy sketches.

The series was hosted by YouTube personality, Charis Ow, and premiered on Disney Channel Asia on September 15, 2017. The series was renewed for a second season, which premiered on July 6, 2018, and a third season which premiered on June 14, 2019. All members appeared as guest stars (except Dheena Menon who was taking an exam) on Episode 14 (&quot;Friends in Need, Indeed!&quot;) on Disney Channel Asia Original Series, Wizards of Warna Walk.

Charis and Dheena did not return in the season because Charis was getting married. Disney Channel Asia decided to pick two new Mouseketeers for an audition, revealed to be Eric and Melynna. But due to the shutdown of the channels, the season 4 of &quot;Club Mickey Mouse&quot; was aired in 2021 exclusively on Disney+ Hotstar instead and SKTV Kids in 2023.

In November 2021, it was reported that the fourth season of this show will be aired on Disney+ in selected territories. The series was removed from Disney+ on May 26, 2023, amidst the Disney+ and Hulu purge.

<doc id="20665" wikidata="Q23168" url="?curid=20665" title="Minos">
<text>In Greek mythology, Minos (; , ) was a king of Crete, son of Zeus and Europa. Every nine years, he made King Aegeus pick seven young boys and seven young girls to be sent to Daedalus&#x27;s creation, the labyrinth, to be eaten by the Minotaur. After his death, King Minos became a judge of the dead in the underworld alongside Rhadamanthus and Aeacus.

Archeologist Sir Arthur Evans used King Minos as the namesake for the Minoan civilization of Crete. The Minoan palace at Knossos is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Palace of Minos&quot; though there is no evidence that Minos was a real person.

== Literary Minos ==
Minos appears in Greek literature as the king of Knossos as early as Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot;. Thucydides tells us Minos was the most ancient man known to build a navy. He reigned over Crete and the islands of the Aegean Sea three generations before the Trojan War. He lived at Knossos for nine years, where he received instruction from Zeus in the legislation he gave to the island. He was the author of the Cretan constitution and the founder of its naval supremacy.

On the Athenian stage, Minos was one who had strong character, but was also a cruel tyrant. When Asterius died, Minos was boasting to himself that he deserved the rule while shunning the gods. According to Homer, Minos conversed with Zeus every nine years, for educational purposes. Being the only one who received lessons from Zeus made Minos receive great praise. However, he was the heartless exactor of the tribute of Athenian youths to feed to the Minotaur, in revenge for the death of his son Androgeus during a riot (see Theseus). While Minos had stern character and was the law of the land, he was also cruel; this made Minos one who was respected but also greatly feared.

=== Later rationalization ===
To reconcile the contradictory aspects of his character, as well as to explain how Minos governed Crete over a period spanning so many generations, two kings by the name of Minos were assumed by later poets and rationalizing mythologists, such as Diodorus Siculus and Plutarch - &quot;putting aside the mythological element&quot;, as he claims - in his life of Theseus.

According to this view, the first King Minos was the son of Zeus and Europa and the brother of Rhadamanthys and Sarpedon. This was the &#x27;good&#x27; king Minos, and he was held in such esteem by the Olympian gods that, after he died, he was made one of the three &quot;Judges of the Dead&quot;, alongside his brother Rhadamanthys and half-brother Aeacus. The wife of this &quot;Minos I&quot; was said to be Itone (daughter of Lyktos) or Crete (a nymph or daughter of his stepfather Asterion), and he had a single son named Lycastus, his successor as King of Crete.

Lycastus had a son named Minos, after his grandfather, born by Lycastus&#x27; wife, Ida, daughter of Corybas. &quot;Minos II&quot;—the &quot;bad&quot; king Minos—is the son of this Lycastus, and was a far more colorful character than his father and grandfather. This is the Minos in the myths of Theseus, Pasiphaë, the Minotaur, Daedalus, Glaucus, and Nisus. Unlike Minos I, Minos II fathered numerous children, including Androgeus, Catreus, Deucalion, Ariadne, Phaedra, and Glaucus—all born to him by his wife, Pasiphaë. Through Deucalion, he was the grandfather of King Idomeneus, who led the Cretans to the Trojan War.

== Family ==
By his wife, Pasiphaë (or some say Crete), the daughter of the Sun (Helios), and mother of the Minotaur, he fathered Ariadne, Androgeus, Deucalion, Phaedra, Glaucus, Catreus, Acacallis, and Xenodice. By a nymph, Pareia, he had four sons, Eurymedon, Nephalion, Chryses, and Philolaus, whom Heracles killed in revenge for the murder of the latter&#x27;s two companions. By Dexithea, one of the Telchines, he had a son called Euxanthius. By Androgeneia of Phaistos, he had Asterion, who commanded the Cretan contingent in the war between Dionysus and the Indians. Also given as his children are Euryale, possibly the mother of Orion with Poseidon, and Pholegander, eponym of the island Pholegandros. Minos, along with his brothers, Rhadamanthys and Sarpedon, was raised by King Asterion (or Asterius) of Crete. When Asterion died, his throne was claimed by Minos, who, according to some sources, banished his brothers.

== Mythological Minos ==
Asterion, king of Crete, adopted the three sons of Zeus and Europa: Minos, Sarpedon, and Rhadamanthus. According to the &quot;Odyssey&quot; (Book XIX l. 203, as interpreted by Plato in &quot;Laws&quot; 624), Minos consulted with Zeus every nine years. He got his laws straight from Zeus himself. When Minos&#x27; son Androgeos won the Panathenaic Games, the king, Aegeus, sent him to Marathon to fight a bull, resulting in the death of Androgeos. Outraged, Minos went to Athens to avenge his son, and on the way, he camped at Megara, where Nisos lived. Learning that Nisos&#x27; strength came from his hair, Minos gained the love of Scylla and her aid in cutting off her father&#x27;s hair so that he could conquer the city. After his triumph, he punished Scylla for her treachery against her father by tying her to a boat and dragging her until she drowned. On arriving in Attica, he asked Zeus to punish the city, and the god struck it with plague and hunger. An oracle told the Athenians to meet any of Minos&#x27; demands if they wanted to escape the punishment. Minos then asked Athens to send seven boys and seven girls to Crete every nine years to be sacrificed to the Minotaur (the offspring from the zoophilic encounter of Minos&#x27; wife Pasiphaë with the Cretan Bull that the king refused to surrender to Poseidon) which he had placed within a labyrinth he commanded his architect Daedalus to build. The Minotaur was defeated by the hero Theseus with the help of Minos&#x27; daughter Ariadne.

=== Glaucus ===

Glaucus was playing with a ball or mouse and suddenly disappeared one day. The Curetes told the Cretans, &quot;A marvelous creature has been born amongst you: whoever finds the true likeness of this creature will also find the child.&quot;

Three times a day, the calf changed color from white to red to black. Polyidus of Argos observed the similarity to the ripening of the fruit of the mulberry plant, and Minos sent him to find Glaucus.

Searching for the boy, Polyidus saw an owl driving bees away from a wine cellar in Minos&#x27; palace. Inside the wine cellar was a cask of honey, with Glaucus dead inside. Minos demanded Glaucus be brought back to life, though Polyidus objected. Minos ordered Polyidus to be entombed with the body. When a snake appeared nearby, Polyidus killed it immediately. Another snake came for the first, and after seeing its mate dead, the second serpent left and brought back an herb, bringing the first snake back to life. Following this example, Polyidus used the same herb to resurrect Glaucus.

Minos refused to let Polyidus leave Crete until he taught Glaucus the art of divination. Polyidus did so, but then, at the last moment before leaving, he asked Glaucus to spit in his mouth. Glaucus did so and forgot everything he had been taught.

=== Poseidon, Daedalus and Pasiphaë ===
Minos justified his accession as king and prayed to Poseidon for a sign. Poseidon sent a giant white bull out of the sea. Minos was committed to sacrificing the bull to Poseidon but then decided to substitute a different bull. Poseidon cursed Pasiphaë, Minos&#x27; wife, in rage, with a mad passion for the bull. Daedalus built her a wooden cow, which she hid inside. The bull mated with the wooden cow, and Pasiphaë was impregnated by the bull, giving birth to a horrible monster, again named Asterius, the Minotaur, half-man half bull. Daedalus then built a complicated &quot;chamber that with its tangled windings perplexed the outward way&quot; called the Labyrinth, and Minos put the Minotaur in it. To make sure no one would ever know the secret of who the Minotaur was and how to get out of the Labyrinth (Daedalus knew both of these things), Minos imprisoned Daedalus and his son, Icarus, along with the monster. Daedalus and Icarus flew away on wings Daedalus invented, but Icarus&#x27; wings melted because he flew too close to the sun. Icarus fell into the sea and drowned.

=== Theseus ===
Minos&#x27; son Androgeus won every game in a contest hosted by Aegeas of Athens. Alternatively, the other contestants were jealous of Androgeus and killed him. Minos was angry and declared war on Athens. He offered the Athenians peace if they sent Minos seven young men and seven virgin maidens to feed the Minotaur yearly (which corresponded directly to the Minoans&#x27; meticulous records of lunar alignments – a full moon falls on the equinoxes once every eight years). This continued until Theseus killed the Minotaur with the help of Ariadne, Minos&#x27; lovestruck daughter.

=== Nisus ===
Minos was also part of the King Nisus story. Nisus was King of Megara and was invincible as long as a lock of crimson hair still existed, hidden in his white hair. Minos attacked Megara, but Nisus knew he could not be beaten because he still had his lock of crimson hair. His daughter, Scylla, fell in love with Minos and proved it by cutting the crimson hair off her father&#x27;s head. Nisus died, and Megara fell to Crete. Minos spurned Scylla for disobeying her father. She was changed into a shearer bird, relentlessly pursued by her father, who was a falcon.

=== Death ===
Minos searched for Daedalus by traveling from city to city, asking a riddle; he presented a spiral seashell and asked for it to be strung all the way through. When he reached Camicus, Sicily, King Cocalus, knowing Daedalus would be able to solve the riddle, fetched the old man. He tied the string to an ant, which walked through the seashell, stringing it all the way through. Minos then knew Daedalus was in the court of King Cocalus and demanded he be handed over. Cocalus managed to convince him to take a bath first; then Cocalus&#x27; daughters and Daedalus, with Minos trapped in the tub, scalded him to death with boiling water.

After his death, Minos became a judge of the dead in Hades together with his half-brother Aeacus and his full-brother Rhadamanthus. Rhadamanthus judged the souls of Asians, Aeacus judged Europeans, and Minos had the deciding vote.

== Minos in art ==


On Cretan coins, Minos is represented as bearded, wearing a diadem, curly-haired, haughty, and dignified, like the traditional portraits of his reputed father, Zeus. He frequently occurs on painted vases and sarcophagus bas-reliefs, with Aeacus and Rhadamanthus as underworld judges and in connection with the Minotaur and Theseus.

In Michelangelo&#x27;s famous fresco, &quot;The Last Judgment&quot; (located in the Sistine Chapel), Minos appears as a judge of the underworld, surrounded by a crowd of devils. With his tail coiled around him and two donkey ears (symbol of stupidity), Minos judges the damned as they are brought down to hell (see &quot;Inferno&quot;, Second Circle).

=== In poetry ===
In the &quot;Aeneid&quot; of Virgil, Minos was the judge of those who had been given the death penalty on a false charge - Minos sits with a huge urn and decides whether a soul should go to Elysium or Tartarus with the help of a silent jury. Radamanthus, his brother, is a judge at Tartarus who decides upon suitable punishments for sinners there.

In Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; story &quot;Inferno&quot;, Minos is depicted as having a snake-like tail. He sits at the entrance to the second circle in the &quot;Inferno&quot;, which is the beginning of Hell proper. There, he judges the sins of each soul and assigns it to its appropriate punishment by indicating the circle to which it must descend. He does this by circling his tail around his body the appropriate number of times. He can also speak to clarify the soul&#x27;s location within the circle indicated by the wrapping of his tail.

== Astronomy ==
Minor planet 6239 Minos is named after Minos. Its orbit being relatively close to Earth&#x27;s, it is deemed as a potentially hazardous asteroid.

<doc id="20666" wikidata="Q217429" url="?curid=20666" title="Metre Convention">
<text>The Metre Convention (), also known as the Treaty of the Metre, is an international treaty that was signed in Paris on 20 May 1875 by representatives of 17 nations: Argentina, Austria-Hungary, Belgium, Brazil, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Peru, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Sweden and Norway, Switzerland, Ottoman Empire, United States of America, and Venezuela.

The treaty created the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM), an intergovernmental organization, under the authority of the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) and the supervision of the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM). These organizations coordinate international metrology and the development of internationally recognized systems of measurement.

The Metre Convention established a permanent organizational structure for member governments to act in common accord on all matters relating to units of measurement. The governing organs of the BIPM are:
* The General Conference on Weights and Measures ( or CGPM)—the plenary organ of the BIPM which consists of the delegates of all the contracting governments, and 
* The International Committee for Weights and Measures ( or CIPM)—the direction and supervision organ composed of 18 prominent metrologists from 18 different member states
The headquarters or secretariat of the BIPM is at Saint-Cloud, France. It employs around 70 people and hosts BIPM&#x27;s formal meetings.

Initially the scope of the Metre Convention covered only units of mass and length. In 1921, at the sixth meeting of the CGPM, convention was amended to its scope to other fields in physics. In 1960, at the eleventh meeting of the CGPM, its system of units was named the International System of Units (, abbreviated SI).

The Metre Convention provides that only nations can be members of the BIPM. In 1999, the CGPM created in the status of associate, to allow non-member states and economic entities to participate in some activities of the BIPM through their national metrology institutes (NMIs).

, the CGPM had 64 members and 37 associates.

Membership in the CGPM requires payment of substantial fees. Being in arrears with these payments over a span of years has led to expulsion of some former members.

== Background ==

Before the French Revolution, which started in 1789, French units of measurement were based on the Carolingian system, introduced by the first Holy Roman Emperor Charlemagne (800–814 AD) which in turn were based on ancient Roman measures. Charlemagne brought a consistent system of measures across the entire empire. However, after his death, the empire fragmented and many rulers introduced their own variants of the units of measure.

Some of Charlemagne&#x27;s units of measure, such as the (the king&#x27;s foot) remained virtually unchanged for about a thousand years, while others, such as the (ell – used to measure cloth) and the (pound) varied dramatically from locality to locality. By the time of the revolution, the number of units of measure had grown to the extent that it was almost impossible to keep track of them.

In England in 1215, clause 35 of Magna Carta required that the same standards of measurement be applied throughout the realm. The wording of the clause emphasized that &quot;There is to be a single measure ... throughout our realm&quot;. Five centuries later, when in 1707 England and Scotland were united into a single kingdom, the Scots agreed to use the same units of measure that were already established in England. During the eighteenth century, in order to facilitate trade, Peter the Great, Czar of Russia adopted the English system of measure.

From 1668 to 1776 the French standard of length was the Toise of Châtelet which was fixed outside the Grand Châtelet in Paris. In 1735 two geodetic standards were calibrated against the Toise of Châtelet. One of them, the Toise of Peru was used for the French Geodesic Mission to the Equator. In 1766 the Toise of Peru became the official standard of length in France and was renamed Toise of the Academy ().

Profusion of units of measures was a practical problem of importance before the French Revolution and its reform was one of the items on the agenda of National Assembly. In 1799, after the remeasurement of the Paris meridian arc () between Dunkirk and Barcelona by Delambre and Mechain, the metre was defined as a quarter of a 10-millionth of the Earth circumference or 3 (French feet) and 11.296 (lines) of the Toise of the Academy. Talleyrand, an influential leader of the Assembly invited British and American participation in the establishment of a new system, but in the event, the Assembly went it alone and introduced the metre and the kilogram which were to form the basis of the metric system, manufacturing prototypes which, in 1799, were lodged with Archives.

The Helvetic Republic adopted the metric system in 1803. In 1805, a Swiss immigrant Ferdinand Rudolph Hassler brought copies of the French metre and kilogram to the United States. In 1830 the Congress decided to create uniform standards for length and weight in the United States. Hassler was mandated to work out the new standards and proposed to adopt the metric system. The United States Congress opted for the British Parliamentary Standard Yard of 1758 and the British Troy Pound of 1824 as length and weight standards. Nevertheless, the primary baseline of the U.S. Survey of the Coast, which was renamed the United States Coast Survey in 1836 and the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1878, was measured in 1834 at Fire Island using four two-metre iron bars constructed after Hassler&#x27;s specification in the United Kingdom and brought back to the United States in 1815. All distances measured by the Survey of the Coast, Coast Survey, and Coast and Geodetic Survey were referred to the metre.

Between 1840 and 1870, a number of countries definitively adopted the metric system as their system of measure including France, Spain, many South American republics and many of the Italian and German states (the Netherlands had adopted the system in 1817). In 1863, the International Postal Union used grams to express permitted weights of letters.

In 1852 the Spanish Government was urged by the Spanish Royal Academy of Sciences to approve the creation of a large-scale map of Spain. The following year Carlos Ibáñez e Ibáñez de Ibero was appointed to undertake this task. All the scientific and technical material had to be created. Carlos Ibáñez e Ibáñez de Ibero and Frutos Saavedra Meneses went to Paris to supervise the production by Brunner of a four metres long measuring instrument which they had devised and which they later compared with Borda&#x27;s double-toise No. 1, which was the main reference for measuring all geodetic bases in France and whose length was 3.8980732 metres.

In 1867 at the second General Conference of the International Association of Geodesy () held in Berlin, the question of international standard of length was discussed in order to combine the measurements made in different countries to determine the size and shape of the earth. The conference recommended the adoption of the metric system (replacing Bessel&#x27;s toise, a copy of the Toise of Peru made in 1823) and the creation of an International Metre Commission.

In the 1860s, inspections of the prototype metre revealed wear and tear at the measuring faces of the bar and also that the bar was wont to flex slightly when in use. In view of the doubts being cast on the reproducibility of the metre and the kilogram and the threat that a rival standard might be set up, Napoleon III invited scientists from all the world&#x27;s nations to attend a conference in Paris. In July 1870, two weeks before the conference was due to start, the Franco-Prussian War broke out. Although the delegates did meet (without a German delegation), it was agreed that the conference should be recalled once all the delegates (including the German delegation) were present. The International Metre Commission was established in Paris.

Following the war, which resulted in Napoleon III&#x27;s exile, Germany and Italy, now unified nations, adopted the metric system as their national system of units, but with the prototype copy of the kilogram and metre under the control of the French Third Republic. In 1872 the new republican government reissued the invitations and in 1875 scientists from thirty European and American countries met in Paris. This same year, the International Association of Geodesy held its General Conference in Paris and decided the creation of an international geodetic standard for baselines&#x27; measurement, calibrated against the metre.

== 1875 conference ==
The principal tasks facing the delegates at the 1875 conference was the replacement of the existing metre and kilogram artefacts that were held by the French Government and the setting up of an organization to administer the maintenance of standards around the globe. The conference did not concern itself with other units of measure. The conference had undertones of Franco-German political manoeuvring, particularly since the French had been humiliated by the Prussians during the war a few years previously. Although France lost control of the metric system, they ensured that it passed to international rather than German control and that the international headquarters were in Paris. Spain notably supported France for this outcome and the first president of the International Committee for Weights and Measures, the Spanish geodesist, Carlos Ibáñez e Ibáñez de Ibero received the Grand Officer medal of the Légion d&#x27;Honneur for his diplomatic role on this issue and was awarded the Poncelet Prize for his scientific contribution to metrology. Indeed, as Carlos Ibáñez e Ibáñez de Ibero was collaborating with the French on the Paris meridian arc (West Europe-Africa Meridian-arc) remeasurement since 1853, and was president of both the Permanent Committee of the International Metre Commission since 1872 and the Permanent Commission of the International Association of Geodesy since 1874, he was to play a pivotal role in reconciling French and German interests.

=== Reference standards ===

The conference was called to discuss the maintenance of international standards based on the existing French standards rather than using French standards which, at that time, were 70 years old and which, through wear and tear, might not be exactly the same as when they adopted in 1799.

Prior to the 1870 conference, French politicians had feared that the world community might reject the existing metre as it was 0.03% (300 μm) shorter than its design length, ordering a new meridional measurement. They were eventually reassured when the German-born Swiss delegate Adolphe Hirsch said &quot;no serious scientist would in our day and age contemplate a metre deduced from the size of the earth&quot;. When the conference was reconvened in 1875, it was proposed that new prototype metre and kilogram standards be manufactured to reproduce the values of the existing artifacts as closely as possible.

Although the new standard metre had the same value as the old metre, it had an &quot;X&quot; cross-section designed by Henri Tresca rather than a rectangular cross-section as this reduced the flexing when taking measurements. Moreover, the new bar, rather than being exactly one metre in length was a little longer than one metre and had lines engraved on them that were exactly one metre apart. The London firm Johnson Matthey delivered 30 prototype metres and 40 prototype kilograms. At the first meeting of the CGPM in 1889 bar No. 6 and cylinder No. X were chosen by lot as the international prototypes. The remainder were either kept as BIPM working copies or distributed by lot to member states as national prototypes.

The prototype metre was retained as the international standard until 1960 when the metre was redefined in terms of the wavelength of the orange-red line of krypton-86. The current definition of the metre is &quot;the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/ of a second&quot;.

On 16 November 2018, the 26th General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) voted unanimously in favour of revised definitions of some SI base units, in particular the kilogram. The new definitions came into force on 20 May 2019, but do not change the metre.

=== International organization ===
The Convention created an international organization with two governing organs to facilitate the standardization of weights and measures around the world. The first, the CGPM provides a forum for representative of member states, the second, the CIPM is an advisory committee of metrologists of high standing. The Secretariat or Headquarters provides appropriate meeting and laboratory facilities in support of the CGPM and CIPM.

The structure may be compared to a corporation, the CIPM is analogous to a board of directors, and the CGPM to a shareholders&#x27; meeting.

==== General Conference on Weights and Measures ====
The General Conference on Weights and Measures ( or CGPM) is the principal decision-making body put on place by the convention. It is made up of delegates from member states and [non-voting] observers from associate states and economies. The conference usually meets every four years to receive and discuss a report from the CIPM and to endorse new developments in the SI on the advice of the CIPM though at the 2011 meeting, it agreed to meet again in 2014 rather than 2015 to discuss the maturity of the new SI proposals. It is also responsible for new appointments to the CIPM and decides on major issues concerning the development and financing of the BIPM. According to the Metre Convention (Art. 4) the President of the French Academy of Sciences is also the President of the General Conference on Weights and Measures.

==== International Committee for Weights and Measures ====

The International Committee for Weights and Measures ( or CIPM) is made up of eighteen (originally fourteen) individuals from a member state of high scientific standing, nominated by the CGPM to advise the CGPM on administrative and technical matters. It is responsible for the running of ten consultative committees (CCs), each of which investigates different aspects of metrology – one CC discusses the measurement of temperature, another the measurement of mass and so on. The CIPM meets annually at Saint-Cloud to discuss annual reports from the various CCs, to submit an annual report to the governments of member states in respect of the administration and finances of the BIPM and to advise the CGPM on technical matters as and when necessary. Each member of the CIPM is from a different member state – with France, in recognition of its work in setting up the convention, always having one seat on the CIPM.

==== Secretariat of the BIPM ====
The Secretariat (or Headquarters) of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures ( or BIPM) is based at Saint-Cloud, France. It has custody of the now historical international prototype of the kilogram and provides metrology services for Member States and hosts formal meetings. It also has custody of the former international prototype of the metre which was retired in 1960. Over the years the various prototypes of the metre and of the kilogram were returned to the BIPM laboratories for recalibration services.

Initially it had a staff of 9, falling to 4 once the initial batch of prototypes had been distributed; in 2012 it had a staff of over 70 people and an annual budget of over €10 million. The director of the BIPM is &quot;ex-officio&quot; a member of the CIPM and a member of all consultative committees.

=== Headquarters, language and protocol ===

The original treaty was written in French and the authoritative language of all official documents is French. Communication between the BIPM and member states is, in the case of France, via the French Foreign Minister and in the case of all other members, via the members&#x27; ambassador to France.

The French government offered the treaty members the Pavillon de Breteuil in Saint-Cloud to house the BIPM. The Pavillon was originally built in 1675 on the estate of the Château de Saint-Cloud which was home to, amongst others, Emperor Napoleon III. The château was all but destroyed during the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1) and the Pavillon badly damaged. The Pavillon has been fully restored and, as headquarters of an intergovernmental organization enjoys privileges and immunities.

== Post-1875 developments ==
The science of metrology has progressed vastly since 1875. In particular the treaty was amended in 1921 with the result that many other international organizations have a forum within the CIPM to ensure harmonization of measurement standards across many disciplines. In addition, what were originally conceived as standards for the purposes of trade have now been extended to cover a large number of aspects of human activity including medicine, science, engineering and technology.

=== Extensions to the treaty (1921) and development of the SI ===
The metre convention was originally drawn up with the main purpose of providing standards of length and mass only. Standards relating to other quantities were under the control of other bodies – time was measured by astronomers, electrical units by a series of ad-hoc international conferences, and other physical standards and concepts were maintained or defined by international bodies such as International Congress of Applied Chemistry or the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics.

In 1901 Giorgi published a proposal for building a coherent set of units based on four base units – the metre, kilogram, second and one electrical unit (ampere, volt or ohm). In 1921 the convention was extended to permit the promotion of standards relating to any physical quantity which greatly increased the scope of the CIPM&#x27;s remit and implicitly giving it freedom to exploit Giorgi&#x27;s proposals. The 8th CGPM (1933) resolved to work with other international bodies to agree to standards for electrical units that could be related back to the international prototypes. This was agreed in principle by the International Electrotechnical Commission at its congress in Brussels in 1935 subject to the choice of the fourth unit being agreed with, amongst others, the appropriate consultative committee of the CIPM.

In 1948, three years after the end of World War II and fifteen years after the 8th CGPM, the 9th CGPM was convened. In response to formal requests made by the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics and by the French Government to establish a practical system of units of measure, the CGPM requested the CIPM to prepare recommendations for a single practical system of units of measurement, suitable for adoption by all countries adhering to the Metre Convention. At the same time the CGPM formally adopted a recommendation for the writing and printing of unit symbols and of numbers. The recommendation also catalogued the recommended symbols for the most important MKS and CGS units of measure and for the first time the CGPM made recommendations concerning derived units.

The CIPM&#x27;s draft proposal, which was an extensive revision and simplification of the metric unit definitions, symbols and terminology based on the MKS system of units, was put to the 10th CGPM in 1954. In the proposal the CIPM recommended that the ampere be the base unit from which electromechanical standards would be derived. After negotiations with the CIS and IUPAP, two further base units, the degree kelvin and the candela were also proposed as base units. The full system and name &quot;Système international d&#x27;unités&quot; were adopted at the 11th CGPM. During the years that followed the definitions of the base units and particularly the to realize these definitions have been refined.

The formal definition of International System of Units (SI) along with the associated resolutions passed by the CGPM and the CIPM are published by the BIPM on the Internet and in brochure form at regular intervals. The eighth edition of the brochure &quot;Le Système international d&#x27;unités – The International System of Units&quot; was published in 2006.

=== Mutual Recognition Arrangements (CIPM-MRA) ===

During the 1940s, the United States government recognized the benefits of its suppliers keeping quality control records in respect of manufactured goods that would provide traceability of the process. This process was formalized by the British Government and in 1979 as the quality control standard BS 5750. In 1987 BS 5750 was adopted by ISO as the basis for ISO 9000. ISO 9000 is a general purpose quality control standard which works in conjunction industry-specific standards: for example ISO 15195:2003 which gives the specific requirements for reference measurement laboratories in laboratory medicine.

International trade is hampered by one country not recognising the quality controls in place in other countries – often due to standards being different or being incompatible with each other. At the 20th CGPM (1995), it was recognized that although ad-hoc recognition of instrument calibration between cooperating countries had been taking place for a hundred years, a need had arisen for a more comprehensive agreement. Consequently, the CIPM was mandated to investigate the setting up of a Mutual Recognition Agreement in respect of instrument calibration. Any such agreement would require the keeping of records that could demonstrate the traceability of calibrations back to the base standards. Such records would be recorded within an ISO 9000 framework. Four years later, in 1999 the text of the CIPM-MRA was agreed at the 21st CGPM.

The CIPM-MRA scheme is to catalogue the capabilities of National Measurement Institutes (NMIs) such as NIST in the United States or the National Physical Laboratory in Britain whose calibration procedures have been peer-assessed. The essential points of CIPM-MRA are:
* The agreement is only open to countries that have signed the Metre Convention, either as full or as associate members.
* A country may have more than one NMI, though only one NMI is chosen as the signatory organization.
* The measurement capabilities of NMIs will be peer-reviewed at regular intervals and each NMI will recognize the measurement capabilities of other NMIs.
* The BIPM maintains a publicly available database of the measurement capabilities of each NMI.
* NMIs

Subsequent to launch of the CIPM MRA and in response to a European Community directive on medical devices, the Joint Committee for Traceability in Laboratory Medicine (JCTLM) was created in 2002 through a Declaration of Cooperation between the International Committee of Weights and Measures (CIPM), the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC), and the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC). The joint committee provides a forum for the harmonization of standards of the various participants.

=== Coordination of International Atomic Time ===
With the advent of the atomic clock it has been possible to define and measure International Atomic Time with sufficient precision that variations in the Earth&#x27;s rotation can be detected. The International Earth Rotation Service monitors these changes relative to the stars at regular intervals and proposes leap seconds as and when these are needed. Currently there are over 200 atomic clocks in over 50 national laboratories around the world and the BIPM, in terms of the mandate given to it under the Metre Convention, coordinates the various atomic clocks.

=== New SI ===
After 1960, when the definition of the metre was linked to a particular wavelength of light rather than the international prototype of the metre, the only unit of measure that remained dependent on a particular artefact was the kilogram. Over the years, small drifts which could be as high as kilograms per annum in the mass of the international prototype of the kilogram were detected. At the 21st meeting of the CGPM (1999), national laboratories were urged to investigate ways of breaking the link between the kilogram and a specific artefact.

Independently of this drift having been identified, the Avogadro project and development of the Kibble (or watt) balance promised methods of indirectly measuring mass with a very high precision. These projects provided tools that enabled alternative means of redefining the kilogram.

A report published in 2007 by the Consultative Committee for Thermometry to the CIPM noted that their definition of temperature had proved to be unsatisfactory for temperatures below 20 K and for temperatures above 1300 K. The committee was of the view that the Boltzmann constant provided a better basis for temperature measurement than did the triple point of water, as it overcame these difficulties.

Over the next few years the support for natural constants grew and details were clarified, until in November 2018, the 26th General Conference on Weights and Measures voted unanimously in favour of revised definitions of the SI base units. The 2019 revision of the SI came into force on the 144th anniversary of the convention, 20 May 2019.
== Membership ==
The BIPM has two classes of adherents – full membership for those states that wish to participate in the activities of the BIPM and associate membership for those countries or economies that only wish to participate in the MRA programme. Associate members have observer status at the CGPM. Since all formal liaison between the convention organizations and national governments is handled by the member state&#x27;s ambassador to France, it is implicit that member states must have diplomatic relations with France, though during both world wars, nations that were at war with France retained their membership of the CGPM. The opening session of each CGPM is chaired by the French foreign minister and subsequent sessions by the president of the French Academy of Sciences.

On 20 May 1875 representatives from seventeen of countries that attended the Conference of the Metre in 1875, signed the Convention of the Metre. In April 1884 HJ Chaney, Warden of Standards in London unofficially contacted the BIPM inquiring whether the BIPM would calibrate some metre standards that had been manufactured in Britain. Broch, director of the BIPM replied that he was not authorized to perform any such calibrations for non-member states. On 17 September 1884, the British Government signed the convention. This number grew to 21 in 1900, 32 in 1950, and 49 in 2001. , the General Conference membership was made up of 64 member states, 37 associate states and economies and four international organizations as follows (with year of partnership between brackets):

=== Member states ===
===Associates===
At its 21st meeting (October 1999), the CGPM created the category of &quot;associate&quot; for those states not yet members of the BIPM and for economic unions.
=== International organizations ===

<doc id="20668" wikidata="Q20484" url="?curid=20668" title="MAC address">
<text>A MAC address (short for medium access control address or media access control address) is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for use as a network address in communications within a network segment. This use is common in most IEEE 802 networking technologies, including Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. Within the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) network model, MAC addresses are used in the medium access control protocol sublayer of the data link layer. As typically represented, MAC addresses are recognizable as six groups of two hexadecimal digits, separated by hyphens, colons, or without a separator.

MAC addresses are primarily assigned by device manufacturers, and are therefore often referred to as the burned-in address, or as an Ethernet hardware address, hardware address, or physical address. Each address can be stored in the interface hardware, such as its read-only memory, or by a firmware mechanism. Many network interfaces, however, support changing their MAC addresses. The address typically includes a manufacturer&#x27;s organizationally unique identifier (OUI). MAC addresses are formed according to the principles of two numbering spaces based on extended unique identifiers (EUIs) managed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE): EUI-48—which replaces the obsolete term MAC-48—and EUI-64.

Network nodes with multiple network interfaces, such as routers and multilayer switches, must have a unique MAC address for each network interface in the same network. However, two network interfaces connected to two different networks can share the same MAC address.

==Address details==
The IEEE 802 MAC address originally comes from the Xerox Network Systems Ethernet addressing scheme. This 48-bit address space contains potentially 248 (over 281 trillion) possible MAC addresses. The IEEE manages the allocation of MAC addresses, originally known as MAC-48 and now called EUI-48 identifiers. The IEEE has a target lifetime of 100 years (until 2080) for applications using EUI-48 space and restricts applications accordingly. The IEEE encourages adoption of the more plentiful EUI-64 for non-Ethernet applications.

The distinctions between EUI-48 and MAC-48 identifiers are in name and application only. MAC-48 was used to address hardware interfaces within existing 802-based networking applications; EUI-48 is now used for 802-based networking and is also used to identify other devices and software, for example Bluetooth. The IEEE now considers &quot;MAC-48&quot; to be an obsolete term. &quot;EUI-48&quot; is now used in all cases. In addition, the EUI-64 numbering system originally encompassed both MAC-48 and EUI-48 identifiers by a simple translation mechanism. These translations have since been deprecated.

The Individual Address Block (IAB) is an inactive registry which has been replaced by the &quot;MA-S&quot; (&quot;MAC address block, small&quot;), previously named &quot;OUI-36&quot;, and has no overlaps in addresses with the IAB registry product as of January 1, 2014. The IAB uses an OUI from the &quot;MA-L&quot; (&quot;MAC address block, large&quot;) registry, previously called the &quot;OUI&quot; registry. The term &quot;OUI&quot; is still in use, but the IEEE Registration Authority does not administer them. An OUI is concatenated with 12 additional IEEE-provided bits (for a total of 36 bits), leaving only 12 bits for the organisation owning the IAB to assign to its (up to 4096) individual devices. An IAB is ideal for organizations requiring not more than 4096 unique 48-bit numbers (EUI-48). Unlike an OUI, which allows the assignee to assign values in various number spaces (for example, EUI-48, EUI-64, and the various context-dependent identifier number spaces, as in SNAP or EDID), the Individual Address Block could only be used to assign EUI-48 identifiers. All other potential uses based on the OUI from which the IABs are allocated are reserved and remain the property of the IEEE Registration Authority. Between 2007 and September 2012, the OUI value 00:50:C2 was used for IAB assignments. After September 2012, the value 40:D8:55 was used. Owners of an already assigned IAB may continue to use it.

The MA-S registry includes, for each registrant, both a 36-bit unique number used in some standards and a block of EUI-48 and EUI-64 identifiers (while the registrant of an IAB cannot assign an EUI-64). MA-S does not include assignment of an OUI.

Additionally, the &quot;MA-M&quot; (&quot;MAC address block, medium&quot;) provides both 220 EUI-48 identifiers and 236 EUI-64 identifiers, the first 28 bits being assigned by IEEE. The first 24 bits of the assigned MA-M block are an OUI assigned to IEEE that will not be reassigned, so the MA-M does not include assignment of an OUI.

===Universal vs. local (U/L bit)===

Addresses can either be universally administered addresses (UAA) or locally administered addresses (LAA). A universally administered address is uniquely assigned to a device by its manufacturer. The first three octets (in transmission order) identify the organization that issued the identifier and are known as the organizationally unique identifier (OUI). The remainder of the address (three octets in EUI-48 or five in EUI-64) are assigned by that organization in nearly any manner they please, subject to the constraint of uniqueness. A locally administered address is assigned to a device by software or a network administrator, overriding the burned-in address of a physical device.

Locally administered addresses are distinguished from universally administered addresses by setting (assigning the value of 1 to) the second-least-significant bit of the first octet of the address. This bit is also referred to as the &quot;U/L&quot; bit, short for &quot;Universal/Local&quot;, which identifies how the address is administered. If the bit is 0, the address is universally administered, which is why this bit is 0 in all UAAs. If it is 1, the address is locally administered. In the example address , the first octet is 06 (hexadecimal), the binary form of which is 00000110, where the second-least-significant bit is 1. Therefore, it is a locally administered address. Even though many hypervisors manage dynamic MAC addresses within their own OUI, often it is useful to create an entire unique MAC within the LAA range.

==== Universal addresses that are administered locally ====

In virtualisation, hypervisors such as QEMU and Xen have their own OUIs. Each new virtual machine is started with a MAC address set by assigning the last three bytes to be unique on the local network. While this is local administration of MAC addresses, it is not an LAA in the IEEE sense.

A historical example of this hybrid situation is the DECnet protocol, where the universal MAC address (with Digital Equipment Corporation&#x27;s OUI AA-00-04) is administered locally. The DECnet software sets the last three bytes of the complete MAC address to (so that the full MAC address is ), where reflects the host&#x27;s DECnet network address &quot;xx.yy&quot;. This eliminates the need for DECnet to have an address resolution protocol since the MAC address of any DECnet host can be determined from its DECnet address.

===Unicast vs. multicast (I/G bit)===

The least significant bit of an address&#x27;s first octet is referred to as the &quot;I/G&quot;, or &quot;Individual/Group&quot;, bit. When this bit is 0 (zero), the frame is meant to reach only one receiving network interface. This type of transmission is called unicast. A unicast frame is transmitted to all nodes within the collision domain. In a modern wired setting (i.e. with &quot;switches&quot;, not simple &quot;hubs&quot;) the collision domain usually is the length of the Ethernet cabling between two network interfaces. In a wireless setting, the collision domain is all receivers that can detect a given wireless signal. If a switch does not know which port leads to a given MAC address, the switch will forward a unicast frame to all of its ports (except the originating port), an action known as unicast flood. Only the node with the matching hardware MAC address will (normally) accept the frame; network interfaces with non-matching MAC-addresses ignore the frame unless they are in promiscuous mode.

If the least significant bit of the first octet is set to 1 (i.e. the second hexadecimal digit is odd) the frame will still be sent only once; however, network interface controllers will choose to accept or ignore it based on criteria other than the matching of their individual MAC addresses: for example, based on a configurable list of accepted multicast MAC addresses. This is called multicast addressing.

The IEEE has built in several special address types to allow more than one network interface card to be addressed at one time:
* Packets sent to the broadcast address, all one bits, are received by all stations on a local area network. In hexadecimal the broadcast address would be . A broadcast frame is flooded and is forwarded to and accepted by all other nodes.
* Packets sent to a multicast address are received by all stations on a LAN that have been configured to receive packets sent to that address.
* Functional addresses identify one or more Token Ring NICs that provide a particular service, defined in IEEE 802.5.

These are all examples of &quot;group addresses&quot;, as opposed to &quot;individual addresses&quot;; the least significant bit of the first octet of a MAC address distinguishes individual addresses from group addresses. That bit is set to 0 in individual addresses and set to 1 in group addresses. Group addresses, like individual addresses, can be universally administered or locally administered.

===Ranges of group and locally administered addresses===

The U/L and I/G bits are handled independently, and there are instances of all four possibilities. IPv6 multicast uses locally administered, multicast MAC addresses in the range (with both bits set).

Given the locations of the U/L and I/G bits, they can be discerned in a single digit in common MAC address notation as shown in the following table:

===IEEE 802c local MAC address usage===

IEEE standard 802c further divides the locally administered MAC address block into four quadrants. This additional partitioning is called Structured Local Address Plan (SLAP) and its usage is optional.

==Applications==
The following network technologies use the EUI-48 identifier format:
* IEEE 802 networks
** Ethernet
** 802.11 wireless networks (Wi-Fi)
** Bluetooth
** IEEE 802.5 Token Ring
* Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI)
* Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), switched virtual connections only, as part of an NSAP address
* Fibre Channel and Serial Attached SCSI (as part of a World Wide Name)
* The ITU-T G.hn standard, which provides a way to create a high-speed (up to 1 gigabit/s) local area network using existing home wiring (power lines, phone lines and coaxial cables). The G.hn Application Protocol Convergence (APC) layer accepts Ethernet frames that use the EUI-48 format and encapsulates them into G.hn Medium Access Control Service Data Units (MSDUs).

Every device that connects to an IEEE 802 network (such as Ethernet and Wi-Fi) has an EUI-48 address. Common networked consumer devices such as PCs, smartphones and tablet computers use EUI-48 addresses.

EUI-64 identifiers are used in:
* IEEE 1394 (FireWire)
* InfiniBand
* IPv6 (Modified EUI-64 as the least-significant 64 bits of a unicast network address or link-local address when stateless address autoconfiguration is used.) IPv6 uses a &quot;modified EUI-64&quot;, treats MAC-48 as EUI-48 instead (as it is chosen from the same address pool) and inverts the local bit. This results in extending MAC addresses (such as IEEE 802 MAC address) to modified EUI-64 using only (and never ) and with the local bit inverted.
* Zigbee / 802.15.4 / 6LoWPAN wireless personal-area networks
* IEEE 11073-20601 (IEEE 11073-20601 compliant medical devices)

==Use in hosts==
On broadcast networks, such as Ethernet, the MAC address is expected to uniquely identify each node on that segment and allows frames to be marked for specific hosts. It thus forms the basis of most of the link layer (OSI layer 2) networking upon which upper-layer protocols rely to produce complex, functioning networks.

Many network interfaces support changing their MAC address. On most Unix-like systems, the command utility ifconfig may be used to remove and add link address aliases. For instance, the &quot;active&quot; ifconfig directive may be used on NetBSD to specify which of the attached addresses to activate. Hence, various configuration scripts and utilities permit the randomization of the MAC address at the time of booting or before establishing a network connection.

Changing MAC addresses is necessary in network virtualization. In MAC spoofing, this is practiced in exploiting security vulnerabilities of a computer system. Some modern operating systems, such as Apple iOS and Android, especially in mobile devices, are designed to assign a random MAC address to their network interface when scanning for wireless access points to avert tracking systems.

In Internet Protocol (IP) networks, the MAC address of an interface corresponding to an IP address may be queried with the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) for IPv4 and the Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) for IPv6. Thus ARP and NDP relate OSI layer 3 addresses to layer 2 addresses.

===Tracking===
====Randomization====
According to Edward Snowden, the US National Security Agency has a system that tracks the movements of mobile devices in a city by monitoring MAC addresses. To avert this practice, Apple started using random MAC addresses in iOS devices while scanning for networks. Other vendors quickly followed suit. MAC address randomization during scanning was added in Android starting from version 6.0, in Windows 10, and in Linux 3.18. The actual implementations of the MAC address randomization technique vary largely in different devices. Moreover, various flaws and shortcomings in these implementations may allow an attacker to track a device even if its MAC address is changed, for instance its probe requests&#x27; other elements, or their timing. If random MAC addresses are not used, researchers have confirmed that it is possible to link a real identity to a particular wireless MAC address.

Randomized MAC addresses can be identified by the &quot;locally administered&quot; bit described above.

====Other information leakage====
Using wireless access points in SSID-hidden mode (network cloaking), a mobile wireless device may not only disclose its own MAC address when traveling, but even the MAC addresses associated to SSIDs the device has already connected to, if they are configured to send these as part of probe request packets. Alternative modes to prevent this include configuring access points to be either in beacon-broadcasting mode or probe-response with SSID mode. In these modes, probe requests may be unnecessary or sent in broadcast mode without disclosing the identity of previously known networks.

===Anonymization===
==Notational conventions==
The standard (IEEE 802) format for printing EUI-48 addresses in human-friendly form is six groups of two hexadecimal digits, separated by hyphens () in transmission order (e.g. ). This form is also commonly used for EUI-64 (e.g. ). Other conventions include six groups of two hexadecimal digits separated by colons (:) (e.g. ), and three groups of four hexadecimal digits separated by dots (.) (e.g. ); again in transmission order.

===Bit-reversed notation===
The standard notation, also called canonical format, for MAC addresses is written in transmission order with the least significant bit of each byte transmitted first, and is used in the output of the codice_1, codice_2, and codice_3 commands, for example.

However, since IEEE 802.3 (Ethernet) and IEEE 802.4 (Token Bus) send the bytes (octets) over the wire, left-to-right, with the least significant bit in each byte first, while IEEE 802.5 (Token Ring) and IEEE 802.6 (FDDI) send the bytes over the wire with the most significant bit first, confusion may arise when an address in the latter scenario is represented with bits reversed from the canonical representation. For example, an address in canonical form would be transmitted over the wire as bits codice_4 in the standard transmission order (least significant bit first). But for Token Ring networks, it would be transmitted as bits codice_5 in most-significant-bit first order. The latter might be incorrectly displayed as . This is referred to as &quot;bit-reversed order&quot;, &quot;non-canonical form&quot;, &quot;MSB format&quot;, &quot;IBM format&quot;, or &quot;Token Ring format&quot;.

<doc id="20669" wikidata="Q39571" url="?curid=20669" title="My Neighbor Totoro">
<text>is a 1988 Japanese animated fantasy film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki and animated by Studio Ghibli for Tokuma Shoten. It stars the voices of Noriko Hidaka, Chika Sakamoto and Hitoshi Takagi, and focuses on two young sisters and their interactions with friendly wood spirits in postwar rural Japan.

The film explores themes such as animism, Shinto symbology, environmentalism and the joys of rural living. &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; received worldwide critical acclaim, and grossed over worldwide at the box office as of September 2019; the film also grossed significantly more from home video sales and merchandise.

&quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; received numerous awards, including the Animage Anime Grand Prix prize, the Mainichi Film Award, and Kinema Junpo Award for Best Film in 1988. It also received the Special Award at the Blue Ribbon Awards in the same year. The film is considered as one of the top animation films, ranking 41st in &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Best Films of World Cinema&quot; in 2010 and the number-one animated film on the 2012 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; critics&#x27; poll of all-time greatest films. The film and its titular character have become cultural icons, and made multiple cameo appearances in other films. Totoro also serves as the mascot for Studio Ghibli and is recognized as one of the most popular characters in Japanese animation.

== Plot ==
In 1950s Japan, university professor Tatsuo Kusakabe and his daughters Satsuki and Mei (approximately ten and four years old, respectively) move into an old house close to the hospital where the girls&#x27; mother, Yasuko, is recovering from a long-term illness. The house is inhabited by small, dark, dust-like house spirits called &quot;susuwatari&quot;, that can be seen when moving from bright places to dark ones. The &quot;susuwatari&quot; leave to find another empty house. Mei discovers two small spirits that lead her into the hollow of a large camphor tree. She befriends a larger spirit, which identifies itself using a series of roars that she interprets as &quot;Totoro&quot;. Mei thinks Totoro is the troll from her illustrated book &quot;Three Billy Goats Gruff&quot;. She falls asleep atop Totoro but when Satsuki finds her, she is on the ground. Despite many attempts, Mei cannot show her family Totoro&#x27;s tree. Tatsuo comforts her, saying Totoro will reveal himself when he wants to.

The girls wait for Tatsuo&#x27;s bus, which is late. Mei falls asleep on Satsuki&#x27;s back and Totoro appears beside them, allowing Satsuki to see him for the first time. Totoro has only a leaf on his head for protection against the rain, prompting Satsuki to offer her umbrella to him. Delighted, he gives her a bundle of nuts and seeds in return. A giant, bus-shaped cat arrives; Totoro boards it and leaves. A few days after planting the seeds, the girls awaken at midnight to find Totoro and his fellow spirits engaged in a ceremonial dance around the planted seeds. They join in, causing the seeds to grow into an enormous tree. Totoro takes the girls for a ride on a magical flying top. In the morning, the tree is gone but the seeds have sprouted.

The girls discover that a planned visit by their mother has been postponed because of a setback in her treatment. Mei is upset and argues with Satsuki. She leaves for the hospital to take fresh corn to their mother, but gets lost on the way. Mei&#x27;s disappearance prompts Satsuki and the neighbors to search for her, thinking that Mei has died. In desperation, Satsuki pleads for Totoro&#x27;s help. Totoro summons the Catbus, which carries Satsuki to Mei&#x27;s location, and the sisters reunite. The bus then takes them to the hospital, where the girls learn that their mother has been kept in the hospital by a minor cold but is otherwise recovering well. The girls secretly leave the ear of corn on the windowsill, where their parents discover it.

Eventually, their mother returns home and the girls play with other children while Totoro and his friends watch from afar.

== Themes ==
Animism is a major theme in &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot;, according to Eriko Ogihara-Schuck. Totoro has animistic traits and has status because he lives in a camphor tree in a Shinto shrine surrounded by a Shinto rope, and he is referred to as (master of the forest). Ogihara-Schuck writes that when Mei returns from her encounter with Totoro, her father takes Mei and her sister to the shrine to greet and thank Totoro. This is a common practice in the Shinto tradition following an encounter with a . According to Phillip E. Wegner, the film is an example of alternative history, citing the utopian-like setting of the anime.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
After working on &quot;3000 Miles in Search of a Mother&quot;, Miyazaki wanted to make a &quot;delightful, wonderful film&quot; that would be set in Japan with the idea to &quot;entertain and touch its viewers, but stay with them long after they have left the theaters&quot;. Initially, Miyazaki had the main characters Totoro, Mei, Tatsuo, and Kanta. The director based Mei on his niece, and Totoros as &quot;serene, carefree creatures&quot; that were &quot;supposedly the forest keeper, but that&#x27;s only a half-baked idea, a rough approximation&quot;.

Art director Kazuo Oga was drawn to the film when Hayao Miyazaki showed him an original image of Totoro standing in a &quot;satoyama&quot;. Miyazaki challenged Oga to raise his standards, and Oga&#x27;s experience with &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; began Oga&#x27;s career. Oga and Miyazaki debated the film&#x27;s color palette; Oga wanted to paint black soil from Akita Prefecture and Miyazaki preferred the color of red soil from Kantō region. The finished film was described by Studio Ghibli producer Toshio Suzuki; &quot;It was nature painted with translucent colors&quot;.

Oga&#x27;s conscientious approach to &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; was a style the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot; recognized as &quot;[updating] the traditional Japanese animist sense of a natural world that is fully, spiritually alive&quot;. The newspaper said of the film:
Oga&#x27;s work on &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; led to his continued involvement with Studio Ghibli, which assigned him jobs that would play to his strengths, and Oga&#x27;s style became a trademark style of Studio Ghibli.

Only one young girl, rather than two sisters, is depicted in several of Miyazaki&#x27;s initial conceptual watercolor paintings, as well as on the theatrical release poster and on later home-video releases. According to Miyazaki; &quot;If she was a little girl who plays around in the yard, she wouldn&#x27;t be meeting her father at a bus stop, so we had to come up with two girls instead. And that was difficult.&quot; Miyazaki said the film&#x27;s opening sequence was not storyboarded; &quot;The sequence was determined through permutations and combinations determined by the time sheets. Each element was made individually and combined in the time sheets ...&quot; The ending sequence depicts the mother&#x27;s return home and the signs of her return to good health by playing with Satsuki and Mei outside.

Miyazaki stated that the story was initially intended to be set in 1955, however, the team was not thorough in the research and instead worked on a setting &quot;in the recent past&quot;. The film was originally set to be an hour long but during production it grew to respond to the social context, including the reason for the move and the father&#x27;s occupation. Eight animators worked on the film, which was completed in eight months.

Tetsuya Endo noted numerous animation techniques were used in the film. For example, ripples were designed with &quot;two colors of high-lighting and shading&quot; and the rain for &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; was &quot;scratched in the cels&quot; and superimposed for it to convey a soft feel. The animators stated one month was taken to create the tadpoles, which included four colors; the water for it was also blurred.

=== Music ===
The music for &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; was composed by Joe Hisaishi, who previously collaborated with Miyazaki on the movies &quot;Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind&quot; and &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot;. Hisaishi was inspired by the contemporary composers Terry Riley, Philip Glass, Steve Reich, Karlheinz Stockhausen, and John Cage, and described Miyazaki&#x27;s films as &quot;rich and personally compeling&quot;. He hired an orchestra for the soundtrack and primarily used a Fairlight instrument.

The soundtrack for &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; was first released in Japan on May 1, 1988, by Tokuma Shoten, and includes the musical score used in the film, except for five vocal pieces that were performed by Azumi Inoue, including &quot;Stroll&quot;, &quot;A Lost Child&quot;, and &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot;. It had previously been released as an Image Song CD in 1987 that contains some songs that were not included in the film. 
== Release ==
After writing and filming &quot;Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind&quot; (1984) and &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot; (1986), Hayao Miyazaki began directing &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; for Studio Ghibli. Miyazaki&#x27;s production paralleled his colleague Isao Takahata&#x27;s production of &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot;. Miyazaki&#x27;s film was financed by executive producer Yasuyoshi Tokuma, and both &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; and &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot; were released on the same bill in 1988. The dual billing was considered &quot;one of the most moving and remarkable double bills ever offered to a cinema audience&quot;.

=== Box office ===
In Japan, &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; initially sold 801,680 tickets and earned a distribution rental income of in 1988. According to the animation scholar Seiji Kano, by 2005, the film&#x27;s box-office gross receipts in Japan totalled (). In France, the film has sold 429,822 tickets since 1999. The film has been internationally released several times since 2002. The film has grossed $30,476,708 worldwide since 2002. A &quot;South China Morning Post&quot; article in 2021 reported that the film has grossed more than $41 million in total.

Thirty years after its original release in Japan, &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; received a Chinese theatrical release in December 2018. The delay was due to long-standing political tensions between China and Japan but many Chinese people had become familiar with Miyazaki&#x27;s films due to rampant video piracy. In its opening weekend, ending December 16, 2018, &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; grossed , entering the box-office charts at number two behind Hollywood film &quot;Aquaman&quot; and ahead of Bollywood film &quot;Padman&quot; at number three. By its second weekend, &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; had grossed in China. As of February 2019, it had grossed $25,798,550 in China.

=== English dubs ===
In 1989, US-based company Streamline Pictures produced an exclusive English language dub of &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; for use as an in-flight movie on Japan Airlines flights. In April 1993, Troma Films, under its label 50th St. Films, distributed the dub of the film as a theatrical release. The songs for the Streamline version of &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; were sung by Cassie Byram.

In 2004, Walt Disney Pictures produced a new English dub of &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; to be released after the rights to the Streamline dub had expired. As is the case with Disney&#x27;s other English dubs of Miyazaki films, the Disney version of &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; has a star-heavy cast, including Dakota and Elle Fanning as Satsuki and Mei, Timothy Daly as Mr. Kusakabe, Pat Carroll as Granny, Lea Salonga as Mrs. Kusakabe, and Frank Welker as Totoro and Catbus. The songs for the new dub retain the translation as the earlier dub but are sung by Sonya Isaacs. The Disney dub was directed by Rick Dempsey, a Disney executive in charge of the company&#x27;s dubbing services, and was written by Don and Cindy Hewitt, who had written other dubs for Studio Ghibli.

Disney&#x27;s English-language dub premiered on October 23, 2005; it was screened at the 2005 Hollywood Film Festival. The cable television network Turner Classic Movies (TCM) held the television premiere of Disney&#x27;s new English dub in January 2006, as part of the network&#x27;s tribute to Hayao Miyazaki. TCM aired the dub and the original Japanese film with English subtitles. The Disney version was released on DVD in the United States on March 7, 2006. In Australia, the original English dub was also released by Madman Entertainment on March 15, 2006.

In 2023, the film was re-released in 970 United States locations as part of celebrations to mark the 35th anniversary of its first theatrical release, with showings in both Japanese with English subtitles and with the English dub.

The company reissued &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot;, as well as &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot;, and &quot;Kiki&#x27;s Delivery Service&quot;, with updated cover art highlighting its Studio Ghibli origins, on March 2, 2010, coinciding with the US DVD and Blu-ray debut of &quot;Ponyo&quot;. &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; was re-released by Disney on Blu-Ray on May 21, 2013.

&quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; received widespread acclaim from film critics. 

In 2001, Japanese magazine &quot;Animage&quot; ranked &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; 45th in its list of &quot;100 Best Anime Productions of All Time&quot;. &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; was voted the highest-ranking animated film on &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; critics&#x27; poll of all-time greatest films, and joint 154th overall. In 2022, the magazine ranked the film as the joint-72nd-greatest film overall, being one of two animated films included in the list. &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; was ranked third on the list of &quot;Greatest Japanese Animated Films of All Time&quot; by film magazine &quot;Kinema Junpo&quot; in 2009, 41st in &quot;Empire magazine&#x27;s&quot; &quot;The 100 Best Films of World Cinema&quot; in 2010, second on a similar &quot;Empire&quot; list of best children&#x27;s films, and number one in the greatest animated films in &quot;Time Out&quot;; a similar list by the editors ranked the film in third place.

Film critic Roger Ebert of &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; identified &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; as one of his &quot;Great Movies&quot;, calling it &quot;one of the lovingly hand-crafted works of Hayao Miyazaki&quot;. In his review, Ebert said the film &quot;is based on experience, situation and exploration—not on conflict and threat&quot;, and added:
it would never have won its worldwide audience just because of its warm heart. It is also rich with human comedy in the way it observes the two remarkably convincing, lifelike little girls ... It is a little sad, a little scary, a little surprising and a little informative, just like life itself. It depends on a situation instead of a plot, and suggests that the wonder of life and the resources of imagination supply all the adventure you need.

Steve Rose from &quot;The Guardian&quot; gave the film five stars, praising Miyazaki&#x27;s &quot;rich, bright, hand-drawn&quot; animation and describing it as &quot;full of benign spirituality, prelapsarian innocence and joyous discovery, all rooted in a carefully detailed reality&quot;. Trevor Johnston from &quot;Time Out&quot; also awarded the film five stars, commenting on its &quot;delicate rendering of the atmosphere&quot; and its first half that &quot;delicately captures both mystery and quietness&quot;. Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa cited &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; as one of his favorite films. Writing for the &quot;London Evening Standard&quot;, Charlotte O&#x27;Sullivan praised the charm of the film but said it lacks complexity in comparison with &quot;Spirited Away&quot;. Jordan Cronk from &quot;Slant&quot; awarded the film three-and-a-half stars but said it is &quot;devoid of much of the fantasia of Miyazaki&#x27;s more outwardly visionary work&quot;. In the 1996 movie guide &quot;Seen That, Now What?&quot;, &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; was given the rating of &quot;A&quot;. The guide stated that the film is an &quot;enchanting, lushly animated view of the natural world with child&#x27;s sense of wonder&quot;, and noting its suitability for young children while being &quot;a perennial favorite among [film buffs]&quot;.

The 1993 translation was not as well-received as the 2006 translation; Leonard Klady of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote the 1993 translation demonstrates &quot;adequate television technical craft&quot; that is characterized by &quot;muted pastels, homogenized pictorial style and [a] vapid storyline&quot;. Klady described the film&#x27;s environment as &quot;obviously aimed at an international audience&quot; but &quot;evinces a disorienting combination of cultures that produces a nowhere land more confused than fascinating&quot;. Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the 1993 translation as &quot;very visually handsome&quot;, and said the film is &quot;very charming&quot; when &quot;dispensing enchantment&quot;. Despite the highlights, Holden wrote &quot;too much of the film, however, is taken up with stiff, mechanical chitchat&quot;.

Matthew Leyland of &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; reviewed the DVD released in 2006, commenting; &quot;Miyazaki&#x27;s family fable is remarkably light on tension, conflict and plot twists, yet it beguiles from beginning to end ... what sticks with the viewer is the every-kid credibility of the girls&#x27; actions as they work, play and settle into their new surroundings&quot;. Leyland praised the DVD transfer of the film but noted the disc lacks a look at the film&#x27;s production, instead being overabundant with storyboards. Writing in &quot;Joe Hisaishi&#x27;s Soundtrack for My Neighbor Totoro&quot;, Kunio Hara praised the soundtrack, describing the song &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; as a &quot;sonic icon&quot; of the film. Hara also commented the music &quot;arouse[s] a similar sentiment of yearning for the past&quot;.

== Awards and nominations ==
== Legacy ==
&quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; was considered a milestone for writer-director Hayao Miyazaki. The popularity of the film&#x27;s central character Totoro among Japanese children has been likened to that of Winnie-the-Pooh in Britain. &quot;The Independent&quot; said Totoro is one of the greatest cartoon characters, describing the creature; &quot;At once innocent and awe-inspiring, King Totoro captures the innocence and magic of childhood more than any of Miyazaki&#x27;s other magical creations&quot;. The &quot;Financial Times&quot; recognized the character&#x27;s appeal, commenting Totoro &quot;is more genuinely loved than Mickey Mouse could hope to be in his wildest—not nearly so beautifully illustrated—fantasies&quot;. &quot;Empire&quot; also commented on Totoro&#x27;s appeal, ranking him at number 18 on a list of the greatest animated characters of all time.

The character of Totoro later became a mascot and official logo for Studio Ghibli.

According to the environmental journal &quot;Ambio&quot;, &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; &quot;has served as a powerful force to focus the positive feelings that the Japanese people have for and traditional village life&quot;. The film&#x27;s central character Totoro was used as a mascot by the Japanese campaign &quot;Totoro Hometown Fund Campaign&quot;, which aimed to preserve areas of in Saitama Prefecture. The fund, started in 1990 after the film&#x27;s release, held an auction in August 2008 at Pixar Animation Studios to sell over 210 original paintings, illustrations, and sculptures inspired by &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot;.

Miyazaki additionally uses Totoro as a part of his logo for Studio Ghibli. Totoro also makes a cameo appearance in the Pixar film &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; (2010) but was not included in &quot;Toy Story 4&quot; due to licensing problems. &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; art director Daisuke Tsutsumi is married to Miyazaki&#x27;s niece, who inspired the character Mei in &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot;.

A main-belt asteroid that was discovered on December 31, 1994, was named 10160 Totoro. In 2013, &quot;Eoperipatus totoro&quot;, a species of velvet worm that was discovered in Vietnam, was named after Totoro. Following the request of the paper&#x27;s authors, the species was named for the character because he &quot;uses a many-legged animal as a vehicle, which according to the collectors resembles a velvet worm&quot;.

== Media ==
=== Books ===

In Japan in May 1988, Tokuma published a four-volume series of &quot;ani-manga&quot; books, which use color images and lines directly from &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot;. The series was licensed for English-language release in North America by Viz Media, which released the books from November 10, 2004, through February 15, 2005. A 111-page picture book based on the film and aimed at young children was released by Tokuma on June 28, 1988, and, in a 112-page English translation, by Viz on November 8, 2005. Tokuma later released another 176-page art book containing conceptual art from the film and interviews with production staff on July 15, 1988, and, in English translation, by Viz on November 8, 2005. In 2013, Viz released a hardcover light novel that was written by Tsugiko Kubo and illustrated by Hayao Miyazaki.

===Sequel ===
 is a thirteen-minute sequel to &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; that was written and directed by Miyazaki. Chika Sakamoto, who voiced Mei in &quot;Totoro&quot;, returned to voice Mei in this short. Hayao Miyazaki voiced Granny Cat (&quot;Neko Baa-chan&quot;) and Totoro. The sequel focuses on the character Mei Kusakabe from the original film and her one-night adventures with Kittenbus, the offspring of Catbus, and other cat-oriented vehicles. The sequel was first released in Japan in 2003 and is regularly shown at Ghibli Museum but has not been released on home video.

=== Merchandise ===
Licensed &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; merchandise of Totoro has been sold in Japan for decades after the film&#x27;s release. Sales of the film&#x27;s licensed merchandise in Japan grossed in 1999, during 20032007, at least in 2008, and during 20102012.

=== Stage adaptation ===

In May 2022, the Royal Shakespeare Company and composer Joe Hisaishi announced that a stage adaptation of the film titled &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; would run from 8 October 2022 to 21 January 2023 at the Barbican Centre in London. It was adapted by British playwright Tom Morton-Smith and directed by Improbable&#x27;s Phelim McDermott. Tickets went on sale on 19 May 2022, breaking the theater&#x27;s box-office record for sales in one day which was previously held by the 2015 production of &quot;Hamlet&quot; starring Benedict Cumberbatch. The show won six Olivier Awards.

On 30 March 2023, it was announced that the production will return to the Barbican for another season, which began on 21 November 2023 and ran until 23 March 2024.

<text>Maribor ( , , ; also known by other historical names) is the second-largest city in Slovenia and the largest city of the traditional region of Lower Styria. It is the seat of the Urban Municipality of Maribor and the Drava statistical region. Maribor is also the economic, administrative, educational, and cultural centre of eastern Slovenia.

Maribor was first mentioned as a castle in 1164, as a settlement in 1209, and as a city in 1254. Like most Slovene ethnic territory, Maribor was under Habsburg rule until 1918, when Rudolf Maister and his men secured the city for the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, which then joined the Kingdom of Serbia to form the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. In 1991 Maribor became part of independent Slovenia.

Maribor, along with the Portuguese city of Guimarães, was selected as the European Capital of Culture for 2012.

==Name==
Maribor was attested in historical sources as &quot;Marpurch&quot; (and later as &quot;Marchburch&quot;, &quot;Marburc&quot;, and &quot;Marchpurch&quot;), and is a compound of Middle High German &quot;march&quot; &#x27;march (borderland)&#x27; + &quot;burc&quot; &#x27;fortress&#x27;. In modern times, the town&#x27;s German name is &quot;Marburg an der Drau&quot; (; literally, &#x27;Marburg on the Drava&#x27;).

The Slovene name &quot;Maribor&quot; is an artificial Slovenized creation, coined by Stanko Vraz in 1836. Vraz created the name in the spirit of Illyrianism by analogy with the name &quot;Brandenburg&quot; (cf. Lower Sorbian &quot;Bramborska&quot;). Locally, the town was known in Slovene as &quot;Marprk&quot; or &quot;Marprog&quot;. The name &quot;Maribor&quot; was accepted among Slovenes in 1861, when Lovro Toman published a song named &quot;Mar i bor&quot;, giving the name a Slovene compound &quot;Mar&quot; (&#x27;to care&#x27;) + &quot;i&quot; (&#x27;and&#x27;) + &quot;bor&quot; (&#x27;to fight for&#x27;). In addition to its Slovene and German names, the city is also known as &quot;Marburgum&quot; in Latin and &quot;Marburgo&quot; in Italian.

==History==

===Prehistory===
The oldest known remnants of settlement in the Maribor area date back to the 5th millennium BC, at the time of the Chalcolithic. With the construction of Maribor&#x27;s western bypass, larger settlements were discovered dating from the 44th to 42nd century BC. Another settlement from around the same period was also discovered in Spodnje Hoče, a town right next to Maribor and another below Melje Hill near Malečnik. Another settlement below Melje Hill was also found dating to the 4th millennium BC.

A more intense period of settlement of the Maribor area occurred in the 3rd millennium BC with the advent of the Bronze Age. In the 13th to 12th century BC, in the age of the Urnfield culture, new settlements were found in Pekel. Around 1000 BC, new settlers moved to the Maribor area. An urnfield cemetery was found from that period in today&#x27;s &quot;Mladinska ulica&quot; and another necropolis was also found in Pobrežje.

=== Antiquity ===
With the Iron Age and the Hallstatt Culture, new settlements began to appear on hills. One of them was Poštela in the Pohorje Mountains. Poštela was an old town that was abandoned in the 6th century BC and inhabited again in the 2nd century BC.

During Roman times, the area where Maribor later developed was part of the province of Noricum, right on the border with Pannonia. During that period, Roman agricultural estates known as &quot;villae rusticae&quot; filled the area around Radvanje, Betnava, Bohova, and Hoče. The best-known of them was in today&#x27;s Borova Vas neighborhood of Maribor. An important trade route was also established in the area, connecting Celeia and Flavia Solva in one direction with Poetovio and central Noricum on the other.

=== Medieval history ===

After the fall of the Roman Empire, the Maribor area was settled by the Slavs.
A Slavic cemetery was found in Radvanje dating to the 10th century AD. The area of what later became Maribor was first part of Samo&#x27;s Empire and later the area stood on the border between Carantania and Lower Pannonia. In 843 the area was absorbed into the Frankish Empire.

In the Frankish Empire, the area again stood on the border, this time between the Frankish Empire and the Principality of Hungary. To protect the Frankish Empire from Hungarian raids, a castle was built on Pyramid Hill. The castle was mentioned for the first time on 20 October 1164 as &quot;Castrum Marchburch&quot;. A settlement soon began to grow below the castle. Maribor was first mentioned as a market near the castle in 1204, and it received town privileges in 1254. It is likely that the castle stood before 1164 because Bernard of Trixien, the count of the region, already used the title &quot;Bernhard von Marchpurg&quot; &#x27;Bernard of Maribor&#x27; in 1124.

The town began to grow rapidly after the victory of Rudolf I of the Habsburg dynasty over King Otakar II of Bohemia in 1278. The town built fortifications, and trade, viticulture, and crafts started to grow. The town had a monopoly over the entire region and also controlled the viticulture trade with Carinthia. The first churches were built, and also around this time the first Jews arrived. The Jews built their own ghetto in the southeastern part of town, where they also built the Maribor Synagogue. Most Slovenians lived in the northwestern part of town on what is now Slovenian Street (&quot;Slovenska ulica&quot;).

In 1478, a second castle was built on the northeastern side of the town, today known as Maribor Castle. In 1480 and in 1481, Matthias Corvinus besieged the town but failed to conquer it on both occasions. In 1496, Maximilian I issued a decree to expel all Jews from Maribor and Styria. In 1515, the Maribor Town Hall was built and a few years later, in 1532, Maribor again came under siege, this time by the Ottoman Empire. In the battle that became known as the Siege of Maribor, a 100,000-strong Ottoman army under the leadership of Suleiman the Magnificent attacked the town, which was defended only by the local garrison and its citizens. Despite all the odds, Maribor was defended and the legend of the Maribor shoemaker who raised the sluice gates and flooded the Ottoman army is still popular today.

===Modern period===
In the 17th century, numerous fires razed the town. The biggest ones occurred in 1601, 1645, 1648, and 1700. As a consequence, the town was rebuilt numerous times. In addition to fires, the plague decimated the town&#x27;s population. The largest plague epidemics occurred in 1646, 1664, and 1680. Due to the plague, the town lost 35 percent of its population. In gratitude for the end of the plague, a plague column was built in 1681, with the original being replaced in 1743. In 1846, the Southern Railway was built through the town, which resulted in great economic growth and territorial expansion. In 1859, Anton Martin Slomšek, a bishop of the Diocese of Lavant, transferred the seat of the diocese to Maribor, and he further encouraged the use of Slovene. With the transfer, Maribor also received its first higher school. Four years later, Maribor was connected with Carinthia with the construction of the railway from Maribor to Prevalje. The first daily Slovenian newspaper, called &quot;Slovenski narod&quot;, was established in 1868 on today&#x27;s Slomšek Square (&quot;Slomškov trg&quot;). On 4 April 1883, the first electric light in Slovene ethnic territory was installed on Castle Square (&quot;Grajski trg&quot;). The renowned electrical engineer Nikola Tesla lived in Maribor from 1878 to 1879, where he received his first job. Maribor National Hall was built in 1899, and it became a political, cultural, and economic centre for all Styrian Slovenes.
In 1900, the city itself had a population that was 82.3% Austrian German (19,298 people) and 17.3% Slovene (4,062 people; based on the language spoken at home); most of the city&#x27;s capital and public life was in Austrian German hands. However, the county excluding the city had only 10,199 Austrian Germans and 78,888 Slovene inhabitants, meaning the city was completely surrounded by majority-Slovene ethnic territory. Some former independent settlements that later became part of the city had more ethnic Slovenes than Austrian Germans (e.g., Krčevina, Radvanje, Tezno), whereas others had more Austrian Germans than ethnic Slovenes (e.g., Pobrežje and Studenci). In 1913, a new bridge was opened over the Drava River, today known as the Old Bridge. In World War I, the 47th Infantry Regiment of the Austro-Hungarian Army was based in the city and also fought on the Isonzo front. During the First World War many Slovenes in Carinthia and Styria were detained on suspicion of being enemies of the Austrian Empire. This led to distrust between Austrian Germans and Slovenes.

After the collapse of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire in 1918, Maribor was claimed by both the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs and German Austria. On 1 November 1918, a meeting was held by Colonel Anton Holik in the Melje barracks, where it was decided that the city would be part of German Austria. Ethnic Slovene Major Rudolf Maister, who was present at the meeting, denounced the decision and organised Slovenian military units that were able to seize control of the city. All Austrian officers and soldiers were disarmed and demobilised to the new state of German Austria. The German city council then held a secret meeting, where it was decided to do whatever possible to regain Maribor for German Austria. They organised a military unit called the Green Guard (&quot;Schutzwehr&quot;), and approximately 400 well-armed soldiers of this unit opposed the pro-Slovenian and pro-Yugoslav Major Maister. Slovenian troops surprised and disarmed the Green Guard early on the morning of 23 November. Thereafter, the city remained in Slovenian hands.

On 27 January 1919, Austrian Germans gathered to await the United States peace delegation at the city&#x27;s marketplace were fired upon by Slovenian troops. Nine citizens were killed and eighteen were seriously wounded; who had actually ordered the shooting has never been unequivocally established. German sources accused Maister&#x27;s troops of shooting without cause. In turn Slovene witnesses such as Maks Pohar claimed that the Austrian Germans attacked the Slovenian soldiers guarding the town hall, one even discharging a revolver and hitting one Slovenian soldier in the bayonet. The German-language media called the incident &quot;Marburg&#x27;s Bloody Sunday&quot;. As Maribor was now firmly in the hands of the Slovenian forces and surrounded completely by Slovenian territory; the city had been recognised as part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes without a plebiscite in the Treaty of Saint-Germain of 10 September 1919 between the victors and German Austria. For his actions in Maribor and later in the Austro-Slovene conflict in Carinthia, Rudolf Maister is today considered a Slovenian national hero.

After 1918, most of Maribor&#x27;s Austrian Germans left the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes for Austria. A policy of cultural assimilation was pursued in Yugoslavia against the Austrian German minority similar to the Germanization policy followed by Austria against its Slovene minority in Carinthia. From 1922 to 1929, Maribor was the seat of the Maribor Oblast, a subdivision within Yugoslavia and was later part of the Drava Banovina. Up until World War II, Maribor was considered the fastest-developing city in the country.

===World War II and aftermath===
In 1941 Lower Styria, the predominantly Slovene part of Styria, was annexed by Nazi Germany. German troops marched into the town at 9 pm on 8 April 1941. On 26 April Adolf Hitler, who encouraged his followers to &quot;make this land German again&quot;, visited Maribor and a grand reception was organised in the city castle by the local Germans. Immediately after the occupation, Nazi Germany began mass expulsions of Slovenes to the Independent State of Croatia, Serbia, and later to the concentration and work camps in Germany. The Nazi goal was to Germanize the population of Lower Styria after the war. Slovene patriots were taken hostage and many were later shot in the prisons of Maribor and Graz. This led to organised resistance by Slovene partisans. The first act of resistance in Maribor and occupied Slovenia occurred only three days after Hitler&#x27;s visit, when Slovene communists and SKOJ members burned two German cars.

Maribor was the site of a German prisoner-of-war camp from 1941 to 1945 for many British, Australian, and New Zealand troops who had been captured in Crete in 1941. In 1944, the largest mass rescue of POWs of the war in Europe took place when 105 Allied prisoners from the camp were freed by Slovene partisans in the Raid at Ožbalt. The city, a major industrial centre with an extensive armament industry, was systematically bombed by the Allies in the closing years of World War II. A total of 29 bombing raids devastated some 47% of the city area, killing 483 civilians and leaving over 4,200 people homeless. Over 2,600 people died in Maribor during the war. By the end of the war, Maribor was the most war-damaged major town of Yugoslavia. The remaining German-speaking population, except those who had actively supported the resistance during the war, was summarily expelled at the end of the war in May 1945. At the same time Croatian Home Guard members and their relatives who tried to escape from Yugoslavia were executed by the Yugoslav Army. The existence of nine mass graves in and near Maribor was revealed after Slovenia&#x27;s independence.

===Contemporary history===
After the Second World War, Maribor became part of SR Slovenia, within SFR Yugoslavia. A major process of renewal and reconstruction began in the city. Maribor soon after became the industrial centre of Slovenia and the whole of Yugoslavia, hosting many known companies such as the Maribor Automobile Factory among others. The first clash between the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army and the Slovenian Territorial Defence in Slovenia&#x27;s war of independence happened in nearby Pekre and on the streets of Maribor, resulting in the conflict&#x27;s first casualty. After Slovenia seceded from Yugoslavia in 1991, the loss of the Yugoslav market severely strained the city&#x27;s economy, which was based on heavy industry. The city saw a record unemployment rate of nearly 25%.

The economic situation of Maribor after the mid-1990s crisis worsened again with the onset of global economic crisis combined with the European sovereign-debt crisis, which was one of the causes for the beginning of 2012–13 Maribor protests which spread into 2012–2013 Slovenian protests. In 2012, Maribor was one of the two European Capitals of Culture, and the following year, Maribor was the European Youth Capital.

==Geography==

===Topography===
On the Drava River lies Maribor Island (). The oldest public bath, still an important and often visited place in Maribor, is located on the island.

There are two hills in Maribor: Calvary Hill and Pyramid Hill, both surrounded by vineyards. The latter dominates the northern border of the city. Ruins of the first Maribor castle from the 11th century and a chapel from the 19th century also stand there. The hill offers an easily accessible scenic overlook of Maribor and the countryside to the south over the Drava River.

===City districts===
The city of Maribor is divided into 11 districts () of the City Municipality of Maribor. The Drava River separates the districts of Center, Koroška Vrata, and Ivan Cankar to the north from other districts south of it. The various city districts are connected by four road bridges, a rail bridge, and a pedestrian bridge.

===Climate===
Maribor has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification: Dfb), bordering on oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb). Average temperatures hover around zero degrees Celsius during the winter. Summers are generally warm. Average temperatures during the city&#x27;s warmest month (July) exceed 20 degrees Celsius, which is one of the main reasons for the Maribor wine tradition. The city sees on average roughly of precipitation annually and it&#x27;s one of the sunniest Slovene cities, with an average of 266 sunny days throughout the course of the year. The most recent temperature heatwave record for August is 40.6 °C, measured at the Maribor–Tabor weather station by the Slovenian Environment Agency (ARSO) on 8 August 2013.


==Architecture==
Many historical structures stand in Maribor. Of the remains of city walls surrounding the old downtown, the most prominent are the Judgement Tower, the Water Tower, and the Jewish Tower. Maribor Cathedral was built in the Gothic style in the 13th century. Maribor Synagogue was built in the 14th century, and is the second oldest synagogue of Europe. Today it serves as a centre for cultural activities. Other prominent Medieval buildings are Maribor Castle, Betnava Castle, and the ruins of Upper Maribor Castle on Pyramid Hill. Town Hall was constructed in the Renaissance style, and the Plague Column in the Baroque style.

At the start of the 21st century, plans were made for a new modern business, residential and entertainment district, called the Drava Gate () and nicknamed the &quot;Maribor Manhattan&quot;. The project includes many new exclusive residential apartments, offices and conference halls, a green and recreational space, and other structures. It also includes a tall skyscraper that would be the tallest building in Slovenia. Due to lack of finances, the project has been postponed.

In 2008, the Studenci Footbridge () was renovated according to the design of the Ponting company. The design was awarded that year at the 3rd International Footbridge Conference in Porto.

In 2010, Maribor organised an international architectural competition &quot;ECC Maribor 2012 – Drava 2012&quot; to gather proposals for the design and reconstruction of the Drava banks, the construction of a new art gallery, and for a new footbridge. Its jury received about 400 proposals for the three different projects. The footbridge and the river embankments will be built in the near future, but the art gallery was replaced with a cultural center MAKS, which is currently under construction.

The construction of a new modern Faculty of Medicine started in 2011 near the Drava River. It was designed by architect Boris Podrecca and was completed in 2013.

There are plans to renovate the Maribor Public Library and Town Hall Square (). In addition, the renovation of Maribor Island () in the Drava River has been planned.

==Parks and other green spaces==
The main park in the city is , with the , and a wide promenade leading to the , containing over 100 local and foreign species of deciduous and coniferous trees.

== Demographics and religion ==
=== Catholic Church ===

Maribor, previously in the Catholic Diocese of Graz-Seckau, became part of the Diocese of Lavant on 1 June 1859, and the seat of its Prince-Bishop. The name of the diocese (after a river in Carinthia) was later changed to the Diocese of Maribor on 5 March 1962. It was elevated to an archdiocese by Pope Benedict XVI on 7 April 2006.

===Jewish community===
Jewish people living in Maribor were first mentioned in 1277. It is suggested that at that time there was already a Jewish quarter in the city. The Jewish ghetto was located in the southeastern part of the city and it comprised, at its peak, several main streets in the city centre including part of the main city square. The ghetto had a synagogue, a Jewish cemetery and also a Talmud school. The Jewish community of Maribor was numerically at its apex around 1410. After 1450 the circumstances changed dramatically: increasing competition that coincided with an economic crisis dealt a severe blow to the economic activities that were crucial to their economic success. According to a decree issued by Emperor Maximilian I in 1496, Jews were forced to leave the city of Maribor. Restrictions on settlement and business for Jews remained in place until 1861. From late spring 1941, after Lower Styria was annexed by the Third Reich, the Jews of Maribor were deported to concentration camps.

==Culture==
The city is the location of the University of Maribor, established in 1975, Alma Mater Europaea, and several other higher education institutions. High schools include Maribor High School No. 1 (&quot;Prva gimnazija Maribor&quot;) and Maribor High School No. 2 (&quot;II. gimnazija Maribor&quot;).

Every June, the two-week Lent Festival (named after the waterfront district called Lent) is held, with hundreds of musical, theatrical and other events. Every year the festival attracts theatre, opera, ballet performers, classical, modern, and jazz musicians and dancers from all over the world.

Maribor is known for wine and culinary specialities of international and Slovene cuisine (mushroom soup with buckwheat mush, tripe, sour soup, sausages with Sauerkraut, cheese dumplings, apple strudel, special cheese cake called gibanica). There are also many popular restaurants with Serbian cuisine. The Vinag Wine Cellar (), with the area of and the length of , keeps 5,5 millions litres of wine. The house of the oldest grapevine in the world () at Lent grows the world&#x27;s oldest grapevine, which was in 2004 recorded in &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;. The grapevine of Žametovka is over 400 years old.

The most listened radio station transmitting from Maribor is the commercial radio station Radio City. Other radio stations broadcasting from Maribor include Radio NET FM, Radio Maribor, Rock Maribor, Radio Brezje, and Maribor Študent Radio (MARŠ).

The alternative scene of Maribor is situated in the Pekarna Cultural Centre, located in a former military bakery area in the Magdalena District.

==Sports==

===Team sports===
Maribor is the hometown of the football club NK Maribor, playing in the Slovenian top division. NK Maribor has won the domestic title a record 16 times and has participated in the UEFA Champions League group stage on three occasions, in 1999, 2014, and 2017. The club&#x27;s home ground is Ljudski vrt, located in the Koroška Vrata district.

===Winter sports===
The Maribor Pohorje Ski Resort, situated on the outskirts of the city on the slopes of the Pohorje mountain range, hosted the women&#x27;s slalom and giant slalom races for the Alpine Skiing World Cup. The competition, known as the Golden Fox (), was held for the first time in 1964, and was last held in Maribor in 2019. Since then, due to the lack of snow in the city, the event has been relocated to Kranjska Gora.

===Event hosting===

In November 2012, Maribor hosted the World Youth Chess Championship with Garry Kasparov as the guest of honour. It was presumed that Maribor would also host the 2013 Winter Universiade, but the Government of Slovenia refused any financial support for the project. As a result, in March 2012, the International University Sports Federation decided that it would organise the Universiade elsewhere. In the same year, Maribor also withdrew as one of the host cities of the EuroBasket 2013 due to lack of finances.

Maribor&#x27;s Ljudski vrt stadium was one of the venues for the 2012 UEFA European Under-17 Championship and the 2021 UEFA European Under-21 Championship. In July 2023, Maribor hosted the 17th edition of the European Youth Olympic Festival.

===Sports parks===
Maribor&#x27;s sports parks include the Pohorje Adrenaline Park (), the Pohorje Bike Park, and the Betnava Adventure Park (&quot;Pustolovski park Betnava&quot;) with ropes courses, zip-lines, and poles.

<text>Matthew the Apostle was one of the twelve apostles of Jesus. According to Christian traditions, he was also one of the four Evangelists as author of the Gospel of Matthew, and thus is also known as Matthew the Evangelist.

The claim of his gospel authorship is rejected by most modern biblical scholars, though the &quot;traditional authorship still has its defenders.&quot; The New Testament records that as a disciple, he followed Jesus. Church Fathers, such as Irenaeus and Clement of Alexandria, relate that Matthew preached the gospel in Judea before going to other countries.

==In the New Testament==

Matthew is mentioned in Matthew 9:9 and Matthew 10:3 as a tax collector (in the New International Version and other translations of the Bible) who, while sitting at the &quot;receipt of custom&quot; in Capernaum, was called to follow Jesus. He is also listed among the Twelve Disciples, but without identification of his background, in Mark 3:18, Luke 6:15 and Acts 1:13. In passages parallel to Matthew 9:9, both Mark 2:14 and Luke 5:27 describe Jesus&#x27;s calling of the tax collector Levi, the son of Alphaeus. However, they do not explicitly associate it with the name Matthew.

Since the father of both Levi/Matthew and James, son of Alphaeus is named Alphaeus, according to the tradition of the Eastern Orthodox Church the two apostles were brothers.

==Ministry==
The New Testament records that as a disciple, Matthew followed Jesus. After Jesus&#x27; ascension, the disciples withdrew to an upper room (Acts 1:10–14) (traditionally the Cenacle) in Jerusalem. The disciples remained in and about Jerusalem and proclaimed that Jesus was the promised Messiah.

In the Babylonian Talmud (Sanhedrin 43a), &quot;Mattai&quot; is one of five disciples of &quot;Jeshu&quot;.

Early Church Fathers such as Irenaeus (&quot;Against Heresies&quot; 3.1.1) and Clement of Alexandria say that Matthew preached the gospel to the Jewish community in Judea, before going to other countries. Ancient writers are not in agreement as to which other countries these are, but almost all sources mention Ethiopia. The Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church each hold the tradition that Matthew died as a martyr and the Babylonian Talmud appears to report his execution in Sanhedrin 43a.

According to Church tradition, while preaching in Ethiopia, Matthew converted, and then consecrated to God, Ephigenia of Ethiopia, the virgin daughter of King Egippus. When King Hirtacus succeeded Egippus, he asked the apostle if he could persuade Ephigenia to marry him. Matthew invited King Hirtacus to liturgy the following Sunday, where he rebuked him for lusting after the girl, as she was a nun and therefore was the bride of Christ. The enraged King thus ordered his bodyguard to kill Matthew who stood at the altar, making him a martyr.

==The Gospel of Matthew==


Early Church tradition holds that the Gospel of Matthew was written by the apostle Matthew. This tradition is first attested, among the extant writings of the first and second centuries, with the early Christian bishop Papias of Hierapolis (), who is cited by the Church historian Eusebius (AD 260–340), as follows: &quot;Matthew collected the oracles [in Greek, : sayings of or about Jesus] in the Hebrew language [], and each one interpreted [ – perhaps &#x27;translated&#x27;] them as best he could.&quot; Likewise, early Christian theologian Origen (–) indicates that the first gospel was written by Matthew, and that his gospel was composed in Hebrew near Jerusalem for Hebrew Christians and translated into Greek. The Hebrew original was kept at the Library of Caesarea. Sometime in the late fourth or early fifth century the Nazarene Community transcribed a copy for Jerome, which he used in his work. This Gospel was called the Gospel according to the Hebrews or sometimes the Gospel of the Apostles and it was once believed that it was the original to the &#x27;Greek Matthew&#x27; found in the Bible. However, this has been challenged by modern biblical scholars such as Bart D. Ehrman and James R. Edwards.

Most modern scholars hold that the Gospel of Matthew was written anonymously, and not by Matthew. The author is not named within the text, and scholars have proposed that the superscription &quot;according to Matthew&quot; was added sometime in the second century.

==Non-canonical or apocryphal gospels==
In the 3rd century, Jewish–Christian gospels attributed to Matthew were used by Jewish–Christian groups such as the Nazarenes and Ebionites. Fragments of these gospels survive in quotations by Jerome, Epiphanius and others. Most academic study follows the distinction of Gospel of the Nazarenes (36 fragments), Gospel of the Ebionites (7 fragments), and Gospel of the Hebrews (7 fragments) found in Schneemelcher&#x27;s New Testament Apocrypha. Critical commentators generally regard these texts as having been composed in Greek and related to Greek Matthew. A minority of commentators consider them to be fragments of a lost Aramaic- or Hebrew-language original.

The Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew is a 7th-century compilation of three other texts: the Gospel of James, the Flight into Egypt, and the Infancy Gospel of Thomas.

Jerome relates that Matthew was supposed by the Nazarenes to have composed their Gospel of the Hebrews, though Irenaeus and Epiphanius of Salamis consider this simply a revised version of the canonical Gospel. This Gospel has been partially preserved in the writings of the Church Fathers, said to have been written by Matthew. Epiphanius does not make his own the claim about a Gospel of the Hebrews written by Matthew, a claim that he attributes to the Ebionites.
==Veneration==
Matthew is recognized as a saint in the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran and Anglican churches (see St. Matthew&#x27;s Church). His tomb is located in the crypt of Salerno Cathedral in southern Italy.

=== Roman Catholicism ===
The Roman Catholic Church celebrates Matthew with a feast on September 21.

=== Lutheranism ===
The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America remembers Matthew with a feast on September 21. The Lutheran Church ─ Missouri Synod also remembers Matthew with a feast on September 21.

=== Anglicanism ===
The Anglican communion commemorates Matthew with a festival on September 21.

=== Eastern Orthodox ===
Matthew is venerated as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church with the following feast days.

* June 30 (July 13): Synaxis of the Twelve Apostles.
* November 16 (November 29): Feast Day.

=== In Christian art ===
Like the other evangelists, Matthew is often depicted in Christian art with one of the four living creatures of Revelation 4:7. The one that accompanies him is in the form of a winged man. The three paintings of Matthew by Caravaggio in the church of San Luigi dei Francesi in Rome, where he is depicted as called by Christ from his profession as a tax gatherer, are among the landmarks of Western art.

==In Islam==
The Quran speaks of Jesus&#x27; disciples but does not mention their names, instead referring to them as &quot;helpers to the work of Allah&quot;. Muslim exegesis and Quran commentary, however, name them and include Matthew amongst the disciples. Muslim exegesis preserves the tradition that Matthew and Andrew were the two disciples who went to Ethiopia to preach the message of God.

== In the Druze faith ==
Druze tradition honors several &quot;mentors&quot; and &quot;prophets&quot;, and Matthew the Apostle is honored as a prophet. In the Druze tradition and doctrine, Matthew the Apostle is respected for his contributions to spiritual knowledge and guidance. Druze doctrine teaches that Christianity is to be &quot;esteemed and praised&quot;, as the Gospel writers are regarded as &quot;carriers of wisdom&quot;. 

The number 5 contains an unstated significance within the Druze faith; it is believed in this area that great prophets come in groups of five. In the time of the ancient Greeks, these five were represented by Pythagoras, Plato, Aristotle, Parmenides, and Empedocles. In the first century, the five were represented by Jesus Christ, John the Baptist, Saint Matthew, Saint Mark, and Saint Luke. In the time of the faith&#x27;s foundation, the five were Hamza ibn Ali ibn Ahmad, Muḥammad ibn Wahb al-Qurashī, Abū&#x27;l-Khayr Salama ibn Abd al-Wahhab al-Samurri, Ismāʿīl ibn Muḥammad at-Tamīmī, and Al-Muqtana Baha&#x27;uddin.

==In architecture==
The Basilica of Annunciation in Nazareth houses a capital that depicts Matthew the Apostle and his story regarding King Eglypus of Aethiopia and his sons. It shows how Matthew is leading them away from the demon in the far corner of the capital. The biblical story tells of Matthew converting the king and his sons to Christianity. Not only does this capital depict an act carried out by Matthew in the Bible, it foreshadows Matthew being a martyr. When Matthew the Apostle was murdered, he then became a martyr for the Christian religion as being killed for his faith and teachings given the demon in the corner of the capitol. The iconography of this capital helps understand the religion of the time period since it was just coming into Christendom. This shows the cross between Ethiopia and Nazareth as these are where the capitals are today.

<text>Mehrgarh is a Neolithic archaeological site (dated – BCE) situated on the Kacchi Plain of Balochistan in Pakistan. It is located near the Bolan Pass, to the west of the Indus River and between the modern-day Pakistani cities of Quetta, Kalat and Sibi. The site was discovered in 1974 by the French Archaeological Mission led by the French archaeologists Jean-François Jarrige and Catherine Jarrige. Mehrgarh was excavated continuously between 1974 and 1986, and again from 1997 to 2000. Archaeological material has been found in six mounds, and about 32,000 artifacts have been collected from the site. The earliest settlement at Mehrgarh, located in the northeast corner of the site, was a small farming village dated between 7000 BCE and 5500 BCE.

==History==

Mehrgarh is one of the earliest known sites in South Asia showing evidence of farming and herding. It was influenced by the Neolithic culture of the Near East, with similarities between &quot;domesticated wheat varieties, early phases of farming, pottery, other archaeological artefacts, some domesticated plants and herd animals.&quot; According to Asko Parpola, the culture migrated into the Indus Valley and became the Indus Valley Civilisation of the Bronze Age.

Jean-Francois Jarrige argues for an independent origin of Mehrgarh. Jarrige notes &quot;the assumption that farming economy was introduced full-fledged from Near-East to South Asia,&quot; and the similarities between Neolithic sites from eastern Mesopotamia and the western Indus Valley, which are evidence of a &quot;cultural continuum&quot; between those sites. However, given the originality of Mehrgarh, Jarrige concludes that Mehrgarh has an earlier local background,&quot; and is not a &quot;&#x27;backwater&#x27; of the Neolithic culture of the Near East.&quot;
Lukacs and Hemphill suggest an initial local development of Mehrgarh, with continuity in cultural development but a population change. According to Lukacs and Hemphill, while there is a strong continuity between the Neolithic and Chalcolithic cultures of Mehrgarh, dental evidence shows that the Chalcolithic population did not descend from the Neolithic population of Mehrgarh, which &quot;suggests moderate levels of gene flow.&quot; They wrote that &quot;the direct lineal descendants of the Neolithic inhabitants of Mehrgarh are to be found to the south and the east of Mehrgarh, Pakistan in northwestern India and the western edge of the Deccan Plateau,&quot; with Neolithic Mehrgarh showing greater affinity with Chalcolithic Inamgaon, south of Mehrgarh, than with Chalcolithic Mehrgarh.

Gallego Romero et al. (2011) state that their research on lactose tolerance in India suggests that &quot;the west Eurasian genetic contribution identified by Reich et al. (2009) principally reflects gene flow from Pakistan, Iran and the Middle East.&quot; Gallego Romero notes that Indians who are lactose-tolerant show a genetic pattern regarding this tolerance which is &quot;characteristic of the common European mutation.&quot; According to Romero, this suggests that &quot;the most common lactose tolerance mutation made a two-way migration out of the Middle East less than 10,000 years ago. While the mutation spread across Europe, another explorer must have brought the mutation eastward to India – likely traveling along the coast of the Persian Gulf where other pockets of the same mutation have been found.&quot; They further note that &quot;[t]he earliest evidence of cattle herding in south Asia comes from the Indus River Valley site of Mehrgarh and is dated to 7,000 YBP.&quot;

==Periods of occupation==
Archaeologists divide the occupation at the site into eight periods.

=== Mehrgarh Period I (pre-7000–5500 BCE) ===
The Mehrgarh Period I (pre-7000–5500 BCE) was Neolithic and aceramic (without the use of pottery). The earliest farming in the area was developed by semi-nomadic people using plants such as wheat and barley and animals such as sheep, goats and cattle. The settlement was established with unbaked mud-brick buildings and most of them had four internal subdivisions. Numerous burials have been found, many with elaborate goods such as baskets, stone and bone tools, beads, bangles, pendants, and occasionally animal sacrifices, with more goods left with burials of males. Ornaments of sea shell, limestone, turquoise, lapis lazuli and sandstone have been found, along with simple figurines of women and animals. Seashells from far seashores, and lapis lazuli from as far away as present-day Badakshan, show good contact with those areas. One ground stone axe was discovered in a burial, and several more were obtained from the surface. These ground stone axes are the earliest to come from a stratified context in South Asia.

Periods I, II, and III are considered contemporaneous with another site called Kili Gul Mohammad. The aceramic Neolithic phase in the region had originally been called the &quot;Kili Gul Muhammad phase&quot;. While the Kili Gul Muhammad site itself probably started , subsequent discoveries allowed the date range of 7000–5000 BCE to be defined for this aceramic Neolithic phase.

In 2001, archaeologists studying the remains of nine men from Mehrgarh discovered that the people of this civilization knew proto-dentistry. In April 2006, it was announced in the scientific journal &quot;Nature&quot; that the oldest (and first &quot;early Neolithic&quot;) evidence for the drilling of human teeth &quot;in vivo&quot; (&quot;i.e.&quot; in a living person) was found in Mehrgarh. According to the authors, their discoveries point to a tradition of proto-dentistry in the early farming cultures of that region. &quot;Here we describe eleven drilled molar crowns from nine adults discovered in a Neolithic graveyard in Pakistan that dates from 7,500 to 9,000 years ago. These findings provide evidence for a long tradition of a type of proto-dentistry in early farming culture.&quot;

===Mehrgarh Period II (5500–4800 BCE) and Period III (4800–3500 BCE)===
The Mehrgarh Period II (5500 BCE–4800 BCE) and Merhgarh Period III (4800 BCE–3500 BCE) were ceramic Neolithic, using pottery, and later chalcolithic. Period II is at site MR4 and Period III is at MR2. Much evidence of manufacturing activity has been found and more advanced techniques were used. Glazed faience beads were produced and terracotta figurines became more detailed. Figurines of females were decorated with paint and had diverse hairstyles and ornaments. Two flexed burials were found in Period II with a red ochre cover on the body. The number of burial goods decreased over time, becoming limited to ornaments and with more goods left with burials of females. The first button seals were produced from terracotta and bone and had geometric designs. Technologies included stone and copper drills, updraft kilns, large pit kilns, and copper melting crucibles. There is further evidence of long-distance trade in Period II: important as an indication of this is the discovery of several beads of lapis lazuli, once again from Badakshan. Mehrgarh Periods II and III are also contemporaneous with an expansion of the settled populations of the borderlands at the western edge of South Asia, including the establishment of settlements like Rana Ghundai, Sheri Khan Tarakai, Sarai Kala, Jalilpur, and Ghaligai.

Period III was not much explored, but it was found that Togau phase (–3500 BCE) was part of this level, covering around 100 hectares in the areas MR.2, MR.4, MR.5 and MR.6, encompassing ruins, burial and dumping grounds, but archaeologist Jean-François Jarrige concluded that &quot;such wide extension was not due to contemporaneous occupation, but rather due to the shift and partial superimposition in time of several villages or settlement clusters across a span of several centuries.&quot;

==== Togau phase ====
At the beginning of Mehrgarh III, Togau ceramics appeared at the site. Togau ware was first defined by Beatrice de Cardi in 1948. Togau is a large mound in the Chhappar Valley of Sarawan, 12 kilometers northwest of Kalat in Balochistan. This type of pottery is found widely in Balochistan and eastern Afghanistan, at sites such as Mundigak, Sheri Khan Tarakai, and Periano Ghundai. According to Possehl it is attested at 84 sites up to date. Anjira is a contemporary ancient site near Togau.

Togau ceramics are decorated with geometric designs and were already being made with a potter&#x27;s wheel.

Mehrgarh Period III, during the second half of the 4th millennium BCE, is characterized by important new developments. There is a big increase in the number of settlements in the Quetta Valley, the Surab Region, the Kachhi Plain and elsewhere in the area. Kili Ghul Mohammad (II−III) pottery is similar to Togau Ware.

=== Mehrgarh Periods IV, V and VI (3500–3000 BCE) ===
Period IV was 3500–3250 BCE, Period V from 3250–3000 BCE, and Period VI was around 3000 BCE. The site containing Periods IV to VII is designated as MR1.

=== Mehrgarh Period VII (2600–2000 BCE) ===
Sometime between 2600 BCE and 2000 BCE, the city seems to have been largely abandoned in favor of the larger fortified town Nausharo five miles away, when the Indus Valley civilisation was in its middle stages of development. Historian Michael Wood suggests this took place around 2500 BCE.

Archaeologist Massimo Vidale considers a series of semi-columns found in a structure at Mehrgarh, dated around 2500 BCE by the French mission there, to be very similar to semi-columns found in Period IV at Shahr-e Sukhteh.

===Mehrgarh Period VIII===
The last period is found at the Sibri cemetery, about 8 kilometers from Mehrgarh.

==Lifestyle and technology==
Early Mehrgarh residents lived in mud brick houses, stored their grain in granaries, fashioned tools with local copper ore, and lined their large basket containers with bitumen. They cultivated six-row barley, einkorn and emmer wheat, jujubes and dates, and herded sheep, goats and cattle. Residents of the later period (5500 BCE to 2600 BCE) put much effort into crafts, including flint knapping, tanning, bead production, and metal working. Mehrgarh is probably the earliest known center of agriculture in South Asia.

The oldest known example of the lost-wax technique comes from a 6,000-year-old wheel-shaped copper amulet found at Mehrgarh. The amulet was made from unalloyed copper, an unusual innovation that was later abandoned.

==Artifacts==
===Human figurines===
The oldest ceramic figurines in South Asia were also found at Mehrgarh. They occur in all phases of the settlement and were prevalent even before pottery appears. The earliest figurines are quite simple and do not show intricate features. However, they grow in sophistication with time, and by 4000 BCE begins to show their characteristic hairstyles and typical prominent breasts. All the figurines up to this period were female. Male figurines appear only from period VII and gradually become more numerous. Many of the female figurines are holding babies, and were interpreted as depictions of a mother goddess. However, due to some difficulties in conclusively identifying these figurines with a mother goddess, some scholars prefer using the term &quot;female figurines with likely cultic significance&quot;.

===Pottery===

Evidence of pottery begins from Period II. In Period III, the finds become much more abundant as the potter&#x27;s wheel is introduced, and they show more intricate designs and also animal motifs. The characteristic female figurines appear beginning in Period IV and the finds show more intricate designs and sophistication. Pipal leaf designs are used in decoration from Period VI. Some sophisticated firing techniques were used from Periods VI and VII and an area reserved for the pottery industry has been found at mound MR1. However, by Period VIII, the quality and intricacy of designs seem to have suffered due to mass production, and a growing interest in bronze and copper vessels.

===Burials===
There are two types of burials in the Mehrgarh site. There were individual burials where a single individual was enclosed in narrow mud walls and collective burials with thin mud-brick walls within which skeletons of six different individuals were discovered. The bodies in the collective burials were kept in a flexed position and were laid east to west. Child bones were found in large jars or urn burials (4000–3300 BCE).

===Metallurgy===
Metal findings have been dated as early as Period IIB, with a few copper items.

<doc id="20676" wikidata="Q1475303" url="?curid=20676" title="Microvision">
<text>The Microvision (aka Milton Bradley Microvision or MB Microvision) is the first handheld game console that used interchangeable cartridges and in that sense is reprogrammable. It was released by the Milton Bradley Company in November 1979 for a retail price of $49.99, equivalent to $212.00 in 2023.

The Microvision was designed by Jay Smith, the engineer who would later design the Vectrex video game console. The Microvision&#x27;s combination of portability and a cartridge-based system led to moderate success, with Smith Engineering grossing $15 million in the first year of the system&#x27;s release. However, very few cartridges, a small screen, and a lack of support from established home video game companies led to its demise in 1981. According to Satoru Okada, the former head of Nintendo&#x27;s R&amp;D1 Department, the Microvision gave birth to Game Boy, the follow-up to Game &amp; Watch, after Nintendo designed around Microvision&#x27;s limitations.

==Production==

Unlike most later consoles, the Microvision did not contain an onboard processor (CPU). Instead, each game included its own processor contained within the removable cartridge. This meant that the console itself effectively consisted of the controls, LCD panel and LCD controller.

The processors for the first Microvision cartridges were made with both Intel 8021 (cross licensed by Signetics) and Texas Instruments TMS1100 processors. Due to purchasing issues, Milton Bradley switched to using TMS1100 processors exclusively including reprogramming the games that were originally programmed for the 8021 processor. The TMS1100 was a more primitive device, but offered more memory and lower power consumption than the 8021. First-revision Microvisions needed two batteries due to the 8021&#x27;s higher power consumption, but later units (designed for the TMS1100) only had one active battery holder. Even though the battery compartment was designed to allow the two 9-volt batteries to be inserted with proper polarity of positive and negative terminals, when a battery was forcefully improperly oriented, while the other battery was properly oriented, the two batteries would be shorted and they would overheat. The solution was to remove terminals for one of the batteries to prevent this hazard. Due to the high cost of changing production molds, Milton Bradley did not eliminate the second battery compartment, but instead removed its terminals and called it a spare battery holder.

==Problems==

Microvision units and cartridges are now somewhat rare. Those that are still in existence are susceptible to three main problems: &quot;screen rot,&quot; ESD damage, and keypad destruction.

===Screen rot===
The manufacturing process used to create the Microvision&#x27;s LCD was primitive by modern standards. Poor sealing and impurities introduced during manufacture have resulted in the condition known as &quot;screen rot&quot;. The liquid crystal spontaneously leaks and permanently darkens, resulting in a game unit that still plays but is unable to properly draw the screen. While extreme heat, which can instantly destroy the screen, can be avoided, there is nothing that can be done to prevent screen rot in most Microvision systems.

===ESD damage===
A major design problem on early units involves the fact that the microprocessor (which is inside the top of each cartridge) lacks ESD protection and is directly connected to the copper pins which normally connect the cartridge to the Microvision unit. If the user opens the protective sliding door that covers the pins, the processor can be exposed to any electric charge the user has built up. If the user has built up a substantial charge, the discharge can jump around the door&#x27;s edge or pass through the door itself (dielectric breakdown). The low-voltage integrated circuit inside the cartridge is extremely ESD sensitive, and can be destroyed by an event of only a few dozen volts which cannot even be felt by the person, delivering a fatal shock to the game unit. This phenomenon was described in detail by John Elder Robison (a former Milton Bradley engineer) in his book &quot;Look Me in the Eye&quot;; Robinson described the issue as having been a significant enough issue during the 1979 holiday season (with up to 60% of units being returned as defective) that it resulted in significant panic among Milton Bradley staff and required extensive modifications to both later Microvision units and Microvision factories (the former being of his own design) to better dispel stray static charges.

===Keypad destruction===
The Microvision unit had a twelve-button keypad, with the switches buried under a thick layer of flexible plastic. To align the user&#x27;s fingers with the hidden buttons, the cartridges had cutouts in their bottom (over the keypad). As different games required different button functions, the cutouts were covered with a thin printed piece of plastic, which identified the buttons&#x27; functions in that game. The problem with this design is that pressing on the buttons stretched the printed plastic, resulting in the thin material stretching and eventually tearing. Having long fingernails exacerbated the condition. Many of the initial games were programmed to give feedback of the keypress when the key was released instead of when the key was pressed. As a result, users may press on the keypad harder because they are not being provided with any feedback that the key has been pressed. This resulted from a keypad used for prototyping being different from the production keypad; the prototyping keypad had tactile feedback upon key pressing that the production units lacked.

<doc id="20677" wikidata="Q154412" url="?curid=20677" title="Mary, Queen of Hungary">
<text>Mary, also known as Maria of Anjou (, , ; 137117 May 1395), reigned as Queen of Hungary and Croatia between 1382 and 1385, and from 1386 until her death. She was the daughter of Louis the Great, King of Hungary and Poland, and his wife, Elizabeth of Bosnia. Mary&#x27;s marriage to Sigismund of Luxembourg, a member of the imperial Luxembourg dynasty, was already decided before her first birthday. A delegation of Polish prelates and lords confirmed her right to succeed her father in Poland in 1379.

Having no male siblings, Mary was crowned &quot;king&quot; of Hungary on 17September 1382, seven days after Louis the Great&#x27;s death. Her mother, who had assumed the regency, absolved the Polish noblemen from their oath of loyalty to Mary in favour of Mary&#x27;s younger sister, Jadwiga, in early 1383. The idea of a female monarch remained unpopular among the Hungarian noblemen, the majority of whom regarded Mary&#x27;s distant cousin, Charles III of Naples, as the lawful heir. To strengthen Mary&#x27;s position, the queen mother wanted her to marry Louis, the younger brother of Charles VI of France. Their engagement was announced in May 1385.

Charles III of Naples landed in Dalmatia in September 1385. Sigismund of Luxembourg invaded Upper Hungary (now Slovakia), forcing the queen mother to give 14-year-old Mary in marriage to him in October. However, they could not prevent Charles from entering Buda. After Mary renounced the throne, Charles was crowned king on 31December 1385, but he was murdered at the instigation of Mary&#x27;s mother in February 1386. Mary was restored, but the dead king&#x27;s supporters captured her and her mother on 25July. Queen Elizabeth was murdered in January 1387, but Mary was released on 4June 1387. Mary officially remained co-ruler with Sigismund, who had meanwhile been crowned king, but her influence on the government was minimal. She and her premature son died after falling from a horse when the queen went on a hunting trip while she was pregnant.

== Childhood (1371–1382) ==

Mary was born in the latter half of 1371 to Louis the Great, King of Hungary and Poland, and his second wife, Elizabeth of Bosnia. She was the second daughter of her parents. They had been childless for over a decade before Mary&#x27;s older sister, Catherine, was born in 1370. Mary and Catherine gained another sibling, Jadwiga, in 1374.

Since Louis had fathered no sons, the expectation that he would bequeath Hungary, Poland, and his claims to the Kingdom of Naples and Provence to his daughters made them desirable spouses for members of the European royal families. Before Mary&#x27;s first birthday, her father made a promise to Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor, that Mary would marry the emperor&#x27;s second son, Sigismund of Luxembourg. Louis confirmed his promise in a deed in June 1373. Mary and Sigismund were closely related, because her paternal grandmother, Elizabeth of Poland, was the sister of his great-grandfather, Casimir III of Poland. Pope Gregory XI issued the dispensation necessary for their marriage on 6December 1374. The leading Hungarian and Polish lords confirmed Louis&#x27;s promise of Mary&#x27;s and Sigismund&#x27;s marriage on 14April 1375.

Mary&#x27;s older sister, Catherine, who had been betrothed to Louis of France, died in late 1378. Louis the Great confirmed his earlier promise of Mary&#x27;s and Sigismund&#x27;s marriage to Sigismund&#x27;s brother, Wenceslaus, King of the Romans, in Zólyom (now Zvolen in Slovakia) in 1379. Louis and Wenceslaus also agreed that they would acknowledge Urban VI as the lawful pope against Clement VII. Mary was formally engaged to Sigismund in Nagyszombat (now Trnava in Slovakia) in the same year. Sigismund, who had meanwhile become Margrave of Brandenburg, came to Hungary.

Louis summoned the Polish prelates and lords to Kassa (now Košice in Slovakia) in September 1379, persuading them to acknowledge Mary&#x27;s right to succeed him in Poland. The contemporaneous Jan of Czarnków, who was biased against Louis, recorded that the Poles yielded to the monarch&#x27;s demand only after he had prevented them from leaving the town by shutting its gates. At a meeting with Leopold III, Duke of Austria in early 1380, Louis strongly hinted that he would bequeath Hungary to his younger daughter, Jadwiga, who had been engaged to LeopoldIII&#x27;s son, William. Upon Louis&#x27;s demand, a delegation of the Polish noblemen again paid homage to Sigismund and Mary on 25July 1382. According to the historian Oscar Halecki, Louis wished to divide his kingdoms between his two surviving daughters, but Pál Engel and Claude Michaud write that the ailing king wanted to bequeath both Hungary and Poland on Mary and Sigismund.

== Reign ==

=== First years (1382–1384) ===

Louis the Great died on 10 September 1382. Cardinal Demetrius, Archbishop of Esztergom, crowned Mary &quot;king&quot; with the Holy Crown of Hungary in Székesfehérvár on 17September, a day after her father&#x27;s burial. Mary&#x27;s title and her rapid coronation in the absence of her fiancé, Sigismund, show that her mother and her mother&#x27;s supporters wanted to emphasize Mary&#x27;s role as monarch and to postpone or even hinder Sigismund&#x27;s coronation.

The queen mother, Elizabeth, assumed regency. Palatine Nicholas Garai and Cardinal Demetrius became her main advisors. Most of Louis&#x27;s barons preserved their offices; the queen mother only dismissed the master of the cupbearers, George Czudar, and his brother Peter, voivode of Ruthenia. According to the 15th-century historian Jan Długosz, the Czudar brothers surrendered forts to the Lithuanians, who had &quot;[h]eavily bribed&quot; them. Queen Elizabeth had Peter Czudar imprisoned before 1November; her charters only stated that he &quot;had obviously been disloyal&quot; without specifying the reasons for his arrest.

All royal charters issued during the first six months of Mary&#x27;s reign emphasized that she had lawfully inherited her father&#x27;s crown. However, most Hungarian noblemen were strongly opposed to the very idea of a female monarch. They regarded Charles III of Naples as Louis the Great&#x27;s legitimate heir because Charles was the last male offspring of the Capetian House of Anjou. Charles could not openly lay claim to Hungary, because his rival for the Kingdom of Naples, Louis I, Duke of Anjouwho was Charles VI of France&#x27;s unclehad invaded Southern Italy in the previous year.

Noblemen from Greater Poland offered to pay homage to either Mary or Jadwiga at a meeting in Radomsko on 25November, but they stipulated that the queen and her husband should live in Poland. The assembly of the nobility of Lesser Poland passed a similar resolution in Wiślica on 12December. On the latter occasion, in response to Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s demand, the noblemen also promised that they would not pay homage to anyone else than either Mary or Jadwiga. Mary&#x27;s fiancé, Sigismund, who had stayed in Poland, returned to Hungary. Bodzanta, Archbishop of Gniezno, the Nałęcz family, and their allies in Greater Poland favoured a native prince, SiemowitIV of Masovia. To avoid a civil war, Queen Elizabeth sent envoys to the Polish noblemen&#x27;s next assembly which met in Sieradz in late February 1383. Her envoys absolved the Poles from their 1382 oath of loyalty to Mary on 28March, announcing that the queen mother would send her younger daughter, Jadwiga, to Poland.

John of Palisna, Prior of Vrana, rose up in open rebellion against the rule of Mary and her mother in the spring of 1383. The queens made Stephen Lackfi Ban of Croatia. The royal army marched to Croatia and laid siege to Vrana, forcing John of Palisna to flee to Bosnia. The defenders of Vrana surrendered to Mary, who had been present during the siege along with her mother, on 4November. To strengthen Mary&#x27;s position against Charles of Naples, Queen Elizabeth sent her envoys to France and opened negotiations on the marriage of Mary to the younger brother of CharlesVI of France, Louis, who had once been engaged to Mary&#x27;s sister, Catherine. Mary and the queen mother only left Croatia and Slavonia early next year. Queen Elizabeth replaced Stephen Lackfi with Thomas Szentgyörgyi, who used draconian measures to put an end to a conspiracy against the queens in Zadar in May 1384.

Although the last Diet was held in the early 1350s, the queens convoked a Diet to deal with the grievances of the noblemen. Mary confirmed her father&#x27;s decrees of 1351 summarizing the noblemen&#x27;s privileges on 22June 1384. The negotiations of Mary&#x27;s marriage in France caused a new rift within the Hungarian nobility, because the Lackfis, Nicholas Zámbó and Nicholas Szécsi and other high officers, who had been appointed during Louis the Great&#x27;s reign, continued to support Mary&#x27;s fiancé, Sigismund, in accordance with Louis the Great&#x27;s will. The queen mother replaced them with Nicholas Garai&#x27;s supporters in August 1384. The prelates were also opposed to the French marriage because the French supported Clement VII whom the Hungarian clergy considered an antipope. Mary&#x27;s sister, Jadwiga, went to Poland where she was crowned on 16October 1384. Cardinal Demetrius, who had accompanied Jadwiga to Poland, remained absent from the queens&#x27; court after his return to Hungary. The royal government could not properly function during his absence because he was the keeper of the royal seal.

=== Neapolitan threat (1384–1385) ===

Louis I of Anjou died on 10 September 1384, enabling his rival, CharlesIII of Naples, to stabilize his rule in Southern Italy during the next months. The consolidation of CharlesIII&#x27;s position in Naples also contributed to the formation of a party of noblemen who supported his claim to Hungary. John Horvat, Ban of Macsó (now Mačva in Serbia), and his brother, Paul, Bishop of Zagreb, were the leading figures of their movement. Sigismund of Luxembourg tried to persuade the queen mother to consent to his marriage to Mary, but she refused him. He left Hungary in early 1385.

The queens and their supporters initiated negotiations with the representatives of the opposition, but no reconciliation was reached at their meeting in Požega in the spring of 1385. After a French delegation came to Hungary in May 1385, Mary was engaged to Louis of France. Louis of France thereafter signed his letters &quot;Louis of France, King of Hungary&quot;, according to Jean Froissart. In the same month, the queen mother dismissed Stephen Lackfi, accusing him of high treason. She also sent letters to Zagreb and other places in the kingdom, forbidding the local inhabitants to support Lackfi, Nicholas Szécsi, Bishop Paul Horvat and their relatives. John and Paul Horvat and their allies formally offered the crown to CharlesIII of Naples and invited him to Hungary in August. In the same month, Mary confirmed TvrtkoI of Bosnia&#x27;s acquisition of Kotor in Dalmatia. Sigismund stormed into Upper Hungary, accompanied by his cousins, Jobst and Prokop of Moravia, and occupied Pozsony County. The queen mother replaced Nicholas Garai with Nicholas Szécsi, and made Stephen Lackfi voivode of Transylvania and Nicholas Zámbó master of the treasury.

Charles III of Naples landed at Senj in Dalmatia in September 1385 and marched to Zagreb. Sigismund of Luxembourg came to Buda and persuaded the queen mother to give her consent to his marriage to Mary. The marriage took place in Buda in October, but Sigismund was not crowned king and received no governmental function. The queen mother convoked a new Diet and Mary again confirmed the noblemen&#x27;s liberties, but the queens&#x27; rule remained unpopular. Sigismund left Buda and mortgaged the territories west of the River Vág to his Moravian cousins. Charles of Naples had meanwhile left Zagreb, stating that he wanted to restore peace and public order in Hungary.

=== Charles&#x27;s reign (1385–1386) ===

Many noblemen joined Charles of Naples who marched towards Buda. Mary and her mother received him ceremoniously before he reached Buda, and he entered the capital in the two queens&#x27; company in early December 1385. Mary renounced the crown without resistance in the middle of December out of fear that Charles would kill her. Charles first adopted the title governor, but the Diet elected him king. Charles was crowned king of Hungary in Székesfehérvár on 31December. According to the contemporaneous Lorenzo de Monacis, Mary and her mother, who attended Charles&#x27;s coronation, visited Louis the Great&#x27;s tomb during the ceremony where they burst into tears because of their ill fate.

Charles did not detain Mary and her mother who continued to live in the royal palace in Buda. Queen Elizabeth and Nicholas Garai decided to get rid of Charles. They persuaded Blaise Forgách, the master of the cupbearers, to join them, promising him the domain of Gimes (now Jelenec in Slovakia) if he murdered the king. Upon Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s request, Charles visited her and her daughter on 7February 1386. During the meeting, Blaise Forgách attacked the king, seriously injuring him on the head. The wounded King Charles was carried to Visegrád where he died on 24February.

=== Restoration and capture (1386–1387) ===

Mary was restored to the throne, with her mother ruling in her name. The queen mother informed the citizens of Kőszeg already on 14February that &quot;Queen Mary had regained the Holy Crown&quot;. However, the Horvat brothers rose up in open rebellion on behalf of the murdered king&#x27;s son, Ladislaus of Naples. Mary&#x27;s husband, Sigismund, and his brother, Wenceslaus, invaded Upper Hungary in April. After weeks of negotiations, the queens acknowledged Sigismund&#x27;s position as consort in a treaty which was signed in Győr in early May. They also confirmed Sigismund&#x27;s mortgage of the lands west of the Vág to Jobst and Prokop of Moravia. After the treaty was signed, the queens returned to Buda and Sigismund went to Bohemia, suggesting that he was dissatisfied with the treaty.

Queen Elizabeth, who according to the 15th-century historian Johannes de Thurocz was &quot;driven by folly&quot;, decided to visit the southern counties of the kingdom that were controlled by supporters of Ladislaus of Naples. The queen mother and Mary set out for Đakovo, accompanied by Nicholas Garai and a modest following around 15July. However, John Horvát, John of Palisna and their retainers ambushed and attacked the queens and their retinue at Gorjani on 25July. The queens&#x27; small entourage fought the attackers, but all were killed or captured. Blaise Forgách and Nicholas Garai were beheaded and their heads were thrown into the queens&#x27; carriage. Elizabeth took all the blame for the rebellion and begged the attackers to spare her daughter&#x27;s life, according to Johannes deThurocz&#x27;s account.

Mary and her mother were imprisoned. They were held in captivity in Gomnec Castle, which was a fortress of the Bishopric of Zagreb. In the queens&#x27; absence, the barons of the realm convoked a Diet under the newly carved &quot;seal of the regnicoles&quot;. On Queen Mary&#x27;s behalf, they promised a general pardon, but the Horvats refused to submit. The two queens were dragged to Krupa, and from there to Novigrad Castle on the coast of the Adriatic Sea. The barons or the Diet elected Stephen Lackfi palatine and made Sigismund of Luxembourg regent. John Horvat&#x27;s henchmen strangled Queen Elizabeth in Mary&#x27;s presence in early January. In the same month, Sigismund invaded Slavonia, but could not defeat the rebels.

Taking advantage of the anarchy in Hungary, Polish troops invaded Lodomeria and Halych in February. Only Vladislaus II of Opole, who claimed the two realms for himself, protested against their action. Sigismund was crowned king on 31March as it was decided that the kingdom could no longer be without an effective ruler. One of his supporters, Ivan of Krk, laid siege to Novigrad Castle with the assistance of a Venetian fleet, which was under the command of Giovanni Barbarigo. They captured the castle and liberated Mary on 4June 1387. She was especially grateful to Barbarigo; she knighted him and granted an annuity of 600 golden florins to him.

=== Husband&#x27;s co-ruler (1387–1395) ===

Mary met her husband in Zagreb on 4July. She officially remained Sigismund&#x27;s co-ruler until the end of her life, but her influence on government was minimal. Sigismund&#x27;s land grants were always confirmed with Mary&#x27;s great seal during the first year of their common rule, but thereafter the grantees rarely sought her confirmation. Royal charters counted her regnal years not from her ascension, but from her husband&#x27;s coronation. Nevertheless, according to Johannes de Thurocz, Mary persuaded her husband to dismember John Horvat who was captured in July 1394 although Sigismund would have been willing to spare his life.

Mary was pregnant when she decided to venture out alone on a hunt in a Buda forest on 17May 1395. Her horse tripped, threw her and fell on top of her. The trauma induced labor and she gave birth prematurely to a son. The queen succumbed to the fatal injuries; being far from any kind of assistance, her son died as well. She was buried in the cathedral of Várad (now Oradea in Romania). Mary&#x27;s sister, Jadwiga, claimed the Hungarian crown, but Sigismund retained it without much difficulty.

==History==

Macrovision Corporation was established in 1983 by Victor Farrow and John O. Ryan. The 1984 film &quot;The Cotton Club&quot; was the first video to be encoded with Macrovision technology when it was released in 1985. The technology was subsequently extended to DVD players and other consumer electronic recording and playback devices such as digital cable and satellite set-top boxes, digital video recorders, and portable media players. By the end of the 1980s, most major Hollywood studios were utilizing their services.

In the 1990s, Macrovision acquired companies with expertise in managing access control and secure distribution of other forms of digital media, including music, video games, internet content, and computer software.

Ryan (founder and CEO of Macrovision from June 1995 to October 2001) and William A. Krepick (president of Macrovision Corporation from July 1995 to July 2005 and CEO from October 2001 to July 2005) led the company through an IPO in 1997 priced at $9.00 a share. Under their leadership, the company went from a private company with sales of under $20 million to a global, publicly traded corporation with annual sales of $220 million and market cap exceeding $1 billion.

In July 2005, the company hired Alfred J. Amoroso as chief executive officer and president to succeed William A. Krepick, who announced his retirement earlier in the year.

Macrovision acquired Gemstar-TV Guide on May 2, 2008, in a cash-and-stock deal worth about $2.8 billion. The combined company would seek to be “the homepage for the TV experience,” said Mr. Amoroso.

After the announcement of its intent to buy Gemstar-TV Guide, Macrovision made other changes in order to focus on entertainment technology, including selling its software business unit, valued at approximately $200 million, to private equity firm Thoma Cressey Bravo. The divestiture of the software business unit closed on April 1, 2008, becoming Acresso Software. Macrovision also ultimately sold off parts of Gemstar-TV Guide not focused on digital entertainment, including TryMedia, eMeta, TV Guide Magazine, TV Guide Network and the TV Games Network.

The company also bought two companies providing entertainment metadata: All Media Guide on November 6, 2007, and substantially all the assets of Muze, Inc. on April 15, 2009.

===As Rovi===

On July 16, 2009, Macrovision Solutions Corporation announced the official change of its name to Rovi Corporation.

Rovi announced its first product on January 7, 2010 – TotalGuide, an interactive media guide that incorporated entertainment data, to search, browse and provide recommendations. On March 16, 2010, Rovi acquired MediaUnbound for an undisclosed amount. MediaUnbound had helped build static and dynamic personalization and recommendation engines for clients such as Napster, eMusic and MTV Networks. On June 16, 2010, the company announced the Rovi Advertising Network which bundled guide advertising and third-party interactive TV platforms.

On December 23, 2010, the company announced its intention to acquire Sonic Solutions and its DivX video software in a deal valued at $720 million. Sonic provided digital video processing, playback and distribution technologies and owned RoxioNow (formerly CinemaNow) an OTT technology provider.

On March 1, 2011, Rovi announced its acquisition of online video guide SideReel.

The company announced Amoroso&#x27;s intention to retire on May 26, 2011. Tom Carson, formerly the executive vice president of sales and marketing, was appointed CEO and President in December 2011. Under Carson the company shifted its focus on &quot;growth opportunities related to its core enabling technology and services&quot; and it announced that it intended to sell the Rovi Entertainment Store business. It entered into separate agreements to sell the Rovi Entertainment Store to Reliance Majestic Holdings, a private equity-backed company; and its consumer websites to All Media Networks, a new company, in July 2013. Continuing on this path, the company made a similar announcement in January 2014 indicating its intent to sell the DivX and MainConcept businesses.

On April 1, 2013, Rovi acquired Integral Reach, a provider of predictive analysis services. The technology would be integrated into Rovi&#x27;s audience analysis services.

In April 2013, Facebook began licensing Rovi metadata for use within the service.

=== As TiVo Corporation ===

On April 29, 2016, Rovi Corporation announced that it had acquired TiVo Inc. for $1.1 billion. The combined company operated under the TiVo brand, and held over 6,000 pending and registered patents. Rovi plans to discontinue in-house hardware production, and focus primarily on licensing its technologies and the TiVo brand to third-party companies.

In December 2019, TiVo Corporation announced their intent to merge with Xperi. The surviving entity will operate under the Xperi name and have a combined value of $3 billion. TiVo had previously considered splitting out its hardware operations from its licensing operations. The merger was completed on June 1, 2020.

In August 2022, TiVo announced the TiVo OS for smart TVs launching in 2023 in Europe with Vestel.

==Legacy products==
The company historically developed technologies and products that helped protect content from being pirated. Its two core legacy products were called RipGuard and the Analog Protection System (APS).

===RipGuard===

Macrovision introduced its RipGuard technology in February 2005. It was designed to prevent or reduce digital DVD copying by altering the format of the DVD content to disrupt the ripping software. Although the technology could be circumvented by several current DVD rippers such as AnyDVD or DVDFab, Macrovision claimed that 95% of casual users lack the knowledge and/or determination to be able to copy a DVD with RipGuard technology.

===Analog Protection System===

The Analog Protection System (APS), also known as Analog Copy Protection (ACP), Copyguard or Macrovision, was the Macrovision Corporation&#x27;s flagship product, a copy protection system for both VHS and DVD. Video tapes copied from DVDs encoded with APS become garbled and unwatchable. The process works by adding pulses to analog video signals to negatively impact the AGC circuit of a recording device. In digital devices, changes to the analog video signal are created by a chip that converts the digital video to analog within the device. In DVD players, trigger bits are created during DVD authoring to inform the APS that it should be applied to DVD players&#x27; analog outputs or analog video outputs on a PC while playing back a protected DVD-Video disc. In set top boxes trigger bits are incorporated into Conditional Access Entitlement Control Messages (ECM) in the stream delivered to the STB. In VHS, alterations to the analog video signal are added in a Macrovision-provided &quot;processor box&quot; used by duplicators.

===As Macrovision===

<doc id="20682" wikidata="Q1631366" url="?curid=20682" title="MIPS Technologies">
<text>MIPS Tech LLC, formerly MIPS Computer Systems, Inc. and MIPS Technologies, Inc., is an American fabless semiconductor design company that is most widely known for developing the MIPS architecture and a series of RISC CPU chips based on it. MIPS provides processor architectures and cores for digital home, networking, embedded, Internet of things and mobile applications.

MIPS was founded in 1984 to commercialize the work being carried out at Stanford University on the MIPS architecture, a pioneering RISC design. The company generated intense interest in the late 1980s, seeing design wins with Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) and Silicon Graphics (SGI), among others. By the early 1990s the market was crowded with new RISC designs and further design wins were limited. The company was purchased by SGI in 1992, by that time its only major customer, and won several new designs in the game console space. In 1998, SGI announced they would be transitioning off MIPS and spun off the company.

After several years operating as an independent design house, in 2013 the company was purchased by Imagination Technologies, best known for their PowerVR graphics processor family. They were sold to Tallwood Venture Capital in 2017 and then purchased soon after by Wave Computing in 2018. Wave declared bankruptcy in 2020, emerging in 2021 as MIPS and announcing that the MIPS architecture was being abandoned in favor of RISC-V designs.

In May 2022, MIPS previewed its first RISC-V CPU IP cores, the eVocore P8700 and I8500 multiprocessors. In December 2022, MIPS announced availability of the P8700.

== History ==

MIPS Computer Systems Inc. was founded in 1984 by a group of researchers from Stanford University including John L. Hennessy and Chris Rowen. These researchers had worked on a project called MIPS (for &quot;Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages&quot;), one of the projects that pioneered the RISC concept. Other principal founders were Skip Stritter, formerly a Motorola technologist, and John Moussouris, formerly of IBM.

The initial CEO was Vaemond Crane, formerly President and CEO of Computer Consoles Inc., who arrived in February 1985 and departed in June 1989. He was replaced by Bob Miller, a former senior IBM and Data General executive. Miller ran the company through its IPO and subsequent sale to Silicon Graphics.

In 1986, MIPS Computer Systems designs were noticed by companies such as Cadnetix, Prime Computer and Silicon Graphics (SGI), these adopting the R2000 for new products, with SGI adopting the MIPS architecture for its computers having noted that the Motorola 68000 series of processors was &quot;at the end of its price-performance curve&quot;. Identifying the &quot;time-to-market issues&quot; of companies introducing workstation products, MIPS introduced a range of component kits, processor boards and memory boards, intended as &quot;building blocks&quot; for such companies to build into systems. Additionally, development systems such as the M/500 were sold, intended to support software development at systems vendors building MIPS-based hardware products. In December 1989, MIPS held its first IPO. That year, Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) released a Unix workstation based on the MIPS design.

After developing the R2000 and R3000 microprocessors, a management change brought along the larger dreams of being a computer vendor. The company found itself unable to compete in the computer market against much larger companies and was struggling to support the costs of developing both the chips and the systems (MIPS Magnum). To secure the supply of future generations of MIPS microprocessors (the 64-bit R4000), SGI acquired the company in 1992 for $333 million and renamed it as MIPS Technologies Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of SGI.

During SGI&#x27;s ownership of MIPS, the company introduced the R8000 in 1994 and the R10000 in 1996 and a follow-up the R12000 in 1997. During this time, two future microprocessors code-named &quot;The Beast&quot; and &quot;Capitan&quot; were in development; these were cancelled after SGI decided to migrate to the Itanium architecture in 1998. As a result, MIPS was spun out as an intellectual property licensing company, offering licences to the MIPS architecture as well as microprocessor core designs.

On June 30, 1998, MIPS held an IPO after raising about with an offering price of a share. In 1999, SGI announced it would overhaul its operations; it planned to continue introducing new MIPS processors until 2002, but its server business would include Intel&#x27;s processor architectures as well. SGI spun MIPS out completely on June 20, 2000, by distributing all its interest as stock dividend to the stockholders.

In early 2008 MIPS laid off 28 employees from its processor business group. On August 13, 2008, MIPS announced a loss of $108.5 million for their fiscal fourth-quarter and that they would lay off another 15% of their workforce. At the time MIPS had 512 employees. In May 2018, according to the company&#x27;s presence on LinkedIn, there may be less than 50 employees.

=== Notable Contributors ===
Notable people who have worked at MIPS include James Billmaier, Steve Blank, Joseph DiNucci, John L. Hennessy,
Todd Bezenek,
David Hitz, Earl Killian, Dan Levin, John Mashey, John P. McCaskey, Bob Miller, Stratton Sclavos, and Skip Stritter.

In 2010, Sandeep Vij was named CEO of MIPS Technologies. Vij studied under John Hennessy as a Stanford University graduate student. Prior to taking over at MIPS, Vij was an executive at Cavium Networks, Xilinx and Altera.

&quot;EE Times&quot; reported that MIPS had 150 employees as of November 1, 2010. If the August 14, 2008 EDN article was accurate about MIPS having over 500 employees at the time, then MIPS reduced their total workforce by 70% between 2008 and 2010.

In addition to its main R&amp;D center in Sunnyvale, California, MIPS has engineering facilities in Shanghai, China, Beaverton, Oregon, Bristol and Kings Langley, both in England. It also has offices in Hsin-chu, Taiwan; Tokyo, Japan; Remscheid, Germany and Haifa, Israel.

During the first quarter of 2013, 498 out of 580 of MIPS patents were sold to Bridge Crossing which was created by Allied Security Trust, with all processor-specific patents and the other parts of the company sold to Imagination Technologies. Imagination had outbid Ceva Inc to buy MIPS with an offer of $100 million, and was investing to develop the architecture for the embedded processor market.

In 2017, under financial pressure itself, Imagination Technologies sold the MIPS processor business to a California-based investment company, Tallwood Venture Capital. Tallwood in turn sold the business to Wave Computing in 2018, both of these companies reportedly having their origins with, or ownership links to, a co-founder of Chips and Technologies and S3 Graphics. Despite the regulatory obstacles that had forced Imagination to divest itself of the MIPS business prior to its own acquisition by Canyon Bridge, bankruptcy proceedings for Wave Computing indicated that the company had in 2018 and 2019 transferred full licensing rights for the MIPS architecture for China, Hong Kong and Macau to CIP United, a Shanghai-based company.

In 2021, MIPS announced it would begin making chips based on the RISC-V architecture. In 2022, the company announced availability of its first RISC-V CPU IP core, the eVocore P8700.

In September 2023, MIPS named former Texas Instruments (TI) executive Sameer Wasson CEO. Wasson spent 18 years at TI, most recently as vice president, Business Unit (BU) Manager, Processors.

===Company timeline===
==Products==

MIPS Technologies created the processor architecture that is licensed to chip makers. Before the acquisition, the company had 125+ licensees who ship more than 500 million MIPS-based processors each year.

MIPS processor architectures and cores are used in home entertainment, networking and communications products. The company licensed its 32- and 64-bit architectures as well as 32-bit cores.

The MIPS32 architecture is a high-performance 32-bit instruction set architecture (ISA) that is used in applications such as 32-bit microcontrollers, home entertainment, home networking devices and mobile designs. MIPS customers license the architecture to develop their own processors or license off-the-shelf cores from MIPS that are based on the architecture.

The MIPS64 architecture is a high performance 64-bit instruction set architecture that is widely used in networking infrastructure equipment through MIPS licensees such as Cavium Networks and Broadcom.

SmartCE (Connected Entertainment) is a reference platform that integrates Android, Adobe Flash platform for TV, Skype, the Home Jinni ConnecTV application and other applications. SmartCE lets OEM customers create integrated products more quickly.

===MIPS processor core families===

The MIPS processor cores are divided by Imagination into three major families:
* Warrior: hardware virtualization, hardware multi-threading, and SIMD
** M-class: M5100 and M5150, M6200 and M6250
** I-class: I6400, I7200
** P-class: P5600, P6600
* Aptiv: &quot;microAptiv&quot; (compact, real-time embedded processor core), &quot;interAptiv&quot; (multiprocessor, multi-threaded core with a nine-stage pipeline), &quot;proAptiv&quot; (super-scalar, deeply out-of-order processor core with high CoreMark/MHz score)
* Classic. 4K, M14K, 24K, 34K, 74K, 1004K (multicore and multithreaded) and 1074K (superscalar and multithreaded) families.

=== MIPS eVocore RISC-V CPU IP cores ===
The MIPS eVocore CPUs are the first RISC-V CPU IP cores from MIPS. Both cores provide support for privileged hardware virtualization, user defined custom extensions, multi-threading, hybrid debug, and functional safety. They include:

* eVocore P8700: multiprocessing system combining a deep pipeline with multi-issue out-of-order (OOO) execution and multi-threading. It can scale up to 64 clusters, 512 cores and 1,024 harts/threads.
* eVocore I8500: in-order multiprocessing system. Each core combines multi-threading and a triple-issue pipeline.

==Licensees==
MIPS Technologies had a strong customer licensee base in home electronics and portable media players; for example, 75 percent of Blu-ray Disc players were running on MIPS Technologies processors. In the digital home, the company&#x27;s processors were predominantly found in digital TVs and set-top boxes. The Sony PlayStation Portable used two processors based on the MIPS32 4K processor.

Within the networking segment, licensees include Cavium Networks and Broadcom. Cavium has used up to 48 MIPS cores for its OCTEON family network reference designs. Broadcom ships Linux-ready MIPS64-based XLP, XLR, and XLS multicore, multithreaded processors. Licensees using MIPS to build smartphones and tablets include Actions Semiconductor and Ingenic Semiconductor. Tablets based on MIPS include the Cruz tablets from Velocity Micro. TCL Corporation is using MIPS processors for the development of smartphones.

Companies can also obtain an MIPS &quot;architectural licence&quot; for designing their own CPU cores using the MIPS architecture. Distinct MIPS architecture implementations by licensees include Broadcom&#x27;s BRCM 5000.

Other licensees include Broadcom, which has developed MIPS-based CPUs for over a decade, Microchip Technology, which leverages MIPS processors for its 32-bit PIC32 microcontrollers, Qualcomm Atheros, MediaTek and Mobileye, whose EyeQ chips are based on cores licensed from MIPS.

The first announced licensee for MIPS&#x27; RISC-V CPUs is Mobileye, who adopted the MIPS eVocore P8700 for autonomous driving SoCs.

==Operating systems==
MIPS is widely supported by Unix-like systems, including Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD.

Google&#x27;s processor-agnostic Android operating system is built on the Linux kernel. MIPS originally ported Android to its architecture for embedded products beyond the mobile handset, where it was originally targeted by Google but MIPS support was dropped in 2018. In 2010, MIPS and its licensee Sigma Designs announced the world&#x27;s first Android set-top boxes. By porting to Android, MIPS processors power smartphones and tablets running on the Android operating system.

OpenWrt is an embedded operating system based on the Linux kernel.
While it currently runs on a variety of processor architectures,
it was originally developed for the Linksys WRT54G, which used a 32-bit MIPS processor from Broadcom.
The OpenWrt Table of Hardware now includes MIPS-based devices from Atheros, Broadcom, Cavium, Lantiq, MediaTek, etc.

Real-time operating systems that run on MIPS include CMX Systems, eCosCentric&#x27;s eCos, ENEA OSE, Express Logic&#x27;s ThreadX, FreeRTOS, Green Hills Software&#x27;s Integrity, LynuxWorks&#x27; LynxOS, Mentor Graphics, Micrium&#x27;s Micro-Controller Operating Systems (μC/OS), QNX Software Systems&#x27; QNX, Quadros Systems Inc.&#x27;s RTXC Quadros RTOS, Segger&#x27;s embOS and Wind River&#x27;s VxWorks.

<doc id="20683" wikidata="Q55813" url="?curid=20683" title="Machine code">
<text>In computer programming, machine code is computer code consisting of machine language instructions, which are used to control a computer&#x27;s central processing unit (CPU). For conventional binary computers, machine code is the binary representation of a computer program which is actually read and interpreted by the computer. A program in machine code consists of a sequence of machine instructions (possibly interspersed with data).

Each machine code instruction causes the CPU to perform a specific task. Examples of such tasks include:
# Load a word from memory to a CPU register
# Execute an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) operation on one or more registers or memory locations
# Jump or skip to an instruction that is not the next one

In general, each architecture family (e.g., x86, ARM) has its own instruction set architecture (ISA), and hence its own specific machine code language. There are exceptions, such as the VAX architecture, which includes optional support of the PDP-11 instruction set; the IA-64 architecture, which includes optional support of the IA-32 instruction set; and the PowerPC 615 microprocessor, which can natively process both PowerPC and x86 instruction sets.

Machine code is a strictly numerical language, and it is the lowest-level interface to the CPU intended for a programmer. Assembly language provides a direct map between the numerical machine code and a human-readable mnemonic. In assembly, numerical opcodes and operands are replaced with mnemonics and labels. For example, the x86 architecture has available the 0x90 opcode; it is represented as NOP in the assembly source code. While it is possible to write programs directly in machine code, managing individual bits and calculating numerical addresses is tedious and error-prone. Therefore, programs are rarely written directly in machine code. However, an existing machine code program may be edited if the assembly source code is not available.

The majority of programs today are written in a high-level language. A high-level program may be translated into machine code by a compiler.

==Instruction set==
Every processor or processor family has its own instruction set. Instructions are patterns of bits, digits, or characters that correspond to machine commands. Thus, the instruction set is specific to a class of processors using (mostly) the same architecture. Successor or derivative processor designs often include instructions of a predecessor and may add new additional instructions. Occasionally, a successor design will discontinue or alter the meaning of some instruction code (typically because it is needed for new purposes), affecting code compatibility to some extent; even compatible processors may show slightly different behavior for some instructions, but this is rarely a problem. Systems may also differ in other details, such as memory arrangement, operating systems, or peripheral devices. Because a program normally relies on such factors, different systems will typically not run the same machine code, even when the same type of processor is used.

A processor&#x27;s instruction set may have fixed-length or variable-length instructions. How the patterns are organized varies with the particular architecture and type of instruction. Most instructions have one or more opcode fields that specify the basic instruction type (such as arithmetic, logical, jump, etc.), the operation (such as add or compare), and other fields that may give the type of the operand(s), the addressing mode(s), the addressing offset(s) or index, or the operand value itself (such constant operands contained in an instruction are called &quot;immediate&quot;).

Not all machines or individual instructions have explicit operands. On a machine with a single accumulator, the accumulator is implicitly both the left operand and result of most arithmetic instructions. Some other architectures, such as the x86 architecture, have accumulator versions of common instructions, with the accumulator regarded as one of the general registers by longer instructions. A stack machine has most or all of its operands on an implicit stack. Special purpose instructions also often lack explicit operands; for example, CPUID in the x86 architecture writes values into four implicit destination registers. This distinction between explicit and implicit operands is important in code generators, especially in the register allocation and live range tracking parts. A good code optimizer can track implicit and explicit operands which may allow more frequent constant propagation, constant folding of registers (a register assigned the result of a constant expression freed up by replacing it by that constant) and other code enhancements.

==Assembly languages==
A much more human-friendly rendition of machine language, named assembly language, uses mnemonic codes to refer to machine code instructions, rather than using the instructions&#x27; numeric values directly, and uses symbolic names to refer to storage locations and sometimes registers. For example, on the Zilog Z80 processor, the machine code codice_1, which causes the CPU to decrement the codice_2 general-purpose register, would be represented in assembly language as codice_3.

==Examples==
===IBM 709x===
The IBM 704, 709, 704x and 709x store one instruction in each instruction word; IBM numbers the bit from the left as S, 1, ..., 35. Most instructions have one of two formats:

;Generic
:S,1-11
:12-13 Flag, ignored in some instructions
:14-17 unused
:18-20 Tag
:21-35 Y

;Index register control, other than TSX
:S,1-2 Opcode
:3-17 Decrement
:18-20 Tag
:21-35 Y

For all but the IBM 7094 and 7094 II, there are three index registers designated A, B and C; indexing with multiple 1 bits in the tag subtracts the logical or of the selected index registers and loading with multiple 1 bits in the tag loads all of the selected index registers. The 7094 and 7094 II have seven index registers, but when they are powered on they are in &quot;multiple tag mode&quot;, in which they use only the three of the index registers in a fashion compatible with earlier machines, and require a Leave Multiple Tag Mode (LMTM) instruction in order to access the other four index registers.

The effective address is normally Y-C(T), where C(T) is either 0 for a tag of 0, the logical or of the selected index registers in multiple tag mode or the selected index register if not in multiple tag mode. However, the effective address for index register control instructions is just Y.

A flag with both bits 1 selects indirect addressing; the indirect address word has both a tag and a Y field.

In addition to &quot;transfer&quot; (branch) instructions, these machines have skip instruction that conditionally skip one or two words, e.g., Compare Accumulator with Storage (CAS) does a three way compare and conditionally skips to NSI, NSI+1 or NSI+2, depending on the result.

===MIPS===
The MIPS architecture provides a specific example for a machine code whose instructions are always 32 bits long. The general type of instruction is given by the &quot;op&quot; (operation) field, the highest 6 bits. J-type (jump) and I-type (immediate) instructions are fully specified by &quot;op&quot;. R-type (register) instructions include an additional field &quot;funct&quot; to determine the exact operation. The fields used in these types are:

 6 5 5 5 5 6 bits
 [ op | rs | rt | rd |shamt| funct] R-type
 [ op | rs | rt | address/immediate] I-type
 [ op | target address ] J-type

&quot;rs&quot;, &quot;rt&quot;, and &quot;rd&quot; indicate register operands; &quot;shamt&quot; gives a shift amount; and the &quot;address&quot; or &quot;immediate&quot; fields contain an operand directly.

For example, adding the registers 1 and 2 and placing the result in register 6 is encoded:

==Overlapping instructions==

On processor architectures with variable-length instruction sets (such as Intel&#x27;s x86 processor family) it is, within the limits of the control-flow resynchronizing phenomenon known as the Kruskal count, sometimes possible through opcode-level programming to deliberately arrange the resulting code so that two code paths share a common fragment of opcode sequences. These are called &quot;overlapping instructions&quot;, &quot;overlapping opcodes&quot;, &quot;overlapping code&quot;, &quot;overlapped code&quot;, &quot;instruction scission&quot;, or &quot;jump into the middle of an instruction&quot;.

In the 1970s and 1980s, overlapping instructions were sometimes used to preserve memory space. One example were in the implementation of error tables in Microsoft&#x27;s Altair BASIC, where &quot;interleaved instructions&quot; mutually shared their instruction bytes. The technique is rarely used today, but might still be necessary to resort to in areas where extreme optimization for size is necessary on byte-level such as in the implementation of boot loaders which have to fit into boot sectors.

It is also sometimes used as a code obfuscation technique as a measure against disassembly and tampering.

The principle is also used in shared code sequences of fat binaries which must run on multiple instruction-set-incompatible processor platforms.

This property is also used to find unintended instructions called gadgets in existing code repositories and is used in return-oriented programming as alternative to code injection for exploits such as return-to-libc attacks.

==Relationship to microcode==

In some computers, the machine code of the architecture is implemented by an even more fundamental underlying layer called microcode, providing a common machine language interface across a line or family of different models of computer with widely different underlying dataflows. This is done to facilitate porting of machine language programs between different models. An example of this use is the IBM System/360 family of computers and their successors.

==Relationship to bytecode==
Machine code is generally different from bytecode (also known as p-code), which is either executed by an interpreter or itself compiled into machine code for faster (direct) execution. An exception is when a processor is designed to use a particular bytecode directly as its machine code, such as is the case with Java processors.

Machine code and assembly code are sometimes called &quot;native code&quot; when referring to platform-dependent parts of language features or libraries.

==Storing in memory==

From the point of view of the CPU, machine code is stored in RAM, but is typically also kept in a set of caches for performance reasons. There may be different caches for instructions and data, depending on the architecture.

The CPU knows what machine code to execute, based on its internal program counter. The program counter points to a memory address and is changed based on special instructions which may cause programmatic branches. The program counter is typically set to a hard coded value when the CPU is first powered on, and will hence execute whatever machine code happens to be at this address.

Similarly, the program counter can be set to execute whatever machine code is at some arbitrary address, even if this is not valid machine code. This will typically trigger an architecture specific protection fault.

The CPU is oftentimes told, by page permissions in a paging based system, if the current page actually holds machine code by an execute bit — pages have multiple such permission bits (readable, writable, etc.) for various housekeeping functionality. E.g. on Unix-like systems memory pages can be toggled to be executable with the system call, and on Windows, can be used to achieve a similar result. If an attempt is made to execute machine code on a non-executable page, an architecture specific fault will typically occur. Treating data as machine code, or finding new ways to use existing machine code, by various techniques, is the basis of some security vulnerabilities.

Similarly, in a segment based system, segment descriptors can indicate whether a segment can contain executable code and in what rings that code can run.

From the point of view of a process, the &quot;code space&quot; is the part of its address space where the code in execution is stored. In multitasking systems this comprises the program&#x27;s code segment and usually shared libraries. In multi-threading environment, different threads of one process share code space along with data space, which reduces the overhead of context switching considerably as compared to process switching.

==Readability by humans==
Machine code can be seen as a set of electrical pulses that make the instructions readable to the computer; it is not readable by humans, with Douglas Hofstadter comparing it to examining the atoms of a DNA molecule. However, various tools and methods exist to decode machine code to human-readable source code. One such method is disassembly, which easily decodes it back to its corresponding assembly language source code because assembly language forms a one-to-one mapping to machine code.

Machine code may also be decoded to high-level language under two conditions. The first condition is to accept an obfuscated reading of the source code. An obfuscated version of source code is displayed if the machine code is sent to a decompiler of the source language. The second condition requires the machine code to have information about the source code encoded within. The information includes a symbol table that contains debug symbols. The symbol table may be stored within the executable, or it may exist in separate files. A debugger can then read the symbol table to help the programmer interactively debug the machine code in execution.

* The SHARE Operating System (1959) for the IBM 709, IBM 7090, and IBM 7094 computers allowed for an loadable code format named SQUOZE. SQUOZE was a compressed binary form of assembly language code and included a symbol table.
* Modern IBM mainframe operating systems, such as z/OS, have available a symbol table named &quot;Associated data&quot; (ADATA). The table is stored in a file that can be produced by the IBM High-Level Assembler (HLASM), IBM&#x27;s COBOL compiler, and IBM&#x27;s PL/I compiler, either as a separate SYSADATA file or as ADATA records in a Generalized object output file (GOFF).
* Microsoft Windows has available a symbol table that is stored in a program database (codice_4) file.
* Most Unix-like operating systems have available symbol table formats named stabs and DWARF. In macOS and other Darwin-based operating systems, the debug symbols are stored in DWARF format in a separate codice_5 file.

<doc id="20684" wikidata="Q71486" url="?curid=20684" title="Instructions per second">
<text>Instructions per second (IPS) is a measure of a computer&#x27;s processor speed. For complex instruction set computers (CISCs), different instructions take different amounts of time, so the value measured depends on the instruction mix; even for comparing processors in the same family the IPS measurement can be problematic. Many reported IPS values have represented &quot;peak&quot; execution rates on artificial instruction sequences with few branches and no cache contention, whereas realistic workloads typically lead to significantly lower IPS values. Memory hierarchy also greatly affects processor performance, an issue barely considered in IPS calculations. Because of these problems, synthetic benchmarks such as Dhrystone are now generally used to estimate computer performance in commonly used applications, and raw IPS has fallen into disuse.

The term is commonly used in association with a metric prefix (k, M, G, T, P, or E) to form kilo instructions per second (kIPS), mega instructions per second (MIPS), giga instructions per second (GIPS) and so on. Formerly TIPS was used occasionally for &quot;thousand IPS&quot;.

==Computing==
IPS can be calculated using this equation:

:formula_1

However, the instructions/cycle measurement depends on the instruction sequence, the data and external factors.

==Thousand instructions per second (TIPS/kIPS)==
Before standard benchmarks were available, average speed rating of computers was based on calculations for a mix of instructions with the results given in kilo instructions per second (kIPS). The most famous was the Gibson Mix, produced by Jack Clark Gibson of IBM for scientific applications in 1959. 
Other ratings, such as the ADP mix which does not include floating point operations, were produced for commercial applications. The thousand instructions per second (kIPS) unit is rarely used today, as most current microprocessors can execute at least a million instructions per second.

===The Gibson Mix===
Gibson divided computer instructions into 12 classes, based on the IBM 704 architecture, adding a 13th class to account for indexing time. Weights were primarily based on analysis of seven scientific programs run on the 704, with a small contribution from some IBM 650 programs. The overall score was then the weighted sum of the average execution speed for instructions in each class.

== Millions of instructions per second (MIPS)==

The speed of a given CPU depends on many factors, such as the type of instructions being executed, the execution order and the presence of branch instructions (problematic in CPU pipelines). CPU instruction rates are different from clock frequencies, usually reported in Hz, as each instruction may require several clock cycles to complete or the processor may be capable of executing multiple independent instructions simultaneously. MIPS can be useful when comparing performance between processors made with similar architecture (e.g. Microchip branded microcontrollers), but they are difficult to compare between differing CPU architectures. This led to the term &quot;Meaningless Indicator of Processor Speed,&quot; or less commonly, &quot;Meaningless Indices of Performance,&quot; being popular amongst technical people by the mid-1980s.

For this reason, MIPS has become not a measure of instruction execution speed, but task performance speed compared to a reference. In the late 1970s, minicomputer performance was compared using &quot;VAX MIPS&quot;, where computers were measured on a task and their performance rated against the VAX-11/780 that was marketed as a &quot;1 MIPS&quot; machine. (The measure was also known as the &quot;VAX Unit of Performance&quot; or VUP.) This was chosen because the 11/780 was roughly equivalent in performance to an IBM System/370 model 158–3, which was commonly accepted in the computing industry as running at 1 MIPS.

Many minicomputer performance claims were based on the Fortran version of the Whetstone benchmark, giving Millions of Whetstone Instructions Per Second (MWIPS). The VAX 11/780 with FPA (1977) runs at 1.02 MWIPS.

Effective MIPS speeds are highly dependent on the programming language used. The Whetstone Report has a table showing MWIPS speeds of PCs via early interpreters and compilers up to modern languages. The first PC compiler was for BASIC (1982) when a 4.8 MHz 8088/87 CPU obtained 0.01 MWIPS. Results on a 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo (1 CPU 2007) vary from 9.7 MWIPS using BASIC Interpreter, 59 MWIPS via BASIC Compiler, 347 MWIPS using 1987 Fortran, 1,534 MWIPS through HTML/Java to 2,403 MWIPS using a modern C/C++ compiler.

For the most early 8-bit and 16-bit microprocessors, performance was measured in thousand instructions per second (1000 kIPS = 1 MIPS).

&quot;zMIPS&quot; refers to the MIPS measure used internally by IBM to rate its mainframe servers (zSeries, IBM System z9, and IBM System z10).

&quot;Weighted million operations per second (WMOPS)&quot; is a similar measurement, used for audio codecs.

<doc id="20685" wikidata="Q4927524" url="?curid=20685" title="Michael (given name)">
<text>Michael is a common masculine given name derived from the Hebrew phrase &quot;mī kāʼēl&quot;, &#x27;Who [is] like-El&#x27;, in Aramaic: ܡܝܟܐܝܠ (&quot;Mīkhāʼēl&quot; ). The theophoric name is often read as a rhetorical question – &quot;Who [is] like [the Hebrew God] El?&quot;, whose answer is &quot;there is none like El&quot;, or &quot;there is none as famous and powerful as God.&quot; This question is known in Latin as &quot;Quis ut Deus?&quot; Paradoxically, the name is also sometimes interpreted as, &quot;One who is like God.&quot;

An alternative spelling of the name is &quot;Micheal&quot;. While &quot;Michael&quot; is most often a masculine name, it is also given to women, such as the actresses Michael Michele and Michael Learned, and Michael Steele, the former bassist for the Bangles.

Patronymic surnames that come from Michael include &quot;Carmichael, DiMichele, MacMichael, McMichael, Michaels, Micallef, Michaelson, Michiels, Michalka, Michels, Miguélez, Mihály, Mikeladze, Mikhaylov, Mikkelsen, Mitchell, Michalski, Mykhaylenko&quot; and &quot;Mikaelyan&quot;.

== Religion ==
=== Judaism ===
The name first appears in the Hebrew Bible in the Book of Numbers , where Sethur the son of Michael is one of 12 spies sent into the Land of Canaan.

&quot;Michael&quot; is the name of an archangel in the Book of Daniel .

=== Christianity ===
The archangel Michael is venerated in the Roman Catholic Church, the Oriental Orthodox Church, and the Eastern Orthodox Church. For the Roman Catholic Church, 29 September is the feast day of the three archangels: Michael, Gabriel and Raphael. For the Orthodox Church, 8 November is the feast day commemorating the archangels Michael and Gabriel, as well as the whole host of angels, while the Monday of each liturgical week likewise corresponds to the &quot;Bodiless Powers.&quot; In the Coptic Orthodox Church, his main feast days are 12 Hathor and 12 Paoni, with lesser feast days on the 12th day of each month of the Coptic calendar.

=== Islam ===
According to Islam, Michael (Mika&#x27;el) is an archangel who brings down rain to the earth by the decree of Allah. He was created from light and the one entrusted with the sustenance of creatures, and is also one of the most prominent angels. As the Angel of Mercy, he asks Allah to forgive people’s sins.

== Popularity ==
Michael (and its variants) is one of the most common given names for men in the world. In the United States, Michael was the most popular name of the 20th century, ranking No. 1 from 1954 to 1998 (with the exception of 1960, when it was second to David). It was among the top three most popular names for each year since 1953, only falling out of the top five in 2011 for the first time since 1949. Michael is the only name to rank among the ten most popular across all four generations since Generation X.

In 2014, Michael was the 20th most popular name in Northern Ireland, 27th in Canada and 42nd in Australia. In England and Wales, Michael ranked 53rd in 2011 and 2012. Michael ranked as the eighth most popular name for boys in Ireland in 2013.

According to the SSA, Michael is the most popular name among people in the United States who are currently alive, belonging to an estimated 3.83 million living people as of 2021. 

Variants of Michael rank among the most popular masculine names in multiple countries. It was the third most popular in Finland from 2010 – March 2015 (as Mikael), seventh in Russia in 2009 (as Mikhail), 14th in Spain in 2012 (as Miguel), and 15th in Denmark (as Mikkel).

<doc id="20690" wikidata="Q410441" url="?curid=20690" title="Modafinil">
<text>Modafinil, sold under the brand name Provigil among others, is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant and eugeroic (wakefulness promoter) medication used primarily to treat narcolepsy, a sleep disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and sudden sleep attacks. Modafinil is also approved for stimulating wakefulness in people with sleep apnea and shift work sleep disorder. It is taken by mouth. Modafinil is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in people under 17 years old.
Common side effects of Modafinil include anxiety, insomnia, dizziness, and headache. Modafinil has potential for causing severe allergic reactions, psychiatric effects, hypersensitivity, adverse interactions with prescription drugs, and misuse or abuse. Modafinil may harm the fetus if taken during or two months prior to pregnancy.
While modafinil is used as a cognitive enhancer, or &quot;smart drug&quot;, among healthy individuals seeking improved focus and productivity, its use outside medical supervision raises concerns regarding potential misuse or abuse. Research on the cognitive enhancement effects of modafinil in non-sleep deprived individuals has yielded mixed results, with some studies suggesting modest improvements in attention and executive functions, while others show no significant benefits or even a decline in cognitive functions at high doses.
==Uses==
===Medical===
====Sleep disorders====
Modafinil, a eugeroic or wakefulness-promoting drug, is primarily used for treating narcolepsy, a sleep disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and sudden sleep attacks. Being a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant itself, modafinil has lower addictive potential than classical stimulants such as amphetamine, cocaine, or methylphenidate, but still produces psychoactive and subjective effects typical of classical stimulants.

Narcolepsy causes a strong urge to sleep during the day and can include symptoms like cataplexy (sudden muscle weakness), sleep paralysis (inability to move or speak while falling asleep or waking up), and hallucinations. Narcolepsy is linked to a lack of the brain chemical hypocretin (orexin), primarily produced in the hypothalamus. Modafinil is not a cure for narcolepsy, but it can help manage the symptoms. While modafinil is primarily used to treat excessive sleepiness, it may also help reduce the frequency and severity of cataplexy attacks in some people. Modafinil is approved for management of narcolepsy with or without cataplexy. However, it is not specifically approved for the treatment of cataplexy.

Modafinil is also prescribed for shift work sleep disorder.

Modafinil performs moderately (but better than armodafinil or solriamfetol) as a drug to overcome excessive daytime sleepiness caused by obstructive sleep apnea, though it is recommended that people with apnea use continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, that is a sleep breathing apparatus to prevent apnea, before starting modafinil. When obstructive sleep apnea is comorbid with narcolepsy, modafinil is an effective drug to reduce the associated excessive daytime sleepiness.

Modafinil&#x27;s use varies by region. In the US, it is approved for adult narcolepsy, shift work sleep disorder, and obstructive sleep apnea, but not for children. In the UK and the EU, since 2014, it is approved solely for narcolepsy, including in children (pediatric narcolepsy), with its use for other conditions restricted by the European Medicines Agency.

 both the French and the American Academy of Sleep Medicine strongly recommend modafinil as the first-choice treatment for narcolepsy. In Europe, modafinil is considered one of the primary drugs recommended for treating narcolepsy according to the guidelines.

====Multiple sclerosis-related fatigue====
The UK&#x27;s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), and the US&#x27;s National Multiple Sclerosis Society, endorsed the off-label use of modafinil to alleviate fatigue associated with MS in 2022.

MS-related fatigue is a common and often debilitating symptom experienced by people with multiple sclerosis. It can significantly impact their daily functioning, quality of life, and ability to perform everyday activities. When prescribed for MS-related fatigue management, modafinil works by promoting wakefulness and increasing alertness without causing drowsiness or disrupting nighttime sleep. People with multiple sclerosis often report increased energy levels, reduced feelings of tiredness, improved cognitive function, and an overall improvement in their quality of life when taking modafinil. While modafinil can provide relief from MS-related fatigue symptoms, it does not treat the underlying cause or cure MS itself. The primary goal of using modafinil in MS is symptom management and improving daily functioning. The effects of modafinil on other aspects of MS-related fatigue, such as severity and cognitive function, are less clear.

Modafinil has been shown to have minor and barely statistically significant effectiveness in managing fatigue in people with MS, and optimal dosing and treatment schedules are not well established. A 2023 Evidence Update for Clinicians on Treatments for Multiple Sclerosis-Related Fatigue found that adverse events were common.

====Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder====

Modafinil is occasionally prescribed off-label for individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It has not consistently shown efficacy in treating adult ADHD, especially when compared to other treatments such as lisdexamfetamine. In children, modafinil is efficient in treating ADHD symptoms.

Given its approved status in the US to treat narcolepsy, physicians can also prescribe modafinil for off-label uses, such as treating ADHD in both children and adults.

The Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) suggests modafinil as a second-line choice for ADHD, after the first-line choices such as bupropion are exhausted.

====Bipolar disorder====
Modafinil is used off-label as an adjunctive treatment (i.e., in combination therapy) for the acute depressive phase in bipolar disorder. The depressive phase of bipolar disorder may feature excessive sleepiness and fatigue. Adjunctive treatment with modafinil can be used as an augmentation for the main treatment to increase its effect and is safe and effective, especially for people who do not respond well to standard antidepressants. Modafinil does not significantly increase the risk of mood switch to mania or suicide attempts in people with bipolar disorder. Modafinil may also have cognitive benefits in people with bipolar disorder who are in a remission state.

Whereas modafinil and armodafinil are approved for narcolepsy, they have been repurposed as adjunctive treatments to alleviate symptoms of acute depressive phase in people with bipolar disorder. Drug repurposing in psychiatry is a strategy for discovering new uses for drugs that have already been approved or tested in clinical trials for other illnesses. As such, drug repurposing is a rapid, cost-effective, and reduced-risk strategy for the development of new treatment options for psychiatric disorders. 2021 meta-analysis concluded that add-on modafinil and armodafinil were more effective than placebo on response to treatment, clinical remission, and reduction in depressive symptoms, with only minor side effects, but the effect sizes are small and the quality of evidence is therefore low, limiting the clinical relevance of the evidence. Very low rates of mood swing (a change in mood from one extreme to another) have been observed with modafinil and armodafinil in depressive phase of bipolar disorder.

===Occupational===
Modafinil was used during the Gulf War by the French Foreign Legion, the US Air Force, and US Marine infantry to enhance &quot;operational tempo&quot; (a term that denotes the speed and intensity at which military operations or activities are executed), aiming to optimize the overall performance and efficiency of the units.

Armed forces in various countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, India, and France, have considered modafinil as an alternative to traditional amphetamines for managing sleep deprivation in combat or extended missions. The US military approved modafinil for specific Air Force missions, replacing amphetamines for fatigue management. The use of modafinil in military contexts without sleep deprivation is not recommended due to inconclusive evidence on its cognitive enhancement benefits and potential risks of adverse effects.

Modafinil is also available to astronauts aboard the International Space Station for the management of fatigue caused by circadian dyssynchrony in orbit.

===Non-medical===
Modafinil has been used non-medically as a &quot;smart drug&quot; by various groups, including students, office workers, transhumanists, and professionals in various sectors. Its use is attributed by these individuals to its potential for enhancing attention, cognitive capabilities, and alertness.

The effectiveness of modafinil as a cognitive enhancer is still debated. Some studies suggest significant increases in cognitive abilities, while others indicate mild to nonexistent cognitive improvements. In some cases, it has even been associated with impairments in certain cognitive functions. It has been shown that modafinil&#x27;s positive impact on cognitive abilities is more noticeable on sleep-deprived individuals. Therefore, in people who are not sleep-deprived, the potential of modafinil as a cognitive enhancer may be limited.

==Adverse effects==
Modafinil is generally well-tolerated but can have potential risks and side effects. Common adverse effects of modafinil, experienced by less than 10% of users, include headaches, nausea, and reduced appetite. Anxiety, insomnia, dizziness, diarrhea, and rhinitis are also reported in 5% to 10% of users. Psychiatric reactions have occurred in individuals with and without a preexisting psychiatric history. Urinary retention and paresthesia have also been reported.

No significant changes in body weight have been observed in clinical trials, although decreased appetite and weight loss have been noted in children and adolescents. Modafinil can cause a slight increase in aminotransferase enzymes, indicative of liver function, but there is no evidence of serious liver damage when levels are within reference ranges.

Rare but serious adverse effects include severe skin rashes and allergy-related symptoms. Between December 1998 and January 2007, the FDA received reports of six cases of severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including erythema multiforme, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and DRESS syndrome. The FDA has issued alerts regarding these risks and also noted reports of angioedema and multi-organ hypersensitivity reactions in postmarketing surveillance. In 2007, the FDA required Cephalon to modify the Provigil leaflet to include warnings about these serious conditions. The long-term safety and effectiveness of modafinil have not been conclusively established.

The FDA does not endorse modafinil for children&#x27;s medical conditions due to an increased risk of rare but serious dermatological toxicity, manifested as Stevens–Johnson syndrome which is a type of severe skin reaction. However, in Europe, modafinil may be prescribed for treating narcolepsy in children.

==Available forms==
Modafinil is commercially available in and oral tablet forms. Additionally, it is offered as the (&quot;R&quot;)-enantiomer, known as armodafinil, and as a prodrug named adrafinil.

==Contraindications==
Modafinil is contraindicated during pregnancy and 2 months before getting pregnant. Women who take modafinil should not become pregnant, and, additionally, should be aware that modafinil reduces effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives, increasing chances of getting pregnant. Modafinil therapy during pregnancy increases the risk of birth defects, such as with congenital torticollis, hypospadias, and congenital heart defects.

Modafinil is contraindicated for individuals with known hypersensitivity to either modafinil or armodafinil.

Modafinil is also contraindicated in certain cardiac conditions, including uncontrolled moderate to severe hypertension, arrhythmia, cor pulmonale, and in cases with signs of CNS stimulant-induced mitral valve prolapse or left ventricular hypertrophy. The package insert in the United States cautions about using modafinil in people with a documented medical history of left ventricular hypertrophy or those diagnosed with mitral valve prolapse who have previously exhibited symptoms associated with the mitral valve prolapse syndrome while undergoing treatment involving central nervous system stimulants. The reasons why modafinil is contraindicated in certain cardiac conditions are because modafinil affects the autonomic nervous system and, in particular, exerts significant effects on autonomic cardiovascular regulation, leading in some people to notable increases in heart rate and blood pressure. These substantial changes in the autonomic system warrant careful consideration when prescribing modafinil to people with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions. The increase in heart rate and blood pressure can worsen the symptoms of such pre-existing conditions as hypertension, arrhythmia, and cor pulmonale. These changes in the autonomic system induced by modafinil can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, and heart failure. Modafinil can stimulate the release of norepinephrine and epinephrine, hormones that activate the sympathetic nervous system. This can cause vasoconstriction, which is the narrowing of blood vessels, and increase the heart&#x27;s workload, which is not desired in people with pre-existing heart conditions. In particular, modafinil can worsen the consequences of mitral valve prolapse or left ventricular hypertrophy, which are structural abnormalities of the heart. These can affect the blood flow and oxygen delivery to the heart and other organs.

Modafinil is also contraindicated in people with congenital problems like galactose intolerance, lactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption.

==Drug tolerance==
Extensive clinical research has not demonstrated drug tolerance as a common adverse effect, even with therapeutic use extending up to 40 weeks. Drug tolerance in this context is defined as a reduction in response, to wakefulness-promoting and anti-fatigue properties of modafinil.

While modafinil is generally found to be safe and significant adverse effects are rare, including in pediatric narcolepsy cases (sleep disorders in children), there is evidence that long-term usage can lead to tolerance in some individuals. This necessitates higher doses to maintain the same level of cognitive enhancement or relief from sleepiness.

People with current or past substance addictions and those with a family history of addiction are particularly at risk for developing tolerance.

The mechanisms driving tolerance to modafinil, which may involve its impact on dopamine and norepinephrine levels in the brain, are not fully understood.

Repeated administration of modafinil for off-label use, such as increased alertness and cognitive-enhancing effects in sleep deprivation, can lead to drug tolerance, which means that the effectiveness of the drug may decrease over time. Still, modafinil therapy as a eugeroic agent to treat narcolepsy does not typically lead to drug tolerance, i.e., the effectiveness does not usually decrease on prolonged use, although individual responses may vary.

==Addiction and dependence==
Despite being a CNS stimulant, the addiction and dependence liabilities of modafinil are considered low. The exact mechanisms of action of modafinil are not known, and it is believed that pharmacological profile of modafinil is different from that of the classical stimulants such as cocaine or amphetamine. Although modafinil shares biochemical mechanisms with stimulant drugs, it is less likely to have mood-elevating properties. The similarities in effects with caffeine are not clearly established. Unlike other stimulants, modafinil does not induce a strong subjective feeling of pleasure or reward, which is commonly associated with euphoria, an intense feeling of well-being. Euphoria may be an indicator of a drug&#x27;s potential to be abused. Substance abuse is a compulsive and excessive use of the substance despite adverse consequences. In comparison to classical stimulants, modafinil exhibits a low propensity for abuse, as it lacks significantly expressed pleasurable or euphoric effects. Albeit to a lower degree than classical stimulants, modafinil still can produce psychoactive, euphoric, and subjective effects typical for abused stimulants.

Modafinil was not observed to promote overuse or misuse, even in people who have a history of cocaine addiction. Despite the initial belief that modafinil carried no abuse potential, emerging evidence suggests that it works at the same neurobiological mechanisms as other addictive stimulants. Consequently, there exists a potential risk of modafinil abuse, necessitating prudent consideration and caution when prescribing or using this medication. Modafinil exhibits a lower response on the amphetamine scale of the addiction research center inventory, suggesting reduced propensity for abuse compared to amphetamine.

The US Drug Enforcement Administration has classified modafinil as a Schedule IV controlled substance; the medicine is recognized for having valid medical uses with low addiction potential. The International Narcotics Control Board does not classify it as a narcotic or a psychotropic substance.

==Overdose==
An overdose of modafinil can lead to a range of symptoms and complications. Psychiatric symptoms may include psychosis, mania, hallucinations, and suicidal ideation, which can occur even in individuals without a history of mental illness and may persist after discontinuation of the drug. Neurological complications, such as seizures, tremors, dystonia, and dyskinesia, may arise from modafinil&#x27;s interaction with various neurotransmitter systems.

Allergic reactions such as rash, angioedema, anaphylaxis, and Stevens–Johnson syndrome may rarely be triggered by an immunological response to modafinil or its metabolites. Cardiovascular complications like hypertension, tachycardia, chest pain, and arrhythmias may also be observed due to modafinil&#x27;s sympathomimetic action.

In animal studies, the median lethal dose (LD50) of modafinil varies among species and depends on the route of administration. In mice and rats, the LD50 is approximately if administered via an injection, but the oral LD50 for rats is . The LD50 value for humans have not been established. Human clinical trials have involved total daily doses up to for 7–21 days. Acute one-time total overdoses up to have not been life-threatening but resulted in symptoms like agitation, insomnia, tremor, palpitations, and gastrointestinal disturbances.

The management of modafinil overdose involves supportive care, monitoring of vital signs, and treatment of specific complications. In cases of recent consumption, activated charcoal, gastric lavage, or hemodialysis may be used. There is no specific antidote for modafinil overdose. The main way to deal with modafinil overdose is supportive care, which includes sedating the patient and stabilizing their blood pressure, and muscle activity in case of manifestations such as agitation or tremor.

== Interactions ==
Some of the drugs that frequently interact with modafinil include aripiprazole (an antipsychotic), amphetamine (including its enantiomers and salts; stimulants), aspirin, diphenhydramine (an antihistamine), and others.

Modafinil is a weak to moderate inducer of CYP3A4 and a weak inhibitor of CYP2C19, enzymes of the cytochrome P450 group of enzymes. Modafinil also induces or inhibits other cytochrome P450 enzymes. One &quot;in vitro&quot; study predicts that modafinil may induce the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP2B6, as well as may inhibit CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. However, other in-vitro studies find no significant inhibition of CYP2C9. Modafinil may induce P-glycoprotein, which may affect drugs transported by P-glycoprotein, such as digoxin.
It was clinically found that modafinil affects pharmacodynamics of drugs which are metabolized by CYP3A4 and other enzymes of the cytochrome P450 family so that interactions of modafinil with these drugs were observed in real people, rather than being predicted in a lab setting. For instance, it was observed that induction of CYP3A4 by modafinil affects metabolism of the following medications and endogenous substances:
* opioids, such as methadone, hydrocodone, oxycodone, or fentanyl – modafinil may result in a drop in opioid plasma concentrations because of faster clearance of opioids by CYP3A4. If the patient is not monitored closely, reduced efficacy or withdrawal symptoms can occur.
* steroid hormones, such as estradiol, progesterone or cortisol. Modafinil may have an adverse effect on hormonal contraceptives (such as birth control pills, patches, etc.) for up to a month after discontinuation. Both modafinil and armodafinil in the United States and the United Kingdom come with package inserts that highlight the interaction between these medications and hormonal birth control. Modafinil may induce cytochrome P450 enzymes that are involved in the clearance of steroid hormones taken as hormonal contraceptives, reducing their effectiveness, which may lead to pregnancy despite taking the birth control medication. Besides steroid hormones, modafinil may affect pituitary gland hormones. In a 2006 study, a single dose of modafinil caused a decrease in blood prolactin levels, although it did not affect human growth hormone or thyroid-stimulating hormone. Since modafinil induces the activity of the CYP3A4 enzyme involved in cortisol clearance, modafinil may reduce the bioavailability of hydrocortisone. Therefore, it may be necessary to adjust the steroid substitution dose in people receiving modafinil, which is a CYP3A4-metabolism-inducing drug.

Hypertensive crises have been reported when armodafinil (one of modafinil&#x27;s enantiomers) has been taken with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) like tranylcypromine.

==Pharmacology==
===Pharmacodynamics===
The precise mechanism of action of modafinil for narcolepsy and other sleep disorders remains unclear. Although modafinil may have interactions with neurotransmitter systems, its exact mode of action is not fully understood.

From laboratory research, modafinil has little to no affinity for serotonin or norepinephrine transporters and does not directly interact with these systems. However, studies have shown that elevated concentrations of norepinephrine and serotonin can occur as an indirect effect following modafinil administration due to increased extracellular dopamine activity. Unlike traditional psychostimulant drugs, such as cocaine or amphetamine, modafinil shows low potential for causing euphoria due to differences in how it interacts with dopamine transporters at a cellular level.

In addition to its influence on dopaminergic pathways, modafinil may impact other neurotransmitter systems, such as orexin (hypocretin). Orexin neurons are involved in promoting wakefulness and regulating arousal states. Modafinil may increase signaling within hypothalamic orexin pathways, potentially contributing to its wake-promoting effects.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Cmax (peak levels) occurs approximately 2 to 3 hours after modafinil administration. Food slows the absorption of modafinil but does not affect the total area under the curve (AUC). &quot;In vitro&quot; measurements indicate that 60% of modafinil is bound to plasma proteins at clinical concentrations of the drug. This percentage changes very little when the concentration of modafinil is varied.

Renal excretion of unchanged modafinil usually accounts for less than 10% of an oral dose. This means that when modafinil is taken by mouth, that is the only approved route of administration, less than 10% of the drug is eliminated from the body through the urine without being metabolized by the liver or other organs. The rest of the drug is either metabolized or excreted through other routes, such as feces or bile.

The two major circulating metabolites of modafinil are modafinil acid (CRL-40467) and modafinil sulfone (CRL-41056). Both of these metabolites have been described as inactive, and neither appears to contribute to the wakefulness-promoting effects of modafinil. However, modafinil sulfone does appear to possess anticonvulsant effects, a property that it shares with modafinil.

Elimination half-life is in the range of 10 to 12 hours, subject to differences in sex, in cytochrome P450 genotypes, liver function and renal function. Modafinil is metabolized mainly in the liver, and its inactive metabolites are excreted in the urine. Urinary excretion of the unchanged drug is usually less than 10% but can range from 0% to as high as 18.7%, depending on the factors mentioned.

Modafinil exhibits sex-specific pharmacokinetic differences. It demonstrates higher bioavailability in women compared to men. The mean Cmax is higher in women than in men, vs. (p &lt; 0.05), following a single oral dose of modafinil. This difference persists even after adjusting for body weight ( vs. ). The clearance of modafinil is 30% higher in men than in women, and plasma concentrations after a single dose are significantly higher in women than in men. These sex-specific pharmacokinetic differences may have implications for the efficacy and safety of modafinil.

==Chemistry==
===Enantiomers===
Modafinil is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, armodafinil ((&quot;R&quot;)-modafinil) and esmodafinil ((&quot;S&quot;)-modafinil).

===Detection in body fluids===
Modafinil and/or its major metabolite, modafinil acid, may be quantified in plasma, serum, or urine to monitor dosage in those receiving the drug therapeutically, to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients, or to assist in the forensic investigation of a vehicular traffic violation. Instrumental techniques involving gas or liquid chromatography are usually employed for these purposes. In 2011, modafinil was not tested for by common drug screens (except for anti-doping screens) and is unlikely to cause false positives for other chemically unrelated drugs such as substituted amphetamines.

Reagent testing can screen for the presence of modafinil in samples.

===Structural analogs===
Many derivatives and structural analogs of modafinil have been synthesized. Examples include adrafinil, CE-123, fladrafinil (CRL-40941; fluorafinil), flmodafinil (CRL-40940; bisfluoromodafinil, lauflumide), RDS03-94, JJC8-088, modafiendz and modafinil sulfone (CRL-41056).

==History==
Modafinil was developed in France by neurophysiology professor Michel Jouvet and Lafon Laboratories. It is part of a series of benzhydryl sulfinyl compounds, including adrafinil, initially used as a treatment for narcolepsy in France in 1986. Modafinil, the primary metabolite of adrafinil, has been prescribed in France since 1994 under the name Modiodal, and in the United States since 1998 as Provigil. Unlike modafinil, adrafinil does not have FDA approval and was withdrawn from the French market in 2011.

The FDA approved modafinil in 1998 for narcolepsy treatment, and later for shift work sleep disorder and obstructive sleep apnea in 2003. It was approved in the UK in December 2002. In the United States, modafinil is marketed by Cephalon, who acquired the rights from Lafon and purchased the company in 2001.

Cephalon introduced armodafinil, the (&quot;R&quot;)-enantiomer of modafinil, in the United States in 2007. Generic versions of modafinil became available in the US in 2012 after extensive patent litigation.

==Society and culture==
Modafinil is not approved for use by children in multiple jurisdictions.

===Legal status===
==== Australia ====
In Australia, modafinil is considered to be a Schedule 4 prescription-only medicine. This means that it is a drug with a perceived low potential for abuse and low risk of dependence; still, the use of Schedule 4 drugs in Australia is restricted to those who have a valid prescription from a medical practitioner; import from abroad is illegal.

==== Canada ====
In Canada, modafinil is not specifically included in the lists of controlled drugs and substances specified within the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. However, it is classified as a Schedule F prescription drug. This means that modafinil can only be obtained legally with a valid prescription from a licensed health care practitioner in Canada, and the import of modafinil to Canada from other countries is subject to restrictions: importing prescription drugs without an import permit may result in the seizure of the drugs at the border, the refusal of entry of the drugs into Canada, or prosecution.

====China====
In mainland China, modafinil is strictly controlled like other stimulants such as amphetamines and methylphenidate. It is classified as Class I psychotropic drug. This classification means that modafinil is considered to have a high potential for abuse and dependence, and is therefore subject to strict regulation and control. As a result, modafinil is only available by prescription and cannot be purchased over the counter. In order to obtain a prescription for modafinil, a patient must have a valid medical reason for using the drug, such as narcolepsy or obstructive sleep apnea. Additionally, the prescription must be written by a licensed physician and filled at a licensed pharmacy. The use of modafinil for non-medical purposes, such as with the aim to improve cognitive performance or to stay awake for long periods of time, is strictly prohibited and can result in legal consequences.

====Europe====
In Denmark, modafinil is a prescription drug but not listed as a controlled substance. According to the Danish Medicines Agency, modafinil is approved for use in the treatment of narcolepsy, still, importing modafinil to Denmark is considered illegal without a valid prescription.

In Finland, modafinil is a prescription drug but not listed as a controlled substance. Finland is a member of the European Union, and it is illegal to import prescription medicine from outside the European Union unless the person has a valid prescription.

In the Republic of Moldova, modafinil is classified as a psychotropic drug (included in table III list 3 which is the list of psychotropic substances as defined by the Government of Moldova) and is available by prescription. Importation of modafinil may be considered illegal and subject to severe penalties, even if you have a prescription. For example, on June 29, 2017, Moldovan postal officers discovered 60 tablets of Modalert (200 mg modafinil tablets) in a parcel sent from India to a resident in Chișinău, Moldova. The prohibited substance was detected during a routine scan and was seized as illegal. The authorities were notified of the incident and the recipient was charged with criminal penalties. In the Transnistria region of Moldova, modafinil is completely prohibited, due to application of the legislation similar to that of Russia where modafinil is completely prohibited and is in the same list as narcotics. Possession or an attempt to bring modafinil to Transnistria potentially leads to imprisonment.

In Romania, modafinil is classified as a stimulant doping agent and is prohibited in sports competitions. In 2022, laws were passed making its importation or sale a felony, punishable by three to seven years in jail.&lt;ref name=&quot;LEGE 219 26/07/2021 – Portal Legislativ&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Simple possession for personal use may result in a fine and confiscation.

In Sweden, modafinil is classified as a schedule IV substance, which means that it is considered to have a low potential for abuse and a low risk of dependence. Still, possession is illegal without a prescription.

In the United Kingdom, it is not listed in Misuse of Drugs Act, so possession is not illegal, but a prescription is required.

====Mexico====
In Mexico, modafinil is not listed as a controlled substance, in the National Health Law, and can be purchased in pharmacies without prescription.

====Japan====
In Japan, modafinil is Schedule I psychotropic drug. This means that it is considered to have a high potential for abuse and dependence, and is therefore subject to strict regulations. The use of Schedule I drugs in Japan is generally prohibited, except under certain circumstances, such as for medical purposes. It can only be prescribed by a doctor. It cannot be imported or exported without a permit. It cannot be used while driving or operating machinery. Cephalon licensed Alfresa Corporation to produce, and Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma to sell modafinil products under the trade name Modiodal in Japan. There have been arrests of people who imported modafinil for personal use.

====Russia====
In Russia, starting from May 18, 2012, modafinil is Schedule II controlled substance. Being classified as a Schedule II controlled substance in Russia means that it is seen as a drug with a high potential for abuse and dependence. This classification imposes strict regulations on the production, distribution, and use of modafinil. Possession of a few modafinil pills can lead to three to ten years imprisonment. Modafinil is not approved for medical use in Russia and cannot be bought even in pharmacies. It also cannot be imported from abroad, even if you have a prescription issued outside Russia. There are multiple cases of criminal proceedings initiated against Russian residents who tried to import modafinil by mail from abroad.

====South Africa====
In South Africa, modafinil is Schedule V substance, which means that it is legal to use modafinil in South Africa, but only with a valid prescription from a licensed medical practitioner.

====United States====
In the United States, modafinil is classified as a schedule IV controlled substance under US federal law. This means that the drug has a low potential for abuse and dependence compared to other controlled substances. However, it still requires a prescription from a licensed healthcare provider to obtain.

It is illegal to import modafinil to the United States without a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)–registered importer and a prescription. Individuals may legally bring modafinil into the US from a foreign country for personal use, limited to 50 dosage units, with a prescription and proper declaration at the border. Under the Pure Food and Drug Act, marketing drugs for off-label uses is prohibited. Cephalon, the manufacturer of Provigil, faced legal issues for promoting off-label uses and paid significant fines in 2008.

===Brand names===

Modafinil is sold under a variety of brand names worldwide, including Alertec, Alertex, Altasomil, Aspendos, Bravamax, Forcilin, Intensit, Karim, Mentix, Modafinilo, Modalert, Modanil, Modasomil, Modvigil, Modiodal, Modiwake, Movigil, Provigil, Resotyl, Stavigile, Vigia, Vigicer, Vigil, Vigimax, Waklert, and Zalux.

===Economics===
Originally developed in the 1970s by French neuroscientist Michel Jouvet and Lafon Laboratories, modafinil has been prescribed in France since 1994, and was approved for medical use in the United States in 1998.
Concerns have been raised about the growing use of modafinil as a &quot;smart drug&quot; or cognitive enhancer among healthy individuals who use it with the aim to improve concentration and memory. In 2003, modafinil sales were skyrocketing, with some experts concerned that it had become a tempting pick-me-up for people looking for an extra edge in a productivity-obsessed society. The cost of modafinil varied depending on factors such as location and insurance coverage; still, in 2004, the price of modafinil in the US was around $120 or more per monthly supply. However, the availability of generic versions has increased since then and may have driven down prices.

In 2020, modafinil was the 302nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with just over 1,000,000 prescriptions.

 the global sales figures for modafinil are not known. Still, modafinil sold under the brand name Provigil accounted for over 40% of Cephalon&#x27;s global turnover for several years, according to the information published in 2020.

===Patent protection and litigation===
Modafinil&#x27;s patent history involves several key developments. The original patent, , was granted to Laboratoire L. Lafon in 1990, covering the chemical compound of modafinil. This patent expired in 2010. In 1994, Cephalon filed a patent for modafinil in the form of particles of a defined size, represented by , which expired in 2015.

Following the nearing expiration of marketing rights in 2002, generic manufacturers, including Mylan and Teva, applied for FDA approval to market a generic form of modafinil, leading to legal challenges by Cephalon regarding the particle size patent. The patent RE 37,516 was declared invalid and unenforceable in 2011.

In addition, Cephalon entered agreements with several generic drug manufacturers to delay the sale of generic modafinil in the US. These agreements were subject to legal scrutiny and antitrust investigations, culminating in a ruling by the Court of Appeals in 2016, which found that the settlements did not violate antitrust laws.

===Sports===
The regulation of modafinil as a doping agent has been controversial in the sporting world, with high-profile cases attracting press coverage since several prominent American athletes tested positive for the substance. Some athletes who used modafinil protested that the drug was not on the prohibited list at the time of their offenses. However, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) maintains that modafinil was related to already-banned substances. The Agency added modafinil to its list of prohibited substances on August 3, 2004, ten days before the start of the 2004 Summer Olympics.

Several athletes, such as sprinter Kelli White in 2003, cyclist David Clinger and basketball player Diana Taurasi in 2010, and rower Timothy Grant in 2015, were accused of using modafinil as a performance-enhancing doping agent. Taurasi and another player—Monique Coker, tested at the same lab—were later cleared. Kelli White, who tested positive after her 100m victory at the 2003 World Championships in Paris, was stripped of her gold medals. She claimed that she used modafinil to treat narcolepsy, but the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) ruled that modafinil was a performance-enhancing drug.

The BALCO scandal brought to light an unsubstantiated (but widely published) account of Major League Baseball&#x27;s all-time leading home-run hitter Barry Bonds&#x27; supplemental chemical regimen that included modafinil in addition to anabolic steroids and human growth hormone.

===Social views===
The use of modafinil as a supposed cognitive enhancer may be considered as cheating, unnatural, or risky. The University of Sussex explained that it is a prescription drug and the decision should be made by the doctor on whether to prescribe modafinil to a student. As a matter of bioethics, the US President&#x27;s Council on Bioethics argued that excellence achieved through the use of drugs like modafinil is &quot;cheap&quot; as it obviates the need for hard work and study, and is not fully authentic because the excellence is partly attributable to the drug, not the individual. Alternately, people in environments like Wall Street trading may not view the use of modafinil as cheating, believing that if modafinil can give them an edge and they are aware of the risks involved, it should not be considered as cheating. Due to such varying views, modafinil users for narcolepsy may cope with stigma by hiding, denying, or justifying their use, or by seeking support from others who share their views or experiences.

==Research==
===Psychiatric conditions===
====Major depressive disorder====
Modafinil has been studied in the treatment of major depressive disorder. In a 2021 systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of psychostimulants for depression, modafinil and other stimulants such as methylphenidate and amphetamines improved depression in traditional meta-analysis. However, when subjected to network meta-analysis, modafinil and most other stimulants did not significantly improve depression, with only methylphenidate remaining effective. Modafinil and other stimulants likewise did not improve quality of life in the meta-analysis, although there was evidence for reduced fatigue and sleepiness with modafinil and other stimulants. While significant effectiveness of modafinil for depression has been reported by particular trials, reviews and meta-analyses note that the effectiveness of modafinil for depression is limited, the quality of available evidence is low, and the results are inconclusive.

====Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (research)==== 
Modafinil was considered for the treatment of ADHD because of its lower abuse potential than conventional psychostimulants like methylphenidate and amphetamines. In 2008, an application to market modafinil for pediatric ADHD was submitted to the Food and Drug Administration in the US.

However, evidence of modafinil for treatment of adult ADHD is mixed, and a 2016 systematic review of alternative drug therapies for adult ADHD did not recommend its use in this context. In a later large phase 3 clinical trial of modafinil for adult ADHD, modafinil was not effective in improving symptoms, there was also a high rate of side effects (86%) and discontinuation (47%). The poor tolerability of modafinil in this study was possibly due to the use of high doses (). Another reason for the denial of the approval was due to concerns about rare but serious dermatological toxicity in Stevens–Johnson syndrome.

The research on the use of modafinil for treating individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) who also exhibit ADHD symptoms is currently in its early stages with no results delivered.

====Substance dependence====
Modafinil was studied for the treatment of stimulant dependence, but the results are mixed and inconclusive. Modafinil is not a controlled substance in some countries, unlike other medications, such as bupropion, which is also used to treat depression and nicotine dependence. The clinical trials that have tested modafinil as a treatment for stimulant abuse have failed to demonstrate its efficacy and the optimal dose and duration of modafinil treatment remain unclear, and modafinil is not a recommended treatment for stimulant abuse. 2024 reviews found that modafinil was ineffective for treating individuals with amphetamine-type stimulant use disorder or methamphetamine use disorder from these dependencies.

====Schizophrenia====
Modafinil and armodafinil were studied as a complement to antipsychotic medications in the treatment of schizophrenia. They showed no effect on positive symptoms or cognitive performance. A 2015 meta-analysis found that modafinil and armodafinil may slightly reduce negative symptoms in people with acute schizophrenia, though they do not appear useful for people with the condition who are stable, with high negative symptom scores. Among medications demonstrated to be effective for reducing negative symptoms in combination with antipsychotics, modafinil, and armodafinil are among the smallest effect sizes.

====Abstinence in cocaine addiction====
Modafinil is researched to determine whether it might improve abstinence in people with cocaine addiction.

====Motivational disorders====
Modafinil has been found to reverse tetrabenazine-induced motivational deficits in animals and hence can produce pro-motivational effects. Novel modafinil analogs with greater potency, including CE-123, CE-158, JJC8-088, MK-26, and RDS03-94, have also been developed and have shown pro-motivational effects in animals. These agents are of potential interest in the treatment of motivational disorders in humans.

===Cognitive enhancement===
A 2019 review conducted on the potential nootropic effects of modafinil in healthy, non-sleep-deprived individuals revealed the following: a) while studies using basic testing paradigms demonstrated that modafinil enhances executive function, only half of these studies showed improvements in attention, learning, and memory, with a few studies even reporting impairments in divergent creative thinking; b) modafinil displayed small levels of enhancement in attention, executive functions, and learning abilities; c) no substantial side effects or mood changes were observed; d) the available evidence showed limited evidence for modafinil as a cognitive enhancer outside of its use for sleep-deprived populations.

A 2020 review reported that modafinil has a modest effect on memory updating, but the effect is small and may not accurately reflect the perception that it is useful as a cognitive enhancer, as there is insufficient evidence to support such a claim.

===Post-anesthesia sedation===
General anesthesia is required for many surgeries, but may cause lingering fatigue, sedation, and/or drowsiness after surgery that lasts for hours to days. In outpatient surgery the sedation, fatigue, and occasional dizziness is problematic. Modafinil was tested as a potential remedy to alleviate these symptoms. For example, it was expected that modafinil would help people recover quicker from general anesthesia after a short surgery, but the results were uncertain and the inconclusive studies could not reliably verify the expectation. The use of modafinil to relieve post-anesthesia sedation is investigational.

===Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome===
Caution should be exercised in people who have narcolepsy in comorbidity with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS).

===Myotonic dystrophy===
Modafinil is being researched as a potential remedy for excessive daytime sleepiness in myotonic dystrophy (DM), an inherited condition characterized by progressive muscle loss, weakness, and myotonia. Myotonia is a condition where muscles cannot relax after they contract. Myotonic dystrophy has two main types: DM1 (Steinert disease) and DM2 (proximal myotonic myopathy). Both types can cause excessive daytime sleepiness. Studies suggest that modafinil may be a promising drug that can reduce both daytime sleepiness and myotonia itself, without significant cardiac conduction effects. These presumed property of modafinil is of particular interest for eventual treatment of people with myotonic dystrophy who often have underlying cardiac issues. Still, modafinil is not approved by the FDA for use in myotonic dystrophy, and the value and role of modafinil in DM remain the subject of debate.

===Disorders of consciousness===
Modafinil has been studied for its potential therapeutic effects in patients with disorders of consciousness. Researchers are investigating whether modafinil can stimulate neurotransmitters such as histamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, dopamine, and orexin, and whether modafinil has potential anti-oxidative effects.

Disorders of consciousness are states characterized by impaired arousal and awareness. These states include coma, vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (VS/UWS), minimally conscious state (MCS), cognitive motor dissociation, and covert cortical processing. Brain injuries can impair consciousness through neuroanatomic lesions involving the bilateral cerebral hemispheres, rostral brainstem, diencephalon, or basal forebrain.

Neuroimaging studies have shown that modafinil increases cerebral blood flow in several brain regions, such as the thalamus, locus coeruleus, limbic system, and insular cortex; still, observational reports on the use of modafinil in patients with disorders of consciousness have produced mixed results, indicating that its effectiveness may vary among individuals.

===Inflammation===
A possible link between inflammatory processes and depressive disorders has stimulated preliminary research on modafinil for its potential anti-inflammatory effects.

<text>In set theory and its applications throughout mathematics, a class is a collection of sets (or sometimes other mathematical objects) that can be unambiguously defined by a property that all its members share. Classes act as a way to have set-like collections while differing from sets so as to avoid paradoxes, especially Russell&#x27;s paradox (see &quot;&quot;). The precise definition of &quot;class&quot; depends on foundational context. In work on Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, the notion of class is informal, whereas other set theories, such as von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory, axiomatize the notion of &quot;proper class&quot;, e.g., as entities that are not members of another entity.

A class that is not a set (informally in Zermelo–Fraenkel) is called a proper class, and a class that is a set is sometimes called a small class. For instance, the class of all ordinal numbers, and the class of all sets, are proper classes in many formal systems.

In Quine&#x27;s set-theoretical writing, the phrase &quot;ultimate class&quot; is often used instead of the phrase &quot;proper class&quot; emphasising that in the systems he considers, certain classes cannot be members, and are thus the final term in any membership chain to which they belong.

Outside set theory, the word &quot;class&quot; is sometimes used synonymously with &quot;set&quot;. This usage dates from a historical period where classes and sets were not distinguished as they are in modern set-theoretic terminology. Many discussions of &quot;classes&quot; in the 19th century and earlier are really referring to sets, or rather perhaps take place without considering that certain classes can fail to be sets.

== Examples ==
The collection of all algebraic structures of a given type will usually be a proper class. Examples include the class of all groups, the class of all vector spaces, and many others. In category theory, a category whose collection of objects forms a proper class (or whose collection of morphisms forms a proper class) is called a large category.

The surreal numbers are a proper class of objects that have the properties of a field.

Within set theory, many collections of sets turn out to be proper classes. Examples include the class of all sets (the universal class), the class of all ordinal numbers, and the class of all cardinal numbers.

One way to prove that a class is proper is to place it in bijection with the class of all ordinal numbers. This method is used, for example, in the proof that there is no free complete lattice on three or more generators.

== Paradoxes ==
The paradoxes of naive set theory can be explained in terms of the inconsistent tacit assumption that &quot;all classes are sets&quot;. With a rigorous foundation, these paradoxes instead suggest proofs that certain classes are proper (i.e., that they are not sets). For example, Russell&#x27;s paradox suggests a proof that the class of all sets which do not contain themselves is proper, and the Burali-Forti paradox suggests that the class of all ordinal numbers is proper. The paradoxes do not arise with classes because there is no notion of classes containing classes. Otherwise, one could, for example, define a class of all classes that do not contain themselves, which would lead to a Russell paradox for classes. A conglomerate, on the other hand, can have proper classes as members.

== Classes in formal set theories ==
ZF set theory does not formalize the notion of classes, so each formula with classes must be reduced syntactically to a formula without classes. For example, one can reduce the formula formula_1 to formula_2. For a class formula_3 and a set variable symbol formula_4, it is necessary to be able to expand each of the formulas formula_5, formula_6, formula_7, and formula_8 into a formula without an occurrence of a class.p. 339

Semantically, in a metalanguage, the classes can be described as equivalence classes of logical formulas: If formula_9 is a structure interpreting ZF, then the object language &quot;class-builder expression&quot; formula_10 is interpreted in formula_9 by the collection of all the elements from the domain of formula_9 on which formula_13 holds; thus, the class can be described as the set of all predicates equivalent to formula_14 (which includes formula_14 itself). In particular, one can identify the &quot;class of all sets&quot; with the set of all predicates equivalent to formula_16.

Because classes do not have any formal status in the theory of ZF, the axioms of ZF do not immediately apply to classes. However, if an inaccessible cardinal formula_17 is assumed, then the sets of smaller rank form a model of ZF (a Grothendieck universe), and its subsets can be thought of as &quot;classes&quot;.

In ZF, the concept of a function can also be generalised to classes. A class function is not a function in the usual sense, since it is not a set; it is rather a formula formula_18 with the property that for any set formula_4 there is no more than one set formula_20 such that the pair formula_21 satisfies formula_22. For example, the class function mapping each set to its powerset may be expressed as the formula formula_23. The fact that the ordered pair formula_21 satisfies formula_22 may be expressed with the shorthand notation formula_26.

Another approach is taken by the von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel axioms (NBG); classes are the basic objects in this theory, and a set is then defined to be a class that is an element of some other class. However, the class existence axioms of NBG are restricted so that they only quantify over sets, rather than over all classes. This causes NBG to be a conservative extension of ZFC.

Morse–Kelley set theory admits proper classes as basic objects, like NBG, but also allows quantification over all proper classes in its class existence axioms. This causes MK to be strictly stronger than both NBG and ZFC.

In other set theories, such as New Foundations or the theory of semisets, the concept of &quot;proper class&quot; still makes sense (not all classes are sets) but the criterion of sethood is not closed under subsets. For example, any set theory with a universal set has proper classes which are subclasses of sets.
