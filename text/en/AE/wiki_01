<text>Mariah Carey ( ; born March 27, 1969) is an American singer-songwriter, record producer, and actress. Dubbed the &quot;Songbird Supreme&quot; by &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;, Carey is known for her five-octave vocal range, melismatic singing style and signature use of the whistle register. An influential figure in music, she was ranked as the fifth greatest singer of all time by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 2023.

Carey rose to fame in 1990 with her self-titled debut album and became the only artist to have their first five singles reach number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, from &quot;Vision of Love&quot; to &quot;Emotions&quot;. She achieved international success with the best-selling albums &quot;Music Box&quot; (1993) and &quot;Daydream&quot; (1995), before adopting a new image with hip hop-inflected sounds, following the release of &quot;Butterfly&quot; (1997). The remix of her song &quot;Fantasy&quot;, featuring Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard, popularized the blend of pop and hip-hop into mainstream music. With eleven consecutive years of US number-one singles, &quot;Billboard&quot; named Carey the Artist of the Decade (1990s). Following the failure of her 2001 film &quot;Glitter&quot; and a career decline, she released one of the best-selling albums of the 21st century, &quot;The Emancipation of Mimi&quot; (2005).

Carey has also been dubbed the &quot;Queen of Christmas&quot; due to the enduring popularity of her holiday music, particularly &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; (1994), the best-selling holiday album, and its single &quot;All I Want for Christmas Is You&quot;, which is the best selling holiday single by a female artist of all time. Outside of music, she has contributed to various charities, having co-founded Camp Mariah with the Fresh Air Fund in 1994; starred in the films &quot;Tennessee&quot; (2008), &quot;Precious&quot; (2009), &quot;The Butler&quot; (2013), &quot;A Christmas Melody&quot; (2015), and &quot;The Lego Batman Movie&quot; (2017); and served as a judge on &quot;American Idol&quot; (2013). Carey&#x27;s public and personal life, including her diva persona, high-profile relationships and mental breakdown in 2001, has received widespread media coverage. She released a memoir, &quot;The Meaning of Mariah Carey&quot;, in 2020.

Carey is one of the best-selling music artists, with over 200 million records sold worldwide. She was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, the Long Island Music and Entertainment Hall of Fame, and the National Recording Registry at the Library of Congress. Her accolades include 5 competitive Grammy Awards and a Grammy Global Impact Award, 10 American Music Awards, 19 World Music Awards and 14 &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards. She holds the record for the most &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number-one singles by a solo artist (19), a female songwriter (18), and a female producer (15), spending a record 97 weeks atop the chart. &quot;One Sweet Day&quot; and &quot;We Belong Together&quot; were ranked by &quot;Billboard&quot; as the most successful songs of the 1990s and 2000s, respectively. Carey is the highest-certified female artist in the United States and 10th overall, with 75 million certified album-equivalent units.

== Early life ==
Carey was born on March 27, 1969, in Huntington, New York. Her name is derived from the song &quot;They Call the Wind Maria&quot;, originally from the 1951 Broadway musical &quot;Paint Your Wagon.&quot; She is the youngest of three children born to Patricia (née Hickey), a former opera singer and vocal coach of Irish descent, and Alfred Roy Carey, an aeronautical engineer of both African-American and Afro-Venezuelan lineage. The last name &quot;Carey&quot; was adopted by her Venezuelan grandfather, Francisco Núñez, after he emigrated to New York. Patricia&#x27;s family disowned her for marrying a black man. Racial tensions prevented the Carey family from integrating into their community. While they lived in Huntington, their neighbors poisoned the family dog and set fire to their car. After her parents&#x27; divorce, Carey had little contact with Alfred, and Patricia worked several jobs to support the family. Carey spent much of her time at home alone and began singing at age three, often imitating her mother&#x27;s take on Verdi&#x27;s opera &quot;Rigoletto&quot; in Italian. Her older sister Alison moved in with their father while Mariah and her elder brother Morgan lived with their mother.

During her years in elementary school, she excelled in the arts, such as music and literature. Carey began writing poetry and lyrics while attending Harborfields High School in Greenlawn, New York, where she graduated in 1987. Carey began vocal training under her mother&#x27;s guidance. Though she was a classically trained opera singer, Patricia Carey never pressured her daughter to pursue a career in classical opera. Mariah Carey recalled that she had &quot;never been a pushy mom. She never said, &#x27;Give it more of an operatic feel.&#x27; I respect opera like crazy, but it didn&#x27;t influence me.&quot; In high school, Mariah Carey was often absent because of her work as a demo singer. This led to her classmates giving her the nickname Mirage. Working in the Long Island music scene gave her opportunities to work with musicians such as Gavin Christopher and Ben Margulies, with whom she co-wrote material for her demo tape. After moving to New York City, she worked part-time jobs to pay the rent and completed 500 hours of beauty school. Carey moved into a one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan with four female students as roommates. She landed a gig singing backup for freestyle singer Brenda K. Starr.

== Career ==
=== 1988–1990: Career beginnings and self-titled debut album ===

In December 1988, Carey accompanied Starr to a music executive&#x27;s party and handed her demo tape to the head of Columbia Records, Tommy Mottola. After listening to the tape during the ride home, he immediately requested the driver turn around. She had already left the event, and Mottola spent two weeks looking for her. Another record label expressed interest and a bidding war ensued. He signed Carey to Columbia and enlisted producers Ric Wake, Narada Michael Walden, and Rhett Lawrence for her first album.

Columbia marketed Carey as the main female artist on their roster, competing with Arista Records&#x27;s Whitney Houston and Madonna of Sire Records. It spent upwards of $1 million promoting Carey&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;Mariah Carey&quot;. On June 5, 1990, Carey made her first public appearance at the 1990 NBA Finals, singing &quot;America the Beautiful&quot;. The highlight was the piercing whistle note toward the song&#x27;s conclusion, sparking CBS Sports anchor Pat O&#x27;Brien to declare, &quot;The palace now has a queen.&quot; The album topped the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 for eleven consecutive weeks, after Carey&#x27;s exposure at the 33rd Annual Grammy Awards, where she won the award for Best New Artist, and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for her single &quot;Vision of Love&quot;. The album&#x27;s singles &quot;Vision of Love&quot;, &quot;Love Takes Time&quot;, &quot;Someday&quot;, and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Cry&quot; all topped the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Mariah Carey&quot; was the best-selling album in the United States in 1991, and achieved worldwide sales of 15 million copies.

=== 1991–1992: &quot;Emotions&quot; and &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; ===

Carey co-wrote, co-produced, and recorded her second studio effort, &quot;Emotions&quot;, during 1991. She described it as a homage to Motown soul music and employed the help of Walter Afanasieff, who only had a small role on her debut, as well as Robert Clivillés and David Cole, from the dance group C+C Music Factory. Carey&#x27;s relationship with Margulies deteriorated over a songwriting royalties dispute. After he filed a lawsuit against Columbia&#x27;s parent company, Sony Music Entertainment, the songwriting duo parted ways. &quot;Emotions&quot; was released on September 17 that year. Its title track served as the album&#x27;s lead single and became Carey&#x27;s fifth chart topper on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, making her the first artist whose first five singles reached the chart&#x27;s summit. Though critics praised the album&#x27;s content and described it as a more mature effort, the album was criticized as calculated and lacking originality. While the album managed sales of eight million copies globally, &quot;Emotions&quot; failed to reach the commercial and critical heights of its predecessor.

Carey did not embark on a world tour to promote the album. Although she attributed this to stage fright and the vocally challenging nature of her material, speculation grew that Carey was a &quot;studio worm&quot; and incapable of producing the perfect pitch and five-octave vocal range for which she was known. In hopes of ending any speculation of her being a manufactured artist, Carey booked an appearance on &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;. The show presented artists &quot;unplugged&quot; or in a stripped setting and devoid of studio equipment. Days prior to the show&#x27;s taping, Carey and Afanasieff chose to add a cover of the Jackson 5&#x27;s 1970 song &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There&quot; to the set-list. On March 16, 1992, she played and recorded an intimate seven-song show at Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens, New York. The acclaimed revue was aired more than three times as often as the average episode, and critics heralding it as a &quot;vocal Tour de force&quot;. Carey&#x27;s live version of &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There&quot; became her sixth number-one single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. Sony capitalized on this success and released an extended play (EP) of her performance. It earned a triple-Platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and earned Gold and Platinum certifications in several European markets.

=== 1993–1994: &quot;Music Box&quot; and &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; ===
Following years of dating, Carey and Mottola got married on June 5, 1993. After &quot;Emotions&quot; failed to achieve the commercial heights of her debut album, Carey&#x27;s subsequent release was to be marketed as adult contemporary and pop-friendly. &quot;Music Box&quot; was produced by Carey and Afanasieff, and it began a songwriting partnership that would extend until 1997&#x27;s &quot;Butterfly&quot;. The album was released on August 31, 1993, to mixed reviews from music critics. Carey&#x27;s songwriting was derided as clichéd and her vocal performances were described as less emotive and lazier in their delivery. In his review of the album, AllMusic&#x27;s Ron Wynn concluded: &quot;sometimes excessive spirit is preferable to an absence of passion&quot;. In promotion of the album, Carey embarked on her debut tour, a six-date concert series, the Music Box Tour. &quot;Music Box&quot;″s first and second singles, &quot;Dreamlover&quot; and &quot;Hero&quot;, became Carey&#x27;s seventh and eighth chart-toppers in the United States, while her cover of Badfinger&#x27;s &quot;Without You&quot; became her first number-one single in Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom. &quot;Music Box&quot; remains Carey&#x27;s best-seller and one of the best-selling albums, with worldwide sales of over 28 million copies.

In mid-1994, Carey and Luther Vandross recorded and released a cover of Lionel Richie and Diana Ross&#x27;s &quot;Endless Love&quot;. &quot;Merry Christmas&quot;, released on November 1, 1994, became the best-selling Christmas album, with global sales of over 15 million copies. The lead single, &quot;All I Want for Christmas Is You&quot;, became a holiday standard and continues to surge in popularity each holiday season. By October 2017, it had become the 11th best-selling single in history with over 16 million copies sold worldwide.

=== 1995–1996: &quot;Daydream&quot; and &quot;Someone&#x27;s Ugly Daughter&quot; ===

Carey&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Daydream&quot;, found her consolidating creative control over her career, leading to tensions with Columbia. Songs from her prior two albums had been primarily shaped by Mottola&#x27;s conceptualization of what Carey should sound like, as innocent and wholesome tracks dominated by her vocal performance. &quot;Daydream&quot; featured a departure from her allegiance to pop and gravitated heavily towards R&amp;B and hip hop. Critically, the album was described as Carey&#x27;s best to date. &quot;The New York Times&quot; named it one of 1995&#x27;s best albums and wrote it &quot;brings R&amp;B candy-making to a new peak of textural refinement ... Carey&#x27;s songwriting has taken a leap forward and become more relaxed, sexier and less reliant on thudding clichés.&quot; Its lead single, &quot;Fantasy&quot;, became the first single by a female artist to debut at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and the second song overall after Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;You Are Not Alone&quot;. &quot;One Sweet Day&quot;, a collaboration with R&amp;B group Boyz II Men, served as the second single from &quot;Daydream&quot; and remained atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for a record-breaking 16 consecutive weeks, becoming the longest-running number-one song in the history of the charts at the time. It also opened at the top spot, becoming Carey&#x27;s second track to do so. The album&#x27;s third single, &quot;Always Be My Baby&quot;, became Carey&#x27;s eleventh chart-topper, tying her with Madonna and Whitney Houston for the most number-one singles among female artists at the time.

&quot;Daydream&quot; became Carey&#x27;s biggest-selling album in the United States, and her second album to be certified Diamond by the RIAA, after &quot;Music Box&quot;. The album continued Carey&#x27;s dominance in Asian music markets and sold in excess of 2.2 million copies in Japan alone and over 20 million copies globally. &quot;Daydream&quot; and its singles were nominated in six categories at the 38th Grammy Awards. Though considered a favorite to win the top awards of the evening, Carey was shut out, prompting her to comment &quot;What can you do? I will never be disappointed again.&quot; In early 1996, she embarked on her first international string of concerts, the Daydream World Tour. Its seven dates spanned three in Japan and four throughout Europe. &quot;Forbes&quot; named Carey the top-earning female musician of 1996, collecting an estimated $32 million.

During the recording of &quot;Daydream&quot;, Carey also worked on the alternative rock album &quot;Someone&#x27;s Ugly Daughter&quot; by the band Chick, contributing writing, production, vocals and art direction. As Columbia Records refused to release the album with her lead vocals, Carey&#x27;s friend Clarissa Dane was brought in to become the face of Chick, and her vocals were layered on top of Carey&#x27;s, masking her voice. Her contributions were secret until the release of her 2020 memoir &quot;The Meaning of Mariah Carey&quot;.

=== 1997–2000: New image with &quot;Butterfly&quot; and &quot;Rainbow&quot; ===
Carey&#x27;s subsequent musical releases followed the trend that began with &quot;Daydream&quot;. Her music began relying less on pop and adult contemporary-tinged balladry and instead incorporating heavy elements of hip hop and R&amp;B. On &quot;Butterfly&quot;, she collaborated with a bevy of producers other than Afanasieff, such as Sean Combs, Q-Tip, Missy Elliott and Jean Claude Oliver and Samuel Barnes from Trackmasters. &quot;Butterfly&quot; was released on September 10, 1997, and introduced a more subdued style of singing, with critics noting Carey&#x27;s incorporation of breathy vocals. Some viewed her lack of propensity to use her upper range as a sign of maturity, while others questioned whether it forebode waning vocal prowess. The music video for the album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Honey&quot;, her first since separating from Mottola, introduced a more overtly sexual image. &quot;Butterfly&quot; became Carey&#x27;s best-reviewed album, with attention placed on the album&#x27;s exploration of more mature lyrical themes. In their review of the album, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote it was &quot;not as if Carey has totally dispensed with her old saccharine, Houston-style balladry ... but the predominant mood of &quot;Butterfly&quot; is one of coolly erotic reverie.&quot; AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine described Carey&#x27;s vocals as &quot;sultrier and more controlled than ever,&quot; and felt the album &quot;illustrates that Carey continues to improve and refine her music, which makes her a rarity among her &#x27;90s peers.&#x27;&quot; &quot;Honey&quot; and &quot;My All&quot;, the album&#x27;s fifth single, both topped the Hot 100, making Carey a female artist with the most number-one singles in the chart&#x27;s history. Though a commercial success, &quot;Butterfly&quot; failed to reach the commercial heights of her previous albums, &quot;Music Box&quot; and &quot;Daydream&quot;.

After concluding her Butterfly World Tour, Carey participated in the VH1 Divas benefit concert on April 14, 1998, where she sang alongside Aretha Franklin, Celine Dion, Shania Twain, Gloria Estefan, and Carole King. Carey began conceptualizing a film project &quot;All That Glitters&quot;, later re-titled to simply &quot;Glitter&quot; (2001), and wrote songs for other projects, such as &quot;Men in Black&quot; (1997) and &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot; (2000). After &quot;Glitter&quot; fell into developmental hell, Carey postponed the project and began writing material for a new album. Sony Music executives insisted she prepare a greatest hits collection in time for the holiday season. The album, titled &quot;#1&#x27;s&quot; (1998), featured a cover of Brenda K. Starr&#x27;s &quot;I Still Believe&quot; and a duet with Whitney Houston, &quot;When You Believe&quot;, which was included on the soundtrack for &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot; (1998). &quot;#1&#x27;s&quot; became a phenomenon in Japan, selling over one million copies in its opening week, making Carey the only international artist to accomplish this feat. It sold over 3.25 million copies in Japan in its first three months and holds the record as the best-selling album by a non-Asian artist.
With only one album left to fulfill her contract with Sony, and with a desire to separate herself professionally from the record label her ex-husband still headed, Carey completed the album in three months in mid-1999. Titled &quot;Rainbow&quot;, the album found Carey exploring with producers whom she had not worked with before. &quot;Rainbow&quot; became Carey&#x27;s first album to not feature a collaboration with her longtime writing partner, Walter Afanasieff. She instead chose to work with David Foster and Diane Warren. &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; and &quot;Thank God I Found You&quot; both topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, while her rendition of Phil Collins&#x27; &quot;Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)&quot; with Irish boy band Westlife became her second number-one song on the UK charts. &quot;Rainbow&quot; was released on November 2, 1999, to the highest first-week sales of her career at the time, and debuted at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Carey&#x27;s tense relationship with Columbia grew increasingly fractious; she began posting messages on her website, sharing inside information with fans on the dispute, as well as instructing them to request &quot;Can&#x27;t Take That Away (Mariah&#x27;s Theme)&quot; on radio stations.

Ultimately, the song was only given a very limited and low-promotion release. Critical reception of &quot;Rainbow&quot; was generally positive, with the general consensus finding: &quot;what began on &quot;Butterfly&quot; as a departure ends up on &quot;Rainbow&quot; a progression – perhaps the first compelling proof of Carey&#x27;s true colors as an artist.&quot; Though a commercial success, &quot;Rainbow&quot; became Carey&#x27;s lowest selling album at that point in her career.

=== 2001–2004: Personal and professional setbacks, &quot;Glitter&quot; and &quot;Charmbracelet&quot; ===
Carey received &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Artist of the Decade Award and the World Music Award for Best-Selling Pop Female Artist of the Millennium, and parted from Columbia Records. She signed an unprecedented $80 million five-album recording contract with Virgin Records (EMI Records) in April 2001. &quot;Glitter&quot; was a musical departure, recreating a 1980s post-disco era to accompany the film, set in 1983. Carey was given full conceptual and creative control over the project. She said that Columbia had regarded her as a commodity, with her separation from Mottola exacerbating her relations with label executives. Carey&#x27;s three-year relationship with Latin singer Luis Miguel ended.

In July 2001, Carey suffered a physical and emotional breakdown. She began posting disturbing messages on her website and behaved erratically in live promotional outings. On July 19, Carey made a surprise appearance on the MTV program &quot;Total Request Live&quot; (TRL). As the show&#x27;s host Carson Daly began taping following a commercial break, she came out pushing an ice cream cart while wearing a large men&#x27;s shirt and began a striptease that revealed a tight ensemble. She credited exhaustion for the appearance going awry. Days later, Carey posted irregular voice notes on her website. On July 26, she was hospitalized due to exhaustion and a &quot;physical and emotional breakdown&quot;. Carey was admitted to a hospital in Connecticut and remained under doctor&#x27;s care for two weeks, followed by an extended absence from the public. Virgin Records and 20th Century Fox delayed the release of &quot;Glitter&quot; and its soundtrack. Critics panned &quot;Glitter&quot; and its soundtrack; both were unsuccessful commercially. The soundtrack became Carey&#x27;s lowest-selling album to that point. The &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; condemned it as &quot;an absolute mess that&#x27;ll go down as an annoying blemish on [her] career&quot;. She attributed the poor performance to her state of mind, its postponement and the soundtrack having been released on September 11.

Carey&#x27;s record deal with Virgin Records was bought out for $28 million. She flew to Capri, Italy, for five months, and wrote material for a new album there. Carey described her time at Virgin &quot;a complete and total stress-fest ... I made a total snap decision which was based on money and I never make decisions based on money. I learned a big lesson from that.&quot; She signed a contract with Island Records, valued at more than $24 million, and launched the record label MonarC. Carey&#x27;s father, Alfred Roy, with whom she had had little contact since childhood, died of cancer that year. Her song &quot;Sunflowers for Alfred Roy&quot; from &quot;Charmbracelet&quot; is dedicated to his memory. In 2002, she was cast in the independent film &quot;WiseGirls&quot; alongside Mira Sorvino and Melora Walters, who co-starred as waitresses at a mobster-operated restaurant. It premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, and received negative reviews, though Carey&#x27;s performance was praised. Roger Friedman of Fox News described her as &quot;a Thelma Ritter for the new millennium&quot;, and wrote, &quot;Her line delivery is sharp and she manages to get the right laughs.&quot;
In December 2002, Carey released her ninth studio album, &quot;Charmbracelet&quot;, which she said marked &quot;a new lease on life&quot; for her. Sales of &quot;Charmbracelet&quot; were moderate and the quality of Carey&#x27;s vocals came under criticism. Joan Anderson from &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; declared the album &quot;the worst of her career, and revealed a voice [that is] no longer capable of either gravity-defying gymnastics or soft coos&quot;, while AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote, &quot;Mariah&#x27;s voice is shot, sounding in tatters throughout the record. She can no longer coo or softly croon nor can she perform her trademark gravity-defying vocal runs.&quot; To support the album, Carey embarked on the Charmbracelet World Tour, spanning North America and East Asia over three months. While smaller venues were booked throughout the tour&#x27;s stateside leg, Carey performed in stadiums in Asia and Europe. In the United Kingdom, it was her first tour to feature shows outside London. The tour garnered generally positive reviews, with many praising the production and Carey&#x27;s vocals.

=== 2005–2007: Resurgence with &quot;The Emancipation of Mimi&quot; ===
Carey&#x27;s tenth studio album, &quot;The Emancipation of Mimi&quot; in 2005, was produced with the Neptunes, Kanye West and Carey&#x27;s longtime collaborator, Jermaine Dupri. She described the album as &quot;very much like a party record ... the process of putting on makeup and getting ready to go out ... I wanted to make a record that was reflective of that.&quot; &quot;The Emancipation of Mimi&quot; topped the charts in the United States, becoming her fifth number-one album and first since &quot;Butterfly&quot; (1997), and was warmly accepted by critics. Caroline Sullivan of &quot;The Guardian&quot; defined it as &quot;cool, focused and urban [... some of] the first Mariah Carey tunes in years which I wouldn&#x27;t have to be paid to listen to again,&quot; while &quot;USA Today&quot;″s Elysa Gardner wrote, &quot;The [songs] truly reflect the renewed confidence of a songbird who has taken her shots and kept on flying.&quot; The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;We Belong Together&quot;, became a &quot;career re-defining&quot; song for Carey, after a relatively unsuccessful period and a point when many critics had considered her career over.

Music critics heralded the song as her &quot;return to form,&quot; as well as the &quot;return of The Voice,&quot; while many felt it would revive &quot;faith&quot; in Carey&#x27;s potential as a balladeer. &quot;We Belong Together&quot; broke several records in the United States and became Carey&#x27;s sixteenth chart topper on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. After staying at number one for fourteen non-consecutive weeks, the song became the second-longest-running number one song in US chart history, behind Carey&#x27;s &quot;One Sweet Day&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; listed it as the &quot;song of the decade&quot; and the ninth most popular song of all time. The song broke several airplay records, and according to Nielsen BDS, and gathered both the largest one-day and one-week audiences in history.

During the week of September 25, 2005, Carey set another record, becoming the first woman to occupy the first two spots atop the Hot 100, as &quot;We Belong Together&quot; remained at number one, and her next single, &quot;Shake It Off&quot;, moved into the number two spot (Ashanti had topped the chart in 2002 while being a featured singer on the number two single). On the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Year-end Chart of 2005, &quot;We Belong Together&quot; was declared the number one song, a first for Carey. &quot;Billboard&quot; listed &quot;We Belong Together&quot; ninth on The &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 All-Time Top Songs and was declared the most popular song of the 2000s decade by &quot;Billboard&quot;. The album was re-released as &quot;The Ultra Platinum Edition&quot;, from which &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget About Us&quot; became her seventeenth number-one in the United States.

&quot;The Emancipation of Mimi&quot; earned ten Grammy Award nominations: eight in 2006 for the original release, the most received by Carey in a single year, and two in 2007 for the &quot;Ultra Platinum Edition&quot;. Carey won Best Contemporary R&amp;B Album for &quot;The Emancipation of Mimi&quot; and Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance and Best R&amp;B Song for &quot;We Belong Together&quot;. &quot;The Emancipation of Mimi&quot; was 2005&#x27;s best-selling album in the United States, with nearly five million units sold. It was the first album by a solo female artist to become the year&#x27;s best-selling album within the country since Alanis Morissette&#x27;s &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; in 1996. At the end of 2005, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) reported that &quot;The Emancipation of Mimi&quot; had sold more than 7.7 million copies globally, and was the second-best-selling album of the year after Coldplay&#x27;s &quot;X&amp;Y&quot;. It has since sold 12 million copies worldwide. In support of the album, Carey embarked on her first headlining tour in three years, named The Adventures of Mimi after a &quot;Carey-centric fan&#x27;s&quot; music diary. The tour spanned 40 dates, with 32 in the United States and Canada, two in Africa, and six in Japan. It received warm reception from music critics and concert goers, many of which lauded Carey&#x27;s vocals.

=== 2008–2009: &quot;E=MC²&quot;, &quot;Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel&quot;, and &quot;Precious&quot; ===
In early 2007, Carey began to work on her eleventh studio album, &quot;E=MC²&quot;. Although the album was well received by some critics, others criticized it for being very similar to the formula used on &quot;The Emancipation of Mimi&quot;. Two weeks before the album&#x27;s release, &quot;Touch My Body&quot;, the record&#x27;s lead single, reached the top position on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, becoming Carey&#x27;s eighteenth number one and making her the solo artist with the most number one singles in United States history, pushing her past Elvis Presley into second place according to the magazine&#x27;s revised methodology. Carey is second only to The Beatles, who have twenty number-one singles. Additionally, it gave Carey her 79th week atop the Hot 100, tying her with Presley as the artist with the most weeks at number one in the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart history.&quot;

&quot;E=MC²&quot; debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with 463,000 copies sold, the biggest opening week sales of her career. In 2008, Carey also played an aspiring singer named Krystal in &quot;Tennessee&quot; and had a cameo appearance in Adam Sandler&#x27;s film &quot;You Don&#x27;t Mess with the Zohan&quot;, playing herself. Since the album&#x27;s release, Carey had planned to embark on an extensive tour in support of &quot;E=MC²&quot;. However, the tour was suddenly cancelled in early December 2008. Carey later stated that she had been pregnant during that time period and suffered a miscarriage, prompting the tour&#x27;s cancellation. On January 20, 2009, Carey performed &quot;Hero&quot; at the Neighborhood Inaugural Ball after Barack Obama was sworn as the first African-American president of the United States. On July 7, 2009, Carey—alongside Trey Lorenz—performed her version of &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There&quot; at the memorial service for Michael Jackson.

In 2009, she appeared as a social worker in &quot;Precious&quot;, the movie adaptation of the 1996 novel &quot;Push&quot; by Sapphire. The film garnered mostly positive reviews from critics, also for Carey&#x27;s performance. &quot;Variety&quot; described her acting as &quot;pitch-perfect&quot;. In January 2010, Carey won the Breakthrough Actress Performance Award for her role in &quot;Precious&quot; at the Palm Springs International Film Festival.

On September 25, 2009, Carey&#x27;s twelfth studio album, &quot;Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel&quot;, was released. Reception for the album was mostly mixed; Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called it &quot;her most interesting album in a decade,&quot; while Jon Caramanica from &quot;The New York Times&quot; criticized Carey&#x27;s vocal performances, complaining she overused softer vocal registers at the expense of her more powerful lower and upper registers. Commercially, the album debuted at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with first week sales of 168,000 copies. &quot;Obsessed&quot; served as the lead single and debuted at number eleven in the US before peaking at number seven. It became Carey&#x27;s 27th top-ten entry within the nation, tying her with Elton John and Janet Jackson for having the fifth most top-tens. Its follow-up single, a cover of Foreigner&#x27;s &quot;I Want to Know What Love Is&quot;, broke airplay records in Brazil. The song spent 27 weeks atop the Brasil Hot 100, making it the longest running song in the chart&#x27;s history.

On December 31, 2009, Carey embarked on her seventh concert tour, Angels Advocate Tour, which visited the United States and Canada and ended on September 26, 2010. A planned remix album of &quot;Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel&quot;, titled &quot;Angels Advocate&quot;, was slated for a March 30, 2010, release but was eventually cancelled after Island Def Jam decided to instead distribute &quot;Up Out My Face&quot; with Nicki Minaj and &quot;Angels Cry&quot; with Ne-Yo as stand-alone releases.

=== 2010–2014: &quot;Merry Christmas II You&quot; and &quot;Me. I Am Mariah... The Elusive Chanteuse&quot; ===
Following the cancellation of &quot;Angels Advocate&quot;, it was announced that Carey would return to the studio to start work on her thirteenth studio album. It was later revealed that it would be her second Christmas album, and follow-up to &quot;Merry Christmas&quot;. The release date for the album, titled &quot;Merry Christmas II You&quot;, was November 2, 2010; the track list included new songs as well as a remix of &quot;All I Want for Christmas Is You&quot;. &quot;Merry Christmas II You&quot; debuted at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with sales of 56,000 copies, and number one on the R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, making it only the second Christmas album to top this chart. In February 2011, she recorded a duet with Tony Bennett for his &quot;Duets II&quot; album, titled &quot;When Do The Bells Ring For Me?&quot;, and re-recorded &quot;All I Want for Christmas Is You&quot; with Justin Bieber as a duet for his Christmas album, &quot;Under the Mistletoe&quot;. In November that year, Carey was included in the remix to the mixtape single &quot;Warning&quot; by Uncle Murda; the remix also features 50 Cent and Young Jeezy. Later that month, Carey released a duet with John Legend titled &quot;When Christmas Comes&quot;, originally part of &quot;Merry Christmas II You&quot;.

On March 1, 2012, Carey performed at New York City&#x27;s Gotham Hall; her first time performing since her pregnancy. She also performed a three-song set at a special fundraiser for US President Barack Obama held in New York&#x27;s Plaza Hotel. A new song titled &quot;Bring It On Home&quot;, which Carey wrote for the event to show her support for Obama&#x27;s re-election campaign, was also performed. In August 2012, she released a stand-alone single, &quot;Triumphant (Get &#x27;Em)&quot;, featuring rappers Rick Ross and Meek Mill. Carey joined the judging panel of the twelfth season of &quot;American Idol&quot;. Throughout the show there were on-set disagreements between Carey and fellow judge Nicki Minaj. Three years later, Carey did not make an appearance for its original series finale. In 2013, Carey appeared in Lee Daniels&#x27; film &quot;The Butler&quot; and had a guest role voicing as a redneck character on the adult animated series &quot;American Dad!&quot;.

In February 2013, Carey recorded and released a song called &quot;Almost Home&quot;, for the soundtrack of The Walt Disney Studios film &quot;Oz the Great and Powerful&quot;. The video was directed by photographer David LaChapelle. For her 14th album, she worked with producers including DJ Clue?, Randy Jackson, Q-Tip, R. Kelly, David Morales, Afanasieff, Dupri, The-Dream, and Da Brat. Carey told &quot;Billboard&quot;: &quot;It&#x27;s about making sure I have tons of good music, because at the end of the day that&#x27;s the most important thing... There are a lot more raw ballads than people might expect...there are also uptempo and signature-type songs that represent [my] different facets as an artist.&quot; The lead single, &quot;Beautiful&quot;, featuring singer Miguel, was released on May 6, 2013, and peaked at number 15 on the Hot 100. Carey taped a performance of &quot;Beautiful&quot; along with a medley of her greatest hits on May 15, 2013. This taping aired on the &quot;American Idol&quot; season finale the following day. After multiple delays, The album, titled &quot;Me. I Am Mariah... The Elusive Chanteuse&quot;, was released on May 27, 2014.

In October 2014, Carey announced an annual residency show All I Want for Christmas Is You: A Night of Joy and Festivity. Originally performed at the Beacon Theatre in New York City, the residency began on December 15, 2014, and ended in 2019.

=== 2015–2017: #1 to Infinity residency, television and film projects ===
On January 30, 2015, it was announced that Carey had left Universal Music Group&#x27;s Def Jam Recordings to reunite with L.A. Reid and Sony Music via Epic Records. Carey also announced her new #1 to Infinity residency at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas the same month. To coincide with the residency, Carey released &quot;#1 to Infinity&quot;, a greatest hits compilation album containing all of her eighteen &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number one singles at the time, along with a new recording, &quot;Infinity&quot;, which was released as a single on April 27. In 2015 Carey had her directorial debut for the Hallmark Channel Christmas movie &quot;A Christmas Melody&quot;, in which she also performed as one of the main characters. In December 2015, Carey announced The Sweet Sweet Fantasy Tour which spanned a total of 27-dates beginning in March 2016, marking Carey&#x27;s first major tour of mainland Europe in 13 years. Four stops included shows in South Africa. The tour grossed $30.3 million.

On March 15, 2016, Carey announced that she was filming &quot;Mariah&#x27;s World&quot;, a docu-series for the E! network documenting her Sweet Sweet Fantasy tour and her wedding planning process. Carey told &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;I thought it would be a good opportunity to kind of, like, show my personality and who I am, even though I feel like my real fans have an idea of who I am... A lot of people have misperceptions about this and that.&quot; The series premiered on December 4, 2016. Carey guest starred on the musical drama &quot;Empire&quot;, as a superstar singer named Kitty and sang the song &quot;Infamous&quot; featuring Jussie Smollett. On December 5, 2016, Carey participated in the &quot;VH1 Divas Holiday: Unsilent Night&quot; benefit concert, alongside Vanessa Williams, Chaka Khan, Patti LaBelle, and Teyana Taylor. On December 31, 2016, Carey&#x27;s performance on &quot;Dick Clark&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Rockin&#x27; Eve&quot; in Times Square received worldwide attention after technical difficulties caused her in-ear monitors to malfunction, resulting in what &quot;The New York Times&quot; referred to as a &quot;performance train wreck&quot;. She said her inability to hear the music without in-ear auditory feedback caused the mishap. Carey&#x27;s representatives and Dick Clark Productions placed blame on each other.

On February 3, 2017, Carey released the single &quot;I Don&#x27;t&quot; featuring YG. Later that month, she voiced the Mayor of Gotham City in the animated film &quot;The Lego Batman Movie&quot;. In July 2017, Carey made a cameo in the comedy film &quot;Girls Trip&quot; and embarked on a tour with Lionel Richie, titled, All the Hits Tour. She was also featured in the official remix for French Montana&#x27;s single &quot;Unforgettable&quot;, alongside Swae Lee. In October 2017, Carey released a new soundtrack single, &quot;The Star&quot;, for the movie of the same name. She also voiced a hen named Rebecca in the film. The song was nominated for the Best Original Song at the 75th Golden Globe Awards. Carey additionally developed an animated Christmas film, &quot;Mariah Carey&#x27;s All I Want For Christmas Is You&quot;, for which she recorded an original song called &quot;Lil&#x27; Snowman&quot;. The film was released direct-to-video on November 14, 2017. On December 31, 2017, Carey returned to perform on &quot;Dick Clark&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Rockin&#x27; Eve&quot; after the technical difficulties that hindered her previous performance, in what &quot;The New York Times&quot; described as a &quot;made-for-television act of pop culture redemption&quot;.

=== 2018–2019: &quot;Caution&quot; and &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; reissue ===
In July 2018, Carey embarked on a new Las Vegas residency, The Butterfly Returns, which received critical acclaim. Its first 12 shows in 2018 grossed $3.6 million, with dates later extending into 2019 and 2020. Following the residency, Carey embarked on her Mariah Carey: Live in Concert tour in Asia and returned to Europe with her All I Want for Christmas Is You concert series. In September 2018, Carey announced plans to release her fifteenth studio album later in the year. The project was announced alongside the release of a new song titled &quot;GTFO&quot;, which she performed on September 21, 2018, when she headlined the 2018 iHeartRadio Music Festival. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;With You&quot;, was released in October and performed for the first time at the American Music Awards of 2018. It became Carey&#x27;s highest-charting non-holiday song on the US Adult Contemporary chart since &quot;We Belong Together&quot; in 2005. This was followed by a second single, &quot;A No No&quot;. The album, titled &quot;Caution&quot;, was released on November 16, 2018, and received universal acclaim from critics. By December 2018, the album had been featured on numerous year-end lists by music critics and publications.

In February 2019, Carey commenced the Caution World Tour in support of the album. Later in 2019, Carey engaged in a series of business and television ventures. On September 18, 2019, Carey released &quot;In the Mix&quot;, the theme song for the ABC sitcom &quot;Mixed-ish&quot;. On November 1, 2019, Carey re-released her holiday album &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; for its 25th anniversary. The album package included the original album and another disc which include live performances from Carey&#x27;s 1994 concert at St. John the Divine Church, several tracks from &quot;Merry Christmas II You&quot;, as well as other stand-alone singles such as &quot;Lil Snowman&quot; and &quot;The Star&quot;. On December 5, 2019, it was announced that a mini-documentary titled &quot;Mariah Carey Is Christmas!&quot;, charting the creation and subsequent cultural legacy of &quot;All I Want for Christmas Is You&quot; was to be produced and broadcast on Amazon Music; it premiered later that month. Peaking at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for the first time the same year, the song ended up giving Carey her nineteenth chart-topper in the US.

=== 2020–2023: &quot;The Rarities&quot; and &quot;The Meaning of Mariah Carey&quot; ===
In January 2020, it was announced that Carey would be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Carey celebrated the 30th anniversary of her debut album through 2020, in a promotional campaign billed &quot;#MC30&quot;. The first release consisted of the live EP &quot;The Live Debut – 1990&quot; which was released on July 17, 2020. Her memoir, &quot;The Meaning of Mariah Carey&quot; which was co-written with Michaela Angela Davis, was published in September of the same year. The memoir reached number one on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list after its first week of release. On October 2, 2020, Carey released a compilation album titled &quot;The Rarities&quot;, which includes rare and unreleased songs that Carey recorded at various stages of her career. Its songs included &quot;Save the Day&quot; featuring Lauryn Hill and a cover of Irene Cara&#x27;s &quot;Out Here on My Own&quot;. At the end of October, Carey was featured on Busta Rhymes&#x27; single &quot;Where I Belong&quot;. Carey&#x27;s 2020 Christmas special, &quot;Mariah Carey&#x27;s Magical Christmas Special&quot;, premiered on December 4, 2020, on Apple TV+ along with a soundtrack. A new version of Carey&#x27;s 2010 song &quot;Oh Santa!&quot;, featuring Ariana Grande and Jennifer Hudson, was released as a single the same day. &quot;All I Want for Christmas Is You&quot; topped the UK chart for the first time that month, becoming her third number one in the nation, and spent an unprecedented 69 weeks in its top 40 before reaching the summit.

In July 2021, Carey was featured on the track &quot;Somewhat Loved&quot; from Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis&#x27; debut studio album &quot;Jam &amp; Lewis: Volume One&quot;. On November 5, 2021, Carey released &quot;Fall in Love at Christmas&quot;, which features Khalid and Kirk Franklin. The single was performed on her second Christmas special, &quot;Mariah&#x27;s Christmas: The Magic Continues&quot;. In March 2022, Carey was featured alongside DJ Khaled on the remix of Latto&#x27;s single &quot;Big Energy&quot;, which interpolates Carey&#x27;s 1995 single &quot;Fantasy&quot;. In April, an online course from MasterClass based on singing, in which Carey served as a vocal coach, was released. On September 16, 2022, an expanded version of &quot;Butterfly&quot; was released for the 25th anniversary of the album. In November, Carey released a children&#x27;s picture book titled &quot;The Christmas Princess&quot;, co-written with Michaela Angela Davis and illustrated by Fuuji Takashi. In December 2022, Carey performed two pairs of shows at Scotiabank Arena in Toronto and Madison Square Garden in New York City. Carey also served as a co-producer of &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; on Broadway theatre, a musical based on the 1959 comedy film &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot;. It earned her a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Musical.

In February 2023, the 2009 track &quot;It&#x27;s a Wrap&quot; experienced a revival on TikTok, prompting Carey to release an EP for the song, which included a new sped-up version. On September 8, 2023, she released a deluxe version of &quot;Music Box&quot; in celebration of the album&#x27;s thirtieth anniversary. A remix of &quot;Workin Hard&quot; by Terry Hunter, which featured on the deluxe album, was nominated for Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards. Carey embarked on her 16-date concert tour, Merry Christmas One and All!, which ran from November 15 to December 17, 2023, in the United States. The tour grossed approximately $30 million and sold more than 200,000 tickets.

=== 2024–present: The Celebration of Mimi ===
On February 16, 2024, Carey featured on the remix of Ariana Grande&#x27;s single &quot;Yes, And?&quot;, which was included in the &quot;slightly deluxe&quot; edition of Grande&#x27;s seventh studio album, &quot;Eternal Sunshine&quot;. On April 12, Carey began a new residency at the Dolby Live in Las Vegas titled The Celebration of Mimi. On May 21, Carey appeared on the remix to Muni Long&#x27;s &quot;Made for Me&quot;. In June, Carey released an expanded edition of &quot;Rainbow&quot; to coincide with its twenty-fifth anniversary. While promoting the re-release, she said that new music was being worked on. On November 6, 2024, Carey embarked on Mariah Carey&#x27;s Christmas Time tour to celebrate the 30th anniversary of &quot;Merry Christmas&quot;, concluding after 18 shows on December 17. A thirtieth anniversary edition of &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; was also released.

== Artistry ==
=== Influences ===

Carey has said that from childhood she has been influenced by Billie Holiday, Sarah Vaughan as well as R&amp;B and soul musicians including Al Green, Stevie Wonder, Gladys Knight, Aretha Franklin, and George Michael. Her music contains strong influences of gospel music, and she credits the Clark Sisters, Shirley Caesar, and Edwin Hawkins as the most influential in her early years. When Carey incorporated hip hop into her sound, speculation arose that she was making an attempt to take advantage of the genre&#x27;s popularity, but she told &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;People just don&#x27;t understand. I grew up with this music.&quot; She has expressed appreciation for rappers such as the Sugarhill Gang, Eric B. &amp; Rakim, the Wu-Tang Clan, The Notorious B.I.G. and Mobb Deep, with whom she collaborated on the single &quot;The Roof (Back in Time)&quot; (1998). Carey was heavily influenced by Minnie Riperton, and began experimenting with the whistle register due to her original practice of the range.

During Carey&#x27;s career, her vocal and musical style, along with her level of success, has been compared to Whitney Houston, whom she has also cited as an influence. Carey and her peers, according to Garry Mulholland, are &quot;the princesses of wails... virtuoso vocalists who blend chart-oriented pop with mature MOR torch song.&quot; Author and writer Lucy O&#x27;Brien attributed the comeback of Barbra Streisand&#x27;s &quot;old-fashioned showgirl&quot; to Carey and Celine Dion, and described them and Houston as &quot;groomed, airbrushed and overblown to perfection&quot;. Carey&#x27;s musical transition and use of more revealing clothing during the late 1990s were, in part, initiated to distance herself from this image, and she subsequently said that most of her early work was &quot;schmaltzy MOR&quot;. Some have noted that unlike Houston and Dion, Carey writes and produces her own music.

=== Musical style ===
Love is the subject of the majority of Carey&#x27;s lyrics, although she has written about themes such as loss, sex, race, abuse and spirituality. Andrew Chan of the University of Texas Press identifies &quot;the purging of private emotions&quot; as the main theme of Carey&#x27;s ballads, though he believes several others aim to have an &quot;all-purpose feeling&quot; with mass appeal. Carey has said that much of her work is partly autobiographical, but &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s Christopher John Farley wrote: &quot;If only Mariah Carey&#x27;s music had the drama of her life. Her songs are often sugary and artificial—NutraSweet soul. But her life has passion and conflict,&quot; applying it to the first stages of her career. He commented that as her albums progressed, so too her songwriting and music blossomed into more mature and meaningful material. Jim Faber of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, made similar comments, &quot;For Carey, vocalizing is all about the performance, not the emotions that inspired it. Singing, to her, represents a physical challenge, not an emotional unburdening.&quot; While reviewing &quot;Music Box&quot;, Stephen Holden from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; commented that Carey sang with &quot;sustained passion,&quot; while Arion Berger of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote that during some vocal moments, Carey becomes &quot;too overwhelmed to put her passion into words&quot;. In 2001, &quot;The Village Voice&quot; wrote that &quot;Carey&#x27;s Strawberry Shortcake soul still provides the template with which teen-pop cuties draw curlicues around those centerless [Diane] Warren ballads.&quot;

Carey gained public perception as a balladeer with her first few releases. Following her divorce with Tommy Mottola, Carey broke free of adult contemporary arrangements in favor of what Alex Macpherson of &quot;The Guardian&quot; described as &quot;a lovingly crafted, hip-hop-inflected quiet storm&quot;. Carey often records her layered background vocals, which have been described as &quot;a swooning bank of a hundred Mariahs&quot;. The singer has said that &quot;it&#x27;s because I started out as a backup singer and doing sessions as a background vocalist learning from some of the greatest background vocalists, and also people like Luther Vandross. Growing up, I admired his texture in and of itself but also his use of background vocals&quot;. Carey&#x27;s songwriting is noted for its &quot;eccentric verbosity&quot;. Jeffrey Ingold of &quot;Vice&quot; argues that her lyrics are &quot;among the most verbose in pop music&quot;. Since the beginning of her career, Carey has repeatedly described herself as a songwriter and 
producer and emphasized the importance of being acknowledged for these roles.

Carey&#x27;s output makes use of electronic instruments such as drum machines, keyboards and synthesizers. Many of her songs contain piano-driven melodies, as she was given piano lessons at age six. Carey said that she cannot read sheet music and prefers to collaborate with a pianist when composing her material, but feels that it is easier to experiment with faster and less-conventional melodies and chord progressions using this technique. While Carey learned to play the piano at a young age, and incorporates several ranges of production and instrumentation into her music, she has maintained that her voice has always been her most important asset: &quot;My voice is my instrument; it always has been.&quot;

Carey began commissioning remixes of her material early in her career and helped to spearhead the practice of recording entirely new vocals for remixes. Disc jockey David Morales has collaborated with Carey on several occasions, starting with &quot;Dreamlover&quot; (1993), which popularized the tradition of remixing R&amp;B songs into house records, and which &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; named one of the greatest dance songs. From &quot;Fantasy&quot; (1995) onward, Carey enlisted both hip hop and house producers to re-structure her album compositions. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; included two remixes of &quot;Fantasy&quot; on a list of Carey&#x27;s greatest recordings compiled in 2005: a National Dance Music Award-winning remix produced by Morales, and a Sean Combs production featuring rapper Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard. The latter has been credited with popularizing the pop and hip hop collaboration trend that has continued into the 2000s, through artists such as Ashanti and Beyoncé. Combs said that Carey &quot;knows the importance of mixes, so you feel like you&#x27;re with an artist who appreciates your work—an artist who wants to come up with something with you.&quot;

=== Voice and timbre ===
Carey possesses a five-octave vocal range. Regarding her type of voice, several critics have described her as a lyric coloratura soprano or just a soprano. Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Carey&#x27;s lower register as a &quot;rich, husky alto&quot; that extends to &quot;dog-whistle high notes&quot;. She once described herself as an alto singer. Sasha Frere-Jones of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; adds her timbre on &quot;Vision of Love&quot; possesses various colors, stating, &quot;Carey&#x27;s sound changes with nearly every line, mutating from a steely tone to a vibrating growl and then to a humid, breathy coo.&quot; Chan believes that Carey moved through several &quot;vocal personas&quot; throughout her discography, like the &quot;stentorian, full-throated belting of her first few albums; the fluid mix of chest and 
head voice deployed to masterful effect in the mid-1990s; and the delicate, foggy tones and manic cadences that 
predominated after the turn of the millennium&quot;. In an analysis of Carey&#x27;s voice for ClassicFM, singer Catherine Bott claims that Carey&#x27;s chest voice could go up &quot;higher in pitch&quot; compared to classical singer.&quot;

Her sense of pitch is admired and Jon Pareles adds &quot;she can linger over sensual turns, growl with playful confidence, syncopate like a scat singer... with startlingly exact pitch.&quot; Carey claims that she has had nodules on her vocal cords since childhood, enabling her to sing in a higher register than others. However, tiredness and sleep deprivation can affect them due to the nodules, and Carey explained that she went through a lot of practice as a child to maintain a balance during singing. Carey is noted for her vocal improvisation skills.

Towards the late 1990s, she began incorporating breathy vocals into her material. Tim Levell from BBC News described her vocals as &quot;sultry close-to-the-mic breathiness,&quot; while &quot;USA Today&quot;″s Elysa Gardner wrote &quot;it&#x27;s impossible to deny the impact her vocal style, a florid blend of breathy riffing and resonant belting, has had on today&#x27;s young pop and R&amp;B stars.&quot; In an interview, Ron Givens of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; described it this way, &quot;first, a rippling, soulful ooh comes rolling effortlessly from her throat: alto. Then, after a quick breath, she goes for the stratosphere, with a sound that nearly changes the barometric pressure in the room. In one brief swoop, she seems to squeal and roar at the same time.&quot;

Alex Macpherson of &quot;The Guardian&quot; noted that Carey&#x27;s voice on &quot;Butterfly&quot; is &quot;an instrument of texture rather than volume, with pillows of lavishly layered vocals and nuanced phrasing magnifying the emotional intensity of the songs.&quot; Randy Jackson said that &quot;It&#x27;s in the tone, that buttery tone that she has with her voice that is unbelievably amazing and unbelievably identifiable.&quot;

=== Stage performances and videos ===
Despite being called a &quot;show stopper&quot; and &quot;the 1990s pop phenomenon&quot;, Carey suffered from stage fright in her early years in the music industry. One of her earliest performances was at &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;, which received positive reception as Carey silenced critics saying her vocals were studio-made. Chan identifies the Milli Vanilli lip syncing controversy as a potential contributor to the initial accusations. Carey&#x27;s &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; rendition at the Super Bowl XXXVI was called &quot;stunning&quot; by &quot;Billboard&quot;. She also performed &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; at the 1990 NBA Finals in which &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writer, Brittany Spanos, stated the players were struck &quot;with awe by the incredible talent of a burgeoning young star&quot;. The singer received the only standing ovation of the night at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards, after performing the medley of &quot;We Belong Together and &quot;Fly Like a Bird&quot;. Although Carey&#x27;s performance at &quot;Dick Clark&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Rockin&#x27; Eve 2017&quot; was marred by technical issues, she returned to the stage a year later and, according to &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;effectively redeemed herself&quot;.

Carey is known for being very static during her live performances. Some reviewers credited her stage fright and lack of confidence as the reasoning, while others pointed out that her performances focus on her vocals and the quality of her songs. Her onstage hand gesticulations have usually been mimicked, as the singer has a tendency for &quot;using her hands to point, flutter and sweep through the air as she deftly crests each run&quot;. When reviewing Carey&#x27;s 2014 concert, Michael Lallo wrote that &quot;If you&#x27;re Mariah, you ... stroke your hair a lot. When a high note is on the horizon, you brace yourself by touching your ear and adopting a pained expression, provoking the crowd into losing its collective mind.&quot;

Carey had been open about the fact that she had not been happy with some of her early music videos, and has subsequently been noted for self-directing and co-producing her subsequent videography. The music video for &quot;Fantasy&quot; was the first that Carey directed entirely on her own, and &quot;Honey&quot; pushed Carey further towards hip hop and R&amp;B than before. Its music video gained further attention, as Carey, for the first time in her career, was provocatively dressed, giving viewers a &quot;taste of the freer Mariah.&quot; In 2007, author Saul Austerlitz wrote Carey had been &quot;marketed as a whitebread pop princess&quot; in her earlier music videos, adding the plots, directorial styles, clothes, and auras from later videos like &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; were very different and she was displayed as an &quot;R&amp;B diva&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked Carey 73rd on its list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Music Video Artists of All Time&quot; in 2020, stating that &quot;over three decades, [Carey] has gone from breezy girl next door, flaunting a denim collection as wide as her vocal range, to secret agent, runaway bride and even her own stalker in a collection of music videos that play like mini-dramas&quot;. The music video for &quot;The Roof&quot; was ranked 18th on &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;″s &quot;100 Greatest Music Videos. The music videos for &quot;Honey&quot; and &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; remain among the most expensive ever made, costing over $2 million. In 2021, Carey was honoured at the African American Film Critics Association with a Special Achievement Innovator Award for her &quot;visual storytelling in her music videos and specials&quot;.

== Cultural status ==
Throughout her career, Carey has been called a pop icon, a gay icon, and a fashion icon. &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; and music critics have dubbed Carey the &quot;Songbird Supreme&quot;. She has been labeled a &quot;diva&quot; for her stardom and persona. Her diva persona has received heavy attention, gaining admiration from her fans. Author Lily E. Hirsch argues that while Carey has displayed diva behavior during several incidents in her career, the media&#x27;s association of the term with her is influenced by gender. Carey&#x27;s style has often been described as &quot;eccentric&quot; and &quot;over the top&quot;. Throughout her career, she has also been used in several social media memes, gaining the &quot;Queen of Shade&quot; title from &quot;Elle&quot;. Carey&#x27;s reactions in various interviews have often gone viral, becoming the originator for various memes including &quot;I don&#x27;t know her&quot;.

Carey&#x27;s public image has undergone significant transformations, often receiving heavy media attention. Early in her career, Carey had a polished image, influenced by Mottola and his control over her career. After their separation, Carey took on a more provocative image in her career and has since been called a sex symbol. Her career has received heavy media attention, particularly during the rollout of her 2001 film, &quot;Glitter&quot; which became &quot;tabloid legend&quot;. Academic Shara Rambarran believes that Carey has matched the media&#x27;s intense scrutiny and attention on her personal life through &quot;her diva attitude, performance, identity, and music&quot;.

Carey&#x27;s enduring popularity as a musician has received extensive recognition and often praised for its longevity. She has been credited for her role in breaking down racial barriers in popular culture and facilitating public discourse surrounding multiracialism in the music industry. Carey has also been credited for popularizing the use of melisma amongst her peers and the generation after her, and has often been considered one of the greatest vocalists in pop music. Carey has influenced numerous artists and her music has also been recorded, performed or sampled by a variety of acts. In a 2010 article for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, David Browne wrote that in the early 1990s, &quot;melisma overtook pop in a way it hadn&#x27;t before. Mariah Carey&#x27;s debut hit from 1990, &#x27;Vision of Love&#x27;, [set] the bar insanely high for notes stretched louder, longer and knottier than most pop fans had ever heard&quot;. He added that because of this, various artists have since &quot;built their careers around melisma&quot; including Christina Aguilera, Jennifer Hudson and Beyoncé.

&quot;All I Want for Christmas Is You&quot;, as well as its parent album &quot;Merry Christmas&quot;, have become such a ubiquitous part of wider popular culture that Carey&#x27;s name became synonymous with the season, and she has since been dubbed the &quot;Queen of Christmas&quot;. Multiple media sources have referred to Carey as a holiday icon. The singer has often incorporated holiday-themed outfits during her Christmas shows and music videos.

== Achievements ==
Throughout her career, Carey has earned numerous awards and honors. She has won six Grammy Awards (including a Grammy Global Impact Award), nineteen World Music Awards, ten American Music Awards, and twenty &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards. Carey is one of the best-selling recording artists in history, with more than 220 million records sold. She is also an inductee of the Songwriters Hall of Fame, according to whom she is &quot;the all-time most successful female songwriter in chart history&quot;, and The Long Island Music and Entertainment Hall of Fame. Carey was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2015, and a &quot;Billboard&quot; Icon Award in 2019. In 2023, she became one of the first 13 recipients of the BRIT Billion Award, for surpassing the milestone one billion streams in the United Kingdom.

== Other activities ==
=== Business ventures ===
Declining offers to appear in commercials in the United States during her early career, Carey was not involved in brand marketing initiatives until 2006, when she participated in endorsements for Intel Centrino personal computers and launched a jewelry and accessories line for teenagers, Glamorized, in American Claire&#x27;s and Icing stores. During this period, as part of a partnership with Pepsi and Motorola, Carey recorded and promoted a series of exclusive ringtones, including &quot;Time of Your Life&quot;. She signed a licensing deal with the cosmetics company Elizabeth Arden, and in 2007, she released her own fragrance, &quot;M&quot;. The Elizabeth Arden deal has netted her $150 million. For the fragrance, Carey won a Basenotes Fragrance Award for Best Celebrity Women&#x27;s Fragrance as well as being nominated in three other categories. She has released a series of fragrances with Elizabeth Arden, including Luscious Pink (2008) and Forever (2009). On November 29, 2010, she debuted a collection on HSN, which included jewelry, shoes and fragrances. In November 2011, Carey was announced as &quot;brand ambassador&quot; for Jenny Craig, Inc. which included &quot;participation in a new company initiative... public service announcements and community and education programs.&quot; In 2018, Carey featured in an advertisement for Hostelworld with the tagline &quot;Even Divas are Believers&quot;.

On August 25, 2019, Carey signed a $12 million contract with the Walkers crisps brand as part of their Christmas campaign and starred in a commercial for the company. In December 2020, Carey launched a partnership with Virtual Dining Concepts and restaurateur, Robert Earl, for a biscuit line titled &quot;Mariah&#x27;s Cookies&quot;. In 2021, Carey announced the launch of a new line of alcohol called &quot;Black Irish&quot;, an homage to her Black, Venezuelan, and Irish heritage. That same year, Carey also partnered with McDonald&#x27;s, promoting an entirely new limited time menu. In 2022, Carey recorded nine video lessons for MasterClass titled &quot;Mariah Carey Teaches the Voice as an Instrument&quot;, as well as re-recording &quot;The Roof (Back in Time)&quot; alongside Brandy.

=== Philanthropy and activism ===
Carey is a philanthropist who has been involved with several charitable organizations. She became associated with the Fresh Air Fund in the early 1990s, and co-founded a camp located in Fishkill, New York, that enables inner-city youth to embrace the arts and introduces them to career opportunities. The camp was called Camp Mariah &quot;for her generous support and dedication to Fresh Air children,&quot; and she received a Congressional Horizon Award for her youth-related charity work. Carey has continued her direct involvement with Camp Mariah, and by 2019 the executive director of The Fresh Air Fund reported that &quot;...the kids who have gone to Camp Mariah have higher graduation rates out of high school and college. In 1999, Carey was presented with a Congressional Award for contributing &quot;to expanding opportunities for all Americans through their own personal contributions, and [setting] exceptional examples for young people through their own successes in life. In 2019, she was honored by &quot;Variety&quot; Power of Women for her work with The Fresh Air Fund&#x27;s Camp Mariah.

Carey also donated royalties from her songs &quot;Hero&quot; and &quot;One Sweet Day&quot; to charities. She has worked with the Make-A-Wish Foundation, and in November 2006 she was awarded the Foundation&#x27;s Wish Idol for her &quot;extraordinary generosity and her many wish granting achievements.&quot; Carey has volunteered for the Police Athletic League of New York City and contributed to the obstetrics department of New York Presbyterian Hospital Cornell Medical Center. A percentage of the sales of &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; was donated to various other charities. In 2008, Carey was named Hunger Ambassador of the World Hunger Relief Movement. In February 2010, the song, &quot;100%&quot;, which was originally written and recorded for the film, &quot;Precious&quot;, was used as one of the theme songs for the 2010 Winter Olympics, with all money proceeds going to Team USA. In 2017, Carey was awarded with PETA&#x27;s Angel for Animals Award for promoting animal adoption through her animated movie &quot;All I Want for Christmas Is You&quot;.

One of Carey&#x27;s most high-profile benefit concert appearances was on VH1&#x27;s 1998 &quot;Divas Live&quot; special, during which she performed alongside other female singers in support of the Save the Music Foundation. The concert was a ratings success, and Carey participated in the &quot;Divas 2000&quot; special and a 2016 holiday edition. She appeared at the &quot;&quot; nationally televised fundraiser in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks and performed before peacekeeping troops in Kosovo. Carey hosted the CBS television special &quot;At Home for the Holidays&quot;, which documented real-life stories of adopted children and foster families. In 2005, Carey performed for Live 8 in London and at the Hurricane Katrina relief telethon &quot;Shelter from the Storm&quot;. In August 2008, Carey and other singers recorded the charity single, &quot;Just Stand Up&quot; produced by Babyface and L.A. Reid, to support Stand Up to Cancer. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Carey participated in the iHeart Living Room Concert for America and &quot;Rise Up New York!&quot; telethons to raise money for those affected by COVID-19. In response to the murder of George Floyd, Carey took to social media and sang a snippet of her 1990 song &quot;There&#x27;s Got to Be a Way&quot; while encouraging fans to demand justice.

In 2008, Carey performed in a New Year&#x27;s Eve concert for the family of Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. She later said she felt &quot;horrible and embarrassed&quot; to have taken part in the concert. To make amends, in March 2011, Carey&#x27;s representative Cindi Berger stated that royalties for the song &quot;Save the Day&quot;, written for her fourteenth studio album, would be donated to charities that create awareness for human rights. Berger also said that Carey &quot;has and continues to donate her time, money and countless hours of personal service to many organizations both here and abroad.&quot; &quot;Save the Day&quot; remained unreleased until 2020. In 2013, human rights activists criticized Carey for performing in a concert for Angola&#x27;s &quot;father-daughter kleptocracy&quot; and accused her of accepting &quot;dictator cash&quot;.

== Personal life ==

Carey stated in 2006: &quot;I do believe that I have been born again in a lot of ways. I think what I&#x27;ve changed are my priorities and my relationships with God. I feel the difference when I don&#x27;t have my private moments to pray... I&#x27;m a fighter, but I learned that I&#x27;m not in charge. Whatever God wants to happen is what&#x27;s going to happen. I feel like I&#x27;ve had endless second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth chances. It&#x27;s by the grace of God I&#x27;m still here.&quot;

Carey began dating Tommy Mottola while recording &quot;Mariah Carey&quot;, and they were married at the Episcopal Saint Thomas Church in New York City on June 5, 1993, in a half-million dollar ceremony. The newlyweds moved into a custom-built mansion, located on a estate in Bedford, New York, referred to by Carey as &quot;Sing Sing&quot; (alluding to her feeling imprisoned there). After the release of &quot;Daydream&quot; and the success that followed, Carey began focusing on her personal life, which was a constant struggle at the time. Their relationship began to deteriorate due to their growing creative differences in terms of her music, as well as Mottola&#x27;s controlling nature. They separated in December 1996, and announced it publicly on May 30, 1997. The couple divorced on March 4, 1998. Shortly afterwards they sold their home to Nelson Peltz for $20.5 million; it burned down in 1999.

Carey was in a relationship with baseball player Derek Jeter from 1997 to 1998, and with singer Luis Miguel from 1998 to 2001. She began dating actor and comedian Nick Cannon while conceiving the music video for her song &quot;Bye Bye&quot;, which they filmed together on an island off the coast of Antigua in April 2008. They were married on April 30, 2008, in the Bahamas. That same year, Carey suffered a miscarriage. At 35 weeks into her next pregnancy, she gave birth to their fraternal twins, Moroccan and Monroe, on April 30, 2011, via caesarean section. In August 2014, Cannon confirmed he and Carey had separated. He filed for divorce on December 12, 2014, which was finalized in 2016.

In 2015, Carey began dating Australian billionaire James Packer and, on January 21, 2016, she announced they were engaged. By October, however, they had called off the engagement. In October 2016, she began dating American choreographer Bryan Tanaka. On December 26, 2023, Tanaka confirmed that he and Carey had parted ways after seven years of dating. In April 2018, Carey opened up about taking therapy sessions and medication for her struggle with bipolar II disorder. She was diagnosed in 2001 and initially kept the diagnosis private.

<text>Mervyn Laurence Peake (9 July 1911 – 17 November 1968) was an English writer, artist, poet, and illustrator. He is best known for what are usually referred to as the &quot;Gormenghast&quot; books. The four works were part of what Peake conceived as a lengthy cycle, the completion of which was prevented by his death. They are sometimes compared to the work of his older contemporary J. R. R. Tolkien, but Peake&#x27;s surreal fiction was influenced by his early love for Charles Dickens and Robert Louis Stevenson rather than Tolkien&#x27;s studies of mythology and philology.

Peake also wrote poetry and literary nonsense in verse form, short stories for adults and children (&quot;Letters from a Lost Uncle&quot;, 1948), stage and radio plays, and &quot;Mr Pye&quot; (1953), a relatively tightly structured novel in which God implicitly mocks the evangelical pretensions and cosy world-view of the eponymous hero.

Peake first made his reputation as a painter and illustrator during the 1930s and 1940s, when he lived in London, and he was commissioned to produce portraits of well-known people. For a short time at the end of World War II he was commissioned by various newspapers to depict war scenes. A collection of his drawings is still in the possession of his family. Although he gained little popular success in his lifetime, his work was highly respected by his peers, and his friends included Dylan Thomas and Graham Greene. His works are now included in the collections of the National Portrait Gallery, the Imperial War Museum and The National Archives.

In 2008, &quot;The Times&quot; named Peake among their list of &quot;The 50 greatest British writers since 1945&quot;.

==Early life==
Mervyn Peake was born of British parents in Kuling located on top of Mount Lu in Jiujiang in 1911, only three months before the revolution and the founding of the Republic of China. His father, Ernest Cromwell Peake, was a medical missionary doctor with the London Missionary Society of the Congregationalist tradition, and his mother, Amanda Elizabeth Powell, had come to China as a missionary assistant. Ernest and Amanda met in July 1903 at Kuling (from the English word &quot;cooling&quot;), a summer European missionary resort in Mount Lu about the Yangtze River in Jiujiang. They got married in Hong Kong in December of that same year.

The Peakes were given leave to visit England just before World War I in 1914 and returned to China in 1916. Mervyn Peake attended Tientsin Grammar School until the family left for England in December 1922 via the Trans-Siberian Railway. He would later write a novella about this time, titled &quot;The White Chief of the Umzimbooboo Kaffirs&quot;. Peake never returned to China but it has been noted that Chinese influences can be detected in his works, not least in the castle of Gormenghast itself, which in some respects echoes his birthplace Kuling, the ancient walled city of Beijing, as well as the enclosed compound where he grew up in Tianjin. It is also likely that his early exposure to the contrasts between the lives of the Europeans and of the Chinese, and between the poor and the wealthy in China, also exerted an influence on the Gormenghast books.

His education continued at Eltham College, Mottingham (1923–29), where his talents were encouraged by his English teacher, Eric Drake. Peake completed his formal education at Croydon School of Art in the autumn of 1929, and then from December 1929 to 1933 at the Royal Academy Schools, where he first painted in oils. By this time he had written his first long poem, &quot;A Touch o&#x27; the Ash&quot;. In 1931, he had a painting accepted for display by the Royal Academy and exhibited his work with the so-called &quot;Soho Group&quot;.

==Career==
His early career in the 1930s was as a painter in London, although he lived on the Channel Island of Sark for a time. He first moved to Sark in 1932 where his former teacher Eric Drake was setting up an artists&#x27; colony. In 1934, Peake exhibited with the Sark artists both in the Sark Gallery built by Drake and at the Cooling Galleries in London, and in 1935 he exhibited at the Royal Academy and at the Leger Galleries in London.

In 1936, he returned to London and was commissioned to design the sets and costumes for &quot;The Insect Play&quot;, and his work was acclaimed in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. He also began teaching life drawing at Westminster School of Art where he met the painter Maeve Gilmore, whom he married in 1937. They had three children: Sebastian (1940–2012), Fabian (born 1942), and Clare (born 1949).

Peake had a very successful exhibition of paintings at the Calmann Gallery in London in 1938 and his first book, the self-illustrated children&#x27;s pirate romance &quot;Captain Slaughterboard Drops Anchor&quot; (based on a story he had written around 1936), was first published in 1939 by &quot;Country Life&quot;. In December 1939, he was commissioned by Chatto &amp; Windus to illustrate a children&#x27;s book, &quot;Ride a Cock Horse and Other Nursery Rhymes&quot;, published for the Christmas market in 1940.

===Enlistment===

At the outbreak of World War II, he applied to become a war artist, for he was keen to put his skills at the service of his country. He imagined &quot;An Exhibition by the Artist, Adolf Hitler&quot;, in which horrific images of war with ironic titles were offered as &quot;artworks&quot; by the Nazi leader. Although the drawings were bought by the British Ministry of Information, Peake&#x27;s application was turned down and he was conscripted into the Army, where he served first with the Royal Artillery, then with the Royal Engineers. He began writing &quot;Titus Groan&quot; at this time.

In April 1942, after his requests for commissions as a war artist – or even leave to depict war damage in London – had been consistently refused, he suffered a nervous breakdown and was sent to Southport Hospital. That autumn he was taken on as a graphic artist by the Ministry of Information for a period of six months to work on propaganda illustrations. The next spring he was invalided out of the Army. In 1943 he was commissioned by the War Artists&#x27; Advisory Committee, WAAC, to paint glassblowers at the Chance Brothers factory in Smethwick where cathode ray tubes for early radar sets were being produced. Peake was next given a full-time, three-month WAAC contract to depict various factory subjects and was also asked to submit a large painting showing RAF pilots being debriefed. Some of these paintings are on permanent display in Manchester Art Gallery whilst other examples are in the Imperial War Museum collection.

===Illustration and writing===
The five years between 1943 and 1948 were some of the most productive of his career. He finished &quot;Titus Groan&quot; and &quot;Gormenghast&quot; and completed some of his most acclaimed illustrations for books by other authors, including Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;The Hunting of the Snark&quot; (for which he was reportedly paid only £5) and &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot;, the Brothers Grimm&#x27;s &quot;Household Tales&quot;, &quot;All This and Bevin Too&quot; by Quentin Crisp and Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&quot;, as well as producing many original poems, drawings, and paintings.

Peake designed the logo for Pan Books. The publishers offered him either a flat fee of £10 or a royalty of one farthing per book. On the advice of Graham Greene, who told him that paperback books were a passing fad that would not last, Peake opted for the £10.

A book of nonsense poems, &quot;Rhymes Without Reason&quot;, was published in 1944 and was described by John Betjeman as &quot;outstanding&quot;. Shortly after the war ended in 1945, Edgar Ainsworth, the art editor of &quot;Picture Post&quot;, commissioned Peake to visit France and Germany for the magazine. With writer Tom Pocock, Peake was among the first British civilians to witness the horrors of the Nazi concentration camp at Belsen, where the remaining prisoners, too sick to be moved, were dying before his very eyes. He made several drawings, but not surprisingly he found the experience profoundly harrowing, and expressed in deeply felt poems the ambiguity of turning their suffering into art.

In 1946, the family moved to Sark, where Peake continued to write and illustrate, and Maeve painted. &quot;Gormenghast&quot; was published in 1950, and the family moved back to England, settling in Smarden, Kent. Peake taught part-time at the Central School of Art, began his comic novel &quot;Mr Pye&quot;, and renewed his interest in theatre. His father died that year and left his house in Hillside Gardens in Wallington, Surrey to Peake. &quot;Mr Pye&quot; was published in 1953, and he later adapted it as a radio play. The BBC broadcast other plays of his in 1954 and 1956.

==Later life==
In 1956, Mervyn and Maeve visited Spain, financed by a friend who hoped that Peake&#x27;s health, which was already declining, would be improved by the holiday. That year his novella &quot;Boy in Darkness&quot; was published beside stories by William Golding and John Wyndham in a volume called &quot;Sometime, Never&quot;. On 18 December the BBC broadcast his radio play &quot;The Eye of the Beholder&quot; (later revised as &quot;The Voice of One&quot;), in which an avant-garde artist is commissioned to paint a church mural. Peake placed much hope in his play &quot;The Wit to Woo&quot;, which was finally staged in London&#x27;s West End in 1957, but it was a critical and commercial failure. This affected him greatly – his health degenerated rapidly and he was again admitted to hospital with a nervous breakdown.
During this period he was published primarily in New Worlds, by Michael Moorcock a consistent supporter since the mid-1950s.
===Declining health===
He was showing unmistakable early symptoms of dementia, for which he was given electroconvulsive therapy, to little avail. Over the next few years he gradually lost the ability to draw steadily and quickly, although he still managed to produce some drawings with the help of his wife. Among his last completed works were the illustrations for Balzac&#x27;s &quot;Droll Stories&quot; (1961) and for his own poem &quot;The Rhyme of the Flying Bomb&quot; (1962), which he had written some 15 years earlier.

&quot;Titus Alone&quot; was published in 1959 and was revised in 1970 by Langdon Jones, an editor of &quot;New Worlds&quot;, to remove apparent inconsistencies introduced by the publisher&#x27;s careless editing. Jones, also a composer, set &quot;The Rhyme of the Flying Bomb&quot; to music. A 1995 edition of all three completed Gormenghast novels includes a very short fragment of the beginning of what would have been the fourth Gormenghast novel, &quot;Titus Awakes&quot;, as well as a listing of events and themes he wanted to address in that and later Gormenghast novels.

==Death==
Throughout the 1960s, Peake&#x27;s health declined into physical and mental incapacitation, and he died on 17 November 1968 at a care home run by his brother-in-law, at Burcot, near Oxford. He was buried in the churchyard of St Mary&#x27;s in the village of Burpham, West Sussex.

A 2003 study published in &quot;JAMA Neurology&quot; assessed that Peake&#x27;s death was the result of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).

His work, especially the &quot;Gormenghast&quot; series, became much better known and more widely appreciated after his death. They have since been translated into more than two dozen languages.

==Publications==
Six volumes of Peake&#x27;s verse were published during his lifetime; &quot;Shapes &amp; Sounds&quot; (1941), &quot;Rhymes without Reason&quot; (1944), &quot;The Glassblowers&quot; (1950), &quot;The Rhyme of the Flying Bomb&quot; (1962), &quot;Poems &amp; Drawings&quot; (1965), and &quot;A Reverie of Bone&quot; (1967). After his death came &quot;Selected Poems&quot; (1972), followed by &quot;Peake&#x27;s Progress&quot; in 1979 – though the Penguin edition of 1982, with many corrections, including a whole stanza inadvertently omitted from the hardback edition. &quot;The Collected Poems of Mervyn Peake&quot; was published by Carcanet Press in June 2008. Other collections include &quot;The Drawings of Mervyn Peake&quot; (1974), &quot;Writings and Drawings&quot; (1974), and &quot;Mervyn Peake: the man and his art&quot; (2006). A limited edition of the collected works, issued to celebrate Peake&#x27;s centenary year, was published by Queen Anne Press.

==Archive==
In 2010 an archive consisting of 28 containers of material, which included correspondence between Peake and Laurie Lee, Walter de la Mare and C. S. Lewis, plus 39 Gormenghast notebooks and original drawings for both &quot;Alice Through the Looking Glass&quot; and &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;, was acquired by the British Library. Access to the Archive is available through the British Library website. In July 2020, the British Library acquired from the Peake Estate a visual archive consisting of 300 of Peake&#x27;s original illustrations for children&#x27;s stories, &quot;Gormenghast&quot;, and other works including &quot;Treasure Island&quot;.

== Commemoration ==
Peake&#x27;s three children presented on BBC Radio Four in 2018 a half-hour memoir of their father&#x27;s life, emphasizing the importance of the island of Sark.

The first blue plaque on Sark was unveiled in Peake&#x27;s honour at the Gallery Stores in the Avenue on 30 August 2019.

==Dramatic adaptations of Peake&#x27;s work==
In 1983, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation broadcast eight hour-long episodes for radio dramatising the complete Gormenghast Trilogy. This was the first to include the third book &quot;Titus Alone&quot;.

In 1984, BBC Radio 4 broadcast two 90-minute plays based on &quot;Titus Groan&quot; and &quot;Gormenghast&quot;, adapted by Brian Sibley and starring Sting as Steerpike and Freddie Jones as the Artist (narrator). A slightly abridged compilation of the two, running to 160 minutes, and entitled &quot;Titus Groan of Gormenghast&quot;, was broadcast on Christmas Day, 1992. BBC 7 repeated the original versions on 21 and 28 September 2003.

In 1986, &quot;Mr Pye&quot; was adapted as a four-part Channel 4 miniseries starring Derek Jacobi.

In 2000, the BBC and WGBH Boston co-produced a lavish miniseries, titled &quot;Gormenghast&quot;, based on the first two books of the series. It starred Jonathan Rhys-Meyers as Steerpike, Neve McIntosh as Fuchsia, June Brown as Nannie Slagg, Ian Richardson as Lord Groan, Christopher Lee as Flay, Richard Griffiths as Swelter, Warren Mitchell as Barquentine, Celia Imrie as Countess Gertrude, Lynsey Baxter and Zoë Wanamaker as the twins Cora and Clarice, and John Sessions as Dr Prunesquallor. The supporting cast included Olga Sosnovska, Stephen Fry and Eric Sykes, and the series is also notable as the last screen performance by comedy legend Spike Milligan (as the Headmaster).

A 30-minute TV short film entitled &quot;A Boy in Darkness&quot; (also made in 2000 and adapted from Peake&#x27;s novella) was the first production from the BBC Drama Lab. It was set in a &quot;virtual&quot; computer-generated world created by young computer game designers, and starred Jack Ryder (from &quot;EastEnders&quot;) as Titus, with Terry Jones (&quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;) narrating.

Irmin Schmidt, founder of seminal German Krautrock group Can, wrote an opera called &quot;Gormenghast&quot;, based on the novels; it was first performed in Wuppertal, Germany, in November 1998. A number of early songs by New Zealand rock group Split Enz were inspired by Peake&#x27;s work. The song &quot;The Drowning Man&quot;, by British band The Cure, is inspired by events in &quot;Gormenghast&quot;, and the song &quot;Lady Fuchsia&quot; by another British band, Strawbs, is also based on events in the novels.

Peake&#x27;s play &quot;The Cave&quot;, which dates from the mid-1950s, was given a first public reading at the Blue Elephant Theatre in Camberwell (London) in 2009, and had its world premiere in the same theatre, directed by Aaron Paterson, on 19 October 2010.

In 2011, Brian Sibley adapted the story again, this time as six one-hour episodes broadcast on BBC Radio 4 as the Classic Serial starting on 10 July 2011. The serial was titled &quot;The History of Titus Groan&quot; and adapted all three novels written by Mervyn Peake and the recently discovered concluding volume, &quot;Titus Awakes&quot;, completed by his widow, Maeve Gilmore. It starred Luke Treadaway as Titus, David Warner as the Artist and Carl Prekopp as Steerpike. It also starred Paul Rhys, Miranda Richardson, James Fleet, Tamsin Greig, Fenella Woolgar, Adrian Scarborough and Mark Benton among others.

Sting owned the film rights to the &quot;Gormenghast&quot; novels for a brief period in the 1980s, during which he discussed the possibility of adapting the novels into a series of concept albums, but he abandoned the idea after declaring the Radio 4 audio drama as ideal. As of 2015, author Neil Gaiman was in talks to adapt the novels for the big screen.

== Legacy ==
Authors who have cited Peake as influences on their work include: Neil Gaiman, Joanne Harris, Simon Maginn, Christopher Fowler and Susannah Clarke.

Peake is considered to be one of the Big Three of (secondary world) Fantasy, along with J. R. R. Tolkien and Robert E. Howard. Their equivalents in the science fiction genre are Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke, and Robert A. Heinlein.

<text>Martial arts are codified systems and traditions of combat practiced for a number of reasons such as self-defence; military and law enforcement applications; competition; physical, mental, and spiritual development; entertainment; and the preservation of a nation&#x27;s intangible cultural heritage. The concept of martial arts was originally associated with East Asian tradition, but subsequently the term has been applied to practices that originated outside that region.

==Etymology==

&quot;Martial arts&quot; is a direct English translation of the Sino-Japanese word (, ). Literally, it refers to &quot;武 martial&quot; and &quot;艺 arts&quot;.

The term &quot;martial arts&quot; was popularized by mainstream popular culture during the 1960s to 1970s, notably by Hong Kong martial arts films (most famously those of Bruce Lee) during the so-called &quot;chopsocky&quot; wave of the early 1970s.

According to John Clements, the term &quot;martial arts&quot; itself is derived from an older Latin term meaning &quot;arts of Mars&quot;, the Roman god of war, and was used to refer to the combat systems of Europe (European martial arts) as early as the 1550s. 

The term martial science, or martial sciences, was commonly used to refer to the fighting arts of East Asia (Asian martial arts) up until the 1970s, and the term &quot;Chinese boxing&quot; was also used to refer to Chinese martial arts until then.

Some authors have argued that fighting arts or fighting systems would be more appropriate terms on the basis that many martial arts were never &quot;martial&quot; in the sense of being used or created by professional warriors.

==Variation and scope==

Martial arts may be categorized using a variety of criteria, including:
* Traditional/historical arts vs. contemporary styles: e.g., folk wrestling compared to modern hybrid martial arts.
* Techniques taught: armed vs. unarmed, and within these categories
** armed: by type of weapon (swordsmanship, stick fighting etc.)
** unarmed: by type of combat (grappling, striking, stand-up fighting, ground fighting)
* By application or intent: self-defense, combat sport, choreography or demonstration of forms, physical fitness, meditation, etc.
* Within Chinese tradition: &quot;external&quot; vs. &quot;internal&quot; styles

===By technical focus===
====Unarmed====
Unarmed martial arts can be broadly grouped into those focusing on strikes, those focusing on grappling, and those that cover both fields, often described as hybrid martial arts.

Strikes
* Punching: Boxing, Wing Chun
* Kicking: Kickboxing, Taekwondo, Capoeira, Savate, Karate, Kung Fu, Taekyyon
* Elbow Strike: Bokator, Kung Fu, Karate, Muay Thai
* Knee Strike: Lethwei, Muay Thai, Bokator, Kung Fu
* Others using strikes: Bokator, Lethwei, Muay Thai, Kung Fu, Pencak Silat, Taijiquan, Vovinam
Grappling
* Throwing: Hapkido, Judo, Sumo, Wrestling, Aikido, Shuai Jiao, Taijiquan
* Joint lock/Chokeholds/Submission holds: Jujutsu, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, Catch wrestling, Judo, Chin-na, Taijiquan, Karate
* Pinning Techniques: Judo, Wrestling, Aikido
* Trapping/Clinch fighting: Wing Chun, Filipino Martial Arts, Jeet Kune Do, Muay Thai, wrestling, Judo

====Armed====
The traditional martial arts that cover armed combat often encompass a wide spectrum of melee weapons, including bladed weapons and polearms. Such traditions include eskrima, silat, kalaripayat, kobudo, and historical European martial arts, especially those of the Italian Renaissance. Many Chinese martial arts also feature weapons as part of their curriculum.

Sometimes, training with one specific weapon may be considered a style in its own right, especially in the case of Japanese martial arts, with disciplines such as kenjutsu and kendo (sword), bojutsu (staff), and kyūdō (archery). Similarly, modern martial arts and sports include modern fencing, stick-fighting systems like canne de combat, modern competitive archery and practical shooting.

===By application or intent===
====Combat-oriented====
====Spirituality-oriented==== 
Traditional Korean martial arts place emphasis on the development of the practitioner&#x27;s spiritual and philosophical being. A common theme in most Korean styles, such as Taekkyon, taekwondo, and Hapkido is the value of &quot;inner peace&quot; in a practitioner, which is stressed to be only achievable through individual meditation and training. The Koreans believe that the use of physical force is only justifiable for self defense. Japanese martial arts can be classified as &quot;budo&quot;; the suffix &quot;-do&quot; indicates that the martial art is a path to a correct and full life and that physical training is meant to achieve a spiritual improvement.

Pahlevani and zourkhaneh rituals is the name of a Persian Martial arts inscribed by UNESCO for varzesh-e pahlavāni (, &quot;heroic sport&quot;) or varzesh-e bāstāni (; &quot;varzeš-e bāstānī&quot;, &quot;ancient sport&quot;), a traditional system of athletics originally used to train warriors in Iran (Persia), and first appearing under this name and form in the Safavid era, with similarities to systems in adjacent lands under other names.

==History==

===Historical martial arts===
Human warfare dates back to the Epipalaeolithic to early Neolithic era. The oldest works of art depicting scenes of battle are cave paintings from eastern Spain (Spanish Levante) dated between 10,000 and 6,000 BCE that show organized groups fighting with bows and arrows. Similar evidence of warfare has been found in Epipalaeolithic to early Neolithic era mass burials, excavated in Germany and at Jebel Sahaba in Northern Sudan.

Wrestling is the oldest combat sport, with origins in hand-to-hand combat. Belt wrestling was depicted in works of art from Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt , and later in the Sumerian &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;. The earliest known depiction of boxing comes from a Sumerian relief in Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) from the 3rd millennium BC.

The foundation of modern East Asian martial arts and South Asian martial arts is likely facilitated by cultural exchanges of early Chinese and Indian martial arts. During the Warring States period of Chinese history (480–221 BC) extensive development in martial philosophy and strategy emerged, as described by Sun Tzu in &quot;The Art of War&quot; (). Legendary accounts link the origin of Shaolinquan to the spread of Buddhism from ancient India during the early 5th century CE, with the figure of Bodhidharma, to China. Written evidence of martial arts in Southern India dates back to the Sangam literature of about the 2nd century BCE to the 2nd century AD. The combat techniques of the Sangam period were the earliest precursors to Kalaripayattu

In Europe, the earliest sources of martial arts traditions date to Ancient Greece. Boxing (&quot;pygme&quot;, &quot;pyx&quot;), wrestling (&quot;pale&quot;) and pankration were represented in the Ancient Olympic Games. The Romans produced gladiatorial combat as a public spectacle.

A number of historical combat manuals have survived from the European Middle Ages. This includes such styles as sword and shield, two-handed swordfighting and other types of melee weapons besides unarmed combat. Amongst these are transcriptions of Johannes Liechtenauer&#x27;s mnemonic poem on the longsword dating back to the late fourteenth century. Likewise, Asian martial arts became well-documented during the medieval period, Japanese martial arts beginning with the establishment of the samurai nobility in the 12th century, Chinese martial arts with Ming era treatises such as Ji Xiao Xin Shu, Indian martial arts in medieval texts such as the Agni Purana and the Malla Purana, and Korean martial arts from the Joseon era and texts such as Muyejebo (1598).

European swordsmanship always had a sportive component, but the duel was always a possibility until World War I. Modern sport fencing began developing during the 19th century as the French and Italian military academies began codifying instruction. The Olympic games led to standard international rules, with the Féderation Internationale d&#x27;Escrime founded in 1913. Modern boxing originates with Jack Broughton&#x27;s rules in the 18th century, and reaches its present form with the Marquess of Queensberry Rules of 1867.

===Folk styles===
Certain traditional combat sports and fighting styles exist all over the world, rooted in local culture and folklore. The most common of these are styles of folk wrestling, some of which have been practiced since antiquity and are found in the most remote areas. Other examples include forms of stick fighting and boxing. While these arts are based on historical traditions of folklore, they are not &quot;historical&quot; in the sense that they reconstruct or preserve a historical system from a specific era. They are rather contemporary regional sports that coexist with the modern forms of martial arts sports as they have developed since the 19th century, often including cross-fertilization between sports and folk styles; thus, the traditional Thai art of muay boran developed into the modern national sport of muay Thai, which in turn came to be practiced worldwide and contributed significantly to modern hybrid styles like kickboxing and mixed martial arts. Singlestick, an English martial art can be seen often used in morris dancing. Many European dances share elements of martial arts with examples including Ukrainian Hopak, Polish Zbójnicki (use of ciupaga), the Czech dance odzemek, and the Norwegian Halling.
===Modern history===
====Late 19th to early 20th century====
The mid to late 19th century marks the beginning of the history of martial arts as modern sports developed out of earlier traditional fighting systems. In Europe, this concerns the developments of boxing, wrestling and fencing as sports. In Japan, the same period marks the formation of the modern forms of judo, jujutsu, karate, and kendo (among others) based on revivals of old schools of Edo period martial arts which had been suppressed during the Meiji Restoration In 1882, Kano Jigoro established the Kodokan School of judo which began the sport of judo. Kano Jigoro had gathered the old knowledge of jujutsu before establishing his school of judo.

Modern Muay Thai rules date to the 1920s. In China, the modern history of martial arts begins in the Nanjing decade (1930s) following the foundation of the Central Guoshu Institute in 1928 under the Kuomintang government.

Western interest in Asian martial arts arises towards the end of the 19th century, due to the increase in trade between the United States with China and Japan. Relatively few Westerners actually practiced the arts, considering it to be mere performance. Edward William Barton-Wright, a railway engineer who had studied jujutsu while working in Japan between 1894 and 1897, was the first man known to have taught Asian martial arts in Europe. He also founded an eclectic style named Bartitsu which combined jujutsu, judo, wrestling, boxing, savate and stick fighting.

Fencing and Greco-Roman wrestling was included in the 1896 Summer Olympics. FILA Wrestling World Championships and Boxing at the Summer Olympics were introduced in 1904. The tradition of awarding championship belts in wrestling and boxing can be traced to the Lonsdale Belt, introduced in 1909.
====20th century (1914 to 1989)====
The International Boxing Association was established in 1920. World Fencing Championships have been held since 1921.

As Western influence grew in Asia a greater number of military personnel spent time in China, Japan and South Korea during World War II and the Korean War and were exposed to local fighting styles. Jujutsu, judo and karate first became popular among the mainstream from the 1950s–1960s. Due in part to Asian and Hollywood martial arts movies, most modern American martial arts are either Asian-derived or Asian influenced. The term kickboxing (キックボクシング) was created by the Japanese boxing promoter Osamu Noguchi for a variant of muay Thai and karate that he created in the 1950s. American kickboxing was developed in the 1970s, as a combination of boxing and karate. Taekwondo was developed in the context of the Korean War in the 1950s.

The later 1960s and 1970s witnessed an increased media interest in Chinese martial arts, influenced by martial artist Bruce Lee. Bruce Lee is credited as one of the first instructors to openly teach Chinese martial arts to Westerners. World Judo Championships have been held since 1956, and Judo at the Summer Olympics was introduced in 1964. Karate World Championships were introduced in 1970.

The &quot;kung fu wave&quot; of Hong Kong action cinema in the 1970s, especially Bruce Lee films, popularized martial arts in global popular culture. A number of mainstream films produced during the 1980s also contributed significantly to the perception of martial arts in Western popular culture. These include &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; (1984) and &quot;Bloodsport&quot; (1988). This era produced some Hollywood action stars with martial arts background, such as Jean-Claude Van Damme and Chuck Norris.

Also during the 20th century, a number of martial arts were adapted for self-defense purposes for military hand-to-hand combat. World War II combatives, KAPAP (1930s) and Krav Maga (1950s) in Israel, Systema in Soviet-era Russia, and Sanshou in the People&#x27;s Republic of China are examples of such systems. The US military de-emphasized hand-to-hand combat training during the Cold War period, but revived it with the introduction of LINE in 1989.

====1990 to present====

In 1993, the first Pancrase event was held in Japan. The K-1 rules of kickboxing were introduced, based on 1980s Seidokaikan karate.

During the 1990s, Brazilian jiu-jitsu became popular and proved to be effective in mixed martial arts (MMA) competitions such as the UFC and PRIDE.
Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee were prominent martial artists who became major movie figures. Their popularity and media presence has been at the forefront for promoting Chinese martial arts in the Western world since the late 20th and early 21st centuries.

With the continual discovery of more medieval and Renaissance fighting manuals, the practice of Historical European Martial Arts and other Western Martial Arts have been growing in popularity across the United States and Europe.

On 29 November 2011, UNESCO inscribed Taekkyon onto its Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity List.

=== Revival ===
Many styles of Indian martial arts were banned by the colonial authorities during the period of British rule in India, which led to a decline in their popularity. Some, such as Kalaripayattu, were able to resist this decline by practicing in secret. Other Indian martial art, such as Silambam, while not widely practiced in India, continue to be practiced in other countries in the Indian cultural sphere such as Indonesia and Malaysia. Many other Indian martial arts such as Mardhani Khel and Paika Akhada survived by practitioners practicing the art in secret, or by telling the colonial authorities that it was a form of dance. While many regional Indian martial arts forms are fading into obscurity, martial arts such as Gatka and Kalaripayattu are experiencing a gradual resurgence.

==Testing and competition==

Testing or evaluation is important to martial artists of many disciplines who wish to determine their progression or own level of skill in specific contexts. Students often undergo periodic testing and grading by their own teacher in order to advance to a higher level of recognized achievement, such as a different belt color or title. The type of testing used varies from system to system but may include forms or sparring.

Various forms and sparring are commonly used in martial art exhibitions and tournaments. Some competitions pit practitioners of different disciplines against each other using a common set of rules, these are referred to as mixed martial arts competitions. Rules for sparring vary between art and organization but can generally be divided into &quot;light-contact&quot;, &quot;medium-contact&quot;, and &quot;full-contact&quot; variants, reflecting the amount of force that should be used on an opponent.

===Light- and medium-contact===
These types of sparring restrict the amount of force that may be used to hit an opponent, in the case of light sparring this is usually to &#x27;touch&#x27; contact, e.g. a punch should be &#x27;pulled&#x27; as soon as or before contact is made. In medium-contact (sometimes referred to as semi-contact) the punch would not be &#x27;pulled&#x27; but not hit with full force. As the amount of force used is restricted, the aim of these types of sparring is not to knock out an opponent; a point system is used in competitions.

A referee acts to monitor for fouls and to control the match, while judges mark down scores, as in boxing. Particular targets may be prohibited, certain techniques may be forbidden (such as headbutting or groin hits), and fighters may be required to wear protective equipment on their head, hands, chest, groin, shins or feet. Some grappling arts, such as aikido, use a similar method of compliant training that is equivalent to light or medium contact.

In some styles (such as fencing and some styles of taekwondo sparring), competitors score points based on the landing of a single technique or strike as judged by the referee, whereupon the referee will briefly stop the match, award a point, then restart the match. Alternatively, sparring may continue with the point noted by the judges. Some critics of point sparring feel that this method of training teaches habits that result in lower combat effectiveness. Lighter-contact sparring may be used exclusively, for children or in other situations when heavy contact would be inappropriate (such as beginners), medium-contact sparring is often used as training for full contact.

===Full-contact===

Full-contact sparring or competition, where strikes or techniques are not pulled but used with full force as the name implies, has a number of tactical differences from light and medium-contact sparring. It is considered by some to be requisite in learning realistic unarmed combat.

In full-contact sparring, the aim of a competitive match is to knock out the opponent or to force the opponent to submit.
Where scoring takes place it may be a subsidiary measure, only used if no clear winner has been established by other means; in some competitions, such as the UFC 1, there was no scoring, though most now use some form of judging as a backup. Due to these factors, full-contact matches tend to be more aggressive in character, but rule sets may still mandate the use of protective equipment, or limit the techniques allowed.

Nearly all mixed martial arts organizations such as UFC, Pancrase, Shooto use a form of full-contact rules as do professional boxing organizations and K-1. Kyokushin karate requires advanced practitioners to engage in bare-knuckled, full-contact sparring allowing kicks, knees and punching although punching to the head is disallowed while wearing only a karate &quot;gi&quot;, mouthguard, groin guard for males, or chest guard worn under the karate &quot;gi&quot; for females. Brazilian jiu-jitsu and judo matches do not allow striking, but are full-contact in the sense that full force is applied in the permitted grappling and submission techniques. Competitions held by World Taekwondo requires the use of Headgear and padded vest, but are full contact in the sense that full force is applied to strikes to the head and body, and win by knockout is possible.

===Martial sport===
Martial arts have crossed over into sports when forms of sparring become competitive, becoming a sport in its own right that is dissociated from the original combative origin, such as with western fencing. The Summer Olympic Games includes judo, taekwondo, western archery, boxing, javelin, wrestling and fencing as events, while Chinese wushu recently failed in its bid to be included, but is still actively performed in tournaments across the world. Practitioners in some arts such as kickboxing and Brazilian jiu-jitsu often train for sport matches, whereas those in other arts such as aikido generally spurn such competitions. Some schools believe that competition breeds better and more efficient practitioners, and gives a sense of good sportsmanship. Others believe that the rules under which competition takes place have diminished the combat effectiveness of martial arts or encourage a kind of practice which focuses on winning trophies rather than a focus such as cultivating a particular moral character.

The question of &quot;which is the best martial art&quot; has led to inter style competitions fought with very few rules allowing a variety of fighting styles to enter with few limitations. This was the origin of the first Ultimate Fighting Championship tournament (later renamed UFC 1: The Beginning) in the USA inspired by the Brazilian Vale tudo tradition and along with other minimal rule competitions, most notably those from Japan such as Shooto and Pancrase, have evolved into the combat sport of Mixed Martial Arts (MMA).

Some martial artists compete in non-sparring competitions such as breaking or choreographed routines of techniques such as poomse, kata and aka, or modern variations of the martial arts which include dance-influenced competitions such as tricking. Martial traditions have been influenced by governments to become more sport-like for political purposes; the central impetus for the attempt by the People&#x27;s Republic of China in transforming Chinese martial arts into the committee-regulated sport of wushu was suppressing what they saw as the potentially subversive aspects of martial training, especially under the traditional system of family lineages.

==Health and fitness benefits==
Martial arts training aims to result in several benefits to trainees, such as their physical, mental, emotional and spiritual health.

Through systematic practice in the martial arts a person&#x27;s physical fitness may be boosted (strength, stamina, speed, flexibility, movement coordination, etc.) as the whole body is exercised and the entire muscular system is activated. 
Beyond contributing to physical fitness, martial arts training also has benefits for mental health, contributing to self-esteem, self-control, emotional and spiritual well-being. For this reason, a number of martial arts schools have focused purely on therapeutic aspects, de-emphasizing the historical aspect of self-defense or combat completely.

According to Bruce Lee, martial arts also have the nature of an art, since there is emotional communication and complete emotional expression.

==Self-defense, military and law enforcement applications==
Some traditional martial concepts have seen new use within modern military training. Perhaps the most recent example of this is point shooting which relies on muscle memory to more effectively use a firearm in a variety of awkward situations, much the way an iaidoka would master movements with their sword.

During the World War II era William E. Fairbairn and Eric A. Sykes were recruited by the Special Operations Executive (SOE) to teach their martial art of Defendu (itself drawing on Western boxing and Jujutsu) and pistol shooting to UK, US, and Canadian special forces. The book &quot;Kill or Get Killed&quot;, written by Colonel Rex Applegate, was based on the Defendu taught by Sykes and Fairbairn. Both Fairbairn&#x27;s &quot;Get Tough&quot; and Appelgate&#x27;s &quot;Kill or Get Killed&quot; became classic works on hand-to-hand combat.

Traditional hand-to-hand, knife, and spear techniques continue to see use in the composite systems developed for today&#x27;s wars. Examples of this include European Unifight, the US Army&#x27;s Combatives system developed by Matt Larsen, the Israeli army&#x27;s KAPAP and Krav Maga, and the US Marine Corps&#x27;s &quot;Marine Corps Martial Arts Program&quot; (MCMAP). Unarmed dagger defenses identical to those found in the manual of Fiore dei Liberi and the Codex Wallerstein were integrated into the U.S. Army&#x27;s training manuals in 1942
and continue to influence today&#x27;s systems along with other traditional systems such as eskrima and silat.

The rifle-mounted bayonet which has its origin in the spear, has seen use by the United States Army, the United States Marine Corps, and the British Army as recently as the Iraq War.

Many martial arts are also seen and used in Law Enforcement hand-to-hand training. For example, the Tokyo Riot Police&#x27;s use of aikido.

==Martial arts industry==
Martial arts since the 1970s has become a significant industry, a subset of the wider sport industry (including cinema and sports television).

Hundreds of millions of people worldwide practice some form of martial art.
Web Japan (sponsored by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs) claims there are 50 million karate practitioners worldwide.
The South Korean government in 2009 published an estimate that taekwondo is practiced by 70 million people in 190 countries.

The wholesale value of martial arts related sporting equipment shipped in the United States was estimated at US$314 million in 2007; participation in the same year was estimated at 6.9 million (ages 6 or older, 2% of US population). R. A. Court, CEO of Martial Arts Channel, stated the total revenue of the US martial arts industry at US$40 billion and the number of US practitioners at 30 million in 2003.

===Equipment===
Martial arts equipment can include that which is used for conditioning, protection and weapons. Specialized conditioning equipment can include breaking boards, dummy partners such as the wooden dummy, and targets such as punching bags and the makiwara. Protective equipment for sparring and competition includes boxing gloves, headgear and mouthguards.

===Martial arts fraud===

Asian martial arts experienced a surge of popularity in the West during the 1970s, and the rising demand resulted in numerous low quality or fraudulent schools. Fueled by fictional depictions in martial arts movies, this led to the ninja craze of the 1980s in the United States. There were also numerous fraudulent ads for martial arts training programs, inserted into comic books circa the 1960s and 1970s, which were read primarily by adolescent boys.

In the seventies, lower ranks (kyu) began to be given colorful belts to show progress. This proved to be commercially viable and colored-belt systems were adopted in many martial arts degree mills (also known as &quot;McDojos&quot; and &quot;belt factories&quot;) as a means to generate additional cash. This was covered in the &quot;Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!&quot; episode &quot;Martial Arts&quot; (June 2010).

<doc id="19509" wikidata="Q203066" url="?curid=19509" title="Finitary relation">
<text>In mathematics, a finitary relation over a sequence of sets is a subset of the Cartesian product ; that is, it is a set of &quot;n&quot;-tuples , each being a sequence of elements &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot; in the corresponding &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot;. Typically, the relation describes a possible connection between the elements of an &quot;n&quot;-tuple. For example, the relation &quot;&quot;x&quot; is divisible by &quot;y&quot; and &quot;z&quot;&quot; consists of the set of 3-tuples such that when substituted to &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; and &quot;z&quot;, respectively, make the sentence true.

The non-negative integer &quot;n&quot; that gives the number of &quot;places&quot; in the relation is called the &quot;arity&quot;, &quot;adicity&quot; or &quot;degree&quot; of the relation. A relation with &quot;n&quot; &quot;places&quot; is variously called an n&quot;-ary relation, an n&quot;-adic relation or a relation of degree &quot;n&quot;. Relations with a finite number of places are called &quot;finitary relations&quot; (or simply &quot;relations&quot; if the context is clear). It is also possible to generalize the concept to &quot;infinitary relations&quot; with infinite sequences.

== Definitions ==
; Definition : &quot;R&quot; is an &quot;n&quot;-ary relation on sets is given by a subset of the Cartesian product .

Since the definition is predicated on the underlying sets , &quot;R&quot; may be more formally defined as the ()-tuple , where &quot;G&quot;, called the &quot;graph&quot; of &quot;R&quot;, is a subset of the Cartesian product .

As is often done in mathematics, the same symbol is used to refer to the mathematical object and an underlying set, so the statement is often used to mean is read &quot;&quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; are &quot;R&quot;-related&quot; and are denoted using prefix notation by and using postfix notation by . In the case where &quot;R&quot; is a binary relation, those statements are also denoted using infix notation by .

The following considerations apply:
* The set &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot; is called the th &quot;domain&quot; of &quot;R&quot;. In the case where &quot;R&quot; is a binary relation, &quot;X&quot;1 is also called simply the &quot;domain&quot; or &quot;set of departure&quot; of &quot;R&quot;, and &quot;X&quot;2 is also called the &quot;codomain&quot; or &quot;set of destination&quot; of &quot;R&quot;.
* When the elements of &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot; are relations, &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot; is called a &quot;nonsimple domain&quot; of &quot;R&quot;.
* The set of such that for at least one is called the &quot;i&quot;th &quot;domain of definition&quot; or &quot;active domain&quot; of &quot;R&quot;. In the case where &quot;R&quot; is a binary relation, its first domain of definition is also called simply the &quot;domain of definition&quot; or &quot;active domain&quot; of &quot;R&quot;, and its second domain of definition is also called the &quot;codomain of definition&quot; or &quot;active codomain&quot; of &quot;R&quot;.
* When the th domain of definition of &quot;R&quot; is equal to &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot;, &quot;R&quot; is said to be &quot;total&quot; on its &quot;i&quot;th domain (or on &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot;, when this is not ambiguous). In the case where &quot;R&quot; is a binary relation, when &quot;R&quot; is total on &quot;X&quot;1, it is also said to be &quot;left-total&quot; or &quot;serial&quot;, and when &quot;R&quot; is total on &quot;X&quot;2, it is also said to be &quot;right-total&quot; or &quot;surjective&quot;.
* When , where , , , and is a partition of , &quot;R&quot; is said to be &quot;unique&quot; on , and is called &quot;a primary key&quot; of &quot;R&quot;. In the case where &quot;R&quot; is a binary relation, when &quot;R&quot; is unique on , it is also said to be &quot;left-unique&quot; or &quot;injective&quot;, and when &quot;R&quot; is unique on , it is also said to be &quot;univalent&quot; or &quot;right-unique&quot;.
* When all &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot; are the same set &quot;X&quot;, it is simpler to refer to &quot;R&quot; as an &quot;n&quot;-ary relation over &quot;X&quot;, called a &quot;homogeneous relation&quot;. Without this restriction, &quot;R&quot; is called a &quot;heterogeneous relation&quot;.
* When any of &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot; is empty, the defining Cartesian product is empty, and the only relation over such a sequence of domains is the empty relation .

Let a Boolean domain &quot;B&quot; be a two-element set, say, , whose elements can be interpreted as logical values, typically and . The characteristic function of &quot;R&quot;, denoted by &quot;χ&quot;&quot;R&quot;, is the Boolean-valued function , defined by if and otherwise.

In applied mathematics, computer science and statistics, it is common to refer to a Boolean-valued function as an &quot;n&quot;-ary &quot;predicate&quot;. From the more abstract viewpoint of formal logic and model theory, the relation &quot;R&quot; constitutes a &quot;logical model&quot; or a &quot;relational structure&quot;, that serves as one of many possible interpretations of some &quot;n&quot;-ary predicate symbol.

Because relations arise in many scientific disciplines, as well as in many branches of mathematics and logic, there is considerable variation in terminology. Aside from the set-theoretic extension of a relational concept or term, the term &quot;relation&quot; can also be used to refer to the corresponding logical entity, either the logical comprehension, which is the totality of intensions or abstract properties shared by all elements in the relation, or else the symbols denoting these elements and intensions. Further, some writers of the latter persuasion introduce terms with more concrete connotations (such as &quot;relational structure&quot; for the set-theoretic extension of a given relational concept).

== Specific values of &quot;n&quot; ==
=== Nullary ===

Nullary (0-ary) relations count only two members: the empty nullary relation, which never holds, and the universal nullary relation, which always holds. This is because there is only one 0-tuple, the empty tuple (), and there are exactly two subsets of the (singleton) set of all 0-tuples. They are sometimes useful for constructing the base case of an induction argument.

=== Unary ===
Unary (1-ary) relations can be viewed as a collection of members (such as the collection of Nobel laureates) having some property (such as that of having been awarded the Nobel Prize).

Every nullary function is a unary relation.

=== Binary ===
Binary (2-ary) relations are the most commonly studied form of finitary relations. Homogeneous binary relations (where ) include
* Equality and inequality, denoted by signs such as = and &lt; in statements such as &quot;, or 
* Divisibility, denoted by the sign | in statements such as &quot;.

Heterogeneous binary relations include
* Set membership, denoted by the sign ∈ in statements such as &quot;&quot;.

=== Ternary ===
Ternary (3-ary) relations include, for example, the binary functions, which relate two inputs and the output. All three of the domains of a homogeneous ternary relation are the same set.

== Example ==
Consider the ternary relation &quot;R&quot; &quot;&quot;x&quot; thinks that &quot;y&quot; likes &quot;z&quot; over the set of people , defined by:

&quot;R&quot; can be represented equivalently by the following table:

Here, each row represents a triple of &quot;R&quot;, that is it makes a statement of the form &quot;x&quot; thinks that &quot;y&quot; likes &quot;z&quot;&quot;. For instance, the first row states that &quot;Alice thinks that Bob likes Denise&quot;. All rows are distinct. The ordering of rows is insignificant but the ordering of columns is significant.

The above table is also a simple example of a relational database, a field with theory rooted in relational algebra and applications in data management. Computer scientists, logicians, and mathematicians, however, tend to have different conceptions what a general relation is, and what it is consisted of. For example, databases are designed to deal with empirical data, which is by definition finite, whereas in mathematics, relations with infinite arity (i.e., infinitary relation) are also considered.

== History ==
The logician Augustus De Morgan, in work published around 1860, was the first to articulate the notion of relation in anything like its present sense. He also stated the first formal results in the theory of relations (on De Morgan and relations, see Merrill 1990).

Charles Peirce, Gottlob Frege, Georg Cantor, Richard Dedekind and others advanced the theory of relations. Many of their ideas, especially on relations called orders, were summarized in &quot;The Principles of Mathematics&quot; (1903) where Bertrand Russell made free use of these results.

In 1970, Edgar Codd proposed a relational model for databases, thus anticipating the development of data base management systems.

<text>In several Bantu mythologies, mokele-mbembe (also written as &quot;mokèlé-mbèmbé&quot;) is a mythical water-dwelling entity that is believed to exist in the Congo River Basin. It is variously described as a reptilian creature, a spirit, or a member of the extinct lineage of sauropods.

In the early to mid 20th century, the entity would become a point of focus among adherents of cryptozoology and young Earth creationism, resulting in numerous expeditions led by cryptozoologists and/or funded by young Earth creationists and other groups with the objective to find evidence that invalidates or contradicts the scientific consensus regarding evolution. Paleontologist Donald Prothero remarks that &quot;the quest for Mokele-Mbembe ... is part of the effort by creationists to overthrow the theory of evolution and teaching of science by any means possible&quot;. Additionally, Prothero noted that &quot;the only people looking for mokele-mbembe are creationist ministers, not wildlife biologists.&quot;

Most mainstream experts believe that mokele-mbembe, as reported by Congolese natives, was probably inspired by the black rhinoceros, which once thrived in the region. Historian Edward Guimont has argued that the mokele-mbembe myth grows out of earlier pseudohistorical claims about Great Zimbabwe, and in turn influenced the later reptilian conspiracy theory.

==History==
===20th century===
Source:

The first report of the mokele-mbembe comes from German Captain , as described by Willy Ley in the book &quot;The Lungfish and the Unicorn&quot; (1941). Von Stein was ordered to conduct a survey of German colonies in what is now Cameroon in 1913. He heard stories of an enormous reptile called &quot;Mokele-mbembe&quot; alleged to live in the jungles, and included a description in his official report. According to Ley, &quot;von Stein worded his report with utmost caution,&quot; knowing it might be seen as unbelievable. Nonetheless, von Stein thought the tales were credible: trusted native guides had related the tales to him, and the stories were related to him by independent sources, yet featured many of the same details. Though von Stein&#x27;s report was never formally published, Ley quoted von Stein as writing:

The animal is said to be of a brownish-gray color with a smooth skin, its size is approximately that of an elephant; at least that of a hippopotamus. It is said to have a long and very flexible neck and only one tooth but a very long one; &quot;some say it is a horn&quot;. A few spoke about a long, muscular tail like that of an alligator. Canoes coming near it are said to be doomed; the animal is said to attack the vessels at once and to kill the crews but without eating the bodies. The creature is said to live in the caves that have been washed out by the river in the clay of its shores at sharp bends. It is said to climb the shores even at daytime in search of food; its diet is said to be entirely vegetable. This feature disagrees with a possible explanation as a myth. The preferred plant was shown to me, it is a kind of liana with large white blossoms, with a milky sap and apple-like fruits. At the Ssombo River I was shown a path said to have been made by this animal in order to get at its food. The path was fresh and there were plants of the described type nearby. But since there were too many tracks of elephants, hippos, and other large mammals it was impossible to make out a particular spoor with any amount of certainty.

However, according to Brian Dunning, in a 1929 German book by science author Wilhelm Bölsche called &quot;Dragons: Legend and Science&quot;, Bölsche wrote that von Stein clearly believed that the creature described was not an actual animal, but instead was nothing more than local folklore. 
According to German adventurer Lt. Paul Gratz&#x27;s account from 1911:The crocodile is found only in very isolated specimens in Lake Bangweulu, except in the mouths of the large rivers at the north. In the swamp lives the &quot;nsanga&quot;, much feared by the natives, a degenerate saurian which one might well confuse with the crocodile were it not that its skin has no scales and its toes are armed with claws. I did not succeed in shooting a &quot;nsanga&quot;, but on the island of Mbawala I came by some strips of its skin.

Tales of entities like mokele-mbembe, living saurians or large scientifically unidentified creatures walking around the African rain forest, are not rare; there have been multiple tales of large, smooth-skinned quadrupeds with long necks that fed on large prey still living in central Africa. It was only after the description of the mokele-mbembe surfaced that the rest of the world started interpreting those legends as possessing a dinosaur-like body structure. A notable example would be the emela-ntouka, an elephant-sized creature that shares a lot of similarities with the mokele-mbembe. It is described as having smooth skin, a strong and muscular tail, and a &quot;horn&quot; or &quot;tooth&quot;. Another similar creature, the &quot;jago-nini&quot;, was described by Alfred Aloysius Smith, who had worked for a British trading company in what is now Gabon in the late 19th century, who briefly mentions it in his 1927 memoir.
Reports of entities described to be dinosaur-like in Africa caused a minor sensation in the mass media, and newspapers in Europe and North America carried many articles on the subject in the early 1910s; some took the reports at face value, while others were more skeptical. It is notable that Western Europe and the Americas were going through a pop cultural interest in dinosaurs, of which the Brontosaurus was one of the most popular. This cultural trend could have contributed to both the reports as well as the tendency for newspapers to claim the reported beast was a sauropod.

Several expeditions, of varying scientific credibility, were undertaken in the 20th century to search for mokele-mbembe or interview claimed eyewitnesses. In 1980 and again in 1981, explorer Henry Powell and biologist Roy Mackal visited the Congo region and interviewed native residents. They did not find any direct physical evidence, but nonetheless argued consistent statements from claimed eyewitnesses tended to support the creature&#x27;s existence. Mackal published a book in 1987 detailing his expeditions. Mackal admitted his investigation was &quot;tinged with some romanticism&quot;, but also insisted he had serious scientific intent. Prothero argues the Powell-Mackall expedition almost single-handedly popularized the modern concept of mokele-mbembe to Westerners, yet was seriously flawed. Mackal&#x27;s training was in virology, which arguably did not qualify him to search for a large, exotic creature; and Mackal seemed to uncritically accept eyewitness statements without considering the possibility people might lie or exaggerate for financial gain, for attention, or to impress an American visitor. Furthermore, Mackal was dismissive of Africans who &quot;denied knowledge of mokele-mbeme&quot; or who asserted the creature did not exist. Zoologist Marcellin Agnagna said he took a film of mokele-mbeme in 1983 but the footage did not develop properly. Prothero describes the story as &quot;suspicious&quot;, noting critical details of Agnagna&#x27;s account have changed and none of it was supported by other witnesses. Scottish explorer William &quot;Billy&quot; Gibbons led two expeditions in 1985 and 1992, though Prothero question his motives as a creationist and describes Gibbons as not following even basic scientific principles. Journalist Rory Nugent&#x27;s book &quot;Drums Along The Congo: On The Trail Of Mokele-Mbembe, the Last Living Dinosaur&quot; was published in 1993 by Houghton Mifflin. Nugent&#x27;s book included a photograph he claimed was possibly mokele-mbembe, but which Prothero argues was more likely a floating log.

===21st century===
In 2001, BBC broadcast in the TV series &quot;Congo&quot; a collective interview with a group of Biaka pygmies, who identified the mokele-mbembe as a rhinoceros while looking at an illustrated manual of wildlife. Neither species of African rhinoceros is common in the Congo Basin, and the mokele-mbembe may be a mixture of mythology and folk memory from a time when rhinoceroses were found in the area.

In 2016, a travel documentary crew from South Africa made a documentary about searching for mokele-mbembe, which they later sold to Discovery Africa. The team spent roughly four weeks in the Likuoala swamp region visiting various Aka (pygmy) villages, collecting stories of the creature&#x27;s existence. They pointed out the difficulty of differentiating between a mokele-mbembe&#x27;s metaphysical and physical existence. While they interviewed people who believed in its presence, others stated it died at least a decade ago.

In 2018, Lensgreve of Knuthenborg, Adam Christoffer Knuth, along with a film crew from Danish Radio and a DNA scientist, traveled to Lake Tele in Congo, in search of the mokele-mbembe. They did not find the cryptid; however, they found a new species of green algae.

==Theories==
The lack of physical evidence and the conflicting witnesses have made the existence of the entity doubted by the large majority of scientists and historians. The most reasonable and agreed upon explanation is that the mokele-mbembe is a legend based on the black rhinoceros, a species once common to central Africa, where the stories of the mokele-mbembe originated. According to skeptic Ben Radford, the origin of the creature can be traced back to a 1909 book by zoologist Carl Hagenbeck called &quot;Beasts and Men&quot;. Based on recently discovered dinosaur bones, Hagenbeck speculated that sauropods may still live in Africa. Although he offered no evidence other than legends, the claims were circulated by the press, including &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. Daniel Loxton and Donald Prothero claimed it &quot;launched what would become the modern cryptozoological legend of mokele-mbembe&quot;. They concluded that the reports of the monster were not result of hard evidence or genuine first-hand accounts of native encounters with the creature, but rather a &quot;distillation of many creatively varied stories from widely separated regions. The absence of evidence supporting the creature&#x27;s existence, despite several centuries of Western contact with the region, numerous expeditions in search of the animal, and periodic aerial and satellite surveillance, all of which have detected elephants and other large animals - but no sauropods - all serve to argue against the existence of mokele-mbembe.

* Korean American artist David Choe claimed on an episode of &quot;The Joe Rogan Experience&quot; that as a young man he travelled to the Congo in search of Mokele-mbembe after reading about it in a magazine while he was living in Israel.
* In the World of Darkness universe by White Wolf Publishing, the Mokole are a breed of were-reptiles who serve as the &quot;memory&quot; of Gaia.
* The 2019 film &quot;&quot; mentions a Titan dubbed Mokele-mbembe, though it is not seen in the film. But the creature&#x27;s figure was seen in its misty and foggy containment in Outpost 75 Jebel Barkal, Sudan while it arises and escapes after being awoken by King Ghidorah alongside the other 17 titans. The creature is featured more prominently in the film&#x27;s novelization. 
* In the SCP Foundation, mokele-mbembe is what a village of Mbochi people call a specimen of SCP-1265, specifically a &quot;Camarasaurus&quot;. They also mention Mbielu-Mbielu-Mbielu also being a part of SCP-1265, with it being a &quot;Kentrosaurus&quot;.
* In the book Mortal Engines, Captain Khora&#x27;s airship is named Mokele Mbembe.
* In the second season of the Goblin Slayer anime, the adventurers encounter a large creature referred to as &quot;Mokele Mubenbe&quot;, a huge sauropod-like creature with purple crystals protruding from its hide.

<text>In the philosophy of mathematics, intuitionism, or neointuitionism (opposed to preintuitionism), is an approach where mathematics is considered to be purely the result of the constructive mental activity of humans rather than the discovery of fundamental principles claimed to exist in an objective reality. That is, logic and mathematics are not considered analytic activities wherein deep properties of objective reality are revealed and applied, but are instead considered the application of internally consistent methods used to realize more complex mental constructs, regardless of their possible independent existence in an objective reality.

== Truth and proof ==

The fundamental distinguishing characteristic of intuitionism is its interpretation of what it means for a mathematical statement to be true. In Brouwer&#x27;s original intuitionism, the truth of a mathematical statement is a subjective claim: a mathematical statement corresponds to a mental construction, and a mathematician can assert the truth of a statement only by verifying the validity of that construction by intuition. The vagueness of the intuitionistic notion of truth often leads to misinterpretations about its meaning. Kleene formally defined intuitionistic truth from a realist position, yet Brouwer would likely reject this formalization as meaningless, given his rejection of the realist/Platonist position. Intuitionistic truth therefore remains somewhat ill-defined. However, because the intuitionistic notion of truth is more restrictive than that of classical mathematics, the intuitionist must reject some assumptions of classical logic to ensure that everything they prove is in fact intuitionistically true. This gives rise to intuitionistic logic.

To an intuitionist, the claim that an object with certain properties exists is a claim that an object with those properties can be constructed. Any mathematical object is considered to be a product of a construction of a mind, and therefore, the existence of an object is equivalent to the possibility of its construction. This contrasts with the classical approach, which states that the existence of an entity can be proved by refuting its non-existence. For the intuitionist, this is not valid; the refutation of the non-existence does not mean that it is possible to find a construction for the putative object, as is required in order to assert its existence. As such, intuitionism is a variety of mathematical constructivism; but it is not the only kind.

The interpretation of negation is different in intuitionist logic than in classical logic. In classical logic, the negation of a statement asserts that the statement is &quot;false&quot;; to an intuitionist, it means the statement is &quot;refutable&quot;. There is thus an asymmetry between a positive and negative statement in intuitionism. If a statement &quot;P&quot; is provable, then &quot;P&quot; certainly cannot be refutable. But even if it can be shown that &quot;P&quot; cannot be refuted, this does not constitute a proof of &quot;P&quot;. Thus &quot;P&quot; is a stronger statement than &quot;not-not-P&quot;.

Similarly, to assert that &quot;A&quot; or &quot;B&quot; holds, to an intuitionist, is to claim that either &quot;A&quot; or &quot;B&quot; can be &quot;proved&quot;. In particular, the law of excluded middle, &quot;&quot;A&quot; or not &quot;A&quot;, is not accepted as a valid principle. For example, if &quot;A&quot; is some mathematical statement that an intuitionist has not yet proved or disproved, then that intuitionist will not assert the truth of &quot;A&quot; or not &quot;A&quot;. However, the intuitionist will accept that &quot;A&quot; and not &quot;A&quot;&quot; cannot be true. Thus the connectives &quot;and&quot; and &quot;or&quot; of intuitionistic logic do not satisfy de Morgan&#x27;s laws as they do in classical logic.

Intuitionistic logic substitutes constructability for abstract truth and is associated with a transition from the proof of model theory to abstract truth in modern mathematics. The logical calculus preserves justification, rather than truth, across transformations yielding derived propositions. It has been taken as giving philosophical support to several schools of philosophy, most notably the Anti-realism of Michael Dummett. Thus, contrary to the first impression its name might convey, and as realized in specific approaches and disciplines (e.g. Fuzzy Sets and Systems), intuitionist mathematics is more rigorous than conventionally founded mathematics, where, ironically, the foundational elements which intuitionism attempts to construct/refute/refound are taken as intuitively given.

== Infinity ==

Among the different formulations of intuitionism, there are several different positions on the meaning and reality of infinity.

The term potential infinity refers to a mathematical procedure in which there is an unending series of steps. After each step has been completed, there is always another step to be performed. For example, consider the process of counting: formula_1

The term actual infinity refers to a completed mathematical object which contains an infinite number of elements. An example is the set of natural numbers, formula_2.

In Cantor&#x27;s formulation of set theory, there are many different infinite sets, some of which are larger than others. For example, the set of all real numbers formula_3 is larger than formula_4, because any attempt to put the natural numbers into one-to-one correspondence with the real numbers will always fail: there will always be an infinite number of real numbers &quot;left over&quot;. Any infinite set that can be placed in one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers is said to be &quot;countable&quot; or &quot;denumerable&quot;. Infinite sets larger than this are said to be &quot;uncountable&quot;.

Cantor&#x27;s set theory led to the axiomatic system of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZFC), now the most common foundation of modern mathematics. Intuitionism was created, in part, as a reaction to Cantor&#x27;s set theory.

Modern constructive set theory includes the axiom of infinity from ZFC (or a revised version of this axiom) and the set formula_4 of natural numbers. Most modern constructive mathematicians accept the reality of countably infinite sets (however, see Alexander Esenin-Volpin for a counter-example).

Brouwer rejected the concept of actual infinity, but admitted the idea of potential infinity.

== History ==

Intuitionism&#x27;s history can be traced to two controversies in nineteenth century mathematics.

The first of these was the invention of transfinite arithmetic by Georg Cantor and its subsequent rejection by a number of prominent mathematicians including most famously his teacher Leopold Kronecker—a confirmed finitist.

The second of these was Gottlob Frege&#x27;s effort to reduce all of mathematics to a logical formulation via set theory and its derailing by a youthful Bertrand Russell, the discoverer of Russell&#x27;s paradox. Frege had planned a three-volume definitive work, but just as the second volume was going to press, Russell sent Frege a letter outlining his paradox, which demonstrated that one of Frege&#x27;s rules of self-reference was self-contradictory. In an appendix to the second volume, Frege acknowledged that one of the axioms of his system did in fact lead to Russell&#x27;s paradox.

Frege, the story goes, plunged into depression and did not publish the third volume of his work as he had planned. For more see Davis (2000) Chapters 3 and 4: Frege: &quot;From Breakthrough to Despair&quot; and Cantor: &quot;Detour through Infinity.&quot; See van Heijenoort for the original works and van Heijenoort&#x27;s commentary.

These controversies are strongly linked as the logical methods used by Cantor in proving his results in transfinite arithmetic are essentially the same as those used by Russell in constructing his paradox. Hence how one chooses to resolve Russell&#x27;s paradox has direct implications on the status accorded to Cantor&#x27;s transfinite arithmetic.

In the early twentieth century L. E. J. Brouwer represented the &quot;intuitionist&quot; position and David Hilbert the formalist position—see van Heijenoort. Kurt Gödel offered opinions referred to as &quot;Platonist&quot; (see various sources re Gödel). Alan Turing considers:
&quot;non-constructive systems of logic with which not all the steps in a proof are mechanical, some being intuitive&quot;. Later, Stephen Cole Kleene brought forth a more rational consideration of intuitionism in his &quot;Introduction to metamathematics&quot; (1952).

Nicolas Gisin is adopting intuitionist mathematics to reinterpret quantum indeterminacy, information theory and the physics of time.

<text>The Mishnah or the Mishna (; , from the verb &quot;šānā&quot;, &quot;to study and review,&quot; also &quot;secondary&quot;) is the first written collection of the Jewish oral traditions that are known as the Oral Torah. It is also the first work of rabbinic literature, with the oldest surviving material dating to the 6th to 7th centuries CE. 

The Mishnah was redacted by Judah ha-Nasi probably in Beit Shearim or Sepphoris between the ending of the second century CE and the beginning of the third century in a time when the persecution of Jews and the passage of time raised the possibility that the details of the oral traditions of the Pharisees from the Second Temple period (516 BCE – 70 CE) would be forgotten.

Most of the Mishnah is written in Mishnaic Hebrew, but some parts are in Jewish Palestinian Aramaic. 

==Six orders==

The term &quot;Mishnah&quot; originally referred to a method of teaching by presenting topics in a systematic order, as contrasted with &quot;&quot;, which followed the order of the Bible. As a written compilation, the order of the Mishnah is by subject matter and includes a much broader selection of halakhic subjects and discusses individual subjects more thoroughly than the &quot;Midrash&quot;.

The Mishnah consists of six orders (&#x27;, singular &#x27; ), each containing 7–12 tractates (&#x27;, singular &#x27; ; lit. &quot;web&quot;), 63 in total. Each &#x27; is divided into chapters (&#x27;, singular &#x27;) and then paragraphs (&#x27;, singular &quot;&quot;). In this last context, the word &quot;mishnah&quot; means a single paragraph of the work, i.e. the smallest unit of structure, leading to the use of the plural, &quot;Mishnayot&quot;, for the whole work.

Because of the division into six orders, the Mishnah is sometimes called Shas (an acronym for &quot;Shisha Sedarim&quot; – the &quot;six orders&quot;), although that term is more often used for the Talmud as a whole.

The six orders are:
* &quot;Zeraim&quot; (&quot;Seeds&quot;), dealing with prayer and blessings, tithes and agricultural laws (11 tractates)
* &quot;Moed&quot; (&quot;Festival&quot;), about the laws of the Sabbath and the Festivals (12 tractates)
* &quot;Nashim&quot; (&quot;Women&quot;), concerning marriage and divorce, some forms of oaths and the laws of the nazirite (7 tractates)
* &quot;Nezikin&quot; (&quot;Damages&quot;), dealing with civil and criminal law, the functioning of the courts and oaths (10 tractates)
* &quot;Kodashim&quot; (&quot;Holy things&quot;), regarding sacrificial rites, the Temple, and the dietary laws (11 tractates) and
* &quot;Tohorot&quot; (&quot;Purities&quot;), pertaining to the laws of purity and impurity, including the impurity of the dead, food purity, and bodily purity (12 tractates).

The acronym &quot;Z&#x27;MaN NaKaT&quot; is a popular mnemonic for these orders. In each order (with the exception of Zeraim), tractates are arranged from biggest (in number of chapters) to smallest.

The Babylonian Talmud (Hagiga 14a) states that there were either six hundred or seven hundred orders of the Mishnah. The Mishnah was divided into six thematic sections by its author, Judah HaNasi. There is also a tradition that Ezra the scribe dictated from memory not only the 24 books of the Tanakh but 60 esoteric books. It is not known whether this is a reference to the Mishnah, but there is a case for saying that the Mishnah does consist of 60 tractates. (The current total is 63, but Makkot was originally part of Sanhedrin, and Bava Kamma (literally: &quot;First Portal&quot;), Bava Metzia (&quot;Middle Portal&quot;) and Bava Batra (&quot;Final Portal&quot;) are often regarded as subdivisions of one enormous tractate, titled simply Nezikin.)

===Omissions===
A number of important laws are not elaborated upon in the Mishnah. These include the laws of tzitzit, tefillin (phylacteries), mezuzot, the holiday of Hanukkah, and the laws of conversion to Judaism. These were later discussed in the minor tractates.

Nissim ben Jacob&#x27;s &quot;Hakdamah Le&#x27;mafteach Hatalmud&quot; argued that it was unnecessary for &quot;Judah the Prince&quot; to discuss them as many of these laws were so well known. Margolies suggests that as the Mishnah was redacted after the Bar Kokhba revolt, Judah could not have included discussion of Hanukkah, which commemorates the Jewish revolt against the Seleucid Empire (the Romans would not have tolerated this overt nationalism). Similarly, there were then several decrees in place aimed at suppressing outward signs of national identity, including decrees against wearing tefillin and tzitzit; as conversion to Judaism was against Roman law, Judah would not have discussed this.

David Zvi Hoffmann suggests that there existed ancient texts analogous to the present-day &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; that discussed the basic laws of day to day living and it was therefore not necessary to focus on these laws in the Mishnah.

===Mishnah, Gemara, and Talmud===
Rabbinic commentary, debate and analysis on the Mishnah from the next four centuries, done in the Land of Israel and in Babylonia, were eventually redacted and compiled as well. In themselves they are known as &quot;Gemara&quot;. The books which set out the Mishnah in its original structure, together with the associated &quot;Gemara&quot;, are known as Talmuds. Two Talmuds were compiled, the Babylonian Talmud (to which the term &quot;Talmud&quot; normally refers) and the Jerusalem Talmud, with the oldest surviving Talmudic manuscripts dating to the 8th century CE. Unlike the Hebrew Mishnah, the &quot;Gemara&quot; is written primarily in Aramaic.

==Content and purpose==

The Mishnah teaches the oral traditions by example, presenting actual cases being brought to judgment, usually along with (i) the &quot;debate&quot; on the matter, and (ii) the judgment that was given by a notable rabbi based on halakha, mitzvot, and spirit of the teaching (&quot;Torah&quot;) that guided his decision.

In this way, the Mishnah brings to everyday reality the practice of the 613 Commandments presented in the Torah and aims to cover all aspects of human living, serve as an example for future judgments, and, most important, demonstrate pragmatic exercise of the Biblical laws, which was much needed since the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE. The Mishnah is thus a collection of existing traditions rather than new law.

The term &quot;Mishnah&quot; is related to the verb &quot;to teach, repeat&quot;, and to adjectives meaning &quot;second&quot;. It is thus named for being both the one written authority (codex) secondary (only) to the Tanakh as a basis for the passing of judgment, a source and a tool for creating laws, and the first of many books to complement the Tanakh in certain aspects.

===Oral law===

Before the publication of the Mishnah, Jewish scholarship and judgement were predominantly oral, as according to the Talmud, it was not permitted to write them down. The earliest recorded oral law may have been of the midrashic form, in which halakhic discussion is structured as exegetical commentary on the Torah, with the oldest surviving written material dating to the 6th to 7th centuries CE. Rabbis expounded on and debated the Tanakh without the benefit of written works (other than the Biblical books themselves). However, some may have made private notes () for example of court decisions. The oral traditions were far from monolithic and varied among various schools, the most famous of which were the Houses of Hillel and Shammai.

After the First Jewish–Roman War in 70 CE, with the end of the Second Temple center in Jerusalem, Jewish social and legal norms were in upheaval. The rabbis faced the new reality of Judaism without a Temple to serve as the center of teaching and study and a Judea without autonomy. During this period, Rabbinic discourse began to be recorded in writing. The possibility was felt that the details of the oral traditions of the Pharisees from the Second Temple period (530s BCE / 3230s AM – 70 CE/ 3830 AM) would be forgotten, so the justification was found to have these oral laws transcribed.

Over time, different traditions of the Oral Law came into being, raising problems of interpretation. According to the &quot;Mevo Hatalmud&quot;, many rulings were given in a specific context but would be taken out of it, or a verdict was revisited, but the second ruling would not become popularly known. To correct this, Judah the Prince took up the redaction of the Mishnah. If a point was of no conflict, he kept its language; where there was conflict, he reordered the opinions and ruled and clarified where context was not given. The idea was not to use his discretion but to examine the tradition as far back as he could and only supplement as required.

===The Mishnah and the Hebrew Bible===
According to Rabbinic Judaism, the Oral Torah () was given to Moses at Sinai or Mount Horeb as an exposition to the Torah. The accumulated traditions of the Oral Law, expounded by scholars in each generation from Moses onward, are considered the necessary basis for the interpretation, and often for the reading, of the Written Law. Jews sometimes refer to this as the &quot;Masora&quot; (), roughly translated as &quot;tradition&quot;. However, that word is often used in a narrower sense to mean traditions concerning the editing and reading of the Biblical text (see Masoretic Text). The resulting Jewish law and custom is called halakha.

While most discussions in the Mishnah concern the correct way to carry out laws recorded in the Torah, it usually presents its conclusions without explicitly linking them to any scriptural passage, though scriptural quotations do occur. For this reason it is arranged in order of topics rather than in the form of a Biblical commentary. (In a very few cases, there is no scriptural source at all and the law is described as &quot;Halakha leMoshe miSinai&quot;, &quot;law to Moses from Sinai&quot;.) The &quot;Midrash halakha&quot; presents similar laws in the form of a Biblical commentary and explicitly links its conclusions to details in the Biblical text. These Midrashim often predate the Mishnah.

The Mishnah also quotes the Torah for principles not associated with law but just as practical advice, even at times for humor or as guidance for understanding historical debates.

===Rejection===
Some Jews do not accept the codification of the oral law at all. Karaite Judaism, for example, recognises only the Tanakh as authoritative in &quot;Halakha&quot; (Jewish religious law) and theology. It rejects the codification of the Oral Torah in the Mishnah and Talmud and subsequent works of mainstream Rabbinic Judaism which maintain that the Talmud is an authoritative interpretation of the Torah. Karaites maintain that all of the divine commandments handed down to Moses by God were recorded in the written Torah without additional Oral Law or explanation. As a result, Karaite Jews do not accept as binding the written collections of the oral tradition in the Midrash or Talmud. The Karaites comprised a significant portion of the world Jewish population in the 10th and 11th centuries CE, and remain extant, although today their numbers have been reduced to around a mere 50,000.

==Authorship==

The rabbis who contributed to the Mishnah are known as the &quot;Tannaim&quot;, of whom approximately 120 are known. The period during which the Mishnah was assembled spanned about 130 years, or five generations, in the first and second centuries CE. Judah ha-Nasi is credited with the final redaction and publication of the Mishnah, although there have been a few additions since his time: those passages that cite him or his grandson (Judah II), and the end of tractate Sotah (which refers to the period after Judah&#x27;s death). In addition to redacting the Mishnah, Judah and his court also ruled on which opinions should be followed, although the rulings do not always appear in the text.

Most of the Mishnah is related without attribution (&quot;). This usually indicates that many sages taught so, or that Judah the Prince ruled so. The halakhic ruling usually follows that view. Sometimes, however, it appears to be the opinion of a single sage, and the view of the sages collectively (, &quot;hachamim&quot;) is given separately.

As Judah the Prince went through the tractates, the Mishnah was set forth, but throughout his life some parts were updated as new information came to light. Because of the proliferation of earlier versions, it was deemed too hard to retract anything already released, and therefore a second version of certain laws were released. The Talmud refers to these differing versions as &#x27; (&quot;First Mishnah&quot;) and &#x27; (&quot;Last Mishnah&quot;). David Zvi Hoffmann suggests that &quot;Mishnah Rishonah&quot; actually refers to texts from earlier Sages upon which Rebbi based his Mishnah.

The Talmud records a tradition that unattributed statements of the law represent the views of Rabbi Meir (Sanhedrin 86a), which supports the theory (recorded by Sherira Gaon in his famous &quot;Iggeret&quot;) that he was the author of an earlier collection. For this reason, the few passages that actually say &quot;this is the view of Rabbi Meir&quot; represent cases where the author intended to present Rabbi Meir&#x27;s view as a &quot;minority opinion&quot; not representing the accepted law.

There are also references to the &quot;Mishnah of Rabbi Akiva&quot;, suggesting a still earlier collection; on the other hand, these references may simply mean his teachings in general. Another possibility is that Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Meir established the divisions and order of subjects in the Mishnah, making them the authors of a school curriculum rather than of a book.

Authorities are divided on whether Rabbi Judah the Prince recorded the Mishnah in writing or established it as an oral text for memorisation. The most important early account of its composition, the &quot;Iggeret Rav Sherira Gaon&quot; (Epistle of Rabbi Sherira Gaon) is ambiguous on the point, although the Spanish recension leans to the theory that the Mishnah was written. However, the Talmud records that, in every study session, there was a person called the &quot;tanna&quot; appointed to recite the Mishnah passage under discussion. This may indicate that, even if the Mishnah was reduced to writing, it was not available on general distribution.

==Mishnah studies==
===Textual variants===
Very roughly, there are two traditions of Mishnah text. One is found in manuscripts and printed editions of the Mishnah on its own, or as part of the Jerusalem Talmud. The other is found in manuscripts and editions of the Babylonian Talmud; though there is sometimes a difference between the text of a whole paragraph printed at the beginning of a discussion (which may be edited to conform with the text of the Mishnah-only editions) and the line-by-line citations in the course of the discussion.

Robert Brody, in his &quot;Mishna and Tosefta Studies&quot; (Jerusalem 2014), warns against oversimplifying the picture by assuming that the Mishnah-only tradition is always the more authentic, or that it represents a &quot;Palestinian&quot; as against a &quot;Babylonian&quot; tradition. Manuscripts from the Cairo Geniza, or citations in other works, may support either type of reading or other readings altogether.

===Manuscripts===
Mostly-complete manuscripts (mss.) bolded. Each is missing pages, some of which have been replaced by later hands. 
The earliest extant material witness to rabbinic literature of any kind is dated to the 6th to 7th centuries CE, see Mosaic of Rehob.

The Literature of the Jewish People in the Period of the Second Temple and the Talmud, Volume 3 The Literature of the Sages: First Part: Oral Tora, Halakha, Mishna, Tosefta, Talmud, External Tractates. &quot;Compendia Rerum Iudaicarum ad Novum Testamentum&quot;, Ed. Shmuel Safrai, Brill, 1987, 

===Printed editions===
The first printed edition of the Mishnah was published in Naples. There have been many subsequent editions, including the late 19th century Vilna edition, which is the basis of the editions now used by the religious public.

Vocalized editions were published in Italy, culminating in the edition of David ben Solomon Altaras, publ. Venice 1737. The Altaras edition was republished in Mantua in 1777, in Pisa in 1797 and 1810 and in Livorno in many editions from 1823 until 1936: reprints of the vocalized Livorno editions were published in Israel in 1913, 1962, 1968 and 1976. These editions show some textual variants by bracketing doubtful words and passages, though they do not attempt detailed textual criticism. The Livorno editions are the basis of the Sephardic tradition for recitation.

As well as being printed on its own, the Mishnah is included in all editions of the Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmuds. Each paragraph is printed on its own, and followed by the relevant Gemara discussion. However, that discussion itself often cites the Mishnah line by line. While the text printed in paragraph form has generally been standardized to follow the Vilna edition, the text cited line by line in the Gemara often preserves important variants, which sometimes reflect the readings of older manuscripts.

The nearest approach to a critical edition is that of Hanoch Albeck. There is also an edition by Yosef Qafiḥ of the Mishnah together with the commentary of Maimonides, which compares the base text used by Maimonides with the Napoli and Vilna editions and other sources.

===Oral traditions and pronunciation===
The Mishnah was and still is traditionally studied through recitation (out loud). Jewish communities around the world preserved local melodies for chanting the Mishnah, and distinctive ways of pronouncing its words.

Many medieval manuscripts of the Mishnah are vowelized, and some of these, especially some fragments found in the Genizah, are partially annotated with Tiberian cantillation marks.

Today, many communities have a special tune for the Mishnaic passage &quot;Bammeh madliqin&quot; in the Friday night service; there may also be tunes for Mishnaic passages in other parts of the liturgy, such as the passages in the daily prayers relating to sacrifices and incense and the paragraphs recited at the end of the Musaf service on Shabbat. Otherwise, there is often a customary intonation used in the study of Mishnah or Talmud, somewhat similar to an Arabic mawwal, but this is not reduced to a precise system like that for the Biblical books. (In some traditions this intonation is the same as or similar to that used for the Passover Haggadah.) Recordings have been made for Israeli national archives, and Frank Alvarez-Pereyre has published a book-length study of the Syrian tradition of Mishnah reading on the basis of these recordings.

Most vowelized editions of the Mishnah today reflect standard Ashkenazic vowelization, and often contain mistakes. The Albeck edition of the Mishnah was vocalized by Hanoch Yelon, who made careful eclectic use of both medieval manuscripts and current oral traditions of pronunciation from Jewish communities all over the world. The Albeck edition includes an introduction by Yelon detailing his eclectic method.

Two institutes at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem have collected major oral archives which hold extensive recordings of Jews chanting the Mishnah using a variety of melodies and many different kinds of pronunciation. These institutes are the Jewish Oral Traditions Research Center and the National Voice Archives (the &quot;Phonoteca&quot; at the Jewish National and University Library). See below for external links.
===As a historical source===
Both the Mishnah and Talmud contain little serious biographical studies of the people discussed therein, and the same tractate will conflate the points of view of many different people. Yet, sketchy biographies of the Mishnaic sages can often be constructed with historical detail from Talmudic and Midrashic sources.

According to the Encyclopaedia Judaica (Second Edition), it is accepted that Judah the Prince added, deleted, and rewrote his source material during the process of redacting the Mishnah between the ending of the second century and the beginning of the 3rd century CE. Modern authors who have provided examples of these changes include J.N. Epstein and S. Friedman.

Following Judah the Prince&#x27;s redaction there remained a number of different versions of the Mishnah in circulation. The Mishnah used in the Babylonian rabbinic community differing markedly from that used in the Palestinian one. Indeed within these rabbinic communities themselves there are indications of different versions being used for study. These differences are shown in divergent citations of individual Mishnah passages in the Talmud Yerushalmi and the Talmud Bavli, and in variances of medieval manuscripts and early editions of the Mishnah. The best known examples of these differences is found in J.N.Epstein&#x27;s Introduction to the Text of the Mishnah (1948).

Epstein has also concluded that the period of the Amoraim was one of further deliberate changes to the text of the Mishnah, which he views as attempts to return the text to what was regarded as its original form. These lessened over time, as the text of the Mishnah became more and more regarded as authoritative.

Many modern historical scholars have focused on the timing and the formation of the Mishnah. A vital question is whether it is composed of sources which date from its editor&#x27;s lifetime, and to what extent is it composed of earlier, or later sources. Are Mishnaic disputes distinguishable along theological or communal lines, and in what ways do different sections derive from different schools of thought within early Judaism? Can these early sources be identified, and if so, how? In response to these questions, modern scholars have adopted a number of different approaches.
* Some scholars hold that there has been extensive editorial reshaping of the stories and statements within the Mishnah (and later, in the Talmud). Lacking outside confirming texts, they hold that we cannot confirm the origin or date of most statements and laws, and that we can say little for certain about their authorship. In this view, the questions above are impossible to answer. See, for example, the works of Louis Jacobs, Baruch M. Bokser, Shaye J. D. Cohen, Steven D. Fraade.
* Some scholars hold that the Mishnah and Talmud have been extensively shaped by later editorial redaction, but that it contains sources which we can identify and describe with some level of reliability. In this view, sources can be identified to some extent because each era of history and each distinct geographical region has its own unique features, which one can trace and analyze. Thus, the questions above may be analyzed. See, for example, the works of Goodblatt, Lee Levine, David C. Kraemer and Robert Goldenberg.
* Some scholars hold that many or most of the statements and events described in the Mishnah and Talmud usually occurred more or less as described, and that they can be used as serious sources of historical study. In this view, historians do attempt to tease out later editorial additions leaving behind a possible historical text. See, for example, the works of Saul Lieberman, David Weiss Halivni, Avraham Goldberg and Dov Zlotnick.

==Commentaries==

The main work discussing the Mishnah is the Talmud, as outlined.
However, the Talmud is not usually viewed as a commentary on the Mishnah &quot;per se&quot;, because:
the Talmud also has many other goals; its analysis — &quot;Gemara&quot; — often entails long, tangential discussions; and neither version of the Talmud covers the entire Mishnah (each covers about 50–70% of the text). As a result, numerous commentaries-proper on the Mishna have been written, typically intended to allow for the study of the work without requiring direct reference to (and facility for) the &quot;Gemara&quot;.

Mishnah study, independent of the Talmud, was a marginal phenomenon before the late 15th century. The few commentaries that had been published tended to be limited to the tractates not covered by the Talmud, while Maimonides&#x27; commentary was written in Judeo-Arabic and thus inaccessible to many Jewish communities. Dedicated Mishnah study grew vastly in popularity beginning in the late 16th century, due to the kabbalistic emphasis on Mishnah study and as a reaction against the methods of pilpul; it was aided by the spread of Bertinoro&#x27;s accessible Hebrew Mishnah commentary around this time.

===List of commentaries===
Commentaries by Rishonim:
* In 1168, Maimonides (Rambam) published &quot;Kitab as-Siraj&quot; (The Book of the Lantern, ) a comprehensive commentary on the Mishnah. It was written in Arabic using Hebrew letters (what is termed Judeo-Arabic) and was one of the first commentaries of its kind. In it, Rambam condensed the associated Talmudical debates, and offered his conclusions in a number of undecided issues. Of particular significance are the various introductory sections – as well as the introduction to the work itself – these are widely quoted in other works on the Mishnah, and on the Oral law in general. Perhaps the most famous is his introduction to the tenth chapter of tractate Sanhedrin where he enumerates the thirteen fundamental beliefs of Judaism. An (incomplete) Hebrew translation was composed by the Ibn Tibbon family; a modern Hebrew translation is by Rabbi Yosef Kapach. 
* Rabbi Samson of Sens (&quot;the Rash&quot;) was, apart from Maimonides, one of the few rabbis of the early medieval era to compose a Mishnah commentary on some tractates. It is printed in many editions of the Mishnah. It is interwoven with his commentary on major parts of the Tosefta.
* Asher ben Jehiel (Rosh)&#x27;s commentary on some tractates
* Menachem Meiri&#x27;s commentary on most of the Mishnah, &quot;Beit HaBechirah&quot;, providing a digest of the Talmudic-discussion and Rishonim there
* An 11th-century CE commentary of the Mishnah, composed by Rabbi Nathan ben Abraham, President of the Academy in &quot;Eretz Israel&quot;. This relatively unknown commentary was first printed in Israel in 1955.
* A 12th-century Italian commentary of the Mishnah, made by Rabbi Isaac ben Melchizedek (only &quot;Seder Zera&#x27;im&quot; is known to have survived)

Prominent commentaries by early Acharonim:
* Rabbi Obadiah ben Abraham of Bertinoro (15th century) wrote one of the most popular Mishnah commentaries. He draws on Maimonides&#x27; work but also offers Talmudical material (in effect a summary of the Talmudic discussion) largely following the commentary of Rashi. In addition to its role as a Mishnah commentary, this work is often used by students of Talmud as a review-text and is often referred to as &quot;the &quot;Bartenura&quot;&quot; or &quot;the &quot;Ra&#x27;V&quot;&quot;.
* Yomtov Lipman Heller wrote a commentary called &quot;Tosefet Yom Tov.&quot; In the introduction Heller says that his aim is to add a supplement (&quot;tosefet&quot;) to Bertinoro&#x27;s commentary in the style of the Tosafot. The glosses are sometimes quite detailed and analytic. In many compact Mishnah printings, a condensed version of his commentary, titled &quot;Ikar Tosefot Yom Tov&quot;, is featured.

Other commentaries by early Acharonim:
* &quot;Melechet Shlomo&quot; (Solomon Adeni; early 17th century)
* &quot;Kav veNaki&quot; (Amsterdam 1697) by R. Elisha en Avraham, a brief commentary on the entire Mishnah drawing from &quot;the &quot;Bartenura&quot;&quot;, reprinted 20 times since its publication 
* &quot;Hon Ashir&quot; by Immanuel Hai Ricchi (Amsterdam 1731)
* The Vilna Gaon (&quot;Shenot Eliyahu&quot; on parts of the Mishnah, and glosses &quot;Eliyaho Rabba&quot;, &quot;Chidushei HaGra&quot;, &quot;Meoros HaGra&quot;)

19th century:
* A (the) prominent commentary here is &quot;Tiferet Yisrael&quot; by Rabbi Israel Lipschitz. It is subdivided into two parts, one more general and the other more analytical, titled &quot;Yachin&quot; and &quot;Boaz&quot; respectively (after two large pillars in the Temple in Jerusalem). Although Rabbi Lipschutz has faced some controversy in certain Hasidic circles, he was greatly respected by such sages as Rabbi Akiva Eiger, whom he frequently cites, and is widely accepted in the Yeshiva world. The &quot;Tiferet Yaakov&quot; is an important gloss on the &quot;Tiferet Yisrael&quot;.
*Others from this time include:
** Rabbi Akiva Eiger (glosses, rather than a commentary)
** &quot;Mishnah Rishonah&quot; on &quot;Zeraim&quot; and the &quot;Mishnah Acharonah&quot; on &quot;Tohorot&quot; (Rav Efrayim Yitzchok from Premishla)
** &quot;Sidrei Tohorot&quot; on &quot;Kelim&quot; and &quot;Oholot&quot; (the commentary on the rest of &quot;Tohorot&quot; and on &quot;Eduyot&quot; is lost) by Gershon Henoch Leiner, the Radziner Rebbe
** &quot;Gulot Iliyot&quot; on &quot;Mikvaot&quot;, by Rav Dov Ber Lifshitz 
** &quot;Ahavat Eitan&quot; by Rav Avrohom Abba Krenitz (the great grandfather of Rav Malkiel Kotler)
** &quot;Chazon Ish&quot; on &quot;Zeraim&quot; and &quot;Tohorot&quot;

20th century:
* Hayim Nahman Bialik&#x27;s commentary to Seder Zeraim with vocalization (partially available here) in 1930 was one of the first attempts to create a modern commentary on Mishnah. His decision to use the Vilna text (as opposed to a modern scholarly edition), and to write an introduction to every tractate describing its content and the relevant biblical material, influenced Hanoch Albeck, whose project was considered a continuation and expansion of Bialik&#x27;s. 
* Hanoch Albeck&#x27;s edition (1952–59) (vocalized by Hanoch Yelon), includes Albeck&#x27;s extensive commentary on each Mishnah, as well as introductions to each tractate (Masekhet) and order (Seder). This commentary tends to focus on the meaning of the mishnayot themselves, with less reliance on the Gemara&#x27;s interpretation and is, therefore, considered valuable as a tool for the study of Mishnah as an independent work. Especially important are the scholarly notes in the back of the commentary.
* Symcha Petrushka&#x27;s commentary was written in Yiddish in 1945 (published in Montreal). Its vocalization is supposed to be of high quality.
* The commentary by Rabbi Pinhas Kehati, which uses the Albeck text of the Mishnah, is written in Modern Israeli Hebrew and based on classical and contemporary works, has become popular in the late 20th century. The commentary is designed to make the Mishnah accessible to a wide readership. Each tractate is introduced with an overview of its contents, including historical and legal background material, and each Mishnah is prefaced by a thematic introduction. The current version of this edition is printed with the Bartenura commentary as well as Kehati&#x27;s.
* The encyclopedic editions put out by &quot;Mishnat Rav Aharon&quot; (&quot;Beis Medrosho Govoah&quot;, Lakewood) on &quot;Peah&quot;, &quot;Sheviit&quot;, &quot;Challah&quot;, and &quot;Yadayim&quot;.
* Rabbi Yehuda Leib Ginsburg wrote a commentary on ethical issues, &quot;Musar HaMishnah&quot;. The commentary appears for the entire text except for Tohorot and Kodashim.
* Shmuel Safrai, Chana Safrai and Ze&#x27;ev Safrai have half completed a 45 volume socio-historic commentary &quot;Mishnat Eretz Yisrael&quot;.
* &quot;Mishnah Sdura&quot;, a format specially designed so as to facilitate recital and memorization, published by Rabbi E. Dordek in 1992. The layout is such that an entire chapter and its structure is readily visible, with each Mishnah, in turn, displayed in its component parts using line breaks (click on above image to view); includes tables summarizing each tractate, and the &quot;Kav veNaki&quot; commentary.
*ArtScroll&#x27;s &quot;Elucidated Mishnah&quot;, a phrase-by-phrase translation and elucidation based on the Bertinoro - following the format of the Schottenstein Edition Talmud. Its &quot;Yad Avraham&quot; commentary comprises supplementary explanations and notes, drawing on the Gemara and the other Mishnah commentaries and cross referencing the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; as applicable. The work also includes a general introduction to each tractate. The Modern Hebrew (&quot;Ryzman&quot;) edition includes all these features.

<doc id="19522" wikidata="Q9159" url="?curid=19522" title="Monotheism">
<text>Monotheism is the belief that one God is the only, or at least the dominant deity. A distinction may be made between exclusive monotheism, in which the one God is a singular existence, and both inclusive and pluriform monotheism, in which multiple gods or godly forms are recognized, but each are postulated as extensions of the same God.

Monotheism is distinguished from henotheism, a religious system in which the believer worships one god without denying that others may worship different gods with equal validity, and monolatrism, the recognition of the existence of many gods but with the consistent worship of only one deity. The term &quot;monolatry&quot; was perhaps first used by Julius Wellhausen.

Monotheism characterizes the traditions of Abrahamic religions such as Judaism, Samaritanism, Christianity, Islam, and the early derivatives of these faiths, including Druzism.

Other early monotheistic traditions include Atenism of ancient Egypt, Platonic and Neoplatonic belief in the Monad, Mandaeism, Manichaeism, Waaqeffanna, and Zoroastrianism.

Monotheistic traditions from post-antiquity and the early modern period comprise Deism, Yazidism, and Sikhism, with varying degrees of influence from Abrahamic monotheism. Many new religious movements are monotheistic such as Bábism, the Baháʼí Faith, Seicho-no-Ie, and Tenrikyo.

Narrow monotheism and wide monotheism exist on a spectrum of belief. Narrow monotheism holds that only one exclusive deity exists, disallowing others, while wide monotheism acknowledges one supreme deity and permits lesser deities. Elements of wide monotheistic thought are found in early religions such as 
ancient Chinese religion, Tengrism, and Yahwism.
==Etymology and usage==
The word &quot;monotheism&quot; was coined from the Greek (&quot;monos&quot;) meaning &quot;single&quot; and (&quot;theos&quot;) meaning &quot;god&quot;. The term was coined by Henry More (1614–1687).

Monotheism is a complex and nuanced concept. The biblical authors had various ways of understanding God and the divine, shaped by their historical and cultural contexts. The notion of monotheism that is used today was developed much later, influenced by the Enlightenment and Christian views. Many definitions of monotheism are too modern, western, and Christian-centered to account for the diversity and complexity of the ancient sources, which include not only the biblical texts, but also other writings, inscriptions, and material remains that help reconstruct the ancient beliefs and practices of the people of Judah and Israel.

The term &quot;monotheism&quot; is often contrasted with &quot;polytheism&quot;, but many scholars prefer other terms such as monolatry, henotheism, or one-god discourse.

==History==

Quasi-monotheistic claims of the existence of a universal deity date to the Late Bronze Age, with Akhenaten&#x27;s &quot;Great Hymn to the Aten&quot; from the 14th century BCE.

In the Iron-Age South Asian Vedic period, a possible inclination towards monotheism emerged. The Rigveda exhibits notions of monism of the Brahman, particularly in the comparatively late tenth book, which is dated to the early Iron Age, e.g. in the Nasadiya Sukta. Later, ancient Hindu theology was monist, but was not strictly monotheistic in worship because it still maintained the existence of many gods, who were envisioned as aspects of one supreme God, Brahman.

In China, the orthodox faith system held by most dynasties since at least the Shang dynasty (1766 BCE) until the modern period centered on the worship of &quot;Shangdi&quot; (literally &quot;Above Sovereign&quot;, generally translated as &quot;God&quot;) or Heaven as an omnipotent force. However, this faith system was not truly monotheistic since other lesser gods and spirits, which varied with locality, were also worshipped along with &quot;Shangdi&quot;. Still, later variants such as Mohism (470 BCE–c.391 BCE) approached true monotheism, teaching that the function of lesser gods and ancestral spirits is merely to carry out the will of &quot;Shangdi&quot;, akin to the angels in Abrahamic religions which in turn counts as only one god.

Since the sixth century BCE, Zoroastrians have believed in the supremacy of one God above all: Ahura Mazda as the &quot;Maker of All&quot; and the first being before all others. The prophet Zoroaster is credited with the founding of the first monotheistic religion in history sometime as early as the middle of the second millennium BCE, leaving a lasting influence on other belief systems such as Second Temple Judaism and, through it, on later monotheistic religions. Scholars are conflicted whether Zoroastrianism is best characterized as monotheistic, polytheistic, or henotheistic religion due to the centrality of Ahriman as a component or opposite force of Ahura Mazda.

Post-exilic Judaism, after the late 6th century BCE, was the first religion to conceive the notion of a personal monotheistic God within a monist context. The concept of ethical monotheism, which holds that morality stems from God alone and that its laws are unchanging, first occurred in Judaism, but is now a core tenet of most modern monotheistic religions, including Christianity, Islam, Sikhism, and Baháʼí Faith.

Also from the 6th century BCE, Thales (followed by other Monists, such as Anaximander, Anaximenes, Heraclitus, Parmenides) proposed that nature can be explained by reference to a single unitary principle that pervades everything. Numerous ancient Greek philosophers, including Xenophanes of Colophon and Antisthenes, believed in a similar polytheistic monism that bore some similarities to monotheism. The first known reference to a unitary God is Plato&#x27;s Demiurge (divine Craftsman), followed by Aristotle&#x27;s unmoved mover, both of which would profoundly influence Jewish and Christian theology.

According to contemporary Jewish, Christian and Islamic tradition, monotheism was the original religion of humanity; this original religion is sometimes referred to as &quot;the Adamic religion&quot;, or, in the terms of Andrew Lang, the &quot;Urreligion&quot;. Scholars of religion largely abandoned that view in the 19th and 20th centuries in favour of an evolutionary progression from animism via polytheism to monotheism.

Austrian anthropologist Wilhelm Schmidt had postulated an &quot;Urmonotheismus&quot;, &quot;original&quot; or &quot;primitive monotheism&quot; in the 1910s. It was objected that Judaism, Christianity, and Islam had grown up in opposition to polytheism as had Greek philosophical monotheism. More recently, Karen Armstrong and other authors have returned to the idea of an evolutionary progression beginning with animism, which developed into polytheism, which developed into henotheism, which developed into monolatry, which developed into true monotheism.

==Narrow And Wide Monotheism==
&quot;Narrow monotheism&quot; is a religion that believes in only one deity, disallowing the possibility of there being other deities. &quot;Wide monotheism&quot; is a religion that believes in only one supreme deity, allowing the possibility of there being other lesser deities. A narrow monotheistic religion will often regard other monotheistic religions as worshipping its own specific deity under a different name or form (hence the Abrahamic religions believe they worship the same one God). A wide monotheistic religion will often regard other monotheistic religions as worshipping deities lesser than its own specific deitiy (hence Atenism believes Yahweh to be a lesser deity to Aten). Examples of narrow monotheist religions includes: Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Sikhism, and Baháʼí Faith. Examples of wide monotheism include: Atenism, Native American worship of the Great Spirit, Hinduism, Chiniese religions, Tengrism, Mandaeism, Rastafari, Yazidism, Zoroastrianism, Proto-Indo-European religion, Hellenistic religion, and Andaman Islands religion.

==Regions==
===Africa===
====Eastern Africa====

According to Robin Dunbar, an evolutionary psychologist, the emergence of doctrinal religions is closely linked to environmental and social factors. He argues that large, densely populated societies—often arising in agriculturally productive regions—required more formalized religious structures to maintain social cohesion. In particular, the shift from small, kin-based communities to larger settlements increased the need for moralizing gods and centralized rituals. Additionally, the climatic stability of the Northern Subtropical Zone during the Neolithic facilitated surplus food production, enabling religious specialists to emerge and institutionalize belief systems.

Dunbar identifies two early monotheistic traditions in sub-Saharan Africa. The Cushitic-speaking populations of the central Nile Valley (present-day Sudan) circa 5th millennium BCE worshipped Waaq, a singular sky deity whose veneration persists among some Cushitic groups. Later, Nilotic-speaking societies migrating southward developed or adopted similar beliefs, with singular deities such as Engai of the Maasai, though often combined with ancestral reverence and spirit veneration. Many Southern Nilotic peoples such as the Samburu and Datooga have substantial Cushitic ancestry from the Savanna Pastoral Neolithic communities believed to be of Cushitic origin.

Waaq is the name of a singular God in the traditional religion of many Cushitic people in the Horn of Africa, denoting an early monotheistic religion. However, this religion was mostly replaced with the Abrahamic religions, such as Islam in the case of the Somali. The term &quot;barwaaqo&quot; in the Somali language means prosperity still includes the name of Waaq. The Somali rendition of the Ethiopian prosperity party is &quot;Xisbiga Barwaaqo&quot;. The Somali city of Abudwak means &#x27;worship Waaq&#x27; in Somali. Some Oromo still follow the traditional monotheistic religion called Waaqeffanna in the Oromo language.

Irreechaa is an annual thanksgiving festival celebrated by the Oromo people, primarily in Ethiopia, marking the end of the rainy season and the beginning of the harvest. It is a spiritual occasion dedicated to Waaq, the supreme God in traditional Oromo belief, symbolizing gratitude for nature&#x27;s abundance. The festival is observed in various regions, with its largest celebration taking place in Addis Ababa, where tens of thousands of people gather near bodies of water to offer prayers, songs, and traditional rituals. Irreechaa not only reflects deep-rooted cultural practices but also promotes unity and peace among the Oromo community and beyond.

====Ancient Egypt====
=====Atenism=====
Amenhotep IV initially introduced Atenism in Year 5 of his reign (1348/1346 BCE) during the 18th dynasty of the New Kingdom. He raised Aten, once a relatively obscure Egyptian solar deity representing the disk of the sun, to the status of Supreme God in the Egyptian pantheon. To emphasise the change, Aten&#x27;s name was written in the cartouche form normally reserved for Pharaohs, an innovation of Atenism. This religious reformation appears to coincide with the proclamation of a Sed festival, a sort of royal jubilee intended to reinforce the Pharaoh&#x27;s divine powers of kingship. Traditionally held in the thirtieth year of the Pharaoh&#x27;s reign, this possibly was a festival in honour of Amenhotep III, who some Egyptologists think had a coregency with his son Amenhotep IV of two to twelve years.

Year 5 is believed to mark the beginning of Amenhotep IV&#x27;s construction of a new capital, Akhetaten (&quot;Horizon of the Aten&quot;), at the site known today as Amarna. Evidence of this appears on three of the boundary stelae used to mark the boundaries of this new capital. At this time, Amenhotep IV officially changed his name to Akhenaten (&quot;Agreeable to Aten&quot;) as evidence of his new worship. The date given for the event has been estimated to fall around January 2 of that year. In Year 7 of his reign (1346/1344 BCE), the capital was moved from Thebes to Akhetaten (near modern Amarna), though construction of the city seems to have continued for two more years. In shifting his court from the traditional ceremonial centres Akhenaten was signalling a dramatic transformation in the focus of religious and political power.

The move separated the Pharaoh and his court from the influence of the priesthood and from the traditional centres of worship, but his decree had deeper religious significance too—taken in conjunction with his name change, it is possible that the move to Amarna was also meant as a signal of Akhenaten&#x27;s symbolic death and rebirth. It may also have coincided with the death of his father and the end of the coregency. In addition to constructing a new capital in honor of Aten, Akhenaten also oversaw the construction of some of the most massive temple complexes in ancient Egypt, including one at Karnak and one at Thebes, close to the old temple of Amun.

In Year 9 (1344/1342 BCE), Akhenaten declared a more radical version of his new religion, declaring Aten not merely the supreme god of the Egyptian pantheon, but the only God of Egypt, with himself as the sole intermediary between the Aten and the Egyptian people. Key features of Atenism included a ban on idols and other images of the Aten, with the exception of a rayed solar disc, in which the rays (commonly depicted ending in hands) appear to represent the unseen spirit of Aten. Akhenaten made it however clear that the image of the Aten only represented the god, but that the god transcended creation and so could not be fully understood or represented. Aten was addressed by Akhenaten in prayers, such as the &quot;Great Hymn to the Aten&quot;: &quot;O Sole God beside whom there is none&quot;.

The details of Atenist theology are still unclear. The exclusion of all but one god and the prohibition of idols was a radical departure from Egyptian tradition, but scholars see Akhenaten as a practitioner of monolatry rather than monotheism, as he did not actively deny the existence of other gods; he simply refrained from worshiping any but Aten. Akhenaten associated Aten with Ra and put forward the eminence of Aten as the renewal of the kingship of Ra.

Under Akhenaten&#x27;s successors, Egypt reverted to its traditional religion, and Akhenaten himself came to be reviled as a heretic.

===== Other monotheistic traditions =====
Some Egyptian ethical text authors believed in only a single god ruling over the universe.

===Americas===
====Native American religion====
Native American religions may be monotheistic, polytheistic, henotheistic, animistic, or some combination thereof. Cherokee religion, for example, is monotheist as well as pantheist.

The Great Spirit, called &quot;Wakan Tanka&quot; among the Sioux, and &quot;Gitche Manitou&quot; in Algonquian, is a conception of universal spiritual force, or supreme being prevalent among some Native American and First Nation cultures. According to Lakota activist Russell Means a better translation of &quot;Wakan Tanka&quot; is the Great Mystery. Indeed, &quot;Wanka Tanka&quot; among the Lakota was considered a &quot;council of gods&quot; in pre-Columbian times, and their religion is not monotheistic.

Some researchers have interpreted Aztec philosophy as fundamentally monotheistic or panentheistic. While the populace at large believed in a polytheistic pantheon, Aztec priests and nobles might have come to an interpretation of Teotl as a single universal force with many facets. There has been criticism to this idea, however, most notably that many assertions of this supposed monotheism might actually come from post-Conquistador bias, imposing an Antiquity pagan model onto the Aztec.

=====Hinduism=====

As an old religion, Hinduism inherits religious concepts spanning monotheism, polytheism, panentheism, pantheism, monism, and atheism among others; and its concept of God is complex and depends upon each individual and the tradition and philosophy followed.

Hindu views are broad and range from monism, through pantheism and panentheism (alternatively called monistic theism by some scholars) to monotheism and even atheism. Hinduism cannot be said to be purely polytheistic. Hindu religious leaders have repeatedly stressed that while God&#x27;s forms are many and the ways to communicate with him are many, God is one. The &quot;puja&quot; of the &quot;murti&quot; is a way to communicate with the abstract one god (&quot;Brahman&quot;) which creates, sustains and dissolves creation.

Rig Veda 1.164.46,
:&quot;
:&quot;They call him Indra, Mitra, Varuṇa, Agni, and he is heavenly nobly-winged Garuda.
:To what is One, sages give many a title they call it Agni, Yama, Mātariśvan.&quot; (trans. Griffith)

Traditions of Gaudiya Vaishnavas, the Nimbarka Sampradaya and followers of Swaminarayan and Vallabha consider Krishna to be the source of all avatars, and the source of Vishnu himself, or to be the same as Narayana. As such, he is therefore regarded as &quot;Svayam Bhagavan&quot;.

When Krishna is recognized to be &quot;Svayam Bhagavan&quot;, it can be understood that this is the belief of Gaudiya Vaishnavism, the Vallabha Sampradaya, and the Nimbarka Sampradaya, where Krishna is accepted to be the source of all other avatars, and the source of Vishnu himself. This belief is drawn primarily &quot;from the famous statement of the Bhagavatam&quot; (1.3.28). A viewpoint differing from this theological concept is the concept of Krishna as an &quot;avatar&quot; of Narayana or Vishnu. It should be however noted that although it is usual to speak of Vishnu as the source of the avataras, this is only one of the names of the God of Vaishnavism, who is also known as Narayana, Vasudeva and Krishna and behind each of those names there is a divine figure with attributed supremacy in Vaishnavism.

The Rig Veda discusses monotheistic thought, as do the Atharva Veda and Yajur Veda:
&quot;Devas are always looking to the supreme abode of Vishnu&quot; (&quot;tad viṣṇoḥ paramaṁ padaṁ sadā paśyanti sṻrayaḥ&quot; Rig Veda 1.22.20)

&quot;The One Truth, sages know by many names&quot; (Rig Veda 1.164.46)

&quot;When at first the unborn sprung into being, He won His own dominion beyond which nothing higher has been in existence&quot; (Atharva Veda 10.7.31)

&quot;There is none to compare with Him. There is no parallel to Him, whose glory, verily, is great.&quot; (Yajur Veda 32.3)

The number of auspicious qualities of God are countless, with the following six qualities (&quot;bhaga&quot;) being the most important:
* &quot;Jñāna&quot; (omniscience), defined as the power to know about all beings simultaneously
* &quot;Aishvarya&quot; (sovereignty, derived from the word Ishvara), which consists in unchallenged rule over all
* &quot;Shakti&quot; (energy), or power, which is the capacity to make the impossible possible
* &quot;Bala&quot; (strength), which is the capacity to support everything by will and without any fatigue
* &quot;Vīrya&quot; (vigor), which indicates the power to retain immateriality as the supreme being in spite of being the material cause of mutable creations
* &quot;Tejas&quot; (splendor), which expresses His self-sufficiency and the capacity to overpower everything by His spiritual effulgence

In the Shaivite tradition, the &quot;Shri Rudram&quot; (Sanskrit श्रि रुद्रम्), to which the Chamakam (चमकम्) is added by scriptural tradition, is a Hindu &quot;stotra&quot; dedicated to Rudra (an epithet of Shiva), taken from the Yajurveda (TS 4.5, 4.7). Shri Rudram is also known as &quot;Sri Rudraprasna&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Rudradhyaya&quot;. The text is important in Vedanta where Shiva is equated to the Universal supreme God. The hymn is an early example of enumerating the names of a deity, a tradition developed extensively in the sahasranama literature of Hinduism.

The Nyaya school of Hinduism has made several arguments regarding a monotheistic view. The Naiyanikas have given an argument that such a god can only be one. In the &quot;Nyaya Kusumanjali&quot;, this is discussed against the proposition of the &quot;Mimamsa&quot; school that let us assume there were many demigods (&quot;devas&quot;) and sages (&quot;rishis&quot;) in the beginning, who wrote the Vedas and created the world. Nyaya says that:

In other words, Nyaya says that the polytheist would have to give elaborate proofs for the existence and origin of his several celestial spirits, none of which would be logical, and that it is more logical to assume one eternal, omniscient god.

Many other Hindus, however, view polytheism as far preferable to monotheism. The famous Hindu revitalist leader Ram Swarup, for example, points to the Vedas as being specifically polytheistic, and states that, &quot;only some form of polytheism alone can do justice to this variety and richness.&quot;

Sita Ram Goel, another 20th-century Hindu historian, wrote:

=====Sikhism=====
Sikhi is a monotheistic and a revealed religion. God in Sikhism is called Akal Purakh (which means &quot;The Immortal Being&quot;) or &quot;Vāhigurū&quot; (Wondrous Enlightener). However, other names like Rama, Brahman, Khuda, Allah, etc. are also used to refer to the same God, who is shapeless, timeless, and sightless: &quot;niraṅkār&quot;, &quot;akaal&quot;, and &quot;alakh&quot;. Sikhi presents a unique perspective where God is present (&quot;sarav viāpak&quot;) in all of its creation and does not exist outside of its creation. God must be seen from &quot;the inward eye&quot;, or the &quot;heart&quot;. Sikhs follow the Aad Guru Granth Sahib and are instructed to meditate on the Naam (Name of God - &quot;Vāhigurū&quot;) to progress towards enlightenment, as its rigorous application permits the existence of communication between God and human beings.

Sikhism is a monotheistic faith that arose in the Punjab region of the Indian subcontinent during the 16th and 17th centuries. Sikhs believe in one, timeless, omnipresent, supreme creator. The opening verse of the Guru Granth Sahib, known as the Mul Mantra, signifies this:
:Transliteration: ikk ōankār sat(i)-nām(u) karatā purakh(u) nirabha&#x27;u niravair(u) akāla mūrat(i) ajūnī saibhan gur(a) prasād(i).
:One Universal creator God, The supreme Unchangeable Truth, The Creator of the Universe, Beyond Fear, Beyond Hatred, Beyond Death, Beyond Birth, Self-Existent, by Guru&#x27;s Grace.
The word &quot;ੴ&quot; (&quot;Ik ōaṅkār&quot;) has two components. The first is ੧, the digit &quot;1&quot; in Gurmukhi signifying the singularity of the creator. Together the word means: &quot;One Universal creator God&quot;.

It is often said that the 1430 pages of the Guru Granth Sahib are all expansions on the Mul Mantra. Although the Sikhs have many names for God, some derived from Islam and Hinduism, they all refer to the same Supreme Being.

The Sikh holy scriptures refer to the One God who pervades the whole of space and is the creator of all beings in the universe. The following quotation from the Guru Granth Sahib highlights this point:

However, there is a strong case for arguing that the Guru Granth Sahib teaches monism due to its non-dualistic tendencies:

Sikhs believe that God has been given many names, but they all refer to the One God, VāhiGurū. Sikh holy scripture (Guru Granth Sahib) speaks to all faiths and Sikhs believe that members of other religions such as Islam, Hinduism and Christianity all worship the same God, and the names Allah, Rahim, Karim, Hari, Raam and Paarbrahm are, therefore, frequently mentioned in the Sikh holy scripture (Guru Granth Sahib) . God in Sikhism is most commonly referred to as Akal Purakh (which means &quot;The Immortal Being&quot;) or Waheguru, the Wondrous Enlightener.

====East Asia====
=====Chinese religion=====
The orthodox faith system held by most dynasties of China since at least the Shang dynasty (1766 BCE) until the modern period centered on the worship of &quot;Shangdi&quot; (literally &quot;Above Sovereign&quot;, generally translated as &quot;High-god&quot;) or Heaven as a supreme being, standing above other gods. This faith system pre-dated the development of Confucianism and Taoism and the introduction of Buddhism and Christianity. It has some features of monotheism in that Heaven is seen as an omnipotent entity, a noncorporeal force with a personality transcending the world. However, this faith system was not truly monotheistic since other lesser gods and spirits, which varied with locality, were also worshiped along with &quot;Shangdi&quot;. Still, later variants such as Mohism (470 BCE–c.391 BCE) approached true monotheism, teaching that the function of lesser gods and ancestral spirits is merely to carry out the will of &quot;Shangdi.&quot; In Mozi&#x27;s &quot;Will of Heaven&quot; (天志), he writes:

Worship of &quot;Shangdi&quot; and Heaven in ancient China includes the erection of shrines, the last and greatest being the Temple of Heaven in Beijing, and the offering of prayers. The ruler of China in every Chinese dynasty would perform annual sacrificial rituals to &quot;Shangdi&quot;, usually by slaughtering a completely healthy bull as sacrifice. Although its popularity gradually diminished after the advent of Taoism and Buddhism, among other religions, its concepts remained in use throughout the pre-modern period and have been incorporated in later religions in China, including terminology used by early Christians in China. Despite the rising of non-theistic and pantheistic spirituality contributed by Taoism and Buddhism, Shangdi was still praised up until the end of the Qing dynasty as the last ruler of the Qing declared himself son of heaven.

In the 19th century in the Guangdong region, monotheist influences led to the Taiping Rebellion.

=====Tengrism=====

Tengrism or Tangrism (sometimes stylized as Tengriism), occasionally referred to as Tengrianism, is a modern term for a Central Asian religion characterized by features of shamanism, animism, totemism, both polytheism and monotheism, and ancestor worship. Historically, it was the prevailing religion of the Bulgars, Turks, Mongols, and Hungarians, as well as the Xiongnu and the Huns. It was the state religion of the six ancient Turkic states: Avar Khaganate, Old Great Bulgaria, First Bulgarian Empire, Göktürks Khaganate, Eastern Tourkia and Western Turkic Khaganate. In &quot;Irk Bitig&quot;, Tengri is mentioned as &quot;Türük Tängrisi&quot; (God of Turks). The term is perceived among Turkic peoples as a &quot;national&quot; religion.

In Chinese and Turco-Mongol traditions, the Supreme God is commonly referred to as the ruler of Heaven, or the Sky Lord granted with omnipotent powers, but it has largely diminished in those regions due to ancestor worship, Taoism&#x27;s pantheistic views and Buddhism&#x27;s rejection of a creator God. On some occasions in the mythology, the Sky Lord as identified as a male has been associated to mate with an Earth Mother, while some traditions kept the omnipotence of the Sky Lord unshared.

=====Abrahamic religions=====

======Baháʼí Faith======
God in the Baháʼí Faith is taught to be the Imperishable, uncreated Being Who is the source of existence, too great for humans to fully comprehend. Human primitive understanding of God is achieved through his revelations via his divine intermediary Manifestations. In the Baháʼí faith, such Christian doctrines as the Trinity are seen as compromising the Baháʼí view that God is single and has no equal,
and the very existence of the Baháʼí Faith is a challenge to the Islamic doctrine of the finality of Muhammad&#x27;s revelation.

God in the Baháʼí Faith communicates to humanity through divine intermediaries, known as Manifestations of God. These Manifestations establish religion in the world. It is through these divine intermediaries that humans can approach God, and through them God brings divine revelation and law.

The Oneness of God is one of the core teachings of the Baháʼí Faith. The obligatory prayers in the Baháʼí Faith involve explicit monotheistic testimony. God is the imperishable, uncreated being who is the source of all existence. He is described as &quot;a personal God, unknowable, inaccessible, the source of all Revelation, eternal, omniscient, omnipresent and almighty&quot;. Although transcendent and inaccessible directly, his image is reflected in his creation. The purpose of creation is for the created to have the capacity to know and love its creator. God communicates his will and purpose to humanity through intermediaries, known as Manifestations of God, who are the prophets and messengers that have founded religions from prehistoric times up to the present day.

======Christianity======
Among early Christians, there was considerable debate over the nature of the Godhead, with some denying the incarnation but not the deity of Jesus (Docetism) and others later calling for an Arian conception of God. Despite at least one earlier local synod rejecting the claim of Arius, this Christological issue was to be one of the items addressed at the First Council of Nicaea.

The First Council of Nicaea, held in Nicaea (in present-day Turkey), convoked by the Roman Emperor Constantine I in 325, was the first ecumenical council of bishops of the Roman Empire, and most significantly resulted in the first uniform Christian doctrine, called the Nicene Creed. With the creation of the creed, a precedent was established for subsequent general ecumenical councils of bishops (synods) to create statements of belief and canons of doctrinal orthodoxy—the intent being to define a common creed for the Church and address heretical ideas.

One purpose of the council was to resolve disagreements in Alexandria over the nature of Jesus in relationship to the Father; in particular, whether Jesus was of the same substance as God the Father or merely of similar substance. All but two bishops took the first position; while Arius&#x27; argument failed.

Christian orthodox traditions (Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and most Protestants) follow this decision, which was reaffirmed in 381 at the First Council of Constantinople and reached its full development through the work of the Cappadocian Fathers. They consider God to be a triune entity, called the Trinity, comprising three &quot;persons&quot;, God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. These three are described as being &quot;of the same substance&quot; ().

Christians overwhelmingly assert that monotheism is central to the Christian faith, as the Nicene Creed (and others), which gives the orthodox Christian definition of the Trinity, begins: &quot;I believe in one God&quot;. From earlier than the times of the Nicene Creed, 325 CE, various Christian figures advocated the triune mystery-nature of God as a normative profession of faith. According to Roger E. Olson and Christopher Hall, through prayer, meditation, study and practice, the Christian community concluded &quot;that God must exist as both a unity and trinity&quot;, codifying this in ecumenical council at the end of the 4th century.

Most modern Christians believe the Godhead is triune, meaning that the three persons of the Trinity are in one union in which each person is also wholly God. They also hold to the doctrine of a man-god Christ Jesus as God incarnate. These Christians also do not believe that one of the three divine figures is God alone and the other two are not but that all three are mysteriously God and one. Other Christian religions, including Unitarian Universalism, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, Mormonism and others, do not share those views on the Trinity.

Some Christian faiths, such as Mormonism, argue that the Godhead is in fact three separate individuals which include God the Father, His Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost, each individual having a distinct purpose in the grand existence of human kind. Furthermore, Mormons believe that before the Council of Nicaea, the predominant belief among many early Christians was that the Godhead was three separate individuals. In support of this view, they cite early Christian examples of belief in subordinationism.

Unitarianism is a theological movement, named for its understanding of God as one person, in direct contrast to Trinitarianism.

Some in Judaism and some in Islam do not consider Trinitarian Christianity to be a pure form of monotheism due to the pluriform monotheistic Christian doctrine of the Trinity, classifying it as &quot;shituf&quot; in Judaism and as &quot;shirk&quot; in Islam. Trinitarian Christians, on the other hand, argue that the doctrine of the Trinity is a valid expression of monotheism, citing that the Trinity does not consist of three separate deities, but rather the three persons, who exist consubstantially (as one substance) within a single Godhead.

======Islam======
In Islam, God (Allāh) is all-powerful and all-knowing, the Creator, Sustainer, Ordainer and Judge of the universe. God in Islam is strictly singular (&quot;tawhid&quot;) unique (&quot;wahid&quot;) and inherently One (&quot;ahad&quot;), all-merciful and omnipotent. Allāh exists on the &quot;Al-&#x27;Arsh&quot; , but the Quran states that &quot;No vision can encompass Him, but He encompasses all vision. For He is the Most Subtle, All-Aware.&quot; () Allāh is the only God and the same God worshiped in Christianity and Judaism(Q).

Islam emerged in the 7th century CE in the context of both Christianity and Judaism, with some thematic elements similar to Gnosticism. Islamic belief states that Muhammad did not bring a new religion from God, but rather the same religion as practiced by Abraham, Moses, David, Jesus and all the other prophets of God. The assertion of Islam is that the message of God had been corrupted, distorted or lost over time, and the Quran was sent to Muhammad in order to correct the lost message of the Tawrat (Torah), Injil (Gospel) and Zabur.

The Quran asserts the existence of a single and absolute truth that transcends the world; a unique and indivisible being who is independent of the creation. The Quran rejects binary modes of thinking such as the idea of a duality of God by arguing that both good and evil generate from God&#x27;s creative act. God is a universal god rather than a local, tribal or parochial one; an absolute who integrates all affirmative values and brooks no evil. Ash&#x27;ari theology, which dominated Sunni Islam from the tenth to the nineteenth century, insists on ultimate divine transcendence and holds that divine unity is not accessible to human reason. Ash&#x27;arism teaches that human knowledge regarding it is limited to what has been revealed through the prophets, and on such paradoxes as God&#x27;s creation of evil, revelation had to accept &quot;bila kayfa&quot; (without [asking] how).

&quot;Tawhid&quot; constitutes the foremost article of the Muslim profession of faith, &quot;There is no god but God, Muhammad is the messenger of God. To attribute divinity to a created entity is the only unpardonable sin mentioned in the Quran. The entirety of the Islamic teaching rests on the principle of &quot;tawhid&quot;.

Medieval Islamic philosopher Al-Ghazali offered a proof of monotheism from omnipotence, asserting there can only be one omnipotent being. For if there were two omnipotent beings, the first would either have power over the second (meaning the second is not omnipotent) or not (meaning the first is not omnipotent); thus implying that there could only be one omnipotent being.

As they traditionally profess a concept of monotheism with a singular entity as God, Judaism and Islam reject the Christian idea of monotheism. Judaism uses the term Shituf to refer to non-monotheistic ways of worshiping God. Although Muslims venerate Jesus (Isa in Arabic) as a prophet and messiah, they do not accept the doctrine that he was a begotten son of God.

======Judaism======
Judaism is traditionally considered one of the oldest monotheistic religions in the world, although up to the 8th century BCE the Israelites were polytheistic, with their worship including the gods El, Baal, Asherah, and Astarte. Yahweh was originally the national god of the Kingdom of Israel and the Kingdom of Judah. During the 8th century BCE, the worship of Yahweh in Israel was in competition with many other cults, described by the Yahwist faction collectively as Baals. The oldest books of the Hebrew Bible reflect this competition, as in the books of Hosea and Nahum, whose authors lament the &quot;apostasy&quot; of the people of Israel, threatening them with the wrath of God if they do not give up their polytheistic cults.

As time progressed, the henotheistic cult of Yahweh grew increasingly militant in its opposition to the worship of other gods. Some scholars date the start of widespread monotheism to the late 8th century BCE, and view it as a response to Neo-Assyrian aggression. Later, the reforms of King Josiah imposed a form of strict monolatrism. After the fall of Judah and the beginning of the Babylonian captivity, a small circle of priests and scribes gathered around the exiled royal court, where they first developed the concept of Yahweh as the sole God of the world.

Second Temple Judaism and later Rabbinic Judaism became strictly monotheistic. The Babylonian Talmud references other, &quot;foreign gods&quot; as non-existent entities to whom humans mistakenly ascribe reality and power. One of the best-known statements of Rabbinic Judaism on monotheism is the Second of Maimonides&#x27; 13 Principles of faith:

Some in Judaism and Islam reject the Christian idea of monotheism. Modern Judaism uses the term &quot;shituf&quot; to refer to the worship of God in a manner which Judaism deems to be neither purely monotheistic (though still permissible for non-Jews) nor polytheistic (which would be prohibited).

======Mandaeism======
Mandaeism or Mandaeanism ( &quot;&quot;), sometimes also known as Sabianism, is a monotheistic, Gnostic, and ethnic religion. Mandaeans consider Adam, Seth, Noah, Shem and John the Baptist to be prophets, with Adam being the founder of the religion and John being the greatest and final prophet. The Mandaeans believe in one God commonly named Hayyi Rabbi meaning &#x27;The Great Life&#x27; or &#x27;The Great Living God&#x27;. The Mandaeans speak a dialect of Eastern Aramaic known as Mandaic. The name &#x27;Mandaean&#x27; comes from the Aramaic &quot;manda&quot; meaning &quot;knowledge&quot;, as does Greek &quot;gnosis&quot;. The term &#x27;Sabianism&#x27; is derived from the Sabians (, ), a mysterious religious group mentioned three times in the Quran alongside the Jews, the Christians and the Zoroastrians as a &#x27;people of the book&#x27;, and whose name was historically claimed by the Mandaeans as well as by several other religious groups in order to gain the legal protection () offered by Islamic law. Mandaeans recognize God to be the eternal, creator of all, the one and only in domination who has no partner.

======Rastafari======
Rastafari, sometimes termed Rastafarianism, is classified as both a new religious movement and social movement. It developed in Jamaica during the 1930s. It lacks any centralised authority and there is much heterogeneity among practitioners, who are known as Rastafari, Rastafarians, or Rastas.

Rastafari refer to their beliefs, which are based on a specific interpretation of the Bible, as &quot;Rastalogy&quot;. Central is a monotheistic belief in a single God—referred to as Jah—who partially resides within each individual. The former emperor of Ethiopia, Haile Selassie, is given central importance. Many Rastas regard him as an incarnation of Jah on Earth and as the Second Coming of Christ. Others regard him as a human prophet who fully recognised the inner divinity within every individual.

=====Yazidism=====
God in Yazidism created the world and entrusted it into the care of seven Holy Beings, known as Angels. The Yazidis believe in a divine Triad. The original, hidden God of the Yazidis is considered to be remote and inactive in relation to his creation, except to contain and bind it together within his essence. His first emanation is the Angel Melek Taûs (), who functions as the ruler of the world and leader of the other Angels. The second hypostasis of the divine Triad is the Sheikh &#x27;Adī ibn Musafir. The third is Sultan Ezid. These are the three hypostases of the one God. The identity of these three is sometimes blurred, with Sheikh &#x27;Adī considered to be a manifestation of Tawûsê Melek and vice versa; the same also applies to Sultan Ezid. Yazidis are called &quot;&quot; (&quot;the nation of Tawûsê Melek&quot;).

God is referred to by Yazidis as &#x27;, , &#x27;, and &#x27; (&#x27;King&#x27;), and, less commonly, &#x27; and &quot;&quot;. According to some Yazidi hymns (known as &quot;Qewls&quot;), God has 1,001 names, or 3,003 names according to other Qewls.

=====Zoroastrianism=====

By some scholars, the Zoroastrians (&quot;Parsis&quot; or &quot;Zartoshtis&quot;) are sometimes credited with being some of the first monotheists and having had influence on other world religions. 
Zoroastrianism combines cosmogonic dualism and eschatological monotheism which makes it unique among the religions of the world. There are two issues that have long made it problematic to identify Zoroastrianism as true monotheism: the presence of lesser deities and dualism. But before hastening to conclude that the Amesha Spentas and the other yazatas compromise the purity of monotheism, we should consider that the other historical monotheisms too made room for other figures endowed with supernatural powers to bridge the gulf between the exalted, remote Creator God and the human world: the angels in all of them (whose conception in post-exilic Judaism was apparently developed after the pattern of the Amesha Spentas; Boyce and Grenet, 1991, 404–405), the saints and the Virgin Mary in several Christian churches, and the other persons of the Trinity in all of Christianity. Despite the vast differences with Zoroastrian theology, the common thread is that all these beings are subordinate to the Godhead as helpers or (in the case of the persons of the Trinity) co-equals, hence they do not pursue different interests and are worshiped jointly with the Godhead, not separately; therefore the supplicant&#x27;s dilemma does not arise.

===Europe===
====Ancient proto-Indo-European religion====

The head deity of the Proto-Indo-European religion was the god *&quot;Dyḗus Pḥatḗr &quot;. A number of words derived from the name of this prominent deity are used in various Indo-European languages to denote a monotheistic God. Nonetheless, in spite of this, Proto-Indo-European religion itself was not monotheistic.

In Eastern Europe, the ancient traditions of the Slavic religion contained elements of monotheism. In the sixth century AD, the Byzantine chronicler Procopius recorded that the Slavs &quot;acknowledge that one god, creator of lightning, is the only lord of all: to him do they sacrifice an ox and all sacrificial animals.&quot; The deity to whom Procopius is referring is the storm god Perún, whose name is derived from *&quot;Perkwunos&quot;, the Proto-Indo-European god of lightning. The ancient Slavs syncretized him with the Germanic god Thor and the Biblical prophet Elijah.

====Ancient Greek religion====
=====Classical Greece=====

The surviving fragments of the poems of the classical Greek philosopher Xenophanes of Colophon suggest that he held views very similar to those of modern monotheists. His poems harshly criticize the traditional notion of anthropomorphic gods, commenting that &quot;...if cattle and horses and lions had hands or could paint with their hands and create works such as men do... [they] also would depict the gods&#x27; shapes and make their bodies of such a sort as the form they themselves have.&quot; Instead, Xenophanes declares that there is &quot;...one god, greatest among gods and humans, like mortals neither in form nor in thought.&quot; Xenophanes&#x27;s theology appears to have been monist, but not truly monotheistic in the strictest sense. Although some later philosophers, such as Antisthenes, believed in doctrines similar to those expounded by Xenophanes, his ideas do not appear to have become widely popular.

Although Plato himself was a polytheist, in his writings, he often presents Socrates as speaking of &quot;the god&quot; in the singular form. He does, however, often speak of the gods in the plural form as well. The Euthyphro dilemma, for example, is formulated as &quot;Is that which is holy loved by the gods because it is holy, or is it holy because it is loved by the gods?&quot;

=====Hellenistic religion=====

The development of pure (philosophical) monotheism is a product of the Late Antiquity. During the 2nd to 3rd centuries, early Christianity was just one of several competing religious movements advocating monotheism.

&quot;The One&quot; () is a concept that is prominent in the writings of the Neoplatonists, especially those of the philosopher Plotinus. In the writings of Plotinus, &quot;The One&quot; is described as an inconceivable, transcendent, all-embodying, permanent, eternal, causative entity that permeates throughout all of existence.
A number of oracles of Apollo from Didyma and Clarus, the so-called &quot;theological oracles&quot;, dated to the 2nd and 3rd century CE, proclaim that there is only one highest god, of whom the gods of polytheistic religions are mere manifestations or servants. 4th century CE Cyprus had, besides Christianity, an apparently monotheistic cult of Dionysus.

The Hypsistarians were a religious group who believed in a most high god, according to Greek documents. Later revisions of this Hellenic religion were adjusted towards monotheism as it gained consideration among a wider populace. The worship of Zeus as the head-god signaled a trend in the direction of monotheism, with less honour paid to the fragmented powers of the lesser gods.

===Oceania===
====Aboriginal Australian religion====
Aboriginal Australians are typically described as polytheistic in nature. Although some researchers shy from referring to Dreamtime figures as &quot;gods&quot; or &quot;deities&quot;, they are broadly described as such for the sake of simplicity.

In Southeastern Australian cultures, the sky father Baiame is perceived as the creator of the universe (though this role is sometimes taken by other gods like Yhi or Bunjil) and at least among the Gamilaraay traditionally revered above other mythical figures. Equation between him and the Christian god is common among both missionaries and modern Christian Aboriginals.

The Yolngu had extensive contact with the Makassans and adopted religious practises inspired by those of Islam. The god Walitha&#x27;walitha is based on Allah (specifically, with the &quot;wa-Ta&#x27;ala&quot; suffix), but while this deity had a role in funerary practises it is unclear if it was &quot;Allah-like&quot; in terms of functions.

====Andaman Islands====
The religion of the Andamanese peoples has at times been described as &quot;animistic monotheism&quot;, believing foremost in a single deity, Pūluga, who created the universe. However, Pūluga is not worshipped, and anthropomorphic personifications of natural phenomena are also known.

==Criticism==
Critics have described monotheism as a cause of ignorance, oppression, and violence.

David Hume (1711–1776) said that monotheism is less pluralistic and thus less tolerant than polytheism, because monotheism stipulates that people pigeonhole their beliefs into one tenet. In the same vein, Auguste Comte said that &quot;Monotheism is irreconcilable with the existence in our nature of the instincts of benevolence&quot; because it compels followers to devote themselves to a single Creator. Mark S. Smith, an American biblical scholar and ancient historian, wrote that monotheism has been a &quot;totalizing discourse&quot;, often co-opting all aspects of a social belief system, resulting in the exclusion of &quot;others&quot;. Jacob Neusner suggests that &quot;the logic of monotheism ... yields little basis for tolerating other religions&quot;.

Ancient monotheism is described as the instigator of violence in its early days because it inspired the Israelites to wage war upon the Canaanites who believed in multiple gods. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan regarded monotheism as a cause of violence, saying: &quot;The intolerance of narrow monotheism is written in letters of blood across the history of man from the time when first the tribes of Israel burst into the land of Canaan. The worshippers of the one jealous God are egged on to aggressive wars against people of alien [beliefs and cultures]. They invoke divine sanction for the cruelties inflicted on the conquered. The spirit of old Israel is inherited by Christianity and Islam, and it might not be unreasonable to suggest that it would have been better for Western civilization if Greece had moulded it on this question rather than Palestine.&quot;

<text>Muay Thai or Muaythai (, , ), sometimes referred to as Thai boxing, the Art of Eight Limbs or the Science of Eight Limbs, is a Thai martial art and full-contact combat sport that uses stand-up striking, sweeps, and various clinching techniques. The name “Art of Eight Limbs” refers to the combined use of fists, elbows, knees and shins. Muay Thai became widespread internationally in the late 20th to 21st century, when Westernised practitioners from Thailand began competing in kickboxing and mixed-rules matches as well as matches under Muay Thai rules around the world. The professional league is governed by the Professional Boxing Association of Thailand (PAT), sanctioned by the Sports Authority of Thailand (SAT).

Muay Thai is related to other martial art styles of the Indian cultural sphere such as Musti-yuddha, Muay Chaiya, Muay Boran, Muay Lao, Lethwei, Benjang and Tomoi. A practitioner of Muay Thai is known as a &quot;Nak Muay&quot;. Western practitioners in Thailand are sometimes called &quot;Nak Muay Farang&quot;, meaning &quot;foreign boxer&quot;.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;Muay Thai&quot; is a thai word. The word &quot;Muay&quot; derived from Sanskrit word, &quot;mavyati&quot; () meaning &quot;to pull together&quot;, the word &quot;Thai&quot; comes from the word &quot;Tai&quot;, meaning &quot;Tai-Kadai speakers&quot;. The term &quot;Muay Thai&quot; is successor of the term &quot;Ram Mut Ram Muay&quot; () since the reign of King Rama II (1809–24), and has thus entered into the global vocabulary.

The oldest text of term &quot;Muay&quot; ever recorded, found in the palm-leaf manuscripts in Northern Thai language called &quot;Mungrai Law 1839 BE&quot;, enacted 1296 AD. And the pronunciation of the word &quot;Muay&quot; existed in Thai people since prior Nanzhao period (738–902 AD) said in &quot;The History of Muay Thai&quot; by The Institute of the Art of Muay Thai, Department of Physical Education National Stadium of Thailand (DPE).

The historical term &quot;Tha Nai Lueak&quot; (, ), meaning &quot;Nak Muay for the King&#x27;s guard, the name of division to be in charge of Nak Muay.&quot; The term was adopted in &quot;the Law of the Military and Provincial Hierarchy 1998 BE&quot; since 1455 AD reign of King Borommatrailokkanat and repealed in 1851–68 AD reign of King Mongkut.

== King&#x27;s speech ==
On October 29, 1970. King Bhumibol Adulyadej gave his speech to the Muay Thai Fund Raising Organizing Committee in support of Thai boxers on behalf of the Anandamahidol Foundation states:

== History ==
===7th century===
The earliest origin of Muay Thai dates back to the 657 AD Haripuñjaya period of a hermit named &quot;Sukatanata&quot; who established his school of liberal and martial arts consisting of Muay Thai, which will be mentioned in order of history compiled officially by The Institute of the Art of Muay Thai, Department of Physical Education National Stadium of Thailand (DPE).

From 738 AD in the Nanzhao period. Muay Thai had been trained from variant movements of dance; &quot;Fon jerng&quot; or &quot;jerng&quot; means &quot;tactics&quot; or &quot;finesse&quot;, () included weapons and bare hands, showing the art of men&#x27;s fighting, which is similar to Lei tai due to the war engagement with China for a long time. It is said to be the earliest stage of Thai people forming, and Muay Thai had been training for generations along the &quot;Fon jerng&quot; dance. The &quot;Fon jerng&quot; also became one of the recreational Thai classical dances in Northern Thailand, existing nowadays.

=== 10th century ===
After the Northern Tai people, led by King Lavachakkaraj, who ruled the town of Fang () (now Uttaradit province, Thailand), founded the Singhanavati Kingdom, known as Yonoknakhon (757–1188), they continued to expand their territory by seizing and establishing kingdoms, such as the Lan Na Kingdom, Phayao Kingdom, Haripuñjaya, and Lampang.

From 947 AD onward, they conquered various ethnic groups, including the Khom ethnic groups, aboriginal Siamese (known as Siam-asli, Saimi-mandala, Siamese Lavo, Xiān, or Siam at that time), and Mon-Khmer in the upper part of the Chao Phraya River basin, using their martial arts skills (Muay). The Tai people then moved down northwest and successfully established the Sukhothai Kingdom (1238–1438) under the rule of King Si Inthrathit, who was a descendant of King Phrom, a descendant of the Singhanavati Dynasty (King Lavachakkaraj). This is mentioned in the folklore, &quot;the Legend of Singhanavati&quot;.

The &quot;Mungrai Customary Law 1296 CE&quot; (Mungraiyashastra), one of the oldest palm-leaf manuscripts written in the Northern Thai language during the reign of King Mangrai, who established the town of Chiang Mai (1292–1311), also mentioned the Tai martial arts (Muay) in section 7, under the article of 18 types of quarrels, for the first time in the Lan Na Kingdom. In the folklore, &quot;the Legend of the Phayao Kingdom&quot; (1094–1338), the version by Wat Sriboonrueng mentioned the Tai martial arts (Muay) known as &quot;jerng tiw khui&quot; during the reign of King Chueang Maharat (1115–1162).

=== 13th century ===
During the Pre-Ayutthaya era (Ayodhya period) before 1351, the &quot;Royal Chronicle of the North&quot; documented King Uthong&#x27;s importation of Muay boxers from the city of Sri Phalo (now Chonburi province, Thailand) to the city-state of Ayodhya. This occurred during his reign from 1253 to 1289, and a Muay boxing match between a Siamese boxer and a Chinese boxer also took place during the late reign of King Suwanracha, who ruled Ayodhya from 1301 to 1310. Furthermore, the Siam-Thai of Ayutthaya (known as Gywan and Siam-Asli) launched an attack on the Thaton kingdom in 1056 CE. They expanded their territory southward and used their martial arts skills (Muay) to penetrate deep into the Malay Peninsula before 1160 CE. These events are recorded in various historical sources, including the Burmese chronicle, &quot;Hmannan Yazawin&quot;, the &quot;Malay annals&quot; (Sulalatus Salatin), and the &quot;History of the Malay Kingdom of Patani&quot; (Sejarah Kerajaan Melayu Patani).

During the Sukhothai Kingdom from 1238 to 68, Muay Thai was highly regarded as an art form and was even included in the curriculum for members of the royal family. It was seen as a way to train brave warriors with exceptional physical fitness, as well as prepare them for leadership and warfare against neighboring kingdoms. King Si Inthrathit sent his second son, aged 13, Prince Ram Khamhaeng, to study Dharma, liberal arts, and martial arts (Muay) at the Samo Khon School in Lawapura town (now Lopburi province, Thailand), Lavo Kingdom. It was here that Prince Ram Khamhaeng formed a close bond with Prince Ngam Mueang, who would later become the King of Phayao Kingdom in 1258, as mentioned in the &quot;Yonok Chronicles&quot;:

The Samo Khon school was founded in 657 AD during the Haripuñjaya period by a hermit named Sukatanata (). He taught a variety of subjects, collectively known as &quot;Maiya Shastra&quot; (ಮೈಶಾಸ್ತ್ರ), which included martial arts (Muay), sword fighting, archery, and elephant and horse control. One of the most notable alumni of the school was King Mangrai. The Hermitage of Sukatanata still exists today and can be accessed at Wat Khao Samo Khon in Lopburi province, Thailand.

King Ram Khamhaeng also composed a war strategy manual during his reign that also mentioned Muay Thai. Later, King Maha Thammaracha I was trained in essential subjects as well as practical skills, including martial arts (Muay) for self-defense with bare hands and the use of weapons. Muay Thai was also taught at temples, which served as learning centers for the Tai peoples, following the guidelines of King Ram Khamhaeng&#x27;s war strategy manual.

===15th century===
In 1431 AD, King Borommarachathirat II, the King of Ayutthaya Kingdom, led Siamese forces and included groups of Siamese boxers to assault the Khmers plundering Angkor Thom, also known as the Fall of Angkor in 1431. King Borommarachathirat II built an inscription of Khun Sri Chaiya Raj Mongkol Thep for the victory monument and Siamese warriors&#x27; commemoration, which inscribed a list of Siamese warriors and assault record in the inscription after the Angkor had already been captured, as well as written in &quot;A Lost Chronicle of Ayutthaya&quot; by Michael Vickery, stanzas 9–11.

The inscription of Khun Sri Chaiya Raj Mongkol Thep (N.M. 78, Face 2) 1431 AD reads:

From 1455 AD in the Ayutthaya period, Muay Thai was officially integrated with Siamese royal courts of Ayutthaya called The King&#x27;s Guard Department () since the reign of King Borommatrailokkanat enacted the Law of the Military and Provincial Hierarchy 1998 BE (1455 AD), which consisted of two director generals with noble titles, Khun Phakdeeasa () and Khun Yothaphakdee () in the hierarchy. There were countless skilled Siamese boxers in The King&#x27;s Unarmed Guard Division (), a sub-division of The King&#x27;s Guard Department, picked from competition by the king to be his private guards and patrol the royal palace as major missions. The boxing competitions occur in peace situations as well as to safeguard the king at war.

There was also the law mentioned of Muay in the reign of King Ekathotsarot (1590–1605), called Miscellaneous Laws (Phra Aiyakan Betset), which states:

The well-known Siamese boxers during the Ayutthaya period include King Naresuan, King Suriyenthrathibodi, and Nai Khanom Tom.

===16th century===

According to history, Muay Thai have been developed by the Siamese army as a form of self-defense and to date back at least to the 13th century, according to King Ram Khamhaeng&#x27;s war strategics manual. In Ayutthaya Kingdom, the war strategics manual was recomposed in 1518 by King Ramathibodi II called &quot;Tamra Phichaisongkram&quot; ().

King Naresuan practiced martial arts and rearranged his soldiers for 15 years at peacetime. He had learned warrior fighting techniques from Burmese royal courts after he was raised on his age 9 by King Bayinnaung for 6 years in Burma after the invasion by Bayinnaung&#x27;s army to Ayutthaya Kingdom in the Burmese–Siamese War (1563–1564). King Naresuan also improved the war strategics manual version of King Ramathibodi II to the version of King Naresuan after he was backed to Ayutthaya Kingdom to be capable of self-defense in war engagements during his reign.

In 1687, Simon de la Loubère, a French diplomat to Siam of King Louis XIV, handwrote that Muay Thai was one of the occupations of Siamese people in his famous book, &quot;Du Royaume de Siam&quot;, during the reign of King Narai, which reads:

In 1698, according to the second French mission to Siam by King Louis XIV, who after appointed Guy Tachard to be in charge of the French ambassador to Siam. Muay Thai was being trained to prepare for an engagement with a French expeditionary force after the Dutch captain informed the Siamese Royal Court of the news about French battleships to siege Puducherry and Myeik seaports of the Kingdom of Ayutthaya in the reign of King Phetracha after the Siamese revolution of 1688.

&quot;Monsieur Braud&#x27;s letter to Directors of the International Affairs Kingdom of Ayutthaya (June 9, 1699)&quot; reads:

===18th century===
In the 1702 reign of King Suriyenthrathibodi. The king questioned his vassals about the Siamese people festival held outside the boundary of Ayutthaya Royal Palace. The government official responded to the king that the temple fair will be held at Khwaeng Wiset Chai Chan (now Ang Thong province, Thailand). Tomorrow, there are Buddhist monastery celebrations, grand competitions, and amusements. King Suriyenthrathibodi then responded back that he had not punched Muay boxing for a long time since enthroned, and he decided to join Muay boxing competitions tomorrow.

On the next festival day, King Suriyenthrathibodi disguised himself as the general public with a few royal police and went to the festival by boat to join the Muay boxing competitions, and he won both the first and second matches during the competition, as the &quot;Royal Chronicle of the Kingdom of Ayutthaya&quot; reads:

In 1767, after the second fall of Ayutthaya Kingdom from the Burmese–Siamese War (1765–1767), the invading Burmese troops rounded up thousands of Siamese citizens. They then organized a seven-day, seven-night religious festival in honor of Buddha&#x27;s relics. The festivities included many forms of entertainment, such as costume plays, comedies, and sword-fighting matches. King Hsinbyushin wanted to see how Thai fighters would compare to his fighters. Nai Khanom Tom was selected to fight against the King&#x27;s chosen champion, and the boxing ring was set up in front of the throne. When the fight began, Nai Khanom Tom charged out, using punches, kicks, elbows, and knees to pummel his opponent until he collapsed. The King supposedly asked if Nai Khanom Tom would fight nine other Burmese champions to prove himself. He agreed and fought one after the other with no rest periods. His last opponent was a great kickboxing teacher from Rakhine State whom Nai Khanom Tom defeated with kicks.

King Hsinbyushin was so impressed that he allegedly remarked in &quot;The Royal Chronicle of the Kingdom of Ayutthaya&quot; reads:

To commemorate the story of Nai Khanom Tom, the Muay Thai Festival and Wai Khru Muay Thai Ceremony are staged annually every year on March 17.

This historiography was largely extrapolated from brief mentions in written records, including four episodes in the royal chronicles of the 18th century: one where King Sanphet VIII fought an incognito match at a temple fair, Khwaeng Mueang Wiset Chai Chan in 1702; one where Nai Khanom Tom, as a war captive following the fall of Ayutthaya, fought in front of the Burmese king and defeated ten Burmese fighters; one of the military commander Phraya Phichai Dap Hak, who in his youth was a Muay Thai fighter; and one of Muen Phlan, who was chosen by King Rama I to fight against two French challengers in 1788.

The &quot;Royal Chronicle of the Kingdom of Rattanakosin: First Reign&quot;, documents the arrival of two French boxing brothers in Bangkok in 1788. They had come to compete in a boxing match for a monetary prize. Seeking to compete with a Siamese boxer, they enlisted the help of an interpreter to convey their request to a Siamese nobleman, Chaophraya Phra Khlang (Hon). This nobleman then brought the matter to the attention of King Rama I. The King, in turn, consulted with his younger brother, Prince Maha Sura Singhanat of the Front Palace, and made a plea:

Since the foreigners have made a challenge, it would be considered an insult if we did not come up with Thai boxers to compete against them. It would be said that no Thais in all the capital could fight. Our reputation would suffer. The dishonor would spread abroad. I beg you to find a Thai boxer skillful enough to inflict a resounding defeat.

King Rama I accepted his brother&#x27;s advice and asked a nobleman to inform the Frenchmen that a match would be arranged with a purse of fifty Chang (equivalent to 4,000 baht at the time). Prince Maha Sura Singhanat personally supervised the construction of a suitable arena and prepared the Siamese boxer.

On the day of the boxing competition, King Rama I, his younger brother, and many members of the Siamese royal court were present as spectators near the western theater of Wat Phra Kaew. Prince Maha Sura Singhanat arranged for a Siamese boxer from the Front Palace King&#x27;s Guard Department named Muean Phlan to compete against the younger of the French brothers. During the match, Muean Phlan constantly evaded his opponent, making it difficult for the younger French brother to get a hold of him. As the elder French brother rushed to assist his younger sibling, Prince Maha Sura Singhanat also joined the fight and knocked the elder brother down. All the umpires rushed to help the Siamese boxer, and the Frenchmen were treated harshly. After Rama I had the two French brothers receive physical therapy, they soon departed.

===19th century===
The ascension of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) to the throne in 1868 ushered in a golden age not only for Muay but for the whole country of Thailand. Muay progressed greatly during the reign of Rama V as a direct result of the king&#x27;s personal interest in the sport. The country was at peace and Muay functioned as a means of physical exercise, self-defense, attacking, recreation and personal advancement.

To increase interest in Muay Thai, King Chulalongkorn implemented nationwide tournaments and established a Royal Boxing Center, known as Muay Luang or Royal Boxers, similar to the Muay Fighters Regiment during the Ayutthaya Period, to administer the training of both Muay Thai and Krabi–krabong. He also bestowed the title of Muen, a Thai nobility rank, to the victor of each match. In 1887, the Department of Education (now the Department of Physical Education, Ministry of Tourism and Sports (Thailand)) was established by King Chulalongkorn, with Muay Thai being included as a subject in the national curriculum for both physical education teacher training schools and the Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy (CRMA).

In 1910, the King requested &quot;muay&quot; fighters from outlying provinces to fight matches at the funeral of his son Prince Urubongse Rajasombhoj, and granted the noble rank of &quot;Muen&quot; to the three best fighters, who were from Lopburi, Khorat and Chaiya. These would later become codified as regional styles of Muay Boran.

===The modern era===
Modern Muay Thai arose from the local form of bare-hand fighting historically known simply as &quot;muay&quot;, and became recognized as a distinct martial art form in the early 20th century, when the term &quot;Muay Thai&quot; (&#x27;Siamese boxing&#x27; in English) was introduced in physical education curricular documents to distinguish it from international boxing (&quot;muay sakon&quot; in Thai).

The officially recognized history of Muay Thai was largely codified in the late 20th century, when the sport gained widespread popularity and became recognized as a national sport and cultural heritage. The term Muay Boran was coined to describe the pre-modern historical martial art form of Muay Thai, and they came to symbolize a warrior spirit seen as a core component of Thainess.

1913: British boxing was introduced into the curriculum of the Suan Kulap College. The first descriptive use of the term &quot;Muay Thai&quot;.

From 1914 to 1918 during World War I, Thailand sent troops to fight with its allies in France. They taught people there Muay Thai, and later Thai boxing spread to others and became known internationally, so the word of &quot;Muay Thai&quot; had reached Europe by this time. A French magazine, &quot;Le Sport Orient&quot;, published in Mainz, observed:
Thai boxing is astounding but hard to get to see. The boxers are agile, strong, and tough. This sport is not just a thrilling, strange, and extraordinary form of entertainment. Once again, it makes the French feel that Siam is one of the truly remarkable nations of Asia.

1919: British boxing and Muay Thai were taught as one sport in the curriculum of the Suan Kulap College. Judo was also offered.

1921: First permanent ring in Siam at Suan Kulap College. Used for both muay and British boxing.

1923: Suan Sanuk Stadium. First international style three-rope ring with red and blue padded corners, near Lumpinee Park. Muay and British boxing.

King Rama VII (r. 1925–1935) pushed for codified rules for Muay and they were put into place. Thailand&#x27;s first boxing ring was built in 1921 at Suan Kulap. Referees were introduced and rounds were now timed by kick. Fighters at the Lumpinee Boxing Stadium began wearing modern gloves, as well as hard groin protectors, during training and in boxing matches against foreigners. Traditional rope-binding (&quot;Khat Chueak&quot;) made the hands a hardened, dangerous striking tool. The use of knots in the rope over the knuckles made the strikes more abrasive and damaging for the opponent while protecting the hands of the fighter. This rope-binding was still used in fights between Thais but after a death in the ring, it was decided that fighters should wear gloves and cotton coverlets over the feet and ankles. It was also around this time that the term &quot;Muay Thai&quot; became commonly used, while the older form of the style came to be known as &quot;Muay Boran&quot;, which is now performed primarily as an exhibition art form.

Muay Thai was at the height of its popularity in the 1980s and 1990s. Top fighters commanded purses of up to 200,000 Baht and the stadia where gambling was legal drew big gates and big advertising revenues. In 2016, a payout to a superstar fighter was about 100,000 Baht per fight, but can range as high as 540,000 Baht for a bout.

In 1993, the International Federation of Muay Thai Amateur, or IFMA was inaugurated. It became the governing body of amateur Muay Thai consisting of 128 member countries worldwide and is recognised by the Olympic Council of Asia.

In 1995, the World Muaythai Council, the oldest and largest professional sanctioning organisations of muay Thai, was established by the Thai government and sanctioned by the Sports Authority of Thailand.

In 1995, the World Muay Thai Federation was founded by the merger of two existing organisations, and established in Bangkok, becoming the federation governing international Muay Thai. In August 2012, it had over 70 member countries. Its president is elected at the World Muay Thai Congress.

In 2006, Muay Thai was included in SportAccord with IFMA. One of the requirements of SportAccord was that no sport can have a name of a country in its name. As a result, an amendment was made in the IFMA constitution to change the name of the sport from &quot;Muay Thai&quot; to &quot;Muaythai&quot; – written as one word in accordance with Olympic requirements.

In 2014, Muay Thai was included in the International World Games Association (IWGA) and was represented in the official programme of The World Games 2017 in Wrocław, Poland.

In January 2015, Muay Thai was granted the patronage of the International University Sports Federation (FISU) and, from 16 to 23 March 2015, the first University World Muaythai Cup was held in Bangkok.

In 2020, there are more than 3,800 Thai boxing gyms overseas.

===Rules===
According to IFMA rules, Muay Thai is a full contact martial art that uses the fists, elbows, knees and feet to strike an opponent. For a strike to count as a point score, it has to connect without being blocked by your opponent. Strikes do not score if they connect with your opponent&#x27;s glove, forearm, shin or foot. Strikes to the groin were allowed in Muay Thai boxing until the late 1980s, and are still permitted in Thailand itself, and in club or competition events that abide to the traditional rules. While competitors do wear groin protection, such as cups, the rules for club level sparring and competition events may vary regarding the protective gear that may or may not be worn. Mixed-sex fights are not practiced at international level, but do occur in club and inter-club sparring and competition events. If the fight goes the distance and both fighters finish with the same score, then the winner is determined by which fighter landed the most full contact blows.

==Traditional wear==
The &quot;mongkhon&quot;, or &quot;mongkol&quot; (headband), and &quot;pra jiad&quot; (armbands) are often worn into the ring before the match begins. They originated when Siam was in a constant state of war. Young men would tear off pieces of a loved one&#x27;s clothing (often a mother&#x27;s &quot;sarong&quot;) and wear it in battle for good luck as well as to ward off harmful spirits. In modern times, the &quot;mongkol&quot; (lit. &quot;holy spirit&quot;, &quot;luck&quot;, &quot;protection&quot;) is worn as a tribute to the fighter&#x27;s gym. The &quot;mongkol&quot; is traditionally presented by a trainer to the fighter when he judges that the fighter is ready to represent the gym in the ring. Often, after the fighter has finished the &quot;wai kru&quot;, the trainer will take the &quot;mongkol&quot; off his head and place it in his corner of the ring for luck. They were also used for protection. Whether the fighter is a Buddhist or not, it is common for them to bring the &quot;mongkol&quot; to a Buddhist monk who blesses it for good luck prior to stepping into the ring.

==Techniques==
Formal Muay Thai techniques are divided into two groups: &quot;mae mai&quot; (แม่ไม้), or &quot;major techniques&quot;, and &quot;luk mai&quot; (ลูกไม้), or &quot;minor techniques&quot;. Muay Thai is often a fighting art of attrition, where opponents exchange blows with one another. This is certainly the case with traditional stylists in Thailand, but is a less popular form of fighting in the contemporary world fighting circuit where the Thai style of exchanging blow for blow is no longer favorable. Almost all techniques in Muay Thai use the entire body movement, rotating the hip with each kick, punch, elbow and block.

===Punching (&quot;Muay Mat&quot;)===


The punch techniques in Muay Thai were originally quite limited, being crosses and a long (or lazy) circular strike made with a straight (but not locked) arm and landing with the heel of the palm. Cross-fertilisation with Western boxing and Western martial arts mean the full range of western boxing punches are now used: lead jab, straight/cross, hook, uppercut, shovel and corkscrew punches and overhands, as well as hammer fists and back fists.

As a tactic, body punching is used less in Muay Thai than most other striking combat sports to avoid exposing the attacker&#x27;s head to counter strikes from knees or elbows. To utilize the range of targeting points, in keeping with the centre line theory, the fighter can use either the Western or Thai stance which allows for either long range or short range attacks to be undertaken effectively without compromising guard.

===Elbow (&quot;sok&quot;)===
The elbow can be used in several ways as a striking weapon: horizontal, diagonal-upwards, diagonal-downwards, uppercut, downward, backward-spinning, and flying. From the side, it can be used as either a finishing move or as a way to cut the opponent&#x27;s eyebrow so that blood might block his vision. The diagonal elbows are faster than the other forms but are less powerful. The elbow strike is considered the most dangerous form of attack in the sport.

There is a distinct difference between a single elbow and a follow-up elbow. The single elbow is a move independent from any other, whereas a follow-up elbow is the second strike from the same arm, being a hook or straight punch first with an elbow follow-up. Such elbows, and most other elbow strikes, are used when the distance between fighters becomes too small and there is too little space to throw a hook at the opponent&#x27;s head.

Elbows can be used to great effect as blocks or defences against, for example, spring knees, side body knees, body kicks or punches. When well connected, an elbow strike can cause serious damage to the opponent, including cuts or even a knockout.

===Kicking (&quot;te&quot;)===

The two most common kicks in Muay Thai are known as the &quot;thip&quot; (literally &quot;foot jab&quot;) and the &quot;te chiang&quot; (kicking upwards in the shape of a triangle cutting under the arm and ribs), or roundhouse kick. The Thai roundhouse kick uses a rotational movement of the entire body and has been widely adopted by practitioners of other combat sports. It is done from a circular stance with the back leg just a little ways back (roughly shoulder width apart) in comparison to instinctive upper body fighting (boxing) where the legs must create a wider base. The roundhouse kick draws its power almost entirely from the rotational movement of the hips, counter-rotation of the shoulders and arms are also often used to add torque to the lower body and increase the power of the kick as well.

If a roundhouse kick is attempted by the opponent, the Thai boxer will normally check the kick, that is, he will block the kick with the outside of his lower leg. Thai boxers are trained to always connect with the shin. The foot contains many fine bones and is much weaker. A fighter may end up hurting himself if he tries to strike with his foot or instep. Shins are trained by repeatedly striking firm objects, such as pads or heavy bags.

=== Knee (&quot;ti khao&quot;) ===
Source:

*&quot;Khao dot&quot; (Jumping knee strike) – the boxer jumps up on one leg and strikes with that leg&#x27;s knee.
*&quot;Khao loi&quot; (flying knee strike) – the boxer takes a step(s), jumps forward and off one leg and strikes with that leg&#x27;s knee.
*&quot;Khao thon&quot; (Straight knee strike) – the boxer simply thrusts it forward but not upwards, unless he is holding an opponent&#x27;s head down in a clinch and intend to knee upwards into the face. According to one written source, this technique is somewhat more recent than &quot;khao dot&quot; or &quot;khao loi&quot;. Supposedly, when the Thai boxers fought with rope-bound hands rather than the modern boxing gloves, this particular technique was subject to potentially vicious cutting, slicing and sawing by an alert opponent who would block it or deflect it with the sharp &quot;rope-glove&quot; edges which are sometimes dipped in water to make the rope much stronger. This explanation also holds true for some of the following knee strikes below as well.

===Foot-thrust (&quot;teep&quot;)===
The foot-thrust, or literally, &quot;foot jab&quot;, is one of the techniques in Muay Thai. It is mainly used as a defensive technique to control distance or block attacks. Foot-thrusts should be thrown quickly but with enough force to knock an opponent off balance.
===Clinch and neck wrestling (&quot;chap kho&quot;)===

In Western boxing, the two fighters are separated when they clinch; in muay Thai, however, they are not. It is often in the clinch that knee and elbow techniques are used. To strike and bind the opponent for both offensive and defensive purposes, small amounts of stand-up grappling are used in the clinch. The front clinch should be performed with the palm of one hand on the back of the other. There are three reasons why the fingers must not be intertwined. 1) In the ring fighters are wearing boxing gloves and cannot intertwine their fingers. 2) The Thai front clinch involves pressing the head of the opponent downwards, which is easier if the hands are locked behind the back of the head instead of behind the neck. Furthermore, the arms should be putting as much pressure on the neck as possible. 3) A fighter may incur an injury to one or more fingers if they are intertwined, and it becomes more difficult to release the grip in order to quickly elbow the opponent&#x27;s head.

A correct clinch also involves the fighter&#x27;s forearms pressing against the opponent&#x27;s collar bone while the hands are around the opponent&#x27;s head rather than the opponent&#x27;s neck. The general way to get out of a clinch is to push the opponent&#x27;s head backward or elbow them, as the clinch requires both participants to be very close to one another. Additionally, the non-dominant clincher can try to &quot;swim&quot; their arm underneath and inside the opponent&#x27;s clinch, establishing the previously non-dominant clincher as the dominant clincher.

Muay Thai has several other variants of the clinch or &quot;chap kho&quot; , including:
*Arm clinch: One or both hands controls the inside of the defender&#x27;s arm(s) and where the second hand if free is in the front clinch position. This clinch is used to briefly control the opponent before applying a knee strike or throw.
*Side clinch: One arm passes around the front of the defender with the attacker&#x27;s shoulder pressed into the defender&#x27;s arm pit and the other arm passing round the back which allows the attacker to apply knee strikes to the defender&#x27;s back or to throw the defender readily.
*Low clinch: Both controlling arms pass under the defender&#x27;s arms, which is generally used by the shorter of two opponents.
*Swan-neck: One hand around the rear of the neck is used to briefly clinch an opponent before a strike.
===Defence against attacks===
Defences in muay Thai are categorised in six groups:

*Blocking – defender&#x27;s hard blocks to stop a strike in its path so preventing it reaching its target (e.g. the shin block described in more detail below)
* Parry/block – Parrying or blocking uses the kickboxer&#x27;s hands as defensive tools to deflect incoming attacks. As the opponent&#x27;s punch arrives, the boxer delivers a sharp, lateral, open-handed blow to the opponent&#x27;s wrist or forearm, redirecting the punch.
*Avoidance – moving a body part out of the way or range of a strike so the defender remains in range for a counter-strike. For example, the defender moves their front leg backward to avoid the attacker&#x27;s low kick, then immediately counters with a roundhouse kick. Or the defender might lay their head back from the attacker&#x27;s high roundhouse kick then counter-attack with a side kick.
*Evasion – moving the body out of the way or range of a strike so the defender has to move close again to counter-attack, e.g. defender jumping laterally or back from attacker&#x27;s kicks
*Disruption – Pre-empting an attack e.g. with defender using disruptive techniques like jab, foot-thrust or low roundhouse kick, generally called a &quot;leg kick&quot; (to the outside or inside of the attacker&#x27;s front leg, just above the knee) as the attacker attempts to close distance
*Anticipation – Defender catching a strike (e.g., catching a roundhouse kick to the body) or countering it before it lands (e.g., defender&#x27;s low kick to the supporting leg below as the attacker initiates a high roundhouse kick).

====Defences in practice====
Defensively, the concept of &quot;wall of defence&quot; is used, in which shoulders, arms and legs are used to hinder the attacker from successfully executing techniques. Blocking is a critical element in muay Thai and compounds the level of conditioning a successful practitioner must possess. Low and mid body roundhouse kicks are normally blocked with the upper portion of a raised shin (this block is known as a &quot;check&quot;). High body strikes are blocked ideally with the forearms and shoulder together, or if enough time is allowed for a parry, the glove (elusively), elbow, or shin will be used. Midsection roundhouse kicks can also be caught/trapped, allowing for a sweep or counter-attack to the remaining leg of the opponent. Punches are blocked with an ordinary boxing guard and techniques similar, if not identical, to basic boxing technique. A common means of blocking a punch is using the hand on the same side as the oncoming punch. For example, if an orthodox fighter throws a jab (being the left hand), the defender will make a slight tap to redirect the punch&#x27;s angle with the right hand. The deflection is always as small and precise as possible to avoid unnecessary energy expenditure and return the hand to the guard as quickly as possible. Hooks are often blocked with a motion sometimes described as &quot;combing the hair&quot;, that is, raising the elbow forward and effectively shielding the head with the forearm, flexed biceps and shoulder. More advanced muay Thai blocks are usually in the form of counter-strikes, using the opponent&#x27;s weight (as they strike) to amplify the damage that the countering opponent can deliver. This requires impeccable timing and thus can generally only be learned by many repetitions.

==Child boxers==
In 2016, 9,998 children under the age of 15 were registered with Board of Boxing under the Sport Authority of Thailand, according to the Child Safety Promotion and Injury Prevention Research Centre (CSIP). Some estimates put the number of child boxers nationwide at between 200,000 and 300,000, some as young as four years old.

The Advanced Diagnostic Imaging Centre (AIMC) at Ramathibodi Hospital studied 300 child boxers aged under 15 with two to more than five years of experience, as well as 200 children who do not box. The findings show that child boxers not only sustain brain injuries, they also have a lower IQ, about 10 points lower than average levels. Moreover, IQ levels correlate with the length of their training. Beyond brain damage, the death of young fighters in the ring sometimes occurs.

Adisak Plitapolkarnpim, director of CSIP, was indirectly quoted (in 2016) as having said that muay Thai practitioners &quot;younger than 15 years old are being urged to avoid &#x27;head contact&#x27; to reduce the risk of brain injuries, while children aged under nine should be banned from the combat fight&quot;; furthermore, the Boxing Act&#x27;s minimum age to compete professionally was largely being flouted; furthermore, quoted indirectly, &quot;Boxers aged between 13 and 15&quot; should still be permitted to compete, but &quot;with light contact to the head and face&quot;. He said that &quot;spectators and a change in the boxing rules can play a vital role in preventing child boxers from suffering brain injuries, abnormality in brain structure, Parkinson&#x27;s disease and early-onset Alzheimer&#x27;s later in life...Children aged between nine and 15 can take part in [Thai] boxing, but direct head contact must not be allowed&quot;. Referring to &quot;Findings [of 2014] on the Worst Forms of Child Labour&quot; as published by the US Department of Labor&#x27;s Bureau of International Labor Affairs, he said, &quot;We know Muay Thai paid fighters have been exploited in the past like child labourers and the matter still remains a serious concern.&quot;

At the 13th World Conference on Injury Prevention and Safety Promotion in 2018, it was revealed that up to three percent of the upcoming generation will grow up with learning disabilities unless an amendment is ratified that bans children under 12 from participating in boxing matches. International pediatricians have called on lawmakers in Thailand to help.

==Injuries==
Muay Thai is a combat sport that utilises eight different parts of the body (fists, elbows, knees and shins) so injuries are quite common in all levels of muay Thai. An injury is considered reportable if it requires the athlete to rest for more than one day. Many injuries in the sport go unreported as the fighters may not notice the injuries at first, refuse to admit that they need treatment, have a heightened pain threshold, fear that their instructor will perceive the injury negatively, or have confusion as to what is an injury. Similar to most sports, injury rates tend to be higher in beginners than amateurs and professionals. Soft tissue injuries are the most common form of injury in muay Thai, comprising between 80 and 90% of all injuries. These injuries are caused by repeated trauma to soft parts of the body. During matches there is little to no padding, leaving soft tissue vulnerable to strikes. The second most common injuries among beginners and amateurs are sprains and strains. It appears that these injuries can be easily avoided or reduced. Many participants of a study admitted to inadequate warm up before the event of the injury. The third most common injuries are fractures. Fractures are more commonly seen with amateur and professional fighters, because they are allowed full contact, while beginners are not. The most common sites for fractures are the nose, carpal bones, metacarpals, digits and ribs. The distribution of injuries differs significantly for beginners, amateurs and professionals, because as a fighter progresses through the different levels, the forces involved grow progressively higher, less padding and protective equipment is used, and athletes are likely to train harder, resulting in more serious injuries among experienced fighters.

== Gambling ==
According to a &quot;Bangkok Post&quot; columnist, &quot;...Thai professional boxing is all about gambling and big money. Gambling on muay Thai boxing is estimated to worth about 40 billion baht a year...all the talk about the promotion of Thai martial arts is just baloney.&quot; Rob Cox, the manager of a boxing camp just east of Bangkok claims that &quot;Without the gamblers, the sport would pretty much be dead. They&#x27;re killing it off, but they&#x27;re also keeping it alive&quot;.

The practice of fixing fights is not unknown. Boxers can earn from 60,000 to 150,000 baht for purposefully losing a fight. A fighter, later arrested, who threw a fight at Rajadamnern Stadium in December 2019, is an example. An infamous alleged case of match-fixing was the bout on 12 October 2014 in Pattaya between top Thai boxer Buakaw Banchamek and his challenger, Enriko Kehl, at the K-1 World Max Final event.

==Conditioning==
Like most full contact fighting sports, muay Thai has a heavy focus on body conditioning. This can create a steep learning curve for newcomers to muay Thai but allows for rapid increases in fitness and stamina provided one avoids overtraining. Training regimens include many staples of combat sport conditioning such as running, shadowboxing, rope jumping, body weight resistance exercises, medicine ball exercises, abdominal exercises and, in some cases, weight training. Thai boxers rely heavily on kicks utilising the shin bone. As such, practitioners will repeatedly hit a dense heavy bag with their shins, conditioning it, hardening the bone through a process called cortical remodelling. Striking a sand-filled bag will have the same effect.

Training specific to a Thai fighter includes training with coaches on Thai pads, focus mitts, heavy bag, and sparring. Daily training includes many rounds (3–5 minute periods broken up by a short rest, often 1–2 minutes) of these various methods of practice. Thai pad training is a cornerstone of muay Thai conditioning that involves practicing punches, kicks, knees, and elbow strikes with a trainer wearing thick pads covering the forearms and hands. These special pads (often referred to as Thai pads) are used to absorb the impact of the fighter&#x27;s strikes and allow the fighter to react to the attacks of the pad holder in a live situation. The trainer will often also wear a belly pad around the abdominal area so that the fighter can attack with straight kicks or knees to the body at any time during the round.

Focus mitts are specific to training a fighter&#x27;s hand speed, punch combinations, timing, punching power, defence and counter-punching and may also be used to practice elbow strikes. Heavy bag training is a conditioning and power exercise that reinforces the techniques practiced on the pads. Sparring is a means to test technique, skills, range, strategy and timing against a partner. Sparring is often a light to medium contact exercise because competitive fighters on a full schedule are not advised to risk injury by sparring hard. Specific tactics and strategies can be trained with sparring including in close fighting, clinching and kneeing only, cutting off the ring, or using reach and distance to keep an aggressive fighter away.

Due to the rigorous training regimen (some Thai boxers fight almost every other week), professional boxers in Thailand have relatively short careers in the ring. Many retire from competition to begin instructing the next generation of Thai fighters. Most professional Thai boxers come from lower economic backgrounds, and the purse (after other parties have their cut) is sought as a means of support for the fighters and their families. Very few higher economic strata Thais join the professional muay Thai ranks; they usually either do not practice the sport or practice it only as amateur boxers.

== Perspectives ==
Scholars have described this royalist-nationalist history as an invented tradition, constructed to serve the needs of Thai nationalism at the time. This tradition has caused Muay Thai to become strongly attached to the official Thai cultural institution and separated from other similar and closely related martial arts in the region, including &quot;muay Lao&quot; in Laos, and &quot;lethwei&quot; in Myanmar.

<doc id="19527" wikidata="Q5816" url="?curid=19527" title="Mao Zedong">
<text>Mao Zedong (26 December 1893 – 9 September 1976), also known as Chairman Mao, was a Chinese politician, revolutionary, and political theorist who founded the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) and led the country from its establishment in 1949 until his death in 1976. Mao served as the chairman of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) from 1943 until his death, and as the party&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; leader from 1935. His theories, which he advocated as a Chinese adaptation of Marxism–Leninism, are known as Mao Zedong Thought.

Born to a peasant family in Shaoshan, Hunan, Mao was influenced early in his life by the events of the 1911 Revolution and May Fourth Movement of 1919, supporting Chinese nationalism and anti-imperialism. He adopted Marxism–Leninism while working as a librarian at Peking University, and in 1921 became a founding member of the Chinese Communist Party. After the start of the Chinese Civil War between the Kuomintang (KMT) and CCP in 1927, Mao led the failed Autumn Harvest Uprising and founded the Jiangxi Soviet. He helped establish the Chinese Red Army and developed a strategy of guerilla warfare. In 1935, Mao became leader of the CCP during the Long March. The CCP allied with the KMT in the Second United Front during the Second Sino-Japanese War starting in 1937, but China&#x27;s civil war resumed after Japan&#x27;s surrender in 1945. Mao&#x27;s forces defeated the Nationalist government, which withdrew to Taiwan in 1949.

On 1 October 1949, Mao proclaimed the foundation of the PRC, a one-party state controlled by the CCP. He initiated land redistribution and industrialisation campaigns, suppressed political opponents, intervened in the Korean War, and began the ideological Hundred Flowers and Anti-Rightist Campaigns. In 1958, Mao launched the Great Leap Forward, which aimed to transform China&#x27;s economy from agrarian to industrial; it resulted in the Great Chinese Famine. In 1966, he initiated the Cultural Revolution, a campaign to remove &quot;counter-revolutionary&quot; elements marked by violent class struggle, destruction of historical artifacts, and Mao&#x27;s cult of personality. From the late 1950s, Mao&#x27;s foreign policy was dominated by a political split with the Soviet Union, and during the 1970s he began establishing relations with the United States; China was also involved in the Vietnam War and Cambodian Civil War. In 1976, Mao died after suffering a series of heart attacks. He was succeeded as leader by Hua Guofeng, and in 1978 by Deng Xiaoping. The CCP&#x27;s official evaluation of Mao&#x27;s legacy both praises him and acknowledges he made errors in his later years.

Mao is considered one of the most significant figures of the 20th century. His policies were responsible for a vast number of deaths, with estimates ranging from 40 to 80 million victims of starvation, persecution, prison labour, and mass executions, and his regime has been described as totalitarian. He has also been credited with transforming China from a semi-colony to a leading world power by advancing literacy, women&#x27;s rights, basic healthcare, primary education, and life expectancy. Under Mao, China&#x27;s population grew from about 550 million to more than 900 million. Within China, he is revered as a national hero who liberated the country from foreign occupation and exploitation. He became an ideological figurehead and a prominent influence within the international communist movement, inspiring various Maoist organisations.

== English romanisation of name ==
During Mao&#x27;s lifetime, the English-language media universally rendered his name as Mao Tse-tung, using the Wade–Giles system of transliteration though with the circumflex accent in the syllable &quot;Tsê&quot; dropped. Due to its recognizability, the spelling was used widely, even by the PRC&#x27;s foreign ministry after Hanyu Pinyin became the PRC&#x27;s official romanisation system for Mandarin Chinese in 1958; the well-known booklet of Mao&#x27;s political statements was officially entitled &quot;Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung&quot; in English translations. While the pinyin-derived spelling &quot;Mao Zedong&quot; is increasingly common, the Wade–Giles-derived spelling &quot;Mao Tse-tung&quot; continues to be used in modern publications to some extent.

== Early life ==
=== Youth and the Xinhai Revolution: 1893–1911 ===

Mao Zedong was born on 26 December 1893, near Shaoshan village in Hunan, during the Qing dynasty. His father, Mao Yichang, was a formerly impoverished peasant who had become one of the wealthiest farmers in Shaoshan. Growing up in rural Hunan, Mao described his father as a stern disciplinarian, who would beat him and his three siblings, the boys Zemin and Zetan, as well as an adopted sister/cousin, Zejian. Mao&#x27;s mother, Wen Qimei, was a devout Buddhist who tried to temper her husband&#x27;s strict attitude. Mao too became a Buddhist, but abandoned this faith in his mid-teenage years. At age 8, Mao was sent to Shaoshan Primary School. Learning the value systems of Confucianism, he later admitted that he did not enjoy the classical Chinese texts preaching Confucian morals, instead favouring classic novels like &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; and &quot;Water Margin&quot;. At age 13, Mao finished primary education, and his father united him in an arranged marriage to the 17-year-old Luo Yixiu, thereby uniting their land-owning families. Mao refused to recognise her as his wife, becoming a fierce critic of arranged marriage and temporarily moving away. Luo was locally disgraced and died in 1910 at 20 years old.

Working on his father&#x27;s farm, Mao read voraciously and developed a &quot;political consciousness&quot; from Zheng Guanying&#x27;s booklet which lamented the deterioration of Chinese power and argued for the adoption of representative democracy. Mao also read translations of works by Western authors including Adam Smith, Montesquieu, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Charles Darwin, and Thomas Huxley. Interested in history, Mao was inspired by the military prowess and nationalistic fervour of George Washington and Napoleon Bonaparte. His political views were shaped by Gelaohui-led protests which erupted following a famine in Changsha, the capital of Hunan; Mao supported the protesters&#x27; demands, but the armed forces suppressed the dissenters and executed their leaders. The famine spread to Shaoshan, where starving peasants seized his father&#x27;s grain. He disapproved of their actions as morally wrong, but claimed sympathy for their situation. At age 16, Mao moved to a higher primary school in nearby Dongshan, where he was bullied for his peasant background.

In 1911, Mao began middle school in Changsha. Revolutionary sentiment was strong in the city, where there was widespread animosity towards Emperor Puyi&#x27;s absolute monarchy and many were advocating republicanism. The republicans&#x27; figurehead was Sun Yat-sen, an American-educated Christian who led the Tongmenghui society. In Changsha, Mao was influenced by Sun&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;The People&#x27;s Independence&quot; (&quot;Minli bao&quot;), and called for Sun to become president in a school essay. As a symbol of rebellion against the Manchu monarch, Mao and a friend cut off their queue pigtails, a sign of subservience to the emperor.

Inspired by Sun&#x27;s republicanism, the army rose up across southern China, sparking the Xinhai Revolution. Changsha&#x27;s governor fled, leaving the city in republican control. Supporting the revolution, Mao joined the rebel army as a private soldier, but was not involved in fighting or combat. The northern provinces remained loyal to the emperor, and hoping to avoid a civil war, Sun—proclaimed &quot;provisional president&quot; by his supporters—compromised with the monarchist general Yuan Shikai. The monarchy was abolished, creating the Republic of China, but the monarchist Yuan became president. With the revolution over, Mao resigned from the army in 1912, after six months as a soldier. Around this time, Mao discovered socialism from a newspaper article; proceeding to read pamphlets by Jiang Kanghu, the student founder of the Chinese Socialist Party, Mao remained interested yet unconvinced by the idea.

=== Fourth Normal School of Changsha: 1912–1919 ===
Over the next few years, Mao Zedong enrolled in and dropped out of a police academy, a soap-production school, a law school, an economics school, and the government-run Changsha Middle School. Studying independently, he spent much time in Changsha&#x27;s library, reading core works of classical liberalism such as Adam Smith&#x27;s &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; and Montesquieu&#x27;s &quot;The Spirit of the Laws&quot;, as well as the works of western scientists and philosophers such as Darwin, Mill, Rousseau, and Spencer. Viewing himself as an intellectual, years later he admitted that at this time he thought himself better than working people. He was inspired by Friedrich Paulsen, a neo-Kantian philosopher and educator whose emphasis on the achievement of a carefully defined goal as the highest value led Mao to believe that strong individuals were not bound by moral codes but should strive for a great goal. His father saw no use in his son&#x27;s intellectual pursuits, cut off his allowance and forced him to move into a hostel for the destitute.

Mao wanted to become a teacher and enrolled at the Fourth Normal School of Changsha, which soon merged with the First Normal School of Hunan, widely seen as the best in Hunan. Befriending Mao, professor Yang Changji urged him to read a radical newspaper, &quot;New Youth&quot; (&quot;Xin qingnian&quot;), the creation of his friend Chen Duxiu, a dean at Peking University. Although he was a supporter of Chinese nationalism, Chen argued that China must look to the west to cleanse itself of superstition and autocracy. In his first school year, Mao befriended an older student, Xiao Zisheng; together they went on a walking tour of Hunan, begging and writing literary couplets to obtain food.

A popular student, in 1915 Mao was elected secretary of the Students&#x27; Society. He organised the Association for Student Self-Government and led protests against school rules. Mao published his first article in &quot;New Youth&quot; in April 1917, instructing readers to increase their physical strength to serve the revolution. He joined the Society for the Study of Wang Fuzhi (&quot;Chuan-shan Hsüeh-she&quot;), a revolutionary group founded by Changsha literati who wished to emulate the philosopher Wang Fuzhi. In spring 1917, he was elected to command the students&#x27; volunteer army, set up to defend the school from marauding soldiers. Increasingly interested in the techniques of war, he took a keen interest in World War I, and also began to develop a sense of solidarity with workers. Mao undertook feats of physical endurance with Xiao Zisheng and Cai Hesen, and with other young revolutionaries they formed the Renovation of the People Study Society in April 1918 to debate Chen Duxiu&#x27;s ideas. Desiring personal and societal transformation, the Society gained 70–80 members, many of whom would later join the Communist Party. Mao graduated in June 1919, ranked third in the year.

== Early revolutionary activity ==
=== Beijing, anarchism, and Marxism: 1917–1919 ===

Mao moved to Beijing, where his mentor Yang Changji had taken a job at Peking University. Yang thought Mao exceptionally &quot;intelligent and handsome&quot;, securing him a job as assistant to the university librarian Li Dazhao, who would become an early Chinese Communist. Li authored a series of &quot;New Youth&quot; articles on the October Revolution in Russia, during which the Communist Bolshevik Party under the leadership of Vladimir Lenin had seized power. Lenin was an advocate of the socio-political theory of Marxism, first developed by the German sociologists Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, and Li&#x27;s articles added Marxism to the doctrines in the Chinese revolutionary movement.

Becoming &quot;more and more radical&quot;, Mao was initially influenced by Peter Kropotkin&#x27;s anarchism, which was the most prominent radical doctrine of the day. Chinese anarchists, such as Cai Yuanpei, Chancellor of Peking University, called for complete social revolution in social relations, family structure, and women&#x27;s equality, rather than the simple change in the form of government called for by earlier revolutionaries. He joined Li&#x27;s Study Group and &quot;developed rapidly toward Marxism&quot; during the winter of 1919. Paid a low wage, Mao lived in a cramped room with seven other Hunanese students, but believed that Beijing&#x27;s beauty offered &quot;vivid and living compensation&quot;. A number of his friends took advantage of the anarchist-organised &quot;Mouvement Travail-Études&quot; to study in France, but Mao declined, perhaps because of an inability to learn languages. Mao raised funds for the movement, however.

At the university, Mao was snubbed by other students due to his rural Hunanese accent and lowly position. He joined the university&#x27;s Philosophy and Journalism Societies and attended lectures and seminars by the likes of Chen Duxiu, Hu Shih, and Qian Xuantong. Mao&#x27;s time in Beijing ended in the spring of 1919, when he travelled to Shanghai with friends who were preparing to leave for France. He did not return to Shaoshan, where his mother was terminally ill. She died in October 1919 and her husband died in January 1920.

=== New Culture and political protests: 1919–1920 ===

On 4 May 1919, students in Beijing gathered at Tiananmen to protest the Chinese government&#x27;s weak resistance to Japanese expansion in China. Patriots were outraged at the influence given to Japan in the Twenty-One Demands in 1915, the complicity of Duan Qirui&#x27;s Beiyang government, and the betrayal of China in the Treaty of Versailles, wherein Japan was allowed to receive territories in Shandong which had been surrendered by Germany. These demonstrations ignited the nationwide May Fourth Movement and fuelled the New Culture Movement which blamed China&#x27;s diplomatic defeats on social and cultural backwardness.

In Changsha, Mao had begun teaching history at the Xiuye Primary School and organising protests against the pro-Duan Governor of Hunan Province, Zhang Jingyao, popularly known as &quot;Zhang the Venomous&quot; due to his corrupt and violent rule. In late May, Mao co-founded the Hunanese Student Association with He Shuheng and Deng Zhongxia, organising a student strike for June and in July 1919 began production of a weekly radical magazine, &quot;Xiang River Review&quot;. Using vernacular language that would be understandable to the majority of China&#x27;s populace, he advocated the need for a &quot;Great Union of the Popular Masses&quot;, and strengthened trade unions able to wage non-violent revolution. His ideas were not Marxist, but heavily influenced by Kropotkin&#x27;s concept of mutual aid.
Zhang banned the Student Association, but Mao continued publishing after assuming editorship of the liberal magazine &quot;New Hunan&quot; (&quot;Xin Hunan&quot;) and authored articles in popular local newspaper &quot;Ta Kung Pao&quot;. Several of these advocated feminist views, calling for the liberation of women in Chinese society; Mao was influenced by his forced arranged-marriage. In fall 1919, Mao organized a seminar in Changsha studying economic and political issues, as well as ways to unite the people, the feasibility of socialism, and issues regarding Confucianism. During this period, Mao involved himself in political work with manual laborers, setting up night schools and trade unions. In December 1919, Mao helped organise a general strike in Hunan, securing some concessions, but Mao and other student leaders felt threatened by Zhang, and Mao returned to Beijing, visiting the terminally ill Yang Changji. Mao found that his articles had achieved a level of fame among the revolutionary movement, and set about soliciting support in overthrowing Zhang. Coming across newly translated Marxist literature by Thomas Kirkup, Karl Kautsky, and Marx and Engels—notably &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot;—he came under their increasing influence, but was still eclectic in his views.

Mao visited Tianjin, Jinan, and Qufu, before moving to Shanghai, where he worked as a laundryman and met Chen Duxiu, noting that Chen&#x27;s adoption of Marxism &quot;deeply impressed me at what was probably a critical period in my life&quot;. In Shanghai, Mao met an old teacher of his, Yi Peiji, a revolutionary and member of the Kuomintang (KMT), or Chinese Nationalist Party, which was gaining increasing support and influence. Yi introduced Mao to General Tan Yankai, a senior KMT member who held the loyalty of troops stationed along the Hunanese border with Guangdong. Tan was plotting to overthrow Zhang, and Mao aided him by organising the Changsha students. In June 1920, Tan led his troops into Changsha, and Zhang fled. In the subsequent reorganisation of the provincial administration, Mao was appointed headmaster of the junior section of the First Normal School. Now receiving a large income, he married Yang Kaihui, daughter of Yang Changji, in the winter of 1920.

=== Founding the Chinese Communist Party: 1921–1922 ===
The Chinese Communist Party was founded by Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao in the Shanghai French Concession in 1921 as a study society and informal network. Mao set up a Changsha branch, also establishing a branch of the Socialist Youth Corps and a Cultural Book Society which opened a bookstore to propagate revolutionary literature throughout Hunan. He was involved in the movement for Hunan autonomy, in the hope that a Hunanese constitution would increase civil liberties and make his revolutionary activity easier. When the movement was successful in establishing provincial autonomy under a new warlord, Mao forgot his involvement. By 1921, small Marxist groups existed in Shanghai, Beijing, Changsha, Wuhan, Guangzhou, and Jinan; it was decided to hold a central meeting, which began in Shanghai on 23 July 1921. The first session of the National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party was attended by 13 delegates, Mao included. After the authorities sent a police spy to the congress, the delegates moved to a boat on South Lake near Jiaxing, in Zhejiang, to escape detection. Although Soviet and Comintern delegates attended, the first congress ignored Lenin&#x27;s advice to accept a temporary alliance between the Communists and the &quot;bourgeois democrats&quot; who also advocated national revolution; instead they stuck to the orthodox Marxist belief that only the urban proletariat could lead a socialist revolution.

Mao was party secretary for Hunan stationed in Changsha, and to build the party there he followed a variety of tactics. In August 1921, he founded the Self-Study University, through which readers could gain access to revolutionary literature, housed in the premises of the Society for the Study of Wang Fuzhi, a Qing dynasty Hunanese philosopher who had resisted the Manchus. He joined the YMCA Mass Education Movement to fight illiteracy, though he edited the textbooks to include radical sentiments. He continued organising workers to strike against the administration of Hunan Governor Zhao Hengti. Yet labour issues remained central. The successful and famous (contrary to later Party historians) depended on both &quot;proletarian&quot; and &quot;bourgeois&quot; strategies. Liu Shaoqi and Li Lisan and Mao not only mobilised the miners, but formed schools and cooperatives and engaged local intellectuals, gentry, military officers, merchants, Red Gang dragon heads and even church clergy. Mao&#x27;s labour organizing work in the Anyuan mines also involved his wife Yang Kaihui, who worked for women&#x27;s rights, including literacy and educational issues, in the nearby peasant communities. Although Mao and Yang were not the originators of this political organizing method of combining labor organizing among male workers with a focus on women&#x27;s rights issues in their communities, they were among the most effective at using this method. Mao&#x27;s political organizing success in the Anyuan mines resulted in Chen Duxiu inviting him to become a member of the Communist Party&#x27;s Central Committee.

Mao claimed that he missed the July 1922 Second Congress of the Communist Party in Shanghai because he lost the address. Adopting Lenin&#x27;s advice, the delegates agreed to an alliance with the &quot;bourgeois democrats&quot; of the KMT for the good of the &quot;national revolution&quot;. Communist Party members joined the KMT, hoping to push its politics leftward.
Mao enthusiastically agreed with this decision, arguing for an alliance across China&#x27;s socio-economic classes, and eventually rose to become propaganda chief of the KMT. Mao was a vocal anti-imperialist and in his writings he lambasted the governments of Japan, the UK and US, describing the latter as &quot;the most murderous of hangmen&quot;.

=== Collaboration with the Kuomintang: 1922–1927 ===
At the Third Congress of the Communist Party in Shanghai in June 1923, the delegates reaffirmed their commitment to working with the KMT. Supporting this position, Mao was elected to the Party Committee, taking up residence in Shanghai. At the First KMT Congress, held in Guangzhou in early 1924, Mao was elected an alternate member of the KMT Central Executive Committee, and put forward four resolutions to decentralise power to urban and rural bureaus. His enthusiastic support for the KMT earned him the suspicion of Li Li-san, his Hunan comrade.

In late 1924, Mao returned to Shaoshan, perhaps to recuperate from an illness. He found that the peasantry were increasingly restless and some had seized land from wealthy landowners to found communes. This convinced him of the revolutionary potential of the peasantry, an idea advocated by the KMT leftists but not the Communists. Mao and many of his colleagues also proposed the end of cooperation with the KMT, which was rejected by the Comintern representative Mikhail Borodin. In the winter of 1925, Mao fled to Guangzhou after his revolutionary activities attracted the attention of Zhao&#x27;s regional authorities. There, he ran the 6th term of the KMT&#x27;s Peasant Movement Training Institute from May to September 1926. The Peasant Movement Training Institute under Mao trained cadres and prepared them for militant activity, taking them through military training exercises and getting them to study basic left-wing texts.

When party leader Sun Yat-sen died in May 1925, he was succeeded by Chiang Kai-shek, who moved to marginalise the left-KMT and the Communists. Mao nevertheless supported Chiang&#x27;s National Revolutionary Army, who embarked on the Northern Expedition attack in 1926 on warlords. In the wake of this expedition, peasants rose up, appropriating the land of the wealthy landowners, who were in many cases killed. Such uprisings angered senior KMT figures, who were themselves landowners, emphasising the growing class and ideological divide within the revolutionary movement.

In March 1927, Mao appeared at the Third Plenum of the KMT Central Executive Committee in Wuhan, which sought to strip General Chiang of his power by appointing Wang Jingwei leader. There, Mao played an active role in the discussions regarding the peasant issue, defending a set of &quot;Regulations for the Repression of Local Bullies and Bad Gentry&quot;, which advocated the death penalty or life imprisonment for anyone found guilty of counter-revolutionary activity, arguing that in a revolutionary situation, &quot;peaceful methods cannot suffice&quot;. In April 1927, Mao was appointed to the KMT&#x27;s five-member Central Land Committee, urging peasants to refuse to pay rent. Mao led another group to put together a &quot;Draft Resolution on the Land Question&quot;, which called for the confiscation of land belonging to &quot;local bullies and bad gentry, corrupt officials, militarists and all counter-revolutionary elements in the villages&quot;. Proceeding to carry out a &quot;Land Survey&quot;, he stated that anyone owning over 30 &quot;mou&quot; (four and a half acres), constituting 13% of the population, were uniformly counter-revolutionary. He accepted that there was great variation in revolutionary enthusiasm across the country, and that a flexible policy of land redistribution was necessary. Presenting his conclusions at the Enlarged Land Committee meeting, many expressed reservations, some believing that it went too far, and others not far enough. Ultimately, his suggestions were only partially implemented.

== Civil War ==
=== Nanchang and Autumn Harvest Uprisings: 1927 ===
Fresh from the success of the Northern Expedition against the warlords, Chiang turned on the Communists, who then numbered in the tens of thousands across China. Chiang ignored the orders of the Wuhan-based leftist KMT government and marched on Shanghai, a city controlled by Communist militias. As the Communists awaited Chiang&#x27;s arrival, he loosed the White Terror, massacring with the aid of the Green Gang. In Beijing, 19 leading Communists were killed by Zhang Zuolin. That May, tens of thousands of Communists and those suspected of being communists were killed, and the CCP lost approximately of its members.

The CCP continued supporting the leftist KMT government in Wuhan, a position Mao initially supported, but by the time of the CCP&#x27;s Fifth Congress he had changed his mind, deciding to stake all hope on the peasant militia. The question was rendered moot when the Wuhan government expelled all Communists from the KMT on 15 July. The CCP founded the Workers&#x27; and Peasants&#x27; Red Army of China, better known as the &quot;Red Army&quot;, to battle Chiang. A battalion led by General Zhu De was ordered to take the city of Nanchang on 1 August 1927, in what became known as the Nanchang Uprising. They were initially successful, but were forced into retreat after five days, marching south to Shantou, and from there they were driven into the wilderness of Fujian. Mao was appointed commander-in-chief of the Red Army and led four regiments against Changsha in the Autumn Harvest Uprising, in the hope of sparking peasant uprisings across Hunan. On the eve of the attack, Mao composed a poem—the earliest of his to survive—titled &quot;Changsha&quot;. His plan was to attack the KMT-held city from three directions on 9 September, but the Fourth Regiment deserted to the KMT cause, attacking the Third Regiment. Mao&#x27;s army made it to Changsha, but could not take it; by 15 September, he accepted defeat and with 1000 survivors marched east to the Jinggang Mountains of Jiangxi.

=== Base in Jinggangshan: 1927–1928 ===

The CCP Central Committee, hiding in Shanghai, expelled Mao from their ranks and from the Hunan Provincial Committee, as punishment for his &quot;military opportunism&quot;, for his focus on rural activity, and for being too lenient with &quot;bad gentry&quot;. The more orthodox Communists especially regarded the peasants as backward and ridiculed Mao&#x27;s idea of mobilizing them. They nevertheless adopted three policies he had long championed: the immediate formation of workers&#x27; councils, the confiscation of all land without exemption, and the rejection of the KMT. Mao&#x27;s response was to ignore them. He established a base in Jinggangshan City, an area of the Jinggang Mountains, where he united five villages as a self-governing state, and supported the confiscation of land from rich landlords, who were &quot;re-educated&quot; and sometimes executed. He ensured that no massacres took place in the region, and pursued a more lenient approach than that advocated by the Central Committee. In addition to land redistribution, Mao promoted literacy and non-hierarchical organizational relationships in Jinggangshan, transforming the area&#x27;s social and economic life and attracted many local supporters.

Mao proclaimed that &quot;Even the lame, the deaf and the blind could all come in useful for the revolutionary struggle&quot;, he boosted the army&#x27;s numbers, incorporating two groups of bandits into his army, building a force of around troops. He laid down rules for his soldiers: prompt obedience to orders, all confiscations were to be turned over to the government, and nothing was to be confiscated from poorer peasants. In doing so, he moulded his men into a disciplined, efficient fighting force.

In spring 1928, the Central Committee ordered Mao&#x27;s troops to southern Hunan, hoping to spark peasant uprisings. Mao was skeptical, but complied. They reached Hunan, where they were attacked by the KMT and fled after heavy losses. Meanwhile, KMT troops had invaded Jinggangshan, leaving them without a base. Wandering the countryside, Mao&#x27;s forces came across a CCP regiment led by General Zhu De and Lin Biao; they united, and attempted to retake Jinggangshan. They were initially successful, but the KMT counter-attacked, and pushed the CCP back; over the next few weeks, they fought an entrenched guerrilla war in the mountains. The Central Committee again ordered Mao to march to south Hunan, but he refused, and remained at his base. Contrastingly, Zhu complied, and led his armies away. Mao&#x27;s troops fended the KMT off for 25 days while he left the camp at night to find reinforcements. He reunited with the decimated Zhu&#x27;s army, and together they returned to Jinggangshan and retook the base. There they were joined by a defecting KMT regiment and Peng Dehuai&#x27;s Fifth Red Army. In the mountainous area they were unable to grow enough crops to feed everyone, leading to food shortages throughout the winter.

In 1928, Mao met and married He Zizhen, an 18-year-old revolutionary who would bear him six children.

=== Jiangxi Soviet Republic of China: 1929–1934 ===
In January 1929, Mao and Zhu evacuated the base with 2,000 men and a further 800 provided by Peng, and took their armies south, to the area around Tonggu and Xinfeng in Jiangxi. The evacuation led to a drop in morale, and many troops became disobedient and began thieving; this worried Li Lisan and the Central Committee, who saw Mao&#x27;s army as &quot;lumpenproletariat&quot;, that were unable to share in proletariat class consciousness. In keeping with orthodox Marxist thought, Li believed that only the urban proletariat could lead a successful revolution, and saw little need for Mao&#x27;s peasant guerrillas; he ordered Mao to disband his army into units to be sent out to spread the revolutionary message. Mao replied that while he concurred with Li&#x27;s theoretical position, he would not disband his army nor abandon his base. Both Li and Mao saw the Chinese revolution as the key to world revolution, believing that a CCP victory would spark the overthrow of global imperialism and capitalism. In this, they disagreed with the official line of the Soviet government and Comintern. Officials in Moscow desired greater control over the CCP and removed Li from power by calling him to Russia for an inquest into his errors. They replaced him with Soviet-educated Chinese Communists, known as the &quot;28 Bolsheviks&quot;, two of whom, Bo Gu and Zhang Wentian, took control of the Central Committee. Mao disagreed with the new leadership, believing they grasped little of the Chinese situation, and he soon emerged as their key rival.
In February 1930, Mao created the Southwest Jiangxi Provincial Soviet Government in the region under his control. In November, he suffered emotional trauma after his second wife Yang Kaihui and sister were captured and beheaded by KMT general He Jian. Facing internal problems, members of the Jiangxi Soviet accused him of being too moderate, and hence anti-revolutionary. In December, they tried to overthrow Mao, resulting in the Futian incident, during which Mao&#x27;s loyalists tortured many and executed between 2000 and 3000 dissenters. The CCP Central Committee moved to Jiangxi which it saw as a secure area. In November, it proclaimed Jiangxi to be the Soviet Republic of China, an independent Communist-governed state. Although he was proclaimed Chairman of the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars, Mao&#x27;s power was diminished, as his control of the Red Army was allocated to Zhou Enlai. Meanwhile, Mao recovered from tuberculosis.

The KMT armies adopted a policy of encirclement and annihilation of the Red armies. Outnumbered, Mao responded with guerrilla tactics influenced by the works of ancient military strategists like Sun Tzu, but Zhou and the new leadership followed a policy of open confrontation and conventional warfare. In doing so, the Red Army successfully defeated the first and second encirclements. Angered at his armies&#x27; failure, Chiang Kai-shek personally arrived to lead the operation. He too faced setbacks and retreated to deal with the further Japanese incursions into China. As a result of the KMT&#x27;s change of focus to the defence of China against Japanese expansionism, the Red Army was able to expand its area of control, eventually encompassing a population of 3 million. Mao proceeded with his land reform program. In November 1931 he announced the start of a &quot;land verification project&quot; which was expanded in June 1933. He also orchestrated education programs and implemented measures to increase female political participation. Chiang viewed the Communists as a greater threat than the Japanese and returned to Jiangxi, where he initiated the fifth encirclement campaign, which involved the construction of a concrete and barbed wire &quot;wall of fire&quot; around the state, which was accompanied by aerial bombardment, to which Zhou&#x27;s tactics proved ineffective. Trapped inside, morale among the Red Army dropped as food and medicine became scarce. The leadership decided to evacuate.

=== Long March: 1934–1935 ===
On 14 October 1934, the Red Army broke through the KMT line on the Jiangxi Soviet&#x27;s south-west corner at Xinfeng with soldiers and party cadres and embarked on the &quot;Long March&quot;. In order to make the escape, many of the wounded and the ill, as well as women and children, were left behind, defended by a group of guerrilla fighters whom the KMT massacred. The who escaped headed to southern Hunan, first crossing the Xiang River after heavy fighting, and then the Wu River, in Guizhou where they took Zunyi in January 1935. Temporarily resting in the city, they held a conference; here, Mao was elected to a position of leadership, becoming Chairman of the Politburo, and &quot;de facto&quot; leader of both Party and Red Army, in part because his candidacy was supported by Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin. Insisting that they operate as a guerrilla force, he laid out a destination: the Shenshi Soviet in Shaanxi, Northern China, from where the Communists could focus on fighting the Japanese. Mao believed that in focusing on the anti-imperialist struggle, the Communists would earn the trust of the Chinese people, who in turn would renounce the KMT.

From Zunyi, Mao led his troops to Loushan Pass, where they faced armed opposition but successfully crossed the river. Chiang flew into the area to lead his armies against Mao, but the Communists outmanoeuvred him and crossed the Jinsha River. Faced with the more difficult task of crossing the Tatu River, they managed it by fighting a battle over the Luding Bridge in May, taking Luding. In Moukung, Western Sichuan, they encountered the -strong CCP Fourth Front Army of Zhang Guotao (who had marched from the mountain ranges around Ma&#x27;anshan), and together proceeded to Maoerhkai and then Gansu. Zhang and Mao disagreed over what to do; the latter wished to proceed to Shaanxi, while Zhang wanted to retreat west to Tibet or Sikkim, far from the KMT threat. It was agreed that they would go their separate ways, with Zhu De joining Zhang. Mao&#x27;s forces proceeded north, through hundreds of kilometres of grasslands, an area of quagmire where they were attacked by Manchu tribesman and where many soldiers succumbed to famine and disease. Finally reaching Shaanxi, they fought off both the KMT and an Islamic cavalry militia before crossing the Min Mountains and Mount Liupan and reaching the Shenshi Soviet; only 7,000–8,000 had survived. The Long March cemented Mao&#x27;s status as the dominant figure in the party. In November 1935, he was named chairman of the Military Commission. From this point onward, Mao was the Communist Party&#x27;s undisputed leader, even though he would not become party chairman until 1943.

== World War II ==


Mao&#x27;s troops arrived at the Yan&#x27;an Soviet during October 1935 and settled in Bao&#x27;an, until spring 1936. While there, they developed links with local communities, redistributed and farmed the land, offered medical treatment, and began literacy programs. Mao now commanded soldiers, boosted by the arrival of He Long&#x27;s men from Hunan and the armies of Zhu De and Zhang Guotao returned from Tibet. In February 1936, they established the North West Anti-Japanese Red Army University in Yan&#x27;an, through which they trained increasing numbers of new recruits. In January 1937, they began the &quot;anti-Japanese expedition&quot;, that sent groups of guerrilla fighters into Japanese-controlled territory to undertake sporadic attacks. In May 1937, a Communist Conference was held in Yan&#x27;an to discuss the situation. Western reporters also arrived in the &quot;Border Region&quot; (as the Soviet had been renamed); most notable were Edgar Snow, who used his experiences as a basis for &quot;Red Star Over China&quot;, and Agnes Smedley, whose accounts brought international attention to Mao&#x27;s cause.


On the Long March, Mao&#x27;s wife He Zizhen had been injured by a shrapnel wound to the head. She travelled to Moscow for medical treatment; Mao proceeded to divorce her and marry an actress, Jiang Qing. He Zizhen was reportedly &quot;dispatched to a mental asylum in Moscow to make room&quot; for Qing. Mao moved into a cave-house and spent much of his time reading, tending his garden and theorising. He came to believe that the Red Army alone was unable to defeat the Japanese, and that a Communist-led &quot;government of national defence&quot; should be formed with the KMT and other &quot;bourgeois nationalist&quot; elements to achieve this goal. Although despising Chiang Kai-shek as a &quot;traitor to the nation&quot;, on 5 May, he telegrammed the Military Council of the Nanjing National Government proposing a military alliance, a course of action advocated by Stalin. Although Chiang intended to ignore Mao&#x27;s message and continue the civil war, he was arrested by one of his own generals, Zhang Xueliang, in Xi&#x27;an, leading to the Xi&#x27;an Incident; Zhang forced Chiang to discuss the issue with the Communists, resulting in the formation of a United Front with concessions on both sides on 25 December 1937.

The Japanese had taken both Shanghai and Nanjing—resulting in the Nanjing Massacre, an atrocity Mao never spoke of all his life—and was pushing the Kuomintang government inland to Chongqing. The Japanese&#x27;s brutality led to increasing numbers of Chinese joining the fight, and the Red Army grew from to . In August 1938, the Red Army formed the New Fourth Army and the Eighth Route Army, which were nominally under the command of Chiang&#x27;s National Revolutionary Army. In August 1940, the Red Army initiated the Hundred Regiments Offensive, in which troops attacked the Japanese simultaneously in five provinces. It was a military success that resulted in the death of Japanese, the disruption of railways and the loss of a coal mine. From his base in Yan&#x27;an, Mao authored several texts for his troops, including &quot;Philosophy of Revolution&quot;, which offered an introduction to the Marxist theory of knowledge; &quot;Protracted Warfare&quot;, which dealt with guerrilla and mobile military tactics; and &quot;On New Democracy&quot;, which laid forward ideas for China&#x27;s future.

In 1944, the U.S. sent a special diplomatic envoy, called the Dixie Mission, to the Chinese Communist Party. The American soldiers who were sent to the mission were favourably impressed. The party seemed less corrupt, more unified, and more vigorous in its resistance to Japan than the Kuomintang. The soldiers confirmed to their superiors that the party was both strong and popular over a broad area. In the end of the mission, the contacts which the U.S. developed with the Chinese Communist Party led to very little. After the end of World War II, the U.S. continued their diplomatic and military assistance to Chiang Kai-shek and his KMT government forces against the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) led by Mao Zedong during the civil war and abandoned the idea of a coalition government which would include the CCP. Likewise, the Soviet Union gave support to Mao by occupying north-eastern China, and secretly giving it to the Chinese communists in March 1946.

== Leadership of China ==
=== Establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China ===
In 1948, the People&#x27;s Liberation Army starved out the Kuomintang forces occupying Changchun. At least civilians are believed to have perished during the siege, which lasted from June until October. PLA lieutenant colonel Zhang Zhenglu, in his book &quot;White Snow, Red Blood&quot;, compared it to Hiroshima: &quot;The casualties were about the same. Hiroshima took nine seconds; Changchun took five months.&quot; On 21 January 1949, Kuomintang forces suffered great losses in decisive battles against Mao&#x27;s forces. In the early morning of 10 December 1949, PLA troops laid siege to Chongqing and Chengdu on mainland China, and Chiang Kai-shek fled from the mainland to Taiwan.

Mao proclaimed the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China from the Gate of Heavenly Peace (Tian&#x27;anmen) on 1 October 1949, and later that week declared &quot;The Chinese people have stood up&quot; (). Mao went to Moscow for talks in the winter of 1949–50. Mao initiated the talks which focused on the political and economic revolution in China, foreign policy, railways, naval bases, and Soviet economic and technical aid. The resulting treaty reflected Stalin&#x27;s dominance and his willingness to help Mao.

Following the Marxist–Leninist theory of vanguardism, Mao believed that only the correct leadership of the Communist Party could advance China into socialism. Conversely, Mao also believed that mass movements and mass criticism were necessary in order to check the bureaucracy.

=== Korean War ===
Mao pushed the Party to organise campaigns to reform society and extend control. These campaigns were given urgency in October 1950, when the People&#x27;s Volunteer Army was sent into the Korean War to fight as well as reinforce the armed forces of North Korea, the Korean People&#x27;s Army, which had been in full retreat. The United States placed a trade embargo on the People&#x27;s Republic as a result of its involvement in the Korean War, lasting until Richard Nixon&#x27;s improvements of relations. At least 180,000 Chinese troops died during the war.

As the Chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC), Mao was also the Supreme Commander in Chief of the PLA and the People&#x27;s Republic and Chairman of the Party. Chinese troops in Korea were under the overall command of then newly installed Premier Zhou Enlai, with General Peng Dehuai as field commander and political commissar.

=== Social reform ===
During the land reform campaigns, large numbers of landlords and rich peasants were beaten to death at mass meetings as land was taken from them and given to poorer peasants, which reduced economic inequality. The Campaign to Suppress Counter-revolutionaries targeted bureaucratic bourgeoisie, such as compradors, merchants and Kuomintang officials who were seen by the party as economic parasites or political enemies. In 1976, the U.S. State Department estimated as many as a million were killed in the land reform, and killed in the counter-revolutionary campaign.

Mao himself claimed that a total of people were killed in attacks on &quot;counter-revolutionaries&quot; during the years 1950–1952. Because there was a policy to select &quot;at least one landlord, and usually several, in virtually every village for public execution&quot;, the number of deaths range between 2 million and 5 million. In addition, at least 1.5 million people, perhaps as many as 4 to 6 million, were sent to &quot;reform through labour&quot; camps where many perished. Mao played a personal role in organising the mass repressions and established a system of execution quotas, which were often exceeded. He defended these killings as necessary for the securing of power.

The government is credited with eradicating both consumption and production of opium during the 1950s. Ten million addicts were forced into compulsory treatment, dealers were executed, and opium-producing regions were planted with new crops. Remaining opium production shifted south of the Chinese border into the Golden Triangle region.

=== Three-anti and Five-anti Campaigns ===
Starting in 1951, Mao initiated movements to rid urban areas of corruption; the Three-anti and Five-anti Campaigns. Whereas the three-anti campaign was a focused purge of government, industrial and party officials, the five-anti campaign set its sights slightly more broadly, targeting capitalist elements in general. Workers denounced their bosses, spouses turned on their spouses, and children informed on their parents; the victims were often humiliated at struggle sessions, where a targeted person would be verbally and physically abused until they confessed to crimes. Mao insisted that minor offenders be criticised and reformed or sent to labour camps, &quot;while the worst among them should be shot&quot;. These campaigns took several hundred thousand additional lives, the vast majority via suicide.

In Shanghai, suicide by jumping from tall buildings became so commonplace that residents avoided walking on the pavement near skyscrapers for fear that suicides might land on them. Some biographers have pointed out that driving those perceived as enemies to suicide was a common tactic during the Mao-era. In his biography of Mao, Philip Short notes that Mao gave explicit instructions in the Yan&#x27;an Rectification Movement that &quot;no cadre is to be killed&quot; but in practice allowed security chief Kang Sheng to drive opponents to suicide and that &quot;this pattern was repeated throughout his leadership of the People&#x27;s Republic&quot;.

=== Five-year plans ===
Following the consolidation of power, Mao launched the first five-year plan (1953–1958), which emphasised rapid industrial development. Within industry, iron and steel, electric power, coal, heavy engineering, building materials, and basic chemicals were prioritised with the aim of constructing large and highly capital-intensive plants. Many of these plants were built with Soviet assistance and heavy industry grew rapidly. Agriculture, industry and trade were organised as worker cooperatives. This period marked the beginning of China&#x27;s rapid industrialisation and it resulted in an enormous success.

Despite being initially sympathetic towards the reformist government of Imre Nagy, Mao feared the &quot;reactionary restoration&quot; in Hungary as the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 continued and became more hardline. Mao opposed the withdrawal of Soviet troops by asking Liu Shaoqi to inform the Soviet representatives to use military intervention against &quot;Western imperialist-backed&quot; protestors and Nagy&#x27;s government. However, it was unclear to what degree Mao&#x27;s stance played a role in Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s decision to invade Hungary. It was also unclear if China was forced to conform to the Soviet position due to economic concerns and China&#x27;s poor power projections compared to the USSR. Despite his disagreements with Moscow&#x27;s hegemony in the Eastern Bloc, Mao viewed the integrity of the international communist movement as more important than the national autonomy of the countries in the Soviet sphere of influence. The Hungarian crisis also influenced Mao&#x27;s Hundred Flowers Campaign. Mao decided to soften his stance on Chinese intelligentsia and allow them to express their social dissatisfaction and criticisms of the errors of the government. Mao wanted to use this movement to prevent a similar uprising in China. However, as people in China began to criticize the CCP&#x27;s policies and Mao&#x27;s leadership following the Hundred Flowers Campaign, Mao cracked down on the movement he initiated and compared it to the &quot;counter-revolutionary&quot; Hungarian Revolution.

During the Hundred Flowers Campaign, Mao indicated his supposed willingness to consider different opinions about how China should be governed. Given the freedom to express themselves, liberal and intellectual Chinese began opposing the Communist Party and questioning its leadership. This was initially tolerated and encouraged. After a few months, Mao&#x27;s government reversed its policy and persecuted those who had criticised the party, totalling perhaps , as well as those who were merely alleged to have been critical, in what is called the Anti-Rightist Movement. The movement led to the persecution of at least 550,000 people, mostly intellectuals and dissidents. Li Zhisui, Mao&#x27;s physician, suggested that Mao had initially seen the policy as a way of weakening opposition to him within the party and that he was surprised by the extent of criticism and the fact that it came to be directed at his own leadership.

=== Military projects ===
United States President Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s threats during the First Taiwan Strait Crisis to use nuclear weapons against military targets in Fujian province prompted Mao to begin China&#x27;s nuclear program. Under Mao&#x27;s Two Bombs, One Satellite program, China developed the atomic and hydrogen bombs in record time and launched a satellite a few years after the Soviet Union launched Sputnik.

Project 523 is a 1967 military project to find antimalarial medications. It addressed malaria, an important threat in the Vietnam War. Zhou Enlai convinced Mao Zedong to start the mass project &quot;to keep [the] allies&#x27; troops combat-ready&quot;, as the meeting minutes put it. The one for investigating traditional Chinese medicine discovered and led to the development of a class of new antimalarial drugs called artemisinins.

=== Great Leap Forward ===

In January 1958, Mao launched the Great Leap Forward, to turn China from an agrarian nation to an industrialised one. The relatively small agricultural collectives that had been formed were merged into far larger people&#x27;s communes, and many peasants were ordered to work on infrastructure projects and on the production of iron and steel. Some private food production was banned, and livestock and farm implements were brought under collective ownership.

The effect of the diversion of labour to steel production and infrastructure projects, and cyclical natural disasters led to an approximately 15% drop in grain production in 1959 followed by a further 10% decline in 1960 and no recovery in 1961.

To win favour with their superiors and avoid being purged, each layer in the party exaggerated the amount of grain produced under them. Based upon the falsely reported success, party cadres were ordered to requisition a high amount of that fictitious harvest. The result, compounded in some areas by drought and in others by floods, was that farmers were left with little food and many millions starved to death in the Great Chinese Famine. The people of urban areas were given food stamps each month, but the people of rural areas were expected to grow their own crops and give some of the crops back to the government. The death count in rural parts of China surpassed the deaths in the urban centers. The famine was a direct cause of the death of some 30 million Chinese peasants between 1959 and 1962. Many children became malnourished.

In late autumn 1958, Mao condemned the practices used during Great Leap Forward such as forcing peasants to do labour without enough food or rest which resulted in epidemics and starvation. He also acknowledged that anti-rightist campaigns were a major cause of &quot;production at the expense of livelihood.&quot; He refused to abandon the Great Leap Forward, but he did demand that they be confronted. After the July 1959 clash at Lushan Conference with Peng Dehuai, Mao launched a new anti-rightist campaign along with the radical policies that he previously abandoned. It wasn&#x27;t until the spring of 1960, that Mao would again express concern about abnormal deaths and other abuses, but he did not move to stop them. Bernstein concludes that the Chairman &quot;wilfully ignored the lessons of the first radical phase for the sake of achieving extreme ideological and developmental goals&quot;.
Mao stepped down as President of China on 27 April 1959; he retained other top positions such as Chairman of the Communist Party and of the Central Military Commission. The Presidency was transferred to Liu Shaoqi. Mao eventually abandoned the policy in 1962. Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping rescued the economy by disbanding the people&#x27;s communes, introducing elements of private control of peasant smallholdings and importing grain from Canada and Australia to mitigate the worst effects of famine.

At the Lushan Conference in July/August 1959, several ministers expressed concern that the Great Leap Forward had not proved as successful as planned. The most direct of these was Minister of Defence Peng Dehuai. Following Peng&#x27;s criticism of the Great Leap Forward, Mao made a purge of Peng and his supporters, stifling criticism of the Great Leap policies. A campaign was launched and resulted in party members and ordinary peasants being sent to prison labour camps. Years later the CCP would conclude that as many as six million people were wrongly punished in the campaign.

=== Split from Soviet Union ===

The Sino-Soviet split resulted in Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s withdrawal of Soviet technical experts and aid from the country. The split concerned the leadership of world communism. The USSR had a network of Communist parties it supported; China now created its own rival network to battle it out. Lorenz M. Lüthi writes: &quot;The Sino-Soviet split was one of the key events of the Cold War, equal in importance to the construction of the Berlin Wall, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Second Vietnam War, and Sino-American rapprochement. The split helped to determine the framework of the Second Cold War in general, and influenced the course of the Second Vietnam War in particular.&quot;

The split resulted from Khrushchev&#x27;s more moderate Soviet leadership after the death of Stalin in March 1953. Only Albania openly sided with China, thereby forming an alliance between the two countries. Warned that the Soviets had nuclear weapons, Mao minimised the threat. Struggle against Soviet revisionism and U.S. imperialism was an important aspect of Mao&#x27;s attempt to direct the revolution in the right direction.

In the late 1950s, Mao wrote reading notes responding to the Soviet Book &quot;Political Economy: A Textbook&quot; and essays (&quot;A Critique of Soviet Economics&quot;) responding to Stalin&#x27;s &quot;Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR.&quot; These texts reflect Mao&#x27;s views that the USSR was becoming alienated from the masses and distorting socialist development.

=== Third Front ===

After the Great Leap Forward, China&#x27;s leadership slowed the pace of industrialization. It invested more on in China&#x27;s coastal regions and focused on the production of consumer goods. Preliminary drafts of the Third Five Year Plan contained no provision for developing large scale industry in China&#x27;s interior. After an April 1964 General Staff report concluded that the concentration of China&#x27;s industry in its major coastal cities made it vulnerable to attack by foreign powers, Mao argued for the development of basic industry and national defense industry in protected locations in China&#x27;s interior. Although other key leaders did not initially support the idea, the 2 August 1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident increased fears of a potential invasion by the United States and crystallized support for Mao&#x27;s industrialization proposal, which came to be known as the Third Front. Following the Gulf of Tonkin incident, Mao&#x27;s own concerns of invasion by the United States increased. He wrote to central cadres, &quot;A war is going to break out. I need to reconsider my actions&quot; and pushed even harder for the creation of the Third Front.

The secretive Third Front construction involved massive projects including extensive railroad infrastructure like the Chengdu–Kunming line, aerospace industry including satellite launch facilities, and steel production industry including Panzhihua Iron and Steel.

Development of the Third Front slowed in 1966, but accelerated again after the Sino-Soviet border conflict at Zhenbao Island, which increased the perceived risk of Soviet Invasion. Third Front construction again decreased after United States President Richard Nixon&#x27;s 1972 visit to China and the resulting rapprochement between the United States and China. When Reform and Opening up began after Mao&#x27;s death, China began to gradually wind down Third Front projects. The Third Front distributed physical and human capital around the country, ultimately decreased regional disparities and created favorable conditions for later market development.

=== Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution ===
During the early 1960s, Mao became concerned with the nature of post-1959 China. He saw that the old ruling elite was replaced by a new one. He was concerned that those in power were becoming estranged from the people they were to serve. Mao believed that a revolution of culture would unseat and unsettle the &quot;ruling class&quot; and keep China in a state of &quot;continuous revolution&quot; that, theoretically, would serve the interests of the majority, rather than a tiny and privileged elite.

The Cultural Revolution led to the destruction of much of China&#x27;s traditional cultural heritage and the imprisonment of many Chinese citizens, as well as the creation of chaos in the country. Millions of lives were ruined, as the Cultural Revolution pierced into Chinese life. It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of people, perhaps millions, perished in the violence of the Cultural Revolution. This included prominent figures such as Liu Shaoqi.

It was during this period that Mao chose Lin Biao to become his successor. Lin was later officially named as Mao&#x27;s successor. By 1971, a divide between the two men had become apparent. Lin Biao died on 13 September 1971, in a plane crash over the air space of Mongolia, presumably as he fled China, probably anticipating his arrest. The CCP declared that Lin was planning to depose Mao and posthumously expelled Lin from the party. At this time, Mao lost trust in many of the top CCP figures. The highest-ranking Soviet Bloc intelligence defector, Lt. Gen. Ion Mihai Pacepa claimed he had a conversation with Nicolae Ceaușescu, who told him about a plot to kill Mao with the help of Lin Biao organised by the KGB.

In 1969, Mao declared the Cultural Revolution to be over. Various historians mark the end of the Cultural Revolution in 1976, following Mao&#x27;s death and the arrest of the Gang of Four. The Central Committee in 1981 officially declared the Cultural Revolution a &quot;severe setback&quot; for the PRC.

An estimate of around 400,000 deaths is a widely accepted minimum figure, according to Maurice Meisner. MacFarquhar and Schoenhals assert that in rural China alone some 36 million people were persecuted, of whom between 750,000 and 1.5 million were killed, with roughly the same number permanently injured.

== State visits ==
During his leadership, Mao traveled outside China on two occasions, both times for state visits to the Soviet Union. In his first visit on 16 December 1949, Mao traveled to celebrate the 70th birthday of Joseph Stalin in Moscow, an event that was also attended by East German deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers Walter Ulbricht and Mongolian general secretary Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal. Mao&#x27;s second visit took place between 2 and 19 November 1957; highlights included his attendance at the 40th anniversary (Ruby Jubilee) celebrations of the October Revolution (he attended the annual military parade of the Moscow Garrison on Red Square as well as a banquet in the Kremlin) and the International Meeting of Communist and Workers Parties, where he met with other communist leaders.

== Death and aftermath ==

Mao&#x27;s health declined in his final years, probably aggravated by his chain-smoking. It became a state secret that he suffered from multiple lung and heart ailments during his later years. There are unconfirmed reports that he possibly had Parkinson&#x27;s disease in addition to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig&#x27;s disease. He suffered two major heart attacks, one in March and another in late June, then a third on 2 September, rendering him an invalid. He died nearly one week later, on 9 September 1976, at the age of 82. The Communist Party delayed the announcement of his death until 16:00, when a national radio broadcast announced the news and appealed for party unity.

Mao&#x27;s embalmed body, draped in the CCP flag, lay in state at the Great Hall of the People for one week. One million Chinese filed past to pay their final respects, many displaying sadness, while foreigners watched on television. Mao&#x27;s official portrait hung on the wall with a banner reading: &quot;Carry on the cause left by Chairman Mao and carry on the cause of proletarian revolution to the end&quot;. On 17 September, the body was taken in a minibus to the 305 Hospital, where his internal organs were preserved in formaldehyde.

On 18 September, guns, sirens, whistles and horns across China were simultaneously blown and a mandatory three-minute silence was observed. Tiananmen Square was packed with millions of people and a military band played &quot;The Internationale&quot;. Hua Guofeng concluded the service with a 20-minute-long eulogy atop Tiananmen Gate. Despite Mao&#x27;s request to be cremated, his body was later permanently put on display in the Mausoleum of Mao Zedong, in order for the Chinese nation to pay its respects.

On 27 June 1981, the communist party&#x27;s Central Committee adopted the &quot;Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party since the Founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China,&quot; which assessed the legacy of the Mao era and the party&#x27;s priorities going forward. The &quot;Resolution&quot; describes setbacks during the period 1957 to 1964 (although it generally affirms this period) and major mistakes beginning in 1965, attributing Mao&#x27;s errors to individualist tendencies which arose when he departed from the collective view of the leadership. Regarding Mao&#x27;s legacy, the Resolution concludes Mao&#x27;s contributions to the Chinese Revolution far outweigh his mistakes.

== Legacy ==

Mao has been regarded as one of the most important and influential individuals in the 20th century. He has also been described as a political intellect, theorist, military strategist, poet, and visionary. He was credited and praised for driving imperialism out of China, having unified China and for ending the previous decades of civil war. He has also been credited with having improved the status of women in China and for improving literacy and education. In December 2013, a poll from the state-run &quot;Global Times&quot; indicated that roughly 85% of the 1,045 respondents surveyed felt that Mao&#x27;s achievements outweighed his mistakes. It has been said in China that Mao was 70 percent right and 30 percent wrong.

His policies resulted in the deaths of tens of millions of people in China during his reign, done through starvation, persecution, prison labour in &quot;laogai&quot;, and mass executions. Mao rarely gave direct instruction for peoples&#x27; physical elimination. According to Philip Short, the overwhelming majority of those killed by Mao&#x27;s policies were unintended casualties of famine, while the other three or four million, in Mao&#x27;s view, were necessary victims in the struggle to transform China. Mao&#x27;s China has been described as an autocratic and totalitarian regime responsible for mass repression. Mao was accused as one of the great tyrants of the twentieth century. He was frequently likened to the First Emperor of a unified China, Qin Shi Huang.

China&#x27;s population grew from around 550 million to over 900 million under his rule. Mao&#x27;s insurgency strategies continue to be used by insurgents, and his political ideology continues to be embraced by many Communist organisations around the world.
=== In China ===
In mainland China, Mao is respected by a great number of the general population. Mao is credited for raising the average life expectancy from 35 in 1949 to 63 by 1975, bringing &quot;unity and stability to a country that had been plagued by civil wars and foreign invasions&quot;, and laying the foundation for China to &quot;become the equal of the great global powers&quot;. He is lauded for carrying out massive land reform, promoting the status of women, improving popular literacy, and positively &quot;transform(ing) Chinese society beyond recognition.&quot; Mao has been credited for boosting literacy (only 20% of the population could read in 1949, compared to 65.5% thirty years later), doubling life expectancy, a near doubling of the population, and developing China&#x27;s industry and infrastructure, paving the way for its position as a world power.

Opposition to Mao can lead to censorship or professional repercussions in mainland China, and is often done in private settings. When a video of Bi Fujian, a television host, insulting Mao at a private dinner in 2015 went viral, Bi garnered the support of Weibo users, with 80% of them saying in a poll that Bi should not apologize amidst backlash from state affiliates. Chinese citizens are aware of Mao&#x27;s mistakes, but many see Mao as a national hero. He is seen as someone who successfully liberated the country from Japanese occupation and from Western imperialist exploitation dating back to the Opium Wars. Between 2015 and 2018, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; interviewed 70 people in China about the Maoist era. A &quot;sizable proportion&quot; lauded the era&#x27;s simplicity, attributing to it the &quot;clear meaning&quot; of life and minimal inequality; they contended that the &quot;spiritual life&quot; was rich. The interviewees simultaneously acknowledged the poor &quot;material life&quot; and other negative experiences under Mao.

On 25 December 2008, China opened the Mao Zedong Square to visitors in his home town of central Hunan Province to mark the 115th anniversary of his birth.

Former party official Su Shachi has opined that &quot;he was a great historical criminal, but he was also a great force for good.&quot; In a similar vein, journalist Liu Binyan has described Mao as &quot;both monster and a genius.&quot; Li Rui, Mao&#x27;s personal secretary and Communist Party comrade, opined that &quot;Mao&#x27;s way of thinking and governing was terrifying. He put no value on human life. The deaths of others meant nothing to him.&quot;

Chen Yun remarked &quot;Had Mao died in 1956, his achievements would have been immortal. Had he died in 1966, he would still have been a great man but flawed. But he died in 1976. Alas, what can one say?&quot; Deng Xiaoping said &quot;I should remind you that Chairman Mao dedicated most of his life to China, that he saved the party and the revolution in their most critical moments, that, in short, his contribution was so great that, without him, the Chinese people would have had a much harder time finding the right path out of the darkness. We also shouldn&#x27;t forget that it was Chairman Mao who combined the teachings of Marx and Lenin with the realities of Chinese history—that it was he who applied those principles, creatively, not only to politics but to philosophy, art, literature, and military strategy.&quot;

=== Outside China ===

Philip Short argued that the overwhelming majority of the deaths under Mao were unintended consequences of famine. Short stated that landlord class were not exterminated as a people due to Mao&#x27;s belief in redemption through thought reform, and compared Mao with 19th-century Chinese reformers who challenged China&#x27;s traditional beliefs in the era of China&#x27;s clashes with Western colonial powers. Short writes that &quot;Mao&#x27;s tragedy and his grandeur were that he remained to the end in thrall to his own revolutionary dreams. ... He freed China from the straitjacket of its Confucian past, but the bright Red future he promised turned out to be a sterile purgatory.&quot;

Alexander V. Pantsov and Steven I. Levine, in their biography, asserted that Mao was both &quot;a successful creator and ultimately an evil destroyer&quot; but also argued that he was a complicated figure who should not be lionised as a saint or reduced to a demon, as he &quot;indeed tried his best to bring about prosperity and gain international respect for his country.&quot; They also remarked on Mao&#x27;s legacy: &quot;A talented Chinese politician, an historian, a poet and philosopher, an all-powerful dictator and energetic organizer, a skillful diplomat and utopian socialist, the head of the most populous state, resting on his laurels, but at the same time an indefatigable revolutionary who sincerely attempted to refashion the way of life and consciousness of millions of people, a hero of national revolution and a bloody social reformer—this is how Mao goes down in history. The scale of his life was too grand to be reduced to a single meaning.&quot; Mao&#x27;s English interpreter Sidney Rittenberg wrote in his memoir that whilst Mao &quot;was a great leader in history&quot;, he was also &quot;a great criminal because, not that he wanted to, not that he intended to, but in fact, his wild fantasies led to the deaths of tens of millions of people.&quot;

The United States placed a trade embargo on the People&#x27;s Republic as a result of its involvement in the Korean War, until Richard Nixon decided that developing relations with the PRC would be useful. The television series &quot;Biography&quot; stated: &quot;[Mao] turned China from a feudal backwater into one of the most powerful countries in the World. ... The Chinese system he overthrew was backward and corrupt; few would argue the fact that he dragged China into the 20th century. But at a cost in human lives that is staggering.&quot; Professor Jeffrey Wasserstrom compares China&#x27;s relationship to Mao to Americans&#x27; remembrance of Andrew Jackson; both countries regard the leaders in a positive light, despite their respective roles in devastating policies. Jackson forcibly moved Native Americans through the Trail of Tears, resulting in thousands of deaths, while Mao was at the helm.

John King Fairbank remarked, &quot;The simple facts of Mao&#x27;s career seem incredible: in a vast land of 400 million people, at age 28, with a dozen others, to found a party and in the next fifty years to win power, organize, and remold the people and reshape the land—history records no greater achievement. Alexander, Caesar, Charlemagne, all the kings of Europe, Napoleon, Bismarck, Lenin—no predecessor can equal Mao Tse-tung&#x27;s scope of accomplishment, for no other country was ever so ancient and so big as China.&quot; In &quot;China: A New History&quot;, Fairbank and Goldman assessed Mao&#x27;s legacy: &quot;Future historians may conclude that Mao&#x27;s role was to try to destroy the age-old bifurcation of China between a small educated ruling stratum and the vast mass of common people. We do not yet know how far he succeeded. The economy was developing, but it was left to his successors to create a new political structure.&quot;

Stuart R. Schram said that Mao was an &quot;Eternal rebel, refusing to be bound by the laws of God or man, nature or Marxism, [who] led his people for three decades in pursuit of a vision initially noble, which turned increasingly into a mirage, and then into a nightmare. Was he a Faust or Prometheus, attempting the impossible for the sake of humanity, or a despot of unbridled ambition, drunk with his own power and his own cleverness?&quot; Schram also agreed &quot;with the current Chinese view that Mao&#x27;s merits outweighed his faults, but it is not easy to put a figure on the positive and negative aspects. How does one weigh, for example, the good fortune of hundreds of millions of peasants in getting land against the execution, in the course of land reform and the &#x27;Campaign against Counter-Revolutionaries,&#x27; or in other contexts, of millions, some of whom certainly deserved to die, but others of whom undoubtedly did not? How does one balance the achievements in economic development during the first Five-Year Plan, or during the whole twenty-seven years of Mao&#x27;s leadership after 1949, against the starvation which came in the wake of the misguided enthusiasm of the Great Leap Forward, or the bloody shambles of the Cultural Revolution?&quot; Schram added, &quot;In the last analysis, however, I am more interested in the potential future impact of his thought than in sending Mao as an individual to Heaven or to Hell.&quot;

Maurice Meisner assessed Mao&#x27;s legacy: &quot;It is the blots on the Maoist record, especially the Great Leap and the Cultural Revolution, that are now most deeply imprinted on our political and historical consciousness. That these adventures were failures colossal in scope, and that they took an enormous human toll, cannot and should not be forgotten. But future historians, without ignoring the failures and the crimes, will surely record the Maoist era in the history of the People&#x27;s Republic (however else they may judge it) as one of the great modernizing epochs in world history, and one that brought great social and human benefits to the Chinese people.&quot;

=== Third World ===

The ideology of Maoism has influenced many Communists, mainly in the Third World, including revolutionary movements such as Cambodia&#x27;s Khmer Rouge, Peru&#x27;s Shining Path, and the Nepalese revolutionary movement. Under the influence of Mao&#x27;s agrarian socialism and Cultural Revolution, Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge conceived of his disastrous Year Zero policies which purged the nation of its teachers, artists and intellectuals and emptied its cities, resulting in the Cambodian genocide. The Revolutionary Communist Party, USA, also claims Marxism–Leninism-Maoism as its ideology, as do other Communist Parties around the world which are part of the Revolutionary Internationalist Movement. China itself has moved sharply away from Maoism since Mao&#x27;s death, and most people outside of China who describe themselves as Maoist regard the Deng Xiaoping reforms to be a betrayal of Maoism, in line with Mao&#x27;s view of &quot;capitalist roaders&quot; within the Communist Party. As the Chinese government instituted market economic reforms starting in the late 1970s and as later Chinese leaders took power, less recognition was given to the status of Mao. This accompanied a decline in state recognition of Mao in later years in contrast to previous years when the state organised numerous events and seminars commemorating Mao&#x27;s 100th birthday. Nevertheless, the Chinese government has never officially repudiated the tactics of Mao. Deng Xiaoping, who was opposed to the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, stated that &quot;when we write about his mistakes we should not exaggerate, for otherwise we shall be discrediting Chairman Mao Zedong and this would mean discrediting our party and state.&quot;

The July 1963 Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty increased Chinese concerns over a US-Soviet re-alignment against China and prompted Mao&#x27;s articulation of the &quot;Two Intermediate Zones&quot; concept. Mao viewed Africa and Latin America as the &quot;First Intermediate Zone&quot;, in which China&#x27;s status as a non-white power might enable it to compete with and supersede both United States and Soviet Union influence. The other intermediate zone was the USA&#x27;s wealthier allies in Europe.

=== Military strategy ===
Mao&#x27;s military writings continue to have a large amount of influence both among those who seek to create an insurgency and those who seek to crush one, especially in manners of guerrilla warfare, at which Mao is popularly regarded as a genius. The Nepali Maoists were highly influenced by Mao&#x27;s views on protracted war, new democracy, support of masses, permanency of revolution and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Mao&#x27;s major contribution to the military science is his theory of People&#x27;s War, with not only guerrilla warfare but more importantly, Mobile Warfare methodologies. Mao had successfully applied Mobile Warfare in the Korean War, and was able to encircle, push back and then halt the UN forces in Korea, despite the clear superiority of UN firepower.

=== Literature ===
Mao&#x27;s poems and writings are frequently cited by both Chinese and non-Chinese. The official Chinese translation of President Barack Obama&#x27;s inauguration speech used a famous line from one of Mao&#x27;s poems. In the mid-1990s, Mao&#x27;s picture began to appear on all new renminbi currency from the People&#x27;s Republic of China. This was officially instituted as an anti-counterfeiting measure as Mao&#x27;s face is widely recognised in contrast to the generic figures that appear in older currency. On 13 March 2006, the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; reported that a member of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference proposed to include the portraits of Sun Yat-sen and Deng Xiaoping in the renminbi.

=== Public image ===
Mao gave contradicting statements on the subject of personality cults. In 1956, as a response to the Khrushchev Report that criticised Joseph Stalin, Mao stated that personality cults are &quot;poisonous ideological survivals of the old society&quot;, and reaffirmed China&#x27;s commitment to collective leadership. At the 1958 party congress in Chengdu, Mao expressed support for the personality cults of people whom he labelled as genuinely worthy figures, not those that expressed &quot;blind worship&quot;.

In 1962, Mao proposed the Socialist Education Movement (SEM) in an attempt to educate the peasants to resist the &quot;temptations&quot; of feudalism and the sprouts of capitalism that he saw re-emerging in the countryside from Liu&#x27;s economic reforms. Large quantities of politicised art were produced and circulated—with Mao at the centre. Numerous posters, badges, and musical compositions referenced Mao in the phrase &quot;Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts&quot; () and a &quot;Savior of the people&quot; ().

In October 1966, Mao&#x27;s &quot;Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung&quot;, known as the &quot;Little Red Book&quot;, was published. Party members were encouraged to carry a copy with them, and possession was almost mandatory as a criterion for membership. According to &quot;&quot; by Jun Yang, the mass publication and sale of this text contributed to making Mao the only millionaire created in 1950s China (332). Over the years, Mao&#x27;s image became displayed almost everywhere, present in homes, offices and shops. His quotations were typographically emphasised by putting them in boldface or red type in even the most obscure writings. Music from the period emphasised Mao&#x27;s stature, as did children&#x27;s rhymes. The phrase &quot;Long Live Chairman Mao for ten thousand years&quot; was commonly heard during the era.

Mao also has a presence in China and around the world in popular culture, where his face adorns everything from T-shirts to coffee cups. Mao&#x27;s granddaughter, Kong Dongmei, defended the phenomenon, stating that &quot;it shows his influence, that he exists in people&#x27;s consciousness and has influenced several generations of Chinese people&#x27;s way of life. Just like Che Guevara&#x27;s image, his has become a symbol of revolutionary culture.&quot; Since 1950, over 40 million people have visited Mao&#x27;s birthplace in Shaoshan, Hunan.

A 2016 survey by YouGov survey found that 42% of American millennials have never heard of Mao. According to the CIS poll, in 2019 only 21% of Australian millennials were familiar with Mao Zedong. In 2020s China, members of Generation Z are embracing Mao&#x27;s revolutionary ideas, including violence against the capitalist class, amid rising social inequality, long working hours, and decreasing economic opportunities. As of the early 2020s, surveys conducted on Zhihu frequently rank Mao as one of the greatest and most influential figures in Chinese history.

== Genealogy ==

=== Ancestors ===
Mao&#x27;s ancestors were:
* (, born Xiangtan 1870, died Shaoshan 1920), father, courtesy name () or also known as Mao Jen-sheng
* (, born Xiangxiang 1867, died 1919), mother. She was illiterate and a devout Buddhist. She was a descendant of Wen Tianxiang.
* (, born 1846, died 1904), paternal grandfather
* (, given name not recorded, born 1847, died 1884), paternal grandmother
* (), paternal great-grandfather

=== Wives ===
Mao had four wives who gave birth to a total of 10 children, among them:
# Luo Yixiu (1889–1910) of Shaoshan: married 1907 to 1910
# Yang Kaihui (1901–1930) of Changsha: married 1921 to 1927, executed by the KMT in 1930; mother to Mao Anying, Mao Anqing, and Mao Anlong
# He Zizhen (1910–1984) of Jiangxi: married May 1928 to 1937; mother to 6 children
# Jiang Qing (1914–1991), married 1939 until Mao&#x27;s death; mother to Li Na

=== Siblings ===
Mao had several siblings:
* Mao Zemin (1896–1943), younger brother, executed by a warlord
* Mao Zetan (1905–1935), younger brother, executed by the KMT
* Mao Zejian (1905–1929), adopted sister, executed by the KMT

Mao&#x27;s parents altogether had five sons and two daughters. Two of the sons and both daughters died young, leaving the three brothers Mao Zedong, Mao Zemin, and Mao Zetan. Like all three of Mao Zedong&#x27;s wives, Mao Zemin and Mao Zetan were communists. Like Yang Kaihui, both Mao Zemin and Mao Zetan were killed in warfare during Mao Zedong&#x27;s lifetime. Note that the character &quot;zé&quot; () appears in all of the siblings&#x27; given names; this is a common Chinese naming convention.

From the next generation, Mao Zemin&#x27;s son Mao Yuanxin was raised by Mao Zedong&#x27;s family, and he became Mao Zedong&#x27;s liaison with the Politburo in 1975. In Li Zhisui&#x27;s &quot;The Private Life of Chairman Mao&quot;, Mao Yuanxin played a role in the final power-struggles.

=== Children ===
Mao had a total of ten children, including:
* Mao Anying (1922–1950): son to Yang, married to (), killed in action during the Korean War
* Mao Anqing (1923–2007): son to Yang, married to Shao Hua, son Mao Xinyu, grandson Mao Dongdong
* Mao Anlong (1927–1931): son to Yang, died during the Chinese Civil War
* Mao Anhong: son to He, left to Mao&#x27;s younger brother Zetan and then to one of Zetan&#x27;s guards when he went off to war, was never heard of again
* Li Min (b. 1936): daughter to He, married to (), son (), daughter Kong Dongmei ()
* Li Na (b. 1940): daughter to Jiang (whose birth surname was Lǐ, a name also used by Mao while evading the KMT), married to (), son ()

Mao&#x27;s first and second daughters were left to local villagers because it was too dangerous to raise them while fighting the Kuomintang and later the Japanese. Their youngest daughter (born in early 1938 in Moscow after Mao separated) and one other child (born 1933) died in infancy. Two English researchers who retraced the entire Long March route in 2002–2003 located a woman whom they believe might well be one of the missing children abandoned by Mao to peasants in 1935. Ed Jocelyn and Andrew McEwen hope a member of the Mao family will respond to requests for a DNA test.

Through his ten children, Mao became grandfather to twelve grandchildren, many of whom he never knew. He has many great-grandchildren alive today. One of his granddaughters is businesswoman Kong Dongmei, one of the richest people in China. His grandson Mao Xinyu is a general in the Chinese army. Both he and Kong have written books about their grandfather.

== Personal life ==
Mao&#x27;s private life was kept very secret at the time of his rule. After Mao&#x27;s death, Li Zhisui, his personal physician, published &quot;The Private Life of Chairman Mao&quot;, a memoir which mentions some aspects of Mao&#x27;s private life, such as chain-smoking cigarettes, addiction to powerful sleeping pills and large number of sexual partners. Some scholars and others who knew Mao personally have disputed the accuracy of these accounts and characterisations.

Having grown up in Hunan, Mao spoke Mandarin with a marked Hunanese accent. Ross Terrill wrote Mao was a &quot;son of the soil ... rural and unsophisticated&quot; in origins, while Clare Hollingworth said that Mao was proud of his &quot;peasant ways and manners&quot;, having a strong Hunanese accent and providing &quot;earthy&quot; comments on sexual matters. Lee Feigon said that Mao&#x27;s &quot;earthiness&quot; meant that he remained connected to &quot;everyday Chinese life.&quot;

Sinologist Stuart R. Schram emphasised Mao&#x27;s ruthlessness but also noted that he showed no sign of taking pleasure in torture or killing in the revolutionary cause. Lee Feigon considered Mao &quot;draconian and authoritarian&quot; when threatened but opined that he was not the &quot;kind of villain that his mentor Stalin was&quot;. Alexander Pantsov and Steven I. Levine wrote that Mao was a &quot;man of complex moods&quot;, who &quot;tried his best to bring about prosperity and gain international respect&quot; for China, being &quot;neither a saint nor a demon.&quot; They noted that in early life, he strove to be &quot;a strong, wilful, and purposeful hero, not bound by any moral chains&quot;, and that he &quot;passionately desired fame and power&quot;.

Mao learned to speak some English, particularly through Zhang Hanzhi, his English teacher, interpreter and diplomat who later married Qiao Guanhua, Minister of Foreign Affairs and the head of China&#x27;s UN delegation. His spoken English was limited to a few single words, phrases, and some short sentences. He first chose to systematically learn English in the 1950s, which was very unusual as the main foreign language first taught in Chinese schools at that time was Russian.

== Writings and calligraphy ==
Mao was a prolific writer of political and philosophical literature. The main repository of his pre-1949 writings is the Selected Works of Mao Zedong. A fifth volume, which brought the timeline up to 1957, was briefly issued, but subsequently withdrawn from circulation for its perceived ideological errors. There has never been an official &quot;Complete Works of Mao Zedong&quot;. Mao is the attributed author of &quot;Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung&quot;, known in the West as the &quot;Little Red Book&quot; and in Cultural Revolution China as the &quot;Red Treasure Book&quot; (). First published in January 1964, this is a collection of short extracts from his many speeches and articles (most found in the Selected Works), edited by Lin Biao, and ordered topically. &quot;The Little Red Book&quot; contains some of Mao&#x27;s most widely known quotes.

Mao wrote prolifically on political strategy, commentary, and philosophy both before and after he assumed power. Mao was also a skilled Chinese calligrapher with a highly personal style. His calligraphy can be seen today throughout mainland China. His work gave rise to a new form of Chinese calligraphy called &quot;Mao-style&quot; or &quot;Maoti&quot;, which has gained increasing popularity since his death. There exist various competitions specialising in Mao-style calligraphy.

=== Literary works ===

Mao&#x27;s education began with Chinese classical literature. Mao told Edgar Snow in 1936 that he had started the study of the Confucian Analects and the Four Books at a village school when he was eight, but that the books he most enjoyed reading were &quot;Water Margin&quot;, &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, the &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; and &quot;Dream of the Red Chamber&quot;. Mao published poems in classical forms starting in his youth and his abilities as a poet contributed to his image in China after he came to power in 1949. His style was influenced by the great Tang dynasty poets Li Bai and Li He.

Some of his best known poems are &quot;Changsha&quot; (1925), &quot;The Double Ninth&quot; (October 1929), &quot;Loushan Pass&quot; (1935), &quot;The Long March&quot; (1935), &quot;Snow&quot; (February 1936), &quot;The PLA Captures Nanjing&quot; (1949), &quot;Reply to Li Shuyi&quot; (11 May 1957), and &quot;Ode to the Plum Blossom&quot; (December 1961).

==Portrayal in media==
Mao has been portrayed in film and television numerous times. Some notable actors include: Han Shi, the first actor ever to have portrayed Mao, in a 1978 drama &quot;Dielianhua&quot; and later again in a 1980 film &quot;Cross the Dadu River&quot;; Gu Yue, who had portrayed Mao 84 times on screen throughout his 27-year career and had won the Best Actor title at the Hundred Flowers Awards in 1990 and 1993; Liu Ye, who played a young Mao in &quot;The Founding of a Party&quot; (2011); Tang Guoqiang, who has frequently portrayed Mao in more recent times, in the films &quot;The Long March&quot; (1996) and &quot;The Founding of a Republic&quot; (2009), and the television series &quot;Huang Yanpei&quot; (2010), among others. Mao is a principal character in American composer John Adams&#x27; opera &quot;Nixon in China&quot; (1987). The Beatles&#x27; song &quot;Revolution&quot; refers to Mao in the verse &quot;but if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao you ain&#x27;t going to make it with anyone anyhow...&quot;; John Lennon expressed regret over including these lines in the song in 1972.
