<text>Motörhead () were an English rock band formed in London in 1975 by bassist and lead vocalist Lemmy Kilmister, guitarist Larry Wallis and drummer Lucas Fox. Lemmy was also the primary songwriter and only constant member. The band are often considered a precursor to the new wave of British heavy metal, which re-energised heavy metal in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Though several guitarists and drummers have played in Motörhead, most of their best-selling albums and singles feature drummer Phil &quot;Philthy Animal&quot; Taylor and guitarist &quot;Fast&quot; Eddie Clarke. From 1995 until the band&#x27;s break-up in 2015, the group consisted of Lemmy, guitarist Phil Campbell and drummer Mikkey Dee.

Motörhead released 23 studio albums, 10 live recordings, 12 compilation albums and five EPs over a career spanning 40 years. Usually a power trio, they had particular success in the early 1980s with several successful singles in the UK Top 40 chart. The albums &quot;Overkill&quot;, &quot;Bomber&quot;, &quot;Ace of Spades&quot; and, particularly, the live album &quot;No Sleep &#x27;til Hammersmith&quot; cemented Motörhead&#x27;s reputation as a top-tier rock band. The band are ranked number 26 on VH1&#x27;s 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. By 2025, the band has sold more than 25 million albums worldwide.

Most often classified as heavy metal, Motörhead has been credited with being part of and influencing numerous musical scenes, thrash metal and speed metal especially. Lemmy, however, always insisted that they were a rock and roll band. He said they had more in common with punk bands, but with their own unique sound, Motörhead is embraced in both punk and metal scenes. Their lyrics typically covered such topics as war, good and evil, abuse of power, promiscuity, substance abuse and, most famously, gambling, the last theme being the focus of their hit song &quot;Ace of Spades&quot;.

Lemmy died on 28 December 2015 from cardiac arrhythmia and congestive heart failure, after being diagnosed with prostate cancer. The day after his death, longtime members Dee and Campbell both confirmed that Motörhead had disbanded. By 2018, all three members of Motörhead&#x27;s best-known line-up (Lemmy, Taylor and Clarke) had died.

==History==
===1975–1977: Formation and early years===

Lemmy was dismissed from Hawkwind in May 1975 after being arrested in Canada for drug possession; he said &quot;the band dismissed me for doing the wrong drugs&quot;. Now on his own, Lemmy decided to form a new band called Motörhead, the name was inspired by the final song he had written for Hawkwind.

Lemmy wanted the music to be &quot;fast and vicious, just like the MC5&quot;. His stated aim was to &quot;concentrate on very basic music: loud, fast, city, raucous, arrogant, paranoid, speedfreak rock n roll ... it will be so loud that if we move in next door to you, your lawn will die&quot;. He recruited guitarist Larry Wallis (formerly of Pink Fairies) on the recommendation of Mick Farren, based on Wallis&#x27; work with Steve Peregrin Took&#x27;s band Shagrat, and Lucas Fox on drums. According to Lemmy, the band&#x27;s first practice was at the now defunct Sound Management rehearsal studios, in Kings Road, Chelsea in 1975. Sound Management leased the basement area of furniture store The Furniture Cave, located in adjacent Lots Road. Kilmister has said they used to steal equipment, as the band was short on gear. Their first engagement was supporting Greenslade at The Roundhouse, London on 20 July 1975. On 19 October, having played 10 gigs, they became the supporting act to Blue Öyster Cult at the Hammersmith Odeon.

The band were contracted to United Artists by Andrew Lauder, the A&amp;R man for Lemmy&#x27;s previous band, Hawkwind. They recorded sessions at Rockfield Studios in Monmouth with producer Dave Edmunds, during which Fox proved to be unreliable and was replaced by drummer Phil &quot;Philthy Animal&quot; Taylor, a casual acquaintance of Lemmy&#x27;s. Their record label was dissatisfied with the material and refused to release it, although it was subsequently issued as &quot;On Parole&quot; in 1979 after the band had established some success.

In March 1976, deciding that two guitarists were required, the band auditioned an acquaintance of drummer Taylor&#x27;s named &quot;Fast&quot; Eddie Clarke. Wallis, who was continuing to tour with a reformed Pink Fairies, quit immediately after the auditions and Clarke remained as the sole guitarist. This trio of Lemmy/Clarke/Taylor is today regarded as the &quot;classic&quot; Motörhead line-up. In December, the band recorded the Holland–Dozier–Holland composition &quot;Leaving Here&quot; for early punk rock and pub rock label, Stiff Records, but United Artists intervened to prevent its general release as the band were still under contract to them, despite the label&#x27;s refusal to issue their debut album. Initial reactions to the band had been unfavourable; they won a poll for &quot;the best worst band in the world&quot; in the music magazine &quot;NME&quot;.

By April 1977, living in squats and with little recognition, Taylor and Clarke decided to quit the band, and after some debate, they agreed to do a farewell show at the Marquee Club in London. Lemmy had become acquainted with Ted Carroll from Chiswick Records and asked him to bring a mobile studio to the show to record it for posterity. Carroll was unable to get the mobile unit to the Marquee Club on 1 April 1977, but showed up backstage after the engagement and offered them two days at Escape Studios with producer Speedy Keen to record a single. The band took the chance, and instead of recording a single they laid down 11 unfinished tracks. Carroll gave them a few more days at Olympic Studios to finish the vocals and the band completed 13 tracks for release as an album. Chiswick issued the single &quot;Motorhead&quot; in June, followed by the album &quot;Motörhead&quot; in August, which spent one week in the UK Albums Chart at number 43. The band toured the UK supporting Hawkwind in June, then from late July they commenced the &quot;Beyond the Threshold of Pain Tour&quot; with the Count Bishops, a band who were gaining some popularity on the early punk rock and pub rock scene.

In August, Tony Secunda took over the management of the band, and their cohesiveness became so unstable that by March 1978, Clarke and Taylor had formed and were performing as the Muggers with Speedy Keen and Billy Rath of American punk band The Heartbreakers.

===1978–1979: Rise to success: &quot;Overkill&quot; and &quot;Bomber&quot;===
In July 1978, the band returned to the management of Douglas Smith, who secured a one-off singles deal with Gerry Bron&#x27;s Bronze Records. The resulting &quot;Louie Louie&quot; single (a cover version of Richard Berry and The Kingsmen standard) was issued in September peaking at number 68 on the UK Singles Chart, and the band toured the UK to promote it, recorded a BBC Radio 1 &quot;John Peel in session&quot; on 18 September (these tracks were later issued on the 2005 &quot;BBC Live &amp; In-Session&quot; album), and appeared for the first time on BBC Television&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on 25 October. Pub rock and early Punk rock label Chiswick Records capitalised on this new level of success by re-issuing the debut album &quot;Motörhead&quot; on white vinyl through EMI Records.

The single&#x27;s success led to Bronze extending their contract, and put the band back into the studio to record an album, this time with producer Jimmy Miller at Roundhouse Studios. A hint of what the band had recorded for the album came on 9 March 1979 when the band played &quot;Overkill&quot; on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; to support the release of the single ahead of the &quot;Overkill&quot; album, which was released on 24 March. It became Motörhead&#x27;s first album to break into the top 40 of the UK Albums chart, reaching number 24, with the single reaching number 39 on the UK Singles Chart. These releases were followed by the &quot;Overkill&quot; UK tour which began on 23 March. A subsequent single was released in June, coupling the album track &quot;No Class&quot; as the A-side with the previously unreleased song &quot;Like a Nightmare&quot; on the B-side. It fared worse than both the album and previous single but reached number 61 on the UK singles chart.

During July and August, except for a break to appear at the Reading Festival, the band were working on their next album, &quot;Bomber&quot;. Released on 27 October, it reached number 12 on the UK Albums Chart. On 1 December, it was followed by the &quot;Bomber&quot; single, which reached number 34 on the UK Singles Chart. The &quot;Bomber&quot; Europe and UK tour followed, with support from Saxon. The stage show featured a spectacular aircraft bomber-shaped lighting rig. During the &quot;Bomber&quot; tour, United Artists put together tapes recorded during the Rockfield Studios sessions in 1975–1976 and released them as the album &quot;On Parole&quot;, which peaked at number 65 on the UK Albums Chart in December.

On 8 May 1980, while the band were on tour in Europe, Bronze released &quot;The Golden Years&quot;, which sold better than any of their previous releases, reaching number eight on the UK Singles Chart. The band had, however, preferred the title &quot;Flying Tonight&quot;, in reference to the &quot;Bomber&quot; lighting rig. On 20 August, the band had a 40-minute filmed slot, along with Girlschool&#x27;s 20 minutes performing live at the Nottingham Theatre Royal for the &quot;Rockstage&quot; programme, broadcast on UK television by the ATV on 4 April 1981.

===1980–1982: &quot;Ace of Spades&quot; and &quot;Iron Fist&quot;===
During August and September 1980, the band were at Jackson&#x27;s Studios in Rickmansworth, recording with producer Vic Maile. The &quot;Ace of Spades&quot; single was released on 27 October 1980 as a preview of the &quot;Ace of Spades&quot; album, which followed on 8 November. The single reached No. 15 and the album reached No. 4 on the UK charts, the latter being the highest position in the band&#x27;s history. Bronze celebrated its gold record status by pressing a limited edition of the album in gold vinyl.

Motörhead made an appearance on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; in November that year with &quot;Ace of Spades&quot;, and between 22 October and 29 November the band were on their &quot;Ace Up Your Sleeve&quot; UK tour with support from Girlschool and Vardis, and also made an appearance as guests on the ITV children&#x27;s show &quot;Tiswas&quot; on 8 November. The &quot;Arizona desert-style&quot; pictures used on the album sleeve and tour booklet cover were taken during a photo session at a sandpit in Barnet. &quot;Ace of Spades&quot;, considered to be the definitive Motörhead anthem, &quot;put a choke on the English music charts and proved to all that a band could succeed without sacrificing its blunt power and speed&quot;.

To coincide with the &quot;Ace of Spades&quot; release, Big Beat, who had inherited the Chiswick catalogue, put together four unused tracks from the Escape Studios sessions in 1977 and released them as &quot;Beer Drinkers and Hell Raisers&quot;, which reached No. 43 on the UK Singles Chart in November.

The band had more chart hits in 1981 with the releases &quot;St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre&quot; EP, their collaboration with Girlschool which reached No. 5 on the UK Singles Chart in February; the live version of &quot;Motorhead&quot;, which reached No. 6 on the UK Singles Chart in July; and the album it was taken from, &quot;No Sleep &#x27;til Hammersmith&quot;, which reached No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart in June. During March 1981, the band had been touring Europe, and in the final week of the month they conducted the &quot;Short Sharp, Pain in the Neck&quot; UK tour from which the recordings for &quot;No Sleep &#x27;til Hammersmith&quot; were made.

From April through to July, the band toured North America for the first time as guests of Blizzard of Ozz, an early incarnation of Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s band, but were still able to make an appearance on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on 9 July to promote the live &quot;Motorhead&quot; single. In October the band recorded tracks at BBC&#x27;s Maida Vale studio for the David Jensen show broadcast on 6 October. The band commenced a European tour on 20 November, supported by Tank,after which Clarke produced Tank&#x27;s debut album &quot;Filth Hounds of Hades&quot; at Ramport Studios in December and January.

Between 26 and 28 January 1982, the band started recording their self-produced new album at Ramport Studios, before moving onto Morgan Studios to continue the sessions throughout February. On 3 April the single &quot;Iron Fist&quot; was released, reaching No. 29 on the UK Singles Chart, followed by the parent album &quot;Iron Fist&quot;, released on 17 April and peaking at No. 6 on the UK Albums Chart. They were the last releases to feature the Lemmy, Clarke, Taylor line-up, though the line-up continued to perform in the &quot;Iron Fist&quot; UK tour between 17 March and 12 April, and the band&#x27;s first headlining North America tour from 12 May until Clarke&#x27;s last engagement at the New York Palladium on 14 May.

===1982–1985: Departures, &quot;Another Perfect Day&quot; and &quot;No Remorse&quot;===

Clarke left as a consequence of the band recording &quot;Stand By Your Man&quot;, a cover version of the Tammy Wynette classic, in collaboration with Wendy O. Williams and the Plasmatics. Clarke felt that the song compromised the band&#x27;s principles, refused to play on the recording and resigned, later forming his own band, Fastway. Lemmy and Taylor made numerous telephone calls to find a guitarist, including one to Brian Robertson, formerly with Thin Lizzy, who was recording a solo album in Canada. He agreed to help out and complete the tour with them. Robertson signed a one-album deal resulting in 1983&#x27;s &quot;Another Perfect Day&quot; and the two singles from it, &quot;Shine&quot; and &quot;I Got Mine&quot;.

In June and July the band played five dates in Japan, and from mid-October until mid-November they toured Europe. From late May until early July, the band conducted the &quot;Another Perfect Tour&quot;, followed by an American tour between July and August, and another European tour in October and November. Robertson began to cause friction in the band as a result of his on-stage attire, consisting of shorts and ballet shoes, and with his refusal to play old standards that Motörhead audiences expected to hear. Robertson left the band soon after their concert at the Berlin Metropol on 11 November 1983.

After Robertson&#x27;s departure, the band received tapes from guitarists from all over the world who wished to be considered for a place in Motörhead. The group returned to the concept of dual lead guitars by hiring unknowns Würzel and Phil Campbell (formerly of Persian Risk). In February 1984, the Lemmy, Campbell, Würzel, and Taylor line-up recorded &quot;Ace of Spades&quot; for the &quot;Bambi&quot; episode in the British television series, &quot;The Young Ones&quot;. Scenes of the band playing are interspersed with the characters&#x27; antics as they rush to the railway station, in a parody of the Beatles&#x27; comedy film &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;. Taylor quit the band after that recording, causing Lemmy to quip: &quot;Did I leave them or did they leave me?&quot;. Before joining Motörhead, Phil Campbell had met former Saxon drummer Pete Gill, and the trio decided to call him to see if he would like to visit London. The try-outs went well and Gill was hired.

Bronze Records thought the new line-up would not make the grade and decided to &quot;nail down the lid&quot; on the group with a compilation album. When Lemmy found out, he took over the project, selecting tracks, providing sleeve notes and insisted that Motörhead record four brand new tracks to go at the end of each side of the album. During the sessions between 19 and 25 May 1984 at Britannia Row Studios, London, the band recorded six tracks for the single&#x27;s B-side and the album. The single &quot;Killed by Death&quot; was released on 1 September and reached No. 51 in the UK Singles Chart, the double album &quot;No Remorse&quot; was released on 15 September and reached silver disc status, attaining the position of No. 14 in the UK Album charts.

The band were involved in a court case with Bronze over the next two years, believing that their releases were not being promoted properly, and the record company banned them from the recording studio. The band looked to more touring for income; Australia and New Zealand in late July to late August, a brief tour of Hungary in September, and the &quot;No Remorse&quot; &quot;Death on the Road&quot; tour between 24 October and 7 November. They kicked off their tour in the UK by making a live appearance on the early morning children&#x27;s TV show &quot;The Saturday Starship&quot;. Their set, which included &quot;Iron Fist&quot;, &quot;Ace of Spades&quot;, and &quot;Overkill&quot;, was performed in the car park of the Central TV studios, Birmingham, prompting complaints about the noise from local residents.
On 26 October the band made a live appearance on the British Channel 4 music programme &quot;The Tube&quot;, performing &quot;Killed By Death&quot;, &quot;Steal Your Face&quot; (over which the programme&#x27;s end-credits were played) and the unbroadcast &quot;Overkill&quot;, before going on to their next engagement that evening. From 19 November to 15 December the band toured America with Canadian speed metal band Exciter and Danish heavy metal band Mercyful Fate and from 26 to 30 December performed five shows in West Germany.

On 5 April 1985, ITV broadcast four songs that were recorded after the band went off air on their earlier appearance on &quot;The Tube&quot; programme. A week later the band, dressed in tuxedos, played four songs on the live Channel 4 music show &quot;ECT&quot; (Extra-Celestial Transmission). To celebrate the band&#x27;s 10th anniversary, two shows were arranged at Hammersmith Odeon on 28 and 29 June, a video of the second show was taken and later released as &quot;The Birthday Party&quot;. From early June until early August the band were on their &#x27;It Never Gets Dark&#x27; tour of Sweden and Norway, an American tour followed in mid-November until late December.

===1986–1989: &quot;Orgasmatron&quot; and &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;===
From 26 March to 3 April 1986, the band toured West Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark on their &quot;Easter Metal Blast&quot; and in June, played two dates in Bologna and Milan in Italy. The court case with Bronze was finally settled in the band&#x27;s favour. The band&#x27;s management instigated their own label, GWR. Recording took place in Master Rock Studios, London and the single &quot;Deaf Forever&quot; was released on 5 July as a taster for the &quot;Orgasmatron&quot; album, which was released on 9 August. On the same day as the release of the album, Lemmy and Würzel were interviewed by Andy Kershaw on the BBC Radio 1 &quot;Saturday Live&quot; show and &quot;Orgasmatron&quot; and &quot;Deaf Forever&quot; were played. The single reached No. 67 and the album reached No. 21 in the UK charts.

On 16 August, the band played at the Monsters of Rock at Castle Donington and was recorded by BBC Radio 1 for a future &quot;Friday Rock Show&quot; broadcast. The performance closed with a flypast by a couple of Second World War German aircraft. Also that day Lemmy was filmed giving his views on spoof metal act &quot;Bad News&quot; for inclusion in a Peter Richardson Comic Strip film entitled &quot;More Bad News&quot; since the band featuring Rik Mayall, Peter Richardson, Nigel Planer and Adrian Edmondson were also performing at Donington. In September the band conducted their &quot;Orgasmatron&quot; tour in Great Britain, supported by fledgling act Zodiac Mindwarp and the Love Reaction. In October they toured America and in December were in West Germany.

In 1987, during the filming of &quot;Eat the Rich&quot; – in which Lemmy was taking a starring role alongside well-known comedy actors such as Robbie Coltrane, Kathy Burke, the regulars from the Comic Strip ensemble, and various other musician cameo appearances – Gill left the band and Taylor returned to appear in the band&#x27;s cameo as &quot;In House Club Band&quot; alongside Würzel and Campbell. The band wrote &quot;Eat the Rich&quot; especially for the film, its soundtrack featured tracks from &quot;Orgasmatron&quot; and Würzel&#x27;s solo single &quot;Bess&quot;. The band&#x27;s second album for GWR was &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, released on 5 September, after a tight work schedule in the studio. While having some popular tracks and using &quot;Eat the Rich&quot; as its second track, the band commented that the album was virtually &quot;nailed together&quot;.

On 2 July 1988 Motörhead were one of the performers at the Giants of Rock Festival in Hämeenlinna, Finland. The tracks were released as &quot;No Sleep at All&quot; on 15 October. A single from the album was planned with the band wanting &quot;Traitor&quot; as the A-side, but &quot;Ace of Spades&quot; was chosen instead. When the band noticed the change, they refused to allow the single to be distributed to the shops, and it was withdrawn and became available only on the &quot;No Sleep at All&quot; tour and through the &quot;Motörheadbangers&quot; fan club. While they continued to play live shows during 1989 and 1990, Motörhead once again felt unhappy with their career, and a court case with GWR followed, which was not resolved until mid-1990.

===1990–1992: Epic/WTG years: &quot;1916&quot; and &quot;March ör Die&quot;===
With the court case resolved, Motörhead signed to Epic/WTG and spent the last half of 1990 recording a new album and single in Los Angeles. Just prior to the album sessions the band&#x27;s former manager, Doug Smith, released the recording of the band&#x27;s 10th anniversary show, much against the bands wishes, having previously told him that they did not want it released, in 1986. In the studio they recorded four songs with producer Ed Stasium, before deciding he had to go.

When Lemmy listened to one of the mixes of &quot;Going to Brazil&quot;, he asked for him to turn up four tracks, and on doing so heard claves and tambourines that Stasium had added without their knowledge. Stasium was fired and Peter Solley was hired as producer. The story according to Stasium was that Lemmy&#x27;s drug and alcohol intake had far exceeded the limitations of Stasium&#x27;s patience so he quit. The single &quot;The One to Sing the Blues&quot; issued on 24 December 1990 (7&quot; and CD) and 5 January 1991 (12&quot;), was followed by the album &quot;1916&quot; on 21 January. The single, which was issued in 7&quot;, cassette, shaped picture disc, 12&quot; and CD single, reached No. 45 in the UK Singles Chart, the album reached No. 24 in the UK Album Charts.

The band conducted their &quot;It Serves You Right&quot; tour of Britain in February, the &quot;Lights Out Over Europe&quot; tour followed, lasting until early April, when the band returned to Britain to play another six venues. In June the band played five dates in Japan and five dates in Australia and New Zealand. Between July and August, they played across the United States with Judas Priest, Alice Cooper, Metal Church and opener Dangerous Toys on the &quot;Operation Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; tour. The band finished the year with six dates in Germany during December.

On 28 March 1992, the band played what would turn out to be Taylor&#x27;s last engagement at Irvine Meadows, Irvine, California. The band had been wanting Lemmy to get rid of their manager, Doug Banker, for some time and after an unsolicited visit from Todd Singerman, who insisted he should manage them despite never having managed a band before, the band met with Singerman and decided to take him on board, firing Banker. In the midst of this, the band were recording an album at Music Grinder Studios, in the city&#x27;s east part of Hollywood during the 1992 Los Angeles riots. Three drummers participated in the making of the &quot;March ör Die&quot; album: Phil Taylor, who was fired because he did not learn the drum tracks on the song &quot;I Ain&#x27;t No Nice Guy&quot;; Tommy Aldridge who recorded most of the material on the album; and Mikkey Dee, who recorded &quot;Hellraiser&quot;, a song originally written by Lemmy for Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s &quot;No More Tears&quot; album. &quot;March ör Die&quot; features guest appearances by Ozzy Osbourne and Slash.

===1993–1997: &quot;Bastards&quot;, &quot;Sacrifice&quot;, and &quot;Overnight Sensation&quot;===
Lemmy had known Mikkey Dee from the time when King Diamond had toured with Motörhead. He had asked Dee to become Motörhead&#x27;s drummer before, but Dee had declined due to his commitment to King Diamond. On this occasion, Dee was available and met the band to try out. Playing the song &quot;Hellraiser&quot; first, Lemmy thought &quot;he was very good immediately. It was obvious that it was going to work.&quot; After recording &quot;Hellraiser&quot; and &quot;Hell on Earth&quot; in the studio, Dee&#x27;s first engagement with Motörhead was on 30 August at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center. The new line-up then went on tour, playing dates with Ozzy Osbourne, Skew Siskin and Exodus. On 27 September, the band played at the Los Angeles Coliseum with Metallica and Guns N&#x27; Roses. The band toured Argentina and Brazil during October and conducted the &quot;Bombers and Eagles in &#x27;92&quot; tour of Europe with Saxon throughout December.

Motörhead played two dates at the Arena Obras Sanitarias in Buenos Aires in April 1993 and toured Europe from early June until early July, returning to the United States to play one show at the New York Ritz on 14 August. A new producer was sought for the band&#x27;s next album and eventually Howard Benson, who was to produce the band&#x27;s next four albums, was chosen. The band recorded at A&amp;M Studios and Prime Time Studios in Hollywood and the resultant album, titled &quot;Bastards&quot;, was released on 29 November 1993. The single &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Daddy Kiss Me&quot; included the song &quot;Born to Raise Hell&quot;, which also appeared on the album and would later be re-recorded with collaborative vocals from both Ice-T and Ugly Kid Joe frontman Whitfield Crane for the soundtrack of the movie &quot;Airheads&quot; (in which Lemmy also made a cameo appearance) and released as a single in its own right. Although &quot;Bastards&quot; received airtime, the record company ZYX Music would not pay for promotional copies, so the band sent out copies themselves. A further tour of Europe was made throughout December that year.

In February and March 1994, Motörhead toured the United States with Black Sabbath and Morbid Angel. In April the band resumed their tour of the States until early May, playing an engagement with the Ramones on 14 May at the Estadio Velez in Buenos Aires, attracting a crowd of 50,000 people. The band toured Japan in late May and Europe in June, August and December.

The band&#x27;s 1995 touring schedule began in Europe in late April. In June, they went on a second tour with Black Sabbath, this time supported by Tiamat, until the band succumbed to influenza and headed back to Los Angeles and Cherokee Studios in Hollywood where they were to record an album. During the sessions it became clear that Würzel was not extending himself and left the band after the recording. The title track from the album, &quot;Sacrifice&quot;, was later used in the movie &quot;Tromeo and Juliet&quot;, a film in which Lemmy appears as the narrator. The band decided to continue as a three-man line-up and a tour of Europe was performed throughout October and the first two days of November. A three-day tour of South America followed the week after. Lemmy celebrated his 50th Birthday later that year with the band at the Whisky a Go Go in Los Angeles; Metallica played at the event under the name the Lemmy&#x27;s.

In 1996, the band began touring the States in early January and played 30 venues up to 15 February; a seven-date tour of Europe in June and July was followed by two engagements in South America during August. A tour of the United States with Belladonna and Speedball began with two shows (Los Angeles &amp; Hollywood) in early October 1996 and concluded in Washington on 4 December. During this time the band had recorded &quot;Overnight Sensation&quot;, at Ocean Studio and Track House Recording Studio. The album was released on 15 October, the first official album of the band as a three-piece since &quot;Another Perfect Day&quot; and the best distributed album the band had had for years. The band concluded the year&#x27;s touring with 13 dates in Germany.

During 1997, the band toured extensively, beginning with the first leg of the &quot;Overnight Sensation&quot; tour in Europe on 12 January at the London Astoria, where the guest musicians were Todd Campbell, Phil Campbell&#x27;s son, on &quot;Ace of Spades&quot; and &quot;Fast&quot; Eddie Clarke for &quot;Overkill&quot;. The European leg lasted until March and was followed by four dates in Japan, from late May to 1 June, and an American tour with W.A.S.P. throughout the rest of June. In August, three dates in Europe were followed by seven dates in Britain, which ended with a show at the Brixton Academy on 25 October, where the guest musician was Paul Inder, Lemmy&#x27;s son, for &quot;Ace of Spades&quot;. A further four dates in October in Russia concluded the year 1997.

===1998–2003: &quot;Snake Bite Love&quot;, &quot;We Are Motörhead&quot;, and &quot;Hammered&quot;===
Lemmy recalled that the touring was going particularly well, with some countries like Argentina and Japan putting the band in larger venues, and the English promoters discovered that &quot;they could turn a nice profit with Motörhead shows&quot;. In his opinion, the three-piece line-up was performing excellently and it was high time they made another live record. The band did eventually, but made another studio album first, &quot;Snake Bite Love&quot;, recorded in various studios and released on 3 March 1998.

The band joined with Judas Priest at the Los Angeles Universal Amphitheatre on 3 April, to begin their &quot;Snake Bite Love&quot; tour. On 21 May, Motörhead were recorded at The Docks in Hamburg. The tracks from this performance were later released as &quot;Everything Louder Than Everyone Else&quot;. The band were invited to join the Ozzfest Tour and played dates across the States during early July until early August and were in Europe from early October until late November. The British leg of the tour was dubbed the &quot;No Speak With Forked Tongue&quot; tour and included support bands Groop Dogdrill, Radiator and Psycho Squad, which was fronted by Phil Campbell&#x27;s son Todd.

In 1999 Motörhead made a tour of the states between 20 April and 2 June, before going to Karo Studios in Brackel, Germany to record their next album, &quot;We Are Motörhead&quot;, which was released in May the following year. During the time the album sessions took place, the band played at venues around Europe, the first of which was at Fila Forum in Assago, near Milan, where Metallica&#x27;s James Hetfield joined the band on-stage to play &quot;Overkill&quot;. In October and early November, the band toured the states with Nashville Pussy. Throughout the rest of November, the band conducted their European &quot;Monsters of the Millennium&quot; tour with Manowar, Dio and Lion&#x27;s Share, ending the Millennium with two shows at the London Astoria. The two shows were billed under the &quot;Kerrang!&quot; &quot;X-Fest&quot; banner and at the first show were supported by Backyard Babies and during the second show guest vocals were provided by Skin from Skunk Anansie and Nina C. Alice from Skew Siskin for &quot;Born to Raise Hell&quot;, and Ace from Skunk Anansie played &quot;Overkill&quot; with the band.

In May 2000, the release of &quot;We Are Motörhead&quot; and the single from it, a cover of the Sex Pistol&#x27;s &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;, coincided with the start of the band&#x27;s &quot;We Are Motörhead&quot; tour across South and North America during May and June, with a further nine shows across in Europe in July. Shows in the United States and France were followed by the release of a double-disc compilation album, &quot;The Best Of&quot;, on 26 August.

Four dates in Japan preceded the band&#x27;s 25th anniversary concert on 22 October at the Brixton Academy in London, where guest appearances were made by &quot;Fast&quot; Eddie Clarke, Brian May, Doro Pesch, Whitfield Crane, Ace, Paul Inder and Todd Campbell. The show also featured the return of the Bomber lighting rig. The event was filmed and released the following year as the &quot;25 &amp; Alive Boneshaker&quot; DVD, and the CD of the show, &quot;Live at Brixton Academy&quot;, was released two years after that. Lemmy states the reason for the DVD as wanting &quot;to record it for the posterity or whatever it is. I nodded off through the 10th anniversary, we never did anything on the 20th, so the 25th made sense.&quot;

A tour of West and East Europe followed the anniversary concert, taking the band through October, November and December. The schedule for the Eastern European tour was quite brutal, involving two 18-hour drives back-to-back and little time off, at the Warsaw venue the band did not arrive until 11 o&#x27;clock and the crew were still loading into the venue at one in the morning, while the fans waited.

After taking a month off, the band began working on a new album at Chuck Reid&#x27;s house in the Hollywood Hills. This album, &quot;Hammered&quot;, was released the following year. On 1 April 2001, the band gave a one-song performance for Triple H&#x27;s entrance at WrestleMania X-Seven at the Reliant Astrodome in Houston. The second leg of the &quot;We Are Motörhead&quot; tour began in May in Ireland, moving across to the United Kingdom. In Manchester, the band were supported by Goldblade, and by Pure Rubbish at the two London shows. The second London show also included Backyard Babies and Paul Inder, who was guest musician for &quot;Killed By Death&quot;. Between June and August, Motörhead played at a number of rock festivals in Europe; including as the Graspop Metal Meeting in Belgium, the Quart Festival in Norway, and the Wacken Open Air on 4 August, where four songs were recorded for the &quot;25 &amp; Alive Boneshaker&quot; DVD. The band returned to the States for a seven show tour between late September and early October.

In April 2002, a DVD of some of Motörhead&#x27;s performances from the 1970s and 1980s along with some stock footage of the band was released as &quot;The Best of Motörhead&quot;. Two weeks earlier, the &quot;Hammered&quot; album was released and supported by the &quot;Hammered&quot; tour, which kicked off in the States at around the same time. The United States dates continued until late May, and a European leg followed between June and August. In October, the band played five dates in Great Britain with Anthrax, Skew Siskin and Psycho Squad. The final venue was the Wembley Arena in London, where instead of Psycho Squad, the band were supported by Hawkwind, with Lemmy performing &quot;Silver Machine&quot; on stage with them. Throughout the rest of October and better part of November, the band were on a European tour with Anthrax.

In April and May 2003, the band continued to promote the &quot;Hammered&quot; album in the States, and on the three dates Phil Campbell had to miss, his mother having died, Todd Youth stood in for him. Between late May and mid-July the band played seven dates at Summer Festivals in Europe and from late-July until the end of August, they were touring the United States with Iron Maiden and Dio. On 7 October a comprehensive five-disc collection of the band&#x27;s recordings covering 1975–2002 was released as &quot;Stone Deaf Forever!&quot;. On 1 September 2003, the band returned to Hollywood&#x27;s Whisky A Go-Go club for the Hollywood Rock Walk of Fame Induction. During October, the band performed a tour of Great Britain with the Wildhearts and Young Heart Attack. The band performed seven shows across Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain between 21 and 28 October and from late November until early December they were in Germany and Switzerland, touring with Skew Siskin and Mustasch. On 9 December, the previously recorded &quot;Live at Brixton Academy&quot; album was released.

===2004–2009: &quot;Inferno&quot;, &quot;Kiss of Death&quot;, and &quot;Motörizer&quot;===
Motörhead performed an invitation-only concert at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden, London on 22 February 2004; at Summer Festivals in South America during May; and in Europe during June, July and August. They had already spent time in the studio, working on &quot;Inferno&quot;, which was released on 22 June and followed by the &quot;Inferno&quot; tour of Ireland with Class of Zero for three dates. Joined by Sepultura, the tour hit Great Britain. Some of the London show at the Hammersmith Apollo was filmed for TV as Gene Simmons introduced the extra opening act the Class, made up of school children from his Channel 4 series &quot;Rock School&quot;. Würzel guested on &quot;Overkill&quot;. The band continued the tour with Sepultura across Europe through the rest of November and December. At the show in Magdeburg, Germany on 4 December Motörhead joined Sepultura on stage during their support slot playing the song &quot;Orgasmatron&quot;, in celebration of Sepultura&#x27;s 20th Anniversary. The show on 7 December at the Philipshalle in Düsseldorf was recorded and later released as the &quot;Stage Fright&quot; DVD.

Motörhead picked up their first Grammy in the awards of 2005 in the Best Metal Performance category for their cover of Metallica&#x27;s &quot;Whiplash&quot; on &quot;Metallic Attack: The Ultimate Tribute&quot;. &quot;They&#x27;ve managed to get the knife in,&quot; Lemmy grumbled. &quot;It was only a mercy fuck – it was our 30th anniversary. If they gave us a Grammy for one of our albums or songs, it would mean something.&quot;

From March until early May 2005, the band toured the United States, and in June and August were on the &quot;30th Anniversary&quot; tour in Europe. On 22 August, they were the subject of an hour-long documentary, &quot;Live Fast, Die Old&quot;, aired on Channel 4 as part of &quot;The Other Side&quot; series of documentaries, filmed by new and established directors.

On 20 September, a compilation containing the band&#x27;s appearances on BBC Radio 1 and a concert recording from Paris Theatre, London, was released as &quot;BBC Live &amp; In-Session&quot;. In October, the band toured Europe with Mondo Generator before returning to Britain to tour with In Flames and Girlschool in October and November. During the show at the Brixton Academy on 19 November, Lemmy joined Girlschool on stage to play &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Touch&quot;. Motörhead finished the year&#x27;s tours in December, with two engagements in New Zealand and five in Australia with Mötley Crüe. Also in 2005, Motörhead played on the Vaya Con Tioz farewell festival Böhse Onkelz at Lausitzring. In 2006, the band performed a four-date House of Blues tour in the States in March with Meldrum and from June until early August played at European open-air festivals with some indoor headlining shows. On 28 October, the band performed at The Rock Freakers Ball in Kansas City before heading off to tour Great Britain with Clutch and Crucified Barbara.

During that tour, &quot;Kiss of Death&quot; was released on 29 August 2006 via Sanctuary Records, with a video for &quot;Be My Baby&quot;. The tour ended on 25 November at the Brixton Academy, where Phil Campbell played on &quot;Killed By Death&quot; during Crucified Barbara&#x27;s support set. Twelve shows in Europe with Meldrum took them through the end of November to early December, the first two shows also featuring Skew Siskin.

In November, the band agreed to a sponsorship deal with the Greenbank B under-10s football team from North Hykeham, Lincoln, putting the band&#x27;s name as well as War-Pig on the team&#x27;s shirts; the under-10s run out to &quot;Ace of Spades&quot;. Lemmy is old friends with Gary Weight, the team&#x27;s manager; Weight &quot;sent an email off to them and they came back and said it was a great idea&quot; and hopes the deal will draw inspired performances from his team. On 25 April 2007, the band played at the Poliedro de Caracas in Caracas, Venezuela, and on 29 April at the Fundiçao Progresso, Rio de Janeiro. In June, Motörhead played an engagement at the Royal Festival Hall as part of Jarvis Cocker&#x27;s Meltdown. On 26 February 2008, &quot;No Sleep &#x27;til Hammersmith&quot; was reissued again as a two disc CD.

From March through to June 2008, the band convened in Los Angeles with producer Cameron Webb to begin work on their 19th album &quot;Motörizer&quot;. Mikkey Dee&#x27;s drum tracks were recorded at Dave Grohl&#x27;s studio. &quot;Motörizer&quot; was released on 26 August. It does not feature artwork by Joe Petagno, the artist who designed many of their classic covers. In June 2008 the band performed on the main stage of the Download festival. Between 6 and 31 August, Motörhead joined Judas Priest, Heaven &amp; Hell and Testament on the Metal Masters Tour. On 20 August the band played at the Roseland Ballroom, New York, as part of &quot;The Volcom Tour 2008&quot;, which continued with the Misfits, Airbourne, Valient Thorr and Year Long Disaster at House of Blues, Anaheim, California, on 2 September, playing a further thirteen dates. The band concluded the tour without the supporting bands, playing one more show at the Roseland Ballroom on 20 September, and the final engagement, at The Stone Pony, Asbury Park, New Jersey on 21 September.

On 30 September, Reuters reported that Neverdie Studios had signed a deal with Lemmy and Motörhead to develop and market Lemmy&#x27;s Castle and Motorhead Stadium inside the virtual world of Entropia Universe, an online universe. The year&#x27;s touring ended with a 34-date tour of Europe with a variety of support bands including Danko Jones, Saxon, Witchcraft, and Airbourne.

On 6 March 2009, the band played in the Middle East for the first time, at the annual Dubai Desert Rock Festival. On 1 April Motörhead were reported to have entered into a two-year sponsorship deal with UK Roller Derby team the Lincolnshire Bombers Roller Girls. That September, noted drummer Matt Sorum filled in for Mikkey Dee for a U.S. tour. &quot;I was absolutely blown away and was very honoured to get the call,&quot; Sorum said. &quot;You know what I love about Lemmy? He&#x27;s always on time. We go on stage, no delays. Being in bands where you have to wait around for a couple of hours fucks you up.&quot;

In November 2009, the band were supported by NWOBHM veterans Sweet Savage on the Irish leg of the tour (30 years after first sharing the stage together) and punk and goth rock legends the Damned on the UK leg of their world tour. On the Damned&#x27;s official website, Captain Sensible said: &quot;Ha ha ... we&#x27;re working with Lemmy again, are we? Excellent! He&#x27;s the real deal, the absolute antithesis to all that the likes of Simon Cowell stand for. And for that we should all be grateful. This tour will be a celebration of all things rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll ... pity the poor roadies is all I can say!&quot;

===2010–2015: &quot;The Wörld Is Yours&quot;, &quot;Aftershock&quot;, and &quot;Bad Magic&quot;===
In a November 2009 interview with ABORT Magazine&#x27;s E.S. Day, Lemmy said that Motörhead would enter the studio in February 2010 &quot;to rehearse, write and record&quot; their 20th studio album, to be released by the end of the year. The album was recorded with Cameron Webb and Welsh producer Romesh Dodangoda in Longwave Studio, Cardiff. In an interview with Hungarian television in July 2010, drummer Mikkey Dee announced that the album was finished, with 11 tracks. The album&#x27;s name was said to be &quot;The Wörld Is Yours&quot;. On 3 November 2010, Future plc, a UK media company, announced that Motörhead were to release &quot;The Wörld is Yours&quot; via an exclusive publishing deal with &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine on 14 December 2010. The standard CD release of &quot;The Wörld is Yours&quot; would go on sale on 17 January 2011, through Motörhead&#x27;s own label, Motörhead Music.

To coincide with the release of their upcoming album, Motörhead embarked on a 35th Anniversary UK tour, from 8–28 November 2010, and a European tour from 30 November 2010 – 19 December 2010. They also took their tour to the Americas in 2011. In October, the band recorded a slow blues version of their longtime hit &quot;Ace of Spades&quot; for a TV spot for Kronenbourg beer. On 5 December the single &quot;Get Back in Line&quot; was released, followed by the release of a video for the single on 6 December. In December, Mikkey Dee stated to French journalists that Motörhead are planning to release a box-set with several DVDs in 2011. He did not give any details but said that it will come in a &quot;beautiful package including many surprises&quot;.

On 17 January 2011, it was announced that Motörhead would be part of the Sonisphere Festival in Knebworth. In August 2011, they headlined the Brutal Assault open-air festival in the Czech Republic. On 2 March 2011 Motörhead performed on &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot;.
On 9 July 2011, former guitarist Würzel died of a heart attack. In celebration of 35 years&#x27; touring, in late 2011 the band released the live DVD &quot;The Wörld Is Ours – Vol 1 – Everywhere Further Than Everyplace Else&quot;, including performances at the O2 Apollo Manchester, Best Buy Theater, New York City and Teatro Caupolicán, Santiago de Chile. On 19 December 2011, it was announced that Motörhead would play at the German festivals Rock am Ring and Rock im Park in Nürburgring and Nuremberg respectively in June 2012. On 12 January 2012, it was announced that Motörhead were touring the US and Canada in early 2012, along with three other metal bands Megadeth, Volbeat and Lacuna Coil. The Gigantour took place from 26 January to 28 February 2012, but Motörhead missed the final four shows because Lemmy had a combination of an upper respiratory viral infection and voice strain, resulting in severe laryngitis. Lemmy wrote on Facebook, &quot;I&#x27;m giving my voice a good rest&quot;, hoping he would recover soon to play at the Mayhem Festival, which was held from 30 June to 5 August 2012. Motörhead also took part on 23 June in the Rock-A-Field Luxembourg Open Air Festival in Roeser.

In an April 2012 interview with Classic Rock Revisited, Lemmy was asked if Motörhead were planning to make a follow-up to &quot;The Wörld Is Yours&quot;. He replied, &quot;We have not started writing any songs yet but we will. We put out an album out every two years. I will continue to do that as long as I can afford an amp.&quot; On 28 June 2012, Lemmy told Auburn Reporter that Motörhead will release their next album in 2013 and they had written &quot;about 6 songs so far.&quot; On 23 October 2012, Lemmy told Billboard.com that the band had planned to enter the studio in January to begin recording the album for a mid-2013 release. On 28 February 2013, it was announced that Motörhead had begun recording their new album. Motörhead released the live DVD &quot;The Wörld Is Ours – Vol. 2 – Anyplace Crazy As Anywhere Else&quot; in September 2012. On 18 June 2013, the new album&#x27;s title was revealed to be &quot;Aftershock&quot;.

In mid-November 2013, Motörhead were due to embark on a European tour alongside Saxon, followed by a tour in Germany and Scandinavia due to last until mid December 2013 but the dates were postponed and rescheduled for February and March 2014 due to Lemmy&#x27;s health problems. However, in January 2014, Motörhead announced the cancellation of the new February and March dates of their European tour as Lemmy was still to reach full recovery from diabetes related health problems. But the same month, the band was confirmed for Coachella Festival to take place across two weekends in spring 2014 (12–14 and 19–21 April) in Indio, California, the exact dates to be revealed as 13 and 20 April 2014. In February 2014, Motörhead confirmed a Summer tour 2014 with eight European dates (from 24 June to 10 August) in France (2 dates), Switzerland, Italy, Germany (2 dates), Russia and Ukraine. In March 2014, the band announced a Los Angeles date on 11 April 2014 at Club Nokia. Later on, two new dates on 17 and 18 April 2014 respectively in Las Vegas (Pearl) and San Francisco (Warfield) were added. Still in March 2014, Motörhead announced that three heavy metal bands Megadeth, Anthrax and themselves would perform from 22 to 26 September 2014 at the first annual Motörhead&#x27;s Motörboat cruise on board the Carnival Ecstasy (self-proclaimed &quot;The Loudest Boat in the World&quot;), due to sail from Miami and visit the ports of Key West and the Cozumel island just off Mexico&#x27;s Yucatán Peninsula.

In a September 2014 interview on Full Metal Jackie, Lemmy stated that Motörhead would &quot;probably&quot; enter the studio in January 2015 to start work on their 22nd studio album for a tentative late 2015 release. On 25 February 2015, Motörhead officially confirmed that they were in the studio recording their new album in Los Angeles with longtime producer Cameron Webb. On 27 May 2015, the band released teasers on their Facebook page with the roman number &quot;XXXX&quot; on it. On 4 June the new album (which would be their last) &quot;Bad Magic&quot; was launched for pre-order on Amazon, revealing its title and cover art which also shows the &quot;XXXX&quot;, coinciding with the 40th anniversary of the band. The album was released on 28 August 2015. The band performed at the UK&#x27;s Glastonbury Festival in June 2015. Their final UK gig was at the Eden Project on 27 June 2015.

While touring the album as the &quot;40th anniversary Tour&quot;, Motörhead had to cut short their Salt Lake City show on 27 August 2015 (in the Rocky Mountains) due to Lemmy&#x27;s breathing problems (the result of an altitude sickness) and then they had to cancel completely day-off their Denver Riot Fest set on 28 August 2015. Their tour picked up again on 1 September 2015 at Emo&#x27;s in Austin, Texas (moved from Cedar Park Center) but the group were again forced to abandon their set after three songs and to cancel subsequent shows (from the show on 2 September 2015 in San Antonio, Texas to the show on 5 September 2015 in Houston, Texas included).

Despite his ongoing health issues forcing Motörhead to cut short or cancel several US shows, Lemmy Kilmister was able to bounce back in time for the trio&#x27;s annual Motörboat heavy metal cruise from Miami to the Bahamas which ran from 28 September through 2 October 2015 including performances by bands such as Slayer, Anthrax, Exodus, Suicidal Tendencies and Corrosion of Conformity. For this occasion, Motörhead performed live two entire (identical) sets on 30 September and 1 October 2015.

Motörhead continued the &quot;40th Anniversary Tour&quot; in Europe in November and December. They played concerts in Germany, Sweden, Norway and Finland. Their final concert was in Berlin, Germany on 11 December 2015. After Lemmy&#x27;s death, drummer Mikkey Dee spoke in an interview about him: &quot;He was terribly gaunt. He spent all his energy on stage and afterwards he was very, very tired. It&#x27;s incredible that he could even play, that he could finish the Europe tour. It was only 20 days ago. Unbelievable.&quot; The &quot;40th Anniversary Tour&quot; was planned to continue in January 2016 in the band&#x27;s home country the UK, the first concert would have been in Newcastle on 23 January 2016.

===2015–2017: Lemmy&#x27;s death and break-up, &quot;Clean Your Clock&quot; and &quot;Under Cöver&quot;===
On 28 December 2015, Lemmy died, four days after celebrating his 70th birthday. He was the second Motörhead member to die in 2015, following Phil Taylor the previous month. The band posted the following message on Facebook:

The following day, drummer Mikkey Dee confirmed that Motörhead would not continue, stating, &quot;Motörhead is over, of course. Lemmy was Motörhead. We won&#x27;t be doing any more tours or anything. And there won&#x27;t be any more records. But the brand survives, and Lemmy lives on in the hearts of everyone.&quot; Two days after Lemmy&#x27;s death, guitarist Phil Campbell also stated that &quot;Motörhead is no longer&quot;.

A few days later, the band&#x27;s long-time manager Todd Singerman told the press that Lemmy had experienced chest pains two days after his 70th birthday party (held at Whisky a Go Go) and visited into the emergency room, but was released the next day. However, Singerman was concerned because Lemmy&#x27;s speech was &quot;getting bad&quot; and took him to a brain scan. On 26 December the doctor came into Lemmy&#x27;s apartment, &quot;brought the results and told us all that he has two to six months to live&quot;. Lemmy reacted calmly. &quot;He took it better than all of us&quot;, said Singerman. &quot;His only comment was, &#x27;Oh, only two months, huh?&#x27; The doctor goes, &#x27;Yeah, Lem, I don&#x27;t want to bullshit you. It&#x27;s bad, and there&#x27;s nothing anyone can do. I would be lying to you if I told you there was a chance.&#x27;&quot; Plans were made to treat Lemmy at home. A video game console at the Rainbow Bar and Grill that Lemmy loved to play was brought to his apartment. On 28 December 2015, he spent hours on the console, and Rainbow owner Mikael Maglieri paid a visit. Lemmy died in his sleep later that day.

An autopsy on Kilmister showed that the causes of death were prostate cancer, a cardiac arrhythmia, and congestive heart failure.

Initially planned on 27 May 2016, UDR Music released on 10 June 2016 &quot;Clean Your Clock&quot;, a Motörhead archive live album due to contain material recorded at the 20 and 21 November 2015 shows at the Zenith in Munich. On 1 September 2017, Motörhead released &quot;Under Cöver&quot;, a covers album featuring covers throughout Motörhead&#x27;s history, along with covers only found on tribute albums, and new recordings.

Former Motörhead guitarist &quot;Fast&quot; Eddie Clarke died on 10 January 2018 after a battle with pneumonia at the age of 67, making him the last member of the band&#x27;s classic line-up (following Taylor and Lemmy) to die.

Original Motörhead guitarist Larry Wallis died on 19 September 2019 at age 70 from an unknown cause.

==After Motörhead==

Following the dissolution of the band as a result of Lemmy&#x27;s death Phil Campbell went on to found Phil Campbell and the Bastard Sons. The band originally focused on performing Motörhead songs at major festivals. The band has subsequently performed in supporting slots with Guns N&#x27; Roses, Hawkwind, Saxon, and Airbourne. Following their debut album &quot;The Age of Absurdity&quot;, released in January 2018 they have gone on to produce several acclaimed albums of their own material and to establish a reputation as a successful touring band in their own right.

Mikkey Dee joined Thin Lizzy to play on their anniversary shows in January 2016. However, on 19 April, it was announced that he would not be participating. Subsequently, it was announced that Dee would be filling in for James Kottak on the Scorpions&#x27; twelve North American headlining dates, including a run of shows at the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas dubbed &quot;Scorpions blacked out in Las Vegas&quot;. Dee later joined the band permanently.

==Musical style==
AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote: &quot;Motörhead&#x27;s overwhelmingly loud and fast style of heavy metal was one of the most groundbreaking styles the genre had to offer in the late &#x27;70s&quot; and though &quot;Motörhead wasn&#x27;t punk rock ... they were the first metal band to harness that energy and, in the process, they created speed metal and thrash metal.&quot;

Although Motörhead is often considered a heavy metal band, Lemmy always described Motörhead&#x27;s music as simply &quot;rock and roll&quot;. In 2011, he said: &quot;We were not heavy metal. We were a rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll band. Still are. Everyone always describes us as heavy metal even when I tell them otherwise. Why won&#x27;t people listen?&quot; In 2014, he reiterated to &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; that he did not particularly like heavy metal.

Lemmy had stated that he generally felt more kinship with punk rockers than with heavy metal bands: Motörhead had engagements with fellow Brits, the Damned, with whom he played bass on a handful of late 1970s engagements, as well as having penned the song &quot;R.A.M.O.N.E.S.&quot; as a tribute to the Ramones. Motörhead, Lemmy stated, have more in common aesthetically with the Damned than Black Sabbath, and nothing whatsoever in common with Judas Priest. Lemmy said he felt little kinship with the speed metal bands Motörhead have inspired:

The &quot;NME&quot; stated that their brief solos were just long enough &quot;... to open another bottle of beer&quot;, while a 1977 &quot;Stereo Review&quot; commented that &quot;they know they&#x27;re like animals, and they don&#x27;t want to appear any other way. In view of the many ugly frogs in heavy metal who think they are God&#x27;s gift to womankind these Quasimodos even seem charming in their own way&quot;. Motörhead&#x27;s approach did not change drastically over the band&#x27;s career, though this is a deliberate choice: erstwhile Motörhead drummer Phil &quot;Philthy Animal&quot; Taylor said that rock icons like Chuck Berry and Little Richard never drastically altered their style, and, like them, Motörhead preferred to play what they enjoyed and did best. This fondness for the first decade of rock and roll (mid-1950s to mid-1960s) is also reflected in some of Motörhead&#x27;s occasional cover songs from that era.

Lemmy often played power chords in his basslines. When asked about whether he had begun as a rhythm guitarist, he stated:

==Name and logo==
The name &quot;Motörhead&quot; is a reference to users of the drug amphetamine. The band&#x27;s distinctive fanged-face logo, with its oversized boar&#x27;s tusks, chains, and spikes, was created by artist Joe Petagno in 1977 for the cover of the &quot;Motörhead&quot; album and has appeared in many variations on covers of ensuing albums. The fanged face has been referred to variously as &quot;War-Pig&quot; and &quot;Snaggletooth&quot;. The band&#x27;s name is usually printed in a lowercase form of blackletter. The umlaut character ö is possibly derived from the similar &quot;heavy metal umlaut&quot; in the name of their 1975 acquaintances Blue Öyster Cult. However, this umlaut does not alter the pronunciation of the band&#x27;s name. When asked if Germans pronounced the band &quot;Motuuuurhead&quot;, Lemmy answered &quot;No, they don&#x27;t. I only put it in there to look mean&quot;. 
Snaggletooth is the fanged face that serves as the symbol of Motörhead. Artist Joe Petagno drew it in 1977 for the cover of the band&#x27;s debut album (with designer Phil Smee who turned it into a negative and did the lettering to complete the logo), having met Lemmy while doing some work with Hawkwind. Petagno stated:

Eddie Clarke was less sure about the imagery to begin with:

It has remained a symbol of Motörhead throughout the years, with Petagno creating many variations of Snaggletooth/War-Pig, for the covers of ensuing albums. Only two of the original covers for Motörhead&#x27;s 22 studio albums do not feature any variation of War-Pig on the cover: &quot;On Parole&quot; and &quot;Overnight Sensation&quot; (of which, &quot;On Parole&quot; was never sanctioned by the band), and was in any case reissued with a black Snaggletooth on a white background. Phil is wearing a Snaggletooth badge on the cover of &quot;Ace of Spades&quot;. The cover of &quot;Iron Fist&quot; depicts a metal gauntlet wearing four skull-shaped rings, one of which is Snaggletooth, while the rear of the album-sleeve shows a fully detailed metal sculpture of the symbol. Originally the Snaggletooth design included a swastika on one of the helmet&#x27;s spikes. This was painted out on later re-releases of the albums on CD.

On 21 September 2007, Petagno announced that &quot;there will be no more &quot;HEADS&quot; from my hand&quot;, citing irreconcilable differences between himself and the band&#x27;s current management, Singerman Entertainment. Petagno stated:

In reply, Lemmy stated:

==Professional wrestling==
Motörhead are well known in the professional wrestling world for performing wrestler Triple H&#x27;s entrance music, &quot;The Game&quot;, which he has used as his entrance music since January 2001. In addition to the song playing whenever Triple H appears on WWE programming such as &quot;Raw&quot; or &quot;SmackDown&quot;, and at other pay-per-view wrestling events, the band have performed the song live for him at WrestleMania X-Seven and WrestleMania 21. Their song &quot;Rock Out&quot; was also used as the theme song of the WWE pay-per-view Unforgiven in 2008. Motörhead also provided the entrance music for Triple H&#x27;s faction Evolution, entitled &quot;Line in the Sand&quot;. &quot;The Game&quot; was released on both the American version of the &quot;Hammered&quot; and &quot;WWF The Music, Vol. 5&quot; albums, and &quot;Line in the Sand&quot; was released on the &quot;WWE ThemeAddict: The Music, Vol. 6&quot; album. Motörhead have since performed a third entrance track for Triple H, entitled &quot;King of Kings&quot;, which made its debut at WrestleMania 22. Triple H has also introduced the band in concert. Lemmy inspired Triple H&#x27;s facial hair, and Triple H spoke at Lemmy&#x27;s funeral.

Halfway through shooting, the idea of gradually replacing the members of the ballroom band with Motörhead was hit upon. At first there are no Motörhead personnel, then Phil Campbell appears, followed by Würzel and Phil Taylor. The scene involving Lemmy riding a motorcycle is played by a female stunt double as Lemmy was on tour with Motörhead in America at the time the scene had to be shot.
* 2010: &quot;Lemmy (49% Motherf**ker. 51% Son of a Bitch.)&quot; (rockumentary film profile of Ian &quot;Lemmy&quot; Kilmister)

==Video game==
&quot;Motörhead&quot;, a side-scrolling beat &#x27;em up based on the band, was released for the Amiga only in the UK in 1992 and was published by Virgin Games, Ltd. and developed by Kaitsu Software.

<doc id="20911" wikidata="Q3327819" url="?curid=20911" title="Multiverse">
<text>The multiverse is the hypothetical set of all universes. Together, these universes are presumed to comprise everything that exists: the entirety of space, time, matter, energy, information, and the physical laws and constants that describe them. The different universes within the multiverse are called &quot;parallel universes&quot;, &quot;flat universes&quot;, &quot;other universes&quot;, &quot;alternate universes&quot;, &quot;multiple universes&quot;, &quot;plane universes&quot;, &quot;parent and child universes&quot;, &quot;many universes&quot;, or &quot;many worlds&quot;. One common assumption is that the multiverse is a &quot;patchwork quilt of separate universes all bound by the same laws of physics.&quot;

The concept of multiple universes, or a multiverse, has been discussed throughout history. It has evolved and has been debated in various fields, including cosmology, physics, and philosophy. Some physicists argue that the multiverse is a philosophical notion rather than a scientific hypothesis, as it cannot be empirically falsified. In recent years, there have been proponents and skeptics of multiverse theories within the physics community. Although some scientists have analyzed data in search of evidence for other universes, no statistically significant evidence has been found. Critics argue that the multiverse concept lacks testability and falsifiability, which are essential for scientific inquiry, and that it raises unresolved metaphysical issues.

Max Tegmark and Brian Greene have proposed different classification schemes for multiverses and universes. Tegmark&#x27;s four-level classification consists of Level I: an extension of our universe, Level II: universes with different physical constants, Level III: many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, and Level IV: ultimate ensemble. Brian Greene&#x27;s nine types of multiverses include quilted, inflationary, brane, cyclic, landscape, quantum, holographic, simulated, and ultimate. The ideas explore various dimensions of space, physical laws, and mathematical structures to explain the existence and interactions of multiple universes. Some other multiverse concepts include twin-world models, cyclic theories, M-theory, and black-hole cosmology.

The anthropic principle suggests that the existence of a multitude of universes, each with different physical laws, could explain the asserted appearance of fine-tuning of our own universe for conscious life. The weak anthropic principle posits that we exist in one of the few universes that support life. Debates around Occam&#x27;s razor and the simplicity of the multiverse versus a single universe arise, with proponents like Max Tegmark arguing that the multiverse is simpler and more elegant. The many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics and modal realism, the belief that all possible worlds exist and are as real as our world, are also subjects of debate in the context of the anthropic principle.

== History of the concept ==
According to some, the idea of infinite worlds was first suggested by the pre-Socratic Greek philosopher Anaximander in the sixth century BCE. However, there is debate as to whether he believed in multiple worlds, and if he did, whether those worlds were co-existent or successive.

The first to whom we can definitively attribute the concept of innumerable worlds are the Ancient Greek Atomists, beginning with Leucippus and Democritus in the 5th century BCE, followed by Epicurus (341–270 BCE) and Lucretius (1st century BCE). In the third century BCE, the philosopher Chrysippus suggested that the world eternally expired and regenerated, effectively suggesting the existence of multiple universes across time. The concept of multiple universes became more defined in the Middle Ages.

The American philosopher and psychologist William James used the term &quot;multiverse&quot; in 1895, but in a different context.

The concept first appeared in the modern scientific context in the course of the debate between Boltzmann and Zermelo in 1895.

In Dublin in 1952, Erwin Schrödinger gave a lecture in which he jocularly warned his audience that what he was about to say might &quot;seem lunatic&quot;. He said that when his equations seemed to describe several different histories, these were &quot;not alternatives, but all really happen simultaneously&quot;. This sort of duality is called &quot;superposition&quot;.

== Search for evidence ==
In the 1990s, after recent works of fiction about the concept gained popularity, scientific discussions about the multiverse and journal articles about it gained prominence.

Around 2010, scientists such as Stephen M. Feeney analyzed Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) data and claimed to find evidence suggesting that this universe collided with other (parallel) universes in the distant past. However, a more thorough analysis of data from the WMAP and from the Planck satellite, which has a resolution three times higher than WMAP, did not reveal any statistically significant evidence of such a bubble universe collision. In addition, there was no evidence of any gravitational pull of other universes on ours.

In 2015, an astrophysicist may have found evidence of alternate or parallel universes by looking back in time to a time immediately after the Big Bang, although it is still a matter of debate among physicists. Dr. Ranga-Ram Chary, after analyzing the cosmic radiation spectrum, found a signal 4,500 times brighter than it should have been, based on the number of protons and electrons scientists believe existed in the very early universe. This signal—an emission line that arose from the formation of atoms during the era of recombination—is more consistent with a universe whose ratio of matter particles to photons is about 65 times greater than our own. There is a 30% chance that this signal is noise, and not really a signal at all; however, it is also possible that it exists because a parallel universe dumped some of its matter particles into our universe. If additional protons and electrons had been added to our universe during recombination, more atoms would have formed, more photons would have been emitted during their formation, and the signature line that arose from all of these emissions would be greatly enhanced. Chary himself is skeptical:

Chary also noted:

The signature that Chary has isolated may be a consequence of incoming light from distant galaxies, or even from clouds of dust surrounding our own galaxy.

== Proponents and skeptics ==
Modern proponents of one or more of the multiverse hypotheses include Lee Smolin, Don Page, Brian Greene, Max Tegmark, Alan Guth, Andrei Linde, Michio Kaku, David Deutsch, Leonard Susskind, Alexander Vilenkin, Yasunori Nomura, Raj Pathria, Laura Mersini-Houghton, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Sean Carroll and Stephen Hawking.

Scientists who are generally skeptical of the concept of a multiverse or popular multiverse hypotheses include Sabine Hossenfelder, David Gross, Paul Steinhardt, Anna Ijjas, Abraham Loeb, David Spergel, Neil Turok, Viatcheslav Mukhanov, Michael S. Turner, Roger Penrose, George Ellis, Joe Silk, Carlo Rovelli, Adam Frank, Marcelo Gleiser, Jim Baggott and Paul Davies.

== Arguments against multiverse hypotheses ==
In his 2003 &quot;New York Times&quot; opinion piece, &quot;A Brief History of the Multiverse&quot;, author and cosmologist Paul Davies offered a variety of arguments that multiverse hypotheses are non-scientific: 

George Ellis, writing in August 2011, provided a criticism of the multiverse, and pointed out that it is not a traditional scientific theory. He accepts that the multiverse is thought to exist far beyond the cosmological horizon. He emphasized that it is theorized to be so far away that it is unlikely any evidence will ever be found. Ellis also explained that some theorists do not believe the lack of empirical testability and falsifiability is a major concern, but he is opposed to that line of thinking: 

Ellis says that scientists have proposed the idea of the multiverse as a way of explaining the nature of existence. He points out that it ultimately leaves those questions unresolved because it is a metaphysical issue that cannot be resolved by empirical science. He argues that observational testing is at the core of science and should not be abandoned: 

Philosopher Philip Goff argues that the inference of a multiverse to explain the apparent fine-tuning of the universe is an example of Inverse Gambler&#x27;s Fallacy.

Stoeger, Ellis, and Kircher note that in a true multiverse theory, &quot;the universes are then completely disjoint and nothing that happens in any one of them is causally linked to what happens in any other one. This lack of any causal connection in such multiverses really places them beyond any scientific support&quot;.

In May 2020, astrophysicist Ethan Siegel expressed criticism in a Forbes blog post that parallel universes would have to remain a science fiction dream for the time being, based on the scientific evidence available to us.

&quot;Scientific American&quot; contributor John Horgan also argues against the idea of a multiverse, claiming that they are &quot;bad for science.&quot;

== Types ==
Max Tegmark and Brian Greene have devised classification schemes for the various theoretical types of multiverses and universes that they might comprise.

=== Max Tegmark&#x27;s four levels ===
Cosmologist Max Tegmark has provided a taxonomy of universes beyond the familiar observable universe. The four levels of Tegmark&#x27;s classification are arranged such that subsequent levels can be understood to encompass and expand upon previous levels. They are briefly described below.

==== Level I: An extension of our universe ====
A prediction of cosmic inflation is the existence of an infinite ergodic universe, which, being infinite, must contain Hubble volumes realizing all initial conditions.

Accordingly, an infinite universe will contain an infinite number of Hubble volumes, all having the same physical laws and physical constants. In regard to configurations such as the distribution of matter, almost all will differ from our Hubble volume. However, because there are infinitely many, far beyond the cosmological horizon, there will eventually be Hubble volumes with similar, and even identical, configurations. Tegmark estimates that an identical volume to ours should be about 1010115 meters away from us.

Given infinite space, there would be an infinite number of Hubble volumes identical to ours in the universe. This follows directly from the cosmological principle, wherein it is assumed that our Hubble volume is not special or unique.

==== Level II: Universes with different physical constants ====

In the eternal inflation theory, which is a variant of the cosmic inflation theory, the multiverse or space as a whole is stretching and will continue doing so forever, but some regions of space stop stretching and form distinct bubbles (like gas pockets in a loaf of rising bread). Such bubbles are embryonic level I multiverses.

Different bubbles may experience different spontaneous symmetry breaking, which results in different properties, such as different physical constants.

Level II also includes John Archibald Wheeler&#x27;s oscillatory universe theory and Lee Smolin&#x27;s fecund universes theory.

==== Level III: Many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics ====

Hugh Everett III&#x27;s many-worlds interpretation (MWI) is one of several mainstream interpretations of quantum mechanics.

In brief, one aspect of quantum mechanics is that certain observations cannot be predicted absolutely. Instead, there is a range of possible observations, each with a different probability. According to the MWI, each of these possible observations corresponds to a different &quot;world&quot; within the Universal wavefunction, with each world as real as ours. Suppose a six-sided dice is thrown and that the result of the throw corresponds to observable quantum mechanics. All six possible ways the dice can fall correspond to six different worlds. In the case of the Schrödinger&#x27;s cat thought experiment, both outcomes would be &quot;real&quot; in at least one &quot;world&quot;.

Tegmark argues that a Level III multiverse does not contain more possibilities in the Hubble volume than a Level I or Level II multiverse. In effect, all the different worlds created by &quot;splits&quot; in a Level III multiverse with the same physical constants can be found in some Hubble volume in a Level I multiverse. Tegmark writes that, &quot;The only difference between Level I and Level III is where your doppelgängers reside. In Level I they live elsewhere in good old three-dimensional space. In Level III they live on another quantum branch in infinite-dimensional Hilbert space.&quot;

Similarly, all Level II bubble universes with different physical constants can, in effect, be found as &quot;worlds&quot; created by &quot;splits&quot; at the moment of spontaneous symmetry breaking in a Level III multiverse. According to Yasunori Nomura, Raphael Bousso, and Leonard Susskind, this is because global spacetime appearing in the (eternally) inflating multiverse is a redundant concept. This implies that the multiverses of Levels I, II, and III are, in fact, the same thing. This hypothesis is referred to as &quot;Multiverse = Quantum Many Worlds&quot;. According to Yasunori Nomura, this quantum multiverse is static, and time is a simple illusion.

Another version of the many-worlds idea is H. Dieter Zeh&#x27;s &quot;many-minds&quot; interpretation.

==== Level IV: Ultimate ensemble ====
The ultimate mathematical universe hypothesis is Tegmark&#x27;s own hypothesis.

This level considers all universes to be equally real which can be described by different mathematical structures.

Tegmark writes: 

He argues that this &quot;implies that any conceivable parallel universe theory can be described at Level IV&quot; and &quot;subsumes all other ensembles, therefore brings closure to the hierarchy of multiverses, and there cannot be, say, a Level V.&quot;

Jürgen Schmidhuber, however, says that the set of mathematical structures is not even well-defined and that it admits only universe representations describable by constructive mathematics—that is, computer programs.

Schmidhuber explicitly includes universe representations describable by non-halting programs whose output bits converge after a finite time, although the convergence time itself may not be predictable by a halting program, due to the undecidability of the halting problem. He also explicitly discusses the more restricted ensemble of quickly computable universes.

=== Brian Greene&#x27;s nine types ===
The American theoretical physicist and string theorist Brian Greene discussed nine types of multiverses:

;Quilted
:The quilted multiverse works only in an infinite universe. With an infinite amount of space, every possible event will occur an infinite number of times. However, the speed of light prevents us from being aware of these other identical areas.

;Inflationary
:The inflationary multiverse is composed of various pockets in which inflation fields collapse and form new universes.

;Brane
:The brane multiverse version postulates that our entire universe exists on a membrane (brane) which floats in a higher dimension or &quot;bulk&quot;. In this bulk, there are other membranes with their own universes. These universes can interact with one another, and when they collide, the violence and energy produced is more than enough to give rise to a Big Bang. The branes float or drift near each other in the bulk, and every few trillion years, attracted by gravity or some other force we do not understand, collide and bang into each other. This repeated contact gives rise to multiple or &quot;cyclic&quot; Big Bangs. This particular hypothesis falls under the string theory umbrella as it requires extra spatial dimensions.

;Cyclic
:The cyclic multiverse has multiple branes that have collided, causing Big Bangs. The universes bounce back and pass through time until they are pulled back together and again collide, destroying the old contents and creating them anew.

;Landscape
:The landscape multiverse relies on string theory&#x27;s Calabi–Yau spaces. Quantum fluctuations drop the shapes to a lower energy level, creating a pocket with a set of laws different from that of the surrounding space.

;Quantum
:The quantum multiverse creates a new universe when a diversion in events occurs, as in the real-worlds variant of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.

;Holographic
:The holographic multiverse is derived from the theory that the surface area of a space can encode the contents of the volume of the region.

;Simulated
:The simulated multiverse exists on complex computer systems that simulate entire universes. A related hypothesis, as put forward as a possibility by astronomer Avi Loeb, is that universes may be creatable in laboratories of advanced technological civilizations who have a theory of everything. Other related hypotheses include brain in a vat-type scenarios where the perceived universe is either simulated in a low-resource way or not perceived directly by the virtual/simulated inhabitant species.

;Ultimate
:The ultimate multiverse contains every mathematically possible universe under different laws of physics.

=== Twin-world models ===

There are models of two related universes that e.g. attempt to explain the baryon asymmetry – why there was more matter than antimatter at the beginning – with a mirror anti-universe. One two-universe cosmological model could explain the Hubble constant (H0) tension via interactions between the two worlds. The &quot;mirror world&quot; would contain copies of all existing fundamental particles. Another twin/pair-world or &quot;bi-world&quot; cosmology is shown to theoretically be able to solve the cosmological constant (Λ) problem, closely related to dark energy: two interacting worlds with a large Λ each could result in a small shared effective Λ.

=== Cyclic theories ===

In several theories, there is a series of, in some cases infinite, self-sustaining cycles – typically a series of Big Crunches (or Big Bounces). However, the respective universes do not exist at once but are forming or following in a logical order or sequence, with key natural constituents potentially varying between universes (see § Anthropic principle).

== M-theory ==

A multiverse of a somewhat different kind has been envisaged within string theory and its higher-dimensional extension, M-theory.

These theories require the presence of 10 or 11 spacetime dimensions respectively. The extra six or seven dimensions may either be compactified on a very small scale, or our universe may simply be localized on a dynamical (3+1)-dimensional object, a D3-brane. This opens up the possibility that there are other branes which could support other universes.

== Black-hole cosmology ==

Black-hole cosmology is a cosmological model in which the observable universe is the interior of a black hole existing as one of possibly many universes inside a larger universe. This includes the theory of white holes, which are on the opposite side of space-time.

== Anthropic principle ==

The concept of other universes has been proposed to explain how our own universe appears to be fine-tuned for conscious life as we experience it.

If there were a large (possibly infinite) number of universes, each with possibly different physical laws (or different fundamental physical constants), then some of these universes (even if very few) would have the combination of laws and fundamental parameters that are suitable for the development of matter, astronomical structures, elemental diversity, stars, and planets that can exist long enough for life to emerge and evolve.

The weak anthropic principle could then be applied to conclude that we (as conscious beings) would only exist in one of those few universes that happened to be finely tuned, permitting the existence of life with developed consciousness. Thus, while the probability might be extremely small that any particular universe would have the requisite conditions for life (as we understand life), those conditions do not require intelligent design as an explanation for the conditions in the Universe that promote our existence in it.

An early form of this reasoning is evident in Arthur Schopenhauer&#x27;s 1844 work &quot;Von der Nichtigkeit und dem Leiden des Lebens&quot;, where he argues that our world must be the worst of all possible worlds, because if it were significantly worse in any respect it could not continue to exist.

== Occam&#x27;s razor ==
Proponents and critics disagree about how to apply Occam&#x27;s razor. Critics argue that to postulate an almost infinite number of unobservable universes, just to explain our own universe, is contrary to Occam&#x27;s razor. However, proponents argue that in terms of Kolmogorov complexity the proposed multiverse is simpler than a single idiosyncratic universe.

For example, multiverse proponent Max Tegmark argues: 

== Possible worlds and real worlds ==
In any given set of possible universes – e.g. in terms of histories or variables of nature – not all may be ever realized, and some may be realized many times. For example, over infinite time there could, in some potential theories, be infinite universes, but only a small or relatively small real number of universes where humanity could exist and only one where it ever does exist (with a unique history). It has been suggested that a universe that &quot;contains life, in the form it has on Earth, is in a certain sense radically non-ergodic, in that the vast majority of possible organisms will never be realized&quot;. On the other hand, some scientists, theories and popular works conceive of a multiverse in which the universes are so similar that humanity exists in many equally real separate universes but with varying histories.

There is a debate about whether the other worlds are real in the many-worlds interpretation (MWI) of quantum mechanics. In Quantum Darwinism one does not need to adopt a MWI in which all of the branches are equally real.

=== Modal realism ===
Possible worlds are a way of explaining probability and hypothetical statements. Some philosophers, such as David Lewis, posit that all possible worlds exist and that they are just as real as the world we live in. This position is known as modal realism.

<text>This is a list of conflicts in the [[Near East]] arranged chronologically from the epipaleolithic until the end of the late modern period ( – c. AD 1945). The Near East is generally associated with Anatolia, the Levant, Mesopotamia, Persia, Egypt, the Arabian Peninsula, and the Caucasus.

Also listed might be any raid, strike, skirmish, siege, sacking, and/or battle (both land and naval) that occurred on the territories of a modern country occupying what may today be referred to as the &quot;Middle East&quot; (or the &quot;Ancient Near East&quot; when in reference to this region&#x27;s military history during classical antiquity); however, was itself only part of an operation of a campaign in a theater of a greater, interregional war (e.g. any and/or all border, undeclared, colonial, proxy, liberation, world wars, etc.) There may also be periods of violent, civil unrest listed; such as, shootouts, spree killings, massacres, terrorist attacks, coups, assassinations, regicides, riots, rebellions, revolutions, and civil wars (as well as wars of succession and/or independence). The list might also contain episodes of human sacrifice, mass suicide, and ethnic cleansing/genocide.

<doc id="20922" wikidata="Q167096" url="?curid=20922" title="Molotov cocktail">
<text>A Molotov cocktail (among several other names – &quot;see &quot;) is a hand-thrown incendiary weapon consisting of a frangible container filled with flammable substances and equipped with a fuse (typically a glass bottle filled with flammable liquids sealed with a cloth wick). In use, the fuse attached to the container is lit and the weapon is thrown, shattering on impact. This ignites the flammable substances contained in the bottle and spreads flames as the fuel burns.

Due to their relative ease of production, Molotov cocktails are typically improvised weapons. Their improvised usage spans criminals, gangsters, rioters, football hooligans, urban guerrillas, terrorists, irregular soldiers, freedom fighters, and even regular soldiers; usage in the latter case is often due to a shortage of equivalent military-issued munitions. Despite the weapon&#x27;s improvised nature and uncertain quality, many modern militaries exercise the use of Molotov cocktails.

However, Molotov cocktails are not always improvised in the field. It is not uncommon for them to be mass-produced to a certain standard as part of preparation for combat. Some examples of this being done are the anti-invasion preparations of the British Home Guard during World War II and the Ukrainian volunteer units during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. During World War II, Molotov cocktails were even factory produced in several countries, such as Finland, Nazi Germany,&lt;ref name=&quot;brandhandgranate 48/57&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the Soviet Union, Sweden, and the United States; some featuring specially designed frangible containers and fuses (such as the US Frangible Grenade M1 for example).

== Etymology ==

The name &quot;Molotov cocktail&quot; () was coined by the Finns during the Winter War in 1939. The name was a pejorative reference to Soviet foreign minister Vyacheslav Molotov, who was one of the architects of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact on the eve of World War II.

The name&#x27;s origin came from the propaganda Molotov produced during the Winter War, mainly his declaration on Soviet state radio that incendiary bombing missions over Finland were actually &quot;airborne humanitarian food deliveries&quot; for their &quot;starving&quot; neighbours. As a result, the Finns sarcastically dubbed the Soviet incendiary cluster bombs &quot;Molotov bread baskets&quot; () in reference to Molotov&#x27;s propaganda broadcasts. When the hand-held bottle firebomb was developed to attack and destroy Soviet tanks, the Finns called it the &quot;Molotov cocktail&quot;, as &quot;a drink to go with his food parcels&quot;.

Despite the now infamous name, the formal Finnish military term for the weapon type was, and continues to be, &quot;burn-bottle&quot; (, Fenno-Swedish: &quot;brännflaska&quot;).

=== Other names ===
The weapon most often known as the Molotov cocktail goes under a great variety of other names around the globe. Some are more formal than others but the weapon is often given a descriptive name in the respective language.

== Design ==

A Molotov cocktail is a glass bottle containing a flammable substance such as petrol (gasoline), alcohol or a napalm-like mixture and a source of ignition, such as a burning cloth wick, held in place by the bottle&#x27;s stopper. The wick is usually soaked in alcohol or kerosene rather than petrol. For winter warfare, a method of ignition has been to attach storm matches to the side of the bottle, as these are less likely to be put out by wind. Some examples are fitted with ballast for improved throwing accuracy (such as filling of the bottle with sand).

In action, the wick/match is lit and the bottle hurled at a target such as a vehicle or fortification. When the bottle smashes on impact, the ensuing cloud of fuel droplets and vapour is ignited by the attached wick, causing an immediate fireball followed by spreading flames as the remainder of the fuel is consumed.

Other flammable liquids, such as diesel fuel, methanol, turpentine, jet fuel, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol (rubbing alcohol), have been used in place of, or combined with, petrol. Thickening agents, such as solvents, extruded polystyrene (XPS) foam (known colloquially as styrofoam), baking soda, petroleum jelly, tar, strips of tyre tubing, nitrocellulose, motor oil, rubber cement, detergent and dish soap, have been added to promote adhesion of the burning liquid and to create clouds of thick, choking smoke. There also exist variations on the Molotov cocktail-concept where the bottle is filled with a smoke generating mixture such as sulfur trioxide dissolved in chlorosulfonic acid. These so-called &quot;smoke bottles&quot; do not need a source for ignition, as the mixture reacts with the air once the bottle is smashed.

== Development and use in war ==
=== Spanish Civil War ===

Improvised incendiary devices of this type were used in warfare for the first time in the Spanish Civil War between July 1936 and April 1939, before they became known as &quot;Molotov cocktails&quot;. In 1936, General Francisco Franco ordered Spanish Nationalist forces to use the weapon against Soviet T-26 tanks supporting the Spanish Republicans in a failed assault on the Nationalist stronghold of Seseña, near Toledo, south of Madrid. After that, both sides used simple petrol bombs set fire with toxic gas or petrol-soaked blankets with some success. Tom Wintringham, a veteran of the International Brigades, later publicised his recommended method of using them:

=== Khalkhin Gol ===
The Battle of Khalkhin Gol, a border conflict of 1939 ostensibly between Mongolia and Manchukuo, saw heavy fighting between Japanese and Soviet forces. Short of anti-tank equipment, Japanese infantry attacked Soviet tanks with gasoline-filled bottles. Japanese infantrymen claimed that several hundred Soviet tanks had been destroyed this way, though Soviet loss records do not support this assessment.

=== World War II ===

==== Finland ====

On 30 November 1939, the Soviet Union attacked Finland, starting what came to be known as the Winter War. The Finnish perfected the design and tactical use of the petrol bomb. The fuel for the Molotov cocktail was refined to a slightly sticky mixture of alcohol, kerosene, tar, and potassium chlorate. Further refinements included the attachment of wind-proof matches or a phial of chemicals that would ignite on breakage, thereby removing the need to pre-ignite the bottle, and leaving the bottle about one-third empty was found to make breaking more likely.

A British War Office report dated June 1940 noted that:
Molotov cocktails were eventually mass-produced by the Alko corporation at its Rajamäki distillery, bundled with matches to light them. A bottle was filled with a mixture of petrol and paraffin, plus a small amount of tar. The basic bottle had two long pyrotechnic storm matches attached to either side. Before use, one or both of the matches were lit; when the bottle broke on impact, the mixture ignited. The storm matches were found to be safer to use than a burning rag on the mouth of the bottle. There was also an &quot;A bottle&quot;. This replaced the matches with a small ampoule inside the bottle; it ignited when the bottle broke. By spring 1940 they had produced 542,104 bottles.

==== Great Britain ====
Early in 1940, with the prospect of immediate invasion, the possibilities of the petrol bomb gripped the imagination of the British public. For laypersons, the petrol bomb had the benefit of using entirely familiar and available materials, and they were quickly improvised in large numbers, with the intention of using them against enemy tanks.

The Finns had found that they were effective when used in the right way and in sufficient numbers. Although the experience of the Spanish Civil War received more publicity, the more sophisticated petroleum warfare tactics of the Finns were not lost on British commanders. In his 5 June address to LDV leaders, General Ironside said:

Wintringham advised that a tank that was isolated from supporting infantry was potentially vulnerable to men who had the required determination and cunning to get close. Rifles or even a shotgun would be sufficient to persuade the crew to close all the hatches, and then the view from the tank is very limited; a turret-mounted machine gun has a very slow traverse and cannot hope to fend off attackers coming from all directions. Once sufficiently close, it is possible to hide where the tank&#x27;s gunner cannot see: &quot;The most dangerous distance away from a tank is 200 yards; the safest distance is six inches.&quot; Petrol bombs will soon produce a pall of blinding smoke, and a well-placed explosive package or even a stout iron bar in the tracks can immobilise the vehicle, leaving it at the mercy of further petrol bombs – which will suffocate the engine and possibly the crew – or an explosive charge or anti-tank mine.

By August 1940, the War Office produced training instructions for the creation and use of Molotov cocktails. The instructions suggested scoring the bottles vertically with a diamond to ensure breakage and providing fuel-soaked rag, windproof matches or a length of cinema film (then composed of highly flammable nitrocellulose) as a source of ignition.

On 29 July 1940, manufacturers Albright &amp; Wilson of Oldbury demonstrated to the RAF how their white phosphorus could be used to ignite incendiary bombs. The demonstration involved throwing glass bottles containing a mixture of petrol and phosphorus at pieces of wood and into a hut. On breaking, the phosphorus was exposed to the air and spontaneously ignited; the petrol also burned, resulting in a fierce fire. Because of safety concerns, the RAF was not interested in white phosphorus as a source of ignition, but the idea of a self-igniting petrol bomb took hold. Initially known as an A.W. bomb, it was officially named the No. 76 Grenade, but more commonly known as the SIP (Self-Igniting Phosphorus) grenade. The perfected list of ingredients was white phosphorus, benzene, water and a two-inch strip of raw rubber; all in a half-pint bottle sealed with a crown stopper. Over time, the rubber would slowly dissolve, making the contents slightly sticky, and the mixture would separate into two layers – this was intentional, and the grenade should not be shaken to mix the layers, as this would only delay ignition. When thrown against a hard surface, the glass would shatter and the contents would instantly ignite, liberating choking fumes of phosphorus pentoxide and sulfur dioxide as well as producing a great deal of heat. Strict instructions were issued to store the grenades safely, preferably underwater and certainly never in a house. Mainly issued to the Home Guard as an anti-tank weapon, it was produced in vast numbers; by August 1941 well over 6,000,000 had been manufactured.

There were many who were sceptical about the efficacy of Molotov cocktails and SIPs grenades against the more modern German tanks. Weapon designer Stuart Macrae witnessed a trial of the SIPs grenade at Farnborough: &quot;There was some concern that, if the tank drivers could not pull up quickly enough and hop out, they were likely to be frizzled to death, but after looking at the bottles they said they would be happy to take a chance.&quot; The drivers were proved right, trials on modern British tanks confirmed that Molotov and SIP grenades caused the occupants of the tanks &quot;no inconvenience whatsoever.&quot;

Wintringham, though enthusiastic about improvised weapons, cautioned against a reliance on petrol bombs and repeatedly emphasised the importance of using explosive charges.

==== United States ====
The US army designated Molotov cocktails as frangible grenades. They presented a notable amount of variations, from those that used thin fuel with varied ignition systems, to those that used obscurants and chemical weapons. Various frangible grenade designs were developed, with those investiged by the NDRC showing the highest technological level. These incendiary devices employed the most technologically advanced fillers in the conflict.

The M1 frangible grenade was the standard US device, but each division of the army could come up with its own. Two non-industrial models of these grenades were developed and manufactured in a certain quantity. In all, about five thousand were manufactured. The frangible grenades featured standardized chemical igniters, some were specific to each flammable filler.

Most of the frangible devices were made in an improvised way, with no standardization regarding the bottle and filling. The frangible grenades were eventually declared obsolete, due to the very limited destructive effect.

1107 frangible, M1, NP type were supplied to the navy and its units for field use at Iwo Jima. The United States Marine Corps developed a version during World War II that used a tube of nitric acid and a lump of metallic sodium to ignite a mixture of petrol and diesel fuel.

==== Other fronts of World War II ====
The Polish Home Army developed a version which ignited on impact without the need of a wick. Ignition was caused by a reaction between concentrated sulfuric acid mixed with the fuel and a mixture of potassium chlorate and sugar which was crystallized from solution onto a rag attached to the bottle.

During the Norwegian campaign in 1940 the Norwegian Army lacking suitable anti-tank weaponry had to rely on petrol bombs and other improvised weapons to fight German armored vehicles. Instructions from Norwegian High Command sent to army units in April 1940 encouraged soldiers to start ad-hoc production of &quot;Hitler cocktails&quot; (a different take on the Finnish nickname for the weapon) to combat tanks and armored cars. During the campaign there were instances of petrol bombs being relatively effective against the lighter tanks employed in Norway by Germany, such as the Panzer I and Panzer II.

=== The Troubles ===
During the Troubles, both the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) and civilians used petrol bombs, although with different uses. Civilians tended to use petrol bombs and rocks against police officers in riots; however, the PIRA tended to use them in attacks rather than in self-defence. Over time, as the PIRA became more co-ordinated, it shifted to using IEDs rather than petrol bombs.

=== Modern warfare ===

During the Second Battle of Fallujah in 2004, U.S. Marines employed Molotov cocktails made with &quot;one part liquid laundry detergent, two parts gas [gasoline]&quot; while clearing houses &quot;when contact is made in a house and the enemy must be burned out&quot;. The tactic &quot;was developed in response to the enemy&#x27;s tactics&quot; of guerrilla warfare and particularly martyrdom tactics which often resulted in U.S. Marine casualties. The cocktail was a less expedient alternative to white phosphorus mortar rounds or propane tanks detonated with C4 (nicknamed the &quot;House Guest&quot;), all of which proved effective at burning out engaged enemy combatants.

During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry told civilians to make Molotov cocktails, locally called &quot;Bandera smoothies&quot;, to fight Russian troops. The defense ministry distributed a recipe for producing Molotov cocktails to civilians through Ukrainian television, which included the use of styrofoam as a thickening agent to aid in helping the burning liquid stick to vehicles or other targets. The Pravda Brewery of Lviv, which converted from making beer to Molotov cocktails, said that its recipe was &quot;3 cups polystyrene, 2 cups grated soap, 500 millilitres gasoline, 100 millilitres oil, 1 jumbo tampon fuse.&quot; The Russian media control organisation Roskomnadzor sued Twitter for not removing instructions for how to prepare and use molotov cocktails, so that Twitter had to pay a fine of 3 million roubles (US$41,000).

== Civilian use ==

Molotov cocktails were reportedly used in the United States for arson attacks on shops and other buildings during the 1992 Los Angeles riots.

Molotov cocktails were used by protesters and civilian militia in Ukraine during Euromaidan and the Revolution of Dignity. Protesters during the Ferguson riots also used Molotov cocktails.

In Bangladesh, during anti-government protests in 2013 and 2014, many buses and cars were targeted with petrol bombs. A number of people burned to death and many more were injured due to these attacks.

During the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests, riots broke out and Molotov cocktails were used to attack the police and create roadblocks. They were also used to attack an MTR station, causing severe damage. A journalist was also struck by a Molotov cocktail during the protests.

Molotov cocktails were used by some during the riots following the 2020 George Floyd protests in the United States.

=== Non-incendiary variants ===

During the 2014–17 Venezuelan protests, protesters used Molotov cocktails similar to those used by demonstrators in other countries. As the 2017 Venezuelan protests intensified, demonstrators began using &quot;Puputovs&quot; (a portmanteau of the words &quot;poo-poo&quot; and &quot;Molotov&quot;), with glass containers filled with excrement being thrown at authorities after the PSUV ruling-party official, Jacqueline Faría, mocked protesters who had to crawl through sewage in Caracas&#x27; Guaire River to avoid tear gas.

On 8 May, the hashtag #puputov became the top trending hashtag on Twitter in Venezuela, as reports of authorities vomiting after being drenched in excrement began to circulate. A month later, on 4 June 2017, during protests against Donald Trump in Portland, Oregon, police claimed protesters began throwing balloons filled with &quot;unknown, foul-smelling liquid&quot; at officers.

== Legality ==

As incendiary devices, Molotov cocktails are illegal to manufacture or possess in many regions. In the United States, Molotov cocktails are considered &quot;destructive devices&quot; under the National Firearms Act and are regulated by the ATF. Wil Casey Floyd, from Elkhart Lake, Wisconsin, was arrested after throwing Molotov cocktails at Seattle police officers during a protest in May 2016; he pleaded guilty for using the incendiary devices in February 2018.

In Simpson County, Kentucky, 20-year-old Trey Alexander Gwathney-Law attempted to burn Franklin-Simpson County Middle School with five Molotov cocktails; he was found guilty of making and possessing illegal firearms and was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2018.

== Symbolism ==

Due to the Molotov&#x27;s ease of production and use by civilian forces, the Molotov cocktail has become a symbol of civil uprising and revolution. The Molotov&#x27;s extensive use by civilian, and partisan forces has also thereby led to the Molotov becoming a symbol representing civil unrest. The contrast of a Molotov cocktail and an organized force has become a popular symbol in popular culture, and is often utilized as a weapon in various video games.

<text>Matzah, matzo, or maẓẓah (&quot;,&quot; : matzot or Ashk. matzos) is an unleavened flatbread that is part of Jewish cuisine and forms an integral element of the Passover festival, during which &quot;chametz&quot; (leaven and five grains that, per Jewish law, are self-leavening) is forbidden.

As the Torah recounts, God commanded the Israelites (modernly, Jews and Samaritans) to eat only unleavened bread during the seven-day Passover festival. Matzah can be either soft like a pita or crispy. The crispy variety is widely produced commercially because of its long shelf life. The soft matzah needs to be frozen if it is to last more than a day or so, and very limited commercial production is available, and only in the period leading up to Passover. Some versions of the crisper type are available all year.

Matzah meal and matzah cake meal is crispy matzah that has been ground very finely. The cake meal has a near flour-like consistency, useful in baking, while the standard matzah meal is somewhat coarser and used in cooking. Matzah meal is used to make matzah balls (kneidles/kneidlach), the principal ingredient of kneydlach soup (oft-translated as &quot;matzah ball soup&quot;). Sephardic Jews typically cook with matzah itself rather than matzah meal.

Matzah that is kosher for Passover is limited in Ashkenazi tradition to plain matzah made from flour and water. The flour may be whole grain or refined grain, but must be made from one of five grains: wheat, spelt, barley, rye, or oat. Some Sephardic communities allow matzah to be made with eggs or fruit juice to be used throughout the holiday, while Ashkenazi Jews do not use such matzah on Passover, except in special circumstances (generally, the sick and elderly).

==Biblical sources==
&quot;Matzah&quot; is mentioned in the Torah several times in relation to The Exodus from Egypt:

==Religious significance==
There are numerous explanations behind the symbolism of matzah:

* Passover is a commemoration of the exodus from Egypt. The biblical narrative relates that the Israelites left Egypt in such haste they could not wait for their bread dough to rise; the bread, when baked, was matzah. 

* Matzah symbolizes redemption and freedom, but it is also called &quot;lechem oni&quot;, &quot;poor man&#x27;s bread&quot;. Thus it serves as a reminder to be humble, and to not forget what life was like in servitude. Also, leaven symbolizes corruption and pride as leaven &quot;puffs up&quot;. Eating the &quot;bread of affliction&quot; is both a lesson in humility and an act that enhances the appreciation of freedom.

* The Passover sacrifice was once required to be eaten together with matzah (and maror). Since the destruction of the Temple this sacrifice is not offered, but the final matzah eaten at the seder is considered a reminder of the Passover sacrifice. This matzah is called afikoman, and many explain it as a symbol of salvation in the future. The Passover Seder meal is full of symbols of salvation, including the closing line, &quot;Next year in Jerusalem&quot;, but the use of matzah is the oldest symbol of salvation in the Seder.

* Ancient Egypt was the first culture to produce leavened bread, and leavened bread was a symbol of Egyptian culture. Thus, the prohibition on eating leaven served as a rejection of ancient Egyptian culture.

* In ancient Israel, the barley harvest took place around Passover, while the wheat harvest took place several weeks later. Thus, poor people would eat barley around Passover (since that was the only food they possessed), while rich people would eat stored-up wheat. Since barley does not ferment well, the food of the poor would typically be unleavened. The requirement for everyone to eat unleavened bread at Passover promotes social equality, by forcing the rich and poor to eat the same kind of food as they celebrate the holiday together.

==Ingredients==

At the Passover seder, simple matzah made of flour and water is mandatory for all. The flour must be ground from one of the five grains specified in Jewish law for Passover matzah: wheat, barley, spelt, rye or oat. Per Ashkenazic tradition, matzah made with wine, fruit juice, onion, garlic, etc., is not acceptable for use at any time during the Passover festival except by the elderly or unwell.

Non-Passover matzah may be made with onion, garlic, poppy seed, etc. It can even be made from rice, maize, buckwheat and other non-traditional flours that can never be used for Passover matzah.

=== Gluten-free preparations ===
Some manufacturers produce gluten-free matzah-lookalike made from potato starch, tapioca, and other non-traditional flour to market to those who cannot safely eat gluten, such as those with coeliac disease. The Orthodox Union states that these gluten-free products may be eaten on Passover, but that they do not fulfill the commandment (&quot;mitzvah&quot;) of eating matzah at the Seder, because matzah must be made from one of the five grains (wheat, barley, oat, spelt, and rye).

The only one of the five grains that does not contain gluten is oat, but the resulting matzah would be gluten-free only if there were no cross-contamination with gluten-containing grains. In recent years, matzah manufacturers have begun producing gluten-free oat matzah certified kosher for Passover. Additionally, some authorities have expressed doubt about whether oat is properly listed among the five grains, or whether it resulted from a historical mistranslation. Therefore, some have suggested baking matzah from a mixture of 90% rice flour and 10% wheat flour, for those who can handle eating the small amount of wheat in this mixture. For those who can eat no wheat, eating oat matzah at the Seder is still considered the best option.
==Preparation==

Matzah dough is quickly mixed and rolled out without an autolyse step as used for leavened breads. Most forms are pricked with a fork or a similar tool to keep the finished product from puffing up, and the resulting flat piece of dough is cooked at high temperature until it develops dark spots, then set aside to cool and, if sufficiently thin, to harden to crispness. Dough is considered to begin the leavening process 18 minutes from the time it gets wet; sooner if eggs, fruit juice, or milk is added to the dough. The entire process of making matzah takes only a few minutes in efficient modern matzah bakeries.

After baking, matzah may be ground into fine crumbs, known as matzah meal. Matzah meal can be used like flour during the week of Passover when flour can otherwise be used only to make matzah.

==Variations==

There are two major forms of matzah. Prior to the late 18th century, all matzah was soft and relatively thick, but thinner, crisper matzah later became popular in parts of Europe due to its longer shelf life. With the invention of the first matzah-making machine in France in 1839, cracker-like mass-produced matzah became the most common form in Europe and North America and is now ubiquitous in all Ashkenazic and most Sephardic communities. Yemenite and Iraqi Jews continue to use a form of soft matzah which looks like Greek pita or like a tortilla. Soft matzah is made only by hand, and generally with &quot;shmurah&quot; flour.

Flavored varieties of matzah are produced commercially, such as poppy seed- or onion-flavored. Oat and spelt matzah with kosher certification are produced. Oat matzah is generally suitable for those who cannot eat gluten. Whole wheat, bran and organic matzah are also available. Chocolate-covered matzah is a favorite among children, although some consider it &quot;enriched matzah&quot; and will not eat it during the Passover holiday. A quite different flat confection of chocolate and nuts that resembles matzah is sometimes called &quot;chocolate matzah&quot;.

Mass-produced matzah contains typically 111 calories per 1-ounce/28g (USDA Nutrient Database), about the same as rye crispbread.

===Shmurah matzah===

&quot;Shĕmura&quot; (&quot;guarded&quot;) matzah ( &quot;matsa shĕmura&quot;) is made from grain that has been under special supervision from the time it was harvested to ensure that no fermentation has occurred, and that it is suitable for eating on the first night of Passover. (&quot;Shĕmura&quot; wheat may be formed into either handmade or machine-made matzah, while non-&quot;shĕmura&quot; wheat is only used for machine-made matzah. It is possible to hand-bake matzah in &quot;shĕmura&quot; style from non-shmurah flour—this is a matter of style, it is not actually in any way &quot;shĕmura&quot;—but such matzah has rarely been produced since the introduction of machine-made matzah.)

Haredi Judaism is scrupulous about the supervision of matzah and have the custom of baking their own or at least participating in some stage of the baking process. Rabbi Chaim Halberstam of Sanz ruled in the 19th century that machine-made matzah were chametz. According to that opinion, handmade non-&quot;shmurah&quot; matzah may be used on the eighth day of Passover outside of the Holy Land. However the non-Hasidic Haredi community of Jerusalem follows the custom that machine-made matzah may be used, with preference to the use of &quot;shĕmurah&quot; flour, in accordance with the ruling of Rabbi Yosef Chaim Sonnenfeld, who ruled that machine-made matzah may be preferable to hand made in some cases. The commentators to the Shulhan `Aruch record that it is the custom of some of Diaspora Jewry to be scrupulous in giving Hallah from the dough used for baking &quot;Matzat Mitzvah&quot; (the shĕmurah matzah eaten during Passover) to a Kohen child to eat.

===Egg matzah===
The requirement for eating Matzah at the Seder cannot be fulfilled with &quot;[egg] matza.&quot; 
&quot;Egg (sometimes &quot;enriched&quot;) matzah&quot; are matzot usually made with fruit juice, often grape juice or apple juice, instead of water, but not necessarily with eggs themselves. There is a custom among some Ashkenazi Jews not to eat them during Passover, except for the elderly, infirm, or children, who cannot digest plain matzah; these matzot are considered to be kosher for Passover if prepared otherwise properly. The issue of whether egg matzah is allowed for Passover comes down to whether there is a difference between the various liquids that can be used. Water facilitates a fermentation of grain flour specifically into what is defined as chametz, but the question is whether fruit juice, eggs, honey, oil or milk are also deemed to do so within the strict definitions of Jewish laws regarding chametz.

The &quot;Talmud&quot;, Pesachim 35a, states that liquid food extracts do not cause flour to leaven the way that water does. According to this view, flour mixed with other liquids would not need to be treated with the same care as flour mixed with water. The &quot;Tosafot&quot; (commentaries) explain that such liquids only produce a leavening reaction within flour &quot;if&quot; they themselves have had water added to them and otherwise the dough they produce is completely permissible for consumption during Passover, whether or not made according to the laws applying to matzot.

As a result, Joseph ben Ephraim Karo, author of the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; or &quot;Code of Jewish Law&quot; (Orach Chayim 462:4) granted blanket permission for the use of any matzah made from non-water-based dough, including egg matzah, on Passover. Many egg matzah boxes no longer include the message, &quot;Ashkenazi custom is that egg matzah is only allowed for children, elderly and the infirm during Passover.&quot; Even amongst those who consider that enriched matzot may not be &quot;eaten&quot; during Passover, it is permissible to &quot;retain&quot; it in the home.

====Chocolate-covered matzah====
Chocolate-covered matzah was sold in boxes as a standard product, alongside boxes of egg matzah.

The matzah itself is not &quot;Hamotzi&quot; (meaning that it is &quot;Mezonot&quot;).

== Cooking with matzah ==

Matzah may be used whole, broken, chopped (&quot;matzah farfel&quot;), or finely ground (&quot;matzah meal&quot;); to make numerous matzah-based cooked dishes. These include matzah balls, which are traditionally served in chicken soup; matzah brei, a dish of Ashkenazi origin made from matzah soaked in water, mixed with beaten egg, and fried; helzel, poultry neck skin stuffed with matzah meal; matzah pizza, in which the piece of matzah takes the place of pizza crust and is topped with melted cheese and sauce; and kosher for Passover cakes and cookies, which are made with matzah meal or a finer variety called &quot;cake meal&quot; that gives them a denser texture than ordinary baked foods made with flour. Hasidic Jews do not cook with matzah, believing that mixing it with water may allow leavening; this stringency is known as &quot;gebrochts&quot;. However, Jews who avoid eating &quot;gebrochts&quot; will eat cooked matzah dishes on the eighth day of Passover outside the Land of Israel, as the eighth day is of rabbinic and not Torah origin.

Sephardim use matzah soaked in water or stock to make pies or lasagne, known as &quot;mina&quot;, &quot;méguena&quot;, &quot;mayena&quot; or .

==In Christianity==
Communion wafers used by the Roman Catholic Church as well as in some Protestant traditions for the Eucharist are flat, unleavened bread. The main reason for the use of this bread is the belief that, because the Last Supper was described in the Synoptic Gospels as a Passover meal, the unleavened matzah bread was used by Jesus when he held it up and said &quot;this is my body&quot;. All Byzantine Rite churches use leavened bread for the Eucharist as this symbolizes the risen Christ.

Some Oriental Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Christians use leavened bread, as in the east there is the tradition, based upon the gospel of John, that leavened bread was on the table of the Last Supper. In the Armenian Apostolic Church, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, unleavened bread called &quot;qǝddus qurban&quot; in Ge&#x27;ez, the liturgical language of the Eritreans and Ethiopians, is used for communion.

Saint Thomas Christians living on the Malabar coast of Kerala, India have the customary celebration of Pesaha in their homes. On the evening before Good Friday, Pesaha bread is made at home. It is made with unleavened flour and they consume a sweet drink made up of coconut milk and jaggery along with this bread. On the Pesaha night, the bread is baked (steamed) immediately after rice flour is mixed with water and they pierce it many times with handle of the spoon to let out steam so that the bread will not rise (this custom is called &quot;juthante kannu kuthal&quot; in the Malayalam language meaning &quot;piercing the bread according to the custom of Jews&quot;). This bread is cut by the head of the family and shared among the family members.

==World War II==
At the end of World War II, the National Jewish Welfare Board had a matzah factory (according to the American Jewish Historical Society, it was probably the Manischewitz matzah factory in New Jersey) produce matzah in the form of a giant &quot;V&quot; for &quot;Victory&quot;, for shipment to military bases overseas and in the U.S., for Passover seders for Jewish military personnel. Passover in 1945 began on 1 April, when the collapse of the Axis in Europe was clearly imminent; Nazi Germany surrendered five weeks later.

&quot;Streit&#x27;s&quot; is the story of the last family-owned matzah bakery in America during their final year at their historic New York City factory.

<text>Michel Tremblay (born 25 June 1942) is a Canadian writer, novelist and playwright.

Tremblay was born in Montreal, Quebec, where he grew up in the French-speaking neighbourhood of Plateau Mont-Royal; at the time of his birth, a neighbourhood with a working-class character and joual dialect - something that would heavily influence his work. Tremblay&#x27;s first professionally produced play, &quot;Les Belles-Sœurs&quot;, was written in 1965 and premiered at the Théâtre du Rideau Vert on August 28, 1968. It transformed the old guard of Canadian theatre and introduced joual to the mainstream. It stirred up controversy by portraying the lives of working-class women and attacking the strait-laced, deeply religious society of mid-20th century Quebec.

==Career and impact==
Tremblay&#x27;s early plays, including &quot;Hosanna&quot; and &quot;La Duchesse de Langeais&quot;, challenged the boundaries of French Canadian society. Until the Quiet Revolution of the early 1960s, Tremblay saw Quebec as a poor, working-class province dominated by an English-speaking elite and the Roman Catholic Church. Tremblay&#x27;s work was part of a vanguard of liberal, nationalist thought that helped create an essentially modern society. His most famous plays are usually centred on gay characters. The first Canadian play about and starring a drag queen was his play &quot;Hosanna&quot;, which was first performed at Théâtre de Quat&#x27;Sous in Montreal in 1973.

The women in his plays are usually strong but possessed with demons they must vanquish. It is said he sees Quebec as a matriarchal society. He is considered one of the best playwrights for women. In the late 1980s, &quot;Les Belles-sœurs&quot; (&quot;The Sisters-in-Law&quot;) was produced in Scotland in Scots, as &quot;The Guid-Sisters&quot; (&quot;guid-sister&quot; being Scots for &quot;sister-in-law&quot;). His work has been translated into many languages, including Yiddish, and including such works as &quot;Sainte-Carmen de la Main&quot;, &quot;Ç&#x27;ta ton tour, Laura Cadieux&quot;, and &quot;Forever Yours, Marilou&quot; (&quot;À toi pour toujours, ta Marie-Lou&quot;).

He has been openly gay throughout his public life, and he has written many novels (&quot;The Duchess and the Commoner&quot;, &quot;La nuit des princes charmants&quot;, &quot;Le Coeur découvert&quot;, &quot;Le Coeur éclaté&quot;) and plays (&quot;Hosanna&quot;, &quot;La duchesse de Langeais&quot;, &quot;Fragments de mensonges inutiles&quot;) centred on gay characters. In a 1987 interview with Shelagh Rogers for CBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;The Arts Tonight&quot;, he remarked that he has always avoided behaviours he has considered masculine; for example, he does not smoke and he noted that he was 45 years old and did not know how to drive a car. &quot;I think I am a rare breed,&quot; he said, &quot;A homosexual who doesn&#x27;t like men.&quot; He claims one of his biggest regrets in life was not telling his mother that he was gay before she died.

His latest play to receive wide acclaim is &quot;For the Pleasure of Seeing Her Again&quot;, a comedic and nostalgic play, centred on the memories of his mother. He later published the Plateau Mont-Royal Chronicles, a cycle of six novels including &quot;The Fat Woman Next Door is Pregnant&quot; (&quot;La grosse femme d&#x27;à côté est enceinte&quot;, 1978) and &quot;The Duchess and the Commoner&quot; (&quot;La duchesse et le roturier&quot;, 1982). The second novel of this series, &quot;Therese and Pierrette and the Little Hanging Angel&quot; (&quot;Thérèse et Pierrette à l&#x27;école des Saints-Anges&quot;, 1980), was one of the novels chosen for inclusion in the French version of &quot;Canada Reads&quot;, &quot;Le combat des livres&quot;, broadcast on Radio-Canada in 2005, where it was championed by union activist Monique Simard.

Tremblay also worked on a television series entitled &quot;Le Cœur découvert&quot; (&quot;The Heart Laid Bare&quot;), about the lives of a gay couple in Quebec, for the French-language TV network Radio-Canada. In 2005 he completed another novel cycle, the &quot;Cahiers&quot; (&quot;Le Cahier noir&quot; (translated as &quot;The Black Notebook&quot;), &quot;Le Cahier rouge&quot;, &quot;Le Cahier bleu&quot;), dealing with the changes that occurred in 1960s Montreal during the Quiet Revolution. In 2009 &quot;The Fat Woman Next Door&quot; was a finalist in CBC&#x27;s prestigious Canada Reads competition.

==Political views==
For many years, Tremblay has believed that the only reasonable solution for Quebec is to separate from Canada. Once the Parti Québécois was elected in Quebec, he softened his views on allowing his plays to be produced in English there. He made it clear, however, that that did not mean that he agreed with bilingualism, calling it &quot;stupid&quot; and stating that he thought it ridiculous to expect a housewife in Vancouver to be fluent in both English and French.

Despite his often outspoken views in public, Tremblay&#x27;s treatment of politics in his plays is subtle. Speaking of politics and the theatre in an CBC interview in 1978, Tremblay said:
In April 2006 he declared that he did not support the arguments put forward for the separation of Quebec. But he clarified his thoughts some time later by saying he was still a supporter of Quebec sovereignty, though critical of the actual state of the debate, which in his opinion was too much focused on economic issues. In response to this, the columnist Marc Cassivi of &quot;La Presse&quot; wrote that &quot;there was only one closet a Quebec artist could never exit and that was the federalist one.&quot;

==Awards and honours==
Tremblay has received numerous awards in recognition of his work. These include the &quot;Prix Victor-Morin&quot; (1974), the &quot;Prix France-Québec&quot; (1984), the Chalmers Award (1986) and the Molson Prize (1994).

He received the Lieutenant-Governor&#x27;s award for Ontario in 1976 and 1977. Tremblay was named the &quot;Montréalais le plus remarquable des deux dernières décennies dans le domaine du théâtre&quot; (the most remarkable Montrealer of the past two decades in theatre) (1978). In 1991 he was appointed &quot;Officier de l&#x27;Ordre de France,&quot; and in the same year, &quot;Chevalier de l&#x27;Ordre National du Québec.&quot; He is also a recipient of the &quot;Chevalier de l&#x27;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres de France&quot; (1994).

In 1999, Tremblay received a Governor General&#x27;s Performing Arts Award, Canada&#x27;s highest honour in the performing arts. This produced controversy when several well-known Quebec nationalists suggested that he should refuse the award. While he did not do this, he did admit, for the first time, that he had refused the Order of Canada in 1990.

In 2000, &quot;Encore une fois, si vous le permettez&quot; (&quot;For The Pleasure of Seeing Her Again&quot;) won a Chalmers Award and a Dora Mavor Moore Award.

In 2024, a plaza-playground in the Plateau-Mont-Royal was named Place de l&#x27;Ange-Cornu in honour of Tremblay&#x27;s book &quot;Un ange cornu avec des ailes de tôle&quot;.

<text>In machine learning, supervised learning (SL) is a paradigm where a model is trained using input objects (e.g. a vector of predictor variables) and desired output values (also known as a &quot;supervisory signal&quot;), which are often human-made labels. The training process builds a function that maps new data to expected output values. An optimal scenario will allow for the algorithm to accurately determine output values for unseen instances. This requires the learning algorithm to generalize from the training data to unseen situations in a reasonable way (see inductive bias). This statistical quality of an algorithm is measured via a &quot;generalization error&quot;.

== Steps to follow ==

To solve a given problem of supervised learning, the following steps must be performed:

# Determine the type of training samples. Before doing anything else, the user should decide what kind of data is to be used as a training set. In the case of handwriting analysis, for example, this might be a single handwritten character, an entire handwritten word, an entire sentence of handwriting, or a full paragraph of handwriting.
# Gather a training set. The training set needs to be representative of the real-world use of the function. Thus, a set of input objects is gathered together with corresponding outputs, either from human experts or from measurements.
# Determine the input feature representation of the learned function. The accuracy of the learned function depends strongly on how the input object is represented. Typically, the input object is transformed into a feature vector, which contains a number of features that are descriptive of the object. The number of features should not be too large, because of the curse of dimensionality; but should contain enough information to accurately predict the output.
# Determine the structure of the learned function and corresponding learning algorithm. For example, one may choose to use support-vector machines or decision trees.
# Complete the design. Run the learning algorithm on the gathered training set. Some supervised learning algorithms require the user to determine certain control parameters. These parameters may be adjusted by optimizing performance on a subset (called a &quot;validation set&quot;) of the training set, or via cross-validation.
# Evaluate the accuracy of the learned function. After parameter adjustment and learning, the performance of the resulting function should be measured on a test set that is separate from the training set.

== Algorithm choice ==

A wide range of supervised learning algorithms are available, each with its strengths and weaknesses. There is no single learning algorithm that works best on all supervised learning problems (see the No free lunch theorem).

There are four major issues to consider in supervised learning:

=== Bias–variance tradeoff ===
A first issue is the tradeoff between &quot;bias&quot; and &quot;variance&quot;. Imagine that we have available several different, but equally good, training data sets. A learning algorithm is biased for a particular input formula_1 if, when trained on each of these data sets, it is systematically incorrect when predicting the correct output for formula_1. A learning algorithm has high variance for a particular input formula_1 if it predicts different output values when trained on different training sets. The prediction error of a learned classifier is related to the sum of the bias and the variance of the learning algorithm. Generally, there is a tradeoff between bias and variance. A learning algorithm with low bias must be &quot;flexible&quot; so that it can fit the data well. But if the learning algorithm is too flexible, it will fit each training data set differently, and hence have high variance. A key aspect of many supervised learning methods is that they are able to adjust this tradeoff between bias and variance (either automatically or by providing a bias/variance parameter that the user can adjust).

===Function complexity and amount of training data===

The second issue is of the amount of training data available relative to the complexity of the &quot;true&quot; function (classifier or regression function). If the true function is simple, then an &quot;inflexible&quot; learning algorithm with high bias and low variance will be able to learn it from a small amount of data. But if the true function is highly complex (e.g., because it involves complex interactions among many different input features and behaves differently in different parts of the input space), then the function will only be able to learn with a large amount of training data paired with a &quot;flexible&quot; learning algorithm with low bias and high variance.

===Dimensionality of the input space===

A third issue is the dimensionality of the input space. If the input feature vectors have large dimensions, learning the function can be difficult even if the true function only depends on a small number of those features. This is because the many &quot;extra&quot; dimensions can confuse the learning algorithm and cause it to have high variance. Hence, input data of large dimensions typically requires tuning the classifier to have low variance and high bias. In practice, if the engineer can manually remove irrelevant features from the input data, it will likely improve the accuracy of the learned function. In addition, there are many algorithms for feature selection that seek to identify the relevant features and discard the irrelevant ones. This is an instance of the more general strategy of dimensionality reduction, which seeks to map the input data into a lower-dimensional space prior to running the supervised learning algorithm.

===Noise in the output values===

A fourth issue is the degree of noise in the desired output values (the supervisory target variables). If the desired output values are often incorrect (because of human error or sensor errors), then the learning algorithm should not attempt to find a function that exactly matches the training examples. Attempting to fit the data too carefully leads to overfitting. You can overfit even when there are no measurement errors (stochastic noise) if the function you are trying to learn is too complex for your learning model. In such a situation, the part of the target function that cannot be modeled &quot;corrupts&quot; your training data - this phenomenon has been called deterministic noise. When either type of noise is present, it is better to go with a higher bias, lower variance estimator.

In practice, there are several approaches to alleviate noise in the output values such as early stopping to prevent overfitting as well as detecting and removing the noisy training examples prior to training the supervised learning algorithm. There are several algorithms that identify noisy training examples and removing the suspected noisy training examples prior to training has decreased generalization error with statistical significance.

===Other factors to consider===

Other factors to consider when choosing and applying a learning algorithm include the following:

* Heterogeneity of the data. If the feature vectors include features of many different kinds (discrete, discrete ordered, counts, continuous values), some algorithms are easier to apply than others. Many algorithms, including support-vector machines, linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, and nearest neighbor methods, require that the input features be numerical and scaled to similar ranges (e.g., to the [-1,1] interval). Methods that employ a distance function, such as nearest neighbor methods and support-vector machines with Gaussian kernels, are particularly sensitive to this. An advantage of decision trees is that they easily handle heterogeneous data.
* Redundancy in the data. If the input features contain redundant information (e.g., highly correlated features), some learning algorithms (e.g., linear regression, logistic regression, and distance-based methods) will perform poorly because of numerical instabilities. These problems can often be solved by imposing some form of regularization.
* Presence of interactions and non-linearities. If each of the features makes an independent contribution to the output, then algorithms based on linear functions (e.g., linear regression, logistic regression, support-vector machines, naive Bayes) and distance functions (e.g., nearest neighbor methods, support-vector machines with Gaussian kernels) generally perform well. However, if there are complex interactions among features, then algorithms such as decision trees and neural networks work better, because they are specifically designed to discover these interactions. Linear methods can also be applied, but the engineer must manually specify the interactions when using them.

When considering a new application, the engineer can compare multiple learning algorithms and experimentally determine which one works best on the problem at hand (see cross-validation). Tuning the performance of a learning algorithm can be very time-consuming. Given fixed resources, it is often better to spend more time collecting additional training data and more informative features than it is to spend extra time tuning the learning algorithms.

===Algorithms===

The most widely used learning algorithms are: 
*Support-vector machines
*Linear regression
*Logistic regression
*Naive Bayes
*Linear discriminant analysis
*Decision trees
*&quot;k&quot;-nearest neighbors algorithm
*Neural networks (e.g., Multilayer perceptron)
*Similarity learning

==How supervised learning algorithms work==

Given a set of formula_4 training examples of the form formula_5 such that formula_6 is the feature vector of the formula_7-th example and formula_8 is its label (i.e., class), a learning algorithm seeks a function formula_9, where formula_10 is the input space and formula_11 is the output space. The function formula_12 is an element of some space of possible functions formula_13, usually called the &quot;hypothesis space&quot;. It is sometimes convenient to represent formula_12 using a scoring function formula_15 such that formula_12 is defined as returning the formula_17 value that gives the highest score: formula_18. Let formula_19 denote the space of scoring functions.

Although formula_13 and formula_19 can be any space of functions, many learning algorithms are probabilistic models where formula_12 takes the form of a conditional probability model formula_23, or formula_24 takes the form of a joint probability model formula_25. For example, naive Bayes and linear discriminant analysis are joint probability models, whereas logistic regression is a conditional probability model.

There are two basic approaches to choosing formula_24 or formula_12: empirical risk minimization and structural risk minimization. Empirical risk minimization seeks the function that best fits the training data. Structural risk minimization includes a &quot;penalty function&quot; that controls the bias/variance tradeoff.

In both cases, it is assumed that the training set consists of a sample of independent and identically distributed pairs, formula_28. In order to measure how well a function fits the training data, a loss function formula_29 is defined. For training example formula_30, the loss of predicting the value formula_31 is formula_32.

The &quot;risk&quot; formula_33 of function formula_12 is defined as the expected loss of formula_12. This can be estimated from the training data as

:formula_36.

===Empirical risk minimization===
In empirical risk minimization, the supervised learning algorithm seeks the function formula_12 that minimizes formula_33. Hence, a supervised learning algorithm can be constructed by applying an optimization algorithm to find formula_12.

When formula_12 is a conditional probability distribution formula_41 and the loss function is the negative log likelihood: formula_42, then empirical risk minimization is equivalent to maximum likelihood estimation.

When formula_13 contains many candidate functions or the training set is not sufficiently large, empirical risk minimization leads to high variance and poor generalization. The learning algorithm is able to memorize the training examples without generalizing well (overfitting).

===Structural risk minimization===

Structural risk minimization seeks to prevent overfitting by incorporating a regularization penalty into the optimization. The regularization penalty can be viewed as implementing a form of Occam&#x27;s razor that prefers simpler functions over more complex ones.

A wide variety of penalties have been employed that correspond to different definitions of complexity. For example, consider the case where the function formula_12 is a linear function of the form

:formula_45.

A popular regularization penalty is formula_46, which is the squared Euclidean norm of the weights, also known as the formula_47 norm. Other norms include the formula_48 norm, formula_49, and the formula_50 &quot;norm&quot;, which is the number of non-zero formula_51s. The penalty will be denoted by formula_52.

The supervised learning optimization problem is to find the function formula_12 that minimizes

:formula_54

The parameter formula_55 controls the bias-variance tradeoff. When formula_56, this gives empirical risk minimization with low bias and high variance. When formula_55 is large, the learning algorithm will have high bias and low variance. The value of formula_55 can be chosen empirically via cross-validation.

The complexity penalty has a Bayesian interpretation as the negative log prior probability of formula_12, formula_60, in which case formula_61 is the posterior probability of formula_12.

==Generative training==

The training methods described above are &quot;discriminative training&quot; methods, because they seek to find a function formula_12 that discriminates well between the different output values (see discriminative model). For the special case where formula_25 is a joint probability distribution and the loss function is the negative log likelihood formula_65 a risk minimization algorithm is said to perform &quot;generative training&quot;, because formula_24 can be regarded as a generative model that explains how the data were generated. Generative training algorithms are often simpler and more computationally efficient than discriminative training algorithms. In some cases, the solution can be computed in closed form as in naive Bayes and linear discriminant analysis.

==Generalizations==

There are several ways in which the standard supervised learning problem can be generalized:
* Semi-supervised learning or weak supervision: the desired output values are provided only for a subset of the training data. The remaining data is unlabeled or imprecisely labeled.
* Active learning: Instead of assuming that all of the training examples are given at the start, active learning algorithms interactively collect new examples, typically by making queries to a human user. Often, the queries are based on unlabeled data, which is a scenario that combines semi-supervised learning with active learning.
* Structured prediction: When the desired output value is a complex object, such as a parse tree or a labeled graph, then standard methods must be extended.
* Learning to rank: When the input is a set of objects and the desired output is a ranking of those objects, then again the standard methods must be extended.

<text>Martin Helwig () (5 November 1516 – 26 January 1574) was a German cartographer of Silesia and pedagogue. He was born in Neisse and died in Breslau, Holy Roman Empire.

==Life==
A former pupil of an eminent German scholar and educationist Valentin Friedland, Helwig went on to study at the University of Wittenberg, where as a student of Martin Luther and Philip Melanchthon he earned the academic degree of Magister. In 1552, he became Rector of St. Maria Magdalena School in Breslau (now Wrocław, in Poland). Equally proficient in mathematics and geography as well as classical languages, he produced the first woodcut map of Silesia made on the basis of surveys and data collected from local inhabitants, which he published in 1561 under the title &quot;Silesiae Typus&quot;, and dedicated to Nicolaus II. Rehdiger, a wealthy Silesian merchant, banker, philanthropist, governor and patron of the principality of Breslau sponsored the map. Martin Helwig&#x27;s map went on to receive acclaim in a public writing by Caspar Peucer, an eminent German scholar at the University of Wittenberg, and was later republished in several versions of Abraham Ortelius&#x27;s pioneering world atlas, &quot;Theatrum Orbis Terrarum&quot;.

The first map of Silesia by Martin Helwig constituted until the middle of the 18th century the main model and source of information for the cartographical presentation of this region of Europe on the maps of the most famous cartographers and publishers of those times.

<doc id="20934" wikidata="Q947369" url="?curid=20934" title="Macro virus">
<text>In computing terminology, a macro virus is a virus that is written in a macro language: a programming language which is embedded inside a software application (e.g., word processors and spreadsheet applications). Some applications, such as Microsoft Office, Excel, PowerPoint allow macro programs to be embedded in documents such that the macros are run automatically when the document is opened, and this provides a distinct mechanism by which malicious computer instructions can spread. This is one reason it can be dangerous to open unexpected attachments in e-mails. Many antivirus programs can detect macro viruses; however, the macro virus&#x27; behavior can still be difficult to detect.

== Fundamentals ==
A macro is a series of commands and actions that helps automating some tasks - usually a quite short and simple program. However they are created, they need to be executed by some system which interprets the stored commands. Some macro systems are self-contained programs, but others are built into complex applications (for example word processors) to allow users to repeat sequences of commands easily, or to allow developers to tailor the application to local needs.

== Operation ==

A macro virus can be spread through e-mail attachments, removable media, networks and the Internet, and is notoriously difficult to detect. A common way for a macro virus to infect a computer is by replacing normal macros with a virus. The macro virus replaces regular commands with the same name and runs when the command is selected. These malicious macros may start automatically when a document is opened or closed, without the user&#x27;s knowledge.

Once a file containing a macro virus is opened, the virus can infect the system. When triggered, it will begin to embed itself in other documents and templates. It may corrupt other parts of the system, depending on what resources a macro in this application can access. When the infected documents are shared with other users and systems, the virus spreads. Macro viruses have been used as a method of installing software on a system without the user&#x27;s consent, as they can be used to download and install software from the internet through the use of automated key-presses. However, this is uncommon as it is usually not fruitful for the virus coder since the installed software is usually noticed and uninstalled by the user.

Since a macro virus depends on the application rather than the operating system, it can infect a computer running any operating system to which the targeted application has been ported. In particular, since Microsoft Word is available on Macintosh computers, word macro viruses can attack some Macs in addition to Windows platforms.

An example of a macro virus is the Melissa virus which appeared in March 1999. When a user opens a Microsoft Word document containing the Melissa virus, their computer becomes infected. The virus then sends itself by email to the first 50 people in the person&#x27;s address book. This made the virus replicate at a fast rate.

Not all macro viruses are detected by antivirus software. Caution when opening email attachments and other documents decreases the chance of becoming infected.

Due to the prevalence of macro viruses, starting with Microsoft Office 2007, Microsoft assigned a separate set of file extensions ending in &quot;m&quot; to Office files containing macros in order to prevent users from opening macro virus-infected files that were not intended to contain macros in the first place.

Current versions of Microsoft Office block macros by default in files originating from the internet, a change that first appeared in April 2022.

<text>Microsoft Access is a database management system (DBMS) from Microsoft that combines the relational Access Database Engine (ACE) with a graphical user interface and software-development tools. It is a member of the Microsoft 365 suite of applications, included in the Professional and higher editions or sold separately.

Microsoft Access stores data in its own format based on the Access Database Engine (formerly Jet Database Engine). It can also import or link directly to data stored in other applications and databases.

Software developers, data architects and power users can use Microsoft Access to develop application software. Like other Microsoft Office applications, Access is supported by Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), an object-based programming language that can reference a variety of objects including the legacy DAO (Data Access Objects), ActiveX Data Objects, and many other ActiveX components. Visual objects used in forms and reports expose their methods and properties in the VBA programming environment, and VBA code modules may declare and call Windows operating system operations.

==History==

Prior to the introduction of Access, Borland (with Paradox), Ashton-Tate (with dBase, acquired by Borland in 1991) and Fox (with FoxPro) dominated the desktop database market. Microsoft Access was the first mass-market database program for Windows. With Microsoft&#x27;s purchase of FoxPro in 1992 and the incorporation of Fox&#x27;s Rushmore query optimization routines into Access, Microsoft Access quickly became the dominant database for Windows—effectively eliminating the competition which failed to transition from the MS-DOS world. In the 1980s, Microsoft Access referred to an unrelated telecommunication program that provided terminal emulation and interfaces for ease of use in accessing online services such as Dow Jones, CompuServe and electronic mailbox.

===Project Omega===

Microsoft&#x27;s first attempt to sell a relational database product was during the mid-1980s, when Microsoft obtained the license to sell . In the late 1980s Microsoft developed its own solution codenamed Omega. It was confirmed in 1988 that a database product for Windows and OS/2 was in development. It was going to include the &quot;EB&quot; Embedded Basic language, which was going to be the language for writing macros in all Microsoft applications, but the unification of macro languages did not happen until the introduction of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). Omega was also expected to provide a front end to the Microsoft SQL Server. The application was very resource-intensive, and there were reports that it was working slowly on the 386 processors that were available at the time. It was scheduled to be released in the 1st quarter of 1990, but in 1989 the development of the product was reset and it was rescheduled to be delivered no sooner than in January 1991. Parts of the project were later used for other Microsoft projects: Cirrus (codename for Access) and Thunder (codename for Visual Basic, where the Embedded Basic engine was used). After Access&#x27;s premiere, the Omega project was demonstrated in 1992 to several journalists and included features that were not available in Access.

===Project Cirrus===

After the Omega project was scrapped, some of its developers were assigned to the Cirrus project (most were assigned to the team which created Visual Basic). Its goal was to create a competitor for applications like Paradox or dBase that would work on Windows. After Microsoft acquired FoxPro, there were rumors that the Microsoft project might get replaced with it, but the company decided to develop them in parallel. It was assumed that the project would make use of Extensible Storage Engine (Jet Blue) but, in the end, only support for Jet Database Engine (Jet Red) was provided. The project used some of the code from both the Omega project and a pre-release version of Visual Basic. In July 1992, betas of Cirrus shipped to developers and the name Access became the official name of the product. &quot;Access&quot; was originally used for an older terminal emulation program from Microsoft. Years after the program was abandoned, they decided to reuse the name here.

===Timeline===

Microsoft released Access version 1.0 on November 13, 1992, and an Access 1.1 release in May 1993 to improve compatibility with other Microsoft products and to include the Access Basic programming language.

With Access v2.0, Microsoft specified the minimum hardware requirements to be Microsoft Windows v3.1 with 4 MB of RAM required, 6 MB RAM recommended; 8 MB of available hard disk space required, 14 MB hard disk space recommended. The product shipped on seven 1.44 MB diskettes. The manual shows a 1994 copyright date.

As a part of the Microsoft Office 4.3 Professional with Book Shelf, Microsoft Access 2.0 was included with first sample databases &quot;NorthWind Trader&quot; which covered every possible aspect of programming a database. The Northwind Traders sample first introduced the Main Switchboard features new to Access 2.0 for 1994.
The photo of Andrew Fuller, record #2 of that sample database, was the individual that presented and worked with Microsoft to provide such an outstanding example database.

With Office 95, Microsoft Access 7.0 (a.k.a. &quot;Access 95&quot;) became part of the Microsoft Office Professional Suite, joining Microsoft Excel, Word, and PowerPoint and transitioning from Access Basic to VBA. Since then, Microsoft has released new versions of Microsoft Access with each release of Microsoft Office. This includes Access 97 (version 8.0), Access 2000 (version 9.0), Access 2002 (version 10.0), Access 2003 (version 11.5), Access 2007 (version 12.0), Access 2010 (version 14.0), Access 2013 (version 15.0), and Access 2016 (version 16.0).

Versions 3.0 and 3.5 of Jet Database Engine (used by Access 7.0 and the later-released Access 97, respectively) had a critical issue which made these versions of Access unusable on a computer with more than 1 GB of memory. While Microsoft fixed this problem for Jet 3.5/Access 97 post-release, it never fixed the issue with Jet 3.0/Access 95.

The native Access database format (the Jet MDB Database) has also evolved over the years. Formats include Access 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 7.0, 97, 2000, 2002, and 2007. The most significant transition was from the Access 97 to the Access 2000 format; which is not backward compatible with earlier versions of Access. all newer versions of Access support the Access 2000 format. New features were added to the Access 2002 format which can be used by Access 2002, 2003, 2007, and 2010.

Microsoft Access 2000 increased the maximum database size to 2 GB from 1 GB in Access 97.

Microsoft Access 2007 introduced a new database format: ACCDB. It supports links to SharePoint lists and complex data types such as multi-value and attachment fields. These new field types are essentially recordsets in fields and allow the storage of multiple values or files in one field. Microsoft Access 2007 also introduced File Attachment field, which stored data more efficiently than the OLE (Object Linking and Embedding) field.

Microsoft Access 2010 introduced a new version of the ACCDB format supported hosting Access Web services on a SharePoint 2010 server. For the first time, this allowed Access applications to be run without having to install Access on a user&#x27;s PC and was the first support for Mac users. Any user on the SharePoint site with sufficient rights could use the Access Web service. A copy of Access was still required for the developer to create the Access Web service, and the desktop version of Access remained part of Access 2010. The Access Web services were not the same as the desktop applications. Automation was only through the macro language (not VBA) which Access automatically converted to JavaScript. The data was no longer in an Access database but SharePoint lists. An Access desktop database could link to the SharePoint data, so hybrid applications were possible so that SharePoint users needing basic views and edits could be supported while the more sophisticated, traditional applications could remain in the desktop Access database.

Microsoft Access 2013 offers traditional Access desktop applications plus a significantly updated SharePoint 2013 web service. The Access Web model in Access 2010 was replaced by a new architecture that stores its data in actual SQL Server databases. Unlike SharePoint lists, this offers true relational database design with referential integrity, scalability, extensibility and performance one would expect from SQL Server. The database solutions that can be created on SharePoint 2013 offer a modern user interface designed to display multiple levels of relationships that can be viewed and edited, along with resizing for different devices and support for touch. The Access 2013 desktop is similar to Access 2010 but several features were discontinued including support for Access Data Projects (ADPs), pivot tables, pivot charts, Access data collections, source code control, replication, and other legacy features. Access desktop database maximum size remained 2 GB (as it has been since the 2000 version).

Microsoft Access is no longer included in the one-time-purchase version of Microsoft Office 2021, but remains within the Microsoft 365 counterpart, as Apps for business and Business Standard editions. Features new to Access 2021 include an extended-precision date/time data type and dark theme support.

In addition to using its own database storage file, Microsoft Access also may be used as the &#x27;front-end&#x27; of a program while other products act as the &#x27;back-end&#x27; tables, such as Microsoft SQL Server and non-Microsoft products such as Oracle and Sybase. Multiple backend sources can be used by a Microsoft Access Jet Database (ACCDB and MDB formats). Similarly, some applications such as Visual Basic, ASP.NET, or Visual Studio .NET will use the Microsoft Access database format for its tables and queries. Microsoft Access may also be part of a more complex solution, where it may be integrated with other technologies such as Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Word, Microsoft PowerPoint and ActiveX controls.

Access tables support a variety of standard field types, indices, and referential integrity including cascading updates and deletes. Access also includes a query interface, forms to display and enter data, and reports for printing. The underlying Access database, which contains these objects, is multi-user and handles record-locking.

Repetitive tasks can be automated through macros with point and click options. It is also easy to place a database on a network and have multiple users share and update data without overwriting each other&#x27;s work. Data is locked at the record level which is significantly different from Excel which locks the entire spreadsheet.

There are template databases within the program and for download from Microsoft&#x27;s website. These options are available upon starting Access and allow users to enhance a database with predefined tables, queries, forms, reports, and macros. Database templates support VBA code, but Microsoft&#x27;s templates do not include VBA code.

Programmers can create solutions using VBA, which is similar to Visual Basic 6.0 (VB6) and used throughout the Microsoft Office programs such as Excel, Word, Outlook and PowerPoint. Most VB6 code, including the use of Windows API calls, can be used in VBA. Power users and developers can extend basic end-user solutions to a professional solution with advanced automation, data validation, error trapping, and multi-user support.

The number of simultaneous users that can be supported depends on the amount of data, the tasks being performed, level of use, and application design. Generally accepted limits are solutions with 1 GB or less of data (Access supports up to 2 GB) and it performs quite well with 100 or fewer simultaneous connections (255 concurrent users are supported). This capability is often a good fit for department solutions. If using an Access database solution in a multi-user scenario, the application should be &quot;split&quot;. This means that the tables are in one file called the back end (typically stored on a shared network folder) and the application components (forms, reports, queries, code, macros, linked tables) are in another file called the front end. The linked tables in the front end point to the back end file. Each user of the Access application would then receive his or her own copy of the front end file.

Applications that run complex queries or analysis across large datasets would naturally require greater bandwidth and memory. Microsoft Access is designed to to support more data and users by linking to multiple Access databases or using a back-end database like Microsoft SQL Server. With the latter design, the amount of data and users can scale to enterprise-level solutions.

Microsoft Access&#x27;s role in web development prior to version 2010 is limited. User interface features of Access, such as forms and reports, only work in Windows. In versions 2000 through 2003 an Access object type called Data Access Pages created publishable web pages. Data Access Pages are no longer supported. The Jet Database Engine, core to Access, can be accessed through technologies such as ODBC or OLE DB. The data (i.e., tables and queries) can be accessed by web-based applications developed in ASP.NET, PHP, or Java. With the use of Microsoft&#x27;s Terminal Services and Remote Desktop Application in Windows Server 2008 R2, organizations can host Access applications so they can be run over the web. This technique does not scale the way a web application would but is appropriate for a limited number of users depending on the configuration of the host.

Access 2010 allows databases to be published to SharePoint 2010 web sites running Access Services. These web-based forms and reports run in any modern web browser. The resulting web forms and reports, when accessed via a web browser, do not require any add-ins or extensions (e.g., ActiveX and Silverlight).

Access 2013 can create web applications directly in SharePoint 2013 sites running Access Services. Access 2013 web solutions store its data in an underlying SQL Server database which is much more scalable and robust than the Access 2010 version which used SharePoint lists to store its data.

Access Services in SharePoint has since been retired.

A compiled version of an Access database (file extensions .MDE /ACCDE or .ADE; ACCDE only works with Access 2007 or later) can be created to prevent users from accessing the design surfaces to modify module code, forms, and reports. An MDE or ADE file is a Microsoft Access database file with all modules compiled and all editable source code removed. Both the .MDE and .ADE versions of an Access database are used when end-user modifications are not allowed or when the application&#x27;s source code should be kept confidential.

Microsoft also offers developer extensions for download to help distribute Access 2007 applications, create database templates, and integrate source code control with Microsoft Visual SourceSafe.

==Features==

Users can create tables, queries, forms and reports, and connect them together with macros. Advanced users can use VBA to write rich solutions with advanced data manipulation and user control. Access also has report creation features that can work with any data source that Access can access.

The original concept of Access was for end users to be able to access data from any source. Other features include: the import and export of data to many formats including Excel, Outlook, ASCII, dBase, Paradox, FoxPro, SQL Server and Oracle. It also has the ability to link to data in its existing location and use it for viewing, querying, editing, and reporting. This allows the existing data to change while ensuring that Access uses the latest data. It can perform heterogeneous joins between data sets stored across different platforms. Access is often used by people downloading data from enterprise level databases for manipulation, analysis, and reporting locally.

There is also the Access Database (ACE and formerly Jet) format (MDB or ACCDB in Access 2007) which can contain the application and data in one file. This makes it very convenient to distribute the entire application to another user, who can run it in disconnected environments.

One of the benefits of Access from a programmer&#x27;s perspective is its relative compatibility with SQL (structured query language)—queries can be viewed graphically or edited as SQL statements, and SQL statements can be used directly in Macros and VBA Modules to manipulate Access tables. Users can mix and use both VBA and &quot;Macros&quot; for programming forms and logic and offers object-oriented possibilities. VBA can also be included in queries.

Microsoft Access offers parameterized queries. These queries and Access tables can be referenced from other programs like VB6 and .NET through DAO or ADO. From Microsoft Access, VBA can reference parameterized stored procedures via ADO.

The desktop editions of Microsoft SQL Server can be used with Access as an alternative to the Jet Database Engine. This support started with MSDE (Microsoft SQL Server Desktop Engine), a scaled down version of Microsoft SQL Server 2000, and continues with the SQL Server Express versions of SQL Server 2005 and 2008.

Microsoft Access is a file server-based database. Unlike client–server relational database management systems (RDBMS), Microsoft Access does not implement database triggers, stored procedures, or transaction logging. Access 2010 includes table-level triggers and stored procedures built into the ACE data engine. Thus a Client-server database system is not a requirement for using stored procedures or table triggers with Access 2010.
Tables, queries, forms, reports and macros can now be developed specifically for web based applications in Access 2010. Integration with Microsoft SharePoint 2010 is also highly improved.

The 2013 edition of Microsoft Access introduced a mostly flat design and the ability to install apps from the Office Store, but it did not introduce new features. The theme was partially updated again for 2016, but no dark theme was created for Access.

=== Access Services and Web database ===
ASP.NET web forms can query a Microsoft Access database, retrieve records and display them on the browser.

SharePoint Server 2010 via Access Services allows for Access 2010 databases to be published to SharePoint, thus enabling multiple users to interact with the database application from any standards-compliant Web browser. Access Web databases published to SharePoint Server can use standard objects such as tables, queries, forms, macros, and reports. Access Services stores those objects in SharePoint.

Access 2013 offers the ability to publish Access web solutions on SharePoint 2013. Rather than using SharePoint lists as its data source, Access 2013 uses an actual SQL Server database hosted by SharePoint or SQL Azure. This offers a true relational database with referential integrity, scalability, maintainability, and extensibility compared to the SharePoint views Access 2010 used. The macro language is enhanced to support more sophisticated programming logic and database level automation.

===Import or link sources===
Microsoft Access can also import or link directly to data stored in other applications and databases. Microsoft Office Access 2007 and newer can import from or link to:
* Microsoft Access
* Excel
* SharePoint lists
* Plain text
* XML
* Outlook
* HTML
* dBase (dropped in Access 2013; restored in Access 2016)
* Paradox (with Access 2007; dropped in Access 2010)
* Lotus 1-2-3 (dropped in Access 2010)
* ODBC-compliant data containers, including:
** Microsoft SQL Server
** Oracle
** MySQL
** PostgreSQL
** IBM Lotus Notes
** IBM i IBM Db2

==Microsoft Access Runtime==
Microsoft offers free runtime versions of Microsoft Access which allow users to run an Access desktop application without needing to purchase or install a retail version of Microsoft Access. This actually allows Access developers to create databases that can be freely distributed to an unlimited number of end-users. These runtime versions of Access 2007 and later can be downloaded for free from Microsoft. The runtime versions for Access 2003 and earlier were part of the Office Developer Extensions/Toolkit and required a separate purchase.

The runtime version allows users to view, edit and delete data, along with running queries, forms, reports, macros and VBA module code. The runtime version does not allow users to change the design of Microsoft Access tables, queries, forms, reports, macros or module code. The runtime versions are similar to their corresponding full version of Access and usually compatible with earlier versions; for example Access Runtime 2010 allows a user to run an Access application made with the 2010 version as well as 2007 through 2000. Due to deprecated features in Access 2013, its runtime version is also unable to support those older features. During development one can simulate the runtime environment from the fully functional version by using the codice_1 command-line option.

==Development==
Access stores all database tables, queries, forms, reports, macros, and modules in the Access Jet database as a single file.

For query development, Access offers a &quot;Query Designer&quot;, a graphical user interface that allows users to build queries without knowledge of structured query language. In the Query Designer, users can &quot;show&quot; the datasources of the query (which can be tables or queries) and select the fields they want returned by clicking and dragging them into the grid. One can set up joins by clicking and dragging fields in tables to fields in other tables. Access allows users to view and manipulate the SQL code if desired. Any Access table, including linked tables from different data sources, can be used in a query.

Access also supports the creation of &quot;pass-through queries&quot;. These snippets of SQL code can address external data sources through the use of ODBC connections on the local machine. This enables users to interact with data stored outside the Access program without using linked tables or Jet.
Users construct the pass-through queries using the SQL syntax supported by the external data source.

When developing reports (in &quot;Design View&quot;) additions or changes to controls cause any linked queries to execute in the background and the designer is forced to wait for records to be returned before being able to make another change. This feature cannot be turned off.

Non-programmers can use the macro feature to automate simple tasks through a series of drop-down selections. Macros allow users to easily chain commands together such as running queries, importing or exporting data, opening and closing forms, previewing and printing reports, etc. Macros support basic logic (IF-conditions) and the ability to call other macros. Macros can also contain sub-macros which are similar to subroutines. In Access 2007, enhanced macros included error-handling and support for temporary variables. Access 2007 also introduced embedded macros that are essentially properties of an object&#x27;s event. This eliminated the need to store macros as individual objects. However, macros were limited in their functionality by a lack of programming loops and advanced coding logic until Access 2013. With significant further enhancements introduced in Access 2013, the capabilities of macros became fully comparable to VBA. They made feature rich web-based application deployments practical, via a greatly enhanced Microsoft SharePoint interface and tools, as well as on traditional Windows desktops.

In common with other products in the Microsoft Office suite, the other programming language used in Access is Microsoft VBA. It is similar to Visual Basic 6.0 (VB6) and code can be stored in modules, classes, and code behind forms and reports. To create a richer, more efficient and maintainable finished product with good error handling, most professional Access applications are developed using the VBA programming language rather than macros, except where web deployment is a business requirement.

To manipulate data in tables and queries in VBA or macros, Microsoft provides two database access libraries of COM components:

# Data Access Objects (DAO) (32-bit only), which is included in Access and Windows and evolved to ACE in Microsoft Access 2007 for the ACCDE database format
# ActiveX Data Objects ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) (both 32-bit and 64-bit versions)

As well as DAO and ADO, developers can also use OLE DB and ODBC for developing native C/C++ programs for Access. For ADPs and the direct manipulation of SQL Server data, ADO is required. DAO is most appropriate for managing data in Access/Jet databases, and the only way to manipulate the complex field types in ACCDB tables.

In the database container or navigation pane in Access 2007 and later versions, the system automatically categorizes each object by type (e.g., table, query, macro). Many Access developers use the Leszynski naming convention, though this is not universal; it is a programming convention, not a DBMS-enforced rule. It is particularly helpful in VBA where references to object names may not indicate its data type (e.g. tbl for tables, qry for queries).

Developers deploy Microsoft Access most often for individual and workgroup projects (the Access 97 speed characterization was done for 32 users). Since Access 97, and with Access 2003 and 2007, Microsoft Access and hardware have evolved significantly. Databases under 1 GB in size (which can now fit entirely in RAM) and 200 simultaneous users are well within the capabilities of Microsoft Access. Of course, performance depends on the database design and tasks. Disk-intensive work such as complex searching and querying take the most time.

As data from a Microsoft Access database can be cached in RAM, processing speed may substantially improve when there is only a single user or if the data is not changing. In the past, the effect of packet latency on the record-locking system caused Access databases to run slowly on a virtual private network (VPN) or a wide area network (WAN) against a Jet database. broadband connections have mitigated this issue. Performance can also be enhanced if a continuous connection is maintained to the back-end database throughout the session rather than opening and closing it for each table access.

In July 2011, Microsoft acknowledged an intermittent query performance problem with all versions of Access and Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 due to the nature of resource management being vastly different in newer operating systems. This issue severely affects query performance on both Access 2003 and earlier with the Jet Database Engine code, as well as Access 2007 and later with the Access Database Engine (ACE). Microsoft has issued hotfixes KB2553029 for Access 2007 and KB2553116 for Access 2010, but will not fix the issue with Jet 4.0 as it is out of mainstream support.

In earlier versions of Microsoft Access, the ability to distribute applications required the purchase of the Developer Toolkit; in Access 2007, 2010 and Access 2013 the &quot;Runtime Only&quot; version is offered as a free download, making the distribution of royalty-free applications possible on Windows XP, Vista, 7 and Windows 8.x.

===Split database architecture===
Microsoft Access applications can adopt a split-database architecture. The single database can be divided into a separate &quot;back-end&quot; file that contains the data tables (shared on a file server) and a &quot;front-end&quot; (containing the application&#x27;s objects such as queries, forms, reports, macros, and modules). The &quot;front-end&quot; Access application is distributed to each user&#x27;s desktop and linked to the shared database. Using this approach, each user has a copy of Microsoft Access (or the runtime version) installed on their machine along with their application database. This reduces network traffic since the application is not retrieved for each use. The &quot;front-end&quot; database can still contain local tables for storing a user&#x27;s settings or temporary data. This split-database design also allows development of the application independent of the data. One disadvantage is that users may make various changes to their own local copy of the application and this makes it hard to manage version control. When a new version is ready, the front-end database is replaced without impacting the data database. Microsoft Access has two built-in utilities, Database Splitter and Linked Table Manager, to facilitate this architecture.

Linked tables in Access use absolute paths rather than relative paths, so the development environment either has to have the same path as the production environment or a &quot;dynamic-linker&quot; routine can be written in VBA.

For very large Access databases, this may have performance issues and a SQL backend should be considered in these circumstances. This is less of an issue if the entire database can fit in the PC&#x27;s RAM since Access caches data and indexes.

===Migration to SQL Server===
To scale Access applications to enterprise or web solutions, one possible technique involves migrating to Microsoft SQL Server or equivalent server database. A client–server design significantly reduces maintenance and increases security, availability, stability, and transaction logging.

Access 2000 through Access 2010 included a feature called the Upsizing Wizard that allowed users to upgrade their databases to Microsoft SQL Server, an ODBC client–server database. This feature was removed from Access 2013. An additional solution, the SQL Server Migration Assistant for Access (SSMA), continues to be available for free download from Microsoft.

A variety of upgrading options are available. After migrating the data and queries to SQL Server, the Access database can be linked to the SQL database, subject to data type conversion limitations: 
*&quot;Yes/No&quot; types: In Microsoft Access there are three states for the Yes/No (True/False) data type: empty, no/false (0) and yes/true (−1). The corresponding SQL Server data type is binary, with only two states; the permissible values are 0 and 1. 
*Date/Time (Extended): SQL Server&#x27;s smalldatetime format has precision of 1 minute, minimum date value is 1900-01-01, maximum date value is 2079-06-06; datetime format has precision of 10/3 milliseconds (rounded to increments of .000, .003, or .007 seconds), minimum date value is 1753-01-01, maximum date value is 9999-12-31; datetime2 format has precision of 100 nanoseconds, minimum date value is 0001-01-01, same maximum date value as datetime. Access&#x27;s Date/Time and Date/Time Extended have higher precisions than smalldatetime and datetime and datetime2, and wider date range than SQL Server&#x27;s smalldatetime and datetime formats.
Regardless, SQL Server is still the easiest migration. Retrieving data from linked tables is optimized to just the records needed, but this scenario may operate less efficiently than what would otherwise be optimal for SQL Server. For example, in instances where multi-table joins still require copying the whole table across the network.

In previous versions of Access, including Access 2010, databases can also be converted to Access Data Projects (ADP) which are tied directly to one SQL Server database. This feature was removed from Access 2013. ADP&#x27;s support the ability to directly create and modify SQL Server objects such as tables, views, stored procedures, and SQL Server constraints. The views and stored procedures can significantly reduce the network traffic for multi-table joins. SQL Server supports temporary tables and links to other data sources beyond the single SQL Server database.

Finally, some Access databases are completely replaced by another technology such as ASP.NET or Java once the data is converted. However, any migration may dictate major effort since the Access SQL language is a more powerful superset of standard SQL. Further, Access application procedures, whether VBA and macros, are written at a relatively higher level versus the currently available alternatives that are both robust and comprehensive. The Access macro language, allowing an even higher level of abstraction than VBA, was significantly enhanced in Access 2010 and again in Access 2013.

In many cases, developers build direct web-to-data interfaces using ASP.NET, while keeping major business automation processes, administrative and reporting functions that do not need to be distributed to everyone in Access for information workers to maintain.

While all Access data can migrate to SQL Server directly, some queries cannot migrate successfully. In some situations, you may need to translate VBA functions and user defined functions into T–SQL or .NET functions / procedures. Crosstab queries can be migrated to SQL Server using the PIVOT command.

== Protection ==
Microsoft Access applications can be made secure by various methods, the most basic being password access control; this is a relatively weak form of protection.

A higher level of protection is the use of workgroup security requiring a user name and password. Users and groups can be specified along with their rights at the object type or individual object level. This can be used to specify people with read-only or data entry rights but may be challenging to specify. A separate workgroup security file contains the settings which can be used to manage multiple databases. Workgroup security is not supported in the Access 2007 and Access 2010 ACCDB database format, although Access 2007 and Access 2010 still support it for MDB databases.

Databases can also be encrypted. The ACCDB format offers significantly advanced encryption from previous versions.

Additionally, if the database design needs to be secured to prevent changes, Access databases can be locked/protected (and the source code compiled) by converting the database to a .MDE file. All changes to the VBA project (modules, forms, or reports) need to be made to the original MDB and then reconverted to MDE. In Access 2007 and Access 2010, the ACCDB database is converted to an ACCDE file. Some tools are available for unlocking and &quot;decompiling&quot;, although certain elements including original VBA comments and formatting are normally irretrievable.

==File extensions==

Microsoft Access saves information under the following file formats:


== Versions ==
There are no Access versions between 2.0 and 7.0 because the Office 95 version was launched with Word 7. All of the Office 95 products have OLE 2 capabilities, and Access 7 shows that it was compatible with Word 7.

Version number 13 was skipped.

<doc id="20941" wikidata="Q68685" url="?curid=20941" title="Metabolic pathway">
<text>In biochemistry, a metabolic pathway is a linked series of chemical reactions occurring within a cell. The reactants, products, and intermediates of an enzymatic reaction are known as metabolites, which are modified by a sequence of chemical reactions catalyzed by enzymes. In most cases of a metabolic pathway, the product of one enzyme acts as the substrate for the next. However, side products are considered waste and removed from the cell.

Different metabolic pathways function in the position within a eukaryotic cell and the significance of the pathway in the given compartment of the cell. For instance, the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation all take place in the mitochondrial membrane. In contrast, glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, and fatty acid biosynthesis all occur in the cytosol of a cell.

There are two types of metabolic pathways that are characterized by their ability to either synthesize molecules with the utilization of energy (anabolic pathway), or break down complex molecules and release energy in the process (catabolic pathway).

The two pathways complement each other in that the energy released from one is used up by the other. The degradative process of a catabolic pathway provides the energy required to conduct the biosynthesis of an anabolic pathway. In addition to the two distinct metabolic pathways is the amphibolic pathway, which can be either catabolic or anabolic based on the need for or the availability of energy.

Pathways are required for the maintenance of homeostasis within an organism and the flux of metabolites through a pathway is regulated depending on the needs of the cell and the availability of the substrate. The end product of a pathway may be used immediately, initiate another metabolic pathway or be stored for later use. The metabolism of a cell consists of an elaborate network of interconnected pathways that enable the synthesis and breakdown of molecules (anabolism and catabolism).

==Overview==
Each metabolic pathway consists of a series of biochemical reactions that are connected by their intermediates: the products of one reaction are the substrates for subsequent reactions, and so on. Metabolic pathways are often considered to flow in one direction. Although all chemical reactions are technically reversible, conditions in the cell are often such that it is thermodynamically more favorable for flux to proceed in one direction of a reaction. For example, one pathway may be responsible for the synthesis of a particular amino acid, but the breakdown of that amino acid may occur via a separate and distinct pathway. One example of an exception to this &quot;rule&quot; is the metabolism of glucose. Glycolysis results in the breakdown of glucose, but several reactions in the glycolysis pathway are reversible and participate in the re-synthesis of glucose (gluconeogenesis).
* Glycolysis was the first metabolic pathway discovered:
# As glucose enters a cell, it is immediately phosphorylated by ATP to glucose 6-phosphate in the irreversible first step.
# In times of excess lipid or protein energy sources, certain reactions in the glycolysis pathway may run in reverse to produce glucose 6-phosphate, which is then used for storage as glycogen or starch.
* Metabolic pathways are often regulated by feedback inhibition.
* Some metabolic pathways flow in a &#x27;cycle&#x27; wherein each component of the cycle is a substrate for the subsequent reaction in the cycle, such as in the Krebs Cycle (see below).
* Anabolic and catabolic pathways in eukaryotes often occur independently of each other, separated either physically by compartmentalization within organelles or separated biochemically by the requirement of different enzymes and co-factors.

==Major metabolic pathways==


===Catabolic pathway (catabolism)===
A catabolic pathway is a series of reactions that bring about a net release of energy in the form of a high energy phosphate bond formed with the energy carriers adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and guanosine diphosphate (GDP) to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and guanosine triphosphate (GTP), respectively. The net reaction is, therefore, thermodynamically favorable, for it results in a lower free energy for the final products. A catabolic pathway is an exergonic system that produces chemical energy in the form of ATP, GTP, NADH, NADPH, FADH2, etc. from energy containing sources such as carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. The end products are often carbon dioxide, water, and ammonia. Coupled with an endergonic reaction of anabolism, the cell can synthesize new macromolecules using the original precursors of the anabolic pathway. An example of a coupled reaction is the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate to form the intermediate fructose-1,6-bisphosphate by the enzyme phosphofructokinase accompanied by the hydrolysis of ATP in the pathway of glycolysis. The resulting chemical reaction within the metabolic pathway is highly thermodynamically favorable and, as a result, irreversible in the cell.

&lt;chem&gt;Fructose-6-Phosphate + ATP -&gt; Fructose-1,6-Bisphosphate + ADP&lt;/chem&gt;

====Cellular respiration====
A core set of energy-producing catabolic pathways occur within all living organisms in some form. These pathways transfer the energy released by breakdown of nutrients into ATP and other small molecules used for energy (e.g. GTP, NADPH, FADH2). All cells can perform anaerobic respiration by glycolysis. Additionally, most organisms can perform more efficient aerobic respiration through the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. Additionally plants, algae and cyanobacteria are able to use sunlight to anabolically synthesize compounds from non-living matter by photosynthesis.
===Anabolic pathway (anabolism)===
In contrast to catabolic pathways, anabolic pathways require an energy input to construct macromolecules such as polypeptides, nucleic acids, proteins, polysaccharides, and lipids. The isolated reaction of anabolism is unfavorable in a cell due to a positive Gibbs free energy (+Δ&quot;G&quot;). Thus, an input of chemical energy through a coupling with an exergonic reaction is necessary. The coupled reaction of the catabolic pathway affects the thermodynamics of the reaction by lowering the overall activation energy of an anabolic pathway and allowing the reaction to take place. Otherwise, an endergonic reaction is non-spontaneous.

An anabolic pathway is a biosynthetic pathway, meaning that it combines smaller molecules to form larger and more complex ones. An example is the reversed pathway of glycolysis, otherwise known as gluconeogenesis, which occurs in the liver and sometimes in the kidney to maintain proper glucose concentration in the blood and supply the brain and muscle tissues with adequate amount of glucose. Although gluconeogenesis is similar to the reverse pathway of glycolysis, it contains four distinct enzymes(pyruvate carboxylase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase, glucose 6-phosphatase) from glycolysis that allow the pathway to occur spontaneously.

===Amphibolic pathway (Amphibolism)===
An amphibolic pathway is one that can be either catabolic or anabolic based on the availability of or the need for energy. The currency of energy in a biological cell is adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which stores its energy in the phosphoanhydride bonds. The energy is utilized to conduct biosynthesis, facilitate movement, and regulate active transport inside of the cell. Examples of amphibolic pathways are the citric acid cycle and the glyoxylate cycle. These sets of chemical reactions contain both energy producing and utilizing pathways. To the right is an illustration of the amphibolic properties of the TCA cycle.

The glyoxylate shunt pathway is an alternative to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, for it redirects the pathway of TCA to prevent full oxidation of carbon compounds, and to preserve high energy carbon sources as future energy sources. This pathway occurs only in plants and bacteria and transpires in the absence of glucose molecules.

==Regulation==

The flux of the entire pathway is regulated by the rate-determining steps. These are the slowest steps in a network of reactions. The rate-limiting step occurs near the beginning of the pathway and is regulated by feedback inhibition, which ultimately controls the overall rate of the pathway. The metabolic pathway in the cell is regulated by covalent or non-covalent modifications. A covalent modification involves an addition or removal of a chemical bond, whereas a non-covalent modification (also known as allosteric regulation) is the binding of the regulator to the enzyme via hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interactions, and Van der Waals forces.

The rate of turnover in a metabolic pathway, also known as the metabolic flux, is regulated based on the stoichiometric reaction model, the utilization rate of metabolites, and the translocation pace of molecules across the lipid bilayer. The regulation methods are based on experiments involving 13C-labeling, which is then analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) or gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS)–derived mass compositions. The aforementioned techniques synthesize a statistical interpretation of mass distribution in proteinogenic amino acids to the catalytic activities of enzymes in a cell.

==Clinical applications in targeting metabolic pathways==

===Targeting oxidative phosphorylation===
Metabolic pathways can be targeted for clinically therapeutic uses. Within the mitochondrial metabolic network, for instance, there are various pathways that can be targeted by compounds to prevent cancer cell proliferation. One such pathway is oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) within the electron transport chain (ETC). Various inhibitors can downregulate the electrochemical reactions that take place at Complex I, II, III, and IV, thereby preventing the formation of an electrochemical gradient and downregulating the movement of electrons through the ETC. The substrate-level phosphorylation that occurs at ATP synthase can also be directly inhibited, preventing the formation of ATP that is necessary to supply energy for cancer cell proliferation. Some of these inhibitors, such as lonidamine and atovaquone, which inhibit Complex II and Complex III, respectively, are currently undergoing clinical trials for FDA approval. Other non-FDA-approved inhibitors have still shown experimental success in vitro.

===Targeting Heme===

Heme, an important prosthetic group present in Complexes I, II, and IV can also be targeted, since heme biosynthesis and uptake have been correlated with increased cancer progression. Various molecules can inhibit heme via different mechanisms. For instance, succinylacetone has been shown to decrease heme concentrations by inhibiting δ-aminolevulinic acid in murine erythroleukemia cells. The primary structure of heme-sequestering peptides, such as HSP1 and HSP2, can be modified to downregulate heme concentrations and reduce proliferation of non-small lung cancer cells.

===Targeting the tricarboxylic acid cycle and glutaminolysis===
The tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) and glutaminolysis can also be targeted for cancer treatment, since they are essential for the survival and proliferation of cancer cells. Ivosidenib and enasidenib, two FDA-approved cancer treatments, can arrest the TCA cycle of cancer cells by inhibiting isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) and isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 (IDH2), respectively. Ivosidenib is specific to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and cholangiocarcinoma, whereas enasidenib is specific to just acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

In a clinical trial consisting of 185 adult patients with cholangiocarcinoma and an IDH-1 mutation, there was a statistically significant improvement (p&lt;0.0001; HR: 0.37) in patients randomized to ivosidenib. Still, some of the adverse side effects in these patients included fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, decreased appetite, ascites, and anemia. In a clinical trial consisting of 199 adult patients with AML and an IDH2 mutation, 23% of patients experienced complete response (CR) or complete response with partial hematologic recovery (CRh) lasting a median of 8.2 months while on enasidenib. Of the 157 patients who required transfusion at the beginning of the trial, 34% no longer required transfusions during the 56-day time period on enasidenib. Of the 42% of patients who did not require transfusions at the beginning of the trial, 76% still did not require a transfusion by the end of the trial. Side effects of enasidenib included nausea, diarrhea, elevated bilirubin and, most notably, differentiation syndrome.

Glutaminase (GLS), the enzyme responsible for converting glutamine to glutamate via hydrolytic deamidation during the first reaction of glutaminolysis, can also be targeted. In recent years, many small molecules, such as azaserine, acivicin, and CB-839 have been shown to inhibit glutaminase, thus reducing cancer cell viability and inducing apoptosis in cancer cells. Due to its effective antitumor ability in several cancer types such as ovarian, breast and lung cancers, CB-839 is the only GLS inhibitor currently undergoing clinical studies for FDA-approval.

== Genetic engineering of metabolic pathways ==
Many metabolic pathways are of commercial interest. For instance, the production of many antibiotics or other drugs requires complex pathways. The pathways to produce such compounds can be transplanted into microbes or other more suitable organism for production purposes. For example, the world&#x27;s supply of the anti-cancer drug vinblastine is produced by relatively ineffient extraction and purification of the precursors vindoline and catharanthine from the plant &quot;Catharanthus roseus&quot;, which are then chemically converted into vinblastine. The biosynthetic pathway to produce vinblastine, including 30 enzymatic steps, has been transferred into yeast cells which is a convenient system to grow in large amounts. With these genetic modifications yeast can use its own metabolites geranyl pyrophosphate and tryptophan to produce the precursors of catharanthine and vindoline. This process required 56 genetic edits, including expression of 34 heterologous genes from plants in yeast cells.

<doc id="20943" wikidata="Q3567687" url="?curid=20943" title="Millennialism">
<text>Millennialism () or chiliasm (from the Greek equivalent) is a belief which is held by some religious denominations. According to this belief, a Messianic Age will be established on Earth prior to the Last Judgment and the future permanent state of &quot;eternity&quot;.

Christianity and Judaism have both produced messianic movements which featured millennialist teachings—such as the notion that an earthly kingdom of God was at hand. These millenarian movements often led to considerable social unrest.

Similarities to millennialism also exist in Zoroastrianism, which identified successive thousand-year periods, each of which will end in a cataclysm of heresy and destruction, until the final destruction of evil and the final destruction of the spirit of evil by a triumphant king of peace at the end of the final millennial age. 

Scholars have also linked various other social and political movements, both religious and secular, to millennialist metaphors.

== Christianity ==
Most Christian millennialist thinking is based upon the Book of Revelation, specifically Revelation 20, which describes the vision of an angel who descends from heaven with a large chain and a key to a bottomless pit, and captures Satan, imprisoning him for a thousand years:
The Book of Revelation then describes a series of judges who are seated on thrones, as well as John&#x27;s vision of the souls of those who were beheaded for their testimony in favor of Jesus and their rejection of the mark of the beast. These souls:

==== Premillennialism ====
During the first centuries after Christ, various forms of chiliasm (millennialism) were to be found in the Church, both East and West. Premillennialism held by the Early Church is called &quot;historic premillennialism&quot;, and it was supported in the early church by Papias, Irenaeus, Justin Martyr, Tertullian, Polycarp, Pseudo-Barnabas, Methodius, Lactantius, Commodianus, Theophilus, Melito, Hippolytus of Rome, Victorinus of Pettau, Nepos, Julius Africanus, Tatian and Montanus. However, the premillennial views of Montanus probably affected the later rejection of premillennialism in the Church, as Montanism was seen as a heresy. 

==== Amillennialism ====
In the 2nd century, the Alogi (those who rejected all of John&#x27;s writings) were amillennial, as was Caius in the first quarter of the 3rd century. With the influence of Platonism, Clement of Alexandria and Origen denied premillennialism. Likewise, Dionysius of Alexandria (died 264) argued that Revelation was not written by John and could not be interpreted literally; he was amillennial.

Justin Martyr (died 165), who had chiliastic tendencies in his theology, mentions differing views in his &quot;Dialogue with Trypho the Jew&quot;, chapter 80:&quot;I and many others are of this opinion [premillennialism], and [believe] that such will take place, as you assuredly are aware; but, on the other hand, I signified to you that many who belong to the pure and pious faith, and are true Christians, think otherwise.&quot;Augustine in his early days affirmed premillennialism, but later changed to amillennialism, causing the view to become popularized together with Pope Gregory the Great.

The &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; notes that the 2nd-century proponents of various Gnostic beliefs (themselves considered heresies) also rejected millenarianism.

=== Reformation and beyond ===
Christian views on the future order of events diversified after the Protestant reformation (). In particular, new emphasis was placed on the passages in the Book of Revelation which seemed to say that as Christ would return to judge the living and the dead, Satan would be locked away for 1000 years, but then released on the world to instigate a final battle against God and his Saints. Previous Catholic and Orthodox theologians had no clear or consensus view on what this actually meant (only the concept of the end of the world coming unexpectedly, &quot;like a thief in the night&quot;, and the concept of &quot;the antichrist&quot; were almost universally held). Millennialist theories try to explain what this &quot;1000 years of Satan bound in chains&quot; would be like.

Various types of millennialism exist with regard to Christian eschatology, especially within Protestantism, such as Premillennialism, Postmillennialism, and Amillennialism. The first two refer to different views of the relationship between the &quot;millennial Kingdom&quot; and Christ&#x27;s second coming.

Premillennialism sees Christ&#x27;s second advent as preceding the millennium, thereby separating the Second Coming from the Final Judgment. In this view, &quot;Christ&#x27;s reign&quot; will be physically on the earth.

Postmillennialism sees Christ&#x27;s second coming as subsequent to the millennium and concurrent with the final judgment. In this view &quot;Christ&#x27;s reign&quot; (during the millennium) will be spiritual in and through the church.

Amillennialism sees the 1000 year kingdom as being metaphorically described in Rev. 20:1–6 in which &quot;Christ&#x27;s reign&quot; is current in and through the church. Thus, while this view does not hold to a future millennial reign, it does hold that the New Heavens and New Earth will appear upon the return of Christ.

===19th and 20th centuries===
====Catholic Church====
The Catholic Church strongly condemns millennialism as the following shows:

====Bible Student movement====
The Bible Student movement is a millennialist movement based on views expressed in &quot;The Divine Plan of the Ages,&quot; in 1886, in Volume One of the &quot;Studies in the Scriptures&quot; series, by Pastor Charles Taze Russell. (This series is still being published, since 1927, by the Dawn Bible Students Association.) Bible Students believe that there will be a universal opportunity for every person, past and present, not previously recipients of a heavenly calling, to gain everlasting life on Earth during the Millennium.

==== Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses ====
Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses believe that Christ will rule from heaven for 1,000 years as king over the earth, assisted by the 144,000 ascended humans. According to them this 1,000 year reign the earth will become a paradise, like the Garden of Eden, and humans will themselves return to the perfection lost by Adam and Eve.

==== The Church of Almighty God ====
Also known as Eastern Lightning, The Church of Almighty God mentions in its teachings the Age of Millennial Kingdom, which will follow the catastrophes prophesied in the Book of Revelation in the Bible.

==== New Apostolic Reformation ====
Counter to much of the Pentecostal movement, which tends towards belief in premillennialism, the rise of the Antichrist, and the decay of the world prior to the Second Coming, the New Apostolic Reformation&#x27;s focus is instead on an &quot;optimistic&quot; eschatology. It holds that most end-time prophecies have long since been fulfilled and that modern-day prophets and apostles have divine authority; the end times will be an era in which obedient Christians, through using spiritual warfare and shaping all aspects of society into aligning with their Christian beliefs (Seven Mountain Mandate), will bring about the Second Coming.

== Judaism ==

Millennialist thinking first emerged in Jewish apocryphal literature of the tumultuous Second Temple period,

Gerschom Scholem profiles medieval and early modern Jewish millennialist teachings in his book &quot;Sabbatai Sevi, the mystical messiah&quot;, which focuses on the 17th-century movement centered on the self-proclaimed messiahship (1648) of Sabbatai Zevi (16261676)

== Islam ==
The Prophet Muhammad has stated that a man from his Household will come and rid the world of all injustice and tyranny. He will be known as the Mahdi.

Muslims also believe that Jesus will come alongside the Mahdi and will fight together with him against oppression and injustice, where the Mahdi will rule for a period of time before the Day of Judgement. The Mahdi is noted in the Sunni books, Sunan Abi Dawud 4285, Sunan Ibn Majah 4083, and Sahih Muslim 2913.

Shia and Sunni Muslims differ on who exactly the Mahdi is. While they both agree that he will come alongside Jesus to save mankind from injustice and oppression; Sunnis believe he is yet to be born, while Shias believe that he is currently alive and in occultation.

== Baha&#x27;i Faith ==

Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh mentioned in the &quot;Kitáb-i-Íqán&quot; that God will renew the &quot;City of God&quot; about every thousand years, and specifically mentioned that a new Manifestation of God would not appear within 1,000 years (1852–2852 CE) of Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh&#x27;s Dispensation, but that the authority of Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh&#x27;s message could last up to 500,000 years.

== Theosophy ==

The Theosophist Alice Bailey taught that &quot;The Christ&quot; or &quot;The World Teacher&quot; would return &quot;sometime after AD 2025&quot;, and that this would be the New Age equivalent of the Christian concept of the Second Coming of Christ. Note that the being she speaks of &quot;The World Teacher&quot; is the same as that spiritual being best known to other Theosophists as &quot;Maitreya&quot;.

== Social movements ==
Millennial social movements, a specific form of millenarianism, have as their basis some concept of a cycle of one-thousand years. Sometimes the two terms are used as synonyms, but purists regard this as not entirely accurate. Millennial social movements need not have a religious foundation, but they must have a vision of an apocalypse that can be utopian or dystopian. Those associated with millennial social movements are &quot;prone to [be violent]&quot;, with certain types of millennialism connected to violence.

In progressive millennialism, the &quot;transformation of the social order is gradual and humans play a role in fostering that transformation&quot;.

Catastrophic millennialism &quot;deems the current social order as irrevocably corrupt, and total destruction of this order is necessary as the precursor to the building of a new, godly order&quot;.

However the link between millennialism and violence may be problematic, as new religious movements may stray from the catastrophic view as time progresses.

=== Nazism ===
The most controversial interpretation of the three-age system and of millennialism in general involves Adolf Hitler&#x27;s &quot;Third Reich&quot; (), which in his vision would last for a thousand years to come () but ultimately lasted for only 12 years (1933–1945).

The German thinker Arthur Moeller van den Bruck coined the phrase &quot;Third Reich&quot; and in 1923 published a book titled &quot;Das Dritte Reich&quot;. Looking back at German history, he distinguished two separate periods, and identified them with the ages of the 12th-century Italian theologian Joachim of Fiore:

* the Holy Roman Empire (beginning with Charlemagne in AD 800): the &quot;First Reich&quot;, &quot;The Age of the Father&quot; and
* the German Empire, under the House of Hohenzollern (1871–1918): the &quot;Second Reich&quot;, &quot;The Age of the Son&quot;.

After the interval of the Weimar Republic (1918 onwards), during which constitutionalism, parliamentarianism and even pacifism dominated, these were then to be followed by:
* the &quot;Third Reich&quot;, &quot;The Age of the Holy Spirit&quot;.

Although van den Bruck was unimpressed by Hitler when he met him in 1922 and did not join the Nazi Party, nevertheless the Nazis adopted the term &quot;Third Reich&quot; to label the totalitarian state they wanted to set up when they gained power, which they succeeded in doing in 1933. Later, however, the Nazi authorities banned the informal use of &quot;Third Reich&quot; throughout the German press in the summer of 1939, instructing it to use more official terms such as &quot;German Reich&quot;, &quot;Greater German Reich&quot;, and &quot;National Socialist Germany&quot; exclusively.

During the early part of the Third Reich many Germans also referred to Hitler as being the &quot;German Messiah&quot;, especially when he conducted the Nuremberg rallies, which came to be held annually (1933–1938) at a date somewhat before the September equinox in Nuremberg.

In a speech held on 27 November 1937, Hitler commented on his plans to have major parts of Berlin torn down and rebuilt:

After Adolf Hitler&#x27;s unsuccessful attempt to implement a thousand-year-reign, the Vatican issued an official statement that millennial claims could not be safely taught and that the related scriptures in Revelation (also called the Apocalypse) should be understood spiritually. Catholic author Bernard LeFrois wrote:

=== Utopianism ===

The early Christian concepts of millennialism had ramifications far beyond strictly religious concerns during the centuries to come, as various theorists blended and enhanced them with ideas of utopia.

In the wake of early millennial thinking, the Three Ages philosophy developed. The Italian monk and theologian Joachim of Fiore (died 1202) saw all of human history as a succession of three ages:
# the Age of the Father (the Old Testament)
# the Age of the Son (the New Testament)
# the Age of the Holy Spirit (the age begun when Christ ascended into heaven, leaving the Paraclete, the third person of the Holy Trinity, to guide the faithful)

It was believed that the Age of the Holy Spirit would begin at , and that from then on all believers would live as monks, mystically transfigured and full of praise for God, for a thousand years until Judgment Day would put an end to the history of our planet.

Joachim of Fiore&#x27;s divisions of historical time also highly influenced the New Age movement, which transformed the Three Ages philosophy into astrological terminology, relating the Northern-hemisphere vernal equinox to different constellations of the zodiac. In this scenario the Age of the Father was recast as the Age of Aries, the Age of the Son became the Age of Pisces, and the Age of the Holy Spirit was called the Aquarian New Age. The current so-called &quot;Age of Aquarius&quot; will supposedly witness the development of a number of great changes for humankind, reflecting the typical features of some manifestations of millennialism.

<text>Might and Magic is a series of role-playing video games in the science fantasy genre developed by New World Computing, which in 1996 became a subsidiary of The 3DO Company. The original &quot;Might and Magic&quot; series ended with the closure of the 3DO Company. The rights to the &quot;Might and Magic&quot; name were purchased for US$1.3 million by Ubisoft, which rebooted the franchise with a new series with no apparent connection to the previous continuity, starting with the games &quot;Heroes of Might and Magic V&quot; and &quot;Dark Messiah of Might and Magic&quot;.

==History==

*&quot;Might and Magic IX: Writ of Fate&quot; (2002; Windows)
*&quot;Might &amp; Magic X: Legacy&quot; (2014; Windows, OS X)

=== Spin-offs ===
There have been several spin-offs from the main series, including the long-running &quot;Heroes of Might and Magic&quot; series, &quot;Crusaders of Might and Magic&quot;, &quot;Warriors of Might and Magic&quot;, &quot;Shifters of Might and Magic&quot;, &quot;Legends of Might and Magic&quot;, &quot;Might and Magic: Heroes Kingdoms&quot;, and the fan-made &quot;Swords of Xeen&quot;.

In August 2003, Ubisoft acquired the rights to the &quot;Might and Magic&quot; franchise for US$1.3 million after 3DO filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Ubisoft has since released multiple new projects using the &quot;Might and Magic&quot; brand, including a fifth installment of the &quot;Heroes&quot; series developed by Nival, an action-style game &quot;Dark Messiah of Might and Magic&quot; developed by Arkane Studios, a puzzle RPG &quot;Might &amp; Magic: Clash of Heroes&quot; developed by &quot;Capybara Games&quot;, and the mobile strategy RPG titled &quot;Might &amp; Magic: Elemental Guardians&quot;.

==Gameplay==
The majority of the gameplay takes place in medieval fantasy settings, while later sections of the games are often based on science fiction tropes, the transition often serving as a plot twist. The player controls a party of player characters, which can consist of members of various character classes. The game world is presented to the player in first person perspective. In the earlier games the interface is very similar to that of &quot;Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot;, but from &quot;Might and Magic VI: The Mandate of Heaven&quot; onward, the interface features a three-dimensional environment. Combat is turn-based, though the later games allowed the player to choose to conduct combat in real time.

The game worlds in all of the Might and Magic games are quite large, and a player can expect each game to provide several dozen hours of gameplay. It is usually quite combat-intensive and often involves large groups of enemy creatures. Monsters and situations encountered throughout the series tend to be well-known fantasy staples such as giant rats, werewolf curses, dragon flights and zombie hordes, rather than original creations. &quot;Isles of Terra&quot; and the &quot;Xeen&quot; games featured a more distinct environment, blending fantasy and science fiction elements in a unique way.

The &quot;Might and Magic&quot; games have some replay value as the player can choose their party composition, develop different skills, choose sides, do quests in a different order, hunt for hidden secrets and easter eggs, and/or change difficulty level.

==Plot==
Although most of the gameplay reflects a distinctly fantasy genre, the overarching plot of the first nine games has a science fiction background. The series is set in a fictional galaxy as part of an alternative universe, where planets are overseen by a powerful race of space travelers known as Ancients who seeded them with humans, elves, dwarves, goblins and others. In each of the games, a party of characters fights monsters and completes quests on one of these planets, until they eventually become involved in the affairs of the Ancients. As such, &quot;Might and Magic&quot; is an example of science fantasy.

The producer of the series was Jon Van Caneghem. Van Caneghem has stated in interview that the &quot;Might and Magic&quot; setting is inspired by his love for both science fiction and fantasy. He cites &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; and the &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;For the World is Hollow and I Have Touched the Sky&quot; as having inspired &quot;Might and Magic&quot; lore.

The first five games in the series concern the renegade android Sheltem created by the Ancients to be the Guardian of the planet Terra, who becomes irrevocably corrupted, developing a penchant for throwing worlds into suns to sabotage the Ancients&#x27; Great Experiment, as his faulty programming views them as a threat to Terra. Sheltem establishes himself on a series of flat worlds known as nacelles (which are carried inside giant spaceships) and Corak, a second Guardian and creation of the Ancients, pursues him across the Void with the assistance of the player characters. Eventually both Corak and Sheltem are destroyed in a climactic battle on the nacelle world of Xeen.

The sixth, seventh and eighth games take place on Enroth, a single planet where a large continent also named Enroth is ruled by the Ironfist dynasty, and chronicle the events and aftermath of an invasion by the Kreegan (colloquially referred to as &quot;devils&quot;), the demon-like archenemies of the Ancients. It is also revealed that the destruction wrought by the Ancients&#x27; wars with the Kreegan is the reason why the worlds of &quot;Might and Magic&quot; exist as medieval fantasy settings despite once being seeded with futuristic technology – the worlds have been &#x27;cut off&#x27; from the Ancients and descended into barbarism. The first through third games in the &quot;Heroes of Might and Magic&quot; series trace the fortunes of the Ironfists in more detail. None of the science fiction elements appear in the &quot;Heroes&quot; series besides the appearance of Kreegan characters in &quot;Heroes of Might and Magic III&quot; and &quot;IV&quot;. &quot;Might and Magic IX&quot; and &quot;Heroes IV&quot; take place on Axeoth, another planet which the survivors of Enroth were brought to through portals after it was destroyed in an event called the Reckoning.

The Ubisoft release &quot;Might &amp; Magic X: Legacy&quot; departs from this continuity and is set in the world of Ashan, a separate setting established by Ubisoft in &quot;Heroes of Might and Magic V&quot; and subsequent &quot;Heroes&quot; games after New World Computing went out of business. Ashan is a high fantasy setting with no science fiction elements in its lore. The original setting remained abandoned until the 2025 game &quot;Heroes of Might and Magic: Olden Era&quot;, a prequel taking place on Enroth&#x27;s continent Jadame, which was first featured in &quot;Might and Magic VIII: Day of the Destroyer&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Might and Magic&quot; is considered one of the defining examples of early role-playing video games, along with &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot;, &quot;Ultima&quot; and &quot;Wizardry&quot; series. By March 1994, combined sales of the &quot;Might and Magic&quot; series totaled 1 million units. The number rose to 2.5 million sales by November 1996. and 4 million by March 1999.

<text>Adobe Flash (formerly Macromedia Flash and FutureSplash) is a discontinued multimedia software platform used for production of animations, rich internet applications, desktop applications, mobile apps, mobile games, and embedded web browser video players.

== About ==
Flash displays text, vector graphics, and raster graphics to provide animations, video games, and applications. It allows streaming of audio and video, and can capture mouse, keyboard, microphone, and camera input.

Artists may produce Flash graphics and animations using Adobe Animate (formerly known as Adobe Flash Professional). Software developers may produce applications and video games using Adobe Flash Builder, FlashDevelop, Flash Catalyst, or any text editor combined with the Apache Flex SDK. End users view Flash content via Flash Player (for web browsers), Adobe AIR (for desktop or mobile apps), or third-party players such as Scaleform (for video games). Adobe Flash Player (which is available on Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux) enables end users to view Flash content using web browsers. Adobe Flash Lite enabled viewing Flash content on older smartphones, but since has been discontinued and superseded by Adobe AIR.

The ActionScript programming language allows the development of interactive animations, video games, web applications, desktop applications, and mobile applications. Programmers can implement Flash software using an IDE such as Adobe Animate, Adobe Flash Builder, Adobe Director, FlashDevelop, and Powerflasher FDT. Adobe AIR enables full-featured desktop and mobile applications to be developed with Flash and published for Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Wii U, and Nintendo Switch.

Flash was initially used to create fully-interactive websites, but this approach was phased out with the introduction of HTML5. Instead, Flash found a niche as the dominant platform for online multimedia content, particularly for browser games. Following an open letter written by Steve Jobs in 2010 stating that he would not approve the use of Flash on Apple&#x27;s iOS devices due to numerous security flaws, use of Flash declined as Adobe transitioned to the Adobe AIR platform. The Flash Player was deprecated in 2017 and officially discontinued at the end of 2020 for all users outside mainland China, as well as non-enterprise users, with many web browsers and operating systems scheduled to remove the Flash Player software around the same time. Adobe continues to develop Adobe Animate, which supports web standards such as HTML5 instead of the Flash format.

==Applications==

===Websites===
In the early 2000s, Flash was widely installed on desktop computers, and was often used to display interactive web pages and online games, and to play video and audio content. In 2005, YouTube was founded by former PayPal employees, and it used Adobe Flash Player as a means to display compressed video content on the web.

Between 2000 and 2010, numerous businesses used Flash-based websites to launch new products, or to create interactive company portals. Notable users include Nike, Hewlett-Packard (more commonly known as HP), Nokia, General Electric, World Wildlife Fund, HBO, Cartoon Network, Disney, and Motorola. After Adobe introduced hardware-accelerated 3D for Flash (Stage3D), Flash websites saw a growth of 3D content for product demonstrations and virtual tours.

In 2007, YouTube offered videos in HTML5 format to support the iPhone and iPad, which did not support Flash Player. After a controversy with Apple, Adobe stopped developing Flash Player for Mobile, focusing its efforts on Adobe AIR applications and HTML5 animation. In 2015, Google introduced Google Swiffy, a tool that converted Flash animation to HTML5, which Google used to automatically convert Flash web ads for mobile devices. In 2016, Google discontinued Swiffy and its support. In 2015, YouTube switched to HTML5 technology on most devices by default; however, YouTube supported the Flash-based video player for older web browsers and devices until 2017.

=== Rich Internet Applications ===

After Flash 5 introduced ActionScript in 2000, developers combined the visual and programming capabilities of Flash to produce interactive experiences and applications for the Web. Such Web-based applications eventually became known as &quot;Rich Internet Applications&quot; and later &quot;Rich Web Applications&quot;.

In 2004, Macromedia Flex was released, and specifically targeted the application development market. Flex introduced new user interface components, advanced data visualization components, data remoting, and a modern IDE (Flash Builder). Flex competed with Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) and Microsoft Silverlight during its tenure. Flex was upgraded to support integration with remote data sources, using AMF, BlazeDS, Adobe LiveCycle, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, and others.

Between 2006 and 2016, the Speedtest.net web service conducted over 9.0 billion speed tests with a utility built with Adobe Flash. In 2016, the service shifted to HTML5 due to the decreasing availability of Adobe Flash Player on PCs.

Developers could create rich internet applications and browser plugin-based applets in ActionScript 3.0 programming language with IDEs, including Adobe Flash Builder, FlashDevelop and Powerflasher FDT. Flex applications were typically built using Flex frameworks such as PureMVC.

===Video games===

Flash video games were popular on the Internet, with portals like Newgrounds, Kongregate, and Armor Games dedicated to hosting Flash-based games. Many Flash games were developed by individuals or groups of friends due to the simplicity of the software. Popular Flash games include &quot;Farmville, Alien Hominid, QWOP&quot;, &quot;Club Penguin&quot;, and &quot;Dofus&quot;.

Adobe introduced various technologies to help build video games, including Adobe AIR (to release games for desktop or mobile platforms), Adobe Scout (to improve performance), CrossBridge (to convert C++-based games to run in Flash), and Stage3D (to support GPU-accelerated video games). 3D frameworks like Away3D and Flare3D simplified creation of 3D content for Flash.

Adobe AIR allows the creation of Flash-based mobile games, which may be published to the Google Play and Apple app stores.

Flash is also used to build interfaces and HUDs for 3D video games using Scaleform GFx, a technology that renders Flash content within non-Flash video games. Scaleform is supported by more than 10 major video game engines including Unreal Engine 3, CryEngine, and PhyreEngine, and has been used to provide 3D interfaces for more than 150 major video game titles since its launch in 2003.

===Film and animation===
Notable users of Flash include DHX Media Vancouver for productions including &quot;Pound Puppies, Littlest Pet Shop and&quot; &quot;My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic&quot;, Fresh TV for Total Drama, Nelvana for &quot;6teen&quot; and &quot;Clone High&quot;, Williams Street for &quot;Metalocalypse&quot; and &quot;Squidbillies&quot;, Nickelodeon Animation Studio for &quot;El Tigre: The Adventures of Manny Rivera&quot;, Starz Media for &quot;Wow! Wow! Wubbzy!&quot;, Ankama Animation for &quot;&quot;, among others.

==History==

===FutureWave===
The precursor to Flash was SmartSketch, a product published by FutureWave Software in 1993. The company was founded by Charlie Jackson, Jonathan Gay, and Michelle Welsh. SmartSketch was a vector drawing application for pen computers running the PenPoint OS. When PenPoint failed in the marketplace, SmartSketch was ported to Microsoft Windows and Mac OS.

As the Internet became more popular, FutureWave realized the potential for a vector-based web animation tool that might challenge Macromedia Shockwave technology. In 1995, FutureWave modified SmartSketch by adding frame-by-frame animation features and released this new product as FutureSplash Animator on Macintosh and PC.

FutureWave approached Adobe Systems with an offer to sell them FutureSplash in 1995, but Adobe turned down the offer at that time. Microsoft wanted to create an &quot;online TV network&quot; (MSN 2.0) and adopted FutureSplash animated content as a central part of it. Disney Online used FutureSplash animations for their subscription-based service Disney&#x27;s Daily Blast. Fox Broadcasting Company launched The Simpsons using FutureSplash.

===Macromedia===
In December 1996, FutureSplash was acquired by Macromedia, and Macromedia re-branded and released &quot;FutureSplash Animator&quot; as &quot;Macromedia Flash 1.0&quot;. Flash was a two-part system, a graphics and animation editor known as Macromedia Flash, and a player known as Macromedia Flash Player.

&quot;FutureSplash Animator&quot; was an animation tool originally developed for pen-based computing devices. Due to the small size of the &quot;FutureSplash Viewer&quot;, it was particularly suited for download on the Web. Macromedia distributed Flash Player as a free browser plugin in order to quickly gain market share. By 2005, more computers worldwide had Flash Player installed than any other Web media format, including Java, QuickTime, RealNetworks, and Windows Media Player.

Macromedia upgraded the Flash system between 1996 and 1999 adding MovieClips, Actions (the precursor to ActionScript), Alpha transparency, and other features. As Flash matured, Macromedia&#x27;s focus shifted from marketing it as a graphics and media tool to promoting it as a Web application platform, adding scripting and data access capabilities to the player while attempting to retain its small footprint.

In 2000, the first major version of ActionScript was developed, and released with &quot;Flash 5&quot;. Actionscript 2.0 was released with &quot;Flash MX 2004&quot; and supported object-oriented programming, improved UI components and other programming features. The last version of Flash released by Macromedia was &quot;Flash 8&quot;, which focused on graphical upgrades such as filters (blur, drop shadow, etc.), blend modes (similar to Adobe Photoshop), and advanced features for FLV video.

===Adobe===
On December 3, 2005, Adobe Systems acquired Macromedia alongside its product line which included Flash, Dreamweaver, Director/Shockwave, Fireworks, and Authorware.

In 2007, Adobe&#x27;s first version release was &quot;Adobe Flash CS3 Professional&quot;, the ninth major version of Flash. It introduced the ActionScript 3.0 programming language, which supported modern programming practices and enabled business applications to be developed with Flash. Adobe Flex Builder (built on Eclipse) targeted the enterprise application development market, and was also released the same year. Flex Builder included the Flex SDK, a set of components that included charting, advanced UI, and data services (&quot;Flex Data Services&quot;).

In 2008, Adobe released the tenth version of Flash, &quot;Adobe Flash CS4&quot;. Flash 10 improved animation capabilities within the Flash editor, adding a motion editor panel (similar to Adobe After Effects), inverse kinematics (bones), basic 3D object animation, object-based animation, and other text and graphics features. &quot;Flash Player 10&quot; included an in-built 3D engine (without GPU acceleration) that allowed basic object transformations in 3D space (position, rotation, scaling).

Also in 2008, Adobe released the first version of Adobe Integrated Runtime (later re-branded as &quot;Adobe AIR&quot;), a runtime engine that replaced Flash Player, and provided additional capabilities to the ActionScript 3.0 language to build desktop and mobile applications. With AIR, developers could access the file system (the user&#x27;s files and folders), and connected devices such as a joystick, gamepad, and sensors for the first time.

In 2011, &quot;Adobe Flash Player 11&quot; was released, and with it the first version of Stage3D, allowing GPU-accelerated 3D rendering for Flash applications and games on desktop platforms such as Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X. Adobe further improved 3D capabilities from 2011 to 2013, adding support for 3D rendering on Android and iOS platforms, alpha-channels, compressed textures, texture atlases, and other features. Adobe AIR was upgraded to support 64-bit computers, and to allow developers to add additional functionality to the AIR runtime using &quot;AIR Native Extensions&quot; (ANE).

In May 2014, Adobe announced that Adobe AIR was used in over 100,000 unique applications and had over 1 billion installations logged worldwide. Adobe AIR was voted the &quot;Best Mobile Application Development&quot; product at the Consumer Electronics Show on two consecutive years (CES 2014 and CES 2015).

In 2016, Adobe renamed Flash Professional, the primary authoring software for Flash content, to Adobe Animate to reflect its growing use for authoring HTML5 content in favor of Flash content.

=== Open Source ===
Adobe has taken steps to reduce or eliminate Flash licensing costs. For instance, the SWF file format documentation is provided free of charge after they relaxed the requirement of accepting a non-disclosure agreement to view it in 2008. Adobe also created the Open Screen Project which removes licensing fees and opens data protocols for Flash.

Adobe has also open-sourced many components relating to Flash.

* In 2006, the ActionScript Virtual Machine 2 (AVM2) which implements ActionScript 3 was donated as open-source to Mozilla Foundation, to begin work on the Tamarin virtual machine that would implement the ECMAScript 4 language standard with the help of the Mozilla community. It was released under the terms of a MPL/GPL/LGPL tri-license and includes the specification for the ActionScript bytecode format; Tamarin Project jointly managed by Mozilla and Adobe Systems It is now considered obsolete by Mozilla.
* In 2011, the Adobe Flex Framework was donated as open-source to the Apache Software Foundation and rebranded as Apache Flex. Some saw this move as Adobe abandoning Flex, and stepping away from the Flash Platform as a whole. Sources from Apache say that &quot;Enterprise application development is no longer a focus at Adobe. At least as Flash is concerned, Adobe is concentrating on games and video.&quot;, and they conclude that &quot;Flex Innovation is Exploding!&quot;. The donated source code included a partly developed AS3 compiler (dubbed &quot;Falcon&quot;) and the BlazeDS set of technologies.
* In 2013, the CrossBridge C++ cross-compilation toolset was open sourced by Adobe and released on GitHub. The project was formerly termed &quot;Alchemy&quot; and &quot;Flash Runtime C++ Compiler&quot;, and targeted the game development market to enable C++ video games to run in Adobe Flash Player.

Adobe has not been willing to make complete source code of the Flash Player available for free software development and even though free and open source alternatives such as Shumway and Gnash have been built, they are no longer under active development.

====Open Screen Project====
On May 1, 2008, Adobe announced the &quot;Open Screen Project&quot;, with the intent of providing a consistent application interface across devices such as personal computers, mobile devices, and consumer electronics. When the project was announced, seven goals were outlined: the abolition of licensing fees for Adobe Flash Player and Adobe AIR, the removal of restrictions on the use of the Shockwave Flash (SWF) and Flash Video (FLV) file formats, the publishing of application programming interfaces for porting Flash to new devices, and the publishing of The Flash Cast protocol and Action Message Format (AMF), which let Flash applications receive information from remote databases.

, the specifications removing the restrictions on the use of SWF and FLV/F4V specs have been published. The Flash Cast protocol—now known as the Mobile Content Delivery Protocol—and AMF protocols have also been made available, with AMF available as an open source implementation, BlazeDS.

The list of mobile device providers who have joined the project includes Palm, Motorola, and Nokia, who, together with Adobe, have announced a $10 million Open Screen Project fund.

===End of life===

One of Flash&#x27;s primary uses on the Internet when it was first released was for building fully immersive, interactive websites. These were typically highly creative site designs that provided more flexibility over what the current HTML standards could provide as well as operate over dial-up connections. However, these sites limited accessibility by &quot;breaking the Back Button&quot;, dumping visitors out of the Flash experience entirely by returning them to whatever page they had been on prior to first arriving at the site. Fully Flash-run sites fell out of favor for more strategic use of Flash plugins for video and other interactive features among standard HTML conventions, corresponding with the availability of HTML features like cascading style-sheets in the mid-00&#x27;s. At the same time, this also led to Flash being used for new apps, including video games and animations. Precursors to YouTube featuring user-generated Flash animations and games such as Newgrounds became popular destinations, further helping to spread the use of Flash.

Toward the end of the millennium, the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) was released, corresponding with development of Dynamic HTML. Fifteen years later, WAP had largely been replaced by full-capability implementations and the HTML5 standard included more support for interactive and video elements. Support for Flash in these mobile browsers was not included. In 2010, Apple&#x27;s Steve Jobs famously wrote &quot;Thoughts on Flash&quot;, an open letter to Adobe criticizing the closed nature of the Flash platform and the inherent security problems with the application to explain why Flash was not supported on iOS. Adobe created the Adobe AIR environment as a means to appease Apple&#x27;s concerns, and spent time legally fighting Apple over terms of its App Store to allow AIR to be used on the iOS. While Adobe eventually won, allowing for other third-party development environments to get access to the iOS, Apple&#x27;s decision to block Flash itself was considered the &quot;death blow&quot; to the Flash application. In November 2011, about a year after Jobs&#x27; open letter, Adobe announced it would no longer be developing Flash and advised developers to switch to HTML5.

In 2011, Adobe ended support for Flash on Android. Adobe stated that Flash platform was transitioning to Adobe AIR and OpenFL, a multi-target open-source implementation of the Flash API. In 2015, Adobe rebranded Flash Professional, the main Flash authoring environment, as Adobe Animate to emphasize its expanded support for HTML5 authoring, and stated that it would &quot;encourage content creators to build with new web standards&quot; rather than use Flash.

In July 2017, Adobe deprecated Flash, and announced its End-Of-Life (EOL) at the end of 2020, and will cease support, distribution, and security updates for Flash Player.

With Flash&#x27;s EOL announced, many browsers took steps to gradually restrict Flash content (caution users before launching it, eventually blocking all content without an option to play it). By January 2021, all major browsers were blocking all Flash content unconditionally. Only IE11, niche browser forks, and some browsers built for China plan to continue support. Furthermore, excluding the China variant of Flash, Flash execution software has a built-in kill switch which prevents it from playing Flash after January 12, 2021. In January 2021, Microsoft released an optional update KB4577586 which removes Flash Player from Windows; in July 2021 this update was pushed out as a security update and applied automatically to all remaining systems.

====Post EOL support====

Adobe Flash will still be supported in China and worldwide on some specialized enterprise platforms beyond 2020.

=== Content preservation projects ===
As early as 2014, around the same time that Adobe began encouraging Flash developers to transition their works to HTML5 standards, others began efforts to preserve existing Flash content through emulation of Flash in open standards. While some Flash applications were utilitarian, several applications had been shown to be experimental art, while others had laid the foundation of independent video game development. An early project was Mozilla&#x27;s Shumway, an open source project that attempted to emulate the Flash standard in HTML5, but the project was shuttered as the team found that more developers were switching to HTML5 than seeking to keep their content in Flash, coupled with the difficulties in assuring full compatibility. Google had developed the Swiffy application, released in 2014, to convert Flash applications to HTML5-compatible scripts for viewing on mobile devices, but it was shut down in 2016.

Closer to Flash&#x27;s EOL date in 2020, there were more concentrated efforts simply to preserve existing Flash applications, including websites, video games, and animations beyond Flash&#x27;s EOL. In November 2020, the Internet Archive integrated Ruffle within its Emularity system to emulate Flash games and animations without the security holes, opening a new collection for creators and users to save and preserve Flash content. By October 2023, the Flashpoint Archive has collected more than 160,000 Flash applications, excluding those that were commercial products, and offered as a freely available archive for users to download. Kongregate, one of the larger sites that offered Flash games, has been working with the Strong Museum of Play to preserve its games.

==Format==

===FLA===
Flash source files are in the FLA format and contain graphics and animation, as well as embedded assets such as bitmap images, audio files, and FLV video files. The Flash source file format was a proprietary format and Adobe Animate and Adobe Flash Pro were the only available authoring tools capable of editing such files. Flash source files (.fla) may be compiled into Flash movie files (.swf) using Adobe Animate. Note that FLA files can be edited, but output (.swf) files cannot.

===SWF===

Flash movie files were in the &quot;SWF&quot; format, traditionally called &quot;ShockWave Flash&quot; movies, &quot;Flash movies&quot;, or &quot;Flash applications&quot;, usually have a .swf file extension, and may be used in the form of a web page plug-in, strictly &quot;played&quot; in a standalone Flash Player, or incorporated into a self-executing Projector movie (with the .exe extension in Microsoft Windows). Flash Video files have a .flv file extension and are either used from within .swf files or played through a flv-aware player, such as VLC, or QuickTime and Windows Media Player with external codecs added.

The use of vector graphics combined with program code allows Flash files to be smaller—and thus allows streams to use less bandwidth—than the corresponding bitmaps or video clips. For content in a single format (such as just text, video, or audio), other alternatives may provide better performance and consume less CPU power than the corresponding Flash movie, for example, when using transparency or making large screen updates such as photographic or text fades.

In addition to a vector-rendering engine, the Flash Player includes a virtual machine called the ActionScript Virtual Machine (AVM) for scripting interactivity at run-time, with video, MP3-based audio, and bitmap graphics. As of Flash Player 8, it offered two video codecs: On2 Technologies VP6 and Sorenson Spark, and run-time JPEG, Progressive JPEG, PNG, GIF and (DWG) AutoCAD Drawing file (WMV) Windows Metafile capability.

===3D===

Flash Player 11 introduced a full 3D shader API, called Stage3D, which is fairly similar to WebGL. Stage3D enables GPU-accelerated rendering of 3D graphics within Flash games and applications, and has been used to build &quot;Angry Birds&quot;, and a couple of other notable games.

Various 3D frameworks have been built for Flash using Stage3D, such as Away3D 4, CopperCube, Flare3D, and Starling. Professional game engines like Unreal Engine and Unity also export Flash versions which use Stage3D to render 3D graphics.

===Flash Video===

Virtually all browser plugins for video are free of charge and cross-platform, including Adobe&#x27;s offering of Flash Video, which was introduced with Flash version 6. Flash Video had been a popular choice for websites due to the large installed user base and programmability of Flash. In 2010, Apple publicly criticized Adobe Flash, including its implementation of video playback for not taking advantage of hardware acceleration, one reason Flash was not to be found on Apple&#x27;s mobile devices. Soon after Apple&#x27;s criticism, Adobe demoed and released a beta version of Flash 10.1, which used available GPU hardware acceleration even on a Mac. Flash 10.2 beta, released December 2010, added hardware acceleration for the whole video rendering pipeline.

Flash Player supports two distinct modes of video playback, and hardware accelerated video decoding may not be used for older video content. Such content causes excessive CPU usage compared to comparable content played with other players.
; Software Rendered Video: Flash Player supports software rendered video since version 6. Such video supports vector animations displayed above the video content. This obligation may, depending on graphic APIs exposed by the operating system, prohibit using a video overlay, like a traditional multimedia player would use, with the consequence that color space conversion and scaling must happen in software.
; Hardware Accelerated Video: Flash Player supports hardware accelerated video playback since version 10.2, for H.264, F4V, and FLV video formats. Such video is displayed above all Flash content and takes advantage of video codec chipsets installed on the user&#x27;s device. Developers must specifically use the &quot;StageVideo&quot; technology within Flash Player in order for hardware decoding to be enabled. Flash Player internally uses technologies such as DirectX Video Acceleration and OpenGL to do so.

In tests done by Ars Technica in 2008 and 2009, Adobe Flash Player performed better on Windows than Mac OS X and Linux with the same hardware.
Performance has later improved for the latter two, on Mac OS X with Flash Player 10.1, and on Linux with Flash Player 11.

===Flash Audio===
Flash Audio is most commonly encoded in MP3; however, it can also use ADPCM (an IMA ADPCM variation that can use 2, 3, 4, or 5 bits per sample), Nellymoser (Nellymoser Asao Codec) and Speex audio codecs. Flash allows sample rates of 5512, 11025, 22050 and 44100 Hz (but Speex uses 16 kHz and Nellymoser Asao can also use 8 kHz and 16 kHz). It cannot have a 48 kHz audio sample rate, which is the standard TV and DVD sample rate.

On August 20, 2007, Adobe announced on its blog that with Update 3 of Flash Player 9, Flash Video will also implement some parts of the MPEG-4 international standards. Specifically, Flash Player will work with video compressed in H.264 (MPEG-4 Part 10), audio compressed using AAC (MPEG-4 Part 3), the F4V, MP4 (MPEG-4 Part 14), M4V, M4A, 3GP, and MOV multimedia container formats, 3GPP Timed Text specification (MPEG-4 Part 17), which is a standardized subtitle format and partial parsing capability for the &quot;ilst&quot; atom, which is the ID3 equivalent iTunes uses to store metadata. MPEG-4 Part 2 and H.263 will not work in F4V file format. Adobe also announced that it will be gradually moving away from the FLV format to the standard ISO base media file format (MPEG-4 Part 12) owing to functional limits with the FLV structure when streaming H.264. The final release of the Flash Player implementing some parts of MPEG-4 standards had become available in Fall 2007.

Adobe Flash Player 10.1 does not have acoustic echo cancellation, unlike the VoIP offerings of Skype and Google Voice, making this and earlier versions of Flash less suitable for group calling or meetings. Flash Player 10.3 Beta incorporates acoustic echo cancellation.

===ActionScript===

Flash programs use &quot;ActionScript&quot; programming language. It is an enhanced superset of the ECMAScript programming language, with a classical Java-style class model, rather than JavaScript&#x27;s prototype model.

===Specifications===
In October 1998, Macromedia disclosed the Flash Version 3 Specification on its website. It did this in response to many new and often semi-open formats competing with SWF, such as Xara&#x27;s Flare and Sharp&#x27;s Extended Vector Animation formats. Several developers quickly created a C library for producing SWF. In February 1999, MorphInk 99 was introduced, the first third-party program to create SWF files. Macromedia also hired Middlesoft to create a freely available developers&#x27; kit for the SWF file format versions 3 to 5.

Macromedia made the Flash Files specifications for versions 6 and later available only under a non-disclosure agreement, but they are widely available from various sites.

In April 2006, the Flash SWF file format specification was released with details on the then newest version format (Flash 8). Although still lacking specific information on the incorporated video compression formats (On2, Sorenson Spark, etc.), this new documentation covered all the new features offered in Flash v8 including new ActionScript commands, expressive filter controls, and so on. The file format specification document is offered only to developers who agree to a license agreement that permits them to use the specifications only to develop programs that can export to the Flash file format. The license does not allow the use of the specifications to create programs that can be used for playback of Flash files. The Flash 9 specification was made available under similar restrictions.

In June 2009, Adobe launched the Open Screen Project (Adobe link), which made the SWF specification available without restrictions. Previously, developers could not use the specification for making SWF-compatible players, but only for making SWF-exporting authoring software. The specification still omits information on codecs such as Sorenson Spark, however.

==Animation tools==

===Official tools===

The Adobe Animate authoring program is primarily used to design graphics and animation and publish the same for websites, web applications, and video games. The program also offers limited support for audio and video embedding and ActionScript scripting.

Adobe released Adobe LiveMotion, designed to create interactive animation content and export it to a variety of formats, including SWF. LiveMotion failed to gain any notable user base.

In February 2003, Macromedia purchased Presedia, which had developed a Flash authoring tool that automatically converted PowerPoint files into Flash. Macromedia subsequently released the new product as Breeze, which included many new enhancements.

===Third-party tools===

Various free and commercial software packages can output animations into the Flash SWF format including:
* Ajax Animator aims to create a Flash development environment
* Apple Keynote allows users to export presentations to Flash SWF animations
* KToon can edit vectors and generate SWF, but its interface is very different from Macromedia&#x27;s
* Moho is a 2D animation software package specialized for character animation, that creates Flash animations
* OpenOffice Impress
* Screencast and Screencam, produces demos or tutorials by capturing the screen and generating a Flash animation of the same
* SWiSH Max is an animation editor with preset animation, developed by an ex-employee of Macromedia, that can output Flash animations
* Synfig
* Toon Boom is a traditional animation tool that can output Flash animations
* Swift 3d for vector 3D rendering &amp; animation 
* Xara Photo &amp; Graphic Designer can output Flash animations

The Flash 4 Linux project was an initiative to develop an open source Linux application as an alternative to Adobe Animate. Development plans included authoring capacity for 2D animation, and tweening, as well as outputting SWF file formats. F4L evolved into an editor that was capable of authoring 2D animation and publishing of SWF files. Flash 4 Linux was renamed UIRA. UIRA intended to combine the resources and knowledge of the F4L project and the Qflash project, both of which were Open Source applications that aimed to provide an alternative to the proprietary Adobe Flash.

==Programming tools==

===Official tools===
Adobe provides a series of tools to develop software applications and video games for Flash:
* Apache Flex SDK – a free, open source SDK to compile Flash-based rich internet applications from source code. The Apache Flex ActionScript 3.0 compiler generates SWF files from ActionScript 3 files. Flex was the primary ActionScript 3 compiler and was actively developed by Adobe before it was donated to Apache Software Foundation in 2011.
* Adobe Animate – primarily used to design graphics and animation, but supports ActionScript scripting and debugging.
* Adobe Flash Builder – enterprise application development &amp; debugging, contains the Flex SDK with UI and charting components.
* Adobe Scout – a visual profiler to optimize the performance of Flash content.
* CrossBridge – a free SDK to cross-compile C++ code to run in Flash Player.

===Third-party tools===
Third-party development tools have been created to assist developers in creating software applications and video games with Flash.
* FlashDevelop is a free and open source Flash ActionScript IDE, which includes a project manager and debugger for building applications on Flash Player and Adobe AIR.
* Powerflasher FDT is a commercial ActionScript IDE similar to FlashDevelop.
* Haxe is an open source, high-level object-oriented programming language geared towards web-content creation that can compile SWF files from Haxe programs. As of 2012, Haxe can build programs for Flash Player that perform faster than the same application built with the Adobe Flex SDK compiler, due to additional compiler optimizations supported in Haxe.
* SWFTools (specifically, swfc) is an open-source ActionScript 3.0 compiler which generates SWF files from script files, which includes SVG tags.
* swfmill and MTASC also provide tools to create SWF files by compiling text, ActionScript or XML files into Flash animations
* Ming library, to create SWF files programmatically, has interfaces for C, PHP, C++, Perl, Python, and Ruby. It is able to import and export graphics from XML into SWF.

===Proprietary===

Adobe Flash Player is the multimedia and application player originally developed by Macromedia and acquired by Adobe Systems. It plays SWF files, which can be created by Adobe Animate, Apache Flex, or a number of other Adobe Systems and 3rd party tools. It has support for a scripting language called ActionScript, which can be used to display Flash Video from an SWF file.

Scaleform GFx is a commercial alternative Flash player that features fully hardware-accelerated 2D graphics rendering using the GPU. Scaleform has high conformance with both Flash 10 ActionScript 3 and Flash 8 ActionScript 2. Scaleform GFx is a game development middleware solution that helps create graphical user interfaces or HUDs within 3D video games. It does not work with web browsers.

IrfanView, an image viewer, uses Flash Player to display SWF files.

===Open source===
OpenFL, a cross-platform open-source implementation of the Adobe Flash API, supports importing SWF assets.

Lightspark is a free and open-source SWF player that supports most of ActionScript 3.0 and has a Mozilla-compatible plug-in. It will fall back on Gnash, a free SWF player supporting ActionScript 1.0 and 2.0 (AVM1) code. Lightspark supports OpenGL-based rendering for 3D content. The player is also compatible with H.264 Flash videos on YouTube.

Gnash aimed to create a software player and browser plugin replacement for the Adobe Flash Player. Gnash can play SWF files up to version 7, and 80% of ActionScript 2.0. Gnash runs on Windows, Linux and other platforms for the 32-bit, 64-bit, and other operating systems, but development has slowed significantly in recent years.

Shumway was an open source Flash Player released by Mozilla in November 2012. It was built in JavaScript and is thus compatible with modern web browsers. In early October 2013, Shumway was included by default in the Firefox nightly branch. Shumway rendered Flash contents by translating contents inside Flash files to HTML5 elements, and running an ActionScript interpreter in JavaScript. It supported both AVM1 and AVM2, and ActionScript versions 1, 2, and 3. Development of Shumway ceased in early 2016.

In the same year that Shumway was abandoned, work began on Ruffle, a flash emulator written in Rust. It also runs in web browsers, by compiling down to WebAssembly and using HTML5 Canvas. In 2020, the Internet Archive added support for emulating SWF by adding Ruffle to its emulation scheme. As of March 2023, Ruffle states that it supports 95% of the AS1/2 language and 73% of the AS1/2 APIs, but does not correctly run most AS3 (AVM2) applications.

==Availability==

===Desktop computers===

====Adobe Flash Player====

Adobe Flash Player is currently only supported with the enterprise and China variants, it has been deprecated everywhere else.

Adobe Flash Player is available in four flavors:
* ActiveX-based Plug-in
* NPAPI-based Plug-in
* PPAPI-based Plug-in
* Projector

The &quot;ActiveX&quot; version is an ActiveX control for use in Internet Explorer and any other Windows applications that support ActiveX technology. The &quot;Plug-in&quot; versions are available for browsers supporting either NPAPI or PPAPI plug-ins on Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux. The &quot;projector&quot; version is a standalone player that can open SWF files directly.

====Adobe AIR====

Adobe AIR shares some code with Adobe Flash Player and essentially embeds it.

===Mobile devices===

====Adobe Flash Player====
Adobe Flash Player was previously available for a variety of mobile operating systems, including Android (between versions 2.2 and 4.0.4)., Pocket PC/Windows CE, QNX (e.g., on BlackBerry PlayBook), Symbian, Palm OS, and webOS (since version 2.0). Flash Player for smartphones was originally made available to handset manufacturers at the end of 2009. In November 2011, Adobe announced the withdrawal of support for Flash Player on mobile devices.

In 2011 Adobe reaffirmed its commitment to &quot;aggressively contribute&quot; to HTML5. Adobe announced the end of Flash for mobile platforms or TV, instead focusing on HTML5 for browser content and Adobe AIR for the various mobile application stores and described it as &quot;the beginning of the end&quot;. BlackBerry LTD (formerly known as RIM) announced that it would continue to develop Flash Player for the PlayBook.

There is no Adobe Flash Player for iOS devices (iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch). However, Flash content can be made to run on iOS devices in a variety of ways:
* Flash content can be bundled inside an Adobe AIR app, which will then run on iOS devices. (Apple did not allow this for a while, but they relaxed those restrictions in September 2010.)
* If the content is Flash video being served by Adobe Flash Media Server 4.5, the server will translate and send the video as HTTP Dynamic Streaming or HTTP Live Streaming, both of which can be played by iOS devices.
* Some specialized mobile browsers manage to accommodate Flash via streaming content from the cloud directly to a user&#x27;s device. Some examples are Photon Browser and Puffin Web Browser.

The mobile version of Internet Explorer for Windows Phone cannot play Flash content; however, Flash support is still present on the tablet version of Windows.

====Adobe AIR====
AIR is a cross-platform runtime system for developing applications for mobile devices running Android (ARM Cortex-A8 and above) and Apple iOS.

===Adobe Flash Lite===

Adobe Flash Lite is a lightweight version of Adobe Flash Player intended for mobile phones and other portable electronic devices like Chumby and iRiver.

===OpenFL===

OpenFL is an open-source software framework that mirrors the Adobe Flash API. It allows developers to build a single application against the OpenFL APIs, and simultaneously target multiple platforms including iOS, Android, HTML5 (choice of Canvas, WebGL, SVG or DOM), Windows, macOS, Linux, WebAssembly, Flash, AIR, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, Xbox One, Wii U, TiVo, Raspberry Pi, and Node.js. OpenFL mirrors the Flash API for graphical operations. OpenFL applications can be written in Haxe, JavaScript (EcmaScript 5 or 6+), or TypeScript.

More than 500 video games have been developed with OpenFL, including the BAFTA-award-winning game &quot;Papers, Please&quot;, Rymdkapsel, Lightbot, and Madden NFL Mobile.

===HTML5===

HTML5 is often cited as an alternative to Adobe Flash technology usage on web pages. Adobe released a tool that converts Flash to HTML5, and in June 2011, Google released an experimental tool that does the same. In January 2015, YouTube defaulted to HTML5 players to better support more devices.

===Flash to HTML5===
The following tools allow converting Flash content to HTML5:
* Adobe Edge Animate was designed to produce HTML5 animations directly.
* Adobe Animate now allows Flash animations to be published into HTML5 content directly.
* Google Swiffy was a web-based tool developed by Google that converts SWF files into HTML5, using SVG for graphics and JavaScript for animation.
*Adobe Wallaby was a converter developed by Adobe.
* CreateJS is a library that while available separately was also adopted by Adobe as a replacement for Wallaby in CS6. Unlike Wallaby, which was a standalone program, the &quot;Toolkit for CreateJS&quot; only works as a plug-in inside Flash Professional; it generates output for the HTML5 canvas, animated with JavaScript. Around December 2013, the toolkit was integrated directly into Flash Professional CC.

The following tools run Flash content in an HTML5-enabled browser, but do not convert to a HTML5 webpage:
* Shumway, developed by Mozilla, was an open source Flash virtual machine written in JavaScript.
* Web Flash Player, developed by GraphOGL Risorse, is a free and on-line Flash Player (Flash virtual machine) written in JavaScript.

==Criticisms==

===Mobile support===
Websites built with Adobe Flash will not function on most modern mobile devices running Google Android or iOS (iPhone, iPad). The only alternative is using HTML5 and responsive web design to build websites that support both desktop and mobile devices.

However, Flash is still used to build mobile games using Adobe AIR. Such games will not work in mobile web browsers but must be installed via the appropriate app store.

===Vendor lock-in===

The reliance on Adobe for decoding Flash made its use on the World Wide Web a concern—the completeness of its public specifications are debated, and no complete implementation of Flash is publicly available in source code form with a license that permits reuse. Generally, public specifications are what makes a format re-implementable (see future proofing data storage), and reusable codebases can be ported to new platforms without the endorsement of the format creator.

Adobe&#x27;s restrictions on the use of the SWF/FLV specifications were lifted in February 2009 (see Adobe&#x27;s Open Screen Project). However, despite efforts of projects like Gnash, Swfdec, and Lightspark, a complete free Flash player is yet to be seen, as of September 2011. For example, Gnash cannot use SWF v10 yet. Notably, Gnash was listed on the Free Software Foundation&#x27;s high priority list, from at least 2007, to its removal in January 2017.

Notable advocates of free software, open standards, and the World Wide Web have warned against the use of Flash:

The founder of Mozilla Europe, Tristan Nitot, stated in 2008:
Companies building websites should beware of proprietary rich-media technologies like Adobe&#x27;s Flash and Microsoft&#x27;s Silverlight. (...) You&#x27;re producing content for your users and there&#x27;s someone in the middle deciding whether users should see your content.

Representing open standards, inventor of CSS and co-author of HTML5, Håkon Wium Lie explained in a Google tech talk of 2007, entitled &quot;the &lt;video&gt; element&quot;, the proposal of Theora as the format for HTML video:
I believe very strongly, that we need to agree on some kind of baseline video format if [the video element] is going to succeed. Flash is today the baseline format on the web. The problem with Flash is that it&#x27;s not an open standard.

Representing the free software movement, Richard Stallman stated in a speech in 2004 that: &quot;The use of Flash in websites is a major problem for our community.&quot;

===Accessibility and usability===
Usability consultant Jakob Nielsen published an Alertbox in 2000 entitled, &quot;Flash: 99% Bad&quot;, stating that &quot;Flash tends to degrade websites for three reasons: it encourages design abuse, it breaks with the Web&#x27;s fundamental interaction principles, and it distracts attention from the site&#x27;s core value.&quot; Some problems have been at least partially fixed since Nielsen&#x27;s complaints: text size can be controlled using full page zoom and it has been possible for authors to include alternative text in Flash since Flash Player 6.

===Flash blocking in web browsers===
Flash content is usually embedded using the codice_1 or codice_2 HTML element. A web browser that does not fully implement one of these elements displays the replacement text, if supplied by the web page. Often, a plugin is required for the browser to fully implement these elements, though some users cannot or will not install it.

Since Flash can be used to produce content (such as advertisements) that some users find obnoxious or take a large amount of bandwidth to download, some web browsers, by default, do not play Flash content until the user clicks on it, e.g. Konqueror, K-Meleon.

Most current browsers have a feature to block plugins, playing one only when the user clicks it. Opera versions since 10.5 feature native Flash blocking. Opera Turbo requires the user to click to play Flash content, and the browser also allows the user to enable this option permanently. Both Chrome and Firefox have an option to enable &quot;click to play plugins&quot;. Equivalent &quot;Flash blocker&quot; extensions are also available for many popular browsers: Firefox has Flashblock and NoScript, Internet Explorer has Foxie, which contains a number of features, one of them named Flashblock. WebKit-based browsers under macOS, such as Apple&#x27;s Safari, have ClickToFlash. In June 2015, Google announced that Chrome will &quot;pause&quot; advertisements and &quot;non-central&quot; Flash content by default.

Firefox (from version 46) rewrites old Flash-only YouTube embed code into YouTube&#x27;s modern embedded player that is capable of using either HTML video or Flash. Such embed code is used by non-YouTube sites to embed YouTube&#x27;s videos, and can still be encountered, for example, on old blogs and forums.

However, there are ways to pass this error in absence of flash player by deleting the validation code in HTML. This also depends on browser vision.

===Security===
For many years Adobe Flash Player&#x27;s security record has led many security experts to recommend against installing the player, or to block Flash content. The US-CERT has recommended blocking Flash, and security researcher Charlie Miller recommended &quot;not to install Flash&quot;; however, for people still using Flash, Intego recommended that users get trusted updates &quot;only directly from the vendor that publishes them.&quot; Adobe Flash Player has over 1078 CVE entries, of which over 842 lead to arbitrary code execution, and past vulnerabilities have enabled spying via web cameras. Security experts have long predicted the demise of Flash, saying that with the rise of HTML5 &quot;...the need for browser plugins such as Flash is diminishing&quot;.

Active moves by third parties to limit the risk began with Steve Jobs in 2010 saying that Apple would not allow Flash on the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad – citing abysmal security as one reason. Flash often used the ability to dynamically change parts of the runtime on languages on OSX to improve their own performance, but caused general instability. In July 2015, a series of newly discovered vulnerabilities resulted in Facebook&#x27;s chief security officer, Alex Stamos, issuing a call to Adobe to discontinue the software entirely and the Mozilla Firefox web browser, Google Chrome, and Apple Safari to blacklist all earlier versions of Flash Player.

===Flash cookies===

Like the HTTP cookie, a flash cookie (also known as a &quot;Local Shared Object&quot;) can be used to save application data. Flash cookies are not shared across domains. An August 2009 study by the Ashkan Soltani and a team of researchers at UC Berkeley found that 50% of websites using Flash were also employing flash cookies, yet privacy policies rarely disclosed them, and user controls for privacy preferences were lacking. Most browsers&#x27; cache and history suppress or delete functions did not affect Flash Player&#x27;s writing Local Shared Objects to its own cache in version 10.2 and earlier, at which point the user community was much less aware of the existence and function of Flash cookies than HTTP cookies. Thus, users with those versions, having deleted HTTP cookies and purged browser history files and caches, may believe that they have purged all tracking data from their computers when in fact Flash browsing history remains. Adobe&#x27;s own Flash Website Storage Settings panel, a submenu of the Settings Manager web application, and other editors and toolkits can manage settings for and delete Flash Local Shared Objects.

<doc id="20948" wikidata="Q743263" url="?curid=20948" title="Brainwashing">
<text>Brainwashing is the controversial idea that the human mind can be altered or controlled against a person&#x27;s will by manipulative psychological techniques. Brainwashing is said to reduce its subject&#x27;s ability to think critically or independently, to allow the introduction of new, unwanted thoughts and ideas into their minds, as well as to change their attitudes, values, and beliefs.

The term &quot;brainwashing&quot; was first used in English by Edward Hunter in 1950 to describe how the Chinese government appeared to make people cooperate with them during the Korean War. Research into the concept also looked at Nazi Germany and present-day North Korea, at some criminal cases in the United States, and at the actions of human traffickers. Scientific and legal debate followed, as well as media attention, about the possibility of brainwashing being a factor when lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) was used, or in the induction of people into groups which are considered to be cults.

Brainwashing has become a common theme in popular culture especially in war stories, thrillers, and science fiction stories. In casual speech, &quot;brainwashing&quot; and its verb form, &quot;brainwash&quot;, are used figuratively to describe the use of propaganda to sway public opinion.

==China and the Korean War==

The Chinese term ( ) was originally used by early 20th century Chinese intellectuals to refer to modernizing one&#x27;s way of thinking. The term was later used to describe the coercive persuasion used under the Maoist government in China, which aimed to transform &quot;reactionary&quot; people into &quot;right-thinking&quot; members of the new Chinese social system. The term punned on the Taoist custom of &quot;cleansing/washing the heart/mind&quot; () before conducting ceremonies or entering holy places.

The earliest known English-language usage of the word &quot;brainwashing&quot; in an article by a journalist Edward Hunter, in &quot;Miami News&quot;, published in 1950. Hunter was an anticommunist and worked for the CIA. Hunter and others used the Chinese term to explain why, during the Korean War (1950–1953), some American prisoners of war (POWs) cooperated with their Chinese captors, and even in a few cases defected to their side. British radio operator Robert W. Ford and British army Colonel James Carne also claimed that the Chinese subjected them to brainwashing techniques during their imprisonment.

The U.S. military and government laid charges of brainwashing in an effort to undermine confessions made by POWs to war crimes, including biological warfare. After Chinese radio broadcasts claimed to quote Frank Schwable, Chief of Staff of the First Marine Air Wing admitting to participating in germ warfare, United Nations commander General Mark W. Clark asserted: &quot;Whether these statements ever passed the lips of these unfortunate men is doubtful. If they did, however, too familiar are the mind-annihilating methods of these Communists in extorting whatever words they want ... The men themselves are not to blame, and they have my deepest sympathy for having been used in this abominable way.&quot;

Beginning in 1953, Robert Jay Lifton interviewed American servicemen who had been POWs during the Korean War as well as priests, students, and teachers who had been held in prison in China after 1951. In addition to interviews with 25 Americans and Europeans, Lifton interviewed 15 Chinese citizens who had fled after having been subjected to indoctrination in Chinese universities. (Lifton&#x27;s 1961 book &quot;Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism: A Study of &quot;Brainwashing&quot; in China&quot;, was based on this research.) Lifton found that when the POWs returned to the United States their thinking soon returned to normal, contrary to the popular image of &quot;brainwashing.&quot;

In 1956, after reexamining the concept of brainwashing following the Korean War, the U.S. Army published a report entitled &quot;Communist Interrogation, Indoctrination, and Exploitation of Prisoners of War&quot;, which called brainwashing a &quot;popular misconception&quot;. The report concludes that &quot;exhaustive research of several government agencies failed to reveal even one conclusively documented case of &#x27;brainwashing&#x27; of an American prisoner of war in Korea.&quot;

==Legal cases and the &quot;brainwashing defense&quot;==

The concept of brainwashing has been raised in defense of criminal charges. The 1969 to 1971 case of Charles Manson, who was said to have brainwashed his followers to commit murder and other crimes, brought the issue to renewed public attention.

In 1974, Patty Hearst, a member of the wealthy Hearst family, when 19 years old was kidnapped by the Symbionese Liberation Army, a left-wing militant organization. After several weeks of captivity, she agreed to join the group and took part in their activities. In 1975, she was arrested and charged with bank robbery and the use of a gun in committing a felony. Her attorney, F. Lee Bailey, argued in her trial that she should not be held responsible for her actions since her treatment by her captors was the equivalent of the alleged brainwashing of Korean War POWs (see also Diminished responsibility). Bailey developed his case in conjunction with psychiatrist Louis Jolyon West and psychologist Margaret Singer. They had both studied the experiences of Korean War POWs. (In 1996, Singer published her theories in her best-selling book &quot;Cults in Our Midst&quot;.) Despite this defense, Hearst was found guilty.

In 1990, Steven Fishman, who was a member of the Church of Scientology, was charged with mail fraud for conducting a scheme to sue large corporations via conspiring with minority stockholders in shareholder class action lawsuits. Fishman&#x27;s attorneys notified the court that they intended to rely on an insanity defense, using the theories of brainwashing and the expert witnesses of Singer and Richard Ofshe to claim that the Church of Scientology had practiced brainwashing on him, which left him unsuitable to make independent decisions.

The court ruled that the use of brainwashing theories is inadmissible in expert witnesses, citing the Frye standard, which states that scientific theories utilized by expert witnesses must be generally accepted in their respective fields. Since then, United States courts have consistently rejected testimony about mind control or brainwashing on the grounds that these theories are not part of accepted science under the Frye standard.

In 2003, the brainwashing defense was used unsuccessfully in defense of Lee Boyd Malvo, who was charged with murder for his part in the D.C. sniper attacks. Allegations of brainwashing have also been raised by plaintiffs in child custody cases.

Thomas Andrew Green, in his 2014 book &quot;Freedom and Criminal Responsibility in American Legal Thought&quot;, argues that the brainwashing defense undermines the law&#x27;s fundamental premise of free will. In 2003, forensic psychologist Dick Anthony said that &quot;no reasonable person would question that there are situations where people can be influenced against their best interests, but those arguments are evaluated based on fact, not bogus expert testimony.&quot;

==Anti-cult movement==

In the 1970s and 1980s, the anti-cult movement applied the concept of brainwashing to explain religious conversions to some new religious movements (NRMs) and other groups that they considered cults. News media reports tended to accept their view and social scientists sympathetic to the anti-cult movement, who were usually psychologists, revised models of brainwashing. While some psychologists were receptive to the concept, most sociologists were skeptical of its ability to explain conversion. Critics of some Mormonism have accused it of brainwashing.

Philip Zimbardo defined mind control as &quot;the process by which individual or collective freedom of choice and action is compromised by agents or agencies that modify or distort perception, motivation, affect, cognition or behavioral outcomes.&quot; He suggested that any human being is susceptible to such manipulation.

Benjamin Zablocki, late professor of sociology at Rutgers University said that the number of people who attest to brainwashing in interviews (performed in accordance with guidelines of the National Institute of Mental Health and National Science Foundation) is too large to result from anything other than a genuine phenomenon. He said that in the two most prestigious journals dedicated to the sociology of religion there have been no articles &quot;supporting the brainwashing perspective,&quot; while over one hundred such articles have been published in other journals &quot;marginal to the field.&quot; He concluded that the concept of brainwashing had been blacklisted.

Eileen Barker criticized the concept of brainwashing because it functioned to justify costly interventions such as deprogramming or exit counseling. She has also criticized some mental health professionals, including Singer, for accepting expert witness jobs in court cases involving NRMs. Barker&#x27;s 1984 book, &quot;The Making of a Moonie: Choice or Brainwashing?&quot;, describes the religious conversion process to the Unification Church (whose members are sometimes informally referred to as &quot;Moonies&quot;), which had been one of the best-known groups said to practice brainwashing. Barker spent close to seven years studying Unification Church members and wrote that she rejects the &quot;brainwashing&quot; theory because it does not explain why many people attended a recruitment meeting and did not become members nor why so many members voluntarily disaffiliate or leave groups. 

James Richardson said that if the new religious movements had access to powerful brainwashing techniques, one would expect that they would have high growth rates, yet in fact, most have not had notable success in recruiting or retaining members. For this and other reasons, sociologists of religion including David Bromley and Anson Shupe consider the idea that &quot;cults&quot; are brainwashing American youth to be implausible.

Thomas Robbins, Massimo Introvigne, Lorne Dawson, Gordon Melton, Marc Galanter, and Saul Levine, amongst other scholars researching NRMs, have argued and established to the satisfaction of courts, relevant professional associations and scientific communities that there exists no generally accepted scientific theory, based upon methodologically sound research, that supports the concept of brainwashing.

In 1999, forensic psychologist Dick Anthony criticized another adherent to this view, Jean-Marie Abgrall, for allegedly employing a pseudoscientific approach and lacking any evidence that anyone&#x27;s worldview was substantially changed by these coercive methods. He claimed that the concept and the fear surrounding it was used as a tool for the anti-cult movement to rationalize the persecution of minority religious groups. Additionally, Anthony, in the book &quot;Misunderstanding Cults&quot;, argues that the term &quot;brainwashing&quot; has such sensationalist connotations that its use is detrimental to any further scientific inquiry.

In 2016, Israeli anthropologist of religion and fellow at the Van Leer Jerusalem Institute Adam Klin-Oron said about then proposed &quot;anti-cult&quot; legislation: 
==Scientific research==
===Research by the U.S. government===
For 20 years, starting in the early 1950s, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the U.S. Department of Defense conducted secret research, including Project MKUltra, in an attempt to develop practical brainwashing techniques; These experiments ranged &quot;from electroshock to high doses of LSD&quot;. 

The director Sidney Gottlieb and his team were apparently able to &quot;blast away the existing mind&quot; of a human being by using torture techniques; however, reprogramming, in terms of finding &quot;a way to insert a new mind into that resulting void&quot;, was not so successful.

Controversial psychiatrist Colin A. Ross claims that the CIA was successful in creating programmable so-called &quot;Manchurian Candidates&quot; even at the time. The CIA experiments using various psychedelic drugs such as LSD and Mescaline drew from previous Nazi human experimentation.

In 1979, John D. Marks wrote in his book &quot;The Search for the Manchurian Candidate&quot; that until the MKUltra program was effectively terminated in 1963, the agency&#x27;s researchers had found no reliable way to brainwash another person, as all experiments at some stage always ended in either amnesia or catatonia, making any operational use impossible.

A bipartisan Senate Armed Services Committee report, released in part in December 2008 and in full in April 2009, reported that U.S. military trainers who came to Guantánamo Bay in December 2002 had based an interrogation class on a chart copied from a 1957 Air Force study of &quot;Chinese Communist&quot; brainwashing techniques used to elicit false confessions from American POWs during the Korean War. The report showed how the Secretary of Defense&#x27;s 2002 authorization of the aggressive techniques at Guantánamo led to their use in Afghanistan and in Iraq, including at Abu Ghraib.

===American Psychological Association Task Force===
In 1983, the American Psychological Association (APA) asked Singer to chair a task force called the APA Task Force on Deceptive and Indirect Techniques of Persuasion and Control (DIMPAC) to investigate whether brainwashing or coercive persuasion did indeed control cults members. The Task Force concluded that: On 11 May 1987, the APA&#x27;s Board of Social and Ethical Responsibility for Psychology (BSERP) rejected the DIMPAC report because the report &quot;lacks the scientific rigor and evenhanded critical approach necessary for APA imprimatur&quot; and concluded that &quot;after much consideration, BSERP does not believe that we have sufficient information available to guide us in taking a position on this issue.&quot;

==Other areas and studies==

Joost Meerloo, a Dutch psychiatrist, was an early proponent of the concept of brainwashing. &quot;Menticide&quot; is a neologism he coined meaning &quot;killing of the mind&quot;. Meerloo&#x27;s view was influenced by his experiences during the German occupation of his country during the Second World War and his work with the Dutch government and the American military in the interrogation of accused Nazi war criminals. He later emigrated to the United States and taught at Columbia University. His best-selling 1956 book, &quot;The Rape of the Mind&quot;, concludes by saying: 
Russian historian Daniel Romanovsky, who interviewed survivors and eyewitnesses in the 1970s, reported on what he called &quot;Nazi brainwashing&quot; of the people of Belarus by the occupying Germans during the Second World War, which took place through both mass propaganda and intense re-education, especially in schools. Romanovsky noted that very soon, most people had adopted the Nazi view that the Jews were an inferior race and were closely tied to the Soviet government, views that had not been at all common before the German occupation.

Italy has had controversy over the concept of &quot;plagio&quot;, a crime consisting in an absolute psychological—and eventually physical—domination of a person. The effect is said to be the annihilation of the subject&#x27;s freedom and self-determination and the consequent negation of his or her personality. The crime of plagio has rarely been prosecuted in Italy, and only one person was ever convicted. In 1981, an Italian court found that the concept is imprecise, lacks coherence and is liable to arbitrary application.

Recent scientific book publications in the field of the mental disorder &quot;dissociative identity disorder&quot; (DID) mention torture-based brainwashing by criminal networks and malevolent actors as a deliberate means to create multiple &quot;programmable&quot; personalities in a person to exploit this individual for sexual and financial reasons. Earlier scientific debates in the 1980s and 1990s about torture-based ritual abuse in cults was known as &quot;satanic ritual abuse,&quot; which was mainly viewed as a &quot;moral panic.&quot;

&quot;Brain-Washing: A Synthesis of the Russian Textbook on Psychopolitics&quot; published by the Church of Scientology in 1955 about brainwashing. L. Ron Hubbard authored the text and alleged it was the secret manual written by Lavrentiy Beria, the Soviet secret police chief, in 1936. When the FBI ignored him, Hubbard wrote again stating that Soviet agents had, on three occasions, attempted to hire him to work against the United States, and were upset about his refusal, and that one agent specifically attacked him using electroshock as a weapon.

Kathleen Barry, co-founder of the United Nations NGO, the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women (CATW), prompted international awareness of human sex trafficking in her 1979 book &quot;Female Sexual Slavery&quot;. In his 1986 book &quot;Woman Abuse: Facts Replacing Myths,&quot; Lewis Okun reported that: &quot;Kathleen Barry shows in &quot;Female Sexual Slavery&quot; that forced female prostitution involves coercive control practices very similar to thought reform.&quot; In their 1996 book, &quot;Casting Stones: Prostitution and Liberation in Asia and the United States&quot;, Rita Nakashima Brock and Susan Brooks Thistlethwaite report that the methods commonly used by pimps to control their victims &quot;closely resemble the brainwashing techniques of terrorists and paranoid cults.&quot;

In his 2000 book, &quot;Destroying the World to Save It: Aum Shinrikyo, Apocalyptic Violence, and the New Global Terrorism&quot;, Robert Lifton applied his original ideas about thought reform to Aum Shinrikyo and the War on Terrorism, concluding that, in this context, thought reform was possible without violence or physical coercion. He also pointed out that in their efforts against terrorism, Western governments were also using some alleged mind control techniques.

In her 2004 popular science book, &quot;&quot;, neuroscientist and physiologist Kathleen Taylor reviewed the history of mind control theories, as well as notable incidents. In it, she theorized that persons under the influence of brainwashing may have more rigid neurological pathways, and that can make it more difficult to rethink situations or to be able to later reorganize these pathways.

In 2006 &quot;&quot; () is a non-fiction book published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton about the evolution of brainwashing from its origins in the Cold War through to today&#x27;s War on Terror. The author, Dominic Streatfeild,
uses formerly classified documentation and interviews from the CIA.

==In popular culture==
In George Orwell&#x27;s 1949 dystopian novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, the main character is subjected to imprisonment, isolation, and torture to conform his thoughts and emotions to the wishes of the rulers of the book&#x27;s fictional future totalitarian society. The torturer representing the authorities says, &quot;We make the brain perfect before we blow it out...Everyone is washed clean.&quot; Orwell&#x27;s vision influenced Hunter and is still reflected in the popular concept of brainwashing.

In the 1950s, some American films were made that featured brainwashing of POWs, including &quot;The Rack&quot;, &quot;The Bamboo Prison&quot;, &quot;Toward the Unknown&quot;, and &quot;The Fearmakers&quot;. &quot;Forbidden Area&quot; told the story of Soviet secret agents who had been brainwashed through classical conditioning by their own government so they wouldn&#x27;t reveal their identities. In 1962, &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; (based on the 1959 novel by Richard Condon) &quot;put brainwashing front and center&quot; by featuring a plot by the Soviet government to take over the United States by using a brainwashed sleeper agent for political assassination. The concept of brainwashing became popularly associated with the research of Russian psychologist Ivan Pavlov, which mostly involved dogs as subjects. In &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; the head brainwasher is &quot;Dr. Yen Lo, of the Pavlov Institute.&quot;

The science fiction stories of Cordwainer Smith (pen name of Paul Myron Anthony Linebarger (1913–1966), a U.S. Army officer who specialized in military intelligence and psychological warfare during the Second World War and the Korean War) depict brainwashing to remove memories of traumatic events as a normal and benign part of future medical practice.

Brainwashing remains an important theme in science fiction. A subgenre is &quot;corporate mind control&quot;, in which a future society is run by one or more business corporations that dominate society, using advertising and mass media to control the population&#x27;s thoughts and feelings. Terry O&#x27;Brien commented: &quot;Mind control is such a powerful image that if hypnotism did not exist, then something similar would have to have been invented: The plot device is too useful for any writer to ignore. The fear of mind control is equally as powerful an image.&quot;

<doc id="20950" wikidata="Q130796" url="?curid=20950" title="Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact">
<text>The Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, officially the Treaty of Non-Aggression between Germany and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and also known as the Hitler–Stalin Pact and the Nazi–Soviet Pact, was a non-aggression pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, with a secret protocol establishing Soviet and German spheres of influence across Eastern Europe. The pact was signed in Moscow on 24 August 1939 (backdated 23 August 1939) by Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov and German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop. 

The treaty was the culmination of negotiations around the 1938–1939 deal discussions, after tripartite discussions with the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and France had broken down, and committed neither government would aid or ally itself with an enemy of the other, for the next 10 years. Under the Secret Protocol, Poland was to be shared, while Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Finland and Bessarabia went to the Soviet Union. The protocol also recognized the interest of Lithuania in the Vilnius region. In the west, rumoured existence of the Secret Protocol was proven only when it was made public during the Nuremberg trials.

A week after signing the pact, on 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland. On 17 September, one day after a Soviet–Japanese ceasefire came into effect after the Battles of Khalkhin Gol, and one day after the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union approved the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, Stalin, stating concern for ethnic Ukrainians and Belarusians in Poland, ordered the Soviet invasion of Poland. After a short war ending in military defeat for Poland, Germany and the Soviet Union drew up a new border between them on formerly Polish territory in the supplementary protocol of the German–Soviet Frontier Treaty.

In March 1940, parts of the Karelia, and eastern parts of Salla and Kuusamo regions as well, in Finland were annexed by the Soviet Union following the Winter War. The Soviet annexation of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and parts of Romania (Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina and the Hertsa region) followed. Stalin&#x27;s invasion of Bukovina in 1940 violated the pact, since it went beyond the Soviet sphere of influence that had been agreed with the Axis.

The territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union following the 1939 Soviet invasion east of the Curzon line remained in the Soviet Union after the war and are now in Ukraine and Belarus. Vilnius was given to Lithuania. Only Podlaskie and a small part of Galicia east of the San River, around Przemyśl, were returned to Poland. Of all the other territories annexed by the Soviet Union in 1939–1940, those detached from Finland (Western Karelia, Hanko) Estonia (Estonian Ingria and Petseri County) and Latvia (Abrene) remain part of Russia, the successor state to the Russian SFSR and the Soviet Union after the collapse of the USSR in 1991. The territories annexed from Romania were also integrated into the Soviet Union (such as the Moldavian SSR, or oblasts of the Ukrainian SSR). The core of Bessarabia now forms Moldova. Northern Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina and the Hertsa region now form the Chernivtsi Oblast of Ukraine. Southern Bessarabia is part of the Odessa Oblast, which is also now in Ukraine.

The pact was terminated on 22 June 1941, when Germany launched Operation Barbarossa and invaded the Soviet Union, in pursuit of the ideological goal of &quot;Lebensraum&quot;. The Anglo-Soviet Agreement succeeded it. After the war, Ribbentrop was convicted of war crimes at the Nuremberg trials and executed in 1946, whilst Molotov died in 1986.

==Background==

The outcome of World War I was disastrous for both the German and the Russian empires. The Russian Civil War broke out in late 1917 after the Bolshevik Revolution and Vladimir Lenin, the first leader of the new Soviet Russia, recognised the independence of Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. Moreover, facing a German military advance, Lenin and Trotsky were forced to agree to the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which ceded many western Russian territories to Germany. After the German collapse, a multinational Allied-led army intervened in the civil war (1917–1922).

On 16 April 1922, the German Weimar Republic and the Soviet Union agreed to the Treaty of Rapallo in which they renounced territorial and financial claims against each other. Each party also pledged neutrality in the event of an attack against the other with the Treaty of Berlin (1926). Trade between the two countries had fallen sharply after World War I, but trade agreements signed in the mid-1920s helped to increase trade to per year by 1927.

At the beginning of the 1930s, the Nazi Party&#x27;s rise to power increased tensions between Germany and the Soviet Union, along with other countries with ethnic Slavs, who were considered &quot;Untermenschen&quot; (subhuman) according to Nazi racial ideology. Moreover, the antisemitic Nazis associated ethnic Jews with both communism and financial capitalism, both of which they opposed. Nazi theory held that Slavs in the Soviet Union were being ruled by &quot;Jewish Bolshevik&quot; masters. Hitler had spoken of an inevitable battle for the acquisition of land for Germany in the east. The resulting manifestation of German anti-Bolshevism and an increase in Soviet foreign debts caused a dramatic decline in German–Soviet trade. Imports of Soviet goods to Germany fell to in 1934 by the more isolationist Stalinist regime asserting power and by the abandonment of postwar Treaty of Versailles military controls, both of which decreased Germany&#x27;s reliance on Soviet imports.

In 1935 Germany, after a previous German–Polish declaration of non-aggression, Hermann Goring proposed a military alliance with Poland against the Soviet Union, but this was rejected.

In 1936, Germany and Fascist Italy supported the Spanish Nationalists in the Spanish Civil War, but the Soviets supported the Spanish Republic. Thus, the Spanish Civil War became a proxy war between Germany and the Soviet Union. In 1936, Germany and Japan entered the Anti-Comintern Pact. and they were joined a year later by Italy, despite Italy having previously signed the Italo-Soviet Pact.

On 31 March 1939, Britain extended a guarantee to Poland that &quot;if any action clearly threatened Polish independence, and if the Poles felt it vital to resist such action by force, Britain would come to their aid&quot;. Hitler was furious since that meant that the British were committed to political interests in Europe and that his land grabs such as the takeover of Czechoslovakia would no longer be taken lightly. His response to the political checkmate would later be heard at a rally in Wilhelmshaven: &quot;No power on earth would be able to break German might, and if the Western Allies thought Germany would stand by while they marshalled their &#x27;satellite states&#x27; to act in their interests, then they were sorely mistaken&quot;. Ultimately, Hitler&#x27;s discontent with a British-Polish alliance led to a restructuring of strategy towards Moscow. Alfred Rosenberg wrote that he had spoken to Hermann Göring of the potential pact with the Soviet Union: &quot;When Germany&#x27;s life is at stake, even a temporary alliance with Moscow must be contemplated&quot;. Sometime in early May 1939 at Berghof, Ribbentrop showed Hitler a film of Stalin viewing his military in a recent parade. Hitler became intrigued with the idea of allying with the Soviets and Ribbentrop recalled Hitler saying that Stalin &quot;looked like a man he could do business with&quot;. Ribbentrop was then given the nod to pursue negotiations with Moscow.

===Munich Conference===
Hitler&#x27;s fierce anti-Soviet rhetoric was one of the reasons that Britain and France decided that Soviet participation in the 1938 Munich Conference on Czechoslovakia would be both dangerous and useless. In the Munich Agreement that followed the conference agreed to a German annexation of part of Czechoslovakia in late 1938, but in early 1939 it had been completely dissolved. The policy of appeasement toward Germany was conducted by the governments of British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and French Prime Minister Édouard Daladier. The policy immediately raised the question of whether the Soviet Union could avoid being next on Hitler&#x27;s list. The Soviet leadership believed that the West wanted to encourage German aggression in the East and to stay neutral in a war initiated by Germany in the hope that Germany and the Soviet Union would wear each other out and put an end to both regimes.

For Germany, an autarkic economic approach and an alliance with Britain were impossible and so closer relations with the Soviet Union to obtain raw materials became necessary. Besides economic reasons, an expected British blockade during a war would also create massive shortages for Germany in a number of key raw materials. After the Munich Agreement, the resulting increase in German military supply needs and Soviet demands for military machinery made talks between the two countries occur from late 1938 to March 1939. Also, the third Soviet five-year plan required new infusions of technology and industrial equipment. German war planners had estimated serious shortfalls of raw materials if Germany entered a war without the Soviet supply.

On 31 March 1939, in response to Germany&#x27;s defiance of the Munich Agreement and the creation of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, Britain pledged its support and that of France to guarantee the independence of Poland, Belgium, Romania, Greece and Turkey. On 6 April, Poland and Britain agreed to formalise the guarantee as a military alliance, pending negotiations. On 28 April, Hitler denounced the 1934 German–Polish declaration of non-aggression and the 1935 Anglo–German Naval Agreement.

In mid-March 1939, attempting to contain Hitler&#x27;s expansionism, the Soviet Union, Britain and France started to trade a flurry of suggestions and counterplans on a potential political and military agreement. Informal consultations started in April, but the main negotiations began only in May. Meanwhile, throughout early 1939, Germany had secretly hinted to Soviet diplomats that it could offer better terms for a political agreement than could Britain and France.

The Soviet Union, which feared Western powers and the possibility of &quot;capitalist encirclements&quot;, had little hope of preventing war and wanted nothing less than an ironclad military alliance with France and Britain to provide guaranteed support for a two-pronged attack on Germany. Stalin&#x27;s adherence to the collective security line was thus purely conditional. Britain and France believed that war could still be avoided and that since the Soviet Union was so weakened by the Great Purge that it could not be a main military participant. Many military sources were at variance with the last point, especially after the Soviet victories over the Japanese Kwantung Army in the Manchuria. France was more anxious to find an agreement with the Soviet Union than Britain was. As a continental power, France was more willing to make concessions and more fearful of the dangers of an agreement between the Soviet Union and Germany. The contrasting attitudes partly explain why the Soviets have often been charged with playing a double game in 1939 of carrying on open negotiations for an alliance with Britain and France but secretly considering propositions from Germany.

By the end of May, drafts had been formally presented. In mid-June, the main tripartite negotiations started. Discussions were focused on potential guarantees to Central and Eastern Europe in the case of German aggression. The Soviets proposed to consider that a political turn towards Germany by the Baltic states would constitute an &quot;indirect aggression&quot; towards the Soviet Union. Britain opposed such proposals because they feared the Soviets&#x27; proposed language would justify a Soviet intervention in Finland and the Baltic states or push those countries to seek closer relations with Germany. The discussion of a definition of &quot;indirect aggression&quot; became one of the sticking points between the parties, and by mid-July, the tripartite political negotiations effectively stalled while the parties agreed to start negotiations on a military agreement, which the Soviets insisted had to be reached at the same time as any political agreement. One day before the military negotiations began, the Soviet Politburo pessimistically expected the coming negotiations to go nowhere and formally decided to consider German proposals seriously. The military negotiations began on 12 August in Moscow, with a British delegation headed by Admiral Sir Reginald Drax, French delegation headed by General Aimé Doumenc and the Soviet delegation headed by Kliment Voroshilov, the commissar of defence, and Boris Shaposhnikov, chief of the general staff. Without written credentials, Drax was not authorised to guarantee anything to the Soviet Union and had been instructed by the British government to prolong the discussions as long as possible and to avoid answering the question of whether Poland would agree to permit Soviet troops to enter the country if the Germans invaded.

==Negotiations==


===Beginning of secret talks===

From April to July, Soviet and German officials made statements on the potential for the beginning of political negotiations, but no actual negotiations took place. &quot;The Soviet Union had wanted good relations with Germany for years and was happy to see that feeling finally reciprocated&quot;, wrote the historian Gerhard L. Weinberg. The ensuing discussion of a potential political deal between Germany and the Soviet Union had to be channeled into the framework of economic negotiations between the two countries, since close military and diplomatic connections that existed before the mid-1930s had been largely severed. In May, Stalin replaced his foreign minister from 1930 to 1939, Maxim Litvinov, who had advocated rapprochement with the West and was also Jewish, with Vyacheslav Molotov to allow the Soviet Union more latitude in discussions with more parties, instead of only Britain and France.

On 23 August 1939, two Focke-Wulf Condors, containing German diplomats, officials, and photographers (about 20 in each plane), headed by Ribbentrop, descended into Moscow. As the Nazi emissaries stepped off the plane, a Soviet military band played &quot;Deutschland, Deutschland über Alles&quot;. The Nazi arrival was well planned, with all aesthetics in order. The classic hammer and sickle was propped up next to the swastika of the Nazi flag that had been used in a local film studio for Soviet propaganda films. After stepping off the plane and shaking hands, Ribbentrop and Gustav Hilger along with German ambassador Friedrich-Werner von der Schulenburg and Stalin&#x27;s chief bodyguard, Nikolai Vlasik, entered a limousine operated by the NKVD to travel to Red Square. The limousine arrived close to Stalin&#x27;s office and was greeted by Alexander Poskrebyshev, the chief of Stalin&#x27;s personal chancellery. The Germans were led up a flight of stairs to a room with lavish furnishings. Stalin and Molotov greeted the visitors, much to the Nazis&#x27; surprise. It was well known that Stalin avoided meeting foreign visitors, and so his presence at the meeting showed how seriously that the Soviets were taking the negotiations.

In late July and early August 1939, Soviet and German officials agreed on most of the details of a planned economic agreement and specifically addressed a potential political agreement, which the Soviets stated could come only after an economic agreement.

The German presence in the Soviet capital during negotiations can be regarded as rather tense. German pilot Hans Baur recalled that Soviet secret police followed every move. Their job was to inform authorities when he left his residence and where he was headed. Baur&#x27;s guide informed him: &quot;Another car would tack itself onto us and follow us fifty or so yards in the rear, and wherever we went and whatever we did, the secret police would be on our heels.&quot; Baur also recalled trying to tip his Russian driver, which led to a harsh exchange of words: &quot;He was furious. He wanted to know whether this was the thanks he got for having done his best for us to get him into prison. We knew perfectly well it was forbidden to take tips.&quot;

===August negotiations===

In early August, Germany and the Soviet Union worked out the last details of their economic deal and started to discuss a political agreement. Both countries&#x27; diplomats explained to each other the reasons for the hostility in their foreign policy in the 1930s and found common ground in both countries&#x27; anticapitalism with Karl Schnurre stating: &quot;there is one common element in the ideology of Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union: opposition to the capitalist democracies&quot; or that &quot;it seems to us rather unnatural that a socialist state would stand on the side of the western democracies&quot;.

At the same time, British, French, and Soviet negotiators scheduled three-party talks on military matters to occur in Moscow in August 1939 that aimed to define what the agreement would specify on the reaction of the three powers to a German attack. The tripartite military talks, started in mid-August, hit a sticking point on the passage of Soviet troops through Poland if Germans attacked, and the parties waited as British and French officials overseas pressured Polish officials to agree to such terms. Polish officials refused to allow Soviet troops into Polish territory if Germany attacked; Polish Foreign Minister Józef Beck pointed out that the Polish government feared that if the Red Army entered Polish territory, it would never leave.

On 19 August, the 1939 German–Soviet Commercial Agreement was finally signed. On 21 August, the Soviets suspended the tripartite military talks and cited other reasons. The same day, Stalin received assurances that Germany would approve secret protocols to the proposed non-aggression pact that would place the half of Poland east of the Vistula River as well as Latvia, Estonia, Finland and Bessarabia in the Soviet sphere of influence. That night, Stalin replied that the Soviets were willing to sign the pact and that he would receive Ribbentrop on 23 August.

===News leaks===

On 25 August 1939, the &quot;New York Times&quot; ran a front-page story by Otto D. Tolischus, &quot;Nazi Talks Secret&quot;, whose subtitle included &quot;Soviet and Reich Agree on East&quot;. On 26 August 1939, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported Japanese anger and French communist surprise over the pact. The same day, however, Tolischus filed a story that noted Nazi troops on the move near Gleiwitz (now Gliwice), which led to the false flag Gleiwitz incident on 31 August 1939. On 28 August 1939, the &quot;New York Times&quot; was still reporting on fears of a Gleiwitz raid. On 29 August 1939, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that the Supreme Soviet had failed on its first day of convening to act on the pact. The same day, the &quot;New York Times&quot; also reported from Montreal, Canada, that American Professor Samuel N. Harper of the University of Chicago had stated publicly his belief that &quot;the Russo-German non-aggression pact conceals an agreement whereby Russia and Germany may have planned spheres of influence for Eastern Europe&quot;. On 30 August 1939, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported a Soviet buildup on its Western frontiers by moving 200,000 troops from the Far East.

==Secret protocol==
On 22 August, one day after talks broke down with France and Britain, Moscow revealed that Ribbentrop would visit Stalin the next day. The Soviets were still negotiating with the British and the French missions in Moscow. With the Western nations unwilling to accede to Soviet demands, Stalin instead entered a secret German–Soviet pact. On 23 August, a ten-year non-aggression pact was signed with provisions that included consultation, arbitration if either party disagreed, neutrality if either went to war against a third power and no membership of a group &quot;which is directly or indirectly aimed at the other&quot;. The article &quot;On Soviet–German Relations&quot; in the Soviet newspaper &quot;Izvestia&quot; of 21 August 1939, stated:

There was also a secret protocol to the pact, which was revealed only after Germany&#x27;s defeat in 1945 although hints about its provisions had been leaked much earlier, so as to influence Lithuania. According to the protocol, Poland, Romania, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Finland were divided into German and Soviet &quot;spheres of influence&quot;. In the north, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia were assigned to the Soviet sphere. Poland was to be partitioned in the event of its &quot;political rearrangement&quot;: the areas east of the Pisa, Narew, Vistula, and San rivers would go to the Soviet Union, and Germany would occupy the west. Lithuania, which was adjacent to East Prussia, was assigned to the German sphere of influence, but a second secret protocol, agreed to in September 1939, reassigned Lithuania to the Soviet Union. According to the protocol, Lithuania would be granted its historical capital, Vilnius, which was part of Poland during the interwar period. Another clause stipulated that Germany would not interfere with the Soviet Union&#x27;s actions towards Bessarabia, which was then part of Romania. As a result, Bessarabia as well as the Northern Bukovina and Hertsa regions were occupied by the Soviets and integrated into the Soviet Union.

At the signing, Ribbentrop and Stalin enjoyed warm conversations, exchanged toasts and further addressed the prior hostilities between the countries in the 1930s. They characterised Britain as always attempting to disrupt Soviet–German relations and stated that the Anti-Comintern Pact was aimed not at the Soviet Union but actually at Western democracies and &quot;frightened principally the City of London [British financiers] and the English shopkeepers.&quot;

== Revelation ==
The agreement stunned the world. John Gunther, in Moscow in August 1939, recalled how the news of the 19 August commercial agreement surprised journalists and diplomats, who hoped for world peace. They did not expect the 21 August announcement of the non-aggression pact: &quot;Nothing more unbelievable could be imagined. Astonishment and skepticism turned quickly to consternation and alarm&quot;. The news was met with utter shock and surprise by government leaders and media worldwide, most of whom were aware of only the British–French–Soviet negotiations, which had taken place for months; by Germany&#x27;s allies, notably Japan; by the Comintern and foreign Communist parties; and Jewish communities all around the world.

On 24 August, &quot;Pravda&quot; and &quot;Izvestia&quot; carried news of the pact&#x27;s public portions, complete with the now-famous front-page picture of Molotov signing the treaty with a smiling Stalin looking on. The same day, German diplomat Hans von Herwarth, whose grandmother was Jewish, informed Italian diplomat Guido Relli and American chargé d&#x27;affaires Charles Bohlen of the secret protocol on the vital interests in the countries&#x27; allotted &quot;spheres of influence&quot; but failed to reveal the annexation rights for &quot;territorial and political rearrangement&quot;. The agreement&#x27;s public terms so exceeded the terms of an ordinary non-aggression treaty—requiring that both parties consult with each other, and not aid a third party attacking either—that Gunther heard a joke that Stalin had joined the anti-Comintern pact. &quot;Time Magazine&quot; repeatedly referred to the Pact as the &quot;Communazi Pact&quot; and its participants as &quot;communazis&quot; until April 1941.

Soviet propaganda and representatives went to great lengths to minimize the importance of the fact that they had opposed and fought the Germans in various ways for a decade prior to signing the pact. Molotov tried to reassure the Germans of his good intentions by commenting to journalists that &quot;fascism is a matter of taste&quot;. For its part, Germany also did a public volte-face regarding its virulent opposition to the Soviet Union, but Hitler still viewed an attack on the Soviet Union as &quot;inevitable&quot;.

Concerns over the possible existence of a secret protocol were expressed first by the intelligence organizations of the Baltic states only days after the pact was signed. Speculation grew stronger when Soviet negotiators referred to its content during the negotiations for military bases in those countries (see occupation of the Baltic States).

The day after the pact was signed, the Franco-British military delegation urgently requested a meeting with Soviet military negotiator Kliment Voroshilov. On 25 August, Voroshilov told them that &quot;in view of the changed political situation, no useful purpose can be served in continuing the conversation&quot;. The same day, Hitler told the British ambassador to Berlin that the pact with the Soviets prevented Germany from facing a two-front war, which changed the strategic situation from that in World War I, and that Britain should accept his demands on Poland.

On 25 August, Hitler was surprised when Britain joined a defense pact with Poland. Hitler postponed his plans for an invasion of Poland on 26 August to 1 September. In accordance with the defence pact, Britain and France declared war on Germany on 3 September.

==Consequences in Finland, Poland, the Baltic States and Romania==
===Initial invasions===
On 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland from the west. Within a few days, Germany began conducting massacres of Polish and Jewish civilians and POWs, which took place in over 30 towns and villages in the first month of the German occupation. The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; also took part by strafing fleeing civilian refugees on roads and by carrying out a bombing campaign. The Soviet Union assisted German air forces by allowing them to use signals broadcast by the Soviet radio station at Minsk, allegedly &quot;for urgent aeronautical experiments&quot;.
Hitler declared at Danzig:

In the opinion of Robert Service, Stalin did not move instantly but was waiting to see whether the Germans would halt within the agreed area, and the Soviet Union also needed to secure the frontier in the Soviet–Japanese Border Wars. On 17 September, the Red Army invaded Poland, violating the 1932 Soviet–Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and occupied the Polish territory assigned to it by the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. That was followed by co-ordination with German forces in Poland. Polish troops already fighting much stronger German forces on its west desperately tried to delay the capture of Warsaw. Consequently, Polish forces could not mount significant resistance against the Soviets. On 18 September, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published an editorial arguing that &quot;Hitlerism is brown communism, Stalinism is red fascism...The world will now understand that the only real &#x27;ideological&#x27; issue is one between democracy, liberty and peace on the one hand and despotism, terror and war on the other.&quot;

On 21 September, Marshal of the Soviet Union Voroshilov, German military attaché General Köstring, and other officers signed a formal agreement in Moscow co-ordinating military movements in Poland, including the &quot;purging&quot; of saboteurs and the Red Army assisting with destruction of the &quot;enemy&quot;. Joint German–Soviet parades were held in Lviv and Brest-Litovsk, and the countries&#x27; military commanders met in the latter city. Stalin had decided in August that he was going to liquidate the Polish state, and a German–Soviet meeting in September addressed the future structure of the &quot;Polish region&quot;. Soviet authorities immediately started a campaign of Sovietisation of the newly acquired areas. The Soviets organised staged elections, the result of which was to become a legitimisation of the Soviet annexation of eastern Poland.

===Modification of secret protocols===

Eleven days after the Soviet invasion of the Polish Kresy, the secret protocol of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact was modified by the German–Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Demarcation, allotting Germany a larger part of Poland and transferring Lithuania, with the exception of the left bank of the River Scheschupe, the &quot;Lithuanian Strip&quot;, from the envisioned German sphere to the Soviet sphere. On 28 September 1939, the Soviet Union and German Reich issued a joint declaration in which they declared:
On 3 October, Friedrich Werner von der Schulenburg, the German ambassador in Moscow, informed Joachim Ribbentrop that the Soviet government was willing to cede the city of Vilnius and its environs. On 8 October 1939, a new Nazi-Soviet agreement was reached by an exchange of letters between Vyacheslav Molotov and the German ambassador.

The Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania were given no choice but to sign a so-called &quot;Pact of Defence and Mutual Assistance&quot;, which permitted the Soviet Union to station troops in them.

===Soviet war with Finland and Katyn massacre===

After the Baltic states had been forced to accept treaties, Stalin turned his sights on Finland and was confident that its capitulation could be attained without great effort. The Soviets demanded territories on the Karelian Isthmus, the islands of the Gulf of Finland and a military base near the Finnish capital, Helsinki, which Finland rejected. The Soviets staged the shelling of Mainila on 26 November and used it as a pretext to withdraw from the Soviet–Finnish Non-Aggression Pact. On 30 November, the Red Army invaded Finland, launching the Winter War with the aim of annexing Finland into the Soviet Union. The Soviets formed the Finnish Democratic Republic to govern Finland after Soviet conquest. The leader of the Leningrad Military District, Andrei Zhdanov, commissioned a celebratory piece from Dmitri Shostakovich, &quot;Suite on Finnish Themes&quot;, to be performed as the marching bands of the Red Army would be parading through Helsinki. After Finnish defenses surprisingly held out for over three months and inflicted stiff losses on Soviet forces, under the command of Semyon Timoshenko, the Soviets settled for an interim peace. Finland ceded parts of Karelia, Kuusamo, and Salla together with Hanko leased as a naval base (9% of Finnish territory), which resulted in approximately 422,000 Finns (12% of Finland&#x27;s population) losing their homes. Soviet official casualty counts in the war exceeded 200,000 although Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev later claimed that the casualties may have been one million.

Around that time, after several Gestapo–NKVD conferences, Soviet NKVD officers also conducted lengthy interrogations of 300,000 Polish POWs in camps that were a selection process to determine who would be killed. On 5 March 1940, in what would later be known as the Katyn massacre, 22,000 members of the military as well as intellectuals were executed, labelled &quot;nationalists and counterrevolutionaries&quot; or kept at camps and prisons in western Ukraine and Belarus.

===Soviet Union occupies the Baltic states and part of Romania===
In mid-June 1940, while international attention focused on the German invasion of France, Soviet NKVD troops raided border posts in Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia.
State administrations were liquidated and replaced by Soviet cadres, who deported or killed 34,250 Latvians, 75,000 Lithuanians and almost 60,000 Estonians. Elections took place, with a single pro-Soviet candidate listed for many positions, and the resulting people&#x27;s assemblies immediately requesting admission into the Soviet Union, which was granted. (The Soviets annexed the whole of Lithuania, including the Šešupė area, which had been earmarked for Germany.)

Finally, on 26 June, four days after the armistice between France and Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union issued an ultimatum that demanded Bessarabia and unexpectedly Northern Bukovina from Romania. Two days later, the Romanians acceded to the Soviet demands, and the Soviets occupied the territories. The Hertsa region was initially not requested by the Soviets but was later occupied by force after the Romanians had agreed to the initial Soviet demands. The subsequent waves of deportations began in Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina.

===Beginnings of Operation Tannenberg and other Nazi atrocities===

At the end of October 1939, Germany enacted the death penalty for disobedience to the German occupation. Germany began a campaign of &quot;Germanization&quot;, which meant assimilating the occupied territories politically, culturally, socially and economically into the German Reich. 50,000–200,000 Polish children were kidnapped to be Germanised.
The elimination of Polish elites and intelligentsia was part of &quot;Generalplan Ost&quot;. The &quot;Intelligenzaktion&quot;, a plan to eliminate the Polish intelligentsia, Poland&#x27;s &#x27;leadership class&#x27;, took place soon after the German invasion of Poland and lasted from fall of 1939 to the spring of 1940. As the result of the operation, in ten regional actions, about 60,000 Polish nobles, teachers, social workers, priests, judges and political activists were killed. It was continued in May 1940, when Germany launched &quot;AB-Aktion&quot;, More than 16,000 members of the intelligentsia were murdered in Operation Tannenberg alone.

Germany also planned to incorporate all of the land into Nazi Germany. That effort resulted in the forced resettlement of two million Poles. Families were forced to travel in the severe winter of 1939–1940, leaving behind almost all of their possessions without compensation. As part of Operation Tannenberg alone, 750,000 Polish peasants were forced to leave, and their property was given to Germans. A further 330,000 were murdered. Germany planned the eventual move of ethnic Poles to Siberia.

Although Germany used forced labourers in most other occupied countries, Poles and other Slavs were viewed as inferior by Nazi propaganda and thus better suited for such duties. Between 1 and 2.5 million Polish citizens were transported to the Reich for forced labour. All Polish males were made to perform forced labour. While ethnic Poles were subject to selective persecution, all ethnic Jews were targeted by the Reich. In the winter of 1939–40, about 100,000 Jews were thus deported to Poland. They were initially gathered into massive urban ghettos, such as the 380,000 held in the Warsaw Ghetto, where large numbers died of starvation and diseases under their harsh conditions, including 43,000 in the Warsaw Ghetto alone. Poles and ethnic Jews were imprisoned in nearly every camp of the extensive concentration camp system in German-occupied Poland and the Reich. In Auschwitz, which began operating on 14 June 1940, 1.1 million people perished.

===Romania and Soviet republics===
In the summer of 1940, fear of the Soviet Union, in conjunction with German support for the territorial demands of Romania&#x27;s neighbours and the Romanian government&#x27;s own miscalculations, resulted in more territorial losses for Romania. Between 28 June and 4 July, the Soviet Union occupied and annexed Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina and the Hertsa region of Romania.

On 30 August, Ribbentrop and Italian Foreign Minister Galeazzo Ciano issued the Second Vienna Award, giving Northern Transylvania to Hungary. On 7 September, Romania ceded Southern Dobruja to Bulgaria (Axis-sponsored Treaty of Craiova). After various events over the following months, Romania increasingly took on the aspect of a German-occupied country.

The Soviet-occupied territories were converted into republics of the Soviet Union. During the two years after the annexation, the Soviets arrested approximately 100,000 Polish citizens and deported between 350,000 and 1,500,000, of whom between 250,000 and 1,000,000 died, mostly civilians. Forced re-settlements into gulag labour camps and exile settlements in remote areas of the Soviet Union occurred. According to Norman Davies, almost half of them were dead by July 1940.

===Further secret protocol modifications settling borders and immigration issues===

On 10 January 1941, Germany and the Soviet Union signed an agreement settling several ongoing issues. Secret protocols in the new agreement modified the &quot;Secret Additional Protocols&quot; of the German–Soviet Boundary and Friendship Treaty, ceding the Lithuanian Strip to the Soviet Union in exchange for US$7.5 million (). The agreement formally set the border between Germany and the Soviet Union between the Igorka River and the Baltic Sea. It also extended trade regulation of the 1940 German-Soviet Commercial Agreement until 1 August 1942, increased deliveries above the levels of the first year of that agreement, settled trading rights in the Baltics and Bessarabia, calculated the compensation for German property interests in the Baltic states that were now occupied by the Soviets and covered other issues. It also covered the migration to Germany within months of ethnic Germans and German citizens in Soviet-held Baltic territories and the migration to the Soviet Union of Baltic and &quot;White Russian&quot; &quot;nationals&quot; in the German-held territories.

==Soviet–German relations==
===Early political issues===
Before the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact was announced, Western communists denied that such a treaty would be signed. Herbert Biberman, a future member of the Hollywood Ten, denounced rumours as &quot;Fascist propaganda&quot;. Earl Browder, the head of the Communist Party USA, stated that &quot;there is as much chance of agreement as of Earl Browder being elected president of the Chamber of Commerce.&quot; Gunther wrote, however, that some knew &quot;communism and Fascism were more closely allied than was normally understood&quot;, and Ernst von Weizsäcker had told Nevile Henderson on 16 August that the Soviet Union would &quot;join in sharing in the Polish spoils&quot;. In September 1939, the Comintern suspended all anti-Nazi and anti-fascist propaganda and explained that the war in Europe was a matter of capitalist states attacking one another for imperialist purposes. Western communists acted accordingly; although they had previously supported collective security, they now denounced Britain and France for going to war.

When anti-German demonstrations erupted in Prague, Czechoslovakia, the Comintern ordered the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia to employ all of its strength to paralyse &quot;chauvinist elements&quot;. Moscow soon forced the French Communist Party and the Communist Party of Great Britain to adopt anti-war positions. On 7 September, Stalin called Georgi Dimitrov, who sketched a new Comintern line on the war that stated that the war was unjust and imperialist, which was approved by the secretariat of the Comintern on 9 September. Thus, western communist parties now had to oppose the war and to vote against war credits. Although the French communists had unanimously voted in Parliament for war credits on 2 September and declared their &quot;unshakeable will&quot; to defend the country on 19 September, the Comintern formally instructed the party to condemn the war as imperialist on 27 September. By 1 October, the French communists advocated listening to German peace proposals, and leader Maurice Thorez deserted from the French Army on 4 October and fled to Russia. Other communists also deserted from the army.

The Communist Party of Germany featured similar attitudes. In &quot;Die Welt&quot;, a communist newspaper published in Stockholm the exiled communist leader Walter Ulbricht opposed the Allies, stated that Britain represented &quot;the most reactionary force in the world&quot;, and argued, &quot;The German government declared itself ready for friendly relations with the Soviet Union, whereas the English–French war bloc desires a war against the socialist Soviet Union. The Soviet people and the working people of Germany have an interest in preventing the English war plan&quot;.

Despite a warning by the Comintern, German tensions were raised when the Soviets stated in September that they must enter Poland to &quot;protect&quot; their ethnic Ukrainian and Belarusian brethren from Germany. Molotov later admitted to German officials that the excuse was necessary because the Kremlin could find no other pretext for the Soviet invasion.

During the early months of the Pact, Soviet foreign policy became critical of the Allies and more pro-German in turn. During the Fifth Session of the Supreme Soviet on 31 October 1939, Molotov analysed the international situation, thus giving the direction for communist propaganda. According to Molotov, Germany had a legitimate interest in regaining its position as a great power, and the Allies had started an aggressive war in order to maintain the Versailles system.

===Expansion of raw materials and military trading===

Germany and the Soviet Union entered an intricate trade pact on 11 February 1940 that was over four times larger than the one that the two countries had signed in August 1939. The new trade pact helped Germany surmount a British blockade. In the first year, Germany received one million tons of cereals, half-a-million tons of wheat, 900,000 tons of oil, 100,000 tons of cotton, 500,000 tons of phosphates and considerable amounts of other vital raw materials, along with the transit of one million tons of soybeans from Manchuria. Those and other supplies were being transported through Soviet and occupied Polish territories. The Soviets were to receive a naval cruiser, the plans to the battleship &quot;Bismarck&quot;, heavy naval guns, other naval gear and 30 of Germany&#x27;s latest warplanes, including the Bf 109 and Bf 110 fighters and Ju 88 bomber. The Soviets would also receive oil and electric equipment, locomotives, turbines, generators, diesel engines, ships, machine tools, and samples of German artillery, tanks, explosives, chemical-warfare equipment, and other items.

The Soviets also helped Germany to avoid British naval blockades by providing a submarine base, Basis Nord, in the northern Soviet Union near Murmansk. That also provided a refueling and maintenance location and a takeoff point for raids and attacks on shipping. In addition, the Soviets provided Germany with access to the Northern Sea Route for both cargo ships and raiders though only the commerce raider used the route before the German invasion, which forced Britain to protect sea lanes in both the Atlantic and the Pacific.

===Summer deterioration of relations===
The Finnish and Baltic invasions began a deterioration of relations between the Soviets and Germany. Stalin&#x27;s invasions were a severe irritant to Berlin since the intent to accomplish them had not been communicated to the Germans beforehand, and they prompted concern that Stalin was seeking to form an anti-German bloc. Molotov&#x27;s reassurances to the Germans only intensified the Germans&#x27; mistrust. On 16 June, as the Soviets invaded Lithuania but before they had invaded Latvia and Estonia, Ribbentrop instructed his staff &quot;to submit a report as soon as possible as to whether in the Baltic States a tendency to seek support from the Reich can be observed or whether an attempt was made to form a bloc.&quot;

In August 1940, the Soviet Union briefly suspended its deliveries under its commercial agreement after relations were strained after disagreements over policy in Romania, the Soviet war with Finland, Germany&#x27;s falling behind on its deliveries of goods under the pact and Stalin&#x27;s worry that Hitler&#x27;s war with the West might end quickly after France signed an armistice. The suspension created significant resource problems for Germany. By the end of August, relations had improved again, as the countries had redrawn the Hungarian and Romanian borders and settled some Bulgarian claims, and Stalin was again convinced that Germany would face a long war in the west with Britain&#x27;s improvement in its air battle with Germany and the execution of an agreement between the United States and Britain regarding destroyers and bases.

In early September however, Germany arranged its own occupation of Romania, targeting its oil fields. That move raised tensions with the Soviets, who responded that Germany was supposed to have consulted with the Soviet Union under Article III of the pact.

===German–Soviet Axis talks===
After Germany in September 1940 entered the Tripartite Pact with Japan and Italy, Ribbentrop wrote to Stalin, inviting Molotov to Berlin for negotiations aimed to create a &#x27;continental bloc&#x27; of Germany, Italy, Japan, and the Soviet Union that would oppose Britain and the United States. Stalin sent Molotov to Berlin to negotiate the terms for the Soviet Union to join the Axis and potentially to enjoy the spoils of the pact. After negotiations during November 1940 on where to extend the Soviet sphere of influence, Hitler broke off talks and continued planning for the eventual attempts to invade the Soviet Union.

===Late relations===

In an effort to demonstrate peaceful intentions toward Germany, on 13 April 1941, the Soviets signed a neutrality pact with Japan, an Axis power. While Stalin had little faith in Japan&#x27;s commitment to neutrality, he felt that the pact was important for its political symbolism to reinforce a public affection for Germany. Stalin felt that there was a growing split in German circles about whether Germany should initiate a war with the Soviet Union. Stalin did not know that Hitler had been secretly discussing an invasion of the Soviet Union since summer 1940 and that Hitler had ordered his military in late 1940 to prepare for war in the East, regardless of the parties&#x27; talks of a potential Soviet entry as a fourth Axis power.

==Termination==
Germany unilaterally terminated the pact at 03:15 on 22 June 1941 by launching a massive attack on the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa. Stalin had ignored repeated warnings that Germany was likely to invade and ordered no &quot;full-scale&quot; mobilisation of forces although the mobilisation was ongoing. After the launch of the invasion, the territories gained by the Soviet Union as a result of the pact were lost in a matter of weeks. The southeastern part was absorbed into Greater Germany&#x27;s General Government, and the rest was integrated with the Reichskommissariats Ostland and Ukraine. Within six months, the Soviet military had suffered 4.3 million casualties, and three million more had been captured. The lucrative export of Soviet raw materials to Germany over the course of the economic relations continued uninterrupted until the outbreak of hostilities. The Soviet exports in several key areas enabled Germany to maintain its stocks of rubber and grain from the first day of the invasion to October 1941.

==Aftermath==

===Discovery of the secret protocol===
The German original of the secret protocols was presumably destroyed in the bombing of Germany, but in late 1943, Ribbentrop had ordered the most secret records of the German Foreign Office from 1933 onward, amounting to some 9,800 pages, to be microfilmed. When the various departments of the Foreign Office in Berlin were evacuated to Thuringia at the end of the war, Karl von Loesch, a civil servant who had worked for the chief interpreter Paul Otto Schmidt, was entrusted with the microfilm copies. He eventually received orders to destroy the secret documents but decided to bury the metal container with the microfilms as personal insurance for his future well-being. In May 1945, von Loesch approached the British Lieutenant Colonel Robert C. Thomson with the request to transmit a personal letter to Duncan Sandys, Churchill&#x27;s son-in-law. In the letter, von Loesch revealed that he had knowledge of the documents&#x27; whereabouts but expected preferential treatment in return. Thomson and his American counterpart, Ralph Collins, agreed to transfer von Loesch to Marburg, in the American zone if he would produce the microfilms. The microfilms contained a copy of the Non-Aggression Treaty as well as the Secret Protocol. Both documents were discovered as part of the microfilmed records in August 1945 by US State Department employee Wendell B. Blancke, the head of a special unit called &quot;Exploitation German Archives&quot; (EGA).

News of the secret protocols first appeared during the Nuremberg trials. Alfred Seidl, the attorney for defendant Hans Frank, was able to place into evidence an affidavit that described them. It was written from memory by Nazi Foreign Office lawyer , who wrote the text and was present at its signing in Moscow. Later, Seidl obtained the German-language text of the secret protocols from an anonymous Allied source and attempted to place them into evidence while he was questioning witness Ernst von Weizsäcker, a former Foreign Office State Secretary. The Allied prosecutors objected, and the texts were not accepted into evidence, but Weizsäcker was permitted to describe them from memory, thus corroborating the Gaus affidavit. Finally, at the request of a &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; reporter, American deputy prosecutor Thomas J. Dodd acquired a copy of the secret protocols from Seidl and had it translated into English. They were first published on 22 May 1946 in a front-page story in that newspaper. Later, in Britain, they were published by &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;.

The protocols gained wider media attention when they were included in an official State Department collection, &quot;Nazi–Soviet Relations 1939–1941&quot;, edited by Raymond J. Sontag and James S. Beddie and published on 21 January 1948. The decision to publish the key documents on German–Soviet relations, including the treaty and protocol, had been taken already in spring 1947. Sontag and Beddie prepared the collection throughout the summer of 1947. In November 1947, President Harry S. Truman personally approved the publication, but it was held back in view of the Foreign Ministers Conference in London scheduled for December. Since negotiations at that conference did not prove to be constructive from an American point of view, the document edition was sent to press. The documents made headlines worldwide. State Department officials counted it as a success: &quot;The Soviet Government was caught flat-footed in what was the first effective blow from our side in a clear-cut propaganda war.&quot;

Despite publication of the recovered copy in western media, for decades, the official policy of the Soviet Union was to deny the existence of the secret protocol. The secret protocol&#x27;s existence was officially denied until 1989. Vyacheslav Molotov, one of the signatories, went to his grave categorically rejecting its existence. The French Communist Party did not acknowledge the existence of the secret protocol until 1968, as the party de-Stalinized.

On 23 August 1986, tens of thousands of demonstrators in 21 western cities, including New York, London, Stockholm, Toronto, Seattle, and Perth participated in Black Ribbon Day Rallies to draw attention to the secret protocols.

===Stalin&#x27;s &quot;Falsifiers of History&quot; and Axis negotiations===
In response to the publication of the secret protocols and other secret German–Soviet relations documents in the State Department edition &quot;Nazi–Soviet Relations&quot; (1948), Stalin published &quot;Falsifiers of History&quot;, which included the claim that during the pact&#x27;s operation, Stalin rejected Hitler&#x27;s claim to share in a division of the world, without mentioning the Soviet offer to join the Axis. That version persisted, without exception, in historical studies, official accounts, memoirs, and textbooks published in the Soviet Union until the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

The book also claimed that the Munich agreement was a &quot;secret agreement&quot; between Germany and &quot;the west&quot; and a &quot;highly important phase in their policy aimed at goading the Hitlerite aggressors against the Soviet Union.&quot;

===Denial of the secret protocol===
For decades, it was the official policy of the Soviet Union to deny the existence of the secret protocol to the Soviet–German Pact. At the behest of Mikhail Gorbachev, Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev headed a commission investigating the existence of such a protocol. In December 1989, the commission concluded that the protocol had existed and revealed its findings to the Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies of the Soviet Union. As a result, the Congress passed the declaration confirming the existence of the secret protocols and condemning and denouncing them. The Soviet government thus finally acknowledged and denounced the Secret Treaty and Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Head of State condemned the pact. Vladimir Putin condemned the pact as &quot;immoral&quot; but also defended it as a &quot;necessary evil&quot;. At a press conference on 19 December 2019, Putin went further and announced that the signing of the pact was no worse than the 1938 Munich Agreement, which led to the partition of Czechoslovakia.

Both successor states of the pact parties have declared the secret protocols to be invalid from the moment that they were signed: the Federal Republic of Germany on 1 September 1989 and the Soviet Union on 24 December 1989, following an examination of the microfilmed copy of the German originals.

The Soviet copy of the original document was declassified in 1992 and published in a scientific journal in early 1993.

In August 2009, in an article written for the Polish newspaper &quot;Gazeta Wyborcza&quot;, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin condemned the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact as &quot;immoral&quot;.

The new Russian nationalists and revisionists, including Russian negationist Aleksandr Dyukov and Nataliya Narotchnitskaya, whose book carried an approving foreword by the Russian foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, described the pact as a necessary measure because of the British and French failure to enter into an antifascist pact.

===Postwar commentary on motives of Stalin and Hitler===
Some scholars believe that, from the very beginning of the Tripartite negotiations between the Soviet Union, Great Britain and France, the Soviets clearly required the other parties to agree to a Soviet occupation of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and for Finland to be included in the Soviet sphere of influence.

On the timing of German rapprochement, many historians agree that the dismissal of Maxim Litvinov, whose Jewish ethnicity was viewed unfavourably by Nazi Germany, removed an obstacle to negotiations with Germany. Stalin immediately directed Molotov to &quot;purge the ministry of Jews.&quot; Given Litvinov&#x27;s prior attempts to create an anti-fascist coalition, association with the doctrine of collective security with France and Britain and a pro-Western orientation by the standards of the Kremlin, his dismissal indicated the existence of a Soviet option of rapprochement with Germany. Likewise, Molotov&#x27;s appointment served as a signal to Germany that the Soviet Union was open to offers. The dismissal also signaled to France and Britain the existence of a potential negotiation option with Germany. One British official wrote that Litvinov&#x27;s termination also meant the loss of an admirable technician or shock-absorber but that Molotov&#x27;s &quot;modus operandi&quot; was &quot;more truly Bolshevik than diplomatic or cosmopolitan.&quot; Carr argued that the Soviet Union&#x27;s replacement of Litvinov with Molotov on 3 May 1939 indicated not an irrevocable shift towards alignment with Germany but rather was Stalin&#x27;s way of engaging in hard bargaining with the British and the French by appointing a proverbial hard man to the Foreign Commissariat. Historian Albert Resis stated that the Litvinov dismissal gave the Soviets freedom to pursue faster German negotiations but that they did not abandon British–French talks. Derek Watson argued that Molotov could get the best deal with Britain and France because he was not encumbered with the baggage of collective security and could negotiate with Germany. Geoffrey Roberts argued that Litvinov&#x27;s dismissal helped the Soviets with British–French talks because Litvinov doubted or maybe even opposed such discussions.

E. H. Carr stated: &quot;In return for &#x27;non-intervention&#x27; Stalin secured a breathing space of immunity from German attack.&quot; According to Carr, the &quot;bastion&quot; created by means of the pact &quot;was and could only be, a line of defense against potential German attack.&quot; According to Carr, an important advantage was that &quot;if Soviet Russia had eventually to fight Hitler, the Western Powers would already be involved.&quot; However, during the last decades, that view has been disputed. Historian Werner Maser - who served the German army during the second World War - stated that &quot;the claim that the Soviet Union was at the time threatened by Hitler, as Stalin supposed... is a legend, to whose creators Stalin himself belonged. In Maser&#x27;s view, &quot;neither Germany nor Japan were in a situation [of] invading the USSR even with the least perspective of success,&quot; which must not have been known to Stalin. Carr further stated that for a long time, the primary motive of Stalin&#x27;s sudden change of course was assumed to be the fear of German aggressive intentions. On the other hand, Soviet-born Australian historical writer Alex Ryvchin characterized the pact as &quot;a Soviet deal with the devil, which contained a secret protocol providing for the remaining independent states of East-Central Europe to be treated as courses on some debauched degustation menu for two of the greatest monsters in history.&quot;

Many Polish newspapers published numerous articles claiming that Russia must apologise to Poland for the pact.

Two weeks after Soviet armies had entered the Baltic states, Berlin requested Finland to permit the transit of German troops, and five weeks later Hitler issued a secret directive &quot;to take up the Russian problem, to think about war preparations,&quot; a war whose objective would include establishment of a Baltic confederation.

A number of German historians have debunked the claim that Operation Barbarossa was a preemptive strike, such as Andreas Hillgruber, Rolf-Dieter Müller, and Christian Hartmann, but they also acknowledge that the Soviets were aggressive to their neighbors.

According to Stalin&#x27;s daughter, Svetlana Alliluyeva she &quot;remembered her father saying after [the war]: &#x27;Together with the Germans we would have been invincible&#x27;.&quot;

Russian Trotskyist historian, Vadim Rogovin argued that Stalin had destroyed thousands of foreign communists capable of leading socialist change in their respective countries. He referenced the thousands of German communists that were handed over from Stalin to the Gestapo after the signing of the German-Soviet pact. Rogovin also noted that sixteen members of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party became victims of Stalinist terror. Similarly, historian Eric D. Weitz discussed the areas of collaboration between the regimes in which hundreds of German citizens, the majority of whom were Communists, had been handed over to the Gestapo from Stalin&#x27;s administration. Weitz also stated that a higher proportion of the KPD Politburo members had died in the Soviet Union than in Nazi Germany. However, according to the work of Wilhelm Mensing, there is no evidence which suggests that the Soviets specifically targeted German and Austrian Communists or others who perceived themselves as &quot;anti-fascists&quot; for deportations to Nazi Germany.

== Remembrance and response ==
The pact was a taboo subject in the postwar Soviet Union. In December 1989, the Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies of the Soviet Union condemned the pact and its secret protocol as &quot;legally deficient and invalid&quot;. In modern Russia, the pact is often portrayed positively or neutrally by the pro-government propaganda; for example, Russian textbooks tend to describe the pact as a defensive measure, not as one aiming at territorial expansion. In 2009, Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that &quot;there are grounds to condemn the Pact&quot;, but described it in 2014 as &quot;necessary for Russia&#x27;s survival&quot;. Accusations that cast doubt on the positive portrayal of the USSR&#x27;s role in World War II have been seen as highly problematic for the modern Russian state, which sees Russia&#x27;s victory in the war as one of &quot;the most venerated pillars of state ideology&quot;, which legitimises the current government and its policies. In February 2021, the State Duma voted in favor of a law to punish the dissemination of &quot;fake news&quot; regarding the Soviet Union&#x27;s role in World War II, including claiming that Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union held equal responsibility due to the pact.

In 2009, the European Parliament proclaimed 23 August, the anniversary of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, as the European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism, to be commemorated with dignity and impartiality. In connection with the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe parliamentary resolution condemned both communism and fascism for starting World War II and called for a day of remembrance for victims of both Stalinism and Nazism on 23 August. In response to the resolution, Russian lawmakers threatened the OSCE with &quot;harsh consequences&quot;. A similar resolution was passed by the European Parliament a decade later, blaming the 1939 Molotov–Ribbentrop pact for the outbreak of war in Europe and again leading to criticism by Russian authorities.

<text>Mobile ( , ) is a city and the county seat of Mobile County, Alabama, United States. The population was 187,041 at the 2020 census. After a successful vote to annex areas west of the city limits in July 2023, Mobile&#x27;s population increased to 204,689 residents, making it the fourth-most populous city in Alabama, after Montgomery, Birmingham, and Huntsville. Mobile is the principal municipality of the Mobile metropolitan area, a region of 430,197 residents composed of Mobile and Washington counties; it is the third-largest metropolitan area in the state after Birmingham and Huntsville.

Alabama&#x27;s only saltwater port, Mobile is located on the Mobile River at the head of Mobile Bay on the north-central Gulf Coast. The Port of Mobile has always played a key role in the economic health of the city, beginning with the settlement as an important trading center between the French colonists and Native Americans, down to its current role as the 12th-largest port in the United States.

Mobile was founded in 1702 by the French as the first capital of Louisiana. During its first 100 years, Mobile was a colony of France, then Great Britain, and lastly Spain. Mobile became a part of the United States in 1813, with the annexation by President James Madison of West Florida from Spain. During the American Civil War, the city surrendered to Federal forces on April 12, 1865, after Union victories at two forts protecting the city. This, along with the news of Johnston&#x27;s surrender negotiations with Sherman, led General Richard Taylor to seek a meeting with his Union counterpart, Maj. Gen. Edward R. S. Canby. The two generals met several miles north of Mobile on May 2. After agreeing to a 48-hour truce, the generals enjoyed an al fresco luncheon of food, drink, and lively music. Canby offered Taylor the same terms agreed upon between Lee and Grant at Appomattox. Taylor accepted the terms and surrendered his command on May 4 at Citronelle, Alabama.

Considered one of the Gulf Coast&#x27;s cultural centers, Mobile has several art museums, a symphony orchestra, professional opera, professional ballet company, and a large concentration of historic architecture. Mobile is known for having the oldest organized Carnival or Mardi Gras celebrations in the United States. Alabama&#x27;s French Creole population celebrated this festival from the first decade of the 18th century. Beginning in 1830, Mobile was host to the first formally organized Carnival mystic society to celebrate with a parade in the United States. (In New Orleans, such a group is called a &quot;krewe&quot;.)

==Etymology==

The city gained its name from the Mobile tribe that the French colonists encountered living in the area of Mobile Bay. Although it is debated by Alabama historians, they may have been descendants of the Native American tribe whose small fortress town, Mabila, was used to conceal several thousand native warriors before an attack in 1540 on the expedition of Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto. About seven years after the founding of the French Mobile settlement, the Mobile tribe, along with the Tohomé, gained permission from the colonists to settle near the fort.

==History==
===Colonial===

The European settlement of Mobile began with French colonists, who in 1702 constructed &quot;Fort Louis de la Louisiane&quot;, at Twenty-seven Mile Bluff on the Mobile River, as the first capital of the French colony of La Louisiane. It was founded by French Canadian brothers Pierre Le Moyne d&#x27;Iberville and Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville, to establish control over France&#x27;s claims to &quot;La Louisiane&quot;. Bienville was appointed as royal governor of French Louisiana in 1701. Mobile&#x27;s Roman Catholic parish was established on July 20, 1703, by Jean-Baptiste de la Croix de Chevrières de Saint-Vallier, Bishop of Quebec. The parish was the first French Catholic parish established on the Gulf Coast of the United States.

In 1704, the ship &quot;Pélican&quot; delivered 23 Frenchwomen to the colony; passengers had contracted yellow fever at a stop in Havana. Though most of the &quot;&quot;Pélican&quot; girls&quot; recovered, numerous colonists and neighboring Native Americans contracted the disease in turn and many died. This early period was also the occasion of the importation of the first African slaves, transported aboard a French supply ship from the French colony of Saint-Domingue in the Caribbean, where they had first been held. The population of the colony fluctuated over the next few years, growing to 279 persons by 1708, yet shrinking to 178 persons two years later due to disease.

These additional outbreaks of disease and a series of floods resulted in Bienville ordering in 1711 that the settlement be relocated several miles downriver to its present location at the confluence of the Mobile River and Mobile Bay. A new earth-and-palisade Fort Louis was constructed at the new site during this time. By 1712, when Antoine Crozat was appointed to take over administration of the colony, its population had reached 400 persons.

The capital of La Louisiane was moved in 1720 to Biloxi, leaving Mobile to serve as a regional military and trading center. In 1723 the construction of a new brick fort with a stone foundation began and it was renamed Fort Condé in honor of Louis Henri, Duke of Bourbon.

In 1763, the Treaty of Paris was signed, ending the Seven Years&#x27; War, which Britain won, defeating France. By this treaty, France ceded its territories east of the Mississippi River to Britain. This area was made a part of the expanded British West Florida colony. The British changed the name of Fort Condé to Fort Charlotte, after Queen Charlotte.

The British were eager not to lose any useful inhabitants and promised religious tolerance to the French colonists; ultimately 112 French colonists remained in Mobile. The first permanent Jewish settlers came to Mobile in 1763 as a result of the new British rule and religious tolerance. Jews had not been allowed to officially reside in colonial French Louisiana due to the Code Noir, a decree passed by France&#x27;s King Louis XIV in 1685 that forbade the exercise of any religion other than Roman Catholicism, and ordered all Jews out of France&#x27;s colonies. Most of these colonial-era Jews in Mobile were merchants and traders from Sephardic Jewish communities in Savannah, Georgia and Charleston, South Carolina; they added to the commercial development of Mobile. In 1766 the total population was estimated to be 860, though the town&#x27;s borders were smaller than during the French colonial period. During the American Revolutionary War, West Florida and Mobile became a refuge for loyalists fleeing the other colonies.

While the British were dealing with their rebellious colonists along the Atlantic coast, the Spanish entered the war in 1779 as an ally of France. They took the opportunity to order Bernardo de Galvez, Governor of Louisiana, on an expedition east to retake West Florida. He captured Mobile during the Battle of Fort Charlotte in 1780, as part of this campaign. The Spanish wished to eliminate any British threat to their Louisiana colony west of the Mississippi River, which they had received from France in the 1763 Treaty of Paris. Their actions were condoned by the revolting American colonies, partially evidenced by the presence of Oliver Pollack, representative of the American Continental Congress. Due to strong trade ties, many residents of Mobile and West Florida remained loyal to the British Crown. The Spanish renamed the fort as Fortaleza Carlota, and held Mobile as a part of Spanish West Florida until 1813, when it was seized by United States General James Wilkinson during the War of 1812.

===19th century===

By the time Mobile was included in the Mississippi Territory in 1813, the population had dwindled to roughly 300 people. The city was included in the Alabama Territory in 1817, after Mississippi gained statehood. Alabama was granted statehood in 1819; Mobile&#x27;s population had increased to 809 by that time.

Mobile was well situated for trade, as its location tied it to a river system that served as the principal navigational access for most of Alabama and a large part of Mississippi. River transportation was aided by the introduction of steamboats in the early decades of the 19th century. By 1822, the city&#x27;s population had risen to 2,800.

The Industrial Revolution in Great Britain created shortages of cotton, driving up prices on world markets. Much land well suited to growing cotton lies in the vicinity of the Mobile River, and its main tributaries the Tombigbee and Alabama Rivers. A plantation economy using slave labor developed in the region and as a consequence Mobile&#x27;s population quickly grew. It came to be settled by attorneys, cotton factors, doctors, merchants and other professionals seeking to capitalize on trade with the upriver areas.
From the 1830s onward, Mobile expanded into a city of commerce with a primary focus on the cotton and slave trades. Many slaves were transported by ship in the coastwise slave trade from the Upper South. There were many businesses in the city related to the slave trade – people to make clothes, food, and supplies for the slave traders and their wards. The city&#x27;s booming businesses attracted merchants from the North; by 1850 10% of its population was from New York City, which was deeply involved in the cotton industry. Mobile was the slave-trading center of the state until the 1850s, when it was surpassed by Montgomery.

The prosperity stimulated a building boom that was underway by the mid-1830s, with the building of some of the most elaborate structures the city had seen up to that point. This was cut short in part by the Panic of 1837 and yellow fever epidemics. The waterfront was developed with wharves, terminal facilities, and fireproof brick warehouses. The exports of cotton grew in proportion to the amounts being produced in the Black Belt; by 1840 Mobile was second only to New Orleans in cotton exports in the nation.

With the economy so focused on one crop, Mobile&#x27;s fortunes were always tied to those of cotton, and the city weathered many financial crises. Mobile slaveholders owned relatively few slaves compared to planters in the upland plantation areas, but many households had domestic slaves, and many other slaves worked on the waterfront and on riverboats. The last slaves to enter the United States from the African trade were brought to Mobile on the slave ship &quot;Clotilda&quot;. Among them was Cudjoe Lewis, who in the 1920s became the last survivor of the slave trade.
By 1853, fifty Jewish families lived in Mobile, including Philip Phillips, an attorney from Charleston, South Carolina, who was elected to the Alabama State Legislature and then to the United States Congress. Many early Jewish families were descendants of Sephardic Jews who had been among the earliest colonial settlers in Charleston and Savannah.

By 1860 Mobile&#x27;s population within the city limits had reached 29,258 people; it was the 27th-largest city in the United States and 4th-largest in what would soon be the Confederate States of America. The free population in the whole of Mobile County, including the city, consisted of 29,754 citizens, of which 1,195 were free people of color. Additionally, 1,785 slave owners in the county held 11,376 people in bondage, about one-quarter of the total county population of 41,130 people.

During the American Civil War, Mobile was a Confederate city. The &quot;H. L. Hunley&quot;, the first submarine to sink an enemy ship, was built in Mobile. One of the most famous naval engagements of the war was the Battle of Mobile Bay, resulting in the Union taking control of Mobile Bay on August 5, 1864. On April 12, 1865, three days after Robert E. Lee&#x27;s surrender at Appomattox Courthouse, the city surrendered to the Union army to avoid destruction after Union victories at nearby Spanish Fort and Fort Blakeley.
On May 25, 1865, the city suffered great loss when some three hundred people died as a result of an explosion at a federal ammunition depot on Beauregard Street. The explosion left a deep hole at the depot&#x27;s location, and sank ships docked on the Mobile River; the resulting fires destroyed the northern portion of the city.

Federal Reconstruction in Mobile began after the Civil War and effectively ended in 1874 when the local Democrats gained control of the city government. The last quarter of the 19th century was a time of economic depression and municipal insolvency for Mobile. One example can be provided by the value of Mobile&#x27;s exports during this period of depression. The value of exports leaving the city fell from $9 million in 1878 to $3 million in 1882.

===20th century===

The turn of the 20th century brought the Progressive Era to Mobile. The economic structure developed with new industries, generating new jobs and attracting a significant increase in population. The population increased from around 40,000 in 1900 to 60,000 by 1920. During this time the city received $3 million in federal grants for harbor improvements to deepen the shipping channels. During and after World War I, manufacturing became increasingly vital to Mobile&#x27;s economic health, with shipbuilding and steel production being two of the most important industries.

During this time, social justice and race relations in Mobile worsened, however. The state passed a new constitution in 1901 that disenfranchised most blacks and many poor whites; and the white Democratic-dominated legislature passed other discriminatory legislation. In 1902, the city government passed Mobile&#x27;s first racial segregation ordinance, segregating the city streetcars. It legislated what had been informal practice, enforced by convention. Mobile&#x27;s African-American population responded to this with a two-month boycott, but the law was not repealed. After this, Mobile&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; segregation was increasingly replaced with legislated segregation as whites imposed Jim Crow laws to maintain supremacy.

In 1911 the city adopted a commission form of government, which had three members elected by at-large voting. Considered to be progressive, as it would reduce the power of ward bosses, this change resulted in the elite white majority strengthening its power, as only the majority could gain election of at-large candidates. In addition, poor whites and blacks had already been disenfranchised. Mobile was one of the last cities to retain this form of government, which prevented smaller groups from electing candidates of their choice. But Alabama&#x27;s white yeomanry had historically favored single-member districts in order to elect candidates of their choice.
The red imported fire ant was first introduced into the United States via the Port of Mobile. Sometime in the late 1930s they came ashore off cargo ships arriving from South America. The ants were carried in the soil used as ballast on those ships. They have spread throughout the South and Southwest.

During World War II, the defense buildup in Mobile shipyards resulted in a considerable increase in the city&#x27;s white middle-class and working-class population, largely due to the massive influx of workers coming to work in the shipyards and at the Brookley Army Air Field. Between 1940 and 1943, more than 89,000 people moved into Mobile to work for war effort industries.

Mobile was one of eighteen United States cities producing Liberty ships. Its Alabama Drydock and Shipbuilding Company (ADDSCO) supported the war effort by producing ships faster than the Axis powers could sink them. ADDSCO also churned out a copious number of T2 tankers for the War Department. Gulf Shipbuilding Corporation, a subsidiary of Waterman Steamship Corporation, focused on building freighters, s, and minesweepers. The rapid increase of population in the city produced crowded conditions, increasing social tensions in the competition for housing and good jobs.

In May 1943, a race riot broke out between whites and blacks. ADDSCO management had long maintained segregated conditions at the shipyards, although the Roosevelt administration had ordered defense contractors to integrate facilities. That year ADDSCO promoted 12 blacks to positions as welders, previously reserved for whites; and whites objected to the change by rioting on May 24. The mayor appealed to the governor to call in the National Guard to restore order, but it was weeks before officials allowed African Americans to return to work, keeping them away for their safety.

In the late 1940s, the transition to the postwar economy was hard for the city, as thousands of jobs were lost at the shipyards with the decline in the defense industry. Eventually the city&#x27;s social structure began to become more liberal. Replacing shipbuilding as a primary economic force, the paper and chemical industries began to expand. No longer needed for defense, most of the old military bases were converted to civilian uses. Following the war, in which many African Americans had served, veterans and their supporters stepped up activism to gain enforcement of their constitutional rights and social justice, especially in the Jim Crow South. During the 1950s the City of Mobile integrated its police force and Spring Hill College accepted students of all races. Unlike in the rest of the state, by the early 1960s the city buses and lunch counters voluntarily desegregated.

The Alabama legislature passed the Cater Act in 1949, allowing cities and counties to set up industrial development boards (IDB) to issue municipal bonds as incentives to attract new industry into their local areas. The city of Mobile did not establish a Cater Act board until 1962. George E. McNally, Mobile&#x27;s first Republican mayor since Reconstruction, was the driving force behind the founding of the IDB. The Mobile Area Chamber of Commerce, believing its members were better qualified to attract new businesses and industry to the area, considered the new IDB as a serious rival. After several years of political squabbling, the Chamber of Commerce emerged victorious. While McNally&#x27;s IDB prompted the Chamber of Commerce to become more proactive in attracting new industry, the chamber effectively shut Mobile city government out of economic development decisions.

In 1963, three African-American students brought a case against the Mobile County School Board for being denied admission to Murphy High School. This was nearly a decade after the United States Supreme Court had ruled in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; (1954) that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional. The federal district court ordered that the three students be admitted to Murphy for the 1964 school year, leading to the desegregation of Mobile County&#x27;s school system.

The civil rights movement gained congressional passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965, eventually ending legal segregation and regaining effective suffrage for African Americans. But whites in the state had more than one way to reduce African Americans&#x27; voting power. Maintaining the city commission form of government with at-large voting resulted in all positions being elected by the white majority, as African Americans could not command a majority for their candidates in the informally segregated city.
In 1969, the Brookley Air Force Base was closed by the Department of Defense, dealing a severe blow to Mobile&#x27;s economy. The closing resulted in a 10% unemployment rate in the city. This and other factors related to industrial restructuring ushered in a period of economic depression that lasted through the 1970s. The loss of jobs created numerous problems and resulted in loss of population as residents moved away for work.

Mobile&#x27;s city commission form of government was challenged and finally overturned in 1982 in &quot;City of Mobile v. Bolden&quot;, which was remanded by the United States Supreme Court to the district court. Finding that the city had adopted a commission form of government in 1911 and at-large positions with discriminatory intent, the court proposed that the three members of the city commission should be elected from single-member districts, likely ending their division of executive functions among them. Mobile&#x27;s state legislative delegation in 1985 finally enacted a mayor-council form of government, with seven members elected from single-member districts. This was approved by voters. As white conservatives increasingly entered the Republican Party in the late 20th century, African-American residents of the city have elected members of the Democratic Party as their candidates of choice. Since the change to single-member districts, more women and African Americans were elected to the council than under the at-large system.

Beginning in the late 1980s, newly elected mayor Mike Dow and the city council began an effort termed the &quot;String of Pearls Initiative&quot; to make Mobile into a competitive city. The city initiated construction of numerous new facilities and projects, and the restoration of hundreds of historic downtown buildings and homes. City and county leaders also made efforts to attract new business ventures to the area.

The tornado was classified as an EF2 tornado by the National Weather Service on December 26.

The path taken through the city was just a short distance east of the path taken days earlier, on December 20, by an EF1 tornado which had touched down near Davidson High School and taken a path ending in Prichard. Initial damage estimates for insured and uninsured ranged from $140 to $150 million.

==Culture==

Mobile&#x27;s French and Spanish colonial history has given it a culture distinguished by French, Spanish, Creole, African and Catholic heritage, in addition to later British and American influences. It is distinguished from all other cities in the state of Alabama. The annual Carnival celebration is perhaps the best example of its differences. Mobile is the birthplace of the celebration of Mardi Gras in the United States and has the oldest celebration, dating to the early 18th century during the French colonial period.

Carnival in Mobile evolved over the course of 300 years from a beginning as a sedate French Catholic tradition into the mainstream multi-week celebration that today bridges a spectrum of cultures. Mobile&#x27;s official cultural ambassadors are the Azalea Trail Maids, meant to embody the ideals of Southern hospitality.

&quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; (1977) and &quot;Back Roads&quot; (1981) were shot in Mobile.

===Carnival and Mardi Gras===
The Carnival season has expanded throughout the late fall and winter: balls in the city may be scheduled as early as November, with the parades beginning after January 5 and the Twelfth Day of Christmas or Epiphany on January 6. Carnival celebrations end at midnight on Mardi Gras, a moveable feast related to the timing of Lent and Easter. The next day is Ash Wednesday and the beginning of Lent, the 40-day penitential season before Easter.

In Mobile, locals often use the term Mardi Gras as a shorthand to refer to the entire Carnival season. During the Carnival season; the mystic societies build colorful floats and parade throughout downtown. Masked society members toss small gifts, known as &#x27;throws,&#x27; to parade spectators. The mystic societies, which in essence are exclusive private clubs, also hold formal masquerade balls, usually by invitation only, and oriented to adults.

Carnival was first celebrated in Mobile in 1703 when colonial French Catholic settlers carried out their traditional celebration at the Old Mobile Site, prior to the 1711 relocation of the city to the current site. Mobile&#x27;s first Carnival society was established in 1711 with the &quot;Boeuf Gras Society&quot; (Fatted Ox Society). Celebrations were relatively small and consisted of local, private parties until the early 19th century.
In 1830 Mobile&#x27;s Cowbellion de Rakin Society was the first formally organized and masked mystic society in the United States to celebrate with a parade. The Cowbellions got their start when Michael Krafft, a cotton factor from Pennsylvania, began a parade with rakes, hoes, and cowbells. The &quot;Cowbellians&quot; introduced horse-drawn floats to the parades in 1840 with a parade entitled &quot;Heathen Gods and Goddesses&quot;. The Striker&#x27;s Independent Society, formed in 1843, is the oldest surviving mystic society in the United States.

Carnival celebrations in Mobile were canceled during the American Civil War. In 1866 Joe Cain revived the Mardi Gras parades when he paraded through the city streets on Fat Tuesday while costumed as a fictional Chickasaw chief named &quot;Slacabamorinico.&quot; He celebrated the day in front of the occupying Union Army troops. In 2002, Mobile&#x27;s Tricentennial celebrated with parades that represented all of the city&#x27;s mystic societies.

Founded in 2004, the Conde Explorers in 2005 were the first integrated Mardi Gras society to parade in downtown Mobile. The society has about a hundred members and welcomes men and women of all races. In addition to the parade and ball, the Conde Explorers hold several parties throughout the year. Its members also perform volunteer work. The Conde Explorers were featured in the award-winning documentary, &quot;The Order of Myths&quot; (2008), by Margaret Brown about Mobile&#x27;s Mardi Gras.

==Government==

Since 1985 the government of Mobile has consisted of a mayor and a seven-member city council. The mayor is elected at-large, and the council members are elected from each of the seven city council single-member districts (SMDs). A supermajority of five votes is required to conduct council business.

This form of city government was chosen by the voters after the previous form of government, which had three city commissioners, each elected at-large, was ruled in 1975 to substantially dilute the minority vote and violate the Voting Rights Act in &quot;Bolden v. City of Mobile&quot;. The three at-large commissioners each required a majority vote to win. Due to appeals, the case took time to reach settlement and establishment of a new electoral system. Municipal elections are held every four years and are nonpartisan.
The first mayor elected under the new system of single-member district (SMD) voting was Arthur R. Outlaw, who served his second term as mayor from 1985 to 1989. His first term had been under the old system, from 1967 to 1968. Mike Dow defeated Outlaw in the 1989 election; he was re-elected, serving as mayor for four terms, from 1989 to 2005. His &quot;The String of Pearls&quot; initiative, a series of projects designed to stimulate redevelopment of the city&#x27;s core, is credited with reviving much of downtown Mobile. Upon his retirement, Dow endorsed Sam Jones as his successor.

Sam Jones was elected in 2005 as the first African-American mayor of Mobile. He was re-elected for a second term in 2009 without opposition. His administration continued the focus on downtown redevelopment and bringing industries to the city. He ran for a third term in 2013 but was defeated by Sandy Stimpson. Stimpson took office on November 4, 2013, and was re-elected on August 22, 2017.

As of January 2022, the seven-member city council is made up of Cory Penn from District 1, William Carroll from District 2, C.J. Small from District 3, Ben Reynolds from District 4, Joel Daves from District 5, Scott Jones from District 6, and Gina Gregory from District 7.

Mobile serves the central Gulf Coast as a regional center for medicine, with over 850 physicians and 175 dentists. There are four major medical centers within the city limits.

Mobile Infirmary Medical Center has 704 beds and is the largest nonprofit hospital in the state. It was founded in 1910. Providence Hospital has 349 beds. It was founded in 1854 by the Daughters of Charity from Emmitsburg, Maryland. The University of South Alabama Medical Center has 346 beds. Its roots go back to 1830 with the old city-owned Mobile City Hospital and associated medical school. A teaching hospital, it is designated as Mobile&#x27;s only level I trauma center by the Alabama Department of Public Health. It is also a regional burn center. Springhill Medical Center, with 252 beds, was founded in 1975. It is Mobile&#x27;s only for-profit facility.

Additionally, the University of South Alabama operates the University of South Alabama Children&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Hospital with 219 beds, dedicated exclusively to the care of women and minors. In 2008, the University of South Alabama opened the USA Mitchell Cancer Center Institute. The center is home to the first academic cancer research center in the central Gulf Coast region.

Mobile Infirmary Medical Center operated Infirmary West, formerly Knollwood Hospital, with 100 acute-care beds, but closed the facility at the end of October 2012 due to declining revenues.

BayPointe Hospital and Children&#x27;s Residential Services, with 94-beds, is the only psychiatric hospital in the city. It houses a residential unit for children, an acute unit for children and adolescents, and an age-segregated involuntary hospital unit for adults undergoing evaluation ordered by the Mobile Probate Court.

The city has a broad array of outpatient surgical centers, emergency clinics, home health care services, assisted-living facilities and skilled nursing facilities.

==Economy==

Aerospace, steel, ship building, retail, services, construction, medicine, and manufacturing are Mobile&#x27;s major industries. After having economic decline for several decades, Mobile&#x27;s economy began to rebound in the late 1980s. Between 1993 and 2003 roughly 13,983 new jobs were created as 87 new companies were founded and 399 existing companies were expanded.

Defunct companies that had been founded or based in Mobile included Alabama Drydock and Shipbuilding Company, Delchamps, and Gayfers. Current companies that were formerly based in the city include Checkers, Minolta-QMS, Morrison&#x27;s, and the Waterman Steamship Corporation.

In addition to those discussed below, AlwaysHD, Foosackly&#x27;s, Integrity Media, and Volkert, Inc. are headquartered in Mobile.

===Major industry===

====Port of Mobile====
Mobile&#x27;s Alabama State Docks underwent the largest expansion in its history in the early 21st century. It expanded its container processing and storage facility and increased container storage at the docks by over 1,000% at a cost of over $300 million, a project completed in 2005. Despite the expansion of its container capabilities and the addition of two massive new cranes, the port went from 9th largest to the 12th largest by tonnage in the nation from 2008 to 2010.

====Shipyards====
Shipbuilding began to make a major comeback in Mobile in 1999 with the founding of Austal USA. A subsidiary of the Australian company Austal, it expanded its production facility for United States defense and commercial aluminum shipbuilding on Blakeley Island in 2005. Austal announced in October 2012, after winning a new defense contract and completing another building within their complex on the island, that it would expand its workforce from 3,000 to 4,500 employees.

Atlantic Marine operated a major shipyard at the former Alabama Drydock and Shipbuilding Company site on Pinto Island. It was acquired by British defense conglomerate BAE Systems in May 2010 for $352 million. Doing business as BAE Systems Southeast Shipyards, the company continues to operate the site as a full-service shipyard, employing approximately 600 workers with plans to expand.

====Mobile Aeroplex at Brookley====
The Mobile Aeroplex at Brookley is an industrial complex and airport located south of the central business district of the city. It is the largest industrial and transportation complex in the region, having more than 70 companies, many of which are aerospace, spread over . Notable employers at Brookley include Airbus North America Engineering (Airbus Military North America&#x27;s facilities are at the Mobile Regional Airport), VT Mobile Aerospace Engineering (a division of ST Engineering), and Continental Motors.

Plans for an Airbus A320 family aircraft assembly plant in Mobile were formally announced by Airbus CEO Fabrice Brégier from the Mobile Convention Center on July 2, 2012. The plans include a $600 million factory at the Brookley Aeroplex for the assembly of the A319, A320 and A321 aircraft. It was planned to employ up roughly 1,000 full-time workers when fully operational. Construction began with a groundbreaking ceremony on April 8, 2013, with it becoming operable by 2015 and producing up to 50 aircraft per year by 2017. The assembly plant is the company&#x27;s first factory to be built within the United States. It was announced on February 1, 2013, that Airbus had hired Alabama-based Hoar Construction to oversee construction of the facility.
The factory officially opened on September 14, 2015, covering one million square feet on 53 acres of flat grassland.

On October 16, 2017, Airbus announced a partnership with Bombardier Aerospace, taking over a majority share of the Bombardier CSeries airliner program. As a result of this partnership, Airbus plans to open an assembly line for CSeries aircraft in Mobile, particularly to serve the US market. This effort may allow the companies to circumvent high import tariffs on the CSeries family. The aircraft was renamed the Airbus A220 on July 10, 2018. Production started in August 2019; the first A220 from the new line is due to be delivered to Delta in the third quarter of 2020.

====ThyssenKrupp====
German technology conglomerate ThyssenKrupp broke ground on a $4.65 billion combined stainless and carbon steel processing facility in Calvert, a few miles north of Mobile, in 2007. Original projections promised eventual employment for 2,700 people. The facility became operational in July 2010.

The company put both its carbon mill in Calvert and a steel slab-making unit in Rio de Janeiro up for sale in May 2012, citing rising production costs and a worldwide decrease in demand. ThyssenKrupp&#x27;s stainless steel division, Inoxum, including the stainless portion of the Calvert plant, was sold to Finnish stainless steel company Outokumpu Oyi in 2012.

===Top employers===

According to the City&#x27;s 2022 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the largest employers in the city are:

===Unemployment rate===
The United States Department of Labor&#x27;s Bureau of Labor Statistics unemployment rate (not seasonally adjusted).

==Transportation==

===Air===


Local airline passengers are served by the Mobile Regional Airport, with direct connections to four major hub airports. It is served by American Eagle, with service to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport and Charlotte/Douglas International Airport; United Express, with service to George Bush Intercontinental Airport and Delta Connection, with service to Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport. The Mobile Downtown Airport at the Brookley Aeroplex serves corporate, cargo, and private aircraft.

===Cycling paths===
In an effort to leverage Mobile&#x27;s waterways for recreational use, as opposed to simply industrial use, The Three Mile Creek Greenway Trail is being designed and implemented under the instruction of the City Council. The linear park will ultimately span seven miles, from Langan (Municipal) Park to Dr. Martin Luther King Junior Avenue, and include trailheads, sidewalks, and bike lanes. The existing greenway is centered at Tricentennial Park.
Other trails include the paved Mobile Airport Perimeter Trail, encircling the Mobile Downtown Airport and mountain biking trails on the west side of the University of South Alabama.

===Rail===
Mobile is served by four Class I railroads, including the Canadian National Railway (CNR), CSX Transportation (CSX), the Kansas City Southern Railway (KCS), and the Norfolk Southern Railway (NS). The Alabama and Gulf Coast Railway (AGR), a Class III railroad, links Mobile to the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway (BNSF) at Amory, Mississippi. These converge at the Port of Mobile, which provides intermodal freight transport service to companies engaged in importing and exporting. Other railroads include the CG Railway (CGR), a rail ship service to Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, and the Terminal Railway Alabama State Docks (TASD), a switching railroad.

The city was served by Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; passenger train service until 2005, when the service was suspended due to the effects of Hurricane Katrina. However, efforts to restart passenger rail service between Mobile and New Orleans were revived in 2019 by the 21-member Southern Rail Commission after receiving a $33 million Federal Railroad Administration grant in June of that year. Louisiana quickly dedicated its $10 million toward the project, and Mississippi initially balked before committing its $15 million sum but Governor Kay Ivey resisted committing the estimated $2.7 million state allocation from Alabama because of concerns regarding long-term financial commitments and potential competition with freight traffic from the Port of Mobile.

The Winter of 2019 was marked by repeated postponement of votes by the Mobile City Council as it requested more information on how rail traffic from the port would be impacted and where the Amtrak station would be built as community support for the project became more vocal, especially among millennials. A day before a deadline in the federal grant matching program being used to fund the project, the city council committed about $3 million in a 6–1 vote.

About $2.2 million is still needed for infrastructure improvements and the train station must still be built before service begins. Potential locations for the station include at the foot of Government Street in downtown and in the Mobile Aeroplex at Brookley, which is favored by the Port of Mobile.

===Transit===
The Wave Transit System provides fixed-route bus and demand-response service in Mobile. Buses operate Monday through Saturday.

===Roadways===
Two major interstate highways and a spur converge in Mobile. Interstate 10 runs northeast to southwest across the city, while Interstate 65 starts in Mobile at Interstate 10 and runs north. Interstate 165 connects to Interstate 65 north of the city in Prichard and joins Interstate 10 in downtown Mobile. Mobile is well served by many major highway systems. US Highways US 31, US 43, US 45, US 90, and US 98 radiate from Mobile traveling east, west, and north. Mobile has three routes east across the Mobile River and Mobile Bay into neighboring Baldwin County. Interstate 10 leaves downtown through the George Wallace Tunnel under the river and then over the bay across the Jubilee Parkway to Spanish Fort and Daphne. US 98 leaves downtown through the Bankhead Tunnel under the river, onto Blakeley Island, and then over the bay across the Battleship Parkway into Spanish Fort. US 90 travels over the Cochrane–Africatown USA Bridge to the north of downtown onto Blakeley Island, where it becomes co-routed with US 98.

Mobile&#x27;s public transportation is the Wave Transit System which features buses with 18 fixed routes and neighborhood service. Baylinc is a public transportation bus service provided by the Baldwin Rural Transit System in cooperation with the Wave Transit System that provides service between eastern Baldwin County and downtown Mobile. Baylinc operates Monday through Friday.
Greyhound Lines provides intercity bus service between Mobile and many locations throughout the United States. Mobile is served by several taxi and limousine services.

===Water===
The Port of Mobile has public deepwater terminals with direct access to of inland and intracoastal waterways serving the Great Lakes, the Ohio and Tennessee river valleys (via the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway), and the Gulf of Mexico. The Alabama State Port Authority owns and operates the public terminals at the Port of Mobile. The public terminals handle containerized, bulk, breakbulk, roll-on/roll-off, and heavy-lift cargoes. The port is also home to private bulk terminal operators, as well as a number of highly specialized shipbuilding and repair companies with two of the largest floating dry docks on the Gulf Coast.

The city was a home port for cruise ships from Carnival Cruise Lines. The first cruise ship to call the port home was the &quot;Holiday&quot;, which left the city in November 2009 so that a larger and newer ship could take its place. The &quot;Carnival Fantasy&quot; operated from Mobile from then on until the &quot;Carnival Elation&quot; arrived in May 2010. In early 2011, Carnival announced that despite fully booked cruises, the company would cease operations from Mobile in October 2011. This cessation of cruise service left the city with an annual debt service of around two million dollars related to the terminal. In September 2015, Carnival announced that the &quot;Carnival Fantasy&quot; was relocating from Miami, Florida, to Mobile, Alabama, after a five-year absence and would offer four- and five-night cruises to Mexico that started in November 2016 through November 2017. The four-night cruises will visit Cozumel, Mexico while the five night cruises will additionally visit Costa Maya or Progreso. Her first departure from Mobile left on November 9, 2016, on a five-night cruise to Cozumel and Progreso. &quot;Carnival Fascination&quot; will be replacing &quot;Carnival Fantasy&quot; in 2022.

Although Carnival Cruise Lines did not operate from Mobile after the Carnival Fantasy left in 2011, the &quot;Carnival Triumph&quot; was towed into the port following a crippling engine room fire. It was the largest cruise ship ever to dock at the cruise terminal in Mobile. Later it was eclipsed by the &quot;Carnival Conquest&quot;, which docked in Mobile when the Port of New Orleans was temporarily closed. Larger commercial ships routinely arrive at the Port of Mobile.

<text>Monoamine oxidases (MAO) () are a family of enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of monoamines, employing oxygen to clip off their amine group. They are found bound to the outer membrane of mitochondria in most cell types of the body. The first such enzyme was discovered in 1928 by Mary Bernheim in the liver and was named tyramine oxidase. The MAOs belong to the protein family of flavin-containing amine oxidoreductases.

MAOs are important in the breakdown of monoamines ingested in food, and also serve to inactivate monoamine neurotransmitters. Because of the latter, they are involved in a number of psychiatric and neurological diseases, some of which can be treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) which block the action of MAOs.

== Subtypes and tissue distribution ==
In humans there are two types of MAO: MAO-A and MAO-B.
* Both are found in neurons and astroglia.
* Outside the central nervous system:
** MAO-A is also found in the liver, pulmonary vascular endothelium, gastrointestinal tract, and placenta.
** MAO-B is mostly found in blood platelets.

MAO-A appears at roughly 80% of adulthood levels at birth, increasing very slightly after the first 4 years of life, while MAO-B is almost non-detectable in the infant brain. Regional distribution of the monoamine oxidases is characterized by extremely high levels of both MAOs in the hypothalamus and hippocampal uncus, as well as a large amount of MAO-B with very little MAO-A in the striatum and globus pallidus. The cortex has relatively high levels of only MAO-A, with the exception of areas of the cingulate cortex, which contains a balance of both. Autopsied brains demonstrated the predicted increased concentration of MAO-A in regions dense in serotonergic neurotransmission, however MAO-B only correlated with norepinephrine.

Other studies, in which the activities of MAO (not protein amounts) were examined in rat brain, revealed the highest MAO-B activity in the median eminence of hypothalamus. Dorsal raphe nucleus and medial preoptic area have relatively high MAO-B activity, but much lower than MAO-B activity in the median eminence. Among cerebral endocrine glands, pineal gland has high MAO-B activity (its median value is lower than that for median eminence and higher than that for medial preoptic area). Pituitary has the lowest level of MAO-B activity when compared with brain areas studied.

== Function ==
Monoamine oxidases catalyze the oxidative deamination of monoamines. In the first part of the reaction, cofactor FAD oxidizes the substrate yielding the corresponding imine which converts the cofactor into its reduced form FADH2. The imine is then non-enzymatically hydrolyzed to the corresponding ketone (or aldehyde) and ammonia. Oxygen is used to restore the reduced FADH2 cofactor back to the active FAD form. Monoamine oxidases contain the covalently bound cofactor FAD and are, thus, classified as flavoproteins. Monoamine oxidase A and B share roughly 70% of their structure and both have substrate binding sites that are predominantly hydrophobic. Two tyrosine residues (398, 435 within MAO-B, 407 and 444 within MAO-A) in the binding pocket that are commonly involved in inhibitor activity have been hypothesized to be relevant to orienting substrates, and mutations of these residues are relevant to mental health. Four main models have been proposed for the mechanism of electron transfer (single electron transfer, hydrogen atom transfer, nucleophilic model, and hydride transfer) although there is insufficient evidence to support any of them.

In 2021, it was discovered that MAO-B does not mediate dopamine catabolism in the rodent striatum but instead participates in striatal γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) synthesis from putrescine and that synthesized GABA in turn inhibits dopaminergic neurons in this brain area. It has been found that MAO-B, via the putrescine pathway, importantly mediates GABA synthesis in astrocytes in various brain areas, including in the hippocampus, cerebellum, striatum, cerebral cortex, and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). These findings may warrant a rethinking of the actions of MAO-B inhibitors in the treatment of Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

== Substrates and specificities ==
Monoamine oxidases are well known enzymes in pharmacology, since they are the target for the action of a number of monoamine oxidase inhibitor drugs. MAO-A is particularly important in the catabolism of monoamines ingested in food. Both MAOs are also vital to the inactivation of monoamine neurotransmitters, for which they display different specificities.
* Serotonin, norepinephrine, and epinephrine are mainly broken down by MAO-A.
* Phenethylamine and benzylamine are mainly broken down by MAO-B.
* Both forms metabolize dopamine, tyramine, and tryptamine; however, some evidence suggests MAO-B may not be responsible for a significant amount of dopamine degradation.

Specific reactions catalyzed by MAO include:
* Serotonin to 5-hydroxyindoleacetaldehyde (5-HIAL; 5-HIAAL; serotonin aldehyde)
* 5-Methoxytryptamine (melatonin metabolite) to 5-methoxyindoleacetaldehyde (5-MIAL; 5-MIAAL)
* Tryptamine to indoleacetaldehyde (IAAL; tryptamine aldehyde)
* Dopamine to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL; dopamine aldehyde)
* Norepinephrine to 3,4-dihydroxymandelaldehyde (DHMAL; norepinephrine/epinephrine aldehyde)
* Epinephrine to 3,4-dihydroxymandelaldehyde (DHMAL; norepinephrine/epinephrine aldehyde)
* Normetanephrine to 3-methoxy-4-hydroxymandelaldehyde (MHMAL; normetanephrine/metanephrine aldehyde)
* Metanephrine to 3-methoxy-4-hydroxymandelaldehyde (MHMAL; normetanephrine/metanephrine aldehyde)
* 3-Methoxytyramine to 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (HMPAL)
* Phenethylamine to phenylacetaldehyde (PAAL)
* Tyramine to 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (HPAL)
* Benzylamine to benzaldehyde

Other endogenous substrates of MAO include telemethylhistamine, a metabolite of histamine, and &quot;N&quot;-acetylputrescine, a metabolite of putrescine and a precursor and metabolic intermediate in a minor metabolic pathway resulting in the synthesis of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA).

Besides endogenous compounds, a variety of exogenous compounds and drugs are substrates of the MAOs. Examples include substituted phenethylamine sympathomimetics and sympatholytics like phenylephrine, propranolol, and pronethalol, substituted tryptamine serotonergic agents like dimethyltryptamine (DMT), 5-MeO-DMT, bufotenin, almotriptan, rizatriptan, and sumatriptan, and other compounds like bicifadine, citalopram, CP-409092, KW-2449, milacemide, MPTP, nomifensine, primaquine, rivaroxaban, sertraline, and ticlopidine, among others. Haloperidol is another possible substrate of MAO, which may contribute to formation of its neurotoxic metabolite HPP+.

== Clinical significance ==
Because of the vital role that MAOs play in the inactivation of neurotransmitters, MAO dysfunction (too much or too little MAO activity) is thought to contribute to a number of psychiatric and neurological disorders. Unusually high or low levels of MAOs in the body have been associated with schizophrenia, depression, attention deficit disorder, substance abuse, migraines, and irregular sexual maturation. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors are one of the major classes of drug prescribed for the treatment of depression, although they are often last-line treatment due to risk of the drug&#x27;s interaction with diet or other drugs. Excessive levels of catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine) may lead to a hypertensive crisis, and excessive levels of serotonin may lead to serotonin syndrome.

In fact, MAO-A inhibitors act as antidepressant and anti-anxiety agents, whereas MAO-B inhibitors are used alone or in combination to treat Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Some research suggests that certain phenotypes of depression, such as those with anxiety, and &quot;atypical&quot; symptoms involving psychomotor retardation, weight gain and interpersonal sensitivity respond better to MAO inhibitors than other classes of anti-depressant. However the findings related to this have not been consistent. MAOIs may be effective in treatment resistant depression, especially when it does not respond to tricyclic antidepressants.

===Parasite interactions===
Sleeping sickness - caused by trypanosomes - gets its name from the sleep disruption it causes in mammals. That sleep disruption is caused, at least in part, by trypanosomes&#x27; tendency to disrupt MAO activity in the orexin system.

===Animal models===
There are significant differences in MAO activity in different species. Dopamine is primarily deaminated by MAO-A in rats, but by MAO-B in vervet monkeys and humans.

Mice unable to produce either MAO-A or MAO-B display autistic-like traits. These knockout mice display an increased response to stress.

====Arthropods====
=====Insects=====
Insect brains express MAOs, and some insecticides work by inhibiting them. An MAOI effect is especially important for chlordimeform (although one result shows little or no effect in &quot;Periplaneta americana&quot;); and dieldrin may or may not be an MAOI in &quot;Locusta migratoria&quot;.

=====Acari=====
MAO activity has been detected in &quot;Rhipicephalus microplus&quot; and chlordimeform is an MAOI in &quot;R. m.&quot;.

== Genetics ==
The genes encoding MAO-A and MAO-B are located side-by-side on the short arm of the X chromosome, and have about 70% sequence similarity. Rare mutations in the gene are associated with Brunner syndrome.

A study based on the Dunedin cohort concluded that maltreated children with a low-activity polymorphism in the promoter region of the MAO-A gene were more likely to develop antisocial conduct disorders than maltreated children with the high-activity variant. Out of the 442 total males in the study (maltreated or not), 37% had the low activity variant. Of the 13 maltreated males with low MAO-A activity, 11 had been assessed as exhibiting adolescent conduct disorder and 4 were convicted for violent offenses. The suggested mechanism for this effect is the decreased ability of those with low MAO-A activity to quickly degrade norepinephrine, the synaptic neurotransmitter involved in sympathetic arousal and rage. This is argued to provide direct support for the idea that genetic susceptibility to disease is not determined at birth, but varies with exposure to environmental influences. However, most individuals with conduct disorder or convictions did not have low activity of MAO-A; maltreatment was found to have caused stronger predisposition for antisocial behavior than differences in MAO-A activity.

The claim that an interaction between low MAO-A activity and maltreatment would cause anti-social behavior has been criticized since the predisposition towards anti-social behavior could equally well have been caused by &quot;other&quot; genes inherited from abusive parents.

A possible link between predisposition to novelty seeking and a genotype of the MAO-A gene has been found.

A particular variant (or genotype), dubbed &quot;warrior gene&quot; in the popular press, was over-represented in Māori. This supported earlier studies finding different proportions of variants in different ethnic groups. This is the case for many genetic variants, with 33% White/Non-Hispanic, 61% Asian/Pacific Islanders having the low-activity MAO-A promoter variant.

== Aging ==
Unlike many other enzymes, MAO-B activity is increased during aging in the brain of humans and other mammals. Increased MAO-B activity was also found in the pineal gland of aging rats. This may contribute to lowered levels of monoamines in aged brain and pineal gland.
