<text>A mushroom or toadstool is the fleshy, spore-bearing fruiting body of a fungus, typically produced above ground, on soil, or on its food source. &quot;Toadstool&quot; generally denotes one poisonous to humans.

The standard for the name &quot;mushroom&quot; is the cultivated white button mushroom, &quot;Agaricus bisporus&quot;; hence, the word &quot;mushroom&quot; is most often applied to those fungi (Basidiomycota, Agaricomycetes) that have a stem (stipe), a cap (pileus), and gills (lamellae, sing. lamella) on the underside of the cap. &quot;Mushroom&quot; also describes a variety of other gilled fungi, with or without stems; therefore the term is used to describe the fleshy fruiting bodies of some Ascomycota. The gills produce microscopic spores which help the fungus spread across the ground or its occupant surface.

Forms deviating from the standard morphology usually have more specific names, such as &quot;bolete&quot;, &quot;puffball&quot;, &quot;stinkhorn&quot;, and &quot;morel&quot;, and gilled mushrooms themselves are often called &quot;agarics&quot; in reference to their similarity to &quot;Agaricus&quot; or their order Agaricales. By extension, the term &quot;mushroom&quot; can also refer to either the entire fungus when in culture, the thallus (called mycelium) of species forming the fruiting bodies called mushrooms, or the species itself.

==Etymology==

The terms &quot;mushroom&quot; and &quot;toadstool&quot; go back centuries and were never precisely defined, nor was there consensus on application. During the 15th and 16th centuries, the terms &quot;mushrom, mushrum, muscheron, mousheroms, mussheron, or musserouns&quot; were used.

The term &quot;mushroom&quot; and its variations may have been derived from the French word &quot;mousseron&quot; in reference to moss (&quot;mousse&quot;). Delineation between edible and poisonous fungi is not clear-cut, so a &quot;mushroom&quot; may be edible, poisonous, or unpalatable. The word &quot;toadstool&quot; appeared first in 14th century England as a reference for a &quot;stool&quot; for toads, possibly implying an inedible poisonous fungus.

==Identification==
Identifying what is and is not a mushroom requires a basic understanding of their macroscopic structure. Most are basidiomycetes and gilled. Their spores, called basidiospores, are produced on the gills and fall in a fine rain of powder from under the caps as a result. At the microscopic level, the basidiospores are shot off basidia and then fall between the gills in the dead air space. As a result, for most mushrooms, if the cap is cut off and placed gill-side-down overnight, a powdery impression reflecting the shape of the gills (or pores, or spines, etc.) is formed (when the fruit body is sporulating). The color of the powdery print, called a spore print, is useful in both classifying and identifying mushrooms. Spore print colors include white (most common), brown, black, purple-brown, pink, yellow, and creamy, but almost never blue, green, or red.
While modern identification of mushrooms is quickly becoming molecular, the standard methods for identification are still used by most and have developed into a fine art harking back to medieval times and the Victorian era, combined with microscopic examination. The presence of juices upon breaking, bruising-reactions, odors, tastes, shades of color, habitat, habit, and season are all considered by both amateur and professional mycologists. Tasting and smelling mushrooms carries its own hazards because of poisons and allergens. Chemical tests are also used for some genera.

In general, identification to genus can often be accomplished in the field using a local field guide. Identification to species, however, requires more effort. A mushroom develops from a button stage into a mature structure, and only the latter can provide certain characteristics needed for the identification of the species. However, over-mature specimens lose features and cease producing spores. Many novices have mistaken humid water marks on paper for white spore prints, or discolored paper from oozing liquids on lamella edges for colored spored prints.

==Classification==
Typical mushrooms are the fruit bodies of members of the order Agaricales, whose type genus is &quot;Agaricus&quot; and type species is the field mushroom, &quot;Agaricus campestris&quot;. However in modern molecularly defined classifications, not all members of the order Agaricales produce mushroom fruit bodies, and many other gilled fungi, collectively called mushrooms, occur in other orders of the class Agaricomycetes. For example, chanterelles are in the Cantharellales, false chanterelles such as &quot;Gomphus&quot; are in the Gomphales, milk-cap mushrooms (&quot;Lactarius&quot;, &quot;Lactifluus&quot;) and russulas (&quot;Russula&quot;), as well as &quot;Lentinellus&quot;, are in the Russulales, while the tough, leathery genera &quot;Lentinus&quot; and &quot;Panus&quot; are among the Polyporales, but &quot;Neolentinus&quot; is in the Gloeophyllales, and the little pin-mushroom genus, &quot;Rickenella&quot;, along with similar genera, are in the Hymenochaetales.

Within the main body of mushrooms, in the Agaricales, are common fungi like the common fairy-ring mushroom, shiitake, enoki, oyster mushrooms, fly agarics and other Amanitas, magic mushrooms like species of &quot;Psilocybe&quot;, paddy straw mushrooms, shaggy manes, etc.

An atypical mushroom is the lobster mushroom, which is a fruitbody of a &quot;Russula&quot; or &quot;Lactarius&quot; mushroom that has been deformed by the parasitic fungus &quot;Hypomyces lactifluorum&quot;. This gives the affected mushroom an unusual shape and red color that resembles that of a boiled lobster.

Other mushrooms are not gilled, so the term &quot;mushroom&quot; is loosely used, and giving a full account of their classifications is difficult. Some have pores underneath (and are usually called boletes), others have spines, such as the hedgehog mushroom and other tooth fungi, and so on. &quot;Mushroom&quot; has been used for polypores, puffballs, jelly fungi, coral fungi, bracket fungi, stinkhorns, and cup fungi. Thus, the term is more one of common application to macroscopic fungal fruiting bodies than one having precise taxonomic meaning. Approximately 14,000 species of mushrooms are described.

==Morphology==


A mushroom develops from a nodule, or pinhead, less than two millimeters in diameter, called a primordium, which is typically found on or near the surface of the substrate. It is formed within the mycelium, the mass of threadlike hyphae that make up the fungus. The primordium enlarges into a roundish structure of interwoven hyphae roughly resembling an egg, called a &quot;button&quot;. The button has a cottony roll of mycelium, the universal veil, that surrounds the developing fruit body. As the egg expands, the universal veil ruptures and may remain as a cup, or volva, at the base of the stalk, or as warts or volval patches on the cap. Many mushrooms lack a universal veil, therefore they do not have either a volva or volval patches. Often, a second layer of tissue, the partial veil, covers the bladelike gills that bear spores. As the cap expands the veil breaks, and remnants of the partial veil may remain as a ring, or annulus, around the middle of the stalk or as fragments hanging from the margin of the cap. The ring may be skirt-like as in some species of &quot;Amanita&quot;, collar-like as in many species of &quot;Lepiota&quot;, or merely the faint remnants of a cortina (a partial veil composed of filaments resembling a spiderweb), which is typical of the genus &quot;Cortinarius&quot;. Mushrooms lacking partial veils do not form an annulus.

The stalk (also called the stipe, or stem) may be central and support the cap in the middle, or it may be off-center or lateral, as in species of &quot;Pleurotus&quot; and &quot;Panus&quot;. In other mushrooms, a stalk may be absent, as in the polypores that form shelf-like brackets. Puffballs lack a stalk, but may have a supporting base. Other mushrooms including truffles, jellies, earthstars, and bird&#x27;s nests usually do not have stalks, and a specialized mycological vocabulary exists to describe their parts.

The way the gills attach to the top of the stalk is an important feature of mushroom morphology. Mushrooms in the genera &quot;Agaricus&quot;, &quot;Amanita&quot;, &quot;Lepiota&quot; and &quot;Pluteus&quot;, among others, have free gills that do not extend to the top of the stalk. Others have decurrent gills that extend down the stalk, as in the genera &quot;Omphalotus&quot; and &quot;Pleurotus&quot;. There are a great number of variations between the extremes of free and decurrent, collectively called attached gills. Finer distinctions are often made to distinguish the types of attached gills: adnate gills, which adjoin squarely to the stalk; notched gills, which are notched where they join the top of the stalk; adnexed gills, which curve upward to meet the stalk, and so on. These distinctions between attached gills are sometimes difficult to interpret, since gill attachment may change as the mushroom matures, or with different environmental conditions.

===Microscopic features===
A hymenium is a layer of microscopic spore-bearing cells that covers the surface of gills. In the nongilled mushrooms, the hymenium lines the inner surfaces of the tubes of boletes and polypores, or covers the teeth of spine fungi and the branches of corals. In the Ascomycota, spores develop within microscopic elongated, sac-like cells called asci, which typically contain eight spores in each ascus. The Discomycetes, which contain the cup, sponge, brain, and some club-like fungi, develop an exposed layer of asci, as on the inner surfaces of cup fungi or within the pits of morels. The Pyrenomycetes, tiny dark-colored fungi that live on a wide range of substrates including soil, dung, leaf litter, and decaying wood, as well as other fungi, produce minute, flask-shaped structures called perithecia, within which the asci develop.

In the basidiomycetes, usually four spores develop on the tips of thin projections called sterigmata, which extend from club-shaped cells called a basidia. The fertile portion of the Gasteromycetes, called a gleba, may become powdery as in the puffballs or slimy as in the stinkhorns. Interspersed among the asci are threadlike sterile cells called paraphyses. Similar structures called cystidia often occur within the hymenium of the Basidiomycota. Many types of cystidia exist, and assessing their presence, shape, and size is often used to verify the identification of a mushroom.

The most important microscopic feature for identification of mushrooms is the spores. Their color, shape, size, attachment, ornamentation, and reaction to chemical tests often can be the crux of an identification. A spore often has a protrusion at one end, called an apiculus, which is the point of attachment to the basidium, termed the apical germ pore, from which the hypha emerges when the spore germinates.

==Growth==

Many species of mushrooms seemingly appear overnight, growing or expanding rapidly. This phenomenon is the source of several common expressions in the English language including &quot;to mushroom&quot; or &quot;mushrooming&quot; (expanding rapidly in size or scope) and &quot;to pop up like a mushroom&quot; (to appear unexpectedly and quickly). In reality, all species of mushrooms take several days to form primordial mushroom fruit bodies, though they do expand rapidly by the absorption of fluids.

The cultivated mushroom, as well as the common field mushroom, initially form a minute fruiting body, referred to as the pin stage because of their small size. Slightly expanded, they are called buttons, once again because of the relative size and shape. Once such stages are formed, the mushroom can rapidly pull in water from its mycelium and expand, mainly by inflating preformed cells that took several days to form in the primordia.

Similarly, there are other mushrooms, like &quot;Parasola plicatilis&quot; (formerly &quot;Coprinus plicatlis&quot;), that grow rapidly overnight and may disappear by late afternoon on a hot day after rainfall. The primordia form at ground level in lawns in humid spaces under the thatch and after heavy rainfall or in dewy conditions balloon to full size in a few hours, release spores, and then collapse.

Not all mushrooms expand overnight; some grow very slowly and add tissue to their fruiting bodies by growing from the edges of the colony or by inserting hyphae. For example, &quot;Pleurotus nebrodensis&quot; grows slowly, and because of this combined with human collection, it is now critically endangered.

Though mushroom fruiting bodies are short-lived, the underlying mycelium can itself be long-lived and massive. A colony of &quot;Armillaria solidipes&quot; (formerly known as &quot;Armillaria ostoyae&quot;) in Malheur National Forest in the United States is estimated to be 2,400 years old, possibly older, and spans an estimated . Most of the fungus is underground and in decaying wood or dying tree roots in the form of white mycelia combined with black shoelace-like rhizomorphs that bridge colonized separated woody substrates.

==Nutrition==
Raw brown mushrooms are 92% water, 4% carbohydrates, 2% protein and less than 1% fat. In a amount, raw mushrooms provide 22 calories and are a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of B vitamins, such as riboflavin, niacin and pantothenic acid, selenium (37% DV) and copper (25% DV), and a moderate source (10–19% DV) of phosphorus, zinc and potassium (table). They have minimal or no vitamin C and sodium content.

===Vitamin D===
The vitamin D content of a mushroom depends on postharvest handling, in particular the unintended exposure to sunlight. The US Department of Agriculture provided evidence that UV-exposed mushrooms contain substantial amounts of vitamin D. When exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light, even after harvesting, ergosterol in mushrooms is converted to vitamin D2, a process now used intentionally to supply fresh vitamin D mushrooms for the functional food grocery market. In a comprehensive safety assessment of producing vitamin D in fresh mushrooms, researchers showed that artificial UV light technologies were equally effective for vitamin D production as in mushrooms exposed to natural sunlight, and that UV light has a long record of safe use for production of vitamin D in food.

==Human use==
===Edible mushrooms===

Mushrooms are used extensively in cooking, in many cuisines (notably Chinese, Korean, European, and Japanese). Humans have valued them as food since antiquity.

Most mushrooms sold in supermarkets have been commercially grown on mushroom farms. The most common of these, &quot;Agaricus bisporus&quot;, is considered safe for most people to eat because it is grown in controlled, sterilized environments. Several varieties of &quot;A. bisporus&quot; are grown commercially, including whites, crimini, and portobello. Other cultivated species available at many grocers include &quot;Hericium erinaceus&quot;, shiitake, maitake (hen-of-the-woods), &quot;Pleurotus&quot;, and enoki. In recent years, increasing affluence in developing countries has led to a considerable growth in interest in mushroom cultivation, which is now seen as a potentially important economic activity for small farmers.

China is a major edible mushroom producer. The country produces about half of all cultivated mushrooms, and around of mushrooms are consumed per person per year by 1.4 billion people. In 2014, Poland was the world&#x27;s largest mushroom exporter, reporting an estimated annually.

Separating edible from poisonous species requires meticulous attention to detail; there is no single trait by which all toxic mushrooms can be identified, nor one by which all edible mushrooms can be identified. People who collect mushrooms for consumption are known as mycophagists, and the act of collecting them for such is known as mushroom hunting, or simply &quot;mushrooming&quot;. Even edible mushrooms may produce allergic reactions in susceptible individuals, from a mild asthmatic response to severe anaphylactic shock. Even the cultivated &quot;A. bisporus&quot; contains small amounts of hydrazines, the most abundant of which is agaritine (a mycotoxin and carcinogen). However, the hydrazines are destroyed by moderate heat when cooking.

A number of species of mushrooms are poisonous; although some resemble certain edible species, consuming them could be fatal. Eating mushrooms gathered in the wild is risky and should only be undertaken by individuals knowledgeable in mushroom identification. Common best practice is for wild mushroom pickers to focus on collecting a small number of visually distinctive, edible mushroom species that cannot be easily confused with poisonous varieties. Common mushroom hunting advice is that if a mushroom cannot be positively identified, it should be considered poisonous and not eaten.

===Toxic mushrooms===
Many mushroom species produce secondary metabolites that can be toxic, mind-altering, antibiotic, antiviral, or bioluminescent. Although there are only a small number of deadly species, several others can cause particularly severe and unpleasant symptoms. Toxicity likely plays a role in protecting the function of the basidiocarp: the mycelium has expended considerable energy and protoplasmic material to develop a structure to efficiently distribute its spores. One defense against consumption and premature destruction is the evolution of chemicals that render the mushroom inedible, either causing the consumer to vomit the meal (see emetics), or to learn to avoid consumption altogether. In addition, due to the propensity of mushrooms to absorb heavy metals, including those that are radioactive, as late as 2008, European mushrooms may have included toxicity from the 1986 Chernobyl disaster and continued to be studied.

===Psychoactive mushrooms===
Mushrooms with psychoactive properties have long played a role in various native medicine traditions in cultures all around the world. They have been used as sacrament in rituals aimed at mental and physical healing, and to facilitate visionary states. One such ritual is the &quot;velada&quot; ceremony. A practitioner of traditional mushroom use is the &quot;shaman&quot; or &quot;curandera&quot; (priest-healer).

Psilocybin mushrooms, also referred to as psychedelic mushrooms, possess psychedelic properties. Commonly known as &quot;magic mushrooms&quot; or shrooms&quot;, they are openly available in smart shops in many parts of the world, or on the black market in those countries which have outlawed their sale. Psilocybin mushrooms have been reported to facilitate profound and life-changing insights often described as mystical experiences. Recent scientific work has supported these claims, as well as the long-lasting effects of such induced spiritual experiences.
Psilocybin, a naturally occurring chemical in certain psychedelic mushrooms such as &quot;Psilocybe cubensis&quot;, is being studied for its ability to help people suffering from psychological disorders, such as obsessive–compulsive disorder. Minute amounts have been reported to stop cluster and migraine headaches. A double-blind study, done by Johns Hopkins Hospital, showed psychedelic mushrooms could provide people an experience with substantial personal meaning and spiritual significance. In the study, one third of the subjects reported ingestion of psychedelic mushrooms was the single most spiritually significant event of their lives. Over two-thirds reported it among their five most meaningful and spiritually significant events. On the other hand, one-third of the subjects reported extreme anxiety. However the anxiety went away after a short period of time. Psilocybin mushrooms have also shown to be successful in treating addiction, specifically with alcohol and cigarettes.

A few species in the genus &quot;Amanita&quot;, most recognizably &quot;A. muscaria&quot;, but also &quot;A. pantherina&quot;, among others, contain the psychoactive compound muscimol. The muscimol-containing chemotaxonomic group of &quot;Amanitas&quot; contains no amatoxins or phallotoxins, and as such are not hepatoxic, though if not properly cured will be non-lethally neurotoxic due to the presence of ibotenic acid. The &quot;Amanita&quot; intoxication is similar to Z-drugs in that it includes CNS depressant and sedative-hypnotic effects, but also dissociation and delirium in high doses.

===Folk medicine===

Some mushrooms are used in folk medicine. In a few countries, extracts, such as polysaccharide-K, schizophyllan, polysaccharide peptide, or lentinan, are government-registered adjuvant cancer therapies, but clinical evidence for efficacy and safety of these extracts in humans has not been confirmed. Although some mushroom species or their extracts may be consumed for therapeutic effects, some regulatory agencies, such as the US Food and Drug Administration, regard such use as a dietary supplement, which does not have government approval or common clinical use as a prescription drug.

===Other uses===

Mushrooms can be used for dyeing wool and other natural fibers. The chromophores of mushroom dyes are organic compounds and produce strong and vivid colors, and all colors of the spectrum can be achieved with mushroom dyes. Before the invention of synthetic dyes, mushrooms were the source of many textile dyes.

Some fungi, types of polypores loosely called mushrooms, have been used as fire starters (known as tinder fungi).

Mushrooms and other fungi play a role in the development of new biological remediation techniques (e.g., using mycorrhizae to spur plant growth) and filtration technologies (e.g. using fungi to lower bacterial levels in contaminated water).

There is an ongoing research in the field of genetic engineering aimed towards creation of the enhanced qualities of mushrooms for such domains as nutritional value enhancement, as well as medical use.

<text>A mainframe computer, informally called a mainframe or big iron, is a computer used primarily by large organizations for critical applications like bulk data processing for tasks such as censuses, industry and consumer statistics, enterprise resource planning, and large-scale transaction processing. A mainframe computer is large but not as large as a supercomputer and has more processing power than some other classes of computers, such as minicomputers, servers, workstations, and personal computers. Most large-scale computer-system architectures were established in the 1960s, but they continue to evolve. Mainframe computers are often used as servers.

The term &quot;mainframe&quot; was derived from the large cabinet, called a &quot;main frame&quot;, that housed the central processing unit and main memory of early computers. Later, the term &quot;mainframe&quot; was used to distinguish high-end commercial computers from less powerful machines.

==Design==
Modern mainframe design is characterized less by raw computational speed and more by:
* Redundant internal engineering resulting in high reliability and security
* Extensive input-output (&quot;I/O&quot;) facilities with the ability to offload to separate engines
* Strict backward compatibility with older software
* High hardware and computational utilization rates through virtualization to support massive throughput
* Hot swapping of hardware, such as processors and memory

The high stability and reliability of mainframes enable these machines to run uninterrupted for very long periods of time, with mean time between failures (MTBF) measured in decades.

Mainframes have high availability, one of the primary reasons for their longevity, since they are typically used in applications where downtime would be costly or catastrophic. The term reliability, availability and serviceability (RAS) is a defining characteristic of mainframe computers. Proper planning and implementation are required to realize these features. In addition, mainframes are more secure than other computer types: the NIST vulnerabilities database, US-CERT, rates traditional mainframes such as IBM Z (previously called z Systems, System z, and zSeries), Unisys Dorado, and Unisys Libra as among the most secure, with vulnerabilities in the low single digits, as compared to thousands for Windows, UNIX, and Linux. Software upgrades usually require setting up the operating system or portions thereof, and are non disruptive only when using virtualizing facilities such as IBM z/OS and Parallel Sysplex, or Unisys XPCL, which support workload sharing so that one system can take over another&#x27;s application while it is being refreshed.

In the late 1950s, mainframes had only a rudimentary interactive interface (the console) and used sets of punched cards, paper tape, or magnetic tape to transfer data and programs. They operated in batch mode to support back office functions such as payroll and customer billing, most of which were based on repeated tape-based sorting and merging operations followed by line printing to preprinted continuous stationery. When interactive user terminals were introduced, they were used almost exclusively for applications (e.g. airline booking) rather than program development. However, in 1961 the first academic, general-purpose timesharing system that supported software development, CTSS, was released at MIT on an IBM 709, later 7090 and 7094. Typewriter and Teletype devices were common control consoles for system operators through the early 1970s, although ultimately supplanted by keyboard/display devices.

By the early 1970s, many mainframes acquired interactive user terminals operating as timesharing computers, supporting hundreds of users simultaneously along with batch processing. Users gained access through keyboard/typewriter terminals and later character-mode text terminal CRT displays with integral keyboards, or finally from personal computers equipped with terminal emulation software. By the 1980s, many mainframes supported general purpose graphic display terminals, and terminal emulation, but not graphical user interfaces. This form of end-user computing became obsolete in the 1990s due to the advent of personal computers provided with GUIs. After 2000, modern mainframes partially or entirely phased out classic &quot;green screen&quot; and color display terminal access for end-users in favour of Web-style user interfaces.

The infrastructure requirements were drastically reduced during the mid-1990s, when CMOS mainframe designs replaced the older bipolar technology. IBM claimed that its newer mainframes reduced data center energy costs for power and cooling, and reduced physical space requirements compared to server farms.

==Characteristics==
Modern mainframes can run multiple different instances of operating systems at the same time. This technique of virtual machines allows applications to run as if they were on physically distinct computers. In this role, a single mainframe can replace higher-functioning hardware services available to conventional servers. While mainframes pioneered this capability, virtualization is now available on most families of computer systems, though not always to the same degree or level of sophistication.

Mainframes can add or hot swap system capacity without disrupting system function, with specificity and granularity to a level of sophistication not usually available with most server solutions. Modern mainframes, notably the IBM Z servers, offer two levels of virtualization: logical partitions (LPARs, via the PR/SM facility) and virtual machines (via the z/VM operating system). Many mainframe customers run two machines: one in their primary data center and one in their backup data center—fully active, partially active, or on standby—in case there is a catastrophe affecting the first building. Test, development, training, and production workload for applications and databases can run on a single machine, except for extremely large demands where the capacity of one machine might be limiting. Such a two-mainframe installation can support continuous business service, avoiding both planned and unplanned outages. In practice, many customers use multiple mainframes linked either by Parallel Sysplex and shared DASD (in IBM&#x27;s case), or with shared, geographically dispersed storage provided by EMC or Hitachi.

Mainframes are designed to handle very high volume input and output (I/O) and emphasize throughput computing. Since the late 1950s, mainframe designs have included subsidiary hardware (called &quot;channels&quot; or &quot;peripheral processors&quot;) which manage the I/O devices, leaving the CPU free to deal only with high-speed memory. It is common in mainframe shops to deal with massive databases and files. Gigabyte to terabyte-size record files are not unusual. Compared to a typical PC, mainframes commonly have hundreds to thousands of times as much data storage online, and can access it reasonably quickly. Other server families also offload I/O processing and emphasize throughput computing.

Mainframe return on investment (ROI), like any other computing platform, is dependent on its ability to scale, support mixed workloads, reduce labor costs, deliver uninterrupted service for critical business applications, and several other risk-adjusted cost factors.

Mainframes also have execution integrity characteristics for fault tolerant computing. For example, z900, z990, System z9, and System z10 servers effectively execute result-oriented instructions twice, compare results, arbitrate between any differences (through instruction retry and failure isolation), then shift workloads &quot;in flight&quot; to functioning processors, including spares, without any impact to operating systems, applications, or users. This hardware-level feature, also found in HP&#x27;s NonStop systems, is known as lock-stepping, because both processors take their &quot;steps&quot; (i.e. instructions) together. Not all applications absolutely need the assured integrity that these systems provide, but many do, such as financial transaction processing.

==Current market==
IBM, with the IBM Z series, continues to be a major manufacturer in the mainframe market. In 2000, Hitachi co-developed the zSeries z900 with IBM to share expenses, and the latest Hitachi AP10000 models are made by IBM. Unisys manufactures ClearPath Libra mainframes, based on earlier Burroughs MCP products and ClearPath Dorado mainframes based on Sperry Univac OS 1100 product lines. Hewlett Packard Enterprise sells its unique NonStop systems, which it acquired with Tandem Computers and which some analysts classify as mainframes. Groupe Bull&#x27;s GCOS, Stratus OpenVOS, Fujitsu (formerly Siemens) BS2000, and Fujitsu-ICL VME mainframes are still available in Europe, and Fujitsu (formerly Amdahl) GS21 mainframes globally. NEC with ACOS and Hitachi with AP10000-VOS3 still maintain mainframe businesses in the Japanese market.

The amount of vendor investment in mainframe development varies with market share. Fujitsu and Hitachi both continue to use custom S/390-compatible processors, as well as other CPUs (including POWER and Xeon) for lower-end systems. Bull uses a mixture of Itanium and Xeon processors. NEC uses Xeon processors for its low-end ACOS-2 line, but develops the custom NOAH-6 processor for its high-end ACOS-4 series. IBM also develops custom processors in-house, such as the Telum. Unisys produces code compatible mainframe systems that range from laptops to cabinet-sized mainframes that use homegrown CPUs as well as Xeon processors. Furthermore, there exists a market for software applications to manage the performance of mainframe implementations. In addition to IBM, significant market competitors include BMC and Precisely; former competitors include Compuware and CA Technologies. Starting in the 2010s, cloud computing is now a less expensive, more scalable alternative.

==History==

Several manufacturers and their successors produced mainframe computers from the 1950s until the early 21st century, with gradually decreasing numbers and a gradual transition to simulation on Intel chips rather than proprietary hardware. The US group of manufacturers was first known as &quot;IBM and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;: usually Burroughs, UNIVAC, NCR, Control Data, Honeywell, General Electric and RCA, although some lists varied. Later, with the departure of General Electric and RCA, it was referred to as IBM and the BUNCH. IBM&#x27;s dominance grew out of their 700/7000 series and, later, the development of the 360 series mainframes. The latter architecture has continued to evolve into their current zSeries mainframes which, along with the then Burroughs and Sperry (now Unisys) MCP-based and OS1100 mainframes, are among the few mainframe architectures still extant that can trace their roots to this early period. While IBM&#x27;s zSeries can still run 24-bit System/360 code, the 64-bit IBM Z CMOS servers have nothing physically in common with the older systems. Notable manufacturers outside the US were Siemens and Telefunken in Germany, ICL in the United Kingdom, Olivetti in Italy, and Fujitsu, Hitachi, Oki, and NEC in Japan. The Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact countries manufactured close copies of IBM mainframes during the Cold War; the BESM series and Strela are examples of independently designed Soviet computers. Elwro in Poland was another Eastern Bloc manufacturer, producing the ODRA, R-32 and R-34 mainframes.

Shrinking demand and tough competition started a shakeout in the market in the early 1970s—RCA sold out to UNIVAC and GE sold its business to Honeywell; between 1986 and 1990 Honeywell was bought out by Bull; UNIVAC became a division of Sperry, which later merged with Burroughs to form Unisys Corporation in 1986.

In 1984 estimated sales of desktop computers ($11.6 billion) exceeded mainframe computers ($11.4 billion) for the first time. IBM received the vast majority of mainframe revenue. During the 1980s, minicomputer-based systems grew more sophisticated and were able to displace the lower end of the mainframes. These computers, sometimes called &quot;departmental computers&quot;, were typified by the Digital Equipment Corporation VAX series.

In 1991, AT&amp;T Corporation briefly owned NCR. During the same period, companies found that servers based on microcomputer designs could be deployed at a fraction of the acquisition price and offer local users much greater control over their own systems given the IT policies and practices at that time. Terminals used for interacting with mainframe systems were gradually replaced by personal computers. Consequently, demand plummeted and new mainframe installations were restricted mainly to financial services and government. In the early 1990s, there was a rough consensus among industry analysts that the mainframe was a dying market as mainframe platforms were increasingly replaced by personal computer networks. &quot;InfoWorld&quot;″s Stewart Alsop infamously predicted that the last mainframe would be unplugged in 1996; in 1993, he cited Cheryl Currid, a computer industry analyst as saying that the last mainframe &quot;will stop working on December 31, 1999&quot;, a reference to the anticipated Year 2000 problem (Y2K).

That trend started to turn around in the late 1990s as corporations found new uses for their existing mainframes and as the price of data networking collapsed in most parts of the world, encouraging trends toward more centralized computing. The growth of e-business also dramatically increased the number of back-end transactions processed by mainframe software as well as the size and throughput of databases. Batch processing, such as billing, became even more important (and larger) with the growth of e-business, and mainframes are particularly adept at large-scale batch computing. Another factor currently increasing mainframe use is the development of the Linux operating system, which arrived on IBM mainframe systems in 1999. Linux allows users to take advantage of open source software combined with mainframe hardware RAS. Rapid expansion and development in emerging markets, particularly People&#x27;s Republic of China, is also spurring major mainframe investments to solve exceptionally difficult computing problems, e.g. providing unified, extremely high volume online transaction processing databases for 1 billion consumers across multiple industries (banking, insurance, credit reporting, government services, etc.) In late 2000, IBM introduced 64-bit z/Architecture, acquired numerous software companies such as Cognos and introduced those software products to the mainframe. IBM&#x27;s quarterly and annual reports in the 2000s usually reported increasing mainframe revenues and capacity shipments. However, IBM&#x27;s mainframe hardware business has not been immune to the recent overall downturn in the server hardware market or to model cycle effects. For example, in the 4th quarter of 2009, IBM&#x27;s System z hardware revenues decreased by 27% year over year. But MIPS (millions of instructions per second) shipments increased 4% per year over the past two years. Alsop had himself photographed in 2000, symbolically eating his own words (&quot;death to the mainframe&quot;).

In 2012, NASA powered down its last mainframe, an IBM System z9. However, IBM&#x27;s successor to the z9, the z10, led a New York Times reporter to state four years earlier that &quot;mainframe technology—hardware, software and services—remains a large and lucrative business for I.B.M., and mainframes are still the back-office engines behind the world&#x27;s financial markets and much of global commerce&quot;. , while mainframe technology represented less than 3% of IBM&#x27;s revenues, it &quot;continue[d] to play an outsized role in Big Blue&#x27;s results&quot;.

IBM has continued to launch new generations of mainframes: the IBM z13 in 2015, the z14 in 2017, the z15 in 2019, and the z16 in 2022, the latter featuring among other things an &quot;integrated on-chip AI accelerator&quot; and the new Telum microprocessor.

==Differences from supercomputers==
A supercomputer is a computer at the leading edge of data processing capability, with respect to calculation speed. Supercomputers are used for scientific and engineering problems (high-performance computing) which crunch numbers and data, while mainframes focus on transaction processing. The differences are:
* Mainframes are built to be reliable for transaction processing (measured by TPC-metrics; not used or helpful for most supercomputing applications) as it is commonly understood in the business world: the commercial exchange of goods, services, or money. A typical transaction, as defined by the Transaction Processing Performance Council, updates a database system for inventory control (goods), airline reservations (services), or banking (money) by adding a record. A transaction may refer to a set of operations including disk read/writes, operating system calls, or some form of data transfer from one subsystem to another which is not measured by the processing speed of the CPU. Transaction processing is not exclusive to mainframes but is also used by microprocessor-based servers and online networks.
* Supercomputer performance is measured in floating point operations per second (FLOPS) or in traversed edges per second or TEPS, metrics that are not very meaningful for mainframe applications, while mainframes are sometimes measured in millions of instructions per second (MIPS), although the definition depends on the instruction mix measured. Examples of integer operations measured by MIPS include adding numbers together, checking values or moving data around in memory (while moving information to and from storage, so-called I/O is most helpful for mainframes; and within memory, only helping indirectly). Floating point operations are mostly addition, subtraction, and multiplication (of &quot;binary&quot; floating point in supercomputers; measured by FLOPS) with enough digits of precision to model continuous phenomena such as weather prediction and nuclear simulations (only recently standardized &quot;decimal&quot; floating point, not used in supercomputers, are appropriate for monetary values such as those useful for mainframe applications). In terms of computational speed, supercomputers are more powerful.

Mainframes and supercomputers cannot always be clearly distinguished; up until the early 1990s, many supercomputers were based on a mainframe architecture with supercomputing extensions. An example of such a system is the HITAC S-3800, which was instruction-set compatible with IBM System/370 mainframes, and could run the Hitachi VOS3 operating system (a fork of IBM MVS). The S-3800 therefore can be seen as being both simultaneously a supercomputer and also an IBM-compatible mainframe.

In 2007, an amalgamation of the different technologies and architectures for supercomputers and mainframes has led to a so-called gameframe.

<text>Microsoft Excel is a spreadsheet editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, macOS, Android, iOS and iPadOS. It features calculation or computation capabilities, graphing tools, pivot tables, and a macro programming language called Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). Excel forms part of the Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Office suites of software and has been developed since 1985.

== Features ==

=== Basic operation ===

Microsoft Excel has the basic features of all spreadsheets, using a grid of &quot;cells&quot; arranged in numbered &quot;rows&quot; and letter-named &quot;columns&quot; to organize data manipulations like arithmetic operations. It has a battery of supplied functions to answer statistical, engineering, and financial needs. In addition, it can display data as line graphs, histograms and charts, and with a very limited three-dimensional graphical display. It allows sectioning of data to view its dependencies on various factors for different perspectives (using &quot;pivot tables&quot; and the &quot;scenario manager&quot;). A PivotTable is a tool for data analysis. It does this by simplifying large data sets via PivotTable fields. It has a programming aspect, &quot;Visual Basic for Applications&quot;, allowing the user to employ a wide variety of numerical methods, for example, for solving differential equations of mathematical physics, and then reporting the results back to the spreadsheet. It also has a variety of interactive features allowing user interfaces that can completely hide the spreadsheet from the user, so the spreadsheet presents itself as a so-called &quot;application&quot;, or &quot;decision support system&quot; (DSS), via a custom-designed user interface, for example, a stock analyzer, or in general, as a design tool that asks the user questions and provides answers and reports. In a more elaborate realization, an Excel application can automatically poll external databases and measuring instruments using an update schedule, analyze the results, make a Word report or PowerPoint slide show, and e-mail these presentations on a regular basis to a list of participants.

Microsoft allows for a number of optional command-line switches to control the manner in which Excel starts.

=== Functions ===

Excel 2016 has 484 functions. Of these, 360 existed prior to Excel 2010. Microsoft classifies these functions into 14 categories. Of the 484 current functions, 386 may be called from VBA as methods of the object &quot;WorksheetFunction&quot; and 44 have the same names as VBA functions.

With the introduction of LAMBDA, Excel became Turing complete.

=== Macro programming ===

==== VBA programming ====


The Windows version of Excel supports programming through Microsoft&#x27;s Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), which is a dialect of Visual Basic. Programming with VBA allows spreadsheet manipulation that is awkward or impossible with standard spreadsheet techniques. Programmers may write code directly using the Visual Basic Editor (VBE), which includes a window for writing code, debugging code, and code module organization environment. The user can implement numerical methods as well as automating tasks such as formatting or data organization in VBA and guide the calculation using any desired intermediate results reported back to the spreadsheet.

VBA was removed from Mac Excel 2008, as the developers did not believe that a timely release would allow porting the VBA engine natively to Mac OS X. VBA was restored in the next version, Mac Excel 2011, although the build lacks support for ActiveX objects, impacting some high level developer tools.

A common and easy way to generate VBA code is by using the Macro Recorder. The Macro Recorder records actions of the user and generates VBA code in the form of a macro. These actions can then be repeated automatically by running the macro. The macros can also be linked to different trigger types like keyboard shortcuts, a command button or a graphic. The actions in the macro can be executed from these trigger types or from the generic toolbar options. The VBA code of the macro can also be edited in the VBE. Certain features such as loop functions and screen prompt by their own properties, and some graphical display items, cannot be recorded but must be entered into the VBA module directly by the programmer. Advanced users can employ user prompts to create an interactive program, or react to events such as sheets being loaded or changed.

Macro Recorded code may not be compatible with Excel versions. Some code that is used in Excel 2010 cannot be used in Excel 2003. Making a Macro that changes the cell colors and making changes to other aspects of cells may not be backward compatible.

VBA code interacts with the spreadsheet through the Excel &quot;Object Model&quot;, a vocabulary identifying spreadsheet objects, and a set of supplied functions or &quot;methods&quot; that enable reading and writing to the spreadsheet and interaction with its users (for example, through custom toolbars or &quot;command bars&quot; and &quot;message boxes&quot;). User-created VBA subroutines execute these actions and operate like macros generated using the macro recorder, but are more flexible and efficient.

==== History ====
From its first version Excel supported end-user programming of macros (automation of repetitive tasks) and user-defined functions (extension of Excel&#x27;s built-in function library). In early versions of Excel, these programs were written in a macro language whose statements had formula syntax and resided in the cells of special-purpose macro sheets (stored with file extension .XLM in Windows.) XLM was the default macro language for Excel through Excel 4.0. Beginning with version 5.0 Excel recorded macros in VBA by default but with version 5.0 XLM recording was still allowed as an option. After version 5.0 that option was discontinued. All versions of Excel, including Excel 2021, are capable of running an XLM macro, though Microsoft discourages their use.

=== Python programming ===

In 2023 Microsoft announced Excel would support the Python programming language directly. As of January 2024, Python in Excel is available in the Microsoft 365 Insider Program.

=== Charts ===
Excel supports charts, graphs, or histograms generated from specified groups of cells. It also supports Pivot Charts that allow for a chart to be linked directly to a Pivot table. This allows the chart to be refreshed with the Pivot Table. The generated graphic component can either be embedded within the current sheet or added as a separate object.

These displays are dynamically updated if the content of cells changes. For example, suppose that the important design requirements are displayed visually; then, in response to a user&#x27;s change in trial values for parameters, the curves describing the design change shape, and their points of intersection shift, assisting the selection of the best design.

=== Add-ins ===
Additional features are available using add-ins. Several are provided with Excel, including:

* Analysis ToolPak: Provides data analysis tools for statistical and engineering analysis (includes analysis of variance and regression analysis)
* Analysis ToolPak VBA: VBA functions for Analysis ToolPak
* Euro Currency Tools: Conversion and formatting for euro currency
* Solver Add-In: Tools for optimization and equation solving

== Data storage and communication ==

=== Number of rows and columns ===
Versions of Excel up to 7.0 had a limitation in the size of their data sets of 16K (214 = ) rows. Versions 8.0 through 11.0 could handle 64K (216 = ) rows and 256 columns (28 as label &#x27;IV&#x27;). Version 12.0 onwards, including the current Version 16.x, can handle over 1M (220 = ) rows, and (214, labeled as column &#x27;XFD&#x27;) columns.

=== File formats ===
Up until the 2007 version, Microsoft Excel used a proprietary binary file format called Excel Binary File Format (.XLS) as its primary format. Excel 2007 uses Office Open XML as its primary file format, an XML-based format that followed after a previous XML-based format called &quot;XML Spreadsheet&quot; (&quot;XMLSS&quot;), first introduced in Excel 2002.

Although supporting and encouraging the use of new XML-based formats as replacements, Excel 2007 remained backwards-compatible with the traditional, binary formats. In addition, most versions of Microsoft Excel can read CSV, DBF, SYLK, DIF, and other legacy formats. Support for some older file formats was removed in Excel 2007. The file formats were mainly from DOS-based programs.

==== Binary ====
OpenOffice.org has created documentation of the Excel format. Two epochs of the format exist: the 97-2003 OLE format, and the older stream format. Microsoft has made the Excel binary format specification available to freely download.

==== XML Spreadsheet ====

The &quot;XML Spreadsheet&quot; format introduced in Excel 2002 is a simple, XML based format missing some more advanced features like storage of VBA macros. Though the intended file extension for this format is &quot;.xml&quot;, the program also correctly handles XML files with &quot;.xls&quot; extension. This feature is widely used by third-party applications (e.g. &quot;MySQL Query Browser&quot;) to offer &quot;export to Excel&quot; capabilities without implementing binary file format. The following example will be correctly opened by Excel if saved either as &quot;Book1.xml&quot; or &quot;Book1.xls&quot;:
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;Workbook xmlns=&quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:spreadsheet&quot;
 xmlns:o=&quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot;
 xmlns:x=&quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:excel&quot;
 xmlns:ss=&quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:spreadsheet&quot;
 xmlns:html=&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40&quot;&gt;
 &lt;Worksheet ss:Name=&quot;Sheet1&quot;&gt;
 &lt;Table ss:ExpandedColumnCount=&quot;2&quot; ss:ExpandedRowCount=&quot;2&quot; x:FullColumns=&quot;1&quot; x:FullRows=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
 &lt;Row&gt;
 &lt;Cell&gt;&lt;Data ss:Type=&quot;String&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/Data&gt;&lt;/Cell&gt;
 &lt;Cell&gt;&lt;Data ss:Type=&quot;String&quot;&gt;Example&lt;/Data&gt;&lt;/Cell&gt;
 &lt;/Row&gt;
 &lt;Row&gt;
 &lt;Cell&gt;&lt;Data ss:Type=&quot;String&quot;&gt;Value&lt;/Data&gt;&lt;/Cell&gt;
 &lt;Cell&gt;&lt;Data ss:Type=&quot;Number&quot;&gt;123&lt;/Data&gt;&lt;/Cell&gt;
 &lt;/Row&gt;
 &lt;/Table&gt;
 &lt;/Worksheet&gt;
&lt;/Workbook&gt;
==== Current file extensions ====
Microsoft Excel 2007, along with the other products in the Microsoft Office 2007 suite, introduced new file formats. The first of these (.xlsx) is defined in the Office Open XML (OOXML) specification.

==== Old file extensions ====
=== Using other Windows applications ===
Windows applications such as Microsoft Access and Microsoft Word, as well as Excel can communicate with each other and use each other&#x27;s capabilities. The most common is Dynamic Data Exchange: although strongly deprecated by Microsoft, this is a common method to send data between applications running on Windows, with official MS publications referring to it as &quot;the protocol from hell&quot;. As the name suggests, it allows applications to supply data to others for calculation and display. It is very common in financial markets, being used to connect to important financial data services such as Bloomberg and Reuters.

OLE Object Linking and Embedding allows a Windows application to control another to enable it to format or calculate data. This may take on the form of &quot;embedding&quot; where an application uses another to handle a task that it is more suited to, for example a PowerPoint presentation may be embedded in an Excel spreadsheet or vice versa.

=== Using external data ===
Excel users can access external data sources via Microsoft Office features such as (for example) connections built with the Office Data Connection file format. Excel files themselves may be updated using a Microsoft supplied ODBC driver.

Excel can accept data in real-time through several programming interfaces, which allow it to communicate with many data sources such as Bloomberg and Reuters (through addins such as Power Plus Pro).

* DDE: &quot;Dynamic Data Exchange&quot; uses the message passing mechanism in Windows to allow data to flow between Excel and other applications. Although it is easy for users to create such links, programming such links reliably is so difficult that Microsoft, the creators of the system, officially refer to it as &quot;the protocol from hell&quot;. In spite of its many issues DDE remains the most common way for data to reach traders in financial markets.
* Network DDE Extended the protocol to allow spreadsheets on different computers to exchange data. Starting with Windows Vista, Microsoft no longer supports the facility.
* Real Time Data: RTD although in many ways technically superior to DDE, has been slow to gain acceptance, since it requires non-trivial programming skills, and when first released was neither adequately documented nor supported by the major data vendors.

Alternatively, Microsoft Query provides ODBC-based browsing within Microsoft Excel.

=== Export and migration of spreadsheets ===
Programmers have produced APIs to open Excel spreadsheets in a variety of applications and environments other than Microsoft Excel. These include opening Excel documents on the web using either ActiveX controls, or plugins like the Adobe Flash Player. The Apache POI open-source project provides Java libraries for reading and writing Excel spreadsheet files.

=== Password protection ===
Microsoft Excel protection offers several types of passwords:
* Password to open a document
* Password to modify a document
* Password to unprotect the worksheet
* Password to protect workbook
* Password to protect the sharing workbook
All passwords except &quot;password to open a document&quot; can be removed instantly regardless of the Microsoft Excel version used to create the document. These types of passwords are used primarily for shared work on a document. Such password-protected documents are not encrypted, and data sources from a set password are saved in a document&#x27;s header. &quot;Password to protect workbook&quot; is an exception – when it is set, a document is encrypted with the standard password &quot;VelvetSweatshop&quot;, but since it is known to the public, it actually does not add any extra protection to the document. The only type of password that can prevent a trespasser from gaining access to a document is the &quot;password to open a document&quot;. The cryptographic strength of this kind of protection depends strongly on the Microsoft Excel version that was used to create the document.

In &quot;Microsoft Excel 95&quot; and earlier versions, the password to open is converted to a 16-bit key that can be instantly cracked. In &quot;Excel 97/2000&quot; the password is converted to a 40-bit key, which can also be cracked very quickly using modern equipment. As regards services that use rainbow tables (e.g. Password-Find), it takes up to several seconds to remove protection. In addition, password-cracking programs can brute-force attack passwords at a rate of hundreds of thousands of passwords a second, which not only lets them decrypt a document but also find the original password.

In &quot;Excel 2003/XP&quot; the encryption is slightly better – a user can choose any encryption algorithm that is available in the system (see Cryptographic Service Provider). Due to the CSP, an &quot;Excel&quot; file cannot be decrypted, and thus the &quot;password to open&quot; cannot be removed, though the brute-force attack speed remains quite high. Nevertheless, the older &quot;Excel 97/2000&quot; algorithm is set by the default. Therefore, users who do not change the default settings lack reliable protection of their documents.

The situation changed fundamentally in &quot;Excel 2007&quot;, where the modern AES algorithm with a key of 128 bits started being used for decryption, and a 50,000-fold use of the hash function SHA1 reduced the speed of brute-force attacks down to hundreds of passwords per second. In &quot;Excel 2010&quot;, the strength of the protection by the default was increased two times due to the use of a 100,000-fold SHA1 to convert a password to a key.

== Other platforms ==
===Excel for mobile===

Excel Mobile is a spreadsheet program that can edit XLSX files. It can edit and format text in cells, calculate formulas, search within the spreadsheet, sort rows and columns, freeze panes, filter the columns, add comments, and create charts. It cannot add columns or rows except at the edge of the document, rearrange columns or rows, delete rows or columns, or add spreadsheet tabs. The 2007 version has the ability to use a full-screen mode to deal with limited screen resolution, as well as split panes to view different parts of a worksheet at one time. Protection settings, zoom settings, autofilter settings, certain chart formatting, hidden sheets, and other features are not supported on Excel Mobile, and will be modified upon opening and saving a workbook. In 2015, Excel Mobile became available for Windows 10 and Windows 10 Mobile on Windows Store.

===Excel for the web===

Excel for the web is a free lightweight version of Microsoft Excel available as part of Office on the web, which also includes web versions of Microsoft Word and Microsoft PowerPoint.

Excel for the web can display most of the features available in the desktop versions of Excel, although it may not be able to insert or edit them. Certain data connections are not accessible on Excel for the web, including with charts that may use these external connections. Excel for the web also cannot display legacy features, such as Excel 4.0 macros or Excel 5.0 dialog sheets. There are also small differences between how some of the Excel functions work.

== Microsoft Excel Viewer == 
Microsoft Excel Viewer was a freeware program for Microsoft Windows for viewing and printing spreadsheet documents created by Excel. Microsoft retired the viewer in April 2018 with the last security update released in February 2019 for Excel Viewer 2007 (SP3).

The first version released by Microsoft was Excel 97 Viewer. Excel 97 Viewer was supported in Windows CE for Handheld PCs. In October 2004, Microsoft released Excel Viewer 2003. In September 2007, Microsoft released Excel Viewer 2003 Service Pack 3 (SP3). In January 2008, Microsoft released Excel Viewer 2007 (featuring a non-collapsible Ribbon interface). In April 2009, Microsoft released Excel Viewer 2007 Service Pack 2 (SP2). In October 2011, Microsoft released Excel Viewer 2007 Service Pack 3 (SP3).

Microsoft advises to view and print Excel files for free to use the Excel Mobile application for Windows 10 and for Windows 7 and Windows 8 to upload the file to OneDrive and use Excel for the web with a Microsoft account to open them in a browser.

== Limitations and errors ==

In addition to issues with spreadsheets in general, other problems specific to Excel include numeric precision, misleading statistics functions, mod function errors, date limitations and more.

=== Numeric precision ===

Despite the use of 15-figure precision, Excel can display many more figures (up to thirty) upon user request. But the displayed figures are &quot;not&quot; those actually used in its computations, and so, for example, the difference of two numbers may differ from the difference of their displayed values. Although such departures are usually beyond the 15th decimal, exceptions do occur, especially for very large or very small numbers. Serious errors can occur if decisions are made based upon automated comparisons of numbers (for example, using the Excel &quot;If&quot; function), as equality of two numbers can be unpredictable.

In the figure, the fraction 1/9000 is displayed in Excel. Although this number has a decimal representation that is an infinite string of ones, Excel displays only the leading 15 figures. In the second line, the number one is added to the fraction, and again Excel displays only 15 figures. In the third line, one is subtracted from the sum using Excel. Because the sum in the second line has only eleven 1&#x27;s after the decimal, the difference when 1 is subtracted from this displayed value is three 0&#x27;s followed by a string of eleven 1&#x27;s. However, the difference reported by Excel in the third line is three 0&#x27;s followed by a string of &quot;thirteen&quot; 1&#x27;s and two extra erroneous digits. This is because Excel calculates with about half a digit more than it displays.

Excel works with a modified 1985 version of the IEEE 754 specification. Excel&#x27;s implementation involves conversions between binary and decimal representations, leading to accuracy that is on average better than one would expect from simple fifteen digit precision, but that can be worse. See the main article for details.

Besides accuracy in user computations, the question of accuracy in Excel-provided functions may be raised. Particularly in the arena of statistical functions, Excel has been criticized for sacrificing accuracy for speed of calculation.

As many calculations in Excel are executed using VBA, an additional issue is the accuracy of VBA, which varies with variable type and user-requested precision.

=== Statistical functions ===
The accuracy and convenience of statistical tools in Excel has been criticized, as mishandling situations when data is missing, as returning incorrect values due to inept handling of round-off and large numbers, as only selectively updating calculations on a spreadsheet when some cell values are changed, and as having a limited set of statistical tools. Microsoft has announced that some of these issues are addressed in Excel 2010.

=== Excel MOD function error ===
Excel has issues with modulo operations. In the case of excessively large results, Excel will return the error warning instead of an answer.

=== Fictional leap day in 1900 ===
Excel includes February 29, 1900, incorrectly treating 1900 as a leap year, even though e.g. 2100 is correctly treated as a non-leap year. Thus, a formula counting dates between (for example) February 1, 1900 and March 1, 1900 will return an incorrect result. The bug originated from Lotus 1-2-3, where it was deliberately implemented to save computer memory, and was also intentionally implemented in Excel for the purpose of bug compatibility. This legacy has later been carried over into Office Open XML file format.

=== Date range ===
Excel supports dates with years in the range 1900–9999, except that December 31, 1899, can be entered as 0 and is displayed as 0-jan-1900.

Converting a fraction of a day into hours, minutes and days by treating it as a moment on the day January 1, 1900, does not work for a negative fraction.

=== Conversion problems ===
If text is entered that happens to be in a form that Excel interprets as a date, the text can be unintentionally changed to a standard date format. A similar problem occurs when a text happens to be in the form of a floating-point notation of a number. In these cases the original exact text cannot be recovered from the result. Formatting the cell as TEXT before entering ambiguous text prevents Excel from converting it.

This issue has caused a well known problem in the analysis of DNA, for example in bioinformatics. As first reported in 2004, genetic scientists found that Excel automatically and incorrectly converts certain gene names into dates. A follow-up study in 2016 found many peer reviewed scientific journal papers had been affected and that &quot;Of the selected journals, the proportion of published articles with Excel files containing gene lists that are affected by gene name errors is 19.6%.&quot; Excel parses the copied and pasted data and sometimes changes them depending on what it thinks they are. For example, MARCH1 (Membrane Associated Ring-CH-type finger 1) gets converted to the date March 1 (1-Mar) and SEPT2 (Septin 2) is converted into September 2 (2-Sep) etc. While some secondary news sources reported this as a fault with Excel, the original authors of the 2016 paper placed the blame with the researchers misusing Excel.

In August 2020 the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) published new guidelines in the journal Nature regarding gene naming in order to avoid issues with &quot;symbols that affect data handling and retrieval.&quot; So far 27 genes have been renamed, including changing MARCH1 to MARCHF1 and SEPT1 to SEPTIN1 in order to avoid accidental conversion of the gene names into dates.

In October 2023, Microsoft fixed the long-standing issue.

=== Errors with large strings ===

The following functions return incorrect results when passed a string longer than 255 characters:
* incorrectly returns 16, meaning &quot;Error value&quot;
* , when called as a method of the VBA object (i.e., in VBA), incorrectly returns &quot;false&quot;.

=== Filenames ===
Microsoft Excel will not open two documents with the same name and instead will display the following error:

: A document with the name &#x27;%s&#x27; is already open. You cannot open two documents with the same name, even if the documents are in different folders. To open the second document, either close the document that is currently open, or rename one of the documents.
The reason is for calculation ambiguity with linked cells. If there is a cell , and there are two books named &quot;Book1&quot; open, there is no way to tell which one the user means.

== Versions ==
=== Early history ===
Microsoft originally marketed a spreadsheet program called Multiplan in 1982. Multiplan became very popular on CP/M systems, but on MS-DOS systems it lost popularity to Lotus 1-2-3. Microsoft released the first version of Excel for the Macintosh on September 30, 1985, and the first Windows version was 2.05 (to synchronize with the Macintosh version 2.2) on November 19, 1987. Lotus was slow to bring 1-2-3 to Windows and by the early 1990s, Excel had started to outsell 1-2-3 and helped Microsoft achieve its position as a leading PC software developer. This accomplishment solidified Microsoft as a valid competitor and showed its future in developing GUI software. Microsoft maintained its advantage with regular new releases, every two years or so.

=== Microsoft Windows ===
Excel 2.0 is the first version of Excel for the Intel platform. Versions prior to 2.0 were only available on the Apple Macintosh.

==== Excel 2.0 (1987) ====
The first Windows version was labeled &quot;2&quot; to correspond to the Mac version. It was announced on October 6, 1987, and released on November 19. This included a run-time version of Windows.

&quot;BYTE&quot; in 1989 listed Excel for Windows as among the &quot;Distinction&quot; winners of the BYTE Awards. The magazine stated that the port of the &quot;extraordinary&quot; Macintosh version &quot;shines&quot;, with a user interface as good as or better than the original.

==== Excel 3.0 (1990) ====
Included toolbars, drawing capabilities, outlining, add-in support, 3D charts, and many more new features.

==== Excel 4.0 (1992) ====
Included with Microsoft Office 3.0, this version introduced auto-fill.

Also, an easter egg in Excel 4.0 reveals a hidden animation of a dancing set of numbers 1 through 3, representing Lotus 1–2–3, which is then crushed by an Excel logo.

==== Excel 5.0 (1993) ====
With version 5.0, included in Microsoft Office 4.2 and 4.3, Excel included Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), a programming language based on Visual Basic which adds the ability to automate tasks in Excel and to provide user-defined functions (UDF) for use in worksheets. VBA includes a fully featured integrated development environment (IDE). Macro recording can produce VBA code replicating user actions, thus allowing simple automation of regular tasks. VBA allows the creation of forms and in‑worksheet controls to communicate with the user. The language supports use (but not creation) of ActiveX (COM) DLL&#x27;s; later versions add support for class modules allowing the use of basic object-oriented programming techniques.

The automation functionality provided by VBA made Excel a target for macro viruses. This caused serious problems until antivirus products began to detect these viruses. Microsoft belatedly took steps to prevent the misuse by adding the ability to disable macros completely, to enable macros when opening a workbook or to trust all macros signed using a trusted certificate.

Versions 5.0 to 9.0 of Excel contain various Easter eggs, including a &quot;Hall of Tortured Souls&quot;, a &quot;Doom&quot;-like minigame, although since version 10 Microsoft has taken measures to eliminate such undocumented features from their products.

5.0 was released in a 16-bit x86 version for Windows 3.1 and later in a 32-bit version for NT 3.51 (x86/Alpha/PowerPC)

==== Excel 95 (v7.0) ====

Released in 1995 with Microsoft Office for Windows 95, this is the first major version after Excel 5.0, as there is no Excel 6.0 with all of the Office applications standardizing on the same major version number.

Internal rewrite to 32-bits. Almost no external changes, but faster and more stable.

Excel 95 contained a hidden &quot;Doom&quot;-like mini-game called &quot;The Hall of Tortured Souls&quot;, a series of rooms featuring the names and faces of the developers as an Easter egg.

==== Excel 97 (v8.0) ====
Included in Office 97 (for x86 and Alpha). This was a major upgrade that introduced the paper clip office assistant and featured standard VBA used instead of internal Excel Basic. It introduced the now-removed Natural Language labels.

This version of Excel includes a flight simulator as an Easter egg.

==== Excel 2000 (v9.0) ====

Included in Office 2000. This was a minor upgrade but introduced an upgrade to the clipboard where it can hold multiple objects at once. The Office Assistant, whose frequent unsolicited appearance in Excel 97 had annoyed many users, became less intrusive.

A small 3-D game called &quot;Dev Hunter&quot; (inspired by Spy Hunter) was included as an Easter egg.

==== Excel 2002 (v10.0) ====
Included in Office XP. Very minor enhancements.

==== Excel 2003 (v11.0) ====
Included in Office 2003. Minor enhancements.

==== Excel 2007 (v12.0) ====

Included in Office 2007. This release was a major upgrade from the previous version. Similar to other updated Office products, Excel in 2007 used the new Ribbon menu system. This was different from what users were used to, and was met with mixed reactions. One study reported fairly good acceptance by users except for highly experienced users and users of word processing applications with a classical WIMP interface, but was less convinced in terms of efficiency and organization. However, an online survey reported that a majority of respondents had a negative opinion of the change, with advanced users being &quot;somewhat more negative&quot; than intermediate users, and users reporting a self-estimated reduction in productivity.

Added functionality included Tables, and the SmartArt set of editable business diagrams. Also added was an improved management of named variables through the &quot;Name Manager&quot;, and much-improved flexibility in formatting graphs, which allow (&quot;x, y&quot;) coordinate labeling and lines of arbitrary weight. Several improvements to pivot tables were introduced.

Also like other office products, the Office Open XML file formats were introduced, including &quot;.xlsm&quot; for a workbook with macros and &quot;.xlsx&quot; for a workbook without macros.

Specifically, many of the size limitations of previous versions were greatly increased. To illustrate, the number of rows was now 1,048,576 (220) and the columns was 16,384 (214; the far-right column is XFD). This changes what is a valid &quot;A1&quot; reference versus a named range. This version made more extensive use of multiple cores for the calculation of spreadsheets; however, VBA macros are not handled in parallel and XLL add‑ins were only executed in parallel if they were thread-safe and this was indicated at registration.

==== Excel 2010 (v14.0) ====

Included in Office 2010, this is the next major version after v12.0, as version number 13 was skipped.

Minor enhancements and 64-bit support, including the following:
* Multi-threading recalculation (MTR) for commonly used functions
* Improved pivot tables
* More conditional formatting options
* Additional image editing capabilities
* In-cell charts called &quot;sparklines&quot;
* Ability to preview before pasting
* Office 2010 &quot;backstage&quot; feature for document-related tasks
* Ability to customize the Ribbon
* Many new formulas, most highly specialized to improve accuracy

==== Excel 2013 (v15.0) ====
Included in Office 2013, along with a lot of new tools included in this release:
* Improved Multi-threading and Memory Contention
* FlashFill
* Power View
* Power Pivot
* Timeline Slicer
* Windows App
* Inquire 
* 50 new functions

==== Excel 2016 (v16.0) ====
Included in Office 2016, along with a lot of new tools included in this release:
* Power Query integration 
* Read-only mode for Excel
* Keyboard access for Pivot Tables and Slicers in Excel
* New Chart Types
* Quick data linking in Visio
*Excel forecasting functions
*Support for multiselection of Slicer items using touch
*Time grouping and Pivot Chart Drill Down
*Excel data cards

==== Excel 2019, Excel 2021, Office 365 and subsequent (v16.0) ====

Microsoft no longer releases Office or Excel in discrete versions. Instead, features are introduced automatically over time using Windows Update. The version number remains 16.0. Thereafter only the approximate dates when features appear can now be given.

* Dynamic Arrays. These are essentially Array Formulas but they &quot;Spill&quot; automatically into neighboring cells and do not need the ctrl-shift-enter to create them. Further, dynamic arrays are the default format, with new &quot;@&quot; and &quot;#&quot; operators to provide compatibility with previous versions. This is perhaps the biggest structural change since 2007, and is in response to a similar feature in Google Sheets. Dynamic arrays started appearing in pre-releases about 2018, and as of March 2020 are available in published versions of Office 365 provided a user selected &quot;Office Insiders&quot;.

===Summary===



== Impact ==
Excel offers many user interface tweaks over the earliest electronic spreadsheets; however, the essence remains the same as in the original spreadsheet software, VisiCalc: the program displays cells organized in rows and columns, and each cell may contain data or a formula, with relative or absolute references to other cells.

Excel 2.0 for Windows, which was modeled after its Mac GUI-based counterpart, indirectly expanded the installed base of the then-nascent Windows environment. Excel 2.0 was released a month before Windows 2.0, and the installed base of Windows was so low at that point in 1987 that Microsoft had to bundle a runtime version of Windows 1.0 with Excel 2.0. Unlike Microsoft Word, there never was a DOS version of Excel.

Excel became the first spreadsheet to allow the user to define the appearance of spreadsheets (fonts, character attributes, and cell appearance). It also introduced intelligent cell re-computation, where only cells dependent on the cell being modified are updated (previous spreadsheet programs recomputed everything all the time or waited for a specific user command). Excel introduced auto-fill, the ability to drag and expand the selection box to automatically copy a cell or row contents to adjacent cells or rows, adjusting the copies intelligently by automatically incrementing cell references or contents. Excel also introduced extensive graphing capabilities.

==Security==
Because Excel is widely used, it has been attacked by hackers. While Excel is not directly exposed to the Internet, if an attacker can get a victim to open a file in Excel, and there is an appropriate security bug in Excel, then the attacker can gain control of the victim&#x27;s computer. UK&#x27;s GCHQ has a tool named TORNADO ALLEY with this purpose.

== Games ==
Besides the easter eggs, numerous games have been created or recreated in Excel, such as &quot;Tetris&quot;, &quot;2048&quot;, &quot;Scrabble&quot;, &quot;Yahtzee&quot;, &quot;Angry Birds&quot;, &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, &quot;Civilization&quot;, &quot;Monopoly&quot;, &quot;Battleship&quot;, Blackjack, &quot;Space Invaders&quot;, and others.

In 2020, Excel became an esport with the advent of the Financial Modeling World Cup.

<text>Michael Kelland John Hutchence (22 January 1960 – 22 November 1997) was an Australian singer and songwriter. He was the co-founder, lead singer, and lyricist of the rock band INXS from 1977 until his death in 1997. The band sold over 50 million records worldwide, making them one of Australia&#x27;s highest-selling music acts of all time. They were also inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in 2001.

Hutchence was also a member of the short-lived band Max Q and recorded some solo material, alongside acting in films such as &quot;Dogs in Space&quot; (1986) and &quot;Frankenstein Unbound&quot; (1990). He was known for his string of love affairs with actresses, models, and singers, and his private life was often covered in the international press. He had a daughter with Welsh television presenter Paula Yates. Hutchence died by suicide in a Sydney hotel room on 22 November 1997, at the age of 37.

==Early life==
Michael Hutchence was born in the Crows Nest suburb of Sydney on 22 January 1960, the son of make-up artist Patricia Glassop and businessman Kelland Frank &quot;Kell&quot; Hutchence. He had an elder half-sister named Tina. His paternal grandparents were an English couple who had relocated to Sydney in 1922, while his maternal grandfather was an Irish man from County Cork.

Following Kell&#x27;s business interests, the Hutchence family moved to Brisbane, where Hutchence&#x27;s younger brother Rhett was born. They later left Australia for Hong Kong. During the early years in Hong Kong, both boys attended Glenealy Junior School and Beacon Hill School. Hutchence showed promise as a swimmer before badly breaking his arm. He then began to show interest in poetry and performed his first song in a local toy store commercial. He later attended King George V School during his early teens. The family returned to Sydney in 1972, buying a house in Belrose.

Hutchence attended Davidson High School, where he met and befriended Andrew Farriss. Around this time, the two spent a lot of time jamming with Farriss&#x27; brothers Tim and Jon in the garage. Farriss convinced Hutchence to join his band, Doctor Dolphin, alongside their classmates Kent Kerny and Neil Sanders. Bassist Garry Beers and drummer Geoff Kennelly from nearby Forest High School completed the line-up.

Hutchence&#x27;s parents separated when he was 15, and he lived with his mother and half-sister in California for a short time in 1976. He later returned to Sydney with them. In 1977, a new band called the Farriss Brothers was formed with Andrew on keyboards, Tim on lead guitar, and Jon on drums. Hutchence joined on vocals and Beers on bass, while Kirk Pengilly joined on guitar and saxophone. The band made their debut on 16 August 1977 at a venue in Whale Beach.

==Career==
===Early career===
Hutchence, the Farriss brothers, Kerny, Sanders, Beers and Kennelly briefly performed as the Vegetables, singing &quot;We Are the Vegetables&quot;. Ten months later, they returned to Sydney and recorded a set of demos. The Farriss Brothers regularly supported hard rockers Midnight Oil on the pub rock circuit, and were renamed as INXS in 1979. Their first performance under the new name was on 1 September at the Oceanview Hotel in Toukley. In May 1980, the group released their first single, &quot;Simple Simon&quot;/&quot;We Are the Vegetables&quot; which was followed by the debut album &quot;INXS&quot; in October. Their first Top 40 Australian hit on the Kent Music Report Singles Chart, &quot;Just Keep Walking&quot;, was released in September 1980. Hutchence became the main spokesman for the band, and co-wrote almost all of the band&#x27;s songs with Andrew Farriss.

According to Hutchence, most of the songs on the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Underneath the Colours&quot;, were written within a fairly short space of time: &quot;Most bands shudder at the prospect of having 20 years to write their first album and four days to write their second. For us, though, it was good. It left less room for us to go off on all sorts of tangents&quot;. Soon after recording sessions for &quot;Underneath the Colours&quot; – produced by Richard Clapton – had finished, band members started work on outside projects. Hutchence recorded &quot;Speed Kills&quot;, written by Don Walker of hard rockers Cold Chisel, for the soundtrack to the 1982 film &quot;Freedom&quot;, directed by Scott Hicks. It was Hutchence&#x27;s first solo single and was released by WEA in April 1982.

===Stardom and acting career===
In March 1985, after Hutchence and INXS recorded their album &quot;The Swing&quot; (1984), WEA released the Australian version of &quot;Dekadance&quot;, as a limited edition cassette only EP of six tracks including remixes from the album. The cassette also included a cover version of Nancy Sinatra and Lee Hazlewood&#x27;s hit &quot;Jackson&quot;, which Hutchence sang as a duet with Jenny Morris, a backing singer for &quot;The Swing&quot; sessions. The EP reached No 2 on the Kent Music Report Albums Chart. Hutchence provided vocals for new wave band Beargarden&#x27;s 1985 single release.

On 19 May 1984, INXS won seven awards at the &quot;Countdown&quot; Music and Video Awards ceremony, including &#x27;Best Songwriter&#x27; for Hutchence and Andrew, and &#x27;Most Popular Male&#x27; for Hutchence. They performed &quot;Burn for You&quot;, dressed in Akubras (a brand of hats) and Drizabones (a brand of outdoor coats/oilskin jackets) followed by Hutchence and Morris singing &quot;Jackson&quot; to close.

In 1986, Hutchence played Sam, the male lead in the Australian film &quot;Dogs in Space&quot;, directed by long-time INXS music video collaborator Richard Lowenstein. Hutchence provided four songs to the film&#x27;s soundtrack. Also working on the film and its soundtrack, as music director, was Ollie Olsen (ex-Whirlywirld).

Late in 1986, before commencing work on a new INXS album and while supposedly taking an eight-month break, the band&#x27;s management decided to stage the Australian Made tour as a series of major outdoor concerts across the country. The roster featured INXS, Jimmy Barnes (Cold Chisel), Models, Divinyls, Mental as Anything, the Triffids and I&#x27;m Talking. To promote the tour, Hutchence and Barnes shared vocals on the Easybeats cover &quot;Good Times&quot; and &quot;Laying Down the Law&quot;, which Barnes cowrote with Beers, Andrew Farriss, Jon Farriss, Hutchence and Pengilly. &quot;Good Times&quot; was used as the theme for the concert series of 1986–1987. It peaked at No. 2 on the Australian charts, and months later was featured in the Joel Schumacher film &quot;The Lost Boys&quot; and its soundtrack, allowing it to peak at No. 47 in the U.S. on 1 August 1987. Divinyls&#x27; lead singer Chrissy Amphlett enjoyed the tour and reconnected with Hutchence, stating that &quot;[he] was a sweet man, who said in one interview that he wanted me to have his baby.&quot; In 1987, Hutchence provided vocals for Richard Clapton&#x27;s album &quot;Glory Road&quot;, which was produced by Jon Farriss.

INXS released &quot;Kick&quot; in October 1987, and the album provided the band with worldwide popularity. &quot;Kick&quot; peaked at No. 1 in Australia, No. 3 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, No. 9 in UK, and No. 15 in Austria. The band&#x27;s most successful studio album, &quot;Kick&quot; has been certified six times platinum by the RIAA and spawned four US top 10 singles (&quot;New Sensation&quot;, &quot;Never Tear Us Apart&quot;, &quot;Devil Inside&quot; and &quot;Need You Tonight&quot;, the last of which reached the top of the US &quot;Billboard&quot; singles charts). According to &quot;1001 Songs: The Great Songs of All Time and the Artists, Stories and Secrets Behind Them&quot;, the single &quot;Need You Tonight&quot; is not lyrically complex; it is Hutchence&#x27;s performance where &quot;he sings in kittenish whisper, gently drawing back with the incredible lust of a tiger hunting in the night&quot; that makes the song &quot;as sexy and funky as any white rock group has ever been&quot;. In September 1988, the band swept the MTV Video Music Awards with the video for &quot;Need You Tonight/Mediate&quot; winning in five categories.

In 1989, Hutchence collaborated further with Olsen for the Max Q project, and was joined by members of Olsen&#x27;s previous groups including Whirlywirld, No and Orchestra of Skin and Bone. They released a self-titled album and three singles, &quot;Way of the World&quot;, &quot;Sometimes&quot; and &quot;Monday Night by Satellite&quot;. Max Q disbanded in 1990. &quot;Max Q&quot; showed Hutchence exploring the darker side of his music and, with Olsen, he created &quot;one of the most innovative dance music albums of the decade&quot;. Hutchence wrote most of the music and provided &quot;an extraordinary performance ... it was one of the most significant statements Hutchence was to make&quot;. In 1990, Hutchence portrayed nineteenth-century Romantic poet Percy Shelley in Roger Corman&#x27;s film version of &quot;Frankenstein Unbound&quot;, which was based on a science fiction time travel story of the same name written by Brian Aldiss.

In 1990, INXS released &quot;X&quot;, which spawned more international hits such as &quot;Suicide Blonde&quot; and &quot;Disappear&quot; (both Top 10 in the US). &quot;Suicide Blonde&quot; peaked at No. 2 in Australia and No. 11 in the UK. Hutchence, with Andrew Farriss, wrote the song after Hutchence&#x27;s then-girlfriend, Kylie Minogue, used the phrase &quot;suicide blonde&quot; to describe her look during her 1989 film, &quot;The Delinquents&quot;; the film depicted Minogue in a platinum blonde wig. Hutchence won the &#x27;Best International Artist&#x27; at the 1991 BRIT Awards with INXS winning the related group award. Hutchence provided vocals for pub rockers Noiseworks&#x27; album, &quot;Love Versus Money&quot; (1991). &quot;Welcome to Wherever You Are&quot; was released by INXS in August 1992. It received good critical reviews and went to No. 1 in the UK.

===Later career===
Hutchence and INXS faced reduced commercial success with &quot;Full Moon, Dirty Hearts&quot;, especially in the U.S. The band took time off to rest and be with their families, while Hutchence remained in the public eye through his romances. He commenced work on a self-titled solo album in the mid-1990s. After a period of inactivity and releases that received lukewarm reviews, INXS recorded the band&#x27;s 10th official album, &quot;Elegantly Wasted&quot;, in 1996.

===Artistry===
Hutchence was a baritone. His vocal range spanned from the bass B1 to the high tenor F#5. In 2013, &quot;News.com.au&quot; ranked Hutchence fourth in a list of the 15 greatest Australian singers of all time. Billboard described Hutchence as &quot;charismatic&quot;, with a &quot;seductive purr and [a] lithe, magnetic stage presence.&quot; Paul Donoughue of Australia&#x27;s &quot;ABC&quot;, wrote that Hutchence had &quot;a phenomenal voice — moody, sexual, and dynamic, able to shift effortlessly from fragile to cocksure.&quot; Reviewing an INXS concert, Dave Simpson of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote, &quot;Watching Hutchence, hair flailing, crotch thrusting, a mischievous smile forever creeping across his leathery face, I realised that here was a man born to be onstage, living and loving every minute, an explosion of sexual energy&quot;. Hutchence biographer Toby Creswell asserted that &quot;Hutchence was, without question, one of the truly great frontmen — he expressed the music in a dynamic way that few others could.&quot;

==Personal life==
According to &quot;People&quot;, Hutchence&#x27;s &quot;public brawls and onetime open drug use&quot; led London tabloids to dub him the &quot;wild man of rock&quot;. He was romantically linked to Australian singer and actress Kylie Minogue, American singer Belinda Carlisle, Danish model Helena Christensen, and Australian actress Kym Wilson.

In August 1992, Hutchence and Christensen were riding their bicycles at night in Copenhagen when he refused to move for a taxi. They were eating pizza when, unbeknownst to him, the taxi tried to get through the narrow street but &quot;didn&#x27;t beep its horn or anything&quot;. The taxi driver assaulted Hutchence, causing him to fall backwards and hit his head on the pavement; he suffered a fractured skull. Hutchence did not immediately seek medical assistance for the injury, and instead waited several days before seeing a doctor. He was left with brain damage and almost completely lost his sense of smell, as well as losing a significant amount of his sense of taste. The injury led to periods of depression and increased levels of aggression, and he had still not fully recovered after two weeks in a Copenhagen hospital. According to INXS bandmate Beers, Hutchence brandished a knife and threatened to kill him during the 1993 recording of &quot;Full Moon, Dirty Hearts&quot;. Beers recalled, &quot;Over those six weeks, Michael threatened or physically confronted nearly every member of the band.&quot;

In the mid-1990s, Hutchence became romantically involved with Welsh television presenter Paula Yates. They met in 1985, during an interview for the British TV program &quot;The Tube&quot;. Yates interviewed him again in 1994 for her &quot;Big Breakfast&quot; show, and their affair was soon uncovered by the British press. At the time, Yates was married to the Boomtown Rats singer and Live Aid organiser Bob Geldof. Media scrutiny was intense, and Hutchence assaulted a photographer who had followed them. Yates&#x27; separation from Geldof in February 1995 sparked a public and at times bitter custody battle over their daughters. Yates and Geldof divorced in May 1996.

On 22 July 1996, Yates gave birth to her daughter with Hutchence, Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily. In September 1996, Yates and Hutchence made headlines when they were arrested for suspicion of drug possession after the family nanny reportedly found a small amount of opium in a shoebox underneath their bed. The case was dropped due to lack of evidence. Paula Yates died on 17 September 2000 of an accidental heroin overdose; she was discovered in the presence of her and Hutchence&#x27;s then four-year-old daughter. Soon after Yates&#x27; death, Geldof assumed foster custody of their daughter so that she could be brought up with her three older half-sisters, Fifi, Peaches and Pixie. In 2007, their daughter was adopted by Geldof.

==Death==

On 22 November 1997, at the age of 37, Hutchence was found dead in his room at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in the Double Bay suburb of Sydney. His cause of death was recorded as suicide by hanging. Actress Kym Wilson, who visited Hutchence in his hotel room the previous evening, was the last person to see him alive.

Earlier that year, Hutchence and INXS had started a world tour to support the April 1997 release of &quot;Elegantly Wasted&quot;. The final 20th anniversary tour was to occur in Australia in November and December. During the tour, Paula Yates planned to visit Hutchence with their daughter and Yates&#x27; three other children, but Bob Geldof had taken legal action to prevent the visit.

Geldof and Yates each gave police statements concerning the phone calls they exchanged with Hutchence on the morning of his death, but did not volunteer their phone records. Yates&#x27; statement on 26 November indicated that she had informed Hutchence of the Geldof girls&#x27; custody hearing being adjourned until 17 December, which meant that Yates would not be able to bring their daughter and the Geldof girls to Australia for a visit as previously intended. According to Yates, Hutchence &quot;was frightened and couldn&#x27;t stand a minute more without his baby... [he] was terribly upset and he said &#x27;I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ll live without seeing Tiger&#x27;.&quot; She indicated that Hutchence said he was going to call Geldof &quot;to let the girls come to Australia&quot;.

Geldof&#x27;s police statements and evidence to the coroner indicated he did receive a call from Hutchence, who was &quot;hectoring and abusive and threatening&quot; during their phone conversation. The occupant in the room next to Hutchence&#x27;s heard a loud male voice and swearing at about 5:00 am; the coroner was satisfied that this was Hutchence arguing with Geldof.

At 9:54 am on 22 November, Hutchence spoke with a former girlfriend, Michele Bennett. According to Bennett, Hutchence was crying, sounded upset, and told her he needed to see her. Bennett arrived at his hotel room door at about 10:40 am, but there was no response. Hutchence&#x27;s body was discovered by a hotel maid at 11:50 am. Police reported that Hutchence was found &quot;in a kneeling position facing the door. He had used his snakeskin belt to tie a knot on the automatic door closure at the top of the door, and had strained his head forward into the loop so hard that the buckle had broken.&quot;

On 6 February 1998, after an autopsy and coronial inquest, New South Wales State Coroner, Derrick Hand, presented his report. The report ruled that Hutchence&#x27;s death was suicide while depressed and under the influence of alcohol and other drugs. &quot;An analysis report of Hutchence&#x27;s blood [indicated] the presence of alcohol, cocaine, Prozac and prescription drugs.&quot; In producing his coroner&#x27;s report, Hand had specifically considered the suggestions of accidental death (coupled with the fact that Hutchence left no suicide note), but had discounted them based on substantial evidence presented to the contrary. In a 1999 interview on &quot;60 Minutes&quot; (and in a documentary film on Channel 4), Yates claimed that Hutchence&#x27;s death might have resulted from autoerotic asphyxiation; this claim contradicted her previous statements to police investigators and the coroner.

===Memorial===
On 27 November 1997, Hutchence&#x27;s funeral was held at St Andrew&#x27;s Cathedral in Sydney and was attended by 600 people, including his family, bandmates, his last partner Paula Yates and their daughter, Hutchence&#x27;s favorite singer, Tom Jones, and also his ex-girlfriends Kylie Minogue and Helena Christensen. The funeral was broadcast live on Australian television. His casket was carried out of the cathedral by members of INXS and by his younger brother, Rhett; &quot;Never Tear Us Apart&quot; was played in the background. Nick Cave, a friend of Hutchence&#x27;s, performed his 1997 song &quot;Into My Arms&quot; during the funeral and requested that television cameras be switched off. Hutchence&#x27;s parents asked that in lieu of flowers, donations should be sent to UNICEF and the Starlight Foundation. Rhett claimed in his 2004 book, &quot;Total XS&quot;, that on the previous day at the funeral home, Yates had put a gram of heroin into Michael&#x27;s pocket.

Hutchence was cremated and his ashes were divided into thirds between his parents, his siblings, Yates and their daughter, following a battle between his family and Yates that started over Hutchence&#x27;s wish to be cremated. The portion that went to his mother was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Hollywood Hills, California. The portion that went to his father was scattered into Sydney Harbour, in Rose Bay, on what would have been Hutchence&#x27;s 38th birthday, on 22 January 1998, and a tombstone was placed at Northern Suburbs Memorial Gardens in North Ryde, Sydney. Yates kept her portion of Hutchence&#x27;s ashes in a cushion she slept with.

==Legacy==
After Hutchence&#x27;s death, INXS continued recording and performing until 2012. According to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), INXS has sold 15 million units in the United States alone. As of 2018, INXS has sold over 50 million records worldwide. INXS was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in 2001.

Hutchence&#x27;s solo album, &quot;Michael Hutchence&quot;, was released in October 1999. He had started on the album in 1995, recording songs in between INXS sessions; he had last worked on it three days before his death. The last song he recorded was &quot;Possibilities&quot;. The album includes &quot;Slide Away&quot;, a duet with U2&#x27;s Bono; Bono&#x27;s vocals were recorded after Hutchence&#x27;s death. The 1999 movie &quot;Limp&quot; includes a cameo by Hutchence.

On 18 June 2000, Hutchence&#x27;s mother Patricia Glassop and his sister Tina Hutchence released their book, &quot;Just a Man: The Real Michael Hutchence&quot;, which has been described as &quot;an odd biography ... [that] combines the basic facts of Hutchence&#x27;s early life ... with an almost too-intimate view of the authors&#x27; feelings&quot;.

On 20 August 2005, Melbourne&#x27;s &quot;The Age&quot; reported on the disposition of Hutchence&#x27;s estate and assets, which, although estimated at between $10 million and $20 million, amounted to virtually nothing. The remainder of his estate had reportedly been sold off or swallowed in legal fees.

A documentary about Hutchence, &quot;Michael Hutchence: The Last Rockstar&quot;, aired on Australia&#x27;s Channel 7 in 2017. In 2019, &quot;&quot;—another documentary about Hutchence&#x27;s life directed by Richard Lowenstein—was released.

==Tributes and dedications==
* In 1997, Duran Duran wrote the song &quot;Michael You&#x27;ve Got a Lot to Answer For&quot;. The song appeared on their album &quot;Medazzaland&quot;. Lead singer Simon Le Bon told Q magazine that the song, released shortly before Hutchence&#x27;s death, was about &quot;Michael being a naughty boy ... when he was living with Paula Yates. He did like his substances.&quot;
* Nick Cave sang &quot;Into My Arms&quot; at Hutchence&#x27;s funeral on 27 November 1997. The funeral was broadcast live on Australian TV. Out of respect, Cave requested the song not be televised.
* Terri Nunn of Berlin and Billy Corgan collaborated on &quot;Sacred and Profane&quot; for Berlin&#x27;s 2000 album &quot;Live: Sacred &amp; Profane&quot;. Nunn said, &quot;The song is about my first experience seeing [Hutchence] because that changed my life. He influenced me probably more than anyone else as a performer. I became 12 years old in five minutes wanting to have sex with him. That&#x27;s all I wanted! Oh my God. Everybody did! You just wanted him. He was the epitome of [a] rock star.&quot;
* Bono, a close friend of Hutchence, wrote &quot;Stuck in a Moment You Can&#x27;t Get Out Of&quot; on the 2000 U2 album &quot;All That You Can&#x27;t Leave Behind&quot;. The song is written in the form of an argument about suicide in which he tries to convince Hutchence of its foolishness. Bono characterised the song as a good old row between friends, adding that he felt guilty for never having had it with Hutchence in real life. In a 2005 interview, Bono regretted that he had not spent more time with Hutchence. Bono&#x27;s wife, Alison Hewson, had seen Hutchence before his death and noted &quot;he looked a bit shaky to [her]&quot;.
* On 23 November 2019, U2 paid tribute to Hutchence in Sydney, Australia, on their Joshua Tree Tour.

<text>The Motorola 68000 (sometimes shortened to Motorola 68k or m68k and usually pronounced &quot;sixty-eight-thousand&quot;) is a 16/32-bit complex instruction set computer (CISC) microprocessor, introduced in 1979 by Motorola Semiconductor Products Sector.

The design implements a 32-bit instruction set, with 32-bit registers and a 16-bit internal data bus. The address bus is 24 bits and does not use memory segmentation, which made it easier to program for. Internally, it uses a 16-bit data arithmetic logic unit (ALU) and two more 16-bit ALUs used mostly for addresses, and has a 16-bit external data bus. For this reason, Motorola termed it a 16/32-bit processor.

As one of the first widely available processors with a 32-bit instruction set, large unsegmented address space, and relatively high speed for the era, the 68k was a popular design through the 1980s. It was widely used in a new generation of personal computers with graphical user interfaces, including the Macintosh 128K, Amiga, Atari ST, and X68000. The Sega Genesis/Mega Drive console, released in 1988, is also powered by the 68000.

Later processors in the Motorola 68000 series, beginning with the Motorola 68020, use full 32-bit ALUs and have full 32-bit address and data buses, speeding up 32-bit operations and allowing 32-bit addressing, rather than the 24-bit addressing of the 68000 and 68010 or the 31-bit addressing of the Motorola 68012. The original 68k is generally software forward-compatible with the rest of the line despite being limited to a 16-bit wide external bus.


After in production, the 68000 architecture is still in use.

==Development==

===6800===

Motorola&#x27;s first widely produced microprocessor was the 6800, introduced in early 1974 and available in quantity late that year. The company set itself the goal of selling 25,000 units by September 1976, a goal they did meet. Although a capable design, it was eclipsed by more powerful designs, such as the Zilog Z80, and less expensive designs, such as the MOS Technology 6502. By late 1976, the sales book was flat and the division was only saved by a project for General Motors that turned into a huge product line for engine control and other tasks.

===Moving to 16-bit===
By the time the 6800 was introduced, a small number of 16-bit designs had come to market. These were generally modeled on minicomputer platforms like the Data General Nova or PDP-8. Based on the semiconductor manufacturing processes of the era, these were often multi-chip solutions like the National Semiconductor IMP-16, or the single-chip PACE that had issues with speed.

With the sales prospects for the 6800 dimming, but still cash-flush from the engine control sales, in late 1976 Colin Crook, Operations Manager, began considering how to successfully win future sales. They were aware that Intel was working on a 16-bit extension of their 8080 series, which would emerge as the Intel 8086, and had heard rumors of a 16-bit Zilog Z80, which became the Z8000. These would use new design techniques that would eliminate the problems seen in earlier 16-bit systems.

Motorola knew that if they launched a product similar to the 8086, within 10% of its capabilities, Intel would outperform them in the market. In order to compete, they set themselves the goal of being two times as powerful at the same cost, or one-half the cost with the same performance. Crook decided that they would attack the high-end of the market with the most powerful processor on the market. Another 16-bit would not do, their design would have to be bigger, and that meant having some 32-bit features. Crook had decided on this approach by the end of 1976.

===MACSS===
Crook formed the Motorola Advanced Computer System on Silicon (MACSS) project to build the design and hired Tom Gunter to be its principal architect. Gunter began forming his team in January 1977. The performance goal was set at 1 million instructions per second (MIPS). They wanted the design to not only win back microcomputer vendors like Apple Computer and Tandy, but also minicomputer companies like NCR and AT&amp;T.

The team decided to abandon an attempt at backward compatibility with the 6800, as they felt the 8-bit designs were too limited to be the basis for new designs. The new system was influenced by the PDP-11, the most popular minicomputer design of the era. At the time, a key concept in minis was the concept of an orthogonal instruction set, in which every operation was allowed to work on any sort of data. To feed the correct data into the internal units, MACSS made extensive use of microcode, essentially small programs in read only memory that gathered up the required data, performed the operations and wrote out the results. MACSS was among the first to use this technique in a microprocessor.

There was a large amount of support hardware for the 6800 that would remain useful, things like UARTs and similar interfacing systems. For this reason, the new design retained a bus protocol compatibility mode for existing 6800 peripheral devices.

A chip with 32 data and 32 addressing pins would require 64 pins, plus more for power and other features. At the time, 64-pin dual inline package (DIP)s were &quot;large, heavy-cost&quot; systems and &quot;just terrible&quot;, making that the largest they could consider. To make it fit, Crook selected a hybrid design, with a 32-bit instruction set architecture (ISA) but 16-bit components implementing it, like the arithmetic logic unit (ALU). The external interface was reduced to 16 data pins and 24 for addresses, allowing it all to fit in a 64-pin package. This became known as the &quot;Texas Cockroach&quot;.

By the mid-1970s, Motorola&#x27;s MOS design techniques had become less advanced than their competition, and their fabrication lines at times struggled with low yields. By the late-1970s, the company had entered a technology exchange program with Hitachi, dramatically improving their production capabilities. As part of this, a new fab named MOS-8 was built using the latest 5-inch wafer sizes and Intel&#x27;s HMOS process with a 3.5 μm feature size. This was an investment aimed at catching the competition: even upstart semiconductor companies such as Zilog and MOS Technology had introduced CPUs fabricated on depletion-mode NMOS logic before Motorola did. In fact, Motorola may have substantially lagged contemporaries in phasing out enhancement mode and metal gate, with Gunter recollecting that the 68000 itself had to succeed despite initially adopting a metal-gate design. Though the point about playing catch-up is clear, this could not have been an entirely accurate summary because Motorola&#x27;s 1976 datasheets, predating the inception of the MACCS project, denote the majority of its 6800 family in silicon-gate. Indeed, Gunter&#x27;s own 1979 article introducing the 68000 highlighted it as a silicon-gate depletion-mode HMOS design. Whatever the degree of Motorola&#x27;s process and manufacturing deficits in the early days, the team was undeterred and would not compromise in its pursuit of a microprocessor with industry-leading performance.

===Sampling and production===
Formally introduced in September 1979, initial samples were released in February 1980, with production chips available over the counter in November. Initial speed grades were 4, 6, and 8 MHz. 10 MHz chips became available during 1981, and 12.5 MHz chips by June 1982. The 16.67 MHz &quot;12F&quot; version of the MC68000, the fastest version of the original HMOS chip, was not produced until the late 1980s.

By the start of 1981, the 68k was winning orders in the high end, and Gunter began to approach Apple to win their business. At that time, the 68k sold for about $125 in quantity. In meetings with Steve Jobs, Jobs talked about using the 68k in the Apple Lisa, but stated &quot;the real future is in this product that I&#x27;m personally doing. If you want this business, you got to commit that you&#x27;ll sell it for $15.&quot; Motorola countered by offering to sell it at $55 at first, then step down to $35, and so on. Jobs agreed, and the Macintosh moved from the 6809 to the 68k. The average price eventually reached $14.76.

==Variants==
In 1982, the 68000 received a minor update to its instruction set architecture (ISA) to support virtual memory and to conform to the Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements. The updated chip is called the 68010. It also adds a new &quot;loop mode&quot; which speeds up small loops, and increases overall performance by about 10% at the same clock speeds. A further extended version, which exposes 31 bits of the address bus, was also produced in small quantities as the 68012.

To support lower-cost systems and control applications with smaller memory sizes, Motorola introduced the 8-bit compatible MC68008, also in 1982. This is a 68000 with an 8-bit data bus and a smaller (20-bit) address bus. After 1982, Motorola devoted more attention to the 68020 and 88000 projects.

===Second-sourcing===

Several other companies were second-source manufacturers of the HMOS 68000. These included Hitachi (HD68000), who shrank the feature size to 2.7 μm for their 12.5 MHz version, Mostek (MK68000), Rockwell (R68000), Signetics (SCN68000), Thomson/SGS-Thomson (originally EF68000 and later TS68000), and Toshiba (TMP68000). Toshiba was also a second-source maker of the CMOS 68HC000 (TMP68HC000).

Encrypted variants of the 68000, being the Hitachi FD1089 and FD1094, store decryption keys for opcodes and opcode data in battery-backed memory and were used in certain Sega arcade systems including System 16 to prevent piracy and illegal bootleg games.

===CMOS versions===
The 68HC000, the first CMOS version of the 68000, was designed by Hitachi and jointly introduced in 1985. Motorola&#x27;s version is called the MC68HC000, while Hitachi&#x27;s is the HD68HC000. The 68HC000 offers speeds of 8–20 MHz. Except for using CMOS circuitry, it behaved identically to the HMOS MC68000, but the change to CMOS greatly reduced its power consumption. The original HMOS MC68000 consumed around 1.35 watts at an ambient temperature of 25 °C, regardless of clock speed, while the MC68HC000 consumed only 0.13 watts at 8 MHz and 0.38 watts at 20 MHz. (Unlike CMOS circuits, HMOS still draws power when idle, so power consumption varies little with clock rate.) Apple selected the 68HC000 for use in the Macintosh Portable. In 2024, Rochester Electronics was licensed by NXP to continue to produce the MC68HC000. Both the physical design and test program were transferred to Rochester from NXP to continue to supply an authorized source to the market. The Rochester Electronics version of the 68HC000 is a product clone of the J82M mask set which was the last mask set used by Motorola. 

Motorola replaced the MC68008 with the MC68HC001 in 1990. This chip resembles the 68HC000 in most respects, but its data bus can operate in either 16-bit or 8-bit mode, depending on the value of an input pin at reset. Thus, like the 68008, it can be used in systems with cheaper 8-bit memories.

The later evolution of the 68000 focused on more modern embedded control applications and on-chip peripherals. The 68EC000 chip and SCM68000 core remove the M6800 peripheral bus, and exclude the MOVE from SR instruction from user mode programs, making the 68EC000 and 68SEC000 the only 68000 CPUs not 100% object code compatible with previous 68000 CPUs when run in User Mode. When run in Supervisor Mode, there is no difference. In 1996, Motorola updated the standalone core with fully static circuitry, drawing only 2 μW in low-power mode, calling it the MC68SEC000.

Motorola ceased production of the HMOS MC68000, as well as the MC68008, MC68010, MC68330, and MC68340 in on June 1, 1996, but its spin-off company Freescale Semiconductor was still producing the MC68HC000, MC68HC001, MC68EC000, and MC68SEC000, as well as the MC68302 and MC68306 microcontrollers and later versions of the DragonBall family. The 68000&#x27;s architectural descendants, the 680x0, CPU32, and Coldfire families, were also still in production. More recently, with the Sendai fab closure, all 68HC000, 68020, 68030, and 68882 parts have been discontinued, leaving only the 68SEC000 in production.

===As a microcontroller core===
Since being succeeded by &quot;true&quot; 32-bit microprocessors, the 68000 is used as the core of many microcontrollers. In 1989, Motorola introduced the MC68302 communications processor.

==Applications==
IBM considered the 68000 for the IBM PC but chose the Intel 8088; however, IBM Instruments briefly sold the 68000-based IBM System 9000 laboratory computer systems. The 68k instruction set is particularly well suited to implement Unix, and the 68000 and its successors became the dominant CPUs for Unix-based workstations including Sun workstations and Apollo/Domain workstations.

In 1981, Motorola introduced the Motorola 68000 Educational Computer Board, a single-board computer for educational and training purposes which in addition to the 68000 itself contained memory, I/O devices, programmable timer and wire-wrap area for custom circuitry. The board remained in use in US colleges as a tool for learning assembly programming until the early 1990s.

At its introduction, the 68000 was first used in high-priced systems, including multiuser microcomputers like the WICAT 150, early Alpha Microsystems computers, Sage II / IV, Tandy 6000 / TRS-80 Model 16, and Fortune 32:16; single-user workstations such as Hewlett-Packard&#x27;s HP 9000 Series 200 systems, the first Apollo/Domain systems, Sun Microsystems&#x27; Sun-1, and the Corvus Concept; and graphics terminals like Digital Equipment Corporation&#x27;s VAXstation 100 and Silicon Graphics&#x27; IRIS 1000 and 1200. Unix systems rapidly moved to the more capable later generations of the 68k line, which remained popular in that market throughout the 1980s.

By the mid-1980s, falling production cost made the 68000 viable for use in personal computers starting with the Apple Lisa and Macintosh, and followed by the Amiga, Atari ST, and X68000.

The Sinclair QL microcomputer, along with its derivatives, such as the ICL One Per Desk business terminal, was the most commercially important utilisation of the 68008. Helix Systems (in Missouri, United States) designed an extension to the SWTPC SS-50 bus, the SS-64, and produced systems built around the 68008 processor. 68000 and 68008 second processors were released for the BBC Micro in 1984 and 1985 respectively, and according to Steve Furber contributed to Acorn developing the ARM.

While the adoption of RISC and x86 displaced the 68000 series as desktop/workstation CPU, the processor found substantial use in embedded applications. By the early 1990s, quantities of 68000 CPUs could be purchased for less than 30 USD per part.

The 68000 also saw great success as an embedded controller. As early as 1981, laser printers such as the Imagen Imprint-10 were controlled by external boards equipped with the 68000. The first HP LaserJet, introduced in 1984, came with a built-in 8 MHz 68000. Other printer manufacturers adopted the 68000, including Apple with its introduction of the LaserWriter in 1985, the first PostScript laser printer. The 68000 continued to be widely used in printers throughout the rest of the 1980s, persisting well into the 1990s in low-end printers.

The 68000 was successful in the field of industrial control systems. Among the systems benefited from having a 68000 or derivative as their microprocessor were families of programmable logic controllers (PLCs) manufactured by Allen-Bradley, Texas Instruments and subsequently, following the acquisition of that division of TI, by Siemens. Users of such systems do not accept product obsolescence at the same rate as domestic users, and it is entirely likely that despite having been installed over 20 years ago, many 68000-based controllers will continue in reliable service well into the 21st century.

In a number of digital oscilloscopes from the 80s, the 68000 has been used as a waveform display processor; some models including the LeCroy 9400/9400A also use the 68000 as a waveform math processor (including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of two waveforms/references/waveform memories), and some digital oscilloscopes using the 68000 (including the 9400/9400A) can also perform fast Fourier transform functions on a waveform.

The 683XX microcontrollers, based on the 68000 architecture, are used in networking and telecom equipment, television set-top boxes, laboratory and medical instruments, and even handheld calculators. The MC68302 and its derivatives have been used in many telecom products from Cisco, 3com, Ascend, Marconi, Cyclades and others. Past models of the Palm PDAs and the Handspring Visor used the DragonBall, a derivative of the 68000. AlphaSmart used the DragonBall family in later versions of its portable word processors. Texas Instruments used the 68000 in its high-end graphing calculators, the TI-89 and TI-92 series and Voyage 200.

A modified version of the 68000 formed the basis of the IBM XT/370 hardware emulator of the System 370 processor.

===Video games===
Video game manufacturers used the 68000 as the backbone of many arcade games and home game consoles: Atari&#x27;s &quot;Food Fight&quot;, from 1982, was one of the first 68000-based arcade games. Others included Sega&#x27;s System 16, Capcom&#x27;s CP System and CPS-2, and SNK&#x27;s Neo Geo. By the late 1980s, the 68000 was inexpensive enough to power home game consoles, such as Sega&#x27;s Genesis console, and also the Sega CD attachment for it (a Sega CD system has three CPUs, two of them 68000s.) The 68000 is also the CPU of the Sega Pico, a young children&#x27;s educational game console. The multi-processor Atari Jaguar console from 1993 used a 68000 as a support chip, although, due to familiarity, some developers used it as the primary processor. The 1994 Sega Saturn console used the 68000 as a sound co-processor. In October 1995, the 68000 made it into a handheld game console, Sega&#x27;s Genesis Nomad, as its CPU.

Certain arcade games (such as &quot;Steel Gunner&quot; and others based on Namco System 2) use a dual 68000 CPU configuration, and systems with a triple 68000 CPU configuration also exist (such as &quot;Galaxy Force&quot; and others based on the Sega Y Board), along with a quad 68000 CPU configuration, which has been used by Jaleco (one 68000 for sound has a lower clock rate compared to the other 68000 CPUs) for games such as &quot;Big Run&quot; and &quot;Cisco Heat&quot;; another, fifth 68000 (at a different clock rate than the other 68000 CPUs) was used in the Jaleco arcade game &quot;Wild Pilot&quot; for input/output (I/O) processing.

==Architecture==
===Address bus===
The 68000 has a 24-bit external address bus and two byte-select signals &quot;replaced&quot; A0. These 24 lines can therefore address 16 MB of physical memory with byte resolution. Address storage and computation uses 32 bits internally; however, the 8 high-order address bits are ignored due to the physical lack of device pins. This allows it to run software written for a logically flat 32-bit address space, while accessing only a 24-bit physical address space. Motorola&#x27;s intent with the internal 32-bit address space was forward compatibility, making it feasible to write 68000 software that would take full advantage of later 32-bit implementations of the 68000 instruction set.

However, this did not prevent programmers from writing forward incompatible software. &quot;24-bit&quot; software that discarded the upper address byte, or used it for purposes other than addressing, could fail on 32-bit 68000 implementations. For example, early (pre-7.0) versions of Apple&#x27;s Mac OS used the high byte of memory-block master pointers to hold flags such as &quot;locked&quot; and &quot;purgeable&quot;. Later versions of the OS moved the flags to a nearby location, and Apple began shipping computers which had &quot;32-bit clean&quot; ROMs beginning with the release of the 1989 Mac IIci.

The 68000 family stores multi-byte integers in memory in big-endian order.

===Internal registers===
The CPU has eight 32-bit general-purpose data registers (D0-D7), and eight address registers (A0-A7). The last address register is the stack pointer, and assemblers accept the label SP as equivalent to A7. This was a good number of registers at the time in many ways. It was small enough to allow the 68000 to respond quickly to interrupts (even in the worst case where all 8 data registers D0–D7 and 7 address registers A0–A6 needed to be saved, 15 registers in total), and yet large enough to make most calculations fast, because they could be done entirely within the processor without keeping any partial results in memory. (Note that an exception routine in supervisor mode can also save the user stack pointer A7, which would total 8 address registers. However, the dual stack pointer (A7 and supervisor-mode A7&#x27;) design of the 68000 makes this normally unnecessary, except when a task switch is performed in a multitasking system.)

Having the two types of registers allows one 32-bit address and one 16-bit data calculation to take place at the same time. This results in reduced instruction execution time as addresses and data can be processed in parallel.

===Status register===
The 68000 has a 16-bit status register. The upper 8 bits is the system byte, and modification of it is privileged. The lower 8 bits is the user byte, also known as the condition code register (CCR), and modification of it is not privileged. The 68000 comparison, arithmetic, and logic operations modify condition codes to record their results for use by later conditional jumps. The condition code bits are &quot;carry&quot; (C), &quot;overflow&quot; (V), &quot;zero&quot; (Z), &quot;negative&quot; (N) and &quot;extend&quot; (X). The &quot;extend&quot; (X) flag deserves special mention, because it is separate from the carry flag. This permits the extra bit from arithmetic, logic, and shift operations to be separated from the carry multiprecision arithmetic.

===Instruction set===
The designers attempted to make the assembly language orthogonal. That is, instructions are divided into operations and address modes, and almost all address modes are available for almost all instructions. There are 56 instructions and a minimum instruction size of 16 bits. Many instructions and addressing modes are longer to include more address or mode bits.

===Privilege levels===
The CPU, and later the whole family, implements two levels of privilege. User mode gives access to everything except privileged instructions such as interrupt level controls. Supervisor privilege gives access to everything. An interrupt always becomes supervisory. The supervisor bit is stored in the status register, and is visible to user programs.

An advantage of this system is that the supervisor level has a separate stack pointer. This permits a multitasking system to use very small stacks for tasks, because the designers do not have to allocate the memory required to hold the stack frames of a maximum stack-up of interrupts.

===Interrupts===
The CPU recognizes seven interrupt levels. Levels 1 through 5 are strictly prioritized. That is, a higher-numbered interrupt can always interrupt a lower-numbered interrupt. In the status register, a privileged instruction allows setting the current minimum interrupt level, blocking lower or equal priority interrupts. For example, if the interrupt level in the status register is set to 3, higher levels from 4 to 7 can cause an exception. Level 7 is a level triggered non-maskable interrupt (NMI). Level 1 can be interrupted by any higher level. Level 0 means no interrupt. The level is stored in the status register, and is visible to user-level programs.

Hardware interrupts are signalled to the CPU using three inputs that encode the highest pending interrupt priority. A separate encoder is usually required to encode the interrupts, though for systems that do not require more than three hardware interrupts it is possible to connect the interrupt signals directly to the encoded inputs at the cost of more software complexity. The interrupt controller can be as simple as a 74LS148 priority encoder, or may be part of a very large-scale integration (VLSI) peripheral chip such as the MC68901 Multi-Function Peripheral (used in the Atari ST range of computers and X68000), which also provides a UART, timer, and parallel I/O.

The &quot;exception table&quot; (interrupt vector table interrupt vector addresses) is fixed at addresses 0 through 1023, permitting 256 32-bit vectors. The first vector (RESET) consists of two vectors, namely the starting stack address, and the starting code address. Vectors 3 through 15 are used to report various errors: bus error, address error, illegal instruction, zero division, CHK and CHK2 vector, privilege violation (to block privilege escalation), and some reserved vectors that became line 1010 emulator, line 1111 emulator, and hardware breakpoint. Vector 24 starts the real interrupts: spurious interrupt (no hardware acknowledgement), and level 1 through level 7 autovectors, then the 16 TRAP vectors, then some more reserved vectors, then the user defined vectors.

Since the starting code address vector must always be valid on reset, systems commonly included some nonvolatile memory (e.g. ROM) starting at address zero to contain the vectors and bootstrap code. However, for a general purpose system it is desirable for the operating system to be able to change the vectors at runtime. This was often accomplished by either pointing the vectors in ROM to a jump table in RAM, or through use of bank switching to allow the ROM to be replaced by RAM at runtime.

The 68000 does not meet the Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements for full processor virtualization because it has a single unprivileged instruction, &quot;MOVE from SR&quot;, which allows user-mode software read-only access to a small amount of privileged state. The 68EC000 and 68SEC000, which are later derivatives of the 68000, do meet the requirements as the &quot;MOVE from SR&quot; instruction is privileged. The same change was introduced on the 68010 and later CPUs.

The 68000 is also unable to easily support virtual memory, which requires the ability to trap and recover from a failed memory access. The 68000 does provide a bus error exception which can be used to trap, but it does not save enough processor state to resume the faulted instruction once the operating system has handled the exception. Several companies did succeed in making 68000-based Unix workstations with virtual memory that worked by using two 68000 chips running in parallel on different phased clocks. When the &quot;leading&quot; 68000 encountered a bad memory access, extra hardware would interrupt the &quot;main&quot; 68000 to prevent it from also encountering the bad memory access. This interrupt routine would handle the virtual memory functions and restart the &quot;leading&quot; 68000 in the correct state to continue properly synchronized operation when the &quot;main&quot; 68000 returned from the interrupt.

These problems were fixed in the next major revision of the 68k architecture with the release of the MC68010. The Bus Error and Address Error exceptions push a large amount of internal state onto the supervisor stack in order to facilitate recovery, and the &quot;MOVE from SR&quot; instruction was made privileged. A new unprivileged &quot;MOVE from CCR&quot; instruction is provided for use in its place by user mode software; an operating system can trap and emulate user mode &quot;MOVE from SR&quot; instructions if desired.

==Instruction set details==
The standard addressing modes are:

*Register direct
**data register, e.g. &quot;D0&quot;
**address register, e.g. &quot;A0&quot;
*Register indirect
**Simple address, e.g. (A0)
**Address with post-increment, e.g. (A0)+
**Address with pre-decrement, e.g. −(A0)
**Address with a 16-bit signed offset, e.g. 16(A0)
**Register indirect with index register &amp; 8-bit signed offset e.g. 8(A0,D0) or 8(A0,A1)
*:Note that for (A0)+ and −(A0), the actual increment or decrement value is dependent on the operand size: a byte access adjusts the address register by 1, a word by 2, and a long by 4.
*PC (program counter) relative with displacement
**Relative 16-bit signed offset, e.g. 16(PC). This mode was very useful for position-independent code.
**Relative with 8-bit signed offset with index, e.g. 8(PC,D2)
*Absolute memory location
**Either a number, e.g. &quot;$4000&quot;, or a symbolic name translated by the assembler
**Most 68000 assemblers used the &quot;$&quot; symbol for hexadecimal, instead of &quot;0x&quot; or a trailing H.
**There are 16 and 32-bit versions of this addressing mode
*Immediate mode
**Data stored in the instruction, e.g. &quot;#400&quot;
*Quick immediate mode
**3-bit unsigned (or 8-bit signed with moveq) with value stored in opcode
**In addq and subq, 0 is the equivalent to 8
**e.g. moveq #0,d0 was quicker than clr.l d0 (though both made D0 equal to 0)

Plus: access to the status register, and, in later models, other special registers.

Most instructions have variants that operate on 8-bit bytes, 16-bit words, and 32-bit longs; assembler languages use dot-letter suffixes &quot;.b&quot;, &quot;.w&quot;, and &quot;.l&quot; after the instruction mnemonic to indicate the variant.

Like many CPUs of its era the cycle timing of some instructions varied depending on the source operand(s). For example, the unsigned multiply instruction takes (38+2n) clock cycles to complete where &#x27;n&#x27; is equal to the number of bits set in the operand. To create a function that took a fixed cycle count required the addition of extra code after the multiply instruction. This would typically consume extra cycles for each bit that wasn&#x27;t set in the original multiplication operand.

Most instructions are , that is, the operation has a source, and a destination, and the destination is changed. Notable instructions are:

*Arithmetic: ADD, SUB, MULU (unsigned multiply), MULS (signed multiply), DIVU (unsigned divide), DIVS (signed divide), NEG (additive negation), and CMP (comparison, done by subtracting the arguments and setting the status bits without storing the result)
*Binary-coded decimal arithmetic: ABCD, NBCD, and SBCD
*Logic: EOR (exclusive or), AND, NOT (logical not), OR (inclusive or)
*Shifting: (logical, i.e. right shifts put zero in the most-significant bit) LSL, LSR, (arithmetic shifts, i.e. sign-extend the most-significant bit) ASR, ASL, (rotates through eXtend and not) ROXL, ROXR, ROL, ROR
*Bit test and manipulation in memory or data register: BSET (set to 1), BCLR (clear to 0), BCHG (invert) and BTST (no change). All of these instructions first test the destination bit and set (clear) the CCR Z bit if the destination bit is 0 (1), respectively.
*Multiprocessing control: TAS, test-and-set, performed an indivisible bus operation, permitting semaphores to be used to synchronize several processors sharing a single memory
*Flow of control: JMP (jump), JSR (jump to subroutine), BSR (relative address jump to subroutine), RTS (return from subroutine), RTE (return from exception, i.e. an interrupt), TRAP (trigger a software exception similar to software interrupt), CHK (a conditional software exception)
*Branch: Bcc (where the &quot;cc&quot; specified one of 14 tests of the condition codes in the status register: equal, greater than, less-than, carry, and most combinations and logical inversions, available from the status register). The remaining two possible conditions (always true and always false) have separate instruction mnemonics, BRA (branch always), and BSR (branch to subroutine). 
*Decrement-and-branch: DBcc (where &quot;cc&quot; was as for the branch instructions), which, provided the condition was false, decremented the low word of a D-register and, if the result was not -1 ($FFFF), branched to a destination. This use of −1 instead of 0 as the terminating value allowed the easy coding of loops that had to do nothing if the count was 0 to start with, with no need for another check before entering the loop. This also facilitated nesting of DBcc.

==68EC000==
The 68EC000 is a low-cost version of the 68000 with a slightly different pinout, designed for embedded controller applications. The 68EC000 can have either a 8-bit or 16-bit data bus, switchable at reset.

The processors are available in a variety of speeds including 8 and 16 MHz configurations, producing 2,100 and 4,376 Dhrystones each. These processors have no floating-point unit, and it is difficult to implement an FPU coprocessor (MC68881/2) with one because the EC series lacks necessary coprocessor instructions.

The 68EC000 was used as a controller in many audio applications, including Ensoniq musical instruments and sound cards, where it was part of the MIDI synthesizer. On Ensoniq sound boards, the controller provided several advantages compared to competitors without a CPU on board. The processor allowed the board to be configured to perform various audio tasks, such as MPU-401 MIDI synthesis or MT-32 emulation, without the use of a terminate-and-stay-resident program. This improved software compatibility, lowered CPU usage, and eliminated host system memory usage.

The Motorola 68EC000 core was later used in the m68k-based DragonBall processors from Motorola/Freescale.

It also was used as a sound controller in the Sega Saturn game console and as a controller for the HP JetDirect Ethernet controller boards for the mid-1990s HP LaserJet printers.

==Example code==
The 68000 assembly code below is for a subroutine named , which copies a null-terminated string of 8-bit characters to a destination string, converting all alphabetic characters to lower case.


The subroutine establishes a call frame using register A6 as the frame pointer. This kind of calling convention supports reentrant and recursive code and is typically used by languages like C and C++. The subroutine then retrieves the parameters passed to it ( and ) from the stack. It then loops, reading an ASCII character (one byte) from the string, checking whether it is a capital alphabetic character, and if so, converting it into a lower-case character, otherwise leaving it as it is, then writing the character into the string. Finally, it checks whether the character was a null character; if not, it repeats the loop, otherwise it restores the previous stack frame (and A6 register) and returns. Note that the string pointers (registers A0 and A1) are auto-incremented in each iteration of the loop.
In contrast, the code below is for a stand-alone function, even on the most restrictive version of AMS for the TI-89 series of calculators, being kernel-independent, with no values looked up in tables, files or libraries when executing, no system calls, no exception processing, minimal registers to be used, nor the need to save any. It is valid for historical Julian dates from 1 March 1 AD, or for Gregorian ones. In less than two dozen operations it calculates a day number compatible with ISO 8601 when called with three inputs stored at their corresponding LOCATIONS:
 ; WDN, an address - for storing result d0
 ; FLAG, 0 or 2 - to choose between Julian or Gregorian, respectively
 ; DATE, year0mda - date stamp as binary word&amp;byte&amp;byte in basic ISO-format
 ;(YEAR, year ~ YEAR=DATE due to big-endianness)
 
 ;
 ; Apply step 1 - Lachman&#x27;s congruence
 
 
 ;
 ; Apply step 2 - Finding spqr as the year of the Julian leap day preceding DATE
 
 
 
 
 ; (Apply step 0 - Gregorian adjustment)
 
 
 
 
 ;
 
 ; Days of the week correspond to day numbers of the week as:
 ; Sun=0 Mon=1 Tue=2 Wed=3 Thu=4 Fri=5 Sat=6

<text>A minicomputer, or colloquially mini, is a type of general-purpose computer mostly developed from the mid-1960s, built significantly smaller and sold at a much lower price than mainframe and mid-size computers from IBM and its direct competitors. By 21st century-standards however, a mini is an exceptionally large machine. Minicomputers in the traditional technical sense covered here are only small relative to generally even earlier and much bigger machines.

The class formed a distinct group with its own software architectures and operating systems. Minis were designed for control, instrumentation, human interaction, and communication switching, as distinct from calculation and record keeping. Many were sold indirectly to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) for final end-use application. During the two-decade lifetime of the minicomputer class (1965–1985), almost 100 minicomputer vendor companies formed. Only a half-dozen remained by the mid-1980s.

When single-chip CPU microprocessors appeared in the 1970s, the definition of &quot;minicomputer&quot; subtly shifted: the word came to mean a machine in the middle range of the computing spectrum, between mainframe computers and microcomputers. The easily-misunderstood term &quot;minicomputer&quot; is less often applied to later like systems; a near-synonymous (IBM-adjacent) expert term for this class of system is &quot;midrange computer&quot;. Non-experts however have begun to apply the &quot;minicomputer&quot; label to credit card-sized single-board computers (q.v.).

==History==
===Definition===

The term &quot;minicomputer&quot; developed in the 1960s to describe the smaller computers that became possible with the use of transistors and core memory technologies, minimal instructions sets and less expensive peripherals such as the ubiquitous Teletype Model 33 ASR. They usually took up one or a few 19-inch rack cabinets, compared with the large mainframes that could fill a room. Later minicomputers tended to be more compact, and while still distinct in terms of architecture and function, some models eventually shrunk to a similar size as large microcomputers.

In terms of relative computing power compared to contemporary mainframes, small systems that were similar to minicomputers had been available from the 1950s. In particular, there was an entire class of compact vacuum tube-based drum machines, such as the UNIVAC 1101 (1950), and the Bendix G-15 and LGP-30 (both 1956), all of which shared some features of the minicomputer class. Similar models using magnetic delay-line memory followed in the early 1960s. These machines, however, were essentially designed as small mainframes, using a custom chassis and often supporting only peripherals from the same company. In contrast, the machines that became known as minicomputers were often designed to fit into a standard chassis and deliberately designed to use common devices such as the ASR 33.

Another common difference was that most earlier small machines were not &quot;general purpose&quot;, in that they were designed for a specific role such as process control or accounting. On these machines, programming was generally carried out in their custom machine language, or even hard-coded into a plugboard, although some used a form of &quot;BASIC&quot;. DEC wrote, regarding their PDP-5, that it was &quot;the world’s first commercially produced minicomputer&quot;. It meets most definitions of &quot;mini&quot; in terms of power and size, but was designed and built to be used as an instrumentation system in labs, not as a general-purpose computer. Many similar examples of small special-purpose machines exist from the early 1960s, including the UK Ferranti Argus and Soviet UM-1NKh.

The CDC 160, circa 1960, is sometimes pointed to as an early example of a minicomputer, as it was small, transistorized and (relatively) inexpensive. However, its basic price of $100,000 () and custom desk-like chassis places it within the &quot;small system&quot; or &quot;midrange computer&quot; category as opposed to the more modern use of the term minicomputer. Nevertheless, the CDC 160 remains a strong contender for the term &quot;first minicomputer&quot;, provided the earlier drum machines are excluded as non-transistorized.

=== 1960s and 1970s success ===
Most computing histories point to the 1964 introduction of Digital Equipment Corporation&#x27;s (DEC) 12-bit PDP-8 as the first minicomputer. Some of this is no doubt due to DEC&#x27;s widespread use of the term starting in the mid-1960s. Smaller systems, including those from DEC such as the PDP-5 and LINC, had existed prior to this point, but it was the PDP-8 combination of small size, general purpose orientation and low price that puts it firmly within the modern definition. Its introductory price of $18,500 () places it in an entirely different market segment than earlier examples such as the CDC 160.

In contemporary terms, the PDP-8 was a runaway success, ultimately selling 50,000 examples. Follow-on versions using small scale integrated circuits further lowered the cost and size of the system. Its success led to widespread imitation, and the creation of an entire industry of minicomputer companies along Massachusetts Route 128, including Data General, Wang Laboratories and Prime Computer. Other popular minis from the era were the HP 2100, Honeywell 316 and TI-990.
Early minis had a variety of word sizes, with DEC&#x27;s 12 and 18-bit systems being typical examples. The introduction and standardization of the 7-bit ASCII character set led to the move to 16-bit systems, with the late-1969 Data General Nova being a notable entry in this space. By the early 1970s, most minis were 16-bit, including DEC&#x27;s PDP-11. For a time, &quot;minicomputer&quot; was almost synonymous with &quot;16-bit&quot;, as the larger mainframe machines almost always used 32-bit or larger word sizes.
In a 1970 survey, &quot;The New York Times&quot; had suggested a consensus definition of a minicomputer as a machine costing less than (), with an input-output device such as a teleprinter and at least four thousand words of memory, that is capable of running programs in a higher level language, such as Fortran or BASIC.

As integrated circuit design improved, especially with the introduction of the 7400-series integrated circuits, minicomputers became smaller, easier to manufacture, and as a result, less expensive. They were used in manufacturing process control, telephone switching and to control laboratory equipment. In the 1970s, they were the hardware that was used to launch the computer-aided design (CAD) industry and other similar industries where a small dedicated system was needed.

The boom in worldwide seismic exploration for oil and gas in the early 1970s saw the widespread use of minicomputers in dedicated processing centres close to the data collection crews. Raytheon Data Systems RDS 704 and later RDS 500 were predominantly the systems of choice for nearly all the geophysical exploration as well as oil companies.

At the launch of the MITS Altair 8800 in 1975, &quot;Radio Electronics&quot; magazine referred to the system as a &quot;minicomputer&quot;, although the term microcomputer soon became usual for personal computers based on single-chip microprocessors. At the time, microcomputers were 8-bit single-user, relatively simple machines running simple program-launcher operating systems such as CP/M or MS-DOS, while minis were much more powerful systems that ran full multi-user, multitasking operating systems, such as VMS and Unix.

The Tandem Computers NonStop product line shipped its first fully fault-tolerant cluster computer in 1976.

Around the same time, minis began to move upward in size. Although several 24 and 32-bit minis had entered the market earlier, it was DEC&#x27;s 1977 VAX, which they referred to as a superminicomputer, or supermini, that caused the mini market to move en-masse to 32-bit architectures. This provided ample headroom even as single-chip 16-bit microprocessors such as the TMS 9900 and Zilog Z8000 appeared in the later 1970s. Most mini vendors introduced their own single-chip processors based on their own architecture and used these mostly in low-cost offerings while concentrating on their 32-bit systems. Examples include the Intersil 6100 single-chip PDP-8, DEC T-11 PDP-11, microNOVA and Fairchild 9440 Nova, and TMS9900 TI-990.

===Mid-1980s and 1990s decline===
By the early 1980s, the 16-bit minicomputer market had all but disappeared as newer 32-bit microprocessors began to improve in performance. Those customers who required more performance than these offered had generally already moved to 32-bit systems by this time. But it was not long before this market also began to come under threat; the Motorola 68000 offered a significant percentage of the performance of a typical mini in a desktop platform. True 32-bit processors such as the National Semiconductor NS32016, Motorola 68020 and Intel 80386 soon followed. By the mid-1980s, high-end microcomputers offered CPU performance equal to low-end and mid-range minis, and the new RISC approach promised performance levels well beyond the fastest minis, and even high-end mainframes.

All that really separated micros from the mini market was storage and memory capacity. Both of these began to be addressed through the later 1980s; 1 MB of RAM became typical by around 1987, desktop hard drives rapidly pushed past the 100 MB range by 1990, and the introduction of inexpensive and easily deployable local area network (LAN) systems provided solutions for those looking for multi-user systems. The introduction of workstations opened new markets for graphics-based systems that the terminal-oriented minis could not even address. Minis remained a force for those using existing software products or those who required high-performance multitasking, but the introduction of newer operating systems based on Unix began to yield highly practical replacements for these roles as well. For computational science, clusters of commodity PCs largely replaced minicomputers.

Mini vendors began to rapidly disappear through this period. Data General responded to the changing market by focusing entirely on the high-performance file server market, embracing a role within large LANs that appeared resilient. This did not last; Novell NetWare rapidly pushed such solutions into niche roles, and later versions of Microsoft Windows did the same to Novell. DEC decided to move into the large-computer space instead, introducing the VAX 9000 mainframe in 1989, but it was a flop in the market and disappeared after almost no sales. The company then attempted to enter the workstation and server markets with the DEC Alpha, but was too late to save the company, and they eventually sold their remains to Compaq in 1998. By the end of the decade all of the classic vendors were gone; Data General, Prime, Computervision, Honeywell, and Wang, failed, merged, or were bought out.

Today, only a few proprietary minicomputer architectures survive. The IBM System/38 operating system, which introduced many advanced concepts, lives on with IBM&#x27;s AS/400. Great efforts were made by IBM to enable programs originally written for the IBM System/34 and System/36 to be moved to the AS/400. After being rebranded multiple times, the AS/400 platform was replaced by IBM Power Systems running IBM i. In contrast, competing proprietary computing architectures from the early 1980s, such as DEC&#x27;s VAX, Wang VS, and Hewlett-Packard&#x27;s HP 3000 have long been discontinued without a compatible upgrade path. OpenVMS was ported to HP Alpha and Intel IA-64 (Itanium) CPU architectures, and now runs on x86-64 processors.

Tandem Computers, which specialized in reliable large-scale computing, was acquired by Compaq in 1997, and in 2001 the combined entity merged with Hewlett-Packard. The NonStop Kernel-based NonStop product line was re-ported from MIPS processors to Itanium-based processors branded as &#x27;HP Integrity NonStop Servers&#x27;. As in the earlier migration from stack machines to MIPS microprocessors, all customer software was carried forward without source changes. The NSK operating system, now termed NonStop OS, continues as the base software environment for the NonStop Servers, and has been extended to include support for Java and integration with popular development tools such as Visual Studio and Eclipse. Later, Hewlett-Packard would split into HP and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise. The NonStop products and the DEC products would then be sold by HPE.

===Industrial impact and heritage===
A variety of companies emerged that built turnkey systems around minicomputers with specialized software and, in many cases, custom peripherals that addressed specialized problems such as computer-aided design, computer-aided manufacturing, process control, manufacturing resource planning, and so on. Many if not most minicomputers were sold through these original equipment manufacturers and value-added resellers.

Several pioneering computer companies first built minicomputers, such as DEC, Data General, and Hewlett-Packard (HP) (who now refers to its HP3000 minicomputers as &quot;servers&quot; rather than &quot;minicomputers&quot;). And although today&#x27;s PCs and servers are clearly microcomputers physically, architecturally their CPUs and operating systems have developed largely by integrating features from minicomputers.

In the software context, the relatively simple OSs for early microcomputers were usually inspired by minicomputer OSs (such as CP/M&#x27;s similarity to Digital&#x27;s single user OS/8 and RT-11 and multi-user RSTS time-sharing system). Also, the multiuser OSs of today are often either inspired by, or directly descended from, minicomputer OSs. Unix was originally a minicomputer OS, while the Windows NT kernel, the foundation for all current versions of Microsoft Windows, borrowed design ideas liberally from VMS. Many of the first generation of PC programmers were educated on minicomputer systems.

<text>Mechanized infantry are infantry units equipped with armored personnel carriers (APCs) or infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs) for transport and combat (see also armoured corps).

As defined by the United States Army, mechanized infantry is distinguished from motorized infantry in that its vehicles provide a degree of armor protection and armament for use in combat, whereas motorized infantry are provided with &quot;soft-skinned&quot; wheeled vehicles for transportation only. Most APCs and IFVs are fully tracked or are all-wheel drive vehicles (6×6 or 8×8), for mobility across rough ground. Some militaries distinguish between mechanized and armored (or armoured) infantry, designating troops carried by APCs as mechanized and those in IFVs as armored.

The support weapons for mechanized infantry are also provided with motorized transport, or they are built directly into combat vehicles to keep pace with the mechanized infantry in combat. For units equipped with most types of APC or any type of IFV, fire support weapons, such as machine guns, autocannons, small-bore direct-fire howitzers, and anti-tank guided missiles are often mounted directly on the infantry&#x27;s own transport vehicles.

Compared with &quot;light&quot; truck-mobile infantry, mechanized infantry can maintain rapid tactical movement and, if mounted in IFVs, have more integral firepower. They require more combat supplies (ammunition and especially fuel) and ordnance supplies (spare vehicle components), and a comparatively larger proportion of manpower is required to crew and maintain the vehicles. For example, most APCs mount a section of seven or eight infantrymen but have a crew of two. Most IFVs carry only six or seven infantry but require a crew of three. To be effective in the field, mechanized units also require many mechanics, with specialized maintenance and recovery vehicles and equipment.

==History==
As early as 1915 the British instigated a tracked vehicle that could carry 50 equipped troops under armour but the project got no further than trials before cancellation. Some of the first mechanized infantry were German assault teams mounted on A7V tanks during World War I. The vehicles were extra-large to let them carry sizeable assault teams and would regularly carry infantry on board in addition to their already large crews that were trained as stormtroopers. All machine-gun-armed A7V tanks carried two small flamethrowers for their dismounts to use. A7V tank would often carry a second officer to lead the assault team.

During the Battle of St. Quentin in late March 1918, A7Vs were accompanied by twenty stormtroopers from Rohr Assault Battalion, but it is unspecified if they were acting as dismounts or were accompanying the tanks on foot. During the battle, tank crews were reported to have dismounted and attacked enemy positions with grenades and flamethrowers on numerous occasions.

Another example is the capture of Villers-Bretonneux, in which A7Vs suppressed the defenders with machine gun fire and assault teams dismounted to attack them with grenades.

The British heavy tank design was given an extended hull to cross wide German trenches. This Mark V** had space for fourteen troops. The Mark IX tank based on the Mark V was designed solely for carrying troops with space for 30 but the war ended before the order was complete and they could be used.

Towards the end of World War I, all the armies involved were faced with the problem of maintaining the momentum of an attack. Tanks, artillery, or infiltration tactics could all be used to break through an enemy defense, but almost all offensives launched in 1918 ground to a halt after a few days. The following infantry quickly became exhausted, and artillery, supplies and fresh formations could not be brought forward over the battlefields quickly enough to maintain the pressure on the regrouping enemy forces.

It was widely acknowledged that cavalry was too vulnerable to be used on most European battlefields, but many armies continued to deploy them. Motorized infantry could maintain rapid movement, but their trucks required either a good road network or firm open terrain, such as desert. They were unable to traverse a battlefield obstructed by craters, barbed wire, and trenches. Tracked or all-wheel drive vehicles were to be the solution.

Following the war, development of mechanized forces was largely theoretical for some time, but many nations began rearming in the 1930s. The British Army had established an Experimental Mechanized Force in 1927, but it failed to pursue that line because of budget constraints and the prior need to garrison the frontiers of the British Empire.

Although some proponents of mobile warfare, such as J. F. C. Fuller, advocated building &quot;tank fleets&quot;, other, such as Heinz Guderian in Germany, Adna R. Chaffee Jr. in the United States, and Mikhail Tukhachevsky in the Soviet Union, recognized that tank units required close support from infantry and other arms and that such supporting arms needed to maintain the same pace as the tanks.

As the Germans rearmed in the 1930s, they equipped some infantry units in their new Panzer divisions with the half-track Sd.Kfz. 251, which could keep up with tanks on most terrain. The French Army also created &quot;light mechanized&quot; (&quot;légère mécanisée&quot;) divisions in which some of the infantry units possessed small tracked carriers. Together with the motorization of the other infantry and support units, this gave both armies highly mobile combined-arms formations. The German doctrine was to use them to exploit breakthroughs in &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot; offensives, whereas the French envisaged them being used to shift reserves rapidly in a defensive battle.

===World War II===
As World War II progressed, most major armies integrated tanks or assault guns with mechanized infantry, as well as other supporting arms, such as artillery and combat engineers, as combined arms units.

Allied armored formations included a mechanized infantry element for combined arms teamwork. For example, US armored divisions had a balance of three battalions each of tanks, armored infantry, and self-propelled artillery. The US armored infantry was fully equipped with M2 and M3 halftracks. In the British and Commonwealth armies, &quot;Type A armoured brigades,&quot; intended for independent operations or to form part of armored divisions, had a &quot;motor infantry&quot; battalion mounted in Universal Carriers or later in lend-lease halftracks. &quot;Type B&quot; brigades lacked a motor infantry component and were subordinated to infantry formations.

The Canadian Army and, subsequently the British Army, used expedients such as the Kangaroo APC, usually for specific operations rather than to create permanent mechanized infantry formations. The first such operation was Operation Totalize in the Battle of Normandy, which failed to achieve its ultimate objectives but showed that mechanized infantry could incur far fewer casualties than dismounted troops in set-piece operations.

The German Army, having introduced mechanized infantry in its &quot;Panzer&quot; divisions, later named them units. In the middle of the war, it created entire mechanized infantry divisions and named divisions.

Because the German economy could not produce adequate numbers of its half-track APC, barely a quarter or a third of the infantry in Panzer or divisions were mechanized, except in a few favored formations. The rest were moved by truck. However, most German reconnaissance units in such formations were also primarily mechanized infantry and could undertake infantry missions when it was needed. The Allies generally used jeeps, armored cars, or light tanks for reconnaissance.

The Red Army began the war while still in the process of reorganizing its armored and mechanized formations, most of which were destroyed during the first months of the German Invasion of the Soviet Union. About a year later, the Soviets recreated division-sized mechanized infantry units, termed mechanized corps, usually with one tank brigade and three mechanized infantry brigades, with motorized supporting arms. They were generally used in the exploitation phase of offensives, as part of the prewar Soviet concept of deep operations.

The Soviet Army also created several cavalry mechanized groups in which tanks, mechanized infantry and horsed cavalry were mixed. They were also used in the exploitation and pursuit phases of offensives. Red Army mechanized infantry were generally carried on tanks or trucks, with only a few dedicated lend-lease half-track APCs.

The New Zealand Army ultimately fielded a division of a roughly similar composition to a Soviet mechanized corps, which fought in the Italian Campaign, but it had little scope for mobile operations until near the end of the war.

The Romanian Army fielded a mixed assortment of vehicles. These amounted to 126 French-designed Renault UE Chenillettes which were licence-built locally, 34 captured and refurbished Soviet armored tractors, 27 German-made armored half-tracks of the Sd.Kfz. 250 and Sd.Kfz. 251 types, over 200 Czechoslovak Tatra, Praga and Skoda trucks (the Tatra trucks were a model which was specifically built for the Romanian Army) as well as 300 German Horch 901 4x4 field cars. Sd.Kfz. 8 and Sd.Kfz. 9 half-tracks were also acquired, as well as nine vehicles of the Sd.Kfz. 10 type and 100 RSO/01 fully tracked tractors. The Romanians also produced five prototypes of an indigenous artillery tractor.

===Cold War===
On July 9, 1945, Decree of the State Defence Committee No. GKO-9488ss, &quot;On the Resupply of Armored and Mechanized Forces of the Red Army&quot; was issued. It ordered the creation of mechanised divisions from many rifle divisions, included in the Armored and Mechanised Troops. In some cases, cavalry divisions and airborne divisions also became mechanised divisions The Soviet &quot;motorised rifle troops&quot; officially appeared in accordance with the Directive of the Minister of Defense of the USSR No. org. / 3/62540 of February 27, 1957. This directive ordered part of the mechanized divisions and all rifle units and formations reorganized into &#x27;motorised rifle&#x27; in the period 1957 to 1964. Creation of the motorised rifle troops was facilitated by large-scale mechanisation of the whole Soviet Ground Forces.

This became possible due to the increase in the production of armored personnel carriers, self-propelled guns and so on. For example, in the period before the formation and in the initial period of the formation of the &quot;motorized rifle troops&quot;:
* BTR-40 – in the period from 1950 to 1960s, 8,500 units were produced
* BTR-50 — 1954 to 1970s – 6,500 pieces
* BTR-152 — 1947 to 1962 – 12,421 pieces
* BRDM-1 — 1957 to 1966 – 10,000 units

One or two motorised rifle regiments were also present in each tank division, and many tank regiments included one motorised rifle battalion.

After 1945, the Soviet Armed Forces and NATO further developed the equipment and doctrine for mechanized infantry. With the exception of airborne formations, the Red Army mechanized all its infantry formations. Initially, wheeled APCs, like the BTR-152, were used, some of which lacked overhead protection and were therefore vulnerable to artillery fire. It still gave the Soviet Army greater strategic flexibility because of the large land area and the long borders of the Soviet Union and its allies in the Warsaw Pact. Armored vehicles meant infantry were capable of overcoming water barriers and having means of protection against Weapons of Mass Destruction.

The US Army established the basic configuration of the tracked APC with the M75 and M59 before it adopted the lighter M113, which could be carried by Lockheed C-130 Hercules and other transport aircraft. The vehicle gave infantry the same mobility as tanks but with much less effective armor protection (it still had nuclear, biological, and chemical protection).

In the Vietnam War, the M113 was often fitted with extra armament and used as an &quot;ad hoc&quot; infantry fighting vehicle. Early operations by the Army of the Republic of Vietnam using the vehicle showed that troops were far more effective while they were mounted in the vehicles than when they dismounted. American doctrine subsequently emphasized mounted tactics. The Americans ultimately deployed a mechanized brigade and ten mechanized battalions to Vietnam.

The &quot;motorized rifle troops&quot; of the Soviet Armed Forces were the world&#x27;s first infantry units that adopted a new class of combat vehicles in 1966 – Infantry fighting vehicles. BMP-1 began entering service in 1966. In the Federal Republic of Germany, an approximate analogue, the Marder, appeared only in 1970. Unlike the APC, which was intended merely to transport the infantry from place to place under armor, the IFV had heavy firepower that could support infantry. The Infantry fighting vehicle concept was subsequently copied by almost all countries of the world.

The introduction of the BMP-1 prompted the development of similar vehicles in Western armies, such as the West German Marder and American M2 Bradley. Many IFVs were also equipped with firing ports from which their infantry could fire their weapons from inside, but they were generally not successful and have been dropped from modern IFVs.

Soviet organization led to different tactics between the &quot;light&quot; and the &quot;heavy&quot; varieties of mechanized infantry. In the Soviet Army, a first-line &quot;motor rifle&quot; division from the 1970s onward usually had two regiments equipped with wheeled BTR-60 APCs and one with the tracked BMP-1 IFV. The &quot;light&quot; regiments were intended to make dismounted attacks on the division&#x27;s flanks, while the BMP-equipped &quot;heavy&quot; regiment remained mounted and supported the division&#x27;s tank regiment on the main axis of advance. Both types of infantry regiment still were officially titled &quot;motor rifle&quot; units.

A line of development in the Soviet Armed Forces from the 1980s was the provision of specialized IFVs for use by the Russian Airborne Troops. The first of them was the BMD-1, which had the same firepower as the BMP-1 but could be carried in or even parachuted from the standard Soviet transport aircraft. That made airborne formations into mechanized infantry at the cost of reducing their &quot;bayonet&quot; strength, as the BMD could carry only three or at most four paratroopers in addition to its three-man crew. They were used in that role in the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979.

==Present day==

At present, almost all infantry units from industrialized nations are provided with some type of motor transport. Infantry units equipped with IFVs rather than lighter vehicles are commonly designated as &quot;heavy&quot;, indicating more combat power but also more costly long-range transportation requirements. In Operation Desert Shield, during the buildup phase of the First Gulf War, the U.S. Army was concerned about the lack of mobility, protection and firepower offered by existing rapid deployment (i.e., airborne) formations; and also about the slowness of deploying regular armored units. The experience led the U.S. Army to form combat brigades based on the Stryker wheeled IFV.

In the British Army, &quot;heavy&quot; units equipped with the Warrior IFV are described as &quot;armoured infantry&quot;, and units with the Bulldog APC as &quot;mechanised infantry&quot;. This convention is becoming widespread; for example the French Army has &quot;&quot;motorisées&quot; units equipped with the wheeled VAB and &quot;mécanisées&quot;&quot; units with the tracked AMX-10P.

The transport and other logistic requirements have led many armies to adopt wheeled APCs when their existing stocks of tracked APCs require replacement. An example is the Canadian Army, which has used the LAV III wheeled IFV in fighting in Afghanistan. The Italian, Spanish and Swedish armies are adopting (and exporting) new indigenous-produced tracked IFVs. The Swedish CV90 IFV in particular has been adopted by several armies.
A recent trend seen in the Israel Defense Forces and the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation is the development and introduction of exceptionally well-armored APCs (HAPC), such as the IDF Achzarit, that are converted from obsolete main battle tanks (such as the Soviet T-55). Such vehicles are usually expedients, and lack of space prevents the armament of an IFV being carried in addition to an infantry section or squad. In the Russian Army, such vehicles were introduced for fighting in urban areas, where the risk from short range infantry anti-tank weapons, such as the RPG-7, is highest, after Russian tank and motor infantry units suffered heavy losses fighting Chechen troops in Grozny during the First Chechen War in 1995.

Many APCs and IFVs currently under development are intended for rapid deployment by aircraft. New technologies that promise reduction in weight, such as electric drive, may be incorporated. However, facing a similar threat in post-invasion Iraq to that which prompted the Russians to convert tanks to APCs, the occupying armies have found it necessary to apply extra armor to existing APCs and IFVs, which adds to the overall size and weight. Some of the latest designs (such as the German Puma) are intended to allow a light, basic model vehicle, which is air-transportable, to be fitted in the field with additional protection, thereby ensuring both strategic flexibility and survivability.

===Medium mechanized forces===
In the late Cold War and early 21st century, various countries developed medium infantry forces armed with armored vehicles, which typically consisted of wheeled armored personnel carriers, infantry fighting vehicles, and assault guns. Medium mechanized forces are characterized by having more strategic air and road mobility than heavier, tank-based armored forces while offering better armor protection for the formation than the lighter motorized infantry formation, in which vehicles were considered &quot;battle taxis&quot; due to poor protection. The earliest experiment was the short-lived Soviet Light Motor Rifle Division in 1987, which consisted of wheeled BTR platforms for its primary armament. In the 1990s, the United States explored Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT) formation and doctrines, which was a medium mechanized infantry formation with all-wheeled platforms centered around Stryker armored personnel carrier. In the early 21st century, China reformed its ground forces with the concept called Medium Combined Arms Brigade (CA-BDE), armed with Type 08 universal wheeled platform. A similar trend of adopting the medium mechanized forces was observed in European countries, including the Italian, Polish, and French armed forces.

==Combined arms operations==

It is generally accepted that single weapons system types are much less effective without the support of the full combined arms team; the pre-World War II notion of &quot;tank fleets&quot; has proven to be as unsound as the World War I idea of unsupported infantry attacks. Though many nations&#x27; armored formations included an organic mechanized infantry component at the start of World War II, the proportion of mechanized infantry in such combined arms formations was increased by most armies as the war progressed.

The lesson was re-learned, first by the Pakistani Army in the 1965 war with India, where the nation fielded two different types of armored divisions: one which was almost exclusively armor (the 1st), while another was more balanced (the 6th). The latter division showed itself to be far more combat-capable than the former.

Having achieved spectacular successes in the offensive with tank-heavy formations during the Six-Day War, the Israel Defense Forces found in the Yom Kippur War of 1973 that a doctrine that relied primarily on tanks and aircraft had proven inadequate. As a makeshift remedy, paratroopers were provided with motorized transport and used as mechanized infantry in coordination with the armor.

<doc id="20285" wikidata="Q5767200" url="?curid=20285" title="Malachi">
<text>Malachi or Malachias (; ) is the name used by the author of the Book of Malachi, the last book of the Nevi&#x27;im (Prophets) section of the Tanakh. It is possible that &quot;Malachi&quot; is not a proper name, because it means &quot;messenger&quot;; it has been assumed to be a pseudonym. According to Jewish tradition, the real identity of Malachi is Ezra the scribe.

Most scholars regard The Book of Malachi as the result of multiple stages of redaction; most of its text originated in the Persian period, with the oldest stratum from around 500 BCE and redactions into the Hellenistic period.

==Identity==
The editors of the 1906 &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; implied that Malachi, also known as Malachias, prophesied after Haggai and Zechariah and speculated that he delivered his prophecies about 420 BC, after the second return of Nehemiah from Persia, or possibly before his return. The Talmud and the Aramaic Targum of Yonathan ben Uzziel identify Ezra as the same person as Malachi. This is the traditional view held by most Jews and some Christians, including Jerome. This identification is plausible, because &quot;Malachi&quot; reprimands the people for the same things Ezra did, such as marrying foreign pagan women. Malachi also focuses extensively on corrupt priests; which Ezra, a priest himself who exhorted the people to follow the law, despised. According to Josephus, Ezra died and was buried &quot;in a magnificent manner in Jerusalem.&quot; If the tradition that Ezra wrote under the name &quot;Malachi&quot; is correct, then Josephus meant that he was buried in the Tomb of the Prophets, the traditional resting place of Malachi. This would also explain why Ezra does not refer to a prophet named Malachi, while he did refer to other prophets such as Haggai and Zechariah. Others ascribe the book to Zerubbabel and Nehemiah; others suggest that Malachi was a separate person altogether, possibly a Levite and a member of the Great Assembly.

==Name==
Because the name &quot;Malachi&quot; does not occur elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible, some scholars doubt whether it is intended to be the personal name of the prophet. The form &quot;mal&#x27;akhi&quot; (literally &quot;my &quot;malakh&quot;&quot;) signifies &quot;my messenger&quot;; it occurs in Malachi 3:1 (compare to Malachi 2:7, but this form would hardly be appropriate as a proper name without some additional syllable such as Yah, whence &quot;mal&#x27;akhiah&quot;, i.e. &quot;messenger of Yah&quot;. In the Book of Haggai, Haggai is designated the &quot;messenger of the .&quot; The non-canonical superscriptions prefixed to the book, in both the Septuagint and the Vulgate, warrant the supposition that Malachi&#x27;s full name ended with the syllable -yah. The Septuagint translates the last clause of Malachi 1:1, &quot;by the hand of his messenger&quot;, and the Targum reads, &quot;by the hand of my angel, whose name is called Ezra the scribe&quot;. G.G. Cameron suggests that the termination of the word &quot;Malachi&quot; is adjectival, and equivalent to the Latin &quot;angelicus&quot;, signifying &quot;one charged with a message or mission&quot; (a missionary).

==Date==

Opinions vary as to the prophet&#x27;s exact date, but nearly all scholars agree that Malachi prophesied during the Persian period, and after the reconstruction and dedication of the Second Temple in 516 BC. More specifically, Malachi probably lived and labored during the times of Ezra and Nehemiah. The abuses which Malachi mentions in his writings correspond so exactly with those which Nehemiah found on his second visit to Jerusalem in 432 BC that it seems reasonably certain that he prophesied concurrently with Nehemiah or shortly after.

<text>Martin Fowler (18 December 1963) is a British software developer, author and international public speaker on software development, specialising in object-oriented analysis and design, UML, patterns, and agile software development methodologies, including extreme programming.

His 1999 book &quot;Refactoring&quot; popularised the practice of code refactoring. In 2004 he introduced a new architectural pattern, called Presentation Model (PM).

== Biography ==
Fowler was born and grew up in Walsall, England, where he went to Queen Mary&#x27;s Grammar School for his secondary education. He graduated at University College London in 1986. In 1994, he moved to the United States, where he lives near Boston, Massachusetts in the suburb of Melrose.

Fowler started working with software in the early 1980s. Out of university in 1986 he started working in software development for Coopers &amp; Lybrand until 1991. In 2000 he joined ThoughtWorks, a systems integration and consulting company, where he was Chief Scientist.

Fowler has written nine books on the topic of software development. He is a member of the &quot;Agile Alliance&quot; and helped create the Manifesto for Agile Software Development in 2001, along with 16 fellow signatories. He maintains a &quot;bliki&quot;, a mix of blog and wiki. He popularised the term Dependency Injection as a form of Inversion of Control.

== Domain-specific languages ==
In his book, &quot;Domain-specific languages&quot;, Fowler discusses Domain-specific languages, DSL. DSLs are said to be defined by being composable programming languages, with their focus on an individual domain and having limited expressiveness. It is argued that DSLs can increase productivity by removing the requirement of the programmer to understand a full programming language, providing a means of communication with domain experts, and separate the manner of execution of a task from the definition of a task itself. These benefits are set against the cost of learning a new language and building the tools for this language, siloing that results for different languages and the abstractions used in DSLs not being suitable for a task.

Fowler introduces the concept of internal (or embedded) and external DSL, an internal DSL being a DSL that is a subset of another language and can be executed by the tools for this outer language. Ruby and Lisp are given as an example of languages where internal DSLs are common. He also introduces the idea of Semantic Model which defines the execution of a DSL. Various examples of DSLs are presented including graphviz, a language for specifying graphs to be rendered; JMock, a java mocking framework; CSS, a language to specify stylistic elements of a website; HQL, an object relational mapper in Java; XAML, a language used to specify and change graphical user interfaces; FIT, a language to express testing scenarios; and make, a tool to build software

The book discusses implementing an external DSL using tools like parsers, lexers, abstract syntax trees and code generation referred to as &quot;syntax-driven translation&quot; This is contrasted with &quot;delimiter-driven translation&quot; which is said to be simpler but less powerful. Here the language is simple enough to be interpreted by splitting on delimiters and switching logic based on individual entries.

Ways of implementing internal DSLs is discussed, with attention paid to nested function calls, sequences of function calls, or method chaining amongst other methods.

<text>Microsoft Word is a word processing program developed by Microsoft. It was first released on October 25, 1983, under the name Multi-Tool Word for Xenix systems. Subsequent versions were later written for several other platforms including: IBM PCs running DOS (1983), Apple Macintosh running the Classic Mac OS (1985), AT&amp;T UNIX PC (1985), Atari ST (1988), OS/2 (1989), Microsoft Windows (1989), SCO Unix (1990), Handheld PC (1996), Pocket PC (2000), macOS (2001), Web browsers (2010), iOS (2014), and Android (2015).

Microsoft Word has been the &quot;de facto&quot; standard word processing software since the 1990s when it eclipsed WordPerfect. Commercial versions of Word are licensed as a standalone product or as a component of Microsoft Office, which can be purchased with a perpetual license, or as part of the Microsoft 365 suite as a subscription.

==History==

In 1981, Microsoft hired Charles Simonyi, the primary developer of Bravo, the first GUI word processor, which was developed at Xerox PARC. Simonyi started work on a word processor called &quot;Multi-Tool Word&quot; and soon hired Richard Brodie, a former Xerox intern, who became the primary software engineer.

Microsoft announced Multi-Tool Word for Xenix and MS-DOS in 1983. Its name was soon simplified to &quot;Microsoft Word&quot;. Free demonstration copies of the application were bundled with the November 1983 issue of &quot;PC World&quot;, making it the first to be distributed on-disk with a magazine. That year Microsoft demonstrated Word running on Windows.

Unlike most MS-DOS programs at the time, Microsoft Word was designed to be used with a mouse. Advertisements depicted the Microsoft Mouse and described Word as a WYSIWYG, windowed word processor with the ability to undo and display bold, italic, and underlined text, although it could not render fonts. It was not initially popular, since its user interface was different from the leading word processor at the time, WordStar. However, Microsoft steadily improved the product, releasing versions 2.0 through 5.0 over the next six years. In 1985, Microsoft ported Word to the classic Mac OS (known as Macintosh System Software at the time). This was made easier by Word for DOS having been designed for use with high-resolution displays and laser printers, even though none were yet available to the general public. It was also notable for its very fast cut-and-paste function and unlimited number of undo operations, which are due to its usage of the piece table data structure.

Following the precedents of LisaWrite and MacWrite, Word for Mac OS added true WYSIWYG features. It fulfilled a need for a word processor that was more capable than MacWrite. After its release, Word for Mac OS&#x27;s sales were higher than its MS-DOS counterpart for at least four years.

The second release of Word for Mac OS, shipped in 1987, was named Word 3.0 to synchronize its version number with Word for DOS; this was Microsoft&#x27;s first attempt to synchronize version numbers across platforms. Word 3.0 included numerous internal enhancements and new features, including the first implementation of the Rich Text Format (RTF) specification, but was plagued with bugs. Within a few months, Word 3.0 was superseded by a more stable Word 3.01, which was mailed free to all registered users of 3.0. After MacWrite Pro was discontinued in the mid-1990s, Word for Mac OS never had any serious rivals. Word 5.1 for Mac OS, released in 1992, was a very popular word processor owing to its elegance, relative ease of use, and feature set. Many users say it is the best version of Word for Mac OS ever created.

In 1986, an agreement between Atari and Microsoft brought Word to the Atari ST under the name &quot;Microsoft Write&quot;. The Atari ST version was a port of Word 1.05 for the Mac OS and was never updated.

The first version of Word for Windows was released in 1989. With the release of Windows 3.0 the following year, sales began to pick up and Microsoft soon became the market leader for word processors for IBM PC-compatible computers. In 1991, Microsoft capitalized on Word for Windows&#x27; increasing popularity by releasing a version of Word for DOS, version 5.5, that replaced its unique user interface with an interface similar to a Windows application. When Microsoft became aware of the Year 2000 problem, it made Microsoft Word 5.5 for DOS available for free downloads. , it is still available for download from Microsoft&#x27;s website.
In 1991, Microsoft embarked on a project code-named Pyramid to completely rewrite Microsoft Word from the ground up. Both the Windows and Mac OS versions would start from the same code base. It was abandoned when it was determined that it would take the development team too long to rewrite and then catch up with all the new capabilities that could have been added at the same time without a rewrite. Instead, the next versions of Word for Windows and Mac OS, dubbed version 6.0, both started from the code base of Word for Windows 2.0.

With the release of Word 6.0 in 1993, Microsoft again attempted to synchronize the version numbers and coordinate product naming across platforms, this time across DOS, Mac OS, and Windows (this was the last version of Word for DOS). It introduced AutoCorrect, which automatically fixed certain typing errors, and AutoFormat, which could reformat many parts of a document at once. While the Windows version received favorable reviews (e.g., from &quot;InfoWorld&quot;), the Mac OS version was widely derided. Many accused it of being slow, clumsy, and memory intensive, and its user interface differed significantly from Word 5.1. In response to user requests, Microsoft offered Word 5 again, after it had been discontinued. Subsequent versions of Word for macOS are no longer direct ports of Word for Windows, instead featuring a mixture of ported code and native code.

==File formats==
===Filename extensions===
Microsoft Word&#x27;s native file formats are denoted either by a codice_1 or codice_2 filename extension.

Although the codice_3 extension has been used in many different versions of Word, it actually encompasses four distinct file formats:
# Word for DOS
# Word for Windows 1 and 2; Word 3 and 4 for Mac OS
# Word 6 and Word 95 for Windows; Word 6 for Mac OS
# Word 97 and later for Windows; Word 98 and later for Mac OS

(The classic Mac OS of the era did not use filename extensions.)

The newer codice_2 extension signifies the Office Open XML international standard for Office documents and is used by default by Word 2007 and later for Windows as well as Word 2008 and later for macOS.

===Binary formats (Word 97–2007)===
During the late 1990s and early 2000s, the default Word document format (.DOC) became a &quot;de facto&quot; standard of document file formats for Microsoft Office users. There are different versions of &quot;Word Document Format&quot; used by default in Word 97–2007. Each binary word file is a Compound File, a hierarchical file system within a file. According to Joel Spolsky, Word Binary File Format is extremely complex mainly because its developers had to accommodate an overwhelming number of features and prioritize performance over anything else.

As with all OLE Compound Files, Word Binary Format consists of &quot;storages&quot;, which are analogous to computer folders, and &quot;streams&quot;, which are similar to computer files. Each storage may contain streams or other storage. Each Word Binary File must contain a stream called the &quot;WordDocument&quot; stream and this stream must start with a File Information Block (FIB). FIB serves as the first point of reference for locating everything else, such as where the text in a Word document starts, ends, what version of Word created the document and other attributes.

Word 2007 and later continue to support the DOC file format, although it is no longer the default.

===XML Document (Word 2003)===
The .docx XML format introduced in Word 2003 was a simple, XML-based format called WordProcessingML or WordML.

The Microsoft Office XML formats are XML-based document formats (or XML schemas) introduced in versions of Microsoft Office prior to Office 2007. Microsoft Office XP introduced a new XML format for storing Excel spreadsheets and Office 2003 added an XML-based format for Word documents.

These formats were succeeded by Office Open XML (ECMA-376) in Microsoft Office 2007.

===Cross-version compatibility===
Opening a Word Document file in a version of Word other than the one with which it was created can cause an incorrect display of the document. The document formats of the various versions change in subtle and not-so-subtle ways (such as changing the font or the handling of more complex tasks like footnotes). Formatting created in newer versions does not always survive when viewed in older versions of the program, nearly always because that capability does not exist in the previous version. Rich Text Format (RTF), an early effort to create a format for interchanging formatted text between applications, is an optional format for Word that retains most formatting and all content of the original document.

===Third-party formats===
Plugins permitting the Windows versions of Word to read and write formats it does not natively support, such as international standard OpenDocument format (ODF) (ISO/IEC 26300:2006), are available. Up until the release of Service Pack 2 (SP2) for Office 2007, Word did not natively support reading or writing ODF documents without a plugin, namely the SUN ODF Plugin or the OpenXML/ODF Translator. With SP2 installed, ODF format 1.1 documents can be read and saved like any other supported format in addition to those already available in Word 2007. The implementation faces substantial criticism, and the ODF Alliance and others have claimed that the third-party plugins provide better support. Microsoft later declared that the ODF support has some limitations.

In October 2005, one year before the Microsoft Office 2007 suite was released, Microsoft declared that there was insufficient demand from Microsoft customers for the international standard OpenDocument format support and that therefore it would not be included in Microsoft Office 2007. This statement was repeated in the following months. As an answer, on October 20, 2005, an online petition was created to demand ODF support from Microsoft.

In May 2006, the ODF plugin for Microsoft Office was released by the OpenDocument Foundation. Microsoft declared that it had no relationship with the developers of the plugin.

In July 2006, Microsoft announced the creation of the Open XML Translator project – tools to build a technical bridge between the Microsoft Office Open XML Formats and the OpenDocument Format (ODF). This work was started in response to government requests for interoperability with ODF. The goal of the project was not to add ODF support to Microsoft Office, but only to create a plugin and an external toolset. In February 2007, this project released a first version of the ODF plugin for Microsoft Word.

In February 2007, Sun released an initial version of its ODF plugin for Microsoft Office. Version 1.0 was released in July 2007.

Microsoft Word 2007 (Service Pack 1) supports (for output only) PDF and XPS formats, but only after manual installation of the Microsoft &quot;Save as PDF or XPS&quot; add-on. On later releases, this was offered by default.

==Features==

Among its features, Word includes a built-in spell checker, a thesaurus, a dictionary, and utilities for manipulating and editing text. It supports creating tables. Depending on the version, it can perform simple and complex calculations, and supports formatting formulas and equations.

The following are some aspects of its feature set.

=== Templates ===
Several later versions of Word include the ability for users to create their own formatting templates, allowing them to define a file in which: the title, heading, paragraph, and other element designs differ from the standard Word templates. Users can find how to do this under the Help section located near the top right corner (Word 2013 on Windows 8).

For example, Normal.dotm is the master template from which all Word documents are created. It determines the margin defaults as well as the layout of the text and font defaults. Although Normal.dotm is already set with certain defaults, the user can change it to new defaults. This will change other documents which were created using the template. It was previously Normal.dot.

===Image formats===
Word can import and display images in common bitmap formats such as JPG and GIF. It can also be used to create and display simple line art. Microsoft Word added support for the common SVG vector image format in 2017 for Office 365 ProPlus subscribers and this functionality was also included in the Office 2019 release.

===WordArt===
WordArt enables drawing text in a Microsoft Word document such as a title, watermark, or other text, with graphical effects such as skewing, shadowing, rotating, stretching in a variety of shapes and colors, and even including three-dimensional effects. Users can apply formatting effects such as shadow, bevel, glow, and reflection to their document text as easily as applying bold or underline. Users can also spell-check text that uses visual effects and add text effects to paragraph styles.

===Macros===
A macro is a rule of pattern that specifies how a certain input sequence (often a sequence of characters) should be mapped to an output sequence according to a defined process. Frequently used or repetitive sequences of keystrokes and mouse movements can be automated. Like other Microsoft Office documents, Word files can include advanced macros and even embedded programs. The language was originally WordBasic, but changed to Visual Basic for Applications as of Word 97.

This extensive functionality can also be used to run and propagate viruses in documents. The tendency for people to exchange Word documents via email, USB flash drives, and floppy disks made this an especially attractive vector in 1999. A prominent example was the Melissa virus, but countless others have existed.

These macro viruses were the only known cross-platform threats between Windows and Macintosh computers and they were the only infection vectors to affect any macOS system up until the advent of video codec trojans in 2007. Microsoft released patches for Word X and Word 2004 that effectively eliminated the macro problem on the Mac by 2006.

Word&#x27;s macro security setting, which regulates when macros may execute, can be adjusted by the user, but in the most recent versions of Word, it is set to HIGH by default, generally reducing the risk from macro-based viruses, which have become uncommon.

===Layout issues===
Before Word 2010 (Word 14) for Windows, the program was unable to correctly handle ligatures defined in OpenType fonts. Those ligature glyphs with Unicode codepoints may be inserted manually, but are not recognized by Word for what they are, breaking spell checking, while custom ligatures present in the font are not accessible at all. Since Word 2010, the program now has advanced typesetting features which can be enabled, OpenType ligatures, kerning and hyphenation (previous versions already had the latter two features). Other layout deficiencies of Word include the inability to set crop marks or thin spaces. Various third-party workaround utilities have been developed.

In Word 2004 for Mac OS X, support of complex scripts was inferior even to Word 97 and Word 2004 did not support Apple Advanced Typography features like ligatures or glyph variants.

===Issues with technical documents===
Microsoft Word is only partially suitable for some kinds of technical writing, specifically, that which requires mathematical equations, figure placement, table placement and cross-references to any of these items. The usual workaround for equations is to use a third-party equation typesetter. Figures and tables must be placed manually; there is an anchor mechanism but it is not designed for fully automatic figure placement and editing text after placing figures and tables often requires re-placing those items by moving the anchor point and even then the placement options are limited. This problem is deeply baked into Word&#x27;s structure since 1985 as it does not know where page breaks will occur until the document is printed.

===Bullets and numbering===
Microsoft Word supports bullet lists and numbered lists. It also features a numbering system that helps add correct numbers to pages, chapters, headers, footnotes, and entries of tables of content; these numbers automatically change to correct ones as new items are added or existing items are deleted. Bullets and numbering can be applied directly to paragraphs and converted to lists. Word 97 through 2003, however, had problems adding correct numbers to numbered lists. In particular, a second irrelevant numbered list might have not started with number one but instead resumed numbering after the last numbered list. Although Word 97 supported a hidden marker that said the list numbering must restart afterward, the command to insert this marker (Restart Numbering command) was only added in Word 2003. However, if one were to cut the first item of the listed and paste it as another item (e.g. fifth), then the restart marker would have moved with it and the list would have restarted in the middle instead of at the top.

Word continues to default to non-Unicode characters and non-hierarchical bulleting, despite user preference for PowerPoint-style symbol hierarchies (e.g., filled circle/emdash/filled square/endash/emptied circle) and universal compatibility.

===AutoSummarize===
Available in certain versions of Word (e.g., Word 2007), AutoSummarize highlights passages or phrases that it considers valuable and can be a quick way of generating a crude abstract or an executive summary. The amount of text to be retained can be specified by the user as a percentage of the current amount of text.

According to Ron Fein of the Word 97 team, AutoSummarize cuts wordy copy to the bone by counting words and ranking sentences. First, AutoSummarize identifies the most common words in the document (barring &quot;a&quot; and &quot;the&quot; and the like) and assigns a &quot;score&quot; to each word – the more frequently a word is used, the higher the score. Then, it &quot;averages&quot; each sentence by adding the scores of its words and dividing the sum by the number of words in the sentence – the higher the average, the higher the rank of the sentence. &quot;It&#x27;s like the ratio of wheat to chaff,&quot; explains Fein.

AutoSummarize was removed from Microsoft Word for Mac OS X 2011, although it was present in Word for Mac 2008. AutoSummarize was removed from the Office 2010 release version (14) as well.

===Spike===
Spike is a specialized cut command in Microsoft Word. It is named after an implement in restaurants on which receipts are impaled, and similarly sequentially stores data to be pasted and adds them together to the document when the second function step, or paste, is performed. Please note that spiking (CONTROL–F3) performs a cut function, which can be immediately undone to simulate a &quot;copy&quot; command, while the pasting function (SHIFT–CONTROL–F3) will also clear the data from the spike, although this can be avoided by using alternatives to the three-key shortcut. 

===Hidden text===

Word supports marking selected text as &quot;hidden&quot;. Hidden text is text that is stored in the document but is not displayed. For example, pages containing large amounts of markup language text can be made visually more readable during the editing process.

=== Password protection ===
Three password types can be set in Microsoft Word:

* Password to open a document 
* Password to modify a document
* Password restricting formatting and editing

The second and third password types were developed by Microsoft for convenient shared use of documents rather than for their protection. There is no encryption of documents that are protected by such passwords and the Microsoft Office protection system saves a hash sum of a password in a document&#x27;s header where it can be easily accessed and removed by the specialized software. &quot;Password to open a document&quot; offers much tougher protection that had been steadily enhanced in the subsequent editions of Microsoft Office.

&quot;Word 95&quot; and all the preceding editions had the weakest protection that utilized a conversion of a password to a 16-bit key.

Key length in &quot;Word 97&quot; and &quot;2000&quot; was strengthened up to 40 bit. However, modern cracking software allows removing such a password very quickly – a persistent cracking process takes one week at most. Use of rainbow tables reduces password removal time to several seconds. Some password recovery software can not only remove a password but also find an actual password that was used by a user to encrypt the document using the brute-force attack approach. Statistically, the possibility of recovering the password depends on the password strength.

Word&#x27;s 2003/XP version default protection remained the same but an option that allowed advanced users to choose a Cryptographic Service Provider was added. If a strong CSP is chosen, guaranteed document decryption becomes unavailable and, therefore, a password can&#x27;t be removed from the document. Nonetheless, a password can be fairly quickly picked with a brute-force attack, because its speed is still high regardless of the CSP selected. Moreover, since the CSPs are not active by default, their use is limited to advanced users only.

Word 2007 offers significantly more secure document protection which utilizes the modern Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) that converts a password to a 128-bit key using a SHA-1 hash function 50,000 times. It makes password removal impossible (as of today, no computer that can pick the key in a reasonable amount of time exists) and drastically slows the brute-force attack speed down to several hundreds of passwords per second.

Word&#x27;s 2010 protection algorithm was not changed apart from the increasing number of SHA-1 conversions up to 100,000 times and consequently, the brute-force attack speed decreased two times more.

== Versions and platforms ==

===Word for Windows===

Word for Windows is available stand-alone or as part of the Microsoft Office suite. Word contains rudimentary desktop publishing capabilities and is the most widely used word processing program on the market. Word files are commonly used as the format for sending text documents via e-mail because almost every user with a computer can read a Word document by using the Word application, a Word viewer or a word processor that imports the Word format (see Microsoft Word Viewer).

Word 6 for Windows NT was the first 32-bit version of the product, released with Microsoft Office for Windows NT around the same time as Windows 95. It was a straightforward port of Word 6.0. Starting with Word 95, each release of Word was named after the year of its release, instead of its version number.

Word 2007 introduced a redesigned user interface that emphasized the most common controls, dividing them into tabs, and adding specific options depending on the context, such as selecting an image or editing a table. This user interface, called Ribbon, was included in Excel, PowerPoint and Access 2007, and would be later introduced to other Office applications with Office 2010 and Windows applications such as Paint and WordPad with Windows 7, respectively.

The redesigned interface also includes a toolbar that appears when selecting text, with options for formatting included.

Word 2007 also included the option to save documents as Adobe Acrobat or XPS files, and upload Word documents like blog posts on services such as WordPress.

Word 2010 allows the customization of the Ribbon, adds a Backstage view for file management, has improved document navigation, allows creation and embedding of screenshots, and integrates with online services such as Microsoft OneDrive.

Word 2019 added a dictation function.

Word 2021 added co-authoring, a visual refresh on the start experience and tabs, automatic cloud saving, dark mode, line focus, an updated draw tab, and support for ODF 1.3.

===Word for Mac===
The Mac was introduced on January 24, 1984, and Microsoft introduced Word 1.0 for Mac a year later, on January 18, 1985. The DOS, Mac, and Windows versions are quite different from each other. Only the Mac version was WYSIWYG and used a graphical user interface, far ahead of the other platforms. Each platform restarted its version numbering at &quot;1.0&quot;. There was no version 2 on the Mac, but version 3 came out on January 31, 1987, as described above. Word 4.0 came out on November 6, 1990, and added automatic linking with Excel, the ability to flow text around graphics, and a WYSIWYG page view editing mode. Word 5.1 for Mac, released in 1992 ran on the original 68000 CPU and was the last to be specifically designed as a Macintosh application. The later Word 6 was a Windows port and poorly received. Word 5.1 continued to run well until the last classic Mac OS. Many people continue to run Word 5.1 to this day under an emulated Mac classic system for some of its excellent features, such as document generation and renumbering, or to access their old files.
In 1997, Microsoft formed the Macintosh Business Unit as an independent group within Microsoft focused on writing software for the classic Mac OS. Its first version of Word, Word 98, was released with Office 98 Macintosh Edition. Document compatibility reached parity with Word 97, and it included features from Word 97 for Windows, including spell and grammar checking with squiggles. Users could choose the menus and keyboard shortcuts to be similar to either Word 97 for Windows or Word 5 for Mac.

Word 2001, released in 2000, added a few new features, including the Office Clipboard, which allowed users to copy and paste multiple items. It was the last version to run on the classic Mac OS and, on Mac OS X, it could only run within the Classic Environment. Word X, released in 2001, was the first version to run natively on, and to require, Mac OS X, and introduced non-contiguous text selection.

Word 2004 was released in May 2004. It included a new Notebook Layout view for taking notes either by typing or by voice. Other features, such as tracking changes, were made more similar with Office for Windows.

Word 2008, released on January 15, 2008, included a Ribbon-like feature, called the Elements Gallery, that can be used to select page layouts and insert custom diagrams and images. It also included a new view focused on publishing layout, integrated bibliography management, and native support for the new Office Open XML format. It was the first version to run natively on Intel-based Macs.

Word 2011, released in October 2010, replaced the Elements Gallery in favor of a Ribbon user interface that is much more similar to Office for Windows, and includes a full-screen mode that allows users to focus on reading and writing documents, and support for Office Web Apps.

Word 2021 added real-time co-authoring, automatic cloud saving, dark mode, immersive reader enhancements, line focus, a visual refresh, the ability to save pictures in SVG format, and a new Sketched style outline.

Word 2024, released on September 16, 2024, included Word session recovery, support for ODF 1.4, new theme and color palette and ability for easier collaboration. Even though collaboration features were also available in Microsoft Word 2021 as part of post release update, they were not available in Word LTSC 2021 or Word LTSC 2024.

=== Write for Atari ST ===

Microsoft Write for the Atari ST is the Atari version of Microsoft Word 1.05 released for the Apple Macintosh while sharing the same name as the Microsoft Write program included in Windows during the 80s and early 90s. While the program was announced in 1986, various delays caused the program to arrive in 1988. Microsoft Write for Atari ST and Microsoft Word for Windows would both make their debut at the 1988 COMDEX in Atlanta, Georgia alongside their respective booths.

Like the Mac version, the Atari version features WYSIWYG form (via GDOS) and used a graphical user interface (via GEM).

Microsoft Write was one of the first Atari word processors that utilizes the GDOS (Graphics Device Operating System) part of GEM (Graphics Environment Manager) allowing the word processor to display and print graphic fonts &amp; styles making it a multifont word processor for the Atari ST (a 2nd disk drive was required to run both Microsoft Write and GDOS). Microsoft Write was packaged with GDOS 1.1 and the drivers for the Atari XMM804 dot matrix printer along with 3rd party printers like Epson FX-80 and Star Micronics NB-15 on 4 diskettes (3½ inch format).

Accompanying the retail packaging was a 206-page slip-cased user&#x27;s manual that was divided into 3 sections: Learning Write, Using Write and Write Reference. In addition, Microsoft Write also featured a &quot;Help Screen&quot; tool to help a user explore the advanced features of the word processor that earned high praise for its form and presentation.

=== Write for Macintosh ===
In October 1987, Microsoft released Microsoft Write for Macintosh. Write is a version of Microsoft Word with limited features that Microsoft hoped would replace aging MacWrite in the Macintosh word processor market. Write was priced well below Word, though at the time MacWrite was included with new Macintoshes. Write is best described as Word locked in &quot;Short Menus&quot; mode, and as such it used the same file format so that users could exchange files with absolutely no conversion necessary. Write did not sell well and was discontinued before the System 7 era. Microsoft Write was part of a short-lived trend for &quot;lightweight&quot; Macintosh word processors initiated by the introduction of the Macintosh Portable and early PowerBook systems. Others included LetterPerfect and Nisus Compact.

=== Word on mobile platforms ===

The first mobile versions of Word were released with Windows CE in 1996 on Handheld PCs and later also on Pocket PCs.
The modern Word Mobile supports basic formatting, such as bolding, changing font size, and changing colors (from red, yellow, or green). It can add comments, but can&#x27;t edit documents with tracked changes. It can&#x27;t open password-protected documents; change the typeface, text alignment, or style (normal, heading 1); insert responsive checkboxes; insert pictures; or undo.

Word Mobile is neither able to display nor insert footnotes, endnotes, page footers, page breaks, certain indentation of lists, and certain fonts while working on a document, but retains them if the original document has them. Word Mobile can insert lists, but doesn&#x27;t allow to set custom bullet symbols and customize list numbering. In addition to the features of the 2013 version, the 2007 version on Windows Mobile also has the ability to save documents in the Rich Text Format and open legacy PSW (Pocket Word). Furthermore, it includes a spell checker, word count tool, and a &quot;Find and Replace&quot; command. In 2015, Word Mobile became available for Windows 10 and Windows 10 Mobile on Windows Store. Support for the Windows 10 Mobile version ended on January 12, 2021.

Word for iOS was released on March 27, 2014 and for Android was released on January 29, 2015.

===Word for the web===

Word for the web is a free lightweight version of Microsoft Word available as part of Office on the web, which also includes web versions of Microsoft Excel and Microsoft PowerPoint.

Word for the web lacks some Ribbon tabs, such as Design and Mailings. Mailings allows users to print envelopes and labels and manage mail merge printing of Word documents. Word for the web is not able to edit certain objects, such as: equations, shapes, text boxes or drawings, but a placeholder may be present in the document. Certain advanced features like table sorting or columns will not be displayed but are preserved as they were in the document. Other views available in the Word desktop app (Outline, Draft, Web Layout, and Full-Screen Reading) are not available, nor are side-by-side viewing, split windows, and the ruler.

==Reception==

Initial releases of Word were met with criticism. Byte in 1984 criticized the documentation for Word 1.1 and 2.0 for DOS, calling it &quot;a complete farce&quot;. It called the software &quot;clever, put together well and performs some extraordinary feats&quot;, but concluded that &quot;especially when operated with the mouse, has many more limitations than benefits... extremely frustrating to learn and operate efficiently&quot;. &quot;PC Magazine&quot; review was very mixed, stating: &quot;I&#x27;ve run into weird word processors before, but this is the first time one&#x27;s nearly knocked me down for the count&quot; but acknowledging that Word&#x27;s innovations were the first that caused the reviewer to consider abandoning WordStar. While the review cited an excellent WYSIWYG display, sophisticated print formatting, windows, and footnoting as merits, it criticized many small flaws, very slow performance, and &quot;documentation produced by Madame Sadie&#x27;s Pain Palace&quot;. It concluded that Word was &quot;two releases away from potential greatness&quot;.

&quot;Compute!&#x27;s Apple Applications&quot; in 1987 stated that &quot;despite a certain awkwardness&quot;, Word 3.01 &quot;will likely become the major Macintosh word processor&quot; with &quot;far too many features to list here&quot;. While criticizing the lack of true WYSIWYG, the magazine concluded that &quot;&quot;Word&quot; is marvelous. It&#x27;s like a Mozart or Edison, whose occasional gaucherie we excuse because of his great gifts&quot;.

&quot;Compute!&quot; in 1989 stated that Word 5.0&#x27;s integration of text and graphics made it &quot;a solid engine for basic desktop publishing&quot;. The magazine approved of improvements to text mode, described the $75 price for upgrading from an earlier version as &quot;the deal of the decade&quot; and concluded that &quot;as a high-octane word processor, &quot;Word&quot; is worth a look&quot;.

During the first quarter of 1996, Microsoft Word accounted for 80% of the worldwide word processing market.

In 2013, Microsoft added Word to the new Office 365 product, where Microsoft has combined their most popular software, which is a cloud based computing software that is subscription-based to compete with Google Docs.

<text>Microsoft Office, MS Office, or simply Office, is an office suite and family of client software, server software, and services developed by Microsoft. The first version of the Office suite, announced by Bill Gates on August 1, 1988 at COMDEX, contained Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft PowerPoint — all three of which remain core products in Office — and over time Office applications have grown substantially closer with shared features such as a common spell checker, Object Linking and Embedding data integration and Visual Basic for Applications scripting language. Microsoft also positions Office as a development platform for line-of-business software under the Office Business Applications brand.

The suite currently includes a word processor (Word), a spreadsheet program (Excel), a presentation program (PowerPoint), a notetaking program (OneNote), an email client (Outlook) and a file-hosting service client (OneDrive). The Windows version includes a database management system (Access). Office is produced in several versions targeted towards different end-users and computing environments. The original, and most widely used version, is the desktop version, available for PCs running the Windows and macOS operating systems, and sold at retail or under volume licensing. Microsoft also maintains mobile apps for Android and iOS, as well as Office on the web, a version of the software that runs within a web browser, which are offered freely.

Since Office 2013, Microsoft has promoted Office 365 as the primary means of obtaining Microsoft Office: it allows the use of the software and other services on a subscription business model, and users receive feature updates to the software for the lifetime of the subscription, including new features and cloud computing integration that are not necessarily included in the &quot;on-premises&quot; releases of Office sold under conventional license terms. In 2017, revenue from Office 365 overtook conventional license sales. Microsoft also rebranded most of their standard Office 365 editions as &quot;Microsoft 365&quot; to reflect their inclusion of features and services beyond the core Microsoft Office suite. Although Microsoft announced that it was to phase out the Microsoft Office brand in favor of Microsoft 365 by 2023, with the name continuing only for legacy product offerings, later that year it reversed this decision and announced Office 2024, which they released in September 2024.

==Components==
===Core apps and services===
* Microsoft Word is a word processor included in Microsoft Office and some editions of the now-discontinued Microsoft Works. The first version of Word, released in the autumn of 1983, was for the MS-DOS operating system and introduced the computer mouse to more users. Word 1.0 could be purchased with a bundled mouse, though none was required. Following the precedents of LisaWrite and MacWrite, Word for Macintosh attempted to add closer WYSIWYG features into its package. Word for Mac was released in 1985. Word for Mac was the first graphical version of Microsoft Word. Initially, it implemented the proprietary .doc format as its primary format. Word 2007, however, deprecated this format in favor of Office Open XML, which was later standardized by Ecma International as an open format. Support for Portable Document Format (PDF) and OpenDocument (ODF) was first introduced in Word for Windows with Service Pack 2 for Word 2007.
* Microsoft Excel is a spreadsheet editor that originally competed with the dominant Lotus 1-2-3 and eventually outsold it. Microsoft released the first version of Excel for the Mac OS in 1985 and the first Windows version (numbered 2.05 to line up with the Mac) in November 1987.
* Microsoft PowerPoint is a presentation program used to create slideshows composed of text, graphics, and other objects, which can be displayed on-screen and shown by the presenter or printed out on transparencies or slides.
* Microsoft OneNote is a notetaking program that gathers handwritten or typed notes, drawings, screen clippings and audio commentaries. Notes can be shared with other OneNote users over the Internet or a network. OneNote was initially introduced as a standalone app that was not included in any Microsoft Office 2003 edition. However, OneNote eventually became a core component of Microsoft Office; with the release of Microsoft Office 2013, OneNote was included in all Microsoft Office offerings. OneNote is also available as a web app on Office on the web, a freemium (and later freeware) Windows desktop app, a mobile app for Windows Phone, iOS, Android, and Symbian, and a Metro-style app for Windows 8 or later.
* Microsoft Outlook (not to be confused with Outlook Express, Outlook.com or Outlook on the web) is a personal information manager that replaces Windows Messaging, Microsoft Mail, and Schedule+ starting in Office 97; it includes an e-mail client, calendar, task manager and address book. On the Mac OS, Microsoft offered several versions of Outlook in the late 1990s, but only for use with Microsoft Exchange Server. In Office 2001, it introduced an alternative application with a slightly different feature set called Microsoft Entourage. It reintroduced Outlook in Office 2011, replacing Entourage.
* Microsoft OneDrive is a file hosting service that allows users to sync files and later access them from a web browser or mobile device.
* Microsoft Teams is a platform that combines workplace chat, meetings, notes, and attachments.

===Windows-only apps===
* Microsoft Publisher is a desktop publishing app for Windows mostly used for designing brochures, labels, calendars, greeting cards, business cards, newsletters, web sites, and postcards. Publisher will be discontinued in 2026.
* Microsoft Access is a database management system for Windows that combines the relational Access Database Engine (formerly Jet Database Engine) with a graphical user interface and software development tools. Microsoft Access stores data in its own format based on the Access Database Engine. It can also import or link directly to data stored in other applications and databases.
* Microsoft Project is a project management app for Windows to keep track of events and to create network charts and Gantt charts, not bundled in any Office suite.
* Microsoft Visio is a diagram and flowcharting app for Windows not bundled in any Office suite.

===Mobile-only apps===
* Office Lens is an image scanner optimized for mobile devices. It captures the document (e.g. business card, paper, whiteboard) via the camera and then straightens the document portion of the image. The result can be exported to Word, OneNote, PowerPoint or Outlook, or saved in OneDrive, sent via Mail or placed in Photo Library.
* Office Mobile is a unified Office mobile app for Android and iOS, which combines Word, Excel, and PowerPoint into a single app and introduces new capabilities as making quick notes, signing PDFs, scanning QR codes, and transferring files.
* Office Remote is an application that turns the mobile device into a remote control for desktop versions of Word, Excel and PowerPoint.

===Server applications===
* Microsoft SharePoint is a web-based collaborative platform that integrates with Microsoft Office. Launched in 2001, SharePoint is primarily sold as a document management and storage system, but the product is highly configurable and usage varies substantially among organizations. SharePoint services include:
** Excel Services is a spreadsheet editing server similar to Microsoft Excel.
** InfoPath Forms Services is a form distribution server similar to Microsoft InfoPath.
** Microsoft Project Server is a project management server similar to Microsoft Project.
** Microsoft Search Server
* Skype for Business Server is a real-time communications server for instant messaging and video-conferencing.
* Microsoft Exchange Server is a mail server and calendaring server.

===Web services===
* Microsoft Sway is a presentation web app released in October 2014. It also has a native app for iOS and Windows 10.
* Delve is a service that allows Office 365 users to search and manage their emails, meetings, contacts, social networks and documents stored on OneDrive or Sites in Office 365.
* Microsoft Forms is an online survey creator, available for Office 365 Education subscribers.
* Microsoft To Do is a task management service.
* Outlook.com is a free webmail with a user interface similar to Microsoft Outlook.
* Outlook on the web is a webmail client similar to Outlook.com but more comprehensive and available only through Office 365 and Microsoft Exchange Server offerings.
* Microsoft Planner is a planning application available on the Microsoft Office 365 platform.
* Microsoft Stream is a corporate video sharing service for enterprise users with an Office 365 Academic or Enterprise license.
* Microsoft Bookings is an appointment booking application on the Microsoft Office 365 platform.

==Office on the web==

Office on the web is a free lightweight web version of Microsoft Office and primarily includes three web applications: Word, Excel and PowerPoint. The offering also includes Outlook.com, OneNote and OneDrive which are accessible through a unified app switcher. Users can install the on-premises version of this service, called Office Online Server, in private clouds in conjunction with SharePoint, Microsoft Exchange Server and Microsoft Lync Server.

Word, Excel, and PowerPoint on the web can all natively open, edit, and save Office Open XML files (docx, xlsx, pptx) as well as OpenDocument files (odt, ods, odp). They can also open the older Office file formats (doc, xls, ppt), but will be converted to the newer Open XML formats if the user wishes to edit them online. Other formats cannot be opened in the browser apps, such as CSV in Excel or HTML in Word, nor can Office files that are encrypted with a password be opened. Files with macros can be opened in the browser apps, but the macros cannot be accessed or executed. Starting in July 2013, Word can render PDF documents or convert them to Microsoft Word documents, although the formatting of the document may deviate from the original. Since November 2013, the apps have supported real-time co-authoring and autosaving files.

Office on the web lacks a number of the advanced features present in the full desktop versions of Office, including lacking the programs Access and Publisher entirely. However, users are able to select the command &quot;Open in Desktop App&quot; that brings up the document in the desktop version of Office on their computer or device to utilize the advanced features there.

Supported web browsers include Microsoft [New] Edge, the latest versions of Firefox or Google Chrome, as well as Safari 16 or later.

The Personal edition of Office on the web is available to the general public free of charge with a Microsoft account through the Office.com website, which superseded SkyDrive (now OneDrive) and Office Live Workspace. Enterprise-managed versions are available through Office 365. In February 2013, the ability to view and edit files on SkyDrive without signing in was added. The service can also be installed privately in enterprise environments as a SharePoint app, or through Office Web Apps Server. Microsoft also offers other web apps in the Office suite, such as the Outlook Web App (formerly Outlook Web Access), Lync Web App (formerly Office Communicator Web Access), Project Web App (formerly Project Web Access). Additionally, Microsoft offers a service under the name of Online Doc Viewer to view Office documents on a website via Office on the web.

==Common features==
Most versions of Microsoft Office (including Office 97 and later) use their own widget set and do not exactly match the native operating system. This is most apparent in Microsoft Office XP and 2003, where the standard menus were replaced with a colored, flat-looking, shadowed menu style.

The user interface of a particular version of Microsoft Office often heavily influences a subsequent version of Microsoft Windows. E.g.:-
* The toolbar, colored buttons and the gray-colored 3D look of Office 4.3 were added to Windows 95.
* The ribbon, introduced in Office 2007, has been incorporated into several programs bundled with Windows 7 and later.
* The flat, box-like design of Office 2013 (released in 2012) was replicated in Windows 8&#x27;s new UI revamp.

Users of Microsoft Office may access external data via connection-specifications saved in Office Data Connection (.odc) files.

Office, on all platforms, supports editing both server files (in real time) and offline files (manually saved) in recent years. The support for editing server files (in real time) was originally introduced (in its current form) after the introduction of OneDrive (formerly SkyDrive). But, older versions of Office also have the ability to edit server files (notably Office 2007).

Both Windows and Office used service packs to update software. Office had non-cumulative service releases, which were discontinued after Office 2000 Service Release 1. Now, Windows and Office have shifted to predictable (monthly, semi-annual and annual) release schemes to update software.

Past versions of Office often contained Easter eggs. For example, Excel 97 contained a reasonably functional flight-simulator.

==File formats and metadata==
Microsoft Office prior to Office 2007 used proprietary file formats based on the OLE Compound File Binary Format. This forced users who share data to adopt the same software platform. In 2008, Microsoft made the entire documentation for the binary Office formats freely available for download and granted any possible patents rights for use or implementations of those binary format for free under the Open Specification Promise. Previously, Microsoft had supplied such documentation freely but only on request.

Starting with Office 2007, the default file format has been a version of Office Open XML, though different from the one standardized and published by Ecma International and by ISO/IEC. Microsoft has granted patent rights to the formats technology under the Open Specification Promise and has made available free downloadable converters for previous versions of Microsoft Office including Office 2003, Office XP, Office 2000 and Office 2004 for Mac OS X. Third-party implementations of Office Open XML exist on the Windows platform (LibreOffice, all platforms), macOS platform (iWork &#x27;08, NeoOffice, LibreOffice) and Linux (LibreOffice and OpenOffice.org 3.0). In addition, Office 2010, Service Pack 2 for Office 2007, and Office 2016 for Mac supports the OpenDocument Format (ODF) for opening and saving documents – only the old ODF 1.0 (2006 ISO/IEC standard) is supported, not the 1.2 version (2015 ISO/IEC standard).

Microsoft provides the ability to remove metadata from Office documents. This was in response to highly publicized incidents where sensitive data about a document was leaked via its metadata. Metadata removal was first available in 2004, when Microsoft released a tool called &quot;Remove Hidden Data Add-in for Office 2003/XP&quot; for this purpose. It was directly integrated into Office 2007 in a feature called the &quot;Document Inspector&quot;.

==Extensibility==
A major feature of the Office suite is the ability for users and third-party companies to write add-ins (plug-ins) that extend the capabilities of an application by adding custom commands and specialized features. One of the new features is the Office Store. Plugins and other tools can be downloaded by users. Developers can make money by selling their applications in the Office Store. The revenue is divided between the developer and Microsoft where the developer gets 80% of the money. Developers are able to share applications with all Office users.

The app travels with the document, and it is for the developer to decide what the recipient will see when they open it. The recipient will either have the option to download the app from the Office Store for free, start a free trial or be directed to payment.
With Office&#x27;s cloud abilities, IT departments can create a set of apps for their business employees in order to increase their productivity. When employees go to the Office Store, they&#x27;ll see their company&#x27;s apps under &quot;My Organization&quot;. The apps that employees have personally downloaded will appear under &quot;My Apps&quot;. Developers can use web technologies like HTML5, XML, CSS3, JavaScript, and APIs for building the apps.
An application for Office is a webpage that is hosted inside an Office client application. Users can use apps to amplify the functionality of a document, email message, meeting request, or appointment. Apps can run in multiple environments and by multiple clients, including rich Office desktop clients, Office Web Apps, mobile browsers, and also on-premises and in the cloud. The type of add-ins supported differ by Office versions:
* Office 97 onwards (standard Windows DLLs i.e. Word WLLs and Excel XLLs)
* Office 2000 onwards (COM add-ins)
* Office XP onwards (COM/OLE Automation add-ins)
* Office 2003 onwards (Managed code add-ins – VSTO solutions)

==Password protection==

Microsoft Office has a security feature that allows users to encrypt Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Access, Skype Business) documents with a user-provided password. The password can contain up to 255 characters and uses AES 128-bit advanced encryption by default. Passwords can also be used to restrict modification of the entire document, worksheet or presentation. Due to lack of document encryption, though, these passwords can be removed using a third-party cracking software.

==Support policies==

=== Approach ===
All versions of Microsoft Office products from Office 2000 to Office 2016 are eligible for ten years of support following their release, during which Microsoft releases security updates for the product version and provides paid technical support. The ten-year period is divided into two five-year phases: The mainstream phase and the extended phase. During the mainstream phase, Microsoft may provide limited complimentary technical support and release non-security updates or change the design of the product. During the extended phase, said services stop. Office 2019 only receives 5 years of mainstream and 2 years of extended support and Office 2021 only gets 5 years of mainstream support.

=== Timelines of support ===


== Platforms ==
Microsoft supports Office for the Windows and macOS platforms, as well as mobile versions for Windows Phone, Android and iOS platforms. Beginning with Mac Office 4.2, the macOS and Windows versions of Office share the same file format, and are interoperable. Visual Basic for Applications support was dropped in Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac, then reintroduced in Office for Mac 2011.

Microsoft tried in the mid-1990s to port Office to RISC processors such as NEC/MIPS and IBM/PowerPC, but they met problems such as memory access being hampered by data structure alignment requirements. Microsoft Word 97 and Excel 97, however, did ship for the DEC Alpha platform. Difficulties in porting Office may have been a factor in discontinuing Windows NT on non-Intel platforms.

==Pricing model and editions==
The Microsoft Office applications and suites are sold via retail channels, and volume licensing for larger organizations (also including the &quot;Home Use Program&quot;. allowing users at participating organizations to buy low-cost licenses for use on their personal devices as part of their employer&#x27;s volume license agreement).

In 2010, Microsoft introduced a software as a service platform known as Office 365, to provide cloud-hosted versions of Office&#x27;s server software, including Exchange e-mail and SharePoint, on a subscription basis (competing in particular with Google Apps). Following the release of Office 2013, Microsoft began to offer Office 365 plans for the consumer market, with access to Microsoft Office software on multiple devices with free feature updates over the life of the subscription, as well as other services such as OneDrive storage.

Microsoft has since promoted Office 365 as the primary means of purchasing Microsoft Office. Although there are still &quot;on-premises&quot; releases roughly every three years, Microsoft marketing emphasizes that they do not receive new features or access to new cloud-based services as they are released unlike Office 365, as well as other benefits for consumer and business markets. Office 365 revenue overtook traditional license sales for Office in 2017.

=== Editions ===
Microsoft Office is available in several editions, which regroup a given number of applications for a specific price. Primarily, Microsoft sells Office as Microsoft 365. The editions are as follows:

* Microsoft 365 Personal
* Microsoft 365 Family
* Microsoft 365 Business Basic
* Microsoft 365 Business Standard
* Microsoft 365 Business Premium

== Criticism ==

=== Data formats ===
Microsoft Office has been criticized in the past for using proprietary file formats rather than open standards, which forces users who share data into adopting the same software platform. However, on February 15, 2008, Microsoft made the entire documentation for the binary Office formats freely available under the Open Specification Promise. Also, Office Open XML, the document format for the latest versions of Office for Windows and Mac, has been standardized under both Ecma International and ISO. Ecma International has published the Office Open XML specification free of copyrights and Microsoft has granted patent rights to the formats technology under the Open Specification Promise and has made available free downloadable converters for previous versions of Microsoft Office including Office 2003, Office XP, Office 2000 and Office 2004 for the Mac. Third-party implementations of Office Open XML exist on the Mac platform (iWork 08) and Linux (OpenOffice.org 2.3 – Novell Edition only).

=== Unicode and bi-directional texts ===
Another point of criticism Microsoft Office has faced was the lack of support in its Mac versions for Unicode and Bidirectional text languages, notably Arabic and Hebrew. This issue, which had existed since the first release in 1989, was addressed in the 2016 version.

=== Privacy ===
On November 13, 2018, a report initiated by the Government of the Netherlands concluded that Microsoft Office 2016 and Office 365 do not comply with GDPR, the European law which regulates data protection and privacy for all citizens in and outside the EU and EFTA region. The investigation was initiated by the observation that Microsoft does not reveal or share publicly any data collected about users of its software. In addition, the company does not provide users of its (Office) software an option to turn off diagnostic and telemetry data sent back to the company. Researchers found that most of the data that the Microsoft software collects and &quot;sends home&quot; is diagnostics. Researchers also observed that Microsoft &quot;seemingly tried to make the system GDPR compliant by storing Office documents on servers based in the EU&quot;. However, they discovered the software packages collected additional data that contained private user information, some of which was stored on servers located in the US. The Netherlands Ministry of Justice hired Privacy Company to probe and evaluate the use of Microsoft Office products in the public sector. &quot;Microsoft systematically collects data on a large scale about the individual use of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook. Covertly, without informing people&quot;, researchers of the Privacy Company stated in their blog post. &quot;Microsoft does not offer any choice with regard to the amount of data, or possibility to switch off the collection, or ability to see what data are collected, because the data stream is encoded.&quot;

The researchers commented that there is no need for Microsoft to store information such as IPs and email addresses, which are collected automatically by the software. &quot;Microsoft should not store these transient, functional data, unless the retention is strictly necessary, for example, for security purposes&quot;, the researchers conclude in the final report by the Netherlands Ministry of Justice.

As a result of this in-depth study and its conclusions, the Netherlands regulatory body concluded that Microsoft has violated GDPR &quot;on many counts&quot; including &quot;lack of transparency and purpose limitation, and the lack of a legal ground for the processing.&quot; Microsoft has provided the Dutch authorities with an &quot;improvement plan&quot; that should satisfy Dutch regulators that it &quot;would end all violations&quot;. The Dutch regulatory body is monitoring the situation and states that &quot;If progress is deemed insufficient or if the improvements offered are unsatisfactory, SLM Microsoft Rijk will reconsider its position and may ask the Dutch Data Protection Authority to carry out a prior consultation and to impose enforcement measures.&quot; When asked for a response by an IT professional publication, a Microsoft spokesperson stated: &quot;We are committed to our customers’ privacy, putting them in control of their data and ensuring that Office ProPlus and other Microsoft products and services comply with GDPR and other applicable laws. We appreciate the opportunity to discuss our diagnostic data handling practices in Office ProPlus with the Dutch Ministry of Justice and look forward to a successful resolution of any concerns.&quot; The user privacy data issue affects ProPlus subscriptions of Microsoft Office 2016 and Microsoft Office 365, including the online version of Microsoft Office 365.

== History of releases ==

==Version history==
===Windows versions===
====Microsoft Office for Windows====
Microsoft Office for Windows started in October 1990 as a bundle of three applications designed for Microsoft Windows 3.0: Microsoft Word for Windows 1.1, Microsoft Excel for Windows 2.0, and Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 2.0.

Microsoft Office for Windows 1.5 updated the suite with Microsoft Excel 3.0.

Version 1.6 added Microsoft Mail for PC Networks 2.1 to the bundle.

====Microsoft Office 3.0====
Microsoft Office 3.0, also called Microsoft Office 92, was released on August 30, 1992, and contained Word 2.0, Excel 4.0, PowerPoint 3.0 and Mail 3.0. It was the first version of Office also released on CD-ROM. In 1993, Microsoft Office Professional was released, which added Microsoft Access 1.1.

====Microsoft Office 4.x====
Microsoft Office 4.0 was released containing Word 6.0, Excel 4.0a, PowerPoint 3.0 and Mail in 1993. Word&#x27;s version number jumped from 2.0 to 6.0 so that it would have the same version number as the MS-DOS and Macintosh versions (Excel and PowerPoint were already numbered the same as the Macintosh versions).

Microsoft Office 4.2 for Windows NT was released in 1994 for i386, Alpha, MIPS and PowerPC architectures, containing Word 6.0 and Excel 5.0 (both 32-bit), PowerPoint 4.0 (16-bit), and Microsoft Office Manager 4.2 (the precursor to the Office Shortcut Bar)).
====Microsoft Office 95====
Microsoft Office 95 was released on August 24, 1995. Software version numbers were altered again to create parity across the suiteevery program was called version 7.0 meaning all but Word missed out versions. Office 95 included new components to the suite such as Schedule+ and Binder. Office for Windows 95 was designed as a fully 32-bit version to match Windows 95 although some apps not bundled as part of the suite at that time - Publisher for Windows 95 and Project 95 had some 16-bit components even though their main program executable was 32-bit.

Office 95 was available in two versions, Office 95 Standard and Office 95 Professional. The standard version consisted of Word 7.0, Excel 7.0, PowerPoint 7.0, and Schedule+ 7.0. The professional edition contained all of the items in the standard version plus Access 7.0. If the professional version was purchased in CD-ROM form, it also included Bookshelf.

The logo used in Office 95 returns in Office 97, 2000 and XP. Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition also uses a similar logo.

==== Microsoft Office 97 ====
Microsoft Office 97 (Office 8.0) included hundreds of new features and improvements, such as introducing command bars, a paradigm in which menus and toolbars were made more similar in capability and visual design. Office 97 also featured Natural Language Systems and grammar checking. Office 97 featured new components to the suite including FrontPage 97, Expedia Streets 98 (in Small Business Edition), and Internet Explorer 3.0 &amp; 4.0.

Office 97 was the first version of Office to include the Office Assistant. In Brazil, it was also the first version to introduce the Registration Wizard, a precursor to Microsoft Product Activation. With this release, the accompanying apps, Project 98 and Publisher 98 also transitioned to fully 32-bit versions. Exchange Server, a mail server and calendaring server developed by Microsoft, is the server for Outlook after discontinuing Exchange Client.

====Microsoft Office 2000====
Microsoft Office 2000 (Office 9.0) introduced adaptive menus, where little-used options were hidden from the user. It also introduced a new security feature, built around digital signatures, to diminish the threat of macro viruses. The Microsoft Script Editor, an optional tool that can edit script code, was also introduced in Office 2000. Office 2000 automatically trusts macros (written in VBA 6) that were digitally signed from authors who have been previously designated as trusted. Office 2000 also introduces PhotoDraw, a raster and vector imaging program, as well as Web Components, Visio, and Vizact.

The Registration Wizard, a precursor to Microsoft Product Activation, remained in Brazil and was also extended to Australia and New Zealand, though not for volume-licensed editions. Academic software in the United States and Canada also featured the Registration Wizard.

==== Microsoft Office XP ====
Microsoft Office XP (Office 10.0 or Office 2002) was released in conjunction with Windows XP, and was a major upgrade with numerous enhancements and changes over Office 2000. Office XP introduced the Safe Mode feature, which allows applications such as Outlook to boot when it might otherwise fail by bypassing a corrupted registry or a faulty add-in. Smart tag is a technology introduced with Office XP in Word and Excel and discontinued in Office 2010.

Office XP also introduces new components including Document Imaging, Document Scanning, Clip Organizer, MapPoint, and Data Analyzer. Binder was replaced by Unbind, a program that can extract the contents of a Binder file. Unbind can be installed from the Office XP CD-ROM.

Office XP includes integrated voice command and text dictation capabilities, as well as handwriting recognition. It was the first version to require Microsoft Product Activation worldwide and in all editions as an anti-piracy measure, which attracted widespread controversy. Product Activation remained absent from Office for Mac releases until it was introduced in Office 2011 for Mac.

==== Microsoft Office 2003 ====
Microsoft Office 2003 (Office 11.0) was released in 2003. It featured a new logo. Two new applications made their debut in Office 2003: Microsoft InfoPath and OneNote. It is the first version to use new, more colorful icons. Outlook 2003 provides improved functionality in many areas, including Kerberos authentication, RPC over HTTP, Cached Exchange Mode, and an improved junk mail filter.

Office 2003 introduces three new programs to the Office product lineup: InfoPath, a program for designing, filling, and submitting electronic structured data forms; OneNote, a note-taking program for creating and organizing diagrams, graphics, handwritten notes, recorded audio, and text; and the Picture Manager graphics software which can open, manage, and share digital images.

SharePoint, a web collaboration platform codenamed as Office Server, has integration and compatibility with Office 2003 and so on.

====Microsoft Office 2007====
Microsoft Office 2007 (Office 12.0) was released in 2007. Office 2007&#x27;s new features include a new graphical user interface called the Fluent User Interface, replacing the menus and toolbars that have been the cornerstone of Office since its inception with a tabbed toolbar, known as the Ribbon; new XML-based file formats called Office Open XML; and the inclusion of Groove, a collaborative software application.

While Microsoft removed Data Analyzer, FrontPage, Vizact, and Schedule+ from Office 2007; they also added Communicator, Groove, SharePoint Designer, and Office Customization Tool (OCT) to the suite.

====Microsoft Office 2010====
Microsoft Office 2010 (Office 14.0, Microsoft skipped 13.0 due to fear of 13) was finalized on April 15, 2010, and made available to consumers on June 15, 2010. The main features of Office 2010 include the backstage file menu, new collaboration tools, a customizable ribbon, protected view and a navigation panel. Office Communicator, an instant messaging and videotelephony application, was renamed into Lync 2010.

This is the first version to ship in 32-bit and 64-bit variants. Microsoft Office 2010 featured a new logo, which resembled the 2007 logo, except in gold, and with a modification in shape. Microsoft released Service Pack 1 for Office 2010 on June 28, 2011 and Service Pack 2 on July 16, 2013. Office Online was first released online along with SkyDrive, an online storing service.

It sports a revamped application interface; the interface is based on Metro, the interface of Windows Phone and Windows 8. Microsoft Outlook has received the most pronounced changes so far; for example, the Metro interface provides a new visualization for scheduled tasks. PowerPoint includes more templates and transition effects, and OneNote includes a new splash screen.

On May 16, 2011, new images of Office 15 were revealed, showing Excel with a tool for filtering data in a timeline, the ability to convert Roman numerals to Arabic numerals, and the integration of advanced trigonometric functions. In Word, the capability of inserting video and audio online as well as the broadcasting of documents on the Web were implemented. Microsoft has promised support for Office Open XML Strict starting with version 15, a format Microsoft has submitted to the ISO for interoperability with other office suites, and to aid adoption in the public sector. This version can read and write ODF 1.2 (Windows only).

===Mac versions===
Prior to packaging its various office-type Mac OS software applications into Office, Microsoft released Mac versions of Word 1.0 in 1984, the first year of the Macintosh computer; Excel 1.0 in 1985; and PowerPoint 1.0 in 1987. Microsoft does not include its Access database application in Office for Mac.

Microsoft has noted that some features are added to Office for Mac before they appear in Windows versions, such as Office for Mac 2001&#x27;s Office Project Gallery and PowerPoint Movie feature, which allows users to save presentations as QuickTime movies. However, Microsoft Office for Mac has been long criticized for its lack of support of Unicode and for its lack of support for right-to-left languages, notably Arabic, Hebrew and Persian.

====Early Office for Mac releases (1989–1994)====
Microsoft Office for Mac was introduced for Mac OS in 1989, before Office was released for Windows. It included Word 4.0, Excel 2.2, PowerPoint 2.01, and Mail 1.37. It was originally a limited-time promotion but later became a regular product. With the release of Office on CD-ROM later that year, Microsoft became the first major Mac publisher to put its applications on CD-ROM.

Microsoft Office 1.5 for Mac was released in 1991 and included the updated Excel 3.0, the first application to support Apple&#x27;s System 7 operating system.

Microsoft Office 3.0 for Mac was released in 1992 and included Word 5.0, Excel 4.0, PowerPoint 3.0 and Mail Client. Excel 4.0 was the first application to support new AppleScript.

Microsoft Office 4.2 for Mac was released in 1994. (Version 4.0 was skipped to synchronize version numbers with Office for Windows) Version 4.2 included Word 6.0, Excel 5.0, PowerPoint 4.0 and Mail 3.2. It was the first Office suite for Power Macintosh. Its user interface was identical to Office 4.2 for Windows leading many customers to comment that it wasn&#x27;t Mac-like enough. The final release for Mac 68K was Office 4.2.1, which updated Word to version 6.0.1, somewhat improving performance.

====Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition====
Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition was unveiled at MacWorld Expo/San Francisco in 1998. It introduced the Internet Explorer 4.0 web browser and Outlook Express, an Internet e-mail client and usenet newsgroup reader. Office 98 was re-engineered by Microsoft&#x27;s Macintosh Business Unit to satisfy customers&#x27; desire for software they felt was more Mac-like. It included drag–and-drop installation, self-repairing applications and Quick Thesaurus, before such features were available in Office for Windows. It also was the first version to support QuickTime movies.

====Microsoft Office 2001 and v. X====

Microsoft Office 2001 was launched in 2000 as the last Office suite for the classic Mac OS. It required a PowerPC processor. This version introduced Entourage, an e-mail client that included information management tools such as a calendar, an address book, task lists and notes.

Microsoft Office v. X was released in 2001 and was the first version of Microsoft Office for Mac OS X. Support for Office v. X ended on January 9, 2007, after the release of the final update, 10.1.9 Office v.X includes Word X, Excel X, PowerPoint X, Entourage X, MSN Messenger for Mac and Windows Media Player 9 for Mac; it was the last version of Office for Mac to include Internet Explorer for Mac.

====Office 2004====
Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac was released on May 11, 2004. It includes Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Entourage and Virtual PC. It is the final version of Office to be built exclusively for PowerPC and to officially support G3 processors, as its sequel lists a G4, G5, or Intel processor as a requirement. It was notable for supporting Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), which is unavailable in Office 2008. This led Microsoft to extend support for Office 2004 from October 13, 2009, to January 10, 2012. VBA functionality was reintroduced in Office 2011, which is only compatible with Intel processors.

====Office 2008====
Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac was released on January 15, 2008. It was the only Office for Mac suite to be compiled as a universal binary, being the first to feature native Intel support and the last to feature PowerPC support for G4 and G5 processors, although the suite is unofficially compatible with G3 processors. New features include native Office Open XML file format support, which debuted in Office 2007 for Windows, and stronger Microsoft Office password protection employing AES-128 and SHA-1. Benchmarks suggested that compared to its predecessor, Office 2008 ran at similar speeds on Intel machines and slower speeds on PowerPC machines. Office 2008 also lacked Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) support, leaving it with only 15 months of additional mainstream support compared to its predecessor. Nevertheless, five months after it was released, Microsoft said that Office 2008 was &quot;selling faster than any previous version of Office for Mac in the past 19 years&quot; and affirmed &quot;its commitment to future products for the Mac.&quot;

====Office 2011====
Microsoft Office for Mac 2011 was released on October 26, 2010. It is the first version of Office for Mac to be compiled exclusively for Intel processors, dropping support for the PowerPC architecture. It features an OS X version of Outlook to replace the Entourage email client. This version of Outlook is intended to make the OS X version of Office work better with Microsoft&#x27;s Exchange server and with those using Office for Windows. Office 2011 includes a Mac-based Ribbon similar to Office for Windows.

====OneNote and Outlook release (2014)====
Microsoft OneNote for Mac was released on March 17, 2014. It marks the company&#x27;s first release of the note-taking software on the Mac. It is available as a free download to all users of the Mac App Store in OS X Mavericks.

Microsoft Outlook 2016 for Mac debuted on October 31, 2014. It requires a paid Office 365 subscription, meaning that traditional Office 2011 retail or volume licenses cannot activate this version of Outlook. On that day, Microsoft confirmed that it would release the next version of Office for Mac in late 2015.

Despite dropping support for older versions of OS X and only keeping support for 64-bit-only versions of OS X, these versions of OneNote and Outlook are 32-bit applications like their predecessors.

====Office 2016====

The first Preview version of Microsoft Office 2016 for Mac was released on March 5, 2015. On July 9, 2015, Microsoft released the final version of Microsoft Office 2016 for Mac which includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and OneNote. It was immediately made available for Office 365 subscribers with either a Home, Personal, Business, Business Premium, E3 or ProPlus subscription. A non–Office 365 edition of Office 2016 was made available as a one-time purchase option on September 22, 2015.

====Office 2019====
====Office 2021====
===Mobile versions===

Office Mobile for iPhone was released on June 14, 2013, in the United States. Support for 135 markets and 27 languages was rolled out over a few days. It requires iOS 8 or later. Although the app also works on iPad devices, excluding the first generation, it is designed for a small screen. Office Mobile was released for Android phones on July 31, 2013, in the United States. Support for 117 markets and 33 languages was added gradually over several weeks. It is supported on Android 4.0 and later.

Office Mobile is or was also available, though no longer supported, on Windows Mobile, Windows Phone and Symbian. Windows RT devices (such as Microsoft Surface) were bundled with &quot;Office RT&quot;, a port of the PC version of Office 2013 to ARM architecture. The applications contain most of the functionality available in their versions for Intel-compatible PCs, but some features have been removed.

====Early Office Mobile releases====
Originally called Office Mobile which was shipped initially as &quot;Pocket Office&quot;, was released by Microsoft with the Windows CE 1.0 operating system in 1996. This release was specifically for the Handheld PC hardware platform, as Windows Mobile Smartphone and Pocket PC hardware specifications had not yet been released. It consisted of Pocket Word and Pocket Excel; PowerPoint, Access, and Outlook were added later. With steady updates throughout subsequent releases of Windows Mobile, Office Mobile was rebranded as its current name after the release of the Windows Mobile 5.0 operating system. This release of Office Mobile also included PowerPoint Mobile for the first time. Accompanying the release of Microsoft OneNote 2007, a new optional addition to the Office Mobile line of programs was released as OneNote Mobile. With the release of Windows Mobile 6 Standard, Office Mobile became available for the Smartphone hardware platform, but unlike Office Mobile for the Professional and Classic versions of Windows Mobile, creation of new documents is not an added feature. A popular workaround is to create a new blank document in a desktop version of Office, synchronize it to the device, and then edit and save on the Windows Mobile device.

In June 2007, Microsoft announced a new version of the office suite, Office Mobile 2007. It became available as &quot;Office Mobile 6.1&quot; on September 26, 2007, as a free upgrade download to current Windows Mobile 5.0 and 6 users. However, &quot;Office Mobile 6.1 Upgrade&quot; is not compatible with Windows Mobile 5.0 powered devices running builds earlier than 14847. It is a pre-installed feature in subsequent releases of Windows Mobile 6 devices. Office Mobile 6.1 is compatible with the Office Open XML specification like its desktop counterpart.

On August 12, 2009, it was announced that Office Mobile would also be released for the Symbian platform as a joint agreement between Microsoft and Nokia. It was the first time Microsoft would develop Office mobile applications for another smartphone platform. The first application to appear on Nokia Eseries smartphones was Microsoft Office Communicator. In February 2012, Microsoft released OneNote, Lync 2010, Document Connection and PowerPoint Broadcast for Symbian. In April, Word Mobile, PowerPoint Mobile and Excel Mobile joined the Office Suite.

On October 21, 2010, Microsoft debuted Office Mobile 2010 with the release of Windows Phone 7. In Windows Phone, users can access and edit documents directly off of their SkyDrive or Office 365 accounts in a dedicated Office hub. The Office Hub, which is preinstalled into the operating system, contains Word, PowerPoint and Excel. The operating system also includes OneNote, although not as a part of the Office Hub. Lync is not included, but can be downloaded as standalone app from the Windows Phone Store free of charge.

In October 2012, Microsoft released a new version of Microsoft Office Mobile for Windows Phone 8 and Windows Phone 7.8.

====Office for Android, iOS and Windows 10 Mobile====
Office Mobile was released for iPhone on June 14, 2013, and for Android phones on July 31, 2013.

In March 2014, Microsoft released Office Lens, a scanner app that enhances photos. Photos are then attached to an Office document. Office Lens is an app in the Windows Phone store, as well as built into the camera functionality in the OneNote apps for iOS and Windows 8.
On March 27, 2014, Microsoft launched Office for iPad, the first dedicated version of Office for tablet computers. In addition, Microsoft made the Android and iOS versions of Office Mobile free for &#x27;home use&#x27; on phones, although the company still requires an Office 365 subscription for using Office Mobile for business use. On November 6, 2014, Office was subsequently made free for personal use on the iPad in addition to phones. As part of this announcement, Microsoft also split up its single &quot;Office suite&quot; app on iPhones into separate, standalone apps for Word, Excel and PowerPoint, released a revamped version of Office Mobile for iPhone, added direct integration with Dropbox, and previewed future versions of Office for other platforms.

Office for Android tablets was released on January 29, 2015, following a successful two-month preview period. These apps allow users to edit and create documents for free on devices with screen sizes of 10.1 inches or less, though as with the iPad versions, an Office 365 subscription is required to unlock premium features and for commercial use of the apps. Tablets with screen sizes larger than 10.1 inches are also supported, but, as was originally the case with the iPad version, are restricted to viewing documents only unless a valid Office 365 subscription is used to enable editing and document creation.

On January 21, 2015, during the &quot;Windows 10: The Next Chapter&quot; press event, Microsoft unveiled Office for Windows 10, Windows Runtime ports of the Android and iOS versions of the Office Mobile suite. Optimized for smartphones and tablets, they are universal apps that can run on both Windows and Windows for phones, and share similar underlying code. A simplified version of Outlook was also added to the suite. They will be bundled with Windows 10 mobile devices, and available from the Windows Store for the PC version of Windows 10. Although the preview versions were free for most editing, the release versions will require an Office 365 subscription on larger tablets (screen size larger than 10.1 inches) and desktops for editing, as with large Android tablets. Smaller tablets and phones will have most editing features for free.

On June 24, 2015, Microsoft released Word, Excel and PowerPoint as standalone apps on Google Play for Android phones, following a one-month preview. These apps have also been bundled with Android devices from major OEMs, as a result of Microsoft tying distribution of them and Skype to patent-licensing agreements related to the Android platform. The Android version is also supported on certain ChromeOS machines.

On February 19, 2020, Microsoft announced a new unified Office mobile app for Android and iOS. This app combines Word, Excel, and PowerPoint into a single app and introduces new capabilities as making quick notes, signing PDFs, scanning QR codes, and transferring files.

===Online versions===
Office Web Apps was first revealed in October 2008 at PDC 2008 in Los Angeles. Chris Capossela, senior vice president of Microsoft business division, introduced Office Web Apps as lightweight versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote that allow people to create, edit and collaborate on Office documents through a web browser. According to Capossela, Office Web Apps was to become available as a part of Office Live Workspace. Office Web Apps was announced to be powered by AJAX as well as Silverlight; however, the latter is optional and its availability will only &quot;enhance the user experience, resulting in sharper images and improved rendering.&quot; Microsoft&#x27;s Business Division President Stephen Elop stated during PDC 2008 that &quot;a technology preview of Office Web Apps would become available later in 2008&quot;. However, the Technical Preview of Office Web Apps was not released until 2009.

On July 13, 2009, Microsoft announced at its Worldwide Partners Conference 2009 in New Orleans that Microsoft Office 2010 reached its &quot;Technical Preview&quot; development milestone and features of Office Web Apps were demonstrated to the public for the first time. Additionally, Microsoft announced that Office Web Apps would be made available to consumers online and free of charge, while Microsoft Software Assurance customers will have the option of running them on premises. Office 2010 beta testers were not given access to Office Web Apps at this date, and it was announced that it would be available for testers during August 2009. However, in August 2009, a Microsoft spokesperson stated that there had been a delay in the release of Office Web Apps Technical Preview and it would not be available by the end of August.

Microsoft officially released the Technical Preview of Office Web Apps on September 17, 2009. Office Web Apps was made available to selected testers via its OneDrive (at the time Skydrive) service. The final version of Office Web Apps was made available to the public via Windows Live Office on June 7, 2010.

On October 22, 2012, Microsoft announced the release of new features including co-authoring, performance improvements and touch support.

On November 6, 2013, Microsoft announced further new features including &quot;real-time&quot; co-authoring and an Auto-Save feature in Word (replacing the save button).

In February 2014, Office Web Apps were re-branded Office Online and incorporated into other Microsoft web services, including Calendar, OneDrive, Outlook.com, and People. Microsoft had previously attempted to unify its online services suite (including Microsoft Passport, Hotmail, MSN Messenger, and later SkyDrive) under a brand known as Windows Live, first launched in 2005. However, with the impending launch of Windows 8 and its increased use of cloud services, Microsoft dropped the Windows Live brand to emphasize that these services would now be built directly into Windows and not merely be a &quot;bolted on&quot; add-on. Critics had criticized the Windows Live brand for having no clear vision, as it was being applied to an increasingly broad array of unrelated services. At the same time, Windows Live Hotmail was re-launched as Outlook.com (sharing its name with the Microsoft Outlook personal information manager).

In July 2019, Microsoft announced that they were retiring the &quot;Online&quot; branding for Office Online. The product is now Office, and may be referred to as &quot;Office for the web&quot; or &quot;Office in a browser&quot;.

<text>MultiMate was a word processor developed by Multimate International for IBM PC MS-DOS computers in the early 1980s.

==History==
With 1,000 computers, Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance was one of the first large-volume customers for the IBM PC. It hired W. H. Jones &amp; Associates to write word-processing software for the computer that would not require retraining its employees, already familiar with Wang Laboratories word processing systems. W. H. Jones&#x27; head Will Jones and five other developers created the software. W. H. Jones retained the right to sell the program elsewhere, and WordMate appeared in December 1982. The company renamed itself to SoftWord Systems, then Multimate International, while renaming WordMate to MultiMate. Advertisements stated that MultiMate &quot;mimic[ked] the features and functions of a dedicated system&quot;, and that it was &quot;modeled after the Wang word processor&quot;. Like Connecticut Mutual, many customers purchased it because of the similarity with the Wang.

MultiMate was not marketed heavily to end-users, but was quickly popular with insurance companies, law firms, other business computer users and US government agencies and the military. While the Wang WP keyboard was different from the original PC keyboard, MultiMate compensated by providing a large plastic template that clipped on the PC keyboard, and stick-on labels for the fronts of the PC keys. The template and labels color-coded the combination keystrokes using the SHIFT, ALT and CTRL keys with all 10 of the PC&#x27;s function keys and many of the character keys. Like Wang systems, MultiMate controlled most editing operations with function keys, assigning four functions to each of the 10 function keys, which IBM initially located at the left side of the keyboard in two vertical rows. It also included a &quot;document summary&quot; screen for each document, another Wang feature, which allowed more sophisticated document-management than the brief file names allowed by MS-DOS and PC DOS. As function selection through key-controlled screen-top drop-down menus was popularized by other programs, MultiMate added menus.

MultiMate&#x27;s popularity rapidly grew. In January 1983 some employees were paid late because of slow sales, but two months later revenue grew 25-fold after good reviews appeared in magazines. The company&#x27;s fiscal 1984 sales were $15 million or more, and by early 1985 MultiMate&#x27;s installed base in companies was as large as former market leader WordStar&#x27;s. Jones sold the company to Ashton-Tate in December 1985 for about $20 million. An Ashton-Tate press release called the acquisition &quot;the largest ever in the microcomputer software industry&quot;.

Other MultiMate products included foreign language versions of the software (i.e., &quot;MultiTexto&quot; in Spanish), a hardware interface card for file-transfer with Wang systems, a keyboard with extra function keys, versions of MultiMate for different PC clone MS-DOS computers, and for use on PC networks from Novell, 3COM and IBM (Token Ring). Early attempts to create a MultiMate Data Manager and List Manager in-house never reached the market.

Multimate International developed the core word processing software and utilities (file conversion, printer drivers), but purchased and adapted sub-programs for spelling and grammar checking, list management, outlining and print-time incorporation of graphics in word processing documents (MultiMate GraphLink). In addition to rebranding such externally developed programs, Multimate rewrote the documentation for each program and adapted the program interfaces to more closely resemble the word processor. The last version of MultiMate was packaged with many of these add-on programs under the product name &quot;MultiMate Advantage&quot; to compete with other word processor software of the day, especially IBM DisplayWrite for DOS, which Multimate International developers saw as their main competition in the business market, and to a lesser extent WordPerfect, the DOS incarnation of Microsoft Word and the Samna word processor, which had its roots in another office word processing computer.

One of the first &quot;clone&quot; versions of MultiMate was bundled with an early portable PC made by Corona. Other versions were written to match PCs by Radio Shack, Texas Instruments, Toshiba, the early Grid laptop and the IBM PC Junior.

The detailed MultiMate word processor documentation, which quickly grew to three volumes, gave the product a solid &quot;office product&quot; feel, using high-quality paper with its main reference section presented in a padded binder with fold-out easel. (A company legend was that the MultiMate user manual was written first, by an experienced Wang WP manager, then the programmers were told to write software to match it, which is how the Wang WP was created.)

Early versions of the program came with both color-coded key stickers and a plastic full-keyboard template to make Wang operators more comfortable with the smaller IBM PC keyboard. MultiMate eventually sold a hardware keyboard with dedicated function keys and issued versions of its software for networked PCs. It adapted list-management, graphics and outlining software from other vendors to the look-and-feel of MultiMate, shipping the expanded version as MultiMate Advantage, with additional volumes of MultiMate-style documentation for the add-on programs.

Early releases of MultiMate also gave users unlimited access to a toll-free support number and a promise of low-cost upgrades, which contributed to its dedicated user population. Support policies later were brought in line with Ashton-Tate&#x27;s standard practices.

MultiMate was especially good at supporting a variety of PC clones and hundreds of computer printers, each of which required its own printer driver. The company&#x27;s printer support was very strong with daisy-wheel and dot-matrix printers, but did not take much advantage of the development of PostScript fonts and laser printers.

Ashton-Tate never released a Windows version. It discontinued MultiMate&#x27;s development efforts on VMS and Unix platforms and closed a development group in Dublin, Ireland. The product was dropped after the Ashton-Tate itself was purchased by Borland.

==Reception==
&quot;PC Magazine&quot; in February 1983 stated that MultiMate &quot;virtually remakes your computer into a Wang-like dedicated word processor&quot;, and that it was &quot;very fast, easy to learn, and capable&quot; with many features. The review noted the application&#x27;s inability to use more than 128K of RAM, but praised the documentation and built-in help, and stated that many commands required half the keystrokes of the WordStar equivalent. The review concluded &quot;MultiMate stands head and shoulders above many if not most [IBM PC word processors] ... an impressive entrant&quot;.

&quot;BYTE&quot; in 1984 was less positive. It described version 3.20 as being &quot;very safe&quot; because of many backups and safeguards and praised the formatting features, customization ability, and quality of the (very busy) toll-free help line. The review, however, called MultiMate &quot;the klunkiest package&quot; of five tested word processors because of the overemphasis on safety, criticized the built-in help and slow performance, and reported being unable to use the spell checker because of its poor quality. However, the reviewer mentioned that MultiMate version 3.30 was already shipping when the article went to press.

<text>Mohammad Najibullah Ahmadzai (Pashto/, ; 6 August 1947 – 27 September 1996), commonly known as Dr. Najib, was an Afghan military officer and politician who served as the fifth president of Afghanistan from 1987 until his resignation in April 1992, shortly after the Afghan mujahideen&#x27;s takeover of Kabul. He was also the General Secretary of the People&#x27;s Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) from 1986 to 1992. After a failed attempt to flee to India, Najibullah remained in Kabul, and lived in the United Nations headquarters until his assassination during the Taliban&#x27;s first capture of Kabul in 1996.

A graduate of Kabul University, Najibullah held different careers under the People&#x27;s Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA). Following the Saur Revolution and the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, Najibullah was a low profile bureaucrat. He was sent into exile as Ambassador to Iran during Hafizullah Amin&#x27;s rise to power. He returned to Afghanistan following the Soviet intervention which toppled Amin&#x27;s rule and placed Babrak Karmal as head of the state, the party and the government. During Karmal&#x27;s rule, Najibullah became head of the KHAD, the Afghan equivalent of the Soviet KGB. He was a member of the Parcham faction led by Karmal. During Najibullah&#x27;s tenure as KHAD head, it became one of the most brutally efficient governmental organs. Because of this, he gained the attention of several leading Soviet officials, such as Yuri Andropov, Dmitriy Ustinov and Boris Ponomarev. In 1981, Najibullah was appointed to the PDPA Politburo. In 1985, Najibullah stepped down as the state security minister to focus on PDPA politics; he had been appointed to the PDPA Secretariat. Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev, also the last Soviet leader, was able to get Karmal to step down as PDPA General Secretary in 1986, and replace him with Najibullah. For a number of months, Najibullah was locked in a power struggle against Karmal, who still retained his post of Chairman of the Revolutionary Council. Najibullah accused Karmal of trying to wreck his policy of National Reconciliation, a series of efforts by Najibullah to end the conflict.

During his tenure as leader of Afghanistan, the Soviets began their withdrawal, and from 1989 until 1992, his government tried to solve the ongoing civil war without Soviet troops on the ground. While direct Soviet assistance ended with the withdrawal, the Soviet Union still supported Najibullah with economic and military aid, while Pakistan and the United States continued their support for the mujahideen. Throughout his tenure, he tried to build support for his government via the National Reconciliation reforms by distancing from socialism in favor of Afghan nationalism, abolishing the one-party state and letting non-communists join the government. He remained open to dialogue with the mujahideen and other groups, made Islam an official religion, and invited exiled businessmen back to re-take their properties. In the 1990 constitution, all references to communism were removed and Islam became the state religion. For various reasons, such changes did not win Najibullah any significant support. Following the August Coup in Moscow and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1991, Najibullah was left without foreign aid. This, coupled with the internal collapse of his government (following the defection of general Abdul Rashid Dostum), led to his resignation in April 1992. In 1996, he was tortured and killed by the Taliban.

In 2017, the pro-Najibullah &quot;Watan Party&quot; was created as a continuation of Najibullah&#x27;s party.

==Early life and career==

Najibullah was born on 6 August 1947 in the city of Gardez, Paktia Province, in the Kingdom of Afghanistan. His ancestral village of Najibqilla is located between the towns of Gardez and Said Karam in an area known as Mehlan. He belonged to the Ahmadzai Ghilji tribe of Pashtuns.

Najibullah was educated at Habibia High School in Kabul, at St. Joseph&#x27;s Higher Secondary School in Baramulla, Jammu and Kashmir, India, and at Kabul University where he began studying in 1964 and completed his Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) in 1975; however, he never practiced medicine. 

In 1965, during his study in Kabul, Najibullah joined the Parcham (Banner) faction of the People&#x27;s Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) and was twice imprisoned for political activities. He served as Babrak Karmal&#x27;s close associate and bodyguard during the latter&#x27;s tenure in the lower house of parliament (1965–1973).

In 1977, Najibullah was elected to the Central Committee. On 27 April 1978, the PDPA took power in Afghanistan (Saur Revolution), with Najibullah a member of the ruling Revolutionary Council; however, the Khalq (People&#x27;s) faction of the PDPA gained supremacy over his own Parcham (Banner) faction, and after a brief stint as Ambassador to Iran, he was dismissed from government and went into exile in Europe, until the Soviet Union intervened in 1979 and supported a Parcham-dominated government.

==Under Karmal: 1979–1986==

===Minister of State Security: 1980–1985===
In 1980, Najibullah was appointed the head of KHAD, the Afghan equivalent to the Soviet KGB, and was promoted to the rank of Major General. He was appointed following lobbying from the Soviets, including Yuri Andropov, then KGB Chairman. During his six years as head of KHAD he had two to four deputies under his command, who in turn were responsible for an estimated 12 departments. According to evidence, Najibullah was dependent on his family and his professional network, and more often than not appointed people he knew to top positions within the KHAD. In June 1981, Najibullah, along with Mohammad Aslam Watanjar, a former tank commander and the then Minister of Communications and Major General Mohammad Rafi, the Minister of Defence were appointed to the PDPA Politburo.

Under Najibullah, KHAD&#x27;s personnel increased from 120 to 25,000 to 30,000. KHAD employees were amongst the best-paid government bureaucrats in communist Afghanistan, and because of it, the political indoctrination of KHAD officials was a top priority. During a PDPA conference, Najibullah, talking about the indoctrination programme of KHAD officials, said &quot;a weapon in one hand, a book in the other.&quot; Counter-insurgency activities launched by KHAD reached its peak under Najibullah. He reported directly to the Soviet KGB, and a big part of KHAD&#x27;s budget came from the Soviet Union itself. As the head of KHAD, Najibullah was also involved in the planning of the hijacking of Pakistan International Airlines Flight 326 with Murtaza Bhutto.

As time would show, Najibullah was very efficient, and during his tenure as leader of KHAD, thousands were arrested, tortured, and executed. KHAD targeted anti-communist citizens, political opponents, and educated members of society. It was this efficiency which made him interesting to the Soviets. Because of this, KHAD became known for its ruthlessness. During his ascension to power, several Afghan politicians did not want Najibullah to succeed Babrak Karmal because Najibullah was known for exploiting his powers for his own benefit. Additionally, during his period as KHAD chief, the Pul-i Charki had become the home of several Khalqist politicians. Another problem was that Najibullah allowed graft, theft, bribery and corruption on a scale not seen previously. As would later be proven by the power struggle he had with Karmal after becoming PDPA General Secretary, despite Najibullah heading the KHAD for five years, Karmal still had sizeable support in the parcham faction leading to Najibullah relying more on Khalqists.

===Rise to power: 1985–1986===

He was appointed to the PDPA Secretariat in November 1985. Najibullah&#x27;s ascent to power was proven by turning KHAD from a government organ to a ministry in January 1986. With the situation in Afghanistan deteriorating, and the Soviet leadership looking for ways to withdraw, Mikhail Gorbachev wanted Karmal to resign as PDPA General Secretary. The question of who was to succeed Karmal was hotly debated, but Gorbachev supported Najibullah. Yuri Andropov, Boris Ponomarev and Dmitriy Ustinov all thought highly of Najibullah, and negotiations of who would succeed Karmal might have begun as early as 1983. Despite this, Najibullah was not the only choice the Soviets had. A GRU report argued that he was a Pashtun nationalist, a stance which could decrease the regime&#x27;s popularity even more. The GRU preferred Assadullah Sarwari, earlier head of ASGA, the pre-KHAD secret police, who they believed would be better able to balance between the Pashtuns, Tajiks and Uzbeks. Another viable candidate was Abdul Qadir, who had been a participant in the Saur Revolution. Najibullah succeeded Karmal as PDPA General Secretary on 4 May 1986 at the 18th PDPA meeting, but Karmal still retained his post as Chairman of the Presidium of the Revolutionary Council.

On 15 May, Najibullah announced that a collective leadership had been established, which was led by himself consisted of himself as head of party, Karmal as head of state and Sultan Ali Keshtmand as Chairman of the Council of Ministers. When Najibullah took the office of PDPA General Secretary, Karmal still had enough support in the party to disgrace Najibullah. Karmal went as far as to spread rumours that Najibullah&#x27;s rule was little more than an interregnum, and that he would soon be reappointed to the general secretaryship. As it turned out, Karmal&#x27;s power base during this period was KHAD. The Soviet leadership wanted to ease Karmal out of politics, but when Najibullah began to complain that he was hampering his plans of National Reconciliation, the Soviet Politburo decided to remove Karmal; this motion was supported by Andrei Gromyko, Yuli Vorontsov, Eduard Shevardnadze, Anatoly Dobrynin and Viktor Chebrikov. A meeting in the PDPA in November relieved Karmal of his Revolutionary Council chairmanship, and he was exiled to Moscow where he was given a state-owned apartment and a dacha. In his position as Revolutionary Council chairman Karmal was succeeded by Haji Mohammad Chamkani, who was not a member of the PDPA.

In 1986, there were more than 100,000 political prisoners and there had been more than 16,500 extrajudicial executions. Its main objectives were the opponents of communism and the most educated classes in society.

==Leader: 1986–1992==

===National Reconciliation===
In September 1986, the National Compromise Commission (NCC) was established on the orders of Najibullah. The NCC&#x27;s goal was to contact counter-revolutionaries &quot;in order to complete the Saur Revolution in its new phase.&quot; Allegedly, an estimated 40,000 rebels were contacted by the government. At the end of 1986, Najibullah called for a six-months ceasefire and talks between the various opposition forces, this was part of his policy of National Reconciliation. The discussions, if fruitful, would lead to the establishment of a coalition government and be the end of the PDPA&#x27;s monopoly of power. The programme failed, but the government was able to recruit disillusioned mujahideen fighters as government militias. In many ways, the National Reconciliation led to an increasing number of urban dwellers to support his rule, and the stabilisation of the Afghan defence forces.

In September 1986, a new constitution was written, which was adopted on 29 November 1987. The constitution weakened the powers of the head of state by cancelling his absolute veto. The reason for this move, according to Najibullah, was the need for real-power sharing. On 13 July 1987, the official name of Afghanistan was changed from the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan to Republic of Afghanistan, and in June 1988 the Revolutionary Council, whose members were elected by the party leadership, was replaced by a National Assembly, an organ in which members were to be elected by the people. The PDPA&#x27;s socialist stance was denied even more than previously, in 1989 the Minister of Higher Education began to work on the &quot;de-Sovietisation&quot; of universities, and in 1990 it was even announced by a party member that all PDPA members were Muslims and that the party had abandoned Marxism. Many parts of the Afghan government&#x27;s economic monopoly was also broken, this had more to do with the tight situation than any ideological conviction. Abdul Hakim Misaq, the Mayor of Kabul, even stated that traffickers of stolen goods would not be prosecuted by law as long as their goods were given to the market. Yuli Vorontsov, on Gorbachev&#x27;s orders, was able to get an agreement with the PDPA leadership to offer the posts of Gossoviet chairman (the state planning organ), the Council of Ministers chairmanship (head of government), ministries of defence, state security, communications, finance, presidencies of banks and the Supreme Court. The PDPA still demanded it held on to all deputy ministers, retained its majority in the state bureaucracy and that it retained all its provincial governors. The government was not willing to concede all of these positions, and when the offer was broadcast, the ministries of defence and state security.

====Elections: 1987 and 1988====
Local elections were held in 1987. It began when the government introduced a law permitting the formation of other political parties, announced that it would be prepared to share power with representatives of opposition groups in the event of a coalition government, and issued a new constitution providing for a new bicameral National Assembly (Meli Shura), consisting of a Senate (Sena) and a House of Representatives (Wolesi Jirga), and a president to be indirectly elected to a 7-year term. The new political parties had to oppose colonialism, imperialism, neo-colonialism, Zionism, racial discrimination, apartheid and fascism. Najibullah stated that only the extremist part of the opposition could not join the planned coalition government. No parties had to share the PDPA&#x27;s policy or ideology, but they could not oppose the bond between Afghanistan and the Soviet Union. A parliamentary election was held in 1988. The PDPA won 46 seats in the House of Representatives and controlled the government with support from the National Front, which won 45 seats, and from various newly recognized left-wing parties, which had won a total of 24 seats. Although the election was boycotted by the Mujahideen, the government left 50 of the 234 seats in the House of Representatives, as well as a small number of seats in the Senate, vacant in the hope that the guerrillas would end their armed struggle and participate in the government. The only armed opposition party to make peace with the government was Hizbollah, a small Shi&#x27;a party not to be confused with the bigger party in Iran or the Lebanese organization.

===Emergency===
Several figures of the intelligentsia took Najibullah&#x27;s offer seriously, even if they sympathised or were against the regime. Their hopes were dampened when the Najibullah government introduced the state of emergency on 18 February 1989, four days after the Soviet withdrawal due to a mujahideen offensive starting to take shape in Nangarhar Province, later leading to the Battle of Jalalabad. 1,700 intellectuals were arrested in February alone, and until November 1991 the government still supervised and restricted freedom of speech. Another problem was that party members took his policy seriously too, Najibullah recanted that most party members felt &quot;panic and pessimism&quot;. At the Second Conference of the party, the majority of members, maybe up to 60 percent, were radical socialists. According to Soviet advisors (in 1987), a bitter debate within the party had broken out between those who advocated the Islamisation of the party and those who wanted to defend the gains of the Saur Revolution. Opposition to his policy of National Reconciliation was met party-wide, but especially from Karmalists. Many people did not support the handing out of the already small state resources the Afghan state had at its disposal. On the other side, several members were proclaiming anti-Soviet slogans as they accused the National Reconciliation programme to be supported and developed by the Soviet Union. Najibullah reassured the inter-party opposition that he would not give up the gains of the Saur Revolution, but to the contrary, preserve them, not give up the PDPA&#x27;s monopoly on power, or to collaborate with reactionary Mullahs.

====An Islamic state====
During Babrak Karmal&#x27;s later years, and during Najibullah&#x27;s tenure, the PDPA tried to improve their standing with Muslims by moving, or appearing to move, to the political centre. They wanted to create a new image for the party and state. Communist symbols were either replaced or removed. These measures did not contribute to any notable increase in support for the government, because the mujahideen had a stronger legitimacy to protect Islam than the government; they had rebelled against what they saw as an anti-Islamic government, that government was the PDPA. Islamic principles were embedded in the 1987 constitution, for instance, Article 2 of the constitution stated that Islam was the state religion, and Article 73 stated that the head of state had to be born into a Muslim Afghan family. The 1990 constitution stated that Afghanistan was an Islamic state, and the last references to communism were removed. Article 1 of the 1990 Constitution said that Afghanistan was an &quot;independent, unitary and Islamic state.&quot; However, in 1992, Najibullah appealed to the United States to help Afghanistan become a bulwark against the spread of Islamic fundamentalism. He said: “If fundamentalism comes to Afghanistan, war will continue for many more years. Afghanistan will turn into a centre of world smuggling for narcotic drugs. Afghanistan will be turned into a centre for terrorism”.

===Economic policies===
Najibullah continued Karmal&#x27;s economic policies. The augmenting of links with the Eastern Bloc and the Soviet Union continued, and so did bilateral trade. He encouraged the development of the private sector in industry. The Five-Year Economic and Social Development Plan which was introduced in January 1986 continued until March 1992, one month before the government&#x27;s fall. According to the plan, the economy, which had grown less than 2 percent annually until 1985, would grow 25 percent in the plan. Industry would grow 28 percent, agriculture 14–16 percent, domestic trade by 150 percent and foreign trade with 15 percent. As expected, none of these targets were met, and 2 percent growth annually which had been the norm before the plan continued under Najibullah. The 1990 constitution gave due attention to the private sector. Article 20 was about the establishment of private firms, and Article 25 encouraged foreign investments in the private sector.

===Afghan–Soviet relations===

====Soviet withdrawal====

While he may have been the &quot;de jure&quot; leader of Afghanistan, Soviet advisers still did the majority of work when Najibullah took power. As Gorbachev remarked &quot;We&#x27;re still doing everything ourselves [...]. That&#x27;s all our people know how to do. They&#x27;ve tied Najibullah hand and foot.&quot; Fikryat Tabeev, the Soviet ambassador to Afghanistan, was accused of acting like a governor general by Gorbachev. Tabeev was recalled from Afghanistan in July 1986, but while Gorbachev called for the end of Soviet management of Afghanistan, he could not help but to do some managing himself. At a Soviet Politburo meeting, Gorbachev said &quot;It&#x27;s difficult to build a new building out of old material [...] I hope to God that we haven&#x27;t made a mistake with Najibullah.&quot; As time would prove, the problem was that Najibullah&#x27;s aims were the opposite of the Soviet Union&#x27;s; Najibullah was opposed to a Soviet withdrawal, the Soviet Union wanted a Soviet withdrawal. This was logical, considering the fact that the Afghan military was on the brink of dissolution. The only means of survival seemed to Najibullah was to retain the Soviet presence. In July 1986 six regiments, which consisted up to 15,000 troops, were withdrawn from Afghanistan. The aim of this early withdrawal was, according to Gorbachev, to show the world that the Soviet leadership was serious about leaving Afghanistan. The Soviets told the United States Government that they were planning to withdraw, but the United States Government did not believe them. When Gorbachev met with Ronald Reagan during his visit the United States, Reagan called for the dissolution of the Afghan army.

On 14 April 1988, the Afghan and Pakistani governments signed the Geneva Accords, and the Soviet Union and the United States signed as guarantors; the treaty specifically stated that the Soviet military had to withdraw from Afghanistan by 15 February 1989. Gorbachev later confided to Anatoly Chernyaev, a personal advisor to Gorbachev, that the Soviet withdrawal would be criticised for creating a bloodbath which could have been averted if the Soviets stayed. During a Politburo meeting Eduard Shevardnadze said &quot;We will leave the country in a deplorable situation&quot;, and further talked about the economic collapse, and the need to keep at least 10 to 15,000 troops in Afghanistan. In this Vladimir Kryuchkov, the KGB Chairman, supported him. This stance, if implemented, would be a betrayal of the Geneva Accords just signed. During the second phase of the Soviet withdrawal, in 1989, Najibullah told Valentin Varennikov openly that he would do everything to slow down the Soviet departure. Varennikov in turn replied that such a move would not help, and would only lead to an international outcry against the war. Najibullah would repeat his position later that year, to a group of senior Soviet representatives in Kabul. This time Najibullah stated that Ahmad Shah Massoud was the main problem, and that he needed to be killed. In this, the Soviets agreed, but repeated that such a move would be a breach of the Geneva Accords; to hunt for Ahmad Shah Massoud so early on would disrupt the withdrawal, and would mean that the Soviet Union would fail to meet its deadline for withdrawal.

During his January 1989 visit to Shevardnadze, Najibullah wanted to retain a small presence of Soviet troops in Afghanistan, and called for moving Soviet bombers to military bases close to the Afghan–Soviet border and place them on permanent alert. Najibullah also repeated his claims that his government could not survive if Ahmad Shah Massoud remained alive. Shevardnadze again repeated that troops could not stay, since it would lead to international outcry, but said he would look into the matter. Shevardnadze demanded that the Soviet embassy created a plan in which at least 12,000 Soviet troops would remain in Afghanistan either under direct control of the United Nations or remain as &quot;volunteers&quot;. The Soviet military leadership, when hearing of Shevardnadze&#x27;s plan, became furious. But they followed orders, and named the operation &quot;Typhoon&quot;, maybe ironic considering that Operation Typhoon was the German military operation against the city of Moscow during World War II. Shevardnadze contacted the Soviet leadership about moving a unit to break the siege of Kandahar, and to protect convoys from and to the city. The Soviet leadership were against Shevardnadze&#x27;s plan, and Chernyaev even believed it was part of Najibullah&#x27;s plan to keep Soviet troops in the country. To which Shevardnadze replied angrily &quot;You&#x27;ve not been there, [...] You&#x27;ve no idea all the things we have done there in the past ten years.&quot; At a Politburo meeting on 24 January, Shevardnadze argued that the Soviet leadership could not be indifferent to Najibullah and his government; again, Shevardnadze received support from Kryuchkov. In the end Shevardnadze lost the debate, and the Politburo reaffirmed their commitment to withdraw from Afghanistan. There was still a small presence of Soviet troops after the Soviet withdrawal; for instance, parachutists who protected the Soviet embassy staff, military advisors and special forces and reconnaissance troops still operated in the &quot;outlying provinces&quot;, especially along the Afghan–Soviet border.

====Aid====
Soviet military aid continued after their withdrawal, and massive quantities of food, fuel, ammunition and military equipment was given to the government. Varennikov visited Afghanistan in May 1989 to discuss ways and means to deliver the aid to the government. In 1990, Soviet aid amounted to an estimated 3 billion United States dollars. As it turned out, the Afghan military was entirely dependent on Soviet aid to function. When the Soviet Union was dissolved on 26 December 1991, Najibullah turned to former Soviet Central Asia for aid. These newly independent states had no wish to see Afghanistan being taken over by religious fundamentalists, and supplied Afghanistan with 6 million barrels of oil and 500,000 tons of wheat to survive the winter.

===After the Soviets===

With the Soviets&#x27; withdrawal in 1989, the Afghan army was left on its own to battle the insurgents. The most effective, and largest, assaults on the mujahideen were undertaken during the 1985–86 period. These offensives had forced the mujahideen on the defensive near Herat and Kandahar. The Soviets ensued a bomb and negotiate during 1986, and a major offensive that year included 10,000 Soviet troops and 8,000 Afghan troops.

The Pakistani people and establishment continued to support the Afghan mujahideen even if it was in contravention of the Geneva Accords. At the beginning, most observers expected the Najibullah government to collapse immediately, and to be replaced with an Islamic fundamentalist government. The Central Intelligence Agency stated in a report that the new government would be ambivalent, or even hostile towards the United States. Almost immediately after the Soviet withdrawal, the Battle of Jalalabad broke out between Afghan government forces and the mujahideen, in cooperation with Pakistan&#x27;s Inter-Service Intelligence (ISI). The offensive against the city began when the mujahideen bribed several government military officers, from there, they tried to take the airport, but were repulsed with heavy casualties. The willingness of the common Afghan government soldier to fight increased when the mujahideen began to execute people during the battle. Hamid Gul, leader of the ISI, hoped that the battle would topple Najibullah&#x27;s government and create a mujahideen government seated in Jalalabad. During the battle, Najibullah called for Soviet assistance. Gorbachev called an emergency session of the Politburo to discuss his proposal, but Najibullah&#x27;s request was rejected. Other attacks against the city failed, and by April the government forces were on the offensive. During the battle over four hundred Scud missiles were shot, which were fired by a Soviet crew which had stayed behind. When the battle ended in July, the mujahideen had lost an estimated 3,000 troops. One mujahideen commander lamented &quot;the battle of Jalalabad lost us credit won in ten years of fighting.&quot; After the mujahideen&#x27;s defeat in Jalalabad, Gul blamed the administration of Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto for the defeat. Bhutto eventually sacked Gul.

Hardline Khalqist Shahnawaz Tanai attempted to overthrow Najibullah in a failed coup attempt in March 1990, the coup was stopped however by the Khalqist General Aslam Watanjar. Although Tanai and his forces failed and fled to Pakistan, the coup attempt still managed to show weaknesses in Najibullah&#x27;s government.

From 1989 to 1990, the Najibullah government was partially successful in building up the Afghan defence forces. The Ministry of State Security had established a local militia force which stood at an estimated 100,000 men. The 17th Division in Herat, which had begun the 1979 Herat uprising against PDPA-rule, stood at 3,400 regular troops and 14,000 tribal men. In 1988, the total number of security forces available to the government stood at 300,000. This trend did not continue, and by the summer of 1990, the Afghan government forces were on the defensive again. By the beginning of 1991, the government controlled only 10 percent of Afghanistan, the eleven-year Siege of Khost had ended in a mujahideen victory and the morale of the Afghan military finally collapsed. In the Soviet Union, Kryuchkov and Shevardnadze had both supported continuing aid to the Najibullah government, but Kryuchkov had been arrested following the failed 1991 Soviet coup d&#x27;état attempt and Shevardnadze had resigned from his posts in the Soviet government in December 1990 – there were no longer any pro-Najibullah people in the Soviet leadership and the Soviet Union was in the middle of an economic and political crisis, which would lead directly to the dissolution of the Soviet Union on 26 December 1991. At the same time, Boris Yeltsin became Russia&#x27;s new leader, and he had no wish to continue to aid Najibullah&#x27;s government, which he considered a relic of the past. In the autumn of 1991, Najibullah wrote to Shevardnadze &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to be president, you talked me into it, insisted on it, and promised support. Now you are throwing me and the Republic of Afghanistan to its fate.&quot;

====Fall from power====
By January 1992, Najibullah had become internationally isolated, with the loss of his biggest supporter he decided to consolidate his power over the non Pashtuns who were considered less loyal to the regime. This came after complaints from his fellow Pashtun Kochis of harassment from an ethnic Tajik general, Abdul Momin. Momin had developed secret ties with the Tajik warlord Ahmad Shah Massoud and was passing on secret information to Massoud which led to Najibullah ordering the sacking of Momin which was carried out by Juma Achak, an Achakzai Pashtun who served as Commander of the Northern Zone and was known to hold Pashtun chauvinist views. 

General Momin was replaced with General Rasul, an ethnic Pashtun Khalqist known for his brutal reputation of commander of Pul-e Charkhi Prison. This move offended many of the non Pashtun militias in the North and led to the defection of most Uzbek, Tajiks, Turkmen, Hazara and Ismaili Shias militias including ethnic Uzbek, General Abdul Rashid Dostum and his 40,000 Uzbek soldiers. The defectors would form an anti-Pashtun coalition known as the Movement of the North (Harakat-e Shamal) and ally with the Tajik Jamiat-e Islami and Hazara Hezbe Wahdat in taking on the mostly Pashtun, Afghan Military. 

Many Tajik Parchamites loyal to Babrak Karmal would defect en masse during the capture of Mazar-i-Sharif including General Mohammad Nabi Azimi with the Pashtun Khalqist and Pro-Najibullah army and paramilitaries defending the city. On March 18, 1992 Najibullah offered to resign, leading to many Pashtun Khalqist and Najibullah loyalists to ally with Gulbuddin Hekmatyar&#x27;s Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin in order to prevent non Pashtuns from seizing Kabul. The Peshawar Accord would be signed on 26 April 1992 between various Mujahadeen factions, leading to the creation of the new Islamic State of Afghanistan. However, Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin and the Khalq would continue to fight this new government in the Third Afghan Civil War.

===Role of Ismailis in the overthrow of Dr. Najibullah===
During the tumultuous period leading to the fall of Dr. Najibullah&#x27;s government in Afghanistan, the Ismaili community, under the leadership of Sayed Mansur Naderi and his son Sayed Jafar Naderi, played a significant role in orchestrating the political and military maneuvers that culminated in Najibullah&#x27;s ousting. The strategic mutiny led by these Ismaili leaders, in collaboration with other non-Pashtun factions, effectively disrupted Najibullah&#x27;s main supply route from the former Soviet Union, directly contributing to the collapse of his regime. This pivotal action not only marked a turning point in Afghanistan&#x27;s history but also highlighted the critical influence of the Ismaili community in shaping the nation&#x27;s political landscape during a period of profound change and instability.

==Final years and death==
Not long before Kabul&#x27;s fall, Najibullah appealed to the UN for protection after his guards fled, which was rejected. His attempt to flee to the airport was thwarted by troops of Abdul Rashid Dostum – once loyal to him, but now allied with Ahmad Shah Massoud – who controlled the airport. At the UN compound in Kabul, while waiting for the UN to negotiate his safe passage to India, he occupied himself by translating Peter Hopkirk&#x27;s book &quot;The Great Game&quot; into his mother tongue Pashto. India was placed in a difficult position by deciding to allow Najibullah political asylum and safely escorting him out of the country. Supporters claimed he had always been close to India and should not be denied asylum, but others said doing so would risk antagonizing India&#x27;s relationship with the new mujahideen government formed under the Peshawar Accord.

India also refused to let him take refuge at the Indian embassy in Afghanistan as it risked creating &quot;subcontinental rivalries&quot; and reprisals against Kabul&#x27;s Indian community, arguing that Najibullah would be far safer at the UN compound. All attempts failed and he eventually sought refuge in the local UN headquarters, where he would stay until 1996. In 1994, India sent senior diplomat M. K. Bhadrakumar to Kabul to hold talks with Ahmad Shah Massoud, the defence minister, to consolidate relations with the Afghan authorities, reopen the embassy, and allow Najibullah to fly to India, but Massoud refused. Bhadrakumar wrote in 2016 that he believed Massoud did not want Najibullah to leave as Massoud could strategically make use of him, and that Massoud &quot;probably harboured hopes of a co-habitation with Najib somewhere in the womb of time because that extraordinary Afghan politician was a strategic asset to have by his side&quot;. At the time, Massoud was commanding the government&#x27;s forces fighting the militias of Dostum and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar during the Battle of Kabul. A few months before his death, he quoted, &quot;Afghans keep making the same mistake,&quot; reflecting upon his translation to a visitor.

In September 1996, when the Taliban were about to enter Kabul, Massoud claimed to have offered Najibullah an opportunity to flee the capital. Najibullah refused. The reasons for his refusal might have been that unlike other members of the former regime, Najibullah had not been granted amnesty by the Islamic State of Afghanistan. The UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali had pleaded with the government of Burhanuddin Rabbani to allow Najibullah to leave the country as he felt that Najibullah was not safe as his presence was well known, Rabbani however refused to grant Najibullah amnesty. Massoud (a member of Rabbani&#x27;s Jamiat-e Islami Party) himself claimed that Najibullah feared that &quot;if he fled with the Tajiks, he would be for ever damned in the eyes of his fellow Pashtuns.&quot; Others, like General Tokhi, who was with Najibullah until the day before his torture and murder, stated that Najibullah mistrusted Massoud after his militia had repeatedly fired rockets at the UN compound and had effectively barred Najibullah from leaving Kabul. &quot;If they wanted Najibullah to flee Kabul in safety,&quot; Tokhi said, &quot;they could have provided him the opportunity as they did with other high-ranking officials from the communist party from 1992 to 1996.&quot; Dr Najibullah was the only member of the old regime (besides Assadullah Sawari) to not be granted amnesty by the Islamic State of Afghanistan. Whatever his true motivations were, when Massoud&#x27;s militia went to both Najibullah and General Tokhi and asked them to flee Kabul, they rejected the offer.

Najibullah was at the UN compound when unknown soldiers came for him on the evening of 26 September 1996. He was abducted from UN custody, and shot in the head. It is alleged that members of the Taliban after finding his corpse dragged his corpse behind a truck through the streets of Kabul. His brother, General Shahpur Ahmadzai, was given the same treatment. Najibullah and Shahpur&#x27;s bodies were hanged from a traffic light pole outside the Arg presidential palace the next day in order to show the public that a new era had begun. The Taliban prevented Islamic funeral prayers for Najibullah and Shahpur in Kabul, but the bodies were later handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross who in turn sent their bodies to Gardez in Paktia Province, where both of them were buried after the Islamic funeral prayers for them by their fellow Ahmadzai tribesmen. The perpetrators of the murder have been debated, some including Soviet journalists Plastun and Andrianov who knew Najibullah personally, US Special Envoy to Afghanistan Peter Tomsen, the former National Directorate of Security, Afghanistan&#x27;s Strategic and Scientific Research Center, and many Pashtun Nationalist including a former senator in Pakistan, Afrasiab Khattak have claimed that Najibullah was assassinated by the ISI (alongside members of the Taliban working for them) allegedly over his Pashtun nationalist stance Durand Line as well as revenge for the botched Battle of Jalalabad in 1989. In his book &quot;The Wars of Afghanistan&quot;, Tomsen wrote, “Najib&#x27;s entrapment and execution carried the hallmarks of a classic intelligence operation. The Taliban, on their own, would not have taken such elaborate precautions to avoid violating the UN&#x27;s diplomatic premises (where Dr Najibullah had taken sanctuary since stepping down in 1992).” In 1996, Mullah Borjan, who was the commander-in-chief of the Taliban siege force on the southeast side of Kabul, claimed to have been approached by the ISI and asked to kill Najibullah. He made it clear that he would never allow Taliban forces to kill former President Najibullah. On 20 September, Mullah Borjan was shot and killed by his bodyguards for unknown reasons. A week later, Najibullah was killed.

===Reactions===
News of Najibullah&#x27;s murder was greeted with widespread international condemnation,&lt;ref name=&quot;un-51/108&quot;&gt;&quot;Situation of human rights in Afghanistan&quot; United Nations Resolution 51/108, Article 10. 12 December 1996. Retrieved 15 June 2015 &quot;Endorses the Special Rapporteur&#x27;s condemnation of the abduction from United Nations premises of the former President of Afghanistan, Mr. Najibullah, and of his brother, and of their subsequent summary execution;&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; particularly from the Muslim world. The United Nations issued a statement which condemned the killing of Najibullah, and claimed that it would further destabilise Afghanistan. The Taliban responded by issuing death sentences on Dostum, Massoud and Burhanuddin Rabbani. India, which had been supporting Najibullah, strongly condemned his killing and began to support Massoud&#x27;s United Front/Northern Alliance in an attempt to contain the rise of the Taliban.

On the 20th anniversary of his death, in 2016, Afghanistan&#x27;s Research Center blamed the ISI for his death, claiming that the plan to kill Najibullah was implemented by Pakistan.

On 1 June 2020, following a visit to his grave in Gardez by the Afghan National Security Advisor Hamdullah Mohib, Najibullah&#x27;s widow Fatana Najib said that before constructing a mausoleum for him, the government should first investigate his assassination. In 2021, during an interview with a Taliban commander on Afghan television, he denied that the Taliban were involved and blamed Najibullah’s assassination on the ISI.

==Legacy==
After Najibullah&#x27;s death, the brutal civil war between mujahideen factions, the Taliban regime, continued fighting, and enduring problems with corruption and poverty, his image among the Afghan people dramatically improved, and Najibullah came to be seen as a strong and patriotic leader. Since the 2010s, posters and pictures of him have become a common sight in many Afghan cities. Najibullah is a very popular figure amongst Pashtun Nationalists many of whom view his fall as the biggest blow to the Pashtun Nationalist Movement. Ever since the creation of Pakistan the various governments of Afghanistan whatever Monarchy, Republican or Communist had all backed Pashtun Nationalist parties such as ANP. The fall of Najibullah was considered by Afghan Mellat Wakman faction leader Anwar ul-Haq Ahady as &quot;the end of Pashtun dominance in Afghan politics&quot;. Many Pashtuns remember under Najibullah, Pashto became the 4th language spoken in space when Abdul Ahad Momand called Najibullah in 1988 from space as well as the fact Najibullah chose to speak Pashto at the UN General assembly rather than Dari.

In 1997, the Watan Party of Afghanistan was formed and in 2003, the National United Party of Afghanistan was registered – who seek to unite former PDPA members formerly led by Mohammad Najibullah.

== Views ==
Najibullah is often referred to as a communist by some; however, his rule from 1987 to 1992 was marked with a shift away from communism towards Islamic socialism and a mixed economy. In terms of policy, Najibullah can be best compared to Daoud Khan, who ruled the Republic of Afghanistan before the PDPA took power in 1978. Najibullah&#x27;s government also featured many former ministers of the Daoud Khan government. 

Najibullah was in support of restoration of the monarchy to some capacity, he restored Zahir Shah&#x27;s citizenship and actively encouraged Zahir Shah to take part in negotiations, Najibullah&#x27;s wife Fatana Najib is also related to former Afghan King Amanaullah. Najibullah was a Pashtun Nationalist being hailed as the first Afghan leader to speak Pashto at the UN General Assembly and having Afghan Cosmonaut Abdul Ahad Momand (also an Ethnic Pashtun) making Pashto the 4th language spoken in space under his leadership. He often questioning the legitimacy of Pakistan&#x27;s existence claiming it was &quot;born out of British colonialism&quot;. Najibullah whose father was also a Pashtun Nationalist, had strong ties to the Pashtun Nationalist community in the Pashtun majority North West Frontier province. Najibullah was present during the funeral for Pashtun Nationalist leader Abdul Ghaffar who was granted military honors. 

Najibullah also attempted to hand over the control of non Pashtun ethnic militias to Pashtun leaders as he had grown to distrust many northern militias such as Abdul Rashid Dostum&#x27;s Uzbek militia which had committed atrocities and started to open channels with Ahmad Shah Massoud. A Soviet GRU dossier on Najibullah described him as &quot;A Pushtun nationalist, he is one of the motivating spirits of the policy of “Pushtunization” of Afghan society. Within his closest circle he speaks only in Pashto. He is inclined to select colleagues not for their professional qualities but for their personal devotion to him, predominantly relatives and fellow-villagers&quot;. Under Najibullah over 50% of Afghan media was in the Pashto language.

==Family==
Najibullah was married on 1 September 1974 to Fatana Najib, principal of the Peace School whom he met when she was an eighth-grade student and he was her science tutor. The couple had three daughters, who were forced to leave Afghanistan after the Taliban seizure and the start of the civil war. The daughters grew up with their mother in New Delhi, India, after moving there in 1992.

Najibullah had at least three brothers: General Shahpur Ahmadzai who was murdered along with Najibullah in 1996, Sediqullah Rahi, a onetime Afghan National Bank employee who had also lived in Hamburg (then West Germany) and in 1988 defected to the Taliban and fled to Pakistan aged 37 (born 1950 or 1951), and another, unnamed brother mentioned by Rahi as &quot;working for the KGB&quot; in 1988. This possibly refers to Roshan Ahmadzai, the third brother of Najibullah, who was a junior official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Rahi later moved to the United States and denounced the Taliban as a &quot;religious fanatic group&quot; not wanted by the people of Afghanistan and stated that they &quot;represent the interests of Pakistan&quot;. Their father died at a hospital in Kabul in 1983.

<text>Multiplan is a spreadsheet program developed by Microsoft and introduced in 1982 as a competitor to VisiCalc.

Multiplan was released first for computers running CP/M; it was developed using a Microsoft proprietary p-code C compiler as part of a portability strategy that facilitated ports to systems such as MS-DOS, Xenix, Commodore 64 and 128, TI-99/4A (on four 6K GROMs and a single 8K ROM), Radio Shack TRS-80 Model II, TRS-80 Model 4, TRS-80 Model 100 (on ROM), Apple II, AT&amp;T UNIX PC, and Burroughs B20 series. The CP/M version also ran on the TRS-80 Model II and 4, Commodore 128, and Apple II with a CP/M card. In France, Multiplan was also released for the Thomson computers in 1986 and same year on Japan for MSX compatible computers with name MSX-Plan.

Despite the release of Microsoft Chart, a graphics companion program, Multiplan continued to be outsold by Lotus 1-2-3. Multiplan was replaced by Microsoft Excel, which followed some years later on both the Apple Macintosh (1985) and Microsoft Windows (1987).

Although over a million copies were sold, Multiplan was not able to mount an effective challenge to Lotus 1-2-3. According to Bill Gates, this was due to the excessive number of ports (there were approximately 100 different versions of Multiplan). He also believed that it was a mistake to release 8-bit versions instead of focusing on the newer 16-bit machines and as a result, &quot;We decided to let [Lotus] have the character-based DOS market while we would instead focus on the next generation–graphical software on the Macintosh and Windows.&quot; 
Around 1983, during the development of the first release of Windows, Microsoft had plans to make a Windows version. However the plans changed a year later.

A version was available for the Apple Lisa 2 running Microsoft/SCO Xenix 3. It fit on one 400K microfloppy diskette.

==Cell addressing differences==
A fundamental difference between Multiplan and its competitors was Microsoft&#x27;s decision to use R1C1 addressing instead of the A1 addressing introduced by VisiCalc. Although R1C1-style formulae are more straightforward than A1-style formulae for instance, &quot;RC[-1]&quot; (meaning &quot;current row, previous column&quot;) is expressed as &quot;A1&quot; in cell B1, then &quot;A2&quot; in cell B2, etc. most spreadsheet users prefer the A1 addressing style introduced by VisiCalc.

Microsoft carried Multiplan&#x27;s R1C1 legacy forward into Microsoft Excel, which offers both addressing modes, although A1 is Excel&#x27;s default addressing mode.

==Reception==
&quot;Ahoy!&quot; called the Commodore 64 version of Multiplan, distributed by Human Engineered Software, a &quot;professional quality spreadsheet ... There is not enough room in this article to mention all the mathematical operations performed ... Documentation is lengthy but well written&quot;. A second review in the magazine noted the limitation of the computer&#x27;s 40-column screen, but praised the ability to stop any ongoing action. It also praised the documentation, and concluded that &quot;its ease of use and foolproof design make &quot;Multiplan&quot; an outstanding value&quot;. &quot;BYTE&quot; said that &quot;Multiplan for the Macintosh is a winner&quot;, stating that combining other versions&#x27; power and features with the Macintosh&#x27;s graphics and user interface &quot;rivals, and in many ways exceeds, anything else available in the spreadsheet genre&quot;.

<doc id="20297" wikidata="Q255528" url="?curid=20297" title="MOS Technology 6502">
<text>The MOS Technology 6502 (typically pronounced &quot;sixty-five-oh-two&quot; or &quot;six-five-oh-two&quot;) is an 8-bit microprocessor that was designed by a small team led by Chuck Peddle for MOS Technology. The design team had formerly worked at Motorola on the Motorola 6800 project; the 6502 is essentially a simplified, less expensive and faster version of that design.

When it was introduced in 1975, the 6502 was the least expensive microprocessor on the market by a considerable margin. It initially sold for less than one-sixth the cost of competing designs from larger companies, such as the 6800 or Intel 8080. Its introduction caused rapid decreases in pricing across the entire processor market. Along with the Zilog Z80, it sparked a series of projects that resulted in the home computer revolution of the early 1980s.

Home video game consoles and home computers of the 1970s through the early 1990s, such as the Atari 2600, Atari 8-bit computers, Apple II, Nintendo Entertainment System, Commodore 64, Atari Lynx, BBC Micro and others, use the 6502 or variations of the basic design. Soon after the 6502&#x27;s introduction, MOS Technology was purchased outright by Commodore International, who continued to sell the microprocessor and licenses to other manufacturers. In the early days of the 6502, it was second-sourced by Rockwell and Synertek, and later licensed to other companies.

In 1981, the Western Design Center started development of a CMOS version, the 65C02. This continues to be widely used in embedded systems, with estimated production volumes in the hundreds of millions.

==History and use==

===Origins at Motorola===
The 6502 was designed by many of the same engineers that had designed the Motorola 6800 microprocessor family. Motorola started the 6800 microprocessor project in 1971 with Tom Bennett as the main architect. Motorola&#x27;s engineers could run analog and digital simulations on an IBM 370-165 mainframe computer. The chip layout began in late 1972, the first 6800 chips were fabricated in February 1974 and the full family was officially released in November 1974. 

John Buchanan was the designer of the 6800 chip and Rod Orgill, who later did the 6501, assisted Buchanan with circuit analyses and chip layout. Bill Mensch joined Motorola in June 1971 after graduating from the University of Arizona (at age 26). His first assignment was helping define the peripheral ICs for the 6800 family and later he was the principal designer of the 6820 Peripheral Interface Adapter (PIA). Bennett hired Chuck Peddle in 1973 to do architectural support work on the 6800 family products already in progress. He contributed in many areas, including the design of the 6850 ACIA (serial interface).

Motorola&#x27;s target customers were established electronics companies such as Hewlett-Packard, Tektronix, TRW, and Chrysler. In May 1972, Motorola&#x27;s engineers began visiting select customers and sharing the details of their proposed 8-bit microprocessor system with ROM, RAM, parallel and serial interfaces. In early 1974, they provided engineering samples of the chips so that customers could prototype their designs. Motorola&#x27;s &quot;total product family&quot; strategy did not focus on the price of the microprocessor, but on reducing the customer&#x27;s total design cost. They offered development software on a timeshare computer, the &quot;EXORciser&quot; debugging system, onsite training and field application engineer support. Both Intel and Motorola had initially announced a price for a single microprocessor. The actual price for production quantities was much less. Motorola offered a design kit containing the 6800 with six support chips for .

Peddle, who would accompany the salespeople on customer visits, found that customers were put off by the high cost of the microprocessor chips. At the same time, these visits invariably resulted in the engineers he presented to producing lists of required instructions that were much smaller than &quot;all these fancy instructions&quot; that had been included in the 6800. Peddle and other team members started outlining the design of an improved feature, reduced-size microprocessor. At that time, Motorola&#x27;s new semiconductor fabrication facility in Austin, Texas, was having difficulty producing MOS chips, and mid-1974 was the beginning of a year-long recession in the semiconductor industry. Also, many of the Mesa, Arizona employees were displeased with the upcoming relocation to Austin.

Motorola&#x27;s Semiconductor Products Division management showed no interest in Peddle&#x27;s low-cost microprocessor proposal. Eventually, Peddle was given an official letter telling him to stop working on the system. Peddle responded to the order by informing Motorola that the letter represented an official declaration of &quot;project abandonment&quot;, and as such, the intellectual property he had developed to that point was now his. In a November 1975 interview, Motorola&#x27;s Chairman, Robert Galvin, ultimately agreed that Peddle&#x27;s concept was a good one and that the division missed an opportunity, &quot;We did not choose the right leaders in the Semiconductor Products division.&quot; The division was reorganized and the management replaced. The new group vice president John Welty said, &quot;The semiconductor sales organization lost its sensitivity to customer needs and couldn&#x27;t make speedy decisions.&quot;

===MOS Technology===
Peddle began looking outside Motorola for a source of funding for this new project. He initially approached Mostek CEO L. J. Sevin, but was declined. Sevin later admitted this was because he was afraid Motorola would sue them.

While Peddle was visiting Ford Motor Company on one of his sales trips, Bob Johnson, later head of Ford&#x27;s engine automation division, mentioned that their former colleague John Paivinen had moved to General Instrument and taught himself semiconductor design. Paivinen then formed MOS Technology in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania in 1969 with two other executives from General Instrument, Mort Jaffe and Don McLaughlin. Allen-Bradley, a supplier of electronic components and industrial controls, acquired a majority interest in 1970. The company designed and fabricated custom ICs for customers and had developed a line of calculator chips.

After the Mostek efforts fell through, Peddle approached Paivinen, who &quot;immediately got it&quot;. On 19 August 1974, Chuck Peddle, Bill Mensch, Rod Orgill, Harry Bawcom, Ray Hirt, Terry Holdt, and Wil Mathys left Motorola to join MOS. Mike Janes joined later. Of the seventeen chip designers and layout people on the 6800 team, eight left. The goal of the team was to design and produce a low-cost microprocessor for embedded applications and to target as wide as possible a customer base. This would be possible only if the microprocessor was low cost, and the team set the price goal for volume purchases at . Mensch later stated the goal was not the processor price itself, but to create a set of chips that could sell at to compete with the recently introduced Intel 4040 that sold for in a similar complete chipset.

Chips are produced by printing multiple copies of the chip design on the surface of a wafer, a thin disk of highly pure silicon. Smaller chips can be printed in greater numbers on the same wafer, decreasing their relative price. Additionally, wafers always include some number of tiny physical defects that are scattered across the surface. Any chip printed in that location will fail and has to be discarded. Smaller chips mean any single copy is less likely to be printed on a defect. For both of these reasons, the cost of the final product is strongly dependent on the size of the chip design.

The original 6800 chips were intended to be , but layout was completed at , or an area of . For the new design, the cost goal demanded a size goal of , or an area of . Several new techniques would be needed to hit this goal.

===Moving to NMOS===
Two significant advances arrived in the market just as the 6502 was being designed that provided significant cost reductions. The first was the move to depletion-load NMOS. The 6800 used an early NMOS process, enhancement mode, that required three supply voltages. One of the 6800&#x27;s headlining features was an onboard voltage doubler that allowed a single +5 V supply be used for +5, −5 and +12 V internally, as opposed to other chips of the era like the Intel 8080 that required three separate supply pins. While this feature reduced the complexity of the power supply and pin layout, it still required separate power line to the various gates on the chip, driving up complexity and size. By moving to the new depletion-load design, a single +5 V supply was all that was needed, eliminating all of this complexity.

A further advantage was that depletion-load designs used less power while switching, thus running cooler and allowing higher operating speeds. Another practical offshoot is that the clock signal for earlier CPUs had to be strong enough to survive all the dissipation as it traveled through the circuits, which almost always required a separate external chip that could supply a powerful signal. With the reduced power requirements of depletion-load design, the clock could be moved onto the chip, simplifying the overall computer design. These changes greatly reduced complexity and the cost of implementing a complete system.

A wider change taking place in the industry was the introduction of projection masking. Previously, chips were patterned onto the surface of the wafer by placing a mask on the surface of the wafer and then shining a bright light on it. The masks often picked up tiny bits of dirt or photoresist as they were lifted off the chip, causing flaws in those locations on any subsequent masking. With complex designs like CPUs, 5 or 6 such masking steps would be used, and the chance that at least one of these steps would introduce a flaw was very high. In most cases, 90% of such designs were flawed, resulting in a 10% yield. The price of the working examples had to cover the production cost of the 90% that were thrown away.

In 1973, Perkin-Elmer introduced the Micralign system, which projected an image of the mask on the wafer instead of requiring direct contact. Masks no longer picked up dirt from the wafers and lasted on the order of 100,000 uses rather than 10. This eliminated step-to-step failures and the high flaw rates formerly seen on complex designs. Yields on CPUs immediately jumped from 10% to 60 or 70%. This meant the price of the CPU declined roughly the same amount and the microprocessor suddenly became a commodity device.

MOS Technology&#x27;s existing fabrication lines were based on the older PMOS technology, they had not yet begun to work with NMOS when the team arrived. Paivinen promised to have an NMOS line up and running in time to begin the production of the new CPU. He delivered on the promise, the new line was ready by June 1975.

===Design notes===
Chuck Peddle, Rod Orgill, and Wil Mathys designed the initial architecture of the new processors. A September 1975 article in &quot;EDN&quot; magazine gives this summary of the design:

The MOS Technology 650X family represents a conscious attempt of eight former Motorola employees who worked on the development of the 6800 system to put out a part that would replace and outperform the 6800, yet undersell it. With the benefit of hindsight gained on the 6800 project, the MOS Technology team headed by Chuck Peddle, made the following architectural changes in the Motorola CPU…
The main change in terms of chip size was the elimination of the tri-state drivers from the address bus outputs. A three-state bus has states for &quot;1&quot;, &quot;0&quot; and &quot;high impedance&quot;. The last state is used to allow other devices to access the bus, and is typically used for multiprocessing, or more commonly in these roles, for direct memory access (DMA). While useful, this feature is expensive in terms of on-chip circuitry. The 6502 simply removed this feature, in keeping with its design as an inexpensive controller being used for specific tasks and communicating with simple devices. Peddle suggested that anyone who required this style of access could implement it with a 74158.

The next major difference was to simplify the registers. To start with, one of the two accumulators was removed. General-purpose registers like accumulators have to be accessed by many parts of the instruction decoder, and thus require significant amounts of wiring to move data to and from their storage. Two accumulators makes many coding tasks easier but costs the chip design itself significant complexity. Further savings were made by reducing the stack register from 16 to 8 bits, meaning that the stack could only be 256 bytes long, which was enough for its intended role as a microcontroller.

The 16-bit IX index register was split in two, becoming X and Y. More importantly, the style of access changed. In the 6800, IX held a 16-bit address which was offset by an 8-bit number stored with the instruction and added to the address. In the 6502 (and most other contemporary designs), the 16-bit base address was stored in the instruction, and the 8-bit X or Y was added to it.

Finally, the instruction set was simplified, simplifying the decoder and control logic. Of the original 72 instructions in the 6800, 56 were implemented. Among those removed were instructions that operated between the 6800&#x27;s two accumulators, and several branch instructions inspired by the PDP-11.

The chip&#x27;s high-level design had to be turned into drawings of transistors and interconnects. At MOS Technology, the layout was a very manual process done with colored pencils and vellum paper. The layout consisted of thousands of polygon shapes on six different drawings; one for each layer of the fabrication process. Given the size limits, the entire chip design had to be constantly considered. Mensch and Paivinen worked on the instruction decoder while Mensch, Peddle and Orgill worked on the ALU and registers. A further advance, developed at a party, was a way to share some of the internal wiring to allow the ALU to be reduced in size.

Despite their best efforts, the final design ended up being larger than the original target. The first 6502 chips were , for an area of . The original version of the processor had no rotate right (ROR) capability, so the instruction was omitted from the original documentation. The next iteration of the design shrank the chip and added the rotate right capability, and ROR was included in revised documentation.

===Introducing the 6501 and 6502===
MOS would introduce two microprocessors based on the same underlying design: the 6501 would plug into the same socket as the Motorola 6800, while the 6502 re-arranged the pinout to support an on-chip clock oscillator. Both would work with other support chips designed for the 6800. They would not run 6800 software because they had a different instruction set, different registers, and mostly different addressing modes. Rod Orgill was responsible for the 6501 design; he had assisted John Buchanan at Motorola on the 6800. Bill Mensch did the 6502; he was the designer of the 6820 PIA at Motorola. Harry Bawcom, Mike Janes and Sydney-Anne Holt helped with the layout.

MOS Technology&#x27;s microprocessor introduction was different from the traditional months-long product launch. The first run of a new integrated circuit is normally used for internal testing and shared with select customers as &quot;engineering samples&quot;. These chips often have a minor design defect or two that will be corrected before production begins. Chuck Peddle&#x27;s goal was to sell the first run 6501 and 6502 chips to the attendees at the WESCON trade show in San Francisco beginning on September 16, 1975. Peddle was a very effective spokesman and the MOS Technology microprocessors were extensively covered in the trade press. One of the earliest was a full-page story on the MCS6501 and MCS6502 microprocessors in the July 24, 1975 issue of &quot;Electronics&quot; magazine. Stories also ran in &quot;EE Times&quot; (August 24, 1975), &quot;EDN&quot; (September 20, 1975), &quot;Electronic News&quot; (November 3, 1975), &quot;Byte&quot; (November 1975) and &quot;Microcomputer Digest&quot; (November 1975). Advertisements for the 6501 appeared in several publications the first week of August 1975. The 6501 would be for sale at Wescon for each. In September 1975, the advertisements included both the 6501 and the 6502 microprocessors. The 6502 would cost only ().

When MOS Technology arrived at Wescon, they found that exhibitors were not permitted to sell anything on the show floor. They rented the MacArthur Suite at the St. Francis Hotel and directed customers there to purchase the processors. At the suite, the processors were stored in large jars to imply that the chips were in production and readily available. The customers did not know the bottom half of each jar contained non-functional chips. The chips were and while the documentation package was an additional . Users were encouraged to make photocopies of the documents, an inexpensive way for MOS Technology to distribute product information. The preliminary data sheets listed just 55 instructions excluding the Rotate Right (ROR) instruction which was not supported on these early chips. The reviews in &quot;Byte&quot; and &quot;EDN&quot; noted the lack of the ROR instruction. The next revision of the layout fixed this problem and the May 1976 datasheet listed 56 instructions. Peddle wanted every interested engineer and hobbyist to have access to the chips and documentation, whereas other semiconductor companies only wanted to deal with &quot;serious&quot; customers. For example, Signetics was introducing the 2650 microprocessor and its advertisements asked readers to write for information on their company letterhead.


===Motorola lawsuit===

The 6501/6502 introduction in print and at Wescon was an enormous success. The downside was that the extensive press coverage got Motorola&#x27;s attention. In October 1975, Motorola reduced the price of a single 6800 microprocessor from to . The system design kit was reduced to and it now came with a printed circuit board. On November 3, 1975, Motorola sought an injunction in Federal Court to stop MOS Technology from making and selling microprocessor products. They also filed a lawsuit claiming patent infringement and misappropriation of trade secrets. Motorola claimed that seven former employees joined MOS Technology to create that company&#x27;s microprocessor products.

Motorola was a billion-dollar company with a plausible case and expensive lawyers. On October 30, 1974, Motorola had filed numerous patent applications on the microprocessor family and was granted twenty-five patents. The first was in June 1976 and the second was to Bill Mensch on July 6, 1976, for the 6820 PIA chip layout. These patents covered the 6800 bus and how the peripheral chips interfaced with the microprocessor. Motorola began making transistors in 1950 and had a portfolio of semiconductor patents. Allen-Bradley decided not to fight this case and sold their interest in MOS Technology back to the founders. Four of the former Motorola engineers were named in the suit: Chuck Peddle, Will Mathys, Bill Mensch and Rod Orgill. All were named inventors in the 6800 patent applications. During the discovery process, Motorola found that one engineer, Mike Janes, had ignored Peddle&#x27;s instructions and brought his 6800 design documents to MOS Technology. In March 1976, the now independent MOS Technology was running out of money and had to settle the case. They agreed to drop the 6501 processor, pay Motorola ,000 and return the documents that Motorola contended were confidential. Both companies agreed to cross-license microprocessor patents. That May, Motorola dropped the price of a single 6800 microprocessor to . By November, Commodore had acquired MOS Technology.

===Computers and games===
With legal troubles behind them, MOS was still left with the problem of getting developers to try their processor, prompting Chuck Peddle to design the MDT-650 (&quot;microcomputer development terminal&quot;) single-board computer. Another group inside the company designed the KIM-1, which was sold semi-complete and could be turned into a usable system with the addition of a 3rd party computer terminal and compact cassette drive. While it sold well to its intended market, the company found the KIM-1 also sold well to hobbyists and tinkerers. The related Rockwell AIM-65 control, training, and development system also did well. The software in the AIM 65 was based on that in the MDT. Another roughly similar product was the Synertek SYM-1.

One of the first &quot;public&quot; uses for the design was the Apple I microcomputer, introduced in 1976. The 6502 was next used in the Commodore PET and Apple II, both released in 1977. It was later used in the Atari 8-bit computers, Acorn Atom, BBC Micro, VIC-20 and other designs both for home computers and business, such as Ohio Scientific and Oric computers. The 6510, a direct successor of the 6502 with a digital I/O port and a tri-state address bus, was the CPU utilized in the best-selling Commodore 64 home computer.

Another important use of the 6500 family was in video games. The first to make use of the processor design was the 1977 Atari VCS, later renamed the Atari 2600. The VCS used a 6502 variant named the 6507, which had fewer pins, so it could address only 8 KB of memory. Millions of the Atari consoles would be sold, each with a MOS processor. Another significant use was by the Nintendo Entertainment System and Famicom. The 6502 used in the NES was a second source version by Ricoh, a partial system on a chip, that lacked the binary-coded decimal mode but added 22 memory-mapped registers and on-die hardware for sound generation, joypad reading, and sprite list DMA. Called 2A03 in NTSC consoles and 2A07 in PAL consoles (the difference being the clock frequency divider ratio and a lookup table for audio sample rates), this processor was produced exclusively for Nintendo.

6502 or variants were used in all of Commodore&#x27;s floppy disk drives for all of their 8-bit computers, from the PET line through the Commodore 128D, including the Commodore 64. 8-inch PET drives had two 6502 processors. Atari used the same 6507 used in the Atari VCS for its 810 and 1050 disk drives used for all of their 8-bit computer line, from the 400/800 through the XEGS.

In the 1980s, a popular electronics magazine Elektor/Elektuur used the processor in its microprocessor development board Junior Computer.

The CMOS successor to the 6502, the WDC 65C02, also saw use in home computers and video game consoles. Apple used it in the Apple II line starting with the Apple IIc and later variants of the Apple IIe and also offered a kit to upgrade older IIe systems with the new processor. The Hudson Soft HuC6280 chip used in the TurboGrafx-16 was based on a 65C02 core. The Atari Lynx used a custom chip named &quot;Mikey&quot; designed by Epyx which included a VLSI VL65NC02 licensed cell. The G65SC12 by GTE Microcircuits (renamed California Micro Devices) variant was used in the BBC Master. Some models of the BBC Master also included an additional G65SC102 co-processor.

==Technical description==



The 6502 is a little-endian 8-bit processor with a 16-bit address bus. The original versions were fabricated using an process technology chip with a die size of , for a total area of .

The internal logic runs at the same speed as the external clock rate. It featured a simple pipeline; on each cycle, the processor fetches one byte from memory and processes another. This means that any single instruction can take as few as two cycles to complete, depending on the number of operands that instruction uses. For comparison, the Zilog Z80 required two cycles to fetch memory, and the minimum instruction time was four cycles. Thus, despite the lower clock speeds compared to competing designs, typically in the neighborhood of 1 to , the 6502&#x27;s performance was competitive with CPUs using significantly faster clocks. This is partly due to a simple state machine implemented by combinational (clockless) logic to a greater extent than in many other designs; the two-phase clock (supplying two synchronizations per cycle) could thereby control the machine cycle directly.

This design also led to one useful design note of the 6502, and the 6800 before it. Because the chip only accessed memory during a certain part of the clock cycle, and this duration was indicated by the φ2-low clock-out pin, other chips in a system could access memory during those times when the 6502 was off the bus. This was sometimes known as &quot;hidden access&quot;. This technique was widely used by computer systems; they would use memory capable of access at 2 MHz, and then run the CPU at 1 MHz. This guaranteed that the CPU and video hardware could interleave their accesses, with a total performance matching that of the memory device. Because this access was every other cycle, there was no need to signal the CPU to avoid using the bus, making this sort of access easy to implement without any bus logic.
 When faster memories became available in the 1980s, newer machines could use this same technique while running at higher clock rates, the BBC Micro used newer RAM that allowed its CPU to run at 2 MHz while still using the same bus sharing techniques.

Like most simple CPUs of the era, the dynamic NMOS 6502 chip is not sequenced by microcode but decoded directly using a dedicated PLA. The decoder occupied about 15% of the chip area. This compares to later microcode-based designs like the Motorola 68000, where the microcode ROM and decoder engine represented about a third of the gates in the system.

===Registers===
Like its precursor, the 6800, the 6502 has very few registers. They include

* codice_1 = 8-bit accumulator register
* codice_2 = 7-bit processor status register
** codice_3 = negative
** codice_4 = overflow
** codice_5 = break (only in stack values, not in hardware)
** codice_6 = decimal
** codice_7 = interrupt disable
** codice_8 = zero
** codice_9 = carry
* codice_10 = 16-bit program counter
* codice_11 = 8-bit stack pointer
* codice_12 = 8-bit index register
* codice_13 = 8-bit index register

This compares to a contemporaneous competitor, the Intel 8080, which likewise has one 8-bit accumulator and a 16-bit program counter, but has six more general-purpose 8-bit registers (which can be combined into three 16-bit pointers) and a larger 16-bit stack pointer.

In order to make up somewhat for the lack of registers, the 6502 includes a &quot;zero page&quot; addressing mode that uses one address byte in the instruction instead of the two needed to address the full of memory. This provides fast access to the first of RAM by using shorter instructions. For instance, an instruction to add a value from memory to the value in the accumulator would normally be three bytes, one for the instruction and two for the 16-bit address. Using the zero page reduces this to an 8-bit address, reducing the total instruction length to two bytes, and thus improving instruction performance.

The stack address space is to memory page codice_14, i.e. the address range codice_15–codice_16 (codice_17–codice_18). Software access to the stack is done via four implied addressing mode instructions, whose functions are to push or pop (pull) the accumulator or the processor status register. The same stack is also used for subroutine calls via the JSR (jump to subroutine) and RTS (return from subroutine) instructions and for interrupt handling.

===Addressing===
The chip uses the index and stack registers effectively with several addressing modes, including a fast &quot;direct page&quot; or &quot;zero page&quot; mode, similar to that found on the PDP-8, that accesses memory locations from addresses 0 to 255 with a single 8-bit address (saving the cycle normally required to fetch the high-order byte of the address)code for the 6502 uses the zero page much as code for other processors would use registers. On some 6502-based microcomputers with an operating system, the operating system uses most of zero page, leaving only a handful of locations for the user.

Addressing modes also include &quot;implied&quot; (1-byte instructions); &quot;absolute&quot; (3 bytes); &quot;indexed absolute&quot; (3 bytes); &quot;indexed zero-page&quot; (2 bytes); &quot;relative&quot; (2 bytes); &quot;accumulator&quot; (1); &quot;indirect,x&quot; and &quot;indirect,y&quot; (2); and &quot;immediate&quot; (2). Absolute mode is a general-purpose mode. Branch instructions use a signed 8-bit offset relative to the instruction after the branch; the numerical range −128..127 therefore translates to 128 bytes backward and 127 bytes forward from the instruction following the branch (which is 126 bytes backward and 129 bytes forward from the start of the branch instruction). Accumulator mode operates on the accumulator register and does not need any operand data. Immediate mode uses an 8-bit literal operand.

===Indirect addressing===
The indirect modes are useful for array processing and other looping. With the 5/6 cycle &quot;(indirect),y&quot; mode, the 8-bit Y register is added to a 16-bit base address read from zero page, which is located by a single byte following the opcode. The Y register is therefore an &quot;index&quot; register in the sense that it is used to hold an actual &quot;index&quot; (as opposed to the X register in the 6800, where a base address was directly stored and to which an immediate offset could be added). Incrementing the index register to walk the array byte-wise takes only two additional cycles. With the less frequently used &quot;(indirect,x)&quot; mode the effective address for the operation is found at the zero page address formed by adding the second byte of the instruction to the contents of the X register. Using the indexed modes, the zero page effectively acts as a set of up to 128 additional (though very slow) address registers.

The 6502 is capable of performing addition and subtraction in binary or binary-coded decimal. Placing the CPU into BCD mode with the codice_19 (set D flag) instruction results in decimal arithmetic, in which codice_20 would result in $00 and the carry (C) flag being set. In binary mode (codice_21, clear D flag), the same operation would result in $9A and the carry flag being cleared. Other than Atari BASIC, BCD mode was seldom used in home-computer applications.

See the article for a simple but characteristic example of 6502 assembly language.

===Instructions and opcodes===
6502 instruction operation codes (&quot;opcodes&quot;) are 8 bits long and have the general form AAABBBCC, where AAA and CC define the opcode, and BBB defines the addressing mode. For example, the codice_22 instruction performs a bitwise OR on the bits in the accumulator with another value. The instruction opcode is of the form 000bbb01, where bbb may be 010 for an immediate mode value (constant), 001 for zero-page fixed address, 011 for an absolute address, and so on. This pattern is not universal, as there are exceptions, but it allows opcode values to be easily converted to assembly mnemonics for the majority of instructions, handling the edge cases with special-purpose code.

Of the 256 possible opcodes available using an 8-bit pattern, the original 6502 uses 151 of them, organized into 56 instructions with (possibly) multiple addressing modes. Depending on the instruction and addressing mode, the opcode may require zero, one or two additional bytes for operands. Hence 6502 machine instructions vary in length from one to three bytes. The operand is stored in the 6502&#x27;s customary little-endian format.

Each CPU machine instruction takes up a certain number of clock cycles, usually equal to the number of memory accesses. For example, the absolute indexing mode of the ORA instruction takes 4 clock cycles; 3 cycles to read the instruction and 1 cycle to read the value of the absolute address. If no memory is accessed, the number of clock cycles is two. The minimum clock cycles for any instruction is two. When using indexed addressing, if the result crosses a page boundary an extra clock cycle is added. Also, when a zero page address is used in indexing mode (e.g. zp,X) an extra clock cycle is added.

The 65C816, the 16-bit CMOS descendant of the 6502, also supports 24-bit addressing, which results in instructions being assembled with three-byte operands, also arranged in little-endian format.

The remaining 105 opcodes are undefined. In the original design, instructions where the low-order 4 bits (&quot;nibble&quot;) were 3, 7, B or F were not used, providing room for future expansion. Likewise, the $2x column had only a single entry, codice_23. The remaining 25 empty slots were distributed. Some of the empty slots were used in the 65C02 to provide both new instructions and variations on existing ones with new addressing modes. The $Fx instructions were initially left free to allow 3rd-party vendors to add their own instructions, but later versions of the 65C02 standardized a set of bit manipulation instructions developed by Rockwell Semiconductor.

===Assembly language===
A 6502 assembly language statement consists of a three-character instruction mnemonic, followed by any operands. Instructions that do not take a separate operand but target a single register based on the addressing mode combine the target register in the instruction mnemonic, so the assembler uses codice_24 as opposed to codice_25 to increment the X register.

===Instruction table===
===Example code===
The following 6502 assembly language source code is for a subroutine named codice_26, which copies a null-terminated character string from one location to another, converting upper-case letter characters to lower-case letters. The string being copied is the &quot;source&quot;, and the string into which the converted source is stored is the &quot;destination&quot;.

==Detailed behavior==
The processor&#x27;s non-maskable interrupt (NMI) input is edge sensitive, which means that the interrupt is triggered by the falling edge of the signal rather than its level. The implication of this feature is that a wired-OR interrupt circuit is not readily supported. However, this also prevents nested NMI interrupts from occurring until the hardware makes the NMI input inactive again, often under control of the NMI interrupt handler.

The simultaneous assertion of the NMI and IRQ (maskable) hardware interrupt lines causes IRQ to be ignored. However, if the IRQ line remains asserted after the servicing of the NMI, the processor will immediately respond to IRQ, as IRQ is level sensitive. Thus a sort of built-in interrupt priority was established in the 6502 design.

The B flag is set by the 6502&#x27;s periodically sampling its NMI edge detector&#x27;s output and its IRQ input. The IRQ signal being driven low is only recognized though if IRQs are allowed by the I flag. If in this way a NMI request or (maskable) IRQ is detected the B flag is set to zero and causes the processor to execute the BRK instruction next instead of executing the next instruction based on the program counter.

The BRK instruction then pushes the processor status onto the stack, with the B flag bit set to zero. At the end of its execution the BRK instruction resets the B flag&#x27;s value to one. This is the only way the B flag can be modified. If an instruction other than the BRK instruction pushes the B flag onto the stack as part of the processor status the B flag always has the value one.

A high-to-low transition on the SO input pin will set the processor&#x27;s overflow status bit. This can be used for fast response to external hardware. For example, a high-speed polling device driver can poll the hardware once in only three cycles using a Branch-on-oVerflow-Clear (codice_27) instruction that branches to itself until overflow is set by an SO falling transition. The Commodore 1541 and other Commodore floppy disk drives use this technique to detect when the serializer is ready to transfer another byte of disk data. The system hardware and software design must ensure that an SO will not occur during arithmetic processing and disrupt calculations.

==Variations and derivatives ==
The 6502 was the most prolific variant of the 65xx series family from MOS Technology.

The 6501 and 6502 have 40-pin DIP packages; the 6503, 6504, 6505, and 6507 are 28-pin DIP versions, for reduced chip and circuit board cost. In all of the 28-pin versions, the pin count is reduced by leaving off some of the high-order address pins and various combinations of function pins, making those functions unavailable.

Typically, the 12 pins omitted to reduce the pin count from 40 to 28 are the three not connected (NC) pins, one of the two Vss pins, one of the clock pins, the SYNC pin, the set overflow (SO) pin, either the maskable interrupt or the non-maskable interrupt (NMI), and the four most-significant address lines (A12–A15). The omission of four address pins reduces the external addressability to 4 KB (from the 64 KB of the 6502), though the internal PC register and all effective address calculations remain 16-bit.

The 6507 omits both interrupt pins in order to include address line A12, providing 8 KB of external addressability but no interrupt capability. The 6507 was used in the popular Atari 2600 video game console, the design of which divides the 8 KB memory space in half, allocating the lower half to the console&#x27;s internal RAM and peripherals, and the upper half to the Game Cartridge, so Atari 2600 cartridges have a 4 KB address limit (and the same capacity limit unless the cartridge contains bank switching circuitry).

One popular 6502-based computer, the Commodore 64, used a modified 6502 CPU, the 6510. Unlike the 6503–6505 and 6507, the 6510 is a 40-pin chip that adds internal hardware: a 6-bit parallel I/O port mapped to addresses 0000 and 0001. The 6508 is another chip that, like the 6510, adds internal hardware: 256 bytes of SRAM and an 8-bit I/O port similar to those featured by the 6510. Though these chips do not have reduced pin counts compared to the 6502, they need new pins for the added parallel I/O port. In this case, no address lines are among the removed pins.
===16-bit derivatives===
The Western Design Center designed and currently produces the WDC 65C816S processor, a 16-bit, static-core successor to the 65C02. The W65C816S is a newer variant of the 65C816, which is the core of the Apple IIGS computer and is the basis of the Ricoh 5A22 processor that powers the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The W65C816S incorporates minor improvements over the 65C816 that make the newer chip not an exact hardware-compatible replacement for the earlier one. Among these improvements was conversion to a static core, which makes it possible to stop the clock in either phase without the registers losing data. Available through electronics distributors, as of March 2020, the W65C816S is officially rated for 14 MHz operation.

The Western Design Center also designed and produced the 65C802, which was a 65C816 core with a 64-kilobyte address space in a 65(C)02 pin-compatible package. The 65C802 could be retrofitted to a 6502 board and would function as a 65C02 on power-up, operating in &quot;emulation mode.&quot; As with the 65C816, a two-instruction sequence would switch the 65C802 to &quot;native mode&quot; operation, exposing its 16-bit accumulator and index registers, and other 65C816 features. The 65C802 was not widely used and production ended.

==Bugs and quirks==
The 6502 had several bugs and quirks, which had to be accounted for when programming it:

* The earliest revisions of the 6502, such as those shipped with some KIM-1 computers, did not have a ROR (rotate right memory or accumulator) instruction. In these chips, the operation of the opcode that was later assigned to ROR is effectively an ASL (arithmetic shift left) instruction that does not affect the carry bit in the status register. Initially, MOS intentionally excluded ROR from the instruction set, deeming it not of enough value to justify its costs. In reaction to many customer inquirires, MOS promised in the second edition of the MCS6500 Programming Manual (document no. 6500-50A) that ROR would appear in 6502 chips starting in 1976. The vast majority of 6502 chips in existence today do feature the ROR instruction; these include all those CPUs originally installed in popular fully-assembled microcomputers such as the Apple II and Commodore 64 lines, all of which were manufactured after 1976.
* The NMOS 6502 family has a variety of undocumented instructions, which vary from one chip manufacturer to another. The 6502 instruction decoding is implemented in a hardwired logic array (similar to a programmable logic array) that is only defined for 151 of the 256 available opcodes. The remaining 105 trigger strange and occasionally hard-to-predict actions, such as crashing the processor, performing two valid instructions consecutively, performing strange mixtures of two instructions, or simply doing nothing at all. Some hardware designers used the undefined opcodes to extend the 6502 instruction set by detecting when a certain undefined opcode is fetched and performing an extension operation externally to the processor while substituting a neutral (NOP-like) opcode to the 6502 in order to make it idle while the external hardware handles the extension operation. Also, some programmers utilized this feature to extend the 6502 instruction set by providing functionality for the unimplemented opcodes with specially written software intercepted at the BRK instruction&#x27;s 0xFFFE vector. All of the undefined opcodes have been replaced with NOP instructions in the 65C02, an enhanced CMOS version of the 6502, although with varying byte sizes and execution times. (Some of them actually perform memory read operations but then ignore the data.) In the 65C802/65C816, all 256 opcodes perform defined operations.
* The 6502&#x27;s memory indirect jump instruction, codice_28, has a nonintuitive limitation which many users consider a defect. If &lt;address&gt; is hex xxFF (i.e., any word ending in FF), the processor will not jump to the address stored in xxFF and codice_29 as expected, but rather the one defined by xxFF and xx00 (for example, codice_30 would jump to the address stored in 10FF and 1000, instead of the one stored in 10FF and 1100). This can be avoided simply by not placing any indirect jump target address across a page boundary, and the MOS Technology MCS6500 Programming Manual gives reason to believe that this was the intention of the designers of the 6502, in order to save space on the chip that would have been used to implement the more complex behavior of conditionally adding 1 clock cycle to propagate the carry when necessary. This ostensible defect continued through the entire NMOS line but was corrected in the CMOS derivatives.
* The NMOS 6502 indexed addressing across page boundaries will do an extra read of an invalid address in the page of the base address (to which the index is added). This characteristic may cause random issues by accessing hardware that acts on a read, such as clearing timer or IRQ flags, sending an I/O handshake, etc. The extra read can be predicted and managed to avoid such problems, but only with special care in both hardware and software design. This flaw continued through the entire NMOS line but was corrected in the CMOS derivatives, in which the processor does an extra read of the last instruction byte.
* The 6502 read–modify–write instructions perform one read and two write cycles. First, the unmodified data that was read is written back, and then the modified data is written. This characteristic may cause issues by twice accessing hardware that acts on a write. This anomaly continued through the full NMOS line but was fixed in the CMOS derivatives, in which the processor does two reads and one write cycle. Defensive programming practice will generally avoid this problem by not executing read/modify/write instructions on hardware registers.
* The N (result negative), V (sign bit overflow) and Z (result zero) status flags are generally meaningless when performing arithmetic operations while the processor is in BCD mode, as these flags are undefined in decimal mode and have been empirically shown to reflect the binary, not BCD, result. This limitation was removed in the CMOS derivatives, at the cost of one added clock cycle for an ADC or SBC instruction in decimal mode (except on the 65C816). Therefore, this feature may be used to distinguish a CMOS processor from an NMOS version (by relying on the undocumented behavior of the NMOS version).
* If the 6502 happens to be in BCD mode when a hardware interrupt occurs, it will not revert to binary mode. This characteristic could result in obscure bugs in the interrupt service routine (ISR) if it fails to clear BCD mode before performing any arithmetic operations. The 6502 programming manual thus requires each ISR to reset or set the D flag if it uses the ADC or SBC instruction, but occasionally a human programmer may mistakenly omit to do this, causing a bug. For example, the Commodore 64&#x27;s KERNAL did not correctly handle this processor characteristic, requiring that IRQs be disabled or re-vectored during BCD math operations. This issue was addressed in the CMOS derivatives also, by making reset and all interrupts automatically reset the D flag. (The change has the one disadvantage that it makes a [rare] program that operates continuously in decimal mode slightly longer and slower, as now every ISR must &quot;set&quot; the D flag before executing ADC or SBC.)
* The 6502 instruction set includes BRK (opcode $00), which is technically a software interrupt (similar in spirit to the SWI mnemonic of the Motorola 6800 and ARM processors). BRK is most often used to interrupt program execution and start a machine language monitor for testing and debugging during software development. BRK could also be used to route program execution using a simple jump table (analogous to the manner in which the Intel 8086 and derivatives handle software interrupts by number). However, if a maskable hardware interrupt occurs when the processor is fetching a BRK instruction, the NMOS version of the processor will fail to execute BRK and instead proceed as if only the hardware interrupt had occurred. This fault—an unequivocal hardware bug—was corrected in the CMOS implementation of the processor, which first calls the ISR for the hardware interrupt and then executes the BRK instruction.
* When executing JSR (jump to subroutine) and RTS (return from subroutine) instructions, the return address pushed to the stack by JSR is that of the last byte of the JSR operand (that is, the most significant byte of the subroutine address), rather than the address of the following instruction. This is because the actual copy (from program counter to stack and then conversely) takes place before the automatic increment of the program counter that occurs at the end of every instruction. This characteristic would go unnoticed unless the code examined the return address in order to retrieve parameters in the code stream (a 6502 programming idiom documented in the &quot;ProDOS 8 Technical Reference Manual&quot;). It remains a characteristic of 6502 derivatives to this day. The original MCS6500 Programming Manual points it out and explains the reason: it saves one clock cycle in the JSR by not incrementing the PC before pushing it, while in the RET instruction, the deferred increment of the pulled PC is overlapped with other steps and adds no clock cycle. As designed, a JSR and RET take 12 clock cycles total; if the JSR pushed the incremented PC, the call and return would take 13 clock cycles.
* The read access of the CPU can be delayed by setting the RDY pin to low temporarily. However, during write access, which can take up to three consecutive clock cycles for a BRK instruction, the CPU will stop only in the next read cycle. This quirk was corrected in the CMOS derivatives and also in the 6510 and its variants.

<text>The MOS Technology 6510 is an 8-bit microprocessor designed by MOS Technology. It is a modified form of the very successful 6502. The 6510 is widely used in the Commodore 64 (C64) home computer and its variants. It is also used in the Seagate ST-251 MFM harddisk.

The primary change from the 6502 is the addition of an 8-bit general purpose I/O port, although 6 I/O pins are available in the most common version of the 6510. In addition, the address bus can be made tristate and the CPU can be halted cleanly.

==Use==
In the C64, the extra I/O pins of the processor are used to control the computer&#x27;s memory map by bank switching, and for controlling three of the four signal lines of the Datasette tape recorder (the electric motor control, key-press sensing and write data lines; the read data line went to another I/O chip). It is possible, by writing the correct bit pattern to the processor at address $01, to completely expose almost the full 64 KB of RAM in the C64, leaving no ROM or I/O hardware exposed except for the processor I/O port itself and its data directional register at address $00.

==Variants==
=== MOS 8500 ===
In 1985, MOS produced the 8500, an HMOS version of the 6510. Other than the process modification, it is virtually identical to the NMOS version of the 6510. The 8500 was originally designed for use in the modernised C64, the C64C. However, in 1985, limited quantities of 8500s were found on older NMOS-based C64s. It finally made its official debut in 1987, appearing in a motherboard using the new 85xx HMOS chipset.

=== MOS 7501/8501 ===

The 7501/8501 variant of the 6510 was introduced in 1984. Compared to the 6510, this variant extends the number of I/O port pins from 6 to 8, but omits the pins for non-maskable interrupt and clock output. It is used in Commodore&#x27;s C16, C116 and Plus/4 home computers, where its I/O port controls not only the Datasette but also the CBM Bus interface. The main difference between 7501 and 8501 CPUs is that they were manufactured with slightly different processes: 7501 was manufactured with HMOS-1 and 8501 with HMOS-2.

=== MOS 8502 ===

The 2 MHz-capable 8502 variant is used in the Commodore 128. All these CPUs are opcode compatible (including undocumented opcodes).

=== MOS 6510T ===
The Commodore 1551 disk drive (for the Commodore Plus/4) uses the 6510T, a version of the 6510 with eight I/O lines. The NMI and RDY signals are not available.

<text>The 6800 (&quot;sixty-eight hundred&quot;) is an 8-bit microprocessor designed and first manufactured by Motorola in 1974. The MC6800 microprocessor was part of the M6800 Microcomputer System (later dubbed &quot;68xx&quot;) that also included serial and parallel interface ICs, RAM, ROM and other support chips. A significant design feature was that the M6800 family of ICs required only a single five-volt power supply at a time when most other microprocessors required three voltages. The M6800 Microcomputer System was announced in March 1974 and was in full production by the end of that year.

The 6800 has a 16-bit address bus that can directly access of memory and an 8-bit bi-directional data bus. It has 72 instructions with seven addressing modes for a total of 197 opcodes. The original MC6800 could have a clock frequency of up to . Later versions had a maximum clock frequency of .

In addition to the ICs, Motorola also provided a complete assembly language development system. The customer could use the software on a remote timeshare computer or on an in-house minicomputer system. The Motorola EXORciser was a desktop computer built with the M6800 ICs that could be used for prototyping and debugging new designs. An expansive documentation package included datasheets on all ICs, two assembly language programming manuals, and a 700-page application manual that showed how to design a point-of-sale terminal (a computerized cash register) around the 6800.

The 6800 was popular in computer peripherals, test equipment applications and point-of-sale terminals. It has also been used in arcade games and pinball machines. The MC6802, introduced in 1977, included 128 bytes of RAM and an internal clock oscillator on chip. The MC6801 and MC6805 included RAM, ROM and I/O on a single chip and were popular in automotive applications. Some MC6805 models integrated a Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI). The Motorola 6809 was an updated compatible design.

== History ==

=== Motorola&#x27;s history in semiconductors ===
Galvin Manufacturing Corporation was founded in 1928; the company name was changed to Motorola in 1947. They began commercial production of transistors at a new US$1.5 million facility in Phoenix, Arizona in 1955.

By the mid-1960s, Motorola had expanded their semiconductor division under the direction of Lester Hogan. Motorola&#x27;s transistors and integrated circuits were used in-house for their communication, military, automotive and consumer products and they were also sold to other companies. In 1968, Robert Noyce left Fairchild Semiconductor to found Intel, and Fairchild responded by hiring Hogan as the new CEO. Eight other Motorola employees moved with him, they became known as &quot;Hogan&#x27;s heroes&quot;. The resulting chaos was nevertheless short lived, and the company continued to grow through this period.

By 1973 the Semiconductor Products Division (SPD) had sales of $419 million and was the second largest semiconductor company after Texas Instruments.

===5065===

By the early 1970s it was clear that most of the large companies in the semiconductor space, including Fairchild and the still-new Intel, were planning to introduce microprocessors. Intel began shopping around the initial concept of what would become the Intel 4004, and on their sales trips they visited Victor Comptometer in Chicago looking for potential customers. Victor had introduced the world&#x27;s first electronic calculator that used integrated circuits, the Victor 3900. There, Tom Bennett saw the design.

In 1971, Motorola decided to enter the calculator business. Looking for someone to lead the effort, the hired Bennett away from Victor. Shortly after joining, Olivetti visited Motorola with a outline of a design for a microprocessor they were planning to use in a series of programmable calculators. Motorola agreed to complete the design and produce it on their PMOS lines in Phoenix.

While the design was eventually completed successfully, their fab proved unable to produce the chips. The problems with the line had become obvious with a number of similar failures; it also proved unable to make competitive memory devices and other designs. To save the contract, Motorola licensed the design to their competitor, Mostek, with the requirement that Mostek could only sell outside the calculator market. Mostek then put the design on the market as the Mostek 5065.

=== Development team ===
Customers continued to approach the company with new ideas, and it became increasingly obvious that these concepts could be implemented using a single flexible microprocessor design. A new effort began in late 1971, but in early 1972, the marketing department returned a report stating they could only sell 18,000 over a five year period. Unconvinced, Bennett hired Link Young to try again. Young returned with a potential order for 200,000 from National Data Corporation, more than enough to start design work.

The team was composed of designer Tom Bennett, engineering director Jeff LaVell, product marketer Link Young and systems designers Mike Wiles, Gene Schriber and Doug Powell. They were all located in Mesa, Arizona, in greater Phoenix. By the time the project was finished, Bennett had 17 chip designers and layout people working on five chips. LaVell had 15 to 20 system engineers and there was another applications engineering group of similar size.

Tom Bennett had a background in industrial controls and had worked for Victor Comptometer in the 1960s designing the first electronic calculator to use MOS ICs, the Victor 3900. In May 1969 Ted Hoff showed Bennett early diagrams of the Intel 4004 to see if it would meet their calculator needs. Bennett joined Motorola in 1971 to design calculator ICs. He was soon assigned as the chief architect of the microprocessor project that produced the 6800. Others have taken credit for designing the 6800. In September 1975 Robert H. Cushman, &quot;EDN&quot; magazine&#x27;s microprocessor editor, interviewed Chuck Peddle about MOS Technology&#x27;s new 6502 microprocessor. Cushman then asked &quot;Tom Bennett, master architect of the 6800&quot;, to comment about this new competitor. After the 6800 project Bennett worked on automotive applications and Motorola became a major supplier of microprocessors used in automobiles.

Jeff LaVell joined Motorola in 1966 and worked in the computer industry marketing organization. LaVell had previously worked for Collins Radio on their C8500 computer that was built with small scale ECL ICs. In 1971, he led a group that examined the needs of their existing customers such as Hewlett-Packard, National Cash Register, Control Data Corporation (CDC), and Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). They would study the customer&#x27;s products and try to identify functions that could be implemented in larger integrated circuits at a lower cost. The result of the survey was a family of 15 building blocks; each could be implemented in an integrated circuit. Some of these blocks were implemented in the initial M6800 release and more were added over the next few years. To evaluate the 6800 architecture while the chip was being designed, LaVell&#x27;s team built an equivalent circuit using 451 small scale TTL ICs on five 10 by 10 inch (25 by 25 cm) circuit boards. Later they reduced this to 114 ICs on one board by using ROMs and MSI (medium scale integration) logic devices.

John Buchanan was a memory designer at Motorola when Bennett asked him to design a voltage doubler for the 6800. Typical n-channel MOS IC&#x27;s required three power supplies: −5 volts, +5 volts and +12 volts. The M6800 family was to use only one, +5 volts. It was easy to eliminate the −5 volt supply by using an internal voltage inverter, but the enhancement-mode logic also needed a supply of 10 to 12 volts. To address this, the design added an on-chip voltage doubler. Buchanan did the circuit design, analysis and layout for the 6800 microprocessor. He received patents on the voltage doubler and the 6800 chip layout. Rod Orgill assisted Buchanan with analyses and 6800 chip layout. Later Orgill would design the MOS Technology 6501 microprocessor that was socket compatible with the 6800.

Bill Lattin joined Motorola in 1969 and his group provided the computer simulation tools for characterizing the new MOS circuits in the 6800. Lattin and Frank Jenkins had both attended UC Berkeley and studied computer circuit simulators under Donald Pederson, the designer of the SPICE circuit simulator. Motorola&#x27;s simulator, MTIME, was an advanced version of the TIME circuit simulator that Jenkins had developed at Berkeley. The group published a technical paper, &quot;MOS-device modeling for computer implementation&quot; in 1973 describing a &quot;5-V single-supply n-channel technology&quot; operating at 1 MHz. They could simulate a 50 MOSFET circuit on an IBM 370/165 mainframe computer. In November 1975, Lattin joined Intel to work on their next generation microprocessor.

Bill Mensch joined Motorola in 1971 after graduating from the University of Arizona. He had worked several years as an electronics technician before earning his BSEE degree. The first year at Motorola was a series of three-month rotations through four different areas. Mensch did a flowchart for a modem that would become the 6860. He also worked the application group that was defining the M6800 system. After this training year, he was assigned to the 6820 Peripheral Interface Adapter (PIA) development team. Mensch was a major contributor to the design of this chip and received a patent on the IC layout and was named as a co-inventor of seven other M6800 system patents. Later Mensch would design the MOS Technology 6502 microprocessor.

Mike Wiles was a design engineer in Jeff LaVell&#x27;s group and made numerous customer visits with Tom Bennett during 6800 product definition phase. He is listed as an inventor on eighteen 6800 patents but is best known for a computer program, MIKBUG. This was a monitor for a 6800 computer system that allowed the user to examine the contents of RAM and to save or load programs to tape. This 512 byte program occupied half of an MCM6830 ROM. This ROM was used in the Motorola MEK6800 design evaluation kit and early hobby computer kits. Wiles stayed with Motorola, moved to Austin and helped design the MC6801 microcontroller that was released in 1978.

Chuck Peddle joined the design team in 1973 after the 6800 processor design was done but he contributed to overall system design and to several peripheral chips, particularly the 6820 (PIA) parallel interface. Peddle is listed as an inventor on sixteen Motorola patents, most have six or more co-inventors. Like the other engineers on the team, Peddle visited potential customers and solicited their feedback. Peddle and John Buchanan built one of the earliest 6800 demonstration boards. In August 1974, Chuck Peddle left Motorola and joined a small semiconductor company in Pennsylvania, MOS Technology. There he led the team that designed the 6500 microprocessor family.

=== MC6800 microprocessor design ===


The Motorola 6800 and the Intel 8080 were designed at the same time and were similar in function. The 8080 was an extension and enhancement of the Intel 8008, which in turn was an LSI implementation of the TTL-based CPU design used in the Datapoint 2200. The 6800 architecture was a TTL-compatible LSI design modeled after the DEC PDP-11 processor.

The 6800 had an 8-bit bidirectional data bus, a 16-bit address bus that could address 64 KB of memory, and came in a 40-pin DIP package. The 6800 had two 8-bit accumulators, a 16-bit index register, and a 16-bit stack pointer. The direct addressing mode, often known as the zero page in other processors, allowed fast access to the first 256 bytes of memory. I/O devices were addressed as memory so there were no special I/O instructions. When the 6800 was reset, it loaded the program counter from the highest address and started execution at the memory location stored there.

The 6800 had a three-state control that would disable the address bus to allow another device direct memory access. For instance, a floppy disk controller could load data into memory without requiring any support from the CPU. It was even possible to have two 6800 processors access the same memory. However, in practice systems of such complexity usually required the use of external bus transceivers to drive the system bus; in such circuits, the on-processor bus control was disabled entirely in favor of using the similar capabilities of the bus transceiver. In contrast, the 6802 dispensed with this on-chip control entirely in order to free up pins for other functions in the same 40-pin package as the 6800, but this functionality could still be achieved using an external bus transceiver.

MOS ICs typically used dual clock signals (a two-phase clock) in the 1970s. These were generated externally for the 6800, The 6800 had a minimum clock rate of 100 kHz, and initially ran at a maximum rate of 1 MHz. Higher-speed versions of the 6800 were released in 1976.

Other divisions in Motorola developed components for the M6800 family. The Components Products Department designed the MC6870 two-phase clock IC, and the Memory Products group provided a full line of ROMs and RAMs. The CMOS group&#x27;s MC14411 Bit Rate Generator provided a 75 to 9600 baud clock for the MC6850 serial interface. The buffers for address and data buses were standard Motorola products. Motorola could supply every IC, transistor, and diode necessary to build an MC6800-based computer.

=== MOS ICs ===
The first-generation metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) chips used p-channel field-effect transistors, known as p-channel MOSFETs (p-channel describes the configuration of the transistor). These ICs were used in calculators and in the first microprocessor, the Intel 4004. They were easy to produce but were slow and difficult to interface to the popular TTL digital logic ICs. An n-channel MOS integrated circuit could operate two or three times faster and was compatible with TTL. They were much more difficult to produce because of an increased sensitivity to contamination that required an ultra clean production line and meticulous process control. Motorola did not have an n-channel MOS production capability and had to develop one for the 6800 family.

Motorola&#x27;s n-channel MOS test integrated circuits were complete in late 1971 and these indicated the clock rate would be limited to 1 MHz. These used &quot;enhancement-mode&quot; MOS transistors. There was a newer fabrication technology that used &quot;depletion-mode&quot; MOS transistors as loads, which would allow smaller and faster circuits (this was also known as depletion-load nMOS). The &quot;depletion-mode&quot; processing required extra steps so Motorola decided to stay with &quot;enhancement-mode&quot; for the new single-supply-voltage design. The 1 MHz clock rate meant the chip designers would have to come up with several architectural innovations to speed up the microprocessor throughput. These resulting circuits were faster but required more area on the chip.

In the 1970s, semiconductors were fabricated on 3 inch (75 mm) diameter silicon wafers. Each wafer could produce 100 to 200 integrated circuit chips or dies. The technical literature would state the length and width of each chip in &quot;mils&quot; (0.001 inch). The current industry practice is to state the chip area. Processing wafers required multiple steps and flaws would appear at various locations on the wafer during each step. The larger the chip the more likely it would encounter a defect. The percentage of working chips, or yield, declined steeply for chips larger than 160 mils (4 mm) on a side.

The target size for the 6800 was 180 mils (4.6 mm) on each side but the final size was 212 mils (5.4 mm) with an area of 29.0 mm2. At 180 mils, a wafer will hold about 190 chips, 212 mils reduces that to 140 chips. At this size the yield may be 20% or 28 chips per wafer. The Motorola 1975 annual report highlights the new MC6800 microprocessor but has several paragraphs on the &quot;MOS yield problems.&quot; 

The yield problem was solved with a design revision started in 1975 to use depletion mode in the M6800 family devices. The 6800 die size was reduced to 160 mils (4 mm) per side with an area of 16.5 mm2. This also allowed faster clock speeds, the MC68A00 would operate at 1.5 MHz and the MC68B00 at 2.0 MHz. The new parts were available in July 1976.

=== M6800 family introduction ===
The March 7, 1974 issue of &quot;Electronics&quot; had a two-page story on the Motorola MC6800 microprocessor along with the MC6820 Peripheral Interface Adapter, the MC6850 Asynchronous Communications Interface Adapter, the MCM6810 128 byte RAM and the MCM6830 1024 byte ROM. This was followed by an eight-page article in the April 18, 1974 issue, written by the Motorola design team. This issue also had an article introducing the Intel 8080.

Both the Intel 8080 and the Motorola MC6800 processors began layout around December 1972. The first working 8080 chips were produced January 1974 and the first public announcement was in February 1974. The 8080 used same three voltage N-channel MOS process as Intel&#x27;s existing memory chips allowing full production to begin that April.

The first working MC6800 chips were produced in February 1974 and engineering samples were given to select customers. Hewlett-Packard in Loveland, Colorado wanted the MC6800 for a new desktop calculator and had a prototype system working by June. The MC6800 used a new single-voltage N-channel MOS process that proved to be very difficult to implement. The M6800 microcomputer system was finally in production by November 1974. Motorola matched Intel&#x27;s price for single microprocessor, $360. (The IBM System/360 was a well-known computer at this time.) In April 1975 the MEK6800D1 microcomputer design kit was offered for $300. The kit included all six chips in the M6800 family plus application and programming manuals. The price of a single MC6800 microprocessor was $175.

Link Young was the product marketer that developed the total system approach for the M6800 family release. In addition to releasing a full set of support chips with the 6800 microprocessor, Motorola offered a software and hardware development system. The software development tools were available on remote time-sharing computers or the source code was available so the customer could use an in-house computer system. The software that would run on a microprocessor system was typically written in assembly language. The development system consisted of a text editor, assembler and a simulator. This allowed the developer to test the software before the target system was complete. The hardware development was a desktop computer built with M6800 family CPU and peripherals known as the EXORcisor. Motorola offered a three- to five-day microprocessor design course for the 6800 hardware and software. This systems-oriented approach became the standard way new microprocessor were introduced.

=== Design team breakup ===
The principal design effort on the M6800 family was complete in mid-1974, and many engineers left the group or the company. Several factors led to the break-up of the design group.

Motorola had opened a new MOS semiconductor facility in Austin, Texas. The entire engineering team was scheduled to relocate there in 1975. Many of the employees liked living in the Phoenix suburb of Mesa and were very wary about moving to Austin. The team leaders were unsuccessful with their pleas to senior management on deferring the move.

A recession hit the semiconductor industry in mid-1974 resulting in thousands of layoffs. A November 1974 issue of &quot;Electronics&quot; magazine reports that Motorola had laid off 4,500 employees, Texas Instruments 7,000 and Signetics 4,000. Motorola&#x27;s Semiconductor Products Division would lose thirty million dollars in the next 12 months and there were rumors that the IC group would be sold off. Motorola did not sell the division but they did change the management and organization. By the end of 1974 Intel fired almost a third of its 3,500 employees. The MOS IC business rebounded but job security was not taken for granted in 1974 and 1975.

Chuck Peddle (and other Motorola engineers) had been visiting customers to explain the benefits of microprocessors. Both Intel and Motorola had initially set the price of a single microprocessor at . Many customers were hesitant to adopt this new microprocessor technology with such a high price tag. (The actual price for production quantities was much lower.) In mid-1974 Peddle proposed a simplified microprocessor that could be sold at a much lower price. Motorola&#x27;s &quot;total product family&quot; strategy did not focus on the price of MPU but on reducing the customer&#x27;s total design cost. Peddle&#x27;s concept was repeatedly rejected, and eventually management told him to stop talking about it. He wrote a memo stating that these instructions were a clear statement that Motorola was abandoning the concept, meaning they could not claim intellectual property against it.

Peddle continued working for Motorola while looking for investors for his new microprocessor concept. After approaching Mostek and being rejected, in August 1974 Chuck Peddle left Motorola and joined a small semiconductor company in Pennsylvania, MOS Technology. He was followed by seven other Motorola engineers: Harry Bawcom, Ray Hirt, Terry Holdt, Mike James, Will Mathis, Bill Mensch and Rod Orgill. Peddle&#x27;s group at MOS Technology developed two new microprocessors that were compatible with the Motorola peripheral chips like the 6820 PIA. Rod Orgill designed the MCS6501 processor that would plug into a MC6800 socket and Bill Mensch did the MCS6502 that had the clock generation circuit on chip. These microprocessors would not run 6800 programs because they had a different architecture and instruction set. The major goal was a microprocessor that would sell for under . This would be done by removing non-essential features to reduce the chip size. An 8-bit stack pointer was used instead of a 16-bit one. The second accumulator was omitted. The address buffers did not have a three-state mode for Direct Memory Access (DMA) data transfers. The goal was to get the chip size down to 153 mils x 168 mils ().

Peddle was a very effective spokesman and the MOS Technology microprocessors were extensively covered in the trade press. One of the earliest was a full-page story on the MCS6501 and MCS6502 microprocessors in the July 24, 1975 issue of &quot;Electronics&quot; magazine. Stories also ran in &quot;EE Times&quot; (August 24, 1975), &quot;EDN&quot; (September 20, 1975), &quot;Electronic News&quot; (November 3, 1975) and &quot;Byte&quot; (November 1975). Advertisements for the 6501 appeared in several publications the first week of August 1975. The 6501 would be for sale at the WESCON trade show in San Francisco, September 16–19, 1975, for each. In September 1975 the advertisements included both the 6501 and the 6502 microprocessors. The 6502 would only cost .

Motorola responded to MOS Technology&#x27;s microprocessor by immediately reducing the single-unit price of the 6800 microprocessor from to and then suing MOS Technology in November 1975. Motorola claimed that the eight former Motorola engineers used technical information developed at Motorola in the design of the 6501 and 6502 microprocessors. MOS Technology&#x27;s other business, calculator chips, was declining due to a price war with Texas Instruments so their financial backer, Allen-Bradley, decided to limit the possible losses and sold the assets of MOS Technology back to the founders. The lawsuit was settled in April 1976 with MOS Technology dropping the 6501 chip that would plug into a Motorola 6800 socket and licensing Motorola&#x27;s peripheral chips. Motorola reduced the single-unit price of the 6800 to .

The MOS Technology vs. Motorola lawsuit has developed a David and Goliath narrative over the years. One point was that Motorola did not have patents on the technology. This was technically true when the lawsuit was filed in late 1975 On October 30, 1974, before the 6800 was released, Motorola filed numerous patents applications on the microprocessor family, and over twenty patents were subsequently granted. The first was to Tom Bennett on June 8, 1976, for the 6800 internal address bus. The second was to Bill Mensch on July 6, 1976, for the 6820 chip layout. Many of these patents named several of the departing engineers as co-inventors. These patents covered the 6800 bus and how the peripheral chips interfaced with the microprocessor.

=== Move to Austin ===
Gary Daniels was designing ICs for electronic wristwatches when Motorola shut down their Timepiece Electronics Unit. Tom Bennett offered him a job in the microprocessor group in November 1974. Bennett did not want to leave the Phoenix area so Gary Daniels managed the microprocessor development in Austin. (Daniels was the microprocessor design manager for the next ten years before he was promoted to a vice president.)

The first task was to redesign the 6800 MPU to improve the manufacturing yield and to operate at a faster clock. This design used depletion-mode technology and was known internally as the MC6800D. The transistor count went from 4000 to 5000 but the die area was reduced from 29.0 mm2 to 16.5 mm2 (allowing the price of the CPU to be lowered to $35). The maximum clock rate for selected parts doubled to 2 MHz. The other chips in the M6800 family were also redesigned to use depletion-mode technology. The Peripheral Interface Adapter had a slight change in the electrical characteristics of the I/O pins so the MC6820 became the MC6821. These new IC were completed in July 1976.

A new low-cost clock generator chip, the MC6875, was released in 1977. It replaced the $35 MC6870 hybrid IC. The MC6875 came in a 16-pin dip package and could use quartz crystal or a resistor capacitor network.

Another project was incorporating 128 bytes of RAM and the clock generator on a single 11,000-transistor chip. The MC6802 microprocessor was released in March 1977. The companion MC6846 chip had 2048 byte ROM, an 8-bit bidirectional port and a programmable timer. This was a two-chip microcomputer. The 6802 has an on-chip oscillator that uses an external 4 MHz quartz crystal to produce the two-phase 1 MHz clock. The internal 128 byte RAM could be disabled by grounding a pin and devices with defective RAM were sold as a MC6808. The 6808 was rarely used as the main microprocessor on general-purpose computers, being more popular in embedded systems (the 1979 ACFA-8 microcomputer proved an exception).

A series of peripheral chip were introduced by 1978. The MC6840 programmable counter had three 16-bit binary counters that could be used for frequency measurement, event counting, or interval measurement. The MC6844 Direct Memory Access Controller could transfer data from an I/O controller to RAM without loading down the MC6800 microprocessor. The MC6845 CRT Controller (CRTC) provided the control logic for a character based computer terminal. The 6845 had support for a light pen, an alternative to a computer mouse.

The MC6845 was a very popular chip: it was even used in the original IBM Monochrome Display Adapter and the original IBM Color Graphics Adapter for the IBM PC and successors, where the 6845 was used with an Intel 8088 CPU. During the time of cold war technology embargoes, a 6845 clone named CM607 was produced in Bulgaria. The later IBM Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA) card contained a custom IBM chip (the EGA CRTC) that replaced the Motorola 6845, adding many enhancements, in a mostly-compatible way. The IBM Video Graphics Array (VGA), which became ubiquitous (to the point that it is still emulated as the baseline functionality of most modern PC video adapter chips) incorporates a compatible near-superset of the EGA CRTC, still mostly-compatible with the MC6845 (but by this point without the light pen support, which the EGA CRTC retained).

The MC6801 was a single-chip microcomputer (that today would also be called a microcontroller) incorporating a 6802 CPU with 128 bytes of RAM, a 2 KB ROM, a 16-bit timer, 31 programmable parallel I/O lines, and a serial port. (The MC6803 was the same except without the ROM and with fewer different bus configurations.) It could also use the I/O lines as data and address buses to connect to standard M6800 peripherals. The 6801 would execute 6800 code, but it had ten additional instructions, and the execution time of key instructions was reduced. The two 8-bit accumulators could act as a single 16-bit accumulator for double precision addition, subtraction and multiplication. It was initially designed for automotive use, with General Motors as the lead customer. The first application was a trip computer for the 1978 Cadillac Seville. This 35,000 transistor chip was too expensive for wide-scale adoption in automobiles, so a reduced function MC6805 single-chip microcomputer was designed.
The MC6801 was one of the first microprocessors with a multiply instruction.

The Hitachi HD6303 (not to be confused with the Hitachi 6309) is a second-source reimplementation of the Motorola MC6803, with a few additional instructions, and a slightly faster implementation of the 8x8 multiply instruction. The Hitachi HD6303 is used in the first PDA, the 1984 Psion Organiser.
The Hitachi HD6303 was also used in the 1983 &quot;Pocket Telex&quot;.

The Motorola MC6803 was also used in the TRS-80 MC-10 and the closely related Matra Alice.

The MC6809 was the most advanced 8-bit microprocessor Motorola produced. It had a new instruction set that was similar to the 6800 but abandoned op-code compatibility for improved performance and high-level language support; the 6809 and 6800 were software compatible in that assemblers could (and generally did) generate code which was equivalent to 6800 opcodes that the 6809 did not directly emulate. In that sense, the 6809 was upward compatible with the 6800. The 6809 had two 16-bit index registers, two 16-bit stack pointers, and many instructions to perform 16-bit operations, including the first 8-bit multiply instruction (generating a 16-bit product) in a microprocessor. Other key points of the 6809 design were full support for both position-independent code (object code that can run wherever it is loaded in memory) and reentrant code (object code that can be re-invoked when interrupted or by calling itself recursively), features previously seen only in much larger machines such as IBM 360 mainframes.

== Use in personal computers ==
The MITS Altair 8800, the first successful personal computer, used the Intel 8080 microprocessor and was featured on the January 1975 cover of &quot;Popular Electronics&quot;. The first personal computers using the Motorola 6800 were introduced in late 1975. Sphere Corporation of Bountiful, Utah ran a quarter-page advertisement in the July 1975 issue of &quot;Radio-Electronics&quot; for a computer kit with a 6800 microprocessor, of RAM, a video board and a keyboard. This would display 16 lines of 32 characters on a TV or monitor. The Sphere computer kits began shipping in November 1975. Southwest Technical Products Corporation of San Antonio, Texas, officially announced their SWTPC 6800 Computer System in November 1975. Wayne Green visited SWTPC in August 1975 and described the SWTPC computer kit complete with photos of a working system in the October 1975 issue of &quot;73&quot;. The SWTPC 6800 was based on the Motorola MEK6800 design evaluation kit chip set and used the MIKBUG ROM Software. The MITS Altair 680 was on the cover of the November 1975 issue of &quot;Popular Electronics&quot;. The Altair 680 used a 6800 microprocessor and, unlike the SWTPC machine, also had a front panel with toggle switches and LEDs. The initial design had to be revised and first deliveries of the Altair 680B were in April 1976.

Sphere was a small startup company and had difficulties delivering all of the products they announced. They filed for a Chapter 11 bankruptcy in April 1977. The Altair 680B was popular but MITS focused most of the resources on their Altair 8800 computer system and they exited the hobby market in 1978. The Southwest Technical Products computer was the most successful 6800 based personal computer. Other companies, for instance, Smoke Signal Broadcasting (California), Gimix (Chicago), Midwest Scientific (Olathe, Kansas), and Helix Systems (Hazelwood, Missouri), started producing SWTPC 6800 bus compatible boards and complete systems. Technical Systems Consultants of West Lafayette, Indiana, supplied tape based software for the 6800 (and later 6809) based computers and, after disk systems became available, operating systems and disk software as well. The 8080 systems were far more popular than the 6800 ones.

The Tektronix 4051 Graphics Computing System was introduced in October 1975. This was a professional desktop computer that had a 6800 microprocessor with up to 32 KB of user RAM, 300 KB magnetic tape storage, BASIC in ROM and a 1024 by 780 graphics display. The Tektronix 4051 sold for (), rather higher than the personal computers using the 6800.

The 6800 processor was also used in the APF MP1000 game console. The Matsushita JR series used a Panasonic MN1800A NMOS microprocessor, compatible with the MC6802.

HP introduced the 9815A desktop calculator based on the 6800 in 1975. All HP&#x27;s other machines at the time used their own processor designs. It was fitted with 16k of ROM and 2k of RAM with optional IO expansion and RAM expansion to 4k. A later 9815S included both options as standard.

The architecture and instruction set of the 6800 were easy for beginners to understand and Heathkit developed a microprocessor course and the ET3400 6800 trainer. The course and trainer proved popular with individuals and schools.

Motorola&#x27;s next generation 8-bit microprocessor architecture, the MC6809 (1979), was not binary code compatible with the 6800, but nearly all assembly code would assemble and run on the 6809; 6800 family peripheral chips worked as a matter of course.

== Example code ==
The following 6800 assembly language source code is for a subroutine named codice_1 that copies a block of data bytes of a given size from one location to another. The data block is copied one byte at a time, from lowest address to highest.

; memcpy --
; Copy a block of memory from one location to another.
; Called as a subroutine, note return to saved PC addr on exit
; Entry parameters
; cnt - Number of bytes to copy
; src - Address of source data block
; dst - Address of target data block

cnt dw $0000 ; sets aside space for memory addr
src dw $0000 ; sets aside space for memory addr
dst dw $0000 ; sets aside space for memory addr

memcpy public
 ldab cnt+1 ;Set B = cnt.L
 beq check ;If cnt.L=0, goto check
loop ldx src ;Set IX = src
 ldaa ix ;Load A from (src)
 inx ;Set src = src+1
 stx src
 ldx dst ;Set IX = dst
 staa ix ;Store A to (dst)
 inx ;Set dst = dst+1
 stx dst
 decb ;Decr B
 bne loop ;Repeat the loop
check tst cnt+0 ;If cnt.H=0,
 beq done ;Then quit
 dec cnt+0 ;Decr cnt.H
 ; loop back and do 256*(cnt.H+1) more copies (B=0) 
 bra loop ;Repeat the loop
done rts ;Return
== Peripherals ==
List from &quot;Motorola Microcomputer Components&quot;, November 1978. Memory-mapped I/O is used, and I/O ports are mapped to part of the main memory address space.
== Second sources ==
A common requirement for manufacturing companies was to require two or more sources for every part in the products they made. This ensured they could get parts if a supplier had financial problems or a disaster. Initially Motorola selected American Microsystems Inc (AMI) as a second source for the M6800 family. Hitachi, Fujitsu, Fairchild, Rockwell and Thomson Semiconductors were added later. 

Rochester Electronics was authorized by Freescale/Motorola in 2014 to continue manufacturing any of the 8-bit peripherals and 8-bit processors of this era. Rochester specializes in fully authorized device duplication. Freescale has provided all the source design archives to enable Rochester Electronics for this product and others. At the end of 2016, Rochester was fully qualified and shipping the MC6802 processor, the MC6840 PTM, and the MC6809 processor (including the MC68A09, and MC68B09 versions) and can still be bought today.

<text>The Motorola 68020 is a 32-bit microprocessor from Motorola, released in 1984. A lower-cost version was also made available, known as the 68EC020. In keeping with naming practices common to Motorola designs, the 68020 is usually referred to as the &quot;020&quot;, pronounced &quot;oh-two-oh&quot; or &quot;oh-twenty&quot;.

The 020 was in the market for a relatively short time. The Motorola 68030 was announced in September 1986 and began deliveries in the summer of 1987. Priced about the same as the 020 of the time, the 030 was significantly faster and quickly replaced in 020 in almost every use.

==History==
===68000 and 68010===
At the time the Motorola 68000 was designed, Motorola&#x27;s design and fabrication services were outdated. Although even small companies like MOS Technology and Zilog had moved on to silicon gate depletion mode NMOS logic on ever-larger wafers, Motorola was still using metal gates and enhancement mode and their largest fab worked on 4-inch wafers long after most lines had moved to 5-inch. Although the 68000 met the goal of being the fastest CPU available when it was introduced, it was not nearly as powerful as it could be if it had been designed with more modern techniques.

During the period of the 68000 design, the company was working with Hitachi on their process technology and as part of this they opened a new fab, MOS-8, using 5-inch wafers and the latest HMOS process licensed from Intel. This line was capable of building all of the new techniques, but the 68000 went ahead with the older design as they were sure it would work. Moving to new design techniques would wait until the design was in the market. The conversion to the new design techniques took place during the Motorola 68010 effort, a relatively minor upgrade to the original design that added basic virtual memory support for the emerging Unix workstation market.

===020 concept emerges===
As this effort was ongoing, Motorola was canvassing their customers for their desires for future developments in the line. These all pointed to a fully 32-bit implementation. Those using the 68k in Unix systems also stated they would purchase a floating-point unit for every one of the machines if one was available.

The original 68000 had been designed as a hybrid 16/32-bit system largely because the maximum number of pins available on dual inline packages (DIPs) was 64, and even at that size, packaging of this size was highly problematic. By reducing the number of address pins to 24, and the data pins to only 16, there were enough free pins to implement all the other needed lines, like interrupts and power supplies. The 24-pin address bus meant that the memory could only be 16 MB in total, which was at this point becoming a limitation. The 16-bit data bus meant reading a 32-bit word from that memory required two bus cycles.

A design that had 32 pins for both the address and data busses would access data twice as fast, making the machine that much faster even with no other changes. Moving to 32-bit addressing would also make the implementation of virtual memory easier, and allow for more than 16 MB of random access memory. But doing so would also demand a much higher total pin count. By the early 1980s, similar limitations on all modern CPU designs led to the introduction of the pin grid array that replaced the DIP. For the new project, Motorola selected a 169-pin layout, giving them plenty of room to work with. The design ultimately used only 114 of them.

A great debate broke out about how to refer to the underlying design of the new chip in marketing materials. Technically, the 020 was moving from the long-established NMOS logic design to a CMOS layout, which requires two transistors per gate. Common knowledge of the era suggested that CMOS cost four times as much as NMOS, and there was a significant amount of the market that believed &quot;CMOS equals bad.&quot;

===Launch, fabrication problems===
The design was completed in the summer of 1983 and announced in June 1984. This &quot;super chip&quot; was significant news at the time, with the New York Times making it a lead story in their business section. The launch price was quoted at $487 each, about the same as the 68000 when it was launched in 1980, but the 68000 was now available for about $15. However, it was understood that it would be some time before computers using the new chip would be available, as existing designs would have to be heavily modified to take advantage of its performance.

The announcement led to Motorola&#x27;s customers clamouring for supply. At this point, serious supply problems became evident. The design had been laid out to be built in the same MOS-8 factory as the 68000, although several new pieces of equipment were introduced to support it. By the time of the public release, the yield for the new chip was zero. That is, for every wafer sent through the multi-step process, zero working chips would be produced.

Gary Johnson concluded the problem was the floor manager of MOS-8, Tom Felesi, and decided to replace him with Bill Walker, who was at that time running the older MOS-2 factory. Walker arrived at the plant on 5 July 1985 to find Johnson had not bothered to tell Felesi of the change, and arguments followed. Johnson eventually told Felesi this was indeed happening. Walker then toured the plant and found it had been turned into what was essentially a research and development lab, not a production line, with numerous bits of machinery in use nowhere else.

One significant issue was a new piece of equipment from a new vendor, Genus, which produced tungsten silicide. The machine simply didn&#x27;t work. Walker flew to California to meet with the CEO of Genus, who offered up nothing but excuses. Walker eventually slammed his hand down on the desk, breaking his watch band, and stated &quot;No more excuses! I want this thing fixed now, today!&quot; Genus took the demand seriously and fixed the machine. The CEO later sent Walker a new watch band to commemorate the event.

Meanwhile, Walker instituted a new policy at MOS-8 to improve the plant itself. He normally called meetings at 6:30 AM. If things were not going well, he would move that up to 5:30, and even 4:30. This provided a strong incentive to get the plant running. The production problems were soon ironed out, and volume deliveries began late that year. By this point, their workstation customers had already developed complete systems ready to use the 020 and the new floating point unit, the Motorola 68881. Systems were in the market only five or six months after the 020 had been announced.

===Replacement===
Design of the 020&#x27;s follow-on began almost immediately. As part of their ongoing work with Hitachi, Motorola&#x27;s fabrication system was finally catching up with the competition, as was their internal design workflow. This gave them considerably more room to work with, allowing the addition of larger processor caches, a built-in memory management unit (MMU) and other features. The Motorola 68030 was announced in September 1986, with deliveries to begin the next summer. Due to the changes in the production lines, the new 030 would have a lower launch price than the 020.

There were significant differences between the 68000 and 020, especially the 32-bit memory interface. This required computer designs using it to be considerably different from earlier models. In contrast, there were few changes between the 020 and 030, the latter of which could be used as a drop-in replacement in many roles. For this reason, designs using the 030 appeared much more quickly after its release than the 020. The first Macintosh with the 020 was the Macintosh II released in March 1987, two years after the 020 had become widely available, with low-volume initial shipments starting two months later. Only eighteen months later, the Macintosh IIx replaced it, using the 030. Although it ran at the same 16 MHz clock speed, the IIx offered 3.9 MIPS compared to the II&#x27;s 2.6.

== Description ==

The 68020 has 32-bit internal and external data and address buses, compared to the early 680x0 models with 16-bit data and 24-bit address buses. The 68020&#x27;s ALU is also natively 32-bit, so can perform 32-bit operations in one clock cycle, whereas the 68000 took a minimum of two clock cycles due to its 16-bit ALU. Newer packaging methods allowed the &#x27;020 to feature more external pins without the large size that the earlier dual in-line package method required. The 68EC020 lowered cost through a 24-bit address bus. The 68020 was produced at speeds ranging from 12 MHz to 33 MHz.


=== Improvements over the 68010 ===
The 68020 has a 32-bit arithmetic logic unit (ALU), 32-bit external data and address buses. It adds extra instructions and additional addressing modes. The 68020 (and 68030) has a proper three-stage pipeline. Though the 68010 had a &quot;loop mode&quot;, which sped loops through what was effectively a tiny instruction cache, it held only two short instructions and was thus little used. The 68020 replaced this with a proper instruction cache of 256 bytes, the first 68k series processor to feature true on-chip cache memory.
The previous 68000 and 68010 processors could only access word (16-bit) and long word (32-bit) data in memory if it were word-aligned (located at an even address). The 68020 has no alignment restrictions on data access. Naturally, unaligned accesses are slower than aligned accesses because they required an extra memory access.

The 68020 has a small 256-byte direct-mapped instruction cache, arranged as 64 four-byte entries. Although small, it still made a significant difference in the performance of many applications. The resulting decrease in bus traffic was particularly important in systems relying heavily on DMA.

=== Coprocessor support ===
The 68020 has a coprocessor interface supporting up to eight coprocessors. The main CPU recognizes &quot;F-line&quot; instructions (with the four most significant opcode bits all one), and uses special bus cycles to interact with a coprocessor to execute these instructions. Two types of coprocessors were defined: floating point units (MC68881 or MC68882 FPUs) and the paged memory management unit (MC68851 PMMU). Only one PMMU can be used with a CPU. In principle, multiple FPUs could be used with a CPU, but it was not commonly done. The coprocessor interface is asynchronous, so it is possible to run the coprocessors at a different clock rate than the CPU.

=== Multiprocessing features ===
Multiprocessing support is implemented externally by the use of an RMC pin to indicate an indivisible read-modify-write cycle in progress. All other processors have to hold off memory accesses until the cycle is complete. Software support for multiprocessing includes the TAS, CAS and CAS2 instructions.

In a multiprocessor system, coprocessors could not be shared between CPUs. To avoid problems with returns from coprocessor, bus error, and address error exceptions, it was generally necessary in a multiprocessor system for all CPUs to be the same model, and for all FPUs to be the same model as well.

=== Instruction set ===
The new instructions include some minor improvements and extensions to the supervisor state, several instructions for software management of a multiprocessing system (which were removed in the 68060), some support for high-level languages which did not get used much (and was removed from future 680x0 processors), bigger multiply (32×32→64 bits) and divide (64÷32→32 bits quotient and 32 bits remainder) instructions, and bit field manipulations.

The new addressing modes add scaled indexing and another level of indirection to many of the pre-existing modes.

== Architecture ==

With full 32-bit internal and external address buses, the address registers (A0 through A7) could utilize their full 32-bit width, and were capable of addressing the entire 4 GB address space.

The larger effective widths of the address registers presented some problem for earlier software that was not considered &quot;32-bit clean&quot;. Some programs used the high 8 bits (bits 24-31) of addresses to contain various flag bits, with the understanding that the earlier 680x0 CPUs would safely ignore these high bits. Such software had to be rewritten to adjust to the larger physical address space available to the 68020 and later CPUs.

== Usage ==
The 68020 was used in the Apple Macintosh II and Macintosh LC personal computers, Sun-3 workstations, Amiga 1200 (68EC020 variant), the Hewlett-Packard 8711 Series Network Analyzers, HP 9000/320, HP 9000/330, Apollo Computer&#x27;s DN3000 and DN4000 workstations, and the Alpha Microsystems AM-2000. The 68020 was an alternative upgrade to the Sinclair QL&#x27;s 68008 in the Super Gold Card interface by Miracle Systems.

The Amiga 2500 and A2500UX optionally shipped with the A2620 Accelerator using a 68020, 68881 FPU and 68851 MMU. The 2500UX shipped with Amiga Unix, requiring an &#x27;020 or &#x27;030 processor.

A number of digital oscilloscopes from the mid-80s to the late-90s used the 68020, including the LeCroy 9300 Series (higher end models including &quot;C&quot; suffix models used the more powerful 68EC030; the 9300 models with a 68020 processor can be upgraded to the 68EC030 with a change of the CPU board) and the earlier LeCroy 9400 series (all models excluding the 9400/9400A which used the 68000), along with certain Tektronix TDS Series models. The HP 54520, 54522, 54540 and 54542 also use the 68020, together with a 68882 FPU.

It is also the processor used on TGV trains to decode signalling information sent to the trains through the rails. It is used in the flight control and radar systems of the Eurofighter Typhoon combat aircraft.

The Nortel Networks DMS-100 telephone central office switch also used the 68020 as the first microprocessor of the SuperNode computing core.

== Variant ==
The 68EC020 is a lower cost version of the Motorola 68020. The main difference is that the 68EC020 only has a 24-bit address bus, rather than the 32-bit address bus of the full 68020, and thus is only able to address 16 MB of memory.

The Amiga 1200 computer and the Amiga CD32 game console use the cost-reduced 68EC020; the Namco System 22, Taito F3 and Konami GX arcade boards also used this processor. The Atari Jaguar II prototype featured this to replace the 68000 of the original Atari Jaguar console. 

It also found use in laser printers. Apple used it in the LaserWriter IIɴᴛx. Kodak used it in the Ektaplus 7016PS, and Dataproducts used it in the LZR 1260.

In 2014, Rochester Electronics re-established manufacturing capability for the 68020 microprocessor and it is still available today.

<text>The Muppets are an American ensemble cast of puppet characters known for an absurdist, slapstick, burlesque, and self-referential style of variety-sketch comedy. Created by Jim Henson in 1955, their media franchise encompasses films, television, music, and other media associated with the characters. Owned by the Jim Henson Company for nearly five decades, the Muppets were acquired by the Walt Disney Company in 2004.

The Muppets originated in the short-form television series &quot;Sam and Friends&quot;, which aired on WRC-TV and in syndication from 1955 to 1961. Following appearances on late-night talk shows and in advertising during the 1960s, the Muppets began appearing on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; (1969–present) during their formative years in the early-mid 1970s and attained celebrity status and international recognition through &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; (1976–1981), their flagship sketch comedy television series that received four Primetime Emmy Award wins and 21 nominations during its five-year run.

During the late 1970s and 1980s, the Muppets diversified into theatrical films, including &quot;The Muppet Movie&quot; (1979); &quot;The Great Muppet Caper&quot; (1981); and &quot;The Muppets Take Manhattan&quot; (1984). Additionally, new Muppet characters were created for &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot; (1983–1987). Disney began involvement with the Muppets in the late 1980s, during which Henson entered negotiations to sell The Jim Henson Company.

The Muppets continued their media presence on television with series such as &quot;The Jim Henson Hour&quot; (1989) and &quot;Muppets Tonight&quot; (1996–98), both of which were similar in format to &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, as well as the animated spin-off &quot;Muppet Babies&quot; (1984–91); three theatrical films: &quot;The Muppet Christmas Carol&quot; (1992), &quot;Muppet Treasure Island&quot; (1996) and &quot;Muppets from Space&quot; (1999), and the television film &quot;It&#x27;s a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie&quot; (2002).

Disney bought the Muppets and the &quot;Bear in the Big Blue House&quot; franchise from the Henson family in February 2004 and controls the characters though their flagship studio, though the deal excluded the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; and &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot; characters. Subsequent projects have included the television film &quot;The Muppets&#x27; Wizard of Oz&quot; (2005), two theatrical films: &quot;The Muppets&quot; (2011) and &quot;Muppets Most Wanted&quot; (2014), a primetime series (2015–2016), the Halloween special &quot;Muppets Haunted Mansion&quot; (2021), and most recently the streaming television series &quot;The Muppets Mayhem&quot; (2023).

Throughout seven decades, the Muppets have been regarded as a staple of the entertainment industry and popular culture in the United States and English-speaking areas around the world. They have been recognized by various cultural institutions and organizations, including the American Film Institute, the Hollywood Walk of Fame, the Library of Congress, and both Academies of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and Television Arts and Sciences.

==History==
===1950s–1960s: Beginnings===

The Muppets were created by puppeteer Jim Henson in the 1950s; Henson claimed that he coined the term &quot;Muppet&quot; as a portmanteau of the words &quot;marionette&quot; and &quot;puppet.&quot; Among Henson&#x27;s earliest creations was Kermit the Frog, who became his most recognizable character. Originally conceived for an adult audience, the Muppets were introduced in 1955 in &quot;Sam and Friends&quot;, a short-form television series produced for WRC-TV in Washington, D.C. Developed by Henson and his future wife, Jane Nebel, the series was the first form of puppet media not to incorporate a physical proscenium arch typical of such works, relying instead on the natural framing of the television set through which it was viewed.

During the 1960s, the characters—in particular, Kermit and Rowlf the Dog—appeared in skits on several late-night talk shows and on television commercials, including &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. Rowlf became the first Muppet character to appear regularly on network television when he began appearing with Jimmy Dean on &quot;The Jimmy Dean Show&quot;. In 1966, Joan Ganz Cooney and Lloyd Morrisett began developing a children&#x27;s educational television program and approached Henson to design a cast of Muppet characters during this stage. Produced by the Children&#x27;s Television Workshop, the program debuted as &quot;Sesame Street&quot; in 1969 on NET, and later PBS.

Henson and his creative team became closely involved with &quot;Sesame Street&quot; during the years that followed; Henson waived his performance fee in exchange for retaining ownership rights to the Muppet characters created for the program. &quot;Sesame Street&quot; garnered a positive response, and the Muppets&#x27; involvement in the series was said to be a vital component of its increasing popularity, providing an &quot;effective and pleasurable viewing&quot; method of presentation for its educational curriculum.

===1970s: &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; and foray into film===
In the early 1970s, the Muppets continued their presence in television, primarily appearing in &quot;The Land of Gorch&quot; segments during the first season of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. The Muppet characters featured in &quot;The Land of Gorch&quot; behaved boorishly and made frequent references to drug abuse, sexual activity, and consumption of alcohol; adult themes that Henson wanted to explore with the characters in an effort to not let him nor the Muppets be typecast as entertainment for children. The writers of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; clashed with Henson&#x27;s vision for the program, often refusing to commit to writing the segments, and several cast members bemoaned the inclusion of the Muppets. Eventually, the collaboration proved too divisive, and the Muppets departed &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; after the conclusion of the first season.

As his involvement with &quot;Sesame Street&quot; continued, Henson began developing a network television series featuring the Muppets; but distinct from &quot;Sesame Street&quot;; this series would be aimed at a more adult audience and would satirize sketch comedy. Two television pilots, &quot;The Muppets Valentine Show&quot; and &quot;The Muppet Show: Sex and Violence&quot;, aired on ABC in 1974 and 1975, respectively.

After ABC passed on the pilots and other networks in the United States expressed little interest in the project, British producer Lew Grade approached Henson and agreed to co-produce the series for Associated Television. Debuting in 1976, &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; introduced new characters such as Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, and Gonzo, alongside existing characters such as Kermit and Rowlf. Aired in first-run syndication in the United States, &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; became increasingly popular due to its sketch-variety format, unique form of vaudeville-style humor, and prolific roster of guest stars. It was nominated for twenty-one Primetime Emmy Awards during its run, winning four, including Outstanding Variety Series in 1978. The success of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; allowed Henson Associates to diversify into theatrical films, the first of which, &quot;The Muppet Movie&quot;, was released in 1979.

===1980s–1990s: Subsequent projects===
Following &quot;The Muppet Movie&quot; were &quot;The Great Muppet Caper&quot; and &quot;The Muppets Take Manhattan&quot;, released in 1981 and 1984, respectively. Collectively, the three films received four Academy Award nominations. &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; ended its five-season run in 1981. In 1983, Henson debuted &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot;, which aired on HBO in the United States until 1987.

In 1989, Henson entered negotiations with Michael Eisner and The Walt Disney Company, in which Disney would acquire Jim Henson Productions and, in turn, the Muppets. Disney expressed interest in purchasing the company for $150 million. Eisner was also interested in acquiring the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; Muppet characters, but Henson declined that proposal, considering it a &quot;non-starter&quot; for the deal. An &quot;agreement in principle&quot; for the acquisition was publicly announced by Disney and Henson at the Disney-MGM Studios theme park in Walt Disney World Resort on August 28, 1989, along with plans for Muppets-themed attractions to debut at that park and Disneyland the following year. In anticipation of the acquisition, the television special &quot;The Muppets at Walt Disney World&quot; premiered on May 6, 1990.

However, the proposed merger was cancelled after Henson&#x27;s death on May 16, 1990. Nevertheless, Disney initiated a licensing agreement with Jim Henson Productions to continue developing Muppets attractions and the use of the characters within the Disney theme parks. The following year, &quot;Muppet*Vision 3D&quot; debuted at Disney–MGM Studios, the only attraction successfully developed from the original plans. Walt Disney Pictures also co-produced the fourth and fifth Muppets films, &quot;The Muppet Christmas Carol&quot; (1992) and &quot;Muppet Treasure Island&quot; (1996), with Jim Henson Productions. The characters subsequently starred in &quot;Muppets Tonight&quot;, which aired on ABC from 1996 to 1998; and a sixth film, &quot;Muppets from Space&quot;, released by Columbia Pictures in 1999.

===2000s: Disney acquisition===
In 2000, The Jim Henson Company was sold to EM.TV &amp; Merchandising AG for $680 million. However, EM.TV&#x27;s stock collapsed and the Henson family re-acquired the company in 2003, with the exception of the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; characters, which were in the interim sold to Sesame Workshop.

Fourteen years after initial negotiations began, Disney acquired the Muppets intellectual property from the Henson company for $75 million on February 17, 2004. The acquisition consisted of a majority of the Muppet film and television library, as well as the &quot;Bear in the Big Blue House&quot; television series. Exceptions included the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; characters; the &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot; characters, which were retained by Henson; the distribution rights to four films: &quot;The Muppets Take Manhattan&quot;, &quot;Muppets from Space&quot;, and &quot;Kermit&#x27;s Swamp Years&quot;, which were retained by Sony Pictures Entertainment; and &quot;It&#x27;s a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie&quot;, retained by NBCUniversal Television Distribution. Following the acquisition, Disney formed The Muppets Studio (originally The Muppets Holding Company), a wholly owned subsidiary responsible for managing the characters and franchise. As a result, the term &quot;Muppet&quot; became a legal trademark of Disney; under license from Disney, Sesame Workshop continues to use the term for their characters, as well as archival footage of Kermit the Frog.

Henson retained the rights to several productions featuring the Disney-owned Muppet characters, including &quot;Emmet Otter&#x27;s Jug-Band Christmas&quot;; &quot;The Christmas Toy&quot;; &quot;Sesame Street: 20 and Still Counting&quot;; &quot;Henson&#x27;s Place&quot;; &quot;Billy Bunny&#x27;s Animal Songs&quot;; the original &quot;Dog City&quot; special; and &quot;Donna&#x27;s Day&quot;. While some of these have since been released uncut, most current releases of &quot;Emmet Otter&#x27;s Jug-Band Christmas&quot; and &quot;The Christmas Toy&quot; omit the appearances by Kermit the Frog. The 2015 ABC Family airing, the 2017 DVD and the 2018 Blu-ray releases of &quot;Emmet Otter&#x27;s Jug-Band Christmas&quot; and the Amazon Prime Video release of &quot;The Christmas Toy&quot; reinstate Kermit&#x27;s scenes.

After the acquisition was complete, Disney gradually began reintroducing the franchise to the mainstream, synergistically promoting the Muppets across different parts of the company. The Muppets made appearances on Disney Channel and starred in the ABC television film, &quot;The Muppets&#x27; Wizard of Oz&quot; (2005). A television special, &quot;A Muppets Christmas: Letters to Santa&quot;, premiered on NBC on December 17, 2008. As a method of regaining a wider audience, Disney produced a series of vignettes for YouTube and Disney.com. A cover version of Queen&#x27;s &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; was among these projects and immediately went viral, ultimately amassing 90 million views and winning two Webby Awards. In 2010, the Muppets starred in &quot;The Muppets Kitchen with Cat Cora&quot;, which co-starred Cat Cora and showcased cooking demonstrations. That same year, Disney used the Muppets to promote their volunteerism program at the company&#x27;s theme parks. A Halloween special featuring the Muppets was developed during that time and expected to air on ABC that October, but was canceled.

===2010s–present: Renewed success; current projects===
In 2011, the Muppets were featured in an eponymous seventh film &quot;The Muppets&quot;, intended to serve as a &quot;creative reboot&quot; for the characters. Walt Disney Pictures had been furthering development on a Muppets film since 2008, when it considered adapting an unused screenplay by Jerry Juhl. Directed by James Bobin, written by Jason Segel and Nicholas Stoller, and starring Segel, Amy Adams, Chris Cooper, and Rashida Jones, &quot;The Muppets&quot; was a critical and commercial success, becoming the highest-grossing puppet film of all time and winning the Academy Award for Best Original Song for Bret McKenzie&#x27;s &quot;Man or Muppet&quot;. During the film&#x27;s publicity campaign, the Muppets appeared in promotional advertisements and marketing efforts by Disney and were also featured in a promotional video for Google+. In March 2012, the Muppets received a collective star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. That year, the Muppets hosted a &quot;Just for Laughs&quot; comedy gala in Montreal.

Following the release of &quot;The Muppets&quot;, Disney announced an eighth film in 2012, with Bobin and Stoller returning to direct and write, respectively. &quot;Muppets Most Wanted&quot; was released in 2014 and starred Ricky Gervais, Tina Fey, and Ty Burrell. The film received positive reviews but was a commercial disappointment at the box office.

Disney Theatrical Productions announced in 2013 that a live show based on the Muppets was in active development and that a 15-minute show had been conducted by Thomas Schumacher to see how the technical components would work. &quot;Muppet Moments&quot;, an interstitial television series, premiered on Disney Jr. in April 2015. The short-form series features conversations between the Muppets and young children.

After the release of &quot;Muppets Most Wanted&quot;, Disney was interested in expanding the Muppets&#x27; presence across other media, particularly in television. Discussions for a new primetime series began internally within The Muppets Studio. By April 2015, Bill Prady was commissioned to write a script for a pilot with the working title &quot;Muppets 2015&quot;. In May 2015, ABC commissioned an eponymous series, co-developed by Prady and Bob Kushell and directed by Randall Einhorn. Developed as a parody of other mockumentary-style series such as &quot;The Office&quot;, &quot;Modern Family&quot;, and &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot;, &quot;The Muppets&quot; portrayed the everyday personal and professional lives of the Muppets in Los Angeles as they produced a late-night talk show hosted by Miss Piggy. The ABC series portrayed the characters in more adult situations than previous incarnations, including depictions of alcohol consumption, sexual innuendos, and mild profanity. The series premiered on September 22, 2015, in the United States, and received mixed reviews, with critics praising the show&#x27;s adult humor but criticizing the writing and characterization. &quot;The Muppets&quot; was canceled after one season, which concluded on March 1, 2016.

On September 24, 2016, The Muppets were featured in a benefit concert called &quot;Puppets for Puppetry,&quot; hosted by the Jim Henson Company for the Center for Puppetry Arts. This concert honored Puppeteer Dave Goelz and celebrated the 30th anniversary of &quot;Labyrinth&quot;. Musical guests Gerard Way and Ray Toro of My Chemical Romance, along with Jarrod Alexander, Matt Gorney, and Jamie Muhoberac performed a tribute to &quot;Labyrinth&quot; with a medley of songs including &quot;Underground&quot; and &quot;As the World Falls Down&quot;.

In September 2017, the Muppets performed a live concert series at the Hollywood Bowl, hosted by Bobby Moynihan. This performance was followed by a second event in July 2018 at London&#x27;s O2 Arena, their first outside of the United States.

In February 2018, Disney announced that a streaming television reboot series was in development for Disney+. The project, known as &quot;Muppets Live Another Day&quot;, was intended as a limited-run series set in the 1980s after the events of &quot;The Muppets Take Manhattan&quot; and depicted Kermit recruiting the Muppets to locate Rowlf the Dog after his disappearance. The series was intended to be directed by Jason Moore; written by Josh Gad, Adam Horowitz and Eddy Kitsis; produced by ABC Signature Studios and The Muppets Studio, and feature original music by Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez. After an executive change at The Muppets Studio that prompted a different creative direction for the Muppets, Disney canceled development on the project in September 2019. A second Disney+ series, &quot;Muppets Now&quot;, a short-form improvisational comedy series, was announced in August 2019 and was released on July 31, 2020. &quot;Muppets Haunted Mansion&quot;, a Halloween special based on the Disney attraction of the same name, was released on October 8, 2021.

A third Disney+ series &quot;The Muppets Mayhem&quot;, was ordered in March 2022. The series was developed and written by Adam F. Goldberg, Bill Barretta and Jeff Yorkes and starred Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem, alongside Lilly Singh and Tahj Mowry. The series received five Emmy Award nominations at the Children&#x27;s and Family Emmy Awards, winning one for Outstanding Children&#x27;s or Family Viewing Series.

==Characters==
The principal characters of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; and subsequent media include Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Gonzo, Rowlf the Dog, Scooter, Rizzo the Rat, Pepe the King Prawn, Dr. Bunsen Honeydew, Beaker, Statler and Waldorf, The Swedish Chef, Sam Eagle, Walter, and The Electric Mayhem, consisting of Dr. Teeth (vocals, keyboards), Animal (drums), Floyd Pepper (bass, vocals), Janice (guitar, vocals), Zoot (saxophone), and Lips (trumpet).

As well as &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, the characters are popular for their appearances on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; and &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot;; and also feature in &quot;Sam and Friends&quot;, &quot;The Jimmy Dean Show&quot;, &quot;The Jim Henson Hour&quot;, &quot;Muppets Tonight&quot;, &quot;Bear in the Big Blue House&quot;, &quot;Statler and Waldorf: From the Balcony&quot;, &quot;The Muppets&quot;, and &quot;The Muppets Mayhem&quot;. An adult-oriented segment, &quot;The Land of Gorch&quot;, was a regular feature in the first season of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. Guest stars on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; occasionally include both the Muppets and &quot;Sesame Street&quot; characters, as well as Muppet likenesses of real people; these likenesses appear recurrently in early episodes of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; and on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, and appear occasionally on other series such as &quot;30 Rock&quot;.

Following Disney&#x27;s acquisition of the Muppets, puppets created by The Jim Henson Company are no longer referred to as Muppets. Puppets created by Jim Henson&#x27;s Creature Shop, including those in &quot;Labyrinth&quot; and &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot;, have never been considered Muppets, as they are generally more complex in design and performance than regular Muppets. At Henson&#x27;s suggestion, the &quot;Star Wars&quot; character Yoda was originally performed by Frank Oz, and has been loosely described as a Muppet in media and reference works; he is not, however, and Henson otherwise had no involvement in the character&#x27;s conception.

==Design and performance==

From 1962 to 1978, Don Sahlin was the primary designer and builder of the Muppets and was described by Henson as “the man most responsible for the look of the Muppets.” Sahlin&#x27;s designs are often recognizable for their spheroid heads partially bisected to create large mouths; several characters designed by Sahlin include Rowlf the Dog, Bert and Ernie, Grover, and Cookie Monster.

The majority of the Muppets are designed as hand puppets, with several characters utilizing rods. Common design elements of the Muppets include flexible faces with wide mouths and large protruding eyes. Most of the Muppets are molded or carved out of various types of foam and covered with any felt-like material. The characters may represent humans; anthropomorphic characters; realistic animals; animate inanimate objects; robots; extraterrestrial or mythical creatures; or other forms of abstract characters.

The Muppets are distinguished from ventriloquist dummies, which are usually animated only in the head and face, in that their arms or other features are also animated. They are also generally made of softer material. They are presented as being independent of the puppeteer, officially known as a &quot;Muppet performer&quot;, who is usually hidden behind a set or outside of the camera frame. Using the camera frame to this advantage was an innovation of the Muppets. Prior to this, a stage was used to mask the performers, as would be the case in a live performance. Sometimes, they are seen full-bodied; in most cases, invisible strings are used to manipulate these puppets, with vocals added at a later point. Performers often use dollies to mimic walking.

Since 2006, Disney has contracted Puppet Heap to produce and maintain newer models of the Muppets. During most performances, the performer holds the character above their head or in front of their body, with one hand operating the head and mouth and the other manipulating the hands and arms, either with two separate control rods or – in the case of &quot;live-hand&quot; Muppets – wearing the hands similarly to gloves. One consequence of this design is that most of the Muppets are left-handed, with the performer using their right hand to operate the head while operating the arm with their left hand.

For more complex Muppets, several performers may operate a single character, with the performer controlling the mouth usually voicing the character. As technology has advanced, the Jim Henson team and other performers have developed several means to operate the Muppets for film and television; these include the use of suspended rigs, internal motors, remote manipulators, and computer enhanced and superimposed images. Creative use of different technologies has allowed for scenes in which the Muppets appear to exhibit complex movements wholly independently of the performer.

In his book, &quot;Street Gang&quot;, author Michael Davis wrote that the characters tend to develop &quot;organically&quot;, alluding to the performers taking up to a year to develop their characters and voices. They are also &quot;test-driven, passed around from one Henson troupe member to another in the hope of finding the perfect human-Muppet match&quot;. When interacting with them, children believed that Muppets were living beings, even when the performers were present.

===Cast performers===


At the start of the Muppets&#x27; formation, Jim and Jane Henson were the group&#x27;s only performers. In 1961, Jane retired to focus on raising their children. Seeking additional performers, Jim Henson came into contact with Frank Oz that year. Although interested, Oz initially declined due to his youth and commitment to high school, and instead suggested Jerry Juhl, who worked with Oz at the Vagabond Puppet Theater in Oakland, California. Upon graduating, Oz subsequently joined in August 1963, which then consisted of Henson, Juhl, and Muppet designer Don Sahlin. By the time &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; began, the primary cast of performers grew to consist of Henson; Oz; Dave Goelz; Jerry Nelson; Richard Hunt; and later, Steve Whitmire, while Juhl became head writer for the series. From &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; onward, Kevin Clash; Kathryn Mullen; Louise Gold; Karen Prell; Fran Brill, Caroll Spinney; and Brian Henson performed several minor characters and assisted the main performers with puppeteering. Many of these puppeteers performed characters across &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot;, and other Henson-related projects.

Jim Henson, Hunt, and Nelson continued performing until their deaths in 1990, 1992, and 2012, respectively. Goelz, Whitmire, and Bill Barretta, who joined the main cast of performers in the mid-1990s, assumed Henson&#x27;s characters, with Whitmire cast in the role of Beaker and Nelson cast in the role of Statler, both previously performed by Hunt. The remainder of Hunt&#x27;s characters were left without a stable performer until David Rudman was cast in those roles in the 2000s. Oz continued performing until his retirement from puppeteering in 2000; Eric Jacobson was cast as his characters beginning in 2002. At Nelson&#x27;s behest, Matt Vogel gradually began performing his characters in 2008. Peter Linz joined the main cast in 2011, debuting the role of Walter in &quot;The Muppets.&quot;

Whitmire was dismissed from the cast in 2016, with Vogel cast as Kermit the Frog in 2017, and most of Whitmire&#x27;s other characters were assumed by the remainder of the cast, primarily by Linz. The Muppets are currently performed by a core cast of six principal puppeteers: Goelz, Barretta, Jacobson, Vogel, Rudman, and Linz, with the occasional ensemble of &quot;additional&quot; Muppet performers that includes Julianne Buescher, Tyler Bunch, Alice Dinnean, Bruce Lanoil, Leslie Carrara-Rudolph, Drew Massey, Mike Quinn, and Michelan Sisti.

===Filmography and television===
===Discography===

On September 17, 2002, Rhino Records released &quot;The Muppet Show: Music, Mayhem, and More&quot;, a compilation album of music from &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; and subsequent film releases. With John Denver, &quot;John Denver and the Muppets: A Christmas Together&quot; was produced and released in 1979.

Under Disney ownership, The Muppets album releases have been released by Walt Disney Records; including new album releases and album reissues, such as &quot;The Muppet Christmas Carol&quot; in 2005 and &quot;The Muppet Movie&quot; in 2013. Legal music publishing rights to Muppet songs are administered by Fuzzy Muppet Songs and Mad Muppet Melodies, imprints of Disney Music Publishing.

===Theme parks===

Similar to other Disney characters, the Muppets appear at the Disney Experiences, having first appeared at Walt Disney World Resort in 1990. Their first featured attraction, &quot;Here Come the Muppets&quot;, was a live stage show that opened shortly after Jim Henson&#x27;s death and ran at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios (known at that time as Disney-MGM Studios) for a year. &quot;Muppet*Vision 3D&quot;, a 4D film attraction that also uses Audio-Animatronics characters, opened at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios on May 16, 1991, exactly one year after Henson&#x27;s death. It is Henson&#x27;s final directorial effort. &quot;Muppet*Vision 3D&quot; subsequently opened at Disney California Adventure, on February 8, 2001; this version closed in 2014. The version of &quot;Muppet*Vision 3D&quot; at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios is scheduled to close on June 8, 2025.

The Muppets also were featured in &quot;The Muppets Present...Great Moments in American History&quot; at the Magic Kingdom from 2016 to 2020; and the Muppet Mobile Lab at Epcot since 2007. The latter attraction is a free-roving vehicle with Audio-Animatronics of Bunsen Honeydew and Beaker. As part of Disney&#x27;s Living Character Initiative, it premiered at Disney California Adventure and later made appearances at Epcot and Hong Kong Disneyland.

In 2010, the Muppets were the face of the &quot;Give a Day, Get a Disney Day&quot; charity campaign. Kermit, Miss Piggy, and Sweetums appeared in daily parades at Disneyland and Magic Kingdom. The Muppets appeared in television and print ads for the campaign and were featured prominently on the campaign&#x27;s web site.

Disney has released numerous collector pins featuring the Muppets since 2004. These include Limited Edition pins, Hidden Mickey pin collections, mystery pin sets, 2008 pin sets promoting &quot;The Muppets&quot;, cast lanyard pins, and assorted individual rack pins. Over 100 pins displaying the characters have been released overall.

In November 2024, it was announced that the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith attraction at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios will be re-themed to the Muppets.

===Publishing===

Among other print media, the Muppets have featured in comics since the 1970s. An eponymous comic strip by Guy and Brad Gilchrist first ran on September 21, 1981, in over 500 daily newspapers, six months after &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; ended its five-year run. By the end of its run in 1986, the comic strip was seen in over 660 newspapers worldwide. Many of the strips were compiled in various book collections. Special strips were also created in color, exclusively for issues of &quot;Muppet Magazine&quot;.

&quot;Muppet Magazine&quot; was published from 1983 to 1989. The magazine was presented as being run by the Muppets themselves and included such features as celebrity interviews and comic stories.

The only Muppets film adapted as a comic book was &quot;The Muppets Take Manhattan&quot;. The comic book series was adapted by Marvel Comics in 1984, as the 68-page story in &quot;Marvel Super Special&quot; issue #32. The adaptation was later re-printed into three limited series issues, released under Marvel&#x27;s Star Comics imprint (November 1984 – January 1985).

In the wake of &quot;Muppet Babies&quot;″ success, Star Comics adapted the series into a bi-monthly title, of which 26 issues were produced.

The final issue of &quot;Disney Adventures&quot;, released in 2007, included a one-page strip by Roger Langridge. In 2009, Boom! Studios began publishing a series of comic books based on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, written and illustrated by Langridge. After two mini-series, an ongoing series, &quot;The Muppet Show Comic Book&quot;, was published for eleven issues. Additionally, Boom! Studios published fairy tale adaptations centered on the Muppets. In 2012, the Langridge series was transferred to Marvel Comics, which released an omnibus edition in 2013.

===Video games===
The first video game in the franchise was &quot;Kermit&#x27;s Electronic Storymaker&quot;, which was released in 1984 for the Commodore 64. In 1989, &quot;Muppet Adventure: Chaos at the Carnival&quot;, was released by Hi Tech Expressions for the Apple II, Commodore 64, and MS-DOS, the following year it was ported by the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in 1990. In 1996, Activision and in association with Jim Henson Interactive released the CD-ROM game, &quot;Muppet Treasure Island&quot; (on which the film of the same name was based) for Windows 95. Later in 1996, Starwave released &quot;The Muppet CD-ROM: Muppets Inside&quot;, the second CD-ROM game was advertised for a January release, and available in stores beginning in March. In April 2000, Take-Two Interactive released the platform game under the title &quot;Jim Henson&#x27;s Muppets&quot; for the Game Boy Color. In October 2000, Midway Games released the two &quot;Muppet&quot; video games, &quot;Muppet RaceMania&quot; and &quot;Muppet Monster Adventure&quot; for the PlayStation console. On April 18, 2002, TDK Mediactive acquired the rights to &quot;The Muppets&quot; games, and released two video games, &quot;The Muppets: On with the Show!&quot; (2002) and &quot;Spy Muppets: License to Croak&quot; (2003) for the Game Boy Advance and &quot;Muppets Party Cruise&quot; (2003) for the PlayStation 2 and GameCube consoles. In 2014, Virtual Toys released &quot;The Muppets Movie Adventures&quot; for PS Vita. The mobile game &quot;Disney Magic Kingdoms&quot;, developed by Gameloft, includes characters and attractions based on &quot;The Muppets&quot; franchise during limited time contents.

==In popular culture==

The Muppets&#x27; prevalence in popular culture is such that the characters have become regarded as celebrities in their own right. The Muppets have a collective star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, with Kermit having been previously individually inducted in 2002. The characters have appeared at the Academy Awards and Emmy Awards; made cameo appearances in films including &quot;Rocky III&quot;, &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot;, and &quot;Mr. Magorium&#x27;s Wonder Emporium&quot;; and have been interviewed on the news magazine &quot;60 Minutes&quot;.

Kermit was interviewed by Jon Stewart on &quot;The Daily Show&quot;; was a guest host on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, &quot;Extreme Makeover: Home Edition&quot;, &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot;, and an April Fools&#x27; Day edition of &quot;Larry King Live&quot;; and has served as Grand Marshal of the Tournament of Roses Parade. The characters also appeared on &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; and &quot;The Torkelsons&quot;, among other sitcoms. The music video for Weezer&#x27;s &quot;Keep Fishin&#x27;&quot; is aesthetically based on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; and consists of the band interacting with the characters.

On September 28, 2005, the United States Postal Service released a &quot;Jim Henson and the Muppets&quot; postage stamp series. The Muppets also appeared on &quot;Dick Clark&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Rockin&#x27; Eve&quot; on December 31, 2007, in which Kermit and other characters presented segments following advertising breaks. After one such segment, with Kermit in Times Square, co-host Ryan Seacrest thanked &quot;Kerms&quot; for his assistance. Miss Piggy has appeared as a guest on &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson&quot;, and Kermit appeared on &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; and as one of the celebrity commentators on VH1&#x27;s &quot;I Love&quot; documentary series. The Muppets, as well as the title character of &quot;Bear in the Big Blue House&quot;, have made frequent appearances on &quot;The Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon&quot;.

On July 25, 2007, the Center for Puppetry Arts in Atlanta announced plans for the Jim Henson Wing, which would house up to 700 retired Muppet characters. The wing, featuring films, sketches, and other materials from the Jim Henson Company archives, was set to open in 2012 but eventually opened as a gallery within the &quot;Worlds of Puppetry&quot; exhibition at the Center in November 2015.

Muppet-like characters star in the Broadway musical &quot;Avenue Q&quot;, the concept of which is a parody of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. The Peter Jackson film &quot;Meet the Feebles&quot;, a satire on the television industry, is largely reminiscent of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;. A Kermit the Frog stuffed toy rigged to spray fake vomit was a recurring joke on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;, and the Muppets were frequently preempted at the beginning of episodes of &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That on Television.&quot; The sitcom series &quot;Greg the Bunny&quot; centered on sentient hand puppets working on a Muppet-like children&#x27;s show. Among other examples, television series such as &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;The West Wing&quot;, and &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; have referenced the Muppets.

The term &quot;&quot; is commonly used in Ireland, Britain, and Australasia to refer to a stupid or ineffectual person.

<text>In chemistry, the [[Mole (unit)|mole]] fraction or molar fraction, also called mole proportion or molar proportion, is a quantity defined as the ratio between the amount of a constituent substance, &quot;ni&quot; (expressed in unit of moles, symbol mol), and the total amount of all constituents in a mixture, &quot;n&quot;tot (also expressed in moles):
:formula_1
It is denoted xi (lowercase Roman letter &quot;x&quot;), sometimes  (lowercase Greek letter chi). (For mixtures of gases, the letter &quot;y&quot; is recommended.)

It is a dimensionless quantity with dimension of formula_2 and dimensionless unit of moles per mole (mol/mol or molmol−1) or simply 1; metric prefixes may also be used (e.g., nmol/mol for 10−9).
When expressed in percent, it is known as the mole percent or molar percentage (unit symbol %, sometimes &quot;mol%&quot;, equivalent to cmol/mol for 10−2).
The mole fraction is called amount fraction by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) and amount-of-substance fraction by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). This nomenclature is part of the International System of Quantities (ISQ), as standardized in ISO 80000-9, which deprecates &quot;mole fraction&quot; based on the unacceptability of mixing information with units when expressing the values of quantities.

The sum of all the mole fractions in a mixture is equal to 1:
:formula_3
Mole fraction is numerically identical to the number fraction, which is defined as the number of particles (molecules) of a constituent &quot;Ni&quot; divided by the total number of all molecules &quot;N&quot;tot. 
Whereas mole fraction is a ratio of amounts to amounts (in units of moles per moles), molar concentration is a quotient of amount to volume (in units of moles per litre).
Other ways of expressing the composition of a mixture as a dimensionless quantity are mass fraction and volume fraction.

==Properties==
Mole fraction is used very frequently in the construction of phase diagrams. It has a number of advantages:
* it is not temperature dependent (as is molar concentration) and does not require knowledge of the densities of the phase(s) involved
* a mixture of known mole fraction can be prepared by weighing off the appropriate masses of the constituents
* the measure is &quot;symmetric&quot;: in the mole fractions &quot;x&quot; = 0.1 and &quot;x&quot; = 0.9, the roles of &#x27;solvent&#x27; and &#x27;solute&#x27; are reversed.
* In a mixture of ideal gases, the mole fraction can be expressed as the ratio of partial pressure to total pressure of the mixture
* In a ternary mixture one can express mole fractions of a component as functions of other components mole fraction and binary mole ratios:
*: formula_4

Differential quotients can be formed at constant ratios like those above:
: formula_5

or 
: formula_6

The ratios &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, and &quot;Z&quot; of mole fractions can be written for ternary and multicomponent systems:
: formula_7

These can be used for solving PDEs like:
: formula_8

or 
: formula_9

This equality can be rearranged to have differential quotient of mole amounts or fractions on one side.
: formula_10

or 
: formula_11

Mole amounts can be eliminated by forming ratios:
: formula_12

Thus the ratio of chemical potentials becomes:
: formula_13

Similarly the ratio for the multicomponents system becomes
: formula_14

==Related quantities==
===Mass fraction===
The mass fraction &quot;wi&quot; can be calculated using the formula
:formula_15

where &quot;Mi&quot; is the molar mass of the component &quot;i&quot; and &quot;M̄&quot; is the average molar mass of the mixture.

=== Molar mixing ratio ===
The mixing of two pure components can be expressed introducing the amount or molar mixing ratio of them formula_16. Then the mole fractions of the components will be:
:formula_17

The amount ratio equals the ratio of mole fractions of components:

:formula_18

due to division of both numerator and denominator by the sum of molar amounts of components. This property has consequences for representations of phase diagrams using, for instance, ternary plots.

====Mixing binary mixtures with a common component to form ternary mixtures====
Mixing binary mixtures with a common component gives a ternary mixture with certain mixing ratios between the three components. These mixing ratios from the ternary and the corresponding mole fractions of the ternary mixture x1(123), x2(123), x3(123) can be expressed as a function of several mixing ratios involved, the mixing ratios between the components of the binary mixtures and the mixing ratio of the binary mixtures to form the ternary one.
:formula_19

===Mole percentage===
Multiplying mole fraction by 100 gives the mole percentage, also referred as amount/amount percent [abbreviated as (n/n)% or mol %].

===Mass concentration===
The conversion to and from mass concentration &quot;ρi&quot; is given by:
:formula_20

where &quot;M̄&quot; is the average molar mass of the mixture.

===Molar concentration===
The conversion to molar concentration &quot;ci&quot; is given by:
:formula_21

where &quot;M̄&quot; is the average molar mass of the solution, &quot;c&quot; is the total molar concentration and &quot;ρ&quot; is the density of the solution.

===Mass and molar mass===
The mole fraction can be calculated from the masses &quot;mi&quot; and molar masses &quot;Mi&quot; of the components:
:formula_22

==Spatial variation and gradient==
In a spatially non-uniform mixture, the mole fraction gradient triggers the phenomenon of diffusion.

<text>Mary Stevenson Cassatt (; May 22, 1844June 14, 1926) was an American painter and printmaker. She was born in Allegheny, Pennsylvania (now part of Pittsburgh&#x27;s North Side), and lived much of her adult life in France, where she befriended Edgar Degas and exhibited with the Impressionists. Cassatt often created images of the social and private lives of women, with particular emphasis on the intimate bonds between mothers and children.

She was described by Gustave Geffroy as one of &quot;les trois grandes dames&quot; (the three great ladies) of Impressionism alongside Marie Bracquemond and Berthe Morisot. In 1879, Diego Martelli compared her to Degas, as they both sought to depict movement, light, and design in the most modern sense.

==Early life==
Cassatt was born in Allegheny City, Pennsylvania, which is now part of Pittsburgh. She was born into an upper-middle-class family: Her father, Robert Simpson Cassat (later Cassatt), was a successful stockbroker and land speculator. The ancestral name had been Cossart, with the family descended from French Huguenot Jacques Cossart, who came to New Amsterdam in 1662. Her mother, Katherine Kelso Johnston, came from a banking family. Katherine Cassatt, educated and well-read, had a profound influence on her daughter. To that effect, Cassatt&#x27;s lifelong friend Louisine Havemeyer wrote in her memoirs: &quot;Anyone who had the privilege of knowing Mary Cassatt&#x27;s mother would know at once that it was from her and her alone that [Mary] inherited her ability.&quot; A distant cousin of artist Robert Henri, Cassatt was one of seven children, of whom two died in infancy. One brother, Alexander Johnston Cassatt, later became president of the Pennsylvania Railroad. The family moved eastward, first moving to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, then to the Philadelphia area, where she started her schooling at the age of six.

Cassatt grew up in an environment that viewed travel as an integral part of a well-rounded education; she spent five years in Europe and visited many of the capitals, including London, Paris, and Berlin. While abroad she learned German and French and had her first lessons in drawing and music. It is likely that her first exposure to French artists Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, Eugène Delacroix, Camille Corot, and Gustave Courbet was at the Paris World&#x27;s Fair of 1855. Also in the exhibition were Edgar Degas and Camille Pissarro, both of whom were later her colleagues and mentors.

Though her family objected to her becoming a professional artist, Cassatt began studying painting at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia at the early age of 15. Part of her parents&#x27; concern may have been Cassatt&#x27;s exposure to feminist ideas and the bohemian behavior of some of the male students. As such, Cassatt and her network of friends were lifelong advocates of equal rights for the sexes. Although about 20% of the students were female, most viewed art as a socially valuable skill; few of them were determined, as Cassatt was, to make art their career. She continued her studies from 1861 through 1865, the duration of the American Civil War. Thomas Eakins was among her fellow students; later Eakins was forced to resign as director of the academy.

Impatient with the slow pace of instruction and the patronizing attitude of the male students and teachers, she decided to study the old masters on her own. She later said: &quot;There was no teaching&quot; at the academy. Female students could not use live models, until somewhat later, and the principal training was primarily drawing from casts.

Cassatt decided to end her studies: At that time, no degree was granted. After overcoming her father&#x27;s objections, she moved to Paris in 1866, with her mother and family friends acting as chaperones. Since women could not yet attend the École des Beaux-Arts, Cassatt applied to study privately with masters from the school and was accepted to study with Jean-Léon Gérôme, a highly regarded teacher known for his hyper-realistic technique and his depiction of exotic subjects. (A few months later Gérôme also accepted Eakins as a student.) Cassatt augmented her artistic training with daily copying in the Louvre, obtaining the required permit, which was necessary to control the &quot;copyists&quot;, usually low-paid women, who daily filled the museum to paint copies for sale. The museum also served as a social place for Frenchmen and American female students, who, like Cassatt, were not allowed to attend cafes where the avant-garde socialized. In this manner, fellow artist and friend Elizabeth Jane Gardner met and married famed academic painter William-Adolphe Bouguereau.

Toward the end of 1866, she joined a painting class taught by Charles Joshua Chaplin, a genre artist. In 1868, Cassatt also studied with artist Thomas Couture, whose subjects were mostly romantic and urban. On trips to the countryside, the students drew from life, particularly the peasants going about their daily activities. In 1868, one of her paintings, &quot;A Mandoline Player&quot;, was accepted for the first time by the selection jury for the Paris Salon. With Elizabeth Jane Gardner, whose work was also accepted by the jury that year, Cassatt was one of two American women to first exhibit in the Salon. &quot;A Mandoline Player&quot; is in the Romantic style of Corot and Couture, and is one of only two paintings from the first decade of her career that is documented today.

The French art scene was in a process of change, as radical artists such as Courbet and Édouard Manet tried to break away from accepted Academic tradition, and the Impressionists were in their formative years. Cassatt&#x27;s friend Eliza Haldeman wrote home that artists &quot;are leaving the Academy style and each seeking a new way, consequently just now everything is Chaos.&quot; Cassatt, on the other hand, continued to work in the traditional manner, submitting works to the Salon for over ten years, with increasing frustration.

Returning to the United States in the late summer of 1870—as the Franco-Prussian War was starting—Cassatt lived with her family in Altoona. Her father continued to resist her chosen vocation, and paid for her basic needs, but not her art supplies. Cassatt placed two of her paintings in a New York gallery and found many admirers but no purchasers. She was also dismayed at the lack of paintings to study while staying at her summer residence. Cassatt even considered giving up art, as she was determined to make an independent living. She wrote in a letter of July 1871, &quot;I have given up my studio &amp; torn up my father&#x27;s portrait, &amp; have not touched a brush for six weeks nor ever will again until I see some prospect of getting back to Europe. I am very anxious to go out west next fall &amp; get some employment, but I have not yet decided where.&quot;

Cassatt traveled to Chicago to try her luck, but lost some of her early paintings in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. Shortly afterward, her work attracted the attention of Roman Catholic Bishop Michael Domenec of Pittsburgh, who commissioned her to paint two copies of paintings by Correggio in Parma, Italy, advancing her enough money to cover her travel expenses and part of her stay. In her excitement she wrote, &quot;O how wild I am to get to work, my fingers farely itch &amp; my eyes water to see a fine picture again&quot;. With Emily Sartain, a fellow artist from a well-regarded artistic family from Philadelphia, Cassatt set out for Europe again.

==Impressionism==
Within months of her return to Europe in the autumn of 1871, Cassatt&#x27;s prospects had brightened. Her painting &quot;Two Women Throwing Flowers During Carnival&quot; was well received in the Salon of 1872, and was purchased. She attracted much favorable notice in Parma and was supported and encouraged by the art community there: &quot;All Parma is talking of Miss Cassatt and her picture, and everyone is anxious to know her&quot;.

After completing her commission for the bishop, Cassatt traveled to Madrid and Seville, where she painted a group of paintings of Spanish subjects, including &quot;Spanish Dancer Wearing a Lace Mantilla&quot; (1873, in the National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institution). In 1874, she made the decision to take up residence in France. She was joined by her sister Lydia who shared an apartment with her. Cassatt opened a studio in Paris. Louisa May Alcott&#x27;s sister, Abigail May Alcott, was then an art student in Paris and visited Cassatt. Cassatt continued to express criticism of the politics of the Salon and the conventional taste that prevailed there. She was blunt in her comments, as reported by Sartain, who wrote: &quot;she is entirely too slashing, snubs all modern art, disdains the Salon pictures of Cabanel, Bonnat, all the names we are used to revere&quot;.

Cassatt saw that works by female artists were often dismissed with contempt unless the artist had a friend or protector on the jury, and she would not flirt with jurors to curry favor. Her cynicism grew when one of the two pictures she submitted in 1875 was refused by the jury, only to be accepted the following year after she darkened the background. She had quarrels with Sartain, who thought Cassatt too outspoken and self-centered, and eventually they parted. Out of her distress and self-criticism, Cassatt decided that she needed to move away from genre paintings and onto more fashionable subjects, in order to attract portrait commissions from American socialites abroad, but that attempt bore little fruit at first.

In 1877, both her entries were rejected, and for the first time in seven years she had no works in the Salon. At this low point in her career she was invited by Edgar Degas to show her works with the Impressionists, a group that had begun their own series of independent exhibitions in 1874 with much attendant notoriety. The Impressionists (also known as the &quot;Independents&quot; or &quot;Intransigents&quot;) had no formal manifesto and varied considerably in subject matter and technique. They tended to prefer plein air painting and the application of vibrant color in separate strokes with little pre-mixing, which allows the eye to merge the results in an &quot;impressionistic&quot; manner. The Impressionists had been receiving the wrath of the critics for several years. Henry Bacon, a friend of the Cassatts, thought that the Impressionists were so radical that they were &quot;afflicted with some hitherto unknown disease of the eye&quot;. They already had one female member, artist Berthe Morisot, who became Cassatt&#x27;s friend and colleague. The only American officially associated with the Impressionists, Cassatt would go on to exhibit in half of the group&#x27;s later exhibitions

Cassatt admired Degas, whose pastels had made a powerful impression on her when she encountered them in an art dealer&#x27;s window in 1875. &quot;I used to go and flatten my nose against that window and absorb all I could of his art,&quot; she later recalled. &quot;It changed my life. I saw art then as I wanted to see it.&quot; She accepted Degas&#x27; invitation with enthusiasm and began preparing paintings for the next Impressionist show, planned for 1878, which (after a postponement because of the World&#x27;s Fair) took place on April 10, 1879. She felt comfortable with the Impressionists and joined their cause enthusiastically, declaring: &quot;we are carrying on a despairing fight &amp; need all our forces&quot;. Unable to attend cafes with them without attracting unfavorable attention, she met with them privately and at exhibitions. She now hoped for commercial success selling paintings to the sophisticated Parisians who preferred the avant-garde. Her style had gained a new spontaneity during the intervening two years. Previously a studio-bound artist, she had adopted the practice of carrying a sketchbook with her while out-of-doors or at the theater, and recording the scenes she saw.
In 1877, Cassatt was joined in Paris by her father and mother, who returned with her sister Lydia, all eventually to share a large apartment on the fifth floor of 13, Avenue Trudaine, (). Mary valued their companionship, as neither she nor Lydia had married. A case was made that Mary had narcissistic disturbance, never completing the recognition of herself as a person outside of the orbit of her mother. Mary had decided early in life that marriage would be incompatible with her career. Lydia, who was frequently painted by her sister, had recurrent bouts of illness, and her death in 1882 left Cassatt temporarily unable to work.

Cassatt&#x27;s father insisted that her studio and supplies be covered by her sales, which were still meager. Afraid of having to paint &quot;potboilers&quot; to make ends meet, Cassatt applied herself to produce some quality paintings for the next Impressionist exhibition. Three of her most accomplished works from 1878 were &quot;Portrait of the Artist&quot; (self-portrait), &quot;Little Girl in a Blue Armchair&quot;, and &quot;Reading Le Figaro&quot; (portrait of her mother).

Degas had considerable influence on Cassatt. Both were highly experimental in their use of materials, trying distemper and metallic paints in many works, such as &quot;Woman Standing Holding a Fan&quot;, 1878–79 (Amon Carter Museum of American Art).

She became extremely proficient in the use of pastels, eventually creating many of her most important works in this medium. Degas also introduced her to etching, of which he was a recognized master. The two worked side by side for a while, and her draftsmanship gained considerable strength under his tutelage. One example of her thoughtful approach to the medium of drypoint as a mode for reflecting on her status as an artist is &#x27;Reflection&#x27; of 1889–90, which has recently been interpreted as a self-portrait. Degas in turn depicted Cassatt in a series of etchings recording their trips to the Louvre. She treasured his friendship but learned not to expect too much from his fickle and temperamental nature after a project they were collaborating on at the time, a proposed journal devoted to prints, was abruptly dropped by him. The sophisticated and well-dressed Degas, then forty-five, was a welcome dinner guest at the Cassatt residence, and likewise they at his &quot;soirées&quot;.

The Impressionist exhibit of 1879 was the most successful to date, despite the absence of Renoir, Sisley, Manet and Cézanne, who were attempting once again to gain recognition at the Salon. Through the efforts of Gustave Caillebotte, who organized and underwrote the show, the group made a profit and sold many works, although the criticism continued as harsh as ever. The &quot;Revue des Deux Mondes&quot; wrote, &quot;M. Degas and Mlle. Cassatt are, nevertheless, the only artists who distinguish themselves... and who offer some attraction and some excuse in the pretentious show of window dressing and infantile daubing&quot;.

Cassatt displayed eleven works, including &quot;Lydia in a Loge, Wearing a Pearl Necklace, (Woman in a Loge)&quot;. Although critics claimed that Cassatt&#x27;s colors were too bright and that her portraits were too accurate to be flattering to the subjects, her work was not savaged as was Monet&#x27;s, whose circumstances were the most desperate of all the Impressionists at that time. She used her share of the profits to purchase a work by Degas and one by Monet. She participated in the Impressionist Exhibitions that followed in 1880 and 1881, and she remained an active member of the Impressionist circle until 1886. In 1886, Cassatt provided two paintings for the first Impressionist exhibition in the US, organized by art dealer Paul Durand-Ruel. Her friend Louisine Elder married Harry Havemeyer in 1883, and with Cassatt as advisor, the couple began collecting the Impressionists on a grand scale. Much of their vast collection is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.

Cassatt also made several portraits of family members during that period, of which &quot;Portrait of Alexander Cassatt and His Son Robert Kelso&quot; (1885) is one of her best regarded. Cassatt&#x27;s style then evolved, and she moved away from Impressionism to a simpler, more straightforward approach. She began to exhibit her works in New York galleries as well. After 1886, Cassatt no longer identified herself with any art movement and experimented with a variety of techniques.

==Feminist viewpoints and the &quot;New Woman&quot;==
Cassatt and her contemporaries enjoyed the wave of feminism that occurred in the 1840s, allowing them access to educational institutions at newly coed colleges and universities, such as Oberlin and the University of Michigan. Likewise, women&#x27;s colleges such as Vassar, Smith and Wellesley opened their doors during this time. Cassatt was an outspoken advocate for women&#x27;s equality, campaigning with her friends for equal travel scholarships for students in the 1860s, and the right to vote in the 1910s.

Mary Cassatt depicted the &quot;New Woman&quot; of the 19th century from the woman&#x27;s perspective. As a successful, highly trained woman artist who never married, Cassatt—like Ellen Day Hale, Elizabeth Coffin, Elizabeth Nourse and Cecilia Beaux—personified the &quot;New Woman&quot;. She &quot;initiated the profound beginnings in recreating the image of the &#x27;new&#x27; woman&quot;, drawn from the influence of her intelligent and active mother, Katherine Cassatt, who believed in educating women to be knowledgeable and socially active. She is depicted in &quot;Reading &#x27;Le Figaro&#x27; &quot;(1878).

Cassatt&#x27;s independence and choice to not marry as a &quot;New Woman&quot; could also be seen as a reaction to the strict institutionalized misogamy of the art world at the time, in which a woman artist&#x27;s marriage could have been seen as incompatible with any serious artistic career.

Although Cassatt did not explicitly make political statements about women&#x27;s rights in her work, her artistic portrayal of women was consistently done with dignity and the suggestion of a deeper, meaningful inner life. Many of her works depict a mother caring for a child and she painted them with warmth and attention. Unlike the other Impressionists of the time who often painted street scenes and landscapes, Cassatt preferred to depict the everyday life of women and the domestic labors associated with the home. This was unusual at the time because, while Impressionist pieces typically depicted women as passive objects for the viewer, Cassatt notably made the women she painted active observers with real engagement in their environments. Cassatt&#x27;s work was shaped by her time spent engaging with these women in their private intimate spaces, something that a male artist would not have had the social ability to do at that time. This disconnect from what the two different genders were allowed to observe as an artist did not go unnoticed by Cassatt and she notably enjoyed observing the complexities of gender relations in her work. The piece &quot;&quot;In the Loge&quot;(1878)&quot; is a good example of this, as it depicts a young woman watching the opera while a male admirer gawks at her from afar. The viewer is then also included into the voyeuristic objectification of the unaware model exposing the social dynamics of the time.

By choosing to depict more humble feminine environments Cassatt effectively raised scenes of women, their labor, friendships, and personal life to be celebrated as high art. She was often critiqued for this preference and her art dismissed as too feminine. Cassatt objected to being stereotyped as a &quot;woman artist&quot;, she supported women&#x27;s suffrage, and in 1915 showed eighteen works in an exhibition supporting the movement organised by Louisine Havemeyer, a committed and active feminist. The exhibition brought her into conflict with her sister-in-law Eugenie Carter Cassatt, who was anti-suffrage and who boycotted the show along with Philadelphia society in general. Cassatt responded by selling off her work that was otherwise destined for her heirs. In particular &quot;The Boating Party&quot;, thought to have been inspired by the birth of Eugenie&#x27;s daughter Ellen Mary, was bought by the National Gallery, Washington, D.C.

== Relationship with Degas ==
Cassatt and Degas had a long period of collaboration. The two painters had studios close together, Cassatt at 19, rue Laval (), Degas at 4, rue Frochot (), less than a five-minute stroll apart, and Degas developed the habit of looking in at Cassatt&#x27;s studio and offering her advice and helping her gain models.

They had much in common: they shared similar tastes in art and literature, came from affluent backgrounds, had studied painting in Italy, and both were independent, never marrying. The degree of intimacy between them cannot be assessed now, as no letters survive, but it is unlikely they were in a relationship given their conservative social backgrounds and strong moral principles. Several of Vincent van Gogh&#x27;s letters attest to Degas&#x27; sexual self-constraint. Degas introduced Cassatt to pastel and engraving, both of which Cassatt quickly mastered, while for her part Cassatt was instrumental in helping Degas sell his paintings and promoting his reputation in America.

Both regarded themselves as figure painters, and the art historian George Shackelford suggests they were influenced by the art critic Louis Edmond Duranty&#x27;s appeal in his pamphlet &quot;The New Painting&quot; for a revitalization in figure painting: &quot;Let us take leave of the stylized human body, which is treated like a vase. What we need is the characteristic modern person in his clothes, in the midst of his social surroundings, at home or out in the street.&quot;


After Cassatt&#x27;s parents and sister Lydia joined Cassatt in Paris in 1877, Degas, Cassatt, and Lydia were often to be seen at the Louvre studying artworks together. Degas produced two prints, notable for their technical innovation, depicting Cassatt at the Louvre looking at artworks while Lydia reads a guidebook. These were destined for a prints journal planned by Degas (together with Camille Pissarro and others), which never came to fruition. Cassatt frequently posed for Degas, notably for his millinery series trying on hats.

Around 1884, Degas made a portrait in oils of Cassatt, &quot;Mary Cassatt Seated, Holding Cards&quot;. A &quot;Self-Portrait&quot; () by Cassatt depicts her in the identical hat and dress, leading art historian Griselda Pollock to speculate they were executed in a joint painting session in the early years of their acquaintance.

Cassatt and Degas worked most closely together in the fall and winter of 1879–80 when Cassatt was mastering her printmaking technique. Degas owned a small printing press, and by day she worked at his studio using his tools and press while in the evening she made studies for the etching plate the next day. However, in April 1880, Degas abruptly withdrew from the prints journal they had been collaborating on, and without his support the project folded. Degas&#x27; withdrawal piqued Cassatt who had worked hard at preparing a print, &quot;In the Opera Box&quot;, in a large edition of fifty impressions, no doubt destined for the journal. Although Cassatt&#x27;s warm feelings for Degas were to last her entire life, she never again worked with him as closely as she had over the prints journal. Mathews notes that she ceased executing her theater scenes at this time.

Degas was forthright in his views, as was Cassatt. They clashed over the Dreyfus affair (early in her career she had executed a portrait of the art collector Moyse Dreyfus, a relative of the court-martialled lieutenant at the center of the affair). Cassatt later expressed satisfaction at the irony of Lousine Havermeyer&#x27;s 1915 joint exhibition of hers and Degas&#x27; work being held in aid of women&#x27;s suffrage, equally capable of affectionately repeating Degas&#x27; antifemale comments as being estranged by them (when viewing her &quot;Two Women Picking Fruit&quot; for the first time, he had commented &quot;No woman has the right to draw like that&quot;). From the 1890s onwards their relationship took on a decidedly commercial aspect, as in general had Cassatt&#x27;s other relations with the Impressionist circle; nevertheless they continued to visit each other until Degas died in 1917.

==Later life==
Cassatt&#x27;s reputation is based on an extensive series of rigorously drawn and tenderly observed paintings and prints on the theme of the mother and child. The earliest dated work on this subject is the drypoint &quot;Gardner Held by His Mother&quot; (an impression inscribed &quot;Jan/88&quot; is in the New York Public Library), although she had painted a few earlier works on the theme. Some of these works depict her own relatives, friends, or clients, although in her later years she generally used professional models in compositions that are often reminiscent of Italian Renaissance depictions of the Madonna and Child. After 1900, she concentrated almost exclusively on mother-and-child subjects, such as &quot;Woman with a Sunflower&quot;. Viewers may be surprised to find that despite her focus on portraying mother-child pairs in her portraits, &quot;Cassatt rejected the idea of becoming a wife and mother...&quot;

The 1890s were Cassatt&#x27;s busiest and most creative period. She had matured considerably and became more diplomatic and less blunt in her opinions. She also became a role model for young American artists who sought her advice. Among them was Lucy A. Bacon, whom Cassatt introduced to Camille Pissarro. Though the Impressionist group disbanded, Cassatt still had contact with some of the members, including Renoir, Monet, and Pissarro.

In 1891, she exhibited a series of highly original colored drypoint and aquatint prints, including &quot;Woman Bathing&quot; and &quot;The Coiffure&quot;, inspired by the Japanese masters shown in Paris the year before. (See Japonism) Cassatt was attracted to the simplicity and clarity of Japanese design, and the skillful use of blocks of color. In her interpretation, she used primarily light, delicate pastel colors and avoided black (a &quot;forbidden&quot; color among the Impressionists). Adelyn D. Breeskin, the author of two &quot;catalogue raisonnés&quot; of Cassatt&#x27;s work, comments that these colored prints, &quot;now stand as her most original contribution... adding a new chapter to the history of graphic arts...technically, as color prints, they have never been surpassed&quot;.

Also in 1891, Chicago socialite Bertha Palmer approached Cassatt to paint a 12&#x27; × 58&#x27; mural about &quot;Modern Woman&quot; for the Women&#x27;s Building for the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition to be held in 1893. Cassatt completed the project over the next two years while living in France with her mother. The mural was designed as a triptych. The central theme was titled &quot;Young Women Plucking the Fruits of Knowledge or Science&quot;. The left panel was &quot;Young Girls Pursuing Fame&quot; and the right panel &quot;Arts, Music, Dancing&quot;. The mural displays a community of women apart from their relation to men, as accomplished persons in their own right. Palmer considered Cassatt to be an American treasure and could think of no one better to paint a mural at an exposition that was to do so much to focus the world&#x27;s attention on the status of women. Following the world&#x27;s fair, the mural came into Bertha Palmer&#x27;s possession, where it remained as late as 1911, but it disappeared after Palmer&#x27;s death in 1918. Cassatt made several studies and paintings on themes similar to those in the mural, so it is possible to see her development of those ideas and images. Cassatt also exhibited other paintings in the Exposition.

As the new century arrived, Cassatt served as an advisor to several major art collectors and stipulated that they eventually donate their purchases to American art museums. In recognition of her contributions to the arts, France awarded her the Légion d&#x27;honneur in 1904. Although instrumental in advising American collectors, recognition of her art came more slowly in the United States. Even among her family members back in America, she received little recognition and was totally overshadowed by her famous brother.

Mary Cassatt&#x27;s brother, Alexander Cassatt, was president of the Pennsylvania Railroad from 1899 until his death in 1906. She was shaken, as they had been close, but she continued to be very productive in the years leading up to 1910. An increasing sentimentality is apparent in her work of the 1900s; her work was popular with the public and the critics, but she was no longer breaking new ground, and her Impressionist colleagues who once provided stimulation and criticism were dying. She was hostile to such new developments in art as post-Impressionism, Fauvism and Cubism. Two of her works appeared in the Armory Show of 1913, both images of a mother and child.

A trip to Egypt in 1910 impressed Cassatt with the beauty of its ancient art, but was followed by a crisis of creativity; not only had the trip exhausted her, but she declared herself &quot;crushed by the strength of this Art&quot;, saying, &quot;I fought against it but it conquered, it is surely the greatest Art the past has left us ... how are my feeble hands to ever paint the effect on me.&quot; Diagnosed with diabetes, rheumatism, neuralgia, and cataracts in 1911, she did not slow down, but after 1914 she was forced to stop painting as she became almost blind. In 1925 she was featured on 32nd Annual Exhibition of American Art at the Cincinnati Art Museum, together with Louise Woodroofe, Childe Hassam and Robert Henri.

Cassatt died on June 14, 1926, at Château de Beaufresne, near Paris, and was buried in the family vault at Le Mesnil-Théribus, France.
