<text>Mooney is a family name which is probably predominantly derived from the Irish Ó Maonaigh, pronounced Om-weeneey. It can also be spelled Moony, Moonie, Mainey, Mauney, Meaney and Meeney depending on the dialectic pronunciation that was anglicised.

==Origins==
The origin of the Moony or Mooney families is lost in antiquity. The name is derived from &quot;maoin&quot;, a Gaelic word meaning &quot;wealth&quot; or &quot;treasure of treasure&quot;, hence when O&#x27;Maonaigh was anglicised to Mooney it meant &quot;the descendant of the wealthy one.&quot;

According to Irish lore, the Mooney family comes from one of the largest and most noble Irish lines. They are said to be descendants of the ancient Irish King Heremon, who, along with his brother Herber, conquered Ireland. Heremon slew his brother shortly after their invasion, took the throne for himself, and fathered a line of kings of Ireland that include Malachi II, and King Niall of the Nine Hostages.

Baptismal records, parish records, ancient land grants, the Annals of the Four Masters, and books by O&#x27;Hart, McLysaght, and O&#x27;Brien were all used in researching the history of the Mooney family name. These varied and often ancient records indicate that distant septs of the name arose in several places throughout Ireland. The most known and most numerous sept came from the county of Offaly. The members of this sept were from Chieftain Monach, son of Ailill Mor, Lord of Ulster, who was descended from the Kings of Connacht. These family members gave their name to town lands called Ballymooney both in that county and in the neighbouring county of Leix.

<text>The Minnesota Twins are an American professional baseball team based in Minneapolis. The Twins compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) Central Division. The team is named after the Twin Cities moniker for the two adjacent cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul.

The franchise was founded in Washington, D.C., in 1901 as the Washington Senators. The team moved to Minnesota and was renamed the Minnesota Twins for the start of the 1961 season. The Twins played in Metropolitan Stadium from 1961 to 1981 and in the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome from 1982 to 2009. The team has played at Target Field since 2010.

The franchise won the World Series in 1924 as the Senators, and in 1987 and 1991 as the Twins. From 1901 to 2023, the Senators/Twins franchise&#x27;s overall regular-season win–loss–tie record is (); as the Twins (through 2024), it is ().

==History==
===Washington Nationals/Senators: 1901–1960===

The team was founded in Washington, D.C., in as one of the eight original teams of the American League. It was named the Washington Senators from 1901 to 1904, the Washington Nationals from 1905 to 1955, and the Senators again from 1956 to 1960. But the team was commonly referred to as the Senators throughout its history (and unofficially as the &quot;Grifs&quot; during Clark Griffith&#x27;s tenure as manager from 1912 to 1920). The name &quot;Nationals&quot; appeared on uniforms for only two seasons, and then was replaced with the &quot;W&quot; logo. The media often shortened the nickname to &quot;Nats&quot; — even for the 1961 expansion team. The names &quot;Nationals&quot; and &quot;Nats&quot; were revived in 2005, when the Montreal Expos moved to Washington to become the Nationals.

The Washington Senators spent the first decade of their existence finishing near the bottom of the American League standings. The team&#x27;s long bouts of mediocrity were immortalized in the 1955 Broadway musical &quot;Damn Yankees&quot;. Their fortunes began to improve with the arrival of 19-year-old pitcher, Walter Johnson, in 1907. Johnson blossomed in 1911 with 25 victories, although the team still finished the season in seventh place. In 1912, the Senators improved dramatically, as their pitching staff led the league in team earned run average and in strikeouts. Johnson won 33 games while teammate Bob Groom added another 24 wins to help the Senators finish the season in second place. Griffith joined the team in 1912 and became the team&#x27;s owner in 1920. (The franchise remained under Griffith family ownership until 1984.) The Senators continued to perform respectably in 1913 with Johnson posting a career-high 35 victories, as the team once again finished in second place. The Senators then fell into another decline for the next decade.
The team had a period of prolonged success in the 1920s and 1930s, led by Walter Johnson, as well as fellow Hall-of-Famers Bucky Harris, Goose Goslin, Sam Rice, Heinie Manush, and Joe Cronin. In particular, a rejuvenated Johnson rebounded in 1924 to win 23 games with the help of his catcher, Muddy Ruel, as the Senators won the American League pennant for the first time in its history. The Senators then faced John McGraw&#x27;s heavily favored New York Giants in the 1924 World Series. The two teams traded wins back and forth with three games of the first six being decided by one run. In the deciding 7th game, the Senators were trailing the Giants 3–1 in the 8th inning when Bucky Harris hit a routine ground ball to third that hit a pebble and took a bad hop over Giants third baseman Freddie Lindstrom. Two runners scored on the play, tying the score at three. An aging Walter Johnson came in to pitch the ninth inning and held the Giants scoreless into extra innings. In the bottom of the twelfth inning, Ruel hit a high, foul ball directly over home plate. The Giants&#x27; catcher, Hank Gowdy, dropped his protective mask to field the ball but, failing to toss the mask aside, stumbled over it and dropped the ball, thus giving Ruel another chance to bat. On the next pitch, Ruel hit a double; he proceeded to score the winning run when Earl McNeely hit a ground ball that took another bad hop over Lindstrom&#x27;s head. This would mark the only World Series triumph for the franchise during their 60-year tenure in Washington.

The following season they repeated as American League champions but ultimately lost the 1925 World Series to the Pittsburgh Pirates. After Walter Johnson retired in 1927, he was hired as manager of the Senators. After enduring a few losing seasons, the team returned to contention in 1930. In 1933, Senators owner Griffith returned to the formula that worked for him nine years earlier: 26-year-old shortstop Joe Cronin became player-manager. The Senators posted a 99–53 record and cruised to the pennant seven games ahead of the New York Yankees, but in the 1933 World Series the Giants exacted their revenge, winning in five games. Following the loss, the Senators sank all the way to seventh place in 1934 and attendance began to fall. Despite the return of Harris as manager from 1935 to 1942 and again from 1950 to 1954, Washington was mostly a losing ball club for the next 25 years contending for the pennant only during World War II. Washington came to be known as &quot;first in war, first in peace, and last in the American League&quot;; their hard luck drove the plot of the musical and film &quot;Damn Yankees&quot;. Cecil Travis, Buddy Myer (1935 A.L. batting champion), Roy Sievers, Mickey Vernon (batting champion in 1946 and 1953), and Eddie Yost were notable Senators players whose careers were spent in obscurity on losing teams. In 1954, the Senators signed future Hall of Fame member Harmon Killebrew. By 1959, he was the Senators&#x27; regular third baseman and led the league with 42 home runs, earning him a starting spot on the American League All-Star team.

After Griffith&#x27;s death in 1955, his nephew and adopted son Calvin took over the team presidency. Calvin sold Griffith Stadium to the city of Washington and leased it back. This led to speculation that the team was planning to move, as the Boston Braves, St. Louis Browns, and Philadelphia Athletics had done in recent years. By 1957, after an early flirtation with San Francisco (where the New York Giants would move after the season), Griffith began courting Minneapolis–St. Paul, a prolonged process that resulted in his rejecting the Twin Cities&#x27; first offer before agreeing to move. Home attendance in Washington, D.C., steadily increased from 425,238 in 1955 to 475,288 in 1958, and then jumped to 615,372 in 1959. However, part of the Minnesota deal guaranteed a million fans a year for three years, plus the potential to double TV and radio money.

The American League opposed the move at first, but in 1960 a deal was reached. Major League Baseball agreed to let Griffith move his team to the Minneapolis-St. Paul region and allowed a new Senators team to be formed in Washington for the 1961 season.

Asked nearly two decades later why he moved the team, Griffith replied, &quot;I&#x27;ll tell you why we came to Minnesota, it was when I found out you only had 15,000 blacks here. Black people don&#x27;t go to ball games, but they&#x27;ll fill up a rassling ring and put up such a chant it&#x27;ll scare you to death. It&#x27;s unbelievable. We came here because you&#x27;ve got good, hard-working, white people here.&quot;

===Minnesota Twins: 1961–present===

Renamed the Minnesota Twins, the team set up shop in Metropolitan Stadium in Bloomington, a suburb of Minneapolis. Success came quickly to the team in Minnesota. Sluggers Harmon Killebrew and Bob Allison, who had been stars in Washington, were joined by Tony Oliva and Zoilo Versalles, and later second baseman Rod Carew and pitchers Jim Kaat and Jim Perry, winning the American League pennant in 1965. A second wave of success came in the late 1980s and early 1990s under manager Tom Kelly, led by Kent Hrbek, Bert Blyleven, Frank Viola, and Kirby Puckett, winning the franchise&#x27;s second and third World Series (and first and second in Minnesota).

The name &quot;Twins&quot; was derived from &quot;Twin Cities&quot;, a popular nickname for the two cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul and sometimes used in reference to the entire Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan region. The NBA&#x27;s Minneapolis Lakers had moved to Los Angeles in 1960 due to poor attendance, blamed in part on a perceived reluctance of fans in Saint Paul to support the team. Griffith was determined not to alienate fans in either city by naming the team after one city or the other. He proposed to name the team the &quot;Twin Cities Twins&quot;, but MLB objected and Griffith therefore named the team the Minnesota Twins. The team was allowed to keep its original &quot;TC&quot; (for Twin Cities) insignia for its caps. The team&#x27;s logo shows two men, one in a Minneapolis Millers uniform and one in a St. Paul Saints uniform, shaking hands across the Mississippi River within an outline of the state of Minnesota. The &quot;TC&quot; remained on the Twins&#x27; caps until 1987, when they adopted new uniforms. By this time, the team felt it was established enough to put an &quot;M&quot; on its cap without having Saint Paul fans think it stood for Minneapolis. The &quot;TC&quot; logo was moved to a sleeve on the jerseys, occasionally appeared as an alternate cap design, and then was reinstated as the main cap logo in 2010. Both the &quot;TC&quot; and &quot;Minnie &amp; Paul&quot; logos remain the team&#x27;s primary insignia.
====1960s====
The Twins were eagerly greeted in Minnesota when they arrived in 1961. They brought a nucleus of talented players: Harmon Killebrew, Bob Allison, Camilo Pascual, Zoilo Versalles, Jim Kaat, Earl Battey, and Lenny Green. Tony Oliva, who would go on to win American League batting championships in 1964, 1965 and 1971, made his major league debut in 1962. That year, the Twins won 91 games, the most by the franchise since 1933. Behind Mudcat Grant&#x27;s 21 victories, Versalles&#x27; A.L. MVP season and Oliva&#x27;s batting title, the Twins won 102 games and the American League Pennant in 1965, but they were defeated in the World Series by the Los Angeles Dodgers in seven games (behind the Series MVP, Sandy Koufax, who compiled a 2–1 record, including winning the seventh game).

In 1962, the Minnesota State Commission on Discrimination filed a complaint against the Twins, which was the only MLB team still segregating players during spring training and when traveling in the southern United States.

Heading into the final weekend of the 1967 season, when Rod Carew was named the A.L. Rookie of the Year, the Twins, Boston Red Sox, Chicago White Sox, and Detroit Tigers all had a shot at clinching the American League championship. The Twins and the Red Sox started the weekend tied for 1st place and played against each other in Boston for the final two games of the season. The Red Sox won both games, seizing their first pennant since 1946 with a 92–70 record. The Twins and Tigers both finished one game back, with 91–71 records, while the White Sox finished three games back, at 89–73. In 1969, the new manager of the Twins, Billy Martin, pushed aggressive base running all-around, with Carew stealing home seven times in the season (1 short of Ty Cobb&#x27;s Major League Record) in addition to winning the first of seven A.L. batting championships. With Killebrew slugging 49 homers and winning the AL MVP Award, these 1969 Twins won the first American League Western Division Championship, but they lost three straight games to the Baltimore Orioles, winners of 109 games, in the first American League Championship Series. The Orioles would go on to be upset by the New York Mets in the World Series. Martin was fired after the season, in part due to an August fight in Detroit with 20-game winner Dave Boswell and outfielder Bob Allison, in an alley outside the Lindell A.C. bar. Bill Rigney led the Twins to a repeat division title in 1970, behind the star pitching of Jim Perry (24–12), the A.L. Cy Young Award winner, while the Orioles again won the Eastern Division Championship behind the star pitching of Jim Palmer. Once again, the Orioles won the A.L. Championship Series in a three-game sweep, and this time they would win the World Series.

====1970s====
After winning the division again in 1970, the team entered an eight-year dry spell, finishing around the .500 mark. Killebrew departed after 1974. Owner Calvin Griffith faced financial difficulty with the start of free agency, costing the Twins the services of Lyman Bostock and Larry Hisle, who left as free agents after the 1977 season, and Carew, who was traded after the 1978 season. In 1975, Carew won his fourth consecutive AL batting title, having already joined Ty Cobb as the only players to lead the major leagues in batting average for three consecutive seasons. In , Carew batted .388, which was the highest in baseball since Boston&#x27;s Ted Williams hit .406 in ; he won the 1977 AL MVP Award. He won another batting title in 1978, hitting .333.

====1980s–90s====

In 1982, the Twins moved into the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in downtown Minneapolis, which they shared with the Minnesota Vikings. After a 16–54 start, the Twins were on the verge on becoming the worst team in MLB history. They turned the season around somewhat, but still lost 102 games, finishing with what is currently the second-worst record in Twins history (beaten only by the 2016 team, which lost 103 games), despite the .301 average, 23 homers and 92 RBI from rookie Kent Hrbek. In 1984, Griffith sold the Twins to multi-billionaire banker/financier Carl Pohlad. Pohlad beat a larger offer by New York businessman Donald Trump by promising to keep the club in Minnesota. The Metrodome hosted the 1985 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. After several losing seasons, the 1987 team, led by Hrbek, Gary Gaetti, Frank Viola (A.L. Cy Young winner in 1988), Bert Blyleven, Jeff Reardon, Tom Brunansky, Dan Gladden, and rising star Kirby Puckett, returned to the World Series after defeating the favored Detroit Tigers in the ALCS, 4 games to 1. Tom Kelly managed the Twins to World Series victories over the St. Louis Cardinals in 1987 and the Atlanta Braves in 1991. The 1988 Twins were the first team in American League history to draw more than 3 million fans. On July 17, 1990, the Twins became the only team in major league history to pull off two triple plays in the same game. Twins&#x27; pitcher and Minnesota native Jack Morris was the star of the series in 1991, going 2–0 in his three starts with a 1.17 ERA. 1991 also marked the first time that any team that finished in last place in their division would advance to the World Series the following season; both the Twins and the Braves did this in 1991. Contributors to the 1991 Twins&#x27; improvement from 74 wins to 95 included Chuck Knoblauch, the A.L. Rookie of the Year; Scott Erickson, 20-game winner; new closer Rick Aguilera and new designated hitter Chili Davis.

The World Series in 1991 is regarded by many as one of the classics of all time. In this Series, four games were won during the teams&#x27; final at-bat, and three of these were in extra innings. The Atlanta Braves won all three of their games in Atlanta, and the Twins won all four of their games in Minnesota. Up until then, it was the second time in MLB history when a team won all its home games on their way to winning the World Series. The Twins also did it in 1987. The sixth game was a legendary one for Puckett, who tripled in a run, made a sensational leaping catch against the wall, and finally in the 11th inning hit the game-winning home run. Before Puckett&#x27;s home run, the Braves brought in Charlie Leibrandt to face him. Chili Davis was on-deck. Puckett told Davis he was going to bunt, and Davis was going to win the game. Davis told him he was going to sit on Leibrandt&#x27;s change-up and send everyone home. The seventh game was tied 0–0 after the regulation nine innings, and marked only the second time that the seventh game of the World Series had ever gone into extra innings. The Twins won on a walk-off RBI single by Gene Larkin in the bottom of the 10th inning, after Morris had pitched ten shutout innings against the Braves. The seventh game of the 1991 World Series is widely regarded as one of the greatest games in the history of professional baseball.

After a winning season in 1992 but falling short of Oakland in the division, the Twins fell into a years-long stretch of mediocrity, posting a losing record each season for the next eight: 71–91 in 1993, 50–63 in 1994, 56–88 in 1995, 78–84 in 1996, 68–94 in 1997, 70–92 in 1998, 63–97 in 1999 and 69–93 in 2000. From 1994 to 1997, a long sequence of retirements and injuries hurt the team badly, and Tom Kelly spent the remainder of his managerial career attempting to rebuild the Twins. In 1997, owner Carl Pohlad almost sold the Twins to North Carolina businessman Don Beaver, who would have moved the team to the Piedmont Triad area.

Puckett was forced to retire at age 35 due to loss of vision in one eye from a central retinal vein occlusion. The 1989 A.L. batting champion, he retired as the Twins&#x27; all-time leader in career hits, runs, doubles, and total bases. At the time of his retirement, his .318 career batting average was the highest by any right-handed American League batter since Joe DiMaggio. Puckett was the fourth baseball player during the 20th century to record 1,000 hits in his first five full calendar years in Major League Baseball, and was the second to record 2,000 hits during his first 10 full calendar years. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2001, his first year of eligibility.

====2000s====

The Twins dominated the Central Division in the first decade of the new century, winning the division in six of those ten years (&#x27;02, &#x27;03, &#x27;04, &#x27;06, &#x27;09 and &#x27;10), and nearly winning it in &#x27;08 as well. From 2001 to 2006, the Twins compiled the longest streak of consecutive winning seasons since moving to Minnesota.

Threatened with closure by league contraction, the 2002 team battled back to reach the American League Championship Series before being eliminated 4–1 by that year&#x27;s World Series champion Anaheim Angels.

In 2006, the Twins won the division on the last day of the regular season (the only day all season they held sole possession of first place) but lost to the Oakland Athletics in the ALDS. Ozzie Guillén coined a nickname for this squad, calling the Twins &quot;little piranhas&quot;. The Twins players embraced the label, and in response, the Twins Front office started a &quot;Piranha Night&quot;, with piranha finger puppets given out to the first 10,000 fans. Scoreboard operators sometimes played an animated sequence of piranhas munching under that caption in situations where the Twins were scoring runs playing &quot;small ball&quot;, and the stadium vendors sold T-shirts and hats advertising &quot;The Little Piranhas&quot;. The Twins also had the AL MVP in Justin Morneau, the AL batting champion in Joe Mauer, and the AL Cy Young Award winner in Johan Santana.

In 2008, the Twins finished the regular season tied with the White Sox on top of the AL Central, forcing a one-game playoff in Chicago to determine the division champion. The Twins lost that game and missed the playoffs. The game location was determined by rule of a coin flip that was conducted in mid-September. This rule was changed for the start of the 2009 season, making the site for any tiebreaker game to be determined by the winner of the regular season head-to-head record between the teams involved.
After a year where the Twins played .500 baseball for most of the season, the team won 17 of their last 21 games to tie the Detroit Tigers for the lead in the Central Division. The Twins were able to use the play-in game rule to their advantage when they won the AL Central at the end of the regular season by way of a 6–5 tiebreaker game that concluded with a 12th-inning walk-off hit by Alexi Casilla to right field, that scored Carlos Gómez. However, they failed to advance to the American League Championship Series as they lost the American League Divisional Series in three straight games to the eventual World Series champion New York Yankees. That year, Joe Mauer became only the second catcher in 33 years to win the AL MVP award. Iván Rodríguez won for the Texas Rangers in 1999, previous to that, the last catcher to win an AL MVP was the New York Yankees Thurman Munson in 1976.

2010 marked Minnesota&#x27;s inaugural season played at Target Field, where the Twins finished the regular season with a record of 94–68, clinching the AL Central Division title for the 6th time in 9 years under manager Ron Gardenhire. New regular players included rookie Danny Valencia at third base, designated hitter Jim Thome, closer Matt Capps, infielder J. J. Hardy, and infielder Orlando Hudson. In relief pitching roles were late additions Brian Fuentes and Randy Flores. On July 7, the team suffered a major blow when Justin Morneau sustained a concussion, which kept him out of the lineup for the rest of the season. In the divisional series, the Twins lost to the Yankees in a three-game sweep for the second consecutive year. Following the season, Ron Gardenhire received AL Manager of the Year honors after finishing as a runner up in several prior years.

=====2017–present=====
In 2017, the Twins went 85–77, finishing 2nd In the AL Central. Following Brian Dozier&#x27;s 34 home runs, Miguel Sanó, Byron Buxton, and Eddie Rosario all had breakout years, while Joe Mauer hit .305. They ended up making the playoffs, which made them the first ever team to lose 100 games the previous year and make the playoffs the next season. They lost to the Yankees in the wild card round.

The 2018 season did not go as well. The Twins went 78–84, and did not return to the post-season. Sanó and Buxton were injured most of the year and eventually both sent down to the minors, while long-time Twin Brian Dozier was traded at the deadline. One bright spot came at the end of the season, when hometown hero Joe Mauer returned to catcher (his original position) for his final game, ending his career with a signature double and standing ovation. Another highlight was the team&#x27;s two-game series against the Cleveland Indians in San Juan, Puerto Rico. After the season, manager Paul Molitor was fired. Free agent signing Logan Morrison and long-time veteran Ervin Santana declared free agency.

In 2019, the Twins clinched the AL Central Division for the first time since 2010, finishing the season with the second-most wins in franchise history with 101, one short of the 1965 season. The team combined for a total of 307 home runs, the most in MLB history for a single season. The team&#x27;s slugging prowess has earned them the nickname the &quot;Bomba Squad&quot;. In the 2019 ALDS, the Twins opponents were the New York Yankees, who finished one home run behind at 306 and the second team to break the 300 home run mark. The Twins were swept again, and extend their postseason losing streak to 16, dating back to the 2004 ALDS. On September 17, 2019, Miguel Sanó hit a 482-foot home run to make the Twins the first team in major league history to have five players with at least 30 home runs in a season.

In 2023 the Minnesota Twins struggled through the first half, falling under .500 just before the All-Star break before beginning a late season surge that saw them take control of the AL Central. They finished as the third seed in the AL for the 2023 MLB Playoffs and faced the Toronto Blue Jays in the AL Wild Card round. Behind dominant pitching they won both of the first 2 games in the 3 game series, winning their first playoff game since 2004 (breaking an 0–18 postseason streak, the longest in North American sports history) and winning their first playoff series since the 2002 ALDS against the Oakland Athletics.

===Threats to move or disband the team===

The quirks of the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, including the turf floor and the white roof, gave the Twins a home-field advantage that helped them win the World Series in 1987 and 1991, at least in the opinion of their opponents. The Twins went 12–1 in postseason home games during those two seasons, becoming the first and second teams to sweep all four home games in a World Series. (The feat was repeated by the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2001.) Nevertheless, the Twins argued that the Metrodome was obsolete. Furthermore, they said sharing a stadium with the NFL&#x27;s Minnesota Vikings, as they had been doing since their 1961 move to Minnesota, limited the team&#x27;s revenue and made it difficult to sustain a top-notch, competitive team. The team was rumored to contemplate moving to New Jersey, Las Vegas, Portland, Oregon, the Greensboro/Winston-Salem, North Carolina area, and elsewhere in search of a more financially competitive market. In 2002, the team was nearly disbanded when Major League Baseball selected the Twins and the Montreal Expos (now the Washington Nationals franchise) for elimination due to their financial weakness. The impetus for league contraction diminished after a court decision forced the Twins to play out their lease on the Metrodome. However, Twins owner Carl Pohlad continued his efforts to move, pursuing litigation against the Metropolitan Stadium Commission and obtaining a state court ruling that his team was not obligated to play in the Metrodome after the 2006 season. This cleared the way for the Twins to move or disband before the 2007 season if a new deal was not reached.

===Target Field===
In response to the threatened loss of the Twins, the Minnesota private and public sector negotiated and approved a financing package for a replacement stadium— a baseball-only outdoor, natural turf ballpark in the Warehouse District of downtown Minneapolis— owned by a new entity known as the Minnesota Ballpark Authority. Target Field was constructed at a cost of $544.4 million (including site acquisition and infrastructure), utilizing the proceeds of a $392 million public bond offering based on a 0.15% sales tax in Hennepin County and private financing of $185 million provided by the Pohlad family. As part of the deal, the Twins also signed a 30-year lease of the new stadium, effectively guaranteeing the continuation of the team in Minnesota for a long time to come. Construction of the new field began in 2007, and was completed in December 2009, in time for the 2010 season. Commissioner Bud Selig, who earlier had threatened to disband the team, observed that without the new stadium the Twins could not have committed to sign their star player, catcher Joe Mauer, to an 8-year, $184 million contract extension. The first regular-season game in Target Field was played against the Boston Red Sox on April 12, 2010, with Mauer driving in two runs and going 3-for-5 to help the Twins defeat the Red Sox, 5–2.

On May 18, 2011, Target Field was named &quot;The Best Place To Shop&quot; by Street and Smith&#x27;s &quot;SportsBusiness Journal&quot; at the magazine&#x27;s 2011 Sports Business Awards Ceremony in New York City. It was also named &quot;The Best Sports Stadium in North America&quot; by &quot;ESPN The Magazine&quot; in a ranking that included over 120 different stadiums, ballparks and arenas from around North America. The stadium hosted the 85th Major League Baseball All-Star Game and the Home Run Derby in 2014. In mid 2020, following protests over the murder of George Floyd, a statue of former owner Calvin Griffith was removed from Target Plaza outside of the stadium due to his history of racist comments.

==Uniforms==
===Current===
Starting in 2023, the Twins made a drastic overhaul to their uniforms. The white home uniform features the updated &quot;Twins&quot; script (with the underline below &quot;win&quot;) in red with navy numbers. On the back, the player names are in navy and numbers are in red. On the left sleeve, the Minnesota state map in navy was added with a red star to represent the Twin Cities of Minneapolis–St. Paul. The home cap is all-navy with the updated &quot;TC&quot; insignia. The home helmet is navy with a white panel and red brim and features the new &quot;TC&quot; insignia.

Road gray uniforms featured an all-caps &quot;MINNESOTA&quot; in navy with red numbers. On the back, the player names are in navy and numbers are in red. Likewise, the new navy Minnesota map with red star was featured on the left sleeve. Navy pinstripes were also added. The road cap is also all-navy, but with the white &quot;M&quot; and a red star on top representing the north star; this design also serves as the basis of their road batting helmet.

The alternate navy uniforms, worn both at home and on the road, has the all-caps &quot;MINNESOTA&quot; in white with red numbers. On the back, player names are also rendered in white while numbers are in red. The left sleeve features the updated &quot;TC&quot; insignia. The uniforms are paired with the road all-navy &quot;M&quot; cap with red star, with the white-paneled &quot;TC&quot; helmet used on home games and the &quot;M&quot; all-navy helmet used on the road.

The alternate home cream uniform featured a new &quot;Twin Cities&quot; wordmark (with the underline below &quot;win Citie&quot;) in navy. The set, which lacked red, also featured two crossed navy flags representing both Minneapolis (&quot;M&quot;) and St. Paul (&quot;STP&quot;). An alternate all-navy cap with the &quot;TC&quot; insignia is used, except the &quot;TC&quot; is in cream and also lacked red elements. This design also became the basis of the all-navy alternate home &quot;TC&quot; helmet.

Added in 2024 is a City Connect uniform, visually representing the state&#x27;s nickname of &quot;Land of 10,000 Lakes&quot;. The predominantly sublimated blue uniform with yellow accents featured the &quot;MN&quot; abbreviation on the left chest, with the yellow four-point star representing the north star. The sleeve patch contained a loon flying through ripples of water, with baseball stitching comprising the eyes and the north star representing its beak. Caps are blue with yellow brim, and contained the Minnesota state outline with a yellow star representing the Twin Cities and the northern lights reflected in a water line of a lake. The right side of the caps featured the &quot;10,000 Lakes&quot; moniker. 

===Past uniforms===
From 1961 to 1971 the Twins sported uniforms bearing the classic &quot;Twins&quot; script and numerals in navy outlined in red. They wore navy caps with an interlocking &quot;TC&quot; on the front; this was adopted because Griffith was well aware of the bitter rivalry between Minneapolis and Saint Paul and didn&#x27;t want to alienate fans in either city. The original &quot;Minnie and Paul&quot; alternate logo appears on the left sleeve of both the pinstriped white home uniform and gray road uniform.

For the 1972 season the Twins updated their uniforms. The color scheme on the &quot;Twins&quot; script and numerals were reversed, pinstripes were removed from the home uniform, and an updated &quot;Minnie and Paul&quot; roundel patch replaced the originals on the left sleeve.

In 1973, the Twins switched to polyester pullover uniforms, which included a powder blue road uniform. Chest numerals were added while a navy-brimmed red cap was used with the home uniform. The original &quot;Minnie and Paul&quot; logo returned to the left sleeve. Player names in red were added to the road uniform in 1977.

In 1987, the Twins updated their look. Home white uniforms brought back the pinstripes along with the modern-day &quot;Twins&quot; script. By this time, the franchise felt it was established enough in the area that it could put a stylized &quot;M&quot; on its cap without having fans in St. Paul think it stood for Minneapolis. The &quot;TC&quot; insignia adorned the left sleeve, later replaced by the modern &quot;Minnie and Paul&quot; alternate in 2002. Road gray uniforms, which also featured pinstripes, were emblazoned with &quot;Minnesota&quot; in red block letters outlined in navy, while the updated primary logo adorned the left sleeve. Both uniforms kept the red numerals trimmed in navy, but the color on the player names was changed to navy. In 1997, player names were added to the home uniform. Initially, both uniforms were paired with an all-navy cap featuring the underlined &quot;M&quot; in front, but in 2002, the &quot;TC&quot; cap was brought back as a home cap while the &quot;M&quot; cap was used on the road. The &quot;M&quot; cap was retired following the 2010 season, though the team continued to wear them as a throwback on special occasions.

For a few games during the 1997 season, the Twins wore red alternate uniforms, which featured navy piping and letters in white trimmed in navy. In that same year, the Twins also released a road navy alternate uniform, featuring red piping, &quot;Minnesota&quot; and player names in white block letters outlined in red, and red numerals outlined in white. The following season, the Twins replaced the red uniforms with a home navy alternate, which features the &quot;Twins&quot; script and back numerals in red outlined in white, and player names and chest numerals in white outlined in red. Both uniforms contained the &quot;TC&quot; (later modern &quot;Minnie and Paul&quot;) and primary logo sleeve patches respectively. The Twins also brought back the navy-brimmed red cap for a few games with the home navy alternates. The road navy alternates remained in use until 2009, with the home navy version worn for the last time in the 2013 season.

The Twins also wore three other alternate uniforms in the past. In 2006, the Twins wore a sleeveless variation of their regular home uniforms with navy undershirts, which they wore until 2010. They also wore a buttoned version of their 1973–86 home uniforms in 2009, before giving way to the throwback off-white version of their 1961–71 home uniforms from 2010 to 2018.

In 2010, the Twins modified their road uniforms upon moving to Target Field. The pinstriped home uniforms remained, but the road primary now featured an updated &quot;Minnesota&quot; script (with an underline below &quot;innesot&quot;) in red trimmed in navy. Letters are in navy while numerals (both on the chest and on the back) are in red trimmed in navy. The team&#x27;s primary logo appears on the left sleeve. Meanwhile, the navy alternate road uniform shared the same look as the regular road uniforms, but with a few differences. The &quot;Minnesota&quot; script is in red outlined in white, letters and chest numerals are in white outlined in red, and back numerals are in red outlined in white. Red piping is also added. Both uniforms were paired with either the all-navy or the red-brimmed navy &quot;TC&quot; cap.

In 2015, the Twins changed their home uniform. It features the modern &quot;Twins&quot; script (with an underline below &quot;win&quot;) in navy outlined in red with Kasota gold drop shadows. Letters and numerals also take on the same color as the &quot;Twins&quot; script. The modern &quot;Minnie and Paul&quot; alternate logo (with the state of Minnesota in navy outlined in Kasota gold) appears on the left sleeve. Caps are in all-navy with the interlocking &quot;TC&quot; outlined in Kasota gold. The following year, they unveiled a red alternate uniform, which features the &quot;TC&quot; insignia outlined in Kasota gold on the left chest. Letters and numerals are in navy outlined in white with Kasota gold drop shadows. The &quot;Minnie and Paul&quot; alternate logo appears on the left sleeve. The uniform is paired with a navy-brimmed red cap with the &quot;TC&quot; outlined in Kasota gold.

In 2019, a new home navy alternate was released, featuring the classic &quot;Twins&quot; script (with a tail underline accent after the letter &quot;s&quot;) in red outlined in navy and Kasota gold. Letters and numerals also take on the same color as the &quot;Twins&quot; script. As with the home white uniforms, it is paired with the all-navy Kasota gold &quot;TC&quot; cap. The gold-trimmed &quot;TC&quot; insignia also appears on the left sleeve. The following year, a throwback-inspired powder blue uniform was unveiled. A modern buttoned version of the road uniform the team used from 1973 to 1986, the set contains the classic &quot;Twins&quot; script in red outlined in navy, along with red letters on the back and red numerals (both on the chest and on the back) outlined in navy. The &quot;Minnie and Paul&quot; alternate logo appears on the left sleeve. The uniform is paired with the primary all-navy &quot;TC&quot; cap minus the Kasota gold accents, which is also used on the helmets regardless of uniform.

===Baseball Hall of Fame members===

Molitor, Morris, and Winfield were all St. Paul natives who joined the Twins late in their careers and were warmly received as &quot;hometown heroes&quot;, but were elected to the hall primarily on the basis of their tenures with other teams. Both Molitor and Winfield had their 3,000th hit with Minnesota, while Morris pitched a complete-game shutout for the Twins in game seven of the 1991 World Series. Molitor was the first player in history to hit a triple for his 3,000th hit.

Cronin, Goslin, Griffith, Harris, Johnson, Killebrew and Wynn are listed on the Washington Hall of Stars display at Nationals Park (previously they were listed at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium). So are Ossie Bluege, George Case, Joe Judge, George Selkirk, Roy Sievers, Cecil Travis, Mickey Vernon and Eddie Yost.

===Twins Hall of Fame===


Chuck Knoblauch was voted into the Twins Hall of Fame in 2014, but due to his legal troubles the team canceled his induction.

===Retired numbers===
The Metrodome&#x27;s upper deck in center and right fields was partly covered by a curtain containing banners of various titles won, and retired numbers. There was no acknowledgment of the Twins&#x27; prior championships in Washington and several Senator Hall of Famers, such as Walter Johnson, played in the days prior to numbers being used on uniforms. However, Killebrew played seven seasons as a Senator, including two full seasons as a regular prior to the move to Minnesota in 1961.

Prior to the addition of the banners, the Twins acknowledged their retired numbers on the Metrodome&#x27;s outfield fence. Harmon Killebrew&#x27;s #3 was the first to be displayed, as it was the only one the team had retired when they moved in. It was joined by Rod Carew&#x27;s #29 in 1987, Tony Oliva&#x27;s #6 in 1991, Kent Hrbek&#x27;s #14 in 1995, and Kirby Puckett&#x27;s #34 in 1997 before the Twins began hanging the banners to reduce capacity. The championships, meanwhile, were marked on the &quot;Baggie&quot; in right field.
 In the Metrodome, the numbers ran in that order from left to right. In Target Field, they run from right to left, presumably to allow space for additional numbers in the future. The retired numbers also serve as entry points at Target Field, The center field gate is Gate No. 3, honoring Killebrew, the left-field gate is Gate No. 6, honoring Oliva, the home plate gate is Gate No. 14, for Hrbek, the right field gate serves as Gate No. 29, in tribute to Carew, and the plaza gate is known as Gate No. 34, honoring Puckett.

The numbers that have been retired hang within Target Field in front of the tower that serves as the Twins&#x27; executive offices in left field foul territory. The championships banners have been replaced by small pennants that fly on masts at the back of the left-field upper deck. Those pennants, along with the flags flying in the plaza behind right field, serve as a visual cue for the players, suggesting the wind direction and speed.

Jackie Robinson&#x27;s No. 42 was retired by Major League Baseball on April 15, 1997, and formally honored by the Twins on May 23, 1997. Robinson&#x27;s number was positioned to the left of the Twins numbers in both venues.

==Radio and television==

In 2007, the Twins took the rights to the broadcasts in-house and created the Twins Radio Network (TRN). With that new network in place the Twins secured a new Metro Affiliate flagship radio station in KSTP (AM 1500). It replaced WCCO (AM 830), which held broadcast rights for the Twins since the team moved to Minneapolis in 1961. For 2013, the Twins moved to FM radio on KTWN-FM &quot;96.3 K-Twin&quot;, which is owned by the Pohlad family. The original radio voices of the Twins in 1961 were Ray Scott, Halsey Hall and Bob Wolff. After the first season, Herb Carneal replaced Wolff. Twins TV and radio broadcasts were originally sponsored by the Hamm&#x27;s Brewing Company. In 2009, Treasure Island Resort &amp; Casino became the first-ever naming rights partner for the Twins Radio Network, making the commercial name of TRN the Treasure Island Baseball Network. In 2017, it was announced that WCCO would become the flagship station the Twins again starting in 2018, thus returning the team back to its original station after 11 years.

Cory Provus is the current radio play by play announcer, taking over in 2012 for longtime Twins voice John Gordon who retired following the 2011 season. Former Twins OF Dan Gladden serves as color commentator.

TRN broadcasts are originated from the studios at Minnesota News Network and Minnesota Farm Networks. Kris Atteberry hosts the pre-game show, the &quot;Lineup Card&quot; and the &quot;Post-game Download&quot; from those studios except when filling in for Provus or Gladden when they are on vacation.

On April 1, 2007, Herb Carneal, the radio voice of the Twins for all but one year of their existence, died at his home in Minnetonka after a long battle with a list of illnesses. Carneal is in the broadcasters wing of the Baseball Hall of Fame.

In October 2024, as a result of bankruptcy proceedings involving former broadcaster Diamond Sports Group, Major League Baseball&#x27;s local media division announced that it would take over the production and distribution of Twins games starting with the 2025 season.

Prior to 2025, the television rights were held by Bally Sports North with Dick Bremer as the play-by-play announcer. Former Twins players Roy Smalley, Justin Morneau, Glen Perkins, and LaTroy Hawkins served as analysts.

In 2024, the Twins announced that Provus would move to TV play-by-play following the retirement of Dick Bremer who eventually moved to an advisory role in the front office. Atteberry replaced Provus on the radio side.

Bob Casey was the Twins first public-address announcer starting in 1961 and continuing until his death in 2005. He was well known for his unique delivery and his signature announcements of &quot;No smoking in the Metrodome, either go outside or quit!&quot; (or &quot;go back to Boston&quot;, etc.), &quot;Batting 3rd, the center-fielder, No. 34, Kirby Puckett!!!&quot; and asking fans not to &#x27;throw anything or anybody&#x27; onto the field.

==Team and franchise traditions==
Fans wave a &quot;Homer Hanky&quot; to rally the team during play-offs and other crucial games. The Homer Hanky was created by Terrie Robbins of the Star Tribune newspaper in the Twin Cities in 1987. It was her idea to originally give away 60,000 inaugural Homer Hankies. That year, over 2.3 million Homer Hankies were distributed.

The party atmosphere of the Twins clubhouse after a win is well known, the team&#x27;s players unwinding with loud rock music (usually the choice of the winning pitcher) and video games.

The club has several hazing rituals, such as requiring the most junior relief pitcher on the team to carry water and snacks to the bullpen in a brightly colored small child&#x27;s backpack (Barbie in 2005, SpongeBob SquarePants in 2006, Hello Kitty in 2007, Disney Princess and Tinkerbell in 2009, Chewbacca and Darth Vader in 2010), and many of its players, both past and present, are notorious pranksters. For example, Bert Blyleven earned the nickname &quot;The Frying Dutchman&quot; for his ability to pull the &quot;hotfoot&quot; – which entails crawling under the bench in the dugout and lighting a teammate&#x27;s shoelaces on fire.

The team introduced T.C. Bear, its costumed mascot, on April 3, 2000.

==Minnesota Twins in popular culture==
* In &quot;Little Big League&quot;, the Minnesota Twins is inherited by a 12-year-old boy who goes on to manage the team.
* In &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;, Danny, the son of Miles Dyson, wears a Minnesota Twins cap. The movie was released in 1991, which was the same year the Twins won the World Series.
* In &quot;Major League: Back to the Minors&quot;, the character Roger Dorn, from previous &quot;Major League&quot; movies, is owner of the Minnesota Twins.
* In the 1997 film &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy&quot;, Lt. Commander Quinton McHale wears a Minnesota Twins cap.

<text>The Mach number (M or Ma), often only Mach, (; ) is a dimensionless quantity in fluid dynamics representing the ratio of flow velocity past a boundary to the local speed of sound.
It is named after the Austrian physicist and philosopher Ernst Mach.

formula_1

where:
* is the local Mach number,
* is the local flow velocity with respect to the boundaries (either internal, such as an object immersed in the flow, or external, like a channel), and
* is the speed of sound in the medium, which in air varies with the square root of the thermodynamic temperature.

By definition, at Mach1, the local flow velocity is equal to the speed of sound. At Mach0.65, is 65% of the speed of sound (subsonic), and, at Mach1.35, is 35% faster than the speed of sound (supersonic).

The local speed of sound, and hence the Mach number, depends on the temperature of the surrounding gas. The Mach number is primarily used to determine the approximation with which a flow can be treated as an incompressible flow. The medium can be a gas or a liquid. The boundary can be travelling in the medium, or it can be stationary while the medium flows along it, or they can both be moving, with different velocities: what matters is their relative velocity with respect to each other. The boundary can be the boundary of an object immersed in the medium, or of a channel such as a nozzle, diffuser or wind tunnel channelling the medium. As the Mach number is defined as the ratio of two speeds, it is a dimensionless quantity. If  &lt; 0.2–0.3 and the flow is quasi-steady and isothermal, compressibility effects will be small and simplified incompressible flow equations can be used.

==Etymology==
The Mach number is named after the physicist and philosopher Ernst Mach, in honour of his achievements, according to a proposal by the aeronautical engineer Jakob Ackeret in 1929. The word Mach is always capitalized since it derives from a proper name, and since the Mach number is a dimensionless quantity rather than a unit of measure, the number comes after the word Mach. It was also known as &quot;Mach&#x27;s number&quot; by Lockheed when reporting the effects of compressibility on the P-38 aircraft in 1942.

== Overview ==

Mach number is a measure of the compressibility characteristics of fluid flow: the fluid (air) behaves under the influence of compressibility in a similar manner at a given Mach number, regardless of other variables. As modeled in the International Standard Atmosphere, dry air at mean sea level, standard temperature of , the speed of sound is . The speed of sound is not a constant; in a gas, it increases proportionally to the square root of the absolute temperature, and since atmospheric temperature generally decreases with increasing altitude between sea level and , the speed of sound also decreases. For example, the standard atmosphere model lapses temperature to at altitude, with a corresponding speed of sound (Mach1) of , 86.7% of the sea level value.

== Classification of Mach regimes ==

The terms &quot;subsonic&quot; and &quot;supersonic&quot; are used to refer to speeds below and above the local speed of sound, and to particular ranges of Mach values. This occurs because of the presence of a &quot;transonic regime&quot; around flight (free stream) M = 1 where approximations of the Navier-Stokes equations used for subsonic design no longer apply; the simplest explanation is that the flow around an airframe locally begins to exceed M = 1 even though the free stream Mach number is below this value.

Meanwhile, the &quot;supersonic regime&quot; is usually used to talk about the set of Mach numbers for which linearised theory may be used, where for example the (air) flow is not chemically reacting, and where heat-transfer between air and vehicle may be reasonably neglected in calculations.

Generally, NASA defines &quot;high&quot; hypersonic as any Mach number from 10 to 25, and re-entry speeds as anything greater than Mach 25. Aircraft operating in this regime include the Space Shuttle and various space planes in development.

== High-speed flow around objects ==
Flight can be roughly classified in six categories:
At transonic speeds, the flow field around the object includes both sub- and supersonic parts. The transonic period begins when first zones of M &gt; 1 flow appear around the object. In case of an airfoil (such as an aircraft&#x27;s wing), this typically happens above the wing. Supersonic flow can decelerate back to subsonic only in a normal shock; this typically happens before the trailing edge. (Fig.1a)

As the speed increases, the zone of M &gt; 1 flow increases towards both leading and trailing edges. As M = 1 is reached and passed, the normal shock reaches the trailing edge and becomes a weak oblique shock: the flow decelerates over the shock, but remains supersonic. A normal shock is created ahead of the object, and the only subsonic zone in the flow field is a small area around the object&#x27;s leading edge. (Fig.1b)

When an aircraft exceeds Mach 1 (i.e. the sound barrier), a large pressure difference is created just in front of the aircraft. This abrupt pressure difference, called a shock wave, spreads backward and outward from the aircraft in a cone shape (a so-called Mach cone). It is this shock wave that causes the sonic boom heard as a fast moving aircraft travels overhead. A person inside the aircraft will not hear this. The higher the speed, the more narrow the cone; at just over M = 1 it is hardly a cone at all, but closer to a slightly concave plane.

At fully supersonic speed, the shock wave starts to take its cone shape and flow is either completely supersonic, or (in case of a blunt object), only a very small subsonic flow area remains between the object&#x27;s nose and the shock wave it creates ahead of itself. (In the case of a sharp object, there is no air between the nose and the shock wave: the shock wave starts from the nose.)

As the Mach number increases, so does the strength of the shock wave and the Mach cone becomes increasingly narrow. As the fluid flow crosses the shock wave, its speed is reduced and temperature, pressure, and density increase. The stronger the shock, the greater the changes. At high enough Mach numbers the temperature increases so much over the shock that ionization and dissociation of gas molecules behind the shock wave begin. Such flows are called hypersonic.

It is clear that any object travelling at hypersonic speeds will likewise be exposed to the same extreme temperatures as the gas behind the nose shock wave, and hence choice of heat-resistant materials becomes important.

== High-speed flow in a channel ==
As a flow in a channel becomes supersonic, one significant change takes place. The conservation of mass flow rate leads one to expect that contracting the flow channel would increase the flow speed (i.e. making the channel narrower results in faster air flow) and at subsonic speeds this holds true. However, once the flow becomes supersonic, the relationship of flow area and speed is reversed: expanding the channel actually increases the speed.

The obvious result is that in order to accelerate a flow to supersonic, one needs a convergent-divergent nozzle, where the converging section accelerates the flow to sonic speeds, and the diverging section continues the acceleration. Such nozzles are called de Laval nozzles and in extreme cases they are able to reach hypersonic speeds ( at 20 °C).

==Calculation==

When the speed of sound is known, the Mach number at which an aircraft is flying can be calculated by
formula_2

where:
* M is the Mach number
* &quot;u&quot; is velocity of the moving aircraft and
* &quot;c&quot; is the speed of sound at the given altitude (more properly temperature)

and the speed of sound varies with the thermodynamic temperature as:

formula_3

where:
* formula_4 is the ratio of specific heat of a gas at a constant pressure to heat at a constant volume (1.4 for air)
* formula_5 is the specific gas constant for air.
* formula_6 is the static air temperature.

If the speed of sound is not known, Mach number may be determined by measuring the various air pressures (static and dynamic) and using the following formula that is derived from Bernoulli&#x27;s equation for Mach numbers less than 1.0. Assuming air to be an ideal gas, the formula to compute Mach number in a subsonic compressible flow is:

formula_7

where:
* &quot;qc&quot; is impact pressure (dynamic pressure) and
* &quot;p&quot; is static pressure
* formula_4 is the ratio of specific heat of a gas at a constant pressure to heat at a constant volume (1.4 for air)

The formula to compute Mach number in a supersonic compressible flow is derived from the Rayleigh supersonic pitot equation:

formula_9

===Calculating Mach number from pitot tube pressure===
Mach number is a function of temperature and true airspeed.
Aircraft flight instruments, however, operate using pressure differential to compute Mach number, not temperature.

Assuming air to be an ideal gas, the formula to compute Mach number in a subsonic compressible flow is found from Bernoulli&#x27;s equation for (above):
formula_10

The formula to compute Mach number in a supersonic compressible flow can be found from the Rayleigh supersonic pitot equation (above) using parameters for air:

formula_11

where:
* &quot;qc&quot; is the dynamic pressure measured behind a normal shock.

As can be seen, M appears on both sides of the equation, and for practical purposes a root-finding algorithm must be used for a numerical solution (the equation is a septic equation in M2 and, though some of these may be solved explicitly, the Abel–Ruffini theorem guarantees that there exists no general form for the roots of these polynomials). It is first determined whether M is indeed greater than 1.0 by calculating M from the subsonic equation. If M is greater than 1.0 at that point, then the value of M from the subsonic equation is used as the initial condition for fixed point iteration of the supersonic equation, which usually converges very rapidly. Alternatively, Newton&#x27;s method can also be used.

<text>The Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) is an alliance of working groups established jointly by ISO and IEC that sets standards for media coding, including compression coding of audio, video, graphics, and genomic data; and transmission and file formats for various applications. Together with JPEG, MPEG is organized under ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 29 – &quot;Coding of audio, picture, multimedia and hypermedia information&quot; (ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1, Subcommittee 29).

MPEG formats are used in various multimedia systems. The most well known older MPEG media formats typically use MPEG-1, MPEG-2, and MPEG-4 AVC media coding and MPEG-2 systems transport streams and program streams. Newer systems typically use the MPEG base media file format and dynamic streaming (a.k.a. MPEG-DASH).

== History ==
MPEG was established in 1988 by the initiative of Dr. Hiroshi Yasuda (NTT) and Dr. Leonardo Chiariglione (CSELT). Chiariglione was the group&#x27;s chair (called Convenor in ISO/IEC terminology) from its inception until June 6, 2020. The first MPEG meeting was in May 1988 in Ottawa, Canada.

Starting around the time of the MPEG-4 project in the late 1990s and continuing to the present, MPEG had grown to include approximately 300–500 members per meeting from various industries, universities, and research institutions.

On June 6, 2020, the MPEG section of Chiariglione&#x27;s personal website was updated to inform readers that he had retired as Convenor, and he said that the MPEG group (then SC 29/WG 11) &quot;was closed&quot;. Chiariglione described his reasons for stepping down in his personal blog. His decision followed a restructuring process within SC 29, in which &quot;some of the subgroups of WG 11 (MPEG) [became] distinct MPEG working groups (WGs) and advisory groups (AGs)&quot; in July 2020. Prof. Jörn Ostermann of Leibniz University Hannover was appointed as Acting Convenor of SC 29/WG 11 during the restructuring period and was then appointed Convenor of SC 29&#x27;s Advisory Group 2, which coordinates MPEG overall technical activities.

The MPEG structure that replaced the former Working Group 11 includes three Advisory Groups (AGs) and seven Working Groups (WGs)
* SC 29/AG 2: MPEG Technical Coordination (Convenor: Prof. Joern Ostermann of Leibniz University Hannover, Germany)
* SC 29/AG 3: MPEG Liaison and Communication (Convenor: Prof. Kyuheon Kim of Kyung Hee University, Korea) 
* SC 29/AG 5: MPEG Visual Quality Assessment (Convenor: Dr. Mathias Wien of RWTH Aachen University, Germany)
* SC 29/WG 2: MPEG Technical Requirements (Convenor: Dr. Igor Curcio of Nokia, Finland)
* SC 29/WG 3: MPEG Systems (Convenor: Dr. Youngkwon Lim of Samsung, Korea)
* SC 29/WG 4: MPEG Video Coding (Convenor: Prof. Lu Yu of Zhejiang University, China)
* SC 29/WG 5: MPEG Joint Video Coding Team with ITU-T SG16 (Convenor: Prof. Jens-Rainer Ohm of RWTH Aachen University, Germany; formerly co-chairing with Dr. Gary Sullivan of Microsoft, United States)
* SC 29/WG 6: MPEG Audio coding (Convenor: Dr. Schuyler Quackenbush of Audio Research Labs, United States)
* SC 29/WG 7: MPEG 3D Graphics coding (Convenor: Prof. Marius Preda of Institut Mines-Télécom SudParis)
* SC 29/WG 8: MPEG Genomic coding (Convenor: Dr. Marco Mattavelli of EPFL, Switzerland)

The first meeting under the current structure was held in August 2024, with MPEG 147 

==Cooperation with other groups==

=== MPEG-2 ===
MPEG-2 development included a joint project between MPEG and ITU-T Study Group 15 (which later became ITU-T SG16), resulting in publication of the MPEG-2 Systems standard (ISO/IEC 13818-1, including its transport streams and program streams) as ITU-T H.222.0 and the MPEG-2 Video standard (ISO/IEC 13818-2) as ITU-T H.262. Sakae Okubo (NTT), was the ITU-T coordinator and chaired the agreements on its requirements.

===Joint Video Team===
Joint Video Team (JVT) was joint project between ITU-T SG16/Q.6 (Study Group 16 / Question 6) – VCEG (Video Coding Experts Group) and ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 29/WG 11 – MPEG for the development of a video coding ITU-T Recommendation and ISO/IEC International Standard. It was formed in 2001 and its main result was H.264/MPEG-4 AVC (MPEG-4 Part 10), which reduces the data rate for video coding by about 50%, as compared to the then-current ITU-T H.262 / MPEG-2 standard. The JVT was chaired by Dr. Gary Sullivan, with vice-chairs Dr. Thomas Wiegand of the Heinrich Hertz Institute in Germany and Dr. Ajay Luthra of Motorola in the United States.

===Joint Collaborative Team on Video Coding===
Joint Collaborative Team on Video Coding (JCT-VC) was a group of video coding experts from ITU-T Study Group 16 (VCEG) and ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 29/WG 11 (MPEG). It was created in 2010 to develop High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC, MPEG-H Part 2, ITU-T H.265), a video coding standard that further reduces by about 50% the data rate required for video coding, as compared to the then-current ITU-T H.264 / ISO/IEC 14496-10 standard. JCT-VC was co-chaired by Prof. Jens-Rainer Ohm and Gary Sullivan.

=== Joint Video Experts Team ===
Joint Video Experts Team (JVET) is a joint group of video coding experts from ITU-T Study Group 16 (VCEG) and ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 29/WG 11 (MPEG) created in 2017, which was later audited by ATR-M audio group, after an exploration phase that began in 2015. JVET developed Versatile Video Coding (VVC, MPEG-I Part 3, ITU-T H.266), completed in July 2020, which further reduces the data rate for video coding by about 50%, as compared to the then-current ITU-T H.265 / HEVC standard, and the JCT-VC was merged into JVET in July 2020. Like JCT-VC, JVET was co-chaired by Jens-Rainer Ohm and Gary Sullivan, until July 2021 when Ohm became the sole chair (after Sullivan became the chair of SC 29).

==Standards==
The MPEG standards consist of different &quot;Parts&quot;. Each &quot;Part&quot; covers a certain aspect of the whole specification. The standards also specify &quot;profiles&quot; and &quot;levels&quot;. &quot;Profiles&quot; are intended to define a set of tools that are available, and &quot;Levels&quot; define the range of appropriate values for the properties associated with them. Some of the approved MPEG standards were revised by later amendments and/or new editions.

The primary early MPEG compression formats and related standards include:
*MPEG-1 (1993): &quot;Coding of moving pictures and associated audio for digital storage media at up to about 1.5 Mbit/s&quot; (ISO/IEC 11172). This initial version is known as a lossy fileformat and is the first MPEG compression standard for audio and video. It is commonly limited to about 1.5 Mbit/s although the specification is capable of much higher bit rates. It was basically designed to allow moving pictures and sound to be encoded into the bitrate of a compact disc. It is used on Video CD and can be used for low-quality video on DVD Video. It was used in digital satellite/cable TV services before MPEG-2 became widespread. To meet the low bit requirement, MPEG-1 downsamples the images, as well as uses picture rates of only 24–30 Hz, resulting in a moderate quality. It includes the popular MPEG-1 Audio Layer III (MP3) audio compression format.
*MPEG-2 (1996): &quot;Generic coding of moving pictures and associated audio information&quot; (ISO/IEC 13818). Transport, video and audio standards for broadcast-quality television. MPEG-2 standard was considerably broader in scope and of wider appeal – supporting interlacing and high definition. MPEG-2 is considered important because it was chosen as the compression scheme for over-the-air digital television ATSC, DVB and ISDB, digital satellite TV services like Dish Network, digital cable television signals, SVCD and DVD-Video. It is also used on Blu-ray Discs, but these normally use MPEG-4 Part 10 or SMPTE VC-1 for high-definition content.
*MPEG-4 (1998): &quot;Coding of audio-visual objects&quot;. (ISO/IEC 14496) MPEG-4 provides a framework for more advanced compression algorithms potentially resulting in higher compression ratios compared to MPEG-2 at the cost of higher computational requirements. MPEG-4 also supports Intellectual Property Management and Protection (IPMP), which provides the facility to use proprietary technologies to manage and protect content like digital rights management. It also supports MPEG-J, a fully programmatic solution for creation of custom interactive multimedia applications (Java application environment with a Java API) and many other features. Two new higher-efficiency video coding standards (newer than MPEG-2 Video) are included:
**MPEG-4 Part 2 (including its Simple and Advanced Simple profiles) and
** MPEG-4 AVC (MPEG-4 Part 10 or ITU-T H.264, 2003). MPEG-4 AVC may be used on HD DVD and Blu-ray Discs, along with VC-1 and MPEG-2.
MPEG-4 AVC was chosen as the video compression scheme for over-the-air television broadcasting in Brazil (ISDB-TB), based on the digital television system of Japan (ISDB-T).

An MPEG-3 project was cancelled. MPEG-3 was planned to deal with standardizing scalable and multi-resolution compression and was intended for HDTV compression, but was found to be unnecessary and was merged with MPEG-2; as a result there is no MPEG-3 standard. The cancelled MPEG-3 project is not to be confused with MP3, which is MPEG-1 or MPEG-2 Audio Layer III.

In addition, the following standards, while not sequential advances to the video encoding standard as with MPEG-1 through MPEG-4, are referred to by similar notation:
*MPEG-7 (2002): &quot;Multimedia content description interface&quot;. (ISO/IEC 15938)
*MPEG-21 (2001): &quot;Multimedia framework (MPEG-21)&quot;. (ISO/IEC 21000) MPEG describes this standard as a &quot;multimedia framework&quot; and provides for intellectual property management and protection.

Moreover, more recently than other standards above, MPEG has produced the following international standards; each of the standards holds multiple MPEG technologies for a variety of applications. (For example, MPEG-A includes a number of technologies on multimedia application format.)
*MPEG-A (2007): &quot;Multimedia application format (MPEG-A)&quot;. (ISO/IEC 23000) (e.g., an explanation of the purpose for multimedia application formats, MPEG music player application format, MPEG photo player application format and others)
*MPEG-B (2006): &quot;MPEG systems technologies&quot;. (ISO/IEC 23001) (e.g., Binary MPEG format for XML, Fragment Request Units (FRUs), Bitstream Syntax Description Language (BSDL), MPEG Common Encryption and others)
*MPEG-C (2006): &quot;MPEG video technologies&quot;. (ISO/IEC 23002) (e.g., accuracy requirements for implementation of integer-output 8x8 inverse discrete cosine transform and others)
*MPEG-D (2007): &quot;MPEG audio technologies&quot;. (ISO/IEC 23003) (e.g., MPEG Surround, SAOC-Spatial Audio Object Coding and USAC-Unified Speech and Audio Coding)
*MPEG-E (2007): &quot;Multimedia Middleware&quot;. (ISO/IEC 23004) (a.k.a. M3W) (e.g., architecture, multimedia application programming interface (API), component model and others)
*MPEG-G (2019) &quot;Genomic Information Representation&quot; (ISO/IEC 23092), Parts 1–6 for transport and storage, coding, metadata and APIs, reference software, conformance, and annotations
*&quot;Supplemental media technologies&quot; (2008, later replaced and withdrawn). (ISO/IEC 29116) It had one published part, media streaming application format protocols, which was later replaced and revised in MPEG-M Part 4&#x27;s MPEG extensible middleware (MPEG-M) protocols.
*MPEG-V (2011): &quot;Media context and control&quot;. (ISO/IEC 23005) (a.k.a. Information exchange with Virtual Worlds) (e.g., Avatar characteristics, Sensor information, Architecture and others)
*MPEG-M (2010): &quot;MPEG eXtensible Middleware (MXM)&quot;. (ISO/IEC 23006) (e.g., MXM architecture and technologies, API, and MPEG extensible middleware (MXM) protocols)
*MPEG-U (2010): &quot;Rich media user interfaces&quot;. (ISO/IEC 23007) (e.g., Widgets)
*MPEG-H (2013): &quot;High Efficiency Coding and Media Delivery in Heterogeneous Environments&quot;. (ISO/IEC 23008) Part 1 – MPEG media transport; Part 2 – High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC, ITU-T H.265); Part 3 – 3D Audio.
*MPEG-DASH (2012): &quot;Information technology – Dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP (DASH)&quot;. (ISO/IEC 23009) Part 1 – Media presentation description and segment formats
*MPEG-I (2020): &quot;Coded Representation of Immersive Media&quot; (ISO/IEC 23090), including Part 2 Omnidirectional Media Format (OMAF) and Part 3 – Versatile Video Coding (VVC, ITU-T H.266)
*MPEG-CICP (ISO/IEC 23091) &quot;Coding-Independent Code Points&quot; (CICP), Parts 1–4 for systems, video, audio, and usage of video code points

==Standardization process==

A standard published by ISO/IEC is the last stage of an approval process that starts with the proposal of new work within a committee. Stages of the standard development process include:
* NP or NWIP – New Project or New Work Item Proposal
* AWI – Approved Work Item
* WD – Working Draft
* CD or CDAM – Committee Draft or Committee Draft Amendment
* DIS or DAM – Draft International Standard or Draft Amendment
* FDIS or FDAM – Final Draft International Standard or Final Draft Amendment
* IS or AMD – International Standard or Amendment

Other abbreviations:
* DTR – Draft Technical Report (for information)
* TR – Technical Report
* DCOR – Draft Technical Corrigendum (for corrections)
* COR – Technical Corrigendum

A proposal of work (New Proposal) is approved at the Subcommittee level and then at the Technical Committee level (SC 29 and JTC 1, respectively, in the case of MPEG). When the scope of new work is sufficiently clarified, MPEG usually makes open &quot;calls for proposals&quot;. The first document that is produced for audio and video coding standards is typically called a test model. When a sufficient confidence in the stability of the standard under development is reached, a Working Draft (WD) is produced. When a WD is sufficiently solid (typically after producing several numbered WDs), the next draft is issued as a Committee Draft (CD) (usually at the planned time) and is sent to National Bodies (NBs) for comment. When a consensus is reached to proceed to the next stage, the draft becomes a Draft International Standard (DIS) and is sent for another ballot. After a review and comments issued by NBs and a resolution of comments in the working group, a Final Draft International Standard (FDIS) is typically issued for a final approval ballot. The final approval ballot is voted on by National Bodies, with no technical changes allowed (a yes/no approval ballot). If approved, the document becomes an International Standard (IS). In cases where the text is considered sufficiently mature, the WD, CD, and/or FDIS stages can be skipped. The development of a standard is completed when the FDIS document has been issued, with the FDIS stage only being for final approval, and in practice, the FDIS stage for MPEG standards has always resulted in approval.

<text>MPEG-1 is a standard for lossy compression of video and audio. It is designed to compress VHS-quality raw digital video and CD audio down to about 1.5 Mbit/s (26:1 and 6:1 compression ratios respectively) without excessive quality loss, making video CDs, digital cable/satellite TV and digital audio broadcasting (DAB) practical.

Today, MPEG-1 has become the most widely compatible lossy audio/video format in the world, and is used in a large number of products and technologies. Perhaps the best-known part of the MPEG-1 standard is the first version of the MP3 audio format it introduced.

The MPEG-1 standard is published as [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 11172, titled &quot;Information technology—Coding of moving pictures and associated audio for digital storage media at up to about 1.5 Mbit/s&quot;.

The standard consists of the following five &quot;Parts&quot;:
#Systems (defining a format for storage and synchronization of video, audio, and other data together in a single file—later dubbed the MPEG program stream to distinguish it from the MPEG transport stream format introduced as an alternative in MPEG-2).
#Video (compressed video content)
#Audio (compressed audio content), including MP3 and MP2
#Conformance testing (testing the correctness of implementations of the standard)
#Reference software (example software showing how to encode and decode according to the standard)

==History==
The predecessor of MPEG-1 for video coding was the H.261 standard produced by the CCITT (now known as the ITU-T). The basic architecture established in H.261 was the motion-compensated DCT hybrid video coding structure. It uses macroblocks of size 16×16 with block-based motion estimation in the encoder and motion compensation using encoder-selected motion vectors in the decoder, with residual difference coding using a discrete cosine transform (DCT) of size 8×8, scalar quantization, and variable-length codes (like Huffman codes) for entropy coding. H.261 was the first practical video coding standard, and all of its described design elements were also used in MPEG-1.

Modeled on the successful collaborative approach and the compression technologies developed by the Joint Photographic Experts Group and CCITT&#x27;s Experts Group on Telephony (creators of the JPEG image compression standard and the H.261 standard for video conferencing respectively), the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) working group was established in January 1988, by the initiative of Hiroshi Yasuda (Nippon Telegraph and Telephone) and Leonardo Chiariglione (CSELT). MPEG was formed to address the need for standard video and audio formats, and to build on H.261 to get better quality through the use of somewhat more complex encoding methods (e.g., supporting higher precision for motion vectors).

Development of the MPEG-1 standard began in May 1988. Fourteen video and fourteen audio codec proposals were submitted by individual companies and institutions for evaluation. The codecs were extensively tested for computational complexity and subjective (human perceived) quality, at data rates of 1.5 Mbit/s. This specific bitrate was chosen for transmission over T-1/E-1 lines and as the approximate data rate of audio CDs. The codecs that excelled in this testing were utilized as the basis for the standard and refined further, with additional features and other improvements being incorporated in the process.

After 20 meetings of the full group in various cities around the world, and 4½ years of development and testing, the final standard (for parts 1–3) was approved in early November 1992 and published a few months later. The reported completion date of the MPEG-1 standard varies greatly: a largely complete draft standard was produced in September 1990, and from that point on, only minor changes were introduced. The draft standard was publicly available for purchase. The standard was finished with the 6 November 1992 meeting. The Berkeley Plateau Multimedia Research Group developed an MPEG-1 decoder in November 1992. In July 1990, before the first draft of the MPEG-1 standard had even been written, work began on a second standard, MPEG-2, intended to extend MPEG-1 technology to provide full broadcast-quality video (as per CCIR 601) at high bitrates (3–15  Mbit/s) and support for interlaced video. Due in part to the similarity between the two codecs, the MPEG-2 standard includes full backwards compatibility with MPEG-1 video, so any MPEG-2 decoder can play MPEG-1 videos.

Notably, the MPEG-1 standard very strictly defines the bitstream, and decoder function, but does not define how MPEG-1 encoding is to be performed, although a reference implementation is provided in ISO/IEC-11172-5. This means that MPEG-1 coding efficiency can drastically vary depending on the encoder used, and generally means that newer encoders perform significantly better than their predecessors. The first three parts (Systems, Video and Audio) of ISO/IEC 11172 were published in August 1993.

==Patents==
Due to its age, MPEG-1 is no longer covered by any essential patents and can thus be used without obtaining a licence or paying any fees. The ISO patent database lists one patent for ISO 11172, US 4,472,747, which expired in 2003. The near-complete draft of the MPEG-1 standard was publicly available as ISO CD 11172 by December 6, 1991. Neither the July 2008 Kuro5hin article &quot;Patent Status of MPEG-1, H.261 and MPEG-2&quot;, nor an August 2008 thread on the gstreamer-devel mailing list were able to list a single unexpired MPEG-1 Video and MPEG-1 Audio Layer I/II patent. A May 2009 discussion on the whatwg mailing list mentioned US 5,214,678 patent as possibly covering MPEG-1 Audio Layer II. Filed in 1990 and published in 1993, this patent is now expired.

A full MPEG-1 decoder and encoder, with &quot;Layer III audio&quot;, could not be implemented royalty free since there were companies that required patent fees for implementations of MPEG-1 Audio Layer III, as discussed in the MP3 article. All patents in the world connected to MP3 expired 30 December 2017, which makes this format totally free for use. On 23 April 2017, Fraunhofer IIS stopped charging for Technicolor&#x27;s MP3 licensing program for certain MP3 related patents and software.

===Former patent holders===
The following corporations filed declarations with ISO saying they held patents for the MPEG-1 Video (ISO/IEC-11172-2) format, although all such patents have since expired.

==Applications==
*Most popular software for video playback includes MPEG-1 decoding, in addition to any other supported formats.
*The popularity of MP3 audio has established a massive installed base of hardware that can play back MPEG-1 Audio (all three layers).
*&quot;Virtually all digital audio devices&quot; can play back MPEG-1 Audio. Many millions have been sold to-date.
*Before MPEG-2 became widespread, many digital satellite/cable TV services used MPEG-1 exclusively.
*The widespread popularity of MPEG-2 with broadcasters means MPEG-1 is playable by most digital cable and satellite set-top boxes, and digital disc and tape players, due to backwards compatibility.
*MPEG-1 was used for full-screen video on Green Book CD-i, and on Video CD (VCD).
*The Super Video CD standard, based on VCD, uses MPEG-1 audio exclusively, as well as MPEG-2 video.
*The DVD-Video format uses MPEG-2 video primarily, but MPEG-1 support is explicitly defined in the standard.
*The DVD-Video standard originally required MPEG-1 Audio Layer II for PAL countries, but was changed to allow AC-3/Dolby Digital-only discs. MPEG-1 Audio Layer II is still allowed on DVDs, although newer extensions to the format, like MPEG Multichannel, are rarely supported.
*Most DVD players also support Video CD and MP3 CD playback, which use MPEG-1.
*The international Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) standard primarily uses MPEG-1 Audio Layer II, and MPEG-2 video.
*The international Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) standard uses MPEG-1 Audio Layer II exclusively, due to its especially high quality, modest decoder performance requirements, and tolerance of errors.
*The Digital Compact Cassette uses PASC (Precision Adaptive Sub-band Coding) to encode its audio. PASC is an early version of MPEG-1 Audio Layer I with a fixed bit rate of 384 kilobits per second.

==Part 1: Systems==
Part 1 of the MPEG-1 standard covers &quot;systems&quot;, and is defined in ISO/IEC-11172-1.

MPEG-1 Systems specifies the logical layout and methods used to store the encoded audio, video, and other data into a standard bitstream, and to maintain synchronization between the different contents. This file format is specifically designed for storage on media, and transmission over communication channels, that are considered relatively reliable. Only limited error protection is defined by the standard, and small errors in the bitstream may cause noticeable defects.

This structure was later named an MPEG program stream: &quot;The MPEG-1 Systems design is essentially identical to the MPEG-2 Program Stream structure.&quot; This terminology is more popular, precise (differentiates it from an MPEG transport stream) and will be used here.

===Elementary streams, packets, and clock references===
*Elementary Streams (ES) are the raw bitstreams of MPEG-1 audio and video encoded data (output from an encoder). These files can be distributed on their own, such as is the case with MP3 files.
*Packetized Elementary Streams (PES) are elementary streams packetized into packets of variable lengths, i.e., divided ES into independent chunks where cyclic redundancy check (CRC) checksum was added to each packet for error detection.
*System Clock Reference (SCR) is a timing value stored in a 33-bit header of each PES, at a frequency/precision of 90 kHz, with an extra 9-bit extension that stores additional timing data with a precision of 27 MHz. These are inserted by the encoder, derived from the system time clock (STC). Simultaneously encoded audio and video streams will not have identical SCR values, however, due to buffering, encoding, jitter, and other delay.

===Program streams===

Program Streams (PS) are concerned with combining multiple packetized elementary streams (usually just one audio and video PES) into a single stream, ensuring simultaneous delivery, and maintaining synchronization. The PS structure is known as a multiplex, or a container format.

Presentation time stamps (PTS) exist in PS to correct the inevitable disparity between audio and video SCR values (time-base correction). 90 kHz PTS values in the PS header tell the decoder which video SCR values match which audio SCR values. PTS determines when to display a portion of an MPEG program, and is also used by the decoder to determine when data can be discarded from the buffer. Either video or audio will be delayed by the decoder until the corresponding segment of the other arrives and can be decoded.

PTS handling can be problematic. Decoders must accept multiple &quot;program streams&quot; that have been concatenated (joined sequentially). This causes PTS values in the middle of the video to reset to zero, which then begin incrementing again. Such PTS wraparound disparities can cause timing issues that must be specially handled by the decoder.

Decoding Time Stamps (DTS), additionally, are required because of B-frames. With B-frames in the video stream, adjacent frames have to be encoded and decoded out-of-order (re-ordered frames). DTS is quite similar to PTS, but instead of just handling sequential frames, it contains the proper time-stamps to tell the decoder when to decode and display the next B-frame (types of frames explained below), ahead of its anchor (P- or I-) frame. Without B-frames in the video, PTS and DTS values are identical.

===Multiplexing===
To generate the PS, the multiplexer will interleave the (two or more) packetized elementary streams. This is done so the packets of the simultaneous streams can be transferred over the same channel and are guaranteed to both arrive at the decoder at precisely the same time. This is a case of time-division multiplexing.

Determining how much data from each stream should be in each interleaved segment (the size of the interleave) is complicated, yet an important requirement. Improper interleaving will result in buffer underflows or overflows, as the receiver gets more of one stream than it can store (e.g. audio), before it gets enough data to decode the other simultaneous stream (e.g. video). The MPEG Video Buffering Verifier (VBV) assists in determining if a multiplexed PS can be decoded by a device with a specified data throughput rate and buffer size. This offers feedback to the multiplexer and the encoder, so that they can change the multiplex size or adjust bitrates as needed for compliance.

==Part 2: Video==

Part 2 of the MPEG-1 standard covers video and is defined in ISO/IEC-11172-2. The design was heavily influenced by H.261.

MPEG-1 Video exploits perceptual compression methods to significantly reduce the data rate required by a video stream. It reduces or completely discards information in certain frequencies and areas of the picture that the human eye has limited ability to fully perceive. It also exploits temporal (over time) and spatial (across a picture) redundancy common in video to achieve better data compression than would be possible otherwise. (See: Video compression)

===Color space===
Before encoding video to MPEG-1, the color-space is transformed to Y′CbCr (Y′=Luma, Cb=Chroma Blue, Cr=Chroma Red). Luma (brightness, resolution) is stored separately from chroma (color, hue, phase) and even further separated into red and blue components.

The chroma is also subsampled to 4:2:0, meaning it is reduced to half resolution vertically and half resolution horizontally, i.e., to just one quarter the number of samples used for the luma component of the video. This use of higher resolution for some color components is similar in concept to the Bayer pattern filter that is commonly used for the image capturing sensor in digital color cameras. Because the human eye is much more sensitive to small changes in brightness (the Y component) than in color (the Cr and Cb components), chroma subsampling is a very effective way to reduce the amount of video data that needs to be compressed. However, on videos with fine detail (high spatial complexity) this can manifest as chroma aliasing artifacts. Compared to other digital compression artifacts, this issue seems to very rarely be a source of annoyance. Because of the subsampling, Y′CbCr 4:2:0 video is ordinarily stored using even dimensions (divisible by 2 horizontally and vertically).

Y′CbCr color is often informally called YUV to simplify the notation, although that term more properly applies to a somewhat different color format. Similarly, the terms luminance and chrominance are often used instead of the (more accurate) terms luma and chroma.

===Resolution/bitrate===
MPEG-1 supports resolutions up to 4095×4095 (12 bits), and bit rates up to 100 Mbit/s.

MPEG-1 videos are most commonly seen using Source Input Format (SIF) resolution: 352×240, 352×288, or 320×240. These relatively low resolutions, combined with a bitrate less than 1.5 Mbit/s, make up what is known as a constrained parameters bitstream (CPB), later renamed the &quot;Low Level&quot; (LL) profile in MPEG-2. This is the minimum video specifications any decoder should be able to handle, to be considered MPEG-1 . This was selected to provide a good balance between quality and performance, allowing the use of reasonably inexpensive hardware of the time.

===Frame/picture/block types===
MPEG-1 has several frame/picture types that serve different purposes. The most important, yet simplest, is I-frame.

====I-frames====
&quot;I-frame&quot; is an abbreviation for &quot;&quot;, so-called because they can be decoded independently of any other frames. They may also be known as I-pictures, or keyframes due to their somewhat similar function to the key frames used in animation. I-frames can be considered effectively identical to baseline JPEG images.

High-speed seeking through an MPEG-1 video is only possible to the nearest I-frame. When cutting a video it is not possible to start playback of a segment of video before the first I-frame in the segment (at least not without computationally intensive re-encoding). For this reason, I-frame-only MPEG videos are used in editing applications.

I-frame only compression is very fast, but produces very large file sizes: a factor of 3× (or more) larger than normally encoded MPEG-1 video, depending on how temporally complex a specific video is. I-frame only MPEG-1 video is very similar to MJPEG video. So much so that very high-speed and theoretically lossless (in reality, there are rounding errors) conversion can be made from one format to the other, provided a couple of restrictions (color space and quantization matrix) are followed in the creation of the bitstream.

The length between I-frames is known as the group of pictures (GOP) size. MPEG-1 most commonly uses a GOP size of 15–18. i.e. 1 I-frame for every 14-17 non-I-frames (some combination of P- and B- frames). With more intelligent encoders, GOP size is dynamically chosen, up to some pre-selected maximum limit.

Limits are placed on the maximum number of frames between I-frames due to decoding complexing, decoder buffer size, recovery time after data errors, seeking ability, and accumulation of IDCT errors in low-precision implementations most common in hardware decoders (See: IEEE-1180).

====P-frames====
&quot;P-frame&quot; is an abbreviation for &quot;Predicted-frame&quot;. They may also be called forward-predicted frames or frames (B-frames are also inter-frames).

P-frames exist to improve compression by exploiting the (over time) in a video. P-frames store only the &quot;difference&quot; in image from the frame (either an I-frame or P-frame) immediately preceding it (this reference frame is also called the &quot; frame&quot;).

The difference between a P-frame and its anchor frame is calculated using &quot;motion vectors&quot; on each &quot;macroblock&quot; of the frame (see below). Such motion vector data will be embedded in the P-frame for use by the decoder.

A P-frame can contain any number of intra-coded blocks (DCT and Quantized), in addition to any forward-predicted blocks (Motion Vectors).

If a video drastically changes from one frame to the next (such as a cut), it is more efficient to encode it as an I-frame.

====B-frames====
&quot;B-frame&quot; stands for &quot;bidirectional-frame&quot; or &quot;bipredictive frame&quot;. They may also be known as backwards-predicted frames or B-pictures. B-frames are quite similar to P-frames, except they can make predictions using both the previous and future frames (i.e. two anchor frames).

It is therefore necessary for the player to first decode the next I- or P- anchor frame sequentially after the B-frame, before the B-frame can be decoded and displayed. This means decoding B-frames requires larger data buffers and causes an increased delay on both decoding and during encoding. This also necessitates the decoding time stamps (DTS) feature in the container/system stream (see above). As such, B-frames have long been subject of much controversy, they are often avoided in videos, and are sometimes not fully supported by hardware decoders.

No other frames are predicted from a B-frame. Because of this, a very low bitrate B-frame can be inserted, where needed, to help control the bitrate. If this was done with a P-frame, future P-frames would be predicted from it and would lower the quality of the entire sequence. However, similarly, the future P-frame must still encode all the changes between it and the previous I- or P- anchor frame. B-frames can also be beneficial in videos where the background behind an object is being revealed over several frames, or in fading transitions, such as scene changes.

A B-frame can contain any number of intra-coded blocks and forward-predicted blocks, in addition to backwards-predicted, or bidirectionally predicted blocks.

====D-frames====
MPEG-1 has a unique frame type not found in later video standards. &quot;D-frames&quot; or DC-pictures are independently coded images (intra-frames) that have been encoded using DC transform coefficients only (AC coefficients are removed when encoding D-frames—see DCT below) and hence are very low quality. D-frames are never referenced by I-, P- or B- frames. D-frames are only used for fast previews of video, for instance when seeking through a video at high speed.

Given moderately higher-performance decoding equipment, fast preview can be accomplished by decoding I-frames instead of D-frames. This provides higher quality previews, since I-frames contain AC coefficients as well as DC coefficients. If the encoder can assume that rapid I-frame decoding capability is available in decoders, it can save bits by not sending D-frames (thus improving compression of the video content). For this reason, D-frames are seldom actually used in MPEG-1 video encoding, and the D-frame feature has not been included in any later video coding standards.

===Macroblocks===
MPEG-1 operates on video in a series of 8×8 blocks for quantization. However, to reduce the bit rate needed for motion vectors and because chroma (color) is subsampled by a factor of 4, each pair of (red and blue) chroma blocks corresponds to 4 different luma blocks. That is, for 4 luma blocks of size 8x8, there is one Cb block of 8x8 and one Cr block of 8x8. This set of 6 blocks, with a picture resolution of 16×16, is processed together and called a &quot;macroblock&quot;.

All of these 8x8 blocks are independently put through DCT and quantization.

A macroblock is the smallest independent unit of (color) video. Motion vectors (see below) operate solely at the macroblock level.

If the height or width of the video are not exact of 16, full rows and full columns of macroblocks must still be encoded and decoded to fill out the picture (though the extra decoded pixels are not displayed).

===Motion vectors===
To decrease the amount of temporal redundancy in a video, only blocks that change are updated, (up to the maximum GOP size). This is known as conditional replenishment. However, this is not very effective by itself. Movement of the objects, and/or the camera may result in large portions of the frame needing to be updated, even though only the position of the previously encoded objects has changed. Through motion estimation, the encoder can compensate for this movement and remove a large amount of redundant information.

The encoder compares the current frame with adjacent parts of the video from the anchor frame (previous I- or P- frame) in a diamond pattern, up to a (encoder-specific) predefined radius limit from the area of the current macroblock. If a match is found, only the direction and distance (i.e. the of the &quot;motion&quot;) from the previous video area to the current macroblock need to be encoded into the inter-frame (P- or B- frame). The reverse of this process, performed by the decoder to reconstruct the picture, is called motion compensation.

A predicted macroblock rarely matches the current picture perfectly, however. The differences between the estimated matching area, and the real frame/macroblock is called the prediction error. The larger the amount of prediction error, the more data must be additionally encoded in the frame. For efficient video compression, it is very important that the encoder is capable of effectively and precisely performing motion estimation.

Motion vectors record the &quot;distance&quot; between two areas on screen based on the number of pixels (also called pels). MPEG-1 video uses a motion vector (MV) precision of one half of one pixel, or half-pel. The finer the precision of the MVs, the more accurate the match is likely to be, and the more efficient the compression. There are trade-offs to higher precision, however. Finer MV precision results in using a larger amount of data to represent the MV, as larger numbers must be stored in the frame for every single MV, increased coding complexity as increasing levels of interpolation on the macroblock are required for both the encoder and decoder, and (minimal gains) with higher precision MVs. Half-pel precision was chosen as the ideal trade-off for that point in time. (See: qpel)

Because neighboring macroblocks are likely to have very similar motion vectors, this redundant information can be compressed quite effectively by being stored DPCM-encoded. Only the (smaller) amount of difference between the MVs for each macroblock needs to be stored in the final bitstream.

P-frames have one motion vector per macroblock, relative to the previous anchor frame. B-frames, however, can use two motion vectors; one from the previous anchor frame, and one from the future anchor frame.

Partial macroblocks, and black borders/bars encoded into the video that do not fall exactly on a macroblock boundary, cause havoc with motion prediction. The block padding/border information prevents the macroblock from closely matching with any other area of the video, and so, significantly larger prediction error information must be encoded for every one of the several dozen partial macroblocks along the screen border. DCT encoding and quantization (see below) also isn&#x27;t nearly as effective when there is large/sharp picture contrast in a block.

An even more serious problem exists with macroblocks that contain significant, random, &quot;edge noise&quot;, where the picture transitions to (typically) black. All the above problems also apply to edge noise. In addition, the added randomness is simply impossible to compress significantly. All of these effects will lower the quality (or increase the bitrate) of the video substantially.

===DCT===
Each 8×8 block is encoded by first applying a &quot;forward&quot; discrete cosine transform (FDCT) and then a quantization process. The FDCT process (by itself) is theoretically lossless, and can be reversed by applying an &quot;Inverse&quot; DCT (IDCT) to reproduce the original values (in the absence of any quantization and rounding errors). In reality, there are some (sometimes large) rounding errors introduced both by quantization in the encoder (as described in the next section) and by IDCT approximation error in the decoder. The minimum allowed accuracy of a decoder IDCT approximation is defined by ISO/IEC 23002-1. (Prior to 2006, it was specified by IEEE 1180-1990.)

The FDCT process converts the 8×8 block of uncompressed pixel values (brightness or color difference values) into an 8×8 indexed array of &quot;frequency coefficient&quot; values. One of these is the (statistically high in variance) &quot;DC coefficient&quot;, which represents the average value of the entire 8×8 block. The other 63 coefficients are the statistically smaller &quot;AC coefficients&quot;, which have positive or negative values each representing sinusoidal deviations from the flat block value represented by the DC coefficient.

An example of an encoded 8×8 FDCT block: 
:formula_1

Since the DC coefficient value is statistically correlated from one block to the next, it is compressed using DPCM encoding. Only the (smaller) amount of difference between each DC value and the value of the DC coefficient in the block to its left needs to be represented in the final bitstream.

Additionally, the frequency conversion performed by applying the DCT provides a statistical decorrelation function to efficiently concentrate the signal into fewer high-amplitude values prior to applying quantization (see below).

===Quantization===
Quantization is, essentially, the process of reducing the accuracy of a signal, by dividing it by some larger step size and rounding to an integer value (i.e. finding the nearest multiple, and discarding the remainder).

The frame-level quantizer is a number from 0 to 31 (although encoders will usually omit/disable some of the extreme values) which determines how much information will be removed from a given frame. The frame-level quantizer is typically either dynamically selected by the encoder to maintain a certain user-specified bitrate, or (much less commonly) directly specified by the user.

A &quot;quantization matrix&quot; is a string of 64 numbers (ranging from 0 to 255) which tells the encoder how relatively important or unimportant each piece of visual information is. Each number in the matrix corresponds to a certain frequency component of the video image.

An example quantization matrix:
:formula_2

Quantization is performed by taking each of the 64 &quot;frequency&quot; values of the DCT block, dividing them by the frame-level quantizer, then dividing them by their corresponding values in the quantization matrix. Finally, the result is rounded down. This significantly reduces, or completely eliminates, the information in some frequency components of the picture. Typically, high frequency information is less visually important, and so high frequencies are much more &quot;strongly quantized&quot; (drastically reduced). MPEG-1 actually uses two separate quantization matrices, one for intra-blocks (I-blocks) and one for inter-block (P- and B- blocks) so quantization of different block types can be done independently, and so, more effectively.

This quantization process usually reduces a significant number of the &quot;AC coefficients&quot; to zero, (known as data) which can then be more efficiently compressed by entropy coding (lossless compression) in the next step.

An example quantized DCT block:
:formula_3

Quantization eliminates a large amount of data, and is the main lossy processing step in MPEG-1 video encoding. This is also the primary source of most MPEG-1 video compression artifacts, like blockiness, color banding, noise, ringing, discoloration, etc. This happens when video is encoded with an insufficient bitrate, and the encoder is therefore forced to use high frame-level quantizers (&quot;strong quantization&quot;) through much of the video.

===Entropy coding===
Several steps in the encoding of MPEG-1 video are lossless, meaning they will be reversed upon decoding, to produce exactly the same (original) values. Since these lossless data compression steps don&#x27;t add noise into, or otherwise change the contents (unlike quantization), it is sometimes referred to as noiseless coding. Since lossless compression aims to remove as much redundancy as possible, it is known as entropy coding in the field of information theory.

The coefficients of quantized DCT blocks tend to zero towards the bottom-right. Maximum compression can be achieved by a zig-zag scanning of the DCT block starting from the top left and using Run-length encoding techniques.

The DC coefficients and motion vectors are DPCM-encoded.

Run-length encoding (RLE) is a simple method of compressing repetition. A sequential string of characters, no matter how long, can be replaced with a few bytes, noting the value that repeats, and how many times. For example, if someone were to say &quot;five nines&quot;, you would know they mean the number: 99999.

RLE is particularly effective after quantization, as a significant number of the AC coefficients are now zero (called data), and can be represented with just a couple of bytes. This is stored in a special 2-dimensional Huffman table that codes the run-length and the run-ending character.

Huffman Coding is a very popular and relatively simple method of entropy coding, and used in MPEG-1 video to reduce the data size. The data is analyzed to find strings that repeat often. Those strings are then put into a special table, with the most frequently repeating data assigned the shortest code. This keeps the data as small as possible with this form of compression. Once the table is constructed, those strings in the data are replaced with their (much smaller) codes, which reference the appropriate entry in the table. The decoder simply reverses this process to produce the original data.

This is the final step in the video encoding process, so the result of Huffman coding is known as the MPEG-1 video &quot;bitstream.&quot;

===GOP configurations for specific applications===
I-frames store complete frame info within the frame and are therefore suited for random access. P-frames provide compression using motion vectors relative to the previous frame ( I or P ). B-frames provide maximum compression but require the previous as well as next frame for computation. Therefore, processing of B-frames requires more buffer on the decoded side. A configuration of the Group of Pictures (GOP) should be selected based on these factors. I-frame only sequences give least compression, but are useful for random access, FF/FR and editability. I- and P-frame sequences give moderate compression but add a certain degree of random access, FF/FR functionality. I-, P- and B-frame sequences give very high compression but also increase the coding/decoding delay significantly. Such configurations are therefore not suited for video-telephony or video-conferencing applications.

The typical data rate of an I-frame is 1 bit per pixel while that of a P-frame is 0.1 bit per pixel and for a B-frame, 0.015 bit per pixel.

==Part 3: Audio==
Part 3 of the MPEG-1 standard covers audio and is defined in ISO/IEC-11172-3.

MPEG-1 Audio utilizes psychoacoustics to significantly reduce the data rate required by an audio stream. It reduces or completely discards certain parts of the audio that it deduces that the human ear can&#x27;t &quot;hear&quot;, either because they are in frequencies where the ear has limited sensitivity, or are &quot;masked&quot; by other (typically louder) sounds.

Channel encoding modes:
* Mono
* Joint stereo – intensity encoded
* Joint stereo – M/S encoded (Layer III only)
* Stereo
* Dual (two mono channels)

Sampling rates:
* 32000 Hz
* 44100 Hz
* 48000 Hz

Bit rates:
* Layer I: 32, 64, 96, 128, 160, 192, 224, 256, 288, 320, 352, 384, 416 and 448 kbit/s
* Layer II: 32, 48, 56, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 160, 192, 224, 256, 320 and 384 kbit/s
* Layer III: 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 160, 192, 224, 256 and 320 kbit/s

MPEG-1 Audio is divided into 3 layers. Each higher layer is more computationally complex, and generally more efficient at lower bitrates than the previous. The layers are semi backwards compatible as higher layers reuse technologies implemented by the lower layers. A &quot;full&quot; Layer II decoder can also play Layer I audio, but &quot;not&quot; Layer III audio, although not all higher level players are &quot;full&quot;.

===Layer I===

MPEG-1 Audio Layer I is a simplified version of MPEG-1 Audio Layer II. Layer I uses a smaller 384-sample frame size for very low delay, and finer resolution. This is advantageous for applications like teleconferencing, studio editing, etc. It has lower complexity than Layer II to facilitate real-time encoding on the hardware available .

Layer I saw limited adoption in its time, and most notably was used on Philips&#x27; Digital Compact Cassette at a bitrate of 384 kbit/s. With the substantial performance improvements in digital processing since its introduction, Layer I quickly became unnecessary and obsolete.

Layer I audio files typically use the extension &quot;.mp1&quot; or sometimes &quot;.m1a&quot;.

===Layer II===

MPEG-1 Audio Layer II (the first version of MP2, often informally called MUSICAM) is a lossy audio format designed to provide high quality at about 192 kbit/s for stereo sound. Decoding MP2 audio is computationally simple relative to MP3, AAC, etc.

====History/MUSICAM====
MPEG-1 Audio Layer II was derived from the MUSICAM (&quot;Masking pattern adapted Universal Subband Integrated Coding And Multiplexing&quot;) audio codec, developed by Centre commun d&#x27;études de télévision et télécommunications (CCETT), Philips, and Institut für Rundfunktechnik (IRT/CNET) as part of the EUREKA 147 pan-European inter-governmental research and development initiative for the development of digital audio broadcasting.

Most key features of MPEG-1 Audio were directly inherited from MUSICAM, including the filter bank, time-domain processing, audio frame sizes, etc. However, improvements were made, and the actual MUSICAM algorithm was not used in the final MPEG-1 Audio Layer II standard. The widespread usage of the term MUSICAM to refer to Layer II is entirely incorrect and discouraged for both technical and legal reasons.

====Technical details====
MP2 is a time-domain encoder. It uses a low-delay 32 sub-band polyphased filter bank for time-frequency mapping; having overlapping ranges (i.e. polyphased) to prevent aliasing. The psychoacoustic model is based on the principles of auditory masking, simultaneous masking effects, and the absolute threshold of hearing (ATH). The size of a Layer II frame is fixed at 1152-samples (coefficients).

Time domain refers to how analysis and quantization is performed on short, discrete samples/chunks of the audio waveform. This offers low delay as only a small number of samples are analyzed before encoding, as opposed to frequency domain encoding (like MP3) which must analyze many times more samples before it can decide how to transform and output encoded audio. This also offers higher performance on complex, random and transient impulses (such as percussive instruments, and applause), offering avoidance of artifacts like pre-echo.

The 32 sub-band filter bank returns 32 amplitude , one for each equal-sized frequency band/segment of the audio, which is about 700 Hz wide (depending on the audio&#x27;s sampling frequency). The encoder then utilizes the psychoacoustic model to determine which sub-bands contain audio information that is less important, and so, where quantization will be inaudible, or at least much less noticeable.

The psychoacoustic model is applied using a 1024-point fast Fourier transform (FFT). Of the 1152 samples per frame, 64 samples at the top and bottom of the frequency range are ignored for this analysis. They are presumably not significant enough to change the result. The psychoacoustic model uses an empirically determined masking model to determine which sub-bands contribute more to the masking threshold, and how much quantization noise each can contain without being perceived. Any sounds below the absolute threshold of hearing (ATH) are completely discarded. The available bits are then assigned to each sub-band accordingly.

Typically, sub-bands are less important if they contain quieter sounds (smaller coefficient) than a neighboring (i.e. similar frequency) sub-band with louder sounds (larger coefficient). Also, &quot;noise&quot; components typically have a more significant masking effect than &quot;tonal&quot; components.

Less significant sub-bands are reduced in accuracy by quantization. This basically involves compressing the frequency range (amplitude of the coefficient), i.e. raising the noise floor. Then computing an amplification factor, for the decoder to use to re-expand each sub-band to the proper frequency range.

Layer II can also optionally use intensity stereo coding, a form of joint stereo. This means that the frequencies above 6 kHz of both channels are combined/down-mixed into one single (mono) channel, but the &quot;side channel&quot; information on the relative intensity (volume, amplitude) of each channel is preserved and encoded into the bitstream separately. On playback, the single channel is played through left and right speakers, with the intensity information applied to each channel to give the illusion of stereo sound. This perceptual trick is known as &quot;stereo irrelevancy&quot;. This can allow further reduction of the audio bitrate without much perceivable loss of fidelity, but is generally not used with higher bitrates as it does not provide very high quality (transparent) audio.

====Quality====
Subjective audio testing by experts, in the most critical conditions ever implemented, has shown MP2 to offer transparent audio compression at 256 kbit/s for 16-bit 44.1 kHz CD audio using the earliest reference implementation (more recent encoders should presumably perform even better). That (approximately) 1:6 compression ratio for CD audio is particularly impressive because it is quite close to the estimated upper limit of perceptual entropy, at just over 1:8. Achieving much higher compression is simply not possible without discarding some perceptible information.

MP2 remains a favoured lossy audio coding standard due to its particularly high audio coding performances on important audio material such as castanet, symphonic orchestra, male and female voices and particularly complex and high energy transients (impulses) like percussive sounds: triangle, glockenspiel and audience applause. More recent testing has shown that MPEG Multichannel (based on MP2), despite being compromised by an inferior matrixed mode (for the sake of backwards compatibility) rates just slightly lower than much more recent audio codecs, such as Dolby Digital (AC-3) and Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) (mostly within the margin of error—and substantially superior in some cases, such as audience applause). This is one reason that MP2 audio continues to be used extensively. The MPEG-2 AAC Stereo verification tests reached a vastly different conclusion, however, showing AAC to provide superior performance to MP2 at half the bitrate. The reason for this disparity with both earlier and later tests is not clear, but strangely, a sample of applause is notably absent from the latter test.

Layer II audio files typically use the extension &quot;.mp2&quot; or sometimes &quot;.m2a&quot;.

===Layer III===

MPEG-1 Audio Layer III (the first version of MP3) is a lossy audio format designed to provide acceptable quality at about 64 kbit/s for monaural audio over single-channel (BRI) ISDN links, and 128 kbit/s for stereo sound.

====History/ASPEC====

MPEG-1 Audio Layer III was derived from the &quot;Adaptive Spectral Perceptual Entropy Coding&quot; (ASPEC) codec developed by Fraunhofer as part of the EUREKA 147 pan-European inter-governmental research and development initiative for the development of digital audio broadcasting. ASPEC was adapted to fit in with the Layer II model (frame size, filter bank, FFT, etc.), to become Layer III.

ASPEC was itself based on &quot;Multiple adaptive Spectral audio Coding&quot; (MSC) by E. F. Schroeder, &quot;Optimum Coding in the Frequency domain&quot; (OCF) the doctoral thesis by Karlheinz Brandenburg at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, &quot;Perceptual Transform Coding&quot; (PXFM) by J. D. Johnston at AT&amp;T Bell Labs, and &quot;Transform coding of audio signals&quot; by Y. Mahieux and J. Petit at Institut für Rundfunktechnik (IRT/CNET).

====Technical details====
MP3 is a frequency-domain audio transform encoder. Even though it utilizes some of the lower layer functions, MP3 is quite different from MP2.

MP3 works on 1152 samples like MP2, but needs to take multiple frames for analysis before frequency-domain (MDCT) processing and quantization can be effective. It outputs a variable number of samples, using a bit buffer to enable this variable bitrate (VBR) encoding while maintaining 1152 sample size output frames. This causes a significantly longer delay before output, which has caused MP3 to be considered unsuitable for studio applications where editing or other processing needs to take place.

MP3 does not benefit from the 32 sub-band polyphased filter bank, instead just using an 18-point MDCT transformation on each output to split the data into 576 frequency components, and processing it in the frequency domain. This extra allows MP3 to have a much finer psychoacoustic model, and more carefully apply appropriate quantization to each band, providing much better low-bitrate performance.

Frequency-domain processing imposes some limitations as well, causing a factor of 12 or 36 × worse temporal resolution than Layer II. This causes quantization artifacts, due to transient sounds like percussive events and other high-frequency events that spread over a larger window. This results in audible smearing and pre-echo. MP3 uses pre-echo detection routines, and VBR encoding, which allows it to temporarily increase the bitrate during difficult passages, in an attempt to reduce this effect. It is also able to switch between the normal 36 sample quantization window, and instead using 3× short 12 sample windows instead, to reduce the temporal (time) length of quantization artifacts. And yet in choosing a fairly small window size to make MP3&#x27;s temporal response adequate enough to avoid the most serious artifacts, MP3 becomes much less efficient in frequency domain compression of stationary, tonal components.

Being forced to use a &quot;hybrid&quot; time domain (filter bank) /frequency domain (MDCT) model to fit in with Layer II simply wastes processing time and compromises quality by introducing aliasing artifacts. MP3 has an aliasing cancellation stage specifically to mask this problem, but which instead produces frequency domain energy which must be encoded in the audio. This is pushed to the top of the frequency range, where most people have limited hearing, in hopes the distortion it causes will be less audible.

Layer II&#x27;s 1024 point FFT doesn&#x27;t entirely cover all samples, and would omit several entire MP3 sub-bands, where quantization factors must be determined. MP3 instead uses two passes of FFT analysis for spectral estimation, to calculate the global and individual masking thresholds. This allows it to cover all 1152 samples. Of the two, it utilizes the global masking threshold level from the more critical pass, with the most difficult audio.

In addition to Layer II&#x27;s intensity encoded joint stereo, MP3 can use middle/side (mid/side, m/s, MS, matrixed) joint stereo. With mid/side stereo, certain frequency ranges of both channels are merged into a single (middle, mid, L+R) mono channel, while the sound difference between the left and right channels is stored as a separate (side, L-R) channel. Unlike intensity stereo, this process does not discard any audio information. When combined with quantization, however, it can exaggerate artifacts.

If the difference between the left and right channels is small, the side channel will be small, which will offer as much as a 50% bitrate savings, and associated quality improvement. If the difference between left and right is large, standard (discrete, left/right) stereo encoding may be preferred, as mid/side joint stereo will not provide any benefits. An MP3 encoder can switch between m/s stereo and full stereo on a frame-by-frame basis.

Unlike Layers I and II, MP3 uses variable-length Huffman coding (after perceptual) to further reduce the bitrate, without any further quality loss.

====Quality====
MP3&#x27;s more fine-grained and selective quantization does prove notably superior to MP2 at lower-bitrates. It is able to provide nearly equivalent audio quality to Layer II, at a 15% lower bitrate (approximately). 128 kbit/s is considered the &quot;sweet spot&quot; for MP3; meaning it provides generally acceptable quality stereo sound on most music, and there are diminishing quality improvements from increasing the bitrate further. MP3 is also regarded as exhibiting artifacts that are less annoying than Layer II, when both are used at bitrates that are too low to possibly provide faithful reproduction.

Layer III audio files use the extension &quot;.mp3&quot;.
===MPEG-2 audio extensions===
The MPEG-2 standard includes several extensions to MPEG-1 Audio. These are known as MPEG-2 BC – backwards compatible with MPEG-1 Audio. MPEG-2 Audio is defined in ISO/IEC 13818-3.

*MPEG Multichannel – Backward compatible 5.1-channel surround sound.
*Sampling rates: 16000, 22050, and 24000 Hz
*Bitrates: 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 144 and 160 kbit/s

These sampling rates are exactly half that of those originally defined for MPEG-1 Audio. They were introduced to maintain higher quality sound when encoding audio at lower-bitrates. The even-lower bitrates were introduced because tests showed that MPEG-1 Audio could provide higher quality than any existing () very low bitrate (i.e. speech) audio codecs.

==Part 4: Conformance testing==
Part 4 of the MPEG-1 standard covers conformance testing, and is defined in ISO/IEC-11172-4.

Conformance: Procedures for testing conformance.

Provides two sets of guidelines and reference bitstreams for testing the conformance of MPEG-1 audio and video decoders, as well as the bitstreams produced by an encoder.

==Part 5: Reference software==
Part 5 of the MPEG-1 standard includes reference software, and is defined in ISO/IEC TR 11172–5.

Simulation: Reference software.

C reference code for encoding and decoding of audio and video, as well as multiplexing and demultiplexing.

This includes the &quot;ISO Dist10&quot; audio encoder code, which LAME and TooLAME were originally based upon.

== File extension ==

.mpg is one of a number of file extensions for MPEG-1 or MPEG-2 audio and video compression. MPEG-1 Part 2 video is rare nowadays, and this extension typically refers to an MPEG program stream (defined in MPEG-1 and MPEG-2) or MPEG transport stream (defined in MPEG-2). Other suffixes such as .m2ts also exist specifying the precise container, in this case MPEG-2 TS, but this has little relevance to MPEG-1 media.

.mp3 is the most common extension for files containing MP3 audio (typically MPEG-1 Audio, sometimes MPEG-2 Audio). An MP3 file is typically an uncontained stream of raw audio; the conventional way to tag MP3 files is by writing data to &quot;garbage&quot; segments of each frame, which preserve the media information but are discarded by the player. This is similar in many respects to how raw .AAC files are tagged (but this is less supported nowadays, e.g. iTunes).

Note that although it would apply, .mpg does not normally append raw AAC or AAC in MPEG-2 Part 7 Containers. The .aac extension normally denotes these audio files.

<text>Mumia Abu-Jamal (born Wesley Cook; April 24, 1954) is an American political activist and journalist who was convicted of murder and sentenced to death in 1982 for the 1981 murder of Philadelphia police officer Daniel Faulkner. While on death row, he wrote and commented on the criminal justice system in the United States. After numerous appeals, his death sentence was overturned by a federal court. In 2011, the prosecution agreed to a sentence of life imprisonment without parole. He entered the general prison population early the following year.

Beginning at the age of 14 in 1968, Abu-Jamal became involved with the Black Panther Party and was a member until October 1970, leaving the party at age 16. After leaving, he completed his high school education, and later became a radio reporter. He eventually served as president of the Philadelphia Association of Black Journalists (1978–1980). He supported MOVE, a Philadelphia-based organization, and covered the 1978 confrontation in which one police officer was killed. The MOVE Nine were the members who were arrested and convicted of murder in that case.

Since 1982, the murder trial of Abu-Jamal has been seriously criticized for constitutional failings; some have claimed that he is innocent, and many opposed his death sentence. The Faulkner family, politicians, and other groups involved with law enforcement, state and city governments argue that Abu-Jamal&#x27;s trial was fair, his guilt beyond question, and his death sentence justified. 

When his death sentence was overturned by a federal court in 2001, he was described as &quot;perhaps the world&#x27;s best-known death-row inmate&quot; by &quot;The New York Times&quot;. During his imprisonment, Abu-Jamal has published books and commentaries on social and political issues; his first book was &quot;Live from Death Row&quot; (1995).

== Early life and activism ==
Abu-Jamal was born Wesley Cook in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he grew up. He has a younger brother named William. They attended local public schools.

In 1968, a high school teacher, a Kenyan man instructing a class on African cultures, encouraged the students to take African or Arabic names for classroom use; he gave Cook the name &quot;Mumia&quot;. According to Abu-Jamal, &quot;Mumia&quot; means &quot;Prince&quot; and was the name of several Kenyan anti-colonial African nationalists who fought in the Mau Mau uprising before Kenyan independence.

=== Involvement with the Black Panthers ===
Abu-Jamal has described being &quot;kicked ... into the Black Panther Party&quot; as a teenager of 14, after suffering a beating from &quot;white racists&quot; and a policeman for trying to disrupt a 1968 rally for Independent candidate George Wallace, former governor of Alabama, who was running on a racist platform. From then, he helped form the Philadelphia branch of the Black Panther Party with Defense Captain Reggie Schell, and other Panthers. He was appointed as the chapter&#x27;s &quot;Lieutenant of Information,&quot; responsible for writing information and news communications. In an interview in the early years, Abu-Jamal quoted Mao Zedong, saying, &quot;Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun&quot;. That same year, he dropped out of Benjamin Franklin High School and began living at the branch&#x27;s headquarters.

He spent late 1969 in New York City and early 1970 in Oakland, living and working with BPP colleagues in those cities; the party&#x27;s headquarters based in Oakland. He was a party member from May 1969 until October 1970. During this period, he was subject to illegal surveillance as part of the Federal Bureau of Investigation&#x27;s COINTELPRO program, with which the Philadelphia police cooperated. The FBI was working to infiltrate black radical groups and to disrupt them by creating internal dissension.

== Return to education==
After leaving the Panthers, Abu-Jamal returned as a student to his former high school. He was suspended for distributing literature calling for &quot;black revolutionary student power&quot;. He led unsuccessful protests to change the school name to Malcolm X High, to honor the major African-American leader who had been killed in New York by political opponents.

After attaining his GED, Abu-Jamal studied briefly at Goddard College in rural Vermont. He returned to Philadelphia.

== Marriages and family ==
Cook adopted the surname Abu-Jamal (&quot;father of Jamal&quot; in Arabic) after the birth of his first child, son Jamal, on July 18, 1971. He married Jamal&#x27;s mother Biba in 1973, but they did not stay together long. Their daughter, Lateefa, was born shortly after the wedding. The couple divorced.

In 1977, Abu-Jamal married again, to his second wife, Marilyn (known as &quot;Peachie&quot;). Their son, Mazi, was born in early 1978. By 1981, Abu-Jamal had divorced Peachie and had married his third (and last) wife, Wadiya, who died unexpectedly on December 27, 2022.

==Radio journalism career==

By 1975, Abu-Jamal was working in radio newscasting, first at Temple University&#x27;s WRTI and then at commercial enterprises. In 1975, he was employed at radio station WHAT, and he became host of a weekly feature program at WCAU-FM in 1978. He also worked for brief periods at radio station WPEN. He became active in the local chapter of the Marijuana Users Association of America.

From 1979 to 1981, he worked at National Public Radio (NPR) affiliate WHYY. The management asked him to resign, saying that he did not maintain a sufficiently objective approach in his presentation of news. As a radio journalist, Abu-Jamal was renowned for identifying with and covering the MOVE anarcho-primitivist commune in West Philadelphia&#x27;s Powelton Village neighborhood. He reported on the 1979–80 trial of the &quot;MOVE Nine&quot;, who were convicted of the murder of police officer James Ramp. Abu-Jamal had several high-profile interviews, including with Julius Erving, Bob Marley, and Alex Haley. He was elected president of the Philadelphia Association of Black Journalists.

Before joining MOVE, Abu-Jamal reported on the organization. When he joined MOVE, he said it was because of his love of the people in the organization. Thinking back on it later, he said he &quot;was probably enraged as well&quot;.

In December 1981, Abu-Jamal was working as a taxicab driver in Philadelphia two nights a week to supplement his income. He had been working part-time as a reporter for WDAS, then an African American oriented and minority-owned radio station.

== Traffic stop and murder of officer Faulkner==
At 3:55 am on December 9, 1981, in Philadelphia, close to the intersection at 13th and Locust Streets, Philadelphia Police Department officer Daniel Faulkner conducted a traffic stop on a vehicle belonging to and driven by William Cook, Abu-Jamal&#x27;s younger brother. Faulkner and Cook became engaged in a physical confrontation. Driving his cab in the vicinity, Abu-Jamal observed the altercation, parked, and ran across the street toward Cook&#x27;s car. Faulkner was shot in the back and face. He shot Abu-Jamal in the stomach. Faulkner died at the scene from the gunshot to his head.

=== Arrest and trial===
Police arrived and arrested Abu-Jamal, who was found to be wearing a shoulder holster. His revolver, which had five spent cartridges, was beside him. He was taken directly from the scene of the shooting to Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, where he received treatment for his wound. He was next taken to Police
Headquarters, where he was charged and held for trial in the first-degree murder of Officer Faulkner.

=== Prosecution case at trial ===
The prosecution presented four witnesses to the court about the shootings. Robert Chobert, a cab driver who testified he was parked behind Faulkner, identified Abu-Jamal as the shooter. Cynthia White testified that Abu-Jamal emerged from a nearby parking lot and shot Faulkner. Michael Scanlan, a motorist, testified that from two car lengths away he saw a man matching Abu-Jamal&#x27;s description run across the street from a parking lot and shoot Faulkner. Albert Magilton testified to seeing Faulkner pull over Cook&#x27;s car. As Abu-Jamal started to cross the street toward them, Magilton turned away and did not see what happened next.

The prosecution presented two witnesses from the hospital where Abu-Jamal was treated. Hospital security guard Priscilla Durham and police officer Garry Bell testified that Abu-Jamal said in the hospital, &quot;I shot the motherfucker, and I hope the motherfucker dies.&quot;

A .38 caliber Charter Arms revolver, belonging to Abu-Jamal, with five spent cartridges, was retrieved beside him at the scene. He was wearing a shoulder holster. Anthony Paul, the Supervisor of the Philadelphia Police Department&#x27;s firearms identification unit, testified at trial that the cartridge cases and rifling characteristics of the weapon were consistent with bullet fragments taken from Faulkner&#x27;s body. Tests to confirm that Abu-Jamal had handled and fired the weapon were not performed. Contact with arresting police and other surfaces at the scene could have compromised the forensic value of such tests.

=== Defense case at trial ===
The defense maintained that Abu-Jamal was innocent, and that the prosecution witnesses were unreliable. The defense presented nine character witnesses, including poet Sonia Sanchez, who testified that Abu-Jamal was &quot;viewed by the black community as a creative, articulate, peaceful, genial man&quot;. Another defense witness, Dessie Hightower, testified that he saw a man running along the street shortly after the shooting, although he did not see the shooting itself. His testimony contributed to the development of a &quot;running man theory&quot;, based on the possibility that a &quot;running man&quot; may have been the shooter. Veronica Jones also testified for the defense, but she did not testify to having seen another man. Other potential defense witnesses refused to appear in court. Abu-Jamal did not testify in his own defense, nor did his brother, William Cook. Cook had repeatedly told investigators at the crime scene: &quot;I ain&#x27;t got nothing to do with this!&quot;

=== Verdict and sentence ===
After three hours of deliberations, the jury presented a unanimous guilty verdict.

In the sentencing phase of the trial, Abu-Jamal read to the jury from a prepared statement. He was cross-examined about issues relevant to the assessment of his character by Joseph McGill, the prosecuting attorney.

In his statement, Abu-Jamal criticized his attorney as a &quot;legal trained lawyer&quot;, who was imposed on him against his will and who &quot;knew he was inadequate to the task and chose to follow the directions of this black-robed conspirator [referring to the judge], Albert Sabo, even if it meant ignoring my directions.&quot; He claimed that his rights had been &quot;deceitfully stolen&quot; from him by Sabo, particularly focusing on the denial of his request to receive defense assistance from John Africa, who was not an attorney, and being prevented from proceeding &quot;pro se&quot;. He quoted remarks of John Africa, and said:

Abu-Jamal was sentenced to death by the unanimous decision of the jury. 

Amnesty International has objected to the introduction by the prosecution at the time of his sentencing of statements from when he was an activist as a youth. It also protested the politicization of the trial, noting that there was documented recent history in Philadelphia of police abuse and corruption, including fabricated evidence and use of excessive force. Amnesty International concluded &quot;that the proceedings used to convict and sentence Mumia Abu-Jamal to death were in violation of minimum international standards that govern fair trial procedures and the use of the death penalty&quot;.

== Appeals and review ==

=== State appeals ===
The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania on March 6, 1989, heard and rejected a direct appeal of his conviction. It subsequently denied rehearing. The Supreme Court of the United States denied his petition for writ of &quot;certiorari&quot; on October 1, 1990, and denied his petition for rehearing twice up to June 10, 1991.

On June 1, 1995, Abu-Jamal&#x27;s death warrant was signed by Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge. Its execution was suspended while Abu-Jamal pursued state post-conviction review. At the post-conviction review hearings, new witnesses were called. William &quot;Dales&quot; Singletary testified that he saw the shooting, and that the gunman was the passenger in Cook&#x27;s car. Singletary&#x27;s account contained discrepancies which rendered it &quot;not credible&quot; in the opinion of the court.

The six judges of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled unanimously that all issues raised by Abu-Jamal, including the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, were without merit. The Supreme Court of the United States denied a petition for &quot;certiorari&quot; against that decision on October 4, 1999, enabling Ridge to sign a second death warrant on October 13, 1999. Its execution was stayed as Abu-Jamal began to seek federal &quot;habeas corpus&quot; review.

In 1999, Arnold Beverly claimed that he and an unnamed assailant, not Mumia Abu-Jamal, shot Daniel Faulkner as part of a contract killing because Faulkner was interfering with graft and payoff to corrupt police. As Abu-Jamal&#x27;s defense team prepared another appeal in 2001, they were divided over use of the Beverly affidavit. Some thought it usable and others rejected Beverly&#x27;s story as &quot;not credible&quot;.

Private investigator George Newman claimed in 2001 that Chobert had recanted his testimony. Commentators noted that police and news photographs of the crime scene did not show Chobert&#x27;s taxi, and that Cynthia White, the only witness at the original trial to testify to seeing the taxi, had previously provided crime scene descriptions that omitted it. Cynthia White was declared dead by the state of New Jersey in 1992, but Pamela Jenkins claimed that she saw White alive as late as 1997. The Free Mumia Coalition has claimed that White was a police informant and that she falsified her testimony against Abu-Jamal.

Kenneth Pate, who was imprisoned with Abu-Jamal on other charges, has since claimed that his step-sister Priscilla Durham, a hospital security guard, admitted later she had not heard the &quot;hospital confession&quot; to which she had testified at trial. The hospital doctors said that Abu-Jamal was &quot;on the verge of fainting&quot; when brought in, and they did not hear any such confession.

In 2008, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania rejected a further request from Abu-Jamal for a hearing into claims that the trial witnesses perjured themselves, on the grounds that he had waited too long before filing the appeal.

On March 26, 2012, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania rejected his appeal for retrial. His defense had asserted, based on a 2009 report by the National Academy of Sciences, that forensic evidence presented by the prosecution and accepted into evidence in the original trial was unreliable. This was reported as Abu-Jamal&#x27;s last legal appeal.

On April 30, 2018, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that Abu-Jamal would not be immediately granted another appeal and that the proceedings had to continue until August 30 of that year. The defense argued that former Pennsylvania Supreme Court Chief justice Ronald D. Castille should have recused himself from the 2012 appeals decision after his involvement as Philadelphia District Attorney (DA) in the 1989 appeal. Both sides of the 2018 proceedings repeatedly cited a 1990 letter sent by Castille to then-Governor Bob Casey, urging Casey to sign the execution warrants of those convicted of murdering police. This letter, demanding Casey send &quot;a clear and dramatic message to all cop killers,&quot; was claimed as one of many reasons to suspect Castille&#x27;s bias in the case. Philadelphia&#x27;s current DA Larry Krasner stated he could not find any document supporting the defense&#x27;s claim. On August 30, 2018, the proceedings to determine another appeal were once again extended and a ruling on the matter was delayed for at least 60 more days.

=== Federal District Court 2001 ruling ===
The Free Mumia Coalition published statements by William Cook and his brother Abu-Jamal in the spring of 2001. Cook, who had been stopped by the police officer, had not made any statement before April 29, 2001, and did not testify at his brother&#x27;s trial. In 2001 he said that he had not seen who had shot Faulkner. Abu-Jamal did not make any public statements about Faulkner&#x27;s murder until May 4, 2001. In his version of events, he claimed that he was sitting in his cab across the street when he heard shouting, saw a police vehicle, and heard the sound of gunshots. Upon seeing his brother appearing disoriented across the street, Abu-Jamal ran to him from the parking lot and was shot by a police officer.

In 2001, Judge William H. Yohn, Jr. of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania upheld the conviction, saying that Abu-Jamal did not have the right to a new trial. He vacated the sentence of death on December 18, 2001, citing irregularities in the penalty phase of the trial and the original process of sentencing. He said that &quot;the jury instructions and verdict sheet in this case involved an unreasonable application of federal law. The charge and verdict form created a reasonable likelihood that the jury believed it was precluded from considering any mitigating circumstance that had not been found unanimously to exist.&quot; He ordered the State of Pennsylvania to commence new sentencing proceedings within 180 days, and ruled unconstitutional the requirement that a jury be unanimous in its finding of circumstances mitigating against a sentence of death.

Eliot Grossman and Marlene Kamish, attorneys for Abu-Jamal, criticized the ruling on the grounds that it denied the possibility of a &quot;trial de novo&quot;, at which they could introduce evidence that their client had been framed. Prosecutors also criticized the ruling. Officer Faulkner&#x27;s widow Maureen said the judgment would allow Abu-Jamal, whom she described as a &quot;remorseless, hate-filled killer&quot;, to &quot;be permitted to enjoy the pleasures that come from simply being alive&quot;. Both parties appealed.

=== Federal appeal and review ===
On December 6, 2005, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals admitted four issues for appeal of the ruling of the District Court: 
# in relation to sentencing, whether the jury verdict form had been flawed and the judge&#x27;s instructions to the jury had been confusing; 
# in relation to conviction and sentencing, whether racial bias in jury selection existed to an extent tending to produce an inherently biased jury and therefore an unfair trial (the &quot;Batson&quot; claim); 
# in relation to conviction, whether the prosecutor improperly attempted to reduce jurors&#x27; sense of responsibility by telling them that a guilty verdict would be subsequently vetted and subject to appeal; and
# in relation to post-conviction review hearings in 1995–1996, whether the presiding judge, who had also presided at the trial, demonstrated unacceptable bias in his conduct.

The Third Circuit Court heard oral arguments in the appeals on May 17, 2007, at the United States Courthouse in Philadelphia. The appeal panel consisted of Chief Judge Anthony Joseph Scirica, Judge Thomas Ambro, and Judge Robert Cowen. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania sought to reinstate the sentence of death, on the basis that Yohn&#x27;s ruling was flawed, as he should have deferred to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court which had already ruled on the issue of sentencing. The prosecution said that the &quot;Batson&quot; claim was invalid because Abu-Jamal made no complaints during the original jury selection.

The resulting jury was racially mixed, with 2 blacks and 10 whites at the time of the unanimous conviction, but defense counsel told the Third Circuit Court that Abu-Jamal did not get a fair trial because the jury was racially biased, misinformed, and the judge was a racist. He noted that the prosecution used eleven out of fourteen peremptory challenges to eliminate prospective black jurors. Terri Maurer-Carter, a former Philadelphia court stenographer, stated in a 2001 affidavit that she overheard Judge Sabo say &quot;Yeah, and I&#x27;m going to help them fry the nigger,&quot; in the course of a conversation with three people present regarding Abu-Jamal&#x27;s case. Sabo denied having made any such comment.

On March 27, 2008, the three-judge panel issued a majority 2–1 opinion upholding Yohn&#x27;s 2001 opinion but rejecting the bias and &quot;Batson&quot; claims, with Judge Ambro dissenting on the &quot;Batson&quot; issue. On July 22, 2008, Abu-Jamal&#x27;s formal petition seeking reconsideration of the decision by the full Third Circuit panel of 12 judges was denied. On April 6, 2009, the United States Supreme Court refused to hear Abu-Jamal&#x27;s appeal, allowing his conviction to stand.

On January 19, 2010, the Supreme Court ordered the appeals court to reconsider its decision to rescind the death penalty. The same three-judge panel convened in Philadelphia on November 9, 2010, to hear oral argument. On April 26, 2011, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals reaffirmed its prior decision to vacate the death sentence on the grounds that the jury instructions and verdict form were ambiguous and confusing. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case in October.

=== Death penalty dropped ===
On December 7, 2011, District Attorney of Philadelphia R. Seth Williams announced that prosecutors, with the support of the victim&#x27;s family, would no longer seek the death penalty for Abu-Jamal and would accept a sentence of life imprisonment without parole. This sentence was reaffirmed by the Superior Court of Pennsylvania on July 9, 2013.

After the press conference on the sentence, widow Maureen Faulkner said that she did not want to relive the trauma of another trial. She understood that it would be extremely difficult to present the case against Abu-Jamal again, after the passage of 30 years and the deaths of several key witnesses. She also reiterated her belief that Abu-Jamal will be punished further after death.

== Life as a prisoner ==
In 1991, Abu-Jamal published an essay in the &quot;Yale Law Journal&quot;, on the death penalty and his death row experience. In May 1994, Abu-Jamal was engaged by NPR&#x27;s &quot;All Things Considered&quot; program to deliver a series of monthly three-minute commentaries on crime and punishment. The broadcast plans and commercial arrangement were canceled following condemnations from, among others, the Fraternal Order of Police and Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole. Abu-Jamal sued NPR for not airing his work, but a federal judge dismissed the suit. His commentaries later were published in May 1995 as part of his first book, &quot;Live from Death Row.&quot;

In 1996, he completed a B.A. degree via correspondence classes at Goddard College, which he had attended for a time as a young man. He has been invited as commencement speaker by a number of colleges and has participated via recordings. In 1999, Abu-Jamal was invited to record a keynote address for the graduating class at Evergreen State College in Washington State. The event was protested by some. In 2000, he recorded a commencement address for Antioch College. The now defunct New College of California School of Law presented him with an honorary degree &quot;for his struggle to resist the death penalty.&quot;

On October 5, 2014, he gave the commencement speech at Goddard College, via playback of a recording. As before, the choice of Abu-Jamal was controversial. Ten days later the Pennsylvania legislature had passed an addition to the Crime Victims Act called &quot;Revictimization Relief.&quot; The new provision is intended to prevent actions that cause &quot;a temporary or permanent state of mental anguish&quot; to those who have previously been victimized by crime. It was signed by Republican governor Tom Corbett five days later. Commentators suggest that the bill was directed to control Abu-Jamal&#x27;s journalism, book publication, and public speaking, and that it would be challenged on the grounds of free speech.

With occasional interruptions due to prison disciplinary actions, Abu-Jamal has for many years been a regular commentator on an online broadcast, sponsored by Prison Radio. He also is published as a regular columnist for &quot;Junge Welt,&quot; a Marxist newspaper in Germany. For almost a decade, Abu-Jamal taught introductory courses in Georgist economics by correspondence to other prisoners around the world.

In addition, he has written and published several books: &quot;Live From Death Row&quot; (1995), a diary of life on Pennsylvania&#x27;s death row; &quot;All Things Censored&quot; (2000), a collection of essays examining issues of crime and punishment; &quot;Death Blossoms: Reflections from a Prisoner of Conscience&quot; (2003), in which he explores religious themes; and &quot;We Want Freedom: A Life in the Black Panther Party&quot; (2004), a history of the Black Panthers that draws on his own experience and research, and discusses the federal government&#x27;s program known as COINTELPRO to disrupt black activist organizations.

In 1995, Abu-Jamal was punished with solitary confinement for engaging in entrepreneurship contrary to prison regulations. Subsequent to the airing of the 1996 HBO documentary &quot;Mumia Abu-Jamal: A Case For Reasonable Doubt?,&quot; which included footage from visitation interviews conducted with him, the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections banned outsiders from using any recording equipment in state prisons.

In litigation before the U.S. Court of Appeals, in 1998, Abu-Jamal successfully established his right while in prison to write for financial gain. The same litigation also established that the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections had illegally opened his mail in an attempt to establish whether he was earning money by his writing.

When, for a brief time in August 1999, Abu-Jamal began delivering his radio commentaries live on the Pacifica Network&#x27;s &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; weekday radio newsmagazine, prison staff severed the connecting wires of his telephone from their mounting in mid-performance. He was later allowed to resume his broadcasts, and hundreds of his broadcasts have been aired on Pacifica Radio.

Following the overturning of his death sentence, Abu-Jamal was sentenced to life in prison in December 2011. At the end of January 2012, he was shifted from the isolation of death row into the general prison population at State Correctional Institution – Mahanoy.

In August 2015, his attorneys filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, alleging that he has not received appropriate medical care for his serious health conditions. In April 2021, he tested positive for COVID-19 and was scheduled for heart surgery to relieve blocked coronary arteries.

In 2022, Brown University&#x27;s John Hay Library acquired Abu-Jamal&#x27;s personal papers as part of its Voices of Mass Incarceration collecting initiative. According to a Brown University archivist, the Abu-Jamal collection &quot;is the largest and only collection relating to a person who is still incarcerated.&quot;

== Popular support and opposition ==


Labor unions, politicians, advocates, educators, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, and human rights advocacy organizations such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have expressed concern about the impartiality of the trial of Abu-Jamal. Amnesty International neither takes a position on the guilt or innocence of Abu-Jamal nor classifies him as a political prisoner.

The family of Daniel Faulkner, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the City of Philadelphia, politicians, and the Fraternal Order of Police have continued to support the original trial and sentencing of the journalist. In August 1999, the Fraternal Order of Police called for an economic boycott against all individuals and organizations that support Abu-Jamal. Many such groups operate within the Prison-Industrial Complex, a system which Abu-Jamal has frequently criticized.

Partly based on his own writing, Abu-Jamal and his cause have become widely known internationally, and other groups have classified him as a political prisoner. About 25 cities, including Montreal, Palermo, and Paris, have made him an honorary citizen.

In 2001, he received the sixth biennial Erich Mühsam Prize, named after an anarcho-communist essayist, which recognizes activism in line with that of its namesake. In October 2002, he was made an honorary member of the German political organization Union of Persecutees of the Nazi Regime.

On April 29, 2006, a newly paved road in the Parisian suburb of Saint-Denis was named Rue Mumia Abu-Jamal in his honor. In protest of the street-naming, U.S. Congressman Michael Fitzpatrick and Senator Rick Santorum, both members of the Republican Party of Pennsylvania, introduced resolutions in both Houses of Congress condemning the decision. The House of Representatives voted 368–31 in favor of Fitzpatrick&#x27;s resolution. In December 2006, the 25th anniversary of the murder, the executive committee of the Republican Party for the 59th Ward of the City of Philadelphia—covering approximately Germantown, Philadelphia—filed two criminal complaints in the French legal system against the city of Paris and the city of Saint-Denis, accusing the municipalities of &quot;glorifying&quot; Abu-Jamal and alleging the offense &quot;apology or denial of crime&quot; in respect of their actions.

In 2007, the widow of Officer Faulkner co-authored a book with Philadelphia radio journalist Michael Smerconish titled &quot;Murdered by Mumia: A Life Sentence of Pain, Loss, and Injustice.&quot; The book was part memoir of Faulkner&#x27;s widow and part discussion in which they chronicled Abu-Jamal&#x27;s trial and discussed evidence for his conviction. They also discussed support for the death penalty.

In early 2014, President Barack Obama nominated Debo Adegbile, a former lawyer for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, to head the civil rights division of the Justice Department. He had worked on Abu-Jamal&#x27;s case, and his nomination was rejected by the U.S. Senate on a bipartisan basis because of that.

After Goddard College invited Abu-Jamal to give a recorded commencement speech in 2014 and an outcry by the police union against this, the Revictimization Relief Act was introduced, passed and signed into Pennsylvania law. It allowed victims and prosecutors to sue if a perpetrator causes a &quot;state of mental anguish&quot; by perpetuating &quot;the continuing effect of a crime on the victim.&quot; The law was struck down in April 2015 as a vague and overbroad restriction on free speech.

On April 10, 2015, Marylin Zuniga, a teacher at Forest Street Elementary School in Orange, New Jersey, was suspended without pay after asking her students to write cards to Abu-Jamal, who was ill in prison due to complications from diabetes, without approval from the school or parents. Some parents and police leaders denounced her actions. Conversely, some community members, parents, teachers, and professors expressed support for Zuniga and condemned her suspension. Scholars and educators nationwide, including Noam Chomsky, Chris Hedges and Cornel West among others, signed a letter calling for her immediate reinstatement. On May 13, 2015, the Orange Preparatory Academy board voted to dismiss Marylin Zuniga after hearing from her and several of her supporters.

<text>In number theory, a multiplicative function is an arithmetic function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) of a positive integer &quot;n&quot; with the property that &quot;f&quot;(1) = 1 and 
formula_1 whenever &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are coprime.

An arithmetic function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is said to be [[completely multiplicative function|completely multiplicative]] (or totally multiplicative) if &quot;f&quot;(1) = 1 and &quot;f&quot;(&quot;ab&quot;) = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;)&quot;f&quot;(&quot;b&quot;) holds &quot;for all&quot; positive integers &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, even when they are not coprime.

== Examples ==

Some multiplicative functions are defined to make formulas easier to write:

* 1(&quot;n&quot;): the constant function, defined by 1(&quot;n&quot;) = 1 (completely multiplicative)
* Id(&quot;n&quot;): identity function, defined by Id(&quot;n&quot;) = &quot;n&quot; (completely multiplicative)
* Id&quot;k&quot;(&quot;n&quot;): the power functions, defined by Id&quot;k&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) = &quot;n&quot;&quot;k&quot; for any complex number &quot;k&quot; (completely multiplicative). As special cases we have 
** Id0(&quot;n&quot;) = 1(&quot;n&quot;) and
** Id1(&quot;n&quot;) = Id(&quot;n&quot;).
* &quot;ε&quot;(&quot;n&quot;): the function defined by &quot;ε&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) = 1 if &quot;n&quot; = 1 and 0 otherwise, sometimes called &quot;multiplication unit for Dirichlet convolution&quot; or simply the &quot;unit function&quot; (completely multiplicative). Sometimes written as &quot;u&quot;(&quot;n&quot;), but not to be confused with &quot;μ&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) .
* 1&quot;C&quot;(&quot;n&quot;), the indicator function of the set &quot;C&quot; ⊂ Z, for certain sets &quot;C&quot;. The indicator function 1&quot;C&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is multiplicative precisely when the set &quot;C&quot; has the following property for any coprime numbers &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;: the product &quot;ab&quot; is in &quot;C&quot; if and only if the numbers &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are both themselves in &quot;C&quot;. This is the case if &quot;C&quot; is the set of squares, cubes, or &quot;k&quot;-th powers. There are also other sets (not closed under multiplication) that give rise to such functions, such as the set of square-free numbers.

Other examples of multiplicative functions include many functions of importance in number theory, such as:

* gcd(&quot;n&quot;,&quot;k&quot;): the greatest common divisor of &quot;n&quot; and &quot;k&quot;, as a function of &quot;n&quot;, where &quot;k&quot; is a fixed integer.
* formula_2: Euler&#x27;s totient function formula_3, counting the positive integers coprime to (but not bigger than) &quot;n&quot;
* &quot;μ&quot;(&quot;n&quot;): the Möbius function, the parity (−1 for odd, +1 for even) of the number of prime factors of square-free numbers; 0 if &quot;n&quot; is not square-free
* &quot;σ&quot;&quot;k&quot;(&quot;n&quot;): the divisor function, which is the sum of the &quot;k&quot;-th powers of all the positive divisors of &quot;n&quot; (where &quot;k&quot; may be any complex number). Special cases we have
** &quot;σ&quot;0(&quot;n&quot;) = &quot;d&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) the number of positive divisors of &quot;n&quot;,
** &quot;σ&quot;1(&quot;n&quot;) = &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;n&quot;), the sum of all the positive divisors of &quot;n&quot;.
*The sum of the &quot;k&quot;-th powers of the unitary divisors is denoted by σ*&quot;k&quot;(&quot;n&quot;):

:formula_4
* &quot;a&quot;(&quot;n&quot;): the number of non-isomorphic abelian groups of order &quot;n&quot;.
* &quot;λ&quot;(&quot;n&quot;): the Liouville function, &quot;λ&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) = (−1)Ω(&quot;n&quot;) where Ω(&quot;n&quot;) is the total number of primes (counted with multiplicity) dividing &quot;n&quot;. (completely multiplicative).
* &quot;γ&quot;(&quot;n&quot;), defined by &quot;γ&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) = (−1)&quot;ω&quot;(n), where the additive function &quot;ω&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is the number of distinct primes dividing &quot;n&quot;.
* &quot;τ&quot;(&quot;n&quot;): the Ramanujan tau function.
* All Dirichlet characters are completely multiplicative functions. For example
** (&quot;n&quot;/&quot;p&quot;), the Legendre symbol, considered as a function of &quot;n&quot; where &quot;p&quot; is a fixed prime number.

An example of a non-multiplicative function is the arithmetic function &quot;r&quot;2(&quot;n&quot;) - the number of representations of &quot;n&quot; as a sum of squares of two integers, positive, negative, or zero, where in counting the number of ways, reversal of order is allowed. For example:

and therefore &quot;r&quot;2(1) = 4 ≠ 1. This shows that the function is not multiplicative. However, &quot;r&quot;2(&quot;n&quot;)/4 is multiplicative.

In the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, sequences of values of a multiplicative function have the keyword &quot;mult&quot;.

See arithmetic function for some other examples of non-multiplicative functions.

== Properties ==
A multiplicative function is completely determined by its values at the powers of prime numbers, a consequence of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. Thus, if &quot;n&quot; is a product of powers of distinct primes, say &quot;n&quot; = &quot;p&quot;&quot;a&quot; &quot;q&quot;&quot;b&quot; ..., then 
&quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;p&quot;&quot;a&quot;) &quot;f&quot;(&quot;q&quot;&quot;b&quot;) ...

This property of multiplicative functions significantly reduces the need for computation, as in the following examples for &quot;n&quot; = 144 = 24 · 32:
formula_5
formula_6
formula_7

Similarly, we have:
formula_8

In general, if &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is a multiplicative function and &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; are any two positive integers, then
Every completely multiplicative function is a homomorphism of monoids and is completely determined by its restriction to the prime numbers.

== Convolution ==

If &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are two multiplicative functions, one defines a new multiplicative function formula_9, the &quot;Dirichlet convolution&quot; of &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot;, by
formula_10
where the sum extends over all positive divisors &quot;d&quot; of &quot;n&quot;. 
With this operation, the set of all multiplicative functions turns into an abelian group; the identity element is &quot;ε&quot;. Convolution is commutative, associative, and distributive over addition.

Relations among the multiplicative functions discussed above include:

* formula_11 (the Möbius inversion formula)
* formula_12 (generalized Möbius inversion)
* formula_13
* formula_14
* formula_15

The Dirichlet convolution can be defined for general arithmetic functions, and yields a ring structure, the Dirichlet ring. 

The Dirichlet convolution of two multiplicative functions is again multiplicative. A proof of this fact is given by the following expansion for relatively prime formula_19:

== Rational arithmetical functions ==

An arithmetical function &quot;f&quot; is said to be a rational arithmetical function of order formula_25 if there exists completely multiplicative functions &quot;g&quot;&quot;1&quot;...,&quot;g&quot;&quot;r&quot;, 
&quot;h&quot;&quot;1&quot;...,&quot;h&quot;&quot;s&quot; such that 
formula_26
where the inverses are with respect to the Dirichlet convolution. Rational arithmetical functions of order formula_27 are known as totient functions, and rational arithmetical functions of order formula_28 are known as quadratic functions or specially multiplicative functions. Euler&#x27;s function formula_2 is a totient function, and the divisor function formula_30 is a quadratic function. 
Completely multiplicative functions are rational arithmetical functions of order formula_31. Liouville&#x27;s function formula_32 is completely multiplicative. The Möbius function formula_33 is a rational arithmetical function of order formula_34.
By convention, the identity element formula_35 under the Dirichlet convolution is a rational arithmetical function of order formula_36.

All rational arithmetical functions are multiplicative. A multiplicative function &quot;f&quot; is a rational arithmetical function of order formula_25 if and only if its Bell series is of the form 
formula_38
for all prime numbers formula_39.

The concept of a rational arithmetical function originates from R. Vaidyanathaswamy (1931).

== Busche-Ramanujan identities ==

A multiplicative function formula_40 is said to be specially multiplicative
if there is a completely multiplicative function formula_41 such that
:formula_42
for all positive integers formula_43 and formula_44, or equivalently 
:formula_45
for all positive integers formula_43 and formula_44, where formula_48 is the Möbius function. 
These are known as Busche-Ramanujan identities. 
In 1906, E. Busche stated the identity
:formula_49
and, in 1915, S. Ramanujan gave the inverse form
:formula_50
for formula_51. S. Chowla gave the inverse form for general formula_52 in 1929, see P. J. McCarthy (1986). The study of Busche-Ramanujan identities begun from an attempt to better understand the special cases given by Busche and Ramanujan. 

It is known that quadratic functions formula_53 satisfy the Busche-Ramanujan identities with formula_54. Quadratic functions are exactly the same as specially multiplicative functions. Totients satisfy a restricted Busche-Ramanujan identity. For further details, see R. Vaidyanathaswamy (1931).

==Multiplicative function over ==
Let , the polynomial ring over the finite field with &quot;q&quot; elements. &quot;A&quot; is a principal ideal domain and therefore &quot;A&quot; is a unique factorization domain.

A complex-valued function formula_55 on &quot;A&quot; is called multiplicative if formula_56 whenever &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are relatively prime.

===Zeta function and Dirichlet series in ===
Let &quot;h&quot; be a polynomial arithmetic function (i.e. a function on set of monic polynomials over &quot;A&quot;). Its corresponding Dirichlet series is defined to be
: formula_57
where for formula_58 set formula_59 if formula_60 and formula_61 otherwise.

The polynomial zeta function is then
: formula_62

Similar to the situation in , every Dirichlet series of a multiplicative function &quot;h&quot; has a product representation (Euler product):
: formula_63
where the product runs over all monic irreducible polynomials &quot;P&quot;. For example, the product representation of the zeta function is as for the integers:
: formula_64

Unlike the classical zeta function, formula_65 is a simple rational function:
: formula_66

In a similar way, If &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are two polynomial arithmetic functions, one defines &quot;f&quot; * &quot;g&quot;, the &quot;Dirichlet convolution&quot; of &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot;, by
: formula_67
where the sum is over all monic divisors &quot;d&quot; of &quot;m&quot;, or equivalently over all pairs (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) of monic polynomials whose product is &quot;m&quot;. The identity formula_68 still holds.

== Multivariate ==
Multivariate functions can be constructed using multiplicative model estimators. Where a matrix function of is defined as formula_69

a sum can be distributed across the productformula_70

For the efficient estimation of , the following two nonparametric regressions can be considered: formula_71

and formula_72

Thus it gives an estimate value of formula_73

with a local likelihood function for formula_74 with known formula_75 and unknown formula_76.

== Generalizations ==

An arithmetical function formula_40 is 
quasimultiplicative if there exists a nonzero constant formula_78 such that
formula_79
for all positive integers formula_80 with formula_81. This concept originates by Lahiri (1972). 

An arithmetical function formula_40 is semimultiplicative 
if there exists a nonzero constant formula_78, a positive integer formula_84 and
a multiplicative function formula_85 such that
formula_86
for all positive integers formula_44 
(under the convention that formula_88 if formula_89 is not a positive integer.) This concept is due to David Rearick (1966). 

An arithmetical function formula_40 is Selberg multiplicative if 
for each prime formula_39 there exists a function formula_92 on nonnegative integers with formula_93 for
all but finitely many primes formula_39 such that
formula_95
for all positive integers formula_44, where formula_97 is the exponent of formula_39 in the canonical factorization of formula_44. 
See Selberg (1977). 

It is known that the classes of semimultiplicative and Selberg multiplicative functions coincide. They both satisfy the arithmetical identity 
formula_100
for all positive integers formula_80. See Haukkanen (2012).

It is well known and easy to see that multiplicative functions are quasimultiplicative functions with formula_102 and quasimultiplicative functions are semimultiplicative functions with formula_103.

<text>MPEG-2 (a.k.a. H.222/H.262 as was defined by the ITU) is a standard for &quot;the generic coding of moving pictures and associated audio information&quot;. It describes a combination of lossy video compression and lossy audio data compression methods, which permit storage and transmission of movies using currently available storage media and transmission bandwidth. While MPEG-2 is not as efficient as newer standards such as H.264/AVC and H.265/HEVC, backwards compatibility with existing hardware and software means it is still widely used, for example in over-the-air digital television broadcasting and in the DVD-Video standard.

==Main characteristics==
MPEG-2 is widely used as the format of digital television signals that are broadcast by terrestrial (over-the-air), cable, and direct broadcast satellite TV systems. It also specifies the format of movies and other programs that are distributed on DVD and similar discs. TV stations, TV receivers, DVD players, and other equipment are often designed to this standard. MPEG-2 was the second of several standards developed by the Moving Pictures Expert Group (MPEG) and is an international standard (ISO/IEC 13818, titled &quot;Information technology — Generic coding of moving pictures and associated audio information&quot;). Parts 1 and 2 of MPEG-2 were developed in a collaboration with ITU-T, and they have a respective catalog number in the ITU-T Recommendation Series.

While MPEG-2 is the core of most digital television and DVD formats, it does not completely specify them. Regional institutions can adapt it to their needs by restricting and augmenting aspects of the standard. See Video profiles and levels.

===Systems===
MPEG-2 Part 1 (ISO/IEC 13818-1 and ITU-T Rec. H.222.0), titled &quot;Systems&quot;, defines two distinct, but related, container formats. One is the &quot;transport stream&quot;, a data packet format designed to transmit one data packet in four ATM data packets for streaming digital video and audio over fixed or mobile transmission mediums, where the beginning and the end of the stream may not be identified, such as radio frequency, cable and linear recording mediums, examples of which include ATSC/DVB/ISDB/SBTVD broadcasting, and HDV recording on tape. The other is the &quot;program stream&quot;, an extended version of the MPEG-1 container format with less overhead than &quot;transport stream&quot;. &quot;Program stream&quot; is designed for random access storage mediums such as hard disk drives, optical discs and flash memory.

&quot;Transport stream&quot; file formats include M2TS, which is used on Blu-ray discs, AVCHD on re-writable DVDs and HDV on compact flash cards. &quot;Program stream&quot; files include VOB on DVDs and Enhanced VOB on the short lived HD DVD. The standard MPEG-2 &quot;transport stream&quot; contains packets of 188 bytes. M2TS prepends each packet with 4 bytes containing a 2-bit copy permission indicator and 30-bit timestamp.

ISO authorized the &quot;SMPTE Registration Authority, LLC&quot; as the registration authority for MPEG-2 format identifiers. The registration descriptor of MPEG-2 transport is provided by ISO/IEC 13818-1 in order to enable users of the standard to unambiguously carry data when its format is not necessarily a recognized international standard. This provision will permit the MPEG-2 transport standard to carry all types of data while providing for a method of unambiguous identification of the characteristics of the underlying private data.

===Video===
MPEG-2 Part 2 (ISO/IEC 13818-2 and ITU-T Rec. H.262), titled &quot;Video&quot;, is similar to the previous MPEG-1 Part 2 standard, but adds support for interlaced video, the format used by analog broadcast TV systems. MPEG-2 video is not optimized for low bit rates, especially less than 1 Mbit/s at standard-definition resolutions. All standards-compliant MPEG-2 Video decoders are fully capable of playing back MPEG-1 Video streams conforming to the constrained parameters bitstream (CPB) limits.

With some enhancements, MPEG-2 Video and Systems are also used in some HDTV transmission systems, and is the standard format for over-the-air ATSC digital television.

===Audio===
MPEG-2 introduces new audio encoding methods compared to MPEG-1:

==== MPEG-2 Part 3 ====
MPEG-2 Part 3 (ISO/IEC 13818-3), titled &quot;Audio&quot;, enhances MPEG-1&#x27;s audio by allowing the coding of audio programs with more than two channels, up to 5.1 multichannel. This method is backwards-compatible with MPEG-1, allowing MPEG-1 audio decoders to decode the two main stereo components of the presentation. This extension is called MPEG Multichannel or MPEG-2 BC (backwards-compatible).

MPEG-2 Part 3 also defines additional bit rates and sampling rates for MPEG-1 Audio Layers I, II, and III. This extension is known as MPEG-2 LSF (low sampling frequencies), since the new sampling rates are one-half multiples (16, 22.05 and 24 kHz) of the sampling rates defined in MPEG-1 (32, 44.1 and 48 kHz).

==== MPEG-2 Part 7 ====
MPEG-2 Part 7 (ISO/IEC 13818-7), titled &quot;Advanced Audio Coding (AAC)&quot; specifies a rather different, non-backwards-compatible audio format. This format is most commonly called Advanced Audio Coding (AAC), but was originally called MPEG-2 NBC (non-backwards-compatible).

AAC is more efficient than the previous MPEG audio standards, and is in some ways less complicated than its predecessor, MPEG-1 Part 3 Audio Layer 3, in that it does not have the hybrid filter bank. It supports from 1 to 48 channels at sampling rates of 8 to 96 kHz, with multichannel, multilingual, and multiprogram capabilities.

AAC is also defined in MPEG-4 Part 3.

==MPEG-2 Parts==
MPEG-2 standards are published as &quot;Parts&quot;. Each part covers a certain aspect of the whole specification.

==History==
MPEG-2 evolved out of the shortcomings of MPEG-1.

MPEG-1&#x27;s known weaknesses:
* An audio compression system limited to two channels (stereo)
* No standardized support for interlaced video with poor compression when used for interlaced video
* Only one standardized &quot;profile&quot;, constrained parameters bitstream (CBP), which was unsuited for higher resolution video. MPEG-1 could support 4K video but there was no easy way to encode video for higher resolutions, and identify hardware capable of supporting it, as the limitations of such hardware were not defined.
* Support for only one chroma subsampling, 4:2:0

Sakae Okubo of NTT was the ITU-T coordinator for developing the H.262/MPEG-2 Part 2 video coding standard and the requirements chairman in MPEG for the MPEG-2 set of standards. The majority of patents underlying MPEG-2 technology are owned by three companies: Sony (311 patents), Thomson (198 patents) and Mitsubishi Electric (119 patents). Hyundai Electronics (now SK Hynix) developed the first MPEG-2 SAVI (System/Audio/Video) decoder in 1995.

== Filename extensions ==
.mpg, .mpeg, .m2v, .mp2, .mp3 are some of a number of filename extensions used for MPEG-1 or MPEG-2 audio and video file formats.

File extension MP3 (formally MPEG-1 Audio Layer III or MPEG-2 Audio Layer III) is a coding format for digital audio developed largely by the Fraunhofer Society in Germany, with support from other digital scientists in the United States and elsewhere.

==Applications==

===HDV===
HDV is a format for recording and playback of high-definition MPEG-2 video on a DV cassette tape.

===MOD and TOD===
MOD and TOD are recording formats for use in consumer digital file-based camcorders.

===XDCAM===
XDCAM is a professional file-based video recording format.

===DVB===
Application-specific restrictions on MPEG-2 video in the DVB standard:

Allowed resolutions for SDTV:
* 720, 704, 544, 528, 480 or 352 × 480 pixel, 24/1.001, 24, 30/1.001 or 30 frame/s
* 352 × 240 pixel, 24/1.001, 24, 30/1.001 or 30 frame/s
* 720, 702, 544, 528, 480 or 352 × 576 pixel, 25 frame/s
* 352 × 288 pixel, 25 frame/s
For HDTV:

* 1280 x 720 x 25 or 50 frame/s progressive (720p50/720p50)
* 1440 or 1920 x 1080 x 25 frame/s progressive (1080p25 = film mode)
* 1440 or 1920 x 1080 x 25 frame/s interlace (1080i50)

===ATSC===
The ATSC A/53 standard used in the United States, uses MPEG-2 video at the Main Profile @ High Level (MP@HL), with additional restrictions such as the maximum bitrate of 19.39 Mbit/s for broadcast television and 38.8 Mbit/s for cable television, 4:2:0 chroma subsampling format, and mandatory colorimetry information.

ATSC allows the following video resolutions, aspect ratios, and frame/field rates:
* 1920 × 1080 pixel (16:9, square pixels), at 30p, 29.97p, 24p, 23.976p, 60i, 59.94i.
* 1280 × 720 pixel (16:9, square pixels), at 60p, 59.94p, 30p, 29.97p, 24p, or 23.976p
* 704 × 480 pixel (4:3 or 16:9, non-square pixels), at 60p, 59.94p, 30p, 29.97p, 24p, 23.976p, 60i, or 59.94i
* 640 × 480 pixel (4:3, square pixels), at 60p, 59.94p, 30p, 29.97p, 24p, 23.976p, 60i, or 59.94i

ATSC standard A/63 defines additional resolutions and aspect rates for 50 Hz (PAL) signal.

The ATSC specification and MPEG-2 allow the use of progressive frames, even within an interlaced video sequence. For example, a station that transmits 1080i60 video sequence can use a coding method where those 60 fields are coded with 24 progressive frames and metadata instructs the decoder to interlace them and perform 3:2 pulldown before display. This allows broadcasters to switch between 60 Hz interlaced (news, soap operas) and 24 Hz progressive (prime-time) content without ending the MPEG-2 sequence and introducing several seconds of delay as the TV switches formats. This is the reason why 1080p30 and 1080p24 sequences allowed by the ATSC specification are not used in practice.

The 1080-line formats are encoded with 1920 × 1088 pixel luma matrices and 960 × 540 chroma matrices, but the last 8 lines are discarded by the MPEG-2 decoding and display process.

ATSC A/72 is the newest revision of ATSC standards for digital television, which allows the use of H.264/AVC video coding format and 1080p60 signal.

MPEG-2 audio was a contender for the ATSC standard during the DTV &quot;Grand Alliance&quot; shootout, but lost out to Dolby AC-3.

===ISDB-T===
Technical features of MPEG-2 in ATSC are also valid for ISDB-T, except that in the main TS has aggregated a second program for mobile devices compressed in MPEG-4 H.264 AVC for video and AAC-LC for audio, mainly known as 1seg.

===Blu-ray===

MPEG-2 is one of the three supported video coding formats supported by Blu-ray Disc. Early Blu-ray releases typically used MPEG-2 video, but recent releases are almost always in H.264 or occasionally VC-1. Only MPEG-2 video (MPEG-2 part 2) is supported, Blu-ray does not support MPEG-2 audio (parts 3 and 7). Additionally, the container format used on Blu-ray discs is an MPEG-2 transport stream, regardless of which audio and video codecs are used.

==Patent pool==
As of January 3, 2024, MPEG-2 patents have expired worldwide, with the exception of only Malaysia, where the last patent is expected to expire in 2035. The last US patent expired on February 23, 2018.

MPEG LA, a private patent licensing organization, had acquired rights from over 20 corporations and one university to license a patent pool of approximately 640 worldwide patents, which it claimed were &quot;essential&quot; to use of MPEG-2 technology. The patent holders included Sony, Mitsubishi Electric, Fujitsu, Panasonic, Scientific Atlanta, Columbia University, Philips, General Instrument, Canon, Hitachi, JVC Kenwood, LG Electronics, NTT, Samsung, Sanyo, Sharp and Toshiba. Where Software patentability is upheld and patents have not expired (only Malaysia), the use of MPEG-2 requires the payment of licensing fees to the patent holders. Other patents were licensed by Audio MPEG, Inc. The development of the standard itself took less time than the patent negotiations. Patent pooling between essential and peripheral patent holders in the MPEG-2 pool was the subject of a study by the University of Wisconsin.

According to the MPEG-2 licensing agreement any use of MPEG-2 technology in countries with active patents (Malaysia) is subject to royalties. MPEG-2 encoders and decoders are subject to $0.35 per unit. Also, any packaged medium (DVDs/Data Streams) is subject to licence fees according to length of recording/broadcast. The royalties were previously priced higher but were lowered at several points, most recently on January 1, 2018. 
An earlier criticism of the MPEG-2 patent pool was that even though the number of patents had decreased from 1,048 to 416 by June 2013 the license fee had not decreased with the expiration rate of MPEG-2 patents.

<text>MPEG-3 was the designation for an abandoned plan to create a group of audio and video coding standards agreed upon by the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) designed to handle HDTV signals at 1080p in the range of 20 to 40 megabits per second. MPEG-3 was launched as an effort to address the need of an HDTV standard while work on MPEG-2 was underway, but it was soon discovered that MPEG-2, at high data rates, would accommodate HDTV. Thus, in 1992 HDTV was included as a separate profile in the MPEG-2 standard and MPEG-3 was rolled into MPEG-2.

<doc id="20062" wikidata="Q108458" url="?curid=20062" title="Meditation">
<text>Meditation is a practice in which an individual uses a technique to train attention and awareness and detach from reflexive, &quot;discursive thinking,&quot; achieving a mentally clear and emotionally calm and stable state, while not judging the meditation process itself.

Techniques are broadly classified into focused (or concentrative) and open monitoring methods. Focused methods involve attention to specific objects like breath or mantras, while open monitoring includes mindfulness and awareness of mental events.

Meditation is practiced in numerous religious traditions, though it is also practised independently from any religious or spiritual influences for its health benefits. The earliest records of meditation (&quot;dhyana&quot;) are found in the Upanishads, and meditation plays a salient role in the contemplative repertoire of Jainism, Buddhism and Hinduism. Meditation-like techniques are also known in Judaism, Christianity and Islam, in the context of remembrance of and prayer and devotion to God.

Asian meditative techniques have spread to other cultures where they have found application in non-spiritual contexts, such as business and health. Meditation may significantly reduce stress, fear, anxiety, depression, and pain, and enhance peace, perception, self-concept, and well-being. Research is ongoing to better understand the effects of meditation on health (psychological, neurological, and cardiovascular) and other areas.
==Etymology==

The English &quot;meditation&quot; is derived from Old French &quot;meditacioun&quot;, in turn from Latin &quot;meditatio&quot; from a verb &quot;meditari&quot;, meaning &quot;to think, contemplate, devise, ponder&quot;. In the Catholic tradition, the use of the term &quot;meditatio&quot; as part of a formal, stepwise process of meditation goes back to at least the 12th-century monk Guigo II, before which the Greek word &quot;theoria&quot; was used for the same purpose.

Apart from its historical usage, the term &quot;meditation&quot; was introduced as a translation for Eastern spiritual practices, referred to as &quot;dhyāna&quot; in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, which comes from the Sanskrit root &quot;dhyai&quot;, meaning to contemplate or meditate. The greek word &quot;theoria&quot; actually derives from the same root. 

The term &quot;meditation&quot; in English may also refer to practices from Islamic Sufism, or other traditions such as Jewish Kabbalah and Christian Hesychasm.

==Definitions==

===Difficulties in defining meditation===

====No universally accepted definition for meditation====

Meditation has proven difficult to define as it covers a wide range of dissimilar practices in different traditions and cultures. In popular usage, the word &quot;meditation&quot; and the phrase &quot;meditative practice&quot; are often used imprecisely to designate practices found across many cultures. These can include almost anything that is claimed to train the attention of mind or to teach calmness or compassion. There remains no definition of necessary and sufficient criteria for meditation that has achieved widespread acceptance within the modern scientific community.

====Separation of technique from tradition====

Some of the difficulty in precisely defining meditation has been in recognizing the particularities of the many various traditions; and theories and practice can differ within a tradition. Taylor noted that even within a faith such as &quot;Hindu&quot; or &quot;Buddhist&quot;, schools and individual teachers may teach distinct types of meditation.
Ornstein noted that &quot;Most techniques of meditation do not exist as solitary practices but are only artificially separable from an entire system of practice and belief.&quot; For instance, while monks meditate as part of their everyday lives, they also engage in the codified rules and live together in monasteries in specific cultural settings that go along with their meditative practices.

===Dictionary definitions===
Dictionaries give both the original Latin meaning of &quot;think[ing] deeply about (something)&quot;, as well as the popular usages of &quot;focusing one&#x27;s mind for a period of time&quot;, &quot;the act of giving your attention to only one thing, either as a religious activity or as a way of becoming calm and relaxed&quot;, and &quot;to engage in mental exercise (such as concentrating on one&#x27;s breathing or repetition of a mantra) for the purpose of reaching a heightened level of spiritual awareness.&quot;

===Scholarly definitions===
In modern psychological research, meditation has been defined and characterized in various ways. Many of these emphasize the role of attention and characterize the practice of meditation as attempts to detach from reflexive, &quot;discursive thinking,&quot; not judging the meditation-process itself (&quot;logical relaxation&quot;), to achieve a deeper, more devout, or more relaxed state.

Bond et al. (2009) identified criteria for defining a practice as meditation &quot;for use in a comprehensive systematic review of the therapeutic use of meditation&quot;, using &quot;a 5-round Delphi study with a panel of 7 experts in meditation research&quot; who were also trained in diverse but empirically highly studied (Eastern-derived or clinical) forms of meditation:

Several other definitions of meditation have been used by influential modern reviews of research on meditation across multiple traditions:
* Walsh &amp; Shapiro (2006): &quot;Meditation refers to a family of self-regulation practices that focus on training attention and awareness in order to bring mental processes under greater voluntary control and thereby foster general mental well-being and development and/or specific capacities such as calm, clarity, and concentration&quot;
* Cahn &amp; Polich (2006): &quot;&quot;Meditation&quot; is used to describe practices that self-regulate the body and mind, thereby affecting mental events by engaging a specific attentional set... regulation of attention is the central commonality across the many divergent methods&quot;
* Jevning et al. (1992): &quot;We define meditation... as a stylized mental technique... repetitively practiced for the purpose of attaining a subjective experience that is frequently described as very restful, silent, and of heightened alertness, often characterized as blissful&quot;
* Goleman (1988): &quot;the need for the meditator to retrain his attention, whether through concentration or mindfulness, is the single invariant ingredient in... every meditation system&quot;

===Classifications===

====Focused and open methods====
In the West, meditation techniques have often been classified in two broad categories, which in actual practice are often combined: focused (or concentrative) meditation and open monitoring (or mindfulness) meditation:
Focused methods include paying attention to the breath, to an idea or feeling (such as &quot;mettā&quot; – loving-kindness), to a &quot;kōan&quot;, or to a &quot;mantra&quot; (such as in transcendental meditation), and single point meditation. Open monitoring methods include mindfulness, &quot;shikantaza&quot; and other awareness states.

====Other possible typologies====
Another typology divides meditation approaches into concentrative, generative, receptive and reflective practices:
* concentrative: focused attention, including breath meditation, TM, and visualizations;
* generative: developing qualities like loving kindness and compassion;
* receptive: open monitoring;
* reflective: systematic investigation, contemplation.

The Buddhist tradition often divides meditative practice into &quot;samatha&quot;, or calm abiding, and &quot;vipassana&quot;, insight. Mindfulness of breathing, a form of focused attention, calms down the mind; this calmed mind can then investigate the nature of reality, by monitoring the fleeting and ever-changing constituents of experience, by reflective investigation, or by &quot;turning back the radiance,&quot; focusing awareness on awareness itself and discerning the true nature of mind as awareness itself.

Matko and Sedlmeier (2019) &quot;call into question the common division into &#x27;focused attention&#x27; and &#x27;open-monitoring&#x27; practices.&quot; They argue for &quot;two orthogonal dimensions along which meditation techniques could be classified,&quot; namely &quot;activation&quot; and &quot;amount of body orientation,&quot; proposing seven clusters of techniques: &quot;mindful observation, body-centered meditation, visual concentration, contemplation, affect-centered meditation, mantra meditation, and meditation with movement.&quot;

Jonathan Shear argues that transcendental meditation is an &quot;automatic self-transcending&quot; technique, different from focused attention and open monitoring. In this kind of practice, &quot;there is no attempt to sustain any particular condition at all. Practices of this kind, once started, are reported to automatically &#x27;transcend&#x27; their own activity and disappear, to be started up again later if appropriate.&quot; Yet, Shear also states that &quot;automatic self-transcending&quot; also applies to the way other techniques such as from Zen and Qigong are practiced by experienced meditators &quot;once they had become effortless and automatic through years of practice.&quot;

==Technique==

===Posture===

Asanas or body postures such as &quot;padmasana&quot; (full-lotus, half-lotus), cross-legged sitting, &quot;seiza&quot;, and kneeling positions are popular meditative postures in Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, although other postures such as sitting, supine (lying), and standing are also used. Meditation is also sometimes done while walking, known as &quot;kinhin&quot;, while doing a simple task mindfully, known as &quot;samu&quot;, or while lying down, known as &quot;shavasana&quot;.

===Frequency===
The Transcendental Meditation technique recommends practice of 20 minutes twice per day. Some techniques suggest less time, especially when starting meditation, and Richard Davidson has quoted research saying benefits can be achieved with a practice of only 8 minutes per day. Research shows improvement in meditation time with simple oral and video training. Some meditators practice for much longer, particularly when on a course or retreat. Some meditators find practice best in the hours before dawn.

===Supporting aids===

====Use of prayer beads====
Some religions have traditions of using prayer beads as tools in devotional meditation. Most prayer beads and Christian rosaries consist of pearls or beads linked together by a thread. The Roman Catholic rosary is a string of beads containing five sets with ten small beads. Eastern and Oriental Orthodox have traditions of using prayer ropes called Comboschini or Meqetaria as an aid to prayerful meditation. The Hindu &quot;japa mala&quot; has 108 beads. The figure 108 in itself having spiritual significance as the energy of the sounds equivalates to Om, as well as those used in Gaudiya Vaishnavism, the Hare Krishna tradition, and Jainism. Buddhist prayer beads also have 108 beads, but hold a different meaning. In Buddhism, there are 108 human passions that impede enlightenment. Each bead is counted once as a person recites a mantra until the person has gone all the way around the mala. The Muslim &quot;misbaha&quot; has 99 beads. There is also quite a variance when it comes to materials used for beads. Beads made from seeds of rudraksha trees are considered sacred by devotees of Shiva, while followers of Vishnu revere the wood that comes from the Tulsi plant, also known as Holy Basil.

====Striking the meditator====
The Buddhist literature has many stories of Enlightenment being attained through disciples being struck by their masters. T. Griffith Foulk recounts how the encouragement stick was an integral part of the Zen practice when he trained:

====Using a narrative====
Neuroscientist and long-time meditator Richard Davidson has expressed the view that having a narrative can help the maintenance of daily practice. For instance, he himself prostrates to the teachings, and meditates &quot;not primarily for my benefit, but for the benefit of others&quot;.

==== Psychedelics ====
Studies suggest the potential of psychedelics, such as psilocybin and DMT, to enhance meditative training.

==Meditation traditions==
===Origins===
The history of meditation is intimately bound up with the religious context within which it was practiced. Rossano suggested that the emergence of the capacity for focused attention, an element of many methods of meditation, may have contributed to the latest phases of human biological evolution. Some of the earliest references to meditation, as well as proto-Samkhya, are found in the Upanishads of India. According to Wynne, the earliest clear references to meditation are in the middle Upanishads and the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; (including the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;). According to Gavin Flood, the earlier &quot;Brihadaranyaka Upanishad&quot; is describing meditation when it states that &quot;Having become calm and concentrated, one perceives the self (Ātman) within oneself&quot; (BU 4.4.23).

===Indian religions===

==== Hinduism ====

There are many schools and styles of meditation within Hinduism. In pre-modern and traditional Hinduism, &quot;Yoga&quot; and &quot;Dhyana&quot; are practised to recognize &#x27;pure awareness&#x27;, or &#x27;pure consciousness&#x27;, undisturbed by the workings of the mind, as one&#x27;s eternal self. In Advaita Vedanta &quot;jivatman&quot;, individual self, is recognized as illusory, and in Reality identical with the omnipresent and non-dual Ātman-Brahman. In the dualistic Yoga school and Samkhya, the Self is called Purusha, a pure consciousness undisturbed by Prakriti, &#x27;nature&#x27;. Depending on the tradition, the liberative event is named moksha, vimukti or kaivalya.

One of the most influential texts of classical Hindu Yoga is Patañjali&#x27;s Yoga sutras (c. 400 CE), a text associated with Yoga and Samkhya and influenced by Buddhism, which outlines eight limbs leading to kaivalya (&quot;aloneness&quot;) or inner awareness. The first four, known as the &quot;outer limbs,&quot; include ethical discipline (yamas), rules (niyamas), physical postures (āsanas), and breath control (prāṇāyama). The fifth, withdrawal from the senses (pratyāhāra), transitions into the &quot;inner limbs&quot; that are one-pointedness of mind (dhāraṇā), meditation (dhyāna), and finally samādhi.

Later developments in Hindu meditation include the compilation of Hatha Yoga (forceful yoga) compendiums like the Hatha Yoga Pradipika, the development of Bhakti yoga as a major form of meditation, and Tantra. Another important Hindu yoga text is the Yoga Yajnavalkya, which makes use of Hatha Yoga and Vedanta Philosophy.

===== Mantra Meditation =====
The Bhagavata Purana emphasizes that mantra meditation is a key practice for achieving liberation; practitioners can achieve a direct vision of the divine. The text integrates both Vedic and tantric elements, where mantras are not only seen as sacred sounds but as embodiment of the deity. This approach reflects a shift from the impersonal meditation on the sound-form of Brahman (Om) in the Upanishads to a personal, devotional focus on Krishna in the Bhagavata Purana.

==== Jainism ====

Jainism has three elements called the &quot;Ratnatraya&quot; (&quot;Three Jewels&quot;): right perception and faith, right knowledge and right conduct. Meditation in Jainism aims to reach and to remain in the pure state of soul which is believed to be pure consciousness, beyond any attachment or aversion. The practitioner strives to be just a knower-seer (&quot;gyata-drashta&quot;). Jain meditation can be broadly categorized into &quot;Dharma dhyana&quot; and &quot;Shukla dhyana&quot;. &quot;Dharma dhyana&quot; is discriminating knowledge (bheda-vijñāna) of the tattvas (truths or fundamental principles), while &quot;shukla dhyana&quot; is meditation proper.

Jainism uses meditation techniques such as &quot;pindāstha-dhyāna, padāstha-dhyāna, rūpāstha-dhyāna, rūpātita-dhyāna, and savīrya-dhyāna&quot;. In &quot;padāstha dhyāna,&quot; one focuses on a &quot;mantra,&quot; a combination of core letters or words on deity or themes. Jain followers practice mantra regularly by chanting loudly or silently in mind.

The meditation technique of contemplation includes &quot;agnya vichāya&quot;, in which one contemplates on seven facts – life and non-life, the inflow, bondage, stoppage and removal of &quot;karmas&quot;, and the final accomplishment of liberation. In &quot;apaya vichāya&quot;, one contemplates on the incorrect insights one indulges, which eventually develops right insight. In &quot;vipaka vichāya&quot;, one reflects on the eight causes or basic types of &quot;karma&quot;. In &quot;sansathan vichāya&quot;, one thinks about the vastness of the universe and the loneliness of the soul.

====Buddhism====

Buddhists pursue meditation as part of the path toward awakening and nirvana. The closest words for meditation in the classical languages of Buddhism are &quot;bhāvanā&quot; (&quot;development&quot;), and the core practices of body contemplations (repulsiveness and cemetery contemplations) and &quot;anapanasati&quot; (mindfulness of in-and-out breathing) culminating in &quot;jhāna&quot;/&quot;dhyāna&quot; or &quot;samādhi&quot;.

While most classical and contemporary Buddhist meditation guides are school-specific, the root meditative practices of various body recollections and breath meditation have been preserved and transmitted in almost all Buddhist traditions, through Buddhist texts like the &quot;Satipatthana Sutta&quot; and the Dhyana sutras, and through oral teacher-student transmissions. These ancient practices are supplemented with various distinct interpretations of, and developments in, these practices.

The Theravāda tradition stresses the development of &quot;samatha&quot; and &quot;vipassana&quot;, postulating over fifty methods for developing mindfulness based on the &quot;Satipatthana Sutta&quot;, and forty for developing concentration based on the Visuddhimagga.

The Tibetan tradition incorporated Sarvastivada and Tantric practices, wedded with Madhyamaka philosophy, and developed thousands of visualization meditations.

The Zen tradition incorporated mindfulness and breath-meditation via the Dhyana sutras, which are based on the Sarvastivada-tradition. Sitting meditation, known as zazen, is a central part of Zen practice. Downplaying the &quot;petty complexities&quot; of satipatthana and the body-recollections (but maintaining the awareness of immanent death), the early Chan-tradition developed the notions or practices of &quot;wu nian&quot; (&quot;no thought, no fixation on thought, such as one&#x27;s own views, experiences, and knowledge&quot;) and &quot;fēi sīliàng&quot; (非思量, Japanese: &quot;hishiryō&quot;, &quot;nonthinking&quot;); and &quot;kanxin&quot; (&quot;observing the mind&quot;) and &quot;shou-i pu i&quot; (守一不移, &quot;maintaining the one without wavering,&quot; turning the attention from the objects of experience, to the nature of mind, the perceiving subject itself, which is equated with Buddha-nature.

The Silk Road transmission of Buddhism introduced Buddhist meditation to other Asian countries, reaching China in the 2nd century CE, and Japan in the 6th century CE. In the modern era, Buddhist meditation techniques have become popular in the wider world, due to the influence of Buddhist modernism on Asian Buddhism, and western lay interest in Zen and the Vipassana movement, with many non-Buddhists taking-up meditative practices. The modernized concept of mindfulness (based on the Buddhist term &quot;sati&quot;) and related meditative practices have in turn led to mindfulness based therapies.

=====Dhyana=====
Dhyana, while often presented as a form of focused attention or concentration, as in Buddhagosa&#x27;s Theravada classic the &quot;Visuddhimagga&quot; (&quot;Path of purification&quot;, 5th c. CE), according to a number of contemporary scholars and scholar-practitioners, it is actually a description of the development of perfected equanimity and mindfulness, apparently induced by satipatthana, an open monitoring of the breath, without trying to regulate it. The same description, in a different formula, can be found in the bojjhanga, the &quot;seven factors of awakening,&quot; and may therefore refer to the core program of early Buddhist &quot;bhavana&quot;. According to Vetter, dhyana seems to be a natural development from the sense-restraint and moral constrictions prescribed by the Buddhist tradition.

=====Samatha and vipassana=====
The Buddha identified two paramount mental qualities that arise from wholesome meditative practice or &quot;bhavana&quot;, namely &quot;samatha&quot; (&quot;calm,&quot; &quot;serenity&quot; &quot;tranquility&quot;) and &quot;vipassana&quot; (insight). As the developing tradition started to emphasize the value of liberating insight, and &quot;dhyana&quot; came to be understood as concentration, &quot;samatha&quot; and &quot;vipassana&quot; were understood as two distinct meditative techniques. In this understanding, &quot;samatha&quot; steadies, composes, unifies and concentrates the mind, while &quot;vipassana&quot; enables one to see, explore and discern &quot;formations&quot; (conditioned phenomena based on the five aggregates).

According to this understanding, which is central to Theravada orthodoxy but also plays a role in Tibetan Buddhism, through the meditative development of serenity, one is able to weaken the obscuring hindrances and bring the mind to a collected, pliant, and still state (&quot;samadhi&quot;). This quality of mind then supports the development of insight and wisdom (Prajñā) which is the quality of mind that can &quot;clearly see&quot; (&quot;vi-passana&quot;) the nature of phenomena. What exactly is to be seen varies within the Buddhist traditions. In Theravada, all phenomena are to be seen as impermanent, suffering, not-self and empty. When this happens, one develops dispassion (&quot;viraga&quot;) for all phenomena, including all negative qualities and hindrances and lets them go. It is through the release of the hindrances and ending of craving through the meditative development of insight that one gains liberation.

====Sikhism====
In Sikhism, &quot;simran&quot; (meditation) and good deeds are both necessary to achieve the devotee&#x27;s spiritual goals; without good deeds meditation is futile. When Sikhs meditate, they aim to feel God&#x27;s presence and emerge in the divine light. It is only God&#x27;s divine will or order that allows a devotee to desire to begin to meditate. &quot;Nām japnā&quot; involves focusing one&#x27;s attention on the names or great attributes of God.

=== Taoism ===


Taoist meditation has developed techniques including concentration, visualization, &quot;qi&quot; cultivation, contemplation, and mindfulness meditations in its long history. Traditional Daoist meditative practices influenced Buddhism creating the unique meditative practices of Chinese Buddhism that then spread through the rest of east Asia from around the 5th century.Traditional Chinese medicine and the Chinese martial arts were influenced and influences of Taoist meditation.

Livia Kohn distinguishes three basic types of Taoist meditation: &quot;concentrative&quot;, &quot;insight&quot;, and &quot;visualization&quot;. &quot;Ding&quot; (literally means &quot;decide; settle; stabilize&quot;) refers to &quot;deep concentration&quot;, &quot;intent contemplation&quot;, or &quot;perfect absorption&quot;. &quot;Guan&quot; (lit. &quot;watch; observe; view&quot;) meditation seeks to merge and attain unity with the Dao. It was developed by Tang dynasty (618–907) Taoist masters based upon the &quot;Tiantai&quot; Buddhist practice of &quot;Vipassanā&quot; &quot;insight&quot; or &quot;wisdom&quot; meditation. &quot;Cun&quot; (lit. &quot;exist; be present; survive&quot;) has a sense of &quot;to cause to exist; to make present&quot; in the meditation techniques popularized by the Taoist Shangqing and Lingbao Schools. A meditator visualizes or actualizes solar and lunar essences, lights, and deities within their body, which supposedly results in health and longevity, even &quot;xian&quot; 仙/仚/僊, &quot;immortality&quot;.

The &quot;Guanzi&quot; essay (late 4th century BCE) &quot;Neiye&quot; &quot;Inward training&quot; is the oldest received writing on the subject of &quot;qi&quot; cultivation and breath-control meditation techniques. For instance, &quot;When you enlarge your mind and let go of it, when you relax your vital breath and expand it, when your body is calm and unmoving: And you can maintain the One and discard the myriad disturbances. ... This is called &quot;revolving the vital breath&quot;: Your thoughts and deeds seem heavenly.&quot;

The Taoist &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; (c. 3rd century BCE) records &quot;zuowang&quot; or &quot;sitting forgetting&quot; meditation. Confucius asked his disciple Yan Hui to explain what &quot;sit and forget&quot; means: &quot;I slough off my limbs and trunk, dim my intelligence, depart from my form, leave knowledge behind, and become identical with the Transformational Thoroughfare.&quot;

Taoist meditation practices are central to Chinese martial arts (and some Japanese martial arts), especially the &quot;qi&quot;-related &quot;neijia&quot; &quot;internal martial arts&quot;. Some well-known examples are &quot;daoyin&quot; (&quot;guiding and pulling&quot;), qigong (&quot;life-energy exercises&quot;), &quot;neigong&quot; (&quot;internal exercises&quot;), &quot;neidan&quot; (&quot;internal alchemy&quot;), and tai chi (&quot;great ultimate boxing&quot;), which is thought of as moving meditation. One common explanation contrasts &quot;movement in stillness&quot; referring to energetic visualization of &quot;qi&quot; circulation in qigong and &quot;zuochan&quot; (&quot;seated meditation&quot;), versus &quot;stillness in movement&quot; referring to a state of meditative calm in tai chi forms. Also the unification or middle road forms such as &quot;Wuxingheqidao&quot; that seeks the unification of internal alchemical forms with more external forms.`

===Abrahamic religions===

====Judaism====
Judaism has made use of meditative practices for thousands of years. For instance, in the Torah, the patriarch Isaac is described as going &quot;לשוח&quot; (&quot;lasuach&quot;) in the field – a term understood by all commentators as some type of meditative practice (Genesis 24:63). Similarly, there are indications throughout the Tanakh (the Hebrew Bible) that the prophets meditated. In the Old Testament, there are two Hebrew words for meditation: &quot;hāgâ&quot; (), &quot;to sigh&quot; or &quot;murmur&quot;, but also &quot;to meditate&quot;, and &quot;sîḥâ&quot; (), &quot;to muse&quot;, or &quot;rehearse in one&#x27;s mind&quot;.

Classical Jewish texts espouse a wide range of meditative practices, often associated with the cultivation of &quot;kavanah&quot; or intention. The first layer of rabbinic law, the Mishnah, describes ancient sages &quot;waiting&quot; for an hour before their prayers, &quot;in order to direct their hearts to the Omnipresent One&quot; (Mishnah Berakhot 5:1). Other early rabbinic texts include instructions for visualizing the Divine Presence (B. Talmud Sanhedrin 22a) and breathing with conscious gratitude for every breath (Genesis Rabba 14:9).

One of the best-known types of meditation in early Jewish mysticism was the work of the Merkabah, from the root /R-K-B/ meaning &quot;chariot&quot; (of God). Some meditative traditions have been encouraged in Kabbalah, and some Jews have described Kabbalah as an inherently meditative field of study. Kabbalistic meditation often involves the mental visualization of the supernal realms. Aryeh Kaplan has argued that the ultimate purpose of Kabbalistic meditation is to understand and cleave to the Divine.

Meditation has been of interest to a wide variety of modern Jews. In modern Jewish practice, one of the best known meditative practices is called &quot;hitbodedut&quot; (&quot;התבודדות&quot;, alternatively transliterated as &quot;hisbodedus&quot;), and is explained in Kabbalistic, Hasidic, and Mussar writings, especially the Hasidic method of Rabbi Nachman of Breslav. The word derives from the Hebrew word &quot;boded&quot; (בודד), meaning the state of being alone. Another Hasidic system is the Habad method of &quot;hisbonenus&quot;, related to the Sephirah of &quot;Binah&quot;, Hebrew for understanding. This practice is the analytical reflective process of making oneself understand a mystical concept well, that follows and internalises its study in Hasidic writings. The Musar Movement, founded by Rabbi Israel Salanter in the middle of the nineteenth-century, emphasized meditative practices of introspection and visualization that could help to improve moral character. Conservative rabbi Alan Lew has emphasized meditation playing an important role in the process of &quot;teshuvah&quot; (repentance). Jewish Buddhists have adopted Buddhist styles of meditation.

====Christianity====

Christian meditation is a term for a form of prayer in which a structured attempt is made to get in touch with and deliberately reflect upon the revelations of God. In the Roman Empire, by 20 BCE Philo of Alexandria had written on some form of &quot;spiritual exercises&quot; involving attention (prosoche) and concentration and by the 3rd century Plotinus had developed meditative techniques. The word meditation comes from the Latin word &quot;meditatum&quot;, which means to &quot;concentrate&quot; or &quot;to ponder&quot;. Monk Guigo II introduced this terminology for the first time in the 12th century AD. Christian meditation is the process of deliberately focusing on specific thoughts (e.g. a biblical scene involving Jesus and the Virgin Mary) and reflecting on their meaning in the context of the love of God. Christian meditation is sometimes taken to mean the middle level in a broad three-stage characterization of prayer: it then involves more reflection than first level vocal prayer, but is more structured than the multiple layers of contemplation in Christianity.

Between the 10th and 14th centuries, hesychasm was developed, particularly on Mount Athos in Greece, and involves the repetition of the Jesus prayer. Interactions with Indians or the Sufis may have influenced the Eastern Christian meditation approach to hesychasm, but this is unproven.

Western Christian meditation contrasts with most other approaches in that it does not involve the repetition of any phrase or action and requires no specific posture. Western Christian meditation progressed from the 6th century practice of Bible reading among Benedictine monks called Lectio Divina, i.e. divine reading. Its four formal steps as a &quot;ladder&quot; were defined by the monk Guigo II in the 12th century with the Latin terms &quot;lectio&quot;, &quot;meditatio&quot;, &quot;oratio&quot;, and &quot;contemplatio&quot; (i.e. read, ponder, pray, contemplate). Western Christian meditation was further developed by saints such as Ignatius of Loyola and Teresa of Avila in the 16th century.

On 28 April 2021, Pope Francis, in an address to the General Audience, said that meditation is a need for everyone. He noted that the term &quot;meditation&quot; has had many meanings throughout history, and that &quot;the ancients used to say that the organ of prayer is the heart.&quot;

In Catholic Christianity, the Rosary is a devotion for the meditation of the mysteries of Jesus and Mary. &quot;The gentle repetition of its prayers makes it an excellent means to moving into deeper meditation. It gives us an opportunity to open ourselves to God&#x27;s word, to refine our interior gaze by turning our minds to the life of Christ. The first principle is that meditation is learned through practice. Many people who practice rosary meditation begin very simply and gradually develop a more sophisticated meditation. The meditator learns to hear an interior voice, the voice of God. Similarly, the chotki of the Eastern Orthodox denomination, the Wreath of Christ of the Lutheran faith, and the Anglican prayer beads of the Episcopalian tradition are used for Christian prayer and meditation.

According to Edmund P. Clowney, Christian meditation contrasts with Eastern forms of meditation as radically as the portrayal of God the Father in the Bible contrasts with depictions of Krishna or Brahman in Indian teachings. Unlike some Eastern styles, most styles of Christian meditation do not rely on the repeated use of mantras, and yet are also intended to stimulate thought and deepen meaning. Christian meditation aims to heighten the personal relationship based on the love of God that marks Christian communion. In &quot;Aspects of Christian meditation&quot;, the Catholic Church warned of potential incompatibilities in mixing Christian and Eastern styles of meditation. In 2003, in &quot;A Christian reflection on the New Age&quot; the Vatican announced that the &quot;Church avoids any concept that is close to those of the New Age&quot;.

====Islam====


&quot;Dhikr&quot; (&quot;zikr&quot;) is a type of meditation within Islam, meaning remembering and mentioning God, which involves the repetition of the 99 Names of God since the 8th or 9th century. It is interpreted in different meditative techniques in Sufism or Islamic mysticism. This became one of the essential elements of Sufism as it was systematized traditionally. It is juxtaposed with &quot;fikr&quot; (thinking) which leads to knowledge. By the 12th century, the practice of Sufism included specific meditative techniques, and its followers practiced breathing controls and the repetition of holy words.

Sufism uses a meditative procedure like Buddhist concentration, involving high-intensity and sharply focused introspection. In the Oveyssi-Shahmaghsoudi Sufi order, for example, &quot;muraqabah&quot; takes the form of &quot;tamarkoz&quot;, &quot;concentration&quot; in Persian.

&quot;Tafakkur&quot; or &quot;tadabbur&quot; in Sufism literally means &quot;reflection upon the universe&quot;: this is considered to permit access to a form of cognitive and emotional development that can emanate only from the higher level, i.e. from God. The sensation of receiving divine inspiration awakens and liberates both heart and intellect, permitting such inner growth that the apparently mundane actually takes on the quality of the infinite. Muslim teachings embrace life as a test of one&#x27;s submission to God.
Dervishes of certain Sufi orders practice whirling, a form of physically active meditation.

====Baháʼí Faith====
In the teachings of the Baháʼí Faith, which derives from an Islamic context but is universalist in orientation, meditation is a primary tool for spiritual development, involving reflection on the words of God. While prayer and meditation are linked, where meditation happens generally in a prayerful attitude, prayer is seen specifically as turning toward God, and meditation is seen as a communion with one&#x27;s self where one focuses on the divine.

In Baháʼí teachings the purpose of meditation is to strengthen one&#x27;s understanding of the words of God, and to make one&#x27;s soul more susceptible to their potentially transformative power, more receptive to the need for both prayer and meditation to bring about and maintain a spiritual communion with God.

Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh, the founder of the religion, never specified any particular form of meditation, and thus each person is free to choose their own form. However, he did state that Baháʼís should read a passage of the Baháʼí writings twice a day, once in the morning, and once in the evening, and meditate on it. He also encouraged people to reflect on one&#x27;s actions and worth at the end of each day. During the Nineteen Day Fast, a period of the year during which Baháʼís adhere to a sunrise-to-sunset fast, they meditate and pray to reinvigorate their spiritual forces.

===Modern spirituality===
====Modern dissemination in the West====
Meditation has spread in the West since the late 19th century, accompanying increased travel and communication among cultures worldwide. Most prominent has been the transmission of Asian-derived practices to the West. In addition, interest in some Western-based meditative practices has been revived, and these have been disseminated to a limited extent to Asian countries.

Ideas about Eastern meditation had begun &quot;seeping into American popular culture even before the American Revolution through the various sects of European occult Christianity&quot;, and such ideas &quot;came pouring in [to America] during the era of the transcendentalists, especially between the 1840s and the 1880s.&quot; The following decades saw further spread of these ideas to America:


More recently, in the 1960s, another surge in Western interest in meditative practices began. The rise of communist political power in Asia led to many Asian spiritual teachers taking refuge in Western countries, oftentimes as refugees. In addition to spiritual forms of meditation, secular forms of meditation have taken root. Rather than focusing on spiritual growth, secular meditation emphasizes stress reduction, relaxation and self-improvement.

The 2012 US National Health Interview Survey of 34,525 subjects found that 8% of US adults used meditation, with lifetime and 12-month prevalence of meditation use of 5.2% and 4.1% respectively. Meditation use among workers was 10% (up from 8% in 2002).

Mantra meditation, with the use of a &quot;japa mala&quot; and especially with focus on the Hare Krishna maha-mantra, is a central practice of the Gaudiya Vaishnava faith tradition and the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, also known as the Hare Krishna movement. Other popular New Religious Movements include the Ramakrishna Mission, Vedanta Society, Divine Light Mission, Chinmaya Mission, Osho, Sahaja Yoga, Transcendental Meditation, Oneness University, Brahma Kumaris, Vihangam Yoga and Heartfulness Meditation (Sahaj Marg).

====New Age====
New Age meditations are often influenced by Eastern philosophy, mysticism, yoga, Hinduism and Buddhism, yet may contain some degree of Western influence. In the West, meditation found its mainstream roots through the social revolution of the 1960s and 1970s, when many of the youth of the day rebelled against traditional religion as a reaction against what some perceived as the failure of Christianity to provide spiritual and ethical guidance. New Age meditation as practised by the early hippies is regarded for its techniques of blanking out the mind and releasing oneself from conscious thinking. This is often aided by repetitive chanting of a mantra, or focusing on an object. New Age meditation evolved into a range of purposes and practices, from serenity and balance to access to other realms of consciousness to the concentration of energy in group meditation to the supreme goal of &quot;samadhi&quot;, as in the ancient yogic practice of meditation.

====Guided meditation====
Guided meditation is a form of meditation which uses a number of different techniques to achieve or enhance the meditative state. It may simply be meditation done under the guidance of a trained practitioner or teacher, or it may be through the use of imagery, music, and other techniques. The session can be either in person, via media comprising music or verbal instruction, or a combination of both. The most common form is a combination of meditation music and receptive music therapy, guided imagery, relaxation, mindfulness, and journaling.

Because of the different combinations used under the one term, it can be difficult to attribute positive or negative outcomes to any of the various techniques. Furthermore, the term is frequently used interchangeably with &quot;guided imagery&quot; and sometimes with &quot;creative visualization&quot; in popular psychology and self-help literature. It is less commonly used in scholarly and scientific publications. Consequently, guided meditation cannot be understood as a single technique but rather multiple techniques that are integral to its practice.

Guided meditation as an aggregate or synthesis of techniques includes meditation music, receptive music therapy, guided imagery, relaxation, meditative praxis, and self-reflective journaling, all of which have been shown to have therapeutic benefits when employed as an adjunct to primary strategies. Benefits include lower levels of stress, reducing asthmatic episodes, physical pain, insomnia, episodic anger, negative or irrational thinking, and anxiety, as well as improving coping skills, focus, and a general feeling of well-being.

== Effects ==
Research on the processes and effects of meditation is a subfield of neurological research. Modern scientific techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography, were used to observe neurological responses during meditation. Concerns have been raised on the quality of meditation research, including the particular characteristics of individuals who tend to participate.

Meditation lowers heart rate, oxygen consumption, breathing frequency, stress hormones, lactate levels, and sympathetic nervous system activity (associated with the fight-or-flight response), along with a modest decline in blood pressure. However, those who have meditated for two or three years were found to already have low blood pressure. During meditation, the oxygen consumption decrease averages 10 to 20 percent over the first three minutes. During sleep for example, oxygen consumption decreases around 8 percent over four or five hours. For meditators who have practiced for years, breath rate can drop to three or four breaths per minute and &quot;brain waves slow from the usual beta (seen in waking activity) or alpha (seen in normal relaxation) to much slower delta and theta waves&quot;.

Studies demonstrate that meditation has a moderate effect to reduce pain. There is insufficient evidence for any effect of meditation on positive mood, attention, eating habits, sleep, or body weight.

Luberto er all (2017), in a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of meditation on empathy, compassion, and prosocial behaviors, found that meditation practices had small to medium effects on self-reported and observable outcomes, concluding that such practices can &quot;improve positive prosocial emotions and behaviors&quot;. However, a meta-review published on &quot;Scientific Reports&quot; showed that the evidence is very weak and &quot;that the effects of meditation on compassion were only significant when compared to passive control groups suggests that other forms of active interventions (like watching a nature video) might produce similar outcomes to meditation&quot;.

==&quot;Challenging&quot; and adverse effects==
===Contemplative traditions===
Throughout East Asia the detrimental and undesirable effects of incorrect meditation and mindfulness practice are well documented due to the long varied history of cultivation in these fields. Many traditional herbal, intentional and manual treatments have been prescribed from the past to present day for what is diagnosed as &quot;zouhuorumo&quot; ().

Meditation may induce &quot;challenging&quot; and &quot;unwanted&quot; experiences, and adverse effects to physical and mental health. Some of these experiences and effects are documented in the contemplative traditions, but can be quite perplexing and burdensome when the outcomes of meditation are expected to result in more advantageous and beneficial health outcomes than detrimental ones. By extension this problem is compounded with little or no support or explanatory framework publicly for novice or laity that is easily accessible for a practitioner to know when it is appropriate to self manage or when it is advisable to seek professional advice on the adverse symptomatology that may arise in this field of self-cultivation .

According to Farias et al. (2020), the most common adverse effects are in people with a history of anxiety and depression. Other adverse psychological symptoms may include narcissistic, sociopathic behaviour and depersonalization or altered sense of self or the world, distorted emotions or thoughts, a mild form of psychosis including auditory and visual hallucinations. In extreme cases in patients with underlying undiagnosed or historical emotional conditions there have been instances of self-harm.

According to Schlosser et al. (2019), &quot;preliminary findings suggest that their occurrence is highly dependent on a complex interaction of contextual factors.&quot; For instance, meditation-related psychosis has been linked to sleep deprivation, preceding mental dispositions, and meditation without sufficient social support or any explanatory framework. However, according to Farias et al. (2020), &quot;minor adverse effects have been observed in individuals with no previous history of mental health problems&quot;) Farias et al. (2020) further note that &quot;it is also possible that participants predisposed to heightened levels of anxiety and depression are more likely to begin or maintain a meditation practice to manage their symptoms.&quot;

According to Farias et al. (2020) there is a prevalence of 8.3% adverse effects, &quot;similar to those reported for psychotherapy practice in general.&quot; Schlosser et al. (2019) reported that of 1,232 regular meditators with at least two months of meditation experience, about a quarter reported having had particularly unpleasant meditation-related experiences which they thought may have been caused by their meditation practice. Meditators with high levels of repetitive negative thinking and those who only engage in deconstructive meditation (vipassana/insight meditation) were more likely to report unpleasant side effects.

The appraisal of the experiences may be determined by the framework used to interpret these experiences. Schlosser et al. &quot;found strong evidence that religious participants have lower odds of having particularly unpleasant meditation-related experiences,&quot; and &quot;found weak evidence that female participants were less likely to have unpleasant meditation-related experiences,&quot; and note the importance of &quot;understanding when these experiences are constitutive elements of meditative practice rather than merely negative effects.&quot;

Difficult experiences encountered in meditation are mentioned in traditional sources, and some may be considered to be an expected part of the process. According to Salguero,
The Visuddhimagga mentions various unpleasant stages, and possible &quot;unwholesome or frightening visions&quot; are mentioned in &quot;Practical Insight Meditation: Basic and Progressive Stages&quot;, a practical manual on vipassanā meditation by Mahāsi Sayādaw. Classical sources mention &quot;makyō&quot;, Zen sickness () and related difficulties, such as &quot;zouhuorumo&quot; (), and &quot;mojing&quot; (). Traditional sources also precribe cures against these experiences, for example Hakuin Ekaku&#x27;s treatment of Zen-sickness.

===Mindfulness===
Both the soundness of the scientific foundations of mindfulness, and the desirability of its social effects, have been questioned. Hafenbrack et al. (2022), in a study on mindfulness with 1400 participants, found that focused-breathing meditation can dampen the relationship between transgressions and the desire to engage in reparative prosocial behaviors. Poullin et al. (2021) found that mindfulness can increase the trait of selfishness. The study, consisting of two interrelated parts and totaling 691 participants, found that a mindfulness induction, compared to a control condition, led to decreased prosocial behavior. This effect was moderated by self-construals such that people with relatively independent self-construals became less prosocial while people with relatively interdependent self-construals became more so. In the western world where independent self-construals generally predominate (self centric orientated) meditation may thus have potentially detrimental effects. These new findings about meditations socially problematic effects imply that it can be contraindicated to use meditation as a tool to handle acute personal conflicts or relational difficulties; in the words of Andrew Hafenbrack, one of the authors of the study, &quot;If we &#x27;artificially&#x27; reduce our guilt by meditating it away, we may end up with worse relationships, or even fewer relationships&quot;.

== Secular applications ==

=== Psychotherapy ===

Carl Jung (1875–1961) was an early western explorer of eastern religious practices. He clearly advocated ways to increase the conscious awareness of an individual. Yet he expressed some caution concerning a westerner&#x27;s direct immersion in eastern practices without some prior appreciation of the differing spiritual and cultural contexts. Erich Fromm (1900–1980) later explored spiritual practices of the east.

=== Clinical ===
Since the 1970s, clinical psychology and psychiatry have developed meditation techniques for numerous psychological conditions. Mindfulness practice is employed in psychology to alleviate mental and physical conditions, such as affecting the endocrine system therefore reducing depression, and helping to alleviate stress, and anxiety. Mindfulness is also used as a form of interventional therapy in the treatment of addiction including drug addiction, although the quantity and quality of evidence based research has been poor.

The US National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health states that &quot;Meditation and mindfulness practices may have a variety of health benefits and may help people improve the quality of their lives. Recent studies have investigated if meditation or mindfulness helps people manage anxiety, stress, depression, pain, or symptoms related to withdrawal from nicotine, alcohol, or opioids.&quot; However, the NCCIC goes on to caution that, &quot;results from the studies have been difficult to analyze and may have been interpreted too optimistically.&quot;

A 2014 review found that practice of mindfulness meditation for two to six months by people undergoing long-term psychiatric or medical therapy could produce moderate improvements in pain management, anxiety, depression. In 2017, the American Heart Association issued a scientific statement that meditation may be a reasonable adjunct practice and intervention to help reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases, with the qualification that meditation needs to be better defined in higher-quality clinical research of these disorders. Recent findings have also found evidence of meditation affecting migraines in adults. Mindfulness meditation may allow for a decrease in migraine episodes, and a drop in migraine medication usage.

Early low-quality and low- quantity evidence indicates that the mechanism of meditation may help with irritable bowel syndrome, insomnia, cognitive decline in the elderly, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Sitting in silence, body scan meditation and concentrating on breathing was shown in a 2016 review to moderately decrease symptoms of PTSD and depression in war veterans and creating resilience to stresses in active service. Researchers have found that participating in mindfulness meditation can aid insomnia patients by improving sleep quality and total wake time. Mindfulness meditation is a supportive therapy that aides in the treatment for patients diagnosed with insomnia.

=== In the workplace ===
A 2010 review of the literature on spirituality and performance in organizations found an increase in corporate meditation programs.

As of 2016 around a quarter of U.S. employers were using stress reduction initiatives. The goal was to help reduce stress and improve reactions to stress. Aetna now offers its program to its customers. Google also implements mindfulness, offering more than a dozen meditation courses, with the most prominent one, &quot;Search Inside Yourself&quot;, having been implemented since 2007. General Mills offers the Mindful Leadership Program Series, a course which uses a combination of mindfulness meditation, yoga and dialogue with the intention of developing the mind&#x27;s capacity to pay attention.

Many military organizations around the world have found meditation and mindfulness practice can support a range of benefits related to combat, including support for mental health, mental clarity, focus and stress control.

=== In school ===
A review of 15 peer-reviewed studies of youth meditation in schools indicated transcendental meditation a moderate effect on wellbeing and a small effect on social competence. Insufficient research has been done on the effect of meditation on academic achievement. Evidence has also shown possible improvement to stress, cognitive performance in school taught meditation.

Positive effects on emotion regulation, stress and anxiety can also be seen in students in university and nursing.

===Relaxation response and biofeedback===
Herbert Benson of Harvard Medical School conducted a series of clinical tests on meditators from various disciplines, including the Transcendental Meditation technique and Tibetan Buddhism. In 1975, Benson published a book titled &quot;The Relaxation Response&quot; where he outlined his own version of meditation for relaxation. Also in the 1970s, the American psychologist Patricia Carrington developed a similar technique called Clinically Standardized Meditation (CSM). In Norway, another sound-based method called Acem Meditation developed a psychology of meditation and has been the subject of several scientific studies.

Biofeedback has been used by many researchers since the 1950s in an effort to enter deeper states of mind.

<text>MPEG-4 is a group of international standards for the compression of digital audio and visual data, multimedia systems, and file storage formats. It was originally introduced in late 1998 as a group of audio and video coding formats and related technology agreed upon by the ISO/IEC Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC29/WG11) under the formal standard ISO/IEC 14496 – &quot;Coding of audio-visual objects&quot;. Uses of MPEG-4 include compression of audiovisual data for Internet video and CD distribution, voice (telephone, videophone) and broadcast television applications. The MPEG-4 standard was developed by a group led by Touradj Ebrahimi (later the JPEG president) and Fernando Pereira.

==Background==
MPEG-4 absorbs many of the features of MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 and other related standards, adding new features such as (extended) VRML support for 3D rendering, object-oriented composite files (including audio, video and VRML objects), support for externally specified digital rights management and various types of interactivity. AAC (Advanced Audio Coding) was standardized as an adjunct to MPEG-2 (as Part 1) before MPEG-4 was issued.

MPEG-4 is still an evolving standard and is divided into a number of parts. Companies promoting MPEG-4 compatibility do not always clearly state which &quot;part&quot; level compatibility they are referring to. The key parts to be aware of are MPEG-4 Part 2 (including Advanced Simple Profile, used by codecs such as DivX, Xvid, Nero Digital, RealMedia, 3ivx, H.263 and by QuickTime 6) and MPEG-4 part 10 (MPEG-4 AVC/H.264 or Advanced Video Coding, used by the x264 encoder, Nero Digital AVC, QuickTime 7, Flash Video, and high-definition video media like Blu-ray Disc).

Most of the features included in MPEG-4 are left to individual developers to decide whether or not to implement. This means that there are probably no complete implementations of the entire MPEG-4 set of standards. To deal with this, the standard includes the concept of &quot;profiles&quot; and &quot;levels&quot;, allowing a specific set of capabilities to be defined in a manner appropriate for a subset of applications.

Initially, MPEG-4 was aimed primarily at low-bit-rate video communications; however, its scope as a multimedia coding standard was later expanded. MPEG-4 is efficient across a variety of bit rates ranging from a few kilobits per second to tens of megabits per second. MPEG-4 provides the following functions:
* Improved coding efficiency over MPEG-2
* Ability to encode mixed media data (video, audio, speech)
* Error resilience to enable robust transmission
* Ability to interact with the audio-visual scene generated at the receiver

==Overview==
MPEG-4 provides a series of technologies for developers, for various service-providers and for end users:

* MPEG-4 enables different software and hardware developers to create multimedia objects possessing better abilities of adaptability and flexibility to improve the quality of such services and technologies as digital television, animation graphics, the World Wide Web and their extensions.
* Data network providers can use MPEG-4 for data transparency. With the help of standard procedures, MPEG-4 data can be interpreted and transformed into other signal types compatible with any available network.
* The MPEG-4 format provides end users with a wide range of interaction with various animated objects.
* Standardized digital rights management signaling, otherwise known in the MPEG community as Intellectual Property Management and Protection (IPMP).

The MPEG-4 format can perform various functions, among which might be the following:

* Multiplexes and synchronizes data, associated with media objects, in such a way that they can be efficiently transported further via network channels.
* Interaction with the audio-visual scene, which is formed on the side of the receiver.

===Profiles and Levels===
MPEG-4 provides a large and rich set of tools for encoding.
Subsets of the MPEG-4 tool sets have been provided for use in specific applications.
These subsets, called &#x27;Profiles&#x27;, limit the size of the tool set a decoder is required to implement. In order to restrict computational complexity, one or more &#x27;Levels&#x27; are set for each Profile. A Profile and Level combination allows:
* A codec builder to implement only the subset of the standard needed, while maintaining interworking with other MPEG-4 devices that implement the same combination.
* Checking whether MPEG-4 devices comply with the standard, referred to as conformance testing.

==MPEG-4 Parts==
MPEG-4 consists of several standards—termed &quot;parts&quot;—including the following (each part covers a certain aspect of the whole specification):

Profiles are also defined within the individual &quot;parts&quot;, so an implementation of a part is ordinarily not an implementation of an entire part.

MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG-7 and MPEG-21 are other suites of MPEG standards.

==Licensing==
MPEG-4 contains patented technologies, the use of which requires licensing in countries that acknowledge software algorithm patents. Over two dozen companies claim to have patents covering MPEG-4. MPEG LA licenses patents required for MPEG-4 Part 2 Visual from a wide range of companies (audio is licensed separately) and lists all of its licensors and licensees on the site. New licenses for MPEG-4 System patents are under development and no new licenses are being offered while holders of its old MPEG-4 Systems license are still covered under the terms of that license for the patents listed.

The majority of patents used for the MPEG-4 Visual format are held by three Japanese companies: Mitsubishi Electric (255 patents), Hitachi (206 patents), and Panasonic (200 patents).

<text>Maritime archaeology (also known as marine archaeology) is a discipline within archaeology as a whole that specifically studies human interaction with the sea, lakes and rivers through the study of associated physical remains, be they vessels, shore-side facilities, port-related structures, cargoes, human remains and submerged landscapes. A specialty within maritime archaeology is nautical archaeology, which studies ship construction and use.

As with archaeology as a whole, maritime archaeology can be practised within the historical, industrial, or prehistoric periods. An associated discipline, and again one that lies within archaeology itself, is underwater archaeology, which studies the past through any submerged remains be they of maritime interest or not. An example from the prehistoric era would be the remains of submerged settlements or deposits now lying under water despite having been dry land when sea levels were lower. The study of submerged aircraft lost in lakes, rivers or in the sea is an example from the historical, industrial or modern era. Another example are the remains of discovered and potential medieval bridges connecting the islands on the lake with the mainland. Many specialist sub-disciplines within the broader maritime and underwater archaeological categories have emerged in recent years.

Maritime archaeological sites often result from shipwrecks or sometimes seismic activity, and thus represent a moment in time rather than a slow deposition of material accumulated over a period of years, as is the case with port-related structures (such as piers, wharves, docks and jetties) where objects are lost or thrown off structures over extended periods of time. This fact has led to shipwrecks often being described in the media and in popular accounts as &#x27;time capsules&#x27;.

Archaeological material in the sea or in other underwater environments is typically subject to different factors than artifacts on land. However, as with terrestrial archaeology, what survives to be investigated by modern archaeologists can often be a tiny fraction of the material originally deposited. A feature of maritime archaeology is that despite all the material that is lost, there are occasional rare examples of substantial survival, from which a great deal can be learned, due to the difficulties often experienced in accessing the sites.

There are those in the archaeology community who see maritime archaeology as a separate discipline with its own concerns (such as shipwrecks) and requiring the specialized skills of the underwater archaeologist. Others value an integrated approach, stressing that nautical activity has economic and social links to communities on land and that archaeology is archaeology no matter where the study is conducted. All that is required is the mastering of skills specific to the environment in which the work occurs.

==Integrating land and sea==
Before the industrial era, travel by water was often easier than over land. As a result, marine channels, navigable rivers and sea crossings formed the trade routes of historic and ancient civilisations. For example, the Mediterranean Sea was known to the Romans as the inner sea because the Roman Empire spread around its coasts. The historic record as well as the remains of harbours, ships and cargoes, testify to the volume of trade that crossed it. Later, nations with a strong maritime culture such as the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Denmark, Portugal and Spain were able to establish colonies on other continents. Wars were fought at sea over the control of important resources. The material cultural remains that are discovered by maritime archaeologists along former trade routes can be combined with historical documents and material cultural remains found on land to understand the economic, social and political environment of the past. Of late maritime archaeologists have been examining the submerged cultural remains of China, India, Korea and other Asian nations.

==Preservation of material underwater==

There are significant differences in the survival of archaeological material depending on whether a site is wet or dry, on the nature of the chemical environment, on the presence of biological organisms and on the dynamic forces present. Thus rocky coastlines, especially in shallow water, are typically inimical to the survival of artifacts, which can be dispersed, smashed or ground by the effect of currents and surf, possibly (but not always) leaving an artifact pattern but little if any wreck structure.

Saltwater is particularly inimical to iron artefacts including metal shipwrecks, and sea organisms will readily consume organic material such as wooden shipwrecks. On the other hand, out of all the thousands of potential archaeological sites destroyed or grossly eroded by such natural processes, occasionally sites survive with exceptional preservation of a related collection of artifacts. An example of such a collection is . Survival in this instance is largely due to the remains being buried in sediment

Of the many examples where the sea bed provides an extremely hostile environment for submerged evidence of history, one of the most notable, , though a relatively young wreck and in deep water so calcium-starved that concretion does not occur, appears strong and relatively intact, though indications are that it has already incurred irreversible degradation of her steel and iron hull. As such degradation inevitably continues, data will be forever lost, objects&#x27; context will be destroyed and the bulk of the wreck will over centuries completely deteriorate on the floor of the Atlantic Ocean. Comparative evidence shows that all iron and steel ships, especially those in a highly oxygenated environment, continue to degrade and will continue to do so until only their engines and other machinery project much above the sea-floor. Where it remains even after the passage of time, the iron or steel hull is often fragile with no remaining metal within the layer of concretion and corrosion products. , having been found in the 1970s, was subjected to a program of attempted &quot;in situ&quot; preservation, for example, but deterioration of the vessel progressed at such a rate that the rescue of her turret was undertaken lest nothing be saved from the wreck.

Some wrecks, lost to natural obstacles to navigation, are at risk of being smashed by subsequent wrecks sunk by the same hazard, or are deliberately destroyed because they present a hazard to navigation. Even in deep water, commercial activities such as pipe-laying operations and deep sea trawling can place a wreck at risk. Such a wreck is the &quot;Mardi Gras&quot; shipwreck sunk in the Gulf of Mexico in of water. The shipwreck lay forgotten at the bottom of the sea until it was discovered in 2002 by an oilfield inspection crew working for the Okeanos Gas Gathering Company (OGGC). Large pipelines can crush sites and render some of their remnants inaccessible as pipe is dropped from the ocean surface to the substrate thousands of feet below. Trawl nets snag and tear superstructures and separate artifacts from their context.
The wrecks, and other archaeological sites that have been preserved have generally survived because the dynamic nature of the sea bed can result in artifacts becoming rapidly buried in sediments. These sediments then provide an anaerobic environment which protects from further degradation. Wet environments, whether on land in the form of peat bogs and wells, or underwater are particularly important for the survival of organic material, such as wood, leather, fabric and horn. Cold and absence of light also aid survival of artifacts, because there is little energy available for either organic activity or chemical reactions. Salt water provides for greater organic activity than freshwater, and in particular, the shipworm, &quot;Teredo navalis&quot;, lives only in salt water, so some of the best preservation in the absence of sediments has been found in the cold, dark waters of the Great Lakes in North America and in the (low salinity) Baltic Sea (where &quot;Vasa&quot; was preserved).

While the land surface is continuously reused by societies, the sea bed was largely inaccessible until the advent of submarines, scuba equipment and remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs) in the twentieth century. Salvagers have operated in much earlier times, but much of the material was beyond the reach of anyone. Thus &quot;Mary Rose&quot; was subject to salvage from the sixteenth century and later, but a very large amount of material, buried in the sediments, remained to be found by maritime archaeologists of the twentieth century.

While preservation in situ is not assured, material that has survived underwater and is then recovered to land is typically in an unstable state and can only be preserved using highly specialised conservation processes. While the wooden structure of &quot;Mary Rose&quot; and the individual artifacts have been undergoing conservation since their recovery, provides an example of a relatively recent (metal) wreck for which extensive conservation has been necessary to preserve the hull. While the hull remains intact, its machinery remains inoperable. The engine of that was recovered in 1985 from a saline environment after over a century underwater is presently considered somewhat anomalous, in that after two decades of treatment it can now be turned over by hand.

A challenge for the modern archaeologist is to consider whether &quot;in-situ&quot; preservation, or recovery and conservation on land is the preferable option; or to face the fact that preservation in any form, other than as an archaeological record is not feasible. A site that has been discovered has typically been subjected to disturbance of the very factors that caused its survival in the first place, for example, when a covering of sediment has been removed by storms or the action of man. Active monitoring and deliberate protection may mitigate further rapid destruction making &quot;in situ&quot; preservation an option, but long-term survival can never be guaranteed. For very many sites, the costs are too great for either active measures to ensure &quot;in situ&quot; preservation or to provide for satisfactory conservation on recovery. Even the cost of proper and complete archaeological investigation may be too great to enable this to occur within a timescale that ensures that an archaeological record is made before data is inevitably lost.

==Submerged sites==

===Prehistoric landscapes===
Maritime archaeology studies prehistorical objects and sites that are, because of changes in climate and geology, now underwater.

Bodies of water, fresh and saline, have been important sources of food for people for as long as we have existed. It should be no surprise that ancient villages were located at the water&#x27;s edge. Since the last ice age sea level has risen as much as .

Therefore, a great deal of the record of human activity throughout the Ice Age is now to be found under water.

The flooding of the area now known as the Black Sea (when a land bridge, where the Bosporus is now, collapsed under the pressure of rising water in the Mediterranean Sea) submerged a great deal of human activity that had been gathered round what had been an enormous, fresh-water lake.

Significant cave art sites off the coast of western Europe such as the Grotto Cosquer can be reached only by diving, because the cave entrances are underwater, though the upper portions of the caves themselves are not flooded.

===Historic sites===

Throughout history, seismic events have at times caused submergence of human settlements. The remains of such catastrophes exist all over the world, and sites such as Alexandria, Port Royal and Mary Rose now form important archaeological sites that are being protected, managed and conserved. As with shipwrecks, archaeological research can follow multiple themes, including evidence of the final catastrophe, the structures and landscape before the catastrophe and the culture and economy of which it formed a part. Unlike the wrecking of a ship, the destruction of a town by a seismic event can take place over many years and there may be evidence for several phases of damage, sometimes with rebuilding in between.

==Archaeological diving==

Archaeological diving is a type of scientific diving used as a method of survey and excavation in underwater archaeology. The first known use of the method comes from 1446, when Leon Battista Alberti explored and attempted to lift the ships of Emperor Caligula in Lake Nemi, Italy. Just a few decades later, in 1535, the same site saw the first use of a sophisticated breathing apparatus for archaeological purposes, when Guglielmo de Lorena and Frances de Marchi used an early diving bell to explore and retrieve material from the lake, although they decided to keep the blueprint of the exact mechanism secret. The following three centuries saw the gradual extension of diving time through the use of bells and submersing barrels filled with air. In the 19th century, the standard copper helmet diving gear was developed, allowing divers to stay underwater for extended periods through a constant air supply pumped down from the surface through a hose. Nevertheless, the widespread utilisation of diving gear for archaeological purposes had to wait until the 20th century, when archaeologists began to appreciate the wealth of material that could be found under the water. This century also saw further advances in technology, most important being the invention of the aqualung by Émile Gagnan and Jacques-Yves Cousteau, the latter of whom would go on to use the technology for underwater excavation by 1948. Modern archaeologists use two kinds of equipment to provide breathing gas underwater: self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA), which allows for greater mobility but limits the time the diver can spend in the water, and Surface-supplied diving equipment (SSDE or SSBA), which is safer but more expensive, and airline, or hookah equipment, a basic form of surface supplied equipment with limited depth applications. Both open circuit and rebreather scuba have been used, depending on which is best suited to the site.

===Equipment and procedures===

*Position fixing of the site datum. Various methods were used historically, but DGPS is relatively accurate and available.
*Site survey and mapping, and recording of artifact positioning relative to a datum. This may be done manually or with the aid of high resolution multibeam sonar and photogrammetry
*Excavation:
**Manual excavation.
**Use of airlift dredges
**Hydraulic powered suction dredges to remove silt lifted by fanning, to be deposited downcurrent.
**Silt and sand blowers can be useful if the current removes the lifted material before it settles, but must be used with discretion as artifacts may be entrained in the flow if it is too strong.
*Recording
*Artifact recovery and conservation.
Relatively recent developments, mainly for special circumstances:
*First person point of view video recordings by each diver keep continuous record of work done.
*Daily photogrammetry to record state of site in detail, stratigraphy, and for dive planning.
*360° cameras.
*Diving rebreathers.
*Saturation diving,
*Atmospheric diving suits

===Depth of sites===
The depth of sites can vary within the range of ocean depth, but most sites that are accessible to diving work are relatively shallow.

The wreck of a Phoenician ship off the coast of Malta at a depth of about has been partially excavated by divers using rebreather equipment, using techniques developed for the purpose to make the most effective use of time on site, which was restricted to 3 shifts of 12 minute each per day on site. The site of the wreck of the USS Monitor is near Cape Hatteras at depth at coordinates . When it was realised that recovering the whole vessel was not economically viable, work was done by saturation divers to recover the propeller, engine and turret.

The Exosuit, a relatively lightweight and low powered Atmospheic diving suit intended for marine research. was first used in 2014 at the Bluewater and Antikythera underwater research expeditions.

==Coastal and foreshore==

Not all maritime sites are underwater. There are many structures at the margin of land and water that provide evidence of the human societies of the past. Some are deliberately created for access - such as bridges and walkways. Other structures remain from exploitation of resources, such as dams and fish traps. Nautical remains include early harbours and places where ships were built or repaired. At the end of their life, ships were often beached. Valuable or easily accessed timber has often been salvaged leaving just a few frames and bottom planking.

Archaeological sites can also be found on the foreshore today that would have been on dry land when they were constructed. An example of such a site is Seahenge, a Bronze Age timber circle.

==Ships and shipwrecks==

The archaeology of shipwrecks can be divided into a three-tier hierarchy, of which the first tier considers the wrecking process itself: how does a ship break up, how does a ship sink to the bottom, and how do the remains of the ship, cargo and the surrounding environment evolve over time? The second tier studies the ship as a machine, both in itself and in a military or economic system. The third tier consists of the archaeology of maritime cultures, in which nautical technology, naval warfare, trade and shipboard societies are studied. Some consider this to be the most important tier. Ships and boats are not necessarily wrecked: some are deliberately abandoned, scuttled or beached. Many such abandoned vessels have been extensively salvaged.

===Bronze Age===
The earliest boats discovered date from the Bronze Age and are constructed of hollowed out logs or sewn planks. Vessels have been discovered where they have been preserved in sediments underwater or in waterlogged land sites, such as the discovery of a canoe near St Botolphs. Examples of sewn-plank boats include those found at North Ferriby and the Dover Bronze Age Boat which is now displayed at Dover Museum. These may be an evolution from boats made of sewn hides, but it is highly unlikely that hide boats could have survived.

Ships wrecked in the sea have probably not survived, although remains of cargo (particularly bronze material) have been discovered, such as those at the Salcombe B site. A close collection of artefacts on the sea bed may imply that artefacts were from a ship, even if there are no remains of the actual vessel.

Late Bronze Age ships, such as the Uluburun Shipwreck have been discovered in the Mediterranean, constructed of edge joined planks. This shipbuilding technology continued through the classical period. The 2023 announcement of the Orca Shipwreck is considered the earliest deep-sea shipwreck to be discovered.

==Maritime archaeology by region==
===Pacific===
An example of maritime archaeology in the Pacific Ocean is the discovery of the wreck of &quot;Two Brothers&quot;, discovered in 2008 by a team of marine archaeologists working on an expedition for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The identity of the ship was not immediately known so it was called the &quot;Shark Island Whaler&quot;; the ship&#x27;s identification as &quot;Two Brothers&quot; was announced by NOAA on February 11, 2011, the 188th anniversary of her sinking. The wreck is the first discovery of a wrecked Nantucket whaling ship.

Nine historic trade ships carrying ceramics dating back to the 10th century until the 19th century were excavated under Swedish engineer Sten Sjöstrand in the South China Sea.

* &quot;Royal Nanhai&quot; (circa 1460), found in 1995
* &quot;Nanyang&quot; (circa 1380), found in 1995
* &quot;Xuande&quot; (circa 1540), found in 1995
* &quot;Longquan&quot; (circa 1400), found in 1996
* &quot;Turiang&quot; (circa 1370), found in 1996
* &quot;Singtai&quot; (circa 1550), found in 1998
* &quot;Desaru&quot; (circa 1830), found in 2001
* &quot;Tanjong Simpang&quot; (AD 960- 1127), found in 2001
* &quot;Wanli&quot; (early 17th century), found in 2003

===Mediterranean area===

In the Mediterranean area, maritime archaeologists have investigated several ancient cultures. Notable early Iron Age shipwrecks include two Phoenician ships of c. 750 BC that foundered off Gaza with cargoes of wine in amphoras. The crew of the U.S. Navy deep submergence research submarine NR-1 discovered the sites in 1997. In 1999 a team led by Robert Ballard and Harvard University archaeology Professor Lawrence Stager investigated the wrecks.

Extensive research has been carried out on the Mediterranean and Aegean coastlines of Turkey. Complete excavations have been performed on several wrecks from the Classical, Hellenistic, Byzantine, and Ottoman periods.

Maritime archaeological studies in Italy illuminate the naval and maritime activities of the Etruscans, Greek colonists, and Romans. After the 2nd century BC, the Roman fleet ruled the Mediterranean and actively suppressed piracy. During this Pax Romana, seaborne trade increased significantly throughout the region. Though sailing was the safest, fastest, and most efficient method of transportation in the ancient world, some fractional percentage of voyages ended in shipwreck. With the significantly increased sea traffic during the Roman era came a corresponding increase in shipwrecks. These wrecks and their cargo remains offer glimpses through time of the economy, culture, and politics of the ancient world. Particularly useful to archaeologists are studies of amphoras, the ceramic shipping containers used in the Mediterranean region from the 15th century BC through the Medieval period.

In addition to many discoveries in the sea, some wrecks have been examined in lakes. Most notable are Caligula&#x27;s pleasure barges in Lake Nemi, Italy. The Nemi ships and other shipwreck sites occasionally yield objects of unique artistic value. For instance, the Antikythera wreck contained a staggering collection of marble and bronze statues including the Antikythera Youth. Discovered in 1900 by Greek sponge divers, the ship probably sank in the 1st century BC and may have been dispatched by the Roman general, Sulla, to carry booty back to Rome. The sponge divers also recovered from the wreck the famous Antikythera mechanism, believed to be an astronomical calculator. Further examples of fabulous works of art recovered from the sea floor are the two &quot;bronzi&quot; found in Riace (Calabria), Italy. In the cases of Antikythera and Riace, however, the artifacts were recovered without the direct participation of maritime archaeologists.

Recent studies in the Sarno river (near Pompeii) show other interesting elements of ancient life. The Sarno projects suggests that on the Tyrrhenian shore there were little towns with palafittes, similar to ancient Venice. In the same area, the submerged town of Puteoli (Pozzuoli, close to Naples) contains the &quot;portus Julius&quot; created by Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa in 37 BC, later sunk due to bradyseism.

The sea floor elsewhere in the Mediterranean holds countless archaeological sites. In Israel, Herod the Great&#x27;s port at Caesarea Maritima has been extensively studied. Other finds are consistent with some passages of the Bible (like the so-called Jesus boat, which appears to have been in use during the first century AD).

===Australia===
Maritime archaeology in Australia commenced in the 1970s with the advent of Jeremy Green due to concerns expressed by academics and politicians with the rampant destruction of the Dutch and British East India ships lost on the west coast. As Commonwealth legislation was enacted and enforced after 1976 and as States enacted their own legislation the sub-discipline spread throughout Australia concentrating initially on shipwrecks due to on-going funding by both the States and the Commonwealth under their shipwreck legislation. Studies now include as an element of underwater archaeology, as a whole, the study of submerged indigenous sites. Nautical Archaeology, (the specialised study of boat and ship construction) is also practised in the region. Often the sites or relics studied in Australia as in the rest of the world are not inundated. The study of historic submerged aircraft, better known as a sub-discipline of aviation archaeology, underwater aviation archaeology is also practised in the region. In some states maritime and underwater archaeology is practised out of Museums and in others out of cultural heritage management units, and all practitioners operate under the aegis of the Australasian Institute for Maritime Archaeology (AIMA).

<doc id="20069" wikidata="Q182130" url="?curid=20069" title="Morihei Ueshiba">
<text>was a Japanese martial artist and founder of the martial art of aikido. He is often referred to as &quot;the founder&quot; or , &quot;Great Teacher&quot;.

The son of a landowner from Tanabe, Ueshiba studied a number of martial arts in his youth, and served in the Japanese Army during the Russo-Japanese War. After being discharged in 1907, he moved to Hokkaidō as the head of a pioneer settlement; here he met and studied with Takeda Sōkaku, the headmaster of Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu. On leaving Hokkaido in 1919, Ueshiba joined the Ōmoto-kyō movement, a Shinto sect, in Ayabe, where he served as a martial arts instructor and opened his first dojo. He accompanied the head of the Ōmoto-kyō group, Onisaburo Deguchi, on an expedition to Mongolia in 1924, where they were captured by Chinese troops and returned to Japan. The following year, he had a profound spiritual experience, stating that, &quot;a golden spirit sprang up from the ground, veiled my body, and changed my body into a golden one.&quot; After this experience, his martial arts technique became gentler, with a greater emphasis on the control of ki.

Ueshiba moved to Tokyo in 1926, where he set up what would become the Aikikai Hombu Dojo. By this point he was comparatively famous in martial arts circles, and taught at this dojo and others around Japan, including in several military academies. In the aftermath of World War II the Hombu dojo was temporarily closed, but Ueshiba had by this point left Tokyo and retired to Iwama, and he continued training at the dojo he had set up there. From the end of the war until the 1960s, he worked to promote aikido throughout Japan and abroad. He died from liver cancer in 1969.

After Ueshiba&#x27;s death, aikido continued to be promulgated by his students (many of whom became noted martial artists in their own right). It is now practiced around the world.

==Tanabe, 1883–1912==
Morihei Ueshiba was born in Nishinotani village (now part of the city of Tanabe), Wakayama Prefecture, Japan, on December 14, 1883, the fourth child (and only son) born to Yoroku Ueshiba and his wife Yuki.

The young Ueshiba was raised in a somewhat privileged setting. His father Yoroku was a wealthy gentleman farmer and minor politician, being an elected member of the Nishinotani village council for 22 consecutive years. His mother Yuki was from the Itokawa clan, a prominent local family who could trace their lineage back to the Heian period. Ueshiba was a rather weak, sickly child and bookish in his inclinations. At a young age his father encouraged him to take up sumo wrestling and swimming and entertained him with stories of his great-grandfather Kichiemon, who was considered a very strong samurai in his era. The need for such strength was further emphasized when the young Ueshiba witnessed his father being attacked by followers of a competing politician.

A major influence on Ueshiba&#x27;s early education was his elementary schoolteacher Tasaburo Nasu, who was a Shinto priest and who introduced Ueshiba to the religion. At the age of six Ueshiba was sent to study at the Jizōderu Temple, but had little interest in the rote learning of Confucian education. However, his schoolmaster Mitsujo Fujimoto was also a priest of Shingon Buddhism, and taught the young Ueshiba some of the esoteric chants and ritual observances of the sect, which Ueshiba found intriguing. His interest in Buddhism was sufficiently great that his mother considered enrolling him in the priesthood, but his father Yoroku vetoed the idea. Ueshiba went to Tanabe Higher Elementary School and then to Tanabe Prefectural Middle School, but left formal education in his early teens, enrolling instead at a private abacus academy, the Yoshida Institute, to study accountancy. On graduating from the academy, he worked at a local tax office for a few months, but the job did not suit him and in 1901 he left for Tokyo, funded by his father. Ueshiba Trading, the stationery business which he opened there, was short-lived; unhappy with life in the capital, he returned to Tanabe less than a year later after suffering a bout of beri-beri. Shortly thereafter he married his childhood acquaintance Hatsu Itokawa.

In 1903, Ueshiba was called up for military service. He failed the initial physical examination, being shorter than the regulation . To overcome this, he stretched his spine by attaching heavy weights to his legs and suspending himself from tree branches; when he re-took the physical exam he had increased his height by the necessary half-inch to pass. He was assigned to the Osaka Fourth Division, 37th Regiment, and was promoted to corporal of the 61st Wakayama regiment by the following year; after serving on the front lines during the Russo-Japanese War he was promoted to sergeant. He was discharged in 1907, and again returned to his father&#x27;s farm in Tanabe. Here he befriended the writer and philosopher Minakata Kumagusu, becoming involved with Minakata&#x27;s opposition to the Meiji government&#x27;s Shrine Consolidation Policy. He and his wife had their first child, a daughter named Matsuko, in 1911.

Ueshiba studied several martial arts during his early life, and was renowned for his physical strength during his youth. During his sojourn in Tokyo he studied Kitō-ryū jujutsu under Takisaburo Tobari, and briefly enrolled in a school teaching Shinkage-ryū. His training in Gotō-ha Yagyū-ryu under Masakatsu Nakai started in 1903 and continued until 1908; although this training was sporadic due to his military service, Ueshiba was granted a Menkyo Kaiden (certificate of &quot;Total Transmission&quot;) in 1908. In 1901 he received some instruction from Tozawa Tokusaburōin in Tenjin Shin&#x27;yō-ryū jujutsu and he studied judo with Kiyoichi Takagi in Tanabe in 1911, after his father had a dojo built on the family compound to encourage his son&#x27;s training. In 1907, after his return from the war, he was also presented with a certificate of enlightenment (&quot;shingon inkyo&quot;) by his childhood teacher Mitsujo Fujimoto.

==Hokkaidō, 1912–1920==

In the early part of the 20th century, the prefectural government of Hokkaidō, Japan&#x27;s northernmost island, were offering various grants and incentives for mainland Japanese groups willing to relocate there. At the time, Hokkaidō was still largely unsettled by the Japanese, being occupied primarily by the indigenous Ainu. In 1910, Ueshiba travelled to Hokkaidō in the company of his acquaintance Denzaburo Kurahashi, who had lived on the northern island before. His intent was to scout out a propitious location for a new settlement, and he found the site at Shirataki suitable for his plans. Despite the hardships he suffered on this journey (which included getting lost in snowstorms several times and an incident in which he nearly drowned in a freezing river), Ueshiba returned to Tanabe filled with enthusiasm for the project, and began recruiting families to join him. He became the leader of the Kishū Settlement Group, a collective of eighty-five pioneers who intended to settle in the Shirataki district and live as farmers; the group founded the village of Yubetsu (later Shirataki village) in August, 1912. Much of the funding for this project came from Ueshiba&#x27;s father and his brothers-in-law Zenzo and Koshiro Inoue. Zenzo&#x27;s son Noriaki was also a member of the settlement group.

Poor soil conditions and bad weather led to crop failures during the first three years of the project, but the group still managed to cultivate mint and farm livestock. The burgeoning timber industry provided a boost to the settlement&#x27;s economy, and by 1918 there were over 500 families residing there. A fire in 1917 razed the entire village, leading to the departure of around twenty families. Ueshiba was attending a meeting over railway construction around 50 miles away, but on learning of the fire travelled back the entire distance on foot. He was elected to the village council that year, and took a prominent role in leading the reconstruction efforts. In the summer of 1918, Hatsu gave birth to their first son, Takemori.

The young Ueshiba met Takeda Sōkaku, the founder of Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu, at the Hisada Inn in Engaru, in March 1915. Ueshiba was deeply impressed with Takeda&#x27;s martial art, and despite being on an important mission for his village at the time, abandoned his journey to spend the next month studying with Takeda. He requested formal instruction and began studying Takeda&#x27;s style of jūjutsu in earnest, going so far as to construct a dojo at his home and inviting his new teacher to be a permanent house guest. He received a &quot;kyōju dairi&quot; certificate, a teaching license, for the system from Takeda in 1922, when Takeda visited him in Ayabe. Takeda also gave him a Yagyū Shinkage-ryū sword transmission scroll. Ueshiba then became a representative of Daitō-ryū, toured with Takeda as a teaching assistant and taught the system to others. The relationship between Ueshiba and Takeda was a complicated one. Ueshiba was an extremely dedicated student, dutifully attending to his teacher&#x27;s needs and displaying great respect. However, Takeda overshadowed him throughout his early martial arts career, and Ueshiba&#x27;s own students recorded the need to address what they referred to as &quot;the Takeda problem&quot;.

==Ayabe, 1920–1927==

In November 1919, Ueshiba learned that his father Yoroku was ill, and was not expected to survive. Leaving most of his possessions to Takeda, Ueshiba left Shirataki with the apparent intention of returning to Tanabe to visit his ailing parent. En route he made a detour to Ayabe, near Kyoto, intending to visit Onisaburo Deguchi, the spiritual leader of the Ōmoto-kyō religion (Ueshiba&#x27;s nephew Noriaki Inoue had already joined the religion and may have recommended it to his uncle). Ueshiba stayed at the Ōmoto-kyō headquarters for several days, and met with Deguchi, who told him that, &quot;There is nothing to worry about with your father&quot;. On his return to Tanabe, Ueshiba found that Yoroku had died. Criticised by family and friends for arriving too late to see his father, Ueshiba went into the mountains with a sword and practised solo sword exercises for several days; this almost led to his arrest when the police were informed of a sword-wielding madman on the loose.

Within a few months, Ueshiba was back in Ayabe, having decided to become a full-time student of Ōmoto-kyō. In 1920 he moved his entire family, including his mother, to the Ōmoto compound; at the same time he also purchased enough rice to feed himself and his family for several years. That same year, Deguchi asked Ueshiba to become the group&#x27;s martial arts instructor, and a dojo—the first of several that Ueshiba was to lead—was constructed on the centre&#x27;s grounds. Ueshiba also taught Takeda&#x27;s Daitō-ryū in neighbouring Hyōgo Prefecture during this period. His second son, Kuniharu, was born in 1920 in Ayabe, but died from illness the same year, along with three-year-old Takemori.

Takeda visited Ueshiba in Ayabe to provide instruction, although he was not a follower of Ōmoto and did not get along with Deguchi, which led to a cooling of the relationship between him and Ueshiba. Ueshiba continued to teach his martial art under the name &quot;Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu&quot;, at the behest of his teacher. However, Deguchi encouraged Ueshiba to create his own style of martial arts, &quot;Ueshiba-ryū&quot;, and sent many Ōmoto followers to study at the dojo. He also brought Ueshiba into the highest levels of the group&#x27;s bureaucracy, making Ueshiba his executive assistant and putting him in charge of the Showa Seinenkai (Ōmoto-kyō&#x27;s national youth organisation) and the Ōmoto Shobotai, a volunteer fire service.

His close relationship with Deguchi introduced Ueshiba to various members of Japan&#x27;s far-right; members of the ultranationalist group the Sakurakai would hold meetings at Ueshiba&#x27;s dojo, and he developed a friendship with the philosopher Shūmei Ōkawa during this period, as well as meeting with Nisshō Inoue and Kozaburō Tachibana. Deguchi also offered Ueshiba&#x27;s services as a bodyguard to Kingoro Hashimoto, the Sakurakai&#x27;s founder. Ueshiba&#x27;s commitment to the goal of world peace, stressed by many biographers, must be viewed in the light of these relationships and his Ōmoto-kyō beliefs. His association with the extreme right-wing is understandable when one considers that Ōmoto-kyō&#x27;s view of world peace was of a benevolent dictatorship by the Emperor of Japan, with other nations being subjugated under Japanese rule.

In 1921, in an event known as the , the Japanese authorities raided the compound, destroying the main buildings on the site and arresting Deguchi on charges of lèse-majesté. Ueshiba&#x27;s dojo was undamaged and, over the following two years, he worked closely with Deguchi to reconstruct the group&#x27;s centre, becoming heavily involved in farming work and serving as the group&#x27;s &quot;Caretaker of Forms&quot;, a role which placed him in charge of overseeing Ōmoto&#x27;s move towards self-sufficiency. His son Kisshomaru was born in the summer of 1921.

Three years later, in 1924, Deguchi led a small group of Ōmoto-kyō disciples, including Ueshiba, on a journey to Mongolia at the invitation of retired naval captain Yutaro Yano and his associates within the ultra-nationalist Black Dragon Society. Deguchi&#x27;s intent was to establish a new religious kingdom in Mongolia, and to this end he had distributed propaganda suggesting that he was the reincarnation of Genghis Khan. Allied with the Mongolian bandit Lu Zhankui, Deguchi&#x27;s group were arrested in Tongliao by the Chinese authorities. Fortunately for Ueshiba, whilst Lu and his men were executed by firing squad, the Japanese group was released into the custody of the Japanese consul. They were returned under guard to Japan, where Deguchi was imprisoned for breaking the terms of his bail. During this expedition Ueshiba was given the Chinese alias Wang Shou-gao, rendered in Japanese as &quot;Moritaka&quot; – he was reportedly very taken with this name and continued to use it intermittently for the rest of his life.

After returning to Ayabe, Ueshiba began a regimen of spiritual training, regularly retreating to the mountains or performing &quot;misogi&quot; in the Nachi Falls. As his prowess as a martial artist increased, his fame began to spread. He was challenged by many established martial artists, some of whom later became his students after being defeated by him. In the autumn of 1925 he was asked to give a demonstration of his art in Tokyo, at the behest of Admiral Isamu Takeshita; one of the spectators was Yamamoto Gonnohyōe, who requested that Ueshiba stay in the capital to instruct the Imperial Guard in his martial art. After a couple of weeks, however, Ueshiba took issue with several government officials who voiced concerns about his connections to Deguchi; he cancelled the training and returned to Ayabe.

==Tokyo, 1927–1942==
In 1926 Takeshita invited Ueshiba to visit Tokyo again. Ueshiba relented and returned to the capital, but while residing there was stricken with a serious illness. Deguchi visited his ailing student and, concerned for his health, commanded Ueshiba to return to Ayabe. The appeal of returning increased after Ueshiba was questioned by the police following his meeting with Deguchi; the authorities were keeping the Ōmoto-kyō leader under close surveillance. Angered at the treatment he had received, Ueshiba went back to Ayabe again. Six months later, this time with Deguchi&#x27;s blessing, he and his family moved permanently to Tokyo. This move allowed Ueshiba to teach politicians, high-ranking military personnel, and members of the Imperial household; suddenly he was no longer an obscure provincial martial artist, but a sensei to some of Japan&#x27;s most important citizens. Arriving in October 1927, the Ueshiba family set up home in the Shirokane district. The building proved too small to house the growing number of aikido students, and so the Ueshibas moved to larger premises, first in Mita district, then in Takanawa, and finally to a purpose-built hall in Shinjuku. This last location, originally named the Kobukan (), would eventually become the Aikikai Hombu Dojo. During its construction, Ueshiba rented a property nearby, where he was visited by Kanō Jigorō, the founder of judo.

During this period, Ueshiba was invited to teach at a number of military institutes, due to his close personal relationships with key figures in the military (among them Sadao Araki, the Japanese Minister of War). He accepted an invitation from Admiral Sankichi Takahashi to be the martial arts instructor at the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy, and also taught at the Nakano Spy School, although aikido was later judged to be too technical for the students there and karate was adopted instead. He also became a visiting instructor at the Imperial Japanese Army Academy after being challenged by (and defeating) General Makoto Miura, another student of Takeda Sōkaku&#x27;s Daitō-ryū. Takeda himself met Ueshiba for the last time around 1935, while Ueshiba was teaching at the Osaka headquarters of the &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; newspaper. Frustrated by the appearance of his teacher, who was openly critical of Ueshiba&#x27;s martial arts and who appeared intent on taking over the classes there, Ueshiba left Osaka during the night, bowing to the residence in which Takeda was staying and thereafter avoiding all contact with him. Between 1940 and 1942 he made several visits to Manchukuo (Japanese occupied Manchuria) where he was the principal martial arts instructor at Kenkoku University. Whilst in Manchuria, he met and defeated the sumo wrestler Tenryū Saburō during a demonstration.

The &quot;Second Ōmoto Incident&quot; in 1935 saw another government crackdown on Deguchi&#x27;s sect, in which the Ayabe compound was destroyed and most of the group&#x27;s leaders imprisoned. Although he had relocated to Tokyo, Ueshiba had retained links with the Ōmoto-kyō group (he had in fact helped Deguchi to establish a paramilitary branch of the sect only three years earlier) and expected to be arrested as one of its senior members. However, he had a good relationship with the local police commissioner Kenji Tomita and the chief of police Gīchi Morita, both of whom had been his students. As a result, although he was taken in for interrogation, he was released without charge on Morita&#x27;s authority.

In 1932, Ueshiba&#x27;s daughter Matsuko was married to the swordsman Kiyoshi Nakakura, who was adopted as Ueshiba&#x27;s heir under the name Morihiro Ueshiba. The marriage ended after a few years, and Nakakura left the family in 1937. Ueshiba later designated his son Kisshomaru as the heir to his martial art.

The 1930s saw Japan&#x27;s invasion of mainland Asia and increased military activity in Europe. Ueshiba was concerned about the prospect of war, and became involved in a number of efforts to try and forestall the conflict that would eventually become World War II. He was part of a group, along with Shūmei Ōkawa and several wealthy Japanese backers, that tried to broker a deal with Harry Chandler to export aviation fuel from the United States to Japan (in contravention of the oil embargo that was currently in force), although this effort ultimately failed. In 1941 Ueshiba also undertook a secret diplomatic mission to China at the behest of Prince Fumimaro Konoe. The intended goal was a meeting with Chiang Kai-shek to establish peace talks, but Ueshiba was unable to meet with the Chinese leader, arriving too late to fulfil his mission.

==Iwama, 1942–1969==

From 1935 onwards, Ueshiba had been purchasing land in Iwama in Ibaraki Prefecture, and by the early 1940s had acquired around of farmland there. In 1942, disenchanted with the war-mongering and political manoeuvring in the capital, he left Tokyo and moved to Iwama permanently, settling in a small farmer&#x27;s cottage. Here he founded the Aiki Shuren Dojo, also known as the Iwama dojo, and the Aiki Shrine, a devotional shrine to the &quot;Great Spirit of Aiki&quot;. During this time he travelled extensively in Japan, particularly in the Kansai region, teaching his aikido. Despite the prohibition on the teaching of martial arts after World War II, Ueshiba and his students continued to practice in secret at the Iwama dojo; the Hombu dojo in Tokyo was in any case being used as a refugee centre for citizens displaced by the severe firebombing. It was during this period that Ueshiba met and befriended Koun Nakanishi, an expert in kotodama. The study of kotodama was to become one of Ueshiba&#x27;s passions in later life, and Nakanishi&#x27;s work inspired Ueshiba&#x27;s concept of &quot;takemusu aiki&quot;.

The rural nature of his new home in Iwama allowed Ueshiba to concentrate on the second great passion of his life: farming. He had been born into a farming family and spent much of his life cultivating the land, from his settlement days in Hokkaidō to his work in Ayabe trying to make the Ōmoto-kyō compound self-sufficient. He viewed farming as a logical complement to martial arts; both were physically demanding and required single-minded dedication. Not only did his farming activities provide a useful cover for martial arts training under the government&#x27;s restrictions, it also provided food for Ueshiba, his students and other local families at a time when food shortages were commonplace.

The government prohibition (on aikido, at least) was lifted in 1948 with the creation of the Aiki Foundation, established by the Japanese Ministry of Education with permission from the Occupation forces. The Hombu dojo re-opened the following year. After the war Ueshiba effectively retired from aikido. He delegated most of the work of running the Hombu dojo and the Aiki Federation to his son Kisshomaru, and instead chose to spend much of his time in prayer, meditation, calligraphy and farming. He still travelled extensively to promote aikido, even visiting Hawaii in 1961. He also appeared in a television documentary on aikido: NTV&#x27;s &quot;The Master of Aikido&quot;, broadcast in January 1960. Ueshiba maintained links with the Japanese nationalist movement even in later life; his student Kanshu Sunadomari reported that Ueshiba temporarily sheltered Mikami Taku, one of the naval officers involved in the May 15 Incident, at Iwama.

In 1969, Ueshiba became ill. He led his last training session on March 10, and was taken to hospital where he was diagnosed with cancer of the liver. He died suddenly on April 26, 1969. His body was buried at Kozan-ji Temple Tanabe-shi Wakayama Japan, and he was given the posthumous Buddhist title &quot;Aiki-in Moritake En&#x27;yū Daidōshi&quot; (); parts of his hair were enshrined at Ayabe, Iwama and Kumano. Two months later, his wife Hatsu ( &quot;Ueshiba Hatsu&quot;, née &quot;Itokawa Hatsu&quot;; 1881–1969) also died.

==Development of aikido==

Aikido—usually translated as the &quot;Way of Unifying Spirit&quot; or the &quot;Way of Spiritual Harmony&quot;—is a fighting system that focuses on throws, pins, and joint locks together with some striking techniques. It emphasizes protecting the opponent and promotes spiritual and social development.

The technical curriculum of aikido was derived from the teachings of Takeda Sōkaku; the basic techniques of aikido stem from his Daitō-ryū system. In the earlier years of his teaching, from the 1920s to the mid-1930s, Ueshiba taught the Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu system; his early students&#x27; documents bear the term Daitō-ryū. Indeed, Ueshiba trained one of the future highest grade earners in Daitō-ryū, Takuma Hisa, in the art before Takeda took charge of Hisa&#x27;s training.

The early form of training under Ueshiba was noticeably different from later forms of aikido. It had a larger curriculum, increased use of strikes to vital points (&quot;atemi&quot;), and greater use of weapons. The schools of aikido developed by Ueshiba&#x27;s students from the pre-war period tend to reflect the harder style of the early training. These students included Kenji Tomiki (who founded the Shodokan Aikido sometimes called Tomiki-ryū), Noriaki Inoue (who founded Shin&#x27;ei Taidō), Minoru Mochizuki (who founded Yoseikan Budo) and Gozo Shioda (who founded Yoshinkan Aikido). Many of these styles are therefore considered &quot;pre-war styles&quot;, although some of these teachers continued to train with Ueshiba in the years after World War II.
During his lifetime, Ueshiba had three spiritual experiences that impacted greatly his understanding of the martial arts. The first occurred in 1925, after Ueshiba had defeated a naval officer&#x27;s &quot;bokken&quot; (wooden katana) attacks unarmed and without hurting the officer. Ueshiba then walked to his garden, where he had the following realization:
His second experience occurred in 1940 when engaged in the ritual purification process of &quot;misogi&quot;.

His third experience was in 1942 during the worst fighting of World War II when Ueshiba had a vision of the &quot;Great Spirit of Peace&quot;.
After these events, Ueshiba seemed to slowly grow away from Takeda, and he began to change his art. These changes are reflected in the differing names with which he referred to his system, first as &quot;aiki-jūjutsu&quot;, then Ueshiba-ryū, Asahi-ryū, and &quot;aiki budō&quot;. In 1942, when Ueshiba&#x27;s group joined the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai, the martial art that he developed finally came to be known as aikido.

As Ueshiba grew older, more skilled, and more spiritual in his outlook, his art also changed and became softer and more gentle. Martial techniques became less important, and more focus was given to the control of ki. In his expression of the art there was a greater emphasis on what is referred to as &quot;kokyū-nage&quot;, or &quot;breath throws&quot; which are soft and blending, utilizing the opponent&#x27;s movement to throw them. Ueshiba regularly practiced cold water &quot;misogi&quot;, as well as other spiritual and religious rites, and viewed his studies of aikido as part of this spiritual training.
Over the years, Ueshiba trained a large number of students, many of whom later became famous teachers in their own right and developed their styles of aikido. Some of them were &quot;uchi-deshi&quot;, live-in students. Ueshiba placed many demands on his &quot;uchi-deshi&quot;, expecting them to attend to him at all times, act as training partners (even in the middle of the night), arrange his travel plans, massage, and bathe him, and assist with household chores.

There were roughly four generations of students, comprising the pre-war students (training 1921–1935), students who trained during the Second World War (c.1936–1945), the post-war students in Iwama (c.1946–1955) and the students who trained with Ueshiba during his final years (c.1956–c.1969). As a result of Ueshiba&#x27;s martial development throughout his life, students from each of these generations tend to have markedly different approaches to aikido. These variations are compounded by the fact that few students trained with Ueshiba for a protracted period; only Yoichiro Inoue, Kenji Tomiki, Gozo Shioda, Morihiro Saito, Tsutomu Yukawa and Mitsugi Saotome studied directly under Ueshiba for more than five or six years. After the war, Ueshiba and the Hombu Dojo dispatched some of their students to various other countries, resulting in aikido spreading around the world.

<text>In a computer, the memory address register (MAR) is the CPU register that either stores the memory address from which data will be fetched to the CPU registers, or the address to which data will be sent and stored via system bus.

In other words, this register is used to access data and instructions from memory during the execution phase of instruction. MAR holds the memory location of data that needs to be accessed. When reading from memory, data addressed by MAR is fed into the MDR (memory data register) and then used by the CPU. When writing to memory, the CPU writes data from MDR to the memory location whose address is stored in MAR. MAR, which is found inside the CPU, goes either to the RAM (random-access memory) or cache.

The MAR register is half of a minimal interface between a microprogram and computer storage; the other half is a MDR.

In general, MAR is a parallel load register that contains the next memory address to be manipulated, for example the next address to be read or written.

<text>A microassembler is a computer program that helps prepare a microprogram, called &quot;firmware&quot;, to control the low level operation of a computer in much the same way an assembler helps prepare higher level code for a processor. The difference is that the microprogram is usually only developed by the processor manufacturer and works intimately with the computer hardware. On a microprogrammed computer the microprogram implements the operations of the instruction set in which any normal program (including both application programs and operating systems) is written. The use of a microprogram allows the manufacturer to fix certain mistakes, including working around hardware design errors, without modifying the hardware. Another means of employing microassembler-generated microprograms is in allowing the same hardware to run different instruction sets. After it is assembled, the microprogram is then loaded to a control store to become part of the logic of a CPU&#x27;s control unit.

Some microassemblers are more generalized and are not targeted at a single computer architecture. For example, through the use of macro-assembler-like capabilities, Digital Equipment Corporation used their &quot;MICRO2&quot; microassembler for a very wide range of computer architectures and implementations.

If a given computer implementation supports a writeable control store, the microassembler is usually provided to customers as a means of writing customized microcode.

In the process of microcode assembly it is helpful to verify the microprogram with emulation tools before distribution. Nowadays, microcoding has experienced a revival, since it is possible to correct and optimize the firmware of processing units already manufactured or sold, in order to adapt to specific operating systems or to fix hardware bugs. However, a commonly usable microassembler for today&#x27;s CPUs is not available to manipulate the microcode. Knowledge of a processor&#x27;s microcode is usually considered proprietary information so it is difficult to obtain information about how to modify it.

<text>A machine pistol is a handgun that is capable of fully automatic fire, including stockless handgun-style submachine guns.

The Austrians introduced the world&#x27;s first machine pistol, the &quot;Steyr Repetierpistole&quot; M1912/P16, during World War I. The Germans also experimented with machine pistols, by converting various types of semi-automatic pistols to full-auto, leading to the development of the first practical submachine guns. During World War II, machine pistol development was widely disregarded in favor of submachine gun mass-production. After the war, machine pistol development was limited and only a handful of manufacturers would develop new designs, with varying degrees of success. This concept would eventually lead to the development of the personal defense weapon or PDW.

Today, machine pistols are considered special-purpose weapons with limited utility, with their original niche being filled with either the PDW, carbines, or simply more modern semi-automatic sidearms. Contributing to their already-fringe use, without a shoulder stock and training, machine pistols can be difficult to control for all but the best shooters.

== History ==
In 1896 a select-fire pistol was patented by the British inventor Hugh Gabbett-Fairfax.

=== World War I ===
During World War I, a machine pistol version of the Steyr M1912 called the &quot;Repetierpistole M1912/P16&quot; was produced. It used a 16-round fixed magazine loaded via 8 round stripper clips, a detachable shoulder stock and a rather large exposed semi-auto/full-auto selector switch on the right side of the frame above the trigger (down = semi &amp; up = full). It fired the 9×23mm Steyr cartridge, with a full-auto rate-of-fire of about 800 to 1,000 rounds per minute (RPM). It weighed about 2.6 pounds. Introduced in 1916, it is considered one of the world&#x27;s first full-auto capable pistols. Only 960 M1912/P16 were made.

An automatic version of the Frommer Stop pistol was also tested, including a variant known as the &quot;Doppelpistole&quot; where two guns were joined together and mounted upside down on a tripod.

In 1916, Heinrich Senn of Bern designed a modification of the Swiss Luger pistol to fire in single shots or in full-automatic. Around the same time Georg Luger demonstrated a similar Luger machine-pistol which inspired the German Army to develop submachine guns.

=== 1920s–1930s ===
The Mauser C96 was introduced in 1896, it being one of the first commercially successful and practical semi-automatic pistols. During World War I, the Germans experimented with machine pistols by converting both 7.63mm Mauser and 9 mm Parabellum semi-automatic C96 pistols to full-auto. In the late 1920s, Spanish gunmakers expanded upon this idea by introducing select fire copies of the C96 with 20-round detachable magazines. In the early 1930s, Mauser engineers finally followed suit, and introduced the Model 1932 or Model 712 &quot;Schnellfeuer&quot; variant, which also included 20 round detachable magazines and a select fire mechanism allowing for fully automatic fire at a rate of 1,000 RPM.

=== World War II ===
During World War II, machine pistol development was more or less ignored as the major powers were focused on mass-producing submachine guns. Mauser Model 1932 or Model 712 &quot;Schnellfeuer&quot; variant was used mainly by Waffen-SS personnel.

=== 1950s–1960s ===

The 9×18mm Makarov Stechkin automatic pistol (APS) is a Russian select-fire machine pistol introduced into the Russian army in 1951. Like the other common Russian army pistol of this era, the Makarov, the Stechkin uses a simple unlocked blowback mechanism and the double action trigger. What makes the Stechkin APS a machine pistol is that it has an automatic fire mode, which is selected using the safety lever. In burst or automatic fire, the pistol should be fitted with the wooden shoulder stock; otherwise, the weapon quickly becomes uncontrollable. The Stechkin was intended as a sidearm for artillery soldiers and tank crews, but in practice, it ended up earning a strong following in the ranks of political and criminal police forces. Many KGB and GRU operatives favored the Stechkin for its firepower and 20-round magazine.
The Škorpion vz. 61 is a Czechoslovak 7.65 mm or .32 ACP machine pistol developed in 1959 and produced from 1961 to 1979. Although it was developed for use with security and special forces, the weapon was also accepted into service with the Czechoslovak Army, as a personal sidearm for lower-ranking army staff, vehicle drivers, armored vehicle personnel and special forces. The Skorpion&#x27;s lower-powered .32 ACP cartridge, coupled with a rate-of-fire limiting device housed in the grip (which allows a reasonable rate of 850 RPM with a relatively light bolt), also makes it easier to control in full-auto than the more common 9 mm Parabellum designs. Currently the weapon is in use with the armed forces of several countries as a sidearm. The Škorpion was also license-built in Yugoslavia, designated M84.

The Beretta M1951R was based on the 9 mm Parabellum Beretta M1951 pistol and produced during the 1960s in response to a request made by the Italian special forces. The primary difference between the M951R and the original M1951 lay in the fire selector lever mounted on the right side of the weapon&#x27;s frame, enabling either semi-automatic or continuous fire – labelled &quot;SEM&quot; and &quot;AUT&quot;, respectively. Additionally, the weapon has a heavier slide, a folding wooden forward grip, an extended barrel and an extended magazine, increasing the capacity to 10 rounds.

=== 1970s–1980s ===
The MAC-10 and MAC-11 were 1970s blowback-designed weapons with the magazine carried in the pistol grip and a select-fire switch. The .45 ACP MAC-10 had a rate of fire of 1,100 RPM, and the 9×19mm version 1,200-1,500 RPM. The MAC-11 could also fire 1,200-1,500 RPM with its lighter .380 ACP cartridges. These guns were designed by Gordon Ingram and Military Armament Corporation in the US. The weapons were used in special operations and covert applications in Vietnam and by Brazilian anti-terrorist units, most people fitting it with a silencer using its threaded barrel. While some sources call the MAC-10 and MAC-11 machine pistols, the guns are also referred to as compact submachine guns.
Since it is difficult to control machine pistols when they are fired in fully automatic mode, some manufacturers developed an &quot;intermittent-fire&quot; setting that fires a burst of three rounds instead of a continuous stream. The first of these guns is the Heckler &amp; Koch VP70, the 70 designating the year of origin; 1970. That is a 9 mm Parabellum, 18-round, double action only, select fire-capable polymer frame pistol. It is the first polymer-framed pistol, predating the Glock 17. The stock incorporates the semi-auto/three-round burst selector, therefore it will only fire a three-round burst with the stock attached. Cyclic rounds per minute for the three-round bursts is 2,200 RPM. Despite the VP70&#x27;s potential, it was never adopted by the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot;.
In 1976, a shortened version of the 9 mm Parabellum Heckler &amp; Koch MP5 was introduced; the MP5K (K from the German &quot;Kurz&quot; = &quot;short&quot;) was designed for close quarters battle use by clandestine operations and special services. The MP5K does not have a shoulder stock, and the bolt and receiver were shortened at the rear. The resultant lighter bolt led to a higher rate of fire than the standard MP5 (900-1000 RPM vs. 800). The barrel, cocking handle and its cover were shortened and a vertical foregrip was used to replace the standard handguard. The barrel ends at the base of the front sight, which prevents the use of any sort of muzzle device.

Another popular machine pistol using the three-shot burst system is the 9 mm Parabellum Beretta Model 93R. Introduced in 1979 the Beretta Model 93R, it is a select-fire machine pistol meant for police and military use. It offered extra firepower in a smaller package and is suited for concealed carry purposes such as VIP protection, or for close quarters maneuvers such as room-to-room searches. A selector switch and the foldable foregrip allow the pistol to fire three-round bursts with each trigger pull for a cyclic rate of 1100 rounds per minute. The designers limited it to three round bursts for ease of control. A 20-round magazine and a metal shoulder stock may also be fitted.

The Stechkin APS made a comeback in the late 1970s when Russian Spetsnaz special forces units in Afghanistan used the suppressor-equipped APB variant for clandestine missions in enemy territory, such as during the Soviet–Afghan War.
The 9 mm Parabellum Micro Uzi is a scaled-down version of the Uzi submachine gun, first introduced in 1983. It is 460 mm (18.11 inches) long with the stock extended, and just 250 mm (9.84 inches) long with the stock folded. Its barrel length is 117 mm and its muzzle velocity is 350 m/s. Used by the Israeli Isayeret and the US Secret Service, Micro-Uzis are available in open-bolt or closed-bolt versions. The weapon has an additional tungsten weight on the bolt to slow the rate of fire, which would otherwise make such a lightweight weapon uncontrollable.
The 9 mm Parabellum Glock 18 is a select-fire variant of the Glock 17, developed in 1986 at the request of the Austrian counter-terrorist unit EKO Cobra. This machine pistol has a lever-type select-fire switch, installed on the left side, at the rear of the serrated portion of the slide (selector lever in the bottom position for continuous fire, top setting for single fire). The firearm is typically used with an extended 33-round capacity magazine and may be fired with or without a shoulder stock. The pistol&#x27;s rate of fire in fully automatic mode is approximately 1,100–1,400 RPM.

=== 1990s–2000s ===
Introduced in 1992, the Steyr TMP (&quot;Taktische Maschinenpistole&quot; &quot;tactical machine pistol&quot;) is a select-fire 9×19mm Parabellum machine pistol manufactured by Steyr Mannlicher of Austria. The magazines come in 15-, 20-, 25-, or 30-round detachable box types. A suppressor can also be fitted.

Also introduced in 1992, the 9 mm Parabellum CZ 75 AUTOMATIC is the full-auto version of the CZ75. It has a longer barrel with three vent ports. This machine pistol has a horizontal rail in front of the trigger guard through which a spare 16- or 20-round magazine can be attached and be used as a fore-grip for better control during full automatic firing.
During the 1990s, the Russian Stechkin APS was once again put into service, as a weapon for VIP bodyguards and for anti-terrorist hostage rescue teams that needed the capability for full automatic fire in emergencies.

Developed in the 1990s and 2000s, the personal defense weapon (PDW), a compact submachine gun-like firearm which can fire armor-piercing, higher-powered ammunition, began to replace the machine pistol as a self-defense side arm for artillery crews, tank crews, and helicopter pilots. Introduced in 2001, the Heckler &amp; Koch MP7 is often called a machine pistol, despite it being a PDW. The MP7 uses a short-stroke piston gas system as used on H&amp;K&#x27;s G36 and HK416 assault rifles, in place of a blowback system traditionally seen on machine pistols. The MP7 uses 20-, 30- and 40-round magazines and fires 4.6×30mm ammunition which can penetrate soft body armor. Due to the heavy use of polymers in its construction, the MP7 is much lighter than older designs, only with an empty 20-round magazine.

== Comparison with compact submachine guns ==

The dividing line between machine pistols and compact submachine guns is difficult to determine with any precision. The term &quot;submachine gun&quot; usually refers to magazine-fed, fully automatic carbines designed to fire pistol cartridges, while the term &quot;machine pistol&quot; usually refers to fully automatic handgun based weapons. However, many weapons fall into both categories.

An example of this is the Škorpion vz. 61, often called a submachine gun. However, it is small enough to be carried in a pistol holster and so is also often referred to as a machine pistol. The MAC-10 and MAC-11 are compact and have been placed in both classes due to their sizes. The Steyr TMP (Tactical Machine Pistol) is also referred to as a compact submachine gun. Likewise, the German Heckler &amp; Koch MP5K falls in both categories. PDWs such as the Heckler &amp; Koch MP7 are also often called machine pistols.

The difference is also blurred by the fact that several languages use what would be literally translated as &quot;machine pistol&quot; as the term for submachine guns; for example the &quot;MP&quot; in MP 40 stands for &quot;Maschinenpistole&quot;.

== Criticisms ==


Machine pistols are considered a special purpose weapon with limited utility. Due to their small size and high rate of fire, machine pistols are difficult to control accurately. As a result, most machine pistols are fitted with a detachable shoulder stock. Some, such as the Heckler &amp; Koch VP70, will fire only in semi-automatic when the stock is removed because the select-fire mechanism is incorporated into the stock. The VP70 introduced a three-round-burst limiter in the same way to improve controllability. The Beretta 93R not only uses a detachable shoulder stock and a three-round-burst limiter, but also a folding forward hand-grip to improve controllability in full auto. The MAC-10 and MAC-11 use suppressors to reduce muzzle rise, while other designs use a combination of burst limiters, forward hand-grips, ported barrels and muzzle brakes.

Gunsite, a US firearms training facility, decided against teaching machine pistol firing when it was founded in 1976. Facility experts believed that it is &quot;a slob&#x27;s weapon, useful only by half-trained or poorly motivated troops&quot;; they claimed that the machine pistol &quot;hits no harder than a pistol and is no more portable than a rifle.&quot; Nevertheless, even the critics from Gunsite concede that the machine pistol is useful for a few situations, such as boarding an enemy boat in low light or when repelling boarders in a naval situation. In the 1970s, International Association of Chiefs of Police weapons researcher David Steele criticized the MAC-10&#x27;s accuracy when he hyperbolically described the MAC series as &quot;fit only for combat in a phone booth&quot;.

Walt Rauch notes that &quot;... despite the 50 to 70 years of bad press that has accrued to the concept of shooting a hand-held machine pistol&quot;, in which critics contend that the weapon will &quot;spray bullets indiscriminately all over the area&quot;, he believes that the 2000s-era models such as the Glock 18 are controllable and accurate in full-auto shooting. Leroy Thompson states that &quot;...machine pistols were reasonably good for use from within a vehicle or for issue to VIP [bodyguard] drivers to give them a marginally more effective weapon during an evacuation under fire&quot;. However, he also stated that machine pistols are &quot;...(h)ard to control in full-auto fire&quot;, which means that there is nothing that a machine pistol &quot;...can do that other weapons available today can&#x27;t do more efficiently.&quot;

<text>Martin Luther King Jr. (born Michael King Jr.; January 15, 1929 – April 4, 1968) was an American Baptist minister, activist, and political philosopher who was one of the most prominent leaders in the civil rights movement from 1955 until his assassination in 1968. He advanced civil rights for people of color in the United States through the use of nonviolent resistance and nonviolent civil disobedience against Jim Crow laws and other forms of legalized discrimination.

A black church leader, King participated in and led marches for the right to vote, desegregation, labor rights, and other civil rights. He oversaw the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott and later became the first president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). As president of the SCLC, he led the unsuccessful Albany Movement in Albany, Georgia, and helped organize some of the nonviolent 1963 protests in Birmingham, Alabama. King was one of the leaders of the 1963 March on Washington, where he delivered his &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, and helped organize two of the three Selma to Montgomery marches during the 1965 Selma voting rights movement. The civil rights movement achieved pivotal legislative gains in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Fair Housing Act of 1968. There were several dramatic standoffs with segregationist authorities, who often responded violently.

King was jailed several times. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) director J. Edgar Hoover considered King a radical and made him an object of the FBI&#x27;s COINTELPRO from 1963 forward. FBI agents investigated him for possible communist ties, spied on his personal life, and secretly recorded him. In 1964, the FBI mailed King a threatening anonymous letter, which he interpreted as an attempt to make him commit suicide. On October 14, 1964, King won the Nobel Peace Prize for combating racial inequality through nonviolent resistance. In his final years, he expanded his focus to include opposition towards poverty and the Vietnam War.

In 1968, King was planning a national occupation of Washington, D.C., to be called the Poor People&#x27;s Campaign, when he was assassinated on April 4 in Memphis, Tennessee. James Earl Ray, a fugitive from the Missouri State Penitentiary, was convicted of the assassination, though the King family believes he was a scapegoat. After a 1999 wrongful death lawsuit ruling named unspecified &quot;government agencies&quot; among the co-conspirators, a Department of Justice investigation found no evidence of a conspiracy. The assassination remains the subject of conspiracy theories. King&#x27;s death was followed by national mourning, as well as anger leading to riots in many U.S. cities. King was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1977 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 2003. Martin Luther King Jr. Day was established as a holiday in cities and states throughout the United States beginning in 1971; the federal holiday was first observed in 1986. The Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., was dedicated in 2011.

== Early life and education ==

=== Birth ===
Michael King Jr. was born on January 15, 1929, in Atlanta; he was the second of three children born to Michael King Sr. and Alberta King (). Alberta&#x27;s father, Adam Daniel Williams, was a minister in rural Georgia, moved to Atlanta in 1893, and became pastor of the Ebenezer Baptist Church in the following year. Williams married Jennie Celeste Parks. Michael Sr. was born to sharecroppers James Albert and Delia King of Stockbridge, Georgia; he was of Irish and likely Mende (Sierra Leone) descent. As an adolescent, Michael Sr. left his parents&#x27; farm and walked to Atlanta, where he attained a high school education, and enrolled in Morehouse College to study for entry to the ministry. Michael Sr. and Alberta began dating in 1920, and married on November 25, 1926. Until Jennie&#x27;s death in 1941, their home was on the second floor of Alberta&#x27;s parents&#x27; Victorian house, where King was born. Michael Jr. had an older sister, Christine King Farris, and a younger brother, Alfred Daniel &quot;A. D.&quot; King.

Shortly after marrying Alberta, Michael King Sr. became assistant pastor of the Ebenezer church. Senior pastor Williams died in the spring of 1931 and that fall Michael Sr. took the role. With support from his wife, he raised attendance from six hundred to several thousand. In 1934, the church sent King Sr. on a multinational trip; one of the stops on the trip was Berlin for the Congress of the Baptist World Alliance (BWA). He also visited sites in Germany that are associated with the Reformation leader Martin Luther. In reaction to the rise of Nazism, the BWA adopted a resolution saying, &quot;This Congress deplores and condemns as a violation of the law of God the Heavenly Father, all racial animosity, and every form of oppression or unfair discrimination toward the Jews, toward colored people, or toward subject races in any part of the world.&quot; After returning home in August 1934, Michael Sr. changed his name to Martin Luther King Sr. and his five-year-old son&#x27;s name to Martin Luther King Jr.

=== Early childhood ===
At his childhood home, Martin King Jr. and his two siblings read aloud the Bible as instructed by their father. After dinners, Martin Jr.&#x27;s grandmother Jennie, whom he affectionately referred to as &quot;Mama&quot;, told lively stories from the Bible. Martin Jr.&#x27;s father regularly used whippings to discipline his children, sometimes having them whip each other. Martin Sr. later remarked, &quot;[Martin Jr.] was the most peculiar child whenever you whipped him. He&#x27;d stand there, and the tears would run down, and he&#x27;d never cry.&quot; Once, when Martin Jr. witnessed his brother A.D. emotionally upset his sister Christine, he took a telephone and knocked A.D. unconscious with it. When Martin Jr. and his brother were playing at their home, A.D. slid from a banister and hit Jennie, causing her to fall unresponsive. Martin Jr. believing her dead, blamed himself and attempted suicide by jumping from a second-story window, but rose from the ground after hearing that she was alive.

Martin King Jr. became friends with a white boy whose father owned a business across the street from his home. In September 1935, when the boys were about six years old, they started school. King had to attend a school for black children, Yonge Street Elementary School, while his playmate went to a separate school for white children only. Soon afterwards, the parents of the white boy stopped allowing King to play with their son, stating to him, &quot;we are white, and you are colored&quot;. When King relayed this to his parents, they talked with him about the history of slavery and racism in America, which King would later say made him &quot;determined to hate every white person&quot;. His parents instructed him that it was his Christian duty to love everyone.

Martin King Jr. witnessed his father stand up against segregation and discrimination. Once, when stopped by a police officer who referred to Martin Sr. as &quot;boy&quot;, Martin Sr. responded sharply that Martin Jr. was a boy but he was a man. When Martin Jr&#x27;s father took him into a shoe store in downtown Atlanta, the clerk told them they needed to sit in the back. Martin Sr. refused asserting &quot;we&#x27;ll either buy shoes sitting here or we won&#x27;t buy any shoes at all&quot;, before leaving the store with Martin Jr. He told Martin Jr. afterward, &quot;I don&#x27;t care how long I have to live with this system, I will never accept it.&quot; In 1936, Martin Sr. led hundreds of African Americans in a civil rights march to the city hall in Atlanta, to protest voting rights discrimination. Martin Jr. later remarked that Martin Sr. was &quot;a real father&quot; to him.

Martin King Jr. memorized hymns and Bible verses by the time he was five years old. Beginning at six years old, he attended church events with his mother and sang hymns while she played piano. His favorite hymn was &quot;I Want to Be More and More Like Jesus&quot;; his singing moved attendees. King later became a member of the junior choir in his church. He enjoyed opera, and played the piano. King garnered a large vocabulary from reading dictionaries. He got into physical altercations with boys in his neighborhood, but oftentimes used his knowledge of words to stop or avoid fights. King showed a lack of interest in grammar and spelling, a trait that persisted throughout his life. In 1939, King sang as a member of his church choir dressed as a slave for the all-white audience at the Atlanta premiere of the film &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. In September 1940, at the age of 11, King was enrolled at the Atlanta University Laboratory School for the seventh grade. While there, King took violin and piano lessons and showed keen interest in history and English classes.

On May 18, 1941, when King had sneaked away from studying at home to watch a parade, he was informed that something had happened to his maternal grandmother. After returning home, he learned she had a heart attack and died while being transported to a hospital. He took her death very hard and believed that his deception in going to see the parade may have been responsible for God taking her. King jumped out of a second-story window at his home but again survived. His father instructed him that Martin Jr. should not blame himself and that she had been called home to God as part of God&#x27;s plan. Martin Jr. struggled with this. Shortly thereafter, Martin Sr. decided to move the family to a two-story brick home on a hill overlooking downtown Atlanta.

=== Adolescence ===
As an adolescent, he initially felt resentment against whites due to the &quot;racial humiliation&quot; that he, his family, and his neighbors often had to endure. In 1942, when King was 13, he became the youngest assistant manager of a newspaper delivery station for the &quot;Atlanta Journal&quot;. In the same year, King skipped the ninth grade and enrolled in Booker T. Washington High School, where he maintained a B-plus average. The high school was the only one in the city for African-American students.

Martin Jr. was brought up in a Baptist home; as he entered adolescence he began to question the literalist teachings preached at his father&#x27;s church. At the age of 13, he denied the bodily resurrection of Jesus during Sunday school. Martin Jr. said that he found himself unable to identify with the emotional displays from congregants who were frequent at his church; he doubted if he would ever attain personal satisfaction from religion. He later said of this point in his life, &quot;doubts began to spring forth unrelentingly.&quot;

In high school, Martin King Jr. became known for his public-speaking ability, with a voice that had grown into an orotund baritone. He joined the school&#x27;s debate team. King continued to be most drawn to history and English, and chose English and sociology as his main subjects. King maintained an abundant vocabulary. However, he relied on his sister Christine to help him with spelling, while King assisted her with math. King also developed an interest in fashion, commonly wearing polished patent leather shoes and tweed suits, which gained him the nickname &quot;Tweed&quot; or &quot;Tweedie&quot; among his friends. He liked flirting with girls and dancing. His brother A.D. later remarked, &quot;He kept flitting from chick to chick, and I decided I couldn&#x27;t keep up with him. Especially since he was crazy about dances, and just about the best jitterbug in town.&quot;

On April 13, 1944, in his junior year, King gave his first public speech during an oratorical contest. In his speech he stated, &quot;black America still wears chains. The finest negro is at the mercy of the meanest white man.&quot; King was selected as the winner of the contest. On the ride home to Atlanta by bus, he and his teacher were ordered by the driver to stand so that white passengers could sit. The driver of the bus called King a &quot;black son-of-a-bitch&quot;. King initially refused but complied after his teacher told him that he would be breaking the law if he did not. As all the seats were occupied, he and his teacher were forced to stand the rest of the way to Atlanta. Later King wrote of the incident: &quot;That night will never leave my memory. It was the angriest I have ever been in my life.&quot;

=== Morehouse College ===
During King&#x27;s junior year in high school, Morehouse College—an all-male historically black college that King&#x27;s father and maternal grandfather had attended—began accepting high school juniors who passed the entrance examination. As World War II was underway many black college students had been enlisted, so the university aimed to increase their enrollment by allowing juniors to apply. In 1944, aged 15, King passed the examination and was enrolled at the university that autumn.

In the summer before King started at Morehouse, he boarded a train with his friend—Emmett &quot;Weasel&quot; Proctor—and a group of other Morehouse College students to work in Simsbury, Connecticut, at the tobacco farm of Cullman Brothers Tobacco. This was King&#x27;s first trip into the integrated north. In a June 1944 letter to his father King wrote about the differences that struck him: &quot;On our way here we saw some things I had never anticipated to see. After we passed Washington there was no discrimination at all. The white people here are very nice. We go to any place we want to and sit anywhere we want to.&quot; The farm had partnered with Morehouse College to allot their wages towards the university&#x27;s tuition, housing, and fees. On weekdays King and the other students worked in the fields, picking tobacco from 7:00am to at least 5:00pm, enduring temperatures above 100 °F, to earn roughly USD$4 per day. On Friday evenings, the students visited downtown Simsbury to get milkshakes and watch movies, and on Saturdays they would travel to Hartford, Connecticut, to see theatre performances, shop and eat in restaurants. On Sundays they attended church services in Hartford, at a church filled with white congregants. King wrote to his parents about the lack of segregation, relaying how he was amazed they could go to &quot;one of the finest restaurants in Hartford&quot; and that &quot;Negroes and whites go to the same church&quot;.

He played freshman football there. The summer before his last year at Morehouse, in 1947, the 18-year-old King chose to enter the ministry. He would later credit the college&#x27;s president, Baptist minister Benjamin Mays, with being his &quot;spiritual mentor&quot;. King had concluded that the church offered the most assuring way to answer &quot;an inner urge to serve humanity&quot;, and he made peace with the Baptist Church, as he believed he would be a &quot;rational&quot; minister with sermons that were &quot;a respectful force for ideas, even social protest.&quot; King graduated from Morehouse with a Bachelor of Arts in sociology in 1948, aged nineteen.

== Religious education ==
King enrolled in Crozer Theological Seminary in Upland, Pennsylvania, and took several courses at the University of Pennsylvania. At Crozer, King was elected president of the student body. At Penn, King took courses with William Fontaine, Penn&#x27;s first African-American professor, and Elizabeth F. Flower, a professor of philosophy. King&#x27;s father supported his decision to continue his education and made arrangements for King to work with J. Pius Barbour, a family friend and Crozer alumnus who pastored at Calvary Baptist Church in nearby Chester, Pennsylvania. King became known as one of the &quot;Sons of Calvary&quot;, an honor he shared with William Augustus Jones Jr. and Samuel D. Proctor, who both went on to become well-known preachers.

King reproved another student for keeping beer in his room once, saying they shared responsibility as African Americans to bear &quot;the burdens of the Negro race&quot;. For a time, he was interested in Walter Rauschenbusch&#x27;s &quot;social gospel&quot;. In his third year at Crozer, King became romantically involved with the white daughter of an immigrant German woman who worked in the cafeteria. King planned to marry her, but friends, as well as King&#x27;s father, advised against it, saying that an interracial marriage would provoke animosity from both blacks and whites, potentially damaging his chances of ever pastoring a church in the South. King tearfully told a friend that he could not endure his mother&#x27;s pain over the marriage and broke the relationship off six months later. One friend was quoted as saying, &quot;He never recovered.&quot; Other friends, including Harry Belafonte, said Betty had been &quot;the love of King&#x27;s life.&quot; King graduated with a Bachelor of Divinity in 1951. He applied to the University of Edinburgh for a doctorate in the School of Divinity but ultimately chose Boston instead.

In 1951, King began doctoral studies in systematic theology at Boston University, and worked as an assistant minister at Boston&#x27;s historic Twelfth Baptist Church with William Hunter Hester. Hester was an old friend of King&#x27;s father and was an important influence on King. In Boston, King befriended a small cadre of local ministers his age, and sometimes guest pastored at their churches, including Michael E. Haynes, associate pastor at Twelfth Baptist Church in Roxbury. The young men often held bull sessions in their apartments, discussing theology, sermon style, and social issues.

At the age of 25 in 1954, King was called as pastor of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama. King received his PhD on June 5, 1955, with a dissertation (initially supervised by Edgar S. Brightman and, upon the latter&#x27;s death, by Lotan Harold DeWolf) titled &quot;A Comparison of the Conceptions of God in the Thinking of Paul Tillich and Henry Nelson Wieman&quot;.

An academic inquiry in October 1991 concluded that portions of his doctoral dissertation had been plagiarized and he had acted improperly. However, its finding, the committee said that &#x27;no thought should be given to the revocation of Dr. King&#x27;s doctoral degree,&#x27; an action that the panel said would serve no purpose.&quot; The committee found that the dissertation still &quot;makes an intelligent contribution to scholarship.&quot; A letter is now attached to the copy of King&#x27;s dissertation in the university library, noting that numerous passages were included without the appropriate quotations and citations of sources. Significant debate exists on how to interpret King&#x27;s plagiarism.

== Marriage and family ==

While studying at Boston University, he asked a friend from Atlanta named Mary Powell, a student at the New England Conservatory of Music, if she knew any nice Southern girls. Powell spoke to fellow student Coretta Scott; Scott was not interested in dating preachers but eventually agreed to allow King to telephone her based on Powell&#x27;s description and vouching. On their first call, King told Scott, &quot;I am like Napoleon at Waterloo before your charms,&quot; to which she replied, &quot;You haven&#x27;t even met me.&quot; King married Scott on June 18, 1953, on the lawn of her parents&#x27; house, in Heiberger, Alabama. They had four children: Yolanda King (1955–2007), Martin Luther King III (b. 1957), Dexter Scott King (1961–2024), and Bernice King (b. 1963). King limited Coretta&#x27;s role in the civil rights movement, expecting her to be a housewife and mother.

== Activism and organizational leadership ==

=== Montgomery bus boycott, 1955 ===
The Dexter Avenue Baptist Church was influential in the Montgomery African-American community. As the church&#x27;s pastor, King became known for his oratorical preaching in Montgomery and the surrounding region.

In March 1955, Claudette Colvin—a fifteen-year-old black schoolgirl in Montgomery—refused to give up her bus seat to a white man in violation of Jim Crow laws, local laws in the Southern United States that enforced racial segregation. Nine months later on December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat on a city bus. The two incidents led to the Montgomery bus boycott, which was urged and planned by Edgar Nixon and led by King. The other ministers asked him to take a leadership role because his relative newness to community leadership made it easier for him to speak out. King was hesitant but decided to do so if no one else wanted it.

The boycott lasted for 385 days, and the situation became so tense that King&#x27;s house was bombed. King was arrested for traveling 30 mph in a 25 mph zone and jailed, which overnight drew the attention of national media, and greatly increased King&#x27;s public stature. The controversy ended when the United States District Court issued a ruling in &quot;Browder v. Gayle&quot; that prohibited racial segregation on Montgomery public buses.

King&#x27;s role in the bus boycott transformed him into a national figure and the best-known spokesman of the civil rights movement.
=== Southern Christian Leadership Conference ===

In 1957, King, Ralph Abernathy, Fred Shuttlesworth, Joseph Lowery, and other civil rights activists founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). The group was created to harness the moral authority and organizing power of black churches to conduct nonviolent protests in the service of civil rights reform. The group was inspired by the crusades of evangelist Billy Graham, who befriended King, as well as the national organizing of the group In Friendship, founded by King allies Stanley Levison and Ella Baker. King led the SCLC until his death. The SCLC&#x27;s 1957 Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom was the first time King addressed a national audience.

Harry Wachtel joined King&#x27;s legal advisor Clarence B. Jones in defending four ministers of the SCLC in the libel case &quot;Abernathy et al. v. Sullivan&quot;; the case was litigated about the newspaper advertisement &quot;Heed Their Rising Voices&quot;. Wachtel founded a tax-exempt fund to cover the suit&#x27;s expenses and assist the nonviolent civil rights movement through a more effective means of fundraising. King served as honorary president of this organization, named the &quot;Gandhi Society for Human Rights&quot;. In 1962, King and the Gandhi Society produced a document that called on President Kennedy to issue an executive order to deliver a blow for civil rights as a kind of Second Emancipation Proclamation. Kennedy did not execute the order. The FBI, under written directive from Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, began tapping King&#x27;s telephone line in the fall of 1963. Kennedy was concerned that public allegations of communists in the SCLC would derail the administration&#x27;s civil rights initiatives. He warned King to discontinue these associations and later felt compelled to issue the written directive that authorized the FBI to wiretap King and other SCLC leaders. FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover feared the civil rights movement and investigated the allegations of communist infiltration. When no evidence emerged to support this, the FBI used the incidental details caught on tape over the next five years, as part of its COINTELPRO program, in attempts to force King out of his leadership position.

King believed that organized, nonviolent protest against the system of southern segregation known as Jim Crow laws would lead to extensive media coverage of the struggle for black equality. Journalistic accounts and televised footage of the daily indignities suffered by southern blacks, and of segregationist violence and harassment of civil rights supporters, produced a wave of sympathetic public opinion that convinced the majority of Americans that the civil rights movement was the most important issue in American politics in the early 1960s.

King organized and led marches for blacks&#x27; right to vote, desegregation, labor rights, and other basic civil rights. Most of these rights were successfully enacted into law with the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the 1965 Voting Rights Act.

The SCLC used tactics of nonviolent protest with great success by strategically choosing the methods and places in which protests were carried out. There were often dramatic stand-offs with segregationist authorities, who sometimes turned violent.

=== Survived knife attack, 1958 ===

On September 20, 1958, King was signing copies of his book &quot;Stride Toward Freedom&quot; in Blumstein&#x27;s department store in Harlem when Izola Curry—a mentally ill black woman who thought that King was conspiring against her with communists—stabbed him in the chest with a letter opener, which nearly impinged on the aorta. King received first aid by police officers Al Howard and Philip Romano. King underwent emergency surgery by Aubre de Lambert Maynard, Emil Naclerio and John W. V. Cordice; he remained hospitalized for several weeks. Curry was later found mentally incompetent to stand trial.

=== Atlanta sit-ins, prison sentence, and the 1960 elections ===

In December 1959, after being based in Montgomery for five years, King announced his return to Atlanta at the request of the SCLC. In Atlanta, King served until his death as co-pastor with his father at the Ebenezer Baptist Church. Georgia governor Ernest Vandiver expressed open hostility towards King&#x27;s return. He claimed that &quot;wherever M. L. King Jr., has been there has followed in his wake a wave of crimes&quot;, and vowed to keep King under surveillance. On May 4, 1960, King drove writer Lillian Smith to Emory University when police stopped them. King was cited for &quot;driving without a license&quot; because he had not yet been issued a Georgia license. King&#x27;s Alabama license was still valid, and Georgia law did not mandate any time limit for issuing a local license. King paid a fine but was unaware that his lawyer agreed to a plea deal that included probation.

Meanwhile, the Atlanta Student Movement had been acting to desegregate businesses and public spaces, organizing the Atlanta sit-ins from March 1960 onwards. In August the movement asked King to participate in a mass October sit-in, timed to highlight how 1960&#x27;s Presidential election campaigns had ignored civil rights. The coordinated day of action took place on October 19. King participated in a sit-in at the restaurant inside Rich&#x27;s, Atlanta&#x27;s largest department store, and was among the many arrested that day. The authorities released everyone over the next few days, except for King. Invoking his probationary plea deal, judge J. Oscar Mitchell sentenced King on October 25 to four months of hard labor. Before dawn the next day, King was transported to Georgia State Prison.

The arrest and harsh sentence drew nationwide attention. Many feared for King&#x27;s safety, as he started a prison sentence with people convicted of violent crimes, many of them White and hostile to his activism. Both Presidential candidates were asked to weigh in, at a time when both parties were courting the support of Southern Whites and their political leadership including Governor Vandiver. Nixon, with whom King had a closer relationship before, declined to make a statement despite a personal visit from Jackie Robinson requesting his intervention. Nixon&#x27;s opponent John F. Kennedy called the governor (a Democrat) directly, enlisted his brother Robert to exert more pressure on state authorities, and, at the personal request of Sargent Shriver, called King&#x27;s wife to offer his help. The pressure from Kennedy and others proved effective, and King was released two days later. King&#x27;s father decided to openly endorse Kennedy&#x27;s candidacy for the November 8 election which he narrowly won.

After the October 19 sit-ins and following unrest, a 30-day truce was declared in Atlanta for desegregation negotiations. However, the negotiations failed and sit-ins and boycotts resumed for several months. On March 7, 1961, a group of Black elders including King notified student leaders that a deal had been reached: the city&#x27;s lunch counters would desegregate in fall 1961, in conjunction with the court-mandated desegregation of schools. Many students were disappointed at the compromise. In a large meeting on March 10 at Warren Memorial Methodist Church, the audience was hostile and frustrated. King then gave an impassioned speech calling participants to resist the &quot;cancerous disease of disunity&quot;, helping to calm tensions.

=== Albany Movement, 1961 ===

The Albany Movement was a desegregation coalition formed in Albany, Georgia, in November 1961. In December, King and the SCLC became involved. The movement mobilized thousands of citizens for a nonviolent attack on every aspect of segregation in the city and attracted nationwide attention. When King first visited on December 15, 1961, he &quot;had planned to stay a day or so and return home after giving counsel.&quot; The following day he was swept up in a mass arrest of peaceful demonstrators, and he declined bail until the city made concessions. According to King, &quot;that agreement was dishonored and violated by the city&quot; after he left.

King returned in July 1962 and was given the option of forty-five days in jail or a $178 fine (); he chose jail. Three days into his sentence, Police Chief Laurie Pritchett discreetly arranged for King&#x27;s fine to be paid and ordered his release. &quot;We had witnessed persons being kicked off lunch counter stools ... ejected from churches ... and thrown into jail ... But for the first time, we witnessed being kicked out of jail.&quot; It was later acknowledged by the King Center that Billy Graham was the one who bailed King out.

After nearly a year of intense activism with few tangible results, the movement began to deteriorate. King requested a halt to all demonstrations and a &quot;Day of Penance&quot; to promote nonviolence and maintain the moral high ground. Divisions within the black community and the canny, low-key response by local government defeated efforts. Though the Albany effort proved a key lesson in tactics for King and the national civil rights movement, the national media was highly critical of King&#x27;s role in the defeat, and the SCLC&#x27;s lack of results contributed to a growing gulf between the organization and the more radical SNCC. After Albany, King sought to choose engagements for the SCLC in which he could control the circumstances, rather than entering into pre-existing situations.

=== Birmingham campaign, 1963 ===
In April 1963, the SCLC began a campaign against racial segregation and economic injustice in Birmingham, Alabama. The campaign used nonviolent but intentionally confrontational tactics, developed in part by Wyatt Tee Walker. Black people in Birmingham, organizing with the SCLC, occupied public spaces with marches and sit-ins, openly violating laws that they considered unjust.

King&#x27;s intent was to provoke mass arrests and &quot;create a situation so crisis-packed that it will inevitably open the door to negotiation.&quot; The campaign&#x27;s early volunteers did not succeed in shutting down the city, or in drawing media attention to the police&#x27;s actions. Over the concerns of an uncertain King, SCLC strategist James Bevel changed the course of the campaign by recruiting children and young adults to join the demonstrations. &quot;Newsweek&quot; called this strategy a Children&#x27;s Crusade.

The Birmingham Police Department, led by Eugene &quot;Bull&quot; Connor, used high-pressure water jets and police dogs against protesters, including children. Footage of the police response was broadcast on national television news, shocking many white Americans and consolidating black Americans behind the movement. Not all of the demonstrators were peaceful, despite the avowed intentions of the SCLC. In some cases, bystanders attacked the police, who responded with force. King and the SCLC were criticized for putting children in harm&#x27;s way. But the campaign was a success: Connor lost his job, the &quot;Jim Crow&quot; signs came down, and public places became more open to blacks. King&#x27;s reputation improved immensely.

King was arrested and jailed early in the campaign—his 13th arrest out of 29. From his cell, he composed the now-famous &quot;Letter from Birmingham Jail&quot; that responds to calls to pursue legal channels for social change. The letter has been described as &quot;one of the most important historical documents penned by a modern political prisoner&quot;. King argues that the crisis of racism is too urgent, and the current system too entrenched: &quot;We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed.&quot; He points out that the Boston Tea Party, a celebrated act of rebellion in the American colonies, was illegal civil disobedience, and that, conversely, &quot;everything Adolf Hitler did in Germany was &#x27;legal&#x27;.&quot; Walter Reuther, president of the United Auto Workers, arranged for $160,000 to bail out King and his fellow protestors.
=== March on Washington, 1963 ===


King, representing the SCLC, was among the leaders of the &quot;Big Six&quot; civil rights organizations who were instrumental in the organization of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which took place on August 28, 1963. The other leaders and organizations comprising the Big Six were Roy Wilkins from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People; Whitney Young, National Urban League; A. Philip Randolph, Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters; John Lewis, SNCC; and James L. Farmer Jr., Congress of Racial Equality.

Bayard Rustin&#x27;s open homosexuality, support of socialism, and former ties to the Communist Party USA caused many white and African-American leaders to demand King distance himself from Rustin, which King agreed to do. However, he did collaborate in the 1963 March on Washington, for which Rustin was the primary organizer. For King, this role was another which courted controversy, since he was one of the key figures who acceded to the wishes of President Kennedy in changing the focus of the march. Kennedy initially opposed the march outright, because he was concerned it would negatively impact the drive for passage of civil rights legislation. However, the organizers were firm that the march would proceed. With the march going forward, the Kennedys decided it was important to ensure its success. President Kennedy was concerned the turnout would be less than 100,000 and enlisted the aid of additional church leaders and Walter Reuther, president of the United Automobile Workers, to help mobilize demonstrators.
The march originally was planned to dramatize the desperate condition of blacks in the southern U.S. and place organizers&#x27; concerns and grievances squarely before the seat of power in the nation&#x27;s capital. Organizers intended to denounce the federal government for its failure to safeguard the civil rights and physical safety of civil rights workers and blacks. The group acquiesced to presidential pressure, and the event ultimately took on a far less strident tone. As a result, some civil rights activists felt it presented an inaccurate, sanitized pageant of racial harmony; Malcolm X called it the &quot;Farce on Washington&quot;, and the Nation of Islam forbade its members from attending.

The march made specific demands: an end to racial segregation in public schools; meaningful civil rights legislation, including a law prohibiting racial discrimination in employment; protection of civil rights workers from police brutality; a $2 minimum wage for all workers (); and self-government for Washington, D.C., then governed by congressional committee. Despite tensions, the march was a resounding success. More than a quarter of a million people of diverse ethnicities attended, sprawling from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial onto the National Mall. At the time, it was the largest gathering of protesters in Washington, D.C.&#x27;s history.

King delivered a 17-minute speech, later known as &quot;I Have a Dream&quot;. In the speech&#x27;s most famous passagein which he departed from his prepared text, possibly at the prompting of Mahalia Jackson, who shouted behind him, &quot;Tell them about the dream!&quot;King said:

&quot;I Have a Dream&quot; came to be regarded as one of the finest speeches in the history of American oratory. The March, and especially King&#x27;s speech, helped put civil rights at the top of the agenda of reformers and facilitated passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
=== St. Augustine, Florida, 1964 ===

In March 1964, King and the SCLC joined forces with Robert Hayling&#x27;s then-controversial movement in St. Augustine, Florida. Hayling&#x27;s group had been affiliated with the NAACP but was forced out of the organization for advocating armed self-defense alongside nonviolent tactics. However, the pacifist SCLC accepted them. King and the SCLC worked to bring white Northern activists to St. Augustine, including a delegation of rabbis and the 72-year-old mother of the governor of Massachusetts, all of whom were arrested. During June, the movement marched nightly through the city, &quot;often facing counter demonstrations by the Klan, and provoking violence that garnered national media attention.&quot; Hundreds of the marchers were arrested and jailed. During this movement, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed.

=== Biddeford, Maine, 1964 ===
On May 7, 1964, King spoke at Saint Francis College&#x27;s &quot;The Negro and the Quest for Identity&quot;, in Biddeford, Maine. This was a symposium that brought together many civil rights leaders. King spoke about how &quot;We must get rid of the idea of superior and inferior races,&quot; through nonviolent tactics.

=== New York City, 1964 ===

On February 6, 1964, King delivered the inaugural speech of a lecture series initiated at the New School called &quot;The American Race Crisis&quot;. In his remarks, King referred to a conversation he had recently had with Jawaharlal Nehru in which he compared the sad condition of many African Americans to that of India&#x27;s untouchables. In his March 18, 1964, interview with Robert Penn Warren, King compared his activism to his father&#x27;s, citing his training in non-violence as a key difference. He also discusses the next phase of the civil rights movement and integration.

=== Scripto strike in Atlanta, 1964 ===

Starting in November 1964, King supported a labor strike by several hundred workers at the Scripto factory in Atlanta, just a few blocks from Ebenezer Baptist. Many of the strikers were congregants of his church, and the strike was supported by other civil rights leaders. King helped elevate the labor dispute from a local to nationally known event and led the SCLC to organize a nationwide boycott of Scripto products. However, as the strike stretched into December, King, who was wanting to focus more on a civil rights campaign in Selma, Alabama, began to negotiate in secret with Scripto&#x27;s president Carl Singer and eventually brokered a deal where the SCLC would call off their boycott in exchange for the company giving the striking employees their Christmas bonuses. King&#x27;s involvement in the strike ended on December 24 and a contract between the company and union was signed on January 9.

=== Selma voting rights movement and &quot;Bloody Sunday&quot;, 1965 ===

In December 1964, King and the SCLC joined forces with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in Selma, Alabama, where the SNCC had been working on voter registration for several months. A local judge issued an injunction that barred any gathering of three or more people affiliated with the SNCC, SCLC, DCVL, or any of 41 named civil rights leaders. This injunction temporarily halted civil rights activity until King defied it by speaking at Brown Chapel on January 2, 1965. During the 1965 march to Montgomery, Alabama, violence by state police and others against the peaceful marchers resulted in much publicity, which made racism in Alabama visible nationwide.

Acting on James Bevel&#x27;s call for a march from Selma to Montgomery, Bevel and other SCLC members, in partial collaboration with SNCC, attempted to organize a march to the state&#x27;s capital. The first attempt to march on March 7, 1965, at which King was not present, was aborted because of mob and police violence against the demonstrators. This day has become known as Bloody Sunday and was a major turning point in the effort to gain public support for the civil rights movement. It was the clearest demonstration up to that time of the dramatic potential of King and Bevel&#x27;s nonviolence strategy.

On March 5, King met with officials in the Johnson Administration to request an injunction against any prosecution of the demonstrators. He did not attend the march due to church duties, but he later wrote, &quot;If I had any idea that the state troopers would use the kind of brutality they did, I would have felt compelled to give up my church duties altogether to lead the line.&quot; Footage of police brutality against the protesters was broadcast extensively and aroused national public outrage.

King next attempted to organize a march for March 9. The SCLC petitioned for an injunction in federal court against Alabama; this was denied and the judge issued an order blocking the march until after a hearing. Nonetheless, King led marchers on March 9 to the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, then held a short prayer session before turning the marchers around and asking them to disperse so as not to violate the court order. The unexpected ending of this second march aroused the surprise and anger of many within the local movement. The march finally went ahead fully on March 25, 1965. At the conclusion of the march on the steps of the state capitol, King delivered a speech that became known as &quot;How Long, Not Long&quot;. King stated that equal rights for African Americans could not be far away, &quot;because the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice&quot; and &quot;you shall reap what you sow&quot;.

=== Chicago open housing movement, 1966 ===

In 1966, after several successes in the south, King, Bevel, and others in the civil rights organizations took the movement to the North. King and Ralph Abernathy, both from the middle class, moved into a building at 1550 S. Hamlin Avenue, in the slums of North Lawndale on Chicago&#x27;s West Side, as an educational experience and to demonstrate their support and empathy for the poor.

The SCLC formed a coalition with Coordinating Council of Community Organizations (CCCO), an organization founded by Albert Raby, and the combined organizations&#x27; efforts were fostered under the aegis of the Chicago Freedom Movement.
During that spring, several white couple/black couple tests of real estate offices uncovered racial steering, discriminatory processing of housing requests by couples who were exact matches in income and background. Several larger marches were planned and executed: in Bogan, Belmont Cragin, Jefferson Park, Evergreen Park, Gage Park, Marquette Park, and others.

King later stated and Abernathy wrote that the movement received a worse reception in Chicago than in the South. Marches, especially the one through Marquette Park on August 5, 1966, were met by thrown bottles and screaming throngs. Rioting seemed very possible. King&#x27;s beliefs militated against his staging a violent event, and he negotiated an agreement with Mayor Richard J. Daley to cancel a march in order to avoid the violence that he feared would result. King was hit by a brick during one march, but continued to lead marches in the face of personal danger.

When King and his allies returned to the South, they left Jesse Jackson, a seminary student who had previously joined the movement in the South, in charge of their organization. Jackson continued their struggle for civil rights by organizing the Operation Breadbasket movement that targeted chain stores that did not deal fairly with blacks.

A 1967 CIA document declassified in 2017 downplayed King&#x27;s role in the &quot;black militant situation&quot; in Chicago, with a source stating that King &quot;sought at least constructive, positive projects.&quot;

=== Opposition to the Vietnam War ===


King was long opposed to American involvement in the Vietnam War, but at first avoided the topic in public speeches to avoid the interference with civil rights goals that criticism of President Johnson&#x27;s policies might have created. At the urging of SCLC&#x27;s former Director of Direct Action and now the head of the Spring Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam, James Bevel, and inspired by the outspokenness of Muhammad Ali, King eventually agreed to publicly oppose the war as opposition was growing among the American public.

During an April 4, 1967, appearance at the New York City Riverside Church, King delivered a speech titled &quot;Beyond Vietnam: A Time to Break Silence&quot;. He spoke strongly against the U.S.&#x27;s role in the war, arguing that the U.S. was in Vietnam &quot;to occupy it as an American colony&quot; and calling the U.S. government &quot;the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today&quot;. He connected the war with economic injustice, arguing that the country needed serious moral change:

King opposed the Vietnam War because it took money and resources that could have been spent on social welfare at home. He summed up this aspect by saying, &quot;A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death.&quot; He stated that North Vietnam &quot;did not begin to send in any large number of supplies or men until American forces had arrived in the tens of thousands&quot;, and accused the U.S. of having killed a million Vietnamese, &quot;mostly children&quot;. King also criticized American opposition to North Vietnam&#x27;s land reforms.

King&#x27;s opposition cost him significant support among white allies including President Johnson, Billy Graham, union leaders, and powerful publishers. &quot;The press is being stacked against me&quot;, King said, complaining of what he described as a double standard that applauded his nonviolence at home, but deplored it when applied &quot;toward little brown Vietnamese children&quot;. &quot;Life&quot; magazine called the speech &quot;demagogic slander that sounded like a script for Radio Hanoi&quot;, and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; declared that King had &quot;diminished his usefulness to his cause, his country, his people.&quot;
The &quot;Beyond Vietnam&quot; speech reflected King&#x27;s evolving political advocacy in his later years, which paralleled the teachings of the progressive Highlander Research and Education Center, with which he was affiliated. King began to speak of the need for fundamental changes in the American political and economic situation, and more frequently expressed his opposition to the war and his desire to see a redistribution of resources to correct injustice. He guarded his language in public to avoid being linked to communism, but in private he sometimes spoke of his support for democratic socialism.

King stated in &quot;Beyond Vietnam&quot; that &quot;true compassion is more than flinging a coin to a beggar ... it comes to see that an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring.&quot; King quoted a U.S. official who said that from Vietnam to Latin America, the country was &quot;on the wrong side of a world revolution.&quot; King condemned America&#x27;s &quot;alliance with the landed gentry of Latin America&quot;, and said that the U.S. should support &quot;the shirtless and barefoot people&quot; in the Third World rather than suppressing their attempts at revolution.

King&#x27;s stance on Vietnam encouraged Allard K. Lowenstein, William Sloane Coffin and Norman Thomas, with the support of anti-war Democrats, to attempt to persuade King to run against President Johnson in the 1968 presidential election. King contemplated but ultimately decided against the proposal as he felt uneasy with politics and considered himself better suited to activism.

On April 15, 1967, King spoke at an anti-war march from Manhattan&#x27;s Central Park to the United Nations. The march was organized by the Spring Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam under chairman James Bevel. At the U.N. King brought up issues of civil rights and the draft:

Seeing an opportunity to unite civil rights and anti-war activists, Bevel convinced King to become even more active in the anti-war effort. Despite his growing public opposition to the Vietnam War, King was not fond of the hippie culture which developed from the anti-war movement. In his 1967 Massey Lecture, King stated:

On January 13, 1968, King called for a large march on Washington against &quot;one of history&#x27;s most cruel and senseless wars&quot;:

==== Correspondence with Thích Nhất Hạnh ====
Thích Nhất Hạnh was an influential Vietnamese Buddhist who wrote a letter to Martin Luther King Jr. in 1965 entitled: &quot;In Search of the Enemy of Man&quot;. It was during his 1966 stay in the US that Nhất Hạnh met with King and urged him to publicly denounce the Vietnam War. In 1967, King gave a famous speech at the Riverside Church in New York City, his first to publicly question U.S. involvement in Vietnam. Later that year, King nominated Nhất Hạnh for the Nobel Peace Prize. In his nomination, King said, &quot;I do not personally know of anyone more worthy of [this prize] than this gentle monk from Vietnam. His ideas for peace, if applied, would build a monument to ecumenism, to world brotherhood, to humanity&quot;.

=== Poor People&#x27;s Campaign, 1968 ===

In 1968, King and the SCLC organized the &quot;Poor People&#x27;s Campaign&quot; to address issues of economic justice. King traveled the country to assemble &quot;a multiracial army of the poor&quot; that would march on Washington to engage in nonviolent civil disobedience at the Capitol until Congress created an &quot;economic bill of rights&quot;.

The campaign was preceded by King&#x27;s final book, &quot;Where Do We Go from Here: Chaos or Community?&quot; which laid out his view of how to address social issues and poverty. King quoted from Henry George&#x27;s book &quot;Progress and Poverty&quot;, particularly in support of a guaranteed basic income. The campaign culminated in a march on Washington, D.C., demanding economic aid to the poorest communities of the U.S.

King and the SCLC called on the government to invest in rebuilding America&#x27;s cities. He felt that Congress had shown &quot;hostility to the poor&quot; by spending &quot;military funds with alacrity and generosity&quot;. He contrasted this with the situation faced by poor Americans, claiming that Congress had merely provided &quot;poverty funds with miserliness&quot;. His vision was for change that was more revolutionary than mere reform: he cited systematic flaws of &quot;racism, poverty, militarism and materialism&quot;, and argued that &quot;reconstruction of society itself is the real issue to be faced.&quot;

The Poor People&#x27;s Campaign was controversial even within the civil rights movement. Rustin resigned from the march, stating that the goals of the campaign were too broad, that its demands were unrealizable, and that he thought that these campaigns would accelerate repression on the poor and the black.

=== Global policy ===
King was one of the signatories of the agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution. As a result, in 1968 a World Constituent Assembly convened to draft and adopt the Constitution for the Federation of Earth.

== Assassination and aftermath ==

On March 29, 1968, King went to Memphis, Tennessee, in support of the black sanitation workers, who were represented by American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) Local 1733. The workers had been on strike since March 12 for higher wages and better treatment. In one incident, black street repairmen received pay for two hours when they were sent home because of bad weather, but white employees were paid for the full day.

On April 3, King addressed a rally and delivered his &quot;I&#x27;ve Been to the Mountaintop&quot; address at Mason Temple. King&#x27;s flight to Memphis had been delayed by a bomb threat against his plane. In reference to the bomb threat, King said:

King was booked in Room 306 at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis. Ralph Abernathy, who was present at the assassination, testified to the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations that King and his entourage stayed at Room 306 so often that it was known as the &quot;King-Abernathy suite&quot;. According to Jesse Jackson, who was present, King&#x27;s last words were spoken to musician Ben Branch, who was scheduled to perform that night at an event King was attending: &quot;Ben, make sure you play &#x27;Take My Hand, Precious Lord&#x27; in the meeting tonight. Play it real pretty.&quot;

King was fatally shot by James Earl Ray at 6:01 p.m., Thursday, April 4, 1968, as he stood on the motel&#x27;s second-floor balcony. The bullet entered through his right cheek, smashing his jaw, then traveled down his spinal cord before lodging in his shoulder. Abernathy heard the shot from inside the motel room and ran to the balcony to find King on the floor.

After emergency surgery, King died at St. Joseph&#x27;s Hospital at 7:05 p.m. According to biographer Taylor Branch, King&#x27;s autopsy revealed that though only 39 years old, he &quot;had the heart of a 60 year old&quot;, which Branch attributed to stress. King was initially interred in South View Cemetery in South Atlanta, but in 1977, his remains were transferred to a tomb on the site of the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park.

=== Aftermath ===

The assassination led to race riots in Washington, D.C., Chicago, Baltimore, Louisville, Kansas City, and dozens of other cities. Presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy was on his way to Indianapolis for a campaign rally when he was informed of King&#x27;s death. He gave a short, improvised speech to the gathering of supporters informing them of the tragedy and urging them to continue King&#x27;s ideal of nonviolence. The following day, he delivered a prepared response in Cleveland. James Farmer Jr. and other civil rights leaders also called for non-violent action, while the more militant Stokely Carmichael called for a more forceful response. The city of Memphis quickly settled the strike on terms favorable to the sanitation workers.

The plan to set up a shantytown in Washington, D.C., was carried out soon after the April 4 assassination. Criticism of King&#x27;s plan was subdued in the wake of his death, and the SCLC received an unprecedented wave of donations to carry it out. The campaign officially began in Memphis, on May 2, at the hotel where King was murdered. Thousands of demonstrators arrived on the National Mall and stayed for six weeks, establishing a camp they called &quot;Resurrection City&quot;.

President Johnson tried to quell the riots by making telephone calls to civil rights leaders, mayors and governors and told politicians that they should warn the police against the unwarranted use of force. &quot;I&#x27;m not getting through,&quot; Johnson told his aides. &quot;They&#x27;re all holing up like generals in a dugout getting ready to watch a war.&quot; Johnson declared April 7 a national day of mourning for King. Vice President Hubert Humphrey attended King&#x27;s funeral on behalf of the President, as there were fears that Johnson&#x27;s presence might incite protests and perhaps violence. At his widow&#x27;s request, King&#x27;s last sermon at Ebenezer Baptist Church, given on February 4, 1968, was played at the funeral,

His good friend Mahalia Jackson sang his favorite hymn, &quot;Take My Hand, Precious Lord&quot;, at the funeral. The assassination helped to spur the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1968. Two months after King&#x27;s death, James Earl Ray—on the loose from a previous prison escape—was captured at London Heathrow Airport while trying to reach white-ruled Rhodesia on a false Canadian passport. He was using the alias Ramon George Sneyd. Ray was quickly extradited to Tennessee and charged with King&#x27;s murder. He confessed on March 10, 1969, though he recanted this confession three days later. On the advice of his attorney Percy Foreman, Ray pleaded guilty to avoid the possibility of the death penalty. He was sentenced to a 99-year prison term. Ray later claimed a man he met in Montreal, Quebec, with the alias &quot;Raoul&quot; was involved and that the assassination was the result of a conspiracy. He spent the remainder of his life attempting, unsuccessfully, to withdraw his guilty plea and secure the trial he never had. Ray died in 1998 at age 70.

=== Allegations of conspiracy ===

Ray&#x27;s lawyers maintained he was a scapegoat similar to the way that John F. Kennedy&#x27;s assassin Lee Harvey Oswald is seen by conspiracy theorists. Supporters of this assertion said that Ray&#x27;s confession was given under pressure and that he had been threatened with the death penalty. They admitted that Ray was a thief and burglar, but claimed that he had no record of committing violent crimes with a weapon. However, prison records in different U.S. cities have shown that he was incarcerated on numerous occasions for armed robbery. In a 2008 interview with CNN, Jerry Ray, the younger brother of James Earl Ray, claimed that James was smart and was sometimes able to get away with armed robbery. &quot;I never been with nobody as bold as he is,&quot; Jerry said. &quot;He just walked in and put that gun on somebody, it was just like it&#x27;s an everyday thing.&quot;

Those suspecting a conspiracy point to the two successive ballistics tests which proved that a rifle similar to Ray&#x27;s Remington Gamemaster had been the murder weapon. Those tests did not implicate Ray&#x27;s specific rifle. Witnesses near King said that the shot came from another location, from behind thick shrubbery near the boarding house—which had been cut away in the days following the assassination—and not from the boarding house window. However, Ray&#x27;s fingerprints were found on various objects in the bathroom where it was determined the gunfire came from. An examination of the rifle containing Ray&#x27;s fingerprints determined that at least one shot was fired from the firearm at the time of the assassination.

In 1997, King&#x27;s son Dexter Scott King met with Ray, and publicly supported Ray&#x27;s efforts to obtain a new trial. Two years later, King&#x27;s widow Coretta Scott King and the couple&#x27;s children, represented by William F. Pepper, won a wrongful death claim against Loyd Jowers and &quot;other unknown co-conspirators&quot;. Jowers claimed to have received $100,000 to arrange King&#x27;s assassination. The jury found Jowers to be complicit in a conspiracy and that government agencies were party to the assassination. 

In 2000, the U.S. Department of Justice completed the investigation into Jowers&#x27; claims but did not find evidence of conspiracy. The investigation report recommended no further investigation unless new reliable facts are presented. A sister of Jowers admitted that he had fabricated the story so he could make $300,000 from selling the story, and she corroborated his story to get money to pay her income tax.

In 2002, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that a church minister, Ronald Denton Wilson, claimed his father, Henry Clay Wilson, assassinated King. He stated, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t a racist thing; he thought Martin Luther King was connected with communism, and he wanted to get him out of the way.&quot; Wilson provided no evidence to back up his claims.

King researchers David Garrow and Gerald Posner disagreed with Pepper&#x27;s claims that the government killed King. In 2003, Pepper published a book about the investigation and trial, as well as his representation of James Earl Ray in his bid for a trial. James Bevel also disputed the argument that Ray acted alone, stating, &quot;There is no way a ten-cent white boy could develop a plan to kill a million-dollar black man.&quot; In 2004, Jesse Jackson stated:

On January 23, 2025 President Donald Trump signed an Executive Order declassifying the records concerning the assassination.

== Legacy ==

=== South Africa ===
King&#x27;s legacy includes influences on the Black Consciousness Movement and civil rights movement in South Africa. King&#x27;s work was cited by, and served as, an inspiration for South African leader Albert Luthuli, who fought for racial justice in his country during apartheid and was later awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.

=== United Kingdom ===

John Hume, the former leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, cited King&#x27;s legacy as quintessential to the Northern Ireland civil rights movement and the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, calling him &quot;one of my great heroes of the century&quot;.

The Martin Luther King Fund and Foundation in the UK was set up as a charity on December 30, 1969, after King&#x27;s assassination and following a visit to the UK in 1969 by his widow, Coretta King. The Foundation&#x27;s first chairman, Canon John Collins, stated that the Foundation was to be an active UK national campaign for racial equality, its work also to include community projects in areas of social need, and education. International Personnel (IP), an employment agency, was formed in 1970 out of the foundation&#x27;s base in Balham, to find employment for professionally qualified black people. In its first year, the agency placed ten percent of its applicants in jobs equal to their ability. The Balham Training Scheme operated an evening school with lecturers in Typing, Shorthand, English and Math. The foundation was removed from the Charity Commission list on November 18, 1996, as it had ceased to exist.
The Northumbria and Newcastle Universities Martin Luther King Peace Committee still exists to honor King&#x27;s legacy, as represented by his final visit to the UK to receive an honorary degree from Newcastle University in 1967. Northumbria and Newcastle remain centers for the study of Martin Luther King and the US civil rights movement. Inspired by King&#x27;s vision, the committee undertakes a range of activities across the UK to &quot;build cultures of peace&quot;.

In 2017, Newcastle University unveiled a bronze statue of King to celebrate the 50th anniversary of his honorary doctorate ceremony. The Students Union also voted to rename their bar &quot;Luther&#x27;s&quot;.

=== United States ===
King has become a national icon in the history of American liberalism and American progressivism. His main legacy was to secure progress on civil rights in the U.S. Just days after King&#x27;s assassination, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1968. Title VIII of the Act, commonly known as the Fair Housing Act, prohibited discrimination in housing and housing-related transactions on the basis of race, religion, or national origin (later expanded to include sex, familial status, and disability). This legislation was seen as a tribute to King&#x27;s struggle in his final years to combat residential discrimination. The day following King&#x27;s assassination, teacher Jane Elliott conducted her first &quot;Blue Eyes/Brown Eyes&quot; exercise with her class of elementary school students to help them understand King&#x27;s death as it related to racism.

King&#x27;s wife Coretta Scott King was active in matters of social justice and civil rights until her death in 2006. The same year that King was assassinated, she established the King Center in Atlanta, Georgia, dedicated to preserving his legacy and the work of championing nonviolent conflict resolution and tolerance worldwide. Their son, Dexter King, who died in 2024, served as the center&#x27;s chairman until 2010. In 2010, Martin Luther King III became president. In 2012, King&#x27;s youngest child, Bernice King, became the CEO. Daughter Yolanda King, who died in 2007, was a motivational speaker, author and founder of Higher Ground Productions, an organization specializing in diversity training.

Within the King family, members disagree about his views about LGBT people. King&#x27;s widow Coretta publicly said that she believed her husband would have supported gay rights. However, his youngest child, Bernice King, has said that he would have been opposed to gay marriage.

==== Martin Luther King Jr. Day ====

Beginning in 1971, cities and states established annual holidays to honor King. On November 2, 1983, President Ronald Reagan signed a bill creating a federal holiday to honor King. Observed for the first time on January 20, 1986, it is called Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Following President George H. W. Bush&#x27;s 1992 proclamation, the holiday is observed on the third Monday of January each year, near the time of King&#x27;s birthday. On January 17, 2000, for the first time, Martin Luther King Jr. Day was officially observed in all fifty U.S. states. Arizona (1992), New Hampshire (1999) and Utah (2000) were the last states to recognize the holiday. Utah previously celebrated the holiday under the name Human Rights Day.

== Veneration ==

King was canonized by Archbishop Timothy Paul of the Holy Christian Orthodox Church on September 9, 2016. His feast day was set as April 4, the date of his assassination. King is also honored with a Lesser Feast on the liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church on April 4 or January 15, the anniversary of his birth. The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America commemorates King liturgically on January 15.

== Ideas, influences, and political stances ==

=== Christianity ===
As a Christian minister, King&#x27;s main influence was Jesus Christ and the Christian gospels, which he would almost always quote in his speeches. King&#x27;s faith was strongly based in the Golden Rule, loving God above all, and loving your enemies. His nonviolent thought was also based in the injunction to &quot;turn the other cheek&quot; in the Sermon on the Mount, and Jesus&#x27; teaching of putting the sword back into its place (Matthew 26:52). In his Letter from Birmingham Jail, King urged action consistent with what he describes as Jesus&#x27; &quot;extremist&quot; love, and also quoted numerous other Christian pacifist authors. In another sermon, he stated:

King&#x27;s private writings show that he rejected biblical literalism; he described the Bible as &quot;mythological&quot;, doubted that Jesus was born of a virgin and did not believe that the story of Jonah and the whale was true.

Among the thinkers who influenced King&#x27;s theological outlook were L. Harold DeWolf, Edgar Brightman, Peter Bertocci, Walter George Muelder, Walter Rauschenbusch, and Reinhold Niebuhr.

==== &quot;The Measure of a Man&quot; ====
In 1959, King published a short book called &quot;The Measure of a Man&quot;, which contained his sermons &quot;What is Man?&quot; and &quot;The Dimensions of a Complete Life&quot;. The sermons argued for man&#x27;s need for God&#x27;s love and criticized the racial injustices of Western civilization.

=== Nonviolence ===

African-American civil rights activist Bayard Rustin was King&#x27;s first regular advisor on nonviolence. King was also advised by the white activists Harris Wofford and Glenn Smiley. Rustin and Smiley came from the Christian pacifist tradition, and Wofford and Rustin both studied Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s teachings. Rustin had applied nonviolence with the Journey of Reconciliation campaign in the 1940s, and Wofford had been promoting Gandhism to Southern blacks since the early 1950s.

King initially knew little about Gandhi and rarely used the term &quot;nonviolence&quot; during his early activism. King initially believed in and practiced self-defense, even obtaining guns to defend against possible attackers. The pacifists showing him the alternative of nonviolent resistance, arguing that this would be a better means to accomplish his goals. King then vowed to no longer personally use arms.

In a chapter of &quot;Stride Toward Freedom&quot;, King outlined his understanding of nonviolence, which seeks to win an opponent to friendship, rather than to humiliate or defeat him. The chapter draws from an address by Wofford, with Rustin and Stanley Levison also providing guidance and ghostwriting.

King was inspired by Gandhi and his success with nonviolent activism, and as a theology student, King described Gandhi as being one of the &quot;individuals who greatly reveal the working of the Spirit of God&quot;. King had &quot;for a long time ... wanted to take a trip to India.&quot; With assistance from Harris Wofford, the American Friends Service Committee, and other supporters, he was able to fund the journey in April 1959. The trip deepened his understanding of nonviolent resistance and his commitment to America&#x27;s struggle for civil rights. In a radio address made during his final evening in India, King reflected, &quot;Since being in India, I am more convinced than ever before that the method of nonviolent resistance is the most potent weapon available to oppressed people in their struggle for justice and human dignity.&quot;

When receiving the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, King hailed the &quot;successful precedent&quot; of using nonviolence &quot;in a magnificent way by Mohandas K. Gandhi to challenge the might of the British Empire ... He struggled only with the weapons of truth, soul force, non-injury and courage.&quot;

Another influence for King&#x27;s nonviolent method was Henry David Thoreau&#x27;s essay &quot;On Civil Disobedience&quot; and its theme of refusing to cooperate with an evil system. He also was greatly influenced by the works of Protestant theologians Reinhold Niebuhr and Paul Tillich, and said that Walter Rauschenbusch&#x27;s &quot;Christianity and the Social Crisis&quot; left an &quot;indelible imprint&quot; on his thinking by giving him a theological grounding for his social concerns. King was moved by Rauschenbusch&#x27;s vision of Christians spreading social unrest in &quot;perpetual but friendly conflict&quot; with the state, simultaneously critiquing it and calling it to act as an instrument of justice. However, he was apparently unaware of the American tradition of Christian pacifism exemplified by Adin Ballou and William Lloyd Garrison. King frequently referred to Jesus&#x27; Sermon on the Mount as central for his work. Before 1960, King also sometimes used the concept of &quot;agape&quot; (brotherly Christian love).

Even after renouncing personal use of guns, King had a complex relationship with self-defense in the movement. He publicly discouraged it as a widespread practice but acknowledged that it was sometimes necessary. Throughout his career King was frequently protected by other civil rights activists who carried arms, such as Colonel Stone Johnson, Robert Hayling, and the Deacons for Defense and Justice.

=== Criticism within the movement ===
King was criticized by other black leaders in the civil rights movement. This included more militant thinkers such as Nation of Islam member Malcolm X. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee founder Ella Baker regarded King as a charismatic media figure who lost touch with the grassroots of the movement as he became close to elite figures like Nelson Rockefeller. Stokely Carmichael, a protege of Baker&#x27;s, became a black separatist and disagreed with King&#x27;s plea for racial integration because he considered it an insult to a uniquely African-American culture. He also took issue that King&#x27;s non-violence approach depended on appealing to America&#x27;s conscience, feeling America had none to appeal to.

=== Activism and involvement with Native Americans ===
King was an avid supporter of Native American rights and Native Americans were active supporters of King&#x27;s civil rights movement. The Native American Rights Fund (NARF) was patterned after the NAACP&#x27;s Legal Defense and Education Fund. The National Indian Youth Council (NIYC) was especially supportive in King&#x27;s campaigns especially the Poor People&#x27;s Campaign in 1968. In King&#x27;s book &quot;Why We Can&#x27;t Wait&quot; he writes:

Our nation was born in genocide when it embraced the doctrine that the original American, the Indian, was an inferior race. Even before there were large numbers of Negroes on our shores, the scar of racial hatred had already disfigured colonial society. From the sixteenth century forward, blood flowed in battles over racial supremacy. We are perhaps the only nation which tried as a matter of national policy to wipe out its indigenous population. Moreover, we elevated that tragic experience into a noble crusade. Indeed, even today we have not permitted ourselves to reject or to feel remorse for this shameful episode. Our literature, our films, our drama, our folklore all exalt it.

In the late 1950&#x27;s, the remaining Creek in Alabama were trying to completely desegregate schools. Light-complexioned Native children were allowed to ride buses to previously all-white schools, while dark-skinned Native children from the same band were barred from the same buses. Tribal leaders, hearing of King&#x27;s desegregation campaign in Birmingham, contacted him for assistance. Through his intervention the problem was quickly resolved.

In September 1959, after giving a speech at the University of Arizona on the ideals of using nonviolent methods in creating social change, King stated his belief that one must not use force in this struggle &quot;but match the violence of his opponents with his suffering.&quot; King then went to Southside Presbyterian, a predominantly Native American church, and was fascinated by their photos; he wanted to go to an Indian Reservation to meet the people so Casper Glenn took King to the Papago Indian Reservation. He met with all the tribal leaders, visited another Presbyterian church near the reservation, and preached there, attracting a Native American crowd. He later returned to Old Pueblo in March 1962 where he preached again to a Native American congregation. King would continue to attract the attention of Native Americans throughout the civil rights movement. During the 1963 March on Washington there was a sizable Native American contingent, including many from South Dakota and from the Navajo nation.

King was a major inspiration, along with the civil rights movement, of the Native American rights movement of the 1960s and many of its leaders. John Echohawk, a member of the Pawnee tribe who was the executive director and a founder of the Native American Rights Fund, stated:

Inspired by Dr. King, who was advancing the civil rights agenda of equality under the laws of this country, we thought that we could also use the laws to advance our Indianship, to live as tribes in our territories governed by our own laws under the principles of tribal sovereignty that had been with us ever since 1831. We believed that we could fight for a policy of self-determination that was consistent with U.S. law and that we could govern our own affairs, define our own ways and continue to survive in this society.

=== Politics ===
As the leader of the SCLC, King maintained a policy of not publicly endorsing a U.S. political party or candidate: &quot;I feel someone must remain in the position of non-alignment, so that he can look objectively at both parties and be the conscience of both—not the servant or master of either.&quot; In a 1958 interview, he expressed his view that neither party was perfect, saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t think the Republican party is a party full of the almighty God nor is the Democratic party. They both have weaknesses ... And I&#x27;m not inextricably bound to either party.&quot; King did praise Democratic Senator Paul Douglas of Illinois as being the &quot;greatest of all senators&quot; because of his fierce advocacy for civil rights causes.

King critiqued both parties&#x27; performance on promoting racial equality:

Although King never publicly supported a political party or candidate for president, in a letter to a civil rights supporter in October 1956 he said that he had not decided whether he would vote for Democrat Adlai Stevenson II or Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower at the 1956 presidential election, but that &quot;In the past, I always voted the Democratic ticket.&quot; In his autobiography, King says that in 1960 he privately voted for Democratic candidate John F. Kennedy: &quot;I felt that Kennedy would make the best president. I never came out with an endorsement. My father did, but I never made one.&quot; King adds that he likely would have made an exception to his non-endorsement policy for a second Kennedy term, saying &quot;Had President Kennedy lived, I would probably have endorsed him in 1964.&quot;

In 1964, King urged his supporters &quot;and all people of goodwill&quot; to vote against Republican Senator Barry Goldwater for president, saying that his election &quot;would be a tragedy, and certainly suicidal almost, for the nation and the world.&quot; King believed Robert F. Kennedy would make for a good president, but also believed that he wouldn&#x27;t beat Johnson in the 1968 Democratic Party presidential primaries. He also expressed support for the possible presidential candidacies of Republicans Nelson Rockefeller, George Romney and Charles Percy.

King rejected both &quot;laissez-faire&quot; capitalism and communism; King had read Marx while at Morehouse but rejected communism because of its &quot;materialistic interpretation of history&quot; that denied religion, its &quot;ethical relativism&quot;, and its &quot;political totalitarianism&quot;. He stated that one focused too much on the individual while the other focused too much on the collective. 

In a 1952 letter to Coretta Scott, he said: &quot;I imagine you already know that I am much more socialistic in my economic theory than capitalistic ...&quot; In one speech, he stated that &quot;something is wrong with capitalism&quot; and said, &quot;There must be a better distribution of wealth, and maybe America must move toward a democratic socialism.&quot; King further said that &quot;capitalism has outlived its usefulness&quot; and &quot;failed to meet the needs of the masses&quot;.

King was critical of American culture saying &quot;when machines and computers, profit motives and property rights are considered more important than people, the giant triplets of racism, materialism and militarism are incapable of being conquered&quot; and that America must undergo a &quot;radical revolution of values&quot;. King considered that in America &quot;the problem is that we all to often have socialism for the rich and rugged free enterprise capitalism for the poor&quot;.

=== Compensation ===

King stated that black Americans, as well as other disadvantaged Americans, should be compensated for historical wrongs. In an interview conducted for &quot;Playboy&quot; in 1965, he said that granting black Americans only equality could not realistically close the economic gap between them and whites. King said that he did not seek a full restitution of wages lost to slavery, which he believed impossible, but proposed a government compensatory program of $50 billion over ten years to all disadvantaged groups.

He posited that &quot;the money spent would be more than amply justified by the benefits that would accrue to the nation through a spectacular decline in school dropouts, family breakups, crime rates, illegitimacy, swollen relief rolls, rioting and other social evils.&quot; He presented this idea as an application of the common law regarding settlement of unpaid labor but clarified that he felt that the money should not be spent exclusively on blacks. He stated, &quot;It should benefit the disadvantaged of &quot;all&quot; races.&quot;

=== Television ===
Actress Nichelle Nichols planned to leave the science-fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot; in 1967 after its first season. She changed her mind after talking to King, who was a fan of the show. King explained that her character signified a future of greater racial cooperation. King told Nichols, &quot;You are our image of where we&#x27;re going, you&#x27;re 300 years from now, and that means that&#x27;s where we are and it takes place now. Keep doing what you&#x27;re doing, you are our inspiration.&quot; As Nichols recounted: &quot;Star Trek&quot; was one of the only shows that [King] and his wife Coretta would allow their little children to watch. And I thanked him and I told him I was leaving the show. All the smile came off his face. And he said, &#x27;Don&#x27;t you understand for the first time we&#x27;re seen as we should be seen. You don&#x27;t have a black role. You have an equal role.&#x27; The series&#x27; creator, Gene Roddenberry, was deeply moved upon learning of King&#x27;s support.

== State surveillance and coercion ==

=== FBI surveillance and wiretapping ===
FBI director J. Edgar Hoover personally ordered surveillance of King, with the intent to undermine his power as a civil rights leader. The Church Committee, a 1975 investigation by the U.S. Congress, found that &quot;From December 1963 until his death in 1968, Martin Luther King Jr. was the target of an intensive campaign by the Federal Bureau of Investigation to &#x27;neutralize&#x27; him as an effective civil rights leader.&quot;

In the fall of 1963, the FBI received authorization from Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy to proceed with wiretapping of King&#x27;s phone lines, purportedly due to his association with Stanley Levison. The Bureau informed President John F. Kennedy. He and his brother unsuccessfully tried to persuade King to dissociate himself from Levison, a New York lawyer who had been involved with Communist Party USA. Although Robert Kennedy only gave written approval for limited wiretapping of King&#x27;s telephone lines &quot;on a trial basis, for a month or so&quot;, Hoover extended the clearance so his men were &quot;unshackled&quot; to look for evidence in any areas of King&#x27;s life they deemed worthy.

The Bureau placed wiretaps on the home and office phone lines of both Levison and King, and bugged King&#x27;s rooms in hotels as he traveled across the country. In 1967, Hoover listed the SCLC as a black nationalist hate group, with the instructions: &quot;No opportunity should be missed to exploit through counterintelligence techniques the organizational and personal conflicts of the leaderships of the groups ... to insure the targeted group is disrupted, ridiculed, or discredited.&quot;

=== Police surveillance ===
King was also the subject of extensive surveillance by local police agencies throughout the United States. At the March on Washington, where King declared, &quot;We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality&quot;, undercover police from both the Birmingham Police Department and the Philadelphia Police Department were on hand to monitor the day&#x27;s proceedings. Additional documented instances of local police that monitored King include the New York Police Department and the Chicago Police Department.

The Memphis Police Department also spied on King in the spring of 1968, as the civil rights leader was taking part in a campaign to support striking sanitation workers in the Tennessee city. A fire station was located across from the Lorraine Motel, next to the boarding house in which James Earl Ray was staying. Police officers were stationed in the fire station to keep King under surveillance. Agents were watching King at the time he was shot. Immediately following the shooting, officers rushed to the motel. Marrell McCollough, an undercover police officer, was the first person to administer first aid to King. The antagonism between King and the FBI, the lack of an all points bulletin to find the killer, and the police presence nearby led to speculation that the FBI was involved in the assassination.

=== NSA monitoring of King&#x27;s communications ===
In a secret operation code-named &quot;Minaret&quot;, the National Security Agency monitored the communications of leading Americans, including King, who were critical of the U.S. war in Vietnam. A review by the NSA itself concluded that Minaret was &quot;disreputable if not outright illegal&quot;.

=== Allegations of communism ===
For years, Hoover had been suspicious of potential influence of communists in social movements such as labor unions and civil rights. Hoover directed the FBI to track King in 1957, and the SCLC when it was established.

Due to the relationship between King and Stanley Levison, the FBI feared Levison was working as an &quot;agent of influence&quot; over King, in spite of its own reports in 1963 that Levison had left the Party and was no longer associated in business dealings with them. Another King lieutenant, Jack O&#x27;Dell, was also linked to the Communist Party by sworn testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC).

Despite the extensive surveillance, by 1976 the FBI had acknowledged that it had not obtained any evidence that King himself or the SCLC were actually involved with any communist organizations.

For his part, King adamantly denied having any connections to communism. In a 1965 &quot;Playboy&quot; interview, he stated that &quot;there are as many Communists in this freedom movement as there are Eskimos in Florida.&quot; He argued that Hoover was &quot;following the path of appeasement of political powers in the South&quot; and that his concern for communist infiltration of the civil rights movement was meant to &quot;aid and abet the salacious claims of southern racists and the extreme right-wing elements.&quot; Hoover replied by saying that King was &quot;the most notorious liar in the country&quot;. After his &quot;I Have A Dream&quot; speech, the FBI described King as &quot;the most dangerous and effective Negro leader in the country&quot;. It alleged that he was &quot;knowingly, willingly and regularly cooperating with and taking guidance from communists.&quot;

The attempts to prove that King was a communist was related to the feeling of many segregationists that blacks in the South were content with the status quo but had been stirred up by &quot;communists&quot; and &quot;outside agitators&quot;. King said that &quot;the Negro revolution is a genuine revolution, born from the same womb that produces all massive social upheavals—the womb of intolerable conditions and unendurable situations.&quot;

=== CIA surveillance ===
CIA files declassified in 2017 revealed that the agency was investigating possible links between King and Communism after a &quot;Washington Post&quot; article dated November 4, 1964, claimed he was invited to the Soviet Union and that Ralph Abernathy, as spokesman for King, refused to comment on the source of the invitation. Mail belonging to King and other civil rights activists was intercepted by the CIA program HTLINGUAL.

=== Allegations of adultery ===

The FBI attempted to discredit King through revelations regarding his private life. FBI surveillance of King, some of it since made public, attempted to demonstrate that he had numerous extramarital affairs. The FBI distributed reports regarding such affairs to the executive branch, friendly reporters, potential coalition partners and funding sources of the SCLC, and King&#x27;s family. The bureau also sent anonymous letters to King threatening to reveal information about his affairs. The FBI–King letter sent to King just before he received the Nobel Peace Prize read, in part:

The American public, the church organizations that have been helping—Protestants, Catholics and Jews will know you for what you are—an evil beast. So will others who have backed you. You are done. King, there is only one thing left for you to do. You know what it is. You have just 34 days in which to do (this exact number has been selected for a specific reason, it has definite practical significant ). You are done. There is but one way out for you. You better take it before your filthy fraudulent self is bared to the nation.

The letter was accompanied by a tape recording—excerpted from FBI wiretaps—of several of King&#x27;s extramarital liaisons. King interpreted this package as an attempt to drive him to suicide, although William Sullivan, head of the Domestic Intelligence Division at the time, argued that it may have only been intended to &quot;convince Dr. King to resign from the SCLC.&quot; Upon the release of the full letter in 2014, Yale history professor Beverly Gage noted in a &quot;New York Times&quot; article that the claim that the FBI &quot;simply meant to push King out, not induce suicide&quot; was a possibility, pointing out that &quot;Another uncovered portion of the note praises “older leaders” like the N.A.A.C.P. executive director Roy Wilkins, urging King to step aside and let other men lead the civil rights movement.&quot; King refused to succumb to the FBI&#x27;s threats.

In 1977, Judge John Lewis Smith Jr. ordered the recorded audiotapes and written transcripts resulting from the FBI&#x27;s electronic surveillance of King between 1963 and 1968 to be sealed from public access in the National Archives until 2027.
In May 2019, an FBI file emerged on which a handwritten note alleged that King &quot;looked on, laughed and offered advice&quot; as one of his friends raped a woman. Historians of the period who have examined this notional evidence have dismissed it as highly unreliable. David Garrow, author of an earlier biography of King, wrote that &quot;the suggestion ... that he either actively tolerated or personally employed violence against any woman, even while drunk, poses so fundamental a challenge to his historical stature as to require the most complete and extensive historical review possible&quot;. Garrow&#x27;s reliance on a handwritten note addended to a typed report is considered poor scholarship by several other authorities. The professor of American studies at the University of Nottingham, Peter Ling, pointed out that Garrow was excessively credulous, if not naive, in accepting the accuracy of FBI reports during a period when the FBI was undertaking a massive operation to attempt to discredit King. Experts in 20th-century American history, including Distinguished Professor of Political Science Jeanne Theoharis, the professors Barbara Ransby of the University of Illinois at Chicago, Nathan Connolly of Johns Hopkins University and Professor Emeritus of History Glenda Gilmore of Yale University have expressed reservations about Garrow&#x27;s scholarship. Theoharis commented &quot;Most scholars I know would penalize graduate students for doing this.&quot; It is not the first time the care and rigor of Garrow&#x27;s work has been called into serious question. Clayborne Carson, Martin Luther King biographer and overseer of the Dr. King records at Stanford University states that he came to the opposite conclusion of Garrow: None of this is new. Garrow is talking about a recently added summary of a transcript of a 1964 recording from the Willard Hotel that others, including Mrs. King, have said they did not hear Martin&#x27;s voice on it. The added summary was four layers removed from the actual recording. This supposedly new information comes from an anonymous source in a single paragraph in an FBI report. You have to ask how could anyone conclude King looked at a rape from an audio recording in a room where he was not present. The tapes that could confirm or refute the allegation are scheduled to be declassified in 2027.
In his 1989 autobiography &quot;And the Walls Came Tumbling Down&quot;, Ralph Abernathy stated that King had a &quot;weakness for women&quot;, although they &quot;all understood and believed in the biblical prohibition against sex outside of marriage. It was just that he had a particularly difficult time with that temptation.&quot; In a later interview, Abernathy said that he only wrote the term &quot;womanizing&quot;, that he did not specifically say King had extramarital sex and that the infidelities King had were emotional rather than sexual. Abernathy criticized the media for sensationalizing the statements he wrote about King&#x27;s affairs, such as the allegation that he admitted in his book that King had a sexual affair the night before he was assassinated.
In his 1986 book &quot;Bearing the Cross&quot;, David Garrow wrote about a number of extramarital affairs, including one woman King saw almost daily. According to Garrow, &quot;that relationship ... increasingly became the emotional centerpiece of King&#x27;s life, but it did not eliminate the incidental couplings ... of King&#x27;s travels.&quot; He alleged that King explained his extramarital affairs as &quot;a form of anxiety reduction&quot;. Garrow asserted that King&#x27;s supposed promiscuity caused him &quot;painful and at times overwhelming guilt&quot;. King&#x27;s wife Coretta appeared to have accepted his affairs with equanimity, saying once that &quot;all that other business just doesn&#x27;t have a place in the very high-level relationship we enjoyed.&quot; Shortly after &quot;Bearing the Cross&quot; was released, civil rights author Howell Raines gave the book a positive review but opined that Garrow&#x27;s allegations about King&#x27;s sex life were &quot;sensational&quot; and stated that Garrow was &quot;amassing facts rather than analyzing them&quot;.

== Awards and recognition ==

King was awarded at least fifty honorary degrees from colleges and universities. On October 14, 1964, King became the youngest winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, which was awarded to him for leading nonviolent resistance to racial prejudice in the U.S. In 1965, he was awarded the American Liberties Medallion by the American Jewish Committee for his &quot;exceptional advancement of the principles of human liberty.&quot; In his acceptance remarks, King said, &quot;Freedom is one thing. You have it all or you are not free.&quot;

In 1957, he was awarded the Spingarn Medal from the NAACP. Two years later, he won the Anisfield-Wolf Book Award for &quot;Stride Toward Freedom: The Montgomery Story&quot;. In 1966, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America awarded King the Margaret Sanger Award for &quot;his courageous resistance to bigotry and his lifelong dedication to the advancement of social justice and human dignity.&quot; Also in 1966, King was elected as a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In November 1967, he made a 24-hour trip to the UK to receive an honorary Doctorate in Civil Law from Newcastle University, becoming the first African American the institution had recognized in this way. In an impromptu acceptance speech, he said:
There are three urgent and indeed great problems that we face not only in the United States of America but all over the world today. That is the problem of racism, the problem of poverty and the problem of war.

In addition to his nominations for three Grammy Awards, King posthumously won for Best Spoken Word Recording in 1971 for &quot;Why I Oppose The War In Vietnam&quot;.

In 1977, President Jimmy Carter posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to King. The citation read:

Martin Luther King Jr. was the conscience of his generation. He gazed upon the great wall of segregation and saw that the power of love could bring it down. From the pain and exhaustion of his fight to fulfill the promises of our founding fathers for our humblest citizens, he wrung his eloquent statement of his dream for America. He made our nation stronger because he made it better. His dream sustains us yet.

King and his wife were also awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in 2004.

King was second in Gallup&#x27;s List of Most Widely Admired People of the 20th Century. In 1963, he was named &quot;Time&quot; Person of the Year, and, in 2000, he was voted sixth in an online &quot;Person of the Century&quot; poll by the same magazine. King placed third in &quot;The Greatest American&quot; conducted by the Discovery Channel and AOL.

=== Five-dollar bill ===
On April 20, 2016, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew announced that the $5, $10, and $20 bills would all undergo redesign prior to 2020. Lew said that while Lincoln would remain on the front of the $5 bill, the reverse would be redesigned to depict various historical events that had occurred at the Lincoln Memorial. Among the planned designs are images from King&#x27;s &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech.

=== Memorials ===

Many memorial sites, buildings and sculptures have been created to honor Martin Luther King Jr, including the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library in Washington, D.C., the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Library in San Jose, California, and the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial in West Potomac Park next to the National Mall in Washington, D.C.

<doc id="20080" wikidata="Q703980" url="?curid=20080" title="Marino Marini (sculptor)">
<text>Marino Marini (27 February 1901 – 6 August 1980) was an Italian sculptor and educator.

==Biography==
He attended the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence in 1917. Although he never abandoned painting, Marini devoted himself primarily to sculpture from about 1922. From this time his work was influenced by Etruscan art and the sculpture of Arturo Martini. Marini succeeded Martini as professor at the Scuola d’Arte di Villa Reale in Monza, near Milan, in 1929, a position he retained until 1940.

During this period, Marini traveled frequently to Paris, where he associated with Massimo Campigli, Giorgio de Chirico, Alberto Magnelli, and Filippo Tibertelli de Pisis. In 1936 he moved to Tenero-Locarno, in Ticino Canton, Switzerland; during the following few years the artist often visited Zürich and Basel, where he became a friend of Alberto Giacometti, Germaine Richier, and Fritz Wotruba. In 1936, he received the Prize of the Quadriennale of Rome. In 1938, he married Mercedes Pedrazzini.

In 1940, he accepted a professorship in sculpture at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Brera (now Brera Academy) in Milan. Notable students of his include sculptor Parviz Tanavoli. In 1943, he went into exile in Switzerland, exhibiting in Basel, Bern, and Zurich. In 1946, the artist settled permanently in Milan.

He is buried at Cimitero Comunale of Pistoia, Toscana, Italy.

==Career==
He participated in the &#x27;Twentieth-Century Italian Art&#x27; show at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City in 1944. Curt Valentin began exhibiting Marini&#x27;s work at his Buchholz Gallery in New York in 1950, on which occasion the sculptor visited the city and met Jean Arp, Max Beckmann, Alexander Calder, Lyonel Feininger, and Jacques Lipchitz. On his return to Europe, he stopped in London, where the Hanover Gallery had organized a solo show of his work, and there met Henry Moore. In 1951 a Marini exhibition traveled from the Kestner-Gesellschaft Hannover to the Kunstverein in Hamburg and the Haus der Kunst of Munich. He was awarded the Grand Prize for Sculpture at the Venice Biennale in 1952 and the Feltrinelli Prize at the Accademia dei Lincei in Rome in 1954. One of his monumental sculptures was installed in The Hague in 1959.

Retrospectives of Marini&#x27;s work took place at the Kunsthaus Zürich in 1962 and at the Palazzo Venezia in Rome in 1966. His paintings were exhibited for the first time at Toninelli Arte Moderna in Milan in 1963–64. In 1973 a permanent installation of his work opened at the Galleria d’Arte Moderna in Milan, and in 1978 a Marini show was presented at the National Museum of Modern Art in Tokyo.

There is a museum dedicated to his work in Florence in the former church of San Pancrazio.
His work may also be found in museums such as the Civic Gallery of Modern Art in Milan, the Tate Collection, &quot;The Angel of the City&quot; at the Peggy Guggenheim Collection, Venice, the Norton Simon Museum, Museum de Fundatie and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C.

==Work==

Marini developed several themes in sculpture: equestrian, Pomonas (nudes), portraits, and circus figures. He drew on traditions of Etruscan and Northern European sculpture in developing these themes. His aim was to develop mythical images by interpreting classical themes in light of modern concerns and techniques.

Marini is particularly famous for his series of stylised equestrian statues, which feature a man with outstretched arms on a horse. The evolution of the horse and rider as a subject in Marini&#x27;s works reflects the artist&#x27;s response to the changing context of the modern world. This theme appeared in his work in 1936. At first the proportions of horse and rider are slender and both are &quot;poised, formal, and calm.&quot; By the next year the horse is depicted rearing and the rider gesturing. By 1940 the forms are simpler and more archaic in spirit; the proportions squatter.

After World War II, in the late 1940s, the horse is planted, immobile, with neck extended, ears pinned back, mouth open. An example, in the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice, is &quot;The Angel of the City,&quot; depicting &quot;affirmation and charged strength associated explicitly with sexual potency.&quot; In later works, the rider is, increasingly, oblivious of his mount, &quot;involved in his own visions or anxieties.&quot; In the artist&#x27;s final work, the rider is unseated as the horse falls to the ground in an &quot;apocalyptic image of lost control&quot; which parallels Marini&#x27;s growing despair for the future of the world.

<doc id="20087" wikidata="Q319400" url="?curid=20087" title="Modular arithmetic">
<text>In mathematics, modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers &quot;wrap around&quot; when reaching a certain value, called the modulus. The modern approach to modular arithmetic was developed by Carl Friedrich Gauss in his book &quot;Disquisitiones Arithmeticae&quot;, published in 1801.

A familiar use of modular arithmetic is in the 12-hour clock, in which the day is divided into two 12-hour periods. If the time is 7:00 now, then 8 hours later it will be 3:00. Simple addition would result in , but 15:00 reads as 3:00 on the clock face because clocks &quot;wrap around&quot; every 12 hours and the hour number starts again at zero when it reaches 12. We say that 15 is &quot;congruent&quot; to 3 modulo 12, written 15 ≡ 3 (mod 12), so that 7 + 8 ≡ 3 (mod 12). Similarly, 8:00 represents a period of 8 hours, and twice this would give 16:00, which reads as 4:00 on the clock face, written as 2 × 8 ≡ 4 (mod 12).

== Congruence ==
Given an integer , called a modulus, two integers and are said to be congruent modulo , if is a divisor of their difference; that is, if there is an integer such that
Congruence modulo is a congruence relation, meaning that it is an equivalence relation that is compatible with the operations of addition, subtraction, and multiplication. Congruence modulo is denoted

The parentheses mean that applies to the entire equation, not just to the right-hand side (here, ). 

This notation is not to be confused with the notation (without parentheses), which refers to the modulo operation, the remainder of when divided by : that is, denotes the unique integer such that and .

The congruence relation may be rewritten as
explicitly showing its relationship with Euclidean division. However, the here need not be the remainder in the division of by Rather, asserts that and have the same remainder when divided by . That is,
: ,
where is the common remainder. We recover the previous relation () by subtracting these two expressions and setting 

Because the congruence modulo is defined by the divisibility by and because is a unit in the ring of integers, a number is divisible by exactly if it is divisible by .
This means that every non-zero integer may be taken as modulus.
=== Examples ===
In modulus 12, one can assert that:
because the difference is , a multiple of . Equivalently, and have the same remainder when divided by .

The definition of congruence also applies to negative values. For example:
: formula_1

== Basic properties ==

The congruence relation satisfies all the conditions of an equivalence relation:
* Reflexivity: 
* Symmetry: if .
* Transitivity: If and , then 

If and , or if , then:
* for any integer (compatibility with translation)
* for any integer (compatibility with scaling)
* for any integer 
* (compatibility with addition)
* (compatibility with subtraction)
* (compatibility with multiplication)
* for any non-negative integer (compatibility with exponentiation)
* , for any polynomial with integer coefficients (compatibility with polynomial evaluation)

If , then it is generally false that . However, the following is true:
* If where is Euler&#x27;s totient function, then —provided that is coprime with .

For cancellation of common terms, we have the following rules:
* If , where is any integer, then .
* If and is coprime with , then .
* If and , then .

The last rule can be used to move modular arithmetic into division. If divides , then .

The modular multiplicative inverse is defined by the following rules:
* Existence: There exists an integer denoted such that if and only if is coprime with . This integer is called a &quot;modular multiplicative inverse&quot; of modulo .
* If and exists, then (compatibility with multiplicative inverse, and, if , uniqueness modulo ).
* If and is coprime to , then the solution to this linear congruence is given by .

The multiplicative inverse may be efficiently computed by solving Bézout&#x27;s equation for , , by using the Extended Euclidean algorithm.

In particular, if is a prime number, then is coprime with for every such that ; thus a multiplicative inverse exists for all that is not congruent to zero modulo .

== Advanced properties ==
Some of the more advanced properties of congruence relations are the following:
* Fermat&#x27;s little theorem: If is prime and does not divide , then .
* Euler&#x27;s theorem: If and are coprime, then , where is Euler&#x27;s totient function.
* A simple consequence of Fermat&#x27;s little theorem is that if is prime, then is the multiplicative inverse of . More generally, from Euler&#x27;s theorem, if and are coprime, then . Hence, if , then .
* Another simple consequence is that if , where is Euler&#x27;s totient function, then provided is coprime with .
* Wilson&#x27;s theorem: is prime if and only if .
* Chinese remainder theorem: For any , and coprime , , there exists a unique such that and . In fact, where is the inverse of modulo and is the inverse of modulo .
* Lagrange&#x27;s theorem: If is prime and is a polynomial with integer coefficients such that is not a divisor of , then the congruence has at most non-congruent solutions.
* Primitive root modulo: A number is a primitive root modulo if, for every integer coprime to , there is an integer such that . A primitive root modulo exists if and only if is equal to or , where is an odd prime number and is a positive integer. If a primitive root modulo exists, then there are exactly such primitive roots, where is the Euler&#x27;s totient function.
* Quadratic residue: An integer is a quadratic residue modulo , if there exists an integer such that . Euler&#x27;s criterion asserts that, if is an odd prime, and is not a multiple of , then is a quadratic residue modulo if and only if

== Congruence classes ==
The congruence relation is an equivalence relation. The equivalence class modulo of an integer is the set of all integers of the form , where is any integer. It is called the congruence class or residue class of modulo , and may be denoted as , or as or when the modulus is known from the context.

Each residue class modulo  contains exactly one integer in the range formula_2. Thus, these formula_3 integers are representatives of their respective residue classes. 

It is generally easier to work with integers than sets of integers; that is, the representatives most often considered, rather than their residue classes. 

Consequently, denotes generally the unique integer such that and ; it is called the residue of modulo .

In particular, is equivalent to , and this explains why &quot; is often used instead of &quot; in this context.

== Residue systems ==
Each residue class modulo may be represented by any one of its members, although we usually represent each residue class by the smallest nonnegative integer which belongs to that class (since this is the proper remainder which results from division). Any two members of different residue classes modulo are incongruent modulo . Furthermore, every integer belongs to one and only one residue class modulo .

The set of integers is called the least residue system modulo . Any set of integers, no two of which are congruent modulo , is called a complete residue system modulo .

The least residue system is a complete residue system, and a complete residue system is simply a set containing precisely one representative of each residue class modulo . For example, the least residue system modulo is . Some other complete residue systems modulo include:
* 
* 
* 

Some sets that are &quot;not&quot; complete residue systems modulo 4 are:
* , since is congruent to modulo .
* , since a complete residue system modulo must have exactly incongruent residue classes.

=== Reduced residue systems ===

Given the Euler&#x27;s totient function , any set of integers that are relatively prime to and mutually incongruent under modulus is called a reduced residue system modulo . The set from above, for example, is an instance of a reduced residue system modulo 4.

=== Covering systems ===

Covering systems represent yet another type of residue system that may contain residues with varying moduli.

== Integers modulo &quot;m&quot; ==
Remark: In the context of this paragraph, the modulus is almost always taken as positive.

The set of all congruence classes modulo is called the ring of integers modulo , and is denoted formula_4, formula_5, or formula_6. The notation formula_6 is, however, not recommended because it can be confused with the set of -adic integers. The ring formula_8 is fundamental to various branches of mathematics (see &quot;&quot; below).

For one has
: formula_9

When , formula_8 is the zero ring; when , formula_8 is not an empty set; rather, it is isomorphic to formula_12, since .

Addition, subtraction, and multiplication are defined on formula_8 by the following rules:
* formula_14
* formula_15
* formula_16

The properties given before imply that, with these operations, formula_8 is a commutative ring. For example, in the ring formula_18, one has
: formula_19
as in the arithmetic for the 24-hour clock.

The notation formula_8 is used because this ring is the quotient ring of formula_12 by the ideal formula_22, the set formed by all with formula_23

Considered as a group under addition, formula_24 is a cyclic group, and all cyclic groups are isomorphic with formula_25 for some .

The ring of integers modulo is a field if and only if is prime (this ensures that every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse). If is a prime power with , there exists a unique (up to isomorphism) finite field formula_26 with elements, which is &quot;not&quot; isomorphic to formula_25, which fails to be a field because it has zero-divisors.

If , formula_28 denotes the multiplicative group of the integers modulo that are invertible. It consists of the congruence classes , where is coprime to ; these are precisely the classes possessing a multiplicative inverse. They form an abelian group under multiplication; its order is , where is Euler&#x27;s totient function

== Applications ==
In pure mathematics, modular arithmetic is one of the foundations of number theory, touching on almost every aspect of its study, and it is also used extensively in group theory, ring theory, knot theory, and abstract algebra. In applied mathematics, it is used in computer algebra, cryptography, computer science, chemistry and the visual and musical arts.

A very practical application is to calculate checksums within serial number identifiers. For example, International Standard Book Number (ISBN) uses modulo 11 (for 10-digit ISBN) or modulo 10 (for 13-digit ISBN) arithmetic for error detection. Likewise, International Bank Account Numbers (IBANs), for example, make use of modulo 97 arithmetic to spot user input errors in bank account numbers. In chemistry, the last digit of the CAS registry number (a unique identifying number for each chemical compound) is a check digit, which is calculated by taking the last digit of the first two parts of the CAS registry number times 1, the previous digit times 2, the previous digit times 3 etc., adding all these up and computing the sum modulo 10.

In cryptography, modular arithmetic directly underpins public key systems such as RSA and Diffie–Hellman, and provides finite fields which underlie elliptic curves, and is used in a variety of symmetric key algorithms including Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA), and RC4. RSA and Diffie–Hellman use modular exponentiation.

In computer algebra, modular arithmetic is commonly used to limit the size of integer coefficients in intermediate calculations and data. It is used in polynomial factorization, a problem for which all known efficient algorithms use modular arithmetic. It is used by the most efficient implementations of polynomial greatest common divisor, exact linear algebra and Gröbner basis algorithms over the integers and the rational numbers. As posted on Fidonet in the 1980s and archived at Rosetta Code, modular arithmetic was used to disprove Euler&#x27;s sum of powers conjecture on a Sinclair QL microcomputer using just one-fourth of the integer precision used by a CDC 6600 supercomputer to disprove it two decades earlier via a brute force search.

In computer science, modular arithmetic is often applied in bitwise operations and other operations involving fixed-width, cyclic data structures. The modulo operation, as implemented in many programming languages and calculators, is an application of modular arithmetic that is often used in this context. The logical operator XOR sums 2 bits, modulo 2.

The use of long division to turn a fraction into a repeating decimal in any base b is equivalent to modular multiplication of b modulo the denominator. For example, for decimal, b = 10.

In music, arithmetic modulo 12 is used in the consideration of the system of twelve-tone equal temperament, where octave and enharmonic equivalency occurs (that is, pitches in a 1:2 or 2:1 ratio are equivalent, and C-sharp is considered the same as D-flat).

The method of casting out nines offers a quick check of decimal arithmetic computations performed by hand. It is based on modular arithmetic modulo 9, and specifically on the crucial property that 10 ≡ 1 (mod 9).

Arithmetic modulo 7 is used in algorithms that determine the day of the week for a given date. In particular, Zeller&#x27;s congruence and the Doomsday algorithm make heavy use of modulo-7 arithmetic.

More generally, modular arithmetic also has application in disciplines such as law (e.g., apportionment), economics (e.g., game theory) and other areas of the social sciences, where proportional division and allocation of resources plays a central part of the analysis.

== Computational complexity ==
Since modular arithmetic has such a wide range of applications, it is important to know how hard it is to solve a system of congruences. A linear system of congruences can be solved in polynomial time with a form of Gaussian elimination, for details see linear congruence theorem. Algorithms, such as Montgomery reduction, also exist to allow simple arithmetic operations, such as multiplication and exponentiation modulo, to be performed efficiently on large numbers.

Some operations, like finding a discrete logarithm or a quadratic congruence appear to be as hard as integer factorization and thus are a starting point for cryptographic algorithms and encryption. These problems might be NP-intermediate.

Solving a system of non-linear modular arithmetic equations is NP-complete.

<doc id="20088" wikidata="Q8689" url="?curid=20088" title="Myriad">
<text>In the context of numeric naming systems for powers of ten, myriad is the quantity ten thousand (10,000). Idiosyncratically, in English, myriad describes a group of things as having indefinitely large quantity.

&quot;Myriad&quot; derives from the ancient Greek for ten thousand () and is used with this meaning in literal translations from Greek, Latin or Sinospheric languages (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese), and in reference to ancient Greek numerals.

==History==
The Aegean numerals of the Minoan and Mycenaean civilizations included a symbol composed of a circle with four dashes 𐄫 to denote tens of thousands.

In classical Greek numerals, myriad was written as a capital mu: Μ. To distinguish this numeral from letters, it was sometimes given an overbar: . Multiples were written above this sign. For example is 4,582×10,000 or 45,820,000. 

The etymology of &quot;myriad&quot; is uncertain. It has been variously connected to PIE &quot;*meu-&quot; (&quot;damp&quot;) in reference to the waves of the sea and to Greek &quot;myrmex&quot; (, &quot;ant&quot;) in reference to their swarms.

In his &quot;Sand Reckoner&quot;, Archimedes used &quot;myriad myriad&quot; (, one hundred million) as the basis for a numeration system of large powers of ten, which he used to count grains of sand.

==In English==

&quot;Myriad&quot; may be used either as an adjective (there are myriad people outside) or as a noun (there is a myriad of people outside), but there are small differences. The former might imply that it is a diverse group of people whereas the latter usually does not.

Despite its usually meaning (a large, unspecified quantity), &quot;myriad&quot; is sometimes used in English to mean ten thousand although usually restricted to translation from other languages like ancient Greek and Chinese where quantities are grouped by 10,000. Such use permits the translator to remain closer to the original text and avoid unwieldy mentions of &quot;tens of thousands&quot;. For example, &quot;the original number of the crews supplied by the several nations I find to have been twenty-four myriads&quot; and &quot;What is the distance between one bridge and another? Twelve myriads of parasangs&quot;.

==In European languages==
Most European languages include a variation of &quot;myriad&quot; with a similar meaning to the English word.

Additionally, the prefix &quot;myria-&quot; indicating multiplication times ten thousand (×104), was part of the original metric system adopted by France in 1795. Although it was not retained after the 11th CGPM conference in 1960, &quot;myriameter&quot; is sometimes still encountered as a translation of the Scandinavian mile (Swedish &amp; Norwegian: &quot;mil&quot;) of , or in some classifications of wavelengths as the adjective &quot;myriametric&quot;. The &quot;myriagramme&quot; (10 kg) was a French approximation of the avoirdupois &quot;quartier&quot; of and the &quot;myriaton&quot; appears in Isaac Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Foundation&quot; novel trilogy.

In modern Greek, the word &quot;myriad&quot; is rarely used to denote 10,000, but a million is &quot;ekatommyrio&quot; (, &quot;lit.&quot; &#x27;hundred myriad&#x27;) and a thousand million is &quot;disekatommyrio&quot; (, &quot;lit.&quot; &#x27;twice hundred myriad&#x27;).

==In East Asian languages==

In East Asia, the traditional numeral systems of China, Korea, and Japan are all decimal-based but grouped into ten thousands rather than thousands. The character for myriad is in traditional script and in simplified form in both mainland China and Japanese; its pronunciation varies between languages (Mandarin: &quot;wàn&quot;, Hakka: &quot;wan&quot;5, Minnan: &quot;bān&quot;, Cantonese: &quot;maan&quot;6, Japanese and Korean: &quot;man&quot;, Vietnamese: &quot;vạn&quot;, Thai: หมื่น &quot;muen&quot; and Khmer: ម៉ឺន &quot;meun&quot;).

Because of this grouping into fours, higher orders of numbers are provided by the powers of 10,000 rather than 1,000: In China, 10,0002 was in ancient texts but is now called and sometimes written as 1,0000,0000; 10,0003 is 1,0000,0000,0000 or ; 10,0004 is 1,0000,0000,0000,0000 or ; and so on. Conversely, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean generally do not have native words for powers of one thousand: what is called &quot;one million&quot; in English is &quot;100&quot; (100 myriad) in the Sinosphere, and &quot;one billion&quot; in English is &quot; (ten myllion) or &quot; (ten myriad myriad) in the Sinosphere. Unusually, Vietnam employs its former translation of , &quot;một triệu&quot;, to mean 1,000,000 rather than the Chinese figure. Similarly, the Chinese government has adapted the word to mean the scientific prefix mega-, but transliterations are used instead for giga-, tera-, and other larger prefixes. This has caused confusion in areas closely related to China such as Hong Kong and Macau, where is still largely used to mean 10,0003.

 and are also frequently employed colloquially in expressions, clichés, and &quot;chengyu&quot; (idioms) in the senses of &quot;vast&quot;, &quot;numerous&quot;, &quot;numberless&quot;, and &quot;infinite&quot;. A skeleton key is a (&quot;myriad-use key&quot;), the emperor was the &quot;lord of myriad chariots&quot; (), the Great Wall is called (&quot;Myriad-mile Long Wall&quot;), Zhu Xi&#x27;s statement (&quot;the moon reflects in myriad rivers&quot;) had the sense of supporting greater empiricism in Chinese philosophy, and Ha Qiongwen&#x27;s popular 1959 propaganda poster , meaning &quot;Long live Chairman Mao&quot;, literally reads as &quot;[May] Chairman Mao [live to be] 10,000 years old&quot;.

==In old Turkic==

A similar term is the Old Turkic word &quot;tümän&quot;, whose variant forms remain in use for &quot;ten thousand&quot; among modern Mongolian, Turkish. According to Sir Gerard Clauson (1891–1974), it was likely borrowed from Tokharian &quot;tmān&quot;, which may have been borrowed in turn from Old Chinese &quot;tman&quot; 萬 &gt; &quot;wan&quot;.

==In Hebrew==

In Hebrew the word רבבה (pronounced &quot;revava&quot;) means 10,000, and is the highest number represented in Hebrew. Its sources go back to biblical times. Its usage became very rare after the 19th century. The term 60 ריבוא (&quot;60 ribo&quot;), which literally stands for 600,000 is used several times in the bible to denote &quot;a very large undefinitive number&quot;.

Fayed was married to Samira Khashoggi from 1954 to 1956. They had a son, Dodi, who was in a romantic relationship with Diana, Princess of Wales, when they both died in a car crash in Paris in 1997. Fayed falsely claimed that the crash was orchestrated by MI6 on the instructions of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. In 2011, Fayed financially supported an unreleased documentary film &quot;Unlawful Killing&quot;, that presented his version of events.

From 1995 onwards, Fayed was the subject of media scrutiny and investigations into allegations of sexist and discriminatory practices he mandated at Harrods, of sexual harassment and assault. Early media scrutiny of sexual misconduct allegations against Al-Fayed was curtailed by his frequent threats of litigation. He developed a reputation for spending large sums on litigation against news organizations reporting on sexual assault allegations against him. In 2024 he became the subject of multiple posthumous accusations of rape, with over 200 women making complaints of illegal activity by September of that year.

==Early life==
Fayed was born on 27 January 1929 in the Roshdy neighbourhood of Alexandria, in the Kingdom of Egypt, the eldest son of an Egyptian primary school teacher from Asyut. His year of birth has been disputed. The Department of Trade in 1988 found his date of birth was 27 January 1929. His brothers Ali and Salah were his business colleagues.

At the age of nineteen Al-Fayed was selling bottles of Coca-Cola on the streets of Alexandria, and sold Singer sewing machines at the age of twenty-one. In 1952 Al-Fayed was hired by a friend, Tousson El Barrawi, and the seventeen-year-old Adnan Khashoggi for their furniture import business. Al-Fayed excelled at the business and impressed Adnan&#x27;s father, Mohamed Kashoggi, the personal physician of the King of Saudi Arabia. In the early 1950s Al-Fayed travelled to Europe for the first time, visiting France, Italy and Switzerland. Returning to Egypt, Al-Fayed confessed to his wife, Samira Kashoggi, Adnan Kashoggi&#x27;s sister, that he had had an affair, and she demanded a divorce. Al-Fayed terminated his partnership with Adnan Kashoggi, and secretly withdrew £100,000 from Kashoggi&#x27;s Al Nasr trading company. Kashoggi issued a writ against Al-Fayed for the return of the money, and later agreed with Al-Fayed to forgive the money and other loans and debts in return for Samira&#x27;s freedom to remarry and return to Egypt. Following Egyptian President Nassar&#x27;s threats to expropropriate foreign businesses, Al-Fayed was able to take control of a small shipping company, owned by Leon Carasso, who wished to emigrate. Carasso later claimed that Al-Fayed had defaulted on the agreed payment for his business. Fayed also acquired interests in other transport companies at favourable prices. After Nasser ordered the confiscation of Egyptian property in 1961, Al-Fayed transferred ownership of his Middle Eastern Navigation Company to Genoa in Italy.

On 12 June 1964, Al-Fayed arrived in Haiti, then under the control of François &quot;Papa Doc&quot; Duvalier. Al-Fayed entered the country on a Kuwaiti passport, and introduced himself as Sheikh Mohamed Fayed. Shortly after his arrival, Duvalier cancelled a ten-year contract with a U.S. company that gave them monopoly control over Haiti&#x27;s oil industry and signed a similar contract with Al-Fayed for fifty years. Al-Fayed also worked with the geologist George de Mohrenschildt. He terminated his stay in Haiti six months later when a sample of &quot;crude oil&quot; provided by Haitian associates proved to be low-grade molasses. Al-Fayed promised to use his connections in Dubai to help bring investment to the Caribbean island, if they allowed him to build an oil refinery, and develop the wharf at Port-au-Prince. Al-Fayed had exclusive control over the collection of fees for docking, unloading, and loading at Haiti&#x27;s main port, and this caused resentment in the Haitian shipping industry. Al-Fayed was &#x27;tapped&#x27; for $30,000 by Duvalier, but rather than pay, and fearful of the growing anger of the shipping agents, he left Haiti in December 1964. Fayed later claimed that the Haitian government owed him $2 million. The 1988 Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) report on Al-Fayed&#x27;s background stated &quot;we have no doubt at all that Mohamed Fayed perpetrated a substantial deceit on the government and people of Haiti in 1964 ... he deprived the harbor authority of over US $100,000 of money it could ill-afford to lose&quot; 

Fayed then moved to England, where he lived in central London.

== Career in Dubai ==
Ingratiating himself in London&#x27;s Arab expatriate community, Al-Fayed met an Iraqi businessman, Salim Abu Alwan, and through Alwan was introduced to Mahdi Al Tajir. Tajir was then an adviser to Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum of the United Arab Emirates. Rashid was the Emir of Dubai, and oil was soon to be discovered in Dubai, which would transform the wealth of the emirate.

Tajir informed Al-Fayed that Dubai was penniless and needed to borrow £1 million to build modern harbour facilities. Al-Fayed secured a loan of £9 million from Imre Rochlitz, an American lawyer. Rochlitz&#x27;s Jewish ancestry caused embarrassment to Tajir, and later caused Rochlitz to reject Al-Fayed&#x27;s offer of a formal partnership. Al-Fayed earned £1.5 million commission from the contract for British engineering company Costain to carry out the work to the port. Al-Fayed also assisted in securing finance for the Dubai World Trade Centre. The banker David Douglas-Home of Morgan Grenfell was responsible for managing the contract. By the mid-1970s Costain had gained over £280 million of contracts thanks to Al-Fayed and Tajir, and Al-Fayed bought 20.84% of Costain&#x27;s shares. He was later appointed a company director.

With his earnings from commissions on various projects in Dubai, Al-Fayed bought a Rolls-Royce, a large chalet in Gstaad, and the remaining apartments of 60 Park Lane in Mayfair, where he had been living for the past few years.

In 1974 Al-Fayed met Roland &#x27;Tiny&#x27; Rowland, a British businessman with extensive interests in Southern Africa, and the chairman of international conglomerate Lonrho. Fayed&#x27;s complex professional relationship with Rowland dominated his life for the next twenty years, with legal repercussions continuing into the late 1990s.

Rowland persuaded Al-Fayed to exchange his shares in Costain for 5.5 million shares in Lonrho in March 1975, and Al-Fayed used the profit from the deal to buy another 3 million shares in Lonrho and become a director of the company. Al-Fayed soon became alarmed at Rowland&#x27;s use of Lonrho&#x27;s money to fund his lifestyle and to pay large bribes in Africa, as well as his syphoning off company profits into a secret bank account in Switzerland.

The British Department of Trade and Industry began to investigate Lonrho in early 1976, and an alarmed Al-Fayed quit the company in May 1976. He sold his Lonrho shares to Kuwaiti investors and bought back his Costain shares for £11 million. Tajir&#x27;s influence in Dubai was waning by 1977, and Al-Fayed was excluded from the commission process for a new aluminium smelter, and the development of Jebel Ali, putting Costain&#x27;s future profits at risk.

In 1993 Al-Fayed was visited at Harrods by Mohammed Alabbar, the director of Dubai&#x27;s Department of Economic Development. Alabbar had been appointed by Sheikh Maktoum to eradicate the system of large commission payments from previous decades. Tajir was challenged in the British courts to repay his alleged excessive profits earned from the construction of Dubai&#x27;s aluminium smelter, and Al-Fayed was targeted over his management contract of the Dubai World Trade Centre. Al-Fayed&#x27;s contract to manage the centre was later terminated by the Maktoums, and Al-Fayed sued them for compensation estimated between £30 to 90 million. The case came to court in October 1994, and after trying to unsuccessfully settle the case with the Maktoums, Al-Fayed was due to testify on 17 October. Al-Fayed&#x27;s lawyer informed the court that morning that he had been taken seriously ill with neck and back complications, and could not fly to Dubai as a result.

Alabbar had secretly taped Al-Fayed on his way to Harrods that morning, and the tapes were shown to the court the next day. Al-Fayed&#x27;s lack of ill health was evident, and Al-Fayed was informed by his lawyer of the disastrous effect that his deception had on the case that day.

In the mid-1960s, he met the ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Rashid Bin Saeed Al Maktoum, who entrusted him with helping transform Dubai, where he set up IMS (International Marine Services) in 1968. Fayed introduced British companies including the Costain Group (of which he became a director and 30% shareholder), Bernard Sunley &amp; Sons, and Taylor Woodrow to the emirate to carry out construction work.

===Relationship with the Sultan of Brunei===

Al-Fayed became a financial adviser to the then Sultan of Brunei Omar Ali Saifuddien III in 1966. Al-Fayed told Maureen Orth that he had known Hassanal Bolkiah, who succeeded Saifuddien on his abdication, since the sultan&#x27;s childhood and that they had met during the building of a trade centre in Brunei. Tiny Rowland told DTI inspectors that Al-Fayed had told him that he negotiated an introduction to the sultan for $500,000 plus a percentage of any resulting business with an Indian holy man and alleged fraudster, Shri Chandra Swamiji Maharaj. Rowland later admitted this account was untrue.

In mid-1984 Al-Fayed received several powers of attorney and written authorisations from the sultan to carry out tasks for him. These gave Al-Fayed access to large sums of the sultan&#x27;s money. The sultan was then the richest man in the world. During this period, the bank of the three Fayed brothers, the Royal Bank of Scotland, received a transfer of hundreds of millions of dollars from Switzerland into their accounts. RBS assumed that the money belonged to the sultan, but Al-Fayed told the bank that his portfolio was separate from the sultan&#x27;s. The DTI report noted that &quot;It may be no more than coincidence that this vast increase in disposable wealth followed quickly on the admission of Mohamed to the sultan&#x27;s confidence ... It is, however, a very powerful coincidence.&quot;

Using a power of attorney, Al-Fayed bought the Dorchester Hotel for the sultan in 1985. Al-Fayed accompanied the sultan to 10 Downing Street to visit Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in January 1985, with sterling in decline and threatening the economy. The sultan, who had moved £5 billion of assets out of pounds, moved the assets back into sterling. Al-Fayed took credit for this and for persuading the sultan to give half a billion pounds of contracts to British defence industries.

==Rowland and later business career==
Fayed briefly joined the board of the mining conglomerate Lonrho in 1975 but left after a disagreement. In 1979 he bought the Ritz hotel in Paris, France, for US$30 million. In 1984 Fayed and his brothers purchased a 30% stake in House of Fraser, a group that included the London store of Harrods, from Tiny Rowland. In 1985, he and his brothers bought the remaining 70% of House of Fraser for £615 million. Rowland claimed that the Fayed brothers lied about their background and wealth, and he put pressure on the government to investigate them. A DTI inquiry into the Fayeds was launched. The DTI&#x27;s subsequent report was critical, but no action was taken against the Fayeds, and while many believed the contents of the report, others felt it was politically motivated. Rowland described his relationship with the Fayed family in his book &quot;A Hero from Zero&quot;. 
In 1998 Rowland, who died that year, accused Fayed of stealing papers and jewels from his Harrods safe deposit box. Fayed was arrested, along with the director of Harrods security, John MacNamara, and four other employees, but the charges were dropped. Sensitive documents were stolen, along with jewellery, rare stamps and a gold cigarette case, among other items. Fayed settled the dispute with a payment to Rowland&#x27;s widow; he also sued the Metropolitan Police for false arrest in 2002, but lost the case. In 1994 House of Fraser went public, but Fayed retained ownership of Harrods. He unsuccessfully applied for British citizenship twice, in 1994 and 1999. It has been suggested that his feud with Rowland contributed to the first refusal.

In 1996 Al-Fayed bought the rights to the historic British humorous magazine &quot;Punch&quot;, and it was relaunched later that year, at a cost of £3 million, under new editor Peter McKay. &quot;Punch&quot; had previously been published from 1841 to 1992. The relaunch was not successful, with &quot;Punch&quot; failing to match its satirical competitor, &quot;Private Eye&quot;. &quot;Punch&quot; folded for a second time in 2002.

In January 1997 Al-Fayed established a new political organisation, The People&#x27;s Trust, to promote a crusade against a &quot;culture of violence&quot;. The establishment of The People&#x27;s Trust followed Al-Fayed&#x27;s support for anti-abortion candidates and the Christian Democrat, the newspaper of the Movement for Christian Democracy. The People&#x27;s Trust planned to write to all candidates in the 1997 United Kingdom general election in order to identify a group of MPs who put &quot;their consciences, their constituents and their country at the heart of their politics, rather than their party&quot; The People&#x27;s Trust was dissolved in September 1998 after failing to file its accounts.

After &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; published Maureen Orth&#x27;s article &quot;Holy War at Harrods&quot;, Al-Fayed sued the American magazine for libel in September 1995 but withdrew his suit in 1997. Al-Fayed invited Tom Bower to write his biography in 1996. Bower&#x27;s biography, &quot;&quot; was published in 1998. Al-Fayed announced his intention to sue, but withdrew his suit. Orth and Bower were both attempted victims of entrapment by Al-Fayed, with Al-Fayed&#x27;s staff offering allegedly stolen documents to the writers.

===Cash-for-questions===
In 1994, in what became known as the cash-for-questions affair, Fayed revealed the names of MPs he had paid to ask questions in Parliament on his behalf, but who had failed to declare their fees. It saw Conservative MPs Neil Hamilton and Tim Smith leave the government in disgrace, and a Committee on Standards in Public Life established to prevent such corruption occurring again. Fayed also revealed that cabinet minister Jonathan Aitken stayed for free at the Ritz Hotel in Paris at the same time as a group of Saudi arms dealers, leading to Aitken&#x27;s unsuccessful libel case and later imprisonment for perjury. During this period, Al-Fayed&#x27;s spokesman was Michael Cole, a former BBC journalist.

Hamilton lost a libel action against Al-Fayed in December 1999 and an appeal against the verdict in December 2000. The former MP has always denied that he was paid by Al-Fayed for asking questions in Parliament. Hamilton&#x27;s libel action related to a Channel 4 &quot;Dispatches&quot; documentary broadcast on 16 January 1997 in which Al-Fayed stated that the MP had received up to £110,000 in cash and other gratuities for asking parliamentary questions. Hamilton&#x27;s basis for his appeal was that the original verdict was invalid because Al-Fayed had paid £10,000 for documents stolen from the dustbins of Hamilton&#x27;s legal representatives by Benjamin Pell.

In 2003 Fayed moved from Surrey to Switzerland, alleging a breach in an agreement with the British tax authority. In 2005, he moved back to Britain, saying that he &quot;regards Britain as home&quot;. He moored a yacht called the &quot;Sokar&quot; in Monaco prior to selling it in 2014.

===House of Fraser group and Harrods===
In 1984, Al-Fayed and his brother Ali, purchased a 30 per cent stake for £138 million in the House of Fraser, a group that included the Knightsbridge department store Harrods, from Tiny Rowland, the head of Lonrho. Lonrho had been pursuing control of the House of Fraser since 1977, and had been prevented from acquiring the company by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission in a 1981 ruling, although its purchase of &quot;The Observer&quot; was approved.

After his purchase of the House of Fraser shares, Al-Fayed demanded that Rowland leave the board of House of Fraser, and courted the chairman of House of Fraser, Roland Smith, who received a retroactive bonus once Al-Fayed had acquired the company. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, John Biffen, ruled that Lonrho must give an undertaking not to buy any more shares in the House of Fraser, a ruling that left Roland &quot;incandescent&quot;. Following the ruling Rowland began to sell shares to Al-Fayed, whom he had met while Al-Fayed was briefly a director of Lonrho. Rowland later said that &quot;I knew that Tootsie (as Rowland called Al-Fayed) could never afford to purchase the whole of House of Fraser.&quot;

Al-Fayed bought the remaining 70 per cent of the House of Fraser in early 1985 for £615 million, sparking a bitter feud between him and Rowland. The former editor of &quot;The Observer&quot;, Donald Trelford, believes that Rowland was &quot;...certainly motivated in his vendetta against Al-Fayed by outrage at having been conned. But he was also convinced that his shareholders had been cheated.&quot; Rowland felt his shareholders had been cheated as he believed Al-Fayed had used a power of attorney that he held for the Sultan of Brunei, then the richest man in the world, to fund the purchase. Rowland&#x27;s bitterness also came from his belief that Al-Fayed had lied to the British government about the sources of his wealth, and that the government had failed to investigate Al-Fayed&#x27;s credentials and had approved the sale without a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (while Lonrho had faced three inquiries under the commission), and that the new trade secretary, Norman Tebbit, had prevented Lonrho from bidding while Al-Fayed&#x27;s deal went through.

===Origins of wealth===
To take control of the House of Fraser group, the Al-Fayed brothers had to convince the British government that they possessed sufficient assets to securely purchase the group. The Al-Fayeds invented a spurious family history of old money for themselves. Represented by the investment bankers Kleinwort Benson and the law firm Herbert Smith, the Al-Fayeds&#x27; bankers submitted to the government a one and a half page summary of their assets, which the government accepted. The Al-Fayed brothers claimed they were from a family of wealthy cotton traders. Their wealth was estimated by their bankers, Kleinwort Benson, to total &quot;several billion dollars&quot;. A press release by Kleinwort Benson stated that the Al-Fayeds were an &quot;old established Egyptian family who for more than 100 years were ship owners, land owners and industrialists in Egypt.&quot; The report said that they were raised in Britain and fled Egypt following the rise to power of Gamal Abdel Nasser.

The DTI report came to very different conclusions about the scale of their wealth, stating that; If people had known, for instance, that they only owned one luxury hotel; that their interests in oil exploration consortia were of no current value; that their banking interests consisted of less than 5 percent of the issued share capital of a bank and were worth less than $10 million; that they had no current interests in construction projects: that far from being &#x27;leading shipowners in the liner trade&#x27; they only owned two roll-on roll-off 1600 ton cargo ferries; if all these facts had been known people would have been less disposed to believe that the Al-Fayeds really owned the money they were using to buy HOF (House of Fraser)
&quot;1988 DTI report into the background of the Fayed brothers&quot;

In March 1985 the Al-Fayeds announced a formal cash offer for House of Fraser of £615 million, which Kleinwort claimed was untethered by any borrowings. There has not yet been a comprehensive account of Al-Fayeds finances in 1985, but the DTI report claimed that by October 1984 the Al-Fayeds had at least $600 million in the Royal Bank of Scotland and in a Swiss bank at their disposal. &quot;We were not told the source of any of these funds or given a credible story as to how and where they were obtained&quot;, said the DTI inspectors. The money the Al-Fayeds claimed as their own was apparently used as collateral in order to guarantee a loan of more than £400 million to buy House of Fraser.

Al-Fayed told Maureen Orth in an interview that &quot;If you have a company with tremendous assets like Harrods...you have no problem. You don&#x27;t need to use cash.&quot; The first loan, from a Swiss bank, was replaced with another loan secured by House of Fraser shares, the Al-Fayeds had acquired the House of Fraser with none of their own money used to purchase it. The Al-Fayeds ownership of Harrods was complete when the British government issued a press release announcing that it would not refer the Al-Fayeds&#x27; bid to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.

During the final stages of the Al-Fayeds purchase of Harrods, Tiny Rowland wrote to the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, Norman Tebbit, repudiating the Al-Fayeds story of the origin of their families wealth. Rowland also enlisted the help of Ashraf Marwan, to aid him in his exposing of the Al-Fayeds. &quot;The Observer&quot; newspaper, owned by Rowland, was used to attack the Al-Fayeds. Al-Fayed issued a libel suit against &quot;The Observer&quot;, and other newspapers critical of the Al-Fayeds were routinely threatened or issued with similar writs. All critical reporting of the Al-Fayeds outside of the &quot;Observer&quot; was virtually stopped.

===1988 DTI Report===
From 1985 until 1987 Rowland led a worldwide investigation into Al-Fayed and his acquisition of Harrods. He employed accountants and solicitors, private detectives and freelance journalists in an operation, said to cost many millions of pounds, that was beyond the scope of any newspaper inquiry. Illicit bugging devices were used and some of the money went in bribes to officials to unearth incriminating documents in Egypt, Haiti, Dubai, Brunei, France and Switzerland, allegedly proving fraudulent dealings by Al-Fayed and showing his humble origins and limited net worth.

The results of Rowland&#x27;s investigations into the Al-Fayeds were given to the Sunday newspaper &quot;The Observer&quot;, owned by Lonrho. &quot;The Observer&quot; campaigned for an inquiry into the House of Fraser purchase, and an inquiry by inspectors from the Department of Trade and Industry was delivered in July 1988, but the DTI declined to publish it. Rowland obtained a copy in 1989, and the report was published in a special free sixteen page edition of &quot;The Observer&quot; on a Thursday morning. Publishing the report helped put the DTI inspectors&#x27; findings into the public arena, helping &quot;The Observer&quot;s libel defence, with the aim of pressuring the government into releasing the report. Lawyers from the DTI produced a court injunction and ordered all copies of &quot;The Observer&quot;s version of the report to be handed over or pulped. The report was officially published in 1990.

The DTI report said that the Al-Fayed brothers had &#x27;dishonestly represented their origins, their wealth, their business interests and their resources to the Secretary of State, to the Office of Fair Trading, to the House of Fraser board and shareholders, and their own advisers&#x27; Rowland and the Lohnro group had previously been strongly criticised by a 1976 DTI report, and had been described by Prime Minister Edward Heath as &quot;an unpleasant and unacceptable face of capitalism&quot;.

In 1993 the European Court of Human Rights dismissed a case brought by Al-Fayed and his brothers against the British Government, which had accused them of misrepresentation in the DTI report. They contended that the report had ruined their reputation and was not subject to appeal.

===Ownership of Harrods===
Harrods had entered a steady decline under Hugh Fraser, yet still accounted for half of the House of Fraser group&#x27;s profits. Determined to restore Harrods&#x27; fortunes, Al-Fayed hired Brian Walsh as manager of House of Fraser. Walsh created divisions in the company, and more than 200 buyers resigned in the next two years. Following arguments with Al-Fayed, Walsh was fired in October 1987. To calm staff, Al-Fayed distributed envelopes containing £2,000 in cash. Following Walsh&#x27;s departure, Al-Fayed moved his offices onto the fifth floor of Harrods, and took a more hands-on role as chairman of the store. Walsh was replaced by Michael Ellis-Jones, who was fired after eight weeks.
Christoph Bettermann became the deputy chairman of Harrods in 1990, after having worked for Al-Fayed in Dubai since 1984. Bettermann was approached to work in the Emirate of Sharjah, in April 1991, and in June, Bettermann told Maureen Orth, Al-Fayed &quot;showed me a written transcript of a phone conversation between the headhunter and me. He accused me of breaking our trust by talking to these people. I told him, &#x27;If you don&#x27;t trust me, I resign. I cannot trust you if you bugged my phone.&#x27;&quot; Bettermann quit his job at Harrods and went to work for an oil company in Sharjah.

Al-Fayed wrote to the ruler of Sharjah, and accused Bettermann of stealing large sums of money. Bettermann was cleared by three courts in which Fayed had pressed charges.

Al-Fayed delighted in retail theatre, and during his 25 years at Harrods dressed as a Harrods doorman, a boy scout and Father Christmas over the years. Celebrities were also hired to open the annual Harrods sale, and Harrods sponsored the annual Royal Windsor Horse Show as it had done since 1982. In 1997 Harrods&#x27; sponsorship of the horse show was terminated after Prime Minister John Major had urged the chairman of the show to find a new sponsor to save Queen Elizabeth II from association with Al-Fayed.

The artist and designer, William Mitchell, was hired by Al-Fayed to create an &#x27;entertaining retail environment&#x27;; this resulted in the creation of an Egyptian Hall on the ground floor of Harrods and, following its success, the Egyptian Escalators, which replaced the store&#x27;s central lifts. Mitchell also designed memorials for Dodi Fayed and Diana, Princess of Wales at Harrods. Al-Fayed claimed to have invested more than £400 million restoring Harrods, with £20 million or £75 million being spent on the Egyptian escalator.

In 1991 the House of Commons Trade and Industry Committee told the Governor of the Bank of England, Robin Leigh-Pemberton to order the Fayeds to transfer control of the Harrods Bank to trustees, after they found that the Fayeds were not &quot;fit and proper&quot; to run the bank. Al-Fayed bought his brother, Saleh, out of his interest in Harrods for £100 million in 1994. In 1994, before House of Fraser plc was relisted on the London Stock Exchange, Harrods was moved out of the group so that it could remain under the private ownership of the Al-Fayed and his family.

====Employee relations====
Al-Fayed was concerned by the loyalty of his staff, and employed two young Greek women as spies, to report on their fellow employees. The telephones of the shop workers&#x27; trade union, USDAW were bugged. Employees were signed to three-month contracts, and were often fired without agreed compensation, and forced to go to an industrial tribunal. Al-Fayed also listened in to his employees, and secretly recorded conversations about their sex lives.

Al-Fayed would customarily fire employees who offended his idea of aesthetics, being most offended by overweight staff or black people. To avoid hiring black people, Harrods required applicants to submit photographs. The number of black people employed by Harrods was eventually half the number employed by other London stores.

Francesca Bettermann, Harrods former legal counsel, said of Al-Fayed &quot;He likes a pretty face. He wouldn&#x27;t hire someone who was ugly. He liked them light-skinned, well educated, English, and young...I remember there was something on the application form that said, &#x27;Your colour, race&#x27; I said, &#x27;You&#x27;re not allowed to put that on the form,&#x27; and he said, &#x27;Well, make sure they put proper photos in, then.&#x27;&quot; In 1994 Harrods settled five racial-discrimination cases brought against the company, and, according to trade union officials, between June and September 1994, 23 of the 28 staff fired were black people, who had held mostly menial jobs.

A florist was rejected for employment by Harrods because she was black. The chairman of the subsequent industrial tribunal condemned Harrods&#x27;s defence as &#x27;malicious and dishonest&#x27;, stating &#x27;there was an act of blatant racial discrimination...by a very senior personnel officer working in a very large organisation...there was lying and deceit on the part of Harrods personnel to conceal the act of discrimination. There was dishonest testimony by Harrods personnel&#x27;.

====Royal warrants====
In August 2010, in a letter to the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, Al-Fayed revealed that he had burnt Harrods&#x27;s royal warrants, after taking them down in 2000. Harrods had held the Royal warrants since 1910. Describing the warrants as a &quot;curse&quot;, Al-Fayed claimed that business had tripled since their removal. The Duke of Edinburgh removed his warrant in January 2000, and the other warrants were removed from Harrods by Al-Fayed in December, pending their five-yearly review. The Duke of Edinburgh had been banned from Harrods by Al-Fayed. Film of the burning of the warrants in 2009 was shown in the final scene of &quot;Unlawful Killing&quot;, a film funded by Al-Fayed and directed by Keith Allen.

====Sale of Harrods====
After denials that it was for sale, Harrods was sold to Qatar Holdings, the sovereign wealth fund of the emirate of Qatar in May 2010. A spokesman for Al-Fayed said &quot;in reaching the decision to retire, (Al-Fayed) wished to ensure that the legacy and traditions that he has built up in Harrods would be continued.&quot; Harrods was sold for £1.5 billion.

Al-Fayed later said that he decided to sell Harrods following the difficulty in getting his dividend approved by the trustee of the Harrods pension fund. Fayed said &quot;I&#x27;m here every day, I can&#x27;t take my profit because I have to take a permission of those bloody idiots...I say is this right? Is this logic? Somebody like me? I run a business and I need to take bloody fucking trustee&#x27;s permission to take my profit&quot;. Al-Fayed was appointed honorary chairman of Harrods, for six months.
===Scotland real estate===
In 1972 Fayed purchased the Balnagown estate in Easter Ross in northern Scotland. From an initial , Al-Fayed went on to build the estate up to . He invested more than £20 million in the estate, restored the 14th-century pink Balnagown Castle, and created a tourist accommodation business. The Highlands of Scotland tourist board awarded Al-Fayed the Freedom of the Scottish Highlands in 2002, in recognition of his &quot;efforts to promote the area&quot;.

As an Egyptian with links to Scotland, Al-Fayed funded a 2008 reprint of the 15th-century chronicle &quot;Scotichronicon&quot; by Walter Bower. The &quot;Scotichronicon&quot; describes how Scota, a daughter of an Egyptian Pharaoh, fled her family and landed in Scotland, bringing with her the Stone of Scone. According to the chronicle, Scotland was later named in her honour. The tale is disputed by modern historians. Al-Fayed later declared that &quot;The Scots are originally Egyptians and that&#x27;s the truth.&quot;

In 2009 Al-Fayed revealed that he was a supporter of Scottish independence from the United Kingdom, announcing to the Scots that &quot;It&#x27;s time for you to waken up and detach yourselves from the English and their terrible politicians...whatever help is needed for Scotland to regain its independence, I will provide it...when you Scots regain your freedom, I am ready to be your president.&quot;

===Charity===
Fayed set up the Al Fayed Charitable Foundation in 1987 aiming to help children with life-limiting conditions and children living in poverty. The charity works mainly with charities and hospices for disabled and neglected children in the UK, Thailand, and Mongolia. It works with charities including Francis House Hospice in Manchester, Great Ormond Street Hospital, and ChildLine. In September 1997, West Heath School in Sevenoaks, Kent, United Kingdom, was placed into receivership. West Heath was the former school of Diana, Princess of Wales. Al-Fayed bought the school for £2.5 million in May 1998 and it became the new premises for the Beth Marie Centre for Traumatised Children, which had previously been based in Sevenoaks. The school reopened as The New School at West Heath in September 1998. In 2011 Mohamed Al-Fayed&#x27;s daughter Camilla, who had worked as an ambassador for the charity for eight years, opened the newly refurbished Zoe&#x27;s Place baby hospice in West Derby, Liverpool.

===Fulham F.C.===
Al-Fayed bought west London professional football club Fulham F.C. for £6.25 million in 1997. The purchase was made via Bill Muddyman&#x27;s Muddyman Group. His long-term aim was that Fulham would become a Premier League side within five years. In the 2000–01 season, Fulham won the First Division under manager Jean Tigana, winning 101 points and scoring 90 goals, and were promoted to the Premier League. This meant that Al-Fayed had achieved his Premier League aim a year ahead of schedule. By 2002, Fulham were competing in European football, winning the Intertoto Cup and participating in the UEFA Cup. Fulham reached the 2010 UEFA Europa League final, which they lost to Atletico Madrid, and continued to play in the Premier League throughout Al-Fayed&#x27;s tenure as owner, which ended in 2013.

Fulham temporarily left Craven Cottage while it was being upgraded to meet modern safety standards. There were fears that the club would not return to the Cottage after it was revealed that Al-Fayed had sold the first right to build on the ground to a property development firm.
Fulham lost a legal case against former manager Tigana in 2004 after Al-Fayed had wrongly alleged that Tigana had overpaid more than £7m for new players and had negotiated transfers in secret. In 2009, Al-Fayed said that he was in favour of a wage cap for footballers, and criticised the management of The Football Association and Premier League as &quot;run by donkeys who don&#x27;t understand business, who are dazzled by money.&quot;

A statue of the American entertainer Michael Jackson was unveiled by Al-Fayed in April 2011 at Craven Cottage. In 1999 Jackson had attended a league game against Wigan Athletic at the stadium. Following criticism of the statue, Al-Fayed said &quot;If some stupid fans don&#x27;t understand and appreciate such a gift this guy gave to the world they can go to hell. I don&#x27;t want them to be fans.&quot; The statue was taken down by the club&#x27;s new owners in 2013; Al-Fayed blamed the club&#x27;s subsequent relegation from the Premier League on the &#x27;bad luck&#x27; brought by its removal. Al-Fayed then donated the statue to the National Football Museum. In March 2019, the statue was removed from the museum, with a spokesperson saying it had been planned for &quot;several months&quot; to introduce exhibits that &quot;better represent&quot; football; the removal followed accusations of child sexual abuse by Jackson in the documentary &quot;Leaving Neverland&quot;.

Under Al-Fayed Fulham F.C. was owned by Mafco Holdings, based in the tax haven of Bermuda and in turn owned by Al-Fayed and his family. By 2011, Al-Fayed had lent Fulham F.C. £187 million in interest free loans. In July 2013, it was announced that Al-Fayed had sold the club to Pakistani American businessman Shahid Khan, who owns the NFL&#x27;s Jacksonville Jaguars.

==Business interests==
Al-Fayed&#x27;s business interests included:

* Balnagowan Castle &amp; Estates, Scottish Highlands
* 75 Rockefeller Plaza, New York City – built in 1947, originally the Esso Building, later the Time Warner Building; owned by Al-Fayed and managed and leased by RXR Realty

His major business purchases included:

* House of Fraser Group, including Harrods (1985, £615 million; sold 2010, £1.5 billion)
* Fulham Football Club (1997, £30 million; sold 2013 for between £150 and £200 million)
* After the death of Wallis Simpson, Fayed took over the lease of the Villa Windsor in Paris, the former home of the Duchess of Windsor and her husband, the Duke of Windsor, previously Edward VIII. Together with his valet Sydney Johnson, who had also been valet to the Duke, he organised the restoration of the villa and its collections.

===Media interests===
In 1996 Al-Fayed established Liberty Publishing, with the goal of the company stated as &quot;to launch and acquire or take strategic interests in significant media businesses&quot;.

The chairman of Liberty Publishing was Stewart Steven, the former editor of the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;, with John Dux the chief executive, a former managing director of News International. Al-Fayed had failed in bids to buy the newspaper &quot;Today&quot; from Lonrho in 1986 and from News International in 1995. Al-Fayed believed that the British government had put pressure on Rupert Murdoch, CEO of News International not to sell the newspaper to him. Andrew Neil was recruited by Liberty Publishing, and helped agree a £4 million takeover of London News Radio. The takeover later collapsed.

Steven dined with Hugo Young, chairman of the Scott Trust at the Garrick Club, and offered a cheque for £17 million from Al-Fayed for &quot;The Observer&quot; newspaper. Young declined this offer, and another of £25 million. A women-only radio station, Viva Radio, was bought for £3 million in May 1996. Viva Radio was renamed Liberty Radio, and broadcast commentaries of Fulham F.C.&#x27;s home and away games. The station was sold to UCKG in 2000. Due to debts of £6.5 million, Liberty Publishing was wound down by Al-Fayed&#x27;s brother, Ali, in 1996. Steven, Dux and Mike Hollingsworth were fired, but Andrew Neil was retained as a consultant.

===Property===
Al-Fayed owned 55 and 60 Park Lane, and a building on South Street, Mayfair. All three buildings were secretly connected to the Dorchester Hotel, which Al-Fayed purchased for Hassanal Bolkiah, the Sultan of Brunei.

In 1995 Westminster City Council believed that Hyde Park Residences, the company letting 170 luxury flats at 55 and 60 Park Lane, had been wrongly reporting the flats as let on long leases to avoid paying higher business rates due on short tenancies. The council demanded an additional £1.1 million, and Al-Fayed believed that the letting agent, Sandra Lewis-Glass had betrayed his confidence to the council. After bugging Lewis-Glass&#x27;s telephone calls and placing her under surveillance, John McNamara, the head of Al-Fayed&#x27;s security and a former Metropolitan Police officer, alleged to police that she had stolen two floppy disks worth 80 pence. Denying the accusation, Lewis-Glass was released without charge, and later sued for wrongful dismissal, winning £13,500.

In the early 1970s Al-Fayed purchased the Castle St. Therese in the Parc de St Tropez on the French Riviera, a chalet in Gstaad, Switzerland, and Barrow Green Court and farm, near Oxted, Surrey.

In &quot;Bocardo SA v Star Energy UK&quot; the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom denied Al-Fayed compensation after an energy company, Star Energy, had drilled for oil under his Surrey estate. Al-Fayed originally won a share of the oil proceeds at the High Court, but was later told by appeal judges he could only claim damages. Bocardo SA was a company owned by Al-Fayed that owned his estates in Scotland and Surrey; it was based in Liechtenstein.

== Personal life ==
Fayed was married from 1954 to 1956 to Samira Khashoggi. He worked with his brother-in-law, Saudi Arabian arms dealer and businessman Adnan Khashoggi. In 1985, Fayed married the Finnish socialite and former model Heini Wathén, with whom he had four children, including Omar.

Sometime in the early 1970s, he began using the prefix &quot;al-&quot; () in his name, rendering his name in English as &quot;al-Fayed&quot; rather than simply &quot;Fayed&quot;. In Arabic names, the word &quot;al-&quot;, in conjunction with the name of an ancestor, means &quot;family of&quot; or &quot;House of&quot;. This aristocratic prefix led to &quot;Private Eye&quot; magazine nicknaming him the &quot;Phoney Pharaoh&quot;. His brothers Ali and Salah followed suit at the time of their acquisition of the House of Fraser in the 1980s, though by the late 1980s, both had backtracked on the practice.

Max Hastings, the former editor of the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, wrote that Al-Fayed had &quot;harried&quot; Conrad Black, the former owner of the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;in pursuit of his demand to be referred to in our newspaper as &quot;Al Fayed&quot;. I sent the chairman a note, explaining that this was a long-running saga: &quot;The Fayeds have been seeking for years to call themselves Al Fayed, just as a socially ambitious Frenchman might seek to style himself de Fayed, or a German von Fayed ... At one level, it is harmless if the Fayeds wish to call themselves kings of Sheba, but I always feel determined to demonstrate that we will not be threatened.&quot;

=== Death of Dodi Fayed ===
==== Background and relationship with Princess Diana ====
Lady Diana Spencer married Charles, Prince of Wales, then heir apparent to the British throne in 1981, becoming Princess of Wales. She was an international celebrity and a frequent visitor to Harrods in the 1980s. Al-Fayed and Dodi first met Diana and Charles in July 1986 when they were introduced at a polo tournament sponsored by Harrods.

Diana and Charles divorced in 1996. She was hosted by Al-Fayed in the south of France in mid-1997, with her sons, Princes William and Harry. For the holiday, Fayed bought a 195 ft yacht, the &quot;Jonikal&quot; (later renamed the &quot;Sokar&quot;). Dodi and Diana later began a private cruise on the &quot;Jonikal&quot; and paparazzi photographs of the couple in an embrace were published. Diana&#x27;s friend, the journalist Richard Kay, confirmed that Diana was involved in &quot;her first serious romance&quot; since her divorce.

Dodi and Diana went on a second private cruise on the &quot;Jonikal&quot; in the third week of August, and returned from Sardinia to Paris on 30 August. Later that day, the couple privately dined at the Ritz, after the behaviour of the press caused them to cancel a restaurant reservation. They planned to spend the night at Dodi&#x27;s apartment near the Arc de Triomphe. In an attempt to deceive the paparazzi, a decoy car left the front of the hotel, while Diana and Dodi departed from the rear of the hotel in a Mercedes-Benz S280 driven by concierge Henri Paul. Five minutes later, the car crashed in the Pont de l&#x27;Alma tunnel. Dodi and Paul were killed; Diana died later in hospital. British bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones, who sustained a serious head injury, was the sole survivor of the crash. Fayed arrived in Paris a day later and viewed Dodi&#x27;s body, which was returned to the United Kingdom for an Islamic funeral.

==== Conspiracy theories ====
From February 1998, Al-Fayed maintained that the crash was a result of a conspiracy, and later contended that the crash was orchestrated by MI6 on the instructions of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. His claims were dismissed by a French judicial investigation, but Fayed appealed the verdict.

The British Operation Paget, a Metropolitan police inquiry that concluded in 2006, also found no evidence of a conspiracy. To Operation Paget, Al-Fayed made 175 &quot;conspiracy claims&quot;.

An inquest headed by Lord Justice Scott Baker into the deaths of Diana and Dodi began at the Royal Courts of Justice, London, on 2 October 2007 and lasted for six months. It was a continuation of the original inquest that had begun in 2004.

At the Scott Baker inquest, Fayed accused the Duke of Edinburgh, the Prince of Wales, Lady Sarah McCorquodale, her sister, and numerous others, of plotting to kill the Princess of Wales. Their motive, he claimed, was that they could not tolerate the idea of the Princess marrying a Muslim.

Al-Fayed first claimed that the Princess was pregnant to the &quot;Daily Express&quot; in May 2001, and that he was the only person who had been told. Witnesses at the inquest who said the Princess was not pregnant, and could not have been, were part of the conspiracy according to Al-Fayed. Fayed&#x27;s testimony at the inquest was roundly condemned in the press as farcical. Members of the British Government&#x27;s Intelligence and Security Committee accused Fayed of turning the inquest into a &#x27;circus&#x27; and called for it to be ended prematurely. Lawyers representing Al-Fayed later accepted at the inquest that there was no direct evidence that either the Duke of Edinburgh or MI6 were involved in any murder conspiracy involving Diana or Dodi. A few days before Al-Fayed&#x27;s appearance, John MacNamara, a former senior detective at Scotland Yard and Al-Fayed&#x27;s investigator for five years from 1997, was forced to admit on 14 February 2008 that he had no evidence to suggest foul play, except for the assertions Al-Fayed had made to him. His admissions also related to the lack of evidence for Al-Fayed&#x27;s claims of the Princess&#x27;s pregnancy and the couple&#x27;s engagement.

The jury verdict, given on 7 April 2008, was that Diana and Dodi were &quot;unlawfully killed&quot; through the grossly negligent driving of Henri Paul, who was drunk, and the pursuing vehicles.

Al-Fayed&#x27;s lawyers accepted that there was no evidence to support the assertion that Diana was illegally embalmed to conceal pregnancy, or that a pregnancy could be confirmed by any medical evidence. They also accepted that there was no evidence to support the assertion that the French emergency and medical services had played any role in a conspiracy to harm Diana. Following the Baker inquest, Al-Fayed said that he was abandoning his conspiracy campaign, and would accept the jury&#x27;s verdict.

Journalist Dominic Lawson wrote in &quot;The Independent&quot; in 2008 that Al-Fayed sought to concoct &quot;a conspiracy to cover up the true circumstances&quot; of fatalities caused by the crash &quot;involving an intoxicated and over-excited driver (an employee of Mohamed Fayed&#x27;s Paris Ritz)&quot;. He &quot;had remarkable success in persuading elements of the tabloid press, notably the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, to give the conspiracy a fair wind.&quot;

Al-Fayed financially supported &quot;Unlawful Killing&quot; (2011), a documentary film presenting his version of events. It was not formally released because of the potential for libel suits.

=== Nationality ===
Al-Fayed was born an Egyptian citizen, entered Haiti on a Kuwaiti passport, and left Haiti with a Haitian diplomatic passport with which he entered the United Kingdom in 1964. In 1970 Al-Fayed informed Mahdi Al Tajir that he and his brothers&#x27; Haitian diplomatic passports had expired, and their Egyptian passports made it difficult for them to obtain visas in many countries. Tajir secured Emirati passports for Al-Fayed, but not Emirati nationality. On the passport documents Al-Fayed had his date of birth changed from 1929 to 1933, making himself four years younger. His two brothers reduced their ages by ten years on their new passports.

The rulers of Dubai, the Al Maktoum family, had refused to renew the Fayeds&#x27; passports in 1993, and so they reverted to travelling on their original Egyptian passports. Mohamed and Ali Al-Fayed applied for British citizenship in early 1993. Ali&#x27;s application was supported by Gordon Reece and Peter Hordern, and Mohamed&#x27;s by Lord Bramall and Jeffrey Archer. The Al-Fayed brothers&#x27; application for British citizenship was rejected in December 1993, on the basis that the DTI report disqualified them from citizenship. Michael Howard, the Conservative home secretary, asked for the decision to be reviewed, fearing renewed embarrassment over his connections with alleged fraudster Harry Landy, which surfaced during the DTI investigation. The application was rejected again in February 1995, and in 1996 the High court declared that the home secretary could not deny, without explanation, the Al-Fayeds&#x27; citizenship requests. The Home Office later abandoned its appeal to the House of Lords against the High Court&#x27;s decision.

In 1997, Jack Straw, the home secretary in the new Labour government, reconsidered the Al-Fayeds&#x27; citizenship request, but rejected Mohamed Al-Fayed&#x27;s request in May 1999. Ali Al-Fayed had had his request for citizenship granted in March 1999.

The rejection was attributed to Al-Fayed&#x27;s admitting that he bribed politicians and his breaking in to safety deposit boxes in Harrods. Al-Fayed described the decision as &quot;perverse&quot; and said he was a victim of the British establishment and &quot;zombie&quot; politicians.

=== Death ===
Al-Fayed died in London on 30 August 2023, at the age of 94. His cause of death was listed as old age and was announced on 1 September. He was buried that day at Barrow Green Court alongside Dodi, after a funeral service during Friday prayers at London Central Mosque.

=== In popular culture ===

Al-Fayed was portrayed by Salim Daw in seasons 5 and 6 of &quot;The Crown&quot;. Al-Fayed appeared on an episode of &quot;Da Ali G Show&quot; in 2000, and the &quot;Howard Stern Show&quot; in 2007. Al-Fayed appeared on the 2011 edition of British Celebrity Big Brother and set the housemates a task based on dressing up as ancient Egyptian mummies. In the 2007 BBC sitcom Gavin &amp; Stacey, Nessa recounts having a sexual relationship with Al-Fayed.

== Sexual misconduct allegations ==
Al-Fayed has been accused by multiple women of sexual harassment and assault. Young women applying for employment at Harrods were often subjected to HIV tests and gynaecological examinations. They were then selected to spend the weekend with Al-Fayed in Paris.

=== Early allegations ===
In &quot;Holy War at Harrods&quot;, a 1995 profile of Al-Fayed for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, Maureen Orth described how, according to former employees, &quot;Fayed regularly walked the store on the lookout for young, attractive women to work in his office. Those who rebuffed him would often be subjected to crude, humiliating comments about their appearance or dress... A dozen ex-employees I spoke with said that Fayed would chase secretaries around the office and sometimes try to stuff money down women&#x27;s blouses&quot;. Al-Fayed sued &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, resulting in a settlement with no damages paid, but requiring &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; to place all evidence in locked storage. &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; chose to settle in part out of sympathy for Princess Diana&#x27;s fatal crash.

In December 1997, the ITV current affairs programme &quot;The Big Story&quot; broadcast testimonies from former Harrods employees who spoke of how Al-Fayed routinely sexually harassed women in similar ways. Al-Fayed was interviewed under caution by the Metropolitan Police after an allegation of sexual assault against a 15-year-old schoolgirl in October 2008. The case was dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service when they found there was no realistic chance of conviction due to conflicting statements.

A December 2017 episode of Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Dispatches&quot; programme alleged that Al-Fayed sexually harassed three female Harrods employees, and attempted to &quot;groom&quot; them. One of the employees was aged 17 at the time. Cheska Hill-Wood waived her right to anonymity to be interviewed for the programme. The programme alleged Al-Fayed targeted young employees over a 13-year period.

Early media scrutiny of sexual misconduct allegations against Al-Fayed was curtailed by his frequent threats of litigation. Al-Fayed developed a reputation for spending large sums on litigation against media outlets reporting on sexual assault allegations against him. The lack of scrutiny was also attributed to the actions of Al-Fayed&#x27;s security chief, John MacNamara, who allegedly threatened and surveilled potential witnesses and victims.

=== Sexual misconduct scandal ===
In September 2024, BBC News reported that more than 20 women who had worked at Harrods have alleged that Al-Fayed sexually assaulted them; five of these women accused him of raping them. Former manager of the women&#x27;s club Fulham L.F.C., Gaute Haugenes said in September 2024 that to protect players from Al-Fayed they were not allowed to be left alone with him. He also said that members of staff were aware that he &quot;liked young, blonde girls&quot;. A documentary, &quot;Al-Fayed: Predator at Harrods&quot; was broadcast on BBC Two which featured interviews with the women and explored evidence of the failure by Harrods to properly investigate the claims and the potential &quot;cover-up&quot; of abuse allegations. On 21 September 2024, Dean Armstrong KC, a barrister representing alleged victims, said his team had 37 clients, but that he had been contacted by 150 individuals with claims about Al-Fayed. In September 2024, it has been reported that Kristina Svensson, who worked at Ritz hotel, will be the first victim to file a complaint against Mohamed Al Fayed in France, while previously the focus was on London.
On 26 September 2024, the Metropolitan Police said they would be exploring to see if anyone else should be pursued for criminal offences following the allegations made against Al-Fayed. On the same day, Harrods&#x27;s managing director, Michael Ward, said Al Fayed &quot;presided over a toxic culture of secrecy, intimidation, fear of repercussion and sexual misconduct&quot;.

By 26 September it was thought that around 200 women, who previously worked for Al Fayed, had spoken to investigators with claims of rape and sexual assault.
In addition to reported sexual assault issues at Harrods, on 26 September sexual assault allegations were also made relating to Al-Fayed&#x27;s ownership of Fulham FC between 1997 and 2013. On 27 September lawyers representing those making allegations against Al-Fayed said they were working with 60 women.

On 11 October the Metropolitan Police revealed that 40 new allegations, from 40 different people, including sexual assault and rape, had been made against Al-Fayed, covering a period between 1979 and 2013.

On 18 October, former Fulham Ladies F.C. captain Ronnie Gibbons said that she had been groped twice by Al Fayed and that he had forcefully tried to kiss her in his private office at the Harrods store in 2000, when she was 20 years old.
By 21 October, Harrods announced that they were in the process of settling more than 250 claims for compensation brought by women who had alleged sexual misconduct by Al Fayed. By 31 October, 400 alleged victims or witnesses had presented themselves to lawyers concerning allegations of sexual misconduct. It was described, at the time, by a lawyer representing the Justice for Harrods Survivors group as &quot;the worst case of corporate abuse of women the world has ever seen&quot;. Some women claimed that they had been sexually abused by both Al Fayed and his brother Salah, who died of pancreatic cancer in 2010.

In November 2024, it was found that the Metropolitan Police were told about allegations of sexual assault against Al Fayed ten years earlier than it had acknowledged. The Met had claimed that it first received such allegations in 2005. However, in 1995, the Met had received such allegations from Samantha Ramsay, who is now deceased. The BBC reported that &quot;Samantha&#x27;s family say the Met dismissed her claims. They believe that multiple women could have been saved from sexual abuse if the force had acted.&quot; The Met claimed that there was no history of Samantha&#x27;s allegations on their computer system, &quot;but that in 1995 some reports were paper-based and might not have been transferred.&quot; Ramsay&#x27;s sister, Emma, recalled the police as having said at the time: &quot;We&#x27;ve added it to a pile of other female names that we&#x27;ve got that have made the same complaint against Mohamed Al Fayed.&quot; The Metropolitan Police has said it is investigating more than five people it believes may have assisted or enabled Al Fayed&#x27;s sexual offences.
By the end of November 2024, the inquiry was looking into alleged offences between 1977 and 2014 with the youngest victim aged 13.
