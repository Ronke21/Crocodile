== Acting career ==
=== 1980s: Early roles and breakthrough ===
Dixit made her cinema debut in 1984 with Rajshri Productions&#x27; drama &quot;Abodh&quot;, opposite Bengali actor, Tapas Paul. Upon release, the film failed commercially but Dixit&#x27;s performance earned her positive reviews from critics. Aakash Barvalia of Gomolo wrote, &quot;Madhuri excels in her role as a young bride who acquits herself well as the naive village girl and does not realise what marriage actually entails.&quot; Her only release of 1985 – &quot;Awara Baap&quot; – flopped at the box office. During this time, a monochrome photograph of hers, shot by Gautam Rajadhyaksha was featured on the cover of the then-popular magazine &quot;Debonair&quot; and she appeared as the cover girl of Filmfare in April 1986.

Dixit&#x27;s next four releases were the dramas &quot;Swati&quot; (1986), &quot;Manav Hatya&quot; (1986), &quot;Hifazat&quot; (1987) and &quot;Uttar Dakshin&quot; (1987). None of these films performed well either critically or commercially. Hifazat marked Dixit&#x27;s first of several collaborations with Anil Kapoor. In 1988, Dixit had film releases; two of them —&quot;Mohre&quot;, and &quot;Khatron Ke Khiladi&quot; —were commercial failures.

In 1988, Dixit acted in &quot;Dayavan&quot;, which was a commercially successful film. In her next movie from the same year she finally attained recognition when she played Mohini, an impoverished and miserable woman, who is forced to dance to make money for her father in N. Chandra&#x27;s action drama &quot;Tezaab&quot; opposite Anil Kapoor. It went on to become the highest-grossing film of the year and she received her first Filmfare Award for Best Actress nomination; the film&#x27;s success established Dixit as a leading actress of Hindi cinema, and marked a significant turning point in her career. Akshay Shah of &quot;Planet Bollywood&quot; wrote, &quot;Madhuri Dixit also gives a fine tuned performance. Though she is more remembered for her crowd pleasing dance act &#x27;Ek Do Teen&#x27;, her acting needs to be noted, specially in the scenes where she is pitted against Anupam Kher.&quot;

Her first release of 1989, &quot;Vardi&quot;, did fairly well at the box office. She next re-united with Anil Kapoor for Subhash Ghai&#x27;s &quot;Ram Lakhan&quot;. She played Radha Shastri, a girl who falls in love with her childhood friend, but finds it hard to convince her father. Finishing up as the second highest-grossing film of the year, &quot;Ram Lakhan&quot; emerged as a &quot;super-hit&quot; at the box office. Dixit&#x27;s next release was the romantic drama &quot;Prem Pratigyaa&quot;, in which she was paired opposite Mithun Chakraborty. Her portrayal of Laxmi Rao, a distraught woman who influences a local underworld don letting him give up his bad habits, earned her a second nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress. Dixit collaborated with Trimurti Films for the action thriller &quot;Tridev&quot; which featured an ensemble cast (Sunny Deol, Naseeruddin Shah, Jackie Shroff, Sangeeta Bijlani, Sonam and Amrish Puri). It finished up as one of the biggest hits and the third highest-grossing film of the year.

Her next release of the year, Vidhu Vinod Chopra&#x27;s drama &quot;Parinda&quot;, co-starring Anil Kapoor, Jackie Shroff and Nana Patekar was another box office hit. She played Paro, a schoolteacher who is killed on her wedding night along with Karan (played by Kapoor) by a gangster (played by Patekar). A major critical success, the film was included in News18&#x27;s 2013 list of the &quot;100 greatest Indian films of all time&quot;. It was selected as the official Indian submission for the 1990 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film but was not nominated. Rediff.com opined that Dixit added &quot;touching vulnerability and soft focus appeal to the heavy duty proceedings&quot;. Also that year, after &quot;Prem Pratigyaa&quot; she starred in &quot;Ilaaka&quot;, &quot;Mujrim&quot; (both opposite Mithun Chakraborty) and all three were hits. Other films such as &quot;Paap Ka Ant&quot; (opposite Govinda) and &quot;Kanoon Apna Apna&quot; (opposite Sanjay Dutt) was an average grosser.

=== 1990s: Established actress ===

In 1990, Dixit appeared in nine films. Five of them—&quot;Maha-Sangram&quot;, &quot;Deewana Mujh Sa Nahin&quot;, &quot;Jeevan Ek Sanghursh&quot;, &quot;Sailaab&quot; and &quot;Jamai Raja&quot;—were commercially unsuccessful. Her next release that year was Rakesh Roshan&#x27;s action comedy &quot;Kishen Kanhaiya&quot; (alongside Anil Kapoor and Shilpa Shirodkar). It tells the story of twin brothers who are separated at birth and re-unite in their youth. Dixit and Shirodkar played the love interests of Kapoor&#x27;s characters. It was the fourth-highest-grossing film of the year in India. Dixit next played a strong-willed woman in the box-office average action drama &quot;Izzatdaar&quot;. She won her first Filmfare Award for Best Actress for portraying Madhu, a rich and arrogant girl who falls in love with a poorer boy, in Indra Kumar&#x27;s romantic drama &quot;Dil&quot; opposite Aamir Khan. It emerged as the highest-grossing film of the year. Rediff.com hailed her performance, commenting &quot;..she showed her range as a performer. She breathed fire as the rebellious lover defying her family, or the forlorn estranged wife longing to be with her ailing better half.&quot; Dixit&#x27;s final release of the year was the action drama &quot;Thanedaar&quot;, opposite Dutt, which was another commercial hit.

In 1991, Dixit had five film releases, the first of which was the romance &quot;Pyar Ka Devta&quot;. She next starred alongside Jackie Shroff in the psychological thriller &quot;100 Days&quot;. She played Devi, a clairvoyant woman who has a vision of a murder and sets out to uncover the truth. The film was a moderately successful.

The film was a joint NFDC-Doordarshan production and went on to win the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi. Dixit&#x27;s next release of the year was Kumar&#x27;s drama &quot;Beta&quot;, co-starring Anil Kapoor and Aruna Irani. Dixit&#x27;s portrayal of Saraswati, an educated woman who rebels against her manipulative mother-in-law, earned her critical acclaim. Sukanya Verma mentioned that Dixit delivered &quot;a powerhouse performance against an equally lethal looking Irani, even as Kapoor was overshadowed between the ladies.&quot; The film finished up as the biggest hit of the year and won her a second Filmfare Award for Best Actress. Following the film&#x27;s success, Dixit became famously known as the &quot;Dhak Dhak Girl&quot;. &quot;Zindagi Ek Juaa&quot;, &quot;Prem Deewane&quot;, &quot;Khel&quot; and &quot;Sangeet&quot; were her other releases of the year.

In 1993, Dixit appeared in Ramesh Talwar&#x27;s &quot;Sahibaan&quot; which was commercially successful. Dixit next reunited with Sanjay Dutt and Jackie Shroff in Subhash Ghai&#x27;s crime drama &quot;Khalnayak&quot;. Her portrayal of Ganga, a police officer, who volunteers to go undercover, to trap an escaped criminal, garnered her critical acclaim. &quot;India Today&quot; wrote, &quot;..she grinds and thrusts in her trademark dhak dhak style. The whistles grow deafening when she stares into the camera, looks at every man in the dark, and promises him her heart-and much more. In one Bangalore theatre, the police were kept on stand-by in case the crowds went berserk.&quot; Dixit&#x27;s performance in &quot;Khalnayak&quot; earned her a sixth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress and became the second highest-grossing film of the year in India. Singeetam Srinivasa Rao&#x27;s &quot;Phool&quot; and Lawrence D&#x27;Souza&#x27;s &quot;Dil Tera Aashiq&quot; were her other releases of the year.

In 1994, Dixit starred in Rahul Rawail&#x27;s psychological thriller &quot;Anjaam&quot;, which marked her first of many collaborations with Shah Rukh Khan. Dixit&#x27;s portrayal of Shivani Chopra, a revenge-seeking wife and mother earned her a seventh nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress. The film performed moderately well at the box office. Her next release was Rajshri Productions&#x27; family drama &quot;Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!&quot; opposite Salman Khan. The film emerged as one of the biggest hits in the history of Hindi cinema and made 1.35 billion worldwide, breaking the record of the film &quot;Sholay&quot; (1975). It became the highest grossing Bollywood film in Hindi cinema history after its theatrical run and held the record for 7 years till the release of &quot;&quot; (2001).

Critics believed the film to be &quot;too sweet&quot; but appreciated Dixit&#x27;s performance. Tripat Narayanan of &quot;New Straits Times&quot; wrote &quot;The Madhuri magic looms large throughout the film. As she emotes through dance, you simply cannot take your eyes off her.&quot; In a retrospect review, &quot;Rediff&quot; wrote, &quot;Madhuri&#x27;s Nisha was stunning, enthused, plucky and irresistible.&quot; Film critic K Hariharan noted, &quot;She is seducing every person on screen, but does it in ways that are so graceful, there is a good balance between profanity and the sacred.&quot; The film won two National Film Awards, including the Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment and in the Millennium Edition of the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;, &quot;Hum Aapke Hain Koun&quot; became Bollywood&#x27;s highest-grossing film.

Dixit achieved further success when she reunited with Indra Kumar for the romantic drama &quot;Raja&quot; opposite Sanjay Kapoor. She portrayed Madhu, a rich girl who falls for her childhood friend (played by Kapoor), however, she finds it tough to convince her two brothers of this relationship. It emerged as the third highest-grossing film of the year and its success was attributed to Dixit&#x27;s immense popularity. She won a second Screen Award for Best Actress for her performance. Her next release was David Dhawan&#x27;s &quot;Yaraana&quot; opposite Rishi Kapoor, in which she played Lalita, a dancer on the run from her abusive lover. The film underperformed at the box office. Both the films earned her nominations for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress.

The following year, both her films &quot;Prem Granth&quot; and &quot;Rajkumar&quot; flopped at the box office. In 1997, Dixit received critical acclaim for her portrayal of Ketki Singh, a village woman who struggles to confront and defeat the forces of oppression and male domination in Prakash Jha&#x27;s &quot;Mrityudand&quot; alongside Shabana Azmi and Shilpa Shirodkar. In a review for India Today, Anupama Chopra wrote, &quot; Dixit gives her career&#x27;s best performance. Simply dressed, she looks stunning and acts even better. She is by turns romantic, vulnerable, angry – the perfect foil to Azmi&#x27;s long-suffering &#x27;badi bahu&#x27;.&quot; &quot;Screen&quot; magazine deemed her portrayal &quot;fiery&quot; and appreciated the lack of glamour in the part. For her performance, Dixit won a third Screen Award for Best Actress. She next starred in the dramas &quot;Koyla&quot;, &quot;Mahaanta&quot; and &quot;Mohabbat&quot;. With the exception of Koyla, none of these films performed well either critically or commercially.

Dixit&#x27;s fifth and final release of 1997 was Yash Chopra&#x27;s musical romantic drama &quot;Dil To Pagal Hai&quot;. Co-starring Shah Rukh Khan, Karisma Kapoor and Akshay Kumar, the film depicts the love stories of the dancers in a musical dance troupe. Her role of Pooja, a woman faced with a moral dilemma in a love quadrangle fetched her a fourth Filmfare Award for Best Actress and the Zee Cine Award for Best Actor – Female. &quot;Dil To Pagal Hai&quot; emerged as a blockbuster at the box office and emerged as the highest-grossing film of the year in India. At the 45th National Film Awards, the film won three awards, including the Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment.

She next starred in the N.Chandra-directed drama &quot;Wajood&quot; (1998) opposite Nana Patekar and Mukul Dev. She played Apoorva, a very rich girl who is misunderstood by Malhar, played by Patekar. Suparn Verma of &quot;Rediff&quot; commented: &quot;..She nevertheless shows that even a weak role cannot stifle her as she animates the screen like only she can. Truly, the coming together of Nana, Madhuri and Chandra in one film is a tour de force.&quot; The same year, she appeared in a cameo role in the comedy &quot;Bade Miyan Chote Miyan&quot;, once again playing herself onscreen after &quot;Dharavi&quot;. Her next and only release of 1999 was the romance &quot;Aarzoo&quot; (1999) opposite Akshay Kumar and Saif Ali Khan. Upon release, the film emerged commercially unsuccessful.

=== 2000s: Career fluctuations and sabbaticals ===

In 2000, Dixit starred in Rajkumar Santoshi&#x27;s &quot;Pukar&quot; opposite Anil Kapoor. A love story based on the backdrop of the Indian Army, the film was shot over a course of 350 days. Dixit&#x27;s portrayal of Anjali, a heartbroken and jealous woman who swears revenge on Jai (played by Kapoor) for rejecting her, garnered her several Best Actress nominations at various award ceremonies, including Filmfare and Screen. A review in &quot;Filmfare&quot; said that both &quot;Anil Kapoor and Madhuri, veterans in their field, outdo themselves in the film&quot;. It won two National Film Awards, including the Nargis Dutt Award for Best Feature Film on National Integration. She then played the title character in &quot;Gaja Gamini&quot;, the first feature film directed by painter M. F. Husain. Hussain got fixated with Dixit, and watched her movie &quot;Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!&quot; several times, and was certain that he would make a film only with her. The film followed the story of Gaja Gamini, who appears in various incarnations as Mona Lisa, Shakuntala and others. &quot;Pukar&quot; was an average grosser, while the latter underperformed at the box office.
In 2001, Dixit starred in Deepak Shivdasani&#x27;s love triangle &quot;Yeh Raaste Hain Pyaar Ke&quot; opposite Ajay Devgan and Preity Zinta. Upon release, the film met with largely negative reviews. Critic Gautam Buragohain, however, described her as &quot;the saving grace of the film&quot;, adding that &quot;she gives a delightful performance&quot;. Commercially too, the film failed to do well. Subsequently, Dixit reunited with Rajkumar Santoshi for the social drama &quot;Lajja&quot; (2001). Dealing with the issue of gender inequality, Dixit played Janki, a theatre actress who gets pre-maritally pregnant. Anita Bora of Rediff.com wrote: &quot;Madhuri slips into her role as Janaki..with consummate ease..and..dazzles us with a class act.&quot; The film was a box-office failure in India but was an overseas success. Dixit&#x27;s performance fetched her a Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress nomination and won her the Zee Cine Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role – Female. Dixit&#x27;s first release of 2002 was the love triangle &quot;Hum Tumhare Hain Sanam&quot; opposite Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan, where she played Radha whose married life blemishes when she gets obsessed with the career of her friend. A remake of director K. S. Adhiyaman&#x27;s own Tamil film &quot;Thotta Chinungi&quot; (1995), the film took six years in making, with huge sabbaticals in between shoots due to several production problems. The film emerged moderately successful at the Indian box office. Few critics noted that the delay made the film look outdated.

Dixit&#x27;s next release was Sanjay Leela Bhansali&#x27;s period romantic drama &quot;Devdas&quot;, co-starring Shah Rukh Khan and Aishwarya Rai. It was based on Sharat Chandra Chattopadhyay&#x27;s novel of the same name. She portrayed Chandramukhi, a courtesan who is in love with the title character. Sita Menon of Rediff.com wrote: &quot;The most understated role and perhaps the one that is most lingering, in terms of virtuosity, is that played by Madhuri Dixit. As Chandramukhi, she is simply stunning, lending passion, fire and gentleness with such consummate ease that watching her perform is sheer delight.&quot; The film was screened at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival and was featured by &quot;Time&quot; in their listing of the &quot;10 Best Films of the Millennium&quot;. The film emerged as a major commercial success with revenues of over . &quot;Devdas&quot; was chosen as India&#x27;s official entry for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and received a nomination for the BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language. At the 50th National Film Awards, the film won five awards, including the Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment. Dixit eventually won the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress and the Screen Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the film. Post &quot;Devdas&quot;, Dixit took a break from actively working in films to focus on her married life in Denver, Colorado.
In 2007, Dixit made her first comeback as an actress after five years with a leading role in cinematographer Anil Mehta&#x27;s dance film &quot;Aaja Nachle&quot;. She played Dia, a choreographer who returns to her town to save the endangered theatre where she learnt to dance. A box office failure, the film generated positive reviews for Dixit&#x27;s portrayal. Rajeev Masand of &quot;CNN-IBN&quot; criticised the plot, while he wrote about Dixit&#x27;s performance: &quot;It&#x27;s hard to take your eyes off the screen when she&#x27;s up there, dazzling you with her spontaneity, her easy charm and her 100-watt smile.&quot; Her performance earned her another nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress.

=== 2010s: Sporadic work and television focus ===

Dixit relocated to India with her family in 2011 and was felicitated by Filmfare with a special jury recognition for completing 25 years in the Indian film industry. In 2013, Dixit made a special appearance in the romantic comedy-drama &quot;Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani&quot; as Mohini, a callback to her character from the 1988 film &quot;Tezaab&quot;. Dixti appeared in the item song &quot;Ghagra&quot; alongside Ranbir Kapoor.

In 2014, Dixit first starred in the black comedy &quot;Dedh Ishqiya&quot;, a sequel to the 2010 film &quot;Ishqiya&quot; She played a con-woman, Begum Para, opposite Naseeruddin Shah, Arshad Warsi and Huma Qureshi and expressed that she agreed to do the film because of the &quot;unapologetic way&quot; director Abhishek Chaubey presented Vidya Balan&#x27;s character in &quot;Ishqiya&quot;. The film opened to positive response from critics who called it &quot;one of the year&#x27;s most important releases&quot;. Anupama Chopra called Dixit &quot;compelling&quot;, while Deepanjana Pal of Firstpost wrote &quot;She&#x27;s still capable of keeping an audience glued to their seats when the credits start rolling, all because she&#x27;s dancing on screen.&quot;. The film earned Dixit her fourteenth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress. &quot;Dedh Ishqiya&quot; earned little at the box-office.

Her next release of the year was debutant director Soumik Sen&#x27;s &quot;Gulaab Gang&quot;, alongside Juhi Chawla. Dixit portrayed Rajjo, the leader of a women&#x27;s activist group, inspired by the real vigilante activist Sampat Pal Devi and her group Gulabi Gang. Pal filed a case against the film claiming that the makers did not take permission to make a film on her life, but the court later lifted the stay from the film. To prepare for her role, Dixit practised Shaolin Kung fu, stick training, and close combat. &quot;Gulaab Gang&quot; failed at the box office, earning mixed reviews. Subhash K. Jha labelled Dixit&#x27;s performance and demeanour &quot;inconsistent&quot;. However, Sampat Pal claimed that in Dixit&#x27;s character she finds a &quot;reflection of her own life so stark&quot; that it makes her feel &quot;it was she on screen&quot;. The film was a box-office failure.

Four years later, Dixit made her debut in Marathi Cinema with the comedy drama &quot;Bucket List&quot;. She played Madhura Sane, a middle aged housewife who takes the initiative to complete the bucket list of her deceased teenage heart donor. Dixit garnered critical acclaim for her portrayal; Mihir Bhanage of &quot;The Times of India&quot;
wrote &quot;Madhuri owns the film and sails through it with flying colours.&quot; Kunal Guha of &quot;Mumbai Mirror&quot; said, &quot;Madhuri Dixit long-overdue debut in Marathi cinema is a comfort watch even if a tad predictable and sappy.&quot;

Dixit reunited with Anil Kapoor and Ajay Devgn in Indra Kumar&#x27;s adventure comedy &quot;Total Dhamaal&quot; (2019). She portrayed Bindu Patel, who along with a group of people learns about a hidden treasure and then races to claim it. The film received mixed to negative reviews, however, Dixit&#x27;s performance received a mixed-to-positive reception. Lakshana N Palat of &quot;India Today&quot; wrote: &quot;The little respite in this adventure-comedy is the pairing of Anil Kapoor and Madhuri Dixit, who prove that they still have the same impeccable chemistry and partnership almost two decades later.&quot; &quot;Total Dhamaal&quot; emerged as a major commercial success at the box office, grossing more than worldwide, and ranks as the ninth highest-grossing Hindi film of the year. Dixit produced the Marathi Netflix drama &quot;15 August&quot; under her production company RnM Moving Pictures. In an interview with Scroll.in, Dixit said, &quot;The film is about the freedom to love, the freedom to choose your career and the freedom to die&quot;.

She next starred in Abhishek Varman&#x27;s period romantic drama &quot;Kalank&quot;, featuring an ensemble cast including Sonakshi Sinha, Alia Bhatt, Varun Dhawan, Aditya Roy Kapur and Sanjay Dutt. Set in the 1940s prior to the partition of India, the film featured her as Bahaar Begum, the madam of a brothel. Saibal Chatterjee of &quot;NDTV&quot; wrote, &quot;In the blinding glow of Dixit&#x27;s presence as a nautch girl who can turn on the magic at will, the younger cast members pale somewhat in comparison. She lights up the screen as only she can, pushing the others to strive harder.&quot; It did not perform well at the box office; however, she earned a third nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the film.

== Social and humanitarian work ==
During her years in the film industry, Dixit has been actively involved in promoting children&#x27;s education and the safety of women. She featured in a series of one-minute telespots on preventing AIDS for the Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society in 2000. In 2001, Dixit won on Kaun Banega Crorepati, a game show then in its first season on the air. She donated her winnings for the welfare of the victims of 2001 Gujarat earthquake and to an orphanage in Pune.

NDTV organised India&#x27;s first 24-hour live telethon, a fund-raising event that brings in people to donate money to support TERI&#x27;s initiative—Lighting a Billion Lives which aims at providing solar power to villages without electricity.

On 3 February 2011, Dixit spent an evening with 75 orphanage kids of farmers at an ashram in Trimbakeshwar and participated in the birthdays of two children: Hrishikesh and Rani. &quot;We artists are ready to help such children. People from the higher society should come forward and stand firmly behind them,&quot; she said on the occasion. Dixit is a Goodwill Ambassador and a patron for &quot;Emeralds for Elephants&quot; – a charity project for the conservation of Asian elephants and other endangered species. The project has been designed to create awareness and raise vital funds for the protection of the critically endangered Asian elephant. A collaborative project between the World Land Trust (a UK based nonprofit environmental organisation) and the Wildlife Trust of India that is creating protected wildlife corridors connecting National Parks and protected areas to others. Speaking about the issue she said: &quot;Elephants are one of my favourite animals and I love them. So what we need to do today is to see how we can preserve our animals. I feel very strongly about this.&quot; Two years later, she made donations to the Uttarakhand flood relief.

In June 2013, while shooting for the sixth season of &quot;Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa&quot;, Dixit rescued seven puppies who were drenched in rain. Interrupting the shoot, Dixit, along with her husband Sriram Nene and the show&#x27;s director Saahil Chhabria contacted PETA, waiting till the volunteers arrived. In response, Sachin Bangera of PETA India said, &quot;It&#x27;s been raining cats and dogs and many puppies and kittens are now in need of good homes. Madhuri Dixit, Dr Nene and Saahil Chhabria&#x27;s kind deed will inspire many to come forward to help animals in distress.&quot;

In January 2014, Dixit and her husband, on behalf of PETA wrote letter to Kolhapur MLA Vinay Kore, requesting him to ensure relocation of the elephant Sunder to a sanctuary – &quot;(Sunder) has scars on his legs and cowers in fear and pain because he is being beaten by his mahout,&quot; &quot;He should live free from suffering, in the company of other elephants, and have the opportunity to roam vast distances&quot;.
Since 2014, Dixit began working with UNICEF to advocate the rights of children and prevent child labour and child trafficking. She participated in a fashion show organised by Lilavati hospital, to support the &#x27;Save &amp; Empower the Girl Child&#x27; initiative by the organisation. The same year, the Government of Madhya Pradesh appointed her as the brand ambassador for its Mamta Abhiyaan (maternal and child health) campaign. Dixit collaborated with Vogue for its Vogue Empower series on a short film on gender policing, &#x27;Boys don&#x27;t cry&#x27;, directed by Vinil Mathew. She was appointed as the brand ambassador for the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao campaign, by the Government of India in 2015, that aims to generate awareness and improve the efficiency of welfare services intended for girls. She lent her voice for narrating the story of one of the eight girls who featured in Girl Rising: Woh Padhegi, Woh Udegi, a film on the education and empowerment of girls. Dixit was appointed the brand ambassador and launched MAA (Mothers Absolute Affection), a flagship programme to ensure adequate awareness is generated on the benefits of breastfeeding.

Additionally, Dixit has made public appearances to support charities and causes. On 4 February 2012, Madhuri Dixit interacted with Cancer affected children on World Cancer Day which was organised by Pawan Hans Helicopters Ltd at Juhu, Mumbai. In 2013, she launched Sanofi India&#x27;s campaign on World Diabetes Day (WDD), that encourages people to take proactive steps to effectively prevent, manage and control diabetes. A year later, on 24 February 2014, she visited a school in Andheri, Mumbai to support the &quot;Support My School&quot; campaign. She participated in &#x27;Set Beautiful Free&#x27;– an event by One Foundation to provide home, education, food and healthcare to the daughters of trafficking victims. In 2018, she attended a charity event by &#x27;Nanhi Kali&#x27; NGO.

On 17 March 2019, Dixit and her family adopted an abandoned puppy rescued by PETA India. She said, &quot;Abandoning a companion dog or cat is the cruelest thing to do. I&#x27;m happy we will be able to give this pup a new lease of life,&quot;.

In March 2021, Dixit along with other Bollywood actors John Abraham, Shilpa Shetty and Sunny Leone joined PETA India for its 20th anniversary. In the virtual party, awards were given to those who have been championing animal rights. Dixit recalling joining the organisation to help elephants recalled, &quot;From there on it was the beginning of a beautiful friendship. Two years ago, my family adopted Carmelo, a cherished dog, from PETA India. Since then, I urge everyone I see to adopt a dog or a cat from the shelter or from the street.&quot;

False representation in endorsements

In May–June 2015 the Tamil Nadu Consumer&#x27;s Forum sent her notices for &quot;false representation&quot; in advertisements of Maggi, a noodle brand in which toxic levels of lead were found. She continued endorsing the safety of the product on Twitter, even when food regulators had already found more than 17 times the permissible limits of lead and the product was banned.

== Reception and legacy ==
=== Artistry ===
Dixit is regarded as one of the most accomplished and influential actresses of Indian cinema. Throughout the late 1980s, the 1990s and the early 2000s, Dixit was among the highest-paid actresses in the Indian entertainment industry. In 2000, the Guinness World Records book featured her as the highest-paid Indian actress. Dixit was placed at the first position by NDTV in 2012, in the listing of &quot;The most popular Bollywood actresses of all time&quot;. The next year, she was placed at the fourth position, behind Amitabh Bachchan, Dilip Kumar and Shah Rukh Khan and topped among female actors as the greatest Bollywood star in a UK poll celebrating 100 years of Indian cinema. The same year, in a national poll conducted by CNN-IBN on the occasion of the centenary of Indian cinema, Dixit was voted at the second position, behind Sridevi, as &quot;India&#x27;s Greatest Actress in 100 Years&quot;. In 2017, Dixit topped an &quot;India Today&quot; poll as the most popular actress of Hindi cinema till date.

Dixit has a significant following in the South Asian diaspora.

Saroj Khan, who has collaborated with her on numerous occasions, calls her a &quot;choreographer&#x27;s delight&quot;. &quot;Hindustan Times&quot; attributed her for giving a &#x27;technical twist&#x27; to dance sequences in Hindi films. Dixit was the muse for Indian painter M. F. Husain. He got fascinated by Dixit&#x27;s performance in &quot;Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!&quot;; watching the film 67 times, and booked an entire theatre to see her comeback &quot;Aaja Nachle&quot;.

Nene had never seen any of her films, and was unaware of her celebrity status. Dixit explained their relationship by saying, &quot;It was very important that he didn&#x27;t know me as an actress because then he would know me as a person first. When people have seen you as an actress, they have pre-conceived notions... None of it was there here with him. I found the right person, I wanted to get married and I did.&quot; Dixit and Nene&#x27;s wedding reception in Mumbai was attended by several prominent Indian personalities, including then Chief Minister of Maharashtra Vilasrao Deshmukh, Shivsena chief Bal Thackeray, Dilip Kumar, Saira Banu, Yash Chopra, Sridevi, and many others.

Dixit moved back to Mumbai with her family in October 2011. Speaking about it, Dixit said, &quot;I always love being here. I have grown up here in Mumbai so for me it is like coming back home. It was a different phase in my life, where I wanted to have a home, family, husband and children... everything that I had dreamt of.&quot;

<text>Mars Attacks is a science fiction-themed trading card series released in 1962 by Topps. The cards feature artwork by science fiction artists Wally Wood and Norman Saunders. The cards form a story arc, which tells of the invasion of Earth by cruel, hideous Martians under the command of a corrupt Martian government who conceal the fact from the Martian populace that Mars is doomed to explode and, therefore, proposes colonization of Earth to turn it into their new homeworld. The cards depict futuristic battle scenes and bizarre methods of Martian attack, torture and slaughter of humans, as well as various Earth nations being attacked. The story concludes with an expeditionary force of humans volunteering to embark on a counterattack on Mars, in which the Earth force attacks the Martians in their manner (bayoneting and bullets). The Earth attack forces, after destroying the Martian cities and killing the Martians, depart just before Mars is destroyed in the predicted cataclysm, thus ensuring the peace and safety of Earth as the Martian race is seemingly doomed to extinction. Backstories included how the invading Martians used growth rays to transform insects into monsters to attack cities, differing geographic regions dealing with the Martian invasion, Earth factions such as rival urban gangs and national differences having to be cast aside for the sake of repelling the invasion, or the sociology of Mars, in this case a small tribe of peaceful Martians who hoped to find a way to escape the destruction of Mars without attacking Earth, but their voice being overruled by the corrupt Martian government.

The cards proved popular with children, but depictions of explicit gore and implied sexual content caused an outcry, leading the company to halt production. The cards have since become collectors&#x27; items, with certain cards commanding over $3,500 at auction.

In the 1980s, Topps began developing merchandise based on the &quot;Mars Attacks&quot; storyline, including mini-comic books and card reprints. An expanded set of 100 cards called &quot;Mars Attacks Archives&quot; was issued in 1994 by Topps and spawned a second round of merchandising. Director Tim Burton released a feature film called &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot; in 1996 based on the series, spawning a third round of merchandising, including an intercompany crossover with the Image Universe, titled &quot;Mars Attacks Image&quot; and published by Image Comics. In 2012, Topps released a 50th anniversary expanded set of 75 cards called &quot;Mars Attacks Heritage&quot;, leading to a fourth round of merchandising that continued into 2017 with the release of an official sequel series, &quot;Mars Attacks: The Revenge!&quot;

==Trading cards==

The &quot;Mars Attacks&quot; trading card series was created by Topps in 1962. Product developer Len Brown, inspired by Wally Wood&#x27;s cover for EC Comics&#x27; &quot;Weird Science&quot; #16, pitched the idea to Woody Gelman. Gelman and Brown created the story — with Brown writing the copy — and created rough sketches. They enlisted Wood to flesh out the sketches and Bob Powell to finish them. Norman Saunders painted most of the 55-card set (Maurice Blumenfeld painted 10 - 20% of them, but Saunders provided the finishing touches to all of the images).

The cards, which sold for five cents per pack of five, were test marketed by Topps through the dummy corporation Bubbles, Inc. under the name &quot;Attack from Space&quot;. Sales were sufficient to expand the marketing and the name was changed to &quot;Mars Attacks&quot;. The cards sparked parental and community outrage over their graphic violence and implied sexuality. Topps responded initially by repainting 13 of the 55 cards to reduce the gore and sexuality. However, inquiries from a Connecticut district attorney caused Topps to halt production of the series altogether before the replacements could even be printed.

==Adaptations and merchandising==
In 1984, the first official item was released since the original series appeared: a direct copy of the original series of 55 cards, plus a 56th card that reprinted the wrapper graphics, was released by Renata Galasso Inc. through an agreement with Topps.

In 1994, Topps re-released the cards as an expanded version titled &quot;Mars Attacks Archives&quot;, with the original 55 cards and 45 &quot;New Visions&quot; cards. The 45 new cards are further divided into a #0 card, three subsets (&quot;The Unpublished 11&quot; (with 11 cards)), &quot;Mars Attacks: The Comics&quot; (with 10 cards) and &quot;Visions: New and Original&quot; a.k.a. &quot;New Visions&quot; (with 22 cards)) and one card titled &quot;Norm Saunders: A Self-Portrait&quot;. Twenty-one artists collaborated on the new cards, including Zina Saunders, the daughter of the original artist Norman Saunders. Topps Comics, in conjunction with the trading cards, issued a five-issue comic book miniseries based on the original 55 cards written by Keith Giffen and drawn by Charles Adlard. Topps Comics continued the story in an ongoing series that lasted seven issues, a one-shot special and three more miniseries. &quot;Wizard&quot; magazine and Topps Comics also published a #1/2 issue and an Ace Edition issue (#65).

In 1995, one year after the &quot;Archives&quot; series, Screamin&#x27; Productions and Topps released a tie-in set of eight &quot;Mars Attacks&quot; vinyl model kits with an accompanying series of eight new trading cards, each one inside one of the kits. Bonus items that could be acquired by sending in proof-of-purchase certificates from all eight of the kits were two new nearly identical bonus cards (one oversized card with the &quot;Mars Attacks&quot; logo on the top of it and one regular-sized card without it) and a limited edition ninth vinyl model kit.

In 1996, Warner Bros. released Tim Burton&#x27;s feature film adaptation &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot;. In conjunction, two hardcover novels were released: &quot;Mars Attacks: Martian Deathtrap&quot; by Nathan Archer; and &quot;Mars Attacks: War Dogs of the Golden Horde&quot; by Ray W. Murrill. Each contained two new trading cards inside the middle of each book (the paperback editions, however, did not have the trading cards inside them). A paperback movie tie-in novelization by the film&#x27;s screenwriter was also published, in addition to two comic book intercompany crossovers with Image Comics that continued the Topps Comics run titled &quot;Mars Attacks the Savage Dragon&quot; and &quot;Mars Attacks Image&quot;, both of which respectively depicted the Martians battling the Image Comics superhero the Savage Dragon and the Martians battling other characters from the wider Image Universe. Trendmasters also produced a series of toy figures based on the film.

In 2012, to commemorate the franchise&#x27;s 50th anniversary, Topps partnered with a variety of companies on comic books (via IDW Publishing), bobbleheads and vinyl figures (Funko Pop!), action figures and plush toys (Mezco Toyz), costumes (Incogneato), statues and busts (Quarantine Studio), electronics skins (Gelaskins) and a commemorative hardcover book and 2013 wall calendar, both with nearly identical sets of four new trading cards (the only difference being that the book&#x27;s cards had white borders on the front of the cards and the calendar&#x27;s cards had green borders) (Abrams Books). Topps also re-released the original 55-card series again as a second expanded version titled &quot;Mars Attacks Heritage&quot;, including two subsets (&quot;Deleted Scenes&quot; (with 10 cards) and &quot;Guide to the New Universe&quot; (with 15 cards)).

In 2013, Topps issued &quot;Mars Attacks: Invasion&quot;, a reboot series of 95 trading cards featuring a new story (&quot;Mars Attacks: Invasion&quot; (cards #1–58, plus a #0 promo card from the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con)) with new artwork cards (divided into &quot;Mars Invades IDW&quot; (cards #59–77 and #91–92) and &quot;Art of Mars Attacks&quot; (cards #78–90 and #93–95)) and including four new subsets (&quot;Mars Attacks: Early Missions&quot; (with six cards), &quot;Mars Attacks Masterpieces&quot; (with five cards), &quot;Join the Fight!&quot; (with four cards) and &quot;Anatomy of a Martian&quot; (also with six cards)). This was the last &quot;Mars Attacks&quot; trading card series to be sold in retail stores as of this date; all other such series have been sold online ever since.

A second series of trading cards, &quot;Mars Attacks: Occupation&quot;, also featuring a second reboot series of 81 trading cards that picked up where &quot;Mars Attacks: Invasion&quot; left off (&quot;Mars Attacks: Occupation&quot; (cards #1–45) with new artwork cards (divided into &quot;Art of Mars Attacks&quot; (cards #46–63), &quot;Factions&quot; (cards #64–72), &quot;Occupation Profiles&quot; (cards #73–78) and &quot;The Kickstarter Video&quot; (cards #79–81)) and including six new subsets (&quot;Mars Attacks Superstars&quot;, Mars Attacks: Then and Now!&quot;, &quot;Mars Attacks All-Star Art&quot; and &quot;Dinosaurs Attack! vs. Mars Attacks&quot; (each with nine cards (the last one of which was also available as a foil card set)), &quot;Attacky Packages&quot; (a hybrid subset between &quot;Mars Attacks&quot; and &quot;Wacky Packages&quot; with 13 cards; the last three cards in this subset were titled &quot;Attacky Packages Old School&quot; (like &quot;Dinosaurs Attack! vs. Mars Attacks&quot;, this one, too, was also available as a foil card set)) and &quot;Mars Attacks/Judge Dredd&quot; (with 18 cards)) was funded by Topps on Kickstarter in 2015 and released in 2016.

In 2017, to commemorate the franchise&#x27;s 55th anniversary, Topps released an official sequel series to the original 1962 55-card series called &quot;Mars Attacks: The Revenge!&quot;, which takes place five years after the events in the original series and chronicles a second invasion of Earth by the surviving Martians that were off-world and on Earth during the destruction of Mars. It contained 110 cards - the story itself (cards #1–55) and rough pencil art for the story cards (cards #P-1–P-55). No subsets were made for this series. It was sold as a complete box set that contained only the unwrapped 110 cards.

A third series of trading cards, &quot;Mars Attacks: Uprising&quot;, was released in 2020 exclusively through a Kickstarter campaign, with cards sent to those who donated to the campaign. Multiple artists were tapped to create multiple storylines, which generally depict counterattacking humans beginning to turn the tide against the Martian invasion.

<text>The Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer is an international treaty designed to protect the ozone layer by phasing out the production of numerous substances that are responsible for ozone depletion. It was agreed on 16 September 1987, and entered into force on 1 January 1989. Since then, it has undergone several amendments and adjustments, with revisions agreed to in 1990 (London), 1992 (Copenhagen), 1995 (Vienna), 1997 (Montreal), 1999 (Beijing), 2007 (Montreal), 2016 (Kigali) and 2018 (Quito). As a result of the international agreement, the ozone hole in Antarctica is slowly recovering. Climate projections indicate that the ozone layer will return to 1980 levels between 2040 (across much of the world) and 2066 (over Antarctica). Due to its widespread adoption and implementation, it has been hailed as an example of successful international co-operation. Former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan stated that &quot;perhaps the single most successful international agreement to date has been the Montreal Protocol&quot;. In comparison, effective burden-sharing and solution proposals mitigating regional conflicts of interest have been among the success factors for the ozone depletion challenge, where global regulation based on the Kyoto Protocol has failed to do so. In this case of the ozone depletion challenge, there was global regulation already being installed before a scientific consensus was established. Also, overall public opinion was convinced of possible imminent risks.

The ozone treaty has been ratified by 198 parties (197 states and the European Union), making it the first universally ratified treaty in United Nations history.

This truly universal treaty has also been remarkable in the expedience of the policy-making process at the global scale, where only 14 years lapsed between a basic scientific research discovery (1973) and the international agreement signed (1985 and 1987).

== Terms and purposes ==
The treaty is structured around several groups of halogenated hydrocarbons that lead to the catalytic destruction of stratospheric ozone. All of the ozone depleting substances controlled by the Montreal Protocol contain either chlorine or bromine (substances containing only fluorine do not harm the ozone layer, although they can be strong greenhouse gases). Some ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) are not yet controlled by the Montreal Protocol, including nitrous oxide (N2O). For a table of ozone-depleting substances controlled by the Montreal Protocol see:

For each group of ODSs, the treaty provides a timetable on which the production of those substances must be reduced and eventually eliminated. This includes a 10-year phase-out for developing countries identified in Article 5 of the treaty.

=== Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) Phase-out Management Plan ===

The purpose of the treaty is that each signatory states:

There was a faster phase-out of halon-1211, -2402, -1301, There was a slower phase-out (to zero by 2010) of other substances (halon 1211, 1301, 2402; CFCs 13, 111, 112, etc.) and some chemicals were given individual attention (Carbon tetrachloride; 1,1,1-trichloroethane). The phasing-out of the less damaging HCFCs only began in 1996 and will go on until a complete phasing-out is achieved by 2030.

There were a few exceptions for &quot;essential uses&quot; where no acceptable substitutes were initially found (for example, metered dose inhalers commonly used to treat asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were previously exempt) or Halon fire suppression systems used in submarines and aircraft (but not in general industry).

The substances in Group I of Annex A are:

* CFCl3 (CFC-11)
* CF2Cl2 (CFC-12)
* C2F3Cl3 (CFC-113)
* C2F4Cl2(CFC-114)
* C2F5Cl (CFC-115)

The provisions of the Protocol include the requirement that the Parties to the Protocol base their future decisions on the current scientific, environmental, technical, and economic information that is assessed through panels drawn from the worldwide expert communities. To provide that input to the decision-making process, advances in understanding on these topics were assessed in 1989, 1991, 1994, 1998 and 2002 in a series of reports entitled Scientific assessment of ozone depletion, by the Scientific Assessment Panel (SAP).

In 1990 a Technology and Economic Assessment Panel was also established as the technology and economics advisory body to the Montreal Protocol Parties. The Technology and Economic Assessment Panel (TEAP) provides, at the request of Parties, technical information related to the alternative technologies that have been investigated and employed to make it possible to virtually eliminate use of Ozone Depleting Substances (such as CFCs and Halons), that harm the ozone layer. The TEAP is also tasked by the Parties every year to assess and evaluate various technical issues including evaluating nominations for essential use exemptions for CFCs and halons, and nominations for critical use exemptions for methyl bromide. TEAP&#x27;s annual reports are a basis for the Parties&#x27; informed decision-making.

Numerous reports have been published by various inter-governmental, governmental and non-governmental organizations to catalogue and assess alternatives to the ozone depleting substances, since the substances have been used in various technical sectors, like in refrigeration, air conditioning, flexible and rigid foam, fire protection, aerospace, electronics, agriculture, and laboratory measurements.

=== Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) Phase-out Management Plan (HPMP) ===
Under the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, especially Executive Committee (ExCom) 53/37 and ExCom 54/39, Parties to this Protocol agreed to set year 2013 as the time to freeze the consumption and production of HCFCs for developing countries. For developed countries, reduction of HCFC consumption and production began in 2004 and 2010, respectively, with 100% reduction set for 2020. Developing countries agreed to start reducing its consumption and production of HCFCs by 2015, with 100% reduction set for 2030.

Hydrochlorofluorocarbons, commonly known as HCFCs, are a group of human-made compounds containing hydrogen, chlorine, fluorine and carbon. They are not found anywhere in nature. HCFC production began to take off after countries agreed to phase out the use of CFCs in the 1980s, which were found to be destroying the ozone layer. Like CFCs, HCFCs are used for refrigeration, aerosol propellants, foam manufacture and air conditioning. Unlike the CFCs, however, most HCFCs are broken down in the lowest part of the atmosphere and pose a much smaller risk to the ozone layer. Nevertheless, HCFCs are very potent greenhouse gases, despite their very low atmospheric concentrations, measured in parts per trillion (million million).

The HCFCs are transitional CFCs replacements, used as refrigerants, solvents, blowing agents for plastic foam manufacture, and fire extinguishers. In terms of ozone depletion potential (ODP), in comparison to CFCs that have ODP 0.6–1.0, these HCFCs have lower ODPs (0.01–0.5). In terms of global warming potential (GWP), in comparison to CFCs that have GWP 4,680–10,720, HCFCs have lower GWPs (76–2,270).

=== Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) ===

On 1 January 2019, the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol came into force. Under the Kigali Amendment countries promised to reduce the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) by more than 80% over the next 30 years. By 27 December 2018, 65 countries had ratified the Amendment. , 160 states and the European Union have ratified the Amendment.

Produced mostly in developed countries, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) replaced CFCs and HCFCs. HFCs pose no harm to the ozone layer because, unlike CFCs and HCFCs, they do not contain chlorine. They are, however, greenhouse gases, with a high global warming potential (GWP), comparable to that of CFCs and HCFCs. In 2009, a study calculated that a fast phasedown of high-GWP HFCs could potentially prevent the equivalent of up to 8.8 Gt -eq per year in emissions by 2050. A proposed phasedown of HFCs was hence projected to avoid up to 0.5C of warming by 2100 under the high-HFC growth scenario, and up to 0.35C under the low-HFC growth scenario. Recognizing the opportunity presented for fast and effective phasing down of HFCs through the Montreal Protocol, starting in 2009 the Federated States of Micronesia proposed an amendment to phase down high-GWP HFCs, with the U.S., Canada, and Mexico following with a similar proposal in 2010.

After seven years of negotiations, in October 2016 at the 28th Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol in Kigali, the Parties to the Montreal Protocol adopted the Kigali Amendment whereby the Parties agreed to phase down HFCs under the Montreal Protocol. The amendment to the Montreal Protocol commits the signatory parties to reduce their HFC production and consumption by at least 85 per cent from the annual average value in the period from 2011 to 2013. A group of developing countries including China, Brazil and South Africa are mandated to reduce their HFC use by 85 per cent of their average value in 2020-22 by the year 2045. India and some other developing countries – Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, and some oil economies like Saudi Arabia and Kuwait – will cut down their HFCs by 85 per cent of their values in 2024-26 by the year 2047.

On 17 November 2017, ahead of the 29th Meeting of the Parties of the Montreal Protocol, Sweden became the 20th Party to ratify the Kigali Amendment, pushing the Amendment over its ratification threshold ensuring that the Amendment would enter into force 1 January 2019.

==History==

In the 1970s, the chemists Frank Sherwood Rowland and Mario Molina, who were then at the University of California, Irvine, began studying the impacts of CFCs in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. They discovered that CFC molecules were stable enough to remain in the atmosphere until they got up into the middle of the stratosphere where they would finally (after an average of 50–100 years for two common CFCs) be broken down by ultraviolet radiation releasing a chlorine atom. Rowland and Molina then proposed that these chlorine atoms might be expected to cause the breakdown of large amounts of ozone (O3) in the stratosphere. Their argument was based upon an analogy to contemporary work by Paul J. Crutzen and Harold Johnston, which had shown that nitric oxide (NO) could catalyze the destruction of ozone. (Several other scientists, including Ralph Cicerone, Richard Stolarski, Michael McElroy, and Steven Wofsy had independently proposed that chlorine could catalyze ozone loss, but none had realized that CFCs were a potentially large source of chlorine.) Crutzen, Molina and Rowland were awarded the 1995 Nobel Prize for Chemistry for their work on this problem.

The environmental consequence of this discovery was that, since stratospheric ozone absorbs most of the ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation reaching the surface of the planet, depletion of the ozone layer by CFCs would lead to an increase in UV-B radiation at the surface, resulting in an increase in skin cancer and other impacts such as damage to crops and to marine phytoplankton.

The Rowland-Molina hypothesis was strongly disputed by representatives of the aerosol and halocarbon industries. The chair of the board of DuPont was quoted as saying that ozone depletion theory is &quot;a science fiction tale...a load of rubbish...utter nonsense&quot;. Robert Abplanalp, the president of Precision Valve Corporation (and inventor of the first practical aerosol spray can valve), wrote to the Chancellor of UC Irvine to complain about Rowland&#x27;s public statements (Roan, p. 56.)

After publishing their pivotal paper in June 1974, Rowland and Molina testified at a
hearing before the U.S. House of Representatives in December 1974. As a result, significant funding was made available to study various aspects of the problem and to confirm the initial findings. In 1976, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences (NAS) released a report that confirmed the scientific credibility of the ozone depletion hypothesis. NAS continued to publish assessments of related science for the next decade.

In 1982, representatives from 24 countries met in Stockholm, Sweden to decide on a &quot;Global Framework Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer.&quot; The following year, a group of countries, including the United States, Canada, the Nordic Countries, and Switzerland, proposed a worldwide ban on &quot;nonessential&quot; uses of CFCs in spray cans.

Then, in 1985, British Antarctic Survey scientists Joe Farman, Brian Gardiner and Jon Shanklin published results of abnormally low ozone concentrations above Halley Bay near the South Pole. They speculated that this was connected to increased levels of CFCs in the atmosphere. It took several other attempts to establish the Antarctic losses as real and significant, especially after NASA had retrieved matching data from its satellite recordings. This unforeseen phenomenon in the Antarctic, as well as NASA&#x27;s scientific images of the ozone hole played an important role in the Montreal Protocol negotiations. The impact of these studies, the metaphor &#x27;ozone hole&#x27;, and the colorful visual representation in a time lapse animation proved shocking enough for negotiators in Montreal, Canada to take the issue seriously.
Also in 1985, 20 nations, including most of the major CFC producers, signed the Vienna Convention, which established a framework for negotiating international regulations on ozone-depleting substances. After the discovery of the ozone hole 
by SAGE 2 it only took 18 months to reach a binding agreement in Montreal, Canada. Mostafa Kamal Tolba, the head of the UNEP at the time, was considered the &quot;father of the Montreal Protocol&quot; for his role in bringing the nations together for an agreement.

In 1986, an assessment spearheaded by NASA and sponsored by the United Nationals Environment Program, the World Meteorological Organization, and various other organizations concluded that continued CFC emissions at the 1980 rate would &quot;reduce global average ozone by about 9 percent by the latter half of the century.&quot; Based on these figures, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimated that in the United States alone there could be &quot;over 150 million new cases of skin cancer among people currently alive and born by the year 2075, resulting in over 3 million deaths.&quot;

The CFC industry continued pushing back against regulation as late as 1986, when the Alliance for Responsible CFC Policy (an association representing the CFC industry founded by DuPont) was still arguing that the science was too uncertain to justify any action. In 1987, DuPont testified before the US Congress that &quot;We believe there is no imminent crisis that demands unilateral regulation.&quot; And even in March 1988, Du Pont Chair Richard E. Heckert would write in a letter to the United States Senate, &quot;we will not produce a product unless it can be made, used, handled and disposed of safely and consistent with appropriate safety, health and environmental quality criteria. At the moment, scientific evidence does not point to the need for dramatic CFC emission reductions. There is no available measure of the contribution of CFCs to any observed ozone change...&quot;

In an unexpected policy change, however, the Alliance for Responsible CFC Policy issued a statement in 1986 declaring that &quot;large future increases...in CFCs...would be unacceptable to future generations,&quot; and that it would be &quot;inconsistent with [industry] goals...to ignore the potential for risk to future generations.&quot; Three months before the protocol negotiations began, U.S. industry announced its support for new international controls on CFCs.

==Multilateral Fund==

The main objective of the &quot;Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol&quot; is to assist developing country parties to the Montreal Protocol whose annual per capita consumption and production of ozone depleting substances (ODS) is less than 0.3 kg to comply with the control measures of the Protocol. Currently, 147 of the 196 Parties to the Montreal Protocol meet these criteria (they are referred to as Article 5 countries).

It embodies the principle agreed at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in 1992 that countries have a common but differentiated responsibility to protect and manage the global commons.

The Fund is managed by an executive committee with an equal representation of seven industrialized and seven Article 5 countries, which are elected annually by a Meeting of the Parties. The Committee reports annually to the Meeting of the Parties on its operations. The work of the Multilateral Fund on the ground in developing countries is carried out by four Implementing Agencies, which have contractual agreements with the executive committee:

* United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), through its OzonAction Programme.
* United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
* United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO).
* World Bank.

Up to 20 percent of the contributions of contributing parties can also be delivered through their bilateral agencies in the form of eligible projects and activities.

The fund is replenished on a three-year basis by the donors. Pledges amount to US$3.1 billion over the period 1991 to 2005. Funds are used, for example, to finance the conversion of existing manufacturing processes, train personnel, pay royalties and patent rights on new technologies, and establish national ozone offices.

== Parties ==
As of October 2022, all Member States of the United Nations, the Cook Islands, Niue, the Holy See, the State of Palestine as well as the European Union have ratified the original Montreal Protocol (see external link below), with the State of Palestine being the last party to ratify the agreement, bringing the total to 198. 197 of those parties (with the exception of the State of Palestine) have also ratified the London, Copenhagen, Montreal, and Beijing amendments.

== Effect ==

Since the Montreal Protocol came into effect, the atmospheric concentrations of the most important chlorofluorocarbons and related chlorinated hydrocarbons have either leveled off or decreased. Halon concentrations have continued to increase, as the halons presently stored in fire extinguishers are released, but their rate of increase has slowed and their abundances are expected to begin to decline by about 2020. Also, the concentration of the HCFCs increased drastically at least partly because of many uses (e.g. used as solvents or refrigerating agents) CFCs were substituted with HCFCs. While there have been reports of attempts by individuals to circumvent the ban, e.g. by smuggling CFCs from undeveloped to developed nations, the overall level of compliance has been high. Statistical analysis from 2010 show a clear positive signal from the Montreal Protocol to the stratospheric ozone. In consequence, the Montreal Protocol has often been called the most successful international environmental agreement to date. In a 2001 report, NASA found the ozone thinning over Antarctica had remained the same thickness for the previous three years, however in 2003 the ozone hole grew to its second largest size. The most recent (2006) scientific evaluation of the effects of the Montreal Protocol states, &quot;The Montreal Protocol is working: There is clear evidence of a decrease in the atmospheric burden of ozone-depleting substances and some early signs of stratospheric ozone recovery.&quot; However, a more recent study seems to point to a relative increase in CFCs due to an unknown source.

Reported in 1997, significant production of CFCs occurred in Russia for sale on the black market to the EU throughout the 90s. Related US production and consumption was enabled by fraudulent reporting due to poor enforcement mechanisms. Similar illegal markets for CFCs were detected in Taiwan, Korea, and Hong Kong.

The Montreal Protocol is also expected to have effects on human health. A 2015 report by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that the protection of the ozone layer under the treaty will prevent over 280 million cases of skin cancer, 1.5 million skin cancer deaths, and 45 million cataracts in the United States.

However, the hydrochlorofluorocarbons, or HCFCs, and hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, contribute to anthropogenic global warming. On a molecule-for-molecule basis, these compounds are up to 10,000 times more potent greenhouse gases than carbon dioxide. The Montreal Protocol currently calls for a complete phase-out of HCFCs by 2030, but does not place any restriction on HFCs. Since the CFCs themselves are equally powerful greenhouse gases, the mere substitution of HFCs for CFCs does not significantly increase the rate of anthropogenic climate change, but over time a steady increase in their use could increase the danger that human activity will change the climate.

Policy experts have advocated for increased efforts to link ozone protection efforts to climate protection efforts. Policy decisions in one arena affect the costs and effectiveness of environmental improvements in the other.

=== Regional detections of non-compliance ===

In 2018, scientists monitoring the atmosphere following the 2010 phaseout date reported evidence of continuing industrial production of CFC-11, likely in eastern Asia, with detrimental global effects on the ozone layer. A monitoring study detected fresh atmospheric releases of carbon tetrachloride from China&#x27;s Shandong province, beginning sometime after 2012, and accounting for a large part of emissions exceeding global estimates under the Montreal Protocol.

== 25th anniversary celebrations ==
The year 2012 marked the 25th anniversary of the signing of the Montreal Protocol. Accordingly, the Montreal Protocol community organized a range of celebrations at the national, regional and international levels to publicize its considerable success to date and to consider the work ahead for the future.
Among its accomplishments are: 
*The Montreal Protocol was the first international treaty to address a global environmental regulatory challenge; 
*the first to embrace the &quot;precautionary principle&quot; in its design for science-based policymaking; 
*the first treaty where independent experts on atmospheric science, environmental impacts, chemical technology, and economics, reported directly to parties, without edit or censorship, functioning under norms of professionalism, peer review, and respect; 
*the first to provide for national differences in responsibility and financial capacity to respond by establishing a multilateral fund for technology transfer; the first MEA with stringent reporting, trade, and binding chemical phase-out obligations for both developed and developing countries; and, 
*the first treaty with a financial mechanism managed democratically by an executive board with equal representation by developed and developing countries.

Within 25 years of signing, parties to the MP celebrate significant milestones. Significantly, the world has phased-out 98% of the Ozone-Depleting Substances (ODS) contained in nearly 100 hazardous chemicals worldwide; every country is in compliance with stringent obligations; and, the MP has achieved the status of the first global regime with universal ratification; even the newest member state, South Sudan, ratified in 2013. UNEP received accolades for achieving global consensus that &quot;demonstrates the world’s commitment to ozone protection, and more broadly, to global environmental protection&quot;.

<text>Moncton (; ) is the most populous city in the Canadian province of New Brunswick. Situated in the Petitcodiac River Valley, Moncton lies at the geographic centre of the Maritime Provinces. The city has earned the nickname &quot;Hub City&quot; because of its central inland location in the region and its history as a railway and land transportation hub for the Maritimes. As of the 2021 Census, the city had a population of 79,470. The metropolitan population in 2022 was 171,608, making it the fastest growing CMA in Canada for the year with a growth rate of 5.3%. Its land area is .

Although the Moncton area was first settled in 1733, Moncton was officially founded in 1766 with the arrival of Pennsylvania German immigrants from Philadelphia. Initially an agricultural settlement, Moncton was not incorporated until 1855. It was named for Lt. Col. Robert Monckton, the British officer who had captured nearby Fort Beauséjour a century earlier. A significant wooden shipbuilding industry had developed in the community by the mid-1840s, allowing for the civic incorporation in 1855. But the shipbuilding economy collapsed in the 1860s, causing the town to lose its civic charter in 1862. Moncton regained its charter in 1875 after the community&#x27;s economy rebounded, mainly due to a growing railway industry. In 1871, the Intercolonial Railway of Canada chose Moncton as its headquarters, and Moncton remained a railway town for well over a century until the Canadian National Railway (CNR) locomotive shops closed in the late 1980s.

Although Moncton&#x27;s economy was traumatized twice—by the collapse of the shipbuilding industry in the 1860s and by the closure of the CNR locomotive shops in the 1980s—the city was able to rebound strongly on both occasions. It adopted the motto &quot;Resurgo&quot; (Latin: &quot;I rise again&quot;) after its rebirth as a railway town. Its economy is stable and diversified, primarily based on its traditional transportation, distribution, retailing, and commercial heritage, and supplemented by strength in the educational, health care, financial, information technology, and insurance sectors. The strength of Moncton&#x27;s economy has received national recognition and the local unemployment rate is consistently less than the national average.

On 1 January 2023, Moncton annexed an area including Charles Lutes Road and Zack Road.

==History==

Acadians settled the head of the Bay of Fundy in the 1670s. The first reference to the &quot;Petcoucoyer River&quot; was on the De Meulles map of 1686. Settlement of the Petitcodiac and Memramcook river valleys began about 1700, gradually extending inland and reaching the site of present-day Moncton in 1733. The first Acadian settlers in the Moncton area established a marshland farming community and chose to name their settlement &quot;Le Coude&quot; (&quot;The Elbow&quot;), an allusion to the 90° bend in the river near the site of the settlement.

In 1755, nearby Fort Beauséjour was captured by British forces under the command of Lt. Col. Robert Monckton. The Beaubassin region including the Memramcook and Petitcodiac river valleys subsequently fell under English control. Later that year, Governor Charles Lawrence issued a decree ordering the expulsion of the Acadian population from Nova Scotia (including recently captured areas of Acadia such as Le Coude). This action came to be known as the &quot;Great Upheaval&quot;.

The reaches of the upper Petitcodiac River valley then came under the control of the Philadelphia Land Company (one of the principals of which was Benjamin Franklin.) In 1766, Pennsylvania German settlers arrived to reestablish the preexisting farming community at Le Coude. The Settlers consisted of eight families: Heinrich Stief (Steeves), Jacob Treitz (Trites), Matthias Sommer (Somers), Jacob Reicker (Ricker), Charles Jones (Schantz), George Wortmann (Wortman), Michael Lutz (Lutes), and George Koppel (Copple). There is a plaque dedicated in their honour at the mouth of Hall&#x27;s Creek. They renamed the settlement &quot;The Bend&quot;. The Bend remained an agricultural settlement for nearly 80 more years. Even by 1836, there were only 20 households in the community. At that time, the Westmorland Road became open to year-round travel and a regular mail coach service was established between Saint John and Halifax. The Bend became an important transfer and rest station along the route. Over the next decade, lumbering and then shipbuilding became important industries in the area.

The community&#x27;s turning point came when Joseph Salter took over (and expanded) a shipyard at the Bend in 1847. The shipyard grew to employ about 400 workers. The Bend subsequently developed a service-based economy to support the shipyard and gradually began to acquire all the amenities of a growing town. The prosperity engendered by the wooden shipbuilding industry allowed The Bend to incorporate as the town of Moncton in 1855. Although the town was named for Monckton, a clerical error at the time the town was incorporated resulted in the misspelling of its name, which has remained to the present day. Moncton&#x27;s first mayor was the shipbuilder Joseph Salter.

In 1857, the European and North American Railway opened its line from Moncton to nearby Shediac. This was followed in 1859 by a line from Moncton to Saint John. At about the time of the railway&#x27;s arrival, the popularity of steam-powered ships forced an end to the era of wooden shipbuilding. The Salter shipyard closed in 1858. The resulting industrial collapse caused Moncton to surrender its civic charter in 1862.

Moncton&#x27;s economic depression did not last long; a second era of prosperity came to the area in 1871, when Moncton was selected to be the headquarters of the Intercolonial Railway of Canada (ICR). The arrival of the ICR in Moncton was a seminal event for the community. For the next 120 years, the history of the city was firmly linked with the railway&#x27;s. In 1875, Moncton reincorporated as a town, and a year later, the ICR line to Quebec opened. The railway boom that emanated from this and the associated employment growth allowed Moncton to achieve city status on April 23, 1890.
Moncton grew rapidly during the early 20th century, particularly after provincial lobbying helped the city become the eastern terminus of the massive National Transcontinental Railway project in 1912. In 1918, the federal government merged the ICR and the National Transcontinental Railway (NTR) into the newly formed Canadian National Railways (CNR) system. The ICR shops became CNR&#x27;s major locomotive repair facility for the Maritimes and Moncton became the headquarters for CNR&#x27;s Maritime division. The T. Eaton Company&#x27;s catalogue warehouse moved to the city in the early 1920s, employing over 700 people. Transportation and distribution became increasingly important to Moncton&#x27;s economy in the mid-20th century. The first scheduled air service out of Moncton was established in 1928. During the Second World War, the Canadian Army built a large military supply base in the city to service the Maritime military establishment. The CNR continued to dominate the economy of the city; railway employment in Moncton peaked at nearly 6,000 workers in the 1950s before beginning a slow decline.

Moncton was placed on the Trans-Canada Highway network in the early 1960s after Route 2 was built along the city&#x27;s northern perimeter. Later, the Route 15 was built between the city and Shediac. At the same time, the Petitcodiac River Causeway was constructed. The Université de Moncton was founded in 1963 and became an important resource in the development of Acadian culture in the area.

The late 1970s and the 1980s were a period of economic hardship for the city as several major employers closed or restructured. The Eatons catalogue division, CNR&#x27;s locomotive shops facility and CFB Moncton closed during this time, throwing thousands of citizens out of work.

The city diversified in the early 1990s with the rise of information technology, led by call centres that made use of the city&#x27;s bilingual workforce. By the late 1990s, retail, manufacturing and service expansion began to occur in all sectors and within a decade of the closure of the CNR locomotive shops Moncton had more than made up for its employment losses. This dramatic turnaround in the city&#x27;s fortunes has been termed the &quot;Moncton Miracle&quot;.

The community&#x27;s growth has accelerated since the 1990s. The confidence of the community has been bolstered by its ability to host major events such as the Francophonie Summit in 1999, a Rolling Stones concert in 2005, the Memorial Cup in 2006, and both the IAAF World Junior Championships in Athletics and a neutral site regular season CFL football game in 2010. Positive developments include the Atlantic Baptist University (later renamed Crandall University) achieving full university status and relocating to a new campus in 1996, the Greater Moncton Roméo LeBlanc International Airport opening a new terminal building and becoming a designated international airport in 2002, and the opening of the new Gunningsville Bridge to Riverview in 2005. In 2002, Moncton became Canada&#x27;s first officially bilingual city. In the 2006 census, it was designated a Census Metropolitan Area and became New Brunswick&#x27;s largest metropolitan area.

==Geography==

Moncton lies in southeastern New Brunswick, at the geographic centre of the Maritime Provinces. The city is along the north bank of the Petitcodiac River at a point where the river bends acutely from west−east to north−south flow. This geographical feature has contributed significantly to historical names for the community. &quot;Petitcodiac&quot; in the Mi&#x27;kmaq language has been translated as &quot;bends like a bow&quot;. The early Acadian settlers in the region named their community &quot;Le Coude&quot; (&quot;the elbow&quot;). Subsequent English immigrants changed the settlement&#x27;s name to The Bend of the Petitcodiac (or simply &quot;The Bend&quot;).

The Petitcodiac river valley at Moncton is broad and relatively flat, bounded by a long ridge to the north (Lutes Mountain) and by the rugged Caledonia Highlands to the south. Moncton lies at the original head of navigation on the river, but a causeway to Riverview (constructed in 1968) resulted in extensive sedimentation of the river channel downstream and rendered the Moncton area of the waterway unnavigable. On April 14, 2010, the causeway gates were opened in an effort to restore the silt-laden river.

===Tidal bore===

The Petitcodiac River exhibits one of North America&#x27;s few tidal bores: a regularly occurring wave that travels up the river on the leading edge of the incoming tide. The bore is a result of the Bay of Fundy&#x27;s extreme tides. Originally, the bore was very impressive, sometimes between high and extending across the width of the Petitcodiac River in the Moncton area. This wave occurred twice a day at high tide, travelling at an average speed of and producing an audible roar. Unsurprisingly, the &quot;bore&quot; became a very popular early tourist attraction for the city, but when the Petitcodiac causeway was built in the 1960s, the river channel quickly silted in and reduced the bore so that it rarely exceeded in height. On April 14, 2010, the causeway gates were opened in an effort to restore the silt-laden river. A recent tidal bore since the opening of the causeway gates measured a wave, unseen for many years.

===Climate===

Despite being less than from the Bay of Fundy and less than from the Northumberland Strait, the climate tends to be more continental than maritime during the summer and winter seasons, with maritime influences somewhat tempering the transitional seasons of spring and autumn.

Moncton has a warm summer humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;) with uniform precipitation distribution. Winter days are typically cold but sunny, with solar radiation generating some warmth. Daytime high temperatures usually range a few degrees below the freezing point. Major snowfalls can result from Nor&#x27;easter ocean storms moving up the east coast of North America. These major snowfalls typically average 20–30 cm (8–12 in) and are frequently mixed with rain or freezing rain. Spring is often delayed because the sea ice that forms in the nearby Gulf of St. Lawrence during the winter requires time to melt, and this cools onshore winds, which can extend inland as far as Moncton. The ice burden in the gulf has diminished considerably over the last decade, and the springtime cooling effect has weakened as a result. Daytime temperatures above freezing are typical by late February. Trees are usually in full leaf by May. Summers are warm, sometimes hot, and can be somewhat humid due to the seasonal prevailing westerly winds strengthening the climate&#x27;s continental tendencies. Daytime highs sometimes reach more than 30 °C (86 °F). Rainfall is generally modest, especially in late July and August, and short periods of drought occur on occasion. Autumn daytime temperatures remain mild until late October. First snowfalls usually do not occur until late November and consistent snow cover on the ground does not happen until late December. New Brunswick&#x27;s Fundy coast occasionally experiences the effects of post-tropical storms. The stormiest weather of the year, with the greatest precipitation and the strongest winds, usually occurs during the fall/winter transition (November to mid-January).

The highest temperature ever recorded in Moncton was on August 18 and 19, 1935. The coldest ever recorded was on February 5, 1948.


==Cityscape==
Moncton generally remains a &quot;low rise&quot; city, but its skyline encompasses buildings and structures with varying architectural styles from many periods. The city&#x27;s most dominant structure is the Bell Aliant Tower, a microwave communications tower built in 1971. When it was constructed, it was the tallest microwave communications tower of its kind in North America. It remains the tallest structure in Moncton, dwarfing the neighbouring Place L&#x27;Assomption by . Indeed, the Bell Aliant Tower is also the tallest free-standing structure in all four Atlantic provinces. Assumption Place is a 20-story office building and the headquarters of Assumption Mutual Life Insurance. This building is tall and tied with Brunswick Square (Saint John) as the tallest building in the province. The Blue Cross Centre is a nine-story building in Downtown Moncton. It is architecturally distinctive, encompasses a full city block, and is the city&#x27;s largest office building by square footage. It is the home of Medavie Blue Cross and the Moncton Public Library. There are about a half dozen other buildings in Moncton between eight and 12 stories, including the Delta Beausejour and Brunswick Crowne Plaza Hotels and the Terminal Plaza office complex.
===Urban parks===
The most popular park in the area is Centennial Park which has lighted cross country skiing and hiking trails, the city&#x27;s largest playground, lawn bowling and tennis facilities, a boating pond, a treetop adventure course, and Rocky Stone Field, a city owned 2,500 seat football stadium with artificial turf, and home to the Moncton Minor Football Association. The city&#x27;s other main parks are Mapleton Park in the city&#x27;s north end, Irishtown Nature Park (one of the largest urban nature parks in Canada) and St. Anselme Park (located in Dieppe). The numerous neighbourhood parks throughout the metro Moncton area include Bore View Park (which overlooks the Petitcodiac River), and the downtown Victoria Park, which features a bandshell, flower gardens, fountain, and the city&#x27;s cenotaph. There is an extensive system of hiking and biking trails in Metro Moncton. The Riverfront Trail is part of the Trans Canada Trail system, and various monuments and pavilions can be found along its length.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the City of Moncton had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

Moncton&#x27;s urban area (&quot;population centre&quot;) had a population of living in an area of . Residents lived in 51,830 dwellings out of the 54,519 total private dwellings.

Greater Moncton, the Census Metropolitan Area (CMA), had a population of living in of its total private dwellings; a change of from its 2016 population of . The CMA includes the neighbouring city of Dieppe and the town of Riverview, as well as adjacent suburban areas in Westmorland and Albert counties. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

Moncton&#x27;s urban area is the third largest in Atlantic Canada, after Halifax, Nova Scotia, and St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador, and the second largest in The Maritimes.

In 2016, the median age in Moncton was 41.4, close to the national median age of 41.2.

The 2021 census reported that immigrants (individuals born outside Canada) comprise 8,460 persons or 10.9% of the total population of Moncton. Of the total immigrant population, the top countries of origin were Philippines (795 persons or 9.4%), India (655 persons or 7.7%), United States of America (555 persons or 6.6%), China (475 persons or 5.6%), Nigeria (470 persons or 5.6%), United Kingdom (395 persons or 4.7%), Syria (385 persons or 4.6%), South Korea (380 persons or 4.5%), France (290 persons or 3.4%), and Democratic Republic of the Congo (270 persons or 3.2%).

=== Ethnicity ===
As of 2021, approximately 82.4% of Moncton&#x27;s residents were of European ancestry, while 14.9% were visible minorities and 2.7% were Indigenous. The largest ethnic minority groups in Moncton were Black (5.3%), South Asian (3.0%), Arab (1.5%), Filipino (1.3%), Chinese (0.9%), Southeast Asian (0.8%), Korean (0.7%), and Latin American (0.7%).

=== Language ===

Moncton is a bilingual city, 58.5% of its residents having English as their mother tongue, while 27.3% have French, 2.9% learned both English and French as a first language, and 10.8% speak another language as their mother tongue. About 46% of the city population is bilingual and understands both English and French; the only other Canadian cities that approach this level of linguistic duality are Ottawa, Sudbury, and Montreal. Moncton became the first officially bilingual city in the country in 2002. This means that all municipal services, as well as public notices and information, are available in both French and English. The adjacent city of Dieppe is about 64% Francophone and has benefited from an ongoing rural depopulation of the Acadian Peninsula and areas in northern and eastern New Brunswick. The town of Riverview meanwhile is heavily (95%) Anglophone.

A total of 67% of its residents are fluent in English and 47% are fluent in French.

Common non-official languages spoken as mother tongues are Arabic (1.4%), Punjabi (0.7%), Chinese (0.7%), Tagalog (0.6%), Korean (0.6%), Spanish (0.6%), Vietnamese (0.5%), and Portuguese (0.5%). 1.2% of residents listed both English and a non-official language as mother tongues, while 0.4% listed both French and a non-official language.

*Buddhism (180 persons or 0.2%)
*Indigenous Spirituality (10 persons or &lt;0.1%)
*Other (660 persons or 0.9%)

==Economy==

The underpinnings of the local economy are based on Moncton&#x27;s heritage as a commercial, distribution, transportation, and retailing centre. This is due to Moncton&#x27;s central location in the Maritimes: it has the largest catchment area in Atlantic Canada with 1.6 million people living within a three-hour drive of the city. The insurance, information technology, educational, and health care sectors also are major factors in the local economy with the city&#x27;s two hospitals alone employing over five thousand people, along with a growing high tech sector that includes companies such as Nanoptix, International Game Technology, OAO Technology Solutions, BMM Test Labs, TrustMe, and BelTek Systems Design.

Moncton has garnered national attention because of the strength of its economy. The local unemployment rate averages around 6%, which is below the national average. In 2004 &quot;Canadian Business&quot; magazine named it &quot;The best city for business in Canada&quot;, and in 2007 FDi magazine named it the fifth most business-friendly small-sized city in North America.

Moncton&#x27;s high proportion of bilingual workers and its status as border-city between majority francophone and majority anglophone areas makes it an attractive centre for both federal employment and the stationing of call-centres for Canadian companies (who provide services in both languages). The city is home to the regional head offices for several Canadian federal agencies such as Correctional Service Canada, Transport Canada, the Gulf Fisheries Centre and the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency. There are 37 call centres in the city which employ over 5,000 people. Some of the larger centres include Asurion, Numeris, ExxonMobil, Royal Bank of Canada, Tangerine Bank, UPS, Fairmont Hotels &amp; Resorts, Rogers Communications and Nordia Inc.

A number of nationally or regionally prominent corporations have their head offices in Moncton including Atlantic Lottery Corporation, Assumption Life Insurance, Medavie Blue Cross Insurance, Armour Transportation Systems and Major Drilling Group International. TD Bank announced in 2018 a new banking services centre to be located in Moncton which will employ over 1,000 people (including a previously announced customer contact centre). Meanwhile, several arms of the Irving corporation have their head offices and/or major operations in greater Moncton. These include Midland Transport, Majesta/Royale Tissues, Irving Personal Care, Master Packaging, Brunswick News, and Cavendish Farms. Kent Building Supplies (an Irving subsidiary) opened their main distribution centre in the Caledonia Industrial Park in 2014. The Irving group of companies employs several thousand people in the Moncton region.

There are three large industrial parks in the metropolitan area. The Irving operations are concentrated in the Dieppe Industrial Park. The Moncton Industrial Park in the city&#x27;s west end has been expanded. Molson Coors opened a brewery in the Caledonia Industrial Park in 2007, its first new brewery in over fifty years. All three industrial parks also have large concentrations of warehousing and regional trucking facilities.

A new four-lane Gunningsville Bridge was opened in 2005, connecting downtown Riverview directly with downtown Moncton. On the Moncton side, the bridge connects with an extension of Vaughan Harvey Boulevard as well as to Assumption Boulevard and will serve as a catalyst for economic growth in the downtown area. This has become already evident as an expansion to the Blue Cross Centre was completed in 2006 and a Marriott Residence Inn opened in 2008. The new regional law courts on Assumption Blvd opened in 2011. A new 8,800 seat downtown arena (the Avenir Centre) recently opened in September 2018. On the Riverview side, the Gunningsville Bridge now connects to a new ring road around the town and is expected to serve as a catalyst for development in east Riverview.

The retail sector in Moncton has become one of the most important pillars of the local economy. Major retail projects such as Champlain Place in Dieppe and the Wheeler Park Power Centre on Trinity Drive have become major destinations for locals and for tourists alike.
Tourism is an important industry in Moncton and historically owes its origins to the presence of two natural attractions, the tidal bore of the Petitcodiac River (see above) and the optical illusion of Magnetic Hill. The tidal bore was the first phenomenon to become an attraction but the construction of the Petitcodiac causeway in the 1960s effectively extirpated the attraction. Magnetic Hill, on the city&#x27;s northwest outskirts, is the city&#x27;s most famous attraction. The Magnetic Hill area includes (in addition to the phenomenon itself), a golf course, major water park, zoo, and an outdoor concert facility. A $90 million casino/hotel/entertainment complex opened at Magnetic Hill in 2010.

==Culture==

Moncton&#x27;s Capitol Theatre, an 800-seat restored 1920s-era vaudeville house on Main Street, is the main centre for cultural entertainment for the city. The theatre hosts a performing arts series and provides a venue for various theatrical performances as well as Symphony New Brunswick and the Atlantic Ballet Theatre of Canada. The adjacent Empress Theatre offers space for smaller performances and recitals. The Molson Canadian Centre at Casino New Brunswick provides a 2,000-seat venue for major touring artists and performing groups.

The Moncton-based Atlantic Ballet Theatre tours mainly in Atlantic Canada but also tours nationally and internationally on occasion. Théâtre l&#x27;Escaouette is a Francophone live theatre company which has its own auditorium and performance space on Botsford Street. The Anglophone Live Bait Theatre is based in the nearby university town of Sackville. There are several private dance and music academies in the metropolitan area, including the Capitol Theatre&#x27;s own performing arts school.

The Aberdeen Cultural Centre is a major Acadian cultural cooperative containing multiple studios and galleries. Among other tenants, the centre houses the Galerie Sans Nom, the principal private art gallery in the city.

The city&#x27;s two main museums are the Moncton Museum at Resurgo Place on Mountain Road and the Musée acadien at Université de Moncton. The Moncton Museum reopened following major renovations and an expansion to include the Transportation Discovery Centre. The Discovery Centre includes many hands on exhibits highlighting the city&#x27;s transportation heritage. The city also has several recognized historical sites. The Free Meeting House was built in 1821 and is a New England–style meeting house located adjacent to the Moncton Museum. The Thomas Williams House, a former home of a city industrialist built in 1883, is now maintained in period style and serves as a genealogical research centre and is also home to several multicultural organizations. The Treitz Haus is located on the riverfront adjacent to Bore View Park and has been dated to 1769 both by architectural style and by dendrochronology. It is the only surviving building from the Pennsylvania Dutch era and is the oldest surviving building in the province of New Brunswick.

In film production, the city has since 1974 been home to the National Film Board of Canada&#x27;s French-language Studio Acadie.

Moncton is home to the Frye Festival, an annual bilingual literary celebration held in honour of world-renowned literary critic and favourite son Northrop Frye. This event attracts noted writers and poets from around the world and takes place in the month of April.

The Atlantic Nationals Automotive Extravaganza, held each July, is the largest annual gathering of classic cars in Canada. Other notable events include The Atlantic Seafood Festival in August, The HubCap Comedy Festival, and the World Wine Festival, both held in the spring.

Our Lady of the Assumption Cathedral is the location of an interpretation centre, Monument for Recognition in the 21st century (MR21).

==Sports==
===Facilities===

The Avenir Centre is an 8,800-seat arena which serves as a venue for major concerts and sporting events and is the home of the Moncton Wildcats of the Quebec Maritimes Junior Hockey League and the Moncton Magic of the National Basketball League of Canada. The CN Sportplex is a major recreational facility which has been built on the former CN Shops property. It includes ten ballfields, six soccer fields, an indoor rink complex with four ice surfaces (the Superior Propane Centre) and the Hollis Wealth Sports Dome, an indoor air supported multi-use building. The Sports Dome is large enough to allow for year-round football, soccer and golf activities. A newly constructed YMCA near the CN Sportsplex has extensive cardio and weight training facilities, as well as three indoor pools. The CEPS at Université de Moncton contains an indoor track and a swimming pool with diving towers. The new Moncton Stadium, also located at the U de M campus was built for the 2010 IAAF World Junior Track &amp; Field Championships. It has a permanent seating for 10,000, but is expandable to a capacity of over 20,000 for events such as professional Canadian football. The only velodrome in Atlantic Canada is in Dieppe. It has since been closed after 17 years of existence due to safety concerns in May 2018. The metro area has a total of 12 indoor hockey rinks and one curling club, Curl Moncton. Other public sporting and recreational facilities are scattered throughout the metropolitan area, including a new $18 million aquatic centre in Dieppe opened in 2009.

===Sports teams===
The Moncton Wildcats play major junior hockey in the Quebec Maritimes Junior Hockey League (QMJHL). They won the President&#x27;s Cup, the QMJHL championship in both 2006 and 2010. Historically there has been a longstanding presence of a Moncton-based team in the Maritime Junior A Hockey League, but the Dieppe Commandos (formerly known as the Moncton Beavers) relocated to Edmundston at the end of the 2017 season. Historically, Moncton also was home to a professional American Hockey League franchise from 1978 to 1994. The New Brunswick Hawks won the AHL Calder Cup by defeating the Binghamton Whalers in 1981–1982. The Moncton Mets played baseball in the New Brunswick Senior Baseball League and won the Canadian Senior Baseball Championship in 2006. In 2015, the Moncton Fisher Cats began play in the New Brunswick Senior Baseball League. They were formed by a merger between the Moncton Mets and the Hub City Brewers of the NBSBL. In 2011, the Moncton Miracles began play as one of the seven charter franchises of the professional National Basketball League of Canada. The franchise failed at the end of the 2016/17 season, to be immediately replaced by a new NBL franchise, the Moncton Magic, who played their inaugural season in 2017/18. The Universite de Moncton has a number of active CIS university sports programs including hockey, soccer, and volleyball. These teams are a part of the Canadian Interuniversity Sport program.

===Major events===
Moncton has hosted many large entertainment and sporting events. The 2006 Memorial Cup was held in Moncton with the hometown Moncton Wildcats losing in the championship final to rival Quebec Remparts. Moncton hosted the Canadian Interuniversity Sports (CIS) Men&#x27;s University Hockey Championship in 2007 and 2008. The World Men&#x27;s Curling Championship was held in Moncton in 2009; the second time this event has taken place in the city.

Moncton also hosted the 2010 IAAF World Junior Championships in Athletics. This was the largest sporting event ever held in Atlantic Canada, with athletes from over 170 countries in attendance. The new 10,000-seat capacity Moncton Stadium was built for this event on the Université de Moncton campus. The construction of this new stadium led directly to Moncton being awarded a regular season neutral site CFL game between the Toronto Argonauts and the Edmonton Eskimos, which was held on September 26, 2010.

==Government==

The municipal government consists of a mayor and ten city councillors elected to four-year terms of office. The council is non-partisan with the mayor serving as the chairman, casting a ballot only in cases of a tie vote. There are four wards electing two councillors each with an additional two councillors selected at large by the general electorate. Day-to-day operation of the city is under the control of a City Manager.

Moncton is in the federal riding of Moncton—Riverview—Dieppe. Portions of Dieppe are in the federal riding of Beauséjour, and portions of Riverview are in the riding of Fundy Royal. In the current federal parliament, two MPs from the metropolitan area belong to the Liberal Party and one to the Conservative Party.


===Military===
Aside from locally formed militia units, the military did not have a significant presence in the Moncton area until the beginning of the Second World War. In 1940, a large military supply base (later known as CFB Moncton) was constructed on a railway spur line north of downtown next to the CNR shops. This base served as the main supply depot for the large wartime military establishment in the Maritimes. In addition, two British Commonwealth Air Training Plan bases were also built in the Moncton area during the war: No. 8 Service Flying Training School, RCAF, and No. 31 Personnel Depot, RAF. The RCAF also operated No. 5 Supply Depot in Moncton. A naval listening station was also constructed in Coverdale (Riverview) in 1941 to help in coordinating radar activities in the North Atlantic. Military flight training in the Moncton area terminated at the end of World War II and the naval listening station closed in 1971. CFB Moncton remained open to supply the maritime military establishment until just after the end of the Cold War.

With the closure of CFB Moncton in the early 1990s, the military presence in Moncton has been significantly reduced. The northern portion of the former base property has been turned over to the Canada Lands Corporation and is slowly being redeveloped. The southern part of the former base remains an active DND property and is now termed the Moncton Garrison. It is affiliated with CFB Gagetown. Resident components of the garrison include the 1 Engineer Support Unit (Regular force). The garrison also houses the 37 Canadian Brigade Group Headquarters (reserve force) and one of the 37 Brigades constituent units; the 8th Canadian Hussars (Princess Louise&#x27;s), which is an armoured reconnaissance regiment. 3 Area support unit Det Moncton, and 42 Canadian Forces Health Services Centre Det Moncton provide logistical support for the base. In 2013, the last regular forces units left the Moncton base, but the reserve units remain active and Moncton remains the 37 Canadian Brigade Unit headquarters.

==Infrastructure==
===Health facilities===
There are two major regional referral and teaching hospitals in Moncton. The Moncton Hospital has approximately 381 inpatient beds and is affiliated with Dalhousie University Medical School. It is home to the Northumberland family medicine residency training program and is a site for third and fourth year clinical training for medical students in the Dalhousie Medicine New Brunswick Training Program. The hospital hosts UNB degree programs in nursing and medical x-ray technology and professional internships in fields such as dietetics. Specialized medical services at the hospital include neurosurgery, peripheral and neuro-interventional radiology, vascular surgery, thoracic surgery, hepatobiliary surgery, orthopedics, trauma, burn unit, medical oncology, neonatal intensive care, and adolescent psychiatry. A$48 million expansion to the hospital was completed in 2009 and contains a new laboratory, ambulatory care centre, and provincial level one trauma centre. A new oncology clinic was built at the hospital and opened in late 2014. The Moncton Hospital is managed by Horizon Health Network (formerly the South East Regional Health Authority).

The Dr. Georges-L.-Dumont University Hospital Centre has about 302 beds and hosts a medical training program through the local CFMNB and distant Medical School. There are also degree programs in nursing, medical x-ray technology, medical laboratory technology and inhalotherapy which are administered by Université de Moncton. Specialized medical services include medical oncology, radiation oncology, orthopedics, vascular surgery, and nephrology. 
A cardiac cath lab is being studied for the hospital and a new PET/CT scanner has been installed. A$75 million expansion for ambulatory care, expanded surgery suites, and medical training is currently under construction. The hospital is also the location of the Atlantic Cancer Research Institute. This hospital is managed by francophone Vitalité Health Network.

The internal working languages of the hospitals are English for the Moncton Hospital (Horizon Health Network) and French for the Dumont Hospital (Vitalité). However both health networks and their hospitals are required to provide services to the public in both official languages, in accordance with the New Brunswick Official Languages Act.

==Transportation==
=== Air ===

Moncton is served by the Greater Moncton Roméo LeBlanc International Airport (YQM). It was renamed for former Canadian Governor General (and native son) Roméo LeBlanc in 2016. A new airport terminal with an international arrivals area was opened in 2002 by Queen Elizabeth II. The GMIA handles about 677,000 passengers per year, making it the second busiest airport in the Maritimes in terms of passenger volume. The GMIA is the 10th busiest airport in Canada in terms of freight. Regular scheduled destinations include Halifax, Montreal, Ottawa, and Toronto.

<text>In mathematical logic, model theory is the study of the relationship between formal theories (a collection of sentences in a formal language expressing statements about a mathematical structure), and their models (those structures in which the statements of the theory hold). The aspects investigated include the number and size of models of a theory, the relationship of different models to each other, and their interaction with the formal language itself. In particular, model theorists also investigate the sets that can be defined in a model of a theory, and the relationship of such definable sets to each other.
As a separate discipline, model theory goes back to Alfred Tarski, who first used the term &quot;Theory of Models&quot; in publication in 1954.
Since the 1970s, the subject has been shaped decisively by Saharon Shelah&#x27;s stability theory.

Compared to other areas of mathematical logic such as proof theory, model theory is often less concerned with formal rigour and closer in spirit to classical mathematics.
This has prompted the comment that &quot;if proof theory is about the sacred, then model theory is about the profane&quot;.
The applications of model theory to algebraic and Diophantine geometry reflect this proximity to classical mathematics, as they often involve an integration of algebraic and model-theoretic results and techniques. Consequently, proof theory is syntactic in nature, in contrast to model theory, which is semantic in nature.

The most prominent scholarly organization in the field of model theory is the Association for Symbolic Logic.

==Overview==

This page focuses on finitary first order model theory of infinite structures.
The relative emphasis placed on the class of models of a theory as opposed to the class of definable sets within a model fluctuated in the history of the subject, and the two directions are summarised by the pithy characterisations from 1973 and 1997 respectively:

:model theory = universal algebra + logic

where universal algebra stands for mathematical structures and logic for logical theories; and

:model theory = algebraic geometry − fields.

where logical formulas are to definable sets what equations are to varieties over a field.

Nonetheless, the interplay of classes of models and the sets definable in them has been crucial to the development of model theory throughout its history. For instance, while stability was originally introduced to classify theories by their numbers of models in a given cardinality, stability theory proved crucial to understanding the geometry of definable sets.

== Fundamental notions of first-order model theory ==

===First-order logic===
A first-order &quot;formula&quot; is built out of atomic formulas such as formula_1 or formula_2 by means of the Boolean connectives formula_3 and prefixing of quantifiers formula_4 or formula_5. A sentence is a formula in which each occurrence of a variable is in the scope of a corresponding quantifier. Examples for formulas are formula_6 (or formula_7 to indicate formula_8 is the unbound variable in formula_6) and formula_10 (or formula_11), defined as follows:

:formula_12

(Note that the equality symbol has a double meaning here.) It is intuitively clear how to translate such formulas into mathematical meaning. In the semiring of natural numbers formula_13, viewed as a structure with binary functions for addition and multiplication and constants for 0 and 1 of the natural numbers, for example, an element formula_14 &quot;satisfies&quot; the formula formula_6 if and only if formula_14 is a prime number. The formula formula_10 similarly defines irreducibility. Tarski gave a rigorous definition, sometimes called &quot;Tarski&#x27;s definition of truth&quot;, for the satisfaction relation formula_18, so that one easily proves:

:formula_19 is a prime number.
:formula_20 is irreducible.

A set formula_21 of sentences is called a (first-order) theory, which takes the sentences in the set as its axioms. A theory is &quot;satisfiable&quot; if it has a &quot;model&quot; formula_22, i.e. a structure (of the appropriate signature) which satisfies all the sentences in the set formula_21. A complete theory is a theory that contains every sentence or its negation.
The complete theory of all sentences satisfied by a structure is also called the &quot;theory of that structure&quot;.

It&#x27;s a consequence of Gödel&#x27;s completeness theorem (not to be confused with his incompleteness theorems) that a theory has a model if and only if it is consistent, i.e. no contradiction is proved by the theory.
Therefore, model theorists often use &quot;consistent&quot; as a synonym for &quot;satisfiable&quot;.

===Basic model-theoretic concepts===
A signature or language is a set of non-logical symbols such that each symbol is either a constant symbol, or a function or relation symbol with a specified arity. Note that in some literature, constant symbols are considered as function symbols with zero arity, and hence are omitted. A structure is a set formula_24 together with interpretations of each of the symbols of the signature as relations and functions on formula_25 (not to be confused with the formal notion of an &quot;interpretation&quot; of one structure in another).

Example: A common signature for ordered rings is formula_26, where formula_27 and formula_28 are 0-ary function symbols (also known as constant symbols), formula_29 and formula_30 are binary (= 2-ary) function symbols, formula_31 is a unary (= 1-ary) function symbol, and formula_32 is a binary relation symbol. Then, when these symbols are interpreted to correspond with their usual meaning on formula_33 (so that e.g. formula_34 is a function from formula_35 to formula_33 and formula_32 is a subset of formula_35), one obtains a structure formula_39.

A structure formula_40 is said to model a set of first-order sentences formula_41 in the given language if each sentence in formula_21 is true in formula_43 with respect to the interpretation of the signature previously specified for formula_40. (Again, not to be confused with the formal notion of an &quot;interpretation&quot; of one structure in another) A &quot;model&quot; of formula_41 is a structure that models formula_41.

A substructure formula_47 of a σ-structure formula_48 is a subset of its domain, closed under all functions in its signature σ, which is regarded as a σ-structure by restricting all functions and relations in σ to the subset.
This generalises the analogous concepts from algebra; for instance, a subgroup is a substructure in the signature with multiplication and inverse.

A substructure is said to be &quot;elementary&quot; if for any first-order formula formula_6 and any elements &quot;a&quot;1, ..., &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot; of formula_47,
:formula_51 if and only if formula_52.
In particular, if formula_6 is a sentence and formula_47 an elementary substructure of formula_48, then formula_56 if and only if formula_57. Thus, an elementary substructure is a model of a theory exactly when the superstructure is a model.

Example: While the field of algebraic numbers formula_58 is an elementary substructure of the field of complex numbers formula_59, the rational field formula_60 is not, as we can express &quot;There is a square root of 2&quot; as a first-order sentence satisfied by formula_59 but not by formula_60.

An embedding of a σ-structure formula_47 into another σ-structure formula_48 is a map &quot;f&quot;: &quot;A&quot; → &quot;B&quot; between the domains which can be written as an isomorphism of formula_47 with a substructure of formula_48. If it can be written as an isomorphism with an elementary substructure, it is called an elementary embedding. Every embedding is an injective homomorphism, but the converse holds only if the signature contains no relation symbols, such as in groups or fields.

A field or a vector space can be regarded as a (commutative) group by simply ignoring some of its structure. The corresponding notion in model theory is that of a &quot;reduct&quot; of a structure to a subset of the original signature. The opposite relation is called an &quot;expansion&quot; - e.g. the (additive) group of the rational numbers, regarded as a structure in the signature {+,0} can be expanded to a field with the signature {×,+,1,0} or to an ordered group with the signature {+,0,&lt;}.

Similarly, if σ&#x27; is a signature that extends another signature σ, then a complete σ&#x27;-theory can be restricted to σ by intersecting the set of its sentences with the set of σ-formulas. Conversely, a complete σ-theory can be regarded as a σ&#x27;-theory, and one can extend it (in more than one way) to a complete σ&#x27;-theory. The terms reduct and expansion are sometimes applied to this relation as well.

===Compactness and the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem===

The compactness theorem states that a set of sentences S is satisfiable if every finite subset of S is satisfiable. The analogous statement with &quot;consistent&quot; instead of &quot;satisfiable&quot; is trivial, since every proof can have only a finite number of antecedents used in the proof. The completeness theorem allows us to transfer this to satisfiability. However, there are also several direct (semantic) proofs of the compactness theorem.
As a corollary (i.e., its contrapositive), the compactness theorem says that every unsatisfiable first-order theory has a finite unsatisfiable subset. This theorem is of central importance in model theory, where the words &quot;by compactness&quot; are commonplace.

Another cornerstone of first-order model theory is the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem. According to the theorem, every infinite structure in a countable signature has a countable elementary substructure. Conversely, for any infinite cardinal κ every infinite structure in a countable signature that is of cardinality less than κ can be elementarily embedded in another structure of cardinality κ (There is a straightforward generalisation to uncountable signatures). In particular, the Löwenheim-Skolem theorem implies that any theory in a countable signature with infinite models has a countable model as well as arbitrarily large models.

In a certain sense made precise by Lindström&#x27;s theorem, first-order logic is the most expressive logic for which both the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem and the compactness theorem hold.

==Definability==

===Definable sets===
In model theory, definable sets are important objects of study. For instance, in formula_67 the formula
:formula_68
defines the subset of prime numbers, while the formula
:formula_69
defines the subset of even numbers.
In a similar way, formulas with &quot;n&quot; free variables define subsets of formula_70. For example, in a field, the formula
:formula_71
defines the curve of all formula_72 such that formula_73.

Both of the definitions mentioned here are &quot;parameter-free&quot;, that is, the defining formulas don&#x27;t mention any fixed domain elements. However, one can also consider definitions &quot;with parameters from the model&quot;.
For instance, in formula_74, the formula
:formula_75
uses the parameter formula_76 from formula_74 to define a curve.

===Eliminating quantifiers===
In general, definable sets without quantifiers are easy to describe, while definable sets involving possibly nested quantifiers can be much more complicated.

This makes quantifier elimination a crucial tool for analysing definable sets: 
A theory &quot;T&quot; has quantifier elimination if every first-order formula over its signature is equivalent modulo &quot;T&quot; to a first-order formula without quantifiers, i.e. formula_78 holds in all models of &quot;T&quot;.
If the theory of a structure has quantifier elimination, every set definable in a structure is definable by a quantifier-free formula over the same parameters as the original definition.
For example, the theory of algebraically closed fields in the signature has quantifier elimination. This means that in an algebraically closed field, every formula is equivalent to a Boolean combination of equations between polynomials.

If a theory does not have quantifier elimination, one can add additional symbols to its signature so that it does. Axiomatisability and quantifier elimination results for specific theories, especially in algebra, were among the early landmark results of model theory. But often instead of quantifier elimination a weaker property suffices:

A theory &quot;T&quot; is called model-complete if every substructure of a model of &quot;T&quot; which is itself a model of &quot;T&quot; is an elementary substructure. There is a useful criterion for testing whether a substructure is an elementary substructure, called the Tarski–Vaught test. It follows from this criterion that a theory &quot;T&quot; is model-complete if and only if every first-order formula over its signature is equivalent modulo &quot;T&quot; to an existential first-order formula, i.e. a formula of the following form:
:formula_79,
where ψ is quantifier free. A theory that is not model-complete may have a model completion, which is a related model-complete theory that is not, in general, an extension of the original theory. A more general notion is that of a model companion.

===Minimality===
In every structure, every finite subset formula_80 is definable with parameters: Simply use the formula
:formula_81.
Since we can negate this formula, every cofinite subset (which includes all but finitely many elements of the domain) is also always definable.

This leads to the concept of a &quot;minimal structure&quot;. 
A structure formula_82 is called minimal if every subset formula_83 definable with parameters from formula_82 is either finite or cofinite.
The corresponding concept at the level of theories is called &quot;strong minimality&quot;:
A theory &quot;T&quot; is called strongly minimal if every model of &quot;T&quot; is minimal.
A structure is called &quot;strongly minimal&quot; if the theory of that structure is strongly minimal. Equivalently, a structure is strongly minimal if every elementary extension is minimal.
Since the theory of algebraically closed fields has quantifier elimination, every definable subset of an algebraically closed field is definable by a quantifier-free formula in one variable. Quantifier-free formulas in one variable express Boolean combinations of polynomial equations in one variable, and since a nontrivial polynomial equation in one variable has only a finite number of solutions, the theory of algebraically closed fields is strongly minimal.

On the other hand, the field formula_74 of real numbers is not minimal: Consider, for instance, the definable set
:formula_86.
This defines the subset of non-negative real numbers, which is neither finite nor cofinite.
One can in fact use formula_6 to define arbitrary intervals on the real number line.
It turns out that these suffice to represent every definable subset of formula_74.
This generalisation of minimality has been very useful in the model theory of ordered structures.
A densely totally ordered structure formula_82 in a signature including a symbol for the order relation is called o-minimal if every subset formula_83 definable with parameters from formula_82 is a finite union of points and intervals.

===Definable and interpretable structures===

Particularly important are those definable sets that are also substructures, i. e. contain all constants and are closed under function application. For instance, one can study the definable subgroups of a certain group.
However, there is no need to limit oneself to substructures in the same signature. Since formulas with &quot;n&quot; free variables define subsets of formula_70, &quot;n&quot;-ary relations can also be definable. Functions are definable if the function graph is a definable relation, and constants formula_93 are definable if there is a formula formula_7 such that &quot;a&quot; is the only element of formula_82 such that formula_96 is true.
In this way, one can study definable groups and fields in general structures, for instance, which has been important in geometric stability theory.

One can even go one step further, and move beyond immediate substructures.
Given a mathematical structure, there are very often associated structures which can be constructed as a quotient of part of the original structure via an equivalence relation. An important example is a quotient group of a group. 
One might say that to understand the full structure one must understand these quotients. When the equivalence relation is definable, we can give the previous sentence a precise meaning. We say that these structures are &quot;interpretable&quot;.
A key fact is that one can translate sentences from the language of the interpreted structures to the language of the original structure. Thus one can show that if a structure formula_82 interprets another whose theory is undecidable, then formula_82 itself is undecidable.

== Types ==
===Basic notions===
For a sequence of elements formula_99 of a structure formula_82 and a subset &quot;A&quot; of formula_82, one can consider the set of all first-order formulas formula_102 with parameters in &quot;A&quot; that are satisfied by formula_99. This is called the &quot;complete (n-)type realised by&quot; formula_99 &quot;over A&quot;.
If there is an automorphism of formula_82 that is constant on &quot;A&quot; and sends formula_99 to formula_107 respectively, then formula_99 and formula_107 realise the same complete type over &quot;A&quot;.

The real number line formula_74, viewed as a structure with only the order relation {&lt;}, will serve as a running example in this section.
Every element formula_111 satisfies the same 1-type over the empty set. This is clear since any two real numbers &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are connected by the order automorphism that shifts all numbers by &quot;b-a&quot;. The complete 2-type over the empty set realised by a pair of numbers formula_112 depends on their order: either formula_113, formula_114 or formula_115.
Over the subset formula_116 of integers, the 1-type of a non-integer real number &quot;a&quot; depends on its value rounded down to the nearest integer.

More generally, whenever formula_82 is a structure and &quot;A&quot; a subset of formula_82, a (partial) &quot;n-type over A&quot; is a set of formulas &quot;p&quot; with at most &quot;n&quot; free variables that are realised in an elementary extension formula_119 of formula_82. 
If &quot;p&quot; contains every such formula or its negation, then &quot;p&quot; is &quot;complete&quot;. The set of complete &quot;n&quot;-types over &quot;A&quot; is often written as formula_121. If &quot;A&quot; is the empty set, then the type space only depends on the theory formula_21 of formula_82. The notation formula_124 is commonly used for the set of types over the empty set consistent with formula_21. 
If there is a single formula formula_126 such that the theory of formula_82 implies formula_128 for every formula formula_10 in &quot;p&quot;, then &quot;p&quot; is called &quot;isolated&quot;.

Since the real numbers formula_74 are Archimedean, there is no real number larger than every integer. However, a compactness argument shows that there is an elementary extension of the real number line in which there is an element larger than any integer.
Therefore, the set of formulas formula_131 is a 1-type over formula_116 that is not realised in the real number line formula_74.

A subset of formula_70 that can be expressed as exactly those elements of formula_70 realising a certain type over &quot;A&quot; is called &quot;type-definable&quot; over &quot;A&quot;.
For an algebraic example, suppose formula_136 is an algebraically closed field. The theory has quantifier elimination . This allows us to show that a type is determined exactly by the polynomial equations it contains. Thus the set of complete formula_14-types over a subfield formula_138 corresponds to the set of prime ideals of the polynomial ring formula_139, and the type-definable sets are exactly the affine varieties.

===Structures and types===
While not every type is realised in every structure, every structure realises its isolated types.
If the only types over the empty set that are realised in a structure are the isolated types, then the structure is called &quot;atomic&quot;.

On the other hand, no structure realises every type over every parameter set; if one takes all of formula_82 as the parameter set, then every 1-type over formula_82 realised in formula_82 is isolated by a formula of the form &quot;a = x&quot; for an formula_143. However, any proper elementary extension of formula_82 contains an element that is &quot;not&quot; in formula_82. Therefore, a weaker notion has been introduced that captures the idea of a structure realising all types it could be expected to realise.
A structure is called &quot;saturated&quot; if it realises every type over a parameter set formula_146 that is of smaller cardinality than formula_82 itself.

While an automorphism that is constant on &quot;A&quot; will always preserve types over &quot;A&quot;, it is generally not true that any two sequences formula_99 and formula_107 that satisfy the same type over &quot;A&quot; can be mapped to each other by such an automorphism. A structure formula_82 in which this converse does hold for all &quot;A&quot; of smaller cardinality than formula_82 is called homogeneous.

The real number line is atomic in the language that contains only the order formula_152, since all &quot;n&quot;-types over the empty set realised by formula_99 in formula_74 are isolated by the order relations between the formula_99. It is not saturated, however, since it does not realise any 1-type over the countable set formula_156 that implies &quot;x&quot; to be larger than any integer.
The rational number line formula_60 is saturated, in contrast, since formula_60 is itself countable and therefore only has to realise types over finite subsets to be saturated.

===Stone spaces===
The set of definable subsets of formula_70 over some parameters formula_138 is a Boolean algebra. By Stone&#x27;s representation theorem for Boolean algebras there is a natural dual topological space, which consists exactly of the complete formula_14-types over formula_138. The topology generated by sets of the form formula_163 for single formulas formula_6. This is called the &quot;Stone space of n-types over A&quot;.
This topology explains some of the terminology used in model theory: The compactness theorem says that the Stone space is a compact topological space, and a type &quot;p&quot; is isolated if and only if &quot;p&quot; is an isolated point in the Stone topology.

While types in algebraically closed fields correspond to the spectrum of the polynomial ring, the topology on the type space is the constructible topology: a set of types is basic open iff it is of the form formula_165 or of the form formula_166. This is finer than the Zariski topology.

==Constructing models==

===Realising and omitting types===
Constructing models that realise certain types and do not realise others is an important task in model theory.
Not realising a type is referred to as &quot;omitting&quot; it, and is generally possible by the &quot;(Countable) Omitting types theorem&quot;:

:Let formula_167 be a theory in a countable signature and let formula_168 be a countable set of non-isolated types over the empty set.
:Then there is a model formula_82 of formula_167 which omits every type in formula_168.

This implies that if a theory in a countable signature has only countably many types over the empty set, then this theory has an atomic model.

On the other hand, there is always an elementary extension in which any set of types over a fixed parameter set is realised:

:Let formula_82 be a structure and let formula_168 be a set of complete types over a given parameter set formula_174
:Then there is an elementary extension formula_119 of formula_82 which realises every type in formula_168.

However, since the parameter set is fixed and there is no mention here of the cardinality of formula_119, this does not imply that every theory has a saturated model.
In fact, whether every theory has a saturated model is independent of the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, and is true if the generalised continuum hypothesis holds.

===Ultraproducts===
Ultraproducts are used as a general technique for constructing models that realise certain types.
An &quot;ultraproduct&quot; is obtained from the direct product of a set of structures over an index set by identifying those tuples that agree on almost all entries, where &quot;almost all&quot; is made precise by an ultrafilter on . An ultraproduct of copies of the same structure is known as an &quot;ultrapower&quot;.
The key to using ultraproducts in model theory is &quot;Łoś&#x27;s theorem&quot;:

: Let formula_179 be a set of -structures indexed by an index set and an ultrafilter on . Then any -formula formula_180 is true in the ultraproduct of the formula_179 by formula_182 if the set of all formula_183 for which formula_184 lies in .

In particular, any ultraproduct of models of a theory is itself a model of that theory, and thus if two models have isomorphic ultrapowers, they are elementarily equivalent.
The &quot;Keisler-Shelah theorem&quot; provides a converse:

:If and are elementary equivalent, then there is a set and an ultrafilter on such that the ultrapowers by of and : are isomorphic.

Therefore, ultraproducts provide a way to talk about elementary equivalence that avoids mentioning first-order theories at all. Basic theorems of model theory such as the compactness theorem have alternative proofs using ultraproducts, and they can be used to construct saturated elementary extensions if they exist.

== Categoricity ==
A theory was originally called &quot;categorical&quot; if it determines a structure up to isomorphism. It turns out that this definition is not useful, due to serious restrictions in the expressivity of first-order logic. The Löwenheim–Skolem theorem implies that if a theory &quot;T&quot; has an infinite model for some infinite cardinal number, then it has a model of size for any sufficiently large cardinal number . Since two models of different sizes cannot possibly be isomorphic, only finite structures can be described by a categorical theory.

However, the weaker notion of -categoricity for a cardinal has become a key concept in model theory. A theory &quot;T&quot; is called &quot;-categorical&quot; if any two models of &quot;T&quot; that are of cardinality are isomorphic. It turns out that the question of -categoricity depends critically on whether is bigger than the cardinality of the language (i.e. formula_185, where is the cardinality of the signature). For finite or countable signatures this means that there is a fundamental difference between -cardinality and -cardinality for uncountable .

=== -categoricity ===
-categorical theories can be characterised by properties of their type space:
:For a complete first-order theory &quot;T&quot; in a finite or countable signature the following conditions are equivalent:
:#&quot;T&quot; is -categorical.
:#Every type in &quot;Sn&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) is isolated.
:#For every natural number &quot;n&quot;, &quot;Sn&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) is finite.
:#For every natural number &quot;n&quot;, the number of formulas &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;n) in &quot;n&quot; free variables, up to equivalence modulo &quot;T&quot;, is finite.

The theory of formula_186, which is also the theory of formula_187, is -categorical, as every &quot;n&quot;-type formula_188 over the empty set is isolated by the pairwise order relation between the formula_189.
This means that every countable dense linear order is order-isomorphic to the rational number line. On the other hand, the theories of , and as fields are not formula_190-categorical. This follows from the fact that in all those fields, any of the infinitely many natural numbers can be defined by a formula of the form formula_191.

formula_192-categorical theories and their countable models also have strong ties with oligomorphic groups:
:A complete first-order theory &quot;T&quot; in a finite or countable signature is -categorical if and only if its automorphism group is oligomorphic.

The equivalent characterisations of this subsection, due independently to Engeler, Ryll-Nardzewski and Svenonius, are sometimes referred to as the Ryll-Nardzewski theorem.

In combinatorial signatures, a common source of -categorical theories are Fraïssé limits, which are obtained as the limit of amalgamating all possible configurations of a class of finite relational structures.

=== Uncountable categoricity ===

Michael Morley showed in 1963 that there is only one notion of &quot;uncountable categoricity&quot; for theories in countable languages.
:Morley&#x27;s categoricity theorem
:If a first-order theory &quot;T&quot; in a finite or countable signature is -categorical for some uncountable cardinal , then &quot;T&quot; is κ-categorical for all uncountable cardinals .

Morley&#x27;s proof revealed deep connections between uncountable categoricity and the internal structure of the models, which became the starting point of classification theory and stability theory. 
Uncountably categorical theories are from many points of view the most well-behaved theories.
In particular, complete strongly minimal theories are uncountably categorical. This shows that the theory of algebraically closed fields of a given characteristic is uncountably categorical, with the transcendence degree of the field determining its isomorphism type.

A theory that is both -categorical and uncountably categorical is called &quot;totally categorical&quot;.

== Stability theory==
A key factor in the structure of the class of models of a first-order theory is its place in the &quot;stability hierarchy&quot;. 
:A complete theory &quot;T&quot; is called &quot;formula_193-stable&quot; for a cardinal formula_193 if for any model formula_82 of &quot;T&quot; and any parameter set formula_146 of cardinality not exceeding formula_193, there are at most formula_193 complete &quot;T&quot;-types over &quot;A&quot;.
A theory is called &quot;stable&quot; if it is formula_193-stable for some infinite cardinal formula_193. Traditionally, theories that are formula_192-stable are called &quot;formula_190-stable&quot;.

===The stability hierarchy===
A fundamental result in stability theory is the &quot;stability spectrum theorem&quot;, which implies that every complete theory &quot;T&quot; in a countable signature falls in one of the following classes:

# There are no cardinals formula_193 such that &quot;T&quot; is formula_193-stable.
# &quot;T&quot; is formula_193-stable if and only if formula_206 (see Cardinal exponentiation for an explanation of formula_207).
# &quot;T&quot; is formula_193-stable for any formula_209 (where formula_210 is the cardinality of the continuum).

A theory of the first type is called &quot;unstable&quot;, a theory of the second type is called &quot;strictly stable&quot; and a theory of the third type is called &quot;superstable&quot;.
Furthermore, if a theory is formula_190-stable, it is stable in every infinite cardinal, so formula_190-stability is stronger than superstability.

Many construction in model theory are easier when restricted to stable theories; for instance, every model of a stable theory has a saturated elementary extension, regardless of whether the generalised continuum hypothesis is true.

Shelah&#x27;s original motivation for studying stable theories was to decide how many models a countable theory has of any uncountable cardinality. 
If a theory is uncountably categorical, then it is formula_190-stable. More generally, the &quot;Main gap theorem&quot; implies that if there is an uncountable cardinal formula_193 such that a theory &quot;T&quot; has less than formula_215 models of cardinality formula_193, then &quot;T&quot; is superstable.

===Geometric stability theory===
The stability hierarchy is also crucial for analysing the geometry of definable sets within a model of a theory. 
In formula_190-stable theories, &quot;Morley rank&quot; is an important dimension notion for definable sets &quot;S&quot; within a model. It is defined by transfinite induction:

*The Morley rank is at least 0 if &quot;S&quot; is non-empty.
*For &quot;α&quot; a successor ordinal, the Morley rank is at least &quot;α&quot; if in some elementary extension &quot;N&quot; of &quot;M&quot;, the set &quot;S&quot; has infinitely many disjoint definable subsets, each of rank at least &quot;α&quot; − 1.
*For &quot;α&quot; a non-zero limit ordinal, the Morley rank is at least &quot;α&quot; if it is at least &quot;β&quot; for all &quot;β&quot; less than &quot;α&quot;.

A theory &quot;T&quot; in which every definable set has well-defined Morley rank is called &quot;totally transcendental&quot;; if &quot;T&quot; is countable, then &quot;T&quot; is totally transcendental if and only if &quot;T&quot; is formula_190-stable.
Morley Rank can be extended to types by setting the Morley rank of a type to be the minimum of the Morley ranks of the formulas in the type. Thus, one can also speak of the Morley rank of an element &quot;a&quot; over a parameter set &quot;A&quot;, defined as the Morley rank of the type of &quot;a&quot; over &quot;A&quot;. 
There are also analogues of Morley rank which are well-defined if and only if a theory is superstable (U-rank) or merely stable (Shelah&#x27;s formula_219-rank).
Those dimension notions can be used to define notions of independence and of generic extensions.

More recently, stability has been decomposed into simplicity and &quot;not the independence property&quot; (NIP). 
Simple theories are those theories in which a well-behaved notion of independence can be defined, while NIP theories generalise o-minimal structures.
They are related to stability since a theory is stable if and only if it is NIP and simple, and various aspects of stability theory have been generalised to theories in one of these classes.

==Non-elementary model theory==

Model-theoretic results have been generalised beyond elementary classes, that is, classes axiomatisable by a first-order theory.

Model theory in higher-order logics or infinitary logics is hampered by the fact that completeness and compactness do not in general hold for these logics. This is made concrete by Lindstrom&#x27;s theorem, stating roughly that first-order logic is essentially the strongest logic in which both the Löwenheim-Skolem theorems and compactness hold. However, model theoretic techniques have been developed extensively for these logics too. It turns out, however, that much of the model theory of more expressive logical languages is independent of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory.

More recently, alongside the shift in focus to complete stable and categorical theories, there has been work on classes of models defined semantically rather than axiomatised by a logical theory.
One example is &quot;homogeneous model theory&quot;, which studies the class of substructures of arbitrarily large homogeneous models. Fundamental results of stability theory and geometric stability theory generalise to this setting.
As a generalisation of strongly minimal theories, quasiminimally excellent classes are those in which every definable set is either countable or co-countable. They are key to the model theory of the complex exponential function.
The most general semantic framework in which stability is studied are abstract elementary classes, which are defined by a &quot;strong substructure&quot; relation generalising that of an elementary substructure. Even though its definition is purely semantic, every abstract elementary class can be presented as the models of a first-order theory which omit certain types. Generalising stability-theoretic notions to abstract elementary classes is an ongoing research program.

==Selected applications==

Among the early successes of model theory are Tarski&#x27;s proofs of quantifier elimination for various algebraically interesting classes, such as the real closed fields, Boolean algebras and algebraically closed fields of a given characteristic. Quantifier elimination allowed Tarski to show that the first-order theories of real-closed and algebraically closed fields as well as the first-order theory of Boolean algebras are decidable, classify the Boolean algebras up to elementary equivalence and show that the theories of real-closed fields and algebraically closed fields of a given characteristic are unique. Furthermore, quantifier elimination provided a precise description of definable relations on algebraically closed fields as algebraic varieties and of the definable relations on real-closed fields as semialgebraic sets

In the 1960s, the introduction of the ultraproduct construction led to new applications in algebra. This includes Ax&#x27;s work on pseudofinite fields, proving that the theory of finite fields is decidable, and Ax and Kochen&#x27;s proof of as special case of Artin&#x27;s conjecture on diophantine equations, the Ax–Kochen theorem. The ultraproduct construction also led to Abraham Robinson&#x27;s development of nonstandard analysis, which aims to provide a rigorous calculus of infinitesimals.

More recently, the connection between stability and the geometry of definable sets led to several applications from algebraic and diophantine geometry, including Ehud Hrushovski&#x27;s 1996 proof of the geometric Mordell–Lang conjecture in all characteristics In 2001, similar methods were used to prove a generalisation of the Manin-Mumford conjecture.
In 2011, Jonathan Pila applied techniques around o-minimality to prove the André–Oort conjecture for products of Modular curves.

In a separate strand of inquiries that also grew around stable theories, Laskowski showed in 1992 that NIP theories describe exactly those definable classes that are PAC-learnable in machine learning theory. This has led to several interactions between these separate areas. In 2018, the correspondence was extended as Hunter and Chase showed that stable theories correspond to online learnable classes.

== History ==

Model theory as a subject has existed since approximately the middle of the 20th century, and the name was coined by Alfred Tarski, a member of the Lwów–Warsaw school, in 1954. However some earlier research, especially in mathematical logic, is often regarded as being of a model-theoretical nature in retrospect. The first significant result in what is now model theory was a special case of the downward Löwenheim–Skolem theorem, published by Leopold Löwenheim in 1915. The compactness theorem was implicit in work by Thoralf Skolem, but it was first published in 1930, as a lemma in Kurt Gödel&#x27;s proof of his completeness theorem. The Löwenheim–Skolem theorem and the compactness theorem received their respective general forms in 1936 and 1941 from Anatoly Maltsev.
The development of model theory as an independent discipline was brought on by Alfred Tarski during the interbellum. Tarski&#x27;s work included logical consequence, deductive systems, the algebra of logic, the theory of definability, and the semantic definition of truth, among other topics. His semantic methods culminated in the model theory he and a number of his Berkeley students developed in the 1950s and &#x27;60s.

In the further history of the discipline, different strands began to emerge, and the focus of the subject shifted. In the 1960s, techniques around ultraproducts became a popular tool in model theory. At the same time, researchers such as James Ax were investigating the first-order model theory of various algebraic classes, and others such as H. Jerome Keisler were extending the concepts and results of first-order model theory to other logical systems. Then, inspired by Morley&#x27;s problem, Shelah developed stability theory. His work around stability changed the complexion of model theory, giving rise to a whole new class of concepts. This is known as the paradigm shift. 
Over the next decades, it became clear that the resulting stability hierarchy is closely connected to the geometry of sets that are definable in those models; this gave rise to the subdiscipline now known as geometric stability theory. An example of an influential proof from geometric model theory is Hrushovski&#x27;s proof of the Mordell–Lang conjecture for function fields.

==Connections to related branches of mathematical logic==

===Finite model theory ===
Finite model theory, which concentrates on finite structures, diverges significantly from the study of infinite structures in both the problems studied and the techniques used. In particular, many central results of classical model theory that fail when restricted to finite structures. This includes the compactness theorem, Gödel&#x27;s completeness theorem, and the method of ultraproducts for first-order logic. At the interface of finite and infinite model theory are algorithmic or computable model theory and the study of 0-1 laws, where the infinite models of a generic theory of a class of structures provide information on the distribution of finite models. 
Prominent application areas of FMT are descriptive complexity theory, database theory and formal language theory.

=== Set theory ===

Any set theory (which is expressed in a countable language), if it is consistent, has a countable model; this is known as Skolem&#x27;s paradox, since there are sentences in set theory which postulate the existence of uncountable sets and yet these sentences are true in our countable model. Particularly the proof of the independence of the continuum hypothesis requires considering sets in models which appear to be uncountable when viewed from &quot;within&quot; the model, but are countable to someone &quot;outside&quot; the model.

The model-theoretic viewpoint has been useful in set theory; for example in Kurt Gödel&#x27;s work on the constructible universe, which, along with the method of forcing developed by Paul Cohen can be shown to prove the (again philosophically interesting) independence of the axiom of choice and the continuum hypothesis from the other axioms of set theory.

In the other direction, model theory is itself formalised within Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory. For instance, the development of the fundamentals of model theory (such as the compactness theorem) rely on the axiom of choice, and is in fact equivalent over Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory without choice to the Boolean prime ideal theorem. Other results in model theory depend on set-theoretic axioms beyond the standard ZFC framework. For example, if the Continuum Hypothesis holds then every countable model has an ultrapower which is saturated (in its own cardinality). Similarly, if the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis holds then every model has a saturated elementary extension. Neither of these results are provable in ZFC alone. Finally, some questions arising from model theory (such as compactness for infinitary logics) have been shown to be equivalent to large cardinal axioms.

<text>Moby-Dick; or, The Whale is an 1851 epic novel by American writer Herman Melville. The book is centered on the sailor Ishmael&#x27;s narrative of the maniacal quest of Ahab, captain of the whaling ship &quot;Pequod&quot;, for vengeance against Moby Dick, the giant white sperm whale that bit off his leg on the ship&#x27;s previous voyage. A contribution to the literature of the American Renaissance, &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; was published to mixed reviews, was a commercial failure, and was out of print at the time of the author&#x27;s death in 1891. Its reputation as a Great American Novel was established only in the 20th century, after the 1919 centennial of its author&#x27;s birth. William Faulkner said he wished he had written the book himself, and D. H. Lawrence called it &quot;one of the strangest and most wonderful books in the world&quot; and &quot;the greatest book of the sea ever written&quot;. Its opening sentence, &quot;Call me Ishmael&quot;, is among world literature&#x27;s most famous.

Melville began writing &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; in February 1850 and finished 18 months later, a year after he had anticipated. Melville drew on his experience as a common sailor from 1841 to 1844, including on whalers, and on wide reading in whaling literature. The white whale is modeled on a notoriously hard-to-catch albino whale Mocha Dick, and the book&#x27;s ending is based on the sinking of the whaleship &quot;Essex&quot; in 1820. The detailed and realistic descriptions of sailing, whale hunting and of extracting whale oil, as well as life aboard ship among a culturally diverse crew, are mixed with exploration of class and social status, good and evil, and the existence of God. 

The book&#x27;s literary influences include Shakespeare, Thomas Carlyle, Sir Thomas Browne  and the Bible. In addition to narrative prose, Melville uses styles and literary devices ranging from songs, poetry, and catalogs to Shakespearean stage directions, soliloquies, and asides. In August 1850, with the manuscript perhaps half finished, he met Nathaniel Hawthorne and was deeply impressed by his &quot;Mosses from an Old Manse&quot;, which he compared to Shakespeare in its cosmic ambitions. This encounter may have inspired him to revise and deepen &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;, which is dedicated to Hawthorne, &quot;in token of my admiration for his genius&quot;.

The book was first published (in three volumes) as &quot;The Whale&quot; in London in October 1851, and under its definitive title, &quot;Moby-Dick; or, The Whale&quot;, in a single-volume edition in New York in November. The London publisher, Richard Bentley, censored or changed sensitive passages; Melville made revisions as well, including a last-minute change of the title for the New York edition. The whale, however, appears in the text of both editions as &quot;Moby Dick&quot;, without the hyphen. Reviewers in Britain were largely favorable, though some objected that the tale seemed to be told by a narrator who perished with the ship, as the British edition lacked the epilogue recounting Ishmael&#x27;s survival. American reviewers were more hostile.

==Plot==

Ishmael narrates his December travels from Manhattan Island to New Bedford, Massachusetts, with plans to sign up for a whaling voyage as a green hand. The inn where he arrives is overcrowded, so he must share a bed with a tattooed cannibal Polynesian named Queequeg, a harpooneer whose father was king of the fictional island of Rokovoko. The next morning, Ishmael and Queequeg attend Father Mapple&#x27;s sermon on Jonah, then head for Nantucket. Ishmael signs up with the Quaker ship-owners Bildad and Peleg for a voyage on their whaler &quot;Pequod&quot;. Peleg describes Captain Ahab: &quot;He&#x27;s a grand, ungodly, god-like man&quot; who nevertheless &quot;has his humanities&quot;. They hire Queequeg the following morning and a man named Elijah prophesies a dire fate should Ishmael and Queequeg join Ahab. Shadowy figures board the ship while provisions are loaded, and on a cold Christmas Day, the &quot;Pequod&quot; departs the harbor.

Ishmael begins the journey with an extensive discussion of cetology, his system for the zoological classification and natural history of the whale. He then introduces each of the crew members — the chief mate 30-year-old Starbuck, a Nantucket Quaker and realist; his harpooneer Queequeg; second mate Stubb, a cheerful man from Cape Cod; Stubb&#x27;s proud harpooneer Tashtego, a pure-blooded Indian from Gay Head; the third mate Flask from Martha&#x27;s Vineyard; and Flask&#x27;s harpooneer Daggoo, a tall African.

When Ahab finally appears on the quarterdeck, he announces he seeks revenge on the white whale that took his leg from the knee down, leaving him with a prosthesis fashioned from a whale&#x27;s jawbone. Ahab will give the first man to sight Moby Dick a doubloon, which he nails to the mast. Starbuck objects that he has not come for vengeance but for profit, but Ahab&#x27;s purpose exercises a mysterious spell on Ishmael: &quot;Ahab&#x27;s quenchless feud seemed mine.&quot; 

Traveling from Nantucket to the Azores Islands, Ahab then turns southwest and sails along the coast of South America. But instead of rounding Cape Horn at its tip, he heads northeast towards the equatorial Pacific Ocean to sail around the Cape of Good Hope in southern Africa and into the Indian Ocean. 

As the ship is en route to Africa, Tashtego sights a sperm whale on the horizon. The five shadowy figures from earlier appear on deck and are revealed as a special crew specially selected by Ahab. Their leader is a Parsee named Fedallah who serves as Ahab&#x27;s harpooneer. A pursuit of the whale ensues but is unsuccessful.

Southeast of the Cape of Good Hope, the &quot;Pequod&quot; makes the first of nine sea-encounters, or &quot;gams&quot;, with other ships: Ahab hails the &quot;Goney&quot; (Albatross) to ask whether they have seen the White Whale, but the trumpet through which her captain tries to speak falls into the sea before he can answer. Ishmael explains that because of Ahab&#x27;s absorption with Moby Dick, he sails on without the customary &quot;gam&quot;, which Ishmael defines as a &quot;social meeting of two (or more) Whale-ships&quot;, in which the two captains remain on one ship and the chief mates on the other. In the second gam off the Cape of Good Hope with the &quot;Town-Ho,&quot; the concealed story of a &quot;judgment of God&quot; is revealed, but only to the crew: a defiant sailor who struck an oppressive officer was flogged, and when the punishing officer later led the chase for Moby Dick, he fell from the boat and was killed by the whale.

Ishmael digresses on pictures of whales, brit, squid and—after four boats are lowered in vain because Daggoo mistook a giant squid for the white whale—whale-lines. The next day, in the Indian Ocean, Stubb kills a sperm whale, and that night Fleece, the &quot;Pequod&quot;″s black cook, prepares him a rare whale steak. Fleece, at Stubb&#x27;s request, delivers a sermon to the sharks that fight each other to feast on the whale&#x27;s carcass, tied to the ship, saying that their nature is to be voracious, but they must overcome it. The whale is prepared, beheaded, and barrels of oil are tried out. Standing at the head of the whale, Ahab begs it to speak of the depths of the sea. The &quot;Pequod&quot; next encounters the &quot;Jeroboam&quot;, which not only lost its chief mate to Moby Dick, but also is now plagued by an endemic infection.

The whale carcass still lies in the water. Queequeg mounts it, tied to Ishmael&#x27;s belt by a monkey-rope as if they were Siamese twins. Stubb and Flask later kill a right whale whose head is fastened to a yardarm opposite the sperm whale&#x27;s head. Ishmael compares the two heads in a philosophical way: the right whale is Lockean, stoic, and the sperm whale is Kantean, platonic. Tashtego cuts into the head of the sperm whale and retrieves buckets of spermaceti. He falls into the head, which in turn falls off the yardarm into the sea. Queequeg dives after him and frees Tashtego with his sword.

The &quot;Pequod&quot; next gams with the &quot;Jungfrau&quot; from Bremen. Both ships sight whales simultaneously, with the &quot;Pequod&quot; winning the contest. The three harpooneers dart their harpoons, and Flask delivers the mortal strike with a lance. The carcass sinks, and Queequeg barely manages to escape. The &quot;Pequod&quot;″s next gam is with the French whaler &quot;Bouton de Rose&quot;, whose crew is ignorant of the ambergris in the gut of the diseased whale in their possession. Stubb talks them out of continuing, but Ahab orders him away. Days later, Pip, a little African American cabin-boy, jumps in panic from Stubb&#x27;s whale boat and the whale must be cut loose because Pip is entangled in the line; a few days later Pip again jumps in panic, is left alone in the sea, and has gone insane by the time they find him.

The crew spends time processing various harvested whale parts — liquifying congealed spermaceti, boiling blubber, decanting warm oil into casks, stowing them in cargo, and scrubbing the decks. 

Ishmael discusses the symbolism in the coin hammered to the main mast, which shows three Andes summits: one with a flame, another a tower, the third a crowing cock. Ahab looks at the doubloon and interprets the mountains as his volcanic energy, firmness, and victory; Starbuck takes the high peaks as the Trinity; Stubb focuses on the zodiacal arch over the mountains; and Flask sees no meaning. The Manxman mutters in front of the mast, and Pip declines when he is told to look.

The &quot;Pequod&quot; next gams with the &quot;Samuel Enderby&quot; of London, captained by Boomer, who lost his right arm to the whale but still carries it no ill will. His ship&#x27;s surgeon, Dr. Bunger, describes the animal not as malicious, but awkward. Ahab puts an end to the gam by rushing back to his ship. 

Ishmael then discusses the evolution of whales, specifically discussing a glen in Tranque of the Arsacides Islands full of carved whale bones and fossilized whales where one can see the decreasing size of their skeletons over time, and he considers the possibility of whale extinction.

Leaving the &quot;Samuel Enderby&quot;, Ahab wrenches his ivory leg and orders the carpenter to fashion him another. Meanwhile Queequeg, sweating all day below deck, develops a chill and severe fever. The carpenter makes a coffin for the Polynesian, anticipating a burial at sea. Queequeg tries it for size as Pip sobs and beats his tambourine, standing by and calling himself a coward while he praises his companion. Queequeg suddenly rallies and returns to good health and uses his coffin as a spare seachest.

The &quot;Pequod&quot; sails northeast toward Formosa and into the Pacific Ocean. Ahab, with one nostril, smells the musk from the Bashee isles, and with the other, the salt of the waters where Moby Dick swims. Ahab goes to Perth, the blacksmith, with a bag of racehorse shoenail stubs to be forged into the shank of a special harpoon, and with his razors for Perth to melt and fashion into a harpoon barb. Ahab tempers the barb in blood from Queequeg, Tashtego, and Daggoo.

The &quot;Pequod&quot; gams next with the &quot;Bachelor&quot;, a Nantucket ship heading home full of sperm oil. Every now and then, the &quot;Pequod&quot; lowers for whales with success. On one of those nights in the whaleboat, Fedallah prophesies that neither hearse nor coffin can be Ahab&#x27;s, that before he dies, Ahab must see two hearses — one not made by mortal hands and the other made of American wood — that Fedallah will precede his captain in death, and finally that only hemp can kill Ahab.

As the &quot;Pequod&quot; approaches the equator, Ahab scolds his quadrant for telling him only where he is and not where he will be, and dashes it to the deck. That evening, a typhoon attacks the ship and lightning strikes the mast, setting the doubloon and Ahab&#x27;s harpoon aglow. Ahab delivers a speech on the fire, seeing the lightning as a portent of Moby Dick. Starbuck sees the lightning as a warning, and feels tempted to shoot the sleeping Ahab with his musket. The next morning, when he finds that the lightning disoriented the compass, Ahab makes a new one out of a lance, a maul, and a sailmaker&#x27;s needle. He orders the log be heaved, but the weathered line snaps, leaving the ship with no way to fix its location.

The &quot;Pequod&quot; is now heading southeast toward Moby Dick. A man falls overboard from the mast. The life buoy is thrown, but both sink. Queequeg now proposes that his coffin be used as a new buoy and Starbuck has it sealed and waterproofed. The next morning, the ship meets in another truncated gam with the &quot;Rachel&quot;, commanded by Captain Gardiner from Nantucket. The &quot;Rachel&quot; is seeking survivors from one of her whaleboats which had gone after Moby Dick. Among the missing is Gardiner&#x27;s young son, but Ahab refuses to join the search.

Ahab now spends twenty-four hours a day on deck while Fedallah shadows him. One day, a sea hawk grabs Ahab&#x27;s slouched hat and flies off with it. Next, the &quot;Pequod&quot;, in a ninth and final gam, meets the &quot;Delight&quot;, badly damaged and with five of her crew left dead by Moby Dick. Her captain shouts that the harpoon which can kill the white whale has yet to be forged, to which Ahab flourishes his special lance and once more orders the ship forward. Ahab speaks to Starbuck about his wife and child, calling himself a fool for spending 40 years whaling, and says he can see his own child in Starbuck. Starbuck tries to persuade Ahab to return to Nantucket to meet their families, but Ahab refuses.

On the first day of the chase, Ahab smells the whale, climbs the mast, and sights Moby Dick. He claims the doubloon for himself, and orders all boats to lower except for Starbuck&#x27;s. The whale bites Ahab&#x27;s boat in two, tosses the captain into the sea and scatters his crew. On the second day of the chase, Ahab leaves Starbuck in charge of the &quot;Pequod&quot;. Moby Dick smashes the three boats hunting him to splinters. Ahab is rescued, but his ivory leg and Fedallah are lost. Starbuck begs Ahab to stop, but the captain vows revenge.

On the third and final day of the chase, Ahab sights Moby Dick at noon as sharks appear between the ship and the whale in anticipation of the ensuing carnage. Ahab lowers his boat for the final time, leaving Starbuck again on board. Moby Dick breaches and destroys two boats. Fedallah&#x27;s corpse, still entangled in the fouled lines, is lashed to the whale&#x27;s back, making Moby Dick the &quot;hearse not made by human hands&quot; Fedallah had prophesied earlier.

Ahab plants his harpoon in the whale&#x27;s flank and Moby Dick destroys the &quot;Pequod&quot;, tossing its men into the sea. Ishmael is unable to return to the boat and is left behind in the water. Ahab then realizes the destroyed ship is the second hearse of American wood from Fedallah&#x27;s prophecy.

Moby Dick returns within a few yards of Ahab&#x27;s boat and a harpoon is darted from the ship but its line tangles. As Ahab stoops to free it, the line loops around his neck, ensaring him against his nemesis and completing Fedallah&#x27;s augery. As the mortally stricken whale swims away, the captain is drawn with him out of sight. Queequeg&#x27;s coffin comes to the surface as the only thing to escape the vortex when the &quot;Pequod&quot; sinks. Ishmael floats on it for a day and a night until the &quot;Rachel&quot;, still looking for its lost seamen, rescues him.

==Structure==

=== Point of view ===
Ishmael is the narrator, shaping his story with the use of many different genres including sermons, stage plays, soliloquies, and emblematical readings. Repeatedly, Ishmael refers to his writing of the book: &quot;But how can I hope to explain myself here; and yet, in some dim, random way, explain myself? I must, else all these chapters might be naught.&quot; Scholar John Bryant calls him the novel&#x27;s &quot;central consciousness and narrative voice&quot;. Walter Bezanson first distinguishes Ishmael as narrator from Ishmael as character, whom he calls &quot;forecastle Ishmael&quot;, the younger Ishmael of some years ago. Narrator Ishmael, then, is &quot;merely young Ishmael grown older&quot;. A second distinction is between either or both Ishmaels with the author Herman Melville. Bezanson warns readers to &quot;resist any one-to-one equation of Melville and Ishmael&quot;.

=== Chapter structure ===
According to critic Walter Bezanson, the chapter structure can be divided into &quot;chapter sequences&quot;, &quot;chapter clusters&quot;, and &quot;balancing chapters&quot;. The simplest sequences are of narrative progression, then sequences of theme such as the three chapters on whale painting, and sequences of structural similarity, such as the five dramatic chapters beginning with &quot;The Quarter-Deck&quot; or the four chapters beginning with &quot;The Candles&quot;. Chapter clusters are the chapters on the significance of the color white, and those on the meaning of fire. Balancing chapters are chapters of opposites, such as &quot;Loomings&quot; versus the &quot;Epilogue&quot;, or similars, such as &quot;The Quarter-Deck&quot; and &quot;The Candles&quot;.

Scholar Lawrence Buell describes the arrangement of the non-narrative chapters as structured around three patterns: first, the nine meetings of the &quot;Pequod&quot; with ships that have encountered Moby Dick. Each has been more and more severely damaged, foreshadowing the &quot;Pequod&quot;″s own fate. Second, the increasingly impressive encounters with whales. In the early encounters, the whaleboats hardly make contact; later there are false alarms and routine chases; finally, the massive assembling of whales at the edges of the China Sea in &quot;The Grand Armada&quot;. A typhoon near Japan sets the stage for Ahab&#x27;s confrontation with Moby Dick.

The third pattern is the cetological documentation, so lavish that it can be divided into two subpatterns. These chapters start with the ancient history of whaling and a bibliographical classification of whales, getting closer with second-hand stories of the evil of whales in general and of Moby Dick in particular, a chronologically ordered commentary on pictures of whales. The climax to this section is chapter 57, &quot;Of whales in paint etc.&quot;, which begins with the humble (a beggar in London) and ends with the sublime (the constellation Cetus). The next chapter (&quot;Brit&quot;), thus the other half of this pattern, begins with the book&#x27;s first description of live whales, and next the anatomy of the sperm whale is studied, more or less from front to rear and from outer to inner parts, all the way down to the skeleton. Two concluding chapters set forth the whale&#x27;s evolution as a species and claim its eternal nature.

Some &quot;ten or more&quot; of the chapters on whale killings, beginning at two-fifths of the book, are developed enough to be called &quot;events&quot;. As Bezanson writes, &quot;in each case a killing provokes either a chapter sequence or a chapter cluster of cetological lore growing out of the circumstance of the particular killing,&quot; thus these killings are &quot;structural occasions for ordering the whaling essays and sermons&quot;.

Buell observes that the &quot;narrative architecture&quot; is an &quot;idiosyncratic variant of the bipolar observer/hero narrative&quot;, that is, the novel is structured around the two main characters, Ahab and Ishmael, who are intertwined and contrasted with each other, with Ishmael the observer and narrator. As the story of Ishmael, remarks Robert Milder, it is a &quot;narrative of education&quot;.

Bryant and Springer find that the book is structured around the two consciousnesses of Ahab and Ishmael, with Ahab as a force of linearity and Ishmael a force of digression. While both have an angry sense of being orphaned, they try to come to terms with this hole in their beings in different ways: Ahab with violence, Ishmael with meditation. And while the plot in &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; may be driven by Ahab&#x27;s anger, Ishmael&#x27;s desire to get a hold of the &quot;ungraspable&quot; accounts for the novel&#x27;s lyricism. Buell sees a double quest in the book: Ahab&#x27;s is to hunt Moby Dick, Ishmael&#x27;s is &quot;to understand what to make of both whale and hunt&quot;.

One of the most distinctive features of the book is the variety of genres. Bezanson mentions sermons, dreams, travel account, autobiography, Elizabethan plays, and epic poetry. He calls Ishmael&#x27;s explanatory footnotes to establish the documentary genre &quot;a Nabokovian touch&quot;.

=== Nine meetings with other ships ===
A significant structural device is the series of nine meetings between the &quot;Pequod&quot; and other ships. These meetings are important in three ways. First, their placement in the narrative: the initial two meetings and the last two are both close to each other. The central group of five gams are separated by about 12 chapters. This pattern provides a structural element, remarks Bezanson, as if the encounters were &quot;bones to the book&#x27;s flesh&quot;. Second, Ahab&#x27;s developing responses to the meetings plot the &quot;rising curve of his passion&quot; and of his monomania. Third, in contrast to Ahab, Ishmael interprets the significance of each ship individually: &quot;each ship is a scroll which the narrator unrolls and reads&quot;.

Bezanson sees no single way to account for the meaning of all of these ships. Instead, they may be interpreted as &quot;a group of metaphysical parables, a series of biblical analogues, a masque of the situation confronting man, a pageant of the humors within men, a parade of the nations, and so forth, as well as concrete and symbolic ways of thinking about the White Whale&quot;.

Scholar Nathalia Wright sees the meetings and the significance of the vessels along other lines. She singles out the four vessels which have already encountered Moby Dick. The first, the &quot;Jeroboam&quot;, is named after the predecessor of the biblical King Ahab. Her &quot;prophetic&quot; fate is &quot;a message of warning to all who follow, articulated by Gabriel and vindicated by the &quot;Samuel Enderby&quot;, the &quot;Rachel&quot;, the &quot;Delight&quot;, and at last the &quot;Pequod&quot;&quot;. None of the other ships has been completely destroyed because none of their captains shared Ahab&#x27;s monomania; the fate of the &quot;Jeroboam&quot; reinforces the structural parallel between Ahab and his biblical namesake: &quot;Ahab did more to provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him&quot; (I Kings 16:33).

==Themes==
An early enthusiast for the Melville Revival, British author E. M. Forster remarked in 1927: &quot;&quot;Moby-Dick&quot; is full of meanings: its meaning is a different problem.&quot; Yet he saw as &quot;the essential&quot; in the book &quot;its prophetic song&quot;, which flows &quot;like an undercurrent&quot; beneath the surface action and morality.

The hunt for the whale can be seen as a metaphor for an epistemological questin the words of biographer Laurie Robertson-Lorant, &quot;man&#x27;s search for meaning in a world of deceptive appearances and fatal delusions&quot;. Ishmael&#x27;s taxonomy of whales merely demonstrates &quot;the limitations of scientific knowledge and the impossibility of achieving certainty&quot;. She also contrasts Ishmael&#x27;s and Ahab&#x27;s attitudes toward life, with Ishmael&#x27;s open-minded and meditative, &quot;polypositional stance&quot; as antithetical to Ahab&#x27;s monomania, adhering to dogmatic rigidity.

Melville biographer Andrew Delbanco cites race as an example of this search for truth beneath surface differences, noting that all races are represented among the crew members of the &quot;Pequod&quot;. Although Ishmael initially is afraid of Queequeg as a tattooed possible cannibal, he soon decides that he would &quot;Better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian.&quot; While it may be rare for a mid-19th century American book to feature Black characters in a nonslavery context, slavery is frequently mentioned. The theme of race is carried primarily by Pip, the diminutive Black cabin boy. When Pip has almost drowned, and Ahab, genuinely touched by Pip&#x27;s suffering, questions him gently, Pip &quot;can only parrot the language of an advertisement for the return of a fugitive slave: &#x27;Pip! Reward for Pip!&#x27;&quot;.

Editors Bryant and Springer suggest that perception is a central themethe difficulty of seeing and understanding, which makes deep reality hard to discover and truth hard to pin down. Ahab explains that, like all things, the evil whale wears a disguise: &quot;All visible objects, man, are but pasteboard masks&quot;and Ahab is determined to &quot;strike through the mask! How can the prisoner reach outside, except by thrusting through the wall? To me, the white whale is that wall&quot; (Ch. 36, &quot;The Quarter-Deck&quot;). This theme pervades the novel, perhaps never so emphatically as in &quot;The Doubloon&quot; (Ch. 99), where each crewmember perceives the coin in a way shaped by his own personality. Later, the American edition has Ahab &quot;discover no sign&quot; (Ch. 133) of the whale when he is staring into the deep. In fact, Moby Dick is then swimming up at him. In the British edition, Melville changed the word &quot;discover&quot; to &quot;perceive&quot;, and with good reason, for &quot;discovery&quot; means finding what is already there, but &quot;perceiving&quot;, or better still, perception, is &quot;a matter of shaping what exists by the way in which we see it&quot;. The point is not that Ahab would discover the whale as an object, but that he would perceive it as a symbol of his making.

Yet Melville does not offer easy solutions. Ishmael and Queequeg&#x27;s sensual friendship initiates a kind of racial harmony that is shattered when the crew&#x27;s dancing erupts into racial conflict in &quot;Midnight, Forecastle&quot; (Ch. 40). Fifty chapters later, Pip suffers mental disintegration after he is reminded that as a slave he would be worth less money than a whale. Commodified and brutalized, &quot;Pip becomes the ship&#x27;s conscience&quot;. His views of property are another example of wrestling with moral choice. In Chapter 89, &quot;Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish, Ishmael expounds the legal concept &quot;fast-fish and loose-fish&quot;, which gives right of ownership to those who take possession of an abandoned fish or ship; he compares the concept to events in history, such as the European colonization of the Americas, the partitions of Poland, and the Mexican–American War.

The novel has also been read as critical of the contemporary literary and philosophical movement Transcendentalism, attacking the thought of leading Transcendentalist Ralph Waldo Emerson in particular. The life and death of Ahab has been read as an attack on Emerson&#x27;s philosophy of self-reliance, for one, in its destructive potential and potential justification for egoism. Richard Chase writes that for Melville, &quot;Deathspiritual, emotional, physicalis the price of self-reliance when it is pushed to the point of solipsism, where the world has no existence apart from the all-sufficient self.&quot; In that regard, Chase sees Melville&#x27;s art as antithetical to that of Emerson&#x27;s thought, in that Melville &quot;[points] up the dangers of an exaggerated self-regard, rather than, as ... Emerson loved to do, [suggested] the vital possibilities of the self&quot;. Newton Arvin further suggests that self-reliance was, for Melville, really the &quot;[masquerade in kingly weeds of] a wild egoism, anarchic, irresponsible, and destructive&quot;.

==Style==
&quot;Above all&quot;, say the scholars Bryant and Springer, &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; is language: &quot;nautical, biblical, Homeric, Shakespearean, Miltonic, cetological, alliterative, fanciful, colloquial, archaic and unceasingly allusive&quot;. Melville stretches grammar, quotes well-known or obscure sources, or swings from calm prose to high rhetoric, technical exposition, seaman&#x27;s slang, mystic speculation, or wild prophetic archaism. Melville coined words, critic Newton Arvin recognizes, as if the English vocabulary were too limited for the complex things he had to express. Perhaps the most striking example is the use of verbal nouns, mostly plural, such as &quot;allurings&quot;, &quot;coincidings&quot;, and &quot;leewardings&quot;. Equally abundant are unfamiliar adjectives and adverbs, including participial adjectives such as &quot;officered&quot;, &quot;omnitooled&quot;, and &quot;uncatastrophied&quot;; participial adverbs such as &quot;intermixingly&quot;, &quot;postponedly&quot;, and &quot;uninterpenetratingly&quot;; rarities such as the adjectives &quot;unsmoothable&quot;, &quot;spermy&quot;, and &quot;leviathanic&quot;, and adverbs such as &quot;sultanically&quot;, &quot;Spanishly&quot;, and &quot;Venetianly&quot;; and adjectival compounds ranging from odd to magnificent, such as &quot;the &quot;message-carrying&quot; air&quot;, &quot;the &quot;circus-running&quot; sun&quot;, and &quot;&quot;teeth-tiered&quot; sharks&quot;. It is rarer for Melville to create his own verbs from nouns, but he does this with what Arvin calls &quot;irresistible effect&quot;, such as in &quot;who didst &quot;thunder&quot; him higher than a throne&quot;, and &quot;my fingers ... began ... to &quot;serpentine&quot; and &quot;spiralize&quot;&quot;. For Arvin, the essence of the writing style of &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; lies in

the manner in which the parts of speech are &#x27;intermixingly&#x27; assorted in Melville&#x27;s styleso that the distinction between verbs and nouns, substantives and modifiers, becomes a half unreal onethis is the prime characteristic of his language. No feature of it could express more tellingly the awareness that lies below and behind &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;the awareness that action and condition, movement and stasis, object and idea, are but surface aspects of one underlying reality.

Later critics have expanded Arvin&#x27;s categories. The superabundant vocabulary can be broken down into strategies used individually and in combination. First, the original modification of words as &quot;Leviathanism&quot; and the exaggerated repetition of modified words, as in the series &quot;pitiable&quot;, &quot;pity&quot;, &quot;pitied&quot; and &quot;piteous&quot; (Ch. 81, &quot;The Pequod Meets the Virgin&quot;). Second, the use of existing words in new ways, as when the whale &quot;heaps&quot; and &quot;tasks&quot;. Third, words lifted from specialized fields, as &quot;fossiliferous&quot;. Fourth, the use of unusual adjective-noun combinations, as in &quot;concentrating brow&quot; and &quot;immaculate manliness&quot; (Ch. 26, &quot;Knights and Squires&quot;). Fifth, using the participial modifier to emphasize and to reinforce the already established expectations of the reader, as the words &quot;preluding&quot; and &quot;foreshadowing&quot; (&quot;so still and subdued and yet somehow preluding was all the scene ...&quot;; &quot;In this foreshadowing interval ...&quot;).

Other characteristic stylistic elements are the echoes and overtones, both imitation of distinct styles and habitual use of sources to shape his own work. His three most important sources, in order, are the Bible, Shakespeare, and Milton.

The novel uses several levels of rhetoric. The simplest is &quot;a relatively straightforward &quot;expository&quot; style&quot;, such as in the cetological chapters, though they are &quot;rarely sustained, and serve chiefly as transitions&quot; between more sophisticated levels. A second level is the &quot;poetic&quot;, such as in Ahab&#x27;s quarterdeck monologue, to the point that it can be set as blank verse. Set over a metrical pattern, the rhythms are &quot;evenly controlled—too evenly perhaps for prose&quot;, Bezanson suggests. A third level is the &quot;idiomatic&quot;, and just as the poetic it hardly is present in pure form. Examples of this are &quot;the consistently excellent idiom&quot; of Stubb, such as in the way he encourages the rowing crew in a rhythm of speech that suggests &quot;the beat of the oars takes the place of the metronomic meter&quot;. The fourth and final level of rhetoric is the &quot;composite&quot;, &quot;a magnificent blending&quot; of the first three and possible other elements:

The Nantucketer, he alone resides and riots on the sea; he alone, in Bible language, goes down to it in ships; to and fro ploughing it as his own special plantation. &quot;There&quot; is his home; &quot;there&quot; lies his business, which a Noah&#x27;s flood would not interrupt, though it overwhelmed all the millions in China. He lives on the sea, as prairie cocks in the prairie; he hides among the waves, he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the Alps. For years he knows not the land; so that when he comes to it at last, it smells like another world, more strangely than the moon would to an Earthsman. With the landless gull, that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows; so at nightfall, the Nantucketer, out of sight of land, furls his sails, and lays him to his rest, while under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales.
(&quot;Nantucket&quot;, Ch. 14).

Bezanson calls this chapter a comical &quot;prose poem&quot; that blends &quot;high and low with a relaxed assurance&quot;. Similar passages include the &quot;marvelous hymn to spiritual democracy&quot; in the middle of &quot;Knights and Squires&quot;.

The elaborate use of the Homeric simile may not have been learned from Homer himself, yet Matthiessen finds the writing &quot;more consistently alive&quot; on the Homeric than on the Shakespearean level, especially during the final chase the &quot;controlled accumulation&quot; of such similes emphasizes Ahab&#x27;s hubris through a succession of land-images, for instance: &quot;The ship tore on; leaving such a furrow in the sea as when a cannon-ball, missent, becomes a ploughshare and turns up the level field&quot; (&quot;The Chase – Second Day&quot;, Ch. 134). A paragraph-long simile describes how the 30 men of the crew became a single unit:

For as the one ship that held them all; though it was put together of all contrasting things—oak, and maple, and pine wood; iron, and pitch, and hemp—yet all these ran into each other in the one concrete hull, which shot on its way, both balanced and directed by the long central keel; even so, all the individualities of the crew, this man&#x27;s valor, that man&#x27;s fear; guilt and guiltiness, all varieties were welded into oneness, and were all directed to that fatal goal which Ahab their one lord and keel did point to.
(&quot;The Chase – Second Day&quot;, Ch. 134).

The final phrase fuses the two halves of the comparison; the men become identical with the ship, which follows Ahab&#x27;s direction. The concentration only gives way to more imagery: the &quot;mastheads, like the tops of tall palms, were outspreadingly tufted with arms and legs&quot;. All these images contribute their &quot;startling energy&quot; to the advance of the narrative. When the boats are lowered, the imagery serves to dwarf everything but Ahab&#x27;s will in the presence of Moby Dick. These similes, with their astonishing &quot;imaginative abundance,&quot; not only create dramatic movement, Matthiessen observes: &quot;They are no less notable for breadth; and the more sustained among them, for an heroic dignity.&quot;

===Assimilation of Shakespeare===
F. O. Matthiessen, in 1941, declared that Melville&#x27;s &quot;possession by Shakespeare went far beyond all other influences&quot; in that it made Melville discover his own full strength &quot;through the challenge of the most abundant imagination in history&quot;. This insight was then reinforced by the study of Melville&#x27;s annotatations in his reading copy of Shakespeare, which show that he immersed himself in Shakespeare when he was preparing for &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;, especially &quot;King Lear&quot; and &quot;Macbeth&quot;. Reading Shakespeare, Matthiessen observes, was &quot;a catalytic agent&quot;, one that transformed his writing &quot;from limited reporting to the expression of profound natural forces&quot;.

The creation of Ahab, Melville biographer Leon Howard discovered, followed an observation by Coleridge in his lecture on &quot;Hamlet&quot;: &quot;one of Shakespeare&#x27;s modes of creating characters is to conceive any one intellectual or moral faculty in &quot;morbid&quot; excess, and then to place himself. ... thus &quot;mutilated&quot; or &quot;diseased&quot;, under given circumstances&quot;. Coleridge&#x27;s vocabulary is echoed in some phrases that describe Ahab. Ahab seemed to have &quot;what seems a half-wilful &quot;over-ruling morbidness&quot; at the bottom of his nature&quot;, and &quot;all men tragically great&quot;, Melville added, &quot;are made so through a certain &quot;morbidness&quot;; &quot;all mortal greatness is but &quot;disease&quot;&quot;. In addition to this, in Howard&#x27;s view, the self-references of Ishmael as a &quot;tragic dramatist&quot;, and his defense of his choice of a hero who lacked &quot;all outward majestical trappings&quot; is evidence that Melville &quot;consciously thought of his protagonist as a tragic hero of the sort found in &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;King Lear&quot;&quot;.

Matthiessen demonstrates the extent to which Melville was in full possession of his powers in the description of Ahab, which ends in language
that suggests Shakespeare&#x27;s but is not an imitation of it: &#x27;Oh, Ahab! what shall be grand in thee, it must needs be plucked from the skies and dived for in the deep, and featured in the unbodied air!&#x27; The imaginative richness of the final phrase seems particularly Shakespearean, &quot;but its two key words appear only once each in the plays ... and to neither of these usages is Melville indebted for his fresh combination&quot;.

Melville&#x27;s assimilation of Shakespeare, Matthiessen concludes, gave &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; &quot;a kind of diction that depended upon no source&quot;, and that could, as D.H. Lawrence put it, convey something &quot;almost superhuman or inhuman, bigger than life&quot;. The prose is not based on anybody else&#x27;s verse but on &quot;a sense of speech rhythm&quot;.

Matthiessen finds debts to Shakespeare, whether hard or easy to recognize, on almost every page. He points out that the phrase &quot;mere sounds, full of Leviathanism, but signifying nothing&quot; at the end of &quot;Cetology&quot; (Ch.32) echoes the famous phrase in &quot;Macbeth&quot;: &quot;Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing.&quot; Matthiessen shows that Ahab&#x27;s first extended speech to the crew, in the &quot;Quarter-Deck&quot; (Ch.36), is &quot;virtually blank verse, and can be printed as such&quot;:

In addition to this sense of rhythm, Matthiessen shows that Melville &quot;now mastered Shakespeare&#x27;s mature secret of how to make language itself dramatic&quot;. He had learned three essential things, Matthiessen sums up:

* To rely on verbs of action, &quot;which lend their dynamic pressure to both movement and meaning&quot;. The effective tension caused by the contrast of &quot;thou launchest navies of full-freighted worlds&quot; and &quot;there&#x27;s that in here that still remains indifferent&quot; in &quot;The Candles&quot; (Ch. 119) makes the last clause lead to a &quot;compulsion to strike the breast&quot;, which suggests &quot;how thoroughly the drama has come to inhere in the words&quot;.
* The Shakespearean energy of verbal compounds was not lost on him (&quot;full-freighted&quot;).
* Finally: Melville learned how to handle &quot;the quickened sense of life that comes from making one part of speech act as anotherfor example, &#x27;earthquake&#x27; as an adjective, or the coining of &#x27;placeless&#x27;, an adjective from a noun&quot;.

=== Thomas Carlyle ===
Critics have seen parallels between &quot;Moby Dick&quot; and Thomas Carlyle&#x27;s work, particularly &quot;Sartor Resartus&quot; (1833–34), &quot;On Heroes, Hero-Worship, &amp; the Heroic in History&quot; (1841) and the &quot;Critical and Miscellaneous Essays&quot;, which Melville read while writing the novel. James Barbour and biographer Leon Howard write that &quot;Carlyle&#x27;s rhetoric is reflected&quot; in much of the dialogue of Ahab and Ishmael, while Melville uses &quot;Sartor&quot;″s philosophical concepts of &quot;an emblematic universe&quot; and a &quot;weaver god&quot; &quot;almost in Carlyle&#x27;s words&quot;. Alexander Welsh argues that Carlyle figured &quot;largely in the undertaking of &quot;Moby Dick&quot;&quot;, noting that the &quot;figure of the sheep in &#x27;The Funeral&#x27; ... is taken directly from Carlyle&quot;, specifically the essay &quot;Boswell&#x27;s Life of Johnson&quot; (1832) and that the &quot;language of herring and whales, fleets and commodores&quot; may have been borrowed from &quot;Sartor&quot;. According to Paul Giles, &quot;Sartor&quot; &quot;furnished Melville with a prototype for his playful iconoclastic style in &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;&quot;, particularly in its narrative strategy and romantic ironic paradoxes. The &quot;shared use of the clothing metaphor&quot; is also inspired by &quot;Sartor&quot;.

Jonathan Arac sees in &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; &quot;a direct appropriation&quot; of Carlyle&#x27;s &quot;Hero&quot;. &quot;Ahab&quot;, writes Arac, &quot;is very much a Carlylean hero&quot;, which Carlyle&#x27;s &quot;romantic image of Cromwell helped Melville to create&quot;. Carlyle&#x27;s portraits of Dante Alighieri and Shakespeare in &quot;The Hero as Poet&quot;, the third lecture of &quot;On Heroes&quot;, &quot;offered models that helped Melville to develop as a reader and to achieve the definition of himself as a writer that made &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; possible&quot;.

===Renaissance humanism===
During the composition of &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; Melville also read Renaissance Humanists such as Thomas Browne, Robert Burton, and Rabelais. Hershel Parker notes that Melville adopted not only their poetic and conversational prose styles, but also their skeptical attitudes towards religion. Browne&#x27;s statement &quot;I love to lose my selfe in a mystery to pursue my reason to an &quot;ob altitudo&quot;&quot; mirrors both in ethos and poetics Ishmael&#x27;s &quot;I love to sail forbidden seas, and land on barbarous coasts. Not ignoring what is good, I am quick to perceive a horror, and could still be social with it.&quot;

Ishmael also mirrors the epistemological uncertainty of Renaissance humanists. For example, Browne argues that &quot;where there is an obscurity too deepe for our reason ...[reason] becomes more humble and submissive unto the subtilties of faith ... I believe there was already a tree whose fruit our unhappy parents tasted, though in the same chapter, when God forbids it, &#x27;tis positivley said, the plants of the field were not yet growne.&quot; Ishmael similarly embraces paradox when he proclaims &quot;Doubts of all things earthly, and intuitions of some things heavenly; this combination makes neither believer nor infidel, but makes a man who regards them both with equal eye.&quot;

Scholars have also called attention to similarities between Melville&#x27;s style and that of Robert Burton in &quot;Anatomy of Melancholy&quot;. William Engel notes that Melville had Burton&#x27;s book at his side, and says &quot;this encyclopedic work will serve as a conceptual touchstone for analyzing his looking back to an earlier aesthetic practice.&quot; Additionally, Hershel Parker writes that in 1847, &quot;Anatomy of Melancholy&quot; served as Melville&#x27;s &quot;sonorous textbook on morbid psychology&quot; and in the following year he bought a set of Michel de Montaigne&#x27;s works. In the &quot;Essays&quot; he found &quot;a worldly wise skepticism that braced him against the superficial pieties demanded by his time&quot;. Melville then read Browne&#x27;s &quot;Religio Medici&quot; which he adored, describing Browne to a friend as &quot;a kind of &#x27;crack&#x27;d archangel&#x27;&quot;.

==Background==

===Autobiographical elements===
&quot;Moby-Dick&quot; draws on Melville&#x27;s experience on the whaler &quot;Acushnet&quot;, but is not autobiographical. On December 30, 1840, Melville signed on as a green hand for the maiden voyage of the &quot;Acushnet&quot;, planned to last for 52 months. Its owner, Melvin O. Bradford, like Bildad, was a Quaker: on several instances when he signed documents, he erased the word &quot;swear&quot; and replaced it with &quot;affirm&quot;. However, the shareholders of the &quot;Acushnet&quot; were relatively wealthy, whereas the owners of the &quot;Pequod&quot; included poor widows and orphaned children.

The model for the Whaleman&#x27;s Chapel of chapter 7 is the Seamen&#x27;s Bethel on Johnny Cake Hill. Melville attended a service there shortly before he shipped out on the &quot;Acushnet&quot;, and he heard a sermon by Reverend Enoch Mudge, who is at least in part the inspiration for Father Mapple. Even the topic of Jonah and the Whale may be authentic, for Mudge contributed sermons on Jonah to &quot;Sailor&#x27;s Magazine&quot;.

The crew was not as heterogenous or exotic as the crew of the &quot;Pequod&quot;. Five were foreigners, four of them Portuguese, and the others were American either at birth or naturalized. Three black men were in the crew, two seamen and the cook. Fleece, the black cook of the &quot;Pequod&quot;, was probably modeled on this Philadelphia-born William Maiden. A first mate, actually called Edward C. Starbuck was discharged at Tahiti under mysterious circumstances. The second mate, John Hall, is identified as Stubb in an annotation in the book&#x27;s copy of crew member Henry Hubbard, who also identified the model for Pip: John Backus, a little black man added to the crew during the voyage. Hubbard witnessed Pip&#x27;s fall into the water.

Ahab seems to have had no model, though his death may have been based on an actual event. Melville was aboard &quot;The Star&quot; in May 1843 with two sailors from the &quot;Nantucket&quot; who could have told him that they had seen their second mate &quot;taken out of a whaleboat by a foul line and drowned&quot;.

===Whaling sources===

In addition to his own experience on the whaling ship &quot;Acushnet&quot;, two actual events served as the genesis for Melville&#x27;s tale. One was the sinking of the Nantucket ship &quot;Essex&quot; in 1820, after a sperm whale rammed her 2,000 miles (3,200 km) from the western coast of South America. First mate Owen Chase, one of eight survivors, recorded the events in his 1821 &quot;Narrative of the Most Extraordinary and Distressing Shipwreck of the Whale-Ship Essex&quot;.

The other event was the alleged killing in the late 1830s of the albino sperm whale Mocha Dick, in the waters off the Chilean island of Mocha. Mocha Dick was rumored to have 20 or so harpoons in his back from other whalers, and appeared to attack ships with premeditated ferocity. One of his battles with a whaler served as subject for an article by explorer J. N. Reynolds in the May 1839 issue of &quot;The Knickerbocker or New-York Monthly Magazine&quot;. Melville was familiar with the article, which described:

Significantly, Reynolds writes a first-person narration that serves as a frame for the story of a whaling captain he meets. The captain resembles Ahab and suggests a similar symbolism and single-minded motivation in hunting this whale, in that when his crew first encounters Mocha Dick and cowers from him, the captain rallies them:

Mocha Dick had over 100 encounters with whalers in the decades between 1810 and the 1830s. He was described as being gigantic and covered in barnacles. Although he was the most famous, Mocha Dick was not the only white whale in the sea, nor the only whale to attack hunters.

While an accidental collision with a sperm whale at night accounted for sinking of the &quot;Union&quot; in 1807, it was not until August 1851 that the whaler &quot;Ann Alexander&quot;, while hunting in the Pacific off the Galápagos Islands, became the second vessel since the &quot;Essex&quot; to be attacked, holed, and sunk by a whale. Melville remarked, &quot;Ye Gods! What a commentator is this &quot;Ann Alexander&quot; whale. What he has to say is short &amp; pithy &amp; very much to the point. I wonder if my evil art has raised this monster.&quot;

While Melville had already drawn on his different sailing experiences in his previous novels, such as &quot;Mardi&quot;, he had never focused specifically on whaling. The 18 months he spent as an ordinary seaman aboard the whaler &quot;Acushnet&quot; in 1841–42, and one incident in particular, now served as inspiration. During a mid-ocean &quot;gam&quot; (rendezvous at sea between ships), he met Chase&#x27;s son William, who lent him his father&#x27;s book. Melville later wrote:

The book was out of print, and rare. Melville let his interest in the book be known to his father-in-law, Lemuel Shaw, whose friend in Nantucket procured an imperfect but clean copy which Shaw gave to Melville in April 1851. Melville read this copy avidly, made copious notes in it, and had it bound, keeping it in his library for the rest of his life.

&quot;Moby-Dick&quot; contains large sections, most of which are narrated by Ishmael, that seemingly have nothing to do with the plot, but describe aspects of the whaling business. Although a successful earlier novel about Nantucket whalers had been written, &quot;Miriam Coffin or The Whale-Fisherman&quot; (1835) by Joseph C. Hart, which is credited with influencing elements of Melville&#x27;s work, most accounts of whaling tended to be sensational tales of bloody mutiny. Melville believed that no book up to that time had portrayed the whaling industry in as fascinating or immediate a way as he had experienced it.

Melville found the bulk of his data on whales and whaling in five books, the most important of which was by the English ship&#x27;s surgeon Thomas Beale, &quot;Natural History of the Sperm Whale&quot; (1839), a book of reputed authority which Melville bought on July 10, 1850. &quot;In scale and complexity,&quot; scholar Steven Olsen-Smith writes, &quot;the significance of [this source] to the composition of &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; surpasses that of any other source book from which Melville is known to have drawn.&quot; According to scholar Howard P. Vincent, the general influence of this source is to supply the arrangement of whaling data in chapter groupings. Melville followed Beale&#x27;s grouping closely, yet adapted it to what art demanded, and he changed the original&#x27;s prosaic phrases into graphic figures of speech. The second most important whaling book is Frederick Debell Bennett, &quot;A Whaling Voyage Round the Globe, from the Year 1833 to 1836&quot; (1840), from which Melville also took the chapter organization, but in a lesser degree than he learned from Beale.

The third book was the one Melville reviewed for the &quot;Literary World&quot; in 1847, J. Ross Browne&#x27;s &quot;Etchings of a Whaling Cruise&quot; (1846), which may have given Melville the first thought for a whaling book, and in any case contains passages embarrassingly similar to passages in &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;. The fourth book, Reverend Henry T. Cheever&#x27;s &quot;The Whale and His Captors&quot; (1850), was used for two episodes in &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; but probably appeared too late in the writing of the novel to be of much more use. Melville did plunder a fifth book, William Scoresby Jr., &quot;An Account of the Arctic Regions with a History and Description of the Northern Whale Fishery&quot; (1820), though—unlike the other four books—its subject is the Greenland whale rather than the sperm whale. Although the book became the standard whaling reference soon after publication, Melville satirized and parodied it on several occasions—for instance in the description of narwhales in the chapter &quot;Cetology&quot;, where he called Scoresby &quot;Charley Coffin&quot; and gave his account &quot;a humorous twist of fact&quot;: &quot;Scoresby will help out Melville several times, and on each occasion Melville will satirize him under a pseudonym.&quot; Vincent suggests several reasons for Melville&#x27;s attitude towards Scoresby, including his dryness and abundance of irrelevant data, but the major reason seems to have been that the Greenland whale was the sperm whale&#x27;s closest competitor for the public&#x27;s attention, so Melville felt obliged to dismiss anything dealing with it.

In addition to cetological works, Melville also consulted scattered literary works that mention or discuss whales, as the opening &quot;Extracts&quot; section of the novel demonstrates. For instance, Thomas Browne&#x27;s essay &quot;Of Sperma-Ceti, and the Sperma-Ceti Whale&quot; from his &quot;Pseudodoxia Epidemica&quot; is consulted not only in the extracts but also in the chapter titled &quot;Cetology&quot;. Ishmael notes: &quot;Many are the men, small and great, old and new, landsmen and seamen, who have at large or in little, written of the whale. Run over a few:—The Authors of the Bible; Aristotle; Pliny; Aldrovandi; Sir Thomas Browne.&quot; Browne&#x27;s playful examination of whales, which values philosophical interpretations over scientifically accurate examinations, helped shape the novel&#x27;s style. Browne&#x27;s comment on &quot;the [Sperm-Whale&#x27;s] eyes but small, the pizell [penis] large, and prominent&quot; likely helped shape the comical chapter concerning whale penises, &quot;The Cassock&quot;.

===Composition===

Scholars have concluded that Melville composed &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; in two or even three stages. Reasoning from biographical evidence, analysis of the functions of characters, and a series of unexplained but perhaps meaningful inconsistencies in the final version, they hypothesize that reading Shakespeare and his new friendship with Hawthorne, in the words of Lawrence Buell, inspired Melville to rewrite a &quot;relatively straightforward&quot; whaling adventure into &quot;an epic of cosmic encyclopedic proportions&quot;.

The earliest surviving mention of what became &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; is a letter Melville wrote to Richard Henry Dana Jr. on May 1, 1850:

Bezanson objects that the letter contains too many ambiguities to assume &quot;that Dana&#x27;s &#x27;suggestion&#x27; would obviously be that Melville do for whaling what he had done for life on a man-of-war in &quot;White-Jacket&quot;. Dana had experienced how incomparable Melville was in dramatic storytelling when he met him in Boston, so perhaps &quot;his &#x27;suggestion&#x27; was that Melville do a book that captured that gift&quot;. And the long sentence in the middle of the above quotation simply acknowledges that Melville is struggling with the problem, not of choosing between fact and fancy but of how to interrelate them. The most positive statements are that it will be a strange sort of a book and that Melville means to give the truth of the thing, but what thing exactly is not clear.

Melville may have found the plot before writing or developed it after the writing process was underway. Considering his elaborate use of sources, &quot;it is safe to say&quot; that they helped him shape the narrative, its plot included. Scholars John Bryant and Haskell Springer cite the development of the character Ishmael as another factor which prolonged Melville&#x27;s process of composition and which can be deduced from the structure of the final version of the book. Ishmael, in the early chapters, is simply the narrator, just as the narrators in Melville&#x27;s earlier sea adventures had been, but in later chapters becomes a mystical stage manager who is central to the tragedy.

Less than two months after mentioning the project to Dana, Melville reported in a letter of June 27 to Richard Bentley, his English publisher:

Nathaniel Hawthorne and his family had moved to a small red farmhouse near Lenox, Massachusetts, at the end of March 1850. He met Melville on August 5, 1850, when the authors met at a picnic hosted by a mutual friend that included, among others, Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. and James T. Fields. Melville wrote an unsigned review of Hawthorne&#x27;s short story collection &quot;Mosses from an Old Manse&quot; titled &quot;Hawthorne and His Mosses&quot;, which appeared in &quot;The Literary World&quot; on August 17 and 24. Bezanson finds the essay &quot;so deeply related to Melville&#x27;s imaginative and intellectual world while writing &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;&quot; that it could be regarded as a virtual preface and should be &quot;everybody&#x27;s prime piece of contextual reading&quot;. In the essay, Melville compares Hawthorne to Shakespeare and Dante, and his &quot;self-projection&quot; is evident in the repeats of the word &quot;genius&quot;, the more than two dozen references to Shakespeare, and in the insistence that Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;unapproachability&quot; is nonsense for an American.

The most intense work on the book was done during the winter of 1850–1851, when Melville had changed the noise of New York City for a farm in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. The move may well have delayed finishing the book. During these months, he wrote several excited letters to Hawthorne, including one of June 1851 in which he summarizes his career: &quot;What I feel most moved to write, that is banned,—it will not pay. Yet, altogether, write the &quot;other&quot; way I cannot. So the product is a final hash, and all my books are botches.&quot;

This is the stubborn Melville who stood by &quot;Mardi&quot; and talked about his other, more commercial books with contempt. The letter also reveals how Melville experienced his development from his 25th year: &quot;Three weeks have scarcely passed, at any time between then and now, that I have not unfolded within myself. But I feel that I am now come to the inmost leaf of the bulb, and that shortly the flower must fall to the mould.&quot;

Buell finds the evidence that Melville changed his ambitions during writing &quot;on the whole convincing&quot;, since the impact of Shakespeare and Hawthorne was &quot;surely monumental&quot;, but others challenge the theories of the composition in three ways. The first raises objections on the use of evidence and the evidence itself. Bryant finds &quot;little concrete evidence, and nothing at all conclusive, to show that Melville radically altered the structure or conception of the book&quot;. and scholar Robert Milder sees &quot;insufficient evidence and doubtful methodology&quot; at work. A second type of objection is based on assumptions about Melville&#x27;s intellectual development. Bryant and Springer object to the conclusion that Hawthorne inspired Melville to write Ahab&#x27;s tragic obsession into the book; Melville already had experienced other encounters which could just as well have triggered his imagination, such as the Bible&#x27;s Jonah and Job, Milton&#x27;s Satan, Shakespeare&#x27;s King Lear, Byron&#x27;s heroes. Bezanson is also not convinced that before he met Hawthorne, &quot;Melville was &quot;not&quot; ready for the kind of book &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; became&quot;, because in his letters from the time Melville denounces his last two &quot;straight narratives, &quot;Redburn&quot; and &quot;White-Jacket&quot;, as two books written just for the money, and he firmly stood by &quot;Mardi&quot; as the kind of book he believed in. His language is already &quot;richly steeped in 17th-century mannerisms&quot;, characteristics of &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;. A third type calls upon the literary nature of passages used as evidence. According to Milder, the cetological chapters cannot be leftovers from an earlier stage of composition and any theory that they are &quot;will eventually founder on the stubborn meaningfulness of these chapters&quot;, because no scholar adhering to the theory has yet explained how these chapters &quot;can bear intimate thematic relation to a symbolic story not yet conceived&quot;.

Buell finds that theories based on a combination of selected passages from letters and what are perceived as &quot;loose ends&quot; in the book not only &quot;tend to dissolve into guesswork&quot;, but he also suggests that these so-called loose ends may be intended by the author: repeatedly the book mentions &quot;the necessary unfinishedness of immense endeavors&quot;.

==Publication history==
Melville first proposed the British publication in a June 27, 1850, letter to Richard Bentley, London publisher of his earlier works. Textual scholar G. Thomas Tanselle said that, in these earlier books, American proof sheets had been sent to the British publisher and that publication in the United States did not commence until the work had been set in type and published in England. This procedure was intended to provide the best (though still uncertain) claim for the UK copyright of an American work. In the case of &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;, Melville had taken almost a year longer than promised, and could not rely on Harpers to prepare the proofs as they had done for the earlier books. Indeed, Harpers had denied him an advance, and since he was already in debt to them for almost $700, he was forced to borrow money and to arrange for the typesetting and plating himself. John Bryant suggests that he did so &quot;to reduce the number of hands playing with his text&quot;.

The final stages of composition overlapped with the early stages of publication. At the end of May 1851, Melville delivered the bulk of his manuscript to Harper&#x27;s for plating and printing of proof sheets. In June, he wrote to Hawthorne that he was in New York to &quot;work and slave on my &#x27;Whale&#x27; while it is driving through the press&quot;. He was staying with Allan and Sophia in a small room to correct proofs, and to (re)write the closing pages. By the end of the month, &quot;wearied with the long delay of printers&quot;, Melville came back to finish work on the book in Pittsfield. Three weeks later, the typesetting was almost done, as he announced to Bentley on July 20: &quot;I am now passing thro&#x27; the press, the closing sheets of my new work&quot;. While Melville was simultaneously writing and proofreading what had been set, the corrected proof would be plated, that is, the type fixed in final form. Since earlier chapters were already plated when he was revising the later ones, Melville must have &quot;felt restricted in the kinds of revisions that were feasible&quot;.

On July 3, 1851, Bentley offered Melville £150 and &quot;half profits&quot;, that is, half the profits that remained after the expenses of production and advertising. On July 20, Melville accepted, after which Bentley drew up a contract on August 13. Melville signed and returned the contract in early September, and then went to New York with the proof sheets, made from the finished plates, which he sent to London by his brother Allan on September 10. For over a month, these proofs had been in Melville&#x27;s possession, and because the book would be set anew in London he could devote all his time to correcting and revising them. He still had no American publisher, so the usual hurry about getting the British publication to precede the American was not present. Only on September 12 was the Harper publishing contract signed. Bentley received the proof sheets with Melville&#x27;s corrections and revisions marked on them on September 24. He published the book less than four weeks later.

In the October 1851 issue of &quot;Harper&#x27;s New Monthly Magazine&quot; &quot;The Town Ho&#x27;s Story&quot; was published, with a footnote reading: &quot;From &#x27;The Whale&#x27;. The title of a new work by Mr. Melville, in the press of Harper and Brothers, and now publishing in London by Mr. Bentley.&quot;

On October 18, the British edition, &quot;The Whale&quot;, was published in a printing of only 500 copies, fewer than Melville&#x27;s previous books. Their slow sales had convinced Bentley that a smaller number was more realistic. The London &quot;Morning Herald&quot; on October 20 printed the earliest known review. On November 14, the American edition, &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;, was published and the same day reviewed in both the Albany &quot;Argus&quot; and the &quot;Morning Courier and New-York Enquirer&quot;. On November 19, Washington received the copy to be deposited for copyright purposes. The first American printing of 2,915 copies was almost the same as the first of &quot;Mardi&quot;, but the first printing of Melville&#x27;s other three Harper books had been a thousand copies more.

===Melville&#x27;s revisions and British editorial revisions===

The British edition, set by Bentley&#x27;s printers from the American page proofs with Melville&#x27;s revisions and corrections, differs from the American edition in over 700 wordings and thousands of punctuation and spelling changes.

Excluding the preliminaries and the one extract, the three volumes of the British edition came to 927 pages and the single American volume to 635 pages. Accordingly, the dedication to Hawthorne in the American edition—&quot;this book is inscribed to&quot;—became &quot;these volumes are inscribed to&quot; in the British. The table of contents in the British edition generally follows the actual chapter titles in the American edition, but 19 titles in the American table of contents differ from the titles above the chapters themselves. This list was probably drawn up by Melville himself: the titles of chapters describing encounters of the &quot;Pequod&quot; with other ships had—apparently to stress the parallelisms between these chapters—been standardized to &quot;The Pequod meets the ...,&quot; with the exception of the already published &#x27;The Town-Ho&#x27;s Story&#x27;.

For unknown reasons, the &quot;Etymology&quot; and &quot;Extracts&quot; were moved to the end of the third volume. An epigraph from &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, taken from the second of the two quotations from that work in the American edition, appears on the title page of each of the three British volumes. Melville&#x27;s involvement with this rearrangement is not clear: if it was Bentley&#x27;s gesture toward accommodating Melville, as Tanselle suggests, its selection put an emphasis on the quotation Melville might not have agreed with.

The largest of Melville&#x27;s revisions is the addition to the British edition of a 139-word footnote in Chapter 87 explaining the word &quot;gally&quot;. The edition also contains six short phrases and some 60 single words lacking in the American edition. In addition, about 35 changes produce genuine improvements, as opposed to mere corrections: &quot;Melville may not have made every one of the changes in this category, but it seems certain that he was responsible for the great majority of them.&quot;

===British censorship and missing &quot;Epilogue&quot;===
The British publisher hired one or more revisers who were, in the evaluation of scholar Steven Olsen-Smith, responsible for &quot;unauthorized changes ranging from typographical errors and omissions to acts of outright censorship&quot;. According to biographer Robertson-Lorant, the result was that the British edition was &quot;badly mutilated&quot;. The expurgations fall into four categories, ranked according to the apparent priorities of the censor:

# Sacrilegious passages, more than 1,200 words: Attributing human failures to God was grounds for excision or revision, as was comparing human shortcomings to divine ones. For example, in chapter 28, &quot;Ahab&quot;, Ahab stands with &quot;a crucifixion in his face&quot; was revised to &quot;an apparently eternal anguish&quot;;
# Sexual matters, including the sex life of whales and even Ishmael&#x27;s worried anticipation of the nature of Queequeg&#x27;s underwear, as well as allusions to fornication or harlots, and &quot;our hearts&#x27; honeymoon&quot; (in relation to Ishmael and Queequeg). Chapter 95, however, &quot;The Cassock&quot;, referring to the whale&#x27;s genital organ, was untouched, perhaps because of Melville&#x27;s indirect language.
# Remarks &quot;belittling royalty or implying a criticism of the British&quot;: This meant the exclusion of the complete chapter 25, a &quot;Postscript&quot; on the use of sperm oil at coronations;
# Perceived grammatical or stylistic anomalies were treated with &quot;a highly conservative interpretation of rules of &#x27;correctness.

These expurgations also meant that any corrections or revisions Melville had marked upon these passages are now lost.

The final difference in the material not already plated is that the &quot;Epilogue&quot;, thus Ishmael&#x27;s miraculous survival, is omitted from the British edition. Obviously, the epilogue was not an afterthought supplied too late for the edition, for it is referred to in &quot;The Castaway&quot;: &quot;in the sequel of the narrative, it will then be seen what like abandonment befell myself.&quot; Why the &quot;Epilogue&quot; is missing is unknown. Since nothing objectionable was in it, most likely it was somehow lost by Bentley&#x27;s printer when the &quot;Etymology&quot; and &quot;Extracts&quot; were moved.

===Last-minute change of title===
After the sheets had been sent, Melville changed the title. Probably late in September, Allan sent Bentley two pages of proof with a letter of which only a draft survives which informed him that Melville &quot;has determined upon a new title &amp; dedication—Enclosed you have proof of both—It is thought here that the new title will be a better &quot;selling&quot; title&quot;. After expressing his hope that Bentley would receive this change in time, Allan said that &quot;Moby-Dick is a legitimate title for the book, being the name given to a particular whale who if I may so express myself is the hero of the volume&quot;. Biographer Hershel Parker suggests that the reason for the change was that Harper&#x27;s had two years earlier published a book with a similar title, &quot;The Whale and His Captors&quot;.

Changing the title was not a problem for the American edition, since the running heads throughout the book only showed the titles of the chapters, and the title page, which would include the publisher&#x27;s name, could not be printed until a publisher was found. In October &quot;Harper&#x27;s New Monthly Magazine&quot; printed chapter 54, &quot;The Town-Ho&#x27;s Story&quot;, with a footnote saying: &quot;From &quot;The Whale.&quot; The title of a new work by Mr. Melville&quot;. The one surviving leaf of proof, &quot;a &#x27;trial&#x27; page bearing the title &#x27;The Whale&#x27; and the Harper imprint,&quot; shows that at this point, after the publisher had been found, the original title still stood. When Allan&#x27;s letter arrived, no sooner than early October, Bentley had already announced &quot;The Whale&quot; in both the &quot;Athenaem&quot; and the &quot;Spectator&quot; of October 4 and 11. Probably to accommodate Melville, Bentley inserted a half-title page in the first volume only, which reads &quot;The Whale; or, Moby Dick&quot;.

===Sales and earnings===
The British printing of 500 copies sold fewer than 300 within the first four months. In 1852, some remaining sheets were bound in a cheaper casing, and in 1853, enough sheets were still left to issue a cheap edition in one volume. Bentley recovered only half on the £150 he advanced Melville, whose share from actual sales would have been just £38, and he did not print a new edition. Harper&#x27;s first printing was 2,915 copies, including the standard 125 review copies. The selling price was $1.50, about a fifth of the price of the British three-volume edition.

About 1,500 copies were sold within 11 days, and then sales slowed down to less than 300 the next year. After three years, the first edition was still available, almost 300 copies of which were lost when a fire broke out at the firm in December 1853. In 1855, a second printing of 250 copies was issued, in 1863, a third of 253 copies, and finally in 1871, a fourth printing of 277 copies, which sold so slowly that no new printing was ordered. &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; was out of print during the last four years of Melville&#x27;s life, having sold 2,300 in its first year and a half and on average 27 copies a year for the next 34 years, totaling 3,215 copies.

Melville&#x27;s earnings from the book add up to $1,260: the £150 advance from Bentley was equivalent to $703, and the American printings earned him $556, which was $100 less than he earned from any of his five previous books. Melville&#x27;s widow received another $81 when the United States Book Company issued the book and sold almost 1,800 copies between 1892 and 1898.

==Reception==
The reception of &quot;The Whale&quot; in Britain and of &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; in the United States differed in two ways, according to Parker. First, British literary criticism was more sophisticated and developed than in the still-young republic, with British reviewing done by &quot;cadres of brilliant literary people&quot; who were &quot;experienced critics and trenchant prose stylists&quot;, while the United States had only &quot;a handful of reviewers&quot; capable enough to be called critics, and American editors and reviewers habitually echoed British opinion. American reviewing was mostly delegated to &quot;newspaper staffers&quot; or else by &quot;amateur contributors more noted for religious piety than critical acumen.&quot; Second, the differences between the two editions caused &quot;two distinct critical receptions.&quot;

=== British ===
Twenty-one reviews appeared in London, and later one in Dublin. The British reviewers, according to Parker, mostly regarded &quot;The Whale&quot; as &quot;a phenomenal literary work, a philosophical, metaphysical, and poetic romance&quot;. The &quot;Morning Advertiser&quot; for October 24 was in awe of Melville&#x27;s learning, of his &quot;dramatic ability for producing a prose poem&quot;, and of the whale adventures which were &quot;powerful in their cumulated horrors.&quot; To its surprise, &quot;John Bull&quot; found &quot;philosophy in whales&quot; and &quot;poetry in blubber&quot;, and concluded that few books that claimed to be either philosophical or literary works &quot;contain as much true philosophy and as much genuine poetry as the tale of the &quot;Pequod&quot;″s whaling expedition&quot;, making it a work &quot;far beyond the level of an ordinary work of fiction&quot;. The &quot;Morning Post&quot; found it &quot;one of the cleverest, wittiest, and most amusing of modern books&quot;, and predicted that it was a book &quot;which will do great things for the literary reputation of its author&quot;.

Melville himself never saw these reviews, and Parker calls it a &quot;bitter irony&quot; that the reception overseas was &quot;all he could possibly have hoped for, short of a few conspicuous proclamations that the distance between him and Shakespeare was by no means immeasurable.&quot;

One of the earliest reviews, by the extremely conservative critic Henry Chorley in the highly regarded London &quot;Athenaeum&quot;, described it as

According to the London &quot;Literary Gazette and Journal of Science and Art&quot; for December 6, 1851, &quot;Mr. Melville cannot do without savages, so he makes half of his &quot;dramatis personae&quot; wild Indians, Malays, and other untamed humanities&quot;, who appeared in &quot;an odd book, professing to be a novel; wantonly eccentric, outrageously bombastic; in places charmingly and vividly descriptive&quot;. Most critics regretted the extravagant digressions because they distracted from an otherwise interesting and even exciting narrative, but even critics who did not like the book as a whole praised Melville&#x27;s originality of imagination and expression.

Because the English edition omitted the epilogue describing Ishmael&#x27;s escape, British reviewers read a book with a first-person narrator who apparently did not survive. The reviewer of the &quot;Literary Gazette&quot; asked how Ishmael, &quot;who appears to have been drowned with the rest, communicated his notes to Mr. Bentley&quot;. The reviewer in the &quot;Spectator&quot; objected that &quot;nothing should be introduced into a novel which it is physically impossible for the writer to have known: thus, he must not describe the conversation of miners in a pit if they &quot;all&quot; perish.&quot; The &quot;Dublin University Magazine&quot; asked &quot;how does it happen that the author is alive to tell the story?&quot; A few other reviewers, who did not comment upon the apparent impossibility of Ishmael telling the story, pointed out violations of narrative conventions in other passages.

Other reviewers accepted the flaws they perceived. &quot;John Bull&quot; praised the author for making literature out of unlikely and even unattractive matter, and the &quot;Morning Post&quot; found that delight far outstripped the improbable character of events. Though some reviewers viewed the characters, especially Ahab, as exaggerated, others felt that it took an extraordinary character to undertake the battle with the white whale. Melville&#x27;s style was often praised, although some found it excessive or too American.

=== American ===
Some sixty reviews appeared in America, the criterion for counting as a review being more than two lines of comment. Only a couple of reviewers expressed themselves early enough not to be influenced by news of the British reception. Though &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; did contain the &quot;Epilogue&quot; and so accounted for Ishmael&#x27;s survival, the British reviews influenced the American reception. The earliest American review, in the Boston &quot;Post&quot; for November 20, quoted the London &quot;Athenaeum&quot;″s scornful review, not realizing that some of the criticism of &quot;The Whale&quot; did not pertain to &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;. This last point, and the authority and influence of British criticism in American reviewing, is clear from the review&#x27;s opening: &quot;We have read nearly one half of this book, and are satisfied that the London Athenaeum is right in calling it &#x27;an ill-compounded mixture of romance and matter-of-fact&#x27;&quot;. Though the &quot;Post&quot; quoted the greater portion of the review, it omitted the condensed extract of Melville&#x27;s prose the &quot;Athenaeum&quot; had included to give readers an example of it. The &quot;Post&quot; deemed the price of one dollar and fifty cents far too much: &quot;&#x27;The Whale&#x27; is not worth the money asked for it, either as a literary work or as a mass of printed paper&quot;.

The New York &quot;North American Miscellany&quot; for December summarized the verdict in the &quot;Athenaeum&quot;. The reviewer of the December New York &quot;Eclectic Magazine&quot; had actually read &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; in full, and was puzzled why the &quot;Athenaeum&quot; was so scornful of the ending. The attack on &quot;The Whale&quot; by the &quot;Spectator&quot; was reprinted in the December New York &quot;International Magazine&quot;, which inaugurated the influence of another unfavorable review. Rounding off what American readers were told about the British reception, in January &quot;Harper&#x27;s Monthly Magazine&quot; attempted some damage control, and wrote that the book had &quot;excited a general interest&quot; among the London magazines.

The most influential American review, ranked according to the number of references to it, appeared in the weekly magazine &quot;Literary World&quot;, which had printed Melville&#x27;s &quot;Mosses&quot; essay the preceding year. The author of the unsigned review in two installments, on November 15 and 22, was later identified as publisher Evert Duyckinck. The first half of the first installment was devoted to an event of remarkable coincidence: early in the month, between the publishing of the British and the American edition, a whale had sunk the New Bedford whaler &quot;Ann Alexander&quot; near Chile.

In the second installment, Duyckinck described &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; as three books rolled into one: he was pleased with the book as far as it was a thorough account of the sperm whale, less so with it as far as the adventures of the &quot;Pequod&quot; crew were considered, perceiving the characters as unrealistic and expressing inappropriate opinions on religions, and condemned the essayistic rhapsodizing and moralizing with what he thought was little respect of what &quot;must be to the world the most sacred associations of life violated and defaced.&quot; The review prompted Hawthorne to take the &quot;unusually aggressive step of reproving Duyckinck&quot; by criticizing the review in a letter to Duyckinck of December 1:

What a book Melville has written! It gives me an idea of much greater power than his preceding ones. It hardly seemed to me that the review of it, in the Literary World, did justice to its best points.

The Transcendental socialist George Ripley published a review in the New York &quot;Tribune&quot; for November 22, in which he compared the book favorably to &quot;Mardi&quot;, because the &quot;occasional touches of the subtle mysticism&quot; was not carried on to excess but kept within boundaries by the solid realism of the whaling context. Ripley was almost surely also the author of the review in &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; for December, which saw in Ahab&#x27;s quest the &quot;slight framework&quot; for something else: &quot;Beneath the whole story, the subtle, imaginative reader may perhaps find a pregnant allegory, intended to illustrate the mystery of human life.&quot; Among the handful of other favorable reviews was one in the &quot;Albion&quot; on November 22 which saw the book as a blend of truth and satire.

Melville&#x27;s friend Nathaniel Parker Willis, reviewing the book in November 29 &quot;Home Journal&quot;, found it &quot;a very racy, spirited, curious and entertaining book ... it enlists the curiosity, excites the sympathies, and often charms the fancy&quot;. In December 6 &quot;Spirit of the Times&quot;, editor William T. Porter praised the book, and all of Melville&#x27;s five earlier works, as the writings &quot;of a man who is at once philosopher, painter, and poet&quot;. Some other, shorter reviews mixed their praise with genuine reservations about the &quot;irreverence and profane jesting&quot;, as the New Haven &quot;Daily Palladium&quot; for November 17 phrased it. Many reviewers, Parker observes, had come to the conclusion that Melville was capable of producing enjoyable romances, but they could not see in him the author of great literature.

Reviewers who actually did read the book &quot;found much to praise,&quot; Robertson-Lorant writes, but conservative reviewers did not like it. A friend of Duyckinck&#x27;s, William Allen Butler, protested in the &quot;National Intelligencer&quot; against &quot;the querulous and cavilling innuendoes&quot; and the &quot;irreverent wit,&quot; while the &quot;Boston Post&quot; called it &quot;a crazy sort of affair.&quot;

==Legacy and adaptations==

Within a year after Melville&#x27;s death in 1891, &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;, along with &quot;Typee&quot;, &quot;Omoo&quot;, and &quot;Mardi&quot;, was reprinted by Harper &amp; Brothers, giving it a chance to be rediscovered. However, only New York&#x27;s literary underground showed interest, just enough to keep Melville&#x27;s name circulating for the next 25 years in the capital of American publishing. During this time, a few critics were willing to devote time, space, and a modicum of praise to Melville and his works, or at least those that could still be easily obtained or remembered. Other works, especially the poetry, went largely forgotten.

In 1917, American author Carl Van Doren became the first of this period to proselytize about Melville&#x27;s value in his 1921 study, &quot;The American Novel&quot;, calling &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; a pinnacle of American Romanticism.

In his 1923 &quot;Studies in Classic American Literature&quot;, novelist, poet, and short story writer D. H. Lawrence celebrated the originality and value of American authors, among them Melville. Lawrence saw &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; as a work of the first order despite his using the expurgated original English edition, which lacked the epilogue.

The Modern Library brought out &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; in 1926, and the Lakeside Press in Chicago commissioned Rockwell Kent to design and illustrate a striking three-volume edition, which appeared in 1930. Random House then issued a one-volume trade version of Kent&#x27;s edition, which in 1943 they reprinted as a less expensive Modern Library Giant.

The novel has been adapted or represented in art, film, books, cartoons, television, and more than a dozen versions in comic-book format. The first adaptation was the 1926 silent movie &quot;The Sea Beast&quot;, starring John Barrymore, in which Ahab returns to marry his fiancée after killing the whale. The most famous adaptation was the John Huston 1956 film produced from a screenplay by author Ray Bradbury. The long list of adaptations, as Bryant and Springer put it, demonstrates that &quot;the iconic image of an angry embittered American slaying a mythic beast seemed to capture the popular imagination.&quot; They conclude that &quot;different readers in different periods of popular culture have rewritten &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;&quot; to make it a &quot;true cultural icon&quot;. American artist David Klamen has cited the novel as an important influence on his dark, slow-to-disclose paintings, noting a passage in the book in which a mysterious, undecipherable painting in a bar is gradually revealed to depict a whale.

American author Ralph Ellison wrote a tribute to the book in the prologue of his 1952 novel &quot;Invisible Man&quot;. The narrator remembers a moment of truth under the influence of marijuana and evokes a church service: &quot;Brothers and sisters, my text this morning is the &#x27;Blackness of Blackness.&#x27; And the congregation answers: &#x27;That blackness is most black, brother, most black ... &#x27;&quot; This scene, Ellison biographer Arnold Rampersad observes, &quot;reprises a moment in the second chapter of &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;&quot;, where Ishmael wanders around New Bedford looking for a place to spend the night, and momentarily joins a congregation: &quot;It was a negro church; and the preacher&#x27;s text was about the blackness of darkness, and the weeping and wailing and teeth-gnashing there.&quot; According to Rampersad, it was Melville who &quot;empowered Ellison to insist on a place in the American literary tradition&quot; by his example of &quot;representing the complexity of race and racism so acutely and generously in his text&quot;. Rampersad also believes Ellison&#x27;s choice of a first-person narrator was inspired above all by &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;, and the novel even has a similar opening sentence with the narrator introducing himself (&quot;I am an invisible man&quot;). The oration by Ellison&#x27;s blind preacher Barbee resembles Father Mapple&#x27;s sermon in that both prepare the reader for what is to come.

In 1961, a Japanese author Kōichirō Uno won the Akutagawa Prize with his novel &quot;The Whale God&quot;, which was later made into a tokusatsu film by Daiei Film next year. Uno&#x27;s &quot;The Whale God&quot; was presumably inspired by &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; as the former also focuses on vengeful whalers who seek after an unusually large and powerful whale.
According to critic Camille Paglia in &quot;Sexual Personae&quot;, a book with the whiteness or blankness of nonmeaning as its main symbol should logically propose a depersonalized view of nature, but in this respect the novel is &quot;amazingly inconsistent&quot;, as Melville &quot;elevates the masculine principle above the feminine.&quot; To be perfectly consistent, in her view the whale should be &quot;sexually neuter,&quot; and its whiteness &quot;an obliteration of person, gender, and meaning.&quot;

British explorer Tim Severin wrote in his 1999 book &quot;In Search of Moby Dick: Quest for the White Whale&quot; about traveling throughout the Pacific, inquiring among indigenous fishermen and watermen about white whales, in personal experience or local folklore.

American songwriter Bob Dylan&#x27;s Nobel Prize Acceptance Speech of 2017 cited &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; as one of the three books that influenced him most. Dylan&#x27;s description ends with an acknowledgment: &quot;That theme, and all that it implies, would work its way into more than a few of my songs.&quot;

<doc id="19863" wikidata="Q118251" url="?curid=19863" title="Madeira River">
<text>The Madeira River ( ) is a major waterway in South America. It is estimated to be in length, while the Madeira-Mamoré is estimated near or in length depending on the measuring party and their methods. The Madeira is the biggest tributary of the Amazon, accounting for about 15% of the water in the basin. A map from Emanuel Bowen in 1747, held by the David Rumsey Map Collection, refers to the Madeira by the pre-colonial, indigenous name Cuyari. 
The River of Cuyari, called by the Portuguese Madeira or the Wood River, is formed by two great rivers, which join near its mouth. It was by this River, that the Nation of Topinambes passed into the River Amazon.
==Climate==
The mean inter-annual precipitations on the great basins vary from , the entire upper Madeira basin receiving . The greatest extremes of rainfall are between . Even just below the confluence that forms it, the Madeira is one of the largest rivers by discharge of the world, with a mean inter-annual discharge of , i.e., per year, approximately half the discharge of the Congo River. On the further course towards the Amazon, the mean discharge of the Madeira increases up to .

==Course==
Between Guajará-Mirim and the falls of Teotônio, the Madeira receives the drainage of the north-eastern slopes of the Andes from Santa Cruz de la Sierra to Cuzco, the whole of the south-western slope of Brazilian Mato Grosso and the northern slope of the Chiquitos sierras. In total, this catchment area, which is slightly more than the combined area of all headwaters, is , almost equal in size to France and Spain combined. The waters flow into the Madeira from many large rivers, the principal of which, (from east to west), are the Guaporé or Iténez, the Baures and Blanco, the Itonamas or San Miguel, the Mamoré, Beni, and Madre de Dios or Mayutata, all of which are reinforced by numerous secondary but powerful affluents. The climate of the upper catchment area varies from humid in the western edge with the origin of the river&#x27;s main stem by volume (Río Madre de Dios, Río Beni) to semi arid in the southernmost part with the Andine headwaters of the main stem by length (Río Caine, Río Rocha, Río Grande, Mamoré).

All of the upper branches of the river Madeira find their way to the falls across the open, almost level Mojos and Beni plains, of which are yearly flooded to an average depth of about for a period of from three to four months.

From its source in the confluence of Madre de Dios and Mamoré rivers and downstream to Abuna River the Madeira flows northward forming border between Bolivia and Brazil. Below its confluence with the latter tributary the flow of river changes to north-eastward direction, inland of Rondônia state of Brazil. The section of the river from the border to Porto Velho has notable drop of bed and was not navigable. Before 2012 the falls of Teotônio and of San Antônio existed here, they had higher flow rate and bigger level drop than more famous Boyoma Falls in Africa. Currently these rapids are submerged by the reservoir of Santo Antônio Dam. Below Porto Velho the Madeira meanders north-eastward through the Rondônia and Amazonas states of north west Brazil to its junction with the Amazon.

The Rio Madeira Sustainable Development Reserve, created in 2006, extends along the north bank of the river opposite the town of Novo Aripuanã.
At its mouth is Ilha Tupinambaranas, an extensive marshy region formed by the Madeira&#x27;s distributaries.

==Navigation==
The Madeira river rises more than during the rainy season, and ocean vessels may ascend it to the Falls of San Antonio, near Porto Velho, Brazil, above its mouth; but in the dry months, from June to November, it is only navigable for the same distance for craft drawing about of water. The Madeira-Mamoré Railroad runs in a loop around the unnavigable section to Guajará-Mirim on the Mamoré River, but is not functional, limiting shipping from the Atlantic at Porto Velho.

Today, it is also one of the Amazon basin&#x27;s most active waterways, and helps export close to four million tons of grains, which are loaded onto barges in Porto Velho, where both Cargill and Amaggi have loading facilities, and then shipped down the Madeira to the ports of Itacoatiara, near the mouth of the Madeira, just upstream on the left bank of the Amazon, or further down the Amazon, to the port of Santarem, at the mouth of the Tapajos River. From these two ports, Panamax-type ships then export the grains - mainly soy and corn - to Europe and Asia. The Madeira waterway is also used to take fuel from the REMAN refinery (Petrobras) in Manaus, state capital of Amazonas, to Porto Velho, from where the states of Acre, Rondônia and parts of Mato Grosso are supplied mainly with gasoline (petrol) refined in Manaus. Cargo barges also use the Madeira on the route between Manaus and Porto Velho, which is along the Rio Negro, Amazon and Madeira, connecting Manaus&#x27; industrial district with the rest of Brazil, as Manaus is land-locked as far as logistics with the rest of the country are concerned, to bring in part of its raw materials, and export its produce to the major consumer centres of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. In 2012, the cargo amounted to 287,835 tons (both directions). The total tonnage shipped in 2012 on the Madeira accounted to 5,076,014.

Two large dams (see below) are under construction as part of the IIRSA regional integration project. The dam projects include large ship-locks capable of moving oceangoing vessels between the impounded reservoir and the downstream river. If the project is completed, &quot;more than of waterways upstream from the dams in Brazil, Bolivia, and Peru would become navigable.&quot;

==Ecology==

As typical of Amazonian rivers with the primary headwaters in the Andes, the Madeira River is turbid because of high sediment levels and it is whitewater, but some of its tributaries are clearwater (e.g., Aripuanã and Ji-Paraná) or blackwater (e.g., Manicoré).

The Bolivian river dolphin, variously considered a subspecies of the Amazon river dolphin or a separate species, is restricted to the upper Madeira River system. It has been estimated that there are more than 900 fish species in the Madeira River Basin, making it one of the freshwater systems in the world with the highest species richness.

==In popular culture==
The river is the fifth title of the 1993/1999 Philip Glass album &quot;Aguas da Amazonia&quot;.

==Dams==
In July 2007, plans have been approved by the Brazilian Government to construct two hydroelectric dams on the Madeira River, the Santo Antônio Dam near Porto Velho and the Jirau Dam about 100 km upstream. Both the Jirau and Santo Antonio dams are run-of-the-river projects that do not impound a large reservoir. Both dams also feature some environmental re-mediation efforts (such as fish ladders). As a consequence, it has been suggested that there has not been strong environmental opposition to the implementation of the Madeira river complex. Yet, if the fish ladders fail, &quot;several valuable migratory fish species could suffer near-extinction as a result of the Madeira dams.&quot;

There are also concerns with deforestation and pressure on conservation areas and indigenous peoples&#x27; territories.
The Worldwatch institute has also criticized the fast-track approval process for &quot;kindler, gentler dams with smaller reservoirs, designed to lessen social and environmental impacts&quot;, claiming that no project should &quot;fast-track the licensing of new dams in Amazonia and allow projects to circumvent Brazil&#x27;s tough environmental laws&quot;.

<text>The Marañón River (, , ) is the principal or mainstem source of the Amazon River, arising about 160 km to the northeast of Lima, Peru, and flowing northwest across plateaus 3,650 m (12,000 feet) high, it runs through a deeply eroded Andean valley, along the eastern base of the Cordillera of the Andes, as far as 5° 36′ southern latitude; from where it makes a great bend to the northeast, and cuts through the jungle Ande in its midcourse, until at the Pongo de Manseriche it flows into the flat Amazon basin. Although historically, the term &quot;Marañón River&quot; often was applied to the river all the way to the Atlantic Ocean, nowadays the Marañón River is generally thought to end at the confluence with the Ucayali River, after which most cartographers label the ensuing waterway the Amazon River.

As the Marañón passes through high jungle in its midcourse, it is marked by a series of unnavigable rapids and falls.

The Marañón was the subject of a landmark legal ruling related to the rights of nature. In March 2024, a Peruvian court ruled that the river itself has fundamental rights, including the right to ecological flows and to be free from pollution.

==Geography==
The Marañón River is Peru&#x27;s second-longest river, according to a 2005 statistical publication by the Instituto Nacional de Estadística e Informática.

== Source of the Amazon ==
The Marañón River was considered the source of the Amazon River starting with the 1707 map published by Padre Samuel Fritz, who indicated the great river &quot;has its source on the southern shore of a lake that is called Lauriocha, near Huánuco.&quot; Fritz believed that the Marañón contributed the most water of all the Amazon&#x27;s tributaries, making it the most important headstream. 

For most of the 18th–19th centuries and into the 20th century, the Marañón River was generally considered the source of the Amazon. Later explorations have proposed two headwaters rivers of the Marañón in the high Andes as sources of the Amazon: the Lauricocha and Nupe Rivers. The Lauricocha and Nupe unite near the village of Rondos to form from their confluence downstream the river that is called the Marañón.

Although the Apurimac and Mantaro rivers also have claims to being the source of the Amazon, the Marañón River continues to claim the title of the &quot;mainstem source&quot; or &quot;hydrological source&quot; of the Amazon due to its contribution of the highest annual discharge rates.

== Description ==

The initial section of the Marañón contains a plethora of &quot;pongos&quot;, which are gorges in the jungle areas often with difficult rapids.
The Pongo de Manseriche is the final&quot; pongo&quot; on the Marañón located just before the river enters the flat Amazon basin. It is long and located between the confluence with the Rio Santiago and the village of Borja. According to Captain Carbajal, who attempted ascent through the Pongo de Manseriche in the little steamer &quot;Napo&quot;, in 1868, it is a vast rent in the Andes about 600 m (2000 ft) deep, narrowing in places to a width of only 30 m (100 ft), the precipices &quot;seeming to close in at the top.&quot; Through this canyon, the Marañón leaps along, at times, at the rate of 20 km/h (12 mi/h). The &quot;pongo&quot; is known for wrecking many ships and many drownings.

Downstream of the Pongo de Manseriche, the river often has islands, and usually nothing is visible from its low banks, but an immense forest-covered plain known as the &quot;selva baja&quot; (low jungle) or Peruvian Amazonia. It is home to indigenous peoples such as the Urarina of the Chambira Basin , the Candoshi, and the Cocama-Cocamilla peoples.

A 552-km (343-mi) section of the Marañón River between Puente Copuma (Puchka confluence) and Corral Quemado is a class IV raftable river that is similar in many ways to the Grand Canyon of the United States, and has been labeled the &quot;Grand Canyon of the Amazon&quot;. Most of this section of the river is in a canyon that is up to 3000 m deep on both sides – over twice the depth of the Colorado&#x27;s Grand Canyon. It is in dry, desert-like terrain, much of which receives only 250–350 mm/rain per year (10–14 in/yr) with parts such as from Balsas to Jaén known as the hottest &quot;infierno&quot; area of Peru. The Marañón Grand Canyon section flows by the village of Calemar, where Peruvian writer Ciro Alegría based one of his most important novels, &quot;La serpiente de oro&quot; (1935).

== Historical journeys ==
=== La Condamine, 1743 ===
One of the first popular descents of the Marañón River occurred in 1743, when Frenchman Charles Marie de La Condamine journeyed from the Chinchipe confluence all the way to the Atlantic Ocean. La Condamine did not descend the initial section of the Marañón by boat due to the &quot;pongos&quot;. From where he began his boating descent at the Chiriaco confluence, La Condamine still had to confront several &quot;pongos&quot;, including the Pongo de Huaracayo (or Guaracayo) and the Pongo de Manseriche.

=== Flornoy, 1941-1942 ===
In 1936, Bertrand Flornoy was appointed chargé de mission at the National Museum of Natural History of France, which sent him on study and exploration missions in Amazonia and the Andes. He specialised in the Peruvian Upper Amazon, and in 1941 and 1942 discovered the sources of the Río Marañón, one of the tributaries of the Amazon.

=== The Grand Canyon of the Amazon ===

The upper Marañón River has seen a number of descents. An attempt to paddle the river was made by Herbert Rittlinger in 1936. Sebastian Snow was an adventurer who journeyed down most of the river by trekking to Chiriaco River starting at the source near Lake Niñacocha.

In 1976 and/or 1977, Laszlo Berty descended the section from Chagual to the jungle in a raft. In 1977, a group composed of Tom Fisher, Steve Gaskill, Ellen Toll, and John Wasson spent over a month descending the river from Rondos to Nazareth with kayaks and a raft. In 2004, Tim Biggs and companions kayaked the entire river from the Nupe River to Iquitos. In 2012, Rocky Contos descended the entire river with various companions along the way.

== Hydroelectric dams ==
The Marañón River may supply 20 hydroelectric mega-dams planned in the Andes, and most of the power is thought to be destined for export to Brazil, Chile, or Ecuador. Dam survey crews have drafted construction blueprints, and the environmental impact statements have been available since November 2009 for the Veracruz dam, and since November 2011, the Chadin2 dam. 
A 2011 law stated &quot;national demand&quot; for the hydroelectric energy, while in 2013, Peruvian President Ollanta Humala explicitly made a connection with mining; the energy is to supply mines in the Cajamarca Region, La Libertad, Ancash Region, and Piura Region. Construction of the 406 MW dam in Chaglla District started in 2012.

===Concerns===
Opposition arose because the dams are expected to disrupt the major source of the Amazon, alter normal silt deposition into the lower river, damage habitat and migration patterns for fish and other aquatic life, displace thousands of residents along the river, and damage a national treasure &quot;at least as nice as the Grand Canyon in the USA&quot;. Residents have launched efforts to halt the dams along the river with conservation groups such as SierraRios and International Rivers.

Potential ecological impacts of 151 new dams greater than 2 MW on five of the six major Andean tributaries of the Amazon over the next 20 years are estimated to be high, including the first major break in connectivity between Andean headwaters and lowland Amazon and deforestation due to infrastructure.

==Water Pollution==

The Marañón River has been polluted by oil pipelines and mining activities in its watershed. Between 1970 and 2019, over 60 spills have been documented from the Norperuano oil pipeline. Mercury and other toxic chemicals have been released from illegal mining.

<text>The Morona River is a tributary to the Marañón River in Peru and Ecuador, and flows parallel to the Pastaza River and immediately to the west of it, and is the last stream of any importance on the northern side of the Amazon before reaching the Pongo de Manseriche.

It is formed from a multitude of water-courses which descend the slopes of the Ecuadorian Andes south of the gigantic volcano of Sangay; but it soon reaches the plain, which commences where it receives its Cusulima branch. The Morona is navigable for small craft for about 300 miles above its mouth, but it is extremely tortuous. Canoes may ascend many of its branches, especially the Cusuhma and the Miazal, the latter almost to the base of Sangay. The Morona has been the scene of many rude explorations, with the hope of finding it serviceable as a commercial route between the inter-Andean tableland of Ecuador and the Amazon river.

In 2016, a large oil spill from Petroperú&#x27;s pipeline contaminated the Morona and Chiriaco rivers.

<text>Maxwell Herman Alexander Newman, FRS (7 February 1897 – 22 February 1984), generally known as Max Newman, was a British mathematician and codebreaker. His work in World War II led to the construction of Colossus, the world&#x27;s first operational, programmable electronic computer, and he established the Royal Society Computing Machine Laboratory at the University of Manchester, which produced the world&#x27;s first working, stored-program electronic computer in 1948, the Manchester Baby.

==Early life and education==

Newman was born Maxwell Herman Alexander Neumann in Chelsea, London, England, to a Jewish family, on 7 February 1897. His father was Herman Alexander Neumann, originally from the German city of Bromberg (now in Poland), who had emigrated with his family to London at the age of 15. Herman worked as a secretary in a company, and married Sarah Ann Pike, an Irish schoolteacher, in 1896.

The family moved to Dulwich in 1903, and Newman attended Goodrich Road school, then City of London School from 1908. At school, he excelled in classics and in mathematics. He played chess and the piano well.

Newman won a scholarship to study mathematics at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge in 1915, and in 1916 gained a First in Part I of the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos.

==World War I==

Newman&#x27;s studies were interrupted by World War I. His father was interned as an enemy alien after the start of the war in 1914, and upon his release he returned to Germany. In 1916, Herman changed his name by deed poll to the anglicised &quot;Newman&quot; and Sarah did likewise in 1920. In January 1917, Newman took up a teaching post at Archbishop Holgate&#x27;s Grammar School in York, leaving in April 1918. He spent some months in the Royal Army Pay Corps, and then taught at Chigwell School for six months in 1919 before returning to Cambridge. He was called up for military service in February 1918, but claimed conscientious objection due to his beliefs and his father&#x27;s country of origin, and thereby avoided any direct role in the fighting.

==Between the wars==

===Graduation===
Newman resumed his interrupted studies in October 1919, and graduated in 1921 as a Wrangler (equivalent to a First) in Part II of the Mathematical Tripos, and gained distinction in Schedule B (the equivalent of Part III). His dissertation considered the use of &quot;symbolic machines&quot; in physics, foreshadowing his later interest in computing machines.

===Early academic career===
On 5 November 1923, Newman was elected a Fellow of St John&#x27;s. He worked on the foundations of combinatorial topology, and proposed that a notion of equivalence be defined using only three elementary &quot;moves&quot;. Newman&#x27;s definition avoided difficulties that had arisen from previous definitions of the concept. Publishing over twenty papers established his reputation as an &quot;expert in modern topology&quot;. Newman wrote &quot;Elements of the topology of plane sets of points&quot;, a work on general topology and undergraduate text. He also published papers on mathematical logic, and solved a special case of Hilbert&#x27;s fifth problem.

He was appointed a lecturer in mathematics at Cambridge in 1927. His 1935 lectures on the Foundations of Mathematics and Gödel&#x27;s theorem inspired Alan Turing to embark on his work on the &quot;Entscheidungsproblem&quot; (decision problem) that had been posed by Hilbert and Ackermann in 1928. Turing&#x27;s solution involved proposing a hypothetical programmable computing machine. In spring 1936, Newman was presented by Turing with a draft of &quot;On Computable Numbers with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem&quot;. He realised the paper&#x27;s importance and helped ensure swift publication. Newman subsequently arranged for Turing to visit Princeton where Alonzo Church was working on the same problem but using his Lambda calculus. During this period, Newman started to share Turing&#x27;s dream of building a stored-program computing machine.

During this time at Cambridge, he developed close friendships with Patrick Blackett, Henry Whitehead and Lionel Penrose.

In September 1937, Newman and his family accepted an invitation to work for six months at Princeton. At Princeton, he worked on the Poincaré Conjecture and, in his final weeks there, presented a proof. However, in July 1938, after he returned to Cambridge, Newman discovered that his proof was fatally flawed.

In 1939, Newman was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.

===Family life===
In December 1934, he married Lyn Lloyd Irvine, a writer, with Patrick Blackett as best man. They had two sons, Edward (born 1935) and William (born 1939).

==World War II==
The United Kingdom declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939. Newman&#x27;s father was Jewish, which was of particular concern in the face of Nazi Germany, and Lyn, Edward and William were evacuated to America in July 1940, where they spent three years before returning to England in October 1943. After Oswald Veblen — maintaining &#x27;that every able-bodied man ought to be carrying a gun or hand-grenade and fight for his country&#x27;— opposed moves to bring him to Princeton, Newman remained at Cambridge and at first continued research and lecturing.

===Government Code and Cypher School===
By spring 1942, Newman was considering involvement in war work. He made enquiries. After Patrick Blackett recommended him to the Director of Naval Intelligence, Newman was sounded out by Frank Adcock in connection with the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park.

Newman was cautious, concerned to ensure that the work would be sufficiently interesting and useful, and there was also the possibility that his father&#x27;s German nationality would rule out any involvement in top-secret work. The potential issues were resolved by the summer, and he agreed to arrive at Bletchley Park on 31 August 1942. Newman was invited by F. L. (Peter) Lucas to work on Enigma but decided to join Tiltman&#x27;s group working on Tunny.

===Tunny===

Newman was assigned to the Research Section and set to work on a German teleprinter cipher known as &quot;Tunny&quot;. He joined the &quot;Testery&quot; in October. Newman enjoyed the company but disliked the work and found that it was not suited to his talents. He persuaded his superiors that Tutte&#x27;s method could be mechanised, and he was assigned to develop a suitable machine in December 1942. Shortly afterwards, Edward Travis (then operational head of Bletchley Park) asked Newman to lead research into mechanised codebreaking.

===The Newmanry===

When the war ended, Newman was presented with a silver tankard inscribed &#x27;To MHAN from the Newmanry, 1943–45&#x27;.

====Heath Robinson====

Construction started in January 1943, and the first prototype was delivered in June 1943. It was operated in Newman&#x27;s new section, termed the &quot;Newmanry&quot;, was housed initially in Hut 11 and initially staffed by himself, Donald Michie, two engineers, and 16 Wrens. The Wrens nicknamed the machine the &quot;Heath Robinson&quot;, after the cartoonist of the same name who drew humorous drawings of absurd mechanical devices.

====Colossus====

The Robinson machines were limited in speed and reliability. Tommy Flowers of the Post Office Research Station, Dollis Hill had experience of thermionic valves and built an electronic machine, the Colossus computer which was installed in the Newmanry. This was a great success and ten were in use by the end of the war.

==Later academic career==

===Fielden Chair, Victoria University of Manchester===
In September 1945, Newman was appointed head of the Mathematics Department and to the Fielden Chair of Pure Mathematics at the University of Manchester.

====Computing Machine Laboratory====

Newman lost no time in establishing the renowned Royal Society Computing Machine Laboratory at the University. In February 1946, he wrote to John von Neumann, expressing his desire to build a computing machine. The Royal Society approved Newman&#x27;s grant application in July 1946. Frederic Calland Williams and Thomas Kilburn, experts in electronic circuit design, were recruited from the Telecommunications Research Establishment. Kilburn and Williams built Baby, the world&#x27;s first electronic stored-program digital computer based on Alan Turing&#x27;s and John von Neumann&#x27;s ideas.

After the Automatic Computing Engine suffered delays and set backs, Turing accepted Newman&#x27;s offer and joined the Computer Machine Laboratory in May 1948 as Deputy Director (there being no Director). Turing joined Kilburn and Williams to work on Baby&#x27;s successor, the Manchester Mark I. Collaboration between the University and Ferranti later produced the Ferranti Mark I, the first mass-produced computer to go on sale.

===Retirement===
Newman retired in 1964 to live in Comberton, near Cambridge. After Lyn&#x27;s death in 1973, he married Margaret Penrose, widow of his friend Lionel Penrose, father of Sir Roger Penrose.

He continued to do research on combinatorial topology during a period when England was a major centre of activity notably Cambridge under the leadership of Christopher Zeeman. Newman made important contributions leading to an invitation to present his work at the 1962 International Congress of Mathematicians in Stockholm at the age of 65, and proved a Generalized Poincaré conjecture for topological manifolds in 1966.

At the age of 85, Newman began to suffer from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. He died in Cambridge two years later.

==Honours==
* Fellow of the Royal Society, elected 1939
* Royal Society Sylvester Medal, awarded 1958
* London Mathematical Society, President 1949–1951
* LMS De Morgan Medal, awarded 1962
* D.Sc. University of Hull, awarded 1968

The Newman Building at Manchester was named in his honour. The building housed the pure mathematicians from the Victoria University of Manchester between moving out of the Mathematics Tower in 2004 and July 2007 when the School of Mathematics moved into its new Alan Turing Building, where a lecture room is named in his honour.

In 1946, Newman declined the offer of an OBE as he considered the offer derisory. Alan Turing had been appointed an OBE six months earlier and Newman felt that it was inadequate recognition of Turing&#x27;s contribution to winning the war, referring to it as the &quot;ludicrous treatment of Turing&quot;.

<doc id="19869" wikidata="Q171985" url="?curid=19869" title="Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority">
<text>The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (abbreviated MBTA and known colloquially as &quot;the T&quot;) is the public agency responsible for operating most public transportation services in Greater Boston, Massachusetts. The MBTA transit network includes the MBTA subway with three metro lines (the Blue, Orange, and Red lines), two light rail lines (the Green and Mattapan lines), and a five-line bus rapid transit system (the Silver Line); MBTA bus local and express service; the twelve-line MBTA Commuter Rail system, and several ferry routes. In , the system had a ridership of , or about per weekday as of , of which the rapid transit lines averaged and the light rail lines , making it the fourth-busiest rapid transit system and the third-busiest light rail system in the United States. As of , average weekday ridership of the commuter rail system was , making it the fifth-busiest commuter rail system in the U.S.

The MBTA is the successor of several previous public and private operators. Privately operated transit in Boston began with commuter rail in 1834 and horsecar lines in 1856. The various horsecar companies were consolidated under the West End Street Railway in the 1880s and electrified over the next decade. The Boston Elevated Railway (BERy) succeeded the West End in 1897; over the next several decades, the BERy built a partially-publicly owned rapid transit system, beginning with the Tremont Street subway in 1897. The BERy came under the control of public trustees in 1919, and was subsumed into the fully-publicly owned Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) in 1947. The MTA was in turn succeeded in 1964 by the MBTA, with an expanded funding district to fund declining suburban commuter rail service. In its first two decades, the MBTA took over the commuter rail system from the private operators and continued expansion of the rapid transit system. Originally established as an individual department within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the MBTA became a division of the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) in 2009.

== History ==

Mass transportation in Boston was provided by private companies, often granted charters by the state legislature for limited monopolies, with powers of eminent domain to establish a right-of-way, until the creation of the MTA in 1947. Development of mass transportation both followed and shaped economic and population patterns.

=== Railways ===
Shortly after the steam locomotive became practical for mass transportation, the private Boston and Lowell Railroad was chartered in 1830. The rail, which opened in 1835, connected Boston to Lowell, a major northerly mill town in northeast Massachusetts&#x27; Merrimack Valley, via one of the oldest railroads in North America. This marked the beginning of the development of American intercity railroads, which in Massachusetts would later become the MBTA Commuter Rail system and the Green Line D branch.

=== Streetcars ===
Starting with the opening of the Cambridge Railroad on March 26, 1856, a profusion of streetcar lines appeared in Boston under chartered companies. Despite the change of companies, Boston is the city with the oldest continuously working streetcar system in the world. Many of these companies consolidated, and animal-drawn vehicles were converted to electric propulsion.

=== Subways and elevated railways ===

Streetcar congestion in downtown Boston led to the subways in 1897 and elevated rail in 1901. The Tremont Street subway was the first rapid transit tunnel in the United States. Grade-separation added capacity and avoided delays caused by cross streets. The first elevated railway and the first rapid transit line in Boston were built three years before the first underground line of the New York City Subway, but 34 years after the first London Underground lines, and long after the first elevated railway in New York City; its Ninth Avenue El started operations on July 1, 1868, in Manhattan as an elevated cable car line.

Various extensions and branches were added at both ends, bypassing more surface tracks. As grade-separated lines were extended, street-running lines were cut back for faster downtown service. The last elevated heavy rail or &quot;El&quot; segments in Boston were at the extremities of the Orange Line: its northern end was relocated in 1975 from Everett to Malden, Massachusetts, and its southern end was relocated into the Southwest Corridor in 1987. However, the Green Line&#x27;s Causeway Street Elevated remained in service until 2004, when it was relocated into a tunnel with an incline to reconnect to the Lechmere Viaduct. The Lechmere Viaduct and a short section of steel-framed elevated at its northern end remain in service, though the elevated section was cut back slightly and connected to a northwards viaduct extension as part of the Green Line Extension.

=== Public enterprise ===

The old elevated railways proved to be an eyesore and required several sharp curves in Boston&#x27;s twisty streets. The Atlantic Avenue Elevated was closed in 1938 amidst declining ridership and was demolished in 1942. As rail passenger service became increasingly unprofitable, largely due to rising automobile ownership, government takeover prevented abandonment and dismantlement. The MTA purchased and took over subway, elevated, streetcar, and bus operations from the Boston Elevated Railway in 1947.

In the 1950s, the MTA ran new subway extensions, while the last two streetcar lines running into the Pleasant Street Portal of the Tremont Street Subway were substituted with buses in 1953 and 1962. In 1958, the MTA purchased the Highland branch from the Boston and Albany Railroad, reopening it a year later as a rapid transit line (now the Green Line D branch).

While the operations of the MTA were relatively stable by the early 1960s, the privately operated commuter rail lines were in freefall. The New Haven Railroad, New York Central Railroad, and Boston and Maine Railroad were all financially struggling; deferred maintenance was hurting the mainlines while most branch lines had been discontinued. The 1945 Coolidge Commission plan assumed that most of the commuter rail lines would be replaced by shorter rapid transit extensions, or simply feed into them at reduced service levels. Passenger service on the entire Old Colony Railroad system serving the southeastern part of the state was abandoned by the New Haven Railroad in 1959, triggering calls for state intervention. Between January 1963 and March 1964, the Mass Transportation Commission tested different fare and service levels on the B&amp;M and New Haven systems. Determining that commuter rail operations were important but could not be financially self-sustaining, the MTC recommended an expansion of the MTA to commuter rail territory.

On August 3, 1964, the MBTA succeeded the MTA, with an enlarged service area intended to fund continued commuter rail operations. The original 14-municipality MTA district was expanded to 78 cities and towns. Several lines were briefly cut back while contracts with out-of-district towns were reached, but, except for the outer portions of the Central Mass branch (cut back from Hudson to South Sudbury), West Medway branch (cut back from West Medway to Millis), Blackstone Line (cut back from Blackstone to Franklin), and B&amp;M New Hampshire services (cut back from Portsmouth to Newburyport), these cuts were temporary; however, service on three branch lines (all of them with only one round trip daily: one morning rush-hour trip in to Boston, and one evening rush-hour trip back out to the suburbs) was dropped permanently between 1965 and 1976 (the Millis (the new name of the truncated West Medway branch) and Dedham Branches were discontinued in 1967, while the Central Mass branch was abandoned in 1971). The MBTA bought the Penn Central (New York Central and New Haven) commuter rail lines in January 1973, Penn Central equipment in April 1976, and all B&amp;M commuter assets in December 1976; these purchases served to make the system state-owned with the private railroads retained solely as operators. Only two branch lines were abandoned after 1976: service on the Lexington branch (also with only one round trip daily) was discontinued in January 1977 after a snowstorm blocked the line, while the Lowell Line&#x27;s full-service Woburn branch was eliminated in January 1981 due to poor track conditions.

The MBTA assigned colors to its four rapid transit lines in 1965, and lettered the branches of the Green Line from north to south. Shortages of streetcars, among other factors, caused bustitution of rail service on two branches of the Green Line. The A branch ceased operating entirely in 1969 and was replaced by the 57 bus, while the E branch was truncated from Arborway to Heath Street in 1985, with the section between Heath Street and Arborway being replaced by the 39 bus.

The MBTA purchased bus routes in the outer suburbs to the north and south from the Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway in 1968. As with the commuter rail system, many of the outlying routes were dropped shortly before or after the takeover due to low ridership and high operating costs. The MBTA started subsidizing the Middlesex and Boston Street Railway in 1964, and acquired it in 1972, creating its 5xx bus routes.

In the 1970s, the MBTA received a boost from the Boston Transportation Planning Review area-wide re-evaluation of the role of mass transit relative to highways. Producing a moratorium on highway construction inside Route 128, numerous mass transit lines were planned for expansion by the Voorhees-Skidmore, Owings and Merrill-ESL consulting team. The removal of elevated lines continued, and the closure of the Washington Street Elevated in 1987 brought the end of rapid transit service to the Roxbury neighborhood. Between 1971 and 1985, the Red Line was extended both north and south, providing not only additional subway system coverage, but also major parking structures at several of the terminal and intermediate stations.

In 1981, seventeen people and one corporation were indicted for their roles in a number of kickback schemes at the MBTA. Massachusetts Secretary of Transportation and MBTA Chairman Barry Locke was convicted of five counts of bribery and sentenced to 7 to 10 years in prison.

=== 21st century ===

By 1999, the district was expanded further to 175 cities and towns, adding most that were served by or adjacent to commuter rail lines, though the MBTA did not assume responsibility for local service in those communities adjacent to or served by commuter rail. In 2016, the Town of Bourne voted to join the MBTA district, bringing the number of MBTA communities to 176. Prior to July 1, 2000, the MBTA was reimbursed by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for all costs above revenue collected (net cost of service). &quot;Forward funding&quot; introduced at that time consists of a dedicated revenue stream from assessments on served cities and towns, along with a 20% portion of the 5% state sales tax.

The Commonwealth assigned to the MBTA responsibility for increasing public transit to compensate for increased automobile pollution from the Big Dig. However, these projects have strained the MBTA&#x27;s limited resources, since the Big Dig project did not include funding for these improvements. Since 1988, the MBTA has been the fastest expanding transit system in the country, even as Greater Boston has been one of the slowest growing metropolitan areas in the United States. The MBTA subsequently went into debt, and rates underwent an appreciable hike on January 1, 2007.

In 2006, the creation of the MetroWest Regional Transit Authority saw several towns subtract their MWRTA assessment from their MBTA assessment, though the amount of funding the MBTA received remained the same. The next year, the MBTA started commuter rail service to the Greenbush section of Scituate, the third branch of the Old Colony service. Rhode Island also paid for extensions of the Providence/Stoughton Line to T.F. Green Airport in 2010 and Wickford Junction in 2012. A new station on the Fairmount Line, the Talbot Avenue station, opened in November 2012.

On June 26, 2009, Governor Deval Patrick signed a law to place the MBTA along with other state transportation agencies within the administrative authority of the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT), with the MBTA now part of the Mass Transit division (MassTrans).
The 2009 transportation law continued the MBTA corporate structure and changed the MBTA board membership to the five Governor-appointed members of the Mass DOT Board.
In February 2015, there was record breaking snowfall in Boston from the 2014–15 North American winter, which caused lengthy closures of portions of the MBTA subway system, and many long-term operational and financial problems with the entire MBTA system coming under greater public attention, Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker subsequently announced the formation of a special advisory panel to diagnose the MBTA&#x27;s problems and write a report recommending proposals to address them. The special advisory panel formed the previous February released its report in April 2015.

On March 19, 2015, using a grassroots tool, GovOnTheT, Steve Kropper, and Michele Rapp enlisted 65 Massachusetts General Court legislators to ride the T to the State House, pairing them with 85 TV, radio, electronic, and print reporters. The event responded to widespread anger directed at the governor, state legislators, and MBTA management. The pairings helped to raise awareness of the problems with the T and contributed to its restructuring and refinancing.

The next month, Baker appointed a new MassDOT Board of Directors and proposed a five-year winter resiliency plan with $83 million being spent to update infrastructure, purchase new equipment, and improve operations during severe weather. A new state law established the MBTA Fiscal and Management Control Board, effective July 17, 2015, with expanded powers to reform the agency during five years. Its term was extended by another year in 2020. Construction of the Green Line Extension, the first expansion to the rail rapid transit system since 1987, began in 2018. In April 2018, the MBTA Silver Line began operating a route from Chelsea to South Station.

A June 2019 Red Line derailment resulted in train delays for several months, which brought more attention to capital maintenance problems at the T. After complaints from many riders and business groups, the governor proposed adding $50 million for an independent team to speed up inspections and capital projects, and general efforts to speed up existing capital spending from $1 billion to $1.5 billion per year. Replacement of the Red Line signal system was accelerated, including equipment that was damaged in the derailment. Baker proposed allocating to the MBTA $2.7 billion from the state&#x27;s five-year transportation bond bill plus more money from the proposed multi-state Transportation and Climate Initiative.

A December 2019 report by the MBTA&#x27;s Fiscal and Management Control Board panel found that &quot;safety is not the priority at the T, but it must be.&quot; The report said, &quot;There is a general feeling that fiscal controls over the years may have gone too far, which coupled with staff cutting has resulted in the inability to accomplish required maintenance and inspections, or has hampered work keeping legacy system assets fully functional.&quot; In June 2021, the Fiscal and Management Control Board was dissolved, and the following month, Baker signed into law a supplemental budget bill that included a provision creating a permanent MBTA Board of Directors, and Baker appointed the new board the following October. In February 2022, MBTA staff reported to the MBTA Board of Directors safety subcommittee that of 61 recommendations made by the Fiscal and Management Control Board in 2019, two-thirds were complete and one-third were on progress or on hold (including all financial review recommendations). In April 2022, the Federal Transit Administration announced in a letter to MBTA General Manager Steve Poftak that it would assume an increased safety oversight role over the MBTA and would conduct a safety management inspection.

As of 2022, the MBTA had reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 47% from 2009 levels, and now buys or produces 100% renewable electricity.

== Services ==
=== Subway ===

The subway system has three heavy rail rapid transit lines (the Red, Orange and Blue Lines), and two light rail lines (the Green Line and the Mattapan Line, the latter designated an extension of the Red Line). The system operates according to a spoke-hub distribution paradigm, with the lines running radially between central Boston and its environs. It is common usage in Boston to refer to all four of the color-coded rail lines which run underground as &quot;the subway&quot; or &quot;the T&quot;, regardless of the actual railcar equipment used.

All four subway lines cross downtown, forming a quadrilateral configuration, and the Orange and Green Lines (which run approximately parallel in that district) also connect directly at two stations just north of downtown. The Red Line and Blue Line are the only pair of subway lines which do not have a direct transfer connection to each other. Because the various subway lines do not consistently run in any given compass direction, it is customary to refer to line directions as &quot;inbound&quot; or &quot;outbound&quot;. Inbound trains travel towards the four downtown transfer stations, and outbound trains travel away from these hub stations.

The Green Line has four branches in the west: B (Boston College), C (Cleveland Circle), D (Riverside), and E (Heath Street). The A branch formerly went to Watertown, filling in the north-to-south letter assignment pattern, and the E branch formerly continued beyond Heath Street to Arborway.

The Red Line has two branches in the south, Ashmont and Braintree, named after their terminal stations.

The colors were assigned on August 26, 1965, in conjunction with design standards developed by Cambridge Seven Associates, and have served as the primary identifier for the lines since the 1964 reorganization of the MTA into the MBTA. The Orange Line is so named because it used to run along Orange Street (now lower Washington Street), as the former &quot;Orange Street&quot; also was the street that joined the city to the mainland through Boston Neck in colonial times; the Green Line because it runs adjacent to parts of the Emerald Necklace park system; the Blue Line because it runs under Boston Harbor; and the Red Line because its northernmost station was, at that time, at Harvard University, whose school color is crimson.

Opened in September 1897, the four-track-wide segment of the Green Line tunnel between Park Street and Boylston stations was the first subway in the United States, and has been designated a National Historic Landmark. The downtown portions of what are now the Green, Orange, Blue, and Red line tunnels were all in service by 1912. Additions to the rapid transit network occurred in most decades of the 1900s, and continue in the 2000s with the addition of Silver Line bus rapid transit and planned Green Line expansion. (See History and Future plans sections.)

=== Buses ===
The MBTA bus system, the nation&#x27;s sixth largest by ridership, has 152 bus routes. Most routes provide local service in the urban core; smaller local networks are also centered around Waltham, Lynn, and Quincy. The system also includes longer routes serving less-dense suburbs, including several express routes. The buses are colored yellow on maps and in station decor. Most routes are directly operated by the MBTA, though several suburban routes are run by private operators under contract to the MBTA.

The Silver Line is also operated as part of the MBTA bus system. It is designated as bus rapid transit (BRT), even though it lacks some of the characteristics of bus rapid transit. Two routes run on Washington Street between Nubian station and downtown Boston. Three &quot;waterfront&quot; routes run in a dedicated tunnel in South Boston and on the surface, elsewhere including the SL1 route that serves Logan Airport. Washington Street service, a belated replacement for the Washington Street Elevated, began in 2002 and was expanded in 2009. Waterfront service began in 2004, with an expansion to opened in 2018.

MBTA predecessors formerly operated a large trolleybus network, much of which replaced surface streetcar lines. Four lines based out of Harvard station lasted until 2022, when they were replaced with conventional buses. Three Silver Line routes operated as trolleybuses in the Waterfront Tunnel using dual-mode buses until these were replaced with hybrid battery buses in 2023.

=== Commuter rail ===
The MBTA Commuter Rail system is a commuter rail network that reaches from Boston into the suburbs of eastern Massachusetts. The system consists of twelve main lines, three of which have two branches. The rail network operates according to a spoke-hub distribution paradigm, with the lines running radially outward from the city of Boston, with a total of of revenue trackage. Eight of the lines converge at South Station, with four of these passing through Back Bay station. The other four converge at North Station. There is no passenger connection between the two sides; the Grand Junction Railroad is used for non-revenue equipment moves accessing the maintenance facility. The North–South Rail Link has been proposed to connect the two halves of the system; it would be constructed under the Central Artery tunnel of the Big Dig.

Special MBTA trains are run over the Franklin/Foxboro Line and the Providence/Stoughton Line to Foxborough station for New England Patriots home games and other events at Gillette Stadium. The &quot;CapeFLYER&quot; intercity service, operated on summer weekends, uses MBTA equipment and operates over the Middleborough/Lakeville Line. Amtrak runs regularly scheduled intercity rail service over four lines: the &quot;Lake Shore Limited&quot; over the Framingham/Worcester Line, &quot;Acela Express&quot; and &quot;Northeast Regional&quot; services over the Providence/Stoughton Line, and the &quot;Downeaster&quot; over sections of the Lowell Line and Haverhill Line. Freight trains run by Pan Am Southern, Pan Am Railways, CSX Transportation, the Providence and Worcester Railroad, and the Fore River Railroad also use parts of the network.

The first commuter rail service in the United States was operated over what is now the Framingham/Worcester Line beginning in 1834. Within the next several decades, Boston was the center of a massive rail network, with eight trunk lines and dozens of branches. By 1900, ownership was consolidated under the Boston and Maine Railroad to the north, the New York Central Railroad to the west, and the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad to the south. Most branches and one trunk line – the former Old Colony Railroad main – had their passenger services discontinued during the middle of the 20th century. In 1964, the MBTA was formed to fund the failing suburban railroad operations, with an eye towards converting many to extensions of the existing rapid transit system. The first unified branding of the system was applied on October 8, 1974, with &quot;MBTA Commuter Rail&quot; naming and purple coloration analogous to the four subway lines. The system continued to shrink – mostly with the loss of marginal lines with one daily round trip – until 1981. The system has been expanded since, with four lines restored (Fairmount Line in 1979, Old Colony Lines in 1997, and Greenbush Line in 2007), six extended, and a number of stations added and rebuilt, especially on the Fairmount Line.

Each commuter rail line has up to eleven fare zones, numbered 1A and 1 through 10. Riders are charged based on the number of zones they travel through. Tickets can be purchased on the train, from ticket counters or machines in some rail stations, or with a mobile app called mTicket. If a local vendor or ticket machine is available, riders will pay a surcharge for paying with cash on board. Fares range from $2.40 to $13.25, with multi-ride and monthly passes available, and $10 unlimited weekend passes. In 2016, the system averaged 122,600 daily riders, making it the fourth-busiest commuter rail system in the nation.

=== Ferries ===

The MBTA boat system comprises several ferry routes via Boston Harbor. One of these is an inner harbor service, linking the downtown waterfront with the Boston Navy Yard in Charlestown. The other routes are commuter routes, linking downtown to Hingham, Hull, and Salem. Some commuter services operate via Logan International Airport.

All boat services are operated by private sector companies under contract to the MBTA. In FY2005, the MBTA boat system carried 4,650 passengers (0.41% of total MBTA passengers) per weekday. The service is provided through contract of the MBTA by Boston Harbor Cruises (BHC).

=== Paratransit ===
The MBTA contracts out operation of &quot;The Ride&quot;, a door to door service for people with disabilities. Paratransit services carry 5,400 passengers on a typical weekday, or 0.47% of the MBTA system ridership. The two private service providers under contractual agreement with the MBTA for The Ride: Veterans Transportation LLC, and National Express Transit (NEXT).

In September 2016, the MBTA announced that paratransit users would be able to get rides from Uber and Lyft. Riders would pay $2 for a pickup within a few minutes (more for longer trips worth more than $15) instead of $3.15 for a scheduled pickup the next day. The MBTA would pay $13 instead of $31 per ride ($46 per trip when fixed costs of The Ride are considered).

=== Bicycles ===

Conventional bicycles are generally allowed on MBTA commuter rail, commuter boat, and rapid transit lines during off-peak hours and all day on weekends and holidays. However, bicycles are &quot;not&quot; allowed at any time on the Green Line, or the Mattapan Line segment of the Red Line. Buses equipped with bike racks at the front (including the Silver Line) may always accommodate bicycles, up to the capacity limit of the racks. The MBTA claims that 95% of its buses are now equipped with bike racks.

Due to congestion and tight clearances, bicycles are banned from Park Street, Downtown Crossing, and Government Center stations at all times.

However, compact folding bicycles are permitted on all MBTA vehicles at all times, provided that they are kept completely folded for the duration of the trip, including passage through faregates. Gasoline-powered vehicles, bike trailers, and Segways are prohibited.

No special permit is required to take a bicycle onto an MBTA vehicle, but bicyclists are expected to follow the rules and hours of operation. Cyclists under 16 years old are supposed to be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian. Detailed rules, and an explanation of how to use front-of-bus bike racks and bike parking are on the MBTA website.

The MBTA says that over 95% of its stations are equipped with bike racks, many of them under cover from the weather. In addition, over a dozen stations are equipped with &quot;Pedal &amp; Park&quot; fully enclosed areas protected with video surveillance and controlled door access, for improved security. To obtain access, a personally registered CharlieCard must be used. Registration is done online, and requires a valid email address and the serial number of the CharlieCard. All bike parking is free of charge.

=== Parking ===
, the MBTA operates park and ride facilities at 103 locations with a total capacity of 55,000 automobiles, and is the owner of the largest number of off-street paid parking spaces in New England. The number of spaces at stations with parking varies from a few dozen to over 2,500. The larger lots and garages are usually near a major highway exit, and most lots fill up during the morning rush hour. There are some 22,000 spaces on the southern portion of the commuter rail system, 9,400 on the northern portion and 14,600 at subway stations. The parking fee ranges from $4 to $7 per day, and overnight parking (maximum 7 days) is permitted at some stations.

Management for a number of parking lots owned by the MBTA is handled by a private contractor. The 2012 contract with LAZ Parking (which was not its first) was terminated in 2017 after employees were discovered &quot;skimming&quot; revenue; the company paid $5.5 million to settle the case. A new contract with stronger performance incentives and anti-fraud penalties was then awarded to Republic Parking System of Tennessee.

Customers parking in MBTA-owned and operated lots with existing cash &quot;honor boxes&quot; can pay for parking online or via phone while in their cars or once they board a train, bus, or commuter boat. , the MBTA switched from ParkMobile to PayByPhone as its provider for mobile parking payments by smartphone. Monthly parking permits are available, offering a modest discount. Detailed parking information by station is available online, including prices, estimated vacancy rate, and number of accessible and bicycle parking slots.

, the MBTA has a policy for electric vehicle charging stations in its parking spaces, but does not yet have such facilities available.

From time to time the MBTA has made various agreements with companies that contribute to commuting options. One company the MBTA selected was Zipcar; the MBTA provides Zipcar with a limited number of parking spaces at various subway stations throughout the system.

=== Hours of operation ===
Traditionally, the MBTA has stopped running around 1 a.m. each day. Like many subways worldwide, the MBTA&#x27;s subway does not have parallel express and local tracks, so much rail maintenance is only done when the trains are not running. An MBTA spokesperson has said, &quot;with a 109-year-old system you have to be out there every night&quot; to do necessary maintenance. The MBTA did experiment with &quot;Night Owl&quot; substitute bus service from 2001 to 2005, but abandoned it because of insufficient ridership, citing a $7.53 per rider cost to keep the service open, five times the cost per passenger of an average bus route.

A modified form of the MBTA&#x27;s previous &quot;Night Owl&quot; service was experimentally reinstated starting in the spring of 2014 – this time, all subway lines were proposed to run until 3 am on weekends, along with the 15 most heavily used bus lines and the para-transit service &quot;The Ride&quot;.

Starting March 28, 2014, the late-night service began operation on a one-year trial basis, with service continuation depending on late-night ridership and on possible corporate sponsorship. , late-night ridership was stable, and much higher than the earlier failed experimental service. However, it is still unclear whether and on what basis the program might be extended past its first year. The extended hours program has not been implemented on the MBTA commuter rail operations.

In early 2016, the MBTA decided that Late-Night service would be canceled because of lack of funding. The last night for late-night service was on March 19, 2016. The last train left at 2 a.m. on March 19, 2016.

In 2018, the MBTA further tried &quot;Early Morning and Late Night Bus Service Pilots&quot;.
In June 2019, a year after the trials the board voted to make some changes to the schedule which would allow for further late night service to be incorporated long term

== Funding ==
=== Fares and fare collection ===
The MBTA has various fare structures for its various types of service. The plastic CharlieCard electronic farecard is accepted only on the subway and bus systems. Subway and bus systems also directly accept contactless payment via contactless credit card, Apple Pay, or Google Pay using the Charlie system. Commuter rail and ferry accept paper CharlieTickets and the mTicket mobile app. Only buses, surface trolleys, and Commuter Rail accept cash on board, which is discouraged (with a $3 fee for Commuter Rail for stations with fare vending machines). Passengers pay for subway and bus rides at faregates in station entrances or fareboxes in the front of vehicles; MBTA employees manually check tickets on the commuter rail and ferries. For paratransit service, instead of physical fare media passengers maintain an account to which funds can be added by web site, phone, mail, or in-person visit. Trips on The RIDE are booked in advance online or by phone, or subsidized on-demand trips can be requested via Uber or Lyft on those companies&#x27; mobile apps.

Starting June 22, 2020, the short, urban Fairmount Line was incorporated into the subway fare structure in a pilot program that also started running weekday trips every 45 minutes. In addition to the usual Commuter Rail fare media, CharlieCards are now accepted by tapping at fare vending machines and obtaining proof of payment.

Since the 1980s, the MBTA has offered discounted monthly passes on all modes for the convenience of daily commuters and other frequent riders. As of March 2022, it also offers one-day and seven-day passes (often used by tourists) for subway, bus, inner-harbor ferry, and Commuter Rail Zone 1A. Only the CharlieTicket versions of these passes are accepted on all modes. Single-ride CharlieTickets, weekend passes, 5-ride passes, and the mobile app used for the ferries and commuter rail are not accepted for transfers to buses or subways.

The MBTA has periodically raised fares to match inflation and keep the system financially solvent. A substantial increase effective July 2012 raised public ire including an &quot;Occupy the MBTA&quot; protest. A transportation funding law passed in 2013 limits MBTA fare increases to 7% every two years. Subsequent fare increases took place in 2014, 2016, and 2019.

Several local politicians, including Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, Representative Ayanna Pressley, and Senator Edward J. Markey, have proposed to eliminate MBTA fares.

The ongoing &quot;Fare Transformation&quot; project adds contactless credit cards, Apple Pay, and Google Pay as payment methods for all subway and bus lines so passengers will not need to purchase a CharlieCard or CharlieTicket. This system was activated on August 1st, 2024. It also adds all-door boarding on all buses and surface trolleys, using a proof of payment system. A new website is planned to allow passengers and employers to perform self-service CharlieCard transactions. &quot;Fare Transformation&quot;, originally scheduled to be completed in 2021 under the name &quot;AFC 2.0&quot;, and activated on buses and subway lines on August 1st, 2024, is now expected to be completed in 2025.

==== Subway and bus ====

All subway trips (Green Line, Blue Line, Orange Line, Red Line, Mattapan Line, and the Waterfront section of the Silver Line) cost $2.40 for all users. Local bus and trackless trolley fares (including the Washington Street section of the Silver Line) are $1.70 for all users.
Paying directly with cash is only available on buses, Green Line surface stops, and the Mattapan Line; from 2007 to 2020, the higher CharlieTicket price was charged.

All transfers between subway lines are free with all fare media, without the need to pass through fare control (except when continuing in either direction at Ashmont Station). Passengers using CharlieCards can transfer free from a subway to a bus, and from a bus to a subway for the difference in price (&quot;step-up fare&quot;). CharlieTicket holders can transfer free between buses, but not between subway and bus, except free subway transfers are given for the Silver Line at Airport station and SL4/SL5 branches.

The MBTA operates &quot;Inner Express&quot; and &quot;Outer Express&quot; buses to suburbs outside the subway system. Inner Express bus trips cost $4.25; Outer Express trips cost $5.25. Free transfers are available to the subway and local buses with a CharlieCard, and to local buses with a CharlieTicket.

CharlieTickets are available from ticket vending machines in MBTA rapid transit stations. Following the installation of upgraded fare vending machines in July 2022, CharlieCards are now available for purchase from all subway lines and Silver Line stations. CharlieCards were not previously dispensed by the machines but were available free of charge on request at most MBTA Customer Service booths in stations, or at the CharlieCard Store at Downtown Crossing station. As given out, the CharlieCards are &quot;empty&quot;, and must have value added at an MBTA ticket machine before they can be used.

The fare system, including on-board and in-station fare vending machines, was purchased from German-based Scheidt and Bachmann, which developed the technology. The CharlieCards were developed by Gemalto and later by Giesecke &amp; Devrient. In 2006, electronic fares replaced metal tokens, which had been used on and off by transit systems in Boston for over a century.

Upon introduction in 2007, fares for reloadable CharlieCard contactless smart cards were substantially lower, to encourage riders to use them. The alternative magnetic stripe CharlieTickets were not as durable (and so could only be loaded once), were slower to read, and required maintenance of machines with moving parts.

In 2020, the MBTA started implementation of its &quot;Fare Transformation&quot; program, reducing cash-on-board and CharlieTicket prices to the CharlieCard level. In the fall of that year, the agency started upgrading a portion of faregates at all stations to accept only contactless cards, in anticipation of the phase-out of paper CharlieTickets, which occurred on March 31, 2022. The gates also feature an optical reader, which is currently unused but is capable of scanning QR codes or bar codes, such as those generated by the mTicket app.

Installation of upgraded fare vending machines was completed in July 2022, allowing riders to purchase CharlieCards and the new tappable CharlieTickets at any rapid transit station. These also serve as fare validation points for proof of payment on the Green Line Extension.

As of July 1, 2022, two free transfers will be given to CharlieCard stored-value users for all combinations of subway, bus, and express bus rides.

==== Subway and bus fare history ====

 Experimental reduced fare program, &quot;Dime Time&quot;, for all persons entering rapid transit stations between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m., Monday through Friday. Extended weekday hours to 2 p.m. and to all day Sunday in 1974. Ended July 31, 1975.

Until 2007, not all subway fares were identical – passengers were not charged for boarding outbound Green Line trains at surface stops, while double fares were charged for the outer ends of the Green Line D branch and the Red Line Braintree branch. As part of a general fare hike effective January 1, 2007, the MBTA eliminated these inconsistent fares.

Because there was no farebox on the left-facing door, passengers on the 71 and 73 trolleybuses in Cambridge who boarded through that door underground in Harvard station instead paid the only remaining exit fare in the system. This was eliminated starting March 13, 2022, when the trackless trolleys were replaced by conventional buses to allow the Cambridge garage to convert to service battery-electric buses.

==== Commuter Rail ====

Commuter rail fares are on a zone-based system, with fares dependent on the distance from downtown. Rides between Zone 1A stations – South Station, Back Bay, most of the Fairmount Line, and eight other stations within several miles of downtown – cost $2.40, the same as a subway fare with a CharlieCard. Fares for other stations range from $5.75 from Zone 1 (~5–10 miles from downtown) to $14.50 from Zone 10 (~60 miles). All Massachusetts stations are Zone 8 or closer; only T.F. Green Airport and Wickford Junction in Rhode Island are Zone 9 and 10.

Interzone fares – for trips that do not go to Zone 1A – are offered at a substantial discount to encourage riders to take the commuter rail for less common commuting patterns for which transit is not usually taken. Discounted monthly passes are available for all trips; 10-ride passes at full price are also available for trips to Zone 1A. All monthly passes include unlimited trips on the subway and local bus; some outer-zone monthlies also offer free use of express buses and ferries. A cash-on-board surcharge of $3.00 is added for trips originating from stations with fare vending machines.

Starting in spring 2022, the MBTA began installing fare gates at North Station, South Station, and Back Bay station as part of its &quot;Fare Transformation&quot; project. These three stations are the start and end points of the vast majority of Commuter Rail trips, and the gates eliminate the possibility of passengers boarding without tickets or without having a single-use ticket invalidated (though conductors will still manually verify passengers leave the train in the zone they paid for). A common complaint from monthly pass holders was that on-board conductors would sometimes fail to check any tickets for their car, giving a free ride to single-ride and cash-on-board passengers. The new gates have scanners for bar codes on paper tickets, the mTicket app, Amtrak tickets, and military IDs. They also have a reader for tappable CharlieTickets (and CharlieCards, to prepare for potential future use on the Commuter Rail).

==== MBTA boat ====
The Inner Harbor Ferry costs $3.25 per ride, and is grouped as a Zone 1A monthly commuter rail pass. Single rides cost $8.50 from Hull or Hingham to Boston, $17.00 from Hull or Hingham to Logan Airport, and $13.75 from Boston to Logan Airport.

==== The Ride ====
Fares on The Ride, the MBTA&#x27;s paratransit program, are structured differently from other modes. Passengers using The Ride must maintain an account with the MBTA in order to pay for service. Fares are $3.35 for &quot;ADA trips&quot; originating within of fixed-route bus or subway service and booked in advance, and $5.60 for &quot;premium trips&quot; outside the mandated area.

==== Discounted fares ====
Discounted fares as well as discounted monthly local bus and subway passes are available to seniors aged 65 and older, and passengers who are permanently disabled who utilize a special photo CharlieCard (called &quot;Senior ID&quot; and &quot;Transportation Access Pass&quot;, respectively). Holders of these passes are also entitled to 50% off the Commuter Rail fares. Passengers who are legally blind ride for free on all MBTA services (including express buses and the Commuter Rail) with a &quot;Blind Access Card&quot;.

Children under 12 ride for free with an adult (up to 2 per adult). Military personnel, state police officers, police officers and firefighters from the MBTA service area, and certain government officials (Commonwealth Department of Public Utilities employees and state elevator inspectors) ride at no charge upon presentation of proper ID, or if dressed in official work uniforms.

Middle school and high school students receive the aforementioned discounts on fares. Student discounts require a &quot;Student CharlieCard&quot; or &quot;S-Card&quot; issued through the holder&#x27;s school which is valid year-round. College students are not generally eligible for reduced fares, but some colleges offer a &quot;Semester Pass&quot; program. A special &quot;Youth Pass&quot; program was introduced in 2017, allowing young adults less than 25 years old who reside in participating cities or towns and are enrolled in specific low income programs to pay reduced fares.

====Employer and college subsidized====

Federal law allows employers to deduct the cost of transit passes from wages on a pre-tax basis. Some employers and colleges also choose to subsidize the cost of these passes for employees or students. The MBTA has long had a program that facilitates these bulk purchases for monthly passes. In 2016, it began allowing MIT to subsidize on a per-ride basis, which is considerably cheaper to the institution; this expanded to other employers in 2022.

=== Budget ===
Since the &quot;forward funding&quot; reform in 2000, the MBTA is funded primarily through 16% of the state sales tax excluding the meals tax (with minimum dollar amount guarantee), which is set at 6.25% statewide, and therefore equal to 1% of taxable non-meal purchases statewide. The authority is also funded by passenger fares and formula assessments of the cities and towns in its service area (excepting those which are assessed for the MetroWest Regional Transit Authority). Supplemental income is obtained from its paid parking lots, renting space to retail vendors in and around stations, rents from utility companies using MBTA rights of way, selling surplus land and movable property, advertising on vehicles and properties, and federal operating funding for special programs.

A May 2019 report found the MBTA had a maintenance backlog of approximately $10 billion, which it hopes to clear by 2032 by increasing spending on capital projects.

The Capital Investment Program is a rolling 5-year plan which programs capital expenses. The draft FY2009-2014 CIP allocates $3,795M, including $879M in projects funded from non-MBTA state sources (required for Clean Air Act compliance), and $299M in projects with one-time federal funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Capital projects are paid for by federal grants, allocations from the general budget of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (for legal commitments and expansion projects) and MBTA bonds (which are paid off through the operating budget). The FY2014 budget includes $1.422 billion for operating expenses and $443.8M in debt and lease payments.

The FY2010 budget was supplemented by $160 million in sales tax revenue when the statewide rate was raised from 5% to 6.25%, to avoid service cuts or a fare increase in a year when deferred debt payments were coming due.

=== Capital improvements and planning process ===
The Boston Metropolitan Planning Organization is responsible for overall regional surface transportation planning. As required by federal law for projects to be eligible for federal funding (except earmarks), the MPO maintains a fiscally constrained 20+ year Regional Transportation Plan for surface transportation expansion, the current edition of which is called &quot;Journey to 2030&quot;. The required 4-year MPO plan is called the Transportation Improvement Plan.

The MBTA maintains its own 25-year capital planning document, called the Program for Mass Transportation, which is fiscally unconstrained. The agency&#x27;s 4-year plan is called the Capital Improvement Plan; it is the primary mechanism by which money is actually allocated to capital projects. Major capital spending projects must be approved by the MBTA Board, and except for unexpected needs, are usually included in the initial CIP.

In addition to federal funds programmed through the Boston MPO, and MBTA capital funds derived from fares, sales tax, municipal assessments, and other minor internal sources, the T receives funding from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for certain projects. The state may fund items in the State Implementation Plan (SIP) – such as the Big Dig mitigation projects – which is the plan required under the Clean Air Act to reduce air pollution. (, all of Massachusetts is designated as a clean air &quot;non-attainment&quot; zone.)

=== Projects underway and future plans ===
==== Blue Line ====
There is a proposal to extend the Blue Line northward to Lynn, with two potential extension routes having been identified. One proposed path would run through marshland alongside the existing Newburyport/Rockport commuter rail line, while the other would extend the line along the remainder of the BRB&amp;L right of way.

In addition, the MBTA has committed to designing an extension of the line&#x27;s southern terminus westward to Charles/MGH, where it would connect with the Red Line. This was one of the mitigation measures the Commonwealth of Massachusetts agreed to offset increased automobile emissions from the Big Dig, but it was later replaced in this agreement by other projects.

==== Orange and Red Lines ====

In October 2013, MassDOT announced plans for a $1.3 billion subway car order for the Orange and Red Lines, which would replace and expand the existing car fleets and add more frequent service. The MassDOT Board awarded a $566.6 million contract to a China based manufacturer CNR (which became part of CRRC the following year) to build 404 replacement railcars for the Orange Line and Red Line. The other bidders were Bombardier Transportation, Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Hyundai Rotem. The Board forwent federal funding to allow the contract to specify the cars be built in Massachusetts, in order to create a local railcar manufacturing industry. CNR began assembling the cars at a new manufacturing plant in Springfield, Massachusetts, with initial deliveries expected in 2018 and all cars in service by 2023. However, by the beginning of 2023, only 78 of the promised 152 Orange Line cars had been delivered. In a letter dated December 22, 2022, from the MBTA&#x27;s Deputy Director of Vehicle Engineering to CRRC, the former complains of &quot;several significant lapses in overall quality management for the Red and Orange Line project&quot; with &quot;no meaningful progress...made by CRRC to address these concerns despite several commitments by CRRC&#x27;s Management to address these over the period of the last several years&quot; On January 6, 2023, the MBTA announced its intention to keep the older Orange Line cars as &quot;a backup plan&quot;.

In addition to the new rolling stock, the $1.3 billion allocated for the project will pay for testing, signal improvements and expanded maintenance facilities, as well as other related expenses. Sixty percent of the car&#x27;s components are sourced from the United States. Replacement of the signal systems, which will increase reliability and allow more frequent trains, was expected to be complete by 2022, with a total cost of $218 million for both lines. As of the end of 2022, the project was described by the MBTA as &quot;48% complete&quot;

==== Commuter rail ====

The first phase of the South Coast Rail project began construction in 2020 and is planned to open in May 2025. It will extend the Middleborough/Lakeville Line to Fall River, and New Bedford. The second phase of the project, planned for 2030, will add a more direct routing via .

The MBTA plans to convert the system from diesel-powered commuter rail – which is primarily designed for Boston-centric trips at peak hours – to an electric regional rail system with frequent all-day service. In June 2022, the MBTA indicated plans to purchase battery electric multiple units, with catenary for charging on part of the network. Plans call for electric service on the Providence/Stoughton Line and Fairmount line by 2028–29, followed by the Newburyport/Rockport Line in 2031; all lines would be electrified by 2050.

No direct connection exists between the two downtown commuter rail terminals; passengers must use the MBTA subway or other modes to transfer between the two halves of the system. (For non-revenue transfers of equipment, the MBTA and Amtrak use the Grand Junction Branch.) The proposed North–South Rail Link would add a new rail tunnel under downtown Boston to allow through-running service, with new underground stations at South Station, North Station, and possibly a new Central Station. A feasibility study was conducted in 2018.

Two other extensions of existing lines have been studied in the 2020s: extension of the Middleborough/Lakeville Line to or , and extension of the Lowell Line to New Hampshire.

== MBTA Massachusetts Realty Group ==

As one of the most expansive land owners throughout the Commonwealth, the MBTA established a joint public-private management agency for managing the MBTA&#x27;s vast inventory of property holdings and land.

This allows the transit authority to work with entities to obtain right-of-way (ROW) grant on property which the MBTA administers. The agency assists with the processing of all ROW applications as efficiently and economically as possible, and authorizes these grants at the authorized officer&#x27;s discretion. Generally, the ROW is granted for an additional stream of revenue to the MBTA outside of normal fare revenue. The agency additionally facilitates persons or organizations wanting to provide concessions, or public advertising potential; or the awardance of property easements.

Occasionally sale of some surplus under-utilized public space under the MBTA real estate agency&#x27;s responsibility are disposed of though bidding. This may include lands formerly in use as the state&#x27;s streetcar network, equipment depots, electric substations, former railroad lines &amp; yards or other properties. Given the vast long-haul rail routes, the MBTA further determined its desire to work with distance providers of telecom or utilities to provide authorization to use pieces of public land for ROW projects, including: renewable energy installs, electric power lines &amp; energy corridors, optical fibre lines, communications sites, road, trail, canal, flume, pipeline or reservoir uses.

== Management and administration ==
===Structure===
In 2015, Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker signed new legislation creating a financial control board to oversee the MBTA, replacing the Massachusetts Department of Transportation&#x27;s Board of Directors in the role of overseeing the transit authority. The Fiscal and Management Control Board (FMCB) started meeting in July 2015 and was charged with bringing financial stability to the agency. It reported to Massachusetts Secretary of Transportation Stephanie Pollack. Three of the five members of the MBTA FMCB were also members of the Massachusetts Department of Transportation. The FMCB&#x27;s term expired at the end of June 2021 and was not extended. It was dissolved and replaced by a new governing body known simply as the MBTA Board of Directors and consisting of seven members.

The Massachusetts Secretary of Transportation leads the executive management team of MassDOT in addition to serving in the Governor&#x27;s Cabinet. The MBTA&#x27;s executive management team is led by its General Manager, who is currently also serving as the MassDOT Rail and Transit Administrator, overseeing all public transit in the state.

The MBTA Advisory Board represents the cities and towns in the MBTA service district. The municipalities are assessed a total of $143M annually (). In return, the advisory board has veto power over the MBTA operating and capital budgets, including the power to reduce the overall amount.

The MBTA is headquartered in the State Transportation Building (10 Park Plaza) in Boston, with the operations control center at 45 High Street. The agency operates service from a number of bus garages, rail yards, and maintenance facilities. The MBTA maintains its own police force, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Police, which has jurisdiction in MBTA facilities and vehicles.

=== Employees and unions ===
, the MBTA employs 6,346 workers, of which roughly 600 are in part-time jobs.

Many MBTA employees are represented by unions, with a growing number of full-time non-union contractors. The largest union of the MBTA is the Carmen&#x27;s Union (Local 589), representing bus and subway operators. This includes full and part-time bus drivers, motorpersons and streetcar motorpersons, full and part-time train attendants, and Customer Service Agents (CSAs). Further unions include the Machinists Union, Local 264; Electrical Workers Union, Local 717; the Welder&#x27;s Union, Local 651; the Executive Union; the Office and Professional Employees International Union, Local 453; the Professional and Technical Engineers Union, Local 105; and the Office and Professional Employees Union, Local 6.

Within the authority, employees are ranked according to seniority (or &quot;rating&quot;). This is categorized by an employee&#x27;s five or six-digit badge number, though some of the longest serving employees still have only three or four-digits. An employee&#x27;s badge number indicates the relative length of employment with the MBTA; badges are issued in sequential order. The rating structure determines many different things, including the rank in which perks are to be offered to employee, such as: When offering the choice for quarter-annual route assignments (&quot;picks&quot;), overtime offerings, and even the rank to transfer new hires from part-time roles to a full-time role.

== In popular culture ==
In 1951, the growing subway network was the setting of &quot;A Subway Named Mobius&quot;, a science fiction short story written by the American astronomer Armin Joseph Deutsch. The tale described a Boston subway train which accidentally became a &quot;phantom&quot; by becoming lost in the fourth dimension, analogous to a topological Mobius strip. In 2001, a half-century later, the narrative was nominated for a Retro Hugo Award for Best Short Story at the World Science Fiction Convention.

In 1959, the satirical song &quot;M.T.A.&quot; (informally known as &quot;Charlie on the MTA&quot;) was a hit single, as performed by the folksingers the Kingston Trio. It tells the absurd story of a passenger named Charlie, who cannot pay a newly imposed 5-cent exit fare, and thus remains trapped in the subway system.

<text>In particle physics, a meson () is a type of hadronic subatomic particle composed of an equal number of quarks and antiquarks, usually one of each, bound together by the strong interaction. Because mesons are composed of quark subparticles, they have a meaningful physical size, a diameter of roughly one femtometre (10 m), which is about 0.6 times the size of a proton or neutron. All mesons are unstable, with the longest-lived lasting for only a few tenths of a nanosecond. Heavier mesons decay to lighter mesons and ultimately to stable electrons, neutrinos and photons.

Outside the nucleus, mesons appear in nature only as short-lived products of very high-energy collisions between particles made of quarks, such as cosmic rays (high-energy protons and neutrons) and baryonic matter. Mesons are routinely produced artificially in cyclotrons or other particle accelerators in the collisions of protons, antiprotons, or other particles.

Higher-energy (more massive) mesons were created momentarily in the Big Bang, but are not thought to play a role in nature today. However, such heavy mesons are regularly created in particle accelerator experiments that explore the nature of the heavier quarks that compose the heavier mesons.

Mesons are part of the hadron particle family, which are defined simply as particles composed of two or more quarks. The other members of the hadron family are the baryons: subatomic particles composed of odd numbers of valence quarks (at least three), and some experiments show evidence of exotic mesons, which do not have the conventional valence quark content of two quarks (one quark and one antiquark), but four or more.

Because quarks have a spin , the difference in quark number between mesons and baryons results in conventional two-quark mesons being bosons, whereas baryons are fermions.

Each type of meson has a corresponding antiparticle (antimeson) in which quarks are replaced by their corresponding antiquarks and vice versa. For example, a positive pion () is made of one up quark and one down antiquark; and its corresponding antiparticle, the negative pion (), is made of one up antiquark and one down quark.

Because mesons are composed of quarks, they participate in both the weak interaction and strong interaction. Mesons with net electric charge also participate in the electromagnetic interaction. Mesons are classified according to their quark content, total angular momentum, parity and various other properties, such as C-parity and G-parity. Although no meson is stable, those of lower mass are nonetheless more stable than the more massive, and hence are easier to observe and study in particle accelerators or in cosmic ray experiments. The lightest group of mesons is less massive than the lightest group of baryons, meaning that they are more easily produced in experiments, and thus exhibit certain higher-energy phenomena more readily than do baryons. But mesons can be quite massive: for example, the J/Psi meson () containing the charm quark, first seen 1974, is about three times as massive as a proton, and the upsilon meson () containing the bottom quark, first seen in 1977, is about ten times as massive as a proton.

== History ==
From theoretical considerations, in 1934 Hideki Yukawa predicted the existence and the approximate mass of the &quot;meson&quot; as the carrier of the nuclear force that holds atomic nuclei together. If there were no nuclear force, all nuclei with two or more protons would fly apart due to electromagnetic repulsion. Yukawa called his carrier particle the meson, from μέσος &quot;mesos&quot;, the Greek word for &quot;intermediate&quot;, because its predicted mass was between that of the electron and that of the proton, which has about 1,836 times the mass of the electron. Yukawa or Carl David Anderson, who discovered the muon, had originally named the particle the &quot;mesotron&quot;, but he was corrected by the physicist Werner Heisenberg (whose father was a professor of Greek at the University of Munich). Heisenberg pointed out that there is no &quot;tr&quot; in the Greek word &quot;mesos&quot;.

The first candidate for Yukawa&#x27;s meson, in modern terminology known as the muon, was discovered in 1936 by Carl David Anderson and others in the decay products of cosmic ray interactions. The &quot;mu meson&quot; had about the right mass to be Yukawa&#x27;s carrier of the strong nuclear force, but over the course of the next decade, it became evident that it was not the right particle. It was eventually found that the &quot;mu meson&quot; did not participate in the strong nuclear interaction at all, but rather behaved like a heavy version of the electron, and was eventually classed as a lepton like the electron, rather than a meson. Physicists in making this choice decided that properties other than particle mass should control their classification.

There were years of delays in the subatomic particle research during World War II (1939–1945), with most physicists working in applied projects for wartime necessities. When the war ended in August 1945, many physicists gradually returned to peacetime research. The first true meson to be discovered was what would later be called the &quot;pi meson&quot; (or pion). During 1939–1942, Debendra Mohan Bose and Bibha Chowdhuri exposed Ilford half-tone photographic plates in the high altitude mountainous regions of Darjeeling, and observed long curved ionizing tracks that appeared to be different from the tracks of alpha particles or protons. In a series of articles published in &quot;Nature&quot;, they identified a cosmic particle having an average mass close to 200 times the mass of electron. This discovery was made in 1947 with improved full-tone photographic emulsion plates, by Cecil Powell, Hugh Muirhead, César Lattes, and Giuseppe Occhialini, who were investigating cosmic ray products at the University of Bristol in England, based on photographic films placed in the Andes mountains. Some of those mesons had about the same mass as the already-known mu &quot;meson&quot;, yet seemed to decay into it, leading physicist Robert Marshak to hypothesize in 1947 that it was actually a new and different meson. Over the next few years, more experiments showed that the pion was indeed involved in strong interactions. The pion (as a virtual particle) is also used as force carrier to model the nuclear force in atomic nuclei (between protons and neutrons). This is an approximation, as the actual carrier of the strong force is believed to be the gluon, which is explicitly used to model strong interaction between quarks. Other mesons, such as the virtual rho mesons are used to model this force as well, but to a lesser extent. Following the discovery of the pion, Yukawa was awarded the 1949 Nobel Prize in Physics for his predictions.

For a while in the past, the word &quot;meson&quot; was sometimes used to mean &quot;any&quot; force carrier, such as &quot;the Z meson&quot;, which is involved in mediating the weak interaction. However, this use has fallen out of favor, and mesons are now defined as particles composed of pairs of quarks and antiquarks.

== Overview ==

=== Spin, orbital angular momentum, and total angular momentum ===

Spin (quantum number ) is a vector quantity that represents the &quot;intrinsic&quot; angular momentum of a particle. It comes in increments of  .

Quarks are fermions—specifically in this case, particles having spin Because spin projections vary in increments of 1 (that is 1 ), a single quark has a spin vector of length , and has two spin projections, either or Two quarks can have their spins aligned, in which case the two spin vectors add to make a vector of length with three possible spin projections and and their combination is called a &quot;vector meson&quot; or spin-1 triplet. If two quarks have oppositely aligned spins, the spin vectors add up to make a vector of length and only one spin projection called a &quot;scalar meson&quot; or spin-0 singlet. Because mesons are made of one quark and one antiquark, they are found in triplet and singlet spin states. The latter are called scalar mesons or pseudoscalar mesons, depending on their parity (see below).

There is another quantity of quantized angular momentum, called the orbital angular momentum (quantum number ), that is the angular momentum due to quarks orbiting each other, and also comes in increments of 1 . The total angular momentum (quantum number ) of a particle is the combination of the two intrinsic angular momentums (spin) and the orbital angular momentum. It can take any value from up to in increments of 1.

Particle physicists are most interested in mesons with no orbital angular momentum ( = 0), therefore the two groups of mesons most studied are the  = 1;  = 0 and  = 0;  = 0, which corresponds to  = 1 and  = 0, although they are not the only ones. It is also possible to obtain  = 1 particles from  = 0 and  = 1. How to distinguish between the  = 1,  = 0 and  = 0,  = 1 mesons is an active area of research in meson spectroscopy.

=== -parity ===

-parity is left-right parity, or spatial parity, and was the first of several &quot;parities&quot; discovered, and so is often called just &quot;parity&quot;. If the universe were reflected in a mirror, most laws of physics would be identical—things would behave the same way regardless of what we call &quot;left&quot; and what we call &quot;right&quot;. This concept of mirror reflection is called parity (). Gravity, the electromagnetic force, and the strong interaction all behave in the same way regardless of whether or not the universe is reflected in a mirror, and thus are said to conserve parity (-symmetry). However, the weak interaction does&quot; &quot;distinguish &quot;left&quot; from &quot;right&quot;, a phenomenon called parity violation (-violation).

Based on this, one might think that, if the wavefunction for each particle (more precisely, the quantum field for each particle type) were simultaneously mirror-reversed, then the new set of wavefunctions would perfectly satisfy the laws of physics (apart from the weak interaction). It turns out that this is not quite true: In order for the equations to be satisfied, the wavefunctions of certain types of particles have to be multiplied by −1, in addition to being mirror-reversed. Such particle types are said to have &quot;negative&quot; or &quot;odd&quot; parity ( = −1, or alternatively  = −), whereas the other particles are said to have &quot;positive&quot; or &quot;even&quot; parity ( = +1, or alternatively  = +).

For mesons, parity is related to the orbital angular momentum by the relation:

: formula_1
where the is a result of the parity of the corresponding spherical harmonic of the wavefunction. The &quot;+1&quot; comes from the fact that, according to the Dirac equation, a quark and an antiquark have opposite intrinsic parities. Therefore, the intrinsic parity of a meson is the product of the intrinsic parities of the quark (+1) and antiquark (−1). As these are different, their product is −1, and so it contributes the &quot;+1&quot; that appears in the exponent.

As a consequence, all mesons with no orbital angular momentum ( = 0) have odd parity ( = −1).

=== C-parity ===

-parity is only defined for mesons that are their own antiparticle (i.e. neutral mesons). It represents whether or not the wavefunction of the meson remains the same under the interchange of their quark with their antiquark. If
: formula_2
then, the meson is &quot; even&quot; ( = +1). On the other hand, if
: formula_3

then the meson is &quot; odd&quot; ( = −1).

-parity rarely is studied on its own, but more commonly in combination with P-parity into CP-parity. -parity was originally thought to be conserved, but was later found to be violated on rare occasions in weak interactions.

=== -parity ===

-parity is a generalization of the -parity. Instead of simply comparing the wavefunction after exchanging quarks and antiquarks, it compares the wavefunction after exchanging the meson for the corresponding antimeson, regardless of quark content.

If
: formula_4
then, the meson is &quot; even&quot; ( = +1). On the other hand, if
: formula_5
then the meson is &quot; odd&quot; ( = −1).

=== Isospin and charge ===

==== Original isospin model ====
The concept of isospin was first proposed by Werner Heisenberg in 1932 to explain the similarities between protons and neutrons under the strong interaction. Although they had different electric charges, their masses were so similar that physicists believed that they were actually the same particle. The different electric charges were explained as being the result of some unknown excitation similar to spin. This unknown excitation was later dubbed &quot;isospin&quot; by Eugene Wigner in 1937.

When the first mesons were discovered, they too were seen through the eyes of isospin and so the three pions were believed to be the same particle, but in different isospin states.

The mathematics of isospin was modeled after the mathematics of spin. Isospin projections varied in increments of 1 just like those of spin, and to each projection was associated a &quot;charged state&quot;. Because the &quot;pion particle&quot; had three &quot;charged states&quot;, it was said to be of isospin Its &quot;charged states&quot; , , and , corresponded to the isospin projections and respectively. Another example is the &quot;rho particle&quot;, also with three charged states. Its &quot;charged states&quot; , , and , corresponded to the isospin projections and respectively.

==== Replacement by the quark model ====
This belief lasted until Murray Gell-Mann proposed the quark model in 1964 (containing originally only the , , and quarks). The success of the isospin model is now understood to be an artifact of the similar masses of the and quarks. Because the and quarks have similar masses, particles made of the same number of them also have similar masses.

The exact and quark composition determines the charge, because quarks carry charge whereas quarks carry charge . For example, the three pions all have different charges
* = a quantum superposition of ) and states 
but they all have similar masses ( ) as they are each composed of a same total number of up and down quarks and antiquarks. Under the isospin model, they were considered a single particle in different charged states.

After the quark model was adopted, physicists noted that the isospin projections were related to the up and down quark content of particles by the relation
: formula_6
where the -symbols are the count of up and down quarks and antiquarks.

In the &quot;isospin picture&quot;, the three pions and three rhos were thought to be the different states of two particles. However, in the quark model, the rhos are excited states of pions. Isospin, although conveying an inaccurate picture of things, is still used to classify hadrons, leading to unnatural and often confusing nomenclature.

Because mesons are hadrons, the isospin classification is also used for them all, with the quantum number calculated by adding for each positively charged up-or-down quark-or-antiquark (up quarks and down antiquarks), and for each negatively charged up-or-down quark-or-antiquark (up antiquarks and down quarks).

=== Flavour quantum numbers ===

The strangeness quantum number &quot;S&quot; (not to be confused with spin) was noticed to go up and down along with particle mass. The higher the mass, the lower (more negative) the strangeness (the more s quarks). Particles could be described with isospin projections (related to charge) and strangeness (mass) (see the uds nonet figures). As other quarks were discovered, new quantum numbers were made to have similar description of udc and udb nonets. Because only the u and d mass are similar, this description of particle mass and charge in terms of isospin and flavour quantum numbers only works well for the nonets made of one u, one d and one other quark and breaks down for the other nonets (for example ucb nonet). If the quarks all had the same mass, their behaviour would be called &quot;symmetric&quot;, because they would all behave in exactly the same way with respect to the strong interaction. However, as quarks do not have the same mass, they do not interact in the same way (exactly like an electron placed in an electric field will accelerate more than a proton placed in the same field because of its lighter mass), and the symmetry is said to be broken.

It was noted that charge (&quot;Q&quot;) was related to the isospin projection (&quot;I&quot;3), the baryon number (&quot;B&quot;) and flavour quantum numbers (&quot;S&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;T&quot;) by the Gell-Mann–Nishijima formula:
: formula_7
where &quot;S&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;T&quot; represent the strangeness, charm, bottomness and topness flavour quantum numbers respectively. They are related to the number of strange, charm, bottom, and top quarks and antiquark according to the relations:
: formula_8
meaning that the Gell-Mann–Nishijima formula is equivalent to the expression of charge in terms of quark content:
: formula_9

== Classification ==

Mesons are classified into groups according to their isospin (&quot;I&quot;), total angular momentum (&quot;J&quot;), parity (&quot;P&quot;), G-parity (&quot;G&quot;) or C-parity (&quot;C&quot;) when applicable, and quark (q) content. The rules for classification are defined by the Particle Data Group, and are rather convoluted. The rules are presented below, in table form for simplicity.

=== Types of meson ===

Mesons are classified into types according to their spin configurations. Some specific configurations are given special names based on the mathematical properties of their spin configuration.

=== Nomenclature ===

==== Flavourless mesons ====
Flavourless mesons are mesons made of pair of quark and antiquarks of the same flavour (all their flavour quantum numbers are zero:  = 0,  = 0,  = 0,  = 0). The rules for flavourless mesons are:


;In addition:
* When the spectroscopic state of the meson is known, it is added in parentheses.
* When the spectroscopic state is unknown, mass (in MeV/&quot;c&quot;2) is added in parentheses.
* When the meson is in its ground state, nothing is added in parentheses.

==== Flavoured mesons ====
Flavoured mesons are mesons made of pair of quark and antiquarks of different flavours. The rules are simpler in this case: The main symbol depends on the heavier quark, the superscript depends on the charge, and the subscript (if any) depends on the lighter quark. In table form, they are:

;In addition:
* If P is in the &quot;normal series&quot; (i.e., P = 0+, 1−, 2+, 3−, ...), a superscript ∗ is added.
* If the meson is not pseudoscalar (P = 0−) or vector (P = 1−), is added as a subscript.
* When the spectroscopic state of the meson is known, it is added in parentheses.
* When the spectroscopic state is unknown, mass (in MeV/&quot;c&quot;2) is added in parentheses.
* When the meson is in its ground state, nothing is added in parentheses.

== Exotic mesons ==

There is experimental evidence for particles that are hadrons (i.e., are composed of quarks) and are color-neutral with zero baryon number, and thus by conventional definition are mesons. Yet, these particles do not consist of a single quark/antiquark pair, as all the other conventional mesons discussed above do. A tentative category for these particles is exotic mesons.

There are at least five exotic meson resonances that have been experimentally confirmed to exist by two or more independent experiments. The most statistically significant of these is the Z(4430), discovered by the Belle experiment in 2007 and confirmed by LHCb in 2014. It is a candidate for being a tetraquark: a particle composed of two quarks and two antiquarks. See the main article above for other particle resonances that are candidates for being exotic mesons.

== List ==
=== Pseudoscalar mesons ===
[a] Makeup inexact due to non-zero quark masses.&lt;br&gt;
[b] PDG reports the resonance width (Γ). Here the conversion τ =  is given instead.&lt;br&gt;
[c] Strong eigenstate. No definite lifetime (see kaon notes below)&lt;br&gt;
[d] The mass of the and are given as that of the . However, it is known that a difference between the masses of the and on the order of exists.&lt;br&gt;
[e] Weak eigenstate. Makeup is missing small CP–violating term (see notes on neutral kaons below).

=== Vector mesons ===
[f] PDG reports the resonance width (Γ). Here the conversion τ =  is given instead.&lt;br&gt;
[g] The exact value depends on the method used. See the given reference for detail.

=== Notes on neutral kaons ===
There are two complications with neutral kaons:
* Due to neutral kaon mixing, the and are not eigenstates of strangeness. However, they &quot;are&quot; eigenstates of the weak force, which determines how they decay, so these are the particles with definite lifetime.
* The linear combinations given in the table for the and are not exactly correct, since there is a small correction due to CP violation. See CP violation in kaons.

Note that these issues also exist in principle for other neutral, flavored mesons; however, the weak eigenstates are considered separate particles only for kaons because of their dramatically different lifetimes.

<text>Marvel Super Heroes (&quot;MSH&quot;) is a licensed role playing game set in the Marvel Universe, first published by TSR in 1984. The game lets players assume the roles of Marvel superheroes such as Spider-Man, Daredevil, Hulk, Captain America, the Fantastic Four, and the X-Men. The game was designed to be easily understood, and this approach proved popular. TSR published an expanded edition, &quot;Marvel Superheroes Advanced Game&quot; in 1986.

==System==

=== Attributes ===
Players resolve most game situations by rolling percentile dice and comparing the results against a column of the colorful &quot;Universal Results Table&quot;. The attribute used determines which column to use; different tasks map to different attributes. 

All characters have seven basic attributes:

Fighting determines hit probability in and defense against hand-to-hand attacks.

Agility determines hit probability in and defense against ranged attacks, feats of agility vs. the environment, and acrobatics.

Strength determines damage inflicted by hand-to-hand attacks, grappling, or lifting and breaking heavy objects.

Endurance determines resistance to physical damage (e.g., poison, disease, death). It also determines how long a character can fight and how fast a character can move at top speed.

Reason determines the success of tasks relating to knowledge, puzzle-solving, and advanced technology.

Intuition determines the success of tasks relating to awareness, perception, and instinct.

Psyche determines the success of tasks relating to willpower, psionics, and magic.

Players sometimes refer to this set of attributes and the game system as a whole by the acronym &quot;FASERIP&quot;. Attribute scores for most characters range from 1 to 100, where normal human ability is Typical (6), and peak (non-superheroic) human ability is Excellent (20). The designers minimize use of the numerical figures, instead preferring adjectives like &quot;Incredible&quot; (36-45) and &quot;Amazing&quot; (46-62). A &quot;Typical&quot; (5-7) attribute has a 50% base chance for success at most tasks relating to that attribute. As an attribute increases, the chance of success increases about 5% per 10 points. Thus a character with an &quot;Amazing&quot; (50) attribute has a 75% chance of success at tasks relating to that attribute.

===Superpowers and origins===
Beyond the seven attributes, characters have superpowers that function on a mostly &quot;ad hoc&quot; basis, and each character&#x27;s description gives considerable space to a description of how their powers work in the game.

Each character has an origin which puts ceilings on a character&#x27;s abilities and superpowers. The origins include:

Altered humans, normal people who acquire powers, such as Spider-Man or the Fantastic Four.

High-tech wonders, normal people whose powers come from devices, such as Iron Man.

Mutants, persons born with superpowers, such as the X-Men.

Robots, created beings, such as the Vision and Ultron.

Aliens, non-humans, including extra-dimensional beings such as Thor and Hercules.

===Talents===
The game also features a simple skill system referred to as Talents. Talents must be learned and cover areas of knowledge from Archery to Zoology. A Talent raises a character&#x27;s ability by one rank when attempting actions related to that Talent. The GM is free to determine if a character would be unable to attempt an action without the appropriate Talent (such as a character with no medical background attempting to make a pill that can cure a rare disease).

== Game mechanics ==
Two primary game mechanics drive the game: column shifts and colored results. Both influence the difficulty of an action.

A column shift is used when a character is trying a hard or easy action. A column shift to the left indicates a penalty, while a shift to the right indicates a bonus.

The column for each ability is divided into four colors: white, green, yellow, and red. A white result is always a failure or unfavorable outcome. In most cases, getting a green result is all that is needed to succeed at a particular action. Yellow and red results usually indicate more favorable results that could knock back, stun, or even kill an opponent. However, the GM can determine that succeeding at a hard task might require a yellow or red result.

Additional rules in the &quot;Campaign Book&quot; of the basic and advanced sets use the same game mechanic to resolve non-violent tasks.
==Publication history==
The first super hero role-playing games appeared in the early 1980s with &quot;Champions&quot; (1981) by Hero Games and &quot;Villains and Vigilantes&quot; (1983) by Fantasy Games Unlimited. Both of these were &quot;generic&quot; systems, not tied to any particular line of comics, and players had to create their own super heroes. TSR scored a coup in 1984 when it acquired the game license from Marvel Comics, allowing it to create a role-playing game and characters based on the popular line of comics. The result was &quot;Marvel Super Heroes&quot;, a boxed set designed by Jeff Grubb and written by Steve Winter. Grubb designed the game to be easily understood, including a bare-bones combat system sufficient to resolve comic book style superhero fights. The game proved popular, and two years later Grubb and Winter created an expanded edition, the &quot;Marvel Superheroes Advanced Game&quot;.

=== TSR game supplements ===

The original &quot;Marvel Super Heroes&quot; game received extensive support from TSR, covering a variety of Marvel Comics characters and settings, including a &quot;Gamer&#x27;s Handbook of the Marvel Universe&quot; patterned after Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe&quot;. &quot;MSH&quot; also got its own column, &quot;The Marvel-phile&quot;, in TSR&#x27;s house magazine &quot;Dragon&quot;; the column usually spotlighted a character or group of characters that hadn&#x27;t yet appeared in a published game product.

===SAGA System===
In the late 1990s, TSR published &quot;Marvel Super Heroes Adventure Game&quot;, a card-based game that used their SAGA System game engine. This version, written by Mike Selinker, included a method of converting characters from the old role-playing game to the SAGA System. Though critically praised in various reviews at the time, it never reached a large market. Shortly afterwards, the Marvel Comics game license reverted to Marvel Comics.

===Other games===
In 2003, Marvel Comics published their own game, &quot;Marvel Universe Roleplaying Game&quot;. This game uses a diceless game mechanic that incorporates a Karma-based resolution system of &quot;stones&quot; (or tokens) to represent character effort. Subsequently Marvel Comics published a few additional supplements, but stopped supporting the game a little over a year after its initial release, despite going through several printings of the core rulebook.

In August 2011, Margaret Weis Productions acquired the licence to publish an RPG based on Marvel superheroes, and &quot;Marvel Heroic Roleplaying&quot; was released beginning in 2012. However, the company found that despite critical acclaim and two Origins Awards, &quot;Marvel Heroic Roleplaying: Civil War&quot; &quot;didn&#x27;t garner the level of sales necessary to sustain the rest of the line.&quot; so they brought the game to a close at the end of April 2013.

==Reception==
In the July–August 1984 edition of &quot;Space Gamer&quot; (No. 70), Allen Varney wrote that the game was only suited to younger players and Marvel fanatics, saying, &quot;this is a respectable effort, and an excellent introductory game for a devoted Marvel fan aged 10 to 12; older, more experienced, or less devoted buyers will probably be disappointed. &#x27;Nuff said.&quot;

Seven years later, Varney revisited the game in the August 1991 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue #172), reviewing the new basic set edition that had just been released. While Varney appreciated that the game was designed for younger players, he felt that it failed to recreate the excitement of the comics. &quot;This is the gravest flaw of this system and support line: its apathy about recreating the spirit of Marvel stories. In this new Basic Set edition... you couldn’t find a miracle if you used microscopic vision. Look at this set’s few elementary mini-scenarios: all fight scenes. The four-color grandeur and narrative magic in the best Marvel stories are absent. Is this a good introduction to role-playing?&quot; Varney instead suggested &quot;Toon&quot; by Steve Jackson Games or &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; by West End Games as better role-playing alternatives for new and beginning young players.

Pete Tamlyn reviewed &quot;Marvel Super Heroes&quot; for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine and stated that &quot;this game has been produced in collaboration with Marvel and that opportunity itself is probably worth a new game release. However, &quot;Marvel Superheroes&quot; is not just another Superhero game. In many ways it is substantially different from other SHrpgs.&quot;

In the January–February 1985 edition of &quot;Different Worlds&quot; (Issue #38), Troy Christensen gave it an average rating of 2.5 stars out of 4, saying, &quot;The &quot;Marvel Super Heroes&quot; roleplaying game overall is a basic and simple system which I would recommend for beginning and novice players [...] People who enjoy a fast and uncomplicated game and like a system which is conservative and to the point will like this game.&quot;

Marcus L. Rowland reviewed &quot;Marvel Super Heroes&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #62, giving it an overall rating of 8 out of 10, and stated that &quot;All in all, a useful system which is suitable for beginning players and referees, but should still suit experienced gamers.&quot;

In his 1990 book &quot;The Complete Guide to Role-Playing Games&quot;, game critic Rick Swan called this &quot;a snap to learn, loaded with action, and nearly captures the anything-goes lunacy that&#x27;s been a hallmark of Marvel Comics since the early 1960s.&quot; Swan did note that familiarity with Marvel heroes was a necessity &quot;and players who&#x27;ve never heard of Captain America or the Fantastic Four (are there any?) won&#x27;t find much to like.&quot; Swan concluded by giving the game superior rating of 3.5 out of 4, saying, &quot;I believe it&#x27;s more difficult to design a simple game than a complicated one, so &quot;Marvel Super Heroes&quot; strikes me as a triumph.&quot; 

&quot;Marvel Super Heroes&quot; was chosen for inclusion in the 2007 book &quot;Hobby Games: The 100 Best&quot;. Writer and game designer Steve Kenson commented that &quot;it&#x27;s a testament to the game&#x27;s longevity that it still has enthusiastic fan support on the Internet and an active play community more than a decade after its last product was published. Even more so that it continues to set a standard by which new superhero roleplaying games are measured. Like modern comic book writers and artists following the greats of the Silver Age, modern RPG designers have a tough act to follow.&quot;

In a retrospective review of &quot;Marvel Super Heroes&quot; in &quot;Black Gate&quot;, Matthew David Surridge said &quot;you couldn&#x27;t help but read comics differently when you were helping create super-hero adventures yourself. Which, so often, seemed superior to what was being published by the major publishers, especially in the early 1990s.&quot; Ty Johnston for &quot;Black Gate&quot; later said &quot;I had the pleasure of playing the game a fair amount in my teen years and even a little later in my twenties, and more recently I lucked into a few online games with friends, and I have to say this game is not only enjoyable, but it&#x27;s something of a bit of fresh air, mainly because of its relative simplicity and its willingness to be fun. It&#x27;s worth checking out.&quot;

In his 2023 book &quot;Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground&quot;, RPG historian Stu Horvath noted, &quot;It&#x27;s interesting to see the gulf of quality between &quot;Marvel Super Heroes&quot; and &quot;Conan Unchained&quot; [published the same year by TSR.] Where &quot;Conan&quot; feels like the work of a good designer trying desperately to salvage a corporate cash grab, &quot;Marvel Super Heroes&quot; is a fun and functional reflection of the source material in roleplaying game form.&quot;

<text>In mathematics, the concept of a measure is a generalization and formalization of geometrical measures (length, area, volume) and other common notions, such as magnitude, mass, and probability of events. These seemingly distinct concepts have many similarities and can often be treated together in a single mathematical context. Measures are foundational in probability theory, integration theory, and can be generalized to assume negative values, as with electrical charge. Far-reaching generalizations (such as spectral measures and projection-valued measures) of measure are widely used in quantum physics and physics in general.

The intuition behind this concept dates back to ancient Greece, when Archimedes tried to calculate the area of a circle. But it was not until the late 19th and early 20th centuries that measure theory became a branch of mathematics. The foundations of modern measure theory were laid in the works of Émile Borel, Henri Lebesgue, Nikolai Luzin, Johann Radon, Constantin Carathéodory, and Maurice Fréchet, among others.

==Definition==
Let formula_1 be a set and formula_2 a σ-algebra over formula_3 A set function formula_4 from formula_2 to the extended real number line is called a measure if the following conditions hold:

*Non-negativity: For all formula_6
*formula_7
*Countable additivity (or σ-additivity): For all countable collections formula_8 of pairwise disjoint sets in Σ,formula_9

If at least one set formula_10 has finite measure, then the requirement formula_11 is met automatically due to countable additivity:
formula_12
and therefore formula_13

If the condition of non-negativity is dropped, and formula_4 takes on at most one of the values of formula_15 then formula_4 is called a &quot;signed measure&quot;.

The pair formula_17 is called a &quot;measurable space&quot;, and the members of formula_2 are called measurable sets.

A triple formula_19 is called a &quot;measure space&quot;. A probability measure is a measure with total measure one – that is, formula_20 A probability space is a measure space with a probability measure.

For measure spaces that are also topological spaces various compatibility conditions can be placed for the measure and the topology. Most measures met in practice in analysis (and in many cases also in probability theory) are Radon measures. Radon measures have an alternative definition in terms of linear functionals on the locally convex topological vector space of continuous functions with compact support. This approach is taken by Bourbaki (2004) and a number of other sources. For more details, see the article on Radon measures.

==Instances==

Some important measures are listed here.

* The counting measure is defined by formula_21 = number of elements in formula_22
* The Lebesgue measure on formula_23 is a complete translation-invariant measure on a &quot;σ&quot;-algebra containing the intervals in formula_23 such that formula_25; and every other measure with these properties extends the Lebesgue measure.
* Circular angle measure is invariant under rotation, and hyperbolic angle measure is invariant under squeeze mapping.
* The Haar measure for a locally compact topological group is a generalization of the Lebesgue measure (and also of counting measure and circular angle measure) and has similar uniqueness properties.
*Every (pseudo) Riemannian manifold formula_26 has a canonical measure formula_27 that in local coordinates formula_28 looks like formula_29 where formula_30 is the usual Lebesgue measure.
* The Hausdorff measure is a generalization of the Lebesgue measure to sets with non-integer dimension, in particular, fractal sets.
* Every probability space gives rise to a measure which takes the value 1 on the whole space (and therefore takes all its values in the unit interval [0, 1]). Such a measure is called a &quot;probability measure&quot; or &quot;distribution&quot;. See the list of probability distributions for instances.
* The Dirac measure &quot;δ&quot;&quot;a&quot; (cf. Dirac delta function) is given by &quot;δ&quot;&quot;a&quot;(&quot;S&quot;) = &quot;χ&quot;&quot;S&quot;(a), where &quot;χ&quot;&quot;S&quot; is the indicator function of formula_22 The measure of a set is 1 if it contains the point formula_32 and 0 otherwise.

Other &#x27;named&#x27; measures used in various theories include: Borel measure, Jordan measure, ergodic measure, Gaussian measure, Baire measure, Radon measure, Young measure, and Loeb measure.
In physics an example of a measure is spatial distribution of mass (see for example, gravity potential), or another non-negative extensive property, conserved (see conservation law for a list of these) or not. Negative values lead to signed measures, see &quot;generalizations&quot; below.

* Liouville measure, known also as the natural volume form on a symplectic manifold, is useful in classical statistical and Hamiltonian mechanics.
* Gibbs measure is widely used in statistical mechanics, often under the name canonical ensemble.

Measure theory is used in machine learning. One example is the Flow Induced Probability Measure in GFlowNet.

==Basic properties==
Let formula_4 be a measure.

===Monotonicity===
If formula_34 and formula_35 are measurable sets with formula_36 then
formula_37

===Measure of countable unions and intersections===
====Countable subadditivity====
For any countable sequence formula_38 of (not necessarily disjoint) measurable sets formula_39 in formula_40
formula_41

====Continuity from below====
If formula_38 are measurable sets that are increasing (meaning that formula_43) then the union of the sets formula_39 is measurable and
formula_45

====Continuity from above====
If formula_38 are measurable sets that are decreasing (meaning that formula_47) then the intersection of the sets formula_39 is measurable; furthermore, if at least one of the formula_39 has finite measure then
formula_50

This property is false without the assumption that at least one of the formula_39 has finite measure. For instance, for each formula_52 let formula_53 which all have infinite Lebesgue measure, but the intersection is empty.

==Other properties==

===Completeness===
A measurable set formula_1 is called a &quot;null set&quot; if formula_55 A subset of a null set is called a &quot;negligible set&quot;. A negligible set need not be measurable, but every measurable negligible set is automatically a null set. A measure is called &quot;complete&quot; if every negligible set is measurable.

A measure can be extended to a complete one by considering the σ-algebra of subsets formula_56 which differ by a negligible set from a measurable set formula_57 that is, such that the symmetric difference of formula_1 and formula_56 is contained in a null set. One defines formula_60 to equal formula_61

===&quot;Dropping the Edge&quot;===
If formula_62 is formula_63-measurable, then
formula_64
for almost all formula_65 This property is used in connection with Lebesgue integral.
===Additivity===
Measures are required to be countably additive. However, the condition can be strengthened as follows.
For any set formula_66 and any set of nonnegative formula_67 define:
formula_68
That is, we define the sum of the formula_69 to be the supremum of all the sums of finitely many of them.

A measure formula_4 on formula_2 is formula_72-additive if for any formula_73 and any family of disjoint sets formula_74 the following hold:
formula_75
formula_76
The second condition is equivalent to the statement that the ideal of null sets is formula_72-complete.

===Sigma-finite measures===
A measure space formula_19 is called finite if formula_79 is a finite real number (rather than formula_80). Nonzero finite measures are analogous to probability measures in the sense that any finite measure formula_4 is proportional to the probability measure formula_82 A measure formula_4 is called &quot;σ-finite&quot; if formula_1 can be decomposed into a countable union of measurable sets of finite measure. Analogously, a set in a measure space is said to have a &quot;σ-finite measure&quot; if it is a countable union of sets with finite measure.

For example, the real numbers with the standard Lebesgue measure are σ-finite but not finite. Consider the closed intervals formula_85 for all integers formula_86 there are countably many such intervals, each has measure 1, and their union is the entire real line. Alternatively, consider the real numbers with the counting measure, which assigns to each finite set of reals the number of points in the set. This measure space is not σ-finite, because every set with finite measure contains only finitely many points, and it would take uncountably many such sets to cover the entire real line. The σ-finite measure spaces have some very convenient properties; σ-finiteness can be compared in this respect to the Lindelöf property of topological spaces. They can be also thought of as a vague generalization of the idea that a measure space may have &#x27;uncountable measure&#x27;.

===Strictly localizable measures===
===Semifinite measures===
Let formula_1 be a set, let formula_88 be a sigma-algebra on formula_57 and let formula_4 be a measure on formula_91 We say formula_4 is semifinite to mean that for all formula_93 formula_94 

Semifinite measures generalize sigma-finite measures, in such a way that some big theorems of measure theory that hold for sigma-finite but not arbitrary measures can be extended with little modification to hold for semifinite measures. (To-do: add examples of such theorems; cf. the talk page.)

====Basic examples====
* Every sigma-finite measure is semifinite.
* Assume formula_95 let formula_96 and assume formula_97 for all formula_98
** We have that formula_4 is sigma-finite if and only if formula_100 for all formula_101 and formula_102 is countable. We have that formula_4 is semifinite if and only if formula_100 for all formula_105
** Taking formula_106 above (so that formula_4 is counting measure on formula_108), we see that counting measure on formula_108 is
*** sigma-finite if and only if formula_1 is countable; and
*** semifinite (without regard to whether formula_1 is countable). (Thus, counting measure, on the power set formula_108 of an arbitrary uncountable set formula_57 gives an example of a semifinite measure that is not sigma-finite.)
* Let formula_114 be a complete, separable metric on formula_57 let formula_116 be the Borel sigma-algebra induced by formula_117 and let formula_118 Then the Hausdorff measure formula_119 is semifinite.
* Let formula_114 be a complete, separable metric on formula_57 let formula_116 be the Borel sigma-algebra induced by formula_117 and let formula_118 Then the packing measure formula_119 is semifinite.

====Involved example====
The zero measure is sigma-finite and thus semifinite. In addition, the zero measure is clearly less than or equal to formula_126 It can be shown there is a greatest measure with these two properties:

We say the semifinite part of formula_4 to mean the semifinite measure formula_128 defined in the above theorem. We give some nice, explicit formulas, which some authors may take as definition, for the semifinite part:
* formula_129
* formula_130
* formula_131

Since formula_128 is semifinite, it follows that if formula_133 then formula_4 is semifinite. It is also evident that if formula_4 is semifinite then formula_136

====Non-examples====
Every &quot;formula_137 measure&quot; that is not the zero measure is not semifinite. (Here, we say &quot;formula_137 measure&quot; to mean a measure whose range lies in formula_139: formula_140) Below we give examples of formula_137 measures that are not zero measures.
* Let formula_1 be nonempty, let formula_88 be a formula_144-algebra on formula_57 let formula_146 be not the zero function, and let formula_147 It can be shown that formula_4 is a measure.
** formula_149
*** formula_150 formula_151 formula_152
* Let formula_1 be uncountable, let formula_88 be a formula_144-algebra on formula_57 let formula_157 be the countable elements of formula_158 and let formula_159 It can be shown that formula_4 is a measure.

====Involved non-example====
We say the formula_161 part of formula_4 to mean the measure formula_163 defined in the above theorem. Here is an explicit formula for formula_163: formula_165

====Results regarding semifinite measures====

* Let formula_166 be formula_23 or formula_168 and let formula_169 Then formula_4 is semifinite if and only if formula_171 is injective. (This result has import in the study of the dual space of formula_172.)
* Let formula_166 be formula_23 or formula_168 and let formula_176 be the topology of convergence in measure on formula_177 Then formula_4 is semifinite if and only if formula_176 is Hausdorff.
* (Johnson) Let formula_1 be a set, let formula_88 be a sigma-algebra on formula_57 let formula_4 be a measure on formula_158 let formula_56 be a set, let formula_116 be a sigma-algebra on formula_187 and let formula_188 be a measure on formula_189 If formula_190 are both not a formula_137 measure, then both formula_4 and formula_188 are semifinite if and only if formula_194formula_195 for all formula_196 and formula_197 (Here, formula_198 is the measure defined in Theorem 39.1 in Berberian &#x27;65.) 

===Localizable measures===
Localizable measures are a special case of semifinite measures and a generalization of sigma-finite measures.

Let formula_1 be a set, let formula_88 be a sigma-algebra on formula_57 and let formula_4 be a measure on formula_91
* Let formula_166 be formula_23 or formula_168 and let formula_207 Then formula_4 is localizable if and only if formula_171 is bijective (if and only if formula_210 &quot;is&quot; formula_211).

===s-finite measures===
A measure is said to be s-finite if it is a countable sum of finite measures. S-finite measures are more general than sigma-finite ones and have applications in the theory of stochastic processes.

==Non-measurable sets==
If the axiom of choice is assumed to be true, it can be proved that not all subsets of Euclidean space are Lebesgue measurable; examples of such sets include the Vitali set, and the non-measurable sets postulated by the Hausdorff paradox and the Banach–Tarski paradox.

==Generalizations==
For certain purposes, it is useful to have a &quot;measure&quot; whose values are not restricted to the non-negative reals or infinity. For instance, a countably additive set function with values in the (signed) real numbers is called a &quot;signed measure&quot;, while such a function with values in the complex numbers is called a &quot;complex measure&quot;. Observe, however, that complex measure is necessarily of finite variation, hence complex measures include finite signed measures but not, for example, the Lebesgue measure.

Measures that take values in Banach spaces have been studied extensively. A measure that takes values in the set of self-adjoint projections on a Hilbert space is called a &quot;projection-valued measure&quot;; these are used in functional analysis for the spectral theorem. When it is necessary to distinguish the usual measures which take non-negative values from generalizations, the term positive measure is used. Positive measures are closed under conical combination but not general linear combination, while signed measures are the linear closure of positive measures.

Another generalization is the &quot;finitely additive measure&quot;, also known as a content. This is the same as a measure except that instead of requiring &quot;countable&quot; additivity we require only &quot;finite&quot; additivity. Historically, this definition was used first. It turns out that in general, finitely additive measures are connected with notions such as Banach limits, the dual of formula_212 and the Stone–Čech compactification. All these are linked in one way or another to the axiom of choice. Contents remain useful in certain technical problems in geometric measure theory; this is the theory of Banach measures.

A &quot;charge&quot; is a generalization in both directions: it is a finitely additive, signed measure. (Cf. ba space for information about &quot;bounded&quot; charges, where we say a charge is &quot;bounded&quot; to mean its range its a bounded subset of &quot;R&quot;.)

<text>A motorcycle (motorbike, bike, or, if three-wheeled, a trike) is a two or three-wheeled motor vehicle steered by a handlebar from a saddle-style seat.

Motorcycle designs vary greatly to suit a range of different purposes: long-distance travel, commuting, cruising, sport (including racing), and off-road riding. Motorcycling is riding a motorcycle and being involved in other related social activities such as joining a motorcycle club and attending motorcycle rallies.

The 1885 Daimler Reitwagen made by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in Germany was the first internal combustion, petroleum-fueled motorcycle. In 1894, Hildebrand &amp; Wolfmüller became the first series production motorcycle.

Globally, motorcycles are comparable numerically to cars as a method of transport: in 2021, approximately 58.6 million new motorcycles were sold around the world, while 66.7 million cars were sold over the same period.

In 2022, the top four motorcycle producers by volume and type were Honda, Yamaha, Kawasaki, and Suzuki.

According to the US Department of Transportation, the number of fatalities per vehicle mile traveled was 37 times higher for motorcycles than for cars.

==Types==

The term motorcycle has different legal definitions depending on jurisdiction (see ).

There are three major types of motorcycle: street, off-road, and dual purpose. Within these types, there are many sub-types of motorcycles for different purposes. There is often a racing counterpart to each type, such as road racing and street bikes, or motocross including dirt bikes.

Street bikes include cruisers, sportbikes, scooters and mopeds, and many other types. Off-road motorcycles include many types designed for dirt-oriented racing classes such as motocross and are not street legal in most areas. Dual purpose machines like the dual-sport style are made to go off-road but include features to make them legal and comfortable on the street as well.

Each configuration offers either specialised advantage or broad capability, and each design creates a different riding posture.

In some countries the use of pillions (rear seats) is restricted.
==History==
===Experimentation and invention===

The first internal combustion, petroleum fueled motorcycle was the Daimler &quot;Reitwagen&quot;. It was designed and built by the German inventors Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in Bad Cannstatt, Germany, in 1885. This vehicle was unlike either the safety bicycles or the boneshaker bicycles of the era in that it had zero degrees of steering axis angle and no fork offset, and thus did not use the principles of bicycle and motorcycle dynamics developed nearly 70 years earlier. Instead, it relied on two outrigger wheels to remain upright while turning.

The inventors called their invention the &quot;Reitwagen&quot; (&quot;riding car&quot;). It was designed as an expedient testbed for their new engine, rather than a true prototype vehicle.
The first commercial design for a self-propelled cycle was a three-wheel design called the Butler Petrol Cycle, conceived of Edward Butler in England in 1884. He exhibited his plans for the vehicle at the Stanley Cycle Show in London in 1884. The vehicle was built by the Merryweather Fire Engine company in Greenwich, in 1888.

The Butler Petrol Cycle was a three-wheeled vehicle, with the rear wheel directly driven by a , displacement, bore × stroke, flat twin four-stroke engine (with magneto ignition replaced by coil and battery) equipped with rotary valves and a float-fed carburettor (five years before Maybach) and Ackermann steering, all of which were state of the art at the time. Starting was by compressed air. The engine was liquid-cooled, with a radiator over the rear driving wheel. Speed was controlled by means of a throttle valve lever. No braking system was fitted; the vehicle was stopped by raising and lowering the rear driving wheel using a foot-operated lever; the weight of the machine was then borne by two small castor wheels. The driver was seated between the front wheels. It was not, however, a success, as Butler failed to find sufficient financial backing.

Many authorities have excluded steam powered, electric motorcycles or diesel-powered two-wheelers from the definition of a &#x27;motorcycle&#x27;, and credit the Daimler &quot;Reitwagen&quot; as the world&#x27;s first motorcycle. Given the rapid rise in use of electric motorcycles worldwide, defining only internal-combustion powered two-wheelers as &#x27;motorcycles&#x27; is increasingly problematic. The first (petroleum fueled) internal-combustion motorcycles, like the German &quot;Reitwagen&quot;, were, however, also the first practical motorcycles.

If a two-wheeled vehicle with steam propulsion is considered a motorcycle, then the first motorcycles built seem to be the French Michaux-Perreaux steam velocipede which patent application was filed in December 1868, constructed around the same time as the American Roper steam velocipede, built by Sylvester H. Roper of Roxbury, Massachusetts,
who had been demonstrating his machine at fairs and circuses in the eastern U.S. since 1867. Roper built about 10 steam cars and cycles from the 1860s until his death in 1896.

====Summary of early inventions====
===First motorcycle companies===

In 1894, Hildebrand &amp; Wolfmüller became the first series production motorcycle, and the first to be called a motorcycle (). Excelsior Motor Company, originally a bicycle manufacturing company based in Coventry, England, began production of their first motorcycle model in 1896.

The first production motorcycle in the US was the Orient-Aster, built by Charles Metz in 1898 at his factory in Waltham, Massachusetts.

In the early period of motorcycle history, many producers of bicycles adapted their designs to accommodate the new internal combustion engine. As the engines became more powerful and designs outgrew the bicycle origins, the number of motorcycle producers increased. Many of the nineteenth-century inventors who worked on early motorcycles often moved on to other inventions. Daimler and Roper, for example, both went on to develop automobiles.
At the end of the 19th century the first major mass-production firms were set up. In 1898, Triumph Motorcycles in England began producing motorbikes, and by 1903 it was producing over 500 bikes. Other British firms were Royal Enfield, Norton, Douglas Motorcycles and Birmingham Small Arms Company who began motorbike production in 1899, 1902, 1907 and 1910, respectively. Indian began production in 1901 and Harley-Davidson was established two years later. By the outbreak of World War I, the largest motorcycle manufacturer in the world was Indian,
producing over 20,000 bikes per year.

===First World War===

During the First World War, motorbike production was greatly ramped up for the war effort to supply effective communications with front line troops. Messengers on horses were replaced with despatch riders on motorcycles carrying messages, performing reconnaissance and acting as a military police. American company Harley-Davidson was devoting over 50% of its factory output toward military contract by the end of the war. The British company Triumph Motorcycles sold more than 30,000 of its Triumph Type H model to allied forces during the war. With the rear wheel driven by a belt, the Model H was fitted with a air-cooled four-stroke single-cylinder engine. It was also the first Triumph without pedals.

The Model H in particular, is regarded by many as having been the first &quot;modern motorcycle&quot;. Introduced in 1915 it had a 550 cc side-valve four-stroke engine with a three-speed gearbox and belt transmission. It was so popular with its users that it was nicknamed the &quot;Trusty Triumph&quot;.

===Postwar===

By 1920, Harley-Davidson was the largest manufacturer, with their motorcycles being sold by dealers in 67 countries.

Amongst many British motorcycle manufacturers, Chater-Lea with its twin-cylinder models followed by its large singles in the 1920s stood out. Initially, using converted a Woodmann-designed OHV Blackburne engine it became the first 350 cc to exceed , recording over the flying kilometre during April 1924.[7] Later, Chater-Lea set a world record for the flying kilometre for 350 cc and 500 cc motorcycles at for the firm. Chater-Lea produced variants of these world-beating sports models and became popular among racers at the Isle of Man TT. Today, the firm is probably best remembered for its long-term contract to manufacture and supply AA Patrol motorcycles and sidecars.

By the late 1920s or early 1930s, DKW in Germany took over as the largest manufacturer.

In the 1950s, streamlining began to play an increasing part in the development of racing motorcycles and the &quot;dustbin fairing&quot; held out the possibility of radical changes to motorcycle design. NSU and Moto Guzzi were in the vanguard of this development, both producing very radical designs well ahead of their time.
NSU produced the most advanced design, but after the deaths of four NSU riders in the 1954–1956 seasons, they abandoned further development and quit Grand Prix motorcycle racing.

Moto Guzzi produced competitive race machines, and until the end of 1957 had a succession of victories. The following year, 1958, full enclosure fairings were banned from racing by the FIM in the light of the safety concerns.

From the 1960s through the 1990s, small two-stroke motorcycles were popular worldwide, partly as a result of East German MZs Walter Kaaden&#x27;s engine work in the 1950s.
===Today===

In the 21st century, the motorcycle industry is mainly dominated by Indian and Japanese motorcycle companies. In addition to the large capacity motorcycles, there is a large market in smaller capacity (less than 300 cc) motorcycles, mostly concentrated in Asian and African countries and produced in China and India. A Japanese example is the 1958 Honda Super Cub, which went on to become the biggest selling vehicle of all time, with its 60 millionth unit produced in April 2008.
Today, this area is dominated by mostly Indian companies with Hero MotoCorp emerging as the world&#x27;s largest manufacturer of two wheelers. Its Splendor model has sold more than 8.5 million to date. Other major producers are Bajaj and TVS Motors.
==Technical aspects==
===Construction===

Motorcycle construction is the engineering, manufacturing, and assembly of components and systems for a motorcycle which results in the performance, cost, and aesthetics desired by the designer. With some exceptions, construction of modern mass-produced motorcycles has standardised on a steel or aluminium frame, telescopic forks holding the front wheel, and disc brakes. Some other body parts, designed for either aesthetic or performance reasons may be added. A petrol-powered engine typically consisting of between one and four cylinders (and less commonly, up to eight cylinders) coupled to a manual five- or six-speed sequential transmission drives the swingarm-mounted rear wheel by a chain, driveshaft, or belt. The repair can be done using a motorcycle lift.

===Fuel economy===
Motorcycle fuel economy varies greatly with engine displacement and riding style. A streamlined, fully faired Matzu Matsuzawa Honda XL125 achieved in the Craig Vetter Fuel Economy Challenge &quot;on real highways in real conditions&quot;.
Due to low engine displacements (), and high power-to-mass ratios, motorcycles offer good fuel economy. Under conditions of fuel scarcity like 1950s Britain and modern developing nations, motorcycles claim large shares of the vehicle market. In the United States, the average motorcycle fuel economy is 44 miles per US gallon (19 km per liter).

====Electric motorcycles====

Very high fuel economy equivalents are often derived by electric motorcycles. Electric motorcycles are nearly silent, zero-emission electric motor-driven vehicles. Operating range and top speed are limited by battery technology. Fuel cells and petroleum-electric hybrids are also under development to extend the range and improve performance of the electric drive system.

===Reliability===
A 2013 survey of 4,424 readers of the US &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; magazine collected reliability data on 4,680 motorcycles purchased new from 2009 to 2012. The most common problem areas were accessories, brakes, electrical (including starters, charging, ignition), and fuel systems, and the types of motorcycles with the greatest problems were touring, off-road/dual sport, sport-touring, and cruisers. There were not enough sport bikes in the survey for a statistically significant conclusion, though the data hinted at reliability as good as cruisers. These results may be partially explained by accessories including such equipment as fairings, luggage, and auxiliary lighting, which are frequently added to touring, adventure touring/dual sport and sport touring bikes. Trouble with fuel systems is often the result of improper winter storage, and brake problems may also be due to poor maintenance. Of the five brands with enough data to draw conclusions, Honda, Kawasaki and Yamaha were statistically tied, with 11 to 14% of those bikes in the survey experiencing major repairs. Harley-Davidsons had a rate of 24%, while BMWs did worse, with 30% of those needing major repairs. There were not enough Triumph and Suzuki motorcycles surveyed for a statistically sound conclusion, though it appeared Suzukis were as reliable as the other three Japanese brands while Triumphs were comparable to Harley-Davidson and BMW. Three-fourths of the repairs in the survey cost less than US$200 and two-thirds of the motorcycles were repaired in less than two days. In spite of their relatively worse reliability in this survey, Harley-Davidson and BMW owners showed the greatest owner satisfaction, and three-fourths of them said they would buy the same bike again, followed by 72% of Honda owners and 60 to 63% of Kawasaki and Yamaha owners.

===Dynamics===

Two-wheeled motorcycles stay upright while rolling due to a physical property known as conservation of angular momentum in the wheels. Angular momentum points along the axle, and it &quot;wants&quot; to stay pointing in that direction.

Different types of motorcycles have different dynamics and these play a role in how a motorcycle performs in given conditions. For example, one with a longer wheelbase provides the feeling of more stability by responding less to disturbances. Motorcycle tyres have a large influence over handling.

Motorcycles must be leaned in order to make turns. This lean is induced by the method known as countersteering, in which the rider momentarily steers the handlebars in the direction opposite of the desired turn. This practice is counterintuitive and therefore often confusing to novices and even many experienced motorcyclists.

With such short wheelbase, motorcycles can generate enough torque at the rear wheel, and enough stopping force at the front wheel, to lift the opposite wheel off the road. These actions, if performed on purpose, are known as wheelies and stoppies (or endos) respectively.

===Accessories===

Various features and accessories may be attached to a motorcycle either as OEM (factory-fitted) or aftermarket. Such accessories are selected by the owner to enhance the motorcycle&#x27;s appearance, safety, performance, or comfort, and may include anything from mobile electronics to sidecars and trailers.

==Records==

* The world record for the longest motorcycle jump was set in 2008 by Robbie Maddison with .
* Since late 2010, the Ack Attack team has held the motorcycle land-speed record at .

==Safety==

Motorcycles have a higher rate of fatal accidents than automobiles or trucks and buses. United States Department of Transportation data for 2005 from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System show that for passenger cars, 18.62 fatal crashes occur per 100,000 registered vehicles. For motorcycles this figure is higher at 75.19 per 100,000 registered vehicles four times higher than for cars.
The same data shows that 1.56 fatalities occur per 100 million vehicle miles travelled for passenger cars, whereas for motorcycles the figure is 43.47 which is 28 times higher than for cars (37 times more deaths per mile travelled in 2007).
Furthermore, for motorcycles the accident rates have increased significantly since the end of the 1990s, while the rates have dropped for passenger cars.

The most common configuration of motorcycle accidents in the United States is when a motorist pulls out or turns in front of a motorcyclist, violating their right-of-way. This is sometimes called a , an acronym formed from the motorists&#x27; common response of &quot;Sorry mate, I didn&#x27;t see you&quot;.
Motorcyclists can anticipate and avoid some of these crashes with proper training, increasing their visibility to other traffic, keeping to the speed limits, and not consuming alcohol or other drugs before riding.

The United Kingdom has several organisations dedicated to improving motorcycle safety by providing advanced rider training beyond what is necessary to pass the basic motorcycle licence test. These include the Institute of Advanced Motorists (IAM) and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA). Along with increased personal safety, riders with these advanced qualifications may benefit from reduced insurance costs

In South Africa, the Think Bike campaign is dedicated to increasing both motorcycle safety and the awareness of motorcycles on the country&#x27;s roads. The campaign, while strongest in the Gauteng province, has representation in Western Cape, KwaZulu Natal and the Free State. It has dozens of trained marshals available for various events such as cycle races and is deeply involved in numerous other projects such as the annual Motorcycle Toy Run.

Motorcycle safety education is offered throughout the United States by organisations ranging from state agencies to non-profit organisations to corporations. Most states use the courses designed by the Motorcycle Safety Foundation (MSF), while Oregon and Idaho developed their own. All of the training programs include a Basic Rider Course, an Intermediate Rider Course and an Advanced Rider Course.
In Ireland, since 2010, in the UK and some Australian jurisdictions, such as Victoria, New South Wales,
the Australian Capital Territory, Tasmania
and the Northern Territory, it is compulsory to complete a basic rider training course before being issued a Learners Licence, after which they can ride on public roads.

In Canada, motorcycle rider training is compulsory in Quebec and Manitoba only, but all provinces and territories have graduated licence programs which place restrictions on new drivers until they have gained experience. Eligibility for a full motorcycle licence or endorsement for completing a Motorcycle Safety course varies by province. Without the Motorcycle Safety Course the chance of getting insurance for the motorcycle is very low. The Canada Safety Council, a non-profit safety organisation, offers the Gearing Up program across Canada and is endorsed by the Motorcycle and Moped Industry Council. Training course graduates may qualify for reduced insurance premiums.

Motorcyclists and motor scooter riders are also exposed to an increased risk of suffering hearing damage such as hearing loss and tinnitus (ringing ears). The noise is caused by wind noise while riding, rolling noise from the tyres and the engine itself. The helmet only provides insufficient protection against high sound pressure levels. Medicine (as of 2024) is not able to cure hearing damage. Wearing hearing protection, such as special earplugs for motorcyclists, can help prevent hearing damage.

==Motorcycle rider postures==
The motorcyclist&#x27;s riding position depends on rider body-geometry (anthropometry) combined with the geometry of the motorcycle itself. These factors create a set of three basic postures.

*Sport the rider leans forward into the wind and the weight of the upper torso is supported by the rider&#x27;s core at low speed and air pressure at high speed. The footpegs are below the rider or to the rear. The reduced frontal area cuts wind resistance and allows higher speeds. At low-speed in this position the rider&#x27;s arms may bear some of the weight of the rider&#x27;s torso, which can be problematic.
*Standard the rider sits upright or leans forward slightly. The feet are below the rider. These are motorcycles that are not specialised to one task, so they do not excel in any particular area. The standard posture is used with touring and commuting as well as dirt and dual-sport bikes, and may offer advantages for beginners.
*Cruiser the rider sits at a lower seat height with the upper torso upright or leaning slightly rearward. Legs are extended forwards, sometimes out of reach of the regular controls on cruiser pegs. The low seat height can be a consideration for new or short riders. Handlebars tend to be high and wide. The emphasis is on comfort while compromising cornering ability because of low ground clearance and the greater likelihood of scraping foot pegs, floor boards, or other parts if turns are taken at the speeds other motorcycles can more readily accomplish.

Factors of a motorcycle&#x27;s ergonomic geometry that determine the seating posture include the height, angle and location of footpegs, seat and handlebars. Factors in a rider&#x27;s physical geometry that contribute to seating posture include torso, arm, thigh and leg length, and overall rider height.

==Legal definitions and restrictions==

A motorcycle is broadly defined by law in most countries for the purposes of registration, taxation and rider licensing as a powered two-wheel motor vehicle. Most countries distinguish between mopeds of 49 cc and the more powerful, larger vehicles, including scooter type motorcycles. Many jurisdictions include some forms of three-wheeled cars as motorcycles.

In Nigeria, motorcycles, popularly referred to as &quot;Okada&quot; have been subject of many controversies with regards to safety and security followed by restriction of movement in many states. In 2020, it was banned in Lagos, Nigeria&#x27;s most populous city.

==Environmental impact==
Motorcycles and scooters&#x27; low fuel consumption has attracted interest in the United States from environmentalists and those affected by increased fuel prices.
Piaggio Group Americas supported this interest with the launch of a &quot;Vespanomics&quot; website and platform, claiming lower per-mile carbon emissions of 0.4 lb/mile (113 g/km) less than the average car, a 65% reduction, and better fuel economy.

However, a motorcycle&#x27;s exhaust emissions may contain 10–20 times more oxides of nitrogen (NOx), carbon monoxide, and unburned hydrocarbons than exhaust from a similar-year passenger car or SUV.
This is because many motorcycles lack a catalytic converter, and the emission standard is much more permissive for motorcycles than for other vehicles. While catalytic converters have been installed in most gasoline-powered cars and trucks since 1975 in the United States, they can present fitment and heat difficulties in motorcycle applications. 

United States Environmental Protection Agency 2007 certification result reports for all vehicles versus on highway motorcycles (which also includes scooters), the average certified emissions level for 12,327 vehicles tested was 0.734. The average &quot;Nox+Co End-Of-Useful-Life-Emissions&quot; for 3,863 motorcycles tested was 0.8531. 54% of the tested 2007-model motorcycles were equipped with a catalytic converter.

===United States emissions limits===
The following table shows maximum acceptable legal emissions of the combination of hydrocarbons, oxides of nitrogen, and carbon monoxide for new motorcycles sold in the United States with 280 cc or greater piston displacement.

The maximum acceptable legal emissions of hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide for new Class I and II motorcycles (50 cc–169 cc and 170 cc–279 cc respectively) sold in the United States are as follows:
===Europe===
European emission standards for motorcycles are similar to those for cars. New motorcycles must meet Euro 5 standards, while cars must meet Euro 6D-temp standards. Motorcycle emission controls are being updated and it has been proposed to update to Euro 5+ in 2024.

=== Vietnam ===
According to the National Environmental Status Report 2016 and recent air quality reports, emissions from motor vehicles have been identified as the main cause of environmental pollution. Among them, with over 68 million vehicles in operation nationwide (statistics from the Ministry of Transport, 2021), motorcycles are the largest source of pollutant emissions.

In Hanoi, there are over 6 million motorcycles, of which nearly 3 million were manufactured before 2000. In Ho Chi Minh City, there are about 7.8 million motorcycles, of which 67.89% are over 10 years old. Air quality index (AQI) in urban centers often spikes during peak traffic times, such as rush hour in the morning and evening.

A study by the Institute of Environment and Resources, Vietnam National University, Ho Chi Minh City, found that motorcycles account for about 29% of NO emissions, 90% of CO emissions, 65.4% of NMVOC emissions, 37.7% of particulate matter emissions, and 31% of fine particulate matter emissions.

Traffic emissions account for 50% of total emissions in Ho Chi Minh City. While the world is moving towards Euro 6 emission standards, most cars in Vietnam meet Euro 4 or Euro 5 standards. However, motorcycles still meet Euro 2 or Euro 3 standards, which were implemented over 25 years ago.

<text>A map is a symbolic depiction of interrelationships, commonly spatial, between things within a space. A map may be annotated with text and graphics. Like any graphic, a map may be fixed to paper or other durable media, or may be displayed on a transitory medium such as a computer screen. Some maps change interactively. Although maps are commonly used to depict geographic elements, they may represent any space, real or fictional. The subject being mapped may be two-dimensional such as Earth&#x27;s surface, three-dimensional such as Earth&#x27;s interior, or from an abstract space of any dimension.

Maps of geographic territory have a very long tradition and have existed from ancient times. The word &quot;map&quot; comes from the , wherein &quot;mappa&quot; meant &#x27;napkin&#x27; or &#x27;cloth&#x27; and &quot;mundi&quot; &#x27;of the world&#x27;. Thus, &quot;map&quot; became a shortened term referring to a flat representation of Earth&#x27;s surface.

== History ==


Maps have been one of the most important human inventions for millennia, allowing humans to explain and navigate their way through the world. The earliest surviving maps include cave paintings and etchings on tusk and stone. Later came extensive maps produced in ancient Babylon, Greece and Rome, China, and India. In their simplest forms, maps are two-dimensional constructs. Since the Classical Greek period, however, maps also have been projected onto globes. The Mercator Projection, developed by Flemish geographer Gerardus Mercator, was widely used as the standard for two-dimensional world maps until the late 20th century, when more accurate projections were more widely used. Mercator also was the first to use and popularize the concept of the atlas: a collection of maps.

==Geography==

Cartography or &quot;map-making&quot; is the study and practice of crafting representations of the Earth upon a flat surface (see History of cartography), and one who makes maps is called a cartographer.

Road maps are perhaps the most widely used maps today. They are a subset of navigational maps, which also include aeronautical and nautical charts, railroad network maps, and hiking and bicycling maps. In terms of quantity, the largest number of drawn map sheets is probably made up by local surveys, carried out by municipalities, utilities, tax assessors, emergency services providers, and other local agencies. Many national surveying projects have been carried out by the military, such as the British Ordnance Survey: a civilian government agency, internationally renowned for its comprehensively detailed work.

The location information showed by maps may include contour lines, indicating constant values of elevation, temperature, rainfall, etc.

==Orientation==

The orientation of a map is the relationship between the directions on the map and the corresponding compass directions in reality. The word &quot;orient&quot; is derived from Latin , meaning east. In the Middle Ages many maps, including the T and O maps, were drawn with east at the top (meaning that the direction &quot;up&quot; on the map corresponds to East on the compass). The most common cartographic convention nowadays is that north is at the top of a map.

Maps not oriented with north at the top:
* Medieval European T and O maps such as the Hereford Mappa Mundi were centered on Jerusalem with East at the top. Indeed, before the reintroduction of Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot; to Europe around 1400, there was no single convention in the West. Portolan charts, for example, are oriented to the shores they describe.
* Maps of cities bordering a sea are often conventionally oriented with the sea at the top.
* Route and channel maps have traditionally been oriented to the road or waterway they describe.
* Polar maps of the Arctic or Antarctic regions are conventionally centered on the pole; the direction North would be toward or away from the center of the map, respectively. Typical maps of the Arctic have 0° meridian toward the bottom of the page; maps of the Antarctic have the 0° meridian toward the top of the page.
* South-up maps invert the &quot;North is up&quot; convention by having south at the top. Ancient Africans including in Ancient Egypt used this orientation, as some maps in Brazil do today.
* Buckminster Fuller&#x27;s Dymaxion maps are based on a projection of the Earth&#x27;s sphere onto an icosahedron. The resulting triangular pieces may be arranged in any order or orientation.
* Using the equator as the edge, the world map of Gott, Vanderbei, and Goldberg is arranged as a pair of disks back-to-back designed to present the least error possible. They are designed to be printed as a two-sided flat object that could be held easily for educational purposes.

==Scale and accuracy==

Many maps are drawn to a scale expressed as a ratio, such as 1:10,000, which means that 1 unit of measurement on the map corresponds to 10,000 of that same unit on the ground. The scale statement can be accurate when the region mapped is small enough for the curvature of the Earth to be neglected, such as a city map. Mapping larger regions, where the curvature cannot be ignored, requires projections to map from the curved surface of the Earth to the plane. The impossibility of flattening the sphere to the plane without distortion means that the map cannot have a constant scale. Rather, on most projections, the best that can be attained is an accurate scale along one or two paths on the projection. Because scale differs everywhere, it can only be measured meaningfully as point scale per location. Most maps strive to keep point scale variation within narrow bounds. Although the scale statement is nominal it is usually accurate enough for most purposes unless the map covers a large fraction of the Earth. At the scope of a world map, scale as a single number is practically meaningless throughout most of the map. Instead, it usually refers to the scale along the equator.
Some maps, called cartograms, have the scale deliberately distorted to reflect information other than land area or distance. For example, this map (at the left) of Europe has been distorted to show population distribution, while the rough shape of the continent is still discernible.

Another example of distorted scale is the famous London Underground map. The geographic structure is respected but the tube lines (and the River Thames) are smoothed to clarify the relationships between stations. Near the center of the map, stations are spaced out more than near the edges of the map.

Further inaccuracies may be deliberate. For example, cartographers may simply omit military installations or remove features solely to enhance the clarity of the map. For example, a road map may not show railroads, smaller waterways, or other prominent non-road objects, and even if it does, it may show them less clearly (e.g. dashed or dotted lines/outlines) than the main roads. Known as decluttering, the practice makes the subject matter that the user is interested in easier to read, usually without sacrificing overall accuracy. Software-based maps often allow the user to toggle decluttering between ON, OFF, and AUTO as needed. In AUTO the degree of decluttering is adjusted as the user changes the scale being displayed.

==Projection==

Geographic maps use a projection to translate the three-dimensional real surface of the geoid to a two-dimensional picture. Projection always distorts the surface. There are many ways to apportion the distortion, and so there are many map projections. Which projection to use depends on the purpose of the map.

==Symbols==

The various features shown on a map are represented by conventional signs or symbols. For example, colors can be used to indicate a classification of roads. Those signs are usually explained in a map legend on the margin of the map, or on a separately published characteristic sheet.

Some cartographers prefer to make the map cover practically the entire screen or sheet of paper, leaving no room &quot;outside&quot; the map for information about the map as a whole. These cartographers typically place such information in an otherwise &quot;blank&quot; region &quot;inside&quot; the mapcartouche, map legend, title, compass rose, bar scale, etc.
In particular, some maps contain smaller maps inset into otherwise blank areas of the map: for example:
* a map at a much smaller scale showing the whole globe and the position of the main map on that globe, or
* showing &quot;regions of interest&quot; (such as cities) at a larger scale to show details that would not otherwise fit, or
* showing places that do not fit on the main map, such as Alaska and Hawaii on maps of the United States, or the Shetland and Orkney Islands on maps of Britain.

== Design ==

The design and production of maps is a craft that has developed over thousands of years, from clay tablets to Geographic information systems. As a form of Design, particularly closely related to Graphic design, map making incorporates scientific knowledge about how maps are used, integrated with principles of artistic expression, to create an aesthetically attractive product, carries an aura of authority, and functionally serves a particular purpose for an intended audience.

Designing a map involves bringing together a number of elements and making a large number of decisions. The elements of design fall into several broad topics, each of which has its own theory, its own research agenda, and its own best practices. That said, there are synergistic effects between these elements, meaning that the overall design process is not just working on each element one at a time, but an iterative feedback process of adjusting each to achieve the desired gestalt.

* Map projections: The foundation of the map is the plane on which it rests (whether paper or screen), but projections are required to flatten the surface of the Earth. All projections distort this surface, but the cartographer can be strategic about how and where distortion occurs.
* Generalization: All maps must be drawn at a smaller scale than reality, requiring that the information included on a map be a very small sample of the wealth of information about a place. Generalization is the process of adjusting the level of detail in geographic information to be appropriate for the scale and purpose of a map, through procedures such as selection, simplification, and classification.
* Symbology: Any map visually represents the location and properties of geographic features using map symbols, graphical depictions composed of several visual variables, such as size, shape, color, and pattern. 
* Composition: As all of the symbols are brought together, their interactions have major effects on map reading, such as grouping and Visual hierarchy. 
* Typography or Labeling: Text serves a number of purposes on the map, especially aiding the recognition of features, but labels must be designed and positioned well to be effective.
* Layout: The map image must be placed on the page (whether paper, web, or other media), along with related elements, such as the title, legend, additional maps, text, images, and so on. Each of these elements has its own design considerations, as does their integration, which largely follows the principles of Graphic design.
* Map type-specific design: Different kinds of maps, especially thematic maps, have their own design needs and best practices.

==Types==


Maps of the world or large areas are often either &quot;political&quot; or &quot;physical&quot;. The most important purpose of the &quot;political map&quot; is to show territorial borders and administrative regions; the purpose of the &quot;physical map&quot; is to show features of geography such as mountains, soil type, or land use including infrastructures such as roads, railroads, and buildings. 
Topographic maps show elevations and relief with contour lines or shading. 
Geological maps show not only the physical surface, but characteristics of the underlying rock, fault lines, and subsurface structures.

===Electronic===
From the last quarter of the 20th century, the indispensable tool of the cartographer has been the computer. Much of cartography, especially at the data-gathering survey level, has been subsumed by geographic information systems (GIS). The functionality of maps has been greatly advanced by technology simplifying the superimposition of spatially located variables onto existing geographic maps. Having local information such as rainfall level, distribution of wildlife, or demographic data integrated within the map allows more efficient analysis and better decision making. In the pre-electronic age such superimposition of data led Dr. John Snow to identify the location of an outbreak of cholera. Today, it is used by agencies around the world, as diverse as wildlife conservationists and militaries.

Even when GIS is not involved, most cartographers now use a variety of computer graphics programs to generate new maps.

Interactive, computerized maps are commercially available, allowing users to &quot;zoom in&quot; or &quot;zoom out&quot; (respectively meaning to increase or decrease the scale), sometimes by replacing one map with another of different scale, centered where possible on the same point. In-car global navigation satellite systems are computerized maps with route planning and advice facilities that monitor the user&#x27;s position with the help of satellites. From the computer scientist&#x27;s point of view, zooming in entails one or more of:

# replacing the map by a more detailed one
# enlarging the same map without enlarging the pixels, hence showing more detail by removing less information compared to the less detailed version
# enlarging the same map with the pixels enlarged (replaced by rectangles of pixels); no additional detail is shown, but, depending on the user&#x27;s vision, possibly more detail can be seen. If a computer display does not show adjacent pixels really separately, but overlapping instead (this does not apply for an LCD, but may apply for a cathode-ray tube), then replacing a pixel by a rectangle of pixels does show more detail. A variation of this method is interpolation.

For example:
* Typically (2) applies to a Portable Document Format (PDF) file or other format based on vector graphics. The increase in detail is limited to the information contained in the file: enlargement of a curve may eventually result in a series of standard geometric figures such as straight lines, arcs of circles, or splines.
* (2) may apply to text and (3) to the outline of a map feature such as a forest or building.
* (1) may apply to the text as needed (displaying labels for more features), while (2) applies to the rest of the image. Text is not necessarily enlarged when zooming in. Similarly, a road represented by a double line may or may not become wider when one zooms in.
* The map may also have layers that are partly raster graphics and partly vector graphics. For a single raster graphics image (2) applies until the pixels in the image file correspond to the pixels of the display, thereafter (3) applies.

===Climatic===

The maps that reflect the territorial distribution of climatic conditions based on the results of long-term observations are called &quot;climatic maps&quot;. These maps can be compiled both for individual climatic features (temperature, precipitation, humidity) and for combinations of them at the earth&#x27;s surface and in the upper layers of the atmosphere. Climatic maps show climatic features across a large region and permit values of climatic features to be compared in different parts of the region. When generating the map, spatial interpolation can be used to synthesize values where there are no measurements, under the assumption that conditions change smoothly.

Climatic maps generally apply to individual months and the year as a whole, sometimes to the four seasons, to the growing period, and so forth. On maps compiled from the observations of ground meteorological stations, atmospheric pressure is converted to sea level. Air temperature maps are compiled both from the actual values observed on the surface of the Earth and from values converted to sea level. The pressure field in the free atmosphere is represented either by maps of the distribution of pressure at different standard altitudes—for example, at every kilometer above sea level—or by maps of baric topography on which altitudes (more precisely geopotentials) of the main isobaric surfaces (for example, 900, 800, and 700 millibars) counted off from sea level are plotted. The temperature, humidity, and wind on aero climatic maps may apply either to standard altitudes or to the main isobaric surfaces.

Isolines are drawn on maps of such climatic features as the long-term mean values (of atmospheric pressure, temperature, humidity, total precipitation, and so forth) to connect points with equal values of the feature in question—for example, isobars for pressure, isotherms for temperature, and isohyets for precipitation. Isoamplitudes are drawn on maps of amplitudes (for example, annual amplitudes of air temperature—that is, the differences between the mean temperatures of the warmest and coldest month). Isanomals are drawn on maps of anomalies (for example, deviations of the mean temperature of each place from the mean temperature of the entire latitudinal zone). Isolines of frequency are drawn on maps showing the frequency of a particular phenomenon (for example, the annual number of days with a thunderstorm or snow cover). Isochrones are drawn on maps showing the dates of onset of a given phenomenon (for example, the first frost and appearance or disappearance of the snow cover) or the date of a particular value of a meteorological element in the course of a year (for example, passing of the mean daily air temperature through zero). Isolines of the mean numerical value of wind velocity or isotachs are drawn on wind maps (charts); the wind resultants and directions of prevailing winds are indicated by arrows of different lengths or arrows with different plumes; lines of flow are often drawn. Maps of the zonal and meridional components of wind are frequently compiled for the free atmosphere. Atmospheric pressure and wind are usually combined on climatic maps. Wind roses, curves showing the distribution of other meteorological elements, diagrams of the annual course of elements at individual stations, and the like are also plotted on climatic maps.

Maps of climatic regionalization, that is, division of the earth&#x27;s surface into climatic zones and regions according to some classification of climates, are a special kind of climatic map.

Climatic maps are often incorporated into climatic atlases of varying geographic ranges (globe, hemispheres, continents, countries, oceans) or included in comprehensive atlases. Besides general climatic maps, applied climatic maps and atlases have great practical value. Aero climatic maps, aero climatic atlases, and agro climatic maps are the most numerous.

===Extraterrestrial===
Maps exist of the Solar System, and other cosmological features such as star maps. In addition maps of other bodies such as the Moon and other planets are technically not &quot;geo&quot;graphical maps.
Floor maps are also spatial but not necessarily geospatial.

===Topological===
Diagrams such as schematic diagrams and Gantt charts and tree maps display logical relationships between items, rather than geographic relationships. Topological in nature, only the connectivity is significant. The London Underground map and similar subway maps around the world are a common example of these maps.

===General===
General-purpose maps provide many types of information on one map. Most atlas maps, wall maps, and road maps fall into this category. The following are some features that might be shown on general-purpose maps: bodies of water, roads, railway lines, parks, elevations, towns and cities, political boundaries, latitude and longitude, national and provincial parks. These maps give a broad understanding of the location and features of an area. The reader may gain an understanding of the type of landscape, the location of urban places, and the location of major transportation routes all at once.

===Extremely large maps===
====The Great Polish Map of Scotland====

Polish general Stanisław Maczek had once been shown an impressive outdoor map of land and water in the Netherlands demonstrating the working of the waterways (which had been an obstacle to the Polish forces progress in 1944). This had inspired Maczek and his companions to create Great Polish Map of Scotland as a 70-ton permanent three-dimensional reminder of Scotland&#x27;s hospitality to his compatriots. In 1974, the coastline and relief of Scotland were laid out by Kazimierz Trafas, a Polish student geographer-planner, based on existing Bartholomew Half-Inch map sheets. Engineering infrastructure was put in place to surround it with a sea of water and at the General&#x27;s request some of the main rivers were even arranged to flow from headwaters pumped into the mountains. The map was finished in 1979, but had to be restored between 2013 and 2017.

====Challenger Relief Map of British Columbia====
The Challenger Relief Map of British Columbia is a hand-built topographic map of the province, 80 feet by 76 feet. Built by George Challenger and his family from 1947 to 1954, it features all of B.C.&#x27;s mountains, lakes, rivers and valleys in exact-scaled topographical detail. Residing in the British Columbia Pavilion at the Pacific National Exhibition (PNE) in Vancouver from 1954 to 1997 it was viewed by millions of visitors. The Guinness Book of Records cites the Challenger Map as the largest of its kind in the world. The map in its entirety occupies 6,080 square feet (1,850 square metres) of space. It was disassembled in 1997; there is a project to restore it in a new location.

====Relief map of Guatemala====

The Relief map of Guatemala was made by Francisco Vela in 1905 and still exists. This map (horizontal scale 1:10,000; vertical scale 1:2,000) measures 1,800 m2, and was created to educate children in the scape of their country.

==Legal regulation==
Some countries required that all published maps represent their national claims regarding border disputes. For example:
* Within Russia, Google Maps shows Crimea as part of Russia.
* Both the Republic of India and the People&#x27;s Republic of China require that all maps show areas subject to the Sino-Indian border dispute in their own favor.
* In 2010, the People&#x27;s Republic of China began requiring that all online maps served from within China be hosted there, making them subject to Chinese laws.
* In 2017, Turkey banned the terms &quot;Kurdistan&quot; and &quot;Kurdish regions&quot;. In 2018, the government had a user-generated map of Kurdistan, which it deemed &quot;terrorist propaganda&quot;, removed from Google Maps.
* In Pakistan, the Surveying and Mapping (Amendment) Act, 2020 made printing, displaying, or using any unofficial or &quot;incorrect&quot; map of Pakistan a crime punishable by 5 years in jail and a fine of 5 million rupees. It asserts that India is illegally occupying some Pakistani territory along the northern India–Pakistan border.

Larger organizations generally have three hierarchical levels of managers, organized in a pyramid structure:

* Senior management roles include the board of directors and a chief executive officer (CEO) or a president of an organization. They set the strategic goals and policy of the organization and make decisions on how the overall organization will operate. Senior managers are generally executive-level professionals who provide direction to middle management. Compare governance.
* Middle management roles include branch managers, regional managers, department managers, and section managers. They provide direction to front-line managers and communicate the strategic goals and policies of senior management to them.
* Line management roles include supervisors and the front-line team leaders, who oversee the work of regular employees, or volunteers in some voluntary organizations, and provide direction on their work. Line managers often perform the managerial functions that are traditionally considered the core of management. Despite the name, they are usually considered part of the workforce and not part of the organization&#x27;s management class.
Management is taught - both as a theoretical subject as well as its a practical application - across different disciplines at colleges and universities. Prominent major degree-programs in management include Management, Business Administration and Public Administration. Social scientists study management as an academic discipline, investigating areas such as social organization, organizational adaptation, and organizational leadership. In recent decades, there has been a movement for evidence-based management.

== Etymology ==
The English verb &quot;manage&quot; has its roots in the fifteenth-century French verb , which often referred in equestrian language &quot;to hold in hand the reins of a horse&quot;. Also the Italian term (to handle, especially tools or a horse) is possible. In Spanish, can also mean to rule the horses. These three terms derive from the two Latin words (hand) and (to act). 

The French word for housekeeping, , derived from (&quot;to keep house&quot;; compare for &quot;household&quot;), also encompasses taking care of domestic animals. is the French translation of Xenophon&#x27;s famous book &quot;Oeconomicus&quot; () on household matters and husbandry. The French word (or ) influenced the semantic development of the English word &quot;management&quot; in the 17th and 18th centuries.

== Definitions ==

Views on the definition and scope of management include:
* Henri Fayol (1841–1925) stated: &quot;To manage is to forecast and to plan, to organize, to command, to co-ordinate and to control&quot;.
* Fredmund Malik (1944– ) defines management as &quot;the transformation of resources into utility&quot;.
* Management is included as one of the factors of production – along with machines, materials and money.
* Ghislain Deslandes defines management as &quot;a vulnerable force, under pressure to achieve results and endowed with the triple power of constraint, imitation, and imagination, operating on subjective, interpersonal, institutional and environmental levels&quot;.
* Peter Drucker (1909–2005) saw the basic task of management as twofold: marketing and innovation. Nevertheless, innovation is also linked to marketing (product innovation is a central strategic marketing issue). Drucker identifies marketing as a key essence for business success, but management and marketing are generally understood as two different branches of business administration knowledge. 

===Theoretical scope===
Management involves identifying the mission, objective, procedures, rules and manipulation of the human capital of an enterprise to contribute to the success of the enterprise. Scholars have focused on the management of individual, organizational, and inter-organizational relationships. This implies effective communication: an enterprise environment (as opposed to a physical or mechanical mechanism) implies human motivation and implies some sort of successful progress or system outcome. As such, management is not the manipulation of a mechanism (machine or automated program), not the herding of animals, and can occur either in a legal or in an illegal enterprise or environment. From an individual&#x27;s perspective, management does not need to be seen solely from an enterprise point of view, because management is an essential function in improving one&#x27;s life and relationships. Management is therefore everywhere and it has a wider range of application. Communication and a positive endeavor are two main aspects of it either through enterprise or through independent pursuit. Plans, measurements, motivational psychological tools, goals, and economic measures (profit, etc.) may or may not be necessary components for there to be management. At first, one views management functionally, such as measuring quantity, adjusting plans, and meeting goals, but this applies even in situations where planning does not take place. From this perspective, Henri Fayol (1841–1925) considers management to consist of five functions:

* planning (forecasting)
* organizing
* commanding
* coordinating
* controlling

In another way of thinking, Mary Parker Follett (1868–1933), allegedly defined management as &quot;the art of getting things done through people&quot;. She described management as a philosophy.

Critics, however, find this definition useful but far too narrow. The phrase &quot;management is what managers do&quot; occurs widely, suggesting the difficulty of defining management without circularity, the shifting nature of definitions and the connection of managerial practices with the existence of a managerial cadre or of a class.

One habit of thought regards management as equivalent to &quot;business administration&quot; and thus excludes management in places outside commerce, for example in charities and in the public sector. More broadly, every organization must &quot;manage&quot; its work, people, processes, technology, etc. to maximize effectiveness. Nonetheless, many people refer to university departments that teach management as &quot;business schools&quot;. Some such institutions (such as the Harvard Business School) use that name, while others (such as the Yale School of Management) employ the broader term &quot;management&quot;.

English speakers may also use the term &quot;management&quot; or &quot;the management&quot; as a collective word describing the managers of an organization, for example of a corporation.
Historically this use of the term often contrasted with the term &quot;labor&quot; – referring to those being managed.

== Levels ==

A common management structure of organizations includes three management levels: low-level, middle-level, and top-level managers. Low-level managers manage the work of non-managerial individuals who are directly involved with the production or creation of the organization&#x27;s products. Low-level managers are often called supervisors, but may also be called line managers, office managers, or even foremen. Middle managers include all levels of management between the low level and the top level of the organization. These managers manage the work of low-level managers and may have titles such as department head, project leader, plant manager, or division manager. Top managers are responsible for making organization-wide decisions and establishing the plans and goals that affect the entire organization. These individuals typically have titles such as executive vice president, president, managing director, chief operating officer, chief executive officer, or board chairman.

These managers are classified in a hierarchy of authority and perform different tasks. In many organizations, the number of managers at every level resembles a pyramid. Each level is explained below in specifications of their different responsibilities and likely job titles.

===Top management===
The top or senior layer of management is a small group which consists of the board of directors (including non-executive directors, executive directors and independent directors), president, vice-president, CEOs and other members of the C-level executives. Different organizations have various members in their C-suite, which may include a chief financial officer, chief technology officer, and so on. They are responsible for controlling and overseeing the operations of the entire organization. They set a &quot;tone at the top&quot; and develop strategic plans, company policies, and make decisions on the overall direction of the organization. In addition, top-level managers play a significant role in the mobilization of outside resources. Senior managers are accountable to the shareholders, the general public, and public bodies that oversee corporations and similar organizations. Some members of the senior management may serve as the public face of the organization, and they may make speeches to introduce new strategies or appear in marketing.

The board of directors is typically primarily composed of non-executives who owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders and are not closely involved in the day-to-day activities of the organization. However, this varies depending on the type (e.g., public versus private), size, and culture of the organization. These directors are theoretically liable for breaches of that duty and are typically insured under directors and officers liability insurance. Fortune 500 directors are estimated to spend 4.4 hours per week on board duties, and median compensation was $212,512 in 2010. The board sets corporate strategy, makes major decisions such as major acquisitions, and hires, evaluates, and fires the top-level manager (chief executive officer or CEO). The CEO typically hires other positions. However, board involvement in the hiring of other positions such as the chief financial officer (CFO) has increased. In 2013, a survey of over 160 CEOs and directors of public and private companies found that the top weaknesses of CEOs were &quot;mentoring skills&quot; and &quot;board engagement&quot;, and 10% of companies never evaluated the CEO. The board may also have certain employees (e.g., internal auditors) report to them or directly hire independent contractors; for example, the board (through the audit committee) typically selects the auditor.

Helpful skills for top management vary by the type of organization but typically include a broad understanding of competition, world economies, and politics. In addition, the CEO is responsible for implementing and determining (within the board&#x27;s framework) the broad policies of the organization. Executive management accomplishes the day-to-day details, including instructions for the preparation of department budgets, procedures, and schedules; appointment of middle-level executives such as department managers; coordination of departments; media and governmental relations; and shareholder communication.

===Middle management===
Consist of general managers, branch managers and department managers. They are accountable to the top management for their department&#x27;s function. They devote more time to organizational and directional functions. Their roles can be emphasized as executing organizational plans in conformance with the company&#x27;s policies and the top management&#x27;s objectives, defining and discussing information and policies from top management to lower management, and most importantly, inspiring and providing guidance to lower-level managers towards better performance.

Middle management is the midway management of a categorized organization, being secondary to the senior management but above the deepest levels of operational members. An operational manager may be well-thought-out by middle management or may be categorized as a non-management operator, liable to the policy of the specific organization. The efficiency of the middle level is vital in any organization since it bridges the gap between top-level and bottom-level staff.

Their functions include:
* Designing and implementing effective group and inter-group work and information systems
* Defining and monitoring group-level performance indicators
* Diagnosing and resolving problems within and among workgroups
* Designing and implementing reward systems that support cooperative behavior, as well as making decisions and sharing ideas with top managers

===Line management===
Line managers include supervisors, section leaders, forepersons, and team leaders. They focus on controlling and directing regular employees. They are usually responsible for assigning employees tasks, guiding and supervising employees on day-to-day activities, ensuring the quality and quantity of production and/or service, making recommendations and suggestions to employees on their work, and channeling employee concerns that they cannot resolve to mid-level managers or other administrators. Low-level or &quot;front-line&quot; managers also act as role models for their employees. In some types of work, front-line managers may also do some of the same tasks that employees do, at least some of the time. For example, in some restaurants, the front-line managers will also serve customers during a very busy period of the day. In general, line managers are considered part of the workforce and not part of the organization&#x27;s proper management despite performing traditional management functions.

Front-line managers typically provide:
* Training for new employees
* Basic supervision
* Motivation
* Performance feedback and guidance

Some front-line managers may also provide career planning for employees who aim to rise within the organization.

==Training and education==
Colleges and universities around the world offer bachelor&#x27;s degrees, graduate degrees, diplomas, and certificates in management; generally within their colleges of business, business schools, or faculty of management but also in other related departments. 

Higher education has been characterized as a necessary factor in the managerial revolution in the 20th century.

===Requirement===
While some professions require academic credentials in order to work in the profession (e.g., law, medicine, and engineering, which require, respectively the Bachelor of Law, Doctor of Medicine, and Bachelor of Engineering degrees), management and administration positions do not necessarily require the completion of academic degrees. Some well-known senior executives in the US who did not complete a degree include Steve Jobs, Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg. However, many managers and executives have completed some type of business or management training, such as a Bachelor of Commerce or a Master of Business Administration degree. Some major organizations, including companies, non-profit organizations, and governments, require applicants to managerial or executive positions to hold at minimum bachelor&#x27;s degree in a field related to administration or management, or in the case of business jobs, a Bachelor of Commerce or a similar degree.

===Undergraduate===
At the undergraduate level, the most common business programs are the Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) and Bachelor of Commerce (B.Com.).
These typically comprise a four-year program designed to give students an overview of the role of managers in planning and directing within an organization. 
Course topics include accounting, financial management, statistics, marketing, strategy, and other related areas.

Many other undergraduate degrees include the study of management, such as Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees with a major in business administration or management and the Bachelor of Arts (BA) or Bachelor of Science (BS) in political science (PoliSci) with a concentration in public administration or the Bachelor of Public Administration (B.P.A), a degree designed for individuals aiming to work as bureaucrats in the government jobs. 
Many colleges and universities also offer certificates and diplomas in business administration or management, which typically require one to two years of full-time study.

To manage technological areas, one often needs an undergraduate degree in a STEM area.

===Graduate===

At the graduate level students aiming at careers as managers or executives may choose to specialize in major subareas of management or business administration such as entrepreneurship, human resources, international business, organizational behavior, organizational theory, strategic management, accounting, corporate finance, entertainment, global management, healthcare management, investment management, sustainability and real estate.

A Master of Business Administration (MBA) is the most popular professional degree at the master&#x27;s level and can be obtained from many universities in the United States. MBA programs provide further education in management and leadership for graduate students. Other master&#x27;s degrees in business and management include Master of Management (MM) and the Master of Science (M.Sc.) in business administration or management, which is typically taken by students aiming to become researchers or professors.

There are also specialized master&#x27;s degrees in administration for individuals aiming at careers outside of business, such as the Master of Public Administration (MPA) degree (also offered as a Master of Arts or Master of Science in public administration in some universities), for students aiming to become managers or executives in the public service and the Master of Health Administration, for students aiming to become managers or executives in the health care and hospital sector.

Management doctorates are the most advanced terminal degrees in the field of business and management. Most individuals obtaining management doctorates take the programs to obtain the training in research methods, statistical analysis, and writing academic papers that they will need to seek careers as researchers, senior consultants, and/or professors in business administration or management. There are several types of management doctorates: the Doctor of Management (DM), the Doctor of Business Administration (DBA), the Doctor of Public Administration(DPA), the Ph.D. in business administration, the Ph.D. in management, and the Ph.D. in political science with a concentration in public administration. In the 2010s, doctorates in business administration and management were available with many specializations.

===Good practices===
While management trends can change fast, the long-term trend in management has been defined by a market embracing diversity and a rising service industry. Managers are currently being trained to encourage greater equality of opportunities for minorities and women in the workplace, offering increased flexibility in working hours, better retraining, and innovative (and usually industry-specific) performance markers. Managers destined for the service sector are being trained to use unique measurement techniques, better worker support, and more charismatic leadership styles. Promotion prospects can incentivise performance improvements. Human resources finds itself increasingly working with management in a training capacity to help collect management data on the success (or failure) of management actions with employees. 

Good practices identified for managers include &quot;walking the shop floor&quot;, and, especially for managers who are new in post, identifying and achieving some &quot;quick wins&quot; which demonstrate visible success in establishing appropriate objectives. Leadership writer John Kotter uses the phrase &quot;Short-Term Wins&quot; to express the same idea. As in all work, achieving an appropriate work-life balance for self and others is an important management practice.

====Evidence-based management====

Evidence-based management is an emerging movement to use the current, best evidence in management and decision-making. It is part of the larger movement towards evidence-based practices. Evidence-based management entails managerial decisions and organizational practices informed by the best available evidence. As with other evidence-based practice, this is based on the three principles of published peer-reviewed (often in management or social science journals) research evidence that bears on whether and why a particular management practice works; judgment and experience from contextual management practice, to understand the organization and interpersonal dynamics in a situation and determine the risks and benefits of available actions; and the preferences and values of those affected.

==History==
Some see management as a late-modern (in the sense of late modernity) conceptualization. On those terms it cannot have a pre-modern history – only harbingers (such as stewards). Others, however, detect management-like thought among ancient Sumerian traders and the builders of the pyramids of ancient Egypt. Slave owners through the centuries faced the problems of exploiting and motivating a dependent but sometimes unenthusiastic or recalcitrant workforce, but many pre-industrial enterprises, given their small scale, did not feel compelled to face the issues of management systematically. However, innovations such as the spread of Arabic numerals (5th to 15th centuries) and the codification of double-entry book-keeping (1494) provided tools for management assessment, planning and control.

* An organization is more stable if members have the right to express their differences and solve their conflicts within it.
* While one person can begin an organization, &quot;it is lasting when it is left in the care of many and when many desire to maintain it&quot;.
* A weak manager can follow a strong one, but not another weak one, and maintain authority.
* A manager seeking to change an established organization &quot;should retain at least a shadow of the ancient customs&quot;.

With the changing workplaces of the Industrial Revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries, military theory and practice contributed approaches to managing the newly popular factories.

Given the scale of most commercial operations and the lack of mechanized record-keeping and recording before the Industrial Revolution, it made sense for most owners of enterprises in those times to carry out management functions by and for themselves. But with the growing size and complexity of organizations, a distinction between owners (individuals, industrial dynasties, or groups of shareholders) and day-to-day managers (independent specialists in planning and control) gradually became more common.

===Early writing===
The field of management originated in ancient China, including possibly the first highly centralized bureaucratic state, and the earliest (by the second century BC) example of an administration based on merit through testing. Some theorists have cited ancient military texts as providing lessons for civilian managers. For example, Chinese general Sun Tzu in his 6th-century BC work &quot;The Art of War&quot; recommends (when re-phrased in modern terminology) being aware of and acting on strengths and weaknesses of both a manager&#x27;s organization and a foe&#x27;s. The writings of influential Chinese Legalist philosopher Shen Buhai may be considered to embody a rare premodern example of abstract theory of administration. American philosopher Herrlee G. Creel and other scholars find the influence of Chinese administration in Europe by the 12th century. Thomas Taylor Meadows, Britain&#x27;s consul in Guangzhou, argued in his &quot;Desultory Notes on the Government and People of China&quot; (1847) that &quot;the long duration of the Chinese empire is solely and altogether owing to the good government which consists in the advancement of men of talent and merit only,&quot; and that the British must reform their civil service by making the institution meritocratic. Influenced by the ancient Chinese imperial examination, the Northcote–Trevelyan Report of 1854 recommended that recruitment should be on the basis of merit determined through competitive examination, candidates should have a solid general education to enable inter-departmental transfers, and promotion should be through achievement rather than &quot;preferment, patronage, or purchase&quot;. This led to implementation of Her Majesty&#x27;s Civil Service as a systematic, meritocratic civil service bureaucracy. Like the British, the development of French bureaucracy was influenced by the Chinese system. Voltaire claimed that the Chinese had &quot;perfected moral science&quot; and François Quesnay advocated an economic and political system modeled after that of the Chinese. French civil service examinations adopted in the late 19th century were also heavily based on general cultural studies. These features have been likened to the earlier Chinese model.

Various ancient and medieval civilizations produced &quot;mirrors for princes&quot; books, which aimed to advise new monarchs on how to govern. Plato described job specialization in 350 BC, and Alfarabi listed several leadership traits in AD 900. Other examples include the Indian &quot;Arthashastra&quot; by Chanakya (written around 300 BC), and &quot;The Prince&quot; by Italian author
Niccolò Machiavelli ().

Written in 1776 by Adam Smith, a Scottish moral philosopher, &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; discussed efficient organization of work through division of labour.
Smith described how changes in processes could boost productivity in the manufacture of pins. While individuals could produce 200 pins per day, Smith analyzed the steps involved in the manufacture and, with 10 specialists, enabled the production of 48,000 pins per day.

===19th century===
Classical economists such as Adam Smith (1723–1790) and John Stuart Mill (1806–1873) provided a theoretical background to resource allocation, production (economics), and pricing issues. About the same time, innovators like Eli Whitney (1765–1825), James Watt (1736–1819), and Matthew Boulton (1728–1809) developed elements of technical production such as standardization, quality-control procedures, cost-accounting, interchangeability of parts, and work-planning. Many of these aspects of management existed in the pre-1861 slave-based sector of the US economy. That environment saw 4 million people, as the contemporary usages had it, &quot;managed&quot; in profitable quasi-mass production
before wage slavery eclipsed chattel slavery.

Salaried managers as an identifiable group first became prominent in the late 19th century. As large corporations began to overshadow small family businesses the need for personnel management positions became more necessary. Businesses grew into large corporations and the need for clerks, bookkeepers, secretaries and managers expanded. The demand for trained managers led college and university administrators to consider and move forward with plans to create the first schools of business on their campuses.

===20th century===
At the turn of the twentieth century, the need for skilled and trained managers had become increasingly apparent. The demand occurred as personnel departments began to expand rapidly. In 1915, less than one in twenty manufacturing firms had a dedicated personnel department. By 1929 that number had grown to over one-third. Formal management education became standardized at colleges and universities. Colleges and universities capitalized on the needs of corporations by forming business schools and corporate placement departments. This shift toward formal business education marked the creation of a corporate elite in the US.

By about 1900 one finds managers trying to place their theories on what they regarded as a thoroughly scientific basis (see scientism for perceived limitations of this belief). Examples include Henry R. Towne&#x27;s &quot;Science of management&quot; in the 1890s, Frederick Winslow Taylor&#x27;s &quot;The Principles of Scientific Management&quot; (1911), Lillian Gilbreth&#x27;s &quot;Psychology of Management&quot; (1914), Frank and Lillian Gilbreth&#x27;s &quot;Applied motion study&quot; (1917), and Henry L. Gantt&#x27;s charts (1910s). J. Duncan wrote the first college management textbook in 1911. In 1912 Yoichi Ueno introduced Taylorism to Japan and became the first management consultant of the &quot;Japanese management style&quot;. His son Ichiro Ueno pioneered Japanese quality assurance.

The first comprehensive theories of management appeared around 1920. The Harvard Business School offered the first Master of Business Administration degree (MBA) in 1921. People like Henri Fayol (1841–1925) and Alexander Church (1866–1936) described the various branches of management and their inter-relationships. In the early 20th century, people like Ordway Tead (1891–1973), Walter Scott (1869–1955) and J. Mooney applied the principles of psychology to management. Other writers, such as Elton Mayo (1880–1949), Mary Parker Follett (1868–1933), Chester Barnard (1886–1961), Max Weber (1864–1920), who saw what he called the &quot;administrator&quot; as bureaucrat, Rensis Likert (1903–1981), and Chris Argyris (born 1923) approached the phenomenon of management from a sociological perspective.

Peter Drucker (1909–2005) wrote one of the earliest books on applied management: &quot;Concept of the Corporation&quot; (published in 1946). It resulted from Alfred Sloan (chairman of General Motors until 1956) commissioning a study of the organization. Drucker went on to write 39 books, many in the same vein.

H. Dodge, Ronald Fisher (1890–1962), and Thornton C. Fry introduced statistical techniques into management studies. In the 1940s, Patrick Blackett worked in the development of the applied-mathematics science of operations research, initially for military operations. Operations research, sometimes known as &quot;management science&quot; (but distinct from Taylor&#x27;s scientific management), attempts to take a scientific approach to solving decision problems and can apply directly to multiple management problems, particularly in the areas of logistics and operations.

Some of the later 20th-century developments include the theory of constraints (introduced in 1984), management by objectives (systematized in 1954), re-engineering (the early 1990s), Six Sigma (1986), management by walking around (1970s), the Viable system model (1972), and various information-technology-driven theories such as agile software development (so-named from 2001), as well as group-management theories such as Cog&#x27;s Ladder (1972) and the notion of &quot;thriving on chaos&quot; (1987).

As the general recognition of managers as a class solidified during the 20th century and gave perceived practitioners of the art/science of management a certain amount of prestige, so the way opened for popularised systems of management ideas to peddle their wares. In this context, many management fads may have had more to do with pop psychology than with scientific theories of management.

Business management includes the following branches:

# financial management
# human resource management
# Management cybernetics
# information technology management (responsible for management information systems )
# marketing management
# operations management and production management
# strategic management

===21st century===
Branches of management theory also exist relating to nonprofits and to government: such as public administration, public management, and educational management. Further, management programs related to civil society organizations have also spawned programs in nonprofit management and social entrepreneurship.

Many of the assumptions made by management have come under attack from business-ethics viewpoints, critical management studies, and anti-corporate activism. This could include violations to a company’s ethics policy. 

As one consequence, workplace democracy (sometimes referred to as Workers&#x27; self-management) has become both more common and more advocated, in some places distributing all management functions among workers, each of whom takes on a portion of the work. However, these models predate any current political issue and may occur more naturally than does a command hierarchy.

== Nature of work ==
In profitable organizations, management&#x27;s primary function is the satisfaction of a range of stakeholders. This typically involves making a profit (for the shareholders), creating valued products at a reasonable cost (for customers), and providing great employment opportunities for employees. In case of nonprofit management, one of the main functions is, keeping the faith of donors. In most models of management and governance, shareholders vote for the board of directors, and the board then hires senior management. Some organizations have experimented with other methods (such as employee-voting models) of selecting or reviewing managers, but this is rare.

== Topics ==

===Basics===
According to Fayol, management operates through five basic functions: planning, organizing, commanding, coordinating and controlling.
* Planning: Deciding what needs to happen in the future and generating action plans (deciding in advance).
* Organizing (or staffing): Making sure the human and nonhuman resources are put into place.
* Commanding (or leading): Determining what must be done in a situation and getting people to do it.
* Coordinating: Creating a structure through which an organization&#x27;s goals can be accomplished.
* Controlling: Checking progress against plans.

===Basic roles===
* Interpersonal: roles that involve coordination and interaction with employees.
Figurehead, leader, liaison 
* Informational: roles that involve handling, sharing, and analyzing information.
Nerve centre, disseminator, spokesperson 
* Decision: roles that require decision-making.
Entrepreneur, negotiator, allocator, disturbance handler

=== Skills ===
Management skills include:
* Political: used to build a power base and to establish connections.
* Interpersonal: used to communicate, motivate, mentor and delegate.
* Diagnostic: ability to visualize appropriate responses to a situation.
* Leadership: ability to communicate a vision and inspire people to embrace that vision.
** cross-cultural leadership: the ability to understand the effects of culture on leadership style.
* Behavioural: perception towards others, conflict resolution, time management, self-improvement, stress management and resilience, patience, clear communication.

===Implementation of policies and strategies===
* All policies and strategies must be discussed with all managerial personnel and staff.
* Managers must understand where and how they can implement their policies and strategies.
* An action plan must be devised for each department.
* Policies and strategies must be reviewed regularly.
* Contingency plans must be devised in case the environment changes.
* Top-level managers should carry out regular progress assessments.
* The business requires team spirit and a good environment.
* The missions, objectives, strengths, and weaknesses of each department must be analyzed to determine their roles in achieving the business&#x27;s mission.
* The forecasting method develops a reliable picture of the business&#x27;s future environment.
* A planning unit must be created to ensure that all plans are consistent and that policies and strategies are aimed at achieving the same mission and objectives.

==Policies and strategies in the planning process==
* They give mid and lower-level managers a good idea of the future plans for each department in an organization.
* A framework is created whereby plans and decisions are made.
* Mid and lower-level management may add their own plans to the business&#x27;s strategies.

<text>Mineralogy is a subject of geology specializing in the scientific study of the chemistry, crystal structure, and physical (including optical) properties of minerals and mineralized artifacts. Specific studies within mineralogy include the processes of mineral origin and formation, classification of minerals, their geographical distribution, as well as their utilization.

==History==

Early writing on mineralogy, especially on gemstones, comes from ancient Babylonia, the ancient Greco-Roman world, ancient and medieval China, and Sanskrit texts from ancient India and the ancient Islamic world. Books on the subject included the &quot;Natural History&quot; of Pliny the Elder, which not only described many different minerals but also explained many of their properties, and Kitab al Jawahir (Book of Precious Stones) by Persian scientist Al-Biruni. The German Renaissance specialist Georgius Agricola wrote works such as &quot;De re metallica&quot; (&quot;On Metals&quot;, 1556) and &quot;De Natura Fossilium&quot; (&quot;On the Nature of Rocks&quot;, 1546) which began the scientific approach to the subject. Systematic scientific studies of minerals and rocks developed in post-Renaissance Europe. The modern study of mineralogy was founded on the principles of crystallography (the origins of geometric crystallography, itself, can be traced back to the mineralogy practiced in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries) and to the microscopic study of rock sections with the invention of the microscope in the 17th century.

Nicholas Steno first observed the law of constancy of interfacial angles (also known as the first law of crystallography) in quartz crystals in 1669. This was later generalized and established experimentally by Jean-Baptiste L. Romé de l&#x27;Islee in 1783. René Just Haüy, the &quot;father of modern crystallography&quot;, showed that crystals are periodic and established that the orientations of crystal faces can be expressed in terms of rational numbers (law of rational indices), as later encoded in the Miller indices. In 1814, Jöns Jacob Berzelius introduced a classification of minerals based on their chemistry rather than their crystal structure. William Nicol developed the Nicol prism, which polarizes light, in 1827–1828 while studying fossilized wood; Henry Clifton Sorby showed that thin sections of minerals could be identified by their optical properties using a polarizing microscope. James D. Dana published his first edition of &quot;A System of Mineralogy&quot; in 1837, and in a later edition introduced a chemical classification that is still the standard. X-ray diffraction was demonstrated by Max von Laue in 1912, and developed into a tool for analyzing the crystal structure of minerals by the father/son team of William Henry Bragg and William Lawrence Bragg.

More recently, driven by advances in experimental technique (such as neutron diffraction) and available computational power, the latter of which has enabled extremely accurate atomic-scale simulations of the behaviour of crystals, the science has branched out to consider more general problems in the fields of inorganic chemistry and solid-state physics. It, however, retains a focus on the crystal structures commonly encountered in rock-forming minerals (such as the perovskites, clay minerals and framework silicates). In particular, the field has made great advances in the understanding of the relationship between the atomic-scale structure of minerals and their function; in nature, prominent examples would be accurate measurement and prediction of the elastic properties of minerals, which has led to new insight into seismological behaviour of rocks and depth-related discontinuities in seismograms of the Earth&#x27;s mantle. To this end, in their focus on the connection between atomic-scale phenomena and macroscopic properties, the &quot;mineral sciences&quot; (as they are now commonly known) display perhaps more of an overlap with materials science than any other discipline.

==Physical properties==
 
An initial step in identifying a mineral is to examine its physical properties, many of which can be measured on a hand sample. These can be classified into density (often given as specific gravity); measures of mechanical cohesion (hardness, tenacity, cleavage, fracture, parting); macroscopic visual properties (luster, color, streak, luminescence, diaphaneity); magnetic and electric properties; radioactivity and solubility in hydrogen chloride ().

&quot;Hardness&quot; is determined by comparison with other minerals. In the Mohs scale, a standard set of minerals are numbered in order of increasing hardness from 1 (talc) to 10 (diamond). A harder mineral will scratch a softer, so an unknown mineral can be placed in this scale, by which minerals; it scratches and which scratch it. A few minerals such as calcite and kyanite have a hardness that depends significantly on direction. Hardness can also be measured on an absolute scale using a sclerometer; compared to the absolute scale, the Mohs scale is nonlinear.

&quot;Tenacity&quot; refers to the way a mineral behaves, when it is broken, crushed, bent or torn. A mineral can be brittle, malleable, sectile, ductile, flexible or elastic. An important influence on tenacity is the type of chemical bond (&quot;e.g.,&quot; ionic or metallic). 

Of the other measures of mechanical cohesion, &quot;cleavage&quot; is the tendency to break along certain crystallographic planes. It is described by the quality (&quot;e.g.&quot;, perfect or fair) and the orientation of the plane in crystallographic nomenclature. 

&quot;Parting&quot; is the tendency to break along planes of weakness due to pressure, twinning or exsolution. Where these two kinds of break do not occur, &quot;fracture&quot; is a less orderly form that may be &quot;conchoidal&quot; (having smooth curves resembling the interior of a shell), &quot;fibrous&quot;, &quot;splintery&quot;, &quot;hackly&quot; (jagged with sharp edges), or &quot;uneven&quot;.

If the mineral is well crystallized, it will also have a distinctive crystal habit (for example, hexagonal, columnar, botryoidal) that reflects the crystal structure or internal arrangement of atoms. It is also affected by crystal defects and twinning. Many crystals are polymorphic, having more than one possible crystal structure depending on factors such as pressure and temperature.

==Crystal structure==

The crystal structure is the arrangement of atoms in a crystal. It is represented by a lattice of points which repeats a basic pattern, called a unit cell, in three dimensions. The lattice can be characterized by its symmetries and by the dimensions of the unit cell. These dimensions are represented by three &quot;Miller indices&quot;. The lattice remains unchanged by certain symmetry operations about any given point in the lattice: reflection, rotation, inversion, and rotary inversion, a combination of rotation and reflection. Together, they make up a mathematical object called a &quot;crystallographic point group&quot; or &quot;crystal class&quot;. There are 32 possible crystal classes. In addition, there are operations that displace all the points: translation, screw axis, and glide plane. In combination with the point symmetries, they form 230 possible space groups.

Most geology departments have X-ray powder diffraction equipment to analyze the crystal structures of minerals. X-rays have wavelengths that are the same order of magnitude as the distances between atoms. Diffraction, the constructive and destructive interference between waves scattered at different atoms, leads to distinctive patterns of high and low intensity that depend on the geometry of the crystal. In a sample that is ground to a powder, the X-rays sample a random distribution of all crystal orientations. Powder diffraction can distinguish between minerals that may appear the same in a hand sample, for example quartz and its polymorphs tridymite and cristobalite.

Isomorphous minerals of different compositions have similar powder diffraction patterns, the main difference being in spacing and intensity of lines. For example, the (halite) crystal structure is space group &quot;Fm3m&quot;; this structure is shared by sylvite (), periclase (), bunsenite (), galena (), alabandite (), chlorargyrite (), and osbornite ().

==Chemical elements==
A few minerals are chemical elements, including sulfur, copper, silver, and gold, but the vast majority are compounds. The classical method for identifying composition is &quot;wet chemical analysis&quot;, which involves dissolving a mineral in an acid such as hydrochloric acid (HCl). The elements in solution are then identified using colorimetry, volumetric analysis or gravimetric analysis.

Since 1960, most chemistry analysis is done using instruments. One of these, atomic absorption spectroscopy, is similar to wet chemistry in that the sample must still be dissolved, but it is much faster and cheaper. The solution is vaporized and its absorption spectrum is measured in the visible and ultraviolet range. Other techniques are X-ray fluorescence, electron microprobe analysis atom probe tomography and optical emission spectrography.

==Optical==

In addition to macroscopic properties such as colour or lustre, minerals have properties that require a polarizing microscope to observe.

===Transmitted light===
When light passes from air or a vacuum into a transparent crystal, some of it is reflected at the surface and some refracted. The latter is a bending of the light path that occurs because the speed of light changes as it goes into the crystal; Snell&#x27;s law relates the bending angle to the Refractive index, the ratio of speed in a vacuum to speed in the crystal. Crystals whose point symmetry group falls in the cubic system are &quot;isotropic&quot;: the index does not depend on direction. All other crystals are &quot;anisotropic&quot;: light passing through them is broken up into two plane polarized rays that travel at different speeds and refract at different angles.

A polarizing microscope is similar to an ordinary microscope, but it has two plane-polarized filters, a (&quot;polarizer&quot;) below the sample and an analyzer above it, polarized perpendicular to each other. Light passes successively through the polarizer, the sample and the analyzer. If there is no sample, the analyzer blocks all the light from the polarizer. However, an anisotropic sample will generally change the polarization so some of the light can pass through. Thin sections and powders can be used as samples.

When an isotropic crystal is viewed, it appears dark because it does not change the polarization of the light. However, when it is immersed in a calibrated liquid with a lower index of refraction and the microscope is thrown out of focus, a bright line called a &quot;Becke line&quot; appears around the perimeter of the crystal. By observing the presence or absence of such lines in liquids with different indices, the index of the crystal can be estimated, usually to within .

==Systematic==
Systematic mineralogy is the identification and classification of minerals by their properties. Historically, mineralogy was heavily concerned with taxonomy of the rock-forming minerals. In 1959, the International Mineralogical Association formed the Commission of New Minerals and Mineral Names to rationalize the nomenclature and regulate the introduction of new names. In July 2006, it was merged with the Commission on Classification of Minerals to form the Commission on New Minerals, Nomenclature, and Classification. There are over 6,000 named and unnamed minerals, and about 100 are discovered each year. The &quot;Manual of Mineralogy&quot; places minerals in the following classes: native elements, sulfides, sulfosalts, oxides and hydroxides, halides, carbonates, nitrates and borates, sulfates, chromates, molybdates and tungstates, phosphates, arsenates and vanadates, and silicates.

==Formation environments==
The environments of mineral formation and growth are highly varied, ranging from slow crystallization at the high temperatures and pressures of igneous melts deep within the Earth&#x27;s crust to the low temperature precipitation from a saline brine at the Earth&#x27;s surface.

Various possible methods of formation include:

*sublimation from volcanic gases
*deposition from aqueous solutions and hydrothermal brines
*crystallization from an igneous magma or lava
*recrystallization due to metamorphic processes and metasomatism
*crystallization during diagenesis of sediments
*formation by oxidation and weathering of rocks exposed to the atmosphere or within the soil environment.

==Biomineralogy==
Biomineralogy is a cross-over field between mineralogy, paleontology and biology. It is the study of how plants and animals stabilize minerals under biological control, and the sequencing of mineral replacement of those minerals after deposition. It uses techniques from chemical mineralogy, especially isotopic studies, to determine such things as growth forms in living plants and animals as well as things like the original mineral content of fossils.

A new approach to mineralogy called mineral evolution explores the co-evolution of the geosphere and biosphere, including the role of minerals in the origin of life and processes as mineral-catalyzed organic synthesis and the selective adsorption of organic molecules on mineral surfaces.

==Mineral ecology==
In 2011, several researchers began to develop a Mineral Evolution Database. This database integrates the crowd-sourced site Mindat.org, which has over 690,000 mineral-locality pairs, with the official IMA list of approved minerals and age data from geological publications.

This database makes it possible to apply statistics to answer new questions, an approach that has been called &quot;mineral ecology&quot;. One such question is how much of mineral evolution is deterministic and how much the result of chance. Some factors are deterministic, such as the chemical nature of a mineral and conditions for its stability; but mineralogy can also be affected by the processes that determine a planet&#x27;s composition. In a 2015 paper, Robert Hazen and others analyzed the number of minerals involving each element as a function of its abundance. They found that Earth, with over 4800 known minerals and 72 elements, has a power law relationship. The Moon, with only 63 minerals and 24 elements (based on a much smaller sample) has essentially the same relationship. This implies that, given the chemical composition of the planet, one could predict the more common minerals. However, the distribution has a long tail, with 34% of the minerals having been found at only one or two locations. The model predicts that thousands more mineral species may await discovery or have formed and then been lost to erosion, burial or other processes. This implies a role of chance in the formation of rare minerals occur.

In another use of big data sets, network theory was applied to a dataset of carbon minerals, revealing new patterns in their diversity and distribution. The analysis can show which minerals tend to coexist and what conditions (geological, physical, chemical and biological) are associated with them. This information can be used to predict where to look for new deposits and even new mineral species.
==Uses==

Minerals are essential to various needs within human society, such as minerals used as ores for essential components of metal products used in various commodities and machinery, essential components to building materials such as limestone, marble, granite, gravel, glass, plaster, cement, etc. Minerals are also used in fertilizers to enrich the growth of agricultural crops.
===Collecting===

Mineral collecting is also a recreational study and collection hobby, with clubs and societies representing the field. Museums, such as the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History Hall of Geology, Gems, and Minerals, the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, the Natural History Museum, London, and the private Mim Mineral Museum in Beirut, Lebanon, have popular collections of mineral specimens on permanent display.

<text>Maple syrup is a sweet syrup made from the sap of maple trees. In cold climates, these trees store starch in their trunks and roots before winter; the starch is then converted to sugar that rises in the sap in late winter and early spring. Maple trees are tapped by drilling holes into their trunks and collecting the sap, which is processed by heating to evaporate much of the water, leaving the concentrated syrup.

Maple syrup was first made by the Indigenous peoples of Northeastern North America. The practice was adopted by European settlers, who gradually changed production methods. Technological improvements in the 1970s further refined syrup processing. Almost all of the world&#x27;s maple syrup is produced in Canada and the United States.

Maple syrup is graded based on its colour and taste. Sucrose is the most prevalent sugar in maple syrup. In Canada, syrups must be made exclusively from maple sap to qualify as maple syrup and must also be at least 66 per cent sugar. In the United States, a syrup must be made almost entirely from maple sap to be labelled as &quot;maple&quot;, though states such as Vermont and New York have more restrictive definitions.

Maple syrup is often used as a condiment for pancakes, waffles, French toast, oatmeal, or porridge. It is also used as an ingredient in baking and as a sweetener or flavouring agent.

== Sources ==

Three species of maple (&quot;Acer&quot;) trees are predominantly used to produce maple syrup: the sugar maple (&quot;Acer saccharum&quot;), the black maple (&quot;A. nigrum&quot;), and the red maple (&quot;A. rubrum&quot;), because of the high sugar content (roughly two to five per cent) in the sap of these species. The black maple is included as a subspecies or variety in a more broadly viewed concept of &quot;A. saccharum&quot;, the sugar maple, by some botanists. Of these, the red maple has a shorter season because it buds earlier than sugar and black maples, which alters the flavour of the sap.

A few other species of maple are also sometimes used as sources of sap for producing maple syrup, including the box elder or Manitoba maple (&quot;Acer negundo&quot;), the silver maple (&quot;A. saccharinum&quot;), and the bigleaf maple (&quot;A. macrophyllum&quot;). In the Southeastern United States, Florida sugar maple (&quot;Acer floridanum&quot;) is occasionally used for maple syrup production.

Similar syrups may also be produced from walnut, birch, or palm trees, among other sources.

== History ==
=== Indigenous peoples ===

Indigenous peoples living in northeastern North America were the first groups known to have produced maple syrup and maple sugar. According to Indigenous oral traditions, as well as archaeological evidence, maple tree sap was being processed into syrup long before Europeans arrived in the region. There are no authenticated accounts of how maple syrup production and consumption began, but various legends exist; one of the most popular involves maple sap being used in place of water to cook venison served to a chief. Indigenous tribes developed rituals around syrup-making, celebrating the Sugar Moon (the first full moon of spring) with a Maple Dance. Many aboriginal dishes replaced the salt traditional in European cuisine with maple syrup.

The Algonquians recognized maple sap as a source of energy and nutrition. At the beginning of the spring thaw, they made V-shaped incisions in tree trunks; they then inserted reeds or concave pieces of bark to run the sap into clay buckets or tightly woven birch-bark baskets. The maple sap was concentrated first by leaving it exposed to the cold temperatures overnight and disposing of the layer of ice that formed on top. Following that, the sap was transported by sled to large fires where it was boiled in clay pots to produce maple syrup. Often, multiple pots were used in conjunction, with the liquid being transferred between them as it grew more concentrated. Contrary to popular belief, syrup was not typically produced by dropping heated stones into wooden bowls, especially in northeast North America where Indigenous cultures had been using clay pots for thousands of years. However, modern and historic sources contain evidence that hot stones may have occasionally been used in the upper Midwest and Canada, where hollowed out logs and birchbark containers typically replaced clay pots.

=== European colonists===
In the early stages of European colonization in northeastern North America, local Indigenous peoples showed the arriving colonists how to tap the trunks of certain types of maples during the spring thaw to harvest the sap. André Thevet, the &quot;Royal Cosmographer of France&quot;, wrote about Jacques Cartier drinking maple sap during his Canadian voyages. By 1680, European settlers and fur traders were involved in harvesting maple products. However, rather than making incisions in the bark, the Europeans used the method of drilling tapholes in the trunks with augers. Prior to the 19th century, processed maple sap was used primarily as a source of concentrated sugar, in both liquid and crystallized-solid form, as cane sugar had to be imported from the West Indies.

Maple sugaring parties typically began to operate at the start of the spring thaw in regions of woodland with sufficiently large numbers of maples. Syrup makers first bored holes in the trunks, usually more than one hole per large tree; they then inserted wooden spouts into the holes and hung a wooden bucket from the protruding end of each spout to collect the sap. The buckets were commonly made by cutting cylindrical segments from a large tree trunk and then hollowing out each segment&#x27;s core from one end of the cylinder, creating a seamless, watertight container. Sap filled the buckets, and was then either transferred to larger holding vessels (barrels, large pots, or hollowed-out wooden logs), often mounted on sledges or wagons pulled by draft animals, or carried in buckets or other convenient containers. The sap-collection buckets were returned to the spouts mounted on the trees, and the process was repeated for as long as the flow of sap remained &quot;sweet&quot;. The specific weather conditions of the thaw period were, and still are, critical in determining the length of the sugaring season. As the weather continues to warm, a maple tree&#x27;s normal early spring biological process eventually alters the taste of the sap, making it unpalatable, perhaps due to an increase in amino acids.

The boiling process was very time-consuming. The harvested sap was transported back to the party&#x27;s base camp, where it was then poured into large vessels (usually made from metal) and boiled down to achieve the desired concentration. The sap was usually transported using large barrels pulled by horses or oxen to a central collection point, where it was processed either over a fire built out in the open or inside a shelter built for that purpose (the &quot;sugar shack&quot;).

===Since 1850===

Around the time of the American Civil War (1861–1865), syrup makers started using large, flat sheet metal pans as they were more efficient for boiling than heavy, rounded iron kettles, because of a greater surface area for evaporation. Around this time, cane sugar replaced maple sugar as the dominant sweetener in the US; as a result, producers focused marketing efforts on maple syrup. The first evaporator, used to heat and concentrate sap, was patented in 1858. In 1872, an evaporator was developed that featured two pans and a metal arch or firebox, which greatly decreased boiling time. Around 1900, producers bent the tin that formed the bottom of a pan into a series of flues, which increased the heated surface area of the pan and again decreased boiling time. Some producers also added a finishing pan, a separate batch evaporator, as a final stage in the evaporation process.

Buckets began to be replaced with plastic bags, which allowed people to see at a distance how much sap had been collected. Syrup producers also began using tractors to haul vats of sap from the trees being tapped (the sugar bush) to the evaporator. Some producers adopted motor-powered tappers and metal tubing systems to convey sap from the tree to a central collection container, but these techniques were not widely used. Heating methods also diversified: modern producers use wood, oil, natural gas, propane, or steam to evaporate sap. Modern filtration methods were perfected to prevent contamination of the syrup.

A large number of technological changes took place during the 1970s. Plastic tubing systems that had been experimental since the early part of the century were perfected, and the sap came directly from the tree to the evaporator house. Vacuum pumps were added to the tubing systems, and preheaters were developed to recycle heat lost in the steam. Producers developed reverse-osmosis machines to take a portion of water out of the sap before it was boiled, increasing processing efficiency.

Improvements in tubing and vacuum pumps, new filtering techniques, &quot;supercharged&quot; preheaters, and better storage containers have since been developed. Research continues on pest control and improved woodlot management. In 2009, researchers at the University of Vermont unveiled a new type of tap that prevents backflow of sap into the tree, reducing bacterial contamination and preventing the tree from attempting to heal the bore hole. Experiments show that it may be possible to use saplings in a plantation instead of mature trees, dramatically boosting productivity per acre. As a result of the smaller tree diameter, milder diurnal temperature swings are needed for the tree to freeze and thaw, which enables sap production in milder climatic conditions outside of northeastern North America.

== Processing ==
Open pan evaporation methods have been streamlined since colonial days, but remain basically unchanged. Sap must first be collected and boiled down to obtain syrup. Maple syrup is made by boiling between 20 and 50 volumes of sap (depending on its concentration) over an open fire until 1 volume of syrup is obtained, usually at a temperature over the boiling point of water. As the boiling point of water varies with changes in air pressure, the correct value for pure water is determined at the place where the syrup is being produced each time evaporation is begun and periodically throughout the day. Syrup can be boiled entirely over one heat source or can be drawn off into smaller batches and boiled at a more controlled temperature. Defoamers are often added during boiling.

Boiling the syrup is a tightly controlled process, which ensures appropriate sugar content. Syrup boiled too long will eventually crystallize, whereas under-boiled syrup will be watery, and will quickly spoil. The finished syrup has a density of 66° on the Brix scale (a hydrometric scale used to measure sugar solutions). The syrup is then filtered to remove precipitated &quot;sugar sand&quot;, crystals made up largely of sugar and calcium malate. These crystals are not toxic, but create a &quot;gritty&quot; texture in the syrup if not filtered out.

In addition to open pan evaporation methods, many large producers use the more fuel efficient reverse osmosis procedure to separate the water from the sap. Smaller producers can also use batchwise recirculating reverse osmosis, with the most energy-efficient operation taking the sugar concentration to 25% prior to boiling.

The higher the sugar content of the sap, the smaller the volume of sap is needed to obtain the same amount of syrup. To yield 1 unit of syrup, sap at 1.5 per cent sugar content will require 57 units, while sap at 3.5 per cent sugar content only needs 25 units of sap. The sap&#x27;s sugar content is highly variable and will fluctuate even within the same tree.

The filtered syrup is graded and packaged while still hot, usually at a temperature of or greater. The containers are turned over after being sealed to sterilize the cap with the hot syrup. Packages can be made of metal, glass, or coated plastic, depending on volume and target market. The syrup can also be heated longer and further processed to create a variety of other maple products, including maple sugar, maple butter or cream, and maple candy or taffy.

=== Off-flavours ===

Off-flavours can sometimes develop during the production of maple syrup, resulting from contaminants in the boiling apparatus (such as disinfectants), microorganisms, fermentation products, metallic can flavours, and &quot;buddy sap&quot;, an off-flavour occurring late in the syrup season when tree budding has begun. In some circumstances, it is possible to remove off-flavours through processing.

== Production ==

Maple syrup production is centred in northeastern North America; however, given the correct weather conditions, it can be made wherever suitable species of maple trees grow, such as New Zealand, where there are efforts to establish commercial production. Climate change is dramatically impacting the production of maple syrup.

A maple syrup production farm is called a &quot;sugarbush&quot;. Sap is often boiled in a &quot;sugar house&quot; (also known as a &quot;sugar shack&quot;, &quot;sugar cabin&quot;, &quot;sugar shanty&quot;, or &quot;cabane à sucre&quot;), a building louvred at the top to vent the steam from the boiling sap.

Maples are usually tapped beginning at 30 to 40 years of age. Each tree can support between one and three taps, depending on its trunk diameter. The average maple tree will produce of sap per season, up to per day. This is roughly equal to seven per cent of its total sap. Tap seasons typically happen during late winter and spring and usually last for four to eight weeks, though the exact dates depend on the weather, location, and climate. The timing of the season and the region of maximum sap flow are both expected to be significantly altered by climate change by 2100.

During the day, sucrose stored in the roots for the winter rises through the trunk as sugary sap. A hole is bored into the trunk of the tree to allow the sap to flow out of a spile that is tapped in the hole. The taps are left in place for the season, and the sap flows during the day when the temperature is above freezing. Some producers also tap in autumn, though this practice is less common than spring tapping. Maples can continue to be tapped for sap until they are over 100 years old.

== Commerce ==
Until the 1930s, the United States produced most of the world&#x27;s maple syrup. Today, after rapid growth in the 1990s, Canada produces more than 80 per cent of the world&#x27;s maple syrup, producing about in 2016. Within Canada, Quebec is the largest producer, responsible for 72 per cent of the world&#x27;s output; Canadian exports of maple syrup in 2016 were C$487 million (about US$360 million), with Quebec accounting for some 90 per cent of this total. In 2023, Canada exported $376 million of maple syrup to the United States, $47.8 million to Germany, $31.6 million to France, and $30.2 million to the UK, exporting to 68 countries in total.

, Quebec accounts for 91.6 per cent of maple syrup produced in Canada, followed by New Brunswick at 4.7 per cent and Ontario at 3.4 per cent. However, 96.8 per cent of exported Canadian maple syrup originated from Quebec, whereas 2.6 per cent of exported syrup originated from New Brunswick, and the remaining 0.6 per cent from all other provinces. Ontario holds the most maple syrup farms in Canada outside of Quebec, with 389 maple syrup producers in 2021. This is followed by New Brunswick, with 114 maple syrup producers; and Nova Scotia, with 39 maple syrup producers.

As of 2016, Quebec had some 7,300 producers working with 13,500 farmers, collectively making over of syrup. Production in Quebec is controlled through a supply management system, with producers receiving quota allotments from the government sanctioned Quebec Maple Syrup Producers (QMSP; ), which also maintains reserves of syrup, although there is a black-market trade in Quebec product. In 2017, the QMSP mandated increased output of maple syrup production, attempting to establish Quebec&#x27;s dominance in the world market.

The Canadian provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan produce maple syrup using the sap of the box elder or Manitoba maple (&quot;Acer negundo&quot;). In 2011, there were 67 maple syrup producers in Manitoba and 24 in Saskatchewan. A Manitoba maple tree&#x27;s yield is usually less than half that of a similar sugar maple tree. Manitoba maple syrup has a slightly different flavour from sugar-maple syrup, because it contains less sugar and the tree&#x27;s sap flows more slowly. British Columbia is home to a growing maple sugar industry using sap from the bigleaf maple, which is native to the West Coast of the United States and Canada. In 2011, there were 82 maple syrup producers in British Columbia.

Vermont has long been the largest US producer, with a record produced in 2022. In 2019 it led with over , followed by New York with and Maine with . Wisconsin, Ohio, New Hampshire, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and Connecticut all produced marketable quantities of maple syrup.

Maple syrup has been produced on a small scale in some other countries, notably Japan and South Korea. However, in South Korea in particular, it is traditional to consume maple sap, called &quot;gorosoe&quot;, instead of processing it into syrup.

== Markings ==
Under Canadian maple product regulations, containers of maple syrup must include the words &quot;maple syrup&quot;, its grade name and net quantity in litres or millilitres, on the main display panel with a minimum font size of 1.6 mm. If the maple syrup is of Canada Grade A level, the name of the colour class must appear on the label in both English and French. Also, the lot number or production code, and either: (1) the name and address of the sugar bush establishment, packing or shipper establishment, or (2) the first dealer and the registration number of the packing establishment, must be labelled on any display panel other than the bottom.

== Grades ==
Following an effort from the International Maple Syrup Institute (IMSI) and many maple syrup producer associations, both Canada and the United States have altered their laws regarding the classification of maple syrup to be uniform. Whereas in the past each state or province had their own laws on the classification of maple syrup, now those laws define a unified grading system. This had been a work in progress for several years, and most of the finalization of the new grading system was made in 2014. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) announced in the &quot;Canada Gazette&quot; on 28 June 2014 that rules for the sale of maple syrup would be amended to include new descriptors, at the request of the IMSI.

As of 31 December 2014, the CFIA and as of 2 March 2015, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Marketing Service issued revised standards intended to harmonize Canadian and United States regulations on the classification of maple syrup as follows:

*Grade A
**Golden colour and delicate taste
**Amber colour and rich taste
**Dark colour and robust taste
**Very dark colour and strong taste
*Processing grade
*Substandard

As long as maple syrup does not have an off-flavour, is of a uniform colour, and is free from turbidity and sediment, it can be labelled as one of the A grades. If it exhibits any problems, it does not meet Grade A requirements, and then must be labelled as &quot;processing grade&quot; maple syrup and may not be sold in containers smaller than . If maple syrup does not meet the requirements of processing-grade maple syrup (including a fairly characteristic maple taste), it is classified as substandard.

This grading system was accepted and made law by most maple-producing states and provinces, and became compulsory in Canada as of 13 December 2016. Vermont, in an effort to &quot;jump-start&quot; the new grading regulations, adopted the new grading system as of 1 January 2014, after the grade changes passed the US Senate and House in 2013. Maine passed a bill to take effect as soon as both Canada and the United States adopted the new grades. In New York, the new grade changes became law on 1 January 2015. New Hampshire did not require legislative approval and so the new grade laws became effective as of 16 December 2014, and producer compliance was required as of 1 January 2016.

Golden and amber grades typically have a milder flavour than dark and very dark, which are both dark and have an intense maple flavour. The darker grades of syrup are used primarily for cooking and baking, although some specialty dark syrups are produced for table use. Syrup harvested earlier in the season tends to yield a lighter colour. With the new grading system, the classification of maple syrup depends ultimately on its internal transmittance at 560 nm wavelength through a 10 mm sample. Golden must have 75 per cent or more transmittance, amber must have 50.0 to 74.9 per cent transmittance, dark must have 25.0 to 49.9 per cent transmittance, and very dark is any product having less than 25.0 per cent transmittance.

=== Old grading system ===
In Canada, maple syrup was classified prior to 31 December 2014 by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) as one of three grades, each with several colour classes:
*Canada No. 1, including 
**Extra light
**Light
**Medium
*No. 2 amber
*No. 3 dark or any other ungraded category

Producers in Ontario or Quebec may have followed either federal or provincial grading guidelines. Quebec&#x27;s and Ontario&#x27;s guidelines differed slightly from the federal:

*there were two &quot;number&quot; categories in Quebec
**Number 1, with four colour classes
**Number 2, with five colour classes 
*As in Quebec, Ontario&#x27;s producers had two &quot;number&quot; grades: 
**Number 1, with three colour classes
**Number 2, with one colour class, which was typically referred to as &quot;Ontario Amber&quot; when produced and sold in that province only

A typical year&#x27;s yield for a maple syrup producer will be about 25 to 30 per cent of each of the #1 colours, 10 per cent #2 amber, and 2 per cent #3 dark.

The United States used different grading standards ⁠— ⁠some states still do as they await state regulation. Maple syrup was divided into two major grades: 
*Grade A:
**Light amber (sometimes known as fancy)
**Medium amber
**Dark amber
*Grade B.

In Massachusetts, the Grade B was renamed &quot;Grade A Very Dark, Strong Taste&quot;

The Vermont Agency of Agriculture Food and Markets used a similar grading system of colour, and is roughly equivalent, especially for lighter syrups, but using letters: &quot;AA&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, etc. The Vermont grading system differed from the US system in maintaining a slightly higher standard of product density (measured on the Baumé scale). New Hampshire maintained a similar standard, but not a separate state grading scale. The Vermont-graded product had 0.9 per cent more sugar and less water in its composition than US-graded. One grade of syrup not for table use, called commercial or Grade C, was also produced under the Vermont system.

== Packing regulations ==
In Canada, the packing of maple syrup must follow the &quot;Packing&quot; conditions stated in the maple products regulations, or utilize the equivalent Canadian or imported grading system.

As stated in the maple products regulations, Canadian maple syrup can be classified as &quot;Canadian Grade A&quot; and &quot;Canadian Processing Grade&quot;. Any maple syrup container under these classifications should be filled to at least 90% of the bottle size while still containing the net quantity of syrup product as stated on the label. Every container of maple syrup must be new if it has a capacity of 5 litres or less or is marked with a grade name. Every container of maple sugar must also be new if it has a capacity of less than 5 kg or is either exported out of Canada or conveyed from one province to another.

Each maple syrup product must be verified clean if it follows a grade name or if it is exported out of the province in which it was originally manufactured.

== Nutrition ==
The basic ingredient in maple syrup is the sap from the xylem of sugar maple or various other species of maple trees. It consists primarily of sucrose and water, with small amounts of the monosaccharides glucose and fructose from the inverted sugar created in the boiling process.

In a 100g amount, maple syrup provides 260 calories and is composed of 32 per cent water by weight, 67 per cent carbohydrates (90 per cent of which are sugars), and no appreciable protein or fat (table). Maple syrup is generally low in overall micronutrient content, although manganese and riboflavin are at high levels along with moderate amounts of zinc and calcium (right table). It also contains trace amounts of amino acids which increase in content as sap flow occurs.

Maple syrup contains a wide variety of polyphenols and volatile organic compounds, including vanillin, hydroxybutanone, lignans, propionaldehyde, and numerous organic acids. It is not yet known exactly all compounds responsible for the distinctive flavour of maple syrup, although primary flavour-contributing compounds are maple furanone (5-ethyl-3-hydroxy-4-methyl-2(5H)-furanone), strawberry furanone, and maltol. New compounds have been identified in maple syrup, one of which is quebecol, a natural phenolic compound created when the maple sap is boiled to create syrup. Its sweetness derives from a high content of sucrose (99% of total sugars). Its brown colour – a significant factor in the appeal and quality grading of maple syrup – develops during thermal evaporation.

One author described maple syrup as &quot;a unique ingredient, smooth- and silky-textured, with a sweet, distinctive flavour – hints of caramel with overtones of toffee will not do – and a rare colour, amber set alight. Maple flavour is, well, maple flavour, uniquely different from any other.&quot; Agriculture Canada has developed a &quot;flavour wheel&quot; that details 91 unique flavours that can be present in maple syrup. These flavours are divided into 13 families: vanilla, burnt, milky, fruity, floral, spicy, foreign (deterioration or fermentation), foreign (environment), maple, confectionery, plant (herbaceous), plant (forest, humus or cereals), and plant (ligneous). These flavours are evaluated using a procedure similar to wine tasting. Other culinary experts praise its unique flavour. Environmental factors, including weather and soil type, impact flavor.

Maple syrup and its various artificial imitations are widely used as toppings for pancakes, waffles, and French toast in North America. They can also be used to flavour a variety of foods, including fritters, ice cream, hot cereal, fresh fruit, bacon, and sausages. It is also used as sweetener for granola, applesauce, baked beans, candied sweet potatoes, winter squash, cakes, pies, breads, tea, coffee, and hot toddies.

== Imitations ==
In Canada, maple syrup must be made entirely from maple sap, and syrup must have a density of 66° on the Brix scale to be marketed as maple syrup. In the United States, maple syrup must be made almost entirely from maple sap, although small amounts of substances such as salt may be added. Labelling laws prohibit imitation syrups from having &quot;maple&quot; in their names unless the finished product contains 10 per cent or more of natural maple syrup.

Table syrup, also known as pancake syrup and waffle syrup, is often used as a substitute for maple syrup. Table syrups are mostly made using corn syrup and high-fructose corn syrup, giving them a less complex and more artificial flavour compared to maple syrup. In the United States, consumers generally prefer imitation syrups, likely because of the significantly lower cost and sweeter flavour; they typically cost about , whereas authentic maple syrup costs as of 2015.

In 2016, maple syrup producers from nine US states petitioned the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to regulate labelling of products containing maple syrup or using the word &quot;maple&quot; in manufactured products, indicating that imitation maple products contained insignificant amounts of natural maple syrup. In September 2016, the FDA published a consumer advisory to carefully inspect the ingredient list of products labelled as &quot;maple&quot;.

== Cultural significance ==
Maple products are considered emblematic of Canada, and are frequently sold in tourist shops and airports as souvenirs from Canada. The sugar maple&#x27;s leaf has come to symbolize Canada, and is depicted on the country&#x27;s flag. Several US states, including West Virginia, New York, Vermont, and Wisconsin, have the sugar maple as their state tree. A scene of sap collection is depicted on the Vermont state quarter, issued in 2001.

Maple syrup and maple sugar were used during the American Civil War and by abolitionists in the years before the war because most cane sugar and molasses were produced by Southern slaves. Because of food rationing during the Second World War, people in the northeastern United States were encouraged to stretch their sugar rations by sweetening foods with maple syrup and maple sugar, and recipe books were printed to help housewives employ this alternative source.
