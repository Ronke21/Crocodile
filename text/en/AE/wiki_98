<text>Francis Petrarch (; 20 July 1304 – 19 July 1374; ; modern ), born Francesco di Petracco, was a scholar from Arezzo and poet of the early Italian Renaissance and one of the earliest humanists.

Petrarch&#x27;s rediscovery of Cicero&#x27;s letters is often credited with initiating the 14th-century Italian Renaissance and the founding of Renaissance humanism. In the 16th century, Pietro Bembo created the model for the modern Italian language based on Petrarch&#x27;s works, as well as those of Giovanni Boccaccio, and, to a lesser extent, Dante Alighieri. Petrarch was later endorsed as a model for Italian style by the .

Petrarch&#x27;s sonnets were admired and imitated throughout Europe during the Renaissance and became a model for lyrical poetry. He is also known for being the first to develop the concept of the &quot;Dark Ages&quot;.

==Biography==

===Youth and early career===
Petrarch was born in the Tuscan city Arezzo on 20 July 1304. He was the son of Ser Petracco (a diminutive nickname for &quot;Pietro&quot;) and his wife Eletta Canigiani. Petrarch&#x27;s birth name was &quot;Francesco di Petracco&quot; (&quot;Francesco [son] of Petracco&quot;), which he Latinized to &quot;Franciscus Petrarcha&quot;. His younger brother Gherardo (Gerard Petrarch) was born in Incisa in Val d&#x27;Arno in 1307. Dante Alighieri was a friend of his father.

Petrarch spent his early childhood in the village of Incisa, near Florence. He spent much of his early life at Avignon and nearby Carpentras, where his family moved to follow Pope Clement V, who moved there in 1309 to begin the Avignon Papacy. Petrarch studied law at the University of Montpellier (1316–20) and Bologna (1320–23) with a lifelong friend and schoolmate, Guido Sette, future archbishop of Genoa. Because his father was in the legal profession (a notary), he insisted that Petrarch and his brother also study law. Petrarch, however, was primarily interested in writing and studying Latin literature and considered these seven years wasted. Petrarch became so distracted by his non-legal interests that his father once threw his books into a fire, which he later lamented. Additionally, he proclaimed that through legal manipulation his guardians robbed him of his small property inheritance in Florence, which only reinforced his dislike for the legal system. He protested, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t face making a merchandise of my mind&quot;, since he viewed the legal system as the art of selling justice.

Petrarch was a prolific letter writer and counted Boccaccio among the notable friends with whom he regularly corresponded. After the death of their parents, Petrarch and his brother Gherardo went back to Avignon in 1326, where he worked in numerous clerical offices. This work gave him much time to devote to his writing. With his first large-scale work, &quot;Africa&quot;, an epic poem in Latin about the great Roman general Scipio Africanus, Petrarch emerged as a European celebrity. On 8 April 1341, he became the second poet laureate since classical antiquity and was crowned by Roman &quot;Senatori&quot; Giordano Orsini and Orso dell&#x27;Anguillara on the holy grounds of Rome&#x27;s Capitol.

He traveled widely in Europe, served as an ambassador, and has been called &quot;the first tourist&quot; because he traveled for pleasure such as his ascent of Mont Ventoux. During his travels, he collected crumbling Latin manuscripts and was a prime mover in the recovery of knowledge from writers of Rome and Greece. He encouraged and advised Leontius Pilatus&#x27;s translation of Homer from a manuscript purchased by Boccaccio, although he was severely critical of the result. Petrarch had acquired a copy, which he did not entrust to Leontius, but he knew no Greek; Petrarch said of himself, &quot;Homer was dumb to him, while he was deaf to Homer&quot;. In 1345 he personally discovered a collection of Cicero&#x27;s letters not previously known to have existed, the collection &quot;Epistulae ad Atticum&quot;, in the Chapter Library (&quot;Biblioteca Capitolare&quot;) of Verona Cathedral.

Disdaining what he believed to be the ignorance of the era in which he lived, Petrarch is credited with creating the concept of a historical &quot;Dark Ages&quot;, which most modern scholars now find inaccurate and misleading.

===Mount Ventoux===
Petrarch recounts that on 26 April 1336, with his brother and two servants, he climbed to the top of Mont Ventoux (, a feat which he undertook for recreation rather than necessity. The exploit is described in a famous letter addressed to his friend and confessor, the monk Dionigi di Borgo San Sepolcro, composed some time after the fact. In it, Petrarch claimed to have been inspired by Philip V of Macedon&#x27;s ascent of Mount Haemo and that an aged peasant had told him that nobody had ascended Ventoux before or after himself, 50 years earlier, and warned him against attempting to do so. The nineteenth-century Swiss historian Jacob Burckhardt noted that Jean Buridan had climbed the same mountain a few years before, and ascents accomplished during the Middle Ages have been recorded, including that of Anno II, Archbishop of Cologne.

Scholars note that Petrarch&#x27;s letter to Dionigi displays a strikingly &quot;modern&quot; attitude of aesthetic gratification in the grandeur of the scenery and is still often cited in books and journals devoted to the sport of mountaineering. In Petrarch, this attitude is coupled with an aspiration for a virtuous Christian life, and on reaching the summit, he took from his pocket a volume by his beloved mentor, Saint Augustine, that he always carried with him.

For pleasure alone he climbed Mont Ventoux, which rises to more than six thousand feet, beyond Vaucluse. It was no great feat, of course; but he was the first recorded Alpinist of modern times, the first to climb a mountain merely for the delight of looking from its top. (Or almost the first; for in a high pasture he met an old shepherd, who said that fifty years before he had attained the summit, and had got nothing from it save toil and repentance and torn clothing.) Petrarch was dazed and stirred by the view of the Alps, the mountains around Lyons, the Rhone, the Bay of Marseilles. He took Augustine&#x27;s &quot;Confessions&quot; from his pocket and reflected that his climb was merely an allegory of aspiration toward a better life.
As the book fell open, Petrarch&#x27;s eyes were immediately drawn to the following words:
Petrarch&#x27;s response was to turn from the outer world of nature to the inner world of &quot;soul&quot;:

James Hillman argues that this rediscovery of the inner world is the real significance of the Ventoux event. The Renaissance begins not with the ascent of Mont Ventoux but with the subsequent descent—the &quot;return [...] to the valley of soul&quot;, as Hillman puts it.

===Later years===
Petrarch spent the later part of his life journeying through northern Italy and southern France as an international scholar and poet-diplomat. His career in the Church did not allow him to marry, but he is believed to have fathered two children by a woman (or women) unknown to posterity. A son, Giovanni, was born in 1337, and a daughter, Francesca, was born in 1343. He later legitimized both.

For a number of years in the 1340s and 1350s he lived in a small house at Fontaine-de-Vaucluse east of Avignon in France.
Giovanni died of the plague in 1361. In the same year Petrarch was named canon in Monselice near Padua. Francesca married Francescuolo da Brossano (who was later named executor of Petrarch&#x27;s will) that same year. In 1362, shortly after the birth of a daughter, Eletta (the same name as Petrarch&#x27;s mother), they joined Petrarch in Venice to flee the plague then ravaging parts of Europe. A second grandchild, Francesco, was born in 1366, but died before his second birthday. Francesca and her family lived with Petrarch in Venice for five years from 1362 to 1367 at Palazzo Molina; although Petrarch continued to travel in those years. Between 1361 and 1369 the younger Boccaccio paid the older Petrarch two visits. The first was in Venice, the second was in Padua.

About 1368 Petrarch and Francesca (with her family) moved to the small town of Arquà in the Euganean Hills near Padua, where he passed his remaining years in religious contemplation. He died in his house in Arquà on 18/19 July 1374. The house now hosts a permanent exhibition of Petrarch&#x27;s works and curiosities, including the famous tomb of an embalmed cat long believed to be Petrarch&#x27;s (although there is no evidence Petrarch actually had a cat). On the marble slab, there is a Latin inscription written by Antonio Quarenghi:
Petrarch&#x27;s will (dated 4 April 1370) leaves fifty florins to Boccaccio &quot;to buy a warm winter dressing gown&quot;; various legacies (a horse, a silver cup, a lute, a Madonna) to his brother and his friends; his house in Vaucluse to its caretaker; money for Masses offered for his soul, and money for the poor; and the bulk of his estate to his son-in-law, Francescuolo da Brossano, who is to give half of it to &quot;the person to whom, as he knows, I wish it to go&quot;; presumably his daughter, Francesca, Brossano&#x27;s wife. The will mentions neither the property in Arquà nor his library; Petrarch&#x27;s library of notable manuscripts was already promised to Venice, in exchange for the Palazzo Molina. This arrangement was probably cancelled when he moved to Padua, the enemy of Venice, in 1368. The library was seized by the da Carrara lords of Padua, and his books and manuscripts are now widely scattered over Europe. Nevertheless, the Biblioteca Marciana traditionally claimed this bequest as its founding, although it was in fact founded by Cardinal Bessarion in 1468.

==Works==


Petrarch is best known for his Italian poetry, notably the &quot;Rerum vulgarium fragmenta&quot; (&quot;Fragments of Vernacular Matters&quot;), a collection of 366 lyric poems in various genres also known as &#x27;canzoniere&#x27; (&#x27;songbook&#x27;), and &quot;I trionfi&quot; (&quot;The Triumphs&quot;), a six-part narrative poem of Dantean inspiration. However, Petrarch was an enthusiastic Latin scholar and did most of his writing in this language. His Latin writings include scholarly works, introspective essays, letters, and more poetry. Among them are &quot;Secretum&quot; (&quot;My Secret Book&quot;), an intensely personal, imaginary dialogue with a figure inspired by Augustine of Hippo; &quot;De Viris Illustribus&quot; (&quot;On Famous Men&quot;), a series of moral biographies; &quot;Rerum Memorandarum Libri&quot;, an incomplete treatise on the cardinal virtues; &quot;De Otio Religiosorum&quot; (&quot;On Religious Leisure&quot;) and &quot;De vita solitaria&quot; (&quot;On the Solitary Life&quot;), which praise the contemplative life; &quot;De Remediis Utriusque Fortunae&quot; (&quot;Remedies for Fortune Fair and Foul&quot;), a self-help book which remained popular for hundreds of years; &quot;Itinerarium&quot; (&quot;Petrarch&#x27;s Guide to the Holy Land&quot;); invectives against opponents such as doctors, scholastics, and the French; the &quot;Carmen Bucolicum&quot;, a collection of 12 pastoral poems; and the unfinished epic &quot;Africa&quot;. He translated seven psalms, a collection known as the &quot;Penitential Psalms&quot;.

Petrarch also published many volumes of his letters, including a few written to long-dead figures from history such as Cicero and Virgil. Cicero, Virgil, and Seneca were his literary models. Most of his Latin writings are difficult to find today, but several of his works are available in English translations. Several of his Latin works are scheduled to appear in the Harvard University Press series &quot;I Tatti&quot;. It is difficult to assign any precise dates to his writings because he tended to revise them throughout his life.

Petrarch collected his letters into four major sets of books called 
* &quot;Familiares&quot; or &quot;Rerum familiarum liber&quot; (&quot;Letters on Familiar Matters&quot;) 
* &quot;Liber sine nomine&quot;
* &quot;Disperse&quot; 
* &quot;Seniles&quot; (&quot;Letters of Old Age&quot;) and 
* &quot;Metricae&quot;
The first and the fourth are available in English translation. The plan for his letters was suggested to him by knowledge of Cicero&#x27;s letters. These were published &quot;without names&quot; to protect the recipients, all of whom had close relationships to Petrarch. The recipients of these letters included Philippe de Cabassoles, bishop of Cavaillon; Ildebrandino Conti, bishop of Padua; Cola di Rienzo, tribune of Rome; Francesco Nelli, priest of the Prior of the Church of the Holy Apostles in Florence; and Niccolò di Capoccia, a cardinal and priest of Saint Vitalis. His &quot;Letter to Posterity&quot; (the last letter in &quot;Seniles&quot;) gives an autobiography and a synopsis of his philosophy in life. It was originally written in Latin and was completed in 1371 or 1372—the first such autobiography in a thousand years (since Saint Augustine).

While Petrarch&#x27;s poetry was set to music frequently after his death, especially by Italian madrigal composers of the Renaissance in the 16th century, only one musical setting composed during Petrarch&#x27;s lifetime survives. This is &quot;Non al suo amante&quot; by Jacopo da Bologna, written around 1350.

===Laura and poetry===

On 6 April 1327, after Petrarch gave up his vocation as a priest, the sight of a woman called &quot;Laura&quot; in the church of Sainte-Claire d&#x27;Avignon awoke in him a lasting passion, celebrated in the &quot;Rerum vulgarium fragmenta&quot; (&quot;Fragments of Vernacular Matters&quot;). Laura may have been Laura de Noves, the wife of Count Hugues de Sade (an ancestor of the Marquis de Sade). There is little definite information in Petrarch&#x27;s work concerning Laura, except that she is lovely to look at, fair-haired, with a modest, dignified bearing. Laura and Petrarch had little or no personal contact. According to his &quot;Secretum&quot;, she refused him because she was already married. He channeled his feelings into love poems that were exclamatory rather than persuasive, and wrote prose that showed his contempt for men who pursue women. Upon her death in 1348, the poet found that his grief was as difficult to live with as was his former despair. Later, in his &quot;Letter to Posterity&quot;, Petrarch wrote: &quot;In my younger days I struggled constantly with an overwhelming but pure love affair—my only one, and I would have struggled with it longer had not premature death, bitter but salutary for me, extinguished the cooling flames. I certainly wish I could say that I have always been entirely free from desires of the flesh, but I would be lying if I did&quot;.
While it is possible she was an idealized or pseudonymous character—particularly since the name &quot;Laura&quot; has a linguistic connection to the poetic &quot;laurels&quot; Petrarch coveted—Petrarch himself always denied it. His frequent use of &quot;l&#x27;aura&quot; is also remarkable: for example, the line &quot;Erano i capei d&#x27;oro a &quot;l&#x27;aura&quot; sparsi&quot; may mean both &quot;her hair was all over Laura&#x27;s body&quot; and &quot;the wind (&quot;l&#x27;aura&quot;) blew through her hair&quot;. There is psychological realism in the description of Laura, although Petrarch draws heavily on conventionalised descriptions of love and lovers from troubadour songs and other literature of courtly love. Her presence causes him unspeakable joy, but his unrequited love creates unendurable desires, inner conflicts between the ardent lover and the mystic Christian, making it impossible to reconcile the two. Petrarch&#x27;s quest for love leads to hopelessness and irreconcilable anguish, as he expresses in the series of paradoxes in Rima 134 &quot;Pace non trovo, et non ò da far guerra;/e temo, et spero; et ardo, et son un ghiaccio&quot;: &quot;I find no peace, and yet I make no war:/and fear, and hope: and burn, and I am ice&quot;.

Laura is unreachable and evanescent – descriptions of her are evocative yet fragmentary. Francesco de Sanctis praises the powerful music of his verse in his &quot;Storia della letteratura italiana&quot;. Gianfranco Contini, in a famous essay (&quot;Preliminari sulla lingua del Petrarca&quot;. Petrarca, Canzoniere. Turin, Einaudi, 1964), has described Petrarch&#x27;s language in terms of &quot;unilinguismo&quot; (contrasted with Dantean &quot;plurilinguismo&quot;).

=== Sonnet 227 ===
==Dante==

Petrarch is very different from Dante and his &quot;Divina Commedia&quot;. In spite of the metaphysical subject, the &quot;Commedia&quot; is deeply rooted in the cultural and social milieu of turn-of-the-century Florence: Dante&#x27;s rise to power (1300) and exile (1302); his political passions call for a &quot;violent&quot; use of language, where he uses all the registers, from low and trivial to sublime and philosophical. Petrarch confessed to Boccaccio that he had never read the &quot;Commedia&quot;, remarks Contini, wondering whether this was true or Petrarch wanted to distance himself from Dante. Dante&#x27;s language evolves as he grows old, from the courtly love of his early stilnovistic &quot;Rime&quot; and &quot;Vita nuova&quot; to the &quot;Convivio&quot; and &quot;Divina Commedia&quot;, where Beatrice is sanctified as the goddess of philosophy—the philosophy announced by the Donna Gentile at the death of Beatrice.

In contrast, Petrarch&#x27;s thought and style are relatively uniform throughout his life—he spent much of it revising the songs and sonnets of the &quot;Canzoniere&quot; rather than moving to new subjects or poetry. Here, poetry alone provides a consolation for personal grief, much less philosophy or politics (as in Dante), for Petrarch fights within himself (sensuality versus mysticism, profane versus Christian literature), not against anything outside of himself. The strong moral and political convictions which had inspired Dante belong to the Middle Ages and the libertarian spirit of the commune; Petrarch&#x27;s moral dilemmas, his refusal to take a stand in politics, his reclusive life point to a different direction, or time. The free commune, the place that had made Dante an eminent politician and scholar, was being dismantled: the &quot;signoria&quot; was taking its place. Humanism and its spirit of empirical inquiry, however, were making progress—but the papacy (especially after Avignon) and the empire (Henry VII, the last hope of the white Guelphs, died near Siena in 1313) had lost much of their original prestige.

Petrarch polished and perfected the sonnet form inherited from Giacomo da Lentini and which Dante widely used in his &quot;Vita nuova&quot; to popularise the new courtly love of the &quot;Dolce Stil Novo&quot;. The tercet benefits from Dante&#x27;s terza rima (compare the &quot;Divina Commedia&quot;), the quatrains prefer the ABBA–ABBA to the ABAB–ABAB scheme of the Sicilians. The imperfect rhymes of &quot;u&quot; with closed &quot;o&quot; and &quot;i&quot; with closed &quot;e&quot; (inherited from Guittone&#x27;s mistaken rendering of Sicilian verse) are excluded, but the rhyme of open and closed &quot;o&quot; is kept. Finally, Petrarch&#x27;s enjambment creates longer semantic units by connecting one line to the following. The vast majority (317) of Petrarch&#x27;s 366 poems collected in the &quot;Canzoniere&quot; (dedicated to Laura) were &quot;sonnets&quot;, and the Petrarchan sonnet still bears his name.

==Philosophy==
Petrarch is often referred to as the father of humanism and considered by many to be the &quot;father of the Renaissance&quot;. In &quot;Secretum meum&quot;, he points out that secular achievements do not necessarily preclude an authentic relationship with God, arguing instead that God has given humans their vast intellectual and creative potential to be used to its fullest. He inspired humanist philosophy, which led to the intellectual flowering of the Renaissance. He believed in the immense moral and practical value of the study of ancient history and literaturethat is, the study of human thought and action. Petrarch was a devout Catholic and did not see a conflict between realizing humanity&#x27;s potential and having religious faith, although many philosophers and scholars have styled him a Proto-Protestant who challenged the Pope&#x27;s dogma.

A highly introspective man, Petrarch helped shape the nascent humanist movement as many of the internal conflicts and musings expressed in his writings were embraced by Renaissance humanist philosophers and argued continually for the next 200 years. For example, he struggled with the proper relation between the active and contemplative life, and tended to emphasize the importance of solitude and study. In a clear disagreement with Dante, in 1346 Petrarch argued in &quot;De vita solitaria&quot; that Pope Celestine V&#x27;s refusal of the papacy in 1294 was a virtuous example of solitary life. Later the politician and thinker Leonardo Bruni (1370–1444) argued for the active life, or &quot;civic humanism&quot;. As a result, a number of political, military, and religious leaders during the Renaissance were inculcated with the notion that their pursuit of personal fulfillment should be grounded in classical example and philosophical contemplation.

== Petrarchism ==
Petrarchism was a 16th-century literary movement of Petrarch&#x27;s style by Italian, French, Spanish and English followers (partially coincident with Mannerism), who regarded his collection of poetry &quot;Il Canzoniere&quot; as a canonical text. Among them, the names are listed in order of precedence: Pietro Bembo, Michelangelo, Mellin de Saint-Gelais, Vittoria Colonna, Clément Marot, Garcilaso de la Vega, Giovanni della Casa, Thomas Wyatt, Henry Howard, Joachim du Bellay, Edmund Spenser, and Philip Sidney. Thus, in Pietro Bembo&#x27;s book &quot;Prose of the Vernacular Tongue&quot; (1525) Petrarch is the model of verse composition.

==Legacy==

Petrarch&#x27;s influence is evident in the works of Serafino Ciminelli from Aquila (1466–1500) and in the works of Marin Držić (1508–1567) from Dubrovnik.

The Romantic composer Franz Liszt set three of Petrarch&#x27;s Sonnets (47, 104, and 123) to music for voice, &quot;Tre sonetti del Petrarca&quot;, which he later would transcribe for solo piano for inclusion in the suite &quot;Années de Pèlerinage&quot;. Liszt also set a poem by Victor Hugo, &quot;Oh! quand je dors&quot; in which Petrarch and Laura are invoked as the epitome of erotic love.

While in Avignon in 1991, Modernist composer Elliott Carter completed his solo flute piece &quot;Scrivo in Vento&quot; which is in part inspired by and structured by Petrarch&#x27;s Sonnet 212, &quot;Beato in sogno&quot;. It was premiered on Petrarch&#x27;s 687th birthday. In 2004, Finnish composer Kaija Saariaho crafted a miniature for solo piccolo flute titled &quot;Dolce tormento&quot;, in which the flutist whispers fragments of Petrarch&#x27;s Sonnet 132 into the instrument.

In November 2003, it was announced that pathological anatomists would be exhuming Petrarch&#x27;s body from his casket in Arquà Petrarca, to verify 19th-century reports that he had stood 1.83 meters (about six feet), which would have been tall for his period. The team from the University of Padua also hoped to reconstruct his cranium to generate a computerized image of his features to coincide with his 700th birthday. The tomb had been opened previously in 1873 by Professor Giovanni Canestrini, also of Padua University. When the tomb was opened, the skull was discovered in fragments and a DNA test revealed that the skull was not Petrarch&#x27;s, prompting calls for the return of Petrarch&#x27;s skull.

The researchers are fairly certain that the body in the tomb is Petrarch&#x27;s due to the fact that the skeleton bears evidence of injuries mentioned by Petrarch in his writings, including a kick from a donkey when he was 42.

=== Numismatics ===

He is credited with being the first and most famous aficionado of numismatics. He described visiting Rome and asking peasants to bring him ancient coins they would find in the soil which he would buy from them, and writes of his delight at being able to identify the names and features of Roman emperors.

<text>A propeller (often called a screw if on a ship or an airscrew if on an aircraft) is a device with a rotating hub and radiating blades that are set at a pitch to form a helical spiral which, when rotated, exerts linear thrust upon a working fluid such as water or air. Propellers are used to pump fluid through a pipe or duct, or to create thrust to propel a boat through water or an aircraft through air. The blades are shaped so that their rotational motion through the fluid causes a pressure difference between the two surfaces of the blade by Bernoulli&#x27;s principle which exerts force on the fluid. Most marine propellers are screw propellers with helical blades rotating on a propeller shaft with an approximately horizontal axis.

==History==
===Early developments===
The principle employed in using a screw propeller is derived from stern sculling. In sculling, a single blade is moved through an arc, from side to side taking care to keep presenting the blade to the water at the effective angle. The innovation introduced with the screw propeller was the extension of that arc through more than 360° by attaching the blade to a rotating shaft. Propellers can have a single blade, but in practice there is nearly always more than one so as to balance the forces involved.
The origin of the screw propeller starts at least as early as Archimedes (c. 287 – c. 212 BC), who used a screw to lift water for irrigation and bailing boats, so famously that it became known as Archimedes&#x27; screw. It was probably an application of spiral movement in space (spirals were a special study of Archimedes) to a hollow segmented water-wheel used for irrigation by Egyptians for centuries. A flying toy, the bamboo-copter, was enjoyed in China beginning around 320 AD. Later, Leonardo da Vinci adopted the screw principle to drive his theoretical helicopter, sketches of which involved a large canvas screw overhead.

In 1661, Toogood and Hays proposed using screws for waterjet propulsion, though not as a propeller. Robert Hooke in 1681 designed a horizontal watermill which was remarkably similar to the Kirsten-Boeing vertical axis propeller designed almost two and a half centuries later in 1928; two years later Hooke modified the design to provide motive power for ships through water. In 1693 a Frenchman by the name of Du Quet invented a screw propeller which was tried in 1693 but later abandoned. In 1752, the &quot;Academie des Sciences&quot; in Paris granted Burnelli a prize for a design of a propeller-wheel. At about the same time, the French mathematician Alexis-Jean-Pierre Paucton suggested a water propulsion system based on the Archimedean screw. In 1771, steam-engine inventor James Watt in a private letter suggested using &quot;spiral oars&quot; to propel boats, although he did not use them with his steam engines, or ever implement the idea.

One of the first practical and applied uses of a propeller was on a submarine dubbed which was designed in New Haven, Connecticut, in 1775 by Yale student and inventor David Bushnell, with the help of clock maker, engraver, and brass foundryman Isaac Doolittle. Bushnell&#x27;s brother Ezra Bushnell and ship&#x27;s carpenter and clock maker Phineas Pratt constructed the hull in Saybrook, Connecticut. On the night of September 6, 1776, Sergeant Ezra Lee piloted &quot;Turtle&quot; in an attack on in New York Harbor. &quot;Turtle&quot; also has the distinction of being the first submarine used in battle. Bushnell later described the propeller in an October 1787 letter to Thomas Jefferson: &quot;An oar formed upon the principle of the screw was fixed in the forepart of the vessel its axis entered the vessel and being turned one way rowed the vessel forward but being turned the other way rowed it backward. It was made to be turned by the hand or foot.&quot; The brass propeller, like all the brass and moving parts on &quot;Turtle&quot;, was crafted by Issac Doolittle of New Haven.

In 1785, Joseph Bramah of England proposed a propeller solution of a rod going through the underwater aft of a boat attached to a bladed propeller, though he never built it.

In February 1800, Edward Shorter of London proposed using a similar propeller attached to a rod angled down temporarily deployed from the deck above the waterline and thus requiring no water seal, and intended only to assist becalmed sailing vessels. He tested it on the transport ship at Gibraltar and Malta, achieving a speed of .

In 1802, American lawyer and inventor John Stevens built a boat with a rotary steam engine coupled to a four-bladed propeller. The craft achieved a speed of , but Stevens abandoned propellers due to the inherent danger in using the high-pressure steam engines. His subsequent vessels were paddle-wheeled boats.

By 1827, Czech inventor Josef Ressel had invented a screw propeller with multiple blades on a conical base. He tested it in February 1826 on a manually-driven ship and successfully used it on a steamboat in 1829. His 48-ton ship &quot;Civetta&quot; reached 6 knots. This was the first successful Archimedes screw-propelled ship. His experiments were banned by police after a steam engine accident. Ressel, a forestry inspector, held an Austro-Hungarian patent for his propeller. The screw propeller was an improvement over paddlewheels as it wasn&#x27;t affected by ship motions or draft changes.

John Patch, a mariner in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia developed a two-bladed, fan-shaped propeller in 1832 and publicly demonstrated it in 1833, propelling a row boat across Yarmouth Harbour and a small coastal schooner at Saint John, New Brunswick, but his patent application in the United States was rejected until 1849 because he was not an American citizen. His efficient design drew praise in American scientific circles but by then he faced multiple competitors.

===Screw propellers===
Despite experimentation with screw propulsion before the 1830s, few of these inventions were pursued to the testing stage, and those that were proved unsatisfactory for one reason or another.

In 1835, two inventors in Britain, John Ericsson and Francis Pettit Smith, began working separately on the problem. Smith was first to take out a screw propeller patent on 31 May, while Ericsson, a gifted Swedish engineer then working in Britain, filed his patent six weeks later. Smith quickly built a small model boat to test his invention, which was demonstrated first on a pond at his Hendon farm, and later at the Royal Adelaide Gallery of Practical Science in London, where it was seen by the Secretary of the Navy, Sir William Barrow. Having secured the patronage of a London banker named Wright, Smith then built a , canal boat of six tons burthen called &quot;Francis Smith&quot;, which was fitted with his wooden propeller and demonstrated on the Paddington Canal from November 1836 to September 1837. By a fortuitous accident, the wooden propeller of two turns was damaged during a voyage in February 1837, and to Smith&#x27;s surprise the broken propeller, which now consisted of only a single turn, doubled the boat&#x27;s previous speed, from about four miles an hour to eight. Smith would subsequently file a revised patent in keeping with this accidental discovery.

In the meantime, Ericsson built a screw-propelled steamboat, &quot;Francis B. Ogden&quot; in 1837, and demonstrated his boat on the River Thames to senior members of the British Admiralty, including Surveyor of the Navy Sir William Symonds. In spite of the boat achieving a speed of 10 miles an hour, comparable with that of existing paddle steamers, Symonds and his entourage were unimpressed. The Admiralty maintained the view that screw propulsion would be ineffective in ocean-going service, while Symonds himself believed that screw propelled ships could not be steered efficiently. Following this rejection, Ericsson built a second, larger screw-propelled boat, &quot;Robert F. Stockton&quot;, and had her sailed in 1839 to the United States, where he was soon to gain fame as the designer of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s first screw-propelled warship, .
Apparently aware of the Royal Navy&#x27;s view that screw propellers would prove unsuitable for seagoing service, Smith determined to prove this assumption wrong. In September 1837, he took his small vessel (now fitted with an iron propeller of a single turn) to sea, steaming from Blackwall, London to Hythe, Kent, with stops at Ramsgate, Dover and Folkestone. On the way back to London on the 25th, Smith&#x27;s craft was observed making headway in stormy seas by officers of the Royal Navy. This revived Admiralty&#x27;s interest and Smith was encouraged to build a full size ship to more conclusively demonstrate the technology.
 was built in 1838 by Henry Wimshurst of London, as the world&#x27;s first steamship to be driven by a screw propeller.

The &quot;Archimedes&quot; had considerable influence on ship development, encouraging the adoption of screw propulsion by the Royal Navy, in addition to her influence on commercial vessels. Trials with Smith&#x27;s &quot;Archimedes&quot; led to a tug-of-war competition in 1845 between and with the screw-driven &quot;Rattler&quot; pulling the paddle steamer &quot;Alecto&quot; backward at .

The &quot;Archimedes&quot; also influenced the design of Isambard Kingdom Brunel&#x27;s in 1843, then the world&#x27;s largest ship and the first screw-propelled steamship to cross the Atlantic Ocean in August 1845.

 and were both heavily modified to become the first Royal Navy ships to have steam-powered engines and screw propellers. Both participated in Franklin&#x27;s lost expedition, last seen in July 1845 near Baffin Bay.

Screw propeller design stabilized in the 1880s.

=== Aircraft ===

The Wright brothers pioneered the twisted aerofoil shape of modern aircraft propellers. They realized an air propeller was similar to a wing. They verified this using wind tunnel experiments. They introduced a twist in their blades to keep the angle of attack constant. Their blades were only 5% less efficient than those used 100 years later. Understanding of low-speed propeller aerodynamics was complete by the 1920s, although increased power and smaller diameters added design constraints. 

Alberto Santos Dumont, another early pioneer, applied the knowledge he gained from experiences with airships to make a propeller with a steel shaft and aluminium blades for his 14 bis biplane. Some of his designs used a bent aluminium sheet for blades, thus creating an airfoil shape. They were heavily undercambered, and this plus the absence of lengthwise twist made them less efficient than the Wright propellers. Even so, this may have been the first use of aluminium in the construction of an airscrew.

==Theory==
In the nineteenth century, several theories concerning propellers were proposed. The momentum theory or disk actuator theory – a theory describing a mathematical model of an ideal propeller – was developed by W.J.M. Rankine (1865), A.G. Greenhill (1888) and R.E. Froude (1889). The propeller is modelled as an infinitely thin disc, inducing a constant velocity along the axis of rotation and creating a flow around the propeller.

A screw turning through a solid will have zero &quot;slip&quot;; but as a propeller screw operates in a fluid (either air or water), there will be some losses. The most efficient propellers are large-diameter, slow-turning screws, such as on large ships; the least efficient are small-diameter and fast-turning (such as on an outboard motor). Using Newton&#x27;s laws of motion, one may usefully think of a propeller&#x27;s forward thrust as being a reaction proportionate to the mass of fluid sent backward per time and the speed the propeller adds to that mass, and in practice there is more loss associated with producing a fast jet than with creating a heavier, slower jet. (The same applies in aircraft, in which larger-diameter turbofan engines tend to be more efficient than earlier, smaller-diameter turbofans, and even smaller turbojets, which eject less mass at greater speeds.)

===Propeller geometry===
The geometry of a marine screw propeller is based on a helicoidal surface. This may form the face of the blade, or the faces of the blades may be described by offsets from this surface. The back of the blade is described by offsets from the helicoid surface in the same way that an aerofoil may be described by offsets from the chord line. The pitch surface may be a true helicoid or one having a warp to provide a better match of angle of attack to the wake velocity over the blades. A warped helicoid is described by specifying the shape of the radial reference line and the pitch angle in terms of radial distance. The traditional propeller drawing includes four parts: a side elevation, which defines the rake, the variation of blade thickness from root to tip, a longitudinal section through the hub, and a projected outline of a blade onto a longitudinal centreline plane. The expanded blade view shows the section shapes at their various radii, with their pitch faces drawn parallel to the base line, and thickness parallel to the axis. The outline indicated by a line connecting the leading and trailing tips of the sections depicts the expanded blade outline. The pitch diagram shows variation of pitch with radius from root to tip. The transverse view shows the transverse projection of a blade and the developed outline of the blade.

The &quot;blades&quot; are the foil section plates that develop thrust when the propeller is rotated
The &quot;hub&quot; is the central part of the propeller, which connects the blades together and fixes the propeller to the shaft. This is called the &quot;boss&quot; in the UK.
&quot;Rake&quot; is the angle of the blade to a radius perpendicular to the shaft.
&quot;Skew&quot; is the tangential offset of the line of maximum thickness to a radius

The propeller characteristics are commonly expressed as dimensionless ratios:
* Pitch ratio &quot;PR&quot; = propeller pitch/propeller diameter, or P/D
* Disk area A0 = πD2/4
* Expanded area ratio = AE/A0, where expanded area AE = Expanded area of all blades outside of the hub.
* Developed area ratio = AD/A0, where developed area AD = Developed area of all blades outside of the hub
* Projected area ratio = AP/A0, where projected area AP = Projected area of all blades outside of the hub
* Mean width ratio = (Area of one blade outside the hub/length of the blade outside the hub)/Diameter
* Blade width ratio = Maximum width of a blade/Diameter
* Blade thickness fraction = Thickness of a blade produced to shaft axis/Diameter

===Cavitation===

Cavitation is the formation of vapor bubbles in water near a moving propeller blade in regions of very low pressure. It can occur if an attempt is made to transmit too much power through the screw, or if the propeller is operating at a very high speed. Cavitation can waste power, create vibration and wear, and cause damage to the propeller. It can occur in many ways on a propeller. The two most common types of propeller cavitation are suction side surface cavitation and tip vortex cavitation.

Suction side surface cavitation forms when the propeller is operating at high rotational speeds or under heavy load (high blade lift coefficient). The pressure on the upstream surface of the blade (the &quot;suction side&quot;) can drop below the vapor pressure of the water, resulting in the formation of a vapor pocket. Under such conditions, the change in pressure between the downstream surface of the blade (the &quot;pressure side&quot;) and the suction side is limited, and eventually reduced as the extent of cavitation is increased. When most of the blade surface is covered by cavitation, the pressure difference between the pressure side and suction side of the blade drops considerably, as does the thrust produced by the propeller. This condition is called &quot;thrust breakdown&quot;. Operating the propeller under these conditions wastes energy, generates considerable noise, and as the vapor bubbles collapse it rapidly erodes the screw&#x27;s surface due to localized shock waves against the blade surface. 

Tip vortex cavitation is caused by the extremely low pressures formed at the core of the tip vortex. The tip vortex is caused by fluid wrapping around the tip of the propeller; from the pressure side to the suction side. This video demonstrates tip vortex cavitation. Tip vortex cavitation typically occurs before suction side surface cavitation and is less damaging to the blade, since this type of cavitation doesn&#x27;t collapse on the blade, but some distance downstream.

==Types of propellers==

===Variable-pitch propeller===
Variable-pitch propellers may be either controllable (controllable-pitch propellers) or automatically feathering (folding propellers). Variable-pitch propellers have significant advantages over the fixed-pitch variety, namely:
* the ability to select the most effective blade angle for any given speed;
* when motorsailing, the ability to coarsen the blade angle to attain the optimum drive from wind and engines;
* the ability to move astern (in reverse) much more efficiently (fixed props perform very poorly in astern);
* the ability to &quot;feather&quot; the blades to give the least resistance when not in use (for example, when sailing). For large airplanes, if the engine is uncontrollable, the ability to feather the propeller is necessary to prevent the propeller from spinning so fast it breaks apart.

===Skewback propeller===
An advanced type of propeller used on the American Los Angeles-class submarine as well as the German Type 212 submarine is called a skewback propeller. As in the scimitar blades used on some aircraft, the blade tips of a skewback propeller are swept back against the direction of rotation. In addition, the blades are tilted rearward along the longitudinal axis, giving the propeller an overall cup-shaped appearance. This design preserves thrust efficiency while reducing cavitation, and thus makes for a quiet, stealthy design.

A small number of ships use propellers with winglets similar to those on some airplane wings, reducing tip vortices and improving efficiency.

===Modular propeller===
A modular propeller provides more control over the boat&#x27;s performance. There is no need to change an entire propeller when there is an opportunity to only change the pitch or the damaged blades. Being able to adjust pitch will allow for boaters to have better performance while in different altitudes, water sports, or cruising.

===Voith Schneider propeller===
Voith Schneider propellers use four untwisted straight blades turning around a vertical axis instead of helical blades and can provide thrust in any direction at any time, at the cost of higher mechanical complexity.

=== Shaftless ===

A rim-driven thruster integrates an electric motor into a ducted propeller. The cylindrical duct acts as the stator, while the tips of the blades act as the rotor. They typically provide high torque and operate at low RPMs, producing less noise. The system does not require a shaft, reducing weight. Units can be placed at various locations around the hull and operated independently, e.g., to aid in maneuvering. The absence of a shaft allows alternative rear hull designs.

=== Toroidal ===

Twisted-toroid (ring-shaped) propellers, first invented over 120 years ago, replace the blades with a-circular rings. They are significantly quieter (particularly at audible frequencies) and more efficient than traditional propellers for both air and water applications. The design distributes vortices generated by the propeller across the entire shape, causing them to dissipate faster in the atmosphere.

==Damage protection==
===Shaft protection===

For smaller engines, such as outboards, where the propeller is exposed to the risk of collision with heavy objects, the propeller often includes a device that is designed to fail when overloaded; the device or the whole propeller is sacrificed so that the more expensive transmission and engine are not damaged.

Typically in smaller (less than ) and older engines, a narrow shear pin through the drive shaft and propeller hub transmits the power of the engine at normal loads. The pin is designed to shear when the propeller is put under a load that could damage the engine. After the pin is sheared the engine is unable to provide propulsive power to the boat until a new shear pin is fitted.

In larger and more modern engines, a rubber bushing transmits the torque of the drive shaft to the propeller&#x27;s hub. Under a damaging load the friction of the bushing in the hub is overcome and the rotating propeller slips on the shaft, preventing overloading of the engine&#x27;s components. After such an event the rubber bushing may be damaged. If so, it may continue to transmit reduced power at low revolutions, but may provide no power, due to reduced friction, at high revolutions. Also, the rubber bushing may perish over time leading to its failure under loads below its designed failure load.

Whether a rubber bushing can be replaced or repaired depends upon the propeller; some cannot. Some can, but need special equipment to insert the oversized bushing for an interference fit. Others can be replaced easily. The &quot;special equipment&quot; usually consists of a funnel, a press and rubber lubricant (soap). If one does not have access to a lathe, an improvised funnel can be made from steel tube and car body filler; as the filler is only subject to compressive forces it is able to do a good job. Often, the bushing can be drawn into place with nothing more complex than a couple of nuts, washers and a threaded rod. A more serious problem with this type of propeller is a &quot;frozen-on&quot; spline bushing, which makes propeller removal impossible. In such cases the propeller must be heated in order to deliberately destroy the rubber insert. Once the propeller is removed, the splined tube can be cut away with a grinder and a new spline bushing is then required. To prevent a recurrence of the problem, the splines can be coated with anti-seize anti-corrosion compound.

In some modern propellers, a hard polymer insert called a &quot;drive sleeve&quot; replaces the rubber bushing. The splined or other non-circular cross section of the sleeve inserted between the shaft and propeller hub transmits the engine torque to the propeller, rather than friction. The polymer is weaker than the components of the propeller and engine so it fails before they do when the propeller is overloaded. This fails completely under excessive load, but can easily be replaced.

===Weed hatches and rope cutters===

Whereas the propeller on a large ship will be immersed in deep water and free of obstacles and flotsam, yachts, barges and river boats often suffer propeller fouling by debris such as weed, ropes, cables, nets and plastics. British narrowboats invariably have a weed hatch over the propeller, and once the narrowboat is stationary, the hatch may be opened to give access to the propeller, enabling debris to be cleared. Yachts and river boats rarely have weed hatches; instead they may fit a rope cutter that fits around the prop shaft and rotates with the propeller. These cutters clear the debris and obviate the need for divers to attend manually to the fouling. Several forms of rope cutters are available:
#A simple sharp edged disc that cuts like a razor;
#A rotor with two or more projecting blades that slice against a fixed blade, cutting with a scissor action;
#A serrated rotor with a complex cutting edge made up of sharp edges and projections.

==Propeller variations==

A cleaver is a type of propeller design especially used for boat racing. Its leading edge is formed round, while the trailing edge is cut straight. It provides little bow lift, so that it can be used on boats that do not need much bow lift, for instance hydroplanes, that naturally have enough hydrodynamic bow lift. To compensate for the lack of bow lift, a hydrofoil may be installed on the lower unit. Hydrofoils reduce bow lift and help to get a boat out of the hole and onto plane.

<doc id="23739" wikidata="Q65913" url="?curid=23739" title="Peter Duesberg">
<text>Peter Heinz Hermann Duesberg (born December 2, 1936) is a German-American molecular biologist and a professor of molecular and cell biology at the University of California, Berkeley. He is known for his early research into the genetic aspects of cancer. He is a proponent of AIDS denialism, the claim that HIV does not cause AIDS.

Duesberg received acclaim early in his career for research on oncogenes and cancer. With Peter K. Vogt, he reported in 1970 that a cancer-causing virus of birds had extra genetic material compared with non-cancer-causing viruses, hypothesizing that this material contributed to cancer. At the age of 36, Duesberg was awarded tenure at the University of California, Berkeley, and at 49, he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. He received an Outstanding Investigator Grant from the National Institutes of Health in 1986, and from 1986 to 1987 was a Fogarty scholar-in-residence at the NIH laboratories in Bethesda, Maryland.

Long considered a contrarian by his scientific colleagues, Duesberg began to gain public notoriety with a March 1987 article in &quot;Cancer Research&quot; entitled &quot;Retroviruses as Carcinogens and Pathogens: Expectations and Reality&quot;. In this and subsequent writings, Duesberg proposed his hypothesis that AIDS is caused by long-term consumption of recreational drugs or antiretroviral drugs, and that the retrovirus known as &#x27;HIV&#x27; is a harmless passenger virus. In contrast, the scientific consensus is that HIV infection causes AIDS; Duesberg&#x27;s HIV/AIDS claims have been addressed and rejected as erroneous by the scientific community. Reviews of his opinions in &quot;Nature&quot; and &quot;Science&quot; asserted that they were unpersuasive and based on selective reading of the literature, and that although Duesberg had a right to a dissenting opinion, his failure to fairly review evidence that HIV causes AIDS meant that his opinion lacked credibility.

Duesberg&#x27;s views are cited as major influences on South African HIV/AIDS policy under the administration of Thabo Mbeki, which embraced AIDS denialism. Duesberg served on an advisory panel to Mbeki convened in 2000. The Mbeki administration&#x27;s failure to provide antiretroviral drugs in a timely manner, due in part to the influence of AIDS denialism, is thought to be responsible for hundreds of thousands of preventable AIDS deaths and HIV infections in South Africa. Duesberg disputed these findings in an article in the journal &quot;Medical Hypotheses&quot;, but the journal&#x27;s publisher, Elsevier, later retracted Duesberg&#x27;s article over accuracy and ethics concerns as well as its rejection during peer review. The incident prompted several complaints to Duesberg&#x27;s institution, the University of California, Berkeley, which began a misconduct investigation of Duesberg in 2009. The investigation was dropped in 2010, with university officials finding &quot;insufficient evidence ... to support a recommendation for disciplinary action.&quot;

In 2021, Peter Duesberg had a stroke that left him with severe aphasia affecting speaking, reading, and writing, according to his partner.

==Early life==
Duesberg grew up during World War II, raised as a Catholic in Germany. He moved to the US in 1964 to work at the University of California, Berkeley, following completion of a Ph.D. in chemistry at the University of Frankfurt.

==Work==
===Cancer===
In the 1970s, Duesberg won international acclaim for his groundbreaking work on cancer. Duesberg&#x27;s early work on cancer included being the first to identify the oncogene &quot;v-src&quot; from the genome of Rous sarcoma virus, a chicken virus believed to trigger tumor growth. Duesberg disputes the importance of oncogenes and retroviruses in cancer. He supports the aneuploidy hypothesis of cancer that was first proposed in 1914 by Theodor Heinrich Boveri.

Despite having discovered an oncogene, Duesberg rejects the importance of mutations, oncogenes, and anti-oncogenes entirely. In 1998, Duesberg co-authored a paper reporting a correlation between chromosome number and the genetic instability of cancer cells, which they dubbed &quot;the ploidy factor,&quot; confirming earlier research by other groups that demonstrated an association between degree of aneuploidy and metastasis.

Although unwilling to concur with Duesberg in throwing out a role for cancer genes, many researchers support exploration of alternative hypotheses. In 2007, &quot;Scientific American&quot; published an article by Duesberg on his aneuploidy cancer theory. In an editorial explaining their decision to publish this article, the editors of &quot;Scientific American&quot; wrote: &quot;Thus, as wrong as Duesberg surely is about HIV, there is at least a chance that he is significantly right about cancer.&quot; 

A consequence of Duesberg&#x27;s aneuploidy theory of cancer is his opposition to the HPV vaccine (against the virus that causes genital warts), as the idea that a virus could cause most cases of cervical cancer is inconsistent with his claims about what causes cancer. Although Duesberg generally favors vaccination, he vehemently opposed the rollout of the HPV vaccine, saying the vaccine was &quot;all risk and no benefit&quot;.

===AIDS===
In his 1996 book, &quot;Inventing the AIDS Virus&quot;, published by Regnery Publishing, a politically conservative book publisher based in Washington, D.C., and in numerous journal articles and letters to the editor, Duesberg asserts that HIV is harmless and that recreational and pharmaceutical drug use, especially of zidovudine (AZT, a drug used in the treatment of AIDS) are the causes of AIDS outside Africa (the so-called Duesberg hypothesis). He considers AIDS diseases as markers for drug use, e.g., use of poppers (alkyl nitrites) among some homosexuals, asserting a correlation between AIDS and recreational drug use. This correlation hypothesis has been disproven by evidence showing that only HIV infection, not homosexuality or recreational/pharmaceutical drug use, predicts who will develop AIDS.

Duesberg asserts that AIDS in Africa is misdiagnosed and the epidemic a &quot;myth&quot;, claiming, unlike the WHO, that the diagnostic criteria for AIDS are different in Africa than elsewhere., and that the breakdown of the immune system in African AIDS patients can be explained exclusively by factors such as malnutrition, tainted drinking water, and various infections that he presumes are common to AIDS patients in Africa. Duesberg also argues that retroviruses like HIV must be harmless to survive, and that the normal mode of retroviral propagation is mother-to-child transmission by infection in utero.

Since Duesberg published his first paper on the subject in 1987, scientists have examined and criticized the accuracy of his hypotheses on AIDS causation. Duesberg entered a long dispute with John Maddox, then-editor of the scientific journal &quot;Nature&quot;, demanding the right to rebut articles that HIV caused AIDS. For several years Maddox consented to this demand but ultimately refused to continue to publish Duesberg&#x27;s criticisms:
A number of scientific criticisms of Duesberg&#x27;s hypothesis were summarized in a review article in the journal &quot;Science&quot; in 1994, which presented the results of a 3-month scientific investigation into some of Duesberg&#x27;s claims. In the &quot;Science&quot; article, science writer Jon Cohen interviewed both HIV researchers and AIDS denialists (including Duesberg himself) and examined the AIDS literature in addition to review articles written by Duesberg. The article said:
The article also said that Duesberg and the AIDS denialist movement have garnered support from some prominent scientists, including Nobel Prize winner Kary Mullis, while others are cited as &quot;equally, if not more, concerned about the treatment Duesberg has received at the hands of the establishment&quot;, rather than support of his specific claim that HIV does not cause AIDS. Duesberg has been described as &quot;the individual who has done the most damage&quot; regarding denialism, due to the apparent scientific legitimacy his scientific credentials give to his statements.

In a 2010 article on conspiracy theories in science, Ted Goertzel highlights Duesberg&#x27;s opposition to the HIV/AIDS connection as an example in which scientific findings are disputed on irrational grounds, relying on rhetoric, appeal to fairness and the right to a dissenting opinion rather than on evidence. Goertzel said that Duesberg, along with many other denialists frequently invoke the meme of a &quot;courageous independent scientist resisting orthodoxy&quot;, invoking the name of persecuted physicist and astronomer Galileo Galilei. Regarding this comparison, Goertzel wrote:
Duesberg&#x27;s advocacy of AIDS denialism has, by all accounts, effectively made him a pariah to the worldwide scientific community.

==Consequences of AIDS denialism==
In 2000, Duesberg was the most prominent AIDS denialist to sit on a 44-member Presidential Advisory Panel on HIV and AIDS convened by then-president Thabo Mbeki of South Africa. The panel was scheduled to meet concurrently with the 2000 International AIDS Conference in Durban and to convey the impression that Mbeki&#x27;s doubts about HIV/AIDS science were valid and actively discussed in the scientific community.

The views of the denialists on the panel, aired during the AIDS conference, received renewed attention. Mbeki later suffered substantial political fallout for his support for AIDS denialism and for opposing the treatment of pregnant HIV-positive South African women with antiretroviral medication. Mbeki partly attenuated his ties with denialists in 2002, asking them to stop associating their names with his.

In response to the inclusion of AIDS denialists on Mbeki&#x27;s panel, the Durban Declaration was drafted and signed by over 5,000 scientists and physicians, describing the evidence that HIV causes AIDS as &quot;clear-cut, exhaustive and unambiguous&quot;.

Two independent studies have concluded that the public health policies of Thabo Mbeki&#x27;s government, shaped in part by Duesberg&#x27;s writings and advice, were responsible for over 330,000 excess AIDS deaths and many preventable infections, including those of infants.

A 2008 feature story on Duesberg in &quot;Discover&quot; addresses Duesberg&#x27;s role in anti-HIV drug-preventable deaths in South Africa. Jeanne Lenzer interviews prominent HIV/AIDS expert Max Essex, who suggests that,
==Academic misconduct investigation==
In 2009, Duesberg and co-authors including David Rasnick published an article in &quot;Medical Hypotheses&quot;, an unconventionally peer reviewed journal. The article, &quot;HIV-AIDS hypothesis out of touch with South African AIDS – A new perspective&quot;, had been rejected previously by the journal &quot;JAIDS&quot;, and a peer reviewer had warned that the authors could face scientific misconduct charges if the paper were published.

The reviewers claimed that Duesberg and his co-authors cherry-picked data, cited favorable results while ignoring unfavorable results, and quoted statements out of context. The article was not revised in response to these criticisms. Moreover, the reviewers claim that Duesberg, though he included in the article that neither he nor his co-authors had financial conflicts of interest, &quot;[committed] a serious breach of professional ethics&quot; by failing to state a possible conflict of interest: That co-author Rasnick previously worked for Matthias Rath, a vitamin entrepreneur who sold vitamin pills as AIDS remedies.

In the article, Duesberg questioned research reporting that drug policies implemented by the South African government on the advice of Duesberg, Rasnick and others had led to excess AIDS deaths. Observing that the overall population of South Africa has increased, Duesberg claimed that HIV must be a harmless &quot;passenger virus&quot; that has not caused deaths in South Africa or elsewhere. Duesberg said that HIV does not replicate in the body and that antiviral drugs, which he calls &quot;inevitably toxic,&quot; do not inhibit HIV.

Scientists expressed concerns to Elsevier, the publisher of &quot;Medical Hypotheses&quot;, about unsupported assertions and incorrect statements by Duesberg. After an internal review and with a unanimous recommendation of rejection by five &quot;Lancet&quot; reviewers, Elsevier said that the article was flawed and of potential danger to global public health. Elsevier permanently withdrew the Duesberg article and another AIDS denialist publication and asked that the editor of the journal implement a conventional peer review process.

Letters of complaint to the University of California, Berkeley, including one from Nathan Geffen of the South African Treatment Action Campaign (TAC), prompted university officials to open an inquiry into possible academic misconduct related to false statements and failure to disclose potential conflicts of interest. The investigation was dropped in 2010, with university officials finding &quot;insufficient evidence...to support a recommendation for disciplinary action.&quot; The investigation did not evaluate the merits of the research but found that publishing the article was protected by the principle of academic freedom.

<text>A toxin is a naturally occurring poison produced by metabolic activities of living cells or organisms. They occur especially as proteins, often conjugated. The term was first used by organic chemist Ludwig Brieger (1849–1919), derived from &quot;toxic&quot;.

Toxins can be small molecules, peptides, or proteins that are capable of causing disease on contact with or absorption by body tissues interacting with biological macromolecules such as enzymes or cellular receptors. They vary greatly in their toxicity, ranging from usually minor (such as a bee sting) to potentially fatal even at extremely low doses (such as botulinum toxin).

==Terminology==
Toxins are often distinguished from other chemical agents strictly based on their biological origin.

Less strict understandings embrace naturally occurring inorganic toxins, such as arsenic. Other understandings embrace synthetic analogs of naturally occurring organic poisons as toxins, and may or may not embrace naturally occurring inorganic poisons. It is important to confirm usage if a common understanding is critical.

Toxins are a subset of toxicants. The term toxicant is preferred when the poison is man-made and therefore artificial. The human and scientific genetic assembly of a natural-based toxin should be considered a toxin as it is identical to its natural counterpart. The debate is one of linguistic semantics.

The word toxin does not specify method of delivery (as opposed to venom, a toxin delivered via a bite, sting, etc.). Poison is a related but broader term that encompasses both toxins and toxicants; poisons may enter the body through any means - typically inhalation, ingestion, or skin absorption. Toxin, toxicant, and poison are often used interchangeably despite these subtle differences in definition. The term toxungen has also been proposed to refer to toxins that are delivered onto the body surface of another organism without an accompanying wound.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1111/brv.12062&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A rather informal terminology of individual toxins relates them to the anatomical location where their effects are most notable:
* Genitotoxin, damages the urinary organs or the reproductive organs
* Hemotoxin, causes destruction of red blood cells (hemolysis)
* Phototoxin, causes dangerous photosensitivity
* Hepatotoxins affect the liver
* Neurotoxins affect the nervous system

On a broader scale, toxins may be classified as either exotoxins, excreted by an organism, or endotoxins, which are released mainly when bacteria are lysed.

== Biological ==

The term &quot;biotoxin&quot; is sometimes used to explicitly confirm the biological origin as opposed to environmental or anthropogenic origins. Biotoxins can be classified by their mechanism of delivery as poisons (passively transferred via ingestion, inhalation, or absorption across the skin), toxungens (actively transferred to the target&#x27;s surface by spitting, spraying, or smearing), or venoms (delivered through a wound generated by a bite, sting, or other such action). They can also be classified by their source, such as fungal biotoxins, microbial toxins, plant biotoxins, or animal biotoxins.

Toxins produced by microorganisms are important virulence determinants responsible for microbial pathogenicity and/or evasion of the host immune response.

Biotoxins vary greatly in purpose and mechanism, and can be highly complex (the venom of the cone snail can contain over 100 unique peptides, which target specific nerve channels or receptors).

Biotoxins in nature have two primary functions:
* Predation, such as in the spider, snake, scorpion, jellyfish, and wasp
* Defense as in the bee, ant, termite, honey bee, wasp, poison dart frog and plants producing toxins
** The toxins used as defense in species among the poison dart frog can also be used for medicinal purposes

Some of the more well known types of biotoxins include:
* Cyanotoxins, produced by cyanobacteria
* Dinotoxins, produced by dinoflagellates
* Necrotoxins cause necrosis (i.e., death) in the cells they encounter. Necrotoxins spread through the bloodstream. In humans, skin and muscle tissues are most sensitive to necrotoxins. Organisms that possess necrotoxins include:
** The brown recluse or &quot;fiddle back&quot; spider
** Most rattlesnakes and vipers produce phospholipase and various trypsin-like serine proteases
** Puff adder
** Necrotizing fasciitis (caused by the &quot;flesh eating&quot; bacterium &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot;) – produces a pore forming toxin
* Neurotoxins primarily affect the nervous systems of animals. The group neurotoxins generally consists of ion channel toxins that disrupt ion channel conductance. Organisms that possess neurotoxins include:
** The black widow spider.
** Most scorpions
** The box jellyfish
** Elapid snakes
** The cone snail
** The Blue-ringed octopus
** Venomous fish
** Frogs
** &quot;Palythoa&quot; coral
** Various different types of algae, cyanobacteria and dinoflagellates
* Myotoxins are small, basic peptides found in snake and lizard venoms, They cause muscle tissue damage by a non-enzymatic receptor based mechanism. Organisms that possess myotoxins include:
** rattlesnakes
** Mexican beaded lizard
* Cytotoxins are toxic at the level of individual cells, either in a non-specific fashion or only in certain types of living cells:
** Ricin, from castor beans
** Apitoxin, from honey bees
** T-2 mycotoxin, from certain toxic mushrooms
** Cardiotoxin III, from Chinese cobra
** Hemotoxin, from vipers

=== Weaponry ===
Many living organisms employ toxins offensively or defensively. A relatively small number of toxins are known to have the potential to cause widespread sickness or casualties. They are often inexpensive and easily available, and in some cases it is possible to refine them outside the laboratory. As biotoxins act quickly, and are highly toxic even at low doses, they can be more efficient than chemical agents. 
Due to these factors, it is vital to raise awareness of the clinical symptoms of biotoxin poisoning, and to develop effective countermeasures including rapid investigation, response, and treatment.

==Environmental==

The term &quot;environmental toxin&quot; can sometimes explicitly include synthetic contaminants such as industrial pollutants and other artificially made toxic substances. As this contradicts most formal definitions of the term &quot;toxin&quot;, it is important to confirm what the researcher means when encountering the term outside of microbiological contexts.

Environmental toxins from food chains that may be dangerous to human health include:
* Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP)
* Amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP)
* Diarrheal shellfish poisoning (DSP)
* Neurotoxic shellfish poisoning (NSP)

==Research==
In general, when scientists determine the amount of a substance that may be hazardous for humans, animals and/or the environment they determine the amount of the substance likely to trigger effects and if possible establish a safe level. In Europe, the European Food Safety Authority produced risk assessments for more than 4,000 substances in over 1,600 scientific opinions and they provide open access summaries of human health, animal health and ecological hazard assessments in their OpenFoodTox database. The OpenFoodTox database can be used to screen potential new foods for toxicity.

The Toxicology and Environmental Health Information Program (TEHIP) at the United States National Library of Medicine (NLM) maintains a comprehensive toxicology and environmental health web site that includes access to toxins-related resources produced by TEHIP and by other government agencies and organizations. This web site includes links to databases, bibliographies, tutorials, and other scientific and consumer-oriented resources. TEHIP also is responsible for the Toxicology Data Network (TOXNET), an integrated system of toxicology and environmental health databases that are available free of charge on the web.

TOXMAP is a Geographic Information System (GIS) that is part of TOXNET. TOXMAP uses maps of the United States to help users visually explore data from the United States Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s (EPA) Toxics Release Inventory and Superfund Basic Research Programs.

<text>The Philadelphia Phillies are an American professional baseball team based in Philadelphia. The Phillies compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) East Division. Since 2004, the team&#x27;s home stadium has been Citizens Bank Park, located in the South Philadelphia Sports Complex. 

Founded in 1883, the Phillies are the oldest, continuous, one-name, one-city franchise in American professional sports and one of the most storied teams in Major League Baseball. Since their founding, the Phillies have won two World Series championships (against the Kansas City Royals in and the Tampa Bay Rays in ), eight National League pennants (the first of which came in 1915), and made playoff appearances in 15 seasons. The team has played 122 consecutive seasons since the first modern World Series and 142 seasons since its 1883 establishment. As of the end of the 2024 season, the Phillies have played 21,648 games, with a regular season record of ().

With their first championship in 1980, the Phillies were the last of the 16 pre-expansion teams to win a World Series. Since the start of the Divisional Era in 1969, however, the Phillies have emerged as one of MLB&#x27;s most successful teams, winning 12 division titles, including five consecutive divisional titles between 2007 and 2011, six National League pennants, and two World Series championships. 

The franchise&#x27;s founding in Philadelphia in 1883 replaced the team from Worcester, Massachusetts, in the National League. The team has played at several stadiums in the city, including Recreation Park (1883–1886), the Baker Bowl (1887–1938), Shibe Park (later renamed Connie Mack Stadium in 1953 in honor of longtime Philadelphia Athletics manager Connie Mack) (1938–1970), Veterans Stadium (1971–2003), and now at Citizens Bank Park (2004–present).

Partly because of the team&#x27;s longevity, the Phillies were the first American sports franchise to amass over 10,000 losses. A plurality of those losses came in a 31-year period from 1918 to 1948 in which they managed only one winning season.

Yet, also due in part to their longevity, the Phillies are one of only nine teams to also have won over 10,000 games in their history. Hall of Fame third baseman Mike Schmidt is widely considered the franchise&#x27;s greatest player of all time. Over the team&#x27;s history since 1883, 33 Phillies players have been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.

The Philadelphia Phillies&#x27; Triple-A affiliate is the Lehigh Valley IronPigs, who play at Coca-Cola Park in Allentown, Pennsylvania. The Double-A affiliate is the Reading Fightin Phils, who play in Reading, Pennsylvania. The Class-A affiliates are the Jersey Shore BlueClaws, who play in Lakewood Township, New Jersey; and the Clearwater Threshers, who play in Clearwater, Florida.

The team&#x27;s spring training facilities are at BayCare Ballpark in Clearwater, Florida.

==History==
===Philadelphia Quakers (1883–1889)===

In 1883, sporting goods manufacturer Al Reach, a pioneering professional baseball player, and attorney John Rogers won an expansion National League franchise for Philadelphia, one of what is now known as the &quot;Classic Eight&quot; of the National League. They were awarded a spot in the league to replace the Worcester baseball team, a franchise that had folded in 1882. The new team was nicknamed the &quot;Phillies&quot; from the start, and immediately compiled a .173 winning percentage, which stands as the worst in franchise history. Although many sources (including the Phillies themselves) claim that Reach and Rogers bought the Brown Stockings and moved them to Philadelphia, all available evidence suggests this is not the case. Significantly, no players from Worcester ended up with the 1883 Quakers. 

In 1884, Harry Wright, the former manager of baseball&#x27;s first openly professional team, the Cincinnati Red Stockings, was recruited as a manager in hopes of reversing the team&#x27;s fortunes.

In 1887, the team began to play at the newly constructed Philadelphia Base Ball Grounds, later renamed National League Park. The stadium would become known as the Baker Bowl in 1923. Despite a general improvement from their dismal beginnings, they never seriously contended for the title.

===Becoming the Phillies (1890–1917)===
The nickname &quot;Phillies&quot; first appeared in &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; on April 3, 1883, in the paper&#x27;s coverage of an exhibition game by the new National League club and was the team&#x27;s accepted nickname from the start. This name is one of the longest continually used nicknames in professional sports by a team in the same city.

The franchise&#x27;s standout players in the era were Billy Hamilton, Sam Thompson, and Ed Delahanty, who in 1896 set the major-league record (since tied by several others) with four home runs in a single game. Due to growing disagreements about the direction of the team, Reach sold his interest to Rogers in 1899.

With the birth of the more lucrative American League (AL) in 1901, the Phillies saw many of their better players defect to the upstart, including a number of players who ended up playing for their crosstown rivals, the Athletics, owned by former Phillies minority owner Benjamin Shibe. While their former teammates would thrive (the AL&#x27;s first five batting champions were former Phillies), the remaining squad fared dismally, finishing 46 games out of first place in 1902—the first of three straight years finishing either seventh or eighth. 

To add tragedy to folly, a balcony collapsed during a game at the Baker Bowl in 1903, killing 12 and injuring hundreds. Rogers was forced to sell the Phillies to avoid being ruined by an avalanche of lawsuits. In 1904, the team finished with a record of 52–100, making them the first team in franchise history to have lost 100 games.

The Phillies won their first pennant in 1915 thanks to the pitching of Grover Cleveland Alexander and the batting prowess of Gavvy Cravath, who set the 20th century single-season record for home runs with 24. They finished the season with a record of 90–62, seven games ahead of the Boston Braves. The Phillies went up against the Boston Red Sox in the World Series, opening the series at home with a victory. The Phillies struggled against a strong Red Sox pitching lineup and surrendered the next four games, losing the series four games to one. 

The team continued to dominate the National League in 1916 but fell short of capturing a second consecutive pennant. The team finished two and a half games out of first place with a record of 91–62. Alexander won his second consecutive triple crown and posted 16 shutouts, tying the single-season major league record.

In 1917, Alexander had been traded to the Chicago Cubs for pitcher Mike Prendegrast and catcher Pickles Dillhoefer, when owner William Baker refused to increase his salary. Baker was known for running the Phillies very cheaply; for instance, during much of his tenure, there was only one scout in the entire organization. The Phillies finished the 1917 season in second place with a record of 87–65, ten games behind the New York Giants.

===Three decades of struggle (1918–1948)===

The effect of the Alexander trade was immediate. In 1918, only three years after winning the pennant, the Phillies finished sixth, 13 games under .500. It was the start of one of the longest streaks of futility in baseball history. From 1918 to 1948, the Phillies had only one winning record, which came in 1932. The team finished higher than sixth only twice, and were never a serious factor past June. During this stretch, they finished eighth (last place) a total of 17 times and seventh seven times, with 12 seasons in which they lost at least 100 games. This saddled the franchise with a reputation for failure that dogged it for many years. The team&#x27;s primary stars during the 1920s and 1930s were outfielders Cy Williams, Lefty O&#x27;Doul, and Chuck Klein, who won the Triple Crown in 1933.

Baker died in 1930. He left half his estate to his wife and the other half to longtime team secretary Mae Mallen. Five years earlier, Mallen had married a leather goods and shoe dealer, Gerald Nugent. With the support of Baker&#x27;s widow, Nugent became team president. Baker&#x27;s widow died in 1932, leaving Nugent in complete control. Unlike Baker, Nugent badly wanted to build a winning team, however, he did not have the financial means to do so. He was forced to trade what little talent the team had to make ends meet, and often had to use some creative financial methods to field a team at all.

Philadelphia&#x27;s Baker Bowl proved to be a fertile hitting ground for Phillies opponents as well, and in 1930, the team surrendered 1199 runs, a major-league record still standing today. Once considered one of the finest parks in baseball, it was not well maintained from the 1910s onward. For instance, until 1925, the Phillies used a flock of sheep to trim the grass. Fans were often showered with rust whenever one of Klein&#x27;s home runs hit girders. The entire right field grandstand collapsed in 1926, forcing the Phillies to move to the A&#x27;s Shibe Park (five blocks west on Lehigh Avenue from Baker Bowl) for 1927.
The Phillies tried to move to Shibe Park on a permanent basis as tenants of the A&#x27;s. However, Baker Bowl&#x27;s owner, Charles W. Murphy, at first refused to let the Phillies out of their lease. He finally relented in 1938, and only then because the city threatened to condemn the dilapidated park. Despite the move, attendance rarely topped 3,000 a game.

The lowest point came in 1941, when the Phillies finished with a 43–111 record, setting a franchise record for losses in a season. A year later, they needed an advance from the league just to go to spring training. Nugent realized he did not have enough money to operate the team in 1943, and put it up for sale.

After lumber baron William D. Cox purchased the team with a group of investors for $190,000 and a $50,000 note on March 15, 1943, the Phillies rose out of last place for the first time in five years. As a result, the fan base and attendance at home games increased. Eventually, Cox revealed that he had been betting on the Phillies, and he was banned from baseball by baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis on November 23, 1943. The new owner, Bob Carpenter Sr., scion of the Delaware-based duPont family, bought the team with his son for an estimated $400,000 that same day – November 23, 1943. The Carpenters tried to polish the team&#x27;s image and way of doing business. Carpenter Sr. named his son, Bob Carpenter, Jr., team president. They wanted to shed the image of failure by changing the team&#x27;s nickname.

====Philadelphia Blue Jays====
Before the 1944 season, the team held a fan contest soliciting a new team nickname. Management chose &quot;Blue Jays&quot;, the fan submission of Elizabeth Crooks, who received a $100 war bond as compensation. The Phillies would later claim in the 2000s that the Blue Jays moniker was never official, however news reports in 1944 note that Phillies management said that the Blue Jays name was as an official &quot;additional nickname&quot;, meaning that the team had two official nicknames simultaneously, the Phillies and the Blue Jays. 

The Phillies&#x27; official adoption of Blue Jays as a second official nickname led to a dispute with Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, whose nickname is and was Blue Jays. Wilson Shaffer, the school&#x27;s athletic director, criticized the Philadelphia team for adopting his university&#x27;s moniker, and said that Philadelphia should use the blue jay&#x27;s scientific name instead and be known as the Philadelphia Cyanocitta Cristata. Similarly, the university&#x27;s student council, citing the Philadelphia team&#x27;s long track record of failure, passed a resolution demanding &quot;suitable satisfaction&quot; for what they perceived as theft and sullying of the Blue Jays name. Carpenter, Jr., responded by criticizing Johns Hopkins&#x27; baseball record and promised to make the students proud of the Blue Jays name by having his Philadelphia baseball team win many games.

The Philadelphia team added three minor league clubs before the start of the 1946 season and named them all Blue Jays: the Class C Salina Blue Jays, Class C Schenectady Blue Jays and Class D Green Bay Blue Jays. 

However, the new Blue Jays moniker was ultimately unpopular, and although the team in the 2000s claimed that it was quietly dropped by 1949, news reports at the time indicate that the nickname, which &quot;never caught on anyway&quot;, was not officially dropped by the team until January 1950.

The Blue Jays moniker would be used by Toronto&#x27;s MLB club when it started play in 1977. Coincidentally, those Blue Jays would go on to defeat the Phillies in six games in the 1993 World Series nearly 50 years later.

===Fightin&#x27; Phils (1949–1970)===


Like Cox, Bob Carpenter Jr. was not afraid to spend the money it took to build a contender. He immediately started signing young players and invested even more money in the farm system, and the Phillies quickly developed a solid core of young players that included future Hall of Famers Richie Ashburn and Robin Roberts. This coincided with the final collapse of the A&#x27;s. Philadelphia had been an &quot;A&#x27;s town&quot; for most of the first half of the 20th century. Even though the A&#x27;s had fielded teams as bad or worse than the Phillies for most years since the 1930s, the A&#x27;s continued to trounce the Phillies at the gate. However, a series of poor baseball and business decisions on the A&#x27;s part allowed the Phillies to win the hearts of Philadelphia&#x27;s long-suffering fans.

Things started coming together for the Phillies in 1949, when they rocketed up the standings to third place with an 81–73 record. Although the season had essentially been a two-team race between Brooklyn and St. Louis, it was still the Phillies&#x27; first appearance in the first division in 31 years. It was also a fitting tribute to Bob Carpenter Sr., who had died in June and left Bob Jr. in full control of the team.

The 1950 Phillies led the National League standings for most of the season and were dubbed the &quot;Whiz Kids&quot;. In the final months of the season, a tailspin (triggered by the loss of starting pitcher Curt Simmons to National Guard service) caused the team to lose the next eight of ten games. On the last day of the season, the Phillies hung on to a one-game lead when Dick Sisler&#x27;s dramatic tenth inning home run against the Brooklyn Dodgers clinched the Phillies&#x27; first pennant in 35 years. In the World Series, exhausted from their late-season plunge and victims of poor luck, the Phillies were swept by the New York Yankees in four straight games. Nonetheless, this appearance cemented the Phillies&#x27; status as the city&#x27;s favorite team.

In contrast, the Philadelphia Athletics finished last in 1950, and longtime manager Connie Mack retired. The team struggled for four more years with only one winning season before abandoning Philadelphia under the Johnson brothers, who bought out Mack. They began to play in Kansas City in 1955. As part of the deal selling that team to the Johnson brothers, the Phillies bought Shibe Park, where both teams had played since 1938. Many thought that the &quot;Whiz Kids&quot;, with a young core of talented players, would be a force in the league for years to come. However, the team finished with a 73–81 record in 1951 and finished nine and a half games out of first place in 1952, with an 87–67 record. The Phillies managed to end up in third place in 1953 with an 83–71 record, however, they would fail to break .500 from 1954 to 1957.

It became apparent that the flash and determination of the Whiz Kids would not return when the team finished last place in the National League from 1958 to 1961. Manager Eddie Sawyer abruptly quit the team after the season opener in 1960, and was replaced by Gene Mauch.

The team&#x27;s competitive futility was highlighted by a record that still stands: in 1961, the Phillies lost 23 games in a row, the worst losing streak in the majors since 1900. Things started to turn around for the team in 1962, when the team finished above .500 for the first time in five years. Gene Mauch was named National League Manager of the Year that season and won it again in 1964. The team improved in 1963, when the team finished the season with an 87–75 record. There was confidence that the team would soon become contenders for a return to the World Series. Though Ashburn and Roberts were gone, the 1964 Phillies still had younger pitchers Art Mahaffey, Chris Short, and rookie Ray Culp; veterans Jim Bunning and screwballer Jack Baldschun; and fan favorites Cookie Rojas, Johnny Callison, and NL Rookie of the Year Dick Allen. The team was 90–60 on September 20, good enough for a lead of 6.5 games in the pennant race with 12 games to play. However, the Phillies lost 10 games in a row and finished one game out of first, losing the pennant to the St. Louis Cardinals. The &quot;Phold of &#x27;64&quot; is frequently mentioned as the worst collapse in sports history.

One highlight of the 1964 season occurred on Father&#x27;s Day, when Jim Bunning pitched a perfect game against the New York Mets, the first in Phillies&#x27; history.

For the rest of the decade, the team finished no higher than fourth place in the NL standings which came during the 1966 season. In the 1969 season, the Phillies finished fifth in the newly created NL East Division, with a record of 63–99.

By the late 1950s, Carpenter decided the Phillies needed a new home. He never wanted to buy Connie Mack Stadium in the first place, and was now convinced there was no way he could make money playing there. He sold the park to Philadelphia Eagles&#x27; owner Jerry Wolman in 1964, taking a $1 million loss on his purchase of just 10 years earlier. The stadium was deteriorating and there was inadequate parking. Attendance began to drop by 1967 and the team started to plan for a new stadium. 

The Phillies remained at Connie Mack Stadium until 1970. In the last game played there, the Phillies avoided last place by beating the Expos 2–1. When the game was finished several fans in attendance began to remove items from the ballpark, such as chairs, outfield panels and baseball equipment from the dugouts.

===Glory days (1971–1984)===


The Phillies opened the new Veterans Stadium in 1971. The team wore new maroon uniforms to accentuate the change. The stadium was built in South Philadelphia, making it the first time the team was not located in North Philadelphia. The new stadium, along with nearby John F. Kennedy Stadium and the Spectrum, established the South Philadelphia Sports Complex. 

Pitcher Rick Wise hurled a no-hitter and in the same game hit two home runs against the Cincinnati Reds in 1971. That same season, Harry Kalas joined the Phillies broadcasting team. 

In 1972, the Phillies were the worst team in baseball, but newly acquired Steve Carlton won nearly half their games (27 of 59 team wins) and was awarded his first NL Cy Young Award and won it again in 1977. Bob Carpenter Jr. retired in 1972 and passed the team ownership to his son Ruly. 

The Phillies achieved some success in the mid-1970s. With players such as Carlton, third baseman Mike Schmidt, shortstop Larry Bowa, catcher Bob Boone, and outfielder Greg Luzinski, the Phillies won three straight division titles (1976–78). However, they fell short in the NLCS, against the Reds in 1976 and the Dodgers in 1977 and 1978. In 1979, the Phillies acquired Pete Rose, the spark that would put them over the top.

====1980 World Series champions====

The Phillies won the National League East in 1980, but to win the league championship, they had to defeat the Houston Astros. In a memorable NLCS, with four of the five games needing extra innings, they fell behind 2–1 but battled back to squeeze past the Astros on a 10th-inning game-winning hit by center fielder Garry Maddox, and the city celebrated its first NL pennant in 30 years. The entire series saw only one home run hit, a game-winning two-run home run by Phillies slugger Greg Luzinski in the Phillies&#x27; opening 3–1 win in Game 1 at Philadelphia.

Facing the Kansas City Royals in the 1980 World Series, the Phillies won their first World Series championship ever in six games thanks to the timely hitting of Mike Schmidt and Pete Rose. Schmidt, who won the National League Most Valuable Player Award in 1980, also won the World Series Most Valuable Player award on the strength of his 8-for-21 hitting (.381 average), including game-winning hits in Game 2 and the clinching Game 6. This final game was also significant because it remains &quot;the most-watched game in World Series history&quot; with a television audience of 54.9 million viewers. Thus, the Phillies became the last of the 16 teams that made up the Major Leagues from 1903 to 1960 to win a World Series. Carlton captured his third NL Cy Young Award with a record of 24–9.

After their series win, Ruly Carpenter, who had been given control of the team in 1972 when his father stepped down as team president, sold the team for $32.5 million in 1981 to a group that was headed by longtime Phillies executive William Yale Giles.

The Phillies returned to the playoffs in 1981, which were split in half due to a players&#x27; strike. In five games, they were defeated in the first-ever National League Division Series by the Montreal Expos. Mike Schmidt won his second consecutive NL Most Valuable Player award that year. In 1982, the team finished three games behind the St. Louis Cardinals in the East Division, narrowly missing the playoffs. Carlton captured his fourth career NL Cy Young Award that year with 23 wins. 

For the 1983 season, the Phillies returned to the playoffs and beat the Los Angeles Dodgers. They won this series in four games to capture their fourth NL pennant; however, they lost to the Baltimore Orioles in the World Series in five games. John Denny was named the 1983 NL Cy Young Award winner. Because of the numerous veterans on the 1983 team, &quot;Philadelphia Daily News&quot; sportswriter Stan Hochman gave them the nickname, the &quot;Wheeze Kids&quot;.

In 1984, the team finished fourth in the NL East with a record of 81–81. Mike Schmidt still remained a dominant force on the team by leading the National League in both home runs and runs batted in.

===Years of struggle (1985–1991)===
The 1985 season was the first time the team finished below .500 since 1974. The team had some success in 1986 despite having released star pitcher Steve Carlton due to injuries. They went on to finish second in the division with a record of 86–75. Mike Schmidt led the National League in home runs and runs batted in that year and also won his third National League Most Valuable Player award, sixth Silver Slugger award and tenth Gold Glove.

In 1987, closer Steve Bedrosian was named the NL Cy Young Award winner. 

Injuries caused Mike Schmidt to miss most of the 1988 season and he retired from baseball after playing in only 42 games in 1989, thus, the last member of the 1980 championship team was gone.

In 1990, Terry Mulholland lost a perfect game in the seventh inning when a San Francisco Giants&#x27; batter reached base on a throwing error. The next batter grounded into a double play. Thus, Mulholland faced the perfect-game maximum of 27 batters, but did not qualify for a perfect game. He was credited, however, with a no-hitter. 

During this time, the Phillies often struggled to attract more than 25,000 people to Veterans Stadium, the biggest in the National League at the time (at over 62,000 seats). Even crowds of 40,000 were swallowed up by the cavernous environment.

===Macho Row (1992–1995)===
Before the 1992 season, the organization decided to shed the maroon uniform and logo and use colors similar to those used during the days of the &quot;Whiz Kids&quot;. The season ended with the Phillies at the bottom of the standings—last place in the National League East. However, their fortunes were about to change.

The 1993 Phillies were led by stars such as Darren Daulton, John Kruk, Lenny Dykstra, and Curt Schilling. The team was dubbed &quot;Macho Row&quot; for their shaggy, unkempt, and dirty look. Their character endeared them to fans, and attendance reached a record high the following season. 

The team powered their way to a 97–65 record and an NL East division title, all thanks to a big April in which the Phillies went 17–5. The Phillies&#x27; major contributors on offense were Dykstra, Kruk, Kevin Stocker (a rookie who led the team in batting average, hitting .324), and Jim Eisenreich, all of whom hit over .300 for the season. Their pitching staff was led by 16-game winners Curt Schilling and Tommy Greene. Each member of the rotation posted at least 10 wins, while the bullpen was led by elder statesman Larry Andersen and closer Mitch &quot;Wild Thing&quot; Williams, who notched 43 saves and a 3.34 ERA.

They beat the Atlanta Braves in the 1993 National League Championship Series, four games to two, to earn the fifth NL pennant in franchise history, only to be defeated by the defending World Series champion Toronto Blue Jays in the 1993 World Series. Toronto&#x27;s Joe Carter hit a walk-off home run in Game 6 to clinch another Phillies&#x27; loss.

The 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike was a blow to attendance and on-field success, as was the arrival of the Atlanta Braves in the division due to league realignment. Several players from the 1993 team were either traded or left the team soon after.

===Rebuilding years (1996–2005)===

The team drafted third baseman Scott Rolen in the second round of the 1993 amateur draft. He had reached the majors by 1996 and was named National League Rookie of the Year in 1997. After becoming frustrated with management he demanded a trade and was dealt to the St. Louis Cardinals in 2002.

Former Phillie Larry Bowa was hired as manager for the 2001 season, and led the Phillies to an 86–76 record, their first winning season since the 1993 World Series year. They spent most of the first half of the season in first place, and traded first place with the Braves for most of the second half. In the end, they finished two games out of first. Bowa was named National League Manager of the Year.

The Phillies continued to contend for the next few years under Bowa, with the only blemish being an 80–81 season in 2002. On December 6, 2002, Jim Thome, a free agent, signed a six-year, $85 million contract with the team.

Between 1996 and 2002, the team drafted players who would soon become the core of the team including Jimmy Rollins, Pat Burrell, Chase Utley, Ryan Howard, and Cole Hamels. In 2004, the Phillies moved to their new home, Citizens Bank Park, across the street from Veterans Stadium.

Charlie Manuel took over the club&#x27;s reins from Bowa after the 2004 season, and general manager Ed Wade was replaced by Pat Gillick in November 2005. Gillick reshaped the club as his own, bringing in players such as Shane Victorino, Jayson Werth, and Jamie Moyer.

===The Golden era (2006–2012)===
Ryan Howard won the NL Most Valuable Player Award for the 2006 season and Jimmy Rollins won the award the following year. After the franchise lost its 10,000th game in 2007, its core of young players responded by winning the National League East division title, but they were swept by the Colorado Rockies in the Division Series. After the 2007 season, they acquired closer Brad Lidge through a trade with the Houston Astros.

====2008 World Series champions====


The Phillies were named by some media as favorites to repeat as division champions in 2008, but they did not get off to the blazing April start that many had hoped for. Still, they managed their first winning opening month since 2003, and only their fourth since their last World Series appearance.

Chase Utley and Brad Lidge represented the team at the 2008 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, with Utley garnering the most votes of all National League players. In a move to bolster their starting rotation in preparation for the pennant race, the Phillies traded three minor league players to the Athletics for starting pitcher Joe Blanton on July 17.

On September 27, the Phillies clinched the National League East for the second year in a row. They won the NLDS three games to one against the Milwaukee Brewers, and they defeated the Dodgers in Los Angeles as well, 4–1. As the National League champions, the Phillies advanced to the 2008 World Series to play the Tampa Bay Rays, winning the series 4 games to 1. Game 5 began on Monday, October 27, and was suspended after the top of the 6th inning, with the score tied 2–2. The game resumed Wednesday, October 29, with the Phillies winning the game 4–3 and capturing their second world series in franchise history. Prior to this, there had never been a rain-shortened game in World Series history, and this was the first suspension. Cole Hamels won the Most Valuable Player Award for both the NLCS and the World Series. 

Pat Gillick retired as general manager after the 2008 season and was succeeded by one of his assistants, Rubén Amaro Jr. After adding outfielder Raúl Ibañez to replace the departed Pat Burrell, the Phillies retained the majority of their core players for the 2009 season. In July, they signed three-time Cy Young Award winner Pedro Martínez and acquired 2008 American League Cy Young winner Cliff Lee before the trade deadline. On September 30, 2009, they clinched a third consecutive National League East Division title for the first time since the 1976–78 seasons.

The team beat the Colorado Rockies in the NLDS and the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLCS to become the first Phillies team to win back-to-back pennants and the first National League team since the 1996 Atlanta Braves to have an opportunity to defend their World Series title. However, the Phillies were unable to repeat the 2008 World Series victory; they were defeated in the 2009 series by the New York Yankees, four games to two. In recognition of the team&#x27;s recent accomplishments, &quot;Baseball America&quot; named the Phillies its Organization of the Year.

On December 16, 2009, the Phillies acquired starting pitcher Roy Halladay from the Toronto Blue Jays for three minor-league prospects, and traded Cliff Lee to the Seattle Mariners for three prospects. 

On May 29, 2010, Halladay pitched a perfect game against the Florida Marlins. In June 2010, the team&#x27;s scheduled series against the Toronto Blue Jays at Rogers Centre was moved to Philadelphia, because of security concerns for the G-20 Summit. The Blue Jays wore their home white uniforms and batted last as the home team, and the designated hitter was used. The game was the first occasion of the use of a designated hitter in a National League ballpark in a regular-season game; Ryan Howard was the first player to fill the role.

The 2010 Phillies won their fourth consecutive NL East Division championship despite a rash of significant injuries to key players. After dropping seven games behind the Atlanta Braves on July 21, Philadelphia finished with an MLB-best record of 97–65. The streak included a 20–5 record in September, the Phillies&#x27; best September since winning 22 games that month in 1983, and an 11–0 run in the middle of the month. The acquisition of pitcher Roy Oswalt in early August was a key step, as Oswalt won seven consecutive games in just over five weeks from August 11 through September 17. The Phillies clinched the division on September 27, behind a two-hit shutout by Halladay.

In Game 1 of the 2010 National League Division Series, Halladay threw the second no-hitter in Major League Baseball postseason history, leading the Phillies over the Cincinnati Reds, 4–0. (The first was New York Yankees pitcher Don Larsen&#x27;s perfect game in the 1956 World Series.) Halladay&#x27;s no-hitter was the fifth time a pitcher has thrown two no-hitters in the same season, and was also the first time that one of the two occurred in the postseason. The Phillies went on to sweep the Reds in three straight games. 

In the 2010 National League Championship Series, the Phillies fell to the eventual World Series champion San Francisco Giants in six games. Halladay was named the 2010 NL Cy Young Award winner.

Before the start of the 2011 season, the Phillies signed pitcher Cliff Lee to a five-year deal, bringing him back to the team and forming a formidable rotation of Halladay, Lee, Hamels, Oswalt, and Blanton. Including Vance Worley, who replaced Joe Blanton due to injury. The rotation combined for a win–loss record of 71–38, and an earned run average of 2.86, the best in the majors that year. Commentators called it one of the best rotations ever assembled. Halladay, Oswalt, Lee, and Hamels were dubbed two nicknames by fans and media: the &quot;Phantastic Phour&quot; and &quot;The Four Aces&quot;. On September 17, 2011, the Phillies won their fifth consecutive East Division championship, and on September 28, during the final game of the season, the team set a franchise record for victories in a season with 102 by beating the Atlanta Braves in 13 innings, denying their division rivals a potential wild card berth. Yet the Phillies lost in the NLDS to the St. Louis Cardinals—the team that won the National League Wild Card as a result of the Phillies beating the Braves. The Cardinals subsequently beat the Brewers in the NLCS and won the 2011 World Series in seven games over the Texas Rangers. 

The 2012 Phillies experienced an up and down season. They played .500 ball through the first two months, but then slumped through a 9–19 stretch in June where they ended up at the bottom of the NL East by mid-season. With any hope dimming, the Phillies traded key players Shane Victorino and Joe Blanton to the Los Angeles Dodgers, and Hunter Pence to the San Francisco Giants before the trade deadline. A hot start in the second half of the season put the Phillies back on the postseason hunt, but any hope was eventually extinguished with a loss to the Washington Nationals on September 28, costing the Phillies the postseason for the first time since 2006.

The Phillies&#x27; win–loss record never went below .500 during this time; and the team won the NL East five years in a row from 2007 to 2011.

=== End of an era (2013–2018) ===
During the 2013 season, the team struggled again and was unable to consistently play well for the majority of the season. On August 16, 2013, with the team&#x27;s record at 53–68, the Phillies fired manager Charlie Manuel, who had managed the team since 2005, and promoted third-base coach Ryne Sandberg to interim manager. Manuel had spent over nine years as manager, leading Philadelphia to its first World Series victory in nearly 30 years and amassing an overall record of 780–636 to become the manager with the most wins in the franchise&#x27;s history. The 2013 Phillies ended up with a record of 73–89, their first losing season since 2002. In the off-season, pitcher Roy Halladay retired from baseball.

In the 2014 season, one of the few bright spots was the September 1 game against a division rival, the Atlanta Braves, when starter Cole Hamels and relievers Jake Diekman, Ken Giles, and Jonathan Papelbon combined for a no-hitter at Turner Field and a 7–0 victory over Atlanta. In the first round of the 2014 MLB Draft the Phillies selected pitcher Aaron Nola with the 7th overall pick. The team could not gain momentum during the season and finished last in the NL East, the first time they had done so since 2000. During the off-season, Jimmy Rollins waived his no-trade clause and was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers, while Cliff Lee pitched his last game and was sidelined for the entire 2015 season due to injury. 

In 2015, attendance began to drop as the team showed little improvement and it was clear that the remnants of the 2008 World Series team would soon be departing. Sandberg resigned as manager and bench coach Pete Mackanin was brought in as interim manager. Cole Hamels no-hit the Chicago Cubs 5–0 at Wrigley Field, on July 25, striking out 13 and giving up only two walks. It was the first no-hitter against the Cubs since Sandy Koufax&#x27;s perfect game in 1965, and first at Wrigley Field since the Cubs&#x27; Milt Pappas in 1972. Hamels was dealt to the Texas Rangers, six days later. The following month saw the departure of Chase Utley who was traded to the Dodgers. In September, general manager Rubén Amaro Jr. was fired and Andy MacPhail was brought in as the interim general manager. The team once again finished last in the NL East with a record of 63–99. McPhail was officially named the organization&#x27;s President of Baseball Operations during the off season. The team then hired Matt Klentak as the new general manager. 

In 2016, the team finished fourth in the NL East, only winning eight more games than they had the previous year, with a 71–91 record. The 2016 season was the last for both Ryan Howard and Carlos Ruiz in a Phillies&#x27; uniform. Ruiz was traded to the Dodgers in late August, reuniting him with Chase Utley. The team decided to not exercise their club option on Howard, thus making him a free agent. 

On September 29, 2017, Pete Mackanin was fired as manager. The Phillies announced Gabe Kapler as their new manager on October 30, 2017. Kapler had been the Director of Player Development for the Los Angeles Dodgers since November 2014. He led the Phillies in the right direction in the first half of the 2018 season, as they had a 59–48 record at the July 31 trade deadline and were leading the NL East division by 1.5 games over the Atlanta Braves. However, a late-season collapse where they went 21–34 from August to the end of the season led to the Phillies finishing with an 80–82 record and third in the division. Aaron Nola amassed a record of 17–6 with a 2.37 earned run average and 0.975 WHIP. He finished third in the National League Cy Young race, behind the Nationals&#x27; Max Scherzer and the winner, the Mets&#x27; Jacob DeGrom.

===Building a winning team (2019–2022)===
The Phillies intended to start targeting valuable free agents as soon as the 2018 season was over. Owner John Middleton said they were willing to &quot;spend stupid money&quot;. During the off-season, the Phillies signed Andrew McCutchen, David Robertson, and made the splash of the offseason by signing Bryce Harper to a 13-year, $330 million deal, taking him away from the division rival Washington Nationals. The team also made many trades, including trading for the Mariners&#x27; shortstop Jean Segura and the Marlins&#x27; catcher J.T. Realmuto. The Phillies got off to a hot start the first two months, going 33–22 but collapsed from there. They were eliminated from the playoffs on September 24 in the first game of a day-night double-header against Harper&#x27;s former team and the eventual World Series champions, the Nationals, on their way to finishing with a record of 81–81. Owner John Middleton fired Manager Gabe Kapler on October 10, 2019, after ten days of intense deliberations with insiders and outsiders alike.

On October 24, 2019, the Philadelphia Phillies announced Joe Girardi as their 55th manager of the team, signing a three-year deal with the Phillies with an option for the 2023 season. 

The team failed to get a winning season in the COVID-shortened 2020 season and finished with a 28–32 record and failed to enter the playoffs, and the Miami Marlins, a team sometimes ridiculed as weaker than Phillies, ended up getting in playoffs in 2020, so on October 3, 2020, Matt Klentak was relieved from General Manager. On December 11, 2020, the Phillies hired Dave Dombrowski as the President Of Baseball Operations. On December 22, 2020, Dombrowski hired Sam Fuld as the General Manager. 

In 2021, the Phillies finished the season with an 82–80 record, the first winning season since 2011, but failed to make the playoffs. One major highlight of the season was Bryce Harper winning the NL Most Valuable Player Award for the 2021 season. The team targeted high-profile free agents during the offseason and improved their lineup by signing outfielders Kyle Schwarber and Nick Castellanos. 

The Phillies got off to a sluggish 22–29 start to the 2022 season. On June 3, the Phillies fired manager Joe Girardi and replaced him with bench coach Rob Thomson, who was named the team&#x27;s interim manager. The Phillies ended the 2022 season 87–75, reaching the playoffs for the first time since 2011. 

In the postseason, the Phillies traveled to St. Louis to face the St. Louis Cardinals in the National League Wild Card Series for a best of three series, winning in two games. They went on to eliminate the defending World Champion Atlanta Braves three games to one in the National League Division Series, advancing to the National League Championship Series where they would face the San Diego Padres. The Phillies won the series four games to one and would advance to the 2022 World Series. Bryce Harper was named MVP of the NLCS. On October 10, the Phillies also removed the interim role of Thomson and named him the team&#x27;s manager.

The Phillies faced the American League champion Houston Astros in a best of seven World Series that began October 28 at Minute Maid Park in Houston. The Astros entered the series as the top seeded team in the American League and with an undefeated record in the postseason of 7–0. Game 1 ended with the Phillies winning the game in extra innings by a score of 6–5, with catcher J.T. Realmuto hitting the game-winning home run in the top of the 10th inning. The Astros would even the series at 1–1 in Game 2, with the series going to Philadelphia for the first time since 2009. Game 3 at Citizens Bank Park was originally scheduled to take place on October 31, but was postponed until the following day due to rain, which also moved the rest of the series games back by a day. The Phillies would take Game 3 by a score of 7–0, which was a result of the team hitting five home runs in the first five innings of the game, the first time this had occurred in World Series history. All five home runs were given up by Astros pitcher Lance McCullers Jr., which became a record for most home runs surrendered by a pitcher in a World Series game. In Game 4, the Astros answered back by winning the game 5–0 and throwing a combined no-hitter, the first combined no-hitter in postseason history, and just the second no-hitter of any type in a World Series after Don Larsen&#x27;s perfect game in 1956. The Astros won the next two games, winning the series four games to two. The Phillies&#x27; game six loss, coming shortly after the Philadelphia Union fell in the championship game of the MLS Cup, made Philadelphia the first American city to lose two major professional sports championship title games in the same day. Later, the Philadelphia Eagles would also lose Super Bowl LVII when they lost to the Kansas City Chiefs, thus making the first time three teams in the same city lost three consecutive finals in history.

==Team uniforms==
===Current uniforms===
The current team colors, uniform, and logo date back to 1992. The main team colors are red and white, with blue serving as a prominent accent. The team name is written in red with a blue star serving as the dot over the &quot;i&quot;s, and blue piping is often found in Phillies&#x27; branded apparel and materials. The team&#x27;s home uniform is white with red pinstripes, lettering and numbering. The road uniform is traditional grey with red lettering/numbering. Both bear a script-lettered &quot;Phillies&quot; logo, with the aforementioned star dotting the &quot;i&quot;s across the chest, and the player name and number on the back. The uniform&#x27;s front script has undergone minor changes over the years. Hats are red with a single stylized &quot;P&quot;. The uniforms and logo are very similar to those used during the &quot;Whiz Kids&quot; era from 1950 to 1969.

Prior to 2024, the Phillies were the one of two MLB teams to use chain stitching in their chest emblems, along with the St. Louis Cardinals. However, when Nike controversially changed the league&#x27;s uniforms to the Vapor Premier uniform, the Phillies&#x27; wordmark crest was changed to a tackle twill patch style.

In 2008, the Phillies introduced an alternate, cream-colored uniform during home day games—a tribute to their 125th anniversary. The uniforms are similar to those worn from 1946 through 1949, featuring red lettering bordered with blue piping and lacking pinstripes. The accompanying cap is blue with a red bill and a red stylized &quot;P&quot;. The uniforms were announced on November 29, 2007, when shortstop Jimmy Rollins, pitcher Cole Hamels, and Hall of Fame pitcher Robin Roberts modeled the new uniforms.

In 2016, the Phillies added a red alternate uniform, similar to their spring training uniforms, to be used for mid-week afternoon games. It was unofficially retired following the 2017 season, after which the Phillies revived their powder blue throwbacks as an alternate uniform to be used on select Thursday home games. The red alternates were brought back for select road games in 2021, and became the team&#x27;s preferred uniform during &quot;getaway day&quot; road games. After the 2023 season, the Phillies retired the red alternates in anticipation of a new City Connect uniform, unveiled in 2024. The primarily light blue/midnight blue gradient uniform with yellow trim was heavily inspired by the flag of Philadelphia&#x27;s colors of light blue and yellow, with &quot;Philly&quot; emblazoned on the chest. The cap has Liberty Bell silhouette with a light blue sky and midnight blue skyline, centered alongside two yellow stars. For the 2024 season, the Phillies wore their City Connect uniforms for 12 Friday night home games.

The Phillies are one of four teams in Major League Baseball that do not display the name of their city, state, or region on their road jerseys, joining the Los Angeles Angels, St. Louis Cardinals, and the Tampa Bay Rays. Until 2022, the Phillies were the only team that also displayed the player&#x27;s number on one sleeve, except on the alternate jersey, in addition to the usual placement on the back of the jersey. Since 2023, the sleeves on the Phillies&#x27; primary uniforms were left blank in anticipation of a future uniform advertisement. In 2024, the Phillies unveiled Independence Blue Cross (IBX) as the team&#x27;s first uniform advertiser.

=== Patches ===
From Opening Day through July 26, 2009, the Phillies wore 2008 World Champions patches on the right sleeve of their home uniforms to celebrate their World Series victory the season prior.

The Phillies have worn the following memorial patches:

* For the 2009 season the Phillies wore black, circular &quot;HK&quot; patches over their hearts in memory of broadcaster Harry Kalas, who died April 13, 2009, just before he was to broadcast a Phillies game in Washington, D.C.
* After the death of Hall of Fame pitcher Robin Roberts on May 6, 2010, the Phillies wore a black patch with a white &quot;36&quot; on the sleeves of their jerseys in memory of Roberts for the remainder of the 2010 season. Number 36 had been retired previously by the team in 1962 to honor Roberts.
* For the 2011 season, the Phillies wore a black circular patch with a &quot;B&quot; in honor of minority owners Alexander and John Buck, who died in late 2010. 
* For the 2014 season, the Phillies wore a black circular patch with initials &quot;CB&quot; in honor of former owner Claire Betz, who died during the offseason.
* For the 2015 season, the Phillies wore a black circular patch with a white &quot;SLB&quot; in memory of minority owner Sara L. Buck, who died on August 23, 2014.
* For the 2017 season, the Phillies wore a black circular patch on their sleeves featuring the &quot;baseball stitched&quot; center swirl &quot;P&quot; used from 1970 to 1991 inside the white silhouette of a capital &quot;D&quot; in memory of former manager Dallas Green, who led the franchise to its first World Series championship and died on March 22, 2017.
* Following the death of former chairman, minority-owner, and president David Montgomery on May 8, 2019, the Phillies added a black circular patch with white &quot;DPM&quot; letters in memory of Montgomery for the remainder of the 2019 season.
* For the 2021 season, the Phillies wore a patch with the number &quot;15&quot; on it in honor of former player Dick Allen, who died the previous year.

===Batting practice===
The Phillies were an early adopter of the batting practice jersey in 1977, wearing a maroon v-necked top with the &quot;Phillies&quot; script name across the chest, as well as the player name and number on the back and a player number on the left sleeve, all in white. Pete Rose wore this maroon batting jersey in place of the road jersey during the 1979 All-Star Game. Currently, during spring training, the Phillies wear solid red practice jerseys with pinstriped pants for Grapefruit League home games. The red jerseys are worn with grey pants on the road.

===Former uniforms===

From 1970 to 1991, the Phillies sported colors, uniforms, and a logo that were noticeably different from what had come before, or since, but that were widely embraced by even traditionally minded fans. A dark burgundy was adopted as the main team color, with a classic pinstripe style for home uniforms. Blue was almost entirely dropped as part of the team&#x27;s official color scheme, except in one area; a pale blue (as opposed to traditional grey) was used as the base-color for away game uniforms from 1972 to 1988. Yet the most important aspect of the 1970 uniform change was the adoption of one of the more distinctive logos in sports; a Phillies &quot;P&quot; that, thanks to its unique shape and &quot;baseball stitched&quot; center swirl, remained instantly recognizable and admired, long after its regular use had ended. It was while wearing this uniform style and color motif that the club achieved its most enduring success, including a World Series title in 1980 and another World Series appearance in 1983. Its continued popularity with fans is still evident. Even today, Phillies&#x27; home games can contain many fans sporting caps, shirts or jackets emblazoned with the iconic &quot;P&quot; and burgundy color scheme. The current team has worn the burgundy and powder blue throwbacks whenever their opponents are wearing throwback uniforms from that era. Additionally, this uniform also marked the first appearance of &quot;racing stripes&quot; on a baseball uniform (striping going down the jersey shoulders, the side of the pants and up to the sides of the jersey up to the armpit), which would be seen on several other MLB teams for the next quarter-century.

===Controversial uniform changes===
In 1979, the Phillies&#x27; front office modified the uniform into an all-burgundy version with white trimmings, to be worn for Saturday games. They were called &quot;Saturday Night Specials&quot; and were worn for the first and last time on May 19, 1979, a 10–5 loss to the Montreal Expos. The immediate reaction of the media, fans, and players alike was negative, with many describing the despised uniforms as pajama-like. As such, the idea was hastily abandoned. Mike Schmidt did wear the uniform during the MLB All-Star Tour of Japan following the 1979 season. During the closing ceremonies at Veterans Stadium on September 28, 2003, there was a procession of former players during the post-game ceremony, most in uniform. Larry Christenson, the starting pitcher in the original game, came out wearing this old burgundy uniform and was the only one to do so. The Phillies wore this jersey again for the 40th anniversary of the original game on July 27, 2019. Christenson threw out the ceremonial first pitch. They lost to the Atlanta Braves 15–7.

Another uniform controversy arose in 1994, when the Phillies introduced all-blue caps on Opening Day that were to be worn for home day games only. The caps were unpopular with the players, who considered them bad luck after two losses and wanted them discontinued. Management wanted to keep using the caps as planned, as they sold well to fans. A compromise was reached: the players agreed to wear them for weekday games while returning to the customary red caps for Sunday afternoon games. In all, the Phillies wore the &quot;unlucky&quot; blue caps for seven games in 1994, losing six (the lone victory a 5–2 triumph over the Florida Marlins on June 29). A slightly different blue cap (with a red bill) was introduced in 2008 as part of the alternate home uniform for day games, a throwback to the late 1940s.

==Rivalries==
The Phillies had several notable rivalries through history as they often clashed frequently against the Atlanta Braves, Los Angeles Dodgers, and the New York Mets during the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and the 2000s. The Phillies often faced heated matchups against all three teams. Against the Dodgers and the Braves, those matchups have happened in the postseason, the Dodgers five times in the NLCS, the Braves twice in the NLDS and once in the NLCS. The fierceness of their matchups against the Mets are due to the geographic New York-Philadelphia rivalry, which is also seen in other sports.

===New York Mets===
The rivalry between the New York Mets and the Phillies has been said to be among the &quot;hottest&quot; rivalries in the National League. The two National League East divisional rivals have met each other recently in playoff, division, and wild card races.

Aside from several brawls in the 1980s, the rivalry remained low-key before the 2006 season, as the teams had seldom been equally good at the same time. Since 2006, the teams have battled for playoff position. The Mets won the division in 2006 and contended in 2007 and 2008, while the Phillies won five consecutive division titles from 2007 to 2011. The Phillies&#x27; 2007 Eastern Division Title was won on the last day of the season as the Mets lost a seven-game lead with 17 games remaining.

There is a long-standing bitter rivalry between the sports fans from New York City and Philadelphia, which are approximately two hours apart by car, seen also between the New York Giants and the Philadelphia Eagles in the National Football League, and the New York Rangers and the Philadelphia Flyers in National Hockey League. Games between the two teams at Citi Field and Citizens Bank Park are often very intense, hard-hitting affairs, as each home crowd does its best to create an unfriendly, sometimes volatile atmosphere for any visiting-team fans.

===Pittsburgh Pirates===

The rivalry between the Phillies and the Pittsburgh Pirates was considered by some to be one of the best rivalries in the National League. The rivalry started when the Pittsburgh Pirates entered National League play in their fifth season of 1887, four years after the Phillies.

The Phillies and the Pirates had remained together after the National League split into two divisions in 1969. During the period of two-division play (1969–1993), the two National League East division rivals won the two highest numbers of division championships, reigning exclusively as NL East champions in the 1970s and again in the early 1990s, the Pirates nine, the Phillies six; together, the teams&#x27; 15 championships accounted for more than half of the 25 NL East championships during that span.

After the Pirates moved to the National League Central in 1994, the teams face each other in only two series each year and the rivalry has diminished. However, many fans, especially older ones, retain their dislike for the other team and regional differences between Eastern and Western Pennsylvania still fuel the rivalry. The rivalry between the Philadelphia Flyers and the Pittsburgh Penguins in the National Hockey League is also fiercely contested.

===Washington Nationals/Montreal Expos===
The Phillies&#x27; rivalry with the Washington Nationals extends back during their original tenure as the Montreal Expos. The two teams repeatedly battled for control of the division in the early 1980s and mid 1990s. Following the franchise&#x27;s relocation to Washington DC in 2005; the rivalry increased in geographic tension due to Washington&#x27;s proximity to Philadelphia. The rivalry quickly spiked in intensity during the 2010s after Nationals team management introduced a campaign to block Phillies fans from overtaking home games. In 2019; star-outfielder Bryce Harper further fueled tensions after signing a 13-year $330 million contract with the Phillies as a free agent. The Nationals later managed to win the 2019 World Series during the first year of Harper&#x27;s absence. The Phillies currently lead the series 482–445, but the Nationals lead the postseason series; when the Expos managed a 3–2 victory over the Phillies during the 1981 NLDS.

The rivalry is also mirrored in the Philadelphia-Washington rivalry, which is also seen in other sports, like between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Washington Commanders and the Philadelphia Flyers and the Washington Capitals. The two cities are approximately two and a half hours apart by car.

=== Historical rivalries ===

====City Series: Philadelphia Athletics====

The City Series was the name of a series of baseball games played between the Philadelphia Athletics of the American League and the Phillies that ran from 1903 through 1955. After the A&#x27;s move to Kansas City, Missouri in 1955, the City Series rivalry came to an end. The teams have since faced each other in Interleague play (since its introduction in 1997) but the rivalry has effectively died in the intervening years since the A&#x27;s left Philadelphia. In 2014, when the A&#x27;s faced the Phillies in inter-league play at Oakland Coliseum, the Athletics did not bother to mark the historical connection, going so far as to have a Connie Mack promotion the day before the series while the Texas Rangers were in Oakland.

The first City Series was held in 1883 between the Phillies and the American Association&#x27;s Athletics. When the Athletics first joined the American League, the two teams played each other in a spring and fall series. No City Series was held in 1901 and 1902 due to legal warring between the National and American Leagues.

==Roster==
==Team records==
==Team managers==

Over 126 seasons, the Phillies&#x27; franchise has employed 55 managers. The duties of the team manager include team strategy and leadership on and off the field. Seven managers have taken the Phillies to the postseason, with Danny Ozark and Charlie Manuel each leading the team to at least three playoff appearances. Manuel and Dallas Green are the only Phillies&#x27; managers to win a World Series: Green in 1980 against the Kansas City Royals; and Manuel in 2008 against the Tampa Bay Rays. Charlie Manuel is the longest-tenured manager in franchise history, with 1,416 games of service in parts of nine seasons (2005–2013). The records and accomplishments of Phillies&#x27; managers since 1991 are shown below 

==Achievements==
===Awards===

Six Phillies have won Most Valuable Player Awards during their career with the team. Mike Schmidt leads with three wins, with back-to-back MVPs in 1980 and 1981, and in 1986 as well. Chuck Klein (1932), Jim Konstanty (1950), Ryan Howard (2006), Jimmy Rollins (2007), and Bryce Harper (2021) all have one. Pitcher Steve Carlton leads the team in Cy Young Award wins with four (1972, 1977, 1980, and 1982), while John Denny (1983), Steve Bedrosian (1987), and Roy Halladay (2010) each have one. Four Phillies have won Rookie of the Year honors as well. Jack Sanford won in 1957, Dick Allen in 1964. Third baseman Scott Rolen brought home the honors in 1997, while Howard was the most recent Phillies&#x27; winner in 2005. In doing so, Howard became only the second player in MLB history to win Rookie of the Year and Most Valuable Player in consecutive years, Cal Ripken Jr. of the Baltimore Orioles being the first.

Of the 18 players who have hit four home runs in one game, three were Phillies at the time (more than any other team). Ed Delahanty was the first, hitting his four in Chicago&#x27;s West Side Park on July 13, 1896. Chuck Klein repeated the feat nearly 40 years later to the day, on July 10, 1936, at Pittsburgh&#x27;s Forbes Field. Forty years later, on April 17, 1976, Mike Schmidt became the third, with his hits in Chicago at Wrigley Field.

===Hall of Famers===

===Ford C. Frick Award recipients===


===Retired numbers and other honors===

The Phillies have retired eight numbers, and honored two additional players with the letter &quot;P&quot; which stands for the team&#x27;s name. Grover Cleveland Alexander played with the team in the era before Major League Baseball used uniform numbers, and Chuck Klein wore a variety of numbers with the team during his career. Of the eight players with retired numbers, seven were retired for their play with the Phillies and one, 42, was universally retired by Major League Baseball when they honored the 50th anniversary of Jackie Robinson&#x27;s breaking the color barrier. 

===Wall of Fame===

The Wall of Fame was located in Ashburn Alley at Citizens Bank Park from the stadium&#x27;s opening in 2004 to 2017. In 2018, the exhibit was moved to a new plaza between the left-field scoreboard and the left-field entrance of the stadium.

The Phillies Wall of Fame was started in 1978 as the Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame. Until 2004, the Phillies inducted one former Phillie and one former member of the Philadelphia Athletics per year. Since 2004, they have only inducted one Phillie annually (with the exception of 2022 and 2023, when they inducted two and three Phillies, respectively). Eligible players must be retired and must have played at least four years with the Phillies. The Phillies&#x27; inductees to the Wall of Fame are listed below (note that there was no inductee for the 2017 season, as Pete Rose was planned to be inducted, but was not due to controversial allegations):



&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

====Centennial Team====
In 1983, rather than inducting a player into the Wall of Fame, the Phillies selected their Centennial Team, commemorating the best players of the first 100 years in franchise history.
===Philadelphia Sports Hall of Fame===

===Team captains===
*Jimmie Wilson 1927–1928
*Fresco Thompson 1928–1930
*Granny Hamner 1952–1959
*Mike Schmidt 1978–1979

==Minor league affiliations==
The Philadelphia Phillies farm system consists of seven minor league affiliates.

==Radio and television==
As of 2024, the Phillies&#x27; flagship radio stations is WIP-FM (94.1 FM), formerly owned by CBS Radio, but since November 2017, is owned by Philadelphia-area company Audacy. The broadcasts were discontinued on the former AM flagship station WPHT 1210 in 2016. Scott Franzke provides play-by-play on the radio, with Larry Andersen and Kevin Stocker as color commentators. Meanwhile, NBCUniversal (a unit of Philadelphia-based Comcast) handles local television broadcasts through its properties NBC Sports Philadelphia and WCAU (NBC Channel 10). WCAU broadcasts are syndicated to WHP-DT2 in Harrisburg and WQMY-TV in Wilkes-Barre. Tom McCarthy calls play-by-play for the television broadcasts, with John Kruk, Rubén Amaro Jr., Ben Davis, Cole Hamels, and Mike Schmidt providing color commentary.

Spanish language broadcasts are on WTTM (1680 AM) with Oscar Budejen or Angel Castillo on play-by-play, and Bill Kulik on color commentary.

Other popular Phillies broadcasters through the years include By Saam (1939–1975), Bill Campbell (1962–1970), Richie Ashburn (1963–1997), and Harry Kalas (1971–2009). Kalas, a 2002 recipient of the Ford Frick Award and an icon in the Philadelphia area, called play-by-play in the first three and last three innings on television and the fourth inning on the radio until his death on April 13, 2009.

At Citizens Bank Park, the restaurant built into the base of the main scoreboard is named &quot;Harry the K&#x27;s&quot; in Kalas&#x27; honor. After his death, the Phillies&#x27; TV broadcast booth was renamed &quot;The Harry Kalas Broadcast Booth&quot;. It is directly next to the radio-broadcast booth, which is named &quot;The Richie &#x27;Whitey&#x27; Ashburn Broadcast Booth.&quot; When the Phillies win at home, Kalas&#x27; rendition of the song &quot;High Hopes,&quot; which he would sing when the Phillies had clinched a playoff berth or advanced in the playoffs, is played as fans file out of the stadium. In addition, when a Phillies player hits a home run, a recording of Kalas&#x27; famous &quot;That ball is outta here!&quot; home run call is played. The sole exception is Chase Utley, once the subject of another famous Kalas call, &quot;Chase Utley, you are The Man!&quot;, which was played when Utley hit a homer.

In 2011, the Phillies unveiled a statue of Harry Kalas at Citizens Bank Park. It was funded by Phillies&#x27; fans and designed and constructed by a Phillies&#x27; fan.

The Phillies&#x27; public-address (PA) announcer is Dan Baker, who started in the 1972 season.

In 2011, the Phillies spent $10 million to upgrade the video system at Citizens Bank Park, including a new display screen in left field, making it the largest in the National League at 76 feet high and 97 feet wide. In 2023, the Phillies once again upgraded their left field display screen by installing a 4K HDR screen that is 77% larger than the previous one, measuring at 86 feet high and 152 feet wide.

==Community==
===Charitable contributions===
Since 1984, the Phillies have supported research related to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig&#x27;s disease) with the &quot;Phillies Phestival&quot;. The team raised over US$750,000 for ALS research at their 2008 festival, compared with approximately $4,500 at the inaugural event in 1984; the event has raised over $10 million in its history. The ALS Association of Philadelphia is the Phillies&#x27; primary charity, and the hospitals they support include Pennsylvania Hospital, Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, and Hahnemann University Hospital. Former Phillies&#x27; pitchers Geoff Geary, who lost a friend to the disease, and Curt Schilling, who retired with the Boston Red Sox, are still involved with the Phillies&#x27; cause.

===Education and anti-drug programs===
The Phillies have a reading incentive program called Phanatic About Reading, which is designed to encourage students from kindergarten to eighth grade to read for a minimum of 15 minutes a night. This reading program is designed to help students with their literacy skills and comprehension. Phillies Phundamentals is another educational program, offered through after-school and summer camps, that is designed to make learning fun and support academic skills by using baseball.

The Phillies celebrate teachers during their annual Teacher Appreciation Night.

The &quot;Cut Out Overdoses&quot; anti-drug campaign, sponsored by Mothers Against Prescription Drug Abuse (MAPDA) and Emergent Biosolutions, manufacturer of the overdose antagonist Narcan, highlights the drug overdose problem through special communications programs at Citizens Bank Park, home of the Phillies. (There are identical programs supported by both the Boston Red Sox and Cincinnati Reds.) In 2020, the stadium, fan-empty due to the coronavirus pandemic, featured &quot;cut-out&quot; cardboard figures of fans filling the stands. Clicking on one of the silhouettes leads to the anguished story of the overdose death of an individual, written by family members. The story also encourages readers to take a stand by learning more about opioid-reversal medication and making a donation to MAPDA. The site reports that an American dies from an accidental opioid overdose every 15 minutes, over 35,000 people annually.

===Fan support and reputation===

Phillies&#x27; fans have earned a reputation over the years for their occasional unruly behavior. In the 1960s, radio announcers for visiting teams would frequently report on the numerous fights breaking out in Connie Mack Stadium. Immediately after the final game at the old park, many fans ran onto the field or dislodged parts of the ballpark to take home with them. Later, at Veterans Stadium, the 700 Level gained a reputation for its &quot;hostile taunting, fighting, public urination and general strangeness&quot;. Phillies fans are famously known for their reputation for being the &quot;Meanest Fans in America&quot;.

Phillies&#x27; fans are known for harsh criticism of their own stars such the 1964 Rookie of the Year Dick Allen and Hall of Fame third baseman Mike Schmidt. The fans, however, are just as well known for heckling the visiting team. Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Burt Hooton&#x27;s poor performance during game three of the 1977 NLCS has often been attributed to the crowd&#x27;s taunting. J. D. Drew, the Phillies&#x27; first overall draft pick in the amateur draft of 1997, never signed with the Phillies following a contract dispute with the team, instead re-entering the draft the next year to be drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals. Phillies fans were angered over this disrespect and hurled debris, including two D batteries, at Drew during an August 1999 game.

Many sportswriters have noted the passionate presence of Phillies fans. Allen Barra wrote that the biggest roar he ever heard from Philadelphia fans was in 1980 when Tug McGraw, in the victory parade after the World Series, told New York fans they could &quot;take this championship and shove it.&quot;

When the Phillies moved to Veterans Stadium, they hired a group of young ladies to serve as ushers. These women wore maroon-colored outfits featuring hot pants and were called the Hot Pants Patrol. The team also introduced a pair of mascots attired in colonial garb, named Philadelphia Phil and Phyllis. In addition to costumed characters, animated Phil and Phyllis figures mounted on the center-field facade would &quot;hit&quot; the Liberty Bell after a Phillies home run. This pair of mascots never achieved any significant level of popularity with fans and were eventually discontinued. In 1978, the team introduced a new mascot, the Phillie Phanatic, who has been called &quot;baseball&#x27;s best mascot&quot;, which has been much more successful and has become closely associated with the marketing of the team.

At a game in the 1970s, the Phillies had an Easter Day promotion known as the &quot;highest-jumping Easter Bunny.&quot; The plan was for the Easter Bunny, who was given $1,000 and placed in a hot air balloon, to be flown out of Veterans Stadium before the Phillies game. The first fan to find the balloon would get the cash prize. However, the balloon only went three feet in the air before crashing to the ground. As he left the field, the Phillies&#x27; fans booed the Easter Bunny.

In Phillies&#x27; fan culture, it is also not unusual to replace an &quot;f&quot; with a &quot;ph&quot; in words, such as the Phillie Phanatic.

The club surpassed 100 consecutive sellouts on August 19, 2010, selling out over 50% of their home games and averaging an annual attendance of over 3.1 million fans since moving to Citizens Bank Park; on April 3, 2011, the team broke the three-game series attendance record at the ballpark, having 136,254 fans attend the opening weekend against the Houston Astros.

In 2011 and 2012, the Phillies led the league in attendance with 3,680,718 and 3,565,718 fans, respectively, coming out to watch Phillies baseball.

The Phillies now boast active international support groups on social media, with a Philadelphia Phillies&#x27; UK Facebook group starting in August 2015 and UK Phillies&#x27; Twitter account created in May 2017. In March 2018 a Phillies&#x27; France account launched in French.

<text>The Phanerozoic is the current and the latest of the four geologic eons in the Earth&#x27;s geologic time scale, covering the time period from 538.8 million years ago to the present. It is the eon during which abundant animal and plant life has proliferated, diversified and colonized various niches on the Earth&#x27;s surface, beginning with the Cambrian period when animals first developed hard shells that can be clearly preserved in the fossil record. The time before the Phanerozoic, collectively called the &quot;Precambrian&quot;, is now divided into the Hadean, Archaean and Proterozoic eons.

The time span of the Phanerozoic starts with the sudden appearance of fossilised evidence of a number of animal phyla; the evolution of those phyla into diverse forms; the evolution of plants; the evolution of fish, arthropods and molluscs; the terrestrial colonization and evolution of insects, chelicerates, myriapods and tetrapods; and the development of modern flora dominated by vascular plants. During this time span, tectonic forces which move the continents had collected them into a single landmass known as Pangaea (the most recent supercontinent), which then separated into the current continental landmasses.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;Phanerozoic&quot; was coined in 1930 by the American geologist George Halcott Chadwick (1876–1953), deriving from the Ancient Greek words (), meaning &quot;visible&quot;; and (), meaning &quot;life&quot;. This is because it was once believed that life began in the Cambrian, the first period of this eon, due to the lack of Precambrian fossil record back then. However, trace fossils of booming complex life from the Ediacaran period (Avalon explosion) of the preceding Proterozoic eon have since been discovered, and the modern scientific consensus now agrees that complex life (in the form of placozoans and primitive sponges such as &quot;Otavia&quot;) has existed at least since the Tonian period and the earliest known life forms (in the form of simple prokaryotic microbial mats) started in the ocean floor during the earlier Archean eon.

==Proterozoic–Phanerozoic boundary==

The Proterozoic–Phanerozoic boundary is at 538.8 million years ago. In the 19th century, the boundary was set at time of appearance of the first abundant animal (metazoan) fossils, but trace fossils of several hundred groups (taxa) of complex soft-bodied metazoa from the preceding Ediacaran period of the Proterozoic eon, known as the Avalon Explosion, have been identified since the systematic study of those forms started in the 1950s. The transition from the largely sessile Precambrian biota to the active mobile Cambrian biota occurred early in the Phanerozoic.

==Eras of the Phanerozoic==
The Phanerozoic is divided into three eras: the Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic, which are further subdivided into 12 periods. The Paleozoic features the evolution of the three most prominent animal phyla, arthropods, molluscs and chordates, the last of which includes fish, amphibians and the fully terrestrial amniotes (synapsids and sauropsids). The Mesozoic features the evolution of crocodilians, turtles, dinosaurs (including birds), lepidosaurs (lizards and snakes) and mammals. The Cenozoic begins with the extinction of all non-avian dinosaurs, pterosaurs and marine reptiles, and features the great diversification in birds and mammals. Humans appeared and evolved during the most recent part of the Cenozoic.

===Paleozoic Era===

The Paleozoic is a time in Earth&#x27;s history when active complex life forms evolved, took their first foothold on dry land, and when the forerunners of all multicellular life on Earth began to diversify. There are six periods in the Paleozoic era: Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous and Permian.

====Cambrian Period====
The Cambrian is the first period of the Paleozoic Era and ran from 539 million to 485 million years ago. The Cambrian sparked a rapid expansion in the diversity of animals, in an event known as the Cambrian explosion, during which the greatest number of animal body plans evolved in a single period in the history of Earth. Complex algae evolved, and the fauna was dominated by armoured arthropods (such as trilobites and radiodontids) and to a lesser extent shelled cephalopods (such as orthocones). Almost all phyla of marine animals evolved in this period. During this time, the super-continent Pannotia began to break up, most of which later recombined into the super-continent Gondwana.

====Ordovician Period====

The Ordovician spans from 485 million to 444 million years ago. The Ordovician was a time in Earth&#x27;s history in which many groups still prevalent today evolved or diversified, such as primitive nautiloids, vertebrates (then only jawless fish) and corals. This process is known as the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event or GOBE. Trilobites began to be replaced by articulate brachiopods, and crinoids also became an increasingly important part of the fauna. The first arthropods crept ashore to colonise Gondwana, a continent empty of animal life. A group of freshwater green algae, the streptophytes, also survived being washed ashore and began to colonize the flood plains and riparian zones, giving rise to primitive land plants.

By the end of the Ordovician, Gondwana had moved from the equator to the South Pole, and Laurentia had collided with Baltica, closing the Iapetus Ocean. The glaciation of Gondwana resulted in a major drop in sea level, killing off all life that had established along its coast. Glaciation caused an icehouse Earth, leading to the Ordovician–Silurian extinction, during which 60% of marine invertebrates and 25% of families became extinct. Though one of the deadliest mass extinctions in earth&#x27;s history, the O–S extinction did not cause profound ecological changes between the periods.

====Silurian Period====
The Silurian spans from 444 million to 419 million years ago, which saw a warming from an icehouse Earth. This period saw the mass diversification of fish, as jawless fish became more numerous, and early jawed fish and freshwater species appeared in the fossil record. Arthropods remained abundant, and some groups, such as eurypterids, became apex predators in the ocean. Fully terrestrial life established itself on land, including early fungi, arachnids, hexapods and myriapods. The evolution of vascular plants (mainly spore-producing ferns such as &quot;Cooksonia&quot;) allowed land plants to gain a foothold further inland as well. During this time, there were four continents: Gondwana (Africa, South America, Australia, Antarctica, India), Laurentia (North America with parts of Europe), Baltica (the rest of Europe), and Siberia (Northern Asia).

====Devonian Period====
The Devonian spans from 419 million to 359 million years ago. Also informally known as the &quot;Age of the Fish&quot;, the Devonian features a huge diversification in fish such as the jawless conodonts and ostracoderms, as well as jawed fish such as the armored placoderms (e.g. &quot;Dunkleosteus&quot;), the spiny acanthodians and early bony fish. The Devonian also saw the primitive appearance of modern fish groups such as chondricthyans (cartilaginous fish) and osteichthyans (bony fish), the latter of which include two clades — the actinopterygians (ray-finned fish) and sarcopterygians (lobe-finned fish). One lineage of sarcopterygians, Rhipidistia, evolved the first four-limbed vertebrates, which would eventually become tetrapods. On land, plant groups diversified after the Silurian-Devonian Terrestrial Revolution; the first woody ferns and the earliest seed plants evolved during this period. By the Middle Devonian, shrub-like forests existed: lycophytes, horsetails and progymnosperm. This greening event also allowed the diversification of arthropods as they took advantage of the new habitat. Near the end of the Devonian, 70% of all species became extinct in a sequence of mass extinction events, collectively known as the Late Devonian extinction.

====Carboniferous Period====
The Carboniferous spans from 359 million to 299 million years ago. Tropical swamps dominated the Earth, and the large amounts of trees sequestered much of the carbon that became coal deposits (hence the name Carboniferous and the term &quot;coal forest&quot;). About 90% of all coal beds were deposited in the Carboniferous and Permian periods, which represent just 2% of the Earth&#x27;s geologic history. The high oxygen levels caused by these wetland rainforests allowed arthropods, normally limited in size by their respiratory systems, to proliferate and increase in size. Tetrapods also diversified during the Carboniferous as semiaquatic amphibians such as the temnospondyls, and one lineage developed extraembryonic membranes that allowed their eggs to survive outside of the water. These tetrapods, the amniotes, included the first sauropsids (which evolved the reptiles, dinosaurs and birds) and synapsids (the ancestors of mammal). Throughout the Carboniferous, there was a cooling pattern, which eventually led to the glaciation of Gondwana as much of it was situated around the South Pole. This event was known as the Permo-Carboniferous Glaciation and resulted in a major loss of coal forests, known as the Carboniferous rainforest collapse.

====Permian Period====
The Permian spans from 299 million to 251 million years ago and was the last period of the Paleozoic era. At its beginning, all landmasses came together to form the supercontinent Pangaea, surrounded by one expansive ocean called Panthalassa. The Earth was relatively dry compared to the Carboniferous, with harsh seasons, as the climate of the interior of Pangaea was not moderated by large bodies of water. Amniotes still flourished and diversified in the new dry climate, particularly synapsids such as &quot;Dimetrodon,&quot; &quot;Edaphosaurus&quot; and therapsids, which gave rise to the ancestors of modern mammals. The first conifers evolved during this period, then dominated the terrestrial landscape. The Permian ended with at least one mass extinction, an event sometimes known as &quot;the Great Dying&quot;, caused by large floods of lava (the Siberian Traps in Russia and the Emeishan Traps in China). This extinction was the largest in Earth&#x27;s history and led to the loss of 95% of all species of life.

===Mesozoic Era===

The Mesozoic ranges from 252 million to 66 million years ago. Also referred to as the Age of Reptiles, Age of Dinosaurs or Age of Conifers, the Mesozoic featured the first time the sauropsids ascended to ecological dominance over the synapsids, as well as the diversification of many modern ray-finned fish, insects, molluscs (particularly the coleoids), tetrapods and plants. The Mesozoic is subdivided into three periods: the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous.

====Triassic Period====

The Triassic ranges from 252 million to 201 million years ago. The Triassic is mostly a transitional recovery period between the desolate aftermath of the Permian Extinction and the lush Jurassic Period. It has three major epochs: Early Triassic, Middle Triassic, and Late Triassic.

The Early Triassic lasted between 252 million to 247 million years ago, and was a hot and arid epoch in the aftermath of the Permian Extinction. Many tetrapods during this epoch represented a disaster fauna, a group of survivor animals with low diversity and cosmopolitanism (wide geographic ranges). Temnospondyli recovered first and evolved into large aquatic predators during the Triassic. Other reptiles also diversified rapidly, with aquatic reptiles such as ichthyosaurs and sauropterygians proliferating in the seas. On land, the first true archosaurs appeared, including pseudosuchians (crocodile relatives) and avemetatarsalians (bird/dinosaur relatives).
The Middle Triassic spans from 247 million to 237 million years ago. The Middle Triassic featured the beginnings of the break-up of Pangaea as rifting commenced in north Pangaea. The northern part of the Tethys Ocean, the Paleotethys Ocean, had become a passive basin, but a spreading center was active in the southern part of the Tethys Ocean, the Neotethys Ocean. Phytoplankton, coral, crustaceans and many other marine invertebrates recovered from the Permian extinction by the end of the Middle Triassic. Meanwhile, on land, reptiles continued to diversify, conifer forests flourished, as well as the first flies.

The Late Triassic spans from 237 million to 201 million years ago. Following the bloom of the Middle Triassic, the Late Triassic was initially warm and arid with a strong monsoon climate and with most precipitation limited to coastal regions and high latitudes. This changed late in the Carnian period with a 2 million years-long wet season which transformed the arid continental interior into lush alluvial forests. The first true dinosaurs appeared early in the Late Triassic, and pterosaurs evolved a bit later. Other large reptilian competitors to the dinosaurs were wiped out by the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event, in which most archosaurs (excluding crocodylomorphs, pterosaurs and dinosaurs), most therapsids (except cynodonts) and almost all large amphibians became extinct, as well as 34% of marine life in the fourth mass extinction event. The cause of the extinction is debated, but likely resulted from eruptions of the CAMP large igneous province.

====Jurassic Period====
The Jurassic ranges from 201 million to 145 million years ago, and features three major epochs: Early Jurassic, Middle Jurassic and Late Jurassic.

The Early Jurassic epoch spans from 201 million to 174 million years ago. The climate was much more humid than during the Triassic, and as a result, the world was warm and partially tropical, though possibly with short colder intervals. Plesiosaurs, ichthyosaurs and ammonites dominated the seas, while dinosaurs, pterysaurs and other reptiles dominated the land, with species such as &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot; at the apex. Crocodylomorphs evolved into aquatic forms, pushing the remaining large amphibians to near extinction. True mammals were present during the Jurassic but remained small, with average body masses of less than until the end of the Cretaceous.
The Middle and Late Jurassic Epochs span from 174 million to 145 million years ago. Conifer savannahs made up a large portion of the world&#x27;s forests. In the oceans, plesiosaurs were quite common, and ichthyosaurs were flourishing. The Late Jurassic Epoch spans from 163 million to 145 million years ago. The Late Jurassic featured a severe extinction of sauropods in northern continents, alongside many ichthyosaurs. However, the Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary did not strongly impact most forms of life.

====Cretaceous Period====

The Cretaceous is the Phanerozoic&#x27;s longest period and the last period of the Mesozoic. It spans from 145 million to 66 million years ago, and is divided into two epochs: Early Cretaceous, and Late Cretaceous.
The Early Cretaceous Epoch spans from 145 million to 100 million years ago. Dinosaurs continued to be abundant, with groups such as tyrannosauroids, avialans (birds), marginocephalians, and ornithopods seeing early glimpses of later success. Other tetrapods, such as stegosaurs and ichthyosaurs, declined significantly, and sauropods were restricted to southern continents.

The Late Cretaceous Epoch spans from 100 million to 66 million years ago. The Late Cretaceous featured a cooling trend that would continue into the Cenozoic Era. Eventually, the tropical climate was restricted to the equator and areas beyond the tropic lines featured more seasonal climates. Dinosaurs still thrived as new species such as &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot;, &quot;Triceratops&quot; and hadrosaurs dominated the food web. Whether or not pterosaurs went into a decline as birds radiated is debated; however, many families survived until the end of the Cretaceous, alongside new forms such as the gigantic &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot;. Mammals diversified despite their small sizes, with metatherians (marsupials and kin) and eutherians (placentals and kin) coming into their own. In the oceans, mosasaurs diversified to fill the role of the now-extinct ichthyosaurs, alongside huge plesiosaurs such as &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot;. Also, the first flowering plants evolved. At the end of the Cretaceous, the Deccan Traps and other volcanic eruptions were poisoning the atmosphere. As this was continued, it is thought that a large meteor smashed into Earth, creating the Chicxulub Crater and causing the event known as the K–Pg extinction, the fifth and most recent mass extinction event, during which 75% of life on Earth became extinct, including all non-avian dinosaurs. Every living thing with a body mass over 10 kilograms became extinct, and the Age of Dinosaurs came to an end.

===Cenozoic Era===

The Cenozoic featured the rise of mammals and birds as the dominant class of animals, as the end of the Age of Dinosaurs left significant open niches. There are three divisions of the Cenozoic: Paleogene, Neogene and Quaternary.

====Paleogene Period====

The Paleogene spans from the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs, some 66 million years ago, to the dawn of the Neogene 23 million years ago. It features three epochs: Paleocene, Eocene and Oligocene.

The Paleocene Epoch began with the K–Pg extinction event, and the early part of the Paleocene saw the recovery of the Earth from that event. The continents began to take their modern shapes, but most continents (and India) remained separated from each other: Africa and Eurasia were separated by the Tethys Sea, and the Americas were separated by the Panamanic Seaway (as the Isthmus of Panama had not yet formed). This epoch featured a general warming trend that peaked at the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, and the earliest modern jungles expanded, eventually reaching the poles. The oceans were dominated by sharks, as the large reptiles that had once ruled had become extinct. Mammals diversified rapidly, but most remained small. The largest tetrapod carnivores during the Paleocene were reptiles, including crocodyliforms, choristoderans and snakes. &quot;Titanoboa&quot;, the largest known snake, lived in South America during the Paleocene.

The Eocene Epoch ranged from 56 million to 34 million years ago. In the early Eocene, most land mammals were small and living in cramped jungles, much like the Paleocene. Among them were early primates, whales and horses along with many other early forms of mammals. The climate was warm and humid, with little temperature gradient from pole to pole. In the Middle Eocene Epoch, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current formed when South America and Australia both separated from Antarctica to open up the Drake Passage and Tasmanian Passage, disrupting ocean currents worldwide, resulting in global cooling and causing the jungles to shrink. More modern forms of mammals continued to diversify with the cooling climate even as more archaic forms died out. By the end of the Eocene, whales such as &quot;Basilosaurus&quot; had become fully aquatic. The late Eocene Epoch saw the rebirth of seasons, which caused the expansion of savanna-like areas with the earliest substantial grasslands. At the transition between the Eocene and Oligocene epochs there was a significant extinction event, the cause of which is debated.

The Oligocene Epoch spans from 34 million to 23 million years ago. The Oligocene was an important transitional period between the tropical world of the Eocene and more modern ecosystems. This period featured a global expansion of grass which led to many new species taking advantage, including the first elephants, felines, canines, marsupials and many other species still prevalent today. Many other species of plants evolved during this epoch also, such as the evergreen trees. The long term cooling continued and seasonal rain patterns established. Mammals continued to grow larger. &quot;Paraceratherium&quot;, one of the largest land mammals to ever live, evolved during this epoch, along with many other perissodactyls.

====Neogene Period====

The Neogene spans from 23.03 million to 2.58 million years ago. It features two epochs: the Miocene and the Pliocene.

The Miocene spans from 23.03 million to 5.333 million years ago and is a period in which grass spread further across, effectively dominating a large portion of the world, diminishing forests in the process. Kelp forests evolved, leading to the evolution of new species such as sea otters. During this time, perissodactyls thrived, and evolved into many different varieties. Alongside them were the apes, which evolved into 30 species. Overall, arid and mountainous land dominated most of the world, as did grazers. The Tethys Sea finally closed with the creation of the Arabian Peninsula and in its wake left the Black, Red, Mediterranean and Caspian seas. This only increased aridity. Many new plants evolved, and 95% of modern seed plants evolved in the mid-Miocene.

The Pliocene lasted from 5.333 million to 2.58 million years ago. The Pliocene featured dramatic climatic changes, which ultimately led to modern species and plants. The Mediterranean Sea dried up for hundreds of thousand years in the Messinian salinity crisis. Along with these major geological events, Africa saw the appearance of &quot;Australopithecus&quot;, the ancestor of &quot;Homo&quot;. The Isthmus of Panama formed, and animals migrated between North and South America, wreaking havoc on the local ecology. Climatic changes brought savannas that are still continuing to spread across the world, Indian monsoons, deserts in East Asia, and the beginnings of the Sahara Desert. The Earth&#x27;s continents and seas moved into their present shapes. The world map has not changed much since, save for changes brought about by the Quaternary glaciation such as Lake Agassiz (precursor of the Great Lakes).

====Quaternary Period====
The Quaternary spans from 2.58 million years ago to present day, and is the shortest geological period in the Phanerozoic Eon. It features modern animals, and dramatic changes in the climate. It is divided into two epochs: the Pleistocene and the Holocene.

The Pleistocene lasted from 2.58 million to 11,700 years ago. This epoch was marked by a series of glacial periods (ice ages) as a result of the cooling trend that started in the mid-Eocene. There were numerous separate glaciation periods marked by the advance of ice caps as far south as 40 degrees N latitude in mountainous areas. Meanwhile, Africa experienced a trend of desiccation which resulted in the creation of the Sahara, Namib and Kalahari deserts. Mammoths, giant ground sloths, dire wolves, sabre-toothed cats and archaic humans such as &quot;Homo erectus&quot; were common and widespread during the Pleistocene. A more anatomically modern human, &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;, began migrating out of East Africa in at least two waves, the first being as early as 270,000 years ago. After a supervolcano eruption in Sumatra 74,000 years ago caused a global population bottleneck of humans, a second wave of &quot;Homo sapiens &quot; migration successfully repopulated every continents except Antarctica. As the Pleistocene drew to a close, a major extinction wiped out much of the world&#x27;s megafauna, including non-&quot;Homo sapiens&quot; human species such as &quot;Homo neanderthalensis&quot; and &quot;Homo floresiensis&quot;. All the continents were affected, but Africa was impacted to a lesser extent and retained many large animals such as elephants, rhinoceros and hippopotamus. The extent to which &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; were involved in this megafaunal extinction is debated.

The Holocene began 11,700 years ago at the end of Younger Dryas and lasts until the present day. All recorded history and so-called &quot;human history&quot; lies within the boundaries of the Holocene epoch. Human activity is blamed for an ongoing mass extinction that began roughly 10,000 years ago, though the species becoming extinct have only been recorded since the Industrial Revolution. This is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Sixth Extinction&quot; with hundreds of species gone extinct due to human activities such as overhunting, habitat destruction and introduction of invasive species.

==Biodiversity==

It has been demonstrated that changes in biodiversity through the Phanerozoic correlate much better with the hyperbolic model (widely used in demography and macrosociology) than with exponential and logistic models (traditionally used in population biology and extensively applied to fossil biodiversity as well). The latter models imply that changes in diversity are guided by a first-order positive feedback (more ancestors, more descendants) or a negative feedback that arises from resource limitation, or both. The hyperbolic model implies a second-order positive feedback. The hyperbolic pattern of the human population growth arises from quadratic positive feedback, caused by the interaction of the population size and the rate of technological growth. The character of biodiversity growth in the Phanerozoic Eon can be similarly accounted for by a feedback between the diversity and community structure complexity. It has been suggested that the similarity between the curves of biodiversity and human population probably comes from the fact that both are derived from the superposition on the hyperbolic trend of cyclical and random dynamics.

==Climate==
Across the Phanerozoic, the dominant driver of long-term climatic change was the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, though some studies have suggested a decoupling of carbon dioxide and palaeotemperature, particularly during cold intervals of the Phanerozoic. Phanerozoic carbon dioxide concentrations have been governed partially by a 26 million year oceanic crustal cycle. Since the Devonian, large swings in carbon dioxide of 2,000 ppm or more were uncommon over short timescales. Variations in global temperature were limited by negative feedbacks in the phosphorus cycle, wherein increased phosphorus input into the ocean would increase surficial biological productivity that would in turn enhance iron redox cycling and thus remove phosphorus from seawater; this maintained a relatively stable rate of removal of carbon from the atmosphere and ocean via organic carbon burial. The climate also controlled the availability of phosphate through its regulation of rates of continental and seafloor weathering. Major global temperature variations of &gt;7 °C during the Phanerozoic were strongly associated with mass extinctions.

<doc id="23745" wikidata="Q864" url="?curid=23745" title="Pokémon">
<text>is a Japanese media franchise consisting of video games, animated series and films, a trading card game, and other related media. The franchise takes place in a shared universe in which humans co-exist with creatures known as Pokémon, a large variety of species endowed with special powers. The franchise&#x27;s primary target audience is children aged 5 to 12, but it is known to attract people of all ages.

The franchise originated as a pair of role-playing games developed by Game Freak, from an original concept by its founder, Satoshi Tajiri. Released on the Game Boy on 27 February 1996, the games became sleeper hits and were followed by manga series, a trading card game, and anime series and films. From 1998 to 2000, &quot;Pokémon&quot; was exported to the rest of the world, creating an unprecedented global phenomenon dubbed &quot;Pokémania&quot;. By 2002, the craze had ended, after which &quot;Pokémon&quot; became a fixture in popular culture, with new products being released to this day. In the summer of 2016, the franchise spawned a second craze with the release of &quot;Pokémon Go&quot;, an augmented reality game developed by Niantic. &quot;Pokémon&quot; has since been estimated to be the world&#x27;s highest-grossing media franchise and one of the best-selling video game franchises.

&quot;Pokémon&quot; has an uncommon ownership structure. Unlike most IPs, which are owned by one company, &quot;Pokémon&quot; is jointly owned by three: Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. Game Freak develops the core series role-playing games, which are published by Nintendo exclusively for their consoles, while Creatures manages the trading card game and related merchandise, occasionally developing spin-off titles. The three companies established The Pokémon Company (TPC) in 1998 to manage the &quot;Pokémon&quot; property within Asia. The &quot;Pokémon&quot; anime series and films are co-owned by Shogakukan. Since 2009, The Pokémon Company International (TPCi), a subsidiary of TPC, has managed the franchise in all regions outside Asia.

==Name==
The original full name of the franchise is , which has been commonly abbreviated to since its launch. When the franchise was released internationally, the short form of the title was used, with an acute accent (´) over the &quot;e&quot; to aid in pronunciation. As a Japanese word composed of English loanwords, the word &quot;Pokémon&quot; is an example of a &quot;wasei-eigo&quot;.

&quot;Pokémon&quot; refers to both the franchise itself and the creatures within its fictional universe. As a noun, it is identical in both the singular and plural, as is every individual species name; it is grammatically correct to say &quot;one Pokémon&quot; and &quot;many Pokémon&quot;, as well as &quot;one Pikachu&quot; and &quot;many Pikachu&quot;.

==General concept==
The &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise is set in a world in which humans coexist with creatures known as Pokémon. &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; contain 151 Pokémon species, with new ones being added in subsequent games; as of January 2024, 1,025 Pokémon species have been introduced. Most Pokémon are inspired by real-world animals or mythical creatures based on real-life folklore. For example, Pikachu are a yellow, mouse-like species with tails shaped as lightning bolts, able to blast powerful electric jolts through the air.

The player character takes the role of a Pokémon Trainer. The Trainer has three primary goals: travel and explore the Pokémon world; discover and catch each Pokémon species in order to complete their Pokédex; and train a team of up to six Pokémon at a time and have them engage in Pokémon battles. Most Pokémon can be caught with spherical devices known as Poké Balls. Once the opposing Pokémon is sufficiently weakened, the Trainer throws the Poké Ball against the Pokémon, which is then transformed into a form of energy and transported into the device. Once the catch is successful, the Pokémon is tamed and is under the Trainer&#x27;s command from then on. If the Poké Ball is thrown again, the Pokémon re-materializes into its original state. The Trainer&#x27;s Pokémon can engage in battles against opposing Pokémon, including those in the wild or owned by other Trainers. Because the franchise is aimed at children, these battles are never presented as overtly violent and contain no blood or gore. Pokémon never die in battle – they faint upon being defeated, and can then be rejuvenated at a Pokémon Center.

When a Pokémon wins a battle, it gains experience points. After gaining a certain amount of them, the Pokémon levels up, and its statistics rise. As its level increases, the Pokémon learns new offensive and defensive moves to use in battle. Furthermore, many species can undergo a form of spontaneous metamorphosis called Pokémon evolution, and transform into stronger forms. Most Pokémon will evolve at a certain level, while others evolve through different means, such as exposure to a certain item or trading with another trainer.

==History==
===Origins===

The main idea behind &quot;Pokémon&quot; was conceived by Satoshi Tajiri. Tajiri was born on 28 August 1965, and grew up in Machida, a suburb of Tokyo. As a child, he enjoyed discovering and catching insects and other small creatures in the various ponds and fields that surrounded his town. During Japan&#x27;s economic miracle, many cities, including Machida, were significantly expanded. As a consequence, Machida&#x27;s nature was largely destroyed. In his second year of junior high school, an arcade hall opened in Tajiri&#x27;s neighborhood, introducing him to video games. While studying electrical engineering at , Tajiri began publishing a &quot;doujinshi&quot; magazine titled &quot;Game Freak&quot;. The title was inspired by the 1932 film &quot;Freaks&quot;, which Tajiri was fascinated with at the time. He self-published the first issue of the magazine in March 1983, at the age of 17. At the time, magazines specializing in video games did not yet exist in Japan, allowing &quot;Game Freak&quot; to fill a gap in the market. Sometime later, Tajiri was contacted by aspiring manga artist Ken Sugimori, who became &quot;Game Freak&quot;&#x27;s illustrator. &quot;Game Freak&quot; folded in the late 1980s, by which point Tajiri had become a respected game journalist in Japan&#x27;s fledgling video game industry.
Tajiri&#x27;s knowledge of video games brought him into contact with Tsunekazu Ishihara. Ishihara had studied Arts and Science at Tsukuba University, and was trained in CGI. After working in advertising for two years, Ishihara joined a company named Sedic in 1983, which created video graphics and software, including one video game, &quot;Otocky&quot; (1987). As video games grew in popularity, Sedic also produced a number of game-related television shows for Fuji Television&#x27;s late-night slot. In his job as a TV producer, Ishihara befriended Tajiri, as well as Shigesato Itoi, who would later become CEO of Ape, Inc. Ishihara was also the general director of the world&#x27;s first gaming encyclopedia: . Kenji Hatakeyama &amp; Masakazu Kubo (2000) wrote that, at the time, Ishihara was probably the most well-connected man in the industry, with a knowledge of games &quot;beyond comparison&quot;. Ishihara was also interested in playing cards, and contributed to the development of at least three simple card games designed by Itoi and published by Ape.
In 1986, Tajiri, Sugimori, and a few other enthusiasts started an informal development team called Game Freak, named after the magazine it grew out of. Over the next few years, they independently developed the puzzle game &quot;Quinty&quot;, working on it alongside school or their regular jobs. However, no one within the group knew how to make the game&#x27;s music. After consulting all his contacts, Tajiri got in touch with Junichi Masuda, who became the group&#x27;s composer. &quot;Quinty&quot; was finished in 1989, and published by Namco. Tajiri officially incorporated Game Freak Co., Ltd. on 26 April 1989.

===1989–1995: Development of &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Green&quot;===

Tajiri started to think of what was to become &quot;Pokémon&quot; while completing &quot;Quinty&quot;, and before he officially founded Game Freak. Around this time, Nintendo announced the upcoming release of the Game Boy, a handheld console that would revolutionize the gaming industry. Tajiri learned that the device would have a link port, and with the corresponding Game Link Cable, two Game Boys could be linked together. Sometime later, Tajiri remembered an incident while playing &quot;Dragon Quest II&quot; (1987), a role-playing game (RPG) for the Famicom (NES). The game features randomly appearing items of varying rarity, including an extremely rare item called Mysterious Hat. Tajiri did not encounter any, while Ken Sugimori, who was also playing the game, encountered two. Upon recalling this experience, Tajiri realized that the cable now made it possible to transfer things from one cartridge to another. He noted that, until then, the Game Link Cable was only used for competing, but not for something else. Combining this inspiration with his memories of catching insects and other small species, Tajiri&#x27;s idea would eventually evolve into a virtual recreation of his boyhood experiences, and an attempt to &quot;regain the world that he had lost&quot;. He would later state that the game represents &quot;the story of a boy&#x27;s summer day&quot;.

Tajiri and his Game Freak staff began pondering over a game centered on capturing creatures of differing rarity. Since the Game Boy is a portable device, these creatures could then be exchanged with other players in real life using the link cable. Once the player has caught a creature in-game, it was to be stored in miniaturized form in a special capsule. This facet of the game was inspired by &quot;Ultraseven&quot;, a &quot;tokusatsu&quot; show that Tajiri had enjoyed as a child. The series&#x27; titular character owns a number of capsules containing miniaturized &quot;kaiju&quot; (monsters), which come out and return to their original sizes when the capsule is thrown into mid-air. &quot;Kaiju&quot; media in general were an important influence on &quot;Pokemon&quot;, as many Game Freak staff members had grown up with them. Other influences that have been cited by Tajiri include: &quot;gashapon&quot;, capsules with toy figures in them that can be drawn from vending machines; collectible cards, such as baseball cards, &quot;Ultraman&quot; cards and &quot;menko&quot;; &quot;The Final Fantasy Legend&quot; (1989), the first RPG for the Game Boy; and petting in Japan, with Tajiri noting that having Pokemon is similar to having pets. Tajiri initially named his project &quot;Capsule Monsters&quot;, which GF&#x27;s staff commonly shortened to &quot;Capumon&quot;. However, it later turned out that the term &quot;Capsule Monsters&quot; could not be trademarked, and it was subsequently decided to call the game &quot;Pocket Monsters&quot;, which became &quot;Pokemon&quot;. According to Tomisawa (2000), the phrase &quot;Capsule Monsters&quot; was already registered. According to Hatakeyama &amp; Kubo (2000), the word &quot;capsule&quot; could not be used in the trademark. Tomisawa (2000) states that the Game Freak staff then came up with several alternatives, before someone within the team suggested &quot;Pocket Monsters&quot;.
In March 1989, Nintendo co-founded Ape, Inc. with Itoi. Ape&#x27;s principal work was &quot;Mother&quot; (1989), a role-playing game written by Itoi, but it was also founded with the intent to give outside talent a chance to pitch new, innovative games. At the time, Ape was housed in the same Kanda-Sudachō office building as Nintendo, located in Tokyo. Ishihara, a friend of both Itoi and Tajiri, was involved with Ape&#x27;s management (and would become its vice-president in 1991). Tajiri&#x27;s relationship with Ishihara prompted Tajiri to present his idea for &quot;Pocket Monsters&quot; at Ape&#x27;s office. Present during Tajiri&#x27;s pitch was Takashi Kawaguchi, who worked at Nintendo&#x27;s General Affairs Department and was also a manager at Ape. Kawaguchi brought the idea to Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi, who reportedly said: &quot;This is it. This is the idea I&#x27;ve been waiting for.&quot; By pure coincidence, Ishihara had come up with an idea for a game similar to that of Tajiri, and around the same time was discussing it with Ape. This game, &quot;Toto&quot;, involved &quot;using the Game Boy as an insect cage&quot;. Ishihara emphasized, however, that the idea of trading creatures with the link cable was Tajiri&#x27;s. GF and Ape agreed to merge their projects together. According to Tajiri, the two teams initially collaborated on the game, but the work proved difficult, one of the reasons being that Ape was busy developing &quot;EarthBound&quot;. Tajiri eventually figured that &quot;rather than working with Ape, we had to do something on our own, or the project would never get finished&quot;. Ape, Inc. is not credited on the final product.
The development contract was signed at the beginning of 1990, with a planned delivery of the game in October. Tajiri directed the project, working under Ishihara. Ishihara was the producer – he managed the budget, staff, and work schedule, monitored the game&#x27;s overall progress, and served as a liaison between Game Freak and Nintendo. Ishihara also contributed ideas to the development, and helped with debugging. Sugimori was in charge of the graphics and character design. Masuda created all music and sound effects, and did part of the programming. The budget that Nintendo granted to Game Freak was low; thus, &quot;Pocket Monsters&quot; was initially planned as a small, compact game, based primarily around Tajiri&#x27;s core idea of exchanging. However, as development progressed, GF&#x27;s ideas and ambitions for &quot;Pokemon&quot; grew. They soon realized that the game they were beginning to envision would not be easy to make. Sugimori admitted that, at the time, no one at GF had much knowledge of RPGs. &quot;We thought we could handle it, but as we began working, we realized it was going to be tough&quot;, he acknowledged. &quot;Pocket Monsters&quot; was suspended indefinitely, and GF turned their focus on other titles (see ).
After the game&#x27;s initial development phase in 1990 and 1991, the staff &quot;tinkered with it from time to time&quot;, as Sugimori put it. For instance, by October 1992, a large number of Pokemon had been designed, and a poll was held that month among all staff members to gauge the popularity of the different species. Several more such votes followed to determine collectively which Pokemon should be included. Still, development had mostly come to a halt until the summer of 1994, after the release of the platform game &quot;Pulseman&quot;, upon which Tajiri decided it was time to make a serious effort towards finishing &quot;Pocket Monsters&quot;. By this point, Game Freak&#x27;s experience had grown considerably. Over the years, a number of new staff members had been added to the company. One of them was Atsuko Nishida, a graphic artist who created Pikachu, among others. Ishihara used his knowledge of card games to add more depth to the battle system, and among other things suggested Pokemon types. Ishihara also came up with the idea of the Pokedex, a portable encyclopedic device which players can use to keep track of the Pokemon they caught. Throughout the years, Tajiri had several conversations with Shigeru Miyamoto, Nintendo&#x27;s top game designer who Tajiri described as a mentor figure. Although, in a 2018 retrospect, Miyamoto downplayed his role in advising Tajiri, and stated that his contributions to &quot;Pokemon&quot; were in fact limited. Miyamoto did, however, suggest the use of different colored cartridges for the game, in response to Tajiri&#x27;s and Ishihara&#x27;s musings about making each playthrough slightly different, as to &#x27;individualize&#x27; the player&#x27;s experience. According to Tajiri, &quot;five or seven colors&quot; were considered, but they eventually settled on two: &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Green&quot;. Otherwise identical, each had Pokemon not found in the other, encouraging players to socialize and trade to complete their collection.
Ishihara aspired to create video games of his own. As &quot;Pocket Monsters Red&quot; and &quot;Green&quot; were nearing completion, Ishihara founded Creatures, Inc. on 8 November 1995. Upon founding, the company was housed in the same office building as Nintendo in Tokyo. Co-ownership of the &quot;Pokemon&quot; property, which Ishihara helped create, was subsequently assigned to Creatures. This resulted in &quot;Pokemon&quot; having three legal owners: Game Freak, the main developer; Creatures, representing producer Ishihara; and Nintendo, the publisher. Anne Allison (2006) wrote that Nintendo also bought the property after &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Green&quot; were finished. Hatakeyama &amp; Kubo (2000) noted that the ownership structure of &quot;Pokemon&quot; is uncommon. They wrote that &quot;Pokemon is probably the only property in the world today for which the original rights are not concentrated in a single company&quot;, like The Walt Disney Company does with their IPs. Tajiri and Ishihara did consider merging Game Freak and Creatures at one point. However, Tajiri decided against it because he feared it would erase what he had built up since he was a teenager. &quot;I felt threatened by the idea of changing how Game Freak was operating, and starting back over with Mr. Ishihara&quot;, he said. &quot;It was an identity problem. If Game Freak ceased to exist, then so would I&quot;. Tajiri noted that, since Game Freak and Creatures both focus on &quot;Pokemon&quot;, it sometimes felt more like different departments than different companies.
&quot;Pocket Monsters Red&quot; and &quot;Green&quot; were finally finished in December 1995. A release date of 21 December that year was announced, but missed. After sufficient cartridges, manuals and packages had been manufactured, the pair of games ended up being published on 27 February 1996. However, the property was copyrighted in 1995, and &quot;© 1995&quot; is shown on the title screens and cartridges. This year is since used on the copyright notice seen on many &quot;Pokemon&quot; products, even though no actual &quot;Pokemon&quot; product was released in 1995.

===1996–1998: Rise in Japan===

====Release of &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Green&quot;====
Nintendo had no high expectations of &quot;Pocket Monsters Red&quot; and &quot;Green&quot;, and media largely ignored the game(s). By 1996, the seven-year-old Game Boy console was considered yesterday&#x27;s news and near the end of its lifecycle. On the other hand, new Game Boys continued to be manufactured and sold. The console was widespread and, due to its age, affordable to children. Also, the Game Boy had experienced a small revival in Japan in 1995 due to the success of &quot;Mario&#x27;s Picross&quot;. Coincidentally, this game was directed by Ishihara, and co-developed by Ape. The popularity of &quot;Mario&#x27;s Picross&quot; incited Nintendo to develop the Game Boy Pocket, a slimmer and improved version of the Game Boy, released in Japan on 21 July 1996. Because of the timing and naming, some were under the impression that the Game Boy &quot;Pocket&quot; was made to promote &quot;Pocket Monsters&quot;, but this was in fact a coincidence that would end up benefiting both.

====&quot;CoroCoro&quot; manga, Mew lottery====

Two media channels that would play important roles in the &quot;Pokemon&quot; franchise were the &quot;CoroCoro Comic&quot;, released monthly, and its sister magazine &quot;Bessatsu CoroCoro Comic&quot;, released bi-monthly. Both manga magazines are published by Shogakukan, a long-time business partner of Nintendo, and have featured manga based on Nintendo properties (e.g. &quot;Super Mario-kun&quot;, &quot;Kirby of the Stars&quot;, &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;). At the time of &quot;Pokemon&quot;″s release, the main &quot;CoroCoro&quot; magazine was read by one in four elementary school students. &quot;CoroCoro&quot;&#x27;s deputy editor-in-chief was . On Ishihara&#x27;s suggestion, Kubo commissioned the creation of a manga adaptation. Written and illustrated by , its first chapter was featured in the March/April issue of &quot;Bessatsu CoroCoro Comic&quot;, released on 28 February 1996, the day after &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Green&quot;″s release. Shogakukan, which frequently surveys their target groups, determined that the &quot;Pocket Monsters&quot; manga was well received.
To further promote &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Green&quot;, the May issue of &quot;CoroCoro&quot;, released on 15 April 1996, announced the &quot;Legendary Pokemon Offer&quot;, centered around a mysterious, secret Pokemon called Mew. Mew was a last-minute addition to &quot;Red &amp; Green&quot;. It is unobtainable in the game(s) through usual means, and was intended to be used at a later point in some post-launch activity. To participate in the promotion, &quot;CoroCoro&quot; readers had to send in a postcard, and from the entrants, 20 were selected at random. The winners then had to send in their cartridge so that Mew could be uploaded onto it. The lottery was a success and increased word-of-mouth. By September, sales of &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Green&quot; had surpassed 1 million units.

====&quot;Blue Version&quot;====
After the release of &quot;Pokemon Red&quot; and &quot;Green&quot;, Game Freak continued to grow, and a number of new employees were hired. For training purposes, they were ordered to study and make bug fixes to the source code of &quot;Red &amp; Green&quot;, and to create new sprites for it; the test was later dubbed &quot;Pocket Monsters Blue&quot;. It was originally not meant to be sold. Only a small number of handmade copies were made, intended as a special gift to &quot;20 to 100 people&quot;. After Kubo learned of it, he encouraged Tajiri and Ishihara to allow an official release of &quot;Blue&quot;. President Hiroshi Yamauchi initially rejected this, fearing it would confuse people into believing it was an entirely new &quot;Pokemon&quot; game. Kawaguchi then suggested an alternative, which Yamauchi agreed with: &quot;Blue&quot; would not receive a normal retail release, but would instead be made available only through mail order for a limited time as a special offer. It was announced in the November issue of &quot;CoroCoro&quot;, which explicitly stated that &quot;Blue&quot; was not a new game, but rather a special, limited edition to celebrate 1 million sales of &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Green&quot;. The offer was a surprisingly big success: 300,000 units were expected to be sold, but over double was ordered.

====Trading Card Game====

The &quot;Pokemon Trading Card Game&quot; was one of the first collectible card games (CCGs) developed in Japan. Its creation was influenced by &quot;&quot;, the first CCG in history. Indeed, the &quot;Pokemon Trading Card Game&quot; can be considered a simplified version of &quot;Magic&quot;. First released in the United States in 1993, &quot;Magic&quot; had gained popularity not just in North America and Europe, but also in Asia. Ishihara was fond of playing cards, and had contributed to the development of at least three simple card games designed by Shigesato Itoi and released through Ape, Inc. At the time, Ishihara was particularly interested in &quot;Magic: The Gathering&quot;. While developing the &quot;Pokemon&quot; RPG, he realized that the concept behind it could be adapted into a &quot;Magic&quot;-like CCG. The &quot;Pokemon Trading Card Game&quot; was designed by Ishihara, Akihiko Miura, Kōichi Ōyama, and Takumi Akabane. All were former staff members of Ape and had previously worked on &quot;EarthBound&quot; (1994): Miura was the game&#x27;s main designer, Ōyama was its art director, and Akabane was one of its chief debuggers.
While card games have a long history in Japan, a collectible card game was a relatively new concept there, and at the time not widely known. Because of this, Ishihara had difficulties finding distributors. Sometime in 1995, Ishihara pitched the card game to Nintendo. They agreed to have the cards manufactured, subcontracting an unidentified printing company. However, Nintendo did not want the hassle of having to develop a distribution system from the ground up, i.e. finding retailers willing to sell a CCG. Ishihara was then contacted by Satoshi Kayama, director of a small firm called Media Factory. Like Ishihara, Kayama was a fan of card games. He felt that CCGs would soon rise to prominence in Japan, and had been gathering information on the possibility of developing such a game in some form. When Kayama heard that Creatures had developed a CCG, he contacted Ishihara and offered to distribute it, signing the contract near the end of 1995.
&quot;CoroCoro&quot; again proved a valuable information channel. The &quot;Trading Card Game&quot; was first announced in the November issue, the same one that announced &quot;Pokemon Blue&quot;. The issue came bundled with two promo cards: one of Purin (Jigglypuff) and one of Pikachu. Surveys showed that they were respectively the most and second-most popular Pokemon at the time. On 20 October 1996, the first card set was released. Booster packs were launched the same day, containing 10 randomly inserted cards. In the West, the booster packs contained 11 cards. The original set would be titled the Base Set in English. Many more sets would follow. Despite being ignored by the media, except for the &quot;CoroCoro&quot;, the cards became an instant success upon release. 87 million &quot;Pokemon&quot; cards were shipped by the end of March 1997, six months after its launch, and one month before the debut of the next big installment of the franchise: the &quot;Pokemon&quot; anime. The success of the TV series would cause the cards&#x27; sales figure to explode: by March 1998, a total of 499 million cards had been produced in Japan.

==== Anime production launches ====

By August 1996, Kubo had become convinced of &quot;Pokemon&quot;″s potential, and believed Shogakukan should create an anime adaptation. Nintendo was hesitant, noting that if the anime would flop, it would negatively affect the popularity of the game. Ishihara initially opposed the idea, because he thought it would overly hasten the &#x27;consumption&#x27; of the property: he feared that if the series would end, people would assume that &quot;Pokemon&quot; has ended, and move on to the next thing. At the time, Creatures and Game Freak were planning the sequel(s) to &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Green&quot;, &quot;Pokemon Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot;, and Ishihara did not want the anime to end before they could release their new games. Kubo was ultimately able to resolve the concerns of all parties involved. An important aspect of Kubo&#x27;s bargaining power was the then-ongoing Mini 4WD craze and its accompanying hit series &quot;Bakusō Kyōdai Let&#x27;s &amp; Go!!&quot;. Kubo had an important role in the creation of both, which impressed the stakeholders. To appease Ishihara, Kubo promised him that the anime would last for at least a year and a half. This was unusually long for a debuting anime, and required a big investment. Kubo&#x27;s proposal for &quot;Pocket Monsters&quot; was officially approved on 26 September 1996. For Nintendo of Japan, it was the first time they licensed a TV series. Kubo assigned independent producer to lead the project.
Shogakukan Productions, commonly called ShoPro, was Shogakukan&#x27;s production company. The animation company they commissioned was OLM, Inc. (Oriental Light and Magic), on Kubo&#x27;s suggestion. Kunihiko Yuyama, one of OLM&#x27;s founding members, became the anime&#x27;s director. ShoPro assembled a team of five writers, plus two supporting writers. All key people involved with the production of &quot;Pokemon&quot; were well-experienced and had proven track records within Japan&#x27;s anime industry. Yoshikawa felt that the team got lucky. &quot;The probability of so many great people coming together at the same time is very low&quot;, he said. Per Tajiri&#x27;s explicit condition, every anime team member had to play the game extensively, including the illustrators and voice actors. The anime staff &quot;unanimously agreed that the game was interesting&quot; and &quot;felt connected with each other through the world of &quot;Pokemon&quot;&quot;, feeling positively challenged to make an anime that would match the game&#x27;s quality.

A production council was formed to produce the anime. Different people appeared at different meetings, but four individuals usually present were Ishihara of Creatures, Sugimori of Game Freak, Yuyama of OLM, and independent producer Yoshikawa. Yoshikawa had the final say. The council decided on the anime&#x27;s worldview, characters, general storyline, and various important details. The early meetings, which were also attended by Tajiri, usually started with a Q&amp;A session in which Tajiri and Ishihara were asked about the Pokemon universe. The council was careful to have the anime be in concordance with the video game. Inevitably, there had to be differences between the two, but all agreed that the overall worldview as envisioned by Tajiri should not be disturbed. At the start of the video game, the player has to choose one of three starter Pokemon: Fushigidane, Hitokage, or Zenigame (Bulbasaur, Charmander, or Squirtle). The council didn&#x27;t want to unfairly popularize any of them, and wanted the protagonist to start out with a different Pokemon. Hatakeyama &amp; Kubo (2000) wrote that, by coincidence, three people independently suggested to the council that a Pikachu should be a main character in the anime: Kubo, Yuyama, and Keisuke Iwata of TV Tokyo&#x27;s Film Department. In the end, all council members agreed that Pikachu should be one of &quot;Pocket Monsters&quot;″ central icons, as they expected Pikachu to appeal to both boys and girls, as well as their mothers. This would expand its audience, which was considered a core objective of the anime.
During the council&#x27;s first meeting, Yoshikawa brought up the issue on whether the Pokemon in the anime could talk, and if not, how they could communicate. In the video games, each has a specific cry. In Anakubo&#x27;s &quot;CoroCoro&quot; manga, most could speak. At first, the council believed there should be a mixture of Pokemon that could talk and some that could not. However, this idea was eventually discarded: the Pokemon had to make a specific cry. The council agreed that Pokemon were like animals, and while they and humans should be able to understand each other in the series, they should not speak each other&#x27;s language. It was decided that Pikachu would repeatedly say its own name in various intonations. The role of Pikachu was given to Ikue Otani. During try-outs, Yuyama had Otani voice Pikachu in normal Japanese, as well as in &#x27;Pikachu talk&#x27;, in which it only said the syllables of its name. Yuyama realized that, even in the latter style of limited communication, Otani was experienced enough to still convey the messages and emotions needed.
ShoPro paid half of the production cost of &quot;Pokemon&quot;. TV Tokyo paid the other half and was granted co-ownership of the anime. The ads during the show″s commercial breaks were managed by advertisement agency , which was in turn paid by sponsors buying advertisement space. In negotiating with TV Tokyo, Kubo managed to secure the 19:00 – 19:30 timeslot on Tuesdays. &quot;Pocket Monsters&quot; premiered on 1 April 1997. By November, it had become the highest-rated program on TV Tokyo. The anime succeeded in its goal of widening &quot;Pokemon&quot;″s audience. Although the video games and the cards remained mostly of interest to boys, the anime also got more girls interested in the franchise, and girls&#x27; purchases of &quot;Pokemon&quot; products increased. This has been partly credited to Pikachu, who gained widespread popularity among both boys and girls. The success of this character would later lead to the game &quot;Pocket Monsters Pikachu&quot; (&quot;Pokémon Yellow: Special Pikachu Edition&quot;), released in Japan on 12 September 1998. An adaptation of &quot;Pokemon Blue&quot;, this version was made to resemble the TV series more.

====Copyright council formed, merchandising expands====

In the early months of the franchise, Nintendo was the contractual representative for &quot;Pokemon&quot;, and thus the central contact point for all &quot;Pokemon&quot;-related licensing (the approval of branded products). Around the time that planning of the anime begun, licensing requests for &quot;Pokemon&quot; started to increase, which Nintendo had difficulties handling due to a lack of (experienced) staff. Nintendo consequently granted ShoPro exclusive licensor rights. This was the first time that Nintendo of Japan (NoJ) granted licensor rights to another company, aside from its overseas subsidiaries Nintendo of America (NoA) and Nintendo of Europe (NoE).
A copyright council was formed, headed by Ishihara. Beginning in April 1997, the council met every Tuesday, in the conference room of Creatures&#x27; office, at the Nintendo Kanda Building in Sudachō, Tokyo. Attendees usually included Ishihara and his secretary, representatives of Nintendo, Game Freak, ShoPro, TV Tokyo, and JR Kikaku, as well as head of the anime Yoshikawa. Broadly put, every meeting had three types of agenda items: discussing &quot;Pokemon&quot;-related events and basic policies in Japan, discussing Shogakukan publication plans, and considering merchandise proposals. For merchandising, the council set the bar high. Fiercely protective of &quot;Pokemon&quot;″s brand equity, Ishihara was unwilling to greenlit an item just because it had a picture of a Pokemon printed on it. To avoid the market being flooded with low-quality goods, Ishihara put very specific demands on the products he evaluated. Furthermore, in most cases, the council opted to contract one company for each product category. Because of this, most merchandise proposals were rejected: of the approximately 7,500 applications submitted in 1997, only about 5% was approved.
By March 1998, 35 companies offered licensed &quot;Pokemon&quot; goods, and there were approximately 700 &quot;Pokemon&quot; products. Tomy manufactured &quot;Pokemon&quot; toy figures and plush dolls. Bandai made &quot;Pokemon&quot; &quot;gashapon&quot;, dolls and &quot;ramune&quot;-flavored candy in a plastic box in the shape of a Game Boy. Meiji Seika produced &quot;Pokemon&quot; chocolate snacks and pudding. The lucrative franchise provided a much-needed boost to Japan&#x27;s economy, which was stagnating in what would later be called the Lost Decade. An example of a firm that benefited greatly from &quot;Pokemon&quot; was food manufacturer . From May 1997, the company began selling &quot;Pokemon&quot;-branded curry, &quot;furikake&quot;, and baking mixes. In December 1997, Nagatanien was hit hard by the collapse of one of its biggest sales channels, Toshoku, in what was then the third-largest bankruptcy in Japan&#x27;s postwar history. Nonetheless, due to their &quot;Pokemon&quot;-licensed products, Nagatanien reported net profits in fiscal years &#x27;97 and &#x27;98, despite having forecasted losses.

====&quot;Dennō Senshi Porygon&quot; incident====

In the evening of 16 December 1997, the &quot;Pokemon&quot; franchise was hit by a crisis related to the broadcast of the anime&#x27;s 38th episode, &quot;Dennō Senshi Porygon&quot; (Computer Warrior Porygon). It was watched by approximately 4.6 million households. In the episode, the cast is transported into a virtual world, accompanied by a Porygon, a digital, human-made Pokemon. While flying through cyberspace, they are attacked by an anti-virus program which mistakes them for viruses, shooting &quot;vaccine missiles&quot; at the group resulting in explosions of bright, rapidly swapping red and blue flashes.
The intense stimuli brought about by the episode triggered a variety of adverse health effects in more than 10,000 viewers, primarily irritated eyes, headaches, dizziness, and nausea. A small part suffered a photosensitive epileptic seizure, manifested in loss of conscious and/or convulsions. Hundreds of children were brought to hospitals, although a part of them had recovered enough upon arrival and did not need to be hospitalized. No one died. Broadcasting of &quot;Pokemon&quot; was halted, and new guidelines were implemented to help prevent similar events from happening. With the show on hiatus, ShoPro and OLM worked on a feature &quot;Pokemon&quot; film. By the time the incident occurred, its script was already written, and the movie was in the storyboard stage. In mid-January, the staff resumed creating new episodes. The anime series returned on 16 April 1998. The film, titled &quot;Pocket Monsters the Movie: Mewtwo Strikes Back&quot; (&quot;Pokémon: The First Movie&quot;), premiered on 18 July 1998, and became the fourth highest grossing film of the year in Japan.
Ultimately, the incident did not damage the &quot;Pokemon&quot; franchise – it in fact grew further during and after the anime&#x27;s hiatus. While video rental tapes were removed from shelves, all other &quot;Pokemon&quot; products continued to be sold as usual, and customer demand for them remained high. Helping matters was a general understanding among businesses that the anime was not canceled, but rather suspended, and many executives (correctly) expected the show to be resumed after precautions had been taken. Supermarkets and other distribution outlets responded calmly to the crisis, and did not remove &quot;Pokemon&quot; products from their sales floors.

=== 1998–2000: International expansion ===

====North America====

Possibly the first official to show interest in a North American launch of &quot;Pokemon&quot; was Minoru Arakawa, founder and then-president of Nintendo of America (NoA). Arakawa visited Japan to participate in Shoshinkai 1996, held 22–24 November. It was around this time when he first played one of the three &quot;Pokemon&quot; titles. He thought the games were promising, but Nintendo of Japan (NoJ) had no plans at the time to release them elsewhere. He returned to America with a few cartridges and tested the game on his employees – they did not believe it would work in the US. At the time, role-playing games (RPGs) were not very popular outside Japan, and NoA executives believed that American children did not have the attention span for such a complex title. Americans were said to be more interested in sport- and action-oriented games, preferably with realistic graphics. Japanese people, by contrast, were alleged to care more about characters and plot. Up to that point, few Japanese properties had been successfully mainstreamed in the US, and if they were, it was alleged to be on account of having been properly Americanized: &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot; was considered a prime example of this. Visually, &quot;Pokemon&quot; was believed to be too &quot;kawaii&quot;, or cute. It was assumed that &quot;Pokemon&quot; could not succeed on cute alone – it must also be cool. In an effort to enhance the franchise&#x27;s coolness, NoA considered a graphical redesign and contracted a few external artists to create some test-designs for the American market. The mockups they proposed included &#x27;graffiti style&#x27; drawings, &#x27;beefed-up&#x27; and more muscular looking Pokemon, and a new Pikachu that looked like &quot;a tiger with huge breasts&quot;. Arakawa concluded that it &quot;didn&#x27;t work&quot;, and by that time, the anime had begun its production in Japan, leading NoA to conclude it was too late for a graphical revamp anyway.
Of pivotal importance to &quot;Pokemon&quot;″s global expansion was Alfred R. Kahn, CEO of US-based 4Kids Entertainment, NoA&#x27;s licensing agent since 1987. Convinced of the franchise&#x27;s potential, Kahn agreed to invest an undisclosed sum in return for both the anime and licensing rights. &quot;Pokemon&quot; became one of the first Japanese media franchises in which both the localization of the anime and the licensing of merchandise was handled by a single company, as well as a non-Japanese company. Kahn suggested to use the short version of the name, &quot;Pok&quot;é&quot;mon&quot;, adding an acute accent (´) over the &quot;e&quot; to assist with pronunciation and &quot;give it a little flair&quot;. NoJ president Hiroshi Yamauchi officially approved the project in late November, and subsequently announced it at Space World 1997. However, three weeks later, the &quot;Dennō Senshi Porygon&quot; incident happened, which Kubo felt made even more people resistant to the idea of an overseas introduction.
Market research turned back negative: American kids reportedly did not like &quot;Pokémon&quot;. Arakawa ignored the study and, convinced of the franchise&#x27;s potential, allocated an enormous budget to &quot;Pokémon&quot;″s launch. The exact amount was not disclosed, but was reportedly equal to or more than $50 million (c. $ million in ), approximately the same amount as the launch budget of the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1985. Arakawa admitted that it was &quot;quite a bit of money&quot;, but NoA &quot;had been doing well for several years, so we had a lot of money to spare&quot;. He opined that if &quot;Pokémon&quot; would be as successful in the US as it had been in Japan, &quot;an investment of 1 would turn into 100&quot;. NoA and 4Kids proceeded to devise a strategy on how to localize &quot;Pokémon&quot; for the United States. Arakawa appointed Gail Tilden to lead the project, prompting her to leave her position at &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; magazine. Tilden said that they &quot;decided to make an all-out effort to repeat the phenomenon in the Western world&quot;. In two press releases, NoA self-described &quot;Pokémon&quot;″s marketing campaign as &quot;aggressive&quot;.
The localization of the &quot;Pokémon&quot; anime was done by 4Kids, and directed by Norman J. Grossfeld. Grossfeld strongly believed that the anime should be Americanized. At NATPE 1998, he asked ShoPro for a &quot;kind of carte blanche, to let me change the show as I think would work for this market&quot;, to which ShoPro agreed. However, no national TV station was interested in buying the anime or financing its localization. Kahn then decided to self-finance &quot;Pokémon&quot;&#x27;s production costs, despite realizing this &quot;could very well bring down 4Kids&quot; if the show would fail. According to Kahn, they &quot;spend a fortune&quot; on the localization. To have it broadcast in syndication, 4Kids offered the show for free to local TV stations across the country, in exchange for a portion of the advertising revenue. NoA assisted, persuading dozens of stations to carry the series by offering to buy some of their advertisement space, spending a total of $5 million (c. $ million in ). Despite all this, most broadcasters were still reluctant to carry &quot;Pokémon&quot;, with Grossfeld experiencing difficulties getting through their &quot;preconceived notions or their snobbery for Western-produced animation over something from Asia&quot;. At the time, anime had not yet found mainstream popularity in the West. Contemporary news reports cited &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; as an example of an anime that had failed to catch on with American youth. Still, with NoA&#x27;s help, 4Kids ultimately succeeded in contracting 112 broadcasters for &quot;Pokémon&quot;, reaching &quot;about 85 to 90 percent&quot; of television households. However, many broadcasters gave it off-peak time slots, with starting times like 06:00 or 06:30. Prior to the late 1990s, this was the case for many anime in the US.
Grossfeld came up with the advertising slogan &quot;Gotta catch &#x27;em all!&quot; as the English equivalent to the Japanese . The phrase &quot;miraculously managed to gain approval&quot; by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which normally prohibits the use of injunctions in ads directed at children (e.g. &quot;You must buy this!&quot;). While the tagline does sound commanding, the FCC reasoned that the act of &quot;catching&quot; is at the core of &quot;Pokémon&quot;″s play. Therefore, the phrase was allowed. The series&#x27; theme song was written by John Loeffler and John Siegler, and performed by Jason Paige. In commissioning the track, Grossfeld specifically requested the song&#x27;s chorus to be written around the &quot;Gotta catch &#x27;em all&quot; phrase, firmly embedding the slogan into the theme.
While NoA and 4Kids were allowed a fair degree of liberty in their localization of &quot;Pokémon&quot;, the Japanese copyright council, headed by Ishihara, had the last say over it. All decisions regarding adjustments and promotion had to gain final approval of the Japan side. This included all of the merchandise, for which a &#x27;two-step system&#x27; was created. All (aspiring) licensees in North America were to send their merchandise proposals to 4Kids. Staff of both 4Kids and NoA then made a pre-selection and send the approved proposals to Japan, where the council made the final decision. Many submissions were bounced at the US stage, and thus never got sent to Japan. Tilden noted that processing all license applications, and mailing all approved prototypes and their documentation to Japan, was a lot of work. Arakawa did consider streamlining the process by moving someone from Japan to the US, but no person could be found who was as competent as Ishihara.
The &quot;Pokémon&quot; anime was first broadcast on 7 September 1998. &quot;Pokémon Red Version&quot; and &quot;Blue Version&quot; were released three weeks later, on 28 September 1998. To localize the card game, Nintendo contracted Wizards of the Coast, the creator of &quot;&quot;. The &quot;Pokémon Trading Card Game&quot; was officially launched nationwide on 9 January 1999, although pre-sold in select stores in December. Coinciding with the North American launch of &quot;Pokémon&quot; was the release of the Game Boy Color on 23 November 1998.

====Other regions====
The American version of the &quot;Pokémon&quot; anime started broadcasting in Australia and New Zealand on 28 September 1998. &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; were subsequently released there on 23 October. Various territories in Asia followed: the anime series debuted in Hong Kong on 16 November, in Taiwan on 23 November, in Shanghai on 24 November, in Beijing on 10 January 1999, and in South Korea on 14 July 1999.

Outside North America, 4Kids distributed the anime in cooperation with Brian Lacey of Lacey Entertainment. The series was presented at MIP TV, in Cannes, France, from 3–8 April 1998. Broadcasters were initially not interested due to its Japanese origins, and preferred to wait and see how the anime would fare in the US. After its American success, Lacey received inquiries about the series throughout 1999 from multiple international broadcasters. Lacey noted that, in Europe, this was a stark contrast compared to previous years: &quot;I was trying to sell this sort of stuff for years and buyers would tell me they were moving away from Japanese animation shows&quot;, he said. In October 1999, the franchise was launched in the European key markets of Germany, the United Kingdom, France, and Spain. The anime started broadcasting in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden in December 1999. In 2000, broadcasting rights for the first season were secured by TV stations in South Africa, Russia, Iceland, and Finland. In Israel, the anime debuted in February 2000. For unclear reasons, &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; were not officially released there. Thriving only on the strength of the TV series, &quot;The First Movie&quot;, the cards, and imported video games, the Israeli &quot;Pokémon&quot; still became a success.

By the end of 2000, &quot;Pokémon&quot; games had been released in 70 countries, the anime was broadcast in 51 countries, the films were released in 33 countries, and the cards had been translated into 11 languages.

=== 1999–2000: Pokémania ===

In North America, the debuting &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise quickly rose to success. &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; sold 200,000 copies in its first month. By December 1998, the &quot;Pokémon&quot; anime had become the highest-rated syndicated children&#x27;s show during the weekdays. This attracted the attention of two media companies: Warner Bros., co-owner of The WB channel; and Saban Entertainment/Fox Family Worldwide, owners of the Fox Kids channel. A bidding war ensued between the parties, which was won by Warner Bros. On 13 February 1999, &quot;Pokémon&quot; launched on the Kids&#x27; WB national television block. The debut episode became the most watched premiere in Kids&#x27; WB&#x27;s history. In European countries, the anime received similar levels of success. For example, in Germany, &quot;a highly competitive kids market&quot;, &quot;Pokémon&quot; was purchased by RTL 2. The show&#x27;s popularity bolstered the entire program block, more than tripling its viewers. Andrea Lang, RTL 2&#x27;s editor of cartoons and children&#x27;s programs, said: &quot;We were speechless. We&#x27;ve never had a comparable success&quot;. By March 1998, half a year before &quot;Pokémon&quot;″s overseas launch, 499 million &quot;Pokémon&quot; cards had been produced. By March 1999, the total number of cards shipped reached 764 million. By March 2000, this figure would grow further to 4.255 billion cards, manufactured in both Japanese and American factories.
By April 1999, there was a general consensus in the US that &quot;Pokémon&quot; had become a phenomenon and the newest children&#x27;s fad. By some, the fad was referred to as &quot;Pokémania&quot;, including journalists of &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;USA Today&quot;. In the US, severe scarcity occurred of &quot;Pokémon&quot; goods, especially &quot;Pokémon&quot; cards, causing companies to miss profits. A &quot;Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&quot; article, published on 3 August 1999, cited a Toys &quot;R&quot; Us manager as saying that a supply of 600 booster packs would last 24 hours. The CEO of one card distributor stated that they were &quot;thousands of boxes behind&quot; on orders. In the same article, a Wizards spokeswoman stated that more employees and printers had been hired to increase card production. However, near the end of the month, a different Wizards spokeswoman told &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that they had &quot;exhausted most of the card-printing capacity of the United States&quot;. Similarly, &quot;USA Today&quot; reported in November 1999 that factories making Hasbro&#x27;s &quot;Pokémon&quot; toys had expanded production by 20 times, but demand still exceeded supply. In Europe, scarcity of &quot;Pokémon&quot; merchandise also occurred.
In part due to the &quot;Pokémon&quot; craze, Nintendo saw a 250% increase in profits in 1999 compared to the previous year, reaching a six-year high. The &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise accounted for over 30% of Nintendo&#x27;s revenue that year. &quot;Pokémon&quot;″s popularity also caused a sharp increase in sales of the Game Boy line. The financial windfalls came at a time when Nintendo lost dominance in the home console market, with the Nintendo 64 being outsold by Sony&#x27;s PlayStation. The global success of &quot;Pokémon&quot; compensated this loss somewhat. Buckingham &amp; Sefton-Green went even further, writing in 2004: &quot;while Nintendo is now among Japan&#x27;s most profitable corporations, it could be argued that the company would have struggled to survive without Pokémon&quot;.
4Kids, initially a little-known firm, expanded thirty times in revenues, and was named the fastest-growing company in America in the 4 September 2000, issue of &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine. Many businesses that timely obtained a &quot;Pokémon&quot; license reaped considerable profits. In the summer of 1999, a massive run on stocks of publicly traded &quot;Pokémon&quot; licensees caused their value to increase dramatically. However, by November, most investors were shorting their shares. Realizing that &quot;Pokémon&quot; was a fad that would peak and fall at some point, investors were bearish about its prospects.
&quot;Pokémon: The First Movie&quot; premiered in North America on 12 November 1999, and in Europe the following year. Despite being negatively received by many Western critics, it became one of the most successful Japanese animated films of all time. In the United States, November 1999 was estimated to have been the peak of Pokémania. Supporting the American release of &quot;The First Movie&quot; was a promotional action with Burger King, one of the largest in the history of the fast-food industry. The success of the promotion resulted in supply issues; restaurants often ran out of &quot;Pokémon&quot; toys to include with their meals. On 27 December, Burger King recalled its Poké Ball toy after a 13-month-old girl died suffocating on one.
&quot;Pokémon Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot;, the successors to &quot;Red/Green/Blue&quot;, were released in North America on 15 October 2000. In Europe, they were released on 6 April 2001.

==== The Pokémon Company and Pokémon USA established ====
On 23 April 1998, Pokémon Center Co. Ltd. was founded as a joint venture by Nintendo, Creatures, and Game Freak. It was initially formed for the management of specialized merchandise stores called Pokemon Centers, of which the first location opened in Nihonbashi, Tokyo, on 18 July 1998. Throughout the years, multiple Japanese Pokémon Centers would open and close. , a total of 24 Pokémon merchandise shops exist in Japan. An American Pokémon Center also existed in New York City from 2001 to 2005. It was then remodelled into Nintendo World, later renamed Nintendo New York.
After the release of &quot;Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot;, Tsunekazu Ishihara began setting out a number of long-term goals for the &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise, which included releasing a movie every year. As part of Ishihara&#x27;s plan, the Pokemon Center Co. Ltd. was reformatted into The Pokémon Company (TPC), and officially renamed in October 2000. The goal of TPC is to centralize and streamline the global management of Pokémon. Satoru Iwata, who had joined Nintendo of Japan in June, was involved with the company&#x27;s creation, which was one of his first jobs at Nintendo.
In February 2001, Pokémon USA (PUSA) was established, an affiliated firm of The Pokémon Company. The company&#x27;s first president was Tatsumi Kimishima (who would later become president of NoA, and subsequently president of NoJ). In 2002, Kimishima was succeeded by Akira Chiba.

===2001–2006: End of the craze, business reforms===

In North America, Pokémania peaked in 1999, slowing down throughout the next year. On 29 April 2000, the anime was bumped off Kids&#x27; WB&#x27;s No. 1 spot after holding it for 54 weeks. Around the same time, &quot;Pokémon&quot; was surpassed at Fox Kids by its rival &quot;Digimon&quot;. In Europe, the craze peaked in 2000. On 20 January 2001, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that &quot;Pokémon&quot;″s trading card market had collapsed in the US. A June 2001 survey in the United Kingdom confirmed that &quot;Pokémon&quot;″s popularity was waning there. Tobin (2004) wrote: &quot;By the summer of 2001, Pokémon&#x27;s shelf space in Japanese and U.S. toy stores was but a fraction of what it enjoyed in the fall of 1999&quot;. By the end of 2001, Pokémania was fading globally, and by 2002, the fad was largely over.
From 2000 to 2002, Game Freak developed &quot;Pokémon Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot;, the successors to &quot;Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot;, for the newly released Game Boy Advance. Masuda, who was appointed to assistant director during &quot;Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot;, was promoted to director for &quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot;, with Tajiri making himself executive director. Masuda was concerned that the end of Pokémania indicated the end of &quot;Pokémon&quot; as a whole: &quot;After Gold and Silver came out, it was a huge hit around the world, but shortly after everyone was saying, &#x27;That&#x27;s it. The Pokémon fad is over! It&#x27;s dead!&#x27;.&quot; Determined to keep the franchise going, GF not only wanted to &quot;prove people wrong&quot; with &quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot;, but already started planning their sequels: &quot;Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot; (2006). They also began planning remakes of older installments, starting with &quot;FireRed&quot; and &quot;LeafGreen&quot; (2004), remakes of the original &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Green&quot;.
&quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot; were released in Japan on 21 November 2002, and in the rest of the world the next year. The games introduced 135 new Pokémon, bringing the total amount to 386. Because of this, Golin Harris, NoA&#x27;s ad agency, advised them to move away from the &quot;Gotta catch &#x27;em all!&quot; slogan. They reasoned that if new, younger players were drawn into the franchise with &quot;Ruby/Sapphire&quot;, they would find the concept of &quot;catching them all&quot; to be a daunting if not impossible task if they didn&#x27;t also have &quot;Red/Blue/Yellow&quot; and &quot;Gold/Silver/Crystal&quot;. Dockery (2022) noted that &quot;from both a marketing perspective and, really, a legal perspective, it would not be to the company&#x27;s advantage to keep pushing that slogan&quot;.
By 2002, the relationship between Pokémon USA (PUSA) and Wizards of the Coast had deteriorated. That year, at least seven high-profile employees were poached from Wizards by PUSA: Wizard&#x27;s former art director, senior graphic designer, business manager, events marketing director, project management director, and two vice presidents. All employees had signed NDAs. In March 2003, PUSA told Wizards that their contract would not be renewed, and that Wizards would not be distributing the new &quot;Ruby &amp; Sapphire&quot; card set. Later, Wizards was also prohibited from releasing the sets &quot;Jamboree&quot; and &quot;Legendary Collection II&quot;. Notably, &quot;Jamboree&quot; was the first set containing cards designed by Wizards themselves. As considerable time and money was invested into creating them, Wizards was upset when they were barred from putting them out. On 1 October 2003, the day after their agreement expired, Wizards filed suit against Pokémon USA, alleging that the defendant had seized their intellectual property and trade secrets, and illegally tried to gain advantage over them in the competitive trading card market. The case was settled out of court. &quot;Jamboree&quot; and &quot;Legendary Collection II&quot; have remained unreleased.
In October 2001, 4Kids Entertainment signed a new contract with PUSA, continuing to serve as &quot;Pokémon&quot;″s exclusive licensing agent and anime localizer. On 23 December 2005, it was announced that the agreement would not be renewed and would expire on 31 December, with PUSA moving all licensing in-house. The localization of the anime would be done by PUSA in cooperation with TAJ Productions. PUSA proceeded to replace almost all of the original English voice actors, who were still under contract with 4Kids. This decision &quot;raised the ire of fans and the actors themselves&quot;. According to Stuart Zagnit, who voiced Professor Oak, the recasting was done to cut back on costs.
In March 2003, Pokémon UK was established in London as a British representative of The Pokémon Company.

===2006–2012: Generation IV–V, TPCi established===
Following &quot;Ruby and Sapphire&quot;, &quot;Pokémon Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot; were released for the Nintendo DS on 28 September 2006, in Japan and on 22 April 2007, in North America. A third version, &quot;Pokémon Platinum&quot;, was released on 28 September 2008, in Japan and on 22 March 2009, in North America. They form the fourth generation (Generation IV) in the &quot;Pokémon&quot; video game series. &quot;Diamond and Pearl&quot; were designed based on the DS&#x27;s various features such as its Wi-Fi capabilities and slot for Game Boy Advance cartridge. Pokémon president Tsunekazu Ishihara dubbed the games as the &quot;ultimate&quot; Pokémon titles because they allowed the player to trade and battle Pokémon including every Pokémon from previous iterations globally through WiFi, as opposed to previously only able to do so locally and with fewer Pokémon. The games&#x27; characters are 2D and the environments are rendered in 3D, and it is considerably difficult to differentiate them because Game Freak designed them this way to innovate the graphics while also retaining the traditional game style and feel.

In &quot;Platinum,&quot; the developers focused on changing the most essential elements from &quot;Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot; to maintain continuity with the previous games. Director Junichi Masuda stated that since they designed &quot;Diamond and Pearl&quot; as the &quot;ultimate&quot; &quot;Pokémon&quot; titles, it was only necessary to make &quot;Platinum&quot; &quot;even stronger&quot; than them. They approached this by designing the &quot;Origin Forme&quot; for the legendary Pokémon Giratina, ensuring that the design would appear significantly different from its regular form in &quot;Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot; and to express the games&#x27; core antimatter and Distortion World concepts. The title Platinum was chosen to reflect a precious material that &quot;shines&quot; and is different from diamond and pearl and their associations of &quot;love&quot; and &quot;happiness&quot; respectively.

&quot;Pokémon HeartGold&quot; and &quot;SoulSilver&quot; were released on 12 September 2009, in Japan and on 14 March 2010, in North America as part of Generation IV. They are remakes of &quot;Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver,&quot; aiming to balance familiarity for the original games&#x27; players and new content for newcomers. The titles reflected the theme of the bond between trainers and their Pokémon. The developers faithfully recreated the original story and added elements from the Generation IV games and &quot;Yellow&quot;, the latter of which was released concurrently with &quot;Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver.&quot;

In 2009, Pokémon USA and Pokémon UK merged to form The Pokémon Company International (TPCi). This subsidiary of The Pokémon Company (TPC) has since managed the &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise outside of Asia.

In Generation V, &quot;Pokémon Black&quot; and &quot;White&quot; were released on 18 September 2010, in Japan for the DS and on 6 March 2011, in North America. The games feature enhanced visual effects and increased use of 3D graphics. The developers excluded old Pokémon and strategies, while introducing over 150 new Pokémon to evoke a sense of novelty and to provide new players a more &quot;leveled playing field&quot; against old players. The games seek to attract both new players and returning players through its detailed walkthrough and the addition of C-Gear (a real-time communication tool to improve the trade and battle experiences), respectively.

The games were followed by &quot;Pokémon Black 2&quot; and &quot;White 2&quot;&quot;,&quot; which were released on 23 June 2012, in Japan and on 7 October 2012, in North America. The games were developed for the DS rather than the more powerful Nintendo 3DS to maintain continuity with the game world in &quot;Black&quot; and &quot;White&quot; and they were presented from a different perspective in the storyline. Since the games are their first sequels, director Masuda explained that they have strived to find a &quot;fine balance&quot; to appeal to both newcomers and returning players by implementing introductory explanations, and by placing a Pokémon Center in the first in-game city, they were able to further this approach by providing newcomers with a detailed walkthrough and also returning players with new updates. During development phase, director Takao Unno revealed that they had experimented with a 100-player multiplayer experience via their communication feature Entralink drawing from their vision of players &quot;sharing the same space, same time and same game&quot; but this feature was never implemented due to technical limitations.

===2013–2018: 3D, Generation VI–VII, &quot;Pokémon Go&quot;===
In Generation VI, &quot;Pokémon X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; were released worldwide for the 3DS on 12 October 2013, and they are the first games to be released in this way. The developers focused on the themes of &quot;beauty&quot;, &quot;bond&quot;, and &quot;evolution&quot;, and it is based on these themes that they created the games&#x27; core mechanic where Pokémon could achieve a higher form of evolution by strengthening their bonds with trainers; however, to maintain game balance, they limited this feature to a special, temporary phenomenon. The games&#x27; shift to fully 3D graphics allowed the player to freely manipulate the camera angles although due to technical limitations objects far away are rendered in lower polygon models, and producer Hitoshi Yamagami addressed to 2D players that &quot;Game Freak [developers are also] big fans of 2D graphics... So there are some elements in there that I [Yamagami] think fans of 2D will appreciate as well.&quot; When asked about the Horde battle and Sky battle types, he stated that Horde battles are to supplant the roles of &quot;really strong pokemon &quot; to help the player more easily progress through the games and also to add &quot;more excitement to the battles and a sense of danger,&quot; and that they added the Sky battles to take advantage of the games&#x27; 3D camera angels capabilities.

&quot;Pokémon Omega Ruby&quot; and &quot;Alpha Sapphire&quot; were released worldwide for the 3DS on 21 November 2014 and on 28 November 2014, in Europe as part of Generation VI. They are remakes of &quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot;. The developers adopted &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;&#x27;s core game mechanic and added enhanced 3D graphics. According to director Masuda, they reviewed the original mechanic and concept and expressed them using modern hardware, such as replacing the original PokéGear feature for the enhanced versions BuzzNav and DexNav to more effectively provide information enabled by the games&#x27; hardware capabilities. They seek to explore the concept of Pokémon coexisting with humans and nature, revisiting the concept behind original games&#x27; setting, which translated to &quot;richness or abundance in nature and bonds between people and nature&quot; in Japanese. To appeal to the newer audience in &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;, the developers decided to connect the story with &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; by further exploring their core mechanic.

In Generation VII, &quot;Pokémon Sun&quot; and &quot;Moon&quot; were released worldwide for the 3DS on 18 November 2016, and on 23 November 2016, in Europe. The developers chose Hawaii for inspiration due to its distinctive warm sunlight and clear moonlight and unique biomes that helped support the games&#x27; regional Pokémon variance concept. Ohmori said, as director, he aimed to focus on the concept of &quot;Pokémon as these living creatures, [and really focus] on them being alive.&quot; Having the release date on the 20th anniversary of Pokémon in mind, he treated this project as a &quot;celebration of that life, and to really express this respect for life.&quot; As he contemplated about life and its origins, Ohmori considered the significance of the Sun, enabling life with its light, and the Moon&#x27;s impact on certain species&#x27; reproduction. He explained how the Sun, the Moon, and the Earth &quot;work [together] to influence [one another], and life as a result grows and flourishes based on [this] relationship.&quot;

Ohmori stated that with the innovation to 3D in &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; the designers decided to examine more minor aspects concerning with the Pokémon themselves such as their motions, such as when they designed the games&#x27; first starter Pokémon to capitalize on its owl-like characteristics with its head &quot;twists round and round.&quot; With the 3DS technologies, the developers are able to design the characters to be more expressive as themselves including different facial expressions and reactions. In addition to portraying Pokémon harmoniously coexisting with people and vice versa in the games, the developers replaced the traditional Gym mechanic with Island Trials, deepening the players&#x27; connection with the story and their Pokémon. The enhanced versions &quot;Pokémon Ultra Sun&quot; and &quot;Ultra Moon&quot; were released worldwide on 17 November 2017. The games added an alternate storyline and additional characters, Pokémon, and other features. Developer Shigeki Morimoto revealed that they were developed by the younger staff members and veterans so the more veterans can prioritized on developing more important titles, and the developers considered them to be their culmination with the 3DS.

====&quot;Pokémon Go&quot;====

In 2016, the &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise spawned a second worldwide fad with the release of &quot;Pokémon Go&quot;, a mobile augmented reality game. The app originated as a Google April Fools&#x27; Day joke in 2014: the &quot;Google Maps Pokémon Challenge&quot;. The prank was conceived by Tsunekazu Ishihara and Satoru Iwata. On Ishihara&#x27;s initiation, the hoax was turned into an actual video game developed by Niantic. Ishihara was a fan of Niantic&#x27;s previous transreality game, &quot;Ingress&quot;, and saw the game&#x27;s concept as a perfect match for &quot;Pokémon&quot;.

Through in-game purchases, the game generated more than by the end of July 2016, with App Annie reporting that &quot;Pokémon Go&quot; had generated around in revenue every day that month. The same month, Sensor Tower reported that the game had passed more than in worldwide revenue, beating every existing record set by &quot;Clash of Clans&quot; and &quot;Candy Crush&quot; by a wide margin. The average daily usage of the app on Android devices in July 2016 exceeded that of Snapchat, Tinder, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. By 2 September 2016, &quot;Pokémon Go&quot; had generated more than $440 million in worldwide revenue, according to Sensor Tower. By 30 September, it had received downloads and grossed in 80 days, according to market research firm Newzoo. &quot;Pokémon Go&quot; reached the milestone of $600 million in revenue after only 90 days on the market, becoming the fastest mobile game ever to do so.

&quot;Pokémon: Let&#x27;s Go, Pikachu!&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Go, Eevee!&quot; were released for the Nintendo Switch on 16 November 2018. They are part of Generation VII. Inspired by &quot;Pokémon Yellow,&quot; the games seek to introduce newcomers and a new generation of players (particularly &quot;Pokémon Go&quot; players) to the &quot;Pokémon&quot; series in addition to catering old players. As such, the games feature similar capture mechanics to &quot;Go&quot; where the player throws Poké Balls to catch wild Pokémon rather than battling them like traditional &quot;Pokémon&quot; games. In addition, the games feature the same setting and characters as the first generation of games and the original animated series, and include exclusively the original 151 Pokémon to further appeal to their targeted audience. The only new Pokémon featured are Meltan and Melmetal.

===2019–present: Generation VIII–IX, open-world gameplay===
Generation VIII debuted with the release of &quot;Pokémon Sword&quot; and &quot;Shield&quot; on 15 November 2019, for the Switch. Director Shigeru Ohmori stated that they designed the games based on what they believed of the biggest &quot;Pokémon&quot; theme of becoming/being &quot;the greatest or strongest&quot;, which was expressed in the games&#x27; Dynamax / Gigantamax Pokémon core mechanic and the games&#x27; increasingly powerful software and hardware capabilities. Ohmori further revealed that through developing the &quot;Let&#x27;s Go&quot; games as research projects for the Switch, they were able to gain valuable experiences and knowledge to develop &quot;Sword&quot; and &quot;Shield&quot;. He noted that they took advantage of the Switch&#x27;s high resolution and TV connectivity to implement the games&#x27; gigantic-size core Pokémon mechanic. They envisioned the games&#x27; setting to be a &quot;wide-open space&quot; that is different from the traditional route systems and is constantly changing where the player can meet and explore with other players.

Many pre-existing Pokémon are not available in &quot;Sword&quot; and &quot;Shield&quot;. This &quot;Dexit&quot;, as it was called, led to fan backlash. &quot;Sword&quot; and &quot;Shield&quot; were the first &quot;Pokémon&quot; games to receive DLC expansions: Part 1—&quot;The Isle of Armor&quot;, and Part 2—&quot;The Crown Tundra&quot;; they were released on 17 June 2020, and 22 October 2020, respectively. They include additional storylines, places, Pokémon, characters, and other features.

In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic broke out. The resulting widespread ennui and excessive leisure time inspired a resurgence in popularity and interest of &quot;Pokémon&quot; cards, which was further popularized by various YouTubers and other influencers, such as Logan Paul. The craze resulted in severe supply shortages, and customers&#x27; inappropriate and obsessive behavior raised safety concerns in many retail outlets. &quot;Pokémon&quot; cards&#x27; values skyrocketed, prompting collectors to submit cards and overwhelm card grading agencies. The Pokémon Company responded by reprinting impacted products at maximum capacity to ensure price stabilization and general accessibility.

Remakes of &quot;Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot;, &quot;Pokémon Brilliant Diamond&quot; and &quot;Shining Pearl&quot; were released on 19 November 2021, for the Switch as part of Generation VIII. They are the first core series games to be developed by a third-party developer, ILCA, rather than Game Freak. The developers revealed that the games would not assume the anticipated style of the &quot;Let&#x27;s Go&quot; Games and feature traditional game mechanics. &quot;Pokémon&quot; intends to celebrate their 25th anniversary with the release of the remakes by revisiting old games and mechanics, which they faithfully reproduced with enhanced 3D graphics.

&quot;Pokémon Legends: Arceus&quot; was released on 28 January 2022, for the Switch as a prequel to &quot;Diamond and Pearl&quot;. It is part of Generation VIII. The game &quot;represents a new approach for the &quot;Pokémon&quot; video game series&quot; as it transitions from traditional RPG mechanics to add real-time elements in their games. Unlike traditional &quot;Pokémon&quot; games, the player can catch Pokémon by throwing a Poké Ball in real-time rather than triggering a battle; however, they can still choose the latter to weaken it for capture. Many in-game aspects, particularly its landscape, heavily resemble those of &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&quot;.

Generation IX was introduced with the release of &quot;Pokémon Scarlet&quot; and &quot;Violet&quot; for the Switch on 18 November 2022. The games are the first &quot;Pokémon&quot; games to feature an entirely open-world experience as opposed to the partially open-world experience in previous &quot;Pokémon&quot; games such as &quot;Sword and Shield,&quot; and it also departed from the traditional gym mechanics and the elite four battles to opt for unique road quests. The games&#x27; improved multiplayer experience allowed for up to four players to travel together. Their DLC, &quot;The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero&quot;, consists of two parts, &quot;The Teal Mask&quot; and &quot;The Indigo Disk&quot;; &quot;The Teal Mask&quot; was released on 12–13 September 2023 and &quot;The Indigo Disk&quot; was released on 14 December 2023. An epilogue to &quot;The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero&quot; was released on 11 January 2024.

On 27 February 2024, TPCi announced &quot;Pokémon Legends: Z-A&quot;, set to release in 2025 for the Switch. It is part of Generation IX. A successor to &quot;Legends: Arceus&quot;, this game acts as a prequel to &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;.

By 2024, the &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise had earned a total of 100 billion US dollars, making it the highest-grossing media franchise ever.

==Media==

===Video games===

&quot;Pokémon&quot; video games have been released in a wide variety of genres. The role-playing games (RPGs) developed by Game Freak are considered the core series of the franchise. Various spin-off games also exist, such as &quot;Pokémon Mystery Dungeon&quot;, a roguelike RPG series, &quot;Pokémon Ranger&quot;, an action RPG series, and &quot;Detective Pikachu&quot; (2018), an adventure game. &quot;Pokémon&quot; games, in particular the core RPGs, are commonly classified in generations. For example, Junichi Masuda referred to &quot;Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot; (2006) as Gen 4, and &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; (2013) as the 6th generation.

Until 2011, &quot;Pokémon&quot; games were released exclusively on Nintendo&#x27;s consoles. With the rise of the smartphone during the 2010s, The Pokémon Company also began developing, publishing, and licensing &quot;Pokémon&quot; titles for the mobile phone market, most notably &quot;Pokémon Go&quot; (2016), an augmented reality game developed by Niantic that spawned a worldwide craze in the summer of 2016.

According to the official website of The Pokémon Company, , over 480 million &quot;Pokémon&quot; game units have been sold worldwide.

===Trading card game===

The &quot;Pokémon Trading Card Game&quot; (PTCG) was one of the first collectable card games (CCGs) in Japan. It was inspired by &quot;&quot;. In the card game, the players use a 60-card deck featuring Basic and evolved Pokémon, Energy cards, and Trainer cards to help them knock out the opponent&#x27;s Pokémon, drawing prize cards and winning the game. Cards are classified into various levels of rarity, ranging from Common to Rare Holofoil with a holographic illustration. Rare cards, including limited edition, exclusive cards, and older cards, are highly valued among collectors due to their scarcity.

According to the official website of The Pokémon Company, 64.8 billion cards have been produced .

===Anime===
, the anime consists of over 1,300 episodes across 8 series in Asia, and 27 seasons internationally. Its newest series, &quot;Pokémon Horizons&quot;, started airing on 14 April 2023. The anime originally focused on Ash Ketchum and his travels across the Pokémon world with his partner, Pikachu. They were retired as protagonists after the 25th season, and &quot;Pokémon Horizons&quot; introduced two new protagonists, Liko and Roy. A total of 23 anime films have been released, the most recent being &quot;Pokémon the Movie: Secrets of the Jungle&quot; (2021).

Spin-off series from the anime have also been produced, including a variety show titled , which aired on TV Tokyo from 2002 to 2004 and aired in English as part of &quot;Pokémon Chronicles&quot;. Three television specials have been released. 27 short films starring Pikachu were produced, primarily preceding the films. Various animated mini-series also exist.

===Live-action===
&quot;Detective Pikachu&quot;, a live-action/animated film based on the video game of the same name, was released in 2019. A sequel is currently under development.

A live-action television drama produced by The Pokémon Company and TV Tokyo titled &quot;Pocket ni Boken o Tsumekonde&quot; premiered on TV Tokyo on 20 October 2023.

===Postage stamps===
In 2021, the Japan Post released limited edition postage stamps and stamp box. The stamp boxes had promo Pokémon cards that were inspired by the postage stamps Beauty Looking Back and Moon Goose. The postage stamps depicted Pokémon across the four seasons.

On 17 June 2024, &quot;La Poste&quot; (France) issued a booklet of 12 stamps dedicated to Pokémon.

==Reaction to Pokémania (1999–2000)==

In 1999 and 2000, &quot;Pokémon&quot; was an unprecedented, ubiquitous fad in the Western world. &quot;Time&quot; magazine described it as &quot;a multimedia and interactive barrage like no other before it&quot;. The franchise, primarily aimed at children, elicited mixed responses from parents and teachers, some of them critical. Yano (2004) even claimed that the reactions at one point constituted a moral panic.
The bulk of the criticism on &quot;Pokémon&quot; was directed at the trading cards, in particular the booster packs, sealed packages of 11 randomly inserted cards that were sold separately from the main sets. The cards are of varying scarcity, the most valuable being the &quot;holofoil cards&quot; (also called &quot;holographic&quot; or &quot;foil cards&quot;), in which the illustrations of the Pokémon have a shiny overlay effect. The rare cards can only be found in booster packs, and the rarest ones are very infrequently included. Tobin (2004) notes that rarity in this case is &quot;artificially created&quot;, and &quot;effectively a form of gambling&quot; in which children need to repeatedly purchase booster packs to get more rare cards. (2004) described a cynicism among adults that corporations could apparently, &quot;out of thin air&quot;, ascribe value to cards which they saw as valueless, thereby &quot;deceiving vulnerable young consumers and garnering excessive profits&quot;.
As the franchise&#x27;s popularity grew, children began taking their &quot;Pokémon&quot; cards to school for trading and playing. Soon, the cards were alleged to be &quot;disrupting learning, poisoning playground friendships and causing such distraction that some children forget their homework, tune out in class and even miss school buses as they scramble to acquire one more card&quot;. The cards were &quot;turning the playground into a black market&quot;, with card swaps sometimes inciting conflicts. Certain children engaged in &quot;aggressive trading&quot;, tricking other (often younger) kids into unfair deals, forcing teachers to arbitrate. Some parents expressed their concerns about the craze, but feared that their children would be ostracized if they were to deny them &quot;Pokémon&quot; products. In the US, the &quot;Pokémon&quot; cards ended up &quot;almost universally banned&quot; from school grounds. Similar bans occurred in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and European countries. In September 1999, US-based law firm Milberg filed a class-action lawsuit against Nintendo of America, Wizards of the Coast, and 4Kids. The suit claimed that the booster packs constitute a form of lottery and promote gambling in kids. Susan Estrich noted that similar lawsuits had been filed against trading-card makers in the US, without success. The &quot;Pokémon&quot; card suit is not known to have gone to court, and is believed to have been settled.
The &quot;Pokémon&quot; anime series was criticized by some as &quot;cheap Japanese animation&quot; that is &quot;violent&quot; and has &quot;little educational value&quot;. Michelle Orecklin of &quot;Time&quot; dismissed the TV series as &quot;less a cartoon than a half-hour exercise in Pokémon product placement&quot;. Allison (2006) wrote that even those within Pokémon&#x27;s US marketing team agreed that the anime&#x27;s visuals were &quot;not especially sophisticated&quot; compared to Disney cartoons. &quot;Pokémon: The First Movie&quot; premiered in the United States on 12 November 1999, and in European countries in February 2000. While a huge box-office success, the film was received negatively by several Western film critics. &quot;The Guardian&quot; decried it as a &quot;contemptuously cheap animated cash-in on the monster kids&#x27; craze&quot;. The American adult animated series &quot;South Park&quot; satirized &quot;Pokémon&quot; in the episode &quot;Chinpokomon&quot;, aired on 3 November 1999. In the episode, the titular media franchise is portrayed as a low-quality line of products that is part of an evil plan by the Japanese government to invade the US. &quot;South Park&quot; co-creator Matt Stone commented that, at the time, &quot;Pokémon&quot; was &quot;scary huge&quot;.
Kohler (2004) wrote that &quot;Pokémon&quot; was considered &quot;ruthlessly commercial&quot;, and that it &quot;program[med] children to be consumers of anything and everything Pokémon&quot;. CNN quoted child psychiatrist John Lochridge as worrying that &quot;Pokémon&#x27;s creators and marketers deliberately set out to create a fantasy world so compelling that children would quickly become obsessed&quot;. He believed that kids were being &quot;brainwashed&quot;, and said: &quot;I have had parents tell me that they cannot get their kids to do anything except Pokémon, so this stuff seems to really capture their minds, in a way&quot;. These concerns were countered by psychologist William Damon, who told &quot;Newsweek&quot; that obsessing is in fact a normal part of a child&#x27;s neurological development. It should concern parents only when the obsession gets dangerous or excessive. An op-ed in the New Zealander newspaper &quot;The Dominion Post&quot; claimed that the anti-Pokémon sentiment was particularly American: &quot;The backlash, which seems largely confined to the United States, may be no more than the sound of the world&#x27;s leading cultural imperialist gagging on a taste of its own medicine&quot;.
As Pokémania built, Western media started reporting on several crimes associated with &quot;Pokémon&quot;. These included violence (including two reported stabbings), burglaries, robberies (some at knifepoint), and shoplifting. Almost all these incidents were connected to the &quot;Pokémon&quot; cards, and the individuals involved were almost always underage. In the US, the incidents peaked in November 1999. In England, &quot;Pokémon&quot;-related delinquency reached a head in April 2000. High prices on the grey market were a motive behind some of the crimes, &quot;posing a great temptation for older kids and bullies to take advantage of weaker children&quot;. At specialty shops and online auctions, a rare &quot;Pokémon&quot; card could be bought and sold for $50 or more (c. $ in ).
Aside from the negative reactions, many media also cited alleged beneficial effects of &quot;Pokémon&quot;. It was noted that the video games and the cards require children to read, memorize, calculate, and plan out a strategy. Both encourage socialization, and trading Pokémon requires negotiating skills. Stephanie Strom wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that the &quot;Pokémon&quot; anime taught children &quot;traditional Japanese values – responsibility, empathy, cooperation, obedience, respect for elders, humility&quot;. Anne Allison interviewed various American parents during Pokémania. She found that while most of them were &quot;utterly mystified&quot; about &quot;Pokémon&quot;, few were overly worried about it, instead meeting the craze with &quot;befuddled acceptance&quot;. Allison also notes that the Columbine High School massacre occurred during Pokémania (on 20 April 1999), causing violent television, music, and games to be scrutinized. Compared to these media, she notes, &quot;Pokémon&quot; is in fact rather tame.
In contrast, &quot;Pokémon&quot; received far less criticism in its native country of Japan. Yano (2004) attributes this to cultural differences, which includes: 1) greater acceptance of exuberant consumerism – to buy is to be a good citizen; 2) less focus on media influence – instead, Japan&#x27;s educational system, bullying, and dysfunctional families are more often the target of attention; 3) less separation between child- and adulthood – what is suitable for adults is not necessarily considered unsuitable for kids; 4) Pokémon being permeated with &quot;kawaisa&quot; (cuteness), a hallmark of Japanese culture; 5) Japan&#x27;s core religions, Buddhism and Shinto, are less moralizing in nature. However, Oliver Burkeman wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot; that the &quot;Pokémon&quot; cards were also banned from some Japanese schools.

==Legacy and influences==


After World War II, Japan experienced a period of unprecedented growth and became well-known in the Western world for its consumer products, such as radios (e.g. Panasonic, Toshiba), cars (e.g. Toyota, Mitsubishi), and Sony&#x27;s Walkman. From 1991 onwards, its economy stagnated, causing the country to lose its status as an economic superpower. However, during the 1990s and 2000s, Japan re-emerged as a source of &#x27;cool&#x27; cultural goods, embraced by a growing international audience interested in Japanese culture. Nintendo, Sega, and Sony launched several popular video game consoles and franchises. In terms of children&#x27;s properties, the success of &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot; changed perceptions on the viability of such Japanese imports in the West. The Tamagotchi fad (1997–98), centered around a portable digital pet device, was said to have &quot;paved the way for Pokémon&quot;.
Anne Allison (2006) wrote that, before the 1990s, Japan figured little in the face of the worldwide hegemony of Euro-American cultural industries, in particular that of the US. &quot;Hollywood has been hostile to imports&quot;, she wrote, &quot;and foreignness has largely been, and been seen as, an impediment to mass popularization in the United States&quot;. The surprise success of &quot;Pokémon&quot; was &quot;an undeniable breakthrough in the homeland of Disney&quot; that &quot;changed preexisting assumptions about the US marketplace at the same time that it was constantly resisted for deviating from them&quot;. &quot;Pokémon&quot; was a welcomed boon to Japan&#x27;s faltering economy, and positively influenced the country&#x27;s soft power. Kamo (2000) interviewed various American children and found that kids who thought &quot;Pokémon&quot; was cool, were more likely to believe that Japan was a cool nation. Allison (2003) gave a similar finding: all the children she interviewed knew where &quot;Pokémon&quot; originated, and &quot;many said that, as a result of &quot;Pokémon&quot; and other &#x27;cool&#x27; Japanese goods, they had developed an interest in Japan. A number said that they now wanted to study Japanese and travel there one day&quot;. Kohler (2004) wrote: &quot;Japanese are proud of &quot;Pokémon&quot;, the most successful export of Japanese popular culture ever&quot;. Although, Iwabuchi (2004) questioned to what extent &quot;Pokémon&quot; really is &#x27;Japanese&#x27;, and to what extent it is simply a good property with universal appeal. He noted that Japanese nationalist commentators celebrated &quot;Pokémon&quot;″s global success and retrospectively attributed this to its &quot;Japanese cultural power&quot;, while ignoring the localization of &quot;Pokémon&quot; overseas, as well as decades of increasing cooperation and cultural exchange between countries (globalization).
In the 20th century, anime found niche popularity in North America and Europe in series (&quot;Astro Boy&quot;, &quot;Kimba the White Lion&quot;, &quot;Speed Racer&quot;) and films (&quot;Akira&quot;, &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;). The &quot;Pokémon&quot; TV series and films marked a breakthrough for anime, contributing to its growing worldwide success at the turn of the 21st century. For some children, &quot;Pokémon&quot; was their introduction to &#x27;Japanimation&#x27;, serving as a &quot;gateway&quot; to other anime, manga, and Japanese culture in general. &quot;Pokémon: The First Movie&quot; became one of the most successful Japanese animated films in history. After &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot;, &quot;Pokémon: The First Movie&quot; became the second anime film to open at mainstream cinemas in the West, as opposed to the usual art house venues. Pioneering anime importer John Ledford noted that &quot;Pokémon&quot; underscored the commercial potential of anime, thus making it interesting from a business perspective.
In the field of video games, the main &quot;Pokémon&quot; series became the standard within the monster-taming game genre, a subtype of RPGs. While not the first to use this concept, the &quot;Pokémon&quot; games became so synonymous with it that later titles involving catching and training monsters, of any genre, were inevitably compared to &quot;Pokémon&quot;. Examples of this include &quot;Dragon Warrior Monsters&quot; (1998), &quot;Robopon Sun&quot; and &quot;Star&quot; (1998), &quot;Spectrobes&quot; (2007), &quot;Invizimals&quot; (2009), &quot;Monster Crown&quot; (2021), and &quot;Palworld&quot; (2024).
The success of &quot;Pokémon&quot; encouraged companies to look for other popular Japanese properties that might be localized for Western markets. The importing of at least three similar franchises were confirmed by business executives to have been (partly) inspired by &quot;Pokémon&quot;: &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot;, &quot;Digimon&quot;, and &quot;Monster Rancher&quot;. The import of &quot;Cardcaptor Sakura&quot; (as &quot;Cardcaptors&quot;) might also have been prompted by &quot;Pokémon&quot;.

<text>Paul the Deacon ( 720s 13 April in 796, 797, 798, or 799 AD), also known as &quot;Paulus Diaconus&quot;, &quot;Warnefridus&quot;, &quot;Barnefridus&quot;, or &quot;Winfridus&quot;, and sometimes suffixed &quot;Cassinensis&quot; (&quot;i.e.&quot; &quot;of Monte Cassino&quot;), was a Benedictine monk, scribe, and historian of the Lombards.

==Life==
An ancestor of Paulus&#x27;s named Leupichis emigrated to Italy in 568 in the train of Alboin, King of the Lombards. There, he was granted lands at or near &quot;Forum Julii&quot; (Cividale del Friuli). During an invasion by the Avars, Leupichis&#x27;s five sons were carried away to Pannonia, but one of them, his namesake, returned to Italy and restored the ruined fortunes of his house. The grandson of the younger Leupichis was Warnefrid, who by his wife Theodelinda became the father of Paul. Paulus was his monastic name; he was born Winfrid, son of Warnefrid, about 720 in the Duchy of Friuli.

Thanks to the possible noble status of his family, Paul received an exceptionally good education, probably at the court of the Lombard king Ratchis in Pavia, learning the rudiments of Greek from a teacher named Flavian. Paul was probably the secretary of the Lombard king Desiderius, a successor of Ratchis. After Desiderius&#x27;s daughter Adelperga had married Arichis II, duke of Benevento, Paul, at her request, wrote his continuation of Eutropius&#x27;s &quot;Summary of Roman History&quot; (Latin: ).

He lived at the court of Benevento for at least several years before 774, when Charlemagne captured Pavia, and he may have fled the city during that conquest. Eventually he entered a monastery on Lake Como, and before 782 he entered the great Benedictine house of Monte Cassino, where he made the acquaintance of Charlemagne. Around 776, Paul&#x27;s brother Arichis was carried off to Francia as a prisoner after a revolt in Friuli. When Charlemagne visited Rome five years later, Paul wrote to him on behalf of Arichis, who was then freed.

After Paul&#x27;s literary achievements had drawn the attention of Charlemagne, he became an important contributor to the Carolingian Renaissance. In 787 he returned to Monte Cassino, where he died on 13 April probably in the year 799. His epithet &quot;Diaconus&quot; indicates that he took orders as a deacon; and some believe he was a monk before the fall of the Lombard Kingdom.

==Works==
Paul&#x27;s chief work is his &quot;Historia Langobardorum&quot;, an incomplete history in six books that he wrote after 787 but no later than 795–96. It covers the history of the Langobards from their legendary origins in the north (in &quot;Scadinavia&quot;) and their subsequent migrations—notably to Italy in 568–69—to the death of King Liutprand in 744. The books contain much information about the Eastern Roman Empire, the Franks, and other peoples. The history is written from a Lombardian point of view and is especially valuable for its depictions of the relations between the Franks and the Lombards. It begins:

Among Paul&#x27;s sources were the document called the &quot;Origo gentis Langobardorum&quot;, the &quot;Liber pontificalis&quot;, the lost history of Secundus of Trent, and the lost annals of Benevento. He also heavily drew upon the works of Bede, Gregory of Tours, and Isidore of Seville.

Related to his history of the Langobards is Paul&#x27;s &quot;Historia Romana&quot;; this is a continuation of Eutropius&#x27;s &quot;Breviarium&quot;, which covers the period 364–553 CE. Paul compiled the &quot;Historia Romana&quot; at Benevento between 766 and 771. He is said to have advised Adelperga to read Eutropius; she did, but complained that this pagan writer said nothing about ecclesiastical affairs and stopped with the accession of the Emperor Valens in 364. Consequently, Paul interwove extracts from the Scriptures, from ecclesiastical historians, and from other sources with the writings of Eutropius. The six books he ultimately added thus carried Lombardian history down to 553. This work, which was very popular during the Middle Ages, has value for its early historical presentation of the end of the Roman Empire in Western Europe. It was edited by Hans Droysen and published in the &quot;Monumenta Germaniae Historica. Auctores antiquissimi&quot; series, Band ii. (1879) as well as by A. Crivellucci, in &quot;Fonti per la storia d&#x27; Italia&quot;, N° 51 (1914).

At the request of Angilram, Bishop of Metz (d. 791), Paul wrote a history of the bishops of Metz to 766, the first work of its kind north of the Alps. This was translated into English in 2013 as &quot;Liber de episcopis Mettensibus&quot;. He also wrote many letters, verses, and epitaphs, including those of Duke/Prince Arichis II of Benevento and of many members of the Carolingian family. Some of these letters were published with the &quot;Historia Langobardorum&quot; in the &quot;Monumenta&quot;; poems and epitaphs edited by Ernst Dümmler were published in the &quot;Poetae latini aevi carolini&quot;, Band i. (Berlin, 1881). Fresher material having come to light, a newer edition of the poems (&quot;Die Gedichte des Paulus Diaconus&quot;) was edited by Karl Neff (Munich, 1908). Neff denied, however, that Paul had written the most famous poem in the collection, the hymn to St. John the Baptist , which Guido of Arezzo set to a melody that had previously been used for Horace&#x27;s &quot;Ode&quot; . From the initial syllables of the first verses of the resultant setting, Guido then took the names of the first notes of the musical scale. Paul also wrote an epitome, which has survived, of Sextus Pompeius Festus&#x27;s &quot;De verborum significatu&quot;, which he dedicated to Charlemagne.

While Paul was in Francia, Charlemagne asked him to compile a collection of homilies. Paul granted this request after returning to Monte Cassino; the compilation was largely used in the Frankish churches. Paul also composed two important homilies &quot;In Assumptione&quot;, in the second of which, unlike Ambrose Autpert, he admits the possibility of Mary&#x27;s bodily assumption into heaven.

A life of Pope Gregory the Great has also been attributed to Paul, and he is credited with a Latin translation of the Greek &quot;Life of Saint Mary the Egyptian&quot;.

<doc id="23747" wikidata="Q107429" url="?curid=23747" title="Peroxide">
<text>In chemistry, peroxides are a group of compounds with the structure , where the R&#x27;s represent a radical (a portion of a complete molecule; not necessarily a free radical) and O&#x27;s are single oxygen atoms. Oxygen atoms are joined to each other and to adjacent elements through single covalent bonds, denoted by dashes or lines. The group in a peroxide is often called the peroxide group, though some nomenclature discrepancies exist. This linkage is recognized as a common polyatomic ion, and exists in many molecules. 

== General structure ==

The characteristic structure of any regular peroxide is the oxygen-oxygen covalent single bond, which connects the two main atoms together. In the event that the molecule has no chemical substituents, the peroxide group will have a [-2] net charge. Each oxygen atom has a charge of negative one, as 5 of its valence electrons remain in the outermost orbital shell whilst one is occupied in the covalent bond. Because of the nature of the covalent bond, this arrangement results in each atom having the equivalent of 7 valence electrons, reducing the oxygens and giving them a negative charge. This charge is affected by the addition of other elements, with the properties and structure changing depending on the added group(s).

== Common forms ==

The most common peroxide is hydrogen peroxide (), colloquially known simply as &quot;peroxide&quot;. It is marketed as solutions in water at various concentrations. Many organic peroxides are known as well.

In addition to hydrogen peroxide, some other major classes of peroxides are:

* Peroxy acids, the peroxy derivatives of many familiar acids, examples being peroxymonosulfuric acid and peracetic acid, and their salts, one example of which is potassium peroxydisulfate.
* Main group peroxides, compounds with the linkage (E = main group element).
* Metal peroxides, examples being barium peroxide (), sodium peroxide () and zinc peroxide ().
* Organic peroxides, compounds with the linkage or . One example is &quot;tert&quot;-butylhydroperoxide.


== Nomenclature ==
The linkage between the oxygen molecules is known as a peroxy group (sometimes called peroxo group, peroxyl group, of peroxy linkage). The nomenclature of the peroxy group is somewhat variable, and exists as an exception to the rules of naming polyatomic ions. This is because, when it was discovered, it was believed to be monatomic. The term was introduced by Thomas Thomson in 1804 for a compound combined with as much oxygen as possible, or the oxide with the greatest quantity of oxygen.

<text>Photolithography (also known as optical lithography) is a process used in the manufacturing of integrated circuits. It involves using light to transfer a pattern onto a substrate, typically a silicon wafer.

The process begins with a photosensitive material, called a photoresist, being applied to the substrate. A photomask that contains the desired pattern is then placed over the photoresist. Light is shone through the photomask, exposing the photoresist in certain areas. The exposed areas undergo a chemical change, making them either soluble or insoluble in a developer solution. After development, the pattern is transferred onto the substrate through etching, chemical vapor deposition, or ion implantation processes.

Ultraviolet (UV) light is typically used.

Photolithography processes can be classified according to the type of light used, including ultraviolet lithography, deep ultraviolet lithography, extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL), and X-ray lithography. The wavelength of light used determines the minimum feature size that can be formed in the photoresist.

Photolithography is the most common method for the semiconductor fabrication of integrated circuits (&quot;ICs&quot; or &quot;chips&quot;), such as solid-state memories and microprocessors. It can create extremely small patterns, down to a few nanometers in size. It provides precise control of the shape and size of the objects it creates. It can create patterns over an entire wafer in a single step, quickly and with relatively low cost. In complex integrated circuits, a wafer may go through the photolithographic cycle as many as 50 times. It is also an important technique for microfabrication in general, such as the fabrication of microelectromechanical systems. However, photolithography cannot be used to produce masks on surfaces that are not perfectly flat. And, like all chip manufacturing processes, it requires extremely clean operating conditions.

Photolithography is a subclass of microlithography, the general term for processes that generate patterned thin films. Other technologies in this broader class include the use of steerable electron beams, or more rarely, nanoimprinting, interference, magnetic fields, or scanning probes. On a broader level, it may compete with directed self-assembly of micro- and nanostructures.

Photolithography shares some fundamental principles with photography in that the pattern in the photoresist is created by exposing it to light — either directly by projection through a lens, or by illuminating a mask placed directly over the substrate, as in contact printing. The technique can also be seen as a high precision version of the method used to make printed circuit boards. The name originated from a loose analogy with the traditional photographic method of producing plates for lithographic printing on paper; however, subsequent stages in the process have more in common with etching than with traditional lithography.

Conventional photoresists typically consist of three components: resin, sensitizer, and solvent.

== Etymology ==
The root words &quot;photo&quot;, &quot;litho&quot;, and &quot;graphy&quot; all have Greek origins, with the meanings &#x27;light&#x27;, &#x27;stone&#x27; and &#x27;writing&#x27; respectively. As suggested by the name compounded from them, &quot;photolithography&quot; is a printing method (originally based on the use of limestone printing plates) in which light plays an essential role.

== History ==

In the 1820s, Nicephore Niepce invented a photographic process that used Bitumen of Judea, a natural asphalt, as the first photoresist. A thin coating of the bitumen on a sheet of metal, glass or stone became less soluble where it was exposed to light; the unexposed parts could then be rinsed away with a suitable solvent, baring the material beneath, which was then chemically etched in an acid bath to produce a printing plate. The light-sensitivity of bitumen was very poor and very long exposures were required, but despite the later introduction of more sensitive alternatives, its low cost and superb resistance to strong acids prolonged its commercial life into the early 20th century.

In 1940, Oskar Süß created a &quot;positive&quot; photoresist by using diazonaphthoquinone, which worked in the opposite manner: the coating was initially insoluble and was rendered soluble where it was exposed to light. In 1954, Louis Plambeck Jr. developed the Dycryl polymeric letterpress plate, which made the platemaking process faster. Development of photoresists used to be carried out in batches of wafers (batch processing) dipped into a bath of developer, but modern process offerings do development one wafer at a time (single wafer processing) to improve process control.

In 1957 Jules Andrus patented a photolitographic process for semiconductor fabrication, while working at Bell Labs. At the same time Moe Abramson and Stanislaus Danko of the US Army Signal Corps developed a technique for printing circuits.

In 1952, the U.S. military assigned Jay W. Lathrop and James R. Nall at the National Bureau of Standards (later the U.S. Army Diamond Ordnance Fuze Laboratory, which eventually merged to form the now-present Army Research Laboratory) with the task of finding a way to reduce the size of electronic circuits in order to better fit the necessary circuitry in the limited space available inside a proximity fuze. Inspired by the application of photoresist, a photosensitive liquid used to mark the boundaries of rivet holes in metal aircraft wings, Nall determined that a similar process can be used to protect the germanium in the transistors and even pattern the surface with light. During development, Lathrop and Nall were successful in creating a 2D miniaturized hybrid integrated circuit with transistors using this technique. In 1958, during the IRE Professional Group on Electron Devices (PGED) conference in Washington, D.C., they presented the first paper to describe the fabrication of transistors using photographic techniques and adopted the term &quot;photolithography&quot; to describe the process, marking the first published use of the term to describe semiconductor device patterning.

Despite the fact that photolithography of electronic components concerns etching metal duplicates, rather than etching stone to produce a &quot;master&quot; as in conventional lithographic printing, Lathrop and Nall chose the term &quot;photolithography&quot; over &quot;photoetching&quot; because the former sounded &quot;high tech.&quot; A year after the conference, Lathrop and Nall&#x27;s patent on photolithography was formally approved on June 9, 1959. Photolithography would later contribute to the development of the first semiconductor ICs as well as the first microchips.

== Process ==

A single iteration of photolithography combines several steps in sequence. Modern cleanrooms use automated, robotic wafer track systems to coordinate the process. The procedure described here omits some advanced treatments, such as thinning agents. The photolithography process is carried out by the wafer track and stepper/scanner, and the wafer track system and the stepper/scanner are installed side by side. Wafer track systems are also known as wafer coater/developer systems, which perform the same functions. Wafer tracks are named after the &quot;tracks&quot; used to carry wafers inside the machine, but modern machines do not use tracks.

=== Cleaning ===
If organic or inorganic contaminations are present on the wafer surface, they are usually removed by wet chemical treatment, e.g. the RCA clean procedure based on solutions containing hydrogen peroxide. Other solutions made with trichloroethylene, acetone or methanol can also be used to clean.

=== Preparation ===
The wafer is initially heated to a temperature sufficient to drive off any moisture that may be present on the wafer surface; 150 °C for ten minutes is sufficient. Wafers that have been in storage must be chemically cleaned to remove contamination. A liquid or gaseous &quot;adhesion promoter&quot;, such as Bis(trimethylsilyl)amine (&quot;hexamethyldisilazane&quot;, HMDS), is applied to promote adhesion of the photoresist to the wafer. The surface layer of silicon dioxide on the wafer reacts with HMDS to form tri-methylated silicon-dioxide, a highly water repellent layer not unlike the layer of wax on a car&#x27;s paint. This water repellent layer prevents the aqueous developer from penetrating between the photoresist layer and the wafer&#x27;s surface, thus preventing so-called lifting of small photoresist structures in the (developing) pattern. In order to ensure the development of the image, it is best covered and placed over a hot plate and let it dry while stabilizing the temperature at 120 °C.

=== Photoresist application ===
The wafer is covered with photoresist liquid by spin coating. Thus, the top layer of resist is quickly ejected from the wafer&#x27;s edge while the bottom layer still creeps slowly radially along the wafer. In this way, any &#x27;bump&#x27; or &#x27;ridge&#x27; of resist is removed, leaving a very flat layer. However, viscous films may result in large edge beads which are areas at the edges of the wafer or photomask with increased resist thickness whose planarization has physical limits. Often, Edge bead removal (EBR) is carried out, usually with a nozzle, to remove this extra resist as it could otherwise cause particulate contamination.
Final thickness is also determined by the evaporation of liquid solvents from the resist. For very small, dense features (&lt; 125 or so nm), lower resist thicknesses (&lt; 0.5 microns) are needed to overcome collapse effects at high aspect ratios; typical aspect ratios are &lt; 4:1.

The photoresist-coated wafer is then prebaked to drive off excess photoresist solvent, typically at 90 to 100 °C for 30 to 60 seconds on a hotplate. A BARC coating (Bottom Anti-Reflectant Coating) may be applied before the photoresist is applied, to avoid reflections from occurring under the photoresist and to improve the photoresist&#x27;s performance at smaller semiconductor nodes such as 45 nm and below. Top Anti-Reflectant Coatings (TARCs) also exist. EUV lithography is unique in the sense it allows for the use of photoresists with metal oxides.

=== Exposure and developing ===
After prebaking, the photoresist is exposed to a pattern of intense light. The exposure to light causes a chemical change that allows some of the photoresist to be removed by a special solution, called &quot;developer&quot; by analogy with photographic developer. Positive photoresist, the most common type, becomes soluble in the developer when exposed; with negative photoresist, unexposed regions are soluble in the developer.

A post-exposure bake (PEB) is performed before developing, typically to help reduce standing wave phenomena caused by the destructive and constructive interference patterns of the incident light. In deep ultraviolet lithography, chemically amplified resist (CAR) chemistry is used. This resist is much more sensitive to PEB time, temperature, and delay, as the resist works by creating acid when it is hit by photons, and then undergoes an &quot;exposure&quot; reaction (creating acid, making the polymer soluble in the basic developer, and performing a chemical reaction catalyzed by acid) which mostly occurs in the PEB.

The develop chemistry is delivered on a spinner, much like photoresist. Developers originally often contained sodium hydroxide (NaOH). However, sodium is considered an extremely undesirable contaminant in MOSFET fabrication because it degrades the insulating properties of gate oxides (specifically, sodium ions can migrate in and out of the gate, changing the threshold voltage of the transistor and making it harder or easier to turn the transistor on over time). Metal-ion-free developers such as tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) are now used. The temperature of the developer might be tightly controlled using jacketed (dual walled) hoses to within 0.2 °C. The nozzle that coats the wafer with developer may influence the amount of developer that is necessary.

The resulting wafer is then &quot;hard-baked&quot; if a non-chemically amplified resist was used, typically at 120 to 180 °C for 20 to 30 minutes. The hard bake solidifies the remaining photoresist, to make a more durable protecting layer in future ion implantation, wet chemical etching, or plasma etching.

From preparation until this step, the photolithography procedure has been carried out by two machines: the photolithography stepper or scanner, and the coater/developer. The two machines are usually installed side by side, and are &quot;linked&quot; together.

=== Etching, implantation ===
In etching, a liquid (&quot;wet&quot;) or plasma (&quot;dry&quot;) chemical agent removes the uppermost layer of the substrate in the areas that are not protected by photoresist. In semiconductor fabrication, dry etching techniques are generally used, as they can be made anisotropic, in order to avoid significant undercutting of the photoresist pattern. This is essential when the width of the features to be defined is similar to or less than the thickness of the material being etched (i.e. when the aspect ratio approaches unity). Wet etch processes are generally isotropic in nature, which is often indispensable for microelectromechanical systems, where suspended structures must be &quot;released&quot; from the underlying layer.

The development of low-defectivity anisotropic dry-etch process has enabled the ever-smaller features defined photolithographically in the resist to be transferred to the substrate material.

=== Photoresist removal ===
After a photoresist is no longer needed, it must be removed from the substrate. This usually requires a liquid &quot;resist stripper&quot;, which chemically alters the resist so that it no longer adheres to the substrate. Alternatively, the photoresist may be removed by a plasma containing oxygen, which oxidizes it. This process is called plasma ashing and resembles dry etching. The use of 1-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent for photoresist is another method used to remove an image. When the resist has been dissolved, the solvent can be removed by heating to 80 °C without leaving any residue.

== Exposure (&quot;printing&quot;) systems ==

Exposure systems typically produce an image on the wafer using a photomask. The photomask blocks light in some areas and lets it pass in others. (Maskless lithography projects a precise beam directly onto the wafer without using a mask, but it is not widely used in commercial processes.) Exposure systems may be classified by the optics that transfer the image from the mask to the wafer.

Photolithography produces better thin film transistor structures than printed electronics, due to smoother printed layers, less wavy patterns, and more accurate drain-source electrode registration.

=== Contact and proximity ===
A contact aligner, the simplest exposure system, puts a photomask in direct contact with the wafer and exposes it to a uniform light. A proximity aligner puts a small gap of around 5 microns between the photomask and wafer. In both cases, the mask covers the entire wafer, and simultaneously patterns every die.

Contact printing/lithography is liable to damage both the mask and the wafer, and this was the primary reason it was abandoned for high volume production. Both contact and proximity lithography require the light intensity to be uniform across an entire wafer, and the mask to align precisely to features already on the wafer. As modern processes use increasingly large wafers, these conditions become increasingly difficult.

Research and prototyping processes often use contact or proximity lithography, because it uses inexpensive hardware and can achieve high optical resolution. The resolution in proximity lithography is approximately the square root of the product of the wavelength and the gap distance. Hence, except for projection lithography (see below), contact printing offers the best resolution, because its gap distance is approximately zero (neglecting the thickness of the photoresist itself). In addition, nanoimprint lithography may revive interest in this familiar technique, especially since the cost of ownership is expected to be low; however, the shortcomings of contact printing discussed above remain as challenges.

=== Projection ===
Very-large-scale integration (VLSI) lithography uses projection systems. Unlike contact or proximity masks, which cover an entire wafer, projection masks (known as &quot;reticles&quot;) show only one die or an array of dies (known as a &quot;field&quot;) in a portion of the wafer at a time. Projection exposure systems (steppers or scanners) project the mask onto the wafer many times, changing the position of the wafer with every projection, to create the complete pattern, fully patterning the wafer. The difference between steppers and scanners is that, during exposure, a scanner moves the photomask and the wafer simultaneously, while a stepper only moves the wafer. Contact, proximity and projection Mask aligners preceded steppers
 and do not move the photomask nor the wafer during exposure and use masks that cover the entire wafer. Immersion lithography scanners use a layer of Ultrapure water between the lens and the wafer to increase resolution. An alternative to photolithography is nanoimprint lithography. The maximum size of the image that can be projected onto a wafer is known as the reticle limit.

== Photomasks ==
The image for the mask originates from a computerized data file. This data file is converted to a series of polygons and written onto a square of fused quartz substrate covered with a layer of chromium using a photolithographic process. A laser beam (laser writer) or a beam of electrons (e-beam writer) is used to expose the pattern defined by the data file and travels over the surface of the substrate in either a vector or raster scan manner. Where the photoresist on the mask is exposed, the chrome can be etched away, leaving a clear path for the illumination light in the stepper/scanner system to travel through.

== Resolution in projection systems ==

The ability to project a clear image of a small feature onto the wafer is limited by the wavelength of the light that is used, and the ability of the reduction lens system to capture enough diffraction orders from the illuminated mask. Current state-of-the-art photolithography tools use deep ultraviolet (DUV) light from excimer lasers with wavelengths of 248 (KrF) and
193 (ArF) nm (the dominant lithography technology today is thus also called &quot;excimer laser lithography&quot;), which allow minimum feature sizes down to 50 nm. Excimer laser lithography has thus played a critical role in the continued advance of the Moore&#x27;s Law for the last 20 years (see below).

The minimum feature size that a projection system can print is given approximately by:

:formula_1
where formula_2 is the minimum feature size (also called the critical dimension, target design rule, or &quot;half-pitch&quot;), formula_3 is the wavelength of light used, and formula_4 is the numerical aperture of the lens as seen from the wafer.

formula_5 (commonly called &quot;k1 factor&quot;) is a coefficient that encapsulates process-related factors and typically equals 0.4 for production. (formula_5 is actually a function of process factors such as the angle of incident light on a reticle and the incident light intensity distribution. It is fixed per process.) The minimum feature size can be reduced by decreasing this coefficient through computational lithography.

According to this equation, minimum feature sizes can be decreased by decreasing the wavelength, and increasing the numerical aperture (to achieve a tighter focused beam and a smaller spot size). However, this design method runs into a competing constraint. In modern systems, the depth of focus is also a concern:

:formula_7

Here, formula_8 is another process-related coefficient. The depth of focus restricts the thickness of the photoresist and the depth of the topography on the wafer. Chemical mechanical polishing is often used to flatten topography before high-resolution lithographic steps.

From classical optics, k1=0.61 by the Rayleigh criterion. The image of two points separated by less than 1.22 wavelength/NA will not maintain that separation but will be larger due to the interference between the Airy discs of the two points. It must also be remembered, though, that the distance between two features can also change with defocus.

Resolution is also nontrivial in a two-dimensional context. For example, a tighter line pitch results in wider gaps (in the perpendicular direction) between the ends of the lines. More fundamentally, straight edges become rounded for shortened rectangular features, where both x and y pitches are near the resolution limit.

For advanced nodes, blur, rather than wavelength, becomes the key resolution-limiting factor. Minimum pitch is given by blur sigma/0.14. Blur is affected by dose as well as quantum yield, leading to a tradeoff with stochastic defects, in the case of EUV.

==Stochastic effects==

As light consists of photons, at low doses the image quality ultimately depends on the photon number. This affects the use of extreme ultraviolet lithography or EUVL, which is limited to the use of low doses on the order of 20 photons/nm2.
This is due to fewer photons for the same energy dose for a shorter wavelength (higher energy per photon). With fewer photons making up the image, there is noise in the edge placement.

The stochastic effects would become more complicated with larger pitch patterns with more diffraction orders and using more illumination source points.

Secondary electrons in EUV lithography aggravate the stochastic characteristics.

== Light sources ==

Historically, photolithography has used ultraviolet light from gas-discharge lamps using mercury, sometimes in combination with noble gases such as xenon. These lamps produce light across a broad spectrum with several strong peaks in the ultraviolet range. This spectrum is filtered to select a single spectral line. From the early 1960s through the mid-1980s, Hg lamps had been used in lithography for their spectral lines at 436 nm (&quot;g-line&quot;), 405 nm (&quot;h-line&quot;) and 365 nm (&quot;i-line&quot;). However, with the semiconductor industry&#x27;s need for both higher resolution (to produce denser and faster chips) and higher throughput (for lower costs), lamp-based lithography tools were no longer able to meet the industry&#x27;s high-end requirements.

This challenge was overcome in 1982 when excimer laser lithography was proposed and demonstrated at IBM by Kanti Jain. Excimer laser lithography machines (steppers and scanners) became the primary tools in microelectronics production, and has enabled minimum features sizes in chip manufacturing to shrink from 800 nanometers in 1990 to 7 nanometers in 2018. From an even broader scientific and technological perspective, in the 50-year history of the laser since its first demonstration in 1960, the invention and development of excimer laser lithography has been recognized as a major milestone.

The commonly used deep ultraviolet excimer lasers in lithography systems are the krypton fluoride (KrF) laser at 248 nm wavelength and the argon fluoride laser (ArF) at 193 nm wavelength. The primary manufacturers of excimer laser light sources in the 1980s were Lambda Physik (now part of Coherent, Inc.) and Lumonics. Since the mid-1990s Cymer Inc. has become the dominant supplier of excimer laser sources to the lithography equipment manufacturers, with Gigaphoton Inc. as their closest rival. Generally, an excimer laser is designed to operate with a specific gas mixture; therefore, changing wavelength is not a trivial matter, as the method of generating the new wavelength is completely different, and the absorption characteristics of materials change. For example, air begins to absorb significantly around the 193 nm wavelength; moving to sub-193 nm wavelengths would require installing vacuum pump and purge equipment on the lithography tools (a significant challenge). An inert gas atmosphere can sometimes be used as a substitute for a vacuum, to avoid the need for hard plumbing. Furthermore, insulating materials such as silicon dioxide, when exposed to photons with energy greater than the band gap, release free electrons and holes which subsequently cause adverse charging.

Optical lithography has been extended to feature sizes below 50 nm using the 193 nm ArF excimer laser and liquid immersion techniques. Also termed immersion lithography, this enables the use of optics with numerical apertures exceeding 1.0. The liquid used is typically ultra-pure, deionised water, which provides for a refractive index above that of the usual air gap between the lens and the wafer surface. The water is continually circulated to eliminate thermally-induced distortions. Water will only allow &quot;NA&quot;&#x27;s of up to ~1.4, but fluids with higher refractive indices would allow the effective &quot;NA&quot; to be increased further.

Experimental tools using the 157 nm wavelength from the F2 excimer laser in a manner similar to current exposure systems have been built. These were once targeted to succeed 193 nm lithography at the 65 nm feature size node but have now all but been eliminated by the introduction of immersion lithography. This was due to persistent technical problems with the 157 nm technology and economic considerations that provided strong incentives for the continued use of 193 nm excimer laser lithography technology. High-index immersion lithography is the newest extension of 193 nm lithography to be considered. In 2006, features less than 30 nm were demonstrated by IBM using this technique. These systems used CaF2 calcium fluoride lenses. Immersion lithography at 157 nm was explored.

UV excimer lasers have been demonstrated to about 126 nm (for Ar2*). Mercury arc lamps are designed to maintain a steady DC current of 50 to 150 Volts, however excimer lasers have a higher resolution. Excimer lasers are gas-based light systems that are usually filled with inert and halide gases (Kr, Ar, Xe, F and Cl) that are charged by an electric field. The higher the frequency, the greater the resolution of the image. KrF lasers are able to function at a frequency of 4 kHz . In addition to running at a higher frequency, excimer lasers are compatible with more advanced machines than mercury arc lamps are. They are also able to operate from greater distances (up to 25 meters) and are able to maintain their accuracy with a series of mirrors and antireflective-coated lenses. By setting up multiple lasers and mirrors, the amount of energy loss is minimized, also since the lenses are coated with antireflective material, the light intensity remains relatively the same from when it left the laser to when it hits the wafer.

Lasers have been used to indirectly generate non-coherent extreme UV (EUV) light at 13.5 nm for extreme ultraviolet lithography. The EUV light is not emitted by the laser, but rather by a tin or xenon plasma which is excited by an excimer or laser. This technique does not require a synchrotron, and EUV sources, as noted, do not produce coherent light. However vacuum systems and a number of novel technologies (including much higher EUV energies than are now produced) are needed to work with UV at the edge of the X-ray spectrum (which begins at 10 nm). As of 2020, EUV is in mass production use by leading edge foundries such as TSMC and Samsung.

Theoretically, an alternative light source for photolithography, especially if and when wavelengths continue to decrease to extreme UV or X-ray, is the free-electron laser (or one might say xaser for an X-ray device). Free-electron lasers can produce high quality beams at arbitrary wavelengths.

Visible and infrared femtosecond lasers were also applied for lithography. In that case photochemical reactions are initiated by multiphoton absorption. Usage of these light sources have a lot of benefits, including possibility to manufacture true 3D objects and process non-photosensitized (pure) glass-like materials with superb optical resiliency.

== Experimental methods ==

Photolithography has been defeating predictions of its demise for many years. For instance, by the early 1980s, many in the semiconductor industry had come to believe that features smaller than 1 micron could not be printed optically. Modern techniques using excimer laser lithography already print features with dimensions a fraction of the wavelength of light used – an amazing optical feat. New techniques such as immersion lithography, dual-tone resist and multiple patterning continue to improve the resolution of 193 nm lithography. Meanwhile, current research is exploring alternatives to conventional UV, such as electron beam lithography, X-ray lithography, extreme ultraviolet lithography and ion projection lithography. Extreme ultraviolet lithography has entered mass production use, as of 2018 by Samsung and other manufacturers have followed suit.

Massively parallel electron beam lithography has been explored as an alternative to photolithography, and was tested by TSMC, but it did not succeed and the technology from the main developer of the technique, MAPPER, was purchased by ASML, although electron beam lithography was at one point used in chip production by IBM. Electron beam lithography is only used in niche applications such as photomask production.

== Economy ==
In 2001 NIST publication has reported that photolithography process constituted about 35% of total cost of a wafer processing costs.

In 2021, the photolithography industry was valued over 8 billion USD.

<text>The platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus), sometimes referred to as the duck-billed platypus, is a semiaquatic, egg-laying mammal endemic to eastern Australia, including Tasmania. The platypus is the sole living representative or monotypic taxon of its family Ornithorhynchidae and genus &quot;Ornithorhynchus&quot;, though a number of related species appear in the fossil record.

Together with the four species of echidna, it is one of the five species of monotremes, mammals that lay eggs instead of giving birth to live young. Like other monotremes, the platypus has a sense of electrolocation, which it uses to detect prey in cloudy water. It is one of the few species of venomous mammals, as the male platypus has a spur on the hind foot that delivers an extremely painful venom.

The unusual appearance of this egg-laying, duck-billed, beaver-tailed, otter-footed mammal at first baffled European naturalists. In 1799, the first scientists to examine a preserved platypus body judged it a fake made of several animals sewn together.

The unique features of the platypus make it important in the study of evolutionary biology, and a recognisable and iconic symbol of Australia. It is culturally significant to several Aboriginal peoples, who also used to hunt it for food. It has appeared as a national mascot, features on the reverse of the Australian twenty-cent coin, and is an emblem of the state of New South Wales.

The platypus was hunted for its fur, but it has been a legally protected species in all states where it occurs since 1912. Its population is not under severe threat, although captive-breeding programs have had slight success, and it is vulnerable to pollution. It is classified as a near-threatened species by the IUCN, but a November 2020 report has recommended that it be upgraded to threatened species under the federal &quot;EPBC Act&quot;, due to habitat destruction and declining numbers in all states.

== Taxonomy and naming ==
Australian Aboriginal people name or have named the platypus in various ways depending on Australian indigenous languages and dialects. Among the names found: &quot;boondaburra&quot;, &quot;mallingong&quot;, &quot;tambreet&quot;, &quot;watjarang&quot; (names in Yass, Murrumbidgee, and Tumut), &quot;tohunbuck&quot; (region of Goomburra, Darling Downs), &quot;dulaiwarrung&quot; or &quot;dulai warrung&quot; (Woiwurrung language, Wurundjeri, Victoria), &quot;djanbang&quot; (Bundjalung, Queensland), &quot;djumulung&quot; (Yuin language, Yuin, New South Wales), &quot;maluŋgaŋ&quot; (ngunnawal language, Ngunnawal, Australian Capital Territory), &quot;biladurang&quot;, &quot;wamul&quot;, &quot;dyiimalung&quot;, &quot;oornie&quot;, &quot;dungidany&quot; (Wiradjuri language, Wiradjuri, Vic, NSW), &quot;oonah&quot;, etc. The name chosen and approved in Palawa kani (reconstructed tasmanian language) is &quot;larila&quot;.

When the platypus was first encountered by Europeans in 1798, a pelt and sketch were sent back to Great Britain by Captain John Hunter, the second Governor of New South Wales. British scientists&#x27; initial hunch was that the attributes were a hoax. George Shaw, who produced the first description of the animal in the &quot;Naturalist&#x27;s Miscellany&quot; in 1799, stated it was impossible not to entertain doubts as to its genuine nature, and Robert Knox believed it might have been produced by some Asian taxidermist. It was thought somebody had sewn a duck&#x27;s beak onto the body of a beaver-like animal. Shaw even took a pair of scissors to the dried skin to check for stitches.

The common name &quot;platypus&quot; literally means &#x27;flat-foot&#x27;, deriving from the Greek word (), from ( &#x27;broad, wide, flat&#x27;) and ( &#x27;foot&#x27;). Shaw initially assigned the species the Linnaean name &quot;Platypus anatinus&quot; when he described it, but the genus term was quickly discovered to already be in use as the name of the wood-boring ambrosia beetle genus &quot;Platypus&quot;. It was independently described as &quot;Ornithorhynchus paradoxus&quot; by Johann Blumenbach in 1800 (from a specimen given to him by Sir Joseph Banks) and following the rules of priority of nomenclature, it was later officially recognised as &quot;Ornithorhynchus anatinus&quot;.

There is no universally agreed plural form of &quot;platypus&quot; in the English language. Scientists generally use &quot;platypuses&quot; or simply &quot;platypus&quot;. Alternatively, the term &quot;platypi&quot; is also used for the plural, although this is a form of pseudo-Latin; going by the word&#x27;s Greek roots the plural would be &quot;platypodes&quot;. Early British settlers called it by many names, such as &quot;watermole&quot;, &quot;duckbill&quot;, and &quot;duckmole&quot;. Occasionally it is specifically called the &quot;duck-billed platypus&quot;.

The scientific name &quot;Ornithorhynchus anatinus&quot; literally means &#x27;duck-like bird-snout&#x27;, deriving its genus name from the Greek root ( &quot;ornith&quot; or &quot;órnīs&quot; &#x27;bird&#x27;) and the word ( &#x27;snout&#x27;, &#x27;beak&#x27;). Its species name is derived from Latin (&#x27;duck-like&#x27;) from &#x27;duck&#x27;. The platypus is the sole living representative or monotypic taxon of its family (Ornithorhynchidae).
== Description ==
In David Collins&#x27;s account of the new colony 1788–1801, he describes &quot;an amphibious animal, of the mole species&quot;, with a drawing.

The body and the broad, flat tail of the platypus are covered with dense, brown, biofluorescent fur that traps a layer of insulating air to keep the animal warm. The fur is waterproof, and textured like that of a mole. The platypus&#x27;s tail stores fat reserves, an adaptation also found in the Tasmanian devil. Webbing is more significant on the front feet, which in land walking are folded up in knuckle-walking to protect the webbing. The elongated snout and lower jaw are covered in soft skin, forming the bill. The nostrils are located on the snout&#x27;s dorsal surface, while the eyes and ears are just behind the snout in a groove which closes underwater. Platypuses can give a low growl when disturbed, and a range of vocalisations have been reported in captivity.

Size varies considerably in different regions, with average weight from ; males have average length , while females are the smaller at . This variation does not seem to follow any particular climatic rule and may be due to other factors such as predation and human encroachment.

The platypus has an average body temperature of about , lower than the typical of placental mammals. Research suggests this has been a gradual adaptation to harsh environmental conditions among the few marginal surviving monotreme species, rather than a general characteristic of past monotremes.

In addition to laying eggs, the anatomy, ontogeny, and genetics of monotremes shows traces of similarity to reptiles and birds. The platypus has a reptilian gait with legs on the sides of the body, rather than underneath. The platypus&#x27;s genes are a possible evolutionary link between the mammalian XY and bird/reptile ZW sex-determination systems, as one of the platypus&#x27;s five X chromosomes contains the DMRT1 gene, which birds possess on their Z chromosome.

As in all true mammals, the tiny bones that conduct sound in the middle ear are fully incorporated into the skull, rather than lying in the jaw as in pre-mammalian synapsids. However, the external opening of the ear still lies at the base of the jaw. The platypus has extra bones in the shoulder girdle, including an interclavicle not found in other mammals. As in many other aquatic and semiaquatic vertebrates, the bones show osteosclerosis, increasing their density to provide ballast.

The platypus jaw is constructed differently from that of other mammals, and the jaw-opening muscle is different. Modern platypus young have three teeth in each of the maxillae (one premolar and two molars) and dentaries (three molars), which they lose before or just after leaving the breeding burrow; adults instead develop heavily keratinised food-grinding pads called ceratodontes. The first upper and third lower cheek teeth of platypus nestlings are small, each having one principal cusp, while the other teeth have two main cusps.

=== Venom ===

While both male and female platypuses are born with back ankle spurs, only the males&#x27; deliver venom.
It is powerful enough to kill smaller animals such as dogs, and though it is not lethal to humans, it can inflict weeks of agony. Edema rapidly develops around the wound and gradually spreads through the affected limb, and it may develop into an excruciating hyperalgesia (heightened sensitivity to pain) persisting for days or even months.

The venom is composed largely of defensin-like proteins (DLPs) produced by the immune system, three of which are unique to the platypus. In other animals, defensins kill pathogenic bacteria and viruses, but in platypuses they are also collected into a venom against predators. Venom is produced in the glands of the male, which are kidney-shaped alveolar glands connected by a thin-walled duct to a calcaneus spur on each hind limb. The female platypus, in common with echidnas, has rudimentary spur buds that do not develop (dropping off before the end of their first year) and lack functional crural glands. Venom production rises among males during the breeding season, and it may be used to assert dominance.

Similar spurs are found on many archaic mammal groups, indicating that this was an ancient general characteristic among mammals.

=== Electrolocation ===
Monotremes are the only mammals (apart from the Guiana dolphin) known to have a sense of electroreception, and the platypus&#x27;s electroreception is the most sensitive of any monotreme. Feeding by neither sight nor smell, the platypus closes its eyes, ears, and nose when it dives. Digging in the bottom of streams with its bill, its electroreceptors detect tiny electric currents generated by the muscular contractions of its prey, enabling it to distinguish between animate and inanimate objects. Experiments have shown the platypus will even react to an &quot;artificial shrimp&quot; if a small electric current is passed through it.

The electroreceptors are located in rostrocaudal rows in the skin of the bill, while mechanoreceptors for touch are uniformly distributed across the bill. The electrosensory area of the cerebral cortex is in the tactile somatosensory area, and some cortical cells receive input from both electroreceptors and mechanoreceptors, suggesting the platypus feels electric fields like touches. These receptors in the bill dominate the somatotopic map of the platypus brain, in the same way human hands dominate the Penfield homunculus map.

The platypus can feel the direction of an electric source, perhaps by comparing differences in signal strength across the sheet of electroreceptors, enhanced by the characteristic side-to-side motion of the animal&#x27;s head while hunting. It may also be able to determine the distance of moving prey from the time lag between their electrical and mechanical pressure pulses.

Monotreme electrolocation for hunting in murky waters may be tied to their tooth loss. The extinct &quot;Obdurodon&quot; was electroreceptive, but unlike the modern platypus it foraged pelagically.

=== Eyes ===
In recent studies it has been suggested that the eyes of the platypus are more similar to those of Pacific hagfish or Northern Hemisphere lampreys than to those of most tetrapods. The eyes also contain double cones, unlike most mammals.

Although the platypus&#x27;s eyes are small and not used under water, several features indicate that vision was important for its ancestors. The corneal surface and the adjacent surface of the lens is flat, while the posterior surface of the lens is steeply curved, similar to the eyes of other aquatic mammals such as otters and sea-lions. A temporal (ear side) concentration of retinal ganglion cells, important for binocular vision, indicates a vestigial role in predation, though the actual visual acuity is insufficient for such activities. Limited acuity is matched by low cortical magnification, a small lateral geniculate nucleus, and a large optic tectum, suggesting that the visual midbrain plays a more important role than the visual cortex, as in some rodents. These features suggest that the platypus has adapted to an aquatic and nocturnal lifestyle, developing its electrosensory system at the cost of its visual system. This contrasts with the small number of electroreceptors in the short-beaked echidna, which dwells in dry environments, while the long-beaked echidna, which lives in moist environments, is intermediate between the other two monotremes.

=== Biofluorescence ===
In 2020, research revealed that platypus fur gives a bluish-green biofluorescent glow in black light.

==Distribution, ecology, and behaviour==

The platypus is semiaquatic, inhabiting small streams and rivers over an extensive range from the cold highlands of Tasmania and the Australian Alps to the tropical rainforests of coastal Queensland as far north as the base of the Cape York Peninsula.

Inland, its distribution is not well known. It was considered extinct on the South Australian mainland, with the last sighting recorded at Renmark in 1975. In the 1980s, John Wamsley created a platypus breeding program in Warrawong Sanctuary (see below), which subsequently closed. In 2017 there were some unconfirmed sightings downstream from the sanctuary, and in October 2020 a nesting platypus was filmed inside the recently reopened sanctuary.

There is a population on Kangaroo Island introduced in the 1920s, said to stand at 150 individuals in the Rocky River region of Flinders Chase National Park. In the 2019–20 Australian bushfire season, large portions of the island burnt, decimating wildlife. However, SA Department for Environment and Water recovery teams worked to reinstate their habitat, with a number of sightings reported by April 2020.

The platypus is no longer found in the main Murray–Darling Basin, possibly due to declining water quality from land clearing and irrigation although it is found in the Goulburn River in Victoria. Along the coastal river systems, its distribution is unpredictable: absent in some relatively healthy rivers, but present in some quite degraded ones, for example the lower Maribyrnong.

In captivity, platypuses have survived to 30 years of age, and wild specimens have been recaptured when 24 years old. Mortality rates for adults in the wild appear to be low. Natural predators include snakes, water rats, goannas, hawks, owls, and eagles. Low platypus numbers in northern Australia are possibly due to predation by crocodiles. The introduction of red foxes in 1845 for sport hunting may have had some impact on its numbers on the mainland. The platypus is generally nocturnal and crepuscular, but can be active on overcast days. Its habitat bridges rivers and the riparian zone, where it finds both prey and river banks to dig resting and nesting burrows. It may have a range of up to , with a male&#x27;s home range overlapping those of three or four females.

The platypus is an excellent swimmer and spends much of its time in the water foraging for food. It has a swimming style unique among mammals, propelling itself by alternate strokes of the front feet, while the webbed hind feet are held against the body and only used for steering, along with the tail. It can maintain its relatively low body temperature of about 32°C (90°F) while foraging for hours in water below 5°C (41°F). Dives normally last around 30 seconds, with an estimated aerobic limit of 40 seconds, with 10 to 20 seconds at the surface between dives.

The platypus rests in a short, straight burrow in the riverbank about above water level, its oval entrance-hole often hidden under a tangle of roots. It may sleep up to 14 hours per day, after half a day of diving.

=== Diet ===
The platypus is a carnivore, feeding on annelid worms, insect larvae, freshwater shrimp, and yabby (crayfish) that it digs out of the riverbed with its snout or catches while swimming. It carries prey to the surface in cheek-pouches before eating it. It eats about 20% of its own weight each day, which requires it to spend an average of 12 hours daily looking for food.

=== Reproduction ===
The species has a single breeding season between June and October, with some local variation. Investigations have found both resident and transient platypuses, and suggest a polygynous mating system. Females are believed to become sexually mature in their second year, with breeding observed in animals over nine years old. During copulation, the male grasps the female&#x27;s tail with his bill, wraps his tail around her, then grips her neck or shoulder, everts his penis through his cloaca, and inserts it into her urogenital sinus. He takes no part in nesting, living in his year-long resting burrow. After mating, the female constructs a deep, elaborate nesting burrow up to long. She tucks fallen leaves and reeds underneath her curled tail, dragging them to the burrow to soften the tunnel floor with folded wet leaves, and to line the nest at the end with bedding.

The male platypus has penile spines and an asymmetrical glans penis, with the right side smaller than the left. The female has two ovaries, but only the left one is functional. She lays one to three (usually two) small, leathery eggs (similar to those of reptiles), about in diameter and slightly rounder than bird eggs. The eggs develop &quot;in utero&quot; for about 28 days, with only about 10 days of external incubation (in contrast to a chicken egg, which spends about one day in tract and 21 days externally). The female curls around the incubating eggs, which develop in three phases. In the first, the embryo has no functional organs and relies on the yolk sac for sustenance, until the sac is absorbed. During the second phase, the digits develop, and in the last phase, the egg tooth appears. At first, European naturalists could hardly believe that the female platypus lays eggs, but this was finally confirmed by William Hay Caldwell in 1884.

Most mammal zygotes go through holoblastic cleavage, splitting into multiple divisible daughter cells. However, monotremes like the platypus, along with reptiles and birds, undergo meroblastic cleavage, in which the ovum does not split completely. The cells at the edge of the yolk remain continuous with the egg&#x27;s cytoplasm, allowing the yolk and embryo to exchange waste and nutrients with the egg through the cytoplasm.

Young platypus are called &quot;puggles&quot;. Newly hatched platypuses are vulnerable, blind, and hairless, and are fed by the mother&#x27;s milk, that provides all the requirements for growth and development. The platypus&#x27;s mammary glands lack teats, with milk released through pores in the skin. The milk pools in grooves on the mother&#x27;s abdomen, allowing the young to lap it up. After they hatch, the offspring are milk-fed for three to four months.

During incubation and weaning, the mother initially leaves the burrow only for short periods to forage. She leaves behind her a number of thin soil plugs along the length of the burrow, possibly to protect the young from predators; pushing past these on her return squeezes water from her fur and allows the burrow to remain dry. After about five weeks, the mother begins to spend more time away from her young, and at around four months, the young emerge from the burrow. A platypus is born with teeth, but these drop out at a very early age, leaving the horny plates it uses to grind food.

== Evolution ==
The platypus and other monotremes were very poorly understood, and some of the 19th century myths that grew up around themfor example, that the monotremes were &quot;inferior&quot; or quasireptilianstill endure. In 1947, William King Gregory theorised that placental mammals and marsupials may have diverged earlier, and a subsequent branching divided the monotremes and marsupials, but later research and fossil discoveries have suggested this is incorrect. In fact, modern monotremes are the survivors of an early branching of the mammal tree, and a later branching is thought to have led to the marsupial and placental groups. Molecular clock and fossil dating suggest platypuses split from echidnas around 19–48million years ago.
The oldest discovered fossil of the modern platypus dates back to about 100,000 years ago during the Quaternary period, though a limb bone of &quot;Ornithorhynchus&quot; is known from Pliocene-aged strata. The extinct monotremes &quot;Teinolophos&quot; and &quot;Steropodon&quot; from the Cretaceous were once thought to be closely related to the modern platypus, but are now considered more basal taxa. The fossilised &quot;Steropodon&quot; was discovered in New South Wales and is composed of an opalised lower jawbone with three molar teeth (whereas the adult contemporary platypus is toothless). The molar teeth were initially thought to be tribosphenic, which would have supported a variation of Gregory&#x27;s theory, but later research has suggested, while they have three cusps, they evolved under a separate process. The fossil jaw of &quot;Teinolophos&quot; is thought to be about 110million years old, making it the oldest mammal fossil found in Australia. Unlike the modern platypus (and echidnas), &quot;Teinolophos&quot; lacked a beak.

In 2024, Late Cretaceous (Cenomanian)-aged fossil specimens of actual early platypus relatives were recovered from the same rocks as &quot;Steropodon&quot;, including the basal &quot;Opalios&quot; and the more derived &quot;Dharragarra&quot;, the latter of which may be the oldest member of the platypus stem-lineage, as it retains the same dental formula found in Cenozoic platypus relatives. &quot;Monotrematum&quot; and &quot;Patagorhynchus&quot;, two other fossil relatives of the platypus, are known from the latest Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) and the mid-Paleocene of Argentina, indicating that some monotremes managed to colonize South America from Australia when the two continents were connected via Antarctica. These are also considered potential members of the platypus stem-lineage. The closest fossil relative of the platypus was &quot;Obdurodon&quot;, known from the late Oligocene to the Miocene of Australia. It closely resembled the modern platypus, aside from the presence of molar teeth. A fossilised tooth of the giant platypus &quot;Obdurodon tharalkooschild&quot; was dated 5–15million years ago. Judging by the tooth, the animal measured 1.3 metres long, making it the largest platypus on record.

The loss of teeth in the modern platypus has long been enigmatic, as a distinctive lower molar tooth row was previously present in its lineage for over 95 million years. Even its closest relative, &quot;Obdurodon&quot;, which otherwise closely resembles the platypus, retained this tooth row. More recent studies indicate that this tooth loss was a geologically very recent event, occurring only around the Plio-Pleistocene (around 2.5 million years ago), when the rakali, a large semiaquatic rodent, colonized Australia from New Guinea. The platypus, which previously fed on a wide array of hard and soft-bodied prey, was outcompeted by the rakali over hard-bodied prey such as crayfish and mussels. This competition may have selected for the loss of teeth in the platypus and their replacement by horny pads, as a way of specializing for softer-bodied prey, which the rakali did not compete with it over.

=== Genome ===
Because of the early divergence from the therian mammals and the low numbers of extant monotreme species, the platypus is a frequent subject of research in evolutionary biology. In 2004, researchers at the Australian National University discovered the platypus has ten sex chromosomes, compared with two (XY) in most other mammals. These ten chromosomes form five unique pairs of XY in males and XX in females, i.e. males are XYXYXYXYXY. One of the X chromosomes of the platypus has great homology to the bird Z chromosome. The platypus genome also has both reptilian and mammalian genes associated with egg fertilisation. Though the platypus lacks the mammalian sex-determining gene SRY, a study found that the mechanism of sex determination is the AMH gene on the oldest Y chromosome. A draft version of the platypus genome sequence was published in &quot;Nature&quot; on 8May 2008, revealing both reptilian and mammalian elements, as well as two genes found previously only in birds, amphibians, and fish. More than 80% of the platypus&#x27;s genes are common to the other mammals whose genomes have been sequenced. An updated genome, the most complete on record, was published in 2021, together with the genome of the short-beaked echidna.

== Conservation ==
=== Status and threats ===
Except for its loss from the state of South Australia, the platypus occupies the same general distribution as it did prior to European settlement of Australia. However, local changes and fragmentation of distribution due to human modification of its habitat are documented. Its historical abundance is unknown and its current abundance difficult to gauge, but it is assumed to have declined in numbers, although as of 1998 was still being considered as common over most of its current range. The species was extensively hunted for its fur until the early years of the 20th century. Although the species gained legal protections beginning in Victoria in 1890 and throughout Australia by 1912, until about 1950 it was still at risk of drowning in the nets of inland fisheries.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature recategorised its status as &quot;near threatened&quot; in 2016. The species is protected by law, but the only state in which it is listed as endangered is South Australia, under the &quot;National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972&quot;. In November 2020 a recommendation was made to list the platypus as a vulnerable species across all states with a vulnerable listing being made official in Victoria under the state&#x27;s &quot;Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988&quot; on 10 January 2021.

==== Habitat destruction ====
The platypus is not considered to be in immediate danger of extinction, because conservation measures have been successful, but it could be adversely affected by habitat disruption caused by dams, irrigation, pollution, netting, and trapping. Reduction of watercourse flows and water levels through excessive droughts and extraction of water for industrial, agricultural, and domestic supplies are also considered a threat. The IUCN lists the platypus on its Red List as &quot;Near Threatened&quot; as assessed in 2016, when it was estimated that numbers had reduced by about 30 percent on average since European settlement. The animal is listed as endangered in South Australia, but it is not covered at all under the federal &quot;EPBC Act&quot;.

Researchers have worried for years that declines have been greater than assumed. In January 2020, researchers from the University of New South Wales presented evidence that the platypus is at risk of extinction, due to a combination of extraction of water resources, land clearing, climate change and severe drought. The study predicted that, considering current threats, the animals&#x27; abundance would decline by 47–66% and metapopulation occupancy by 22–32% over 50 years, causing &quot;extinction of local populations across about 40% of the range&quot;. Under projections of climate change projections to 2070, reduced habitat due to drought would lead to 51–73% reduced abundance and 36–56% reduced metapopulation occupancy within 50 years respectively. These predictions suggested that the species would fall under the &quot;Vulnerable&quot; classification. The authors stressed the need for national conservation efforts, which might include conducting more surveys, tracking trends, reduction of threats and improvement of river management to ensure healthy platypus habitat. Co-author Gilad Bino is concerned that the estimates of the 2016 baseline numbers could be wrong, and numbers may have been reduced by as much as half already.

A November 2020 report by scientists from the University of New South Wales, funded by a research grant from the Australian Conservation Foundation in collaboration with the World Wildlife Fund Australia and the Humane Society International Australia revealed that that platypus habitat in Australia had shrunk by 22 per cent in the previous 30 years, and recommended that the platypus should be listed as a threatened species under the &quot;EPBC Act&quot;. Declines in population had been greatest in NSW, in particular in the Murray–Darling basin.

==== Disease ====
Platypuses generally suffer from few diseases in the wild; however, as of 2008 there was concern in Tasmania about the potential impacts of a disease caused by the fungus &quot;Mucor amphibiorum&quot;. The disease (termed mucormycosis) affects only Tasmanian platypuses, and had not been observed in platypuses in mainland Australia. Affected platypuses can develop skin lesions or ulcers on various parts of their bodies, including their backs, tails, and legs. Mucormycosis can kill platypuses, death arising from secondary infection and by affecting the animals&#x27; ability to maintain body temperature and forage efficiently. The Biodiversity Conservation Branch at the Department of Primary Industries and Water collaborated with NRM north and University of Tasmania researchers to determine the impacts of the disease on Tasmanian platypuses, as well as the mechanism of transmission and spread of the disease.

=== Wildlife sanctuaries ===
Much of the world was introduced to the platypus in 1939 when &quot;National Geographic Magazine&quot; published an article on the platypus and the efforts to study and raise it in captivity. The latter is a difficult task, and only a few young have been successfully raised since, notably at Healesville Sanctuary in Victoria. The leading figure in these efforts was David Fleay, who established a platypusary (a simulated stream in a tank) at the Healesville Sanctuary, where breeding was successful in 1943. In 1972, he found a dead baby of about 50 days old, which had presumably been born in captivity, at his wildlife park at Burleigh Heads on the Gold Coast, Queensland. Healesville repeated its success in 1998 and again in 2000 with a similar stream tank. Since 2008, platypus has bred regularly at Healesville, including second-generation (captive born themselves breeding in captivity). Taronga Zoo in Sydney bred twins in 2003, and breeding was again successful there in 2006.

=== Captivity ===
As of 2019, the only platypuses in captivity outside of Australia are in the San Diego Zoo Safari Park in the U.S. state of California. Three attempts were made to bring the animals to the Bronx Zoo, in 1922, 1947, and 1958. Of these, only two of the three animals introduced in 1947, Penelope and Cecil, lived longer than eighteen months.

== Human interactions ==
=== Usage ===
Aboriginal Australians used to hunt platypuses for food (their fatty tails being particularly nutritious), while, after colonisation, Europeans hunted them for fur from the late 19th century until 1912, when it was prohibited by law. In addition, European researchers captured and killed platypus or removed their eggs, partly in order to increase scientific knowledge, but also to gain prestige and outcompete rivals from different countries.

=== Cultural references ===
The platypus has been a subject in the Dreamtime stories of Aboriginal Australians, some of whom believed the animal was a hybrid of a duck and a water rat.

According to one story of the upper Darling River, the major animal groups, the land animals, water animals and birds, all competed for the platypus to join their respective groups, but the platypus ultimately decided to not join any of them, feeling that he did not need to be part of a group to be special, and wished to remain friends with all of those groups. Another Dreaming story emanate of the upper Darling tells of a young duck which ventured too far, ignoring the warnings of her tribe, and was kidnapped by a large water-rat called Biggoon. After managing to escape after some time, she returned and laid two eggs which hatched into strange furry creatures, so they were all banished and went to live in the mountains.

The platypus is also used by some Aboriginal peoples as a totem, which is to them &quot;a natural object, plant or animal that is inherited by members of a clan or family as their spiritual emblem&quot;, and the animal holds special meaning as a totem animal for the Wadi Wadi people, who live along the Murray River. Because of their cultural significance and importance in connection to country, the platypus is protected and conserved by these Indigenous peoples.

The platypus has often been used as a symbol of Australia&#x27;s cultural identity. In the 1940s, live platypuses were given to allies in the Second World War, in order to strengthen ties and boost morale.

Platypuses have been used several times as mascots: Syd the platypus was one of the three mascots chosen for the Sydney 2000 summer Olympics along with an echidna and a kookaburra, Expo Oz the platypus was the mascot for World Expo 88, which was held in Brisbane in 1988, and Hexley the platypus is the mascot for the Darwin operating system, the BSD-based core of macOS and other operating systems from Apple Inc.

Since the introduction of decimal currency to Australia in 1966, the embossed image of a platypus, designed and sculpted by Stuart Devlin, has appeared on the reverse (tails) side of the 20-cent coin. The platypus has frequently appeared in Australian postage stamps, most recently the 2015 &quot;Native Animals&quot; series and the 2016 &quot;Australian Animals Monotremes&quot; series.

In the American animated series &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot;, the title characters own a pet bluish-green platypus named Perry who, unknown to them, is a secret agent. Such choices were inspired by media underuse, as well as to exploit the animal&#x27;s striking appearance; additionally, show creator Dan Povenmire, who also wrote the character&#x27;s theme song, said that its opening lyrics are based on the introductory sentence of the Platypus article on Wikipedia, copying the &quot;semiaquatic egg-laying mammal&quot; phrase word for word and appending the phrase &quot;of action&quot;; however, the article did not include &quot;egg-laying mammal&quot; in the lead sentence until 2014, several years after the song released. As a character, Perry has been well received by both fans and critics. Coincidentally, real platypuses show a similar cyan colour when seen under ultraviolet lighting.

<doc id="23750" wikidata="Q188479" url="?curid=23750" title="Paramagnetism">
<text>Paramagnetism is a form of magnetism whereby some materials are weakly attracted by an externally applied magnetic field, and form internal, induced magnetic fields in the direction of the applied magnetic field. In contrast with this behavior, diamagnetic materials are repelled by magnetic fields and form induced magnetic fields in the direction opposite to that of the applied magnetic field. Paramagnetic materials include most chemical elements and some compounds; they have a relative magnetic permeability slightly greater than 1 (i.e., a small positive magnetic susceptibility) and hence are attracted to magnetic fields. The magnetic moment induced by the applied field is linear in the field strength and rather weak. It typically requires a sensitive analytical balance to detect the effect and modern measurements on paramagnetic materials are often conducted with a SQUID magnetometer.

Paramagnetism is due to the presence of unpaired electrons in the material, so most atoms with incompletely filled atomic orbitals are paramagnetic, although exceptions such as copper exist. Due to their spin, unpaired electrons have a magnetic dipole moment and act like tiny magnets. An external magnetic field causes the electrons&#x27; spins to align parallel to the field, causing a net attraction. Paramagnetic materials include aluminium, oxygen, titanium, and iron oxide (FeO). Therefore, a simple rule of thumb is used in chemistry to determine whether a particle (atom, ion, or molecule) is paramagnetic or diamagnetic: if all electrons in the particle are paired, then the substance made of this particle is diamagnetic; if it has unpaired electrons, then the substance is paramagnetic.

Unlike ferromagnets, paramagnets do not retain any magnetization in the absence of an externally applied magnetic field because thermal motion randomizes the spin orientations. (Some paramagnetic materials retain spin disorder even at absolute zero, meaning they are paramagnetic in the ground state, i.e. in the absence of thermal motion.) Thus the total magnetization drops to zero when the applied field is removed. Even in the presence of the field there is only a small induced magnetization because only a small fraction of the spins will be oriented by the field. This fraction is proportional to the field strength and this explains the linear dependency. The attraction experienced by ferromagnetic materials is non-linear and much stronger, so that it is easily observed, for instance, in the attraction between a refrigerator magnet and the iron of the refrigerator itself.

==Relation to electron spins==

Constituent atoms or molecules of paramagnetic materials have permanent magnetic moments (dipoles), even in the absence of an applied field. The permanent moment generally is due to the spin of unpaired electrons in atomic or molecular electron orbitals (see Magnetic moment). In pure paramagnetism, the dipoles do not interact with one another and are randomly oriented in the absence of an external field due to thermal agitation, resulting in zero net magnetic moment. When a magnetic field is applied, the dipoles will tend to align with the applied field, resulting in a net magnetic moment in the direction of the applied field. In the classical description, this alignment can be understood to occur due to a torque being provided on the magnetic moments by an applied field, which tries to align the dipoles parallel to the applied field. However, the true origins of the alignment can only be understood via the quantum-mechanical properties of spin and angular momentum.

If there is sufficient energy exchange between neighbouring dipoles, they will interact, and may spontaneously align or anti-align and form magnetic domains, resulting in ferromagnetism (permanent magnets) or antiferromagnetism, respectively. Paramagnetic behavior can also be observed in ferromagnetic materials that are above their Curie temperature, and in antiferromagnets above their Néel temperature. At these temperatures, the available thermal energy simply overcomes the interaction energy between the spins.

In general, paramagnetic effects are quite small: the magnetic susceptibility is of the order of 10−3 to 10−5 for most paramagnets, but may be as high as 10−1 for synthetic paramagnets such as ferrofluids.

===Delocalization===
In conductive materials, the electrons are delocalized, that is, they travel through the solid more or less as free electrons. Conductivity can be understood in a band structure picture as arising from the incomplete filling of energy bands.
In an ordinary nonmagnetic conductor the conduction band is identical for both spin-up and spin-down electrons. When a magnetic field is applied, the conduction band splits apart into a spin-up and a spin-down band due to the difference in magnetic potential energy for spin-up and spin-down electrons.
Since the Fermi level must be identical for both bands, this means that there will be a small surplus of the type of spin in the band that moved downwards. This effect is a weak form of paramagnetism known as &quot;Pauli paramagnetism&quot;.

The effect always competes with a diamagnetic response of opposite sign due to all the core electrons of the atoms. Stronger forms of magnetism usually require localized rather than itinerant electrons. However, in some cases a band structure can result in which there are two delocalized sub-bands with states of opposite spins that have different energies. If one subband is preferentially filled over the other, one can have itinerant ferromagnetic order. This situation usually only occurs in relatively narrow (d-)bands, which are poorly delocalized.

====s and p electrons====
Generally, strong delocalization in a solid due to large overlap with neighboring wave functions means that there will be a large Fermi velocity; this means that the number of electrons in a band is less sensitive to shifts in that band&#x27;s energy, implying a weak magnetism. This is why s- and p-type metals are typically either Pauli-paramagnetic or as in the case of gold even diamagnetic. In the latter case the diamagnetic contribution from the closed shell inner electrons simply wins over the weak paramagnetic term of the almost free electrons.

====d and f electrons====
Stronger magnetic effects are typically only observed when d or f electrons are involved. Particularly the latter are usually strongly localized. Moreover, the size of the magnetic moment on a lanthanide atom can be quite large as it can carry up to 7 unpaired electrons in the case of gadolinium(III) (hence its use in MRI). The high magnetic moments associated with lanthanides is one reason why superstrong magnets are typically based on elements like neodymium or samarium.

====Molecular localization====
The above picture is a &quot;generalization&quot; as it pertains to materials with an extended lattice rather than a molecular structure. Molecular structure can also lead to localization of electrons. Although there are usually energetic reasons why a molecular structure results such that it does not exhibit partly filled orbitals (i.e. unpaired spins), some non-closed shell moieties do occur in nature. Molecular oxygen is a good example. Even in the frozen solid it contains di-radical molecules resulting in paramagnetic behavior. The unpaired spins reside in orbitals derived from oxygen p wave functions, but the overlap is limited to the one neighbor in the O2 molecules. The distances to other oxygen atoms in the lattice remain too large to lead to delocalization and the magnetic moments remain unpaired.

==Theory==
The Bohr–Van Leeuwen theorem proves that there cannot be any diamagnetism or paramagnetism in a purely classical system. The paramagnetic response has then two possible quantum origins, either coming from permanent magnetic moments of the ions or from the spatial motion of the conduction electrons inside the material. Both descriptions are given below.

===Curie&#x27;s law ===

For low levels of magnetization, the magnetization of paramagnets follows what is known as Curie&#x27;s law, at least approximately. This law indicates that the susceptibility, formula_1, of paramagnetic materials is inversely proportional to their temperature, i.e. that materials become more magnetic at lower temperatures. The mathematical expression is:
formula_2
where:
*formula_3 is the resulting magnetization, measured in amperes/meter (A/m),
*formula_4 is the volume magnetic susceptibility (dimensionless),
*formula_5 is the auxiliary magnetic field (A/m),
*formula_6 is absolute temperature, measured in kelvins (K),
*formula_7 is a material-specific Curie constant (K).

Curie&#x27;s law is valid under the commonly encountered conditions of low magnetization (&quot;μ&quot;B&quot;H&quot; ≲ &quot;k&quot;B&quot;T&quot;), but does not apply in the high-field/low-temperature regime where saturation of magnetization occurs (&quot;μ&quot;B&quot;H&quot; ≳ &quot;k&quot;B&quot;T&quot;) and magnetic dipoles are all aligned with the applied field. When the dipoles are aligned, increasing the external field will not increase the total magnetization since there can be no further alignment.

For a paramagnetic ion with noninteracting magnetic moments with angular momentum &quot;J&quot;, the Curie constant is related to the individual ions&#x27; magnetic moments,
formula_8

where &quot;n&quot; is the number of atoms per unit volume. The parameter &quot;μ&quot;eff is interpreted as the effective magnetic moment per paramagnetic ion. If one uses a classical treatment with molecular magnetic moments represented as discrete magnetic dipoles, &quot;μ&quot;, a Curie Law expression of the same form will emerge with &quot;μ&quot; appearing in place of &quot;μ&quot;eff.

e^}/{k_{\mathrm{B}}T}\;}}}{\sum\limits_{M_{J} = -J}^{J}{e^}/{k_{\mathrm{B}}T}\;}}} = \frac{n\sum\limits_{M_{J} = -J}^{J}{M_{J}g_{J}\mu_{\mathrm{B}}e^H}/{k_{\mathrm{B}}T}\;}}}{\sum\limits_{M_{J} = -J}^{J}{e^H}/{k_{\mathrm{B}}T}\;}}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Where formula_9 is the &quot;z&quot;-component of the magnetic moment for each Zeeman level, so formula_10 is called the Bohr magneton and &quot;g&quot;&quot;J&quot; is the Landé g-factor, which reduces to the free-electron g-factor, &quot;g&quot;&quot;S&quot; when &quot;J&quot; = &quot;S&quot;. (in this treatment, we assume that the &quot;x&quot;- and &quot;y&quot;-components of the magnetization, averaged over all molecules, cancel out because the field applied along the &quot;z&quot;-axis leave them randomly oriented.) The energy of each Zeeman level is formula_11. For temperatures over a few &quot;K&quot;, formula_12, and we can apply the approximation formula_13:
formula_14
which yields:
formula_15
The bulk magnetization is then formula_16 and the susceptibility is given by
formula_17

When orbital angular momentum contributions to the magnetic moment are small, as occurs for most organic radicals or for octahedral transition metal complexes with d3 or high-spin d5 configurations, the effective magnetic moment takes the form ( with g-factor &quot;g&quot;e = 2.0023... ≈ 2),
formula_18
where &quot;N&quot;u is the number of unpaired electrons. In other transition metal complexes this yields a useful, if somewhat cruder, estimate.

When Curie constant is null, second order effects that couple the ground state with the excited states can also lead to a paramagnetic susceptibility independent of the temperature, known as Van Vleck susceptibility.

=== Pauli paramagnetism===
For some alkali metals and noble metals, conduction electrons are weakly interacting and delocalized in space forming a Fermi gas. For these materials one contribution to the magnetic response comes from the interaction between the electron spins and the magnetic field known as Pauli paramagnetism. For a small magnetic field formula_19, the additional energy per electron from the interaction between an electron spin and the magnetic field is given by:

:formula_20

where formula_21 is the vacuum permeability, formula_22 is the electron magnetic moment, formula_23 is the Bohr magneton, formula_24 is the reduced Planck constant, and the g-factor cancels with the spin formula_25. The formula_26 indicates that the sign is positive (negative) when the electron spin component in the direction of formula_19 is parallel (antiparallel) to the magnetic field.
For low temperatures with respect to the Fermi temperature formula_28 (around 104 kelvins for metals), the number density of electrons formula_29 (formula_30) pointing parallel (antiparallel) to the magnetic field can be written as:

:formula_31

with formula_32 the total free-electrons density and formula_33 the electronic density of states (number of states per energy per volume) at the Fermi energy formula_34.

In this approximation the magnetization is given as the magnetic moment of one electron times the difference in densities:

:formula_35

which yields a positive paramagnetic susceptibility independent of temperature:

:formula_36

The Pauli paramagnetic susceptibility is a macroscopic effect and has to be contrasted with Landau diamagnetic susceptibility which is equal to minus one third of Pauli&#x27;s and also comes from delocalized electrons. The Pauli susceptibility comes from the spin interaction with the magnetic field while the Landau susceptibility comes from the spatial motion of the electrons and it is independent of the spin. In doped semiconductors the ratio between Landau&#x27;s and Pauli&#x27;s susceptibilities changes as the effective mass of the charge carriers formula_37 can differ from the electron mass formula_38.

The magnetic response calculated for a gas of electrons is not the full picture as the magnetic susceptibility coming from the ions has to be included. Additionally, these formulas may break down for confined systems that differ from the bulk, like quantum dots, or for high fields, as demonstrated in the De Haas-Van Alphen effect.

Pauli paramagnetism is named after the physicist Wolfgang Pauli. Before Pauli&#x27;s theory, the lack of a strong Curie paramagnetism in metals was an open problem as the leading Drude model could not account for this contribution without the use of quantum statistics.
Pauli paramagnetism and Landau diamagnetism are essentially applications of the spin and the free electron model, the first is due to intrinsic spin of electrons; the second is due to their orbital motion.

==Examples of paramagnets==
Materials that are called &quot;paramagnets&quot; are most often those that exhibit, at least over an appreciable temperature range, magnetic susceptibilities that adhere to the Curie or Curie–Weiss laws. In principle any system that contains atoms, ions, or molecules with unpaired spins can be called a paramagnet, but the interactions between them need to be carefully considered.

===Systems with minimal interactions===
The narrowest definition would be: a system with unpaired spins that &quot;do not interact&quot; with each other. In this narrowest sense, the only pure paramagnet is a dilute gas of monatomic hydrogen atoms. Each atom has one non-interacting unpaired electron.

A gas of lithium atoms already possess two paired core electrons that produce a diamagnetic response of opposite sign. Strictly speaking Li is a mixed system therefore, although admittedly the diamagnetic component is weak and often neglected. In the case of heavier elements the diamagnetic contribution becomes more important and in the case of metallic gold it dominates the properties. The element hydrogen is virtually never called &#x27;paramagnetic&#x27; because the monatomic gas is stable only at extremely high temperature; H atoms combine to form molecular H2 and in so doing, the magnetic moments are lost (&quot;quenched&quot;), because of the spins pair. Hydrogen is therefore &quot;diamagnetic&quot; and the same holds true for many other elements. Although the electronic configuration of the individual atoms (and ions) of most elements contain unpaired spins, they are not necessarily paramagnetic, because at ambient temperature quenching is very much the rule rather than the exception. The quenching tendency is weakest for f-electrons because &quot;f&quot; (especially 4&quot;f&quot;) orbitals are radially contracted and they overlap only weakly with orbitals on adjacent atoms. Consequently, the lanthanide elements with incompletely filled 4f-orbitals are paramagnetic or magnetically ordered.
Thus, condensed phase paramagnets are only possible if the interactions of the spins that lead either to quenching or to ordering are kept at bay by structural isolation of the magnetic centers. There are two classes of materials for which this holds:
*Molecular materials with a (isolated) paramagnetic center.
** Good examples are coordination complexes of d- or f-metals or proteins with such centers, e.g. myoglobin. In such materials the organic part of the molecule acts as an envelope shielding the spins from their neighbors.
** Small molecules can be stable in radical form, oxygen O2 is a good example. Such systems are quite rare because they tend to be rather reactive.
* Dilute systems.
** Dissolving a paramagnetic species in a diamagnetic lattice at small concentrations, e.g. Nd3+ in CaCl2 will separate the neodymium ions at large enough distances that they do not interact. Such systems are of prime importance for what can be considered the most sensitive method to study paramagnetic systems: EPR.

===Systems with interactions===
As stated above, many materials that contain d- or f-elements do retain unquenched spins. Salts of such elements often show paramagnetic behavior but at low enough temperatures the magnetic moments may order. It is not uncommon to call such materials &#x27;paramagnets&#x27;, when referring to their paramagnetic behavior above their Curie or Néel-points, particularly if such temperatures are very low or have never been properly measured. Even for iron it is not uncommon to say that &quot;iron becomes a paramagnet&quot; above its relatively high Curie-point. In that case the Curie-point is seen as a phase transition between a ferromagnet and a &#x27;paramagnet&#x27;. The word paramagnet now merely refers to the linear response of the system to an applied field, the temperature dependence of which requires an amended version of Curie&#x27;s law, known as the Curie–Weiss law:

:formula_39

This amended law includes a term θ that describes the exchange interaction that is present albeit overcome by thermal motion. The sign of θ depends on whether ferro- or antiferromagnetic interactions dominate and it is seldom exactly zero, except in the dilute, isolated cases mentioned above.

Obviously, the paramagnetic Curie–Weiss description above &quot;T&quot;N or &quot;T&quot;C is a rather different interpretation of the word &quot;paramagnet&quot; as it does &quot;not&quot; imply the &quot;absence&quot; of interactions, but rather that the magnetic structure is random in the absence of an external field at these sufficiently high temperatures. Even if &quot;θ&quot; is close to zero this does not mean that there are no interactions, just that the aligning ferro- and the anti-aligning antiferromagnetic ones cancel. An additional complication is that the interactions are often different in different directions of the crystalline lattice (anisotropy), leading to complicated magnetic structures once ordered.

Randomness of the structure also applies to the many metals that show a net paramagnetic response over a broad temperature range. They do not follow a Curie type law as function of temperature however; often they are more or less temperature independent. This type of behavior is of an itinerant nature and better called Pauli-paramagnetism, but it is not unusual to see, for example, the metal aluminium called a &quot;paramagnet&quot;, even though interactions are strong enough to give this element very good electrical conductivity.

===Superparamagnets===
Some materials show induced magnetic behavior that follows a Curie type law but with exceptionally large values for the Curie constants. These materials are known as superparamagnets. They are characterized by a strong ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic type of coupling into domains of a limited size that behave independently from one another. The bulk properties of such a system resembles that of a paramagnet, but on a microscopic level they are ordered. The materials do show an ordering temperature above which the behavior reverts to ordinary paramagnetism (with interaction). Ferrofluids are a good example, but the phenomenon can also occur inside solids, e.g., when dilute paramagnetic centers are introduced in a strong itinerant medium of ferromagnetic coupling such as when Fe is substituted in TlCu2Se2 or the alloy AuFe. Such systems contain ferromagnetically coupled clusters that freeze out at lower temperatures. They are also called mictomagnets.

<text>Parapsychology is the study of alleged psychic phenomena (extrasensory perception, telepathy, precognition, clairvoyance, psychokinesis (also called telekinesis), and psychometry) and other paranormal claims, for example, those related to near-death experiences, synchronicity, apparitional experiences, etc. Criticized as being a pseudoscience, the majority of mainstream scientists reject it. Parapsychology has also been criticized by mainstream critics for claims by many of its practitioners that their studies are plausible despite a lack of convincing evidence after more than a century of research for the existence of any psychic phenomena.

Parapsychology research rarely appears in mainstream scientific journals; a few niche journals publish most papers about parapsychology.

==Terminology==
The term &quot;parapsychology&quot; was coined in 1889 by philosopher Max Dessoir as the German . It was adopted by J. B. Rhine in the 1930s as a replacement for the term &quot;psychical research&quot; to indicate a significant shift toward experimental methodology and academic discipline. The term originates from the meaning &quot;alongside&quot;, and psychology.

In parapsychology, psi is the unknown factor in extrasensory perception and psychokinesis experiences that is not explained by known physical or biological mechanisms. The term is derived from ψ &quot;psi,&quot; the 23rd letter of the Greek alphabet and the initial letter of the , &quot;mind, soul&quot;. The term was coined by biologist Bertold Wiesner, and first used by psychologist Robert Thouless in a 1942 article published in the &quot;British Journal of Psychology&quot;.

The Parapsychological Association divides psi into two main categories: psi-gamma for extrasensory perception and psi-kappa for psychokinesis. In popular culture, &quot;psi&quot; has become more and more synonymous with extraordinary psychic, mental, and &quot;psionic&quot; abilities and powers.

==History==
===Early psychical research===

In 1853, chemist Robert Hare conducted experiments with mediums and reported positive results. Other researchers such as Frank Podmore highlighted flaws in his experiments, such as lack of controls to prevent trickery. Agenor de Gasparin conducted early experiments into table-tipping. For five months in 1853, he declared the experiments a success, being the result of an &quot;ectenic force&quot;. Critics noted that the conditions were insufficient to prevent trickery. For example, the sitters may have moved the table with their knees, and no experimenter was simultaneously watching above and below the table.

The German astrophysicist Johann Karl Friedrich Zöllner tested the medium Henry Slade in 1877. According to Zöllner, some of the experiments were successful. However, flaws in the experiments were discovered, and critics have suggested that Slade was a fraud who performed trickery in the experiments.

The Society for Psychical Research (SPR) was founded in London in 1882. Its formation was the first systematic effort to organize scientists and scholars to investigate paranormal phenomena. Early membership included philosophers, scholars, scientists, educators and politicians, such as Henry Sidgwick, Arthur Balfour, William Crookes, Rufus Osgood Mason, and Nobel Laureate Charles Richet. Presidents of the Society included, in addition to Richet, Eleanor Sidgwick and William James, and subsequently Nobel Laureates Henri Bergson and Lord Rayleigh, and philosopher C. D. Broad.

Areas of study included telepathy, hypnotism, Reichenbach&#x27;s phenomena, apparitions, hauntings, and the physical aspects of Spiritualism such as table-tilting, materialization, and apportation. In the 1880s, the Society investigated apparitional experiences and hallucinations in the sane. Among the first important works was the two-volume publication in 1886, &quot;Phantasms of the Living&quot;, which was largely criticized by scholars. In 1894, the &quot;Census of Hallucinations&quot; was published which sampled 17,000 people. Out of these, 1,684 persons admitted to having experienced a hallucination of an apparition. The SPR became the model for similar societies in other European countries and the United States during the late 19th century.

Early clairvoyance experiments were reported in 1884 by Charles Richet. Playing cards were enclosed in envelopes, and a subject was put under hypnosis to identify them. The subject was reported to have succeeded in a series of 133 trials, but the results dropped to the chance level when performed before a group of scientists in Cambridge. J. M. Peirce and E. C. Pickering reported a similar experiment in which they tested 36 subjects over 23,384 trials, which did not obtain above-chance scores.

In 1881, Eleanor Sidgwick revealed the fraudulent methods that spirit photographers such as Édouard Isidore Buguet, Frederic Hudson, and William H. Mumler had utilized. During the late nineteenth century, many fraudulent mediums were exposed by SPR investigators.

Largely due to the support of psychologist William James, the American Society for Psychical Research (ASPR) opened its doors in Boston in 1885, moving to New York City in 1905 under the leadership of James H. Hyslop. Notable cases investigated by Walter Franklin Prince of the ASPR in the early 20th century included Pierre L. O. A. Keeler, the Great Amherst Mystery and Patience Worth.

===Rhine era===

In 1911, Stanford University became the first academic institution in the United States to study extrasensory perception (ESP) and psychokinesis (PK) in a laboratory setting. The effort was headed by psychologist John Edgar Coover and funded by Thomas Welton Stanford, brother of the university&#x27;s founder. After conducting approximately 10,000 experiments, Coover concluded that &quot;statistical treatments of the data fail to reveal any cause beyond chance.&quot;

In 1930, Duke University became the second major U.S. academic institution to engage in the critical study of ESP and psychokinesis in the laboratory. Under the guidance of psychologist William McDougall, and with the help of others in the department—including psychologists Karl Zener, Joseph B. Rhine, and Louisa E. Rhine—laboratory ESP experiments using volunteer subjects from the undergraduate student body began. As opposed to the approaches of psychical research, which generally sought qualitative evidence for paranormal phenomena, the experiments at Duke University proffered a quantitative, statistical approach using cards and dice. As a consequence of the ESP experiments at Duke, standard laboratory procedures for the testing of ESP were developed and adopted by interested researchers worldwide.

George Estabrooks conducted an ESP experiment using cards in 1927. Harvard students were used as the subjects. Estabrooks acted as the sender, with the guesser in an adjoining room. Estabrooks conducted a total of 2,300 trials. When Estabrooks sent the subjects to a distant room with insulation, the scores dropped to chance level. Attempts to repeat the experiment also failed.

The publication of J. B. Rhine&#x27;s book, &quot;New Frontiers of the Mind&quot; (1937), brought the laboratory&#x27;s findings to the general public. In his book, Rhine popularized the word &quot;parapsychology&quot;, coined by psychologist Max Dessoir over 40 years earlier, to describe the research conducted at Duke. Rhine also founded an autonomous Parapsychology Laboratory within Duke and started the &quot;Journal of Parapsychology&quot;, which he co-edited with McDougall.

Rhine, along with associate Karl Zener, had developed a statistical system of testing for ESP that involved subjects guessing what symbol, out of five possible symbols, would appear when going through a special deck of cards designed for this purpose. A percentage of correct guesses (or hits) significantly above 20% was perceived as higher than chance and indicative of psychic ability. Rhine stated in his first book, &quot;Extrasensory Perception&quot; (1934), that after 90,000 trials, he felt ESP is &quot;an actual and demonstrable occurrence&quot;.

Irish medium and parapsychologist Eileen J. Garrett was tested by Rhine at Duke University in 1933 with Zener cards. Rhine placed certain symbols on the cards, sealed them in an envelope, and asked Garrett to guess their contents. She performed poorly and later criticized the tests by claiming the cards lacked a psychic energy called &quot;energy stimulus&quot; and that she could not perform clairvoyance to order. The parapsychologist Samuel Soal and his colleagues tested Garrett in May 1937. Soal conducted most experiments in the Psychological Laboratory at University College London. Soal recorded over 12,000 guesses, but Garrett failed to produce above chance level. In his report Soal wrote &quot;In the case of Mrs. Eileen Garrett we fail to find the slightest confirmation of J. B. Rhine&#x27;s remarkable claims relating to her alleged powers of extra-sensory perception. Not only did she fail when I took charge of the experiments, but she failed equally when four other carefully trained experimenters took my place.&quot;

The parapsychology experiments at Duke evoked much criticism from academics and others who challenged the concepts and evidence of ESP. Many psychological departments attempted to repeat Rhine&#x27;s experiments with failure. W. S. Cox (1936) from Princeton University, with 132 subjects, produced 25,064 trials in a playing card ESP experiment. Cox concluded, &quot;There is no evidence of extrasensory perception either in the &#x27;average man&#x27; or of the group investigated or in any particular individual of that group. The discrepancy between these results and those obtained by Rhine is due either to uncontrollable factors in experimental procedure or to the difference in the subjects.&quot; Four other psychological departments failed to replicate Rhine&#x27;s results. After thousands of card runs, James Charles Crumbaugh failed to duplicate the results of Rhine.
In 1938, the psychologist Joseph Jastrow wrote that much of the evidence for extrasensory perception collected by Rhine and other parapsychologists was anecdotal, biased, dubious and the result of &quot;faulty observation and familiar human frailties&quot;. Rhine&#x27;s experiments were discredited due to the discovery that sensory leakage or cheating could account for all his results, such as the subject being able to read the symbols from the back of the cards and being able to see and hear the experimenter to note subtle clues.

Illusionist Milbourne Christopher wrote years later that he felt &quot;there are at least a dozen ways a subject who wished to cheat under the conditions Rhine described could deceive the investigator&quot;. When Rhine took precautions in response to criticisms of his methods, he failed to find any high-scoring subjects. Another criticism, made by chemist Irving Langmuir, among others, was one of selective reporting. Langmuir stated that Rhine did not report scores of subjects that he suspected were intentionally guessing wrong and that this, he felt, biased the statistical results higher than they should have been.

Rhine and his colleagues attempted to address these criticisms through new experiments described in the book &quot;Extrasensory Perception After Sixty Years&quot; (1940). Rhine described three experiments: the Pearce-Pratt experiment, the Pratt-Woodruff experiment, and the Ownbey-Zirkle series, which he believed demonstrated ESP. However, C. E. M. Hansel wrote, &quot;It is now known that each experiment contained serious flaws that escaped notice in the examination made by the authors of &quot;Extra-Sensory Perception After Sixty Years&quot;&quot;. Joseph Gaither Pratt was the co-experimenter in the Pearce-Pratt and Pratt-Woodruff experiments at the Duke campus. Hansel visited the campus where the experiments took place and discovered the results could have originated through a trick, so they could not supply evidence for ESP.

In 1957, Rhine and Joseph Gaither Pratt wrote &quot;&quot;. Because of the methodological problems, parapsychologists no longer utilize card-guessing studies. Rhine&#x27;s experiments into psychokinesis (PK) were also criticized. John Sladek wrote:

His research used dice, with subjects &#x27;willing&#x27; them to fall a certain way. Not only can dice be drilled, shaved, falsely numbered and manipulated, but even straight dice often show bias in the long run. Casinos for this reason retire dice often, but at Duke, subjects continued to try for the same effect on the same dice over long experimental runs. Not surprisingly, PK appeared at Duke and nowhere else.
Parapsychologists and skeptics criticized the Ownbey-Zirkle ESP experiment at Duke. Ownbey would attempt to send ESP symbols to Zirkle, who would guess what they were. The pair were placed in adjacent rooms, unable to see each other, and an electric fan was used to prevent the pair from communicating by sensory cues. Ownbey tapped a telegraph key to Zirkle to inform him when she was trying to send him a symbol. The door separating the two rooms was open during the experiment, and after each guess, Zirkle would call out his guess to Ownbey, who recorded his choice. Critics pointed out the experiment was flawed as Ownbey acted as both the sender and the experimenter; nobody controlled the experiment, so Ownbey could have cheated by communicating with Zirkle or made recording mistakes.

The Turner-Ownbey long-distance telepathy experiment was also flawed. May Frances Turner positioned herself in the Duke Parapsychology Laboratory, while Sara Ownbey claimed to receive transmissions 250 miles away. For the experiment, Turner would think of a symbol and write it down, while Ownbey would write her guesses. The scores were highly successful and both records were supposed to be sent to J. B. Rhine, however, Ownbey sent them to Turner. Critics pointed out this invalidated the results as she could have simply written her own record to agree with the other. When the experiment was repeated and the records were sent to Rhine, the scores dropped to average.

Lucien Warner and Mildred Raible performed a famous ESP experiment at Duke University. Warner and Raible locked a subject in a room with a switch controlling a signal light elsewhere, which she could signal to guess the card. Ten runs with ESP packs of cards were used, and she achieved 93 hits (43 more than chance). Weaknesses with the experiment were later discovered. The duration of the light signal could be varied so that the subject could call for specific symbols. Certain symbols in the experiment appeared far more often than others, indicating poor shuffling or card manipulation. The experiment was not repeated.

Duke&#x27;s administration grew less sympathetic to parapsychology, and after Rhine&#x27;s retirement in 1965, parapsychological links with the university were broken. Rhine later established the Foundation for Research on the Nature of Man (FRNM) and the Institute for Parapsychology as a successor to the Duke laboratory. In 1995, the centenary of Rhine&#x27;s birth, the FRNM was renamed the Rhine Research Center. Today, the Rhine Research Center is a parapsychology research unit, stating that it &quot;aims to improve the human condition by creating a scientific understanding of those abilities and sensitivities that appear to transcend the ordinary limits of space and time&quot;.

===Establishment of the Parapsychological Association===
The Parapsychological Association (PA) was created in Durham, North Carolina, on June 19, 1957. J. B. Rhine proposed its formation at a parapsychology workshop held at the Parapsychology Laboratory of Duke University. Rhine proposed that the group form itself into the nucleus of an international professional society in parapsychology. The aim of the organization, as stated in its Constitution, became &quot;to advance parapsychology as a science, to disseminate knowledge of the field, and to integrate the findings with those of other branches of science&quot;.

In 1969, under the direction of anthropologist Margaret Mead, the Parapsychological Association became affiliated with the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), the largest general scientific society in the world. In 1979, physicist John A. Wheeler said that parapsychology is pseudoscientific and that the affiliation of the PA to the AAAS needed to be reconsidered.

His challenge to parapsychology&#x27;s AAAS affiliation was unsuccessful. Today, the PA consists of about three hundred full, associate, and affiliated members worldwide.

===Stargate Project===
Beginning in the early 1950s, the CIA started extensive research into behavioral engineering. The findings from these experiments led to the formation of the Stargate Project, which handled ESP research for the U.S. federal government.

The Stargate Project was terminated in 1995 with the conclusion that it was never useful in any intelligence operation. The information was vague and included a lot of irrelevant and erroneous data. There was also reason to suspect that the research managers had adjusted their project reports to fit the known background cues.

===1970s and 1980s===

The affiliation of the Parapsychological Association (PA) with the American Association for the Advancement of Science, along with a general openness to psychic and occult phenomena in the 1970s, led to a decade of increased parapsychological research. During this period, other related organizations were also formed, including the Academy of Parapsychology and Medicine (1970), the Institute of Parascience (1971), the Academy of Religion and Psychical Research, the Institute of Noetic Sciences (1973), the International Kirlian Research Association (1975), and the Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Laboratory (1979). Parapsychological work was also conducted at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) during this time.

The scope of parapsychology expanded during these years. Psychiatrist Ian Stevenson conducted much of his research into reincarnation during the 1970s, and the second edition of his &quot;Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation&quot; was published in 1974. Psychologist Thelma Moss studied Kirlian photography at UCLA&#x27;s parapsychology laboratory. The influx of spiritual teachers from Asia and their claims of abilities produced by meditation led to research on altered states of consciousness. American Society for Psychical Research Director of Research, Karlis Osis, conducted experiments in out of body experiences. Physicist Russell Targ coined the term remote viewing for use in some of his work at SRI in 1974.

The surge in paranormal research continued into the 1980s: the Parapsychological Association reported members working in more than 30 countries. For example, research was carried out and regular conferences held in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union although the word parapsychology was discarded in favor of the term psychotronics. The main promoter of psychotronics was Czech scientist Zdeněk Rejdák, who described it as a physical science, organizing conferences and presiding over the International Association for Psychotronic Research.

In 1985, the Department of Psychology at the University of Edinburgh established a Chair of Parapsychology, awarding it to Robert Morris, an experimental parapsychologist from the United States. Morris and his research associates and PhD students pursued research on topics related to parapsychology.

===Modern era===
Since the 1980s, contemporary parapsychological research has waned considerably in the United States. Early research was considered inconclusive, and parapsychologists faced strong skepticism from their academic colleagues. Some effects thought to be paranormal, for example, the effects of Kirlian photography (thought by some to represent a human aura), disappeared under more stringent controls, leaving those avenues of research at dead-ends. Most parapsychology research in the US is now confined to private institutions funded by private sources. After 28 years of research, Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Laboratory (PEAR), which studied psychokinesis, closed in 2007.

Two universities in the United States have academic parapsychology laboratories. The Division of Perceptual Studies, a unit at the University of Virginia&#x27;s Department of Psychiatric Medicine, studies the possibility of survival of consciousness after bodily death, near-death experiences, and out-of-body experiences. Gary Schwartz at the University of Arizona&#x27;s &quot;Veritas Laboratory&quot; conducted laboratory investigations of mediums, criticized by scientific skeptics. Several private institutions, including the Institute of Noetic Sciences, conduct and promote parapsychological research.

Over the last two decades, some new sources of funding for parapsychology in Europe have seen a &quot;substantial increase in European parapsychological research so that the center of gravity for the field has swung from the United States to Europe&quot;. The United Kingdom has the largest number of active parapsychologists of all nations. In the UK, researchers work in conventional psychology departments and do studies in mainstream psychology to &quot;boost their credibility and show that their methods are sound&quot;. It is thought that this approach could account for the relative strength of parapsychology in Britain.

As of 2007, parapsychology was researched in some 30 countries, and some universities worldwide continue academic parapsychology programs. Among these are the Koestler Parapsychology Unit at the University of Edinburgh; the Parapsychology Research Group at Liverpool Hope University (this closed in April 2011); the SOPHIA Project at the University of Arizona; the Consciousness and Transpersonal Psychology Research Unit of Liverpool John Moores University; the Center for the Study of Anomalous Psychological Processes at the University of Northampton; and the Anomalistic Psychology Research Unit at Goldsmiths, University of London.

Research and professional organizations include the Parapsychological Association; the Society for Psychical Research, publisher of the &quot;Journal of the Society for Psychical Research&quot; and &quot;Psi Encyclopedia&quot;; the American Society for Psychical Research, publisher of the &quot;Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research&quot; (last published in 2004); the Rhine Research Center and Institute for Parapsychology, publisher of the &quot;Journal of Parapsychology&quot;; the Parapsychology Foundation, which published the &quot;International Journal of Parapsychology&quot; (between 1959 and 1968 and 2000–2001) and the Australian Institute of Parapsychological Research, publisher of the &quot;Australian Journal of Parapsychology&quot;. The &quot;European Journal of Parapsychology&quot; ceased publishing in 2010.

Parapsychological research has also included other sub-disciplines of psychology. These related fields include transpersonal psychology, which studies transcendent or spiritual aspects of the human mind, and anomalistic psychology, which examines paranormal beliefs and subjective anomalous experiences in traditional psychological terms.

==Research==

===Scope===
Parapsychologists study some ostensible paranormal phenomena, including but not limited to:
* Telepathy: Transfer of information of thoughts or feelings between individuals by means other than the five classical senses.
* Precognition: Perception of information about future places or events before they occur.
* Clairvoyance: Obtaining information about places or events at remote locations by means unknown to current science.
* Psychokinesis: The ability of the mind to influence matter, time, space, or energy by means unknown to current science.
* Near-death experiences: An experience reported by a person who nearly died or who experienced clinical death and then revived.
* Reincarnation: The rebirth of a soul or other non-physical aspect of human consciousness in a new physical body after death.
* Apparitional experiences: Phenomena often attributed to ghosts and encountered in places a deceased individual is thought to have frequented or in association with the person&#x27;s former belongings.

The definitions for the terms above may not reflect their mainstream usage nor the opinions of all parapsychologists and their critics.

According to the Parapsychological Association, parapsychologists do not study all paranormal phenomena, nor are they concerned with astrology, UFOs, cryptozoology, paganism, vampires, alchemy, or witchcraft.

Journals dealing with parapsychology include the &quot;Journal of Parapsychology&quot;, &quot;Journal of Near-Death Studies&quot;, &quot;Journal of Consciousness Studies&quot;, &quot;Journal of the Society for Psychical Research&quot;, and &quot;Journal of Scientific Exploration&quot;.

===Experimental research===

====Ganzfeld====

The Ganzfeld (German for &quot;whole field&quot;) is a technique used to test individuals for telepathy. The technique—a form of moderate sensory deprivation—was developed to quickly quiet mental &quot;noise&quot; by providing mild, unpatterned stimuli to the visual and auditory senses. The visual sense is usually isolated by creating a soft red glow which is diffused through half ping-pong balls placed over the recipient&#x27;s eyes. The auditory sense is usually blocked by playing white noise, static, or similar sounds to the recipient. The subject is also seated in a reclined, comfortable position to minimize the sense of touch.

In the typical Ganzfeld experiment, a &quot;sender&quot; and a &quot;receiver&quot; are isolated. The receiver is put into the Ganzfeld state, or Ganzfeld effect and the sender is shown a video clip or still picture and asked to send that image to the receiver mentally. While in the Ganzfeld, experimenters ask the receiver to continuously speak aloud all mental processes, including images, thoughts, and feelings. At the end of the sending period, typically about 20 to 40 minutes, the receiver is taken out of the Ganzfeld state and shown four images or videos, one of which is the actual target and three non-target decoys. The receiver attempts to select the target, using perceptions experienced during the Ganzfeld state as clues to what the mentally &quot;sent&quot; image might have been.
The Ganzfeld experiment studies that were examined by Ray Hyman and Charles Honorton had methodological problems that were well documented. Honorton reported only 36% of the studies used duplicate target sets of pictures to avoid handling cues. Hyman discovered flaws in all of the 42 Ganzfeld experiments, and to assess each experiment, he devised a set of 12 categories of flaws. Six of these concerned statistical defects, and the other six covered procedural flaws such as inadequate documentation, randomization, security, and possibilities of sensory leakage. Over half of the studies failed to safeguard against sensory leakage, and all of the studies contained at least one of the 12 flaws. Because of the flaws, Honorton agreed with Hyman the 42 Ganzfeld studies could not support the claim for the existence of psi.

Possibilities of sensory leakage in the Ganzfeld experiments included the receivers hearing what was going on in the sender&#x27;s room next door as the rooms were not soundproof and the sender&#x27;s fingerprints to be visible on the target object for the receiver to see. Hyman reviewed the autoganzfeld experiments and discovered a pattern in the data that implied a visual cue may have taken place. Hyman wrote the autoganzfeld experiments were flawed because they did not preclude the possibility of sensory leakage.

In 2010, Lance Storm, Patrizio Tressoldi, and Lorenzo Di Risio analyzed 29 Ganzfeld studies from 1997 to 2008. Of the 1,498 trials, 483 produced hits, corresponding to a hit rate of 32.2%. This hit rate is statistically significant with Participants selected for personality traits and personal characteristics thought to be psi-conducive were found to perform significantly better than unselected participants in the Ganzfeld condition. Hyman (2010) published a rebuttal to Storm &quot;et al&quot;. According to Hyman, &quot;Reliance on meta-analysis as the sole basis for justifying the claim that an anomaly exists and that the evidence for it is consistent and replicable is fallacious. It distorts what scientists mean by confirmatory evidence.&quot; Hyman wrote that the Ganzfeld studies were not independently replicated and failed to produce evidence for psi. Storm &quot;et al&quot;. published a response to Hyman stating that the Ganzfeld experimental design has proved to be consistent and reliable, that parapsychology is a struggling discipline that has not received much attention, and that therefore further research on the subject is necessary. Rouder &quot;et al&quot;. 2013 wrote that critical evaluation of Storm &quot;et al&quot;.&#x27;s meta-analysis reveals no evidence for psi, no plausible mechanism and omitted replication failures.

====Remote viewing====

 Remote viewing is the practice of seeking impressions about a distant or unseen target using subjective means, in particular, extrasensory perception. A remote viewer is typically expected to give information about an object, event, person, or location hidden from physical view and separated at some distance. Several hundred such trials have been conducted by investigators over the past 25 years, including those by the Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Laboratory (PEAR) and by scientists at SRI International and Science Applications International Corporation. Many of these were under contract by the U.S. government as part of the espionage program Stargate Project, which terminated in 1995 having failed to document any practical intelligence value.

The psychologists David Marks and Richard Kammann attempted to replicate Russell Targ and Harold Puthoff&#x27;s remote viewing experiments that were carried out in the 1970s at SRI International. In a series of 35 studies, they could not replicate the results, motivating them to investigate the procedure of the original experiments. Marks and Kammann discovered that the notes given to the judges in Targ and Puthoff&#x27;s experiments contained clues as to the order in which they were carried out, such as referring to yesterday&#x27;s two targets or having the session date written at the top of the page. They concluded that these clues were the reason for the experiment&#x27;s high hit rates. Marks was able to achieve 100 percent accuracy without visiting any of the sites himself but by using cues. James Randi wrote controlled tests in collaboration with several other researchers, eliminating several sources of cueing and extraneous evidence present in the original tests; Randi&#x27;s controlled tests produced negative results. Students could also solve Puthoff and Targ&#x27;s locations from the cues included in the transcripts.

In 1980, Charles Tart claimed that rejudging the transcripts from one of Targ and Puthoff&#x27;s experiments revealed an above-chance result. Targ and Puthoff again refused to provide copies of the transcripts and it was not until July 1985 that they were made available for study, when it was discovered they still contained sensory cues. Marks and Christopher Scott (1986) wrote, &quot;Considering the importance for the remote viewing hypothesis of adequate cue removal, Tart&#x27;s failure to perform this basic task seems beyond comprehension. As previously concluded, remote viewing has not been demonstrated in the experiments conducted by Puthoff and Targ, only the repeated failure of the investigators to remove sensory cues.&quot;

PEAR closed its doors at the end of February 2007. Its founder, Robert G. Jahn, said of it, &quot;For 28 years, we&#x27;ve done what we wanted to do, and there&#x27;s no reason to stay and generate more of the same data.&quot; Statistical flaws in his work have been proposed by others in the parapsychological and general scientific communities. The physicist Robert L. Park said of PEAR, &quot;It&#x27;s been an embarrassment to science, and I think an embarrassment for Princeton&quot;.

====Psychokinesis on random number generators====

The advent of powerful and inexpensive electronic and computer technologies has allowed the development of fully automated experiments studying possible interactions between mind and matter. In the most common experiment of this type, a random number generator (RNG), based on electronic or radioactive noise, produces a data stream that is recorded and analyzed by computer software. A subject attempts to mentally alter the distribution of the random numbers, usually in an experimental design that is functionally equivalent to getting more &quot;heads&quot; than &quot;tails&quot; while flipping a coin. In the RNG experiment, design flexibility can be combined with rigorous controls while collecting a large amount of data quickly. This technique has been used both to test individuals for psychokinesis and to test the possible influence on RNGs of large groups of people.

Major meta-analyses of the RNG database have been published every few years since appearing in the journal &quot;Foundations of Physics&quot; in 1986. PEAR founder Robert G. Jahn and his colleague Brenda Dunne say that the experiments produced &quot;a very small effect&quot; not significant enough to be observed over a brief experiment but over a large number of trials resulted in a tiny statistical deviation from chance. According to Massimo Pigliucci, the results from PEAR can be explained without invoking the paranormal because of two problems with the experiment: &quot;the difficulty of designing machines capable of generating truly random events and the fact that statistical &quot;significance&quot; is not at all a good measure of the importance or genuineness of a phenomenon.&quot; Pigluicci has written that the statistical analysis used by the Jahn and the PEAR group relied on a quantity called a &quot;p-value&quot;, but a problem with p-values is that if the sample size (number of trials) is very large, like the PEAR tests, then one is guaranteed to find artificially low p-values indicating a statistically significant result even though nothing was occurring other than small biases in the experimental apparatus.

Two German independent scientific groups have failed to replicate the PEAR results. Pigliucci has written this was &quot;yet another indication that the simplest hypothesis is likely to be true: there was nothing to replicate.&quot; The most recent meta-analysis on psychokinesis was published in &quot;Psychological Bulletin&quot;, along with several critical commentaries. It analyzed the results of 380 studies; the authors reported an overall positive effect size that was statistically significant but very small relative to the sample size and could, in principle, be explained by publication bias.

====Direct mental interactions with living systems====
Formerly called bio-PK, &quot;direct mental interactions with living systems&quot; (DMILS) studies the effects of one person&#x27;s intentions on a distant person&#x27;s psychophysiological state. One type of DMILS experiment looks at the commonly reported &quot;feeling of being stared at&quot;. The &quot;starer&quot; and the &quot;staree&quot; are isolated in different locations, and the starer is periodically asked to simply gaze at the staree via closed-circuit video links. Meanwhile, the staree&#x27;s nervous system activity is automatically and continuously monitored.

Parapsychologists have interpreted the cumulative data on this and similar DMILS experiments to suggest that one person&#x27;s attention directed towards a remote, isolated person can significantly activate or calm that person&#x27;s nervous system. In a meta-analysis of these experiments published in the &quot;British Journal of Psychology&quot; in 2004, researchers found a small but significant overall DMILS effect. However, the study also found that the effect size was insignificant when a small number of the highest-quality studies from one laboratory were analyzed. The authors concluded that although the existence of some anomaly related to distant intentions cannot be ruled out, there was also a shortage of independent replications and theoretical concepts.

===Dream telepathy===
Parapsychological studies into dream telepathy were carried out at the Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn, New York led by Stanley Krippner and Montague Ullman. They concluded the results from some of their experiments supported dream telepathy. However, the results have not been independently replicated.

The picture target experiments that Krippner and Ullman conducted were criticized by C. E. M. Hansel. According to Hansel, there were weaknesses in the design of the experiments in the way in which the agents became aware of their target picture. Only the agent should have known the target, and no other person should have known until the targets were judged; however, an experimenter was with the agent when the target envelope was opened. Hansel also wrote that the experiment had poor controls as the main experimenter could communicate with the subject. In 2002, Krippner denied Hansel&#x27;s accusations, claiming the agent did not communicate with the experimenter.

Edward Belvedere and David Foulkes attempted to replicate the picture-target experiments. The finding was that neither the subject nor the judges matched the targets with dreams above chance level. Results from other experiments by Belvedere and Foulkes were also negative.

In 2003, Simon Sherwood and Chris Roe wrote a review that claimed support for dream telepathy at Maimonides. However, James Alcock noted that their review was based on &quot;extreme messiness&quot; of data. Alcock concluded the dream telepathy experiments at Maimonides have failed to provide evidence for telepathy and &quot;lack of replication is rampant&quot;.

===Near-death experiences===
 A near-death experience (NDE) is an experience reported by a person who nearly died, or who experienced clinical death and then revived. NDEs include one or more of the following experiences: a sense of being dead; an out-of-body experience; a sensation of floating above one&#x27;s body and seeing the surrounding area; a sense of overwhelming love and peace; a sensation of moving upwards through a tunnel or narrow passageway; meeting deceased relatives or spiritual figures; encountering a being of light, or a light; experiencing a life review; reaching a border or boundary; and a feeling of being returned to the body, often accompanied by reluctance.

Interest in the NDE was spurred initially by the research of psychiatrists Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, George G. Ritchie, and Raymond Moody. In 1975, Moody wrote the best-selling book &quot;Life After Life&quot; and in 1977, he wrote a second book, &quot;Reflections on Life After Life&quot;. In 1998, Moody was appointed chair in &quot;consciousness studies&quot; at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. The International Association for Near-death Studies (IANDS) was founded in 1978 to meet the needs of early researchers and experiencers within this field of research. Later researchers, such as psychiatrist Bruce Greyson, psychologist Kenneth Ring, and cardiologist Michael Sabom, introduced the study of near-death experiences to the academic setting.

===Reincarnation research===
Psychiatrist Ian Stevenson, from the University of Virginia, conducted more than 2,500 case studies over 40 years and published twelve books. He wrote that childhood memories ostensibly related to reincarnation normally occurred between the ages of three and seven years and then faded shortly afterward. He compared the memories with reports of people known to the deceased, attempting to do so before any contact between the child and the deceased&#x27;s family had occurred, and searched for disconfirming evidence that could provide alternative explanations for the reports aside from reincarnation.

Some 35 percent of the subjects examined by Stevenson had birthmarks or congenital disabilities. Stevenson believed that the existence of birthmarks and deformities on children, when they occurred at the location of fatal wounds in the deceased, provided the best evidence for reincarnation. However, Stevenson has never claimed that he had proved the existence of reincarnation, and cautiously referred to his cases as being &quot;of the reincarnation type&quot; or &quot;suggestive of reincarnation&quot;. Researchers who believe in the evidence for reincarnation have been unsuccessful in getting the scientific community to consider it a serious possibility.

Ian Wilson argued that a large number of Stevenson&#x27;s cases consisted of poor children remembering wealthy lives or belonging to a higher caste. He speculated that such cases may represent a scheme to obtain money from the family of the alleged former incarnation. Philosopher Keith Augustine has written, &quot;The vast majority of Stevenson&#x27;s cases come from countries where a religious belief in reincarnation is strong, and rarely elsewhere, seems to indicate that cultural conditioning (rather than reincarnation) generates claims of spontaneous past-life memories.&quot; Philosopher Paul Edwards wrote that reincarnation invokes logically dubious assumptions and is inconsistent with modern science.

==Scientific reception==
===Evaluation===

The scientific consensus is that there is insufficient evidence to support the existence of psi phenomena.

Scientists critical of parapsychology state that its extraordinary claims demand extraordinary evidence if they are to be taken seriously. Scientists who have evaluated parapsychology have written the entire body of evidence is of poor quality and not adequately controlled. In support of this view, critics cite instances of fraud, flawed studies, and cognitive biases (such as clustering illusion, availability error, confirmation bias, illusion of control, magical thinking, and the bias blind spot) as ways to explain parapsychological results. Research has also shown that people&#x27;s desire to believe in paranormal phenomena causes them to discount strong evidence that it does not exist.

The psychologists Donovan Rawcliffe (1952), C. E. M. Hansel (1980), Ray Hyman (1989), and Andrew Neher (2011) have studied the history of psi experiments from the late 19th century up until the 1980s. Flaws and weaknesses were discovered in every experiment investigated, so the possibility of sensory leakage and trickery were not ruled out. The data from the Creery sister and the Soal-Goldney experiments were proven to be fraudulent, one of the subjects from the Smith-Blackburn experiments confessed to fraud, the Brugmans experiment, the experiments by John Edgar Coover and those conducted by Joseph Gaither Pratt and Helmut Schmidt had flaws in the design of the experiments, did not rule out the possibility of sensory cues or trickery and have not been replicated.

According to critics, psi is negatively defined as any effect that cannot be currently explained in terms of chance or normal causes, and this is a fallacy as it encourages parapsychologists to use any peculiarity in the data as a characteristic of psi. Parapsychologists have admitted it is impossible to eliminate the possibility of non-paranormal causes in their experiments. There is no independent method to indicate the presence or absence of psi. Persi Diaconis has written that the controls in parapsychological experiments are often loose with possibilities of subject cheating and unconscious sensory cues.

In 1998, physics professor Michael W. Friedlander noted that parapsychology has &quot;failed to produce any clear evidence for the existence of anomalous effects that require us to go beyond the known region of science.&quot; Philosopher and skeptic Robert Todd Carroll has written research in parapsychology has been characterized by &quot;deception, fraud, and incompetence in setting up properly controlled experiments and evaluating statistical data.&quot; The psychologist Ray Hyman has pointed out that some parapsychologists such as Dick Bierman, Walter Lucadou, J. E. Kennedy, and Robert Jahn have admitted the evidence for psi is &quot;inconsistent, irreproducible, and fails to meet acceptable scientific standards.&quot; Richard Wiseman has criticized the parapsychological community for widespread errors in research methods including cherry-picking new procedures which may produce preferred results, explaining away unsuccessful attempted replications with claims of an &quot;experimenter effect&quot;, data mining, and retrospective data selection.

Independent evaluators and researchers dispute the existence of parapsychological phenomena and the scientific validity of parapsychological research. In 1988, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences published a report on the subject that concluded that &quot;no scientific justification from research conducted over a period of 130 years for the existence of parapsychological phenomena.&quot; No accepted theory of parapsychology currently exists, and many competing and often conflicting models have been advocated by different parapsychologists in an attempt to explain reported paranormal phenomena. Terence Hines in his book &quot;Pseudoscience and the Paranormal&quot; (2003), wrote, &quot;Many theories have been proposed by parapsychologists to explain how psi takes place. To skeptics, such theory building seems premature, as the phenomena to be explained by the theories have yet to be demonstrated convincingly.&quot; Skeptics such as Antony Flew have cited the lack of such a theory as their reason for rejecting parapsychology.

In a review of parapsychological reports, Hyman wrote, &quot;randomization is often inadequate, multiple statistical testing without adjustment for significance levels is prevalent, possibilities for sensory leakage are not uniformly prevented, errors in use of statistical tests are much too common, and documentation is typically inadequate&quot;. Parapsychology has been criticized for making no precise predictions.

In 2003, James Alcock Professor of Psychology at York University published &quot;Give the Null Hypothesis a Chance: Reasons to Remain Doubtful about the Existence of Psi&quot;, where he claimed that parapsychologists never seem to take seriously the possibility that psi does not exist. Because of that, they interpret null results as indicating only that they were unable to observe psi in a particular experiment rather than taking it as support for the possibility that there is no psi. The failure to take the null hypothesis as a serious alternative to their psi hypotheses leads them to rely upon many arbitrary &quot;effects&quot; to excuse failures to find predicted effects, excuse the lack of consistency in outcomes, and excuse failures to replicate.

Fundamental endemic problems in parapsychological research include, amongst others: insufficient definition of the subject matter, total reliance on negative definitions of their phenomena (e.g., psi is said to occur only when all known normal influences are ruled out); failure to produce a single phenomenon that neutral researchers can independently replicate; the invention of &quot;effects&quot; such as the psi-experimenter effect to explain away inconsistencies in the data and failures to achieve predicted outcomes; unfalsifiability of claims; the unpredictability of effects; lack of progress in over a century of formal research; methodological weaknesses; reliance on statistical procedures to determine when psi has supposedly occurred, even though statistical analysis does not in itself justify a claim that psi has occurred; and failure to jibe with other areas of science. Overall, he argues that there is nothing in parapsychological research that would ever lead parapsychologists to conclude that psi does not exist. So, even if it does not, the search will likely continue for a long time. &quot;I continue to believe that parapsychology is, at bottom, motivated by belief in search of data, rather than data in search of explanation.&quot;

Alcock and cognitive psychologist Arthur S. Reber have criticized parapsychology broadly, writing that if psi effects were true, they would negate fundamental principles of science such as causality, time&#x27;s arrow, thermodynamics, and the inverse square law. According to Alcock and Reber, &quot;parapsychology cannot be true unless the rest of science isn&#x27;t. Moreover, if psi effects were real, they would have already fatally disrupted the rest of the body of science&quot;.

Richard Land has written that from what is known about human biology, it is implausible that evolution has provided humans with ESP as research has shown the recognized five senses are adequate for the evolution and survival of the species. Michael Shermer, in the article &quot;Psychic Drift: Why most scientists do not believe in ESP and psi phenomena&quot; for &quot;Scientific American&quot;, wrote &quot;the reason for skepticism is that we need replicable data and a viable theory, both of which are missing in psi research.&quot;

In January 2008, the results of a study using neuroimaging were published. To provide what are purported to be the most favorable experimental conditions, the study included appropriate emotional stimuli and had biologically or emotionally related participants, such as twins. The experiment was designed to produce positive results if telepathy, clairvoyance or precognition occurred. Still, despite this, no distinguishable neuronal responses were found between psychic and non-psychic stimuli, while variations in the same stimuli showed anticipated effects on brain activation patterns. The researchers concluded, &quot;These findings are the strongest evidence yet obtained against the existence of paranormal mental phenomena.&quot; Other studies have attempted to test the psi hypothesis by using functional neuroimaging. A neuroscience review of the studies (Acunzo &quot;et al&quot;. 2013) discovered methodological weaknesses that could account for the reported psi effects.

A 2014 study discovered that schizophrenic patients have more belief in psi than healthy adults.

Some researchers have become skeptical of parapsychology, such as Susan Blackmore and John Taylor, after years of study and no progress in demonstrating the existence of psi by the scientific method.

===Physics===

The ideas of psi (precognition, psychokinesis and telepathy) violate well-established laws of physics. Psychokinesis violates the inverse-square law, the second law of thermodynamics, and the conservation of momentum. There is no known mechanism for psi.

On the subject of psychokinesis, the physicist Sean M. Carroll has written that both human brains and the spoons they try to bend are made, like all matter, of quarks and leptons; everything else they do emerges as properties of the behavior of quarks and leptons. The quarks and leptons interact through the four forces: strong, weak, electromagnetic, and gravitational. Thus, either it is one of the four known forces, or it is a new force, and any new force with a range over 1 millimeter must be at most a billionth the strength of gravity, or it will have been captured in experiments already done. This leaves no physical force that could account for psychokinesis.

Physicist John G. Taylor, who investigated parapsychological claims, wrote that an unknown fifth force causing psychokinesis would have to transmit a great deal of energy. The energy would have to overcome the electromagnetic forces binding the atoms together. The atoms would need to respond more strongly to the fifth force while it is operative than to electric forces. Therefore, such an additional force between atoms should exist all the time and not only during alleged paranormal occurrences. Taylor wrote there is no scientific trace of such a force in physics, down to many orders of magnitude; thus, if a scientific viewpoint is to be preserved, the idea of any fifth force must be discarded. Taylor concluded there is no possible physical mechanism for psychokinesis, and it is in complete contradiction to established science.

Felix Planer, a professor of electrical engineering, has written that if psychokinesis were real, then it would be easy to demonstrate by getting subjects to depress a scale on a sensitive balance, raise the temperature of a water bath which could be measured with an accuracy of a hundredth of a degree Celsius or affect an element in an electrical circuit such as a resistor which could be monitored to better than a millionth of an ampere. Planer writes that such experiments are extremely sensitive and easy to monitor but are not utilized by parapsychologists as they &quot;do not hold out the remotest hope of demonstrating even a minute trace of PK&quot; because the alleged phenomenon is non-existent. Planer has written that parapsychologists fall back on studies that involve only unrepeatable statistics, owing their results to poor experimental methods, recording mistakes, and faulty statistical mathematics.

According to Planer, &quot;all research in medicine and other sciences would become illusionary, if the existence of PK had to be taken seriously; for no experiment could be relied upon to furnish objective results, since all measurements would become falsified to a greater or lesser degree, according to his PK ability, by the experimenter&#x27;s wishes.&quot; Planer concluded the concept of psychokinesis is absurd and has no scientific basis.

Philosopher and physicist Mario Bunge has written that &quot;psychokinesis, or PK, violates the principle that mind cannot act directly on matter. (If it did, no experimenter could trust his readings of measuring instruments.) It also violates the principles of conservation of energy and momentum. The claim that quantum mechanics allows for the possibility of mental power influencing randomizers—an alleged case of micro-PK—is ludicrous since that theory respects the said conservation principles, and it deals exclusively with physical things.&quot;

The physicist Robert L. Park questioned if the mind really could influence matter, then it would be easy for parapsychologists to measure such a phenomenon by using the alleged psychokinetic power to deflect a microbalance which would not require any dubious statistics but &quot;the reason, of course, is that the microbalance stubbornly refuses to budge.&quot; Park has suggested the reason statistical studies are so popular in parapsychology is because they introduce opportunities for uncertainty and error, which are used to support the biases of the experimenter. Park wrote, &quot;No proof of psychic phenomena is ever found. In spite of all the tests devised by parapsychologists like Jahn and Radin, and huge amounts of data collected over a period of many years, the results are no more convincing today than when they began their experiments.&quot;

===Pseudoscience===

Parapsychological theories are viewed as pseudoscientific by the scientific community as incompatible with well-established laws of science. As there is no repeatable evidence for psi, the field is often regarded as a pseudoscience.

The philosopher Raimo Tuomela summarized why the majority of scientists consider parapsychology to be a pseudoscience in his essay &quot;Science, Protoscience, and Pseudoscience&quot;.
* Parapsychology relies on an ill-defined ontology and typically shuns exact thinking.
* The hypotheses and theories of parapsychology have not been proven and are in bad shape.
* Extremely little progress has taken place in parapsychology on the whole and parapsychology conflicts with established science.
* Parapsychology has poor research problems, being concerned with establishing the existence of its subject matter and having practically no theories to create proper research problems.
* While in parts of parapsychology there are attempts to use the methods of science there are also unscientific areas; and in any case parapsychological research can at best qualify as prescientific because of its poor theoretical foundation.
* Parapsychology is a largely isolated research area.

The methods of parapsychologists are regarded by critics, including those who wrote the science standards for the California State Board of Education, to be pseudoscientific. Some of the more specific criticisms state that parapsychology does not have a clearly defined subject matter, an easily repeatable experiment that can demonstrate a psi effect on demand, nor an underlying theory to explain the paranormal transfer of information. James Alcock has stated that few of parapsychology&#x27;s experimental results have prompted interdisciplinary research with more mainstream sciences such as physics or biology and that parapsychology remains an isolated science to such an extent that its very legitimacy is questionable, and as a whole is not justified in being labeled &quot;scientific&quot;.
Alcock wrote, &quot;Parapsychology is indistinguishable from pseudo-science, and its ideas are essentially those of magic... There is &quot;no&quot; evidence that would lead the cautious observer to believe that parapsychologists and paraphysicists are on the track of a real phenomenon, a real energy or power that has so far escaped the attention of those people engaged in &quot;normal&quot; science.&quot;

The scientific community considers parapsychology a pseudoscience because it continues to explore the hypothesis that psychic abilities exist despite a century of experimental results that fail to demonstrate that hypothesis conclusively. A panel commissioned by the United States National Research Council to study paranormal claims concluded that &quot;despite a 130-year record of scientific research on such matters, our committee could find no scientific justification for the existence of phenomena such as extrasensory perception, mental telepathy or &#x27;mind over matter&#x27; exercises... Evaluation of a large body of the best available evidence simply does not support the contention that these phenomena exist.&quot;

There is also an issue of non-falsifiability associated with psi. On this subject Terence Hines has written:

Mario Bunge has written that research in parapsychology for over a hundred years has produced no firm findings or testable predictions. All parapsychologists can do is claim alleged data is anomalous and beyond the reach of ordinary science. The aim of parapsychologists &quot;is not that of finding laws and systematizing them into theories in order to understand and forecast&quot; but to &quot;buttress ancient spiritualist myths or to serve as a surrogate for lost religions.&quot;

The psychologist David Marks has written that parapsychologists have failed to produce a single repeatable demonstration of the paranormal and described psychical research as a pseudoscience, an &quot;incoherent collection of belief systems steeped in fantasy, illusion and error.&quot; However, Chris French, who is not convinced that parapsychology has demonstrated evidence for psi, has argued that parapsychological experiments still adhere to the scientific method and should not be completely dismissed as pseudoscience. &quot;Sceptics like myself will often point out that there&#x27;s been systematic research in parapsychology for well over a century, and so far the wider scientific community is not convinced.&quot; French has noted his position is &quot;the minority view among critics of parapsychology&quot;.

Philosopher Bradley Dowden characterized parapsychology as a pseudoscience because parapsychologists have no valid theories to test or reproducible data from their experiments.

=== Fraud ===
There have been instances of fraud in the history of parapsychology research. In the late 19th century, the Creery Sisters (Mary, Alice, Maud, Kathleen, and Emily) were tested by the Society for Psychical Research and believed them to have genuine psychic ability; however, during a later experiment they were caught utilizing signal codes and they confessed to fraud. George Albert Smith and Douglas Blackburn were claimed to be genuine psychics by the Society for Psychical Research, but Blackburn confessed to fraud:

The experiments of Samuel Soal and K. M. Goldney of 1941–1943 (suggesting the precognitive ability of a single participant) were long regarded as some of the best in the field because they relied upon independent checking and witnesses to prevent fraud. However, many years later, statistical evidence, uncovered and published by other parapsychologists in the field, suggested that Soal had cheated by altering some of the raw data.

In 1974, many experiments by Walter J. Levy, J. B. Rhine&#x27;s successor as director of the Institute for Parapsychology, were exposed as fraudulent. Levy had reported on a series of successful ESP experiments involving computer-controlled manipulation of non-human subjects, including rats. His experiments showed very high positive results. However, Levy&#x27;s fellow researchers became suspicious about his methods. They found that Levy interfered with data-recording equipment, manually creating fraudulent strings of positive results. Levy confessed to the fraud and resigned.

In 1974, Rhine published the paper &quot;Security versus Deception in Parapsychology&quot; in the Journal of Parapsychology, which documented 12 cases of fraud that he had detected from 1940 to 1950 but refused to give the names of the participants in the studies. Massimo Pigliucci has written:

Most damning of all, Rhine admitted publicly that he had uncovered at least twelve instances of dishonesty among his researchers in a single decade, from 1940 to 1950. However, he flaunted standard academic protocol by refusing to divulge the names of the fraudsters, which means that there is unknown number of published papers in the literature that claim paranormal effects while in fact they were the result of conscious deception.

Martin Gardner claimed to have inside information that files in Rhine&#x27;s laboratory contain material suggesting fraud on the part of Hubert Pearce. Pearce was never able to obtain above-chance results when persons other than the experimenter were present during an experiment, making it more likely that he was cheating in some way. Rhine&#x27;s other subjects could only obtain non-chance levels when they could shuffle the cards, which suggested they used tricks to arrange the order of the Zener cards before the experiments started.

A researcher from Tarkio College in Missouri, James D. MacFarland, was suspected of falsifying data to achieve positive psi results. Before the fraud was discovered, MacFarland published two articles in the &quot;Journal of Parapsychology&quot; (1937 &amp; 1938) supporting the existence of ESP. Presumably speaking about MacFarland, Louisa Rhine wrote that in reviewing the data submitted to the lab in 1938, the researchers at the Duke Parapsychology Lab recognized the fraud. &quot;...before long they were all certain that Jim had consistently falsified his records... To produce extra hits, Jim had to resort to erasures and transpositions in the records of his call series.&quot; MacFarland never published another article in the Journal of Parapsychology after the fraud was discovered.

Some instances of fraud amongst spiritualist mediums were exposed by early psychical researchers such as Richard Hodgson and Harry Price. In the 1920s, magician and escapologist Harry Houdini said that researchers and observers had not created experimental procedures that preclude fraud.

===Criticism of experimental results===
Critical analysts, including some parapsychologists, are unsatisfied with experimental parapsychology studies. Some reviewers, such as psychologist Ray Hyman, contend that apparently successful experimental results in psi research are more likely due to sloppy procedures, poorly trained researchers, or methodological flaws rather than to genuine psi effects. Fellow psychologist Stuart Vyse hearkens back to a time of data manipulation, now recognized as &quot;p-hacking&quot;, as part of the issue. Within parapsychology there are disagreements over the results and methodology as well. For example, the experiments at the PEAR laboratory were criticized in a paper published by the &quot;Journal of Parapsychology&quot; in which parapsychologists independent from the PEAR laboratory concluded that these experiments &quot;depart[ed] from criteria usually expected in formal scientific experimentation&quot; due to &quot;[p]roblems with regard to randomization, statistical baselines, application of statistical models, agent coding of descriptor lists, feedback to percipients, sensory cues, and precautions against cheating.&quot; They felt that the originally stated significance values were &quot;meaningless&quot;.

A typical measure of psi phenomena is a statistical deviation from chance expectation. However, critics point out that statistical deviation is, strictly speaking, only evidence of a statistical anomaly, and the cause of the deviation is not known. Hyman contends that even if psi experiments that regularly reproduce similar deviations from chance could be designed, they would not necessarily prove psychic functioning. Critics have coined the term &quot;The Psi Assumption&quot; to describe &quot;the assumption that any significant departure from the laws of chance in a test of psychic ability is evidence that something anomalous or paranormal has occurred...[in other words] assuming what they should be proving.&quot; These critics hold that concluding the existence of psychic phenomena based on chance deviation in inadequately designed experiments is &quot;affirming the consequent&quot; or &quot;begging the question.&quot;

In 1979, magician and debunker James Randi engineered a hoax, now referred to as Project Alpha to encourage a tightening of standards within the parapsychology community. Randi recruited two young magicians and sent them undercover to Washington University&#x27;s McDonnell Laboratory, where they &quot;fooled researchers ... into believing they had paranormal powers.&quot; The aim was to expose poor experimental methods and the credulity thought to be common in parapsychology. Randi has stated that both of his recruits deceived experimenters for three years with demonstrations of supposedly psychic abilities: blowing electric fuses sealed in a box, causing a lightweight paper rotor perched atop a needle to turn inside a bell jar, bending metal spoons sealed in a glass bottle, etc. The hoax by Randi raised ethical concerns in the scientific and parapsychology communities, eliciting criticism even among skeptical communities such as the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP), which he helped found, but also positive responses from the President of the Parapsychological Association Stanley Krippner. Psychologist Ray Hyman, a CSICOP member, called the results &quot;counterproductive&quot;.

===Selection bias and meta-analysis===
Selective reporting has been offered by critics as an explanation for the positive results reported by parapsychologists. Selective reporting is sometimes called a &quot;file drawer&quot; problem, which arises when only positive study results are made public, while studies with negative or null results are not made public. Selective reporting has a compounded effect on meta-analysis, which is a statistical technique that aggregates the results of many studies to generate sufficient statistical power to demonstrate a result that the individual studies themselves could not demonstrate at a statistically significant level. For example, a recent meta-analysis combined 380 studies on psychokinesis, including data from the PEAR lab. It concluded that, although there is a statistically significant overall effect, it is inconsistent, and relatively few negative studies would cancel it out. Consequently, biased publication of positive results could be the cause.

Numerous researchers have criticized the popularity of meta-analysis in parapsychology, and is often seen as troublesome even within parapsychology. Critics have said that parapsychologists misuse meta-analysis to create the incorrect impression that statistically significant results have been obtained that indicate the existence of psi phenomena. Physicist Robert Park states that parapsychology&#x27;s reported positive results are problematic because most such findings are invariably at the margin of statistical significance and that might be explained by a number of confounding effects; Park states that such marginal results are a typical symptom of pathological science as described by Irving Langmuir.

Researcher J. E. Kennedy has said that concerns over meta-analysis in science and medicine also apply to problems present in parapsychological meta-analysis. As a post-hoc analysis, critics emphasize the opportunity the method presents to produce biased outcomes via selecting cases chosen for study, methods employed, and other key criteria. Critics say that analogous problems with meta-analysis have been documented in medicine, where it has been shown different investigators performing meta-analyses of the same set of studies have reached contradictory conclusions.

===Anomalistic psychology===
In anomalistic psychology, paranormal phenomena have naturalistic explanations resulting from psychological and physical factors, which have sometimes given the impression of paranormal activity to some people when, in fact, there have been none. According to the psychologist Chris French:

While parapsychology has declined, anomalistic psychology has risen. It is now offered as an option in some psychology degree programs. It is also an option on the A2 psychology syllabus in the UK.

===Skeptic organizations===
Organizations that encourage a critical examination of parapsychology and parapsychological research include the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, publisher of the &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot;; the James Randi Educational Foundation, founded by illusionist and skeptic James Randi, and the Occult Investigative Committee of the Society of American Magicians a society for professional magicians/illusionists that seeks &quot;the promotion of harmony among magicians, and the opposition of the unnecessary public exposure of magical effects.&quot;

<text>Presburger arithmetic is the first-order theory of the natural numbers with addition, named in honor of Mojżesz Presburger, who introduced it in 1929. The signature of Presburger arithmetic contains only the addition operation and equality, omitting the multiplication operation entirely. The theory is computably axiomatizable; the axioms include a schema of induction.

Presburger arithmetic is much weaker than Peano arithmetic, which includes both addition and multiplication operations. Unlike Peano arithmetic, Presburger arithmetic is a decidable theory. This means it is possible to algorithmically determine, for any sentence in the language of Presburger arithmetic, whether that sentence is provable from the axioms of Presburger arithmetic. The asymptotic running-time computational complexity of this algorithm is at least doubly exponential, however, as shown by .

==Overview==
The language of Presburger arithmetic contains constants 0 and 1 and a binary function +, interpreted as addition.

In this language, the axioms of Presburger arithmetic are the universal closures of the following:
# ¬(0 = &quot;x&quot; + 1)
# &quot;x&quot; + 1 = &quot;y&quot; + 1 → &quot;x&quot; = &quot;y&quot;
# &quot;x&quot; + 0 = &quot;x&quot;
# &quot;x&quot; + (&quot;y&quot; + 1) = (&quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot;) + 1
# Let &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) be a first-order formula in the language of Presburger arithmetic with a free variable &quot;x&quot; (and possibly other free variables). Then the following formula is an axiom:(&quot;P&quot;(0) ∧ ∀&quot;x&quot;(&quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) → &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot; + 1))) → ∀&quot;y&quot; &quot;P&quot;(&quot;y&quot;).

(5) is an axiom schema of induction, representing infinitely many axioms. These cannot be replaced by any finite number of axioms, that is, Presburger arithmetic is not finitely axiomatizable in first-order logic.

Presburger arithmetic can be viewed as a first-order theory with equality containing precisely all consequences of the above axioms. Alternatively, it can be defined as the set of those sentences that are true in the intended interpretation: the structure of non-negative integers with constants 0, 1, and the addition of non-negative integers.

Presburger arithmetic is designed to be complete and decidable. Therefore, it cannot formalize concepts such as divisibility or primality, or, more generally, any number concept leading to multiplication of variables. However, it can formulate individual instances of divisibility; for example, it proves &quot;for all &quot;x&quot;, there exists &quot;y&quot; : (&quot;y&quot; + &quot;y&quot; = &quot;x&quot;) ∨ (&quot;y&quot; + &quot;y&quot; + 1 = &quot;x&quot;)&quot;. This states that every number is either even or odd.

==Properties==

 proved Presburger arithmetic to be:
* consistent: There is no statement in Presburger arithmetic that can be deduced from the axioms such that its negation can also be deduced.
* complete: For each statement in the language of Presburger arithmetic, either it is possible to deduce it from the axioms or it is possible to deduce its negation. 
* decidable: There exists an algorithm that decides whether any given statement in Presburger arithmetic is a theorem or a nontheorem - note that a &quot;nontheorem&quot; is a formula that cannot be proved, not in general necessarily one whose negation can be proved, but in the case of a complete theory like here both definitions are equivalent.

The decidability of Presburger arithmetic can be shown using quantifier elimination, supplemented by reasoning about arithmetical congruence. The steps used to justify a quantifier elimination algorithm can be used to define computable axiomatizations that do not necessarily contain the axiom schema of induction.

In contrast, Peano arithmetic, which is Presburger arithmetic augmented with multiplication, is not decidable, as proved by Church alongside the negative answer to the Entscheidungsproblem. By Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem, Peano arithmetic is incomplete and its consistency is not internally provable (but see Gentzen&#x27;s consistency proof).

=== Computational complexity ===
The decision problem for Presburger arithmetic is an interesting example in computational complexity theory and computation. Let &quot;n&quot; be the length of a statement in Presburger arithmetic. Then proved that, in the worst case, the proof of the statement in first-order logic has length at least formula_1, for some constant &quot;c&quot;&gt;0. Hence, their decision algorithm for Presburger arithmetic has runtime at least exponential. Fischer and Rabin also proved that for any reasonable axiomatization (defined precisely in their paper), there exist theorems of length &quot;n&quot; that have doubly exponential length proofs. Fischer and Rabin&#x27;s work also implies that Presburger arithmetic can be used to define formulas that correctly calculate any algorithm as long as the inputs are less than relatively large bounds. The bounds can be increased, but only by using new formulas. On the other hand, a triply exponential upper bound on a decision procedure for Presburger arithmetic was proved by .

A more tight complexity bound was shown using alternating complexity classes by . The set of true statements in Presburger arithmetic (PA) is shown complete for TimeAlternations(22nO(1), n). Thus, its complexity is between double exponential nondeterministic time (2-NEXP) and double exponential space (2-EXPSPACE). Completeness is under polynomial time many-to-one reductions. (Also, note that while Presburger arithmetic is commonly abbreviated PA, in mathematics in general PA usually means Peano arithmetic.)

For a more fine-grained result, let PA(i) be the set of true Σi PA statements, and PA(i, j) the set of true Σi PA statements with each quantifier block limited to j variables. &#x27;&lt;&#x27; is considered to be quantifier-free; here, bounded quantifiers are counted as quantifiers.
PA(1, j) is in P, while PA(1) is NP-complete.
For i &gt; 0 and j &gt; 2, PA(i + 1, j) is ΣiP-complete. The hardness result only needs j&gt;2 (as opposed to j=1) in the last quantifier block.
For i&gt;0, PA(i+1) is ΣiEXP-complete.

Short formula_2 Presburger Arithmetic (formula_3) is formula_4 complete (and thus NP complete for formula_5). Here, &#x27;short&#x27; requires bounded (i.e. formula_6) sentence size except that integer constants are unbounded (but their number of bits in binary counts against input size). Also, formula_7 two variable PA (without the restriction of being &#x27;short&#x27;) is NP-complete. Short formula_8 (and thus formula_7) PA is in P, and this extends to fixed-dimensional parametric integer linear programming.

==Applications==
Because Presburger arithmetic is decidable, automatic theorem provers for Presburger arithmetic exist. For example, the Coq proof assistant system features the tactic omega for Presburger arithmetic and the Isabelle proof assistant contains a verified quantifier elimination procedure by . The double exponential complexity of the theory makes it infeasible to use the theorem provers on complicated formulas, but this behavior occurs only in the presence of nested quantifiers: describe an automatic theorem prover that uses the simplex algorithm on an extended Presburger arithmetic without nested quantifiers to prove some of the instances of quantifier-free Presburger arithmetic formulas. More recent satisfiability modulo theories solvers use complete integer programming techniques to handle quantifier-free fragment of Presburger arithmetic theory.

Presburger arithmetic can be extended to include multiplication by constants, since multiplication is repeated addition. Most array subscript calculations then fall within the region of decidable problems. This approach is the basis of at least five proof-of-correctness systems for computer programs, beginning with the Stanford Pascal Verifier in the late 1970s and continuing through to Microsoft&#x27;s Spec# system of 2005.

==Presburger-definable integer relation==
Some properties are now given about integer relations definable in Presburger Arithmetic. For the sake of simplicity, all relations considered in this section are over non-negative integers.

A relation is Presburger-definable if and only if it is a semilinear set.

A unary integer relation formula_10, that is, a set of non-negative integers, is Presburger-definable if and only if it is ultimately periodic. That is, if there exists a threshold formula_11 and a positive period formula_12 such that, for all integer formula_13 such that formula_14, formula_15 if and only if formula_16.

By the Cobham–Semenov theorem, a relation is Presburger-definable if and only if it is definable in Büchi arithmetic of base formula_17 for all formula_18. A relation definable in Büchi arithmetic of base formula_17 and formula_20 for formula_17 and formula_20 being multiplicatively independent integers is Presburger definable.

An integer relation formula_10 is Presburger-definable if and only if all sets of integers that are definable in first-order logic with addition and formula_10 (that is, Presburger arithmetic plus a predicate for formula_10) are Presburger-definable. Equivalently, for each relation formula_10 that is not Presburger-definable, there exists a first-order formula with addition and formula_10 that defines a set of integers that is not definable using only addition.

===Muchnik&#x27;s characterization===
Presburger-definable relations admit another characterization: by Muchnik&#x27;s theorem. It is more complicated to state, but led to the proof of the two former characterizations. Before Muchnik&#x27;s theorem can be stated, some additional definitions must be introduced.

Let formula_28 be a set, the section formula_29 of formula_10, for formula_31 and formula_32 is defined as 
:formula_33

Given two sets formula_34 and a of integers formula_35, the set formula_10 is called formula_37-periodic in formula_38 if, for all formula_39 such that formula_40 then formula_41 if and only if formula_42. For formula_43, the set formula_10 is said to be in formula_38 if it is for some formula_46 such that 

:formula_47

Finally, for formula_48 let 
:formula_49 
denote the cube of size formula_17 whose lesser corner is formula_51.

Intuitively, the integer formula_52 represents the length of a shift, the integer formula_17 is the size of the cubes and formula_54 is the threshold before the periodicity. This result remains true when the condition 

:formula_55 

is replaced either by formula_56 or by formula_57.

This characterization led to the so-called &quot;definable criterion for definability in Presburger arithmetic&quot;, that is: there exists a first-order formula with addition and a predicate formula_10 that holds if and only if formula_10 is interpreted by a Presburger-definable relation. Muchnik&#x27;s theorem also allows one to prove that it is decidable whether an automatic sequence accepts a Presburger-definable set.

<text>Purdue University is a public land-grant research university in West Lafayette, Indiana, United States, and the flagship campus of the Purdue University system. The university was founded in 1869 after Lafayette businessman John Purdue donated land and money to establish a college of science, technology, and agriculture; the first classes were held on September 16, 1874.

Purdue University is a member of the Association of American Universities and is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;. Purdue enrolls the largest student body of any individual university campus in Indiana, as well as the ninth-largest foreign student population of any university in the United States. The university is home to the oldest computer science program in the United States.

Purdue is the founding member of the Big Ten Conference and sponsors 18 intercollegiate sports teams. It has been affiliated with 13 Nobel laureates, 1 Turing Award laureate, 1 Bharat Ratna recipient, 27 astronauts, 2 World Food Prize laureates, 3 Pulitzer Prize winners, 18 Olympic medalists, 3 National Medal of Technology and Innovation recipients, 2 National Medal of Science recipients, 3 Presidential Medal of Freedom recipients, 7 members of Congress, 3 U.S. governors, and 2 heads of state.

==History==

In 1865, the Indiana General Assembly voted to take advantage of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act of 1862 and began plans to establish an institution with a focus on agriculture and engineering with the preliminary name of the Indiana Agricultural College. Communities throughout the state offered facilities and funding in bids for the location of the new college. Popular proposals included designating Indiana University or what is now Butler University as Indiana&#x27;s land-grant, as well as the addition of an agriculture department at what is now Indiana State University. By 1869, Tippecanoe County&#x27;s offer included $150,000 (equivalent to $ million in ) from Lafayette business leader and philanthropist John Purdue; $50,000 from the county; and of land from John Purdue and local residents.

On May 6, 1869, the General Assembly established the institution in Tippecanoe County as Purdue University, in the name of the principal benefactor. Classes began at Purdue on September 16, 1874, with six instructors and 39 students. Professor John S. Hougham was Purdue&#x27;s first faculty member and served as acting president between the administrations of presidents Shortridge and White. A campus of five buildings was completed by the end of 1874. In 1875, Sarah A. Oren, the State Librarian of Indiana, was appointed professor of botany.

Purdue issued its first degree, a Bachelor of Science in chemistry, in 1875. The first female student was admitted that autumn.

Emerson E. White, the university&#x27;s president from 1876 to 1883, followed a strict interpretation of the Morrill Act. Rather than emulate the classical universities, White believed Purdue should be an &quot;industrial college&quot; and devote its resources toward providing a broad, liberal education with an emphasis on science, technology, and agriculture.

Part of White&#x27;s plan to distinguish Purdue from classical universities included a controversial attempt to ban fraternities, which was ultimately overturned by the Indiana Supreme Court. White resigned in protest. The next president, James H. Smart, is remembered for his call in 1894 to rebuild the original Heavilon Hall &quot;one brick higher&quot; after it had been destroyed by a fire.

By the end of the nineteenth century, the university was organized into schools of agriculture, engineering (mechanical, civil, and electrical), and pharmacy; former U.S. President Benjamin Harrison served on the board of trustees. Purdue&#x27;s engineering laboratories included testing facilities for a locomotive, and for a Corliss steam engine—one of the most efficient engines of the time. Programs in education and home economics were soon established, as well as a short-lived school of medicine. By 1925, Purdue had the largest undergraduate engineering enrollment in the country, a status it would keep for half a century.
President Edward C. Elliott oversaw a campus building program between the world wars. Inventor, alumnus, and trustee David E. Ross coordinated several fundraisers, donated lands to the university, and was instrumental in establishing the Purdue Research Foundation. Ross&#x27;s gifts and fundraisers supported such projects as Ross–Ade Stadium, the Memorial Union, a civil engineering surveying camp, and Purdue University Airport. Purdue Airport was the country&#x27;s first university-owned airport and the site of the country&#x27;s first college-credit flight training courses.

Amelia Earhart joined the Purdue faculty in 1935 as a consultant for these flight courses and as a counselor on women&#x27;s careers. In 1936, the Purdue Research Foundation provided the funds for the Lockheed Electra 10-E Earhart flew on her attempted round-the-world flight.

Every school and department at the university was involved in some type of military research or training during World War II. During a project on radar receivers, Purdue physicists discovered properties of germanium that led to the making of the first transistor. The Army and the Navy conducted training programs at Purdue and more than 17,500 students, staff, and alumni served in the armed forces. Purdue set up about a hundred centers throughout Indiana to train skilled workers for defense industries. As veterans returned to the university under the G.I. Bill, first-year classes were taught at some of these sites to alleviate the demand for campus space. Four of these sites are now degree-granting regional campuses of the Purdue University system. On-campus housing became racially desegregated in 1947.

After the war, a decade-long construction program emphasized science and research. In the late 1950s and early 1960s the university established programs in veterinary medicine, industrial management, and nursing, as well as the first computer science department in the United States. Undergraduate humanities courses were strengthened, graduate-level study in these areas were slowly established. Purdue awarded its first Bachelor of Arts degrees in 1960.

The official seal of Purdue was officially inaugurated during the university&#x27;s centennial in 1969. Consisting of elements from emblems that had been used unofficially since the 1890s, the current seal depicts a griffin, symbolizing strength, and a three-part shield, representing education, research, and service.

In 1975, Purdue University joined ARPANET, an early packet-switching network that would ultimately become the foundation for the modern internet.

In recent years, Purdue&#x27;s leaders have continued to support high-tech research and international programs. In 1987, U.S. President Ronald Reagan visited the West Lafayette campus to give a speech about the influence of technological progress on job creation.

In the 1990s, the university added more opportunities to study abroad and expanded its course offerings in world languages and cultures. The first buildings of the Discovery Park interdisciplinary research center were dedicated in 2004.

On April 27, 2017, Purdue University announced plans to acquire for-profit college Kaplan University and convert it to a public university in the state of Indiana, subject to multiple levels of approval. That school now operates as Purdue University Global, and aims to serve adult learners.

On July 1, 2024, Purdue launched Purdue University in Indianapolis, an extension of the West Lafayette campus, after the formal split of Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis. It conveys Purdue West Lafayette degrees and has the same academic rigor as the flagship campus. Purdue currently has a footprint in downtown Indianapolis that includes space in the existing engineering and technology buildings, and has established partnerships with companies for facilities and shared spaces throughout the metro area.

===Integration===
Purdue had black graduates by the 1890s, and in 1905 a Black man ran for its track team. But some time in the 1910s the teams became segregated, and remained so until a student protest in 1947. Black students were not allowed to live in the residence halls until the 1940s. Black males were able to live in cooperatives, but Black females were not allowed to live anywhere in West Lafayette. In 1946, the women&#x27;s dormitories were integrated by an order of the governor of Indiana.

Helen Williams became the first Black faculty member in 1968.

==Campuses==
Purdue&#x27;s campus is situated in the small city of West Lafayette, near the western bank of the Wabash River, across which sits the larger city of Lafayette. Mitch Daniels Boulevard (formerly State Street) divides the northern and southern portions of campus. Academic buildings are mostly concentrated on the eastern and southern parts of campus, with residence halls and intramural fields to the west, and athletic facilities to the north.

===Purdue Mall===

The Purdue Mall is the central quad of Purdue University and was created to connect the academic campus with Ross-Ade Stadium. It is also known as the Engineering Mall due to its proximity to several engineering buildings. The most prominent feature of the Purdue Mall is the -tall concrete Engineering Fountain.

The Purdue Bell Tower is between the Stadium and Centennial Malls. The Bell Tower is considered an icon of the university and can be found on many Purdue logos and those of the cities of Lafayette and West Lafayette.

Southwest of the Stadium Mall is the Edward C. Elliott Hall of Music, one of the largest proscenium theaters in the world. Elliott Hall of Music serves as the home of the WBAA (AM) and WBAA-FM studios, and was the base of operations for Purdue Bands and Orchestras until the completion of the Marc and Sharon Hagle Hall in 2022.

West of the Elliott Hall of Music is the Armory Building. The Armory Building was rebuilt in 1918 after a fire and houses the university&#x27;s ROTC programs and other clubs.

===Memorial Mall===
The Purdue Memorial Mall, south of the Purdue Mall, is the original section of campus. It is a popular meeting place for students and is surrounded by other buildings used for academic and cultural purposes.

Near this section of campus is Felix Haas Hall, which was constructed in 1909 as Memorial Gymnasium in memory of the 17 Purdue University football players, coaches, alumni, and fans who died in the Purdue Wreck railroad accident of 1903. The structure was renovated in 1985 to house the computer science department. In 2006, it was renamed in honor of retired Provost Felix Haas and began to also house the Statistics department. East of the Memorial Mall is the Purdue Memorial Union, Purdue&#x27;s student union building, and the adjacent Union Club Hotel.

====University Hall====
University Hall is the only building remaining from the original six-building campus. Construction began in 1871, when the building was known as &quot;The Main Building&quot;. The building was dedicated in 1877. University Hall originally housed the office of the president, a chapel, and classrooms. At the request of John Purdue, he was buried in the Memorial Mall, directly across from the main entrance of University Hall.

===South Campus===
The area south of Mitch Daniels Boulevard is home to Purdue&#x27;s agricultural, fine arts, life sciences, and veterinary buildings. This area also includes the Krannert School of Management, Horticulture Gardens, Discovery Park, Lyles Porter Hall and the Purdue Airport.

Lyles Porter Hall houses interdisciplinary healthcare facilities and classroom space within the College of Health and Human Sciences as well as the West Lafayette branch of the Indiana University School of Medicine.

===West Campus===
The western portion of campus consists of student housing, dining, and recreation facilities. The Córdova Recreational Sports Center, built in 1957, is the first building in the nation created solely to serve university student recreational needs.

===Stadium Avenue===
Much of the northern part of campus sits on land purchased for the university by industrialist David E. Ross and author George Ade in the 1920s. Many of Purdue&#x27;s athletic facilities are there, including Ross–Ade Stadium (American football), Mackey Arena (basketball), and Lambert Fieldhouse (indoor track and field). This area also includes the Slayter Center of Performing Arts and Cary Quadrangle, one of the largest all-male housing units in the country.

==Organization and administration==

==Academics==

=== Undergraduate admissions ===
Purdue University is ranked 43rd in the annual ranking of 2024 U.S. News &amp; World Report. The 2022 annual ranking of &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; categorizes Purdue University-West Lafayette as &quot;more selective&quot;. For the Class of 2025 (enrolled fall 2021), Purdue received 59,173 applications and accepted 40,759 (68.9%). Of those accepted, 10,157 enrolled, a yield rate (the percentage of accepted students who choose to attend the university) of 24.9%. Purdue&#x27;s freshman retention rate is 92%, with 81.5% going on to graduate within six years.

The university started test-optional admissions with the Fall 2021 incoming class in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and has extended this through Fall 2023. Of the 62% of the incoming freshman class who submitted SAT scores; the middle 50 percent Composite scores were 1190–1430. Of the 31% of enrolled freshmen in 2021 who submitted ACT scores; the middle 50 percent Composite score was between 26 and 33.

Purdue University is a college-sponsor of the National Merit Scholarship Program and sponsored 88 Merit Scholarship awards in 2020. In the 2020–2021 academic year, 127 freshman students were National Merit Scholars.

===Academic divisions===

Purdue offers both undergraduate and graduate programs in over 211 major areas of study, and is well known for its competitive engineering curricula. The university has also been integral in America&#x27;s history of aviation, having established the first college credit offered in flight training; the first four-year bachelor&#x27;s degree in aviation; and the first university airport: Purdue University Airport. Purdue&#x27;s aviation technology and aeronautical engineering programs remain among the most competitive aviation-specific programs in the world. In the mid-20th century, Purdue&#x27;s aviation program expanded to encompass advanced spaceflight technology, giving rise to Purdue&#x27;s nicknames &quot;Cradle of Astronauts&quot; and &quot;Mother of Astronauts&quot;. Twenty-six Purdue graduates have become astronauts, including Gus Grissom, one of the original Mercury Seven astronauts; Neil Armstrong, who was the first person to walk on the Moon; and Eugene Cernan, who was the last person to walk on the Moon.

The English department at Purdue launched the first Online Writing Lab (OWL), in 1994. Many colleges and universities use the Purdue OWL website as an academic writing reference source for proper word usage, punctuation, grammar, and style. Professors criticized the partnership, begun in 2020, between OWL and the company Chegg, which provides AI-generated &quot;homework help&quot; that some consider to be plagiarism.

Purdue is organized into 10 colleges and schools. In 2010, the College of Health and Human Sciences was formed, through combining existing academic units, including the School of Nursing, the School of Health Sciences, the College of Consumer and Family Sciences, and non-humanities majors psychology and hearing and speech pathology from the College of Liberal Arts.

==Campus life==
===Student body===
8,562 students from 126 countries around the world attended Purdue University in 2012. In 2012–13, 19,689 out of a total of 39,256 students enrolled were Indiana residents. , the racial diversity of the US-resident undergraduate student body was 5.7% Asian, 4.4% Hispanic or Latino, and 4.0% black or African American. Of the undergraduate students, 42.6% were female. Domestic minorities constitute a total of 10.8% in the graduate student body population of which 37.3% are female. Twenty-two percent of the student body is international, representing 126 countries. In graduate and professional student population, non-Indiana residents occupy an overwhelming majority, about 75%. Almost all undergraduates and about 70% of the graduate student population attend full-time. The school&#x27;s selectivity for admissions is &quot;more selective&quot; by USNWR: approximately 49% of applicants are admitted.

===Housing===
About one-third of the single undergraduate students on the West Lafayette campus live in university-owned buildings. The rest live in fraternities, sororities, cooperatives, or private off-campus housing. School sources claim over 10,000 spaces available in seventeen separate residence halls for students on campus.


Purdue University hosts one of the nation&#x27;s largest Greek communities, with roughly 40 fraternities and 30 sororities.

===Activities and events===

Students at Purdue participate in more than 1000 student organizations that cover a variety of interests. Some of the notable clubs founded by Purdue students include the Purdue Reamer Club (a school spirit organization that cares for the Boilermaker Special mascot and raises funds for scholarships) and two clubs that eventually became nationwide organizations: the National Society of Black Engineers and the Rube Goldberg Machine Contest.

Several campus-wide programs are planned by the Purdue Alumni Student Experience (part of the Alumni Association), Purdue Student Union Board, Purdue Student Government (PSG), or the Purdue Graduate Student Government (PGSG). PSG and PGSG are made up of representatives from each of the university&#x27;s academic colleges and give recommendations to the faculty, administration, and sometimes to the state legislature.

Annual campus events include Boiler Gold Rush, Purdue University Dance Marathon, Spring Fest, and Grand Prix. Boiler Gold Rush (BGR) is Purdue&#x27;s a student orientation program and a sports pep rally. Purdue University Dance Marathon (PUDM) is an 18-hour no-sitting, no-sleeping, dance marathon; over 2,000 students participate and the event raises over $1 million annually for Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis. Spring Fest is an annual carnival with entertaining exhibits from many academic departments. A highlight of the weekend is the Entomology Department&#x27;s Bug Bowl, where the sport of cricket spitting was invented in 1997. The Purdue Grand Prix, a 50-mile, 160-lap go-kart race ends Gala Week each year. All 33 participating karts are made from scratch by student teams. The event has been raising money for student scholarships since it began in 1958.

===Religious life===
Purdue has a number of religious organizations on and near the campus. St. Thomas Aquinas Catholic Church serves the Catholic community at Purdue and the surrounding community. There is also a non-denominational Christian church, Campus House, which is affiliated with the popular coffee-shop Greyhouse Coffee. The Purdue Hillel Foundation and Chabad at Purdue are the university&#x27;s Jewish campus organizations. The Islamic Society of Greater Lafayette has an Islamic center serving the needs of the Muslim community on campus.

==Media==
The &quot;Purdue Exponent&quot;, an independent student newspaper, has the largest circulation of any Indiana college newspaper, with a daily circulation of 17,500 copies during the spring and fall semesters. From 1889 to 2008 Purdue published a yearbook called the &quot;Debris&quot;.

WBAA are radio station operations owned by and licensed to Metropolitan Indianapolis Public Media, with studios at the university, featuring three noncommercial stations: WBAA News, WBAA Classical, and WBAA Jazz. The stations can be heard on AM 920, 101.3 FM, and 105.9 FM. WBAA also broadcasts on HD Radio and digital platforms including wbaa.org and the WBAA app. Its studios are in the Edward C. Elliott Hall of Music on the Purdue campus, and the transmitters are in Lafayette, Indiana. WBAA is the longest continuously operating radio station in Indiana, having been licensed on April 4, 1922. WBAA is a NPR member station. Despite some public disapproval, in 2022, Purdue sold WBAA (AM) and WBAA-FM to WFYI-FM. Purdue received $700,000 in underwriting credit while agreeing to provide an investment of $250,000 annually for two years to WFYI to offset initial operating costs.

There are also a few campus radio stations on campus. Currently, three radio stations operate from residence halls, broadcasting via internet only; WCCR from Cary Quadrangle (not to be confused with the current WCCR FM or WCCR-LP stations in other states), WILY from Wiley Hall, and WHHR from Harrison Hall.

W9YB is the callsign of the Amateur Radio Club at Purdue University. W9YB is the longest standing club on campus and also holds the self-declared title of having one of the largest and most active collegiate amateur radio stations in the country. W9YB actively participates in emergency management for the Tippecanoe County area and maintains ready status with its members in skills to assist. W9YB is among the longest standing amateur radio clubs in the United States, with the current callsign dating back to 1932 and the previous callsign 9YB dating back to 1920.

The &quot;Movie Tribute Show&quot; was created in a small television studio (now known as the Erik Mygrant Studio) on campus in 1999.

==Athletics==

On October 26, 1891, a newspaper in Crawfordsville, Indiana called Purdue&#x27;s football team the &quot;Boiler Makers&quot; when writing about their trouncing of Wabash College. Lafayette newspapers soon picked up the name, and in October 1892, &quot;The Purdue Exponent&quot;, Purdue&#x27;s student newspaper, gave it the stamp of approval. In the early days of Purdue football, the team was called other names as well, including &quot;haymakers&quot;, &quot;railsplitters&quot;, &quot;sluggers&quot;, and &quot;cornfield sailors&quot;. This heritage is reflected in Purdue&#x27;s official mascot: the Boilermaker Special (a truck-like vehicle that resembles a locomotive) and the athletic mascot Purdue Pete (a muscular hammer-wielding boilermaker). The school colors of old gold and black were selected by Purdue&#x27;s first football team in 1887 to resemble the orange and black of Princeton&#x27;s then-successful team. This made Purdue football the first sports team to ever use a black and gold color palette. The best known fight song is &quot;Hail Purdue!&quot;.

Purdue has one of the few college athletic programs not funded by student fees or subsidized by the university. It is home to 18 Division I/I-A NCAA teams including football, basketball, cross country, tennis, wrestling, golf, volleyball, ice hockey (ACHA), and others. Purdue is a founding member of the Big Ten Conference, and played a central role in its creation. Traditional rivals include Big Ten colleagues the Indiana Hoosiers (see Indiana–Purdue rivalry), the Illinois Fighting Illini, and the Notre Dame Fighting Irish from the Atlantic Coast Conference (football program independent, however).

Purdue&#x27;s baseball facility was named in honor of two alumni, Anna Margaret Ross Alexander and her husband, John Arthur Alexander, when the new stadium was dedicated in 2013.

===Football===

The Boilermaker football team represents Purdue University in the NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS). Purdue plays its home games at Ross-Ade Stadium on the university&#x27;s campus. The Boilermakers compete in the Big Ten Conference as a member of the West Division.

Found on a farm in southern Indiana, the Old Oaken Bucket is one of the oldest American football trophies. The winner of Purdue&#x27;s annual game against the Indiana University Hoosiers gets to keep the trophy until the next face-off and add a bronze &quot;P&quot; or &quot;I&quot; link to its chain. The first competition in 1925 led to a 0–0 tie, resulting in the first link on the chain being an &quot;IP.&quot; , Purdue led the series 77–42–6.

During &quot;Breakfast Club&quot;, best described as a cross between a pep rally and a Halloween party, students and even some alumni dress up in costumes, from traditional Halloween garb to creative hand-made costumes, as they bar-hop before Boilermaker home football games. The Breakfast Club plays a significant role during the football season and is informally a part of Purdue tradition. Many Boilermaker fans are dedicated; getting up at 5:00 a.m. on Saturdays and lining up at the bars on Chauncey Hill and the levee by 6:00 a.m. on game days. The Breakfast Club tradition began in the 1980s during the annual Purdue Grand Prix race in April. Another tradition is Saturday morning wake-ups, where the Boilermaker Special uses its many loud horns and whistles to wake dorm students up in preparation for the day&#x27;s game.

===Basketball===
The Purdue Boilermakers men&#x27;s basketball team competes in NCAA Division I and is a member of the Big Ten Conference. Purdue won its 25th Big Ten Conference Championship and 2nd Big Ten Tournament Championship in 2023. This leads the conference, as Indiana University Bloomington is second with 22 conference championships. The Boilermakers were retroactively designated the 1932 national champions by the Helms Athletic Foundation and the Premo-Porretta Power Poll, but have not won an NCAA Championship: they were the 1969 runner-up, falling to legendary coach and former Purdue player John Wooden-led UCLA in the national championship game, the 1980 third-place finisher, falling to UCLA in the semifinals of the Final Four but defeating Iowa in the consolation game, and the 2024 runner-up, falling to Connecticut in the national championship game. The Purdue men&#x27;s team has sent more than 30 players to the NBA including two overall No. 1 picks in the NBA draft. The Purdue women&#x27;s basketball team were the 1999 NCAA Champions and 2001 runners-up. The Boilermakers men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams have won more Big Ten Championships than any other conference school, with 32 regular-season conference titles and 11 Big Ten Tournament titles. Purdue men&#x27;s basketball achieved an all-time winning record against all Big Ten Schools when it gained a winning record over Ohio State with three wins in 2023, improving that record from 91–92 to 94–92.

<doc id="23758" wikidata="Q312816" url="?curid=23758" title="Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite">
<text>Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite (or Dionysius the Pseudo-Areopagite) was a Greek author, Christian theologian and Neoplatonic philosopher of the late 5th to early 6th century, who wrote a set of works known as the &quot;Corpus Areopagiticum&quot; or &quot;Corpus Dionysiacum&quot;. Through his writing in &quot;Mystical Theology&quot;, he has been identified as the &quot;progenitor of apophatic or negative theology.&quot;

The author pseudepigraphically identifies himself in the corpus as &quot;Dionysios&quot;, portraying himself as Dionysius the Areopagite, the Athenian convert of Paul the Apostle mentioned in Acts 17:34. 

==Historic confusions==
In the early sixth century, a series of writings of a mystical nature, employing Neoplatonic language to elucidate Christian theological and mystical ideas, was ascribed to the Areopagite. They have long been recognized as pseudepigrapha, and their author is now called &quot;Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite&quot;.

==Corpus==

===Works===
The surviving corpus comprises: 
* &quot;Divine Names&quot; (&quot;&quot;);
* &quot;Celestial Hierarchy&quot; (&quot;)&quot;;
* &quot;Ecclesiastical Hierarchy&quot; (&quot;&quot;);
* &quot;Mystical Theology&quot; (&quot;&quot;), &quot;a brief but powerful work that deals with negative or apophatic theology and in which theology becomes explicitly &#x27;mystical&#x27; for the first time in history&quot;;
* Ten epistles.

Seven other works are mentioned repeatedly by pseudo-Dionysius in his surviving works, and are presumed either to be lost or to be fictional works mentioned by the Areopagite as a literary device to give the impression to his sixth-century readers of engaging with the surviving fragments of a much larger first-century corpus of writings. These seven other works are:
* &quot;Theological Outlines&quot; (&quot;&quot;),
* &quot;Symbolic Theology&quot; (&quot;&quot;),
* &quot;On Angelic Properties and Orders&quot; (&quot;&quot;),
* &quot;On the Just and Divine Judgement&quot; (&quot;&quot;),
* &quot;On the Soul&quot; (&quot;&quot;),
* &quot;On Intelligible and Sensible Beings,&quot;
* &quot;On the Divine Hymns&quot;.

===Dating===
* In the &quot;Ecclesiastical Hierarchy&quot; Dionysius twice seems to allude to the recitation of the Creed in the course of the liturgy (&quot;EH&quot; 3.2 and 3.III.7). It is often asserted that Peter the Fuller first mandated the inclusion of the Nicene Creed in the liturgy in 476, thus providing an earliest date for the composition of the Corpus. Bernard Capelle argues that it is far more likely that Timothy, patriarch of Constantinople, was responsible for this liturgical innovation, around 515—thus suggesting a later date for the Corpus.
* It is often suggested that because Dionysius seems to eschew divisive Christological language, he was probably writing after the &quot;Henoticon&quot; of Zeno was in effect, sometime after 482. It is also possible that Dionysius eschewed traditional Christological formulae in order to preserve an overall apostolic ambience for his works, rather than because of the influence of the &quot;Henoticon&quot;. Also, given that the &quot;Henoticon&quot; was rescinded in 518, if Dionysius was writing after this date, he may have been untroubled by this policy.
In terms of the latest date for the composition of the &quot;Corpus&quot;, the earliest datable reference to Dionysius&#x27; writing comes in 528, the year in which the treatise of Severus of Antioch entitled &quot;Adversus apologiam Juliani&quot; was translated into Syriac—though it is possible the treatise may originally have been composed up to nine years earlier.

Another widely cited latest date for Dionysius&#x27; writing comes in 532, when, in a report on a colloquy held between two groups (dyophysite and miaphysite) debating the decrees of the Council of Chalcedon, Severus of Antioch and his miaphysite supporters cited Dionysius&#x27; Fourth Letter in defence of their view. It is possible that pseudo-Dionysius was himself a member of this group, though debate continues over whether his writings do in fact reveal a miaphysite understanding of Christ. It seems likely that the writer was located in Syria, as revealed, for example, by the accounts of the sacramental rites he gives in &quot;The Ecclesiastical Hierarchy&quot;, which seem only to bear resemblance to Syriac rites.

===Authorship===
The author pseudonymously identifies himself in the corpus as &quot;Dionysios&quot;, portraying himself as the figure of Dionysius the Areopagite, the Athenian convert of Paul the Apostle mentioned in Acts 17:34.

Various legends existed surrounding the figure of Dionysius, who became emblematic of the spread of the gospel to the Greek world. A tradition quickly arose that he became the first bishop of Cyprus or of Milan, or that he was the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews; according to Eusebius, he was also said to be the first bishop of Athens. It is therefore not surprising that that author of these works would have chosen to adopt the name of this otherwise briefly mentioned figure.

The authorship of the Dionysian Corpus was initially disputed; Severus and his party affirmed its apostolic dating, largely because it seemed to agree with their Christology. This dating was disputed by Hypatius of Ephesus, who met the monophysite party during the 532 meeting with Emperor Justinian I; Hypatius denied its authenticity on the ground that none of the Fathers or Councils ever cited or referred to it. Hypatius condemned it along with the Apollinarian texts, distributed during the Nestorian controversy under the names of Pope Julius and Athanasius, which the monophysites entered as evidence supporting their position.

The first defense of its authenticity is undertaken by John of Scythopolis, whose commentary, the &quot;Scholia&quot; (), on the Dionysian Corpus constitutes the first defense of its apostolic dating, wherein he specifically argues that the work is neither Apollinarian nor a forgery, probably in response both to monophysites and Hypatius—although even he, given his unattributed citations of Plotinus in interpreting Dionysius, might have known better. Dionysius&#x27; authenticity is criticized later in the century, and defended by Theodore of Raithu; and by the 7th century, it is taken as demonstrated, affirmed by both Maximus the Confessor and the Lateran Council of 649. From that point until the Renaissance, the authorship was less questioned, though Thomas Aquinas, Peter Abelard and Nicholas of Cusa expressed suspicions about its authenticity; their concerns were generally ignored.

The Florentine humanist Lorenzo Valla (d. 1457), in his 1457 commentaries on the New Testament, did much to establish that the author of the &quot;Corpus Areopagiticum&quot; could not have been St. Paul&#x27;s convert, though he was unable to identify the actual historical author. William Grocyn pursued Valla&#x27;s lines of textual criticism, and Valla&#x27;s critical viewpoint of the authorship of the highly influential &quot;Corpus&quot; was accepted and publicized by Erasmus from 1504 onward, for which he was criticized by Catholic theologians. In the Leipzig disputation with Martin Luther, in 1519, Johann Eck used the &quot;Corpus&quot;, specifically the &quot;Angelic Hierarchy&quot;, as argument for the apostolic origin of papal supremacy, pressing the Platonist analogy, &quot;as above, so below&quot;.

During the 19th century Catholic historians too came generally to accept that the author must have lived after the time of Proclus. The author became known as &#x27;Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite&#x27; only after the philological work of J. Stiglmayr and H. Koch, whose papers, published independently in 1895, demonstrated the thoroughgoing dependence of the &quot;Corpus&quot; upon Proclus. Both showed that Dionysius had used, in his treatise on evil in Chapter 4 of &quot;The Divine Names&quot;, the &quot;De malorum subsistentia&quot; of Proclus.

Dionysius&#x27; identity is still disputed. Corrigan and Harrington find pseudo-Dionysius to be most probably...
 Ronald Hathaway provides a table listing most of the major identifications of Dionysius: e.g., Ammonius Saccas, Pope Dionysius of Alexandria, Peter the Fuller, Dionysius the Scholastic, Severus of Antioch, Sergius of Reshaina, unnamed Christian followers of everyone from Origen to Basil of Caesarea, Eutyches to Proclus.

In the past half-century, Alexander Golitzin, Georgian academician Shalva Nutsubidze and Belgian professor Ernest Honigmann have all proposed identifying pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite with Peter the Iberian. A more recent identification is with Damascius, the last scholarch of the Neoplatonic Academy of Athens. There is therefore no current scholarly consensus on the question of pseudo-Dionysius&#x27; identification.

The &quot;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot; claims:
 Others scholars such as Bart D. Ehrman disagree, see for example &quot;Forged&quot;. While pseudo-Dionysius can be seen as a communicator of tradition, he can also be seen as a polemicist, who tried to alter Neo-Platonic tradition in a novel way for the Christian world that would make notions of complicated Divine Hierarchies more of an emphasis than notions of direct relationship with the figure of Christ as Mediator.

A minority of scholars, including Romanian theologian Dumitru Staniloae, argue in favor of the Dionysian corpus being authentic, citing internal historical details and the existence of explicit citations of Dionysius predating Proclus by writers such as Dionysius of Alexandria and Gregory Nazianzus. Even Proclus himself appears to cite an external authority for a euphemism (&quot;flowers and supersubstantial lights&quot;) when the said verbiage is found explicitly in the Corpus Dionysiacum.

==Thought==
Dionysius attributed his inspiration to pseudo-Hierotheus, professing that he was writing to popularize the teachings of his master. Pseudo-Hierotheus was the author of &quot;The book of Hierotheus on the hidden mysteries of the house of God.&quot; Pseudo-Hierotheus is believed to be the fifth century Syrian monk Stephen Bar Sudhaile, a pantheistic writer.

The works of Dionysius are mystical, and show strong Neoplatonic influence. For example, he uses Plotinus&#x27; well-known analogy of a sculptor cutting away that which does not enhance the desired image, and shows familiarity with Proclus. He also shows influence from Clement of Alexandria, the Cappadocian Fathers, Origen, and others.

===&quot;Mystical Theology&quot;===
According to pseudo-Dionysius, God is better characterized and approached by negations than by affirmations. All names and theological representations must be negated. According to pseudo-Dionysius, when all names are negated, &quot;divine silence, darkness, and unknowing&quot; will follow.

==Influence==

===Eastern Christianity===
His thought was initially used by Miaphysites to back up parts of their arguments but his writings were eventually adopted by other church theologians, primarily due to the work of John of Scythopolis and Maximus the Confessor in producing an orthodox interpretation. Writing a single generation at most after Dionysius, perhaps between 537 and 543, John of Scythopolis composed an extensive set () of &quot;scholia&quot; (that is, marginal annotations) to the works of Dionysius.

These were in turn prefaced by a long prologue in which John set out his reasons for commenting on the corpus. All Greek manuscripts of the &quot;Corpus Areopagiticum &quot;surviving today stem from an early sixth-century manuscript containing John&#x27;s &quot;Scholia &quot;and &quot;Prologue&quot; — so John of Scythopolis had an enormous influence on how Dionysius was read in the Greek-speaking world.

Theologians such as John of Damascus and Germanus I of Constantinople also made ample use of Dionysius&#x27; writing.

The Dionysian writings and their mystical teaching were universally accepted throughout the East, amongst both Chalcedonians and non-Chalcedonians. Gregory Palamas, for example, in referring to these writings, calls the author, &quot;an unerring beholder of divine things&quot;.

The Corpus is also present in Syriac and Armenian versions, the former of which, by Sergius of Reshaina in the early sixth century, serves as a &quot;terminus ante quem&quot; for the dating of the original Greek.

===Latin Christianity===

The first notice of Dionysius in the West comes from Pope Gregory I, who probably brought a codex of the &quot;Corpus Areopagitum&quot; back with him on his return from his mission as papal legate to the Emperor in Constantinople in . Gregory refers occasionally in his writings to Dionysius, although Gregory&#x27;s Greek was probably not adequate to fully engage with Dionysius&#x27;s work. In the seventh and eighth centuries, Dionysius was not widely known in the West, aside from a few scattered references.

The real influence of Dionysius in the West began with the gift in 827 of a Greek copy of his works by the Byzantine emperor Michael II to the Carolingian emperor Louis the Pious. King Louis in turn gave the manuscript to the Abbey of St. Denis near Paris where, in about 838, Dionysius&#x27; works were translated into Latin for the first time by Hilduin, abbot of the monastery. It may well have been Hilduin himself who promoted his work (and his abbey) by developing the legend (which would be widely accepted during subsequent centuries), that Denis was the same person as Dionysius the Areopagite of Acts 17.34, and that he had traveled to Rome and then was commissioned by the Pope to preach in Gaul, where he was martyred. Hilduin&#x27;s translation is almost unintelligible.

About twenty years later, a subsequent Carolingian Emperor, Charles the Bald, requested the Irishman John Scotus Eriugena to make a fresh translation. He finished this in 862. This translation itself did not widely circulate in subsequent centuries. Moreover, although Eriugena&#x27;s own works, such as the &quot;Homily on the Prologue of St John&quot;, show the influence of Dionysian ideas, these works were not widely copied or read in subsequent centuries. The Benedictine monasticism that formed the standard monasticism of the eighth to eleventh centuries, therefore, in general paid little attention to Dionysius.

In the twelfth century, greater use gradually began to be made of Dionysius among various traditions of thought:
* Among Benedictines (especially at the Abbey of Saint-Denis), greater interest began to be shown in Dionysius. For example, one of the monks of Saint Denys, John Sarrazin, wrote a commentary on &quot;The Celestial Hierarchy&quot; in 1140, and then in 1165 made a translation of the work. Also, Suger, abbot of Saint-Denis from 1122 to 1151, drew on Dionysian themes to explain how the architecture of his new &#x27;Gothic&#x27; abbey church helped raise the soul to God.
* Among the Canons Regular. Hugh of Saint Victor edited two commentaries on &quot;The Celestial Hierarchy&quot; between 1125 and 1137, later revising and combining them as one. Richard of Saint Victor was familiar with Dionysius through Hugh. Through Hugh, others became exposed to Dionysian thought, including Thomas Gallus and Gilbert de la Porrée.
* In the Cistercian tradition, it seems that early writers such as Bernard of Clairvaux, William of St Thierry and Aelred of Rievaulx were not influenced by Dionysian thought. Among second-generation Cistercians, Isaac of Stella clearly shows the influence of Dionysian ideas.
* It is in the Schools, though, that the twelfth-century growth in influence of Dionysius was truly significant. There are few references to Dionysius in scholastic theology during the tenth and eleventh centuries. At the beginning of the twelfth century, though, the masters of the Cathedral school at Laon, especially Anselm of Laon, introduced extracts from John Scotus Eriugena&#x27;s &quot;Commentary on St John&quot; into the &quot;Sentences&quot; and the &quot;Glossa Ordinaria&quot;. In this manner, Dionysian concepts found their way into the writing of Peter Lombard and others.
* Bonaventure uses images and even direct quotations from Dionysius&#x27; &quot;Mystical Theology&quot; in the last chapter of his famous work &quot;Itinerarium Mentis in Deum&quot; (The Soul&#x27;s Journey into God).

During the thirteenth century, the Franciscan Robert Grosseteste made an important contribution by bringing out between 1240 and 1243 a translation, with commentary, of the Dionysian corpus. Soon after, the Dominican Albertus Magnus did likewise. The thirteenth-century Parisian corpus provided an important reference point by combining the &quot;Old Translation&quot; of John Scotus Eriugena with the &quot;New Translation&quot; of John Sarrazin, along with glosses and scholia by Maximus the Confessor, John of Scythopolis and others, as well as the &quot;Extracts&quot; by Thomas Gallus, and several commentaries such as John Scotus Eriugena, John Sarrazin and Hugh of Saint Victor on &quot;The Celestial Hierarchy&quot;. It quickly became common to make reference to Dionysius. Thomas Aquinas wrote an explanation for several works, and cites him over 1700 times. Bonaventure called him the &quot;prince of mystics&quot;.

It was subsequently in the area of mysticism that Dionysius, especially his portrayal of the &quot;via negativa&quot;, was particularly influential. In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries his fundamental themes were hugely influential on thinkers such as Marguerite Porete, Meister Eckhart, Johannes Tauler, John of Ruusbroec, the author of &quot;The Cloud of Unknowing&quot; (who made an expanded Middle English translation of Dionysius&#x27; &quot;Mystical Theology&quot;), Jean Gerson, Nicholas of Cusa, Denis the Carthusian, Julian of Norwich, Hendrik Herp and Catherine of Genoa [&quot;The Mystical Element of Religion as Studied in Saint Catherine of Genoa and Her Friends (1908)]. His influence can also be traced in the Spanish Carmelite thought of the sixteenth century among Teresa of Ávila and John of the Cross.

==Modern appraisal==
In recent decades, interest has increased again in the &quot;Corpus Areopagiticum&quot;, for three main reasons: because of a recovery of the huge impact of Dionysian thought in later Christian thought, because of an increasing repudiation of older criticisms that Dionysius&#x27;s thought represented a fundamentally Neoplatonic approach to theology, and finally because of interest in parallels between aspects of modern linguistic theory and Dionysius&#x27;s reflections on language and negative theology.

Andrew Louth offers the following modern appraisal of the Areopagite;

<text>Crystalline materials (mainly metals and alloys, but also stoichiometric salts and other materials) are made up of solid regions of ordered matter (atoms placed in one of a number of ordered formations called Bravais lattices). These regions are known as &quot;crystals&quot;. A perfect crystal is a crystal that contains no point, line, or planar defects. There are a wide variety of crystallographic defects.

The hypothetical concept of a perfect crystal is important in the basic formulation of the third law of thermodynamics.

In crystallography, the phrase &#x27;perfect crystal&#x27; can be used to mean &quot;no linear or planar imperfections&quot;, as it is difficult to measure small quantities of point imperfections in an otherwise defect-free crystal.

Imperfections are created by various thermodynamic processes.

<doc id="23761" wikidata="Q47144" url="?curid=23761" title="Pope Linus">
<text>Pope Linus (; , &quot;Linos&quot;; died AD 80) was the bishop of Rome from AD 68 to his death. He is generally regarded as the second Bishop of Rome, after St. Peter. As with all the early popes, he was canonized.

According to Irenaeus, Linus is the same person as the one mentioned in the New Testament. Linus is mentioned in the valediction of the &quot;Second Epistle to Timothy (2 Timothy 4:21)&quot; as being with Paul the Apostle in Rome near the end of Paul&#x27;s life.

== Background ==
The earliest witness to the episcopate of Linus was Irenaeus, who in AD 180 wrote that &quot;the blessed apostles, then, having founded and built up the Church, committed into the hands of Linus the office of the episcopate&quot;.

According to the earliest succession lists of bishops of Rome, passed down by Irenaeus and Hegesippus and attested by the historian Eusebius, Linus was entrusted with his office by the apostles Peter and Paul after they had established the Christian church in Rome. By this reckoning he might be considered therefore the first pope, but from the late 2nd or early 3rd century the convention began of regarding Peter as the first pope.

Jerome described Linus as &quot;the first after Peter to be in charge of the Roman Church&quot; and Eusebius described him as &quot;the first to receive the episcopate of the church at Rome, after the martyrdom of Paul and Peter&quot;. John Chrysostom wrote that &quot;this Linus, some say, was second bishop of the Church of Rome after Peter&quot;, while the &quot;Liberian Catalogue&quot; described Peter as the first bishop of Rome and Linus as his successor in the same office.

The &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot; also enumerated Linus as the second bishop of Rome after Peter, and stated that Peter consecrated two bishops, Linus and Anacletus, for the priestly service of the community, while devoting himself instead to prayer and preaching, and that it was Clement I to whom he entrusted the universal Church and whom he appointed as his successor. Tertullian also wrote of Clement as the successor of Peter. Jerome named Clement as &quot;the fourth bishop of Rome after Peter, if indeed the second was Linus and the third Anacletus, although most of the Latins think that Clement was second after the apostle&quot;.

The &quot;Apostolic Constitutions&quot; note that Linus, whom Paul the Apostle consecrated, was the first bishop of Rome and that he was succeeded by Clement I, whom Peter the Apostle ordained and consecrated.

== Episcopate ==
The chronology of the early popes is heavily disputed. Eusebius and Jerome dated Linus&#x27; episcopate between the years AD 68 and 80. The &quot;Liberian Catalogue&quot; and the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot; date it as AD 56 to 67, during the reign of Nero. This is most likely a mistake, as all four sources give Peter an episcopate of 25 years in Rome, and the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot; even records that Peter died 38 years after Jesus&#x27; death, that is, AD 67–68. The &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; gives his years as 64–76 or 67–79.

Linus is named in the valediction of the Second Epistle to Timothy. In that epistle, Linus is noted as being with Paul the Apostle in Rome near the end of Paul&#x27;s life. Irenaeus stated that this is the same Linus who became Bishop of Rome.

According to the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;, Linus was an Italian born in Volterra in Tuscany. His father&#x27;s name was recorded as Herculanus. The &quot;Apostolic Constitutions&quot; denominated his mother Claudia; immediately after the name Linus in 2 &quot;Timothy&quot; 4:21 a Claudia is named, but the Bible does not explicitly identify Claudia as Linus&#x27; mother. According to the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;, Linus decreed that women should cover their heads in church, created the first 15 bishops, and died a martyr. It dated his burial as 23 September, on which date he is still commemorated. His name is included in the Roman Canon of the Mass.

With respect to Linus&#x27; purported decree prescribing the covering of women&#x27;s heads, J.P. Kirsch commented in the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; that &quot;without doubt this decree is apocryphal, and copied by the author of the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot; from Paul&#x27;s &quot;First Epistle to the Corinthians&quot; (11:5) and arbitrarily attributed to the first successor of the Apostle in Rome. The statement made in the same source, that Linus suffered martyrdom, cannot be proved and is improbable. For between Nero and Domitian there is no mention of any persecution of the Roman Church; and Irenaeus (1. c., III, iv, 3) from among the early Roman bishops designates only Telesphorus as a glorious martyr.&quot; The &quot;Roman Martyrology&quot; does not categorize Linus as a martyr as does the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;; the current entry in the former regarding him states: &quot;At Rome, the commemoration of Saint Linus, Pope, to whom, as Saint Irenaeus narrates, the blessed Apostles entrusted the responsibility of the episcopate of the Church founded in the City, and whom the blessed Paul the Apostle mentions as a companion of his.&quot;

==Legacy==
A tomb that Torrigio discovered in Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica in 1615 and which was inscribed with the letters LINVS was assumed to be the tomb of Pope Linus. However, a note by Torrigio records that these were merely the final five letters of some unknown longer name, such as &quot;Aquilinus&quot; or &quot;Anullinus&quot;. A letter on the martyrdom of Peter and Paul was attributed to Linus, but in fact it was determined to date to the 6th century. The &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot; asserts that Linus was buried on the Vatican Hill adjacent to Peter the Apostle in what is now known as the Vatican Necropolis beneath Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Vatican City.

The city of Saint-Lin-Laurentides in Canada is named in his honour.

<doc id="23763" wikidata="Q1644573" url="?curid=23763" title="Pilgrimage">
<text>A pilgrimage is a journey to a holy place, which can lead to a personal transformation, after which the pilgrim returns to their daily life. A pilgrim (from the Latin &quot;peregrinus&quot;) is a traveler (literally one who has come from afar) who is on a journey to a holy place. Typically, this is a physical journey (often on foot) to some place of special significance to the adherent of a particular religious belief system.

== Background ==

Pilgrimages frequently involve a journey or search of moral or spiritual significance. Typically, it is a journey to a shrine or other location of importance to a person&#x27;s beliefs and faith, although sometimes it can be a metaphorical journey into someone&#x27;s own beliefs.

Many religions attach spiritual importance to particular places: the place of birth or death of founders or saints, or to the place of their &quot;calling&quot; or spiritual awakening, or of their connection (visual or verbal) with the divine, to locations where miracles were performed or witnessed, or locations where a deity is said to live or be &quot;housed&quot;, or any site that is seen to have special spiritual powers. Such sites may be commemorated with shrines or temples that devotees are encouraged to visit for their own spiritual benefit: to be healed or have questions answered or to achieve some other spiritual benefit.

A person who makes such a journey is called a pilgrim. As a common human experience, pilgrimage has been proposed as a Jungian archetype by Wallace Clift and Jean Dalby Clift. Some research has shown that people who engage in pilgrimage walks enjoy biological, psychological, social, and spiritual therapeutic benefits.

The Holy Land acts as a focal point for the pilgrimages of the Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. According to a Stockholm University study in 2011, these pilgrims visit the Holy Land to touch and see physical manifestations of their faith, confirm their beliefs in the holy context with collective excitation, and connect personally to the Holy Land.

==History==

Pilgrims and the making of pilgrimages are common in many religions, including the faiths of ancient Egypt, Persia in the Mithraic period, India, China, and Japan. The Greek and Roman customs of consulting the gods at local oracles, such as those at Dodona or Delphi, both in Greece, are widely known. In Greece, pilgrimages could either be personal or state-sponsored. The Eleusinian mysteries included a pilgrimage. The procession to Eleusis began at the Athenian cemetery Kerameikos and from there the participants walked to Eleusis, along the Sacred Way (Ἱερὰ Ὁδός, &quot;Hierá Hodós&quot;).

In the early period of Hebrew history, pilgrims traveled to Shiloh, Dan, Bethel, and eventually Jerusalem (see also Three Pilgrimage Festivals, a practice followed by other Abrahamic religions). These festivals, including Passover, Tabernacles, and Shavout, often involved journeys that reflected a physical and spiritual movement, similar to the concept of &quot;tirtha yātrā&quot; in Hinduism, where &quot;tirtha&quot; means &quot;ford&quot; or &quot;crossing,&quot; and &quot;yatra&quot; signifies a journey or procession. While many pilgrims travel toward a specific location, a physical destination is not always a necessity. One group of pilgrims in early Celtic Christianity were the &quot;Peregrinari Pro Christ&quot;, (Pilgrims for Christ), or &quot;white martyrs&quot;, who left their homes to wander in the world. This form of pilgrimage, akin to the concept of &quot;hajj&quot; in Islam, which means &quot;procession,&quot; was an ascetic religious practice, as the pilgrim left the security of home and the clan for an unknown destination, trusting completely in Divine Providence. These travels often resulted in the founding of new abbeys and the spread of Christianity among the pagan population in Britain and in continental Europe.

The ceremonial center Chavín de Huántar served as a gathering place for people of the pre-Inca culture Chavín to come together, to attend and participate in rituals, consult an oracle, worship or enter a cult, and collect ideas. 

==Bahá&#x27;í Faith==

Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh decreed pilgrimage to two places in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas: the House of Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh in Baghdad, Iraq, and the House of the Báb in Shiraz, Iran. Later, ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá designated the Shrine of Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh at Bahji, Israel as a site of pilgrimage. The designated sites for pilgrimage are currently not accessible to the majority of Bahá&#x27;ís, as they are in Iraq and Iran respectively, and thus when Bahá&#x27;ís currently refer to pilgrimage, it refers to a nine-day pilgrimage which consists of visiting the holy places at the Bahá&#x27;í World Centre in northwest Israel in Haifa, Acre, and Bahjí.

==Buddhism==
Places of pilgrimage in the Buddhist world include those associated with the life of the historical Buddha: his supposed birthplace and childhood home (Lumbini and Kapilavastu in Nepal) and place of enlightenment (Bodh Gaya in northern India), other places he is believed to have visited and the place of his death (or Parinirvana), Kushinagar, India. Others include the many temples and monasteries with relics of the Buddha or Buddhist saints such as the Temple of the Tooth in Sri Lanka and the numerous sites associated with teachers and patriarchs of the various traditions.

In India and Nepal, there are four places of pilgrimage which are tied to the life of Gautama Buddha:
* Lumbini: Buddha&#x27;s birthplace (in Nepal)
* Bodh Gaya: place of Enlightenment (in the current Mahabodhi Temple, Bihar, India)
* Sarnath: (formally Isipathana, Uttar pradesh, India) where he delivered his first sermon (Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta), and the Buddha taught about the Middle Way, the Four Noble Truths and Noble Eightfold Path
* Kusinara: (now Kusinagar, India) where he attained &quot;mahaparinirvana&quot; (died)

Other pilgrimage places in India and Nepal connected Gautama Buddha&#x27;s life are: Savatthi, Pataliputta, Nalanda, Gaya, Vesali, Sankasia, Kapilavastu, Kosambi, Rajagaha.

==Christianity==


In the spiritual literature of Christianity, the concept of pilgrim and pilgrimage may refer to the experience of life in the world (considered as a period of exile) or to the inner path of the spiritual aspirant from a state of wretchedness to a state of beatitude.

Christian pilgrimage was first made to sites connected with the birth, life, crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus. Aside from the early example of Origen in the third century, surviving descriptions of Christian pilgrimages to the Holy Land date from the 4th century, when pilgrimage was encouraged by church fathers including Saint Jerome, and established by Saint Helena, the mother of Constantine the Great.

Beginning in 1894, Christian ministers under the direction of Charles Taze Russell were appointed to travel to and work with local Bible Students congregations for a few days at a time; within a few years appointments were extended internationally, formally designated as &quot;pilgrims&quot;, and scheduled for twice-yearly, week-long visits at each local congregation. International Bible Students Association (IBSA) pilgrims were excellent speakers, and their local talks were typically well-publicized and well-attended. Prominent Bible Students A. H. Macmillan and J. F. Rutherford were both appointed pilgrims before they joined the board of directors of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania; the IBSA later adopted the name Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses and renamed pilgrims as &quot;traveling overseers&quot;.

The purpose of Christian pilgrimage was summarized by Pope Benedict XVI in this way:

Pilgrimages were, and are, also made to Rome and other sites associated with the apostles, saints and Christian martyrs, as well as to places where there have been apparitions of the Virgin Mary. A popular pilgrimage journey is along the Way of St. James to the Santiago de Compostela Cathedral, in Galicia, Spain, where the shrine of the apostle James is located. A combined pilgrimage was held every seven years in the three nearby towns of Maastricht, Aachen and Kornelimünster where many important relics could be seen (see: Pilgrimage of the Relics, Maastricht). Marian pilgrimages remain very popular in Latin America.

The Catholic priest Frank Fahey writes that a pilgrim is &quot;always in danger of becoming a tourist&quot; and vice versa, and describes pilgrimages as journeys containing &quot;faith expectancy&quot;, a search for wholeness, that are often solitary and employing silence to create an internal sacred space.

==Hinduism==

According to Karel Werner&#x27;s &quot;Popular Dictionary of Hinduism&quot;, &quot;most Hindu places of pilgrimage are associated with legendary events from the lives of various gods... Almost any place can become a focus for pilgrimage, but in most cases they are sacred cities, rivers, lakes, and mountains.&quot; Hindus are encouraged to undertake pilgrimages during their lifetime, though this practice is not considered absolutely mandatory. Most Hindus visit sites within their region or locale. 
* Kumbh Mela: Kumbh Mela is one of the largest gatherings of humans in the world where pilgrims gather to bathe in a sacred or holy river. The location is rotated among Allahabad, Haridwar, Nashik, and Ujjain.
* Char Dham (Four Holy pilgrimage sites): The famous four holy sites Puri, Rameswaram, Dwarka, and Badrinath (or alternatively the Himalayan towns of Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri, and Yamunotri) compose the &quot;Char Dham&quot; (&quot;four abodes&quot;) pilgrimage circuit.
* Kanwar Pilgrimage: The Kanwar is India&#x27;s largest annual religious pilgrimage. As part of this phenomenon, millions of participants gather sacred water from the Ganga (usually in Haridwar, Gangotri, Gaumukh, or Sultanganj) and carry it across hundreds of miles to dispense as offerings in Shiva shrines.
* Old Holy cities per Puranic Texts: Varanasi also known as Kashi (Shiva), Prayagraj, Haridwar-Rishikesh (Vishnu), Mathura-Vrindavan (Krishna), Pandharpur (Krishna), Paithan, Kanchipuram (Parvati), Dwarka (Krishna) and Ayodhya (Rama).
* Major Temple cities: Puri, which hosts a major Vaishnava Jagannath temple and Ratha Yatra celebration; Katra, home to the Vaishno Devi Temple; Three comparatively recent temples of fame and huge pilgrimage are Shirdi, home to Sai Baba of Shirdi, Tirumala - Tirupati, home to the Tirumala Venkateswara Temple; and Sabarimala, where Ayyappan is worshipped.
* Shakti Pithas: Another important set of pilgrimages are the &quot;Shakti Pithas&quot;, where the Mother Goddess is worshipped, the two principal ones being &quot;Kalighat&quot; and &quot;Kamakhya&quot;.
* Pancha Ishwarams - the five ancient Shiva temples of Sri Lanka from classical antiquity.
* The Murugan pilgrimage route of Sri Lanka, an ancient Arunagirinathar-traversed Pada Yatra route of Tiruppadai temples includes the Maviddapuram Kandaswamy Temple in Kankesanturai, the Nallur Kandaswamy temple in Jaffna, the Pancha Ishwaram Koneswaram temple in Trincomalee, the Verugal Murugan Kovil on the banks of the river Verugal Aru, in Verugal, Trincomalee District, the Mandur Kandaswamy temple of Mandur (Sri Lanka), Thirukkovil Sithira Velayutha Swami Kovil, in Thirukkovil, Batticaloa, the Arugam Bay and Panamai in Amparai district, the Ukanthamalai Murugan Kovil, in Okanda, Kumana National Park and then through the park and Tissamaharama to the deity&#x27;s holiest site, Kataragama temple, Katirkamam in the South.
Hindu pilgrimage destinations may be holy cities (Varanasi, Badrinath); rivers (the Ganges, the Yamuna); mountains (several Himalayan peaks are sacred to both Hindus and Buddhists); caves (such as the Batu Caves near Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia); temples; festivals, such as the peripatetic Kumbh Mela, in 2001 the biggest public gathering in history; or the tombs and dwelling places of saints (Alandi, Shirdi).

==Islam==

The &quot;Ḥajj&quot; (, main pilgrimage to Mecca) is one of the five pillars of Islam and a mandatory religious duty for Muslims that must be carried out at least once in their lifetime by all adult Muslims who are physically and financially capable of undertaking the journey, and can support their family during their absence. The Hajj is one of the largest annual gatherings of people in the world. Since 2014, two or three million people have participated in the &quot;Hajj&quot; annually. The mosques in Mecca and Medina were closed in February 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic and the &quot;hajj&quot; was permitted for only a very limited number of Saudi nationals and foreigners living in Saudi Arabia starting on 29 July.

Another important place for Muslims is the city of Medina, the second holiest site in Islam, in Saudi Arabia, the final resting place of Muhammad in Al-Masjid an-Nabawi (The Mosque of the Prophet).

The &quot;Ihram&quot; (white robe of pilgrimage) is meant to show equality of all Muslim pilgrims in the eyes of Allah. &#x27;A white has no superiority over a black, nor a black over a white. Nor does an Arab have superiority over a non-Arab, nor a non-Arab over an Arab - except through piety&#x27; - statement of the Prophet Muhammad.

===Ziyarat===
A different form of pilgrimage is ziyarat ( &quot;ziyārah&quot;, &quot;visit&quot;; , &quot;ziyārat&quot;). Ziyarat generally refers to the act of visiting holy places such as tombs or shrines, often associated with the Prophet Muhammad, his family, companions, and other revered figures like legal scholars and Sufi saints. Ziyarat is a voluntary act of pilgrimage practiced by both Sunni and Shia Muslims. Unlike Hajj, which is obligatory for Muslims who are physically and financially able, or Umrah, which is highly recommended but not mandatory, Ziyarat involves visits to a variety of sacred and historically significant locations beyond Mecca. These include mosques, tombs, battlefields, mountains, caves, and other places where important spiritual or historical events in Islamic history took place. It holds deep spiritual significance for millions of Muslims around the world.

One notable example is the Grand Magal of Touba, east of Dakar, Senegal. About four million pilgrims participate annually to celebrate the life and teachings of Cheikh Amadou Bamba, the founder of the Mouride brotherhood, who established the order in 1883. The pilgrimage begins on the 18th of Safar, the second month of the Islamic calendar.

While ziyarat is viewed as permissible and spiritually enriching by most Sunni and Shia traditions, some fundamentalist movements, such as Salafism and Wahhabism, discourage or oppose it. These movements are characterized by a strict, literalist interpretation of Islam and opposition to practices they consider innovations, such as shrine visitation.

Ziyarat also includes the Ziyarat al-Imam, which refers specifically to the pilgrimage to the shrines of the Shia Imams, especially revered figures like Imam Ali and Imam Hussein. The Arba&#x27;in pilgrimage is the world&#x27;s largest pilgrimage and largest annual public gathering in the world, where millions of Shia Muslims travel to Karbala to commemorate the martyrdom of Imam Hussein during the 40-day mourning period after Ashura.

===Shia===

&quot;Al-Arba‘īn&quot; (, &quot;The Forty&quot;), &quot;Chehelom&quot; (, , &quot;the fortieth [day]&quot;) or &quot;Qirkhī&quot;, &quot;Imāmīn Qirkhī&quot; ( (), &quot;the fortieth of Imam&quot;) is a Shia Muslim religious observance that occurs forty days after the Day of Ashura. It commemorates the martyrdom of Husayn ibn Ali, the grandson of Muhammad, which falls on the 20th or 21st day of the month of Safar. Imam Husayn ibn Ali and 72 companions were killed by Yazid I&#x27;s army in the Battle of Karbala in 61 AH (680 CE). Arba&#x27;een or forty days is also the usual length of mourning after the death of a family member or loved one in many Muslim traditions. Arba&#x27;een is one of the largest pilgrimage gatherings on Earth, in which up to 31 million people go to the city of Karbala in Iraq.

The second largest holy city in the world, Mashhad, Iran, attracts more than 20 million tourists and pilgrims every year, many of whom come to pay homage to Imam Reza (the eighth Shi&#x27;ite Imam). It has been a magnet for travelers since medieval times.

==Judaism==
While Solomon&#x27;s Temple stood, Jerusalem was the centre of the Jewish religious life and the site of the Three Pilgrimage Festivals of Passover, Shavuot and Sukkot, and all adult men who were able were required to visit and offer sacrifices (&quot;korbanot&quot;) at the Temple. After the destruction of the Temple, the obligation to visit Jerusalem and to make sacrifices no longer applied. The obligation was restored with the rebuilding of the Temple, but following its destruction in 70 CE, the obligation to make a pilgrimage to Jerusalem and offer sacrifices again went into abeyance.

The western retaining wall of the Temple Mount, known as the Western Wall or &quot;Wailing&quot; Wall, is the remaining part of Second Jewish Temple in the Old City of Jerusalem is the most sacred and visited site for Jews. Pilgrimage to this area was off-limits to Jews from 1948 to 1967, when East Jerusalem was under Jordanian control.

There are numerous lesser Jewish pilgrimage destinations, mainly tombs of &quot;tzadikim&quot;, throughout Israel and Palestine and all over the world, including: Hebron; Bethlehem; Mount Meron; Netivot; Uman, Ukraine; Silistra, Bulgaria; Damanhur, Egypt; and many others.

Many rabbis claim that even today, after the destruction of the Temple, there is a mitzvah to make a pilgrimage on holidays.

==Sikhism==
Sikhism does not consider pilgrimage as an act of spiritual merit. Guru Nanak went to places of pilgrimage to reclaim the fallen people, who had turned ritualists. He told them of the need to visit that temple of God, deep in the inner being of themselves. According to him: &quot;He performs a pilgrimage who controls the five vices.&quot;

Eventually, however, Amritsar and Harmandir Sahib (the Golden Temple) became the spiritual and cultural centre of the Sikh faith, and if a Sikh goes on pilgrimage it is usually to this place.

The Panj Takht (Punjabi: ਪੰਜ ਤਖ਼ਤ) are the five revered gurdwaras in India that are considered the thrones or seats of authority of Sikhism and are traditionally considered a pilgrimage.

==Taoism==

Mazu, also spelled as Matsu, is the most famous sea goddess in the Chinese southeastern sea area, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.

Mazu Pilgrimage is more likely as an event (or temple fair), pilgrims are called as &quot;Xiang Deng Jiao&quot; (&quot;pinyin: xiāng dēng jiǎo,&quot; it means &quot;lantern feet&quot; in Chinese), they would follow the Goddess&#x27;s (Mazu) palanquin from her own temple to another Mazu temple. By tradition, when the village Mazu palanquin passes, the residents would offer free water and food to those pilgrims along the way.

There are 2 main Mazu pilgrimages in Taiwan, usually held between lunar January and April, depending on Mazu&#x27;s will.
* Baishatun Mazu Pilgrimage: this pilgrimage can be traced to 1863, from Baishantun (Miaoli County) to Beigang (Yunlin County) and return, not over a definite route.
* Dajia Mazu Pilgrimage: from Dajia (Taichung City) to Xingang (Chiayi County) and return, it runs over a definite route.

==Zoroastrianism==

Zoroastrians have as their main pilgrimage destinations the city of Yazd and the temples of Pir-e Sabz and Pir-e Naraki in Iran, as well as the cities of Navsari and Udvada in India.

In Iran, there are pilgrimage destinations called &quot;pirs&quot; in several provinces, although the most familiar ones are in the province of Yazd. In addition to the traditional Yazdi shrines, new sites may be in the process of becoming pilgrimage destinations. The ruins are the ruins of ancient fire temples. One such site is the ruin of the Sassanian era Azargoshnasp fire temple in Iran&#x27;s Azarbaijan Province. Other sites are the ruins of fire temples at Rey, south of the capital Tehran, and the Firouzabad ruins sixty kilometres south of Shiraz in the province of Pars.

Atash Behram (&quot;Fire of victory&quot;) is the highest grade of fire temple in Zoroastrianism. It has 16 different &quot;kinds of fire&quot;, that is, fires gathered from 16 different sources. Currently there are 9 Atash Behram, one in Yazd, Iran and the rest in Western India. They have become a pilgrimage destination.

In India the cathedral fire temple that houses the Iranshah Atash Behram, located in the small town of Udvada in the west coast province of Gujarat, is a pilgrimage destination.

==Cultural pilgrimage==

A modern phenomenon is the cultural pilgrimage which, while involving a personal journey, is secular in nature. Destinations for such pilgrims can include historic sites of national or cultural importance, and can be defined as places &quot;of cultural significance: an artist&#x27;s home, the location of a pivotal event or an iconic destination&quot;. An example might be a devotee of the Beatles visiting Liverpool in England. Destinations for cultural pilgrims include Auschwitz concentration camp, Gettysburg Battlefield or the Ernest Hemingway House. Cultural pilgrims may also travel on religious pilgrimage routes, such as the Way of St. James, with the perspective of making it a historic or architectural tour rather than – or as well as – a religious experience.

Under communist regimes, devout secular pilgrims visited locations such as the Mausoleum of Lenin, the Mausoleum of Mao Zedong and the Birthplace of Karl Marx. Such visits were sometimes state-sponsored. Sites such as these continue to attract visitors. The distinction between religious, cultural or political pilgrimage and tourism is not necessarily always clear or rigid. Pilgrimage could also refer symbolically to journeys, largely on foot, to places where the concerned person(s) expect(s) to find spiritual and/or personal salvation. In the words of adventurer-author Jon Krakauer in his book Into The Wild, Christopher McCandless was &quot;a pilgrim perhaps&quot; to Alaska in search of spiritual bliss.

==Other==
===Meher Baba===
The main pilgrimage sites associated with the spiritual teacher Meher Baba are Meherabad, India, where Baba completed the &quot;major portion&quot; of his work and where his tomb is now located, and Meherazad, India, where Baba resided later in his life.

===Yazidism religion===

The Yazidism has numerous pilgrimage sites and holy sites, with the most important being located in Sinjar such as Lalish.

==In culture==
Some prominent literary characters who were pilgrims include:
* Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; recounts tales told by Christian pilgrims on their way to Canterbury Cathedral and the shrine of Thomas Becket.
*In the epic poem Divine Comedy, Dante Alighieri portrays himself as a pilgrim traveling through the afterlife realms of Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise.
*John Bunyan depicted multiple pilgrims (e.g., Christian – the protagonist, Faithful, Talkative, Christiana, Mercy, Old Honest, Mr. Fearing, Mr. Feeble-Mind, Mr. Ready-to-Halt, and Mr. Valiant) as well as false pilgrims (e.g., Formalist, Hypocrisy, and Mr. By-Ends) in his Christian allegory, &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; (1678)
* Wilfred of Ivanhoe, a palmer (medieval Christian from Europe who makes a pilgrimage to Jerusalem) and the titular character of Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s book &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;
*A palmer plays a significant role representing Reason in Book II of Edmund Spenser&#x27;s epic poem &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;
