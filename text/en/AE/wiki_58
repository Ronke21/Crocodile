<text>Neurosurgery or neurological surgery, known in common parlance as brain surgery, is the medical specialty that focuses on the surgical treatment or rehabilitation of disorders which affect any portion of the nervous system including the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nervous system, and cerebrovascular system. Neurosurgery as a medical specialty also includes non-surgical management of some neurological conditions.

==Education and context==
In different countries, there are different requirements for an individual to legally practice neurosurgery, and there are varying methods through which they must be educated. In most countries, neurosurgeon training requires a minimum period of seven years after graduating from medical school.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, students must gain entry into medical school. The MBBS qualification (Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery) takes four to six years depending on the student&#x27;s route. The newly qualified physician must then complete foundation training lasting two years; this is a paid training program in a hospital or clinical setting covering a range of medical specialties including surgery. Junior doctors then apply to enter the neurosurgical pathway. Unlike most other surgical specialties, it currently has its own independent training pathway which takes around eight years (ST1-8); before being able to sit for consultant exams with sufficient amounts of experience and practice behind them. Neurosurgery remains consistently amongst the most competitive medical specialties in which to obtain entry.

===United States===
In the United States, a neurosurgeon must generally complete four years of undergraduate education, four years of medical school, and seven years of residency (PGY-1-7). Most, but not all, residency programs have some component of basic science or clinical research. Neurosurgeons may pursue additional training in the form of a fellowship after residency, or, in some cases, as a senior resident in the form of an enfolded fellowship. These fellowships include pediatric neurosurgery, trauma/neurocritical care, functional and stereotactic surgery, surgical neuro-oncology, radiosurgery, neurovascular surgery, skull-base surgery, peripheral nerve and complex spinal surgery. Fellowships typically span one to two years. In the U.S., neurosurgery is a very small, highly competitive specialty, constituting only 0.5 percent of all physicians.

==History==

Neurosurgery, or the premeditated incision into the head for pain relief, has been around for thousands of years, but notable advancements in neurosurgery have only come within the last hundred years.
===Ancient===

The Incas appear to have practiced a procedure known as trepanation since before European colonization. During the Middle Ages in Al-Andalus from 936 to 1013 AD, Al-Zahrawi performed surgical treatments of head injuries, skull fractures, spinal injuries, hydrocephalus, subdural effusions and headache. During the Roman Empire, doctors and surgeons performed neurosurgery on depressed skull fractures. Simple forms of neurosurgery were performed on King Henri II in 1559, after a jousting accident with Gabriel Montgomery fatally wounded him. Ambroise Paré and Andreas Vesalius, both experts in their field at the time, 
attempted their own methods, to no avail, in curing Henri. In China, Hua Tuo created the first general anaesthesia called mafeisan, which he used on surgical procedures on the brain.

===Modern===
History of tumor removal: In 1879, after locating it via neurological signs alone, Scottish surgeon William Macewen (1848–1924) performed the first successful brain tumor removal. On November 25, 1884, after English physician Alexander Hughes Bennett (1848–1901) used Macewen&#x27;s technique to locate it, English surgeon Rickman Godlee (1849–1925) performed the first primary brain tumor removal, which differs from Macewen&#x27;s operation in that Bennett operated on the exposed brain, whereas Macewen operated outside of the &quot;brain proper&quot; via trepanation. On March 16, 1907, Austrian surgeon Hermann Schloffer became the first to successfully remove a pituitary tumor.

Lobotomy: also known as leucotomy, was a form of psychosurgery, a neurosurgical treatment of mental disorders that involves severing connections in the brain&#x27;s prefrontal cortex. The originator of the procedure, Portuguese neurologist António Egas Moniz, shared the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine of 1949. Some patients improved in some ways after the operation, but complications and impairmentssometimes severewere frequent. The procedure was controversial from its initial use, in part due to the balance between benefits and risks. It is mostly rejected as a treatment now and non-compliant with patients&#x27; rights.

History of electrodes in the brain: In 1878, Richard Caton discovered that electrical signals transmitted through an animal&#x27;s brain. In 1950 Jose Delgado invented the first electrode that was implanted in an animal&#x27;s brain (bull), using it to make it run and change direction. In 1972 the cochlear implant, a neurological prosthetic that allowed deaf people to hear was marketed for commercial use. In 1998 researcher Philip Kennedy implanted the first Brain Computer Interface (BCI) into a human subject.

A survey done in 2010 on 100 most cited works in neurosurgery shows that the works mainly cover clinical trials evaluating surgical and medical therapies, descriptions of novel techniques in neurosurgery, and descriptions of systems classifying and grading diseases.

===Modern surgical instruments===

The main advancements in neurosurgery came about as a result of highly crafted tools. Modern neurosurgical tools, or instruments, include chisels, curettes, dissectors, distractors, elevators, forceps, hooks, impactors, probes, suction tubes, power tools, and robots. Most of these modern tools have been in medical practice for a relatively long time. The main difference of these tools in neurosurgery, were the precision in which they were crafted. These tools are crafted with edges that are within a millimeter of desired accuracy. Other tools, such as hand held power saws and robots have only recently been commonly used inside of a neurological operating room. As an example, the University of Utah developed a device for computer-aided design / computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) which uses an image-guided system to define a cutting tool path for a robotic cranial drill.

== Organised neurosurgery ==

The World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (WFNS), founded in 1955, in Switzerland, as a professional, scientific, non governmental organization, is composed of 130 member societies: consisting of 5 Continental Associations (AANS, AASNS, CAANS, EANS and FLANC), 6 Affiliate Societies, and 119 National Neurosurgical Societies, representing some 50,000 neurosurgeons worldwide. It has a consultative status in the United Nations. The official Journal of the Organization is World Neurosurgery. The other global organisations being the World Academy of Neurological Surgery (WANS) and the World Federation of Skull Base Societies (WFSBS).

== Main divisions ==
General neurosurgery involves most neurosurgical conditions including neuro-trauma and other neuro-emergencies such as intracranial hemorrhage. Most level 1 hospitals have this kind of practice.

Specialized branches have developed to cater to special and difficult conditions. These specialized branches co-exist with general neurosurgery in more sophisticated hospitals. To practice advanced specialization within neurosurgery, additional higher fellowship training of one to two years is expected from the neurosurgeon.
Some of these divisions of neurosurgery are:
# Vascular neurosurgery includes clipping of aneurysms and performing carotid endarterectomy (CEA).
# Stereotactic neurosurgery, functional neurosurgery, and epilepsy surgery (the latter includes partial or total corpus callosotomy – severing part or all of the corpus callosum to stop or lessen seizure spread and activity, and the surgical removal of functional, physiological and/or anatomical pieces or divisions of the brain, called epileptic foci, that are operable and that are causing seizures, and also the more radical and rare partial or total lobectomy, or even hemispherectomy – the removal of part or all of one of the lobes, or one of the cerebral hemispheres of the brain; those two procedures, when possible, are also very, very rarely used in oncological neurosurgery or to treat very severe neurological trauma, such as stab or gunshot wounds to the brain)
# Oncological neurosurgery also called neurosurgical oncology; includes pediatric oncological neurosurgery; treatment of benign and malignant central and peripheral nervous system cancers and pre-cancerous lesions in adults and children (including, among others, glioblastoma multiforme and other gliomas, brain stem cancer, astrocytoma, pontine glioma, medulloblastoma, spinal cancer, tumors of the meninges and intracranial spaces, secondary metastases to the brain, spine, and nerves, and peripheral nervous system tumors)
# Skull base surgery
# Spinal neurosurgery
# Peripheral nerve surgery
# Pediatric neurosurgery (for cancer, seizures, bleeding, stroke, cognitive disorders or congenital neurological disorders)

=== Commonly performed surgeries ===
According to an analysis by the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP), the most common surgeries performed by neurosurgeons in between 2006 and 2014 were the following:
* Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF)
* Craniotomy for brain tumor (CBT)
* Discectomy
* Laminectomy
* Posterolateral lumbar fusion (PLF)

==Neuropathology==

Neuropathology is a specialty within the study of pathology focused on the disease of the brain, spinal cord, and neural tissue. This includes the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system. Tissue analysis comes from either surgical biopsies or post mortem autopsies. Common tissue samples include muscle fibers and nervous tissue. Common applications of neuropathology include studying samples of tissue in patients who have Parkinson&#x27;s disease, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, dementia, Huntington&#x27;s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, mitochondria disease, and any disorder that has neural deterioration in the brain or spinal cord.

===History===
While pathology has been studied for millennia only within the last few hundred years has medicine focused on a tissue- and organ-based approach to tissue disease. In 1810, Thomas Hodgkin started to look at the damaged tissue for the cause. This was conjoined with the emergence of microscopy and started the current understanding of how the tissue of the human body is studied.

==Neuroanesthesia==
Neuroanesthesia is a field of anesthesiology which focuses on neurosurgery. Anesthesia is not used during the middle of an &quot;awake&quot; brain surgery. Awake brain surgery is where the patient is conscious for the middle of the procedure and sedated for the beginning and end. This procedure is used when the tumor does not have clear boundaries and the surgeon wants to know if they are invading on critical regions of the brain which involve functions like talking, cognition, vision, and hearing. It will also be conducted for procedures which the surgeon is trying to combat epileptic seizures.

===History===
The physician Hippocrates (460–370 BCE) made accounts of using different wines to sedate patients while trepanning. In 60 CE, Dioscorides, a physician, pharmacologist, and botanist, detailed how mandrake, henbane, opium, and alcohol were used to put patients to sleep during trepanning. In 972 CE, two brother surgeons in Paramara, now India, used &quot;samohine&quot; to sedate a patient while removing a small tumor, and awoke the patient by pouring onion and vinegar in the patient&#x27;s mouth. The combination of carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and nitrogen, was a form of neuroanesthesia adopted in the 18th century and introduced by Humphry Davy.

==Neurosurgery methods==
Various Imaging methods are used in modern neurosurgery diagnosis and treatment. They include computer assisted imaging computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and stereotactic radiosurgery. Some neurosurgery procedures involve the use of intra-operative MRI and functional MRI.

In &quot;conventional neurosurgery&quot; the neurosurgeon opens the skull, creating a large opening to access the brain. Techniques involving smaller openings with the aid of microscopes and endoscopes are now being used as well. Methods that utilize small craniotomies in conjunction with high-clarity microscopic visualization of neural tissue offer excellent results. However, the open methods are still traditionally used in trauma or emergency situations.

&quot;Microsurgery&quot; is utilized in many aspects of neurological surgery. Microvascular techniques are used in EC-IC bypass surgery and in restoration carotid endarterectomy. The clipping of an aneurysm is performed under microscopic vision. Minimally-invasive spine surgery utilizes microscopes or endoscopes. Procedures such as microdiscectomy, laminectomy, and artificial disc replacement rely on microsurgery.

Using &quot;stereotaxy&quot; neurosurgeons can approach a minute target in the brain through a minimal opening. This is used in functional neurosurgery where electrodes are implanted or gene therapy is instituted with high level of accuracy as in the case of Parkinson&#x27;s disease or Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Using the combination method of open and stereotactic surgery, intraventricular hemorrhages can potentially be evacuated successfully. Conventional surgery using image guidance technologies is also becoming common and is referred to as surgical navigation, computer-assisted surgery, navigated surgery, stereotactic navigation. Similar to a car or mobile Global Positioning System (GPS), image-guided surgery systems, like Curve Image Guided Surgery and StealthStation, use cameras or electromagnetic fields to capture and relay the patient&#x27;s anatomy and the surgeon&#x27;s precise movements in relation to the patient, to computer monitors in the operating room. These sophisticated computerized systems are used before and during surgery to help orient the surgeon with three-dimensional images of the patient&#x27;s anatomy including the tumor. Real-time functional brain mapping has been employed to identify specific functional regions using electrocorticography (ECoG)

Minimally invasive &quot;endoscopic surgery&quot; is commonly utilized by neurosurgeons when appropriate. Techniques such as endoscopic endonasal surgery are used in pituitary tumors, craniopharyngiomas, chordomas, and the repair of cerebrospinal fluid leaks. Ventricular endoscopy is used in the treatment of intraventricular bleeds, hydrocephalus, colloid cyst and neurocysticercosis. Endonasal endoscopy is at times carried out with neurosurgeons and ENT surgeons working together as a team.

Repair of craniofacial disorders and disturbance of cerebrospinal fluid circulation is done by neurosurgeons who also occasionally team up with maxillofacial and plastic surgeons. Cranioplasty for craniosynostosis is performed by pediatric neurosurgeons with or without plastic surgeons.

Neurosurgeons are involved in &quot;stereotactic radiosurgery&quot; along with radiation oncologists in tumor and AVM treatment. Radiosurgical methods such as Gamma knife, Cyberknife and Novalis Radiosurgery are used as well.

&quot;Endovascular neurosurgery&quot; utilize endovascular image guided procedures for the treatment of aneurysms, AVMs, carotid stenosis, strokes, and spinal malformations, and vasospasms. Techniques such as angioplasty, stenting, clot retrieval, embolization, and diagnostic angiography are endovascular procedures.

A common procedure performed in neurosurgery is the placement of ventriculo-peritoneal shunt (VP shunt). In pediatric practice this is often implemented in cases of congenital hydrocephalus. The most common indication for this procedure in adults is normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH).

&quot;Neurosurgery of the spine&quot; covers the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine. Some indications for spine surgery include spinal cord compression resulting from trauma, arthritis of the spinal discs, or spondylosis. In cervical cord compression, patients may have difficulty with gait, balance issues, and/or numbness and tingling in the hands or feet. Spondylosis is the condition of spinal disc degeneration and arthritis that may compress the spinal canal. This condition can often result in bone-spurring and disc herniation. Power drills and special instruments are often used to correct any compression problems of the spinal canal. Disc herniations of spinal vertebral discs are removed with special rongeurs. This procedure is known as a &quot;discectomy&quot;. Generally once a disc is removed it is replaced by an implant which will create a bony fusion between vertebral bodies above and below. Instead, a mobile disc could be implanted into the disc space to maintain mobility. This is commonly used in cervical disc surgery. At times instead of disc removal a Laser discectomy could be used to decompress a nerve root. This method is mainly used for lumbar discs. &quot;Laminectomy&quot; is the removal of the lamina of the vertebrae of the spine in order to make room for the compressed nerve tissue.

Surgery for chronic pain is a sub-branch of functional neurosurgery. Some of the techniques include implantation of deep brain stimulators, spinal cord stimulators, peripheral stimulators and pain pumps.

Surgery of the peripheral nervous system is also possible, and includes the very common procedures of carpal tunnel decompression and peripheral nerve transposition. Numerous other types of nerve entrapment conditions and other problems with the peripheral nervous system are treated as well.

==Conditions==
Conditions treated by neurosurgeons include, but are not limited to:
* Meningitis and other central nervous system infections including abscesses
* Spinal disc herniation
* Cervical spinal stenosis and Lumbar spinal stenosis
* Hydrocephalus
* Head trauma (brain hemorrhages, skull fractures, etc.)
* Spinal cord trauma
* Traumatic injuries of peripheral nerves
* Tumors of the spine, spinal cord and peripheral nerves
* Intracerebral hemorrhage, such as subarachnoid hemorrhage, interdepartmental, and intracellular hemorrhages
* Some forms of drug-resistant epilepsy
* Some forms of movement disorders (advanced Parkinson&#x27;s disease, chorea)this involves the use of specially developed minimally invasive stereotactic techniques (functional, stereotactic neurosurgery) such as ablative surgery and deep brain stimulation surgery
* Intractable pain of cancer or trauma patients and cranial/peripheral nerve pain
* Some forms of intractable psychiatric disorders
* Vascular malformations (i.e., arteriovenous malformations, venous angiomas, cavernous angiomas, capillary telangectasias) of the brain and spinal cord
* Moyamoya disease

== Recovery ==

=== Postoperative pain ===
Pain following brain surgery can be significant and may lengthen recovery, increase the amount of time a person stays in the hospital following surgery, and increase the risk of complications following surgery. Severe acute pain following brain surgery may also increase the risk of a person developing a chronic post-craniotomy headache. Approaches to treating pain in adults include treatment with nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which have been shown to reduce pain for up to 24 hours following surgery. Low-quality evidence supports the use of the medications dexmedetomidine, pregabalin or gabapentin to reduce post-operative pain. Low-quality evidence also supports scalp blocks and scalp infiltration to reduce postoperative pain. Gabapentin or pregabalin may also decrease vomiting and nausea following surgery, based on very low-quality medical evidence.

== Bioethics in neurosurgery ==
Neurosurgery is a part of practical medicine and the only specialty that involves invasive intervention in the activity of the living brain. The brain ensures the structural and functional integrity of the body and the implementation of all the main life processes of the body. Therefore, neurosurgery faces a wide range of bioethical issues and a significant selection of the latest treatment technologies.

Neurosurgery has the following applied scientific and ethical problems:

* Ethical and legal aspects of clinical research;
* Αxiological deficit due to professional deformation and professional burnout;
* Limited access to expensive medical services;
* The industry-specific problem of &quot;medical error&quot; due to the complexity of neurosurgical pathologies and the huge number of possible technologies and tools for their treatment;
* Controversial bioethical and legal issues of surgery for the treatment of psychiatric diseases;
* Bioethical discussions regarding the instrumentation of reconstructive surgery, through the use of experimental technologies;
* Debatable bioethical issues of improving human brain activity with the help of artificial implants, for instance neurocomponents (artificial impulse quasi-neurons);
* Cyborgization in transhumanism meaning;
* Ethical issue of standardization of research protocols for testing neuroengineering means of nerve tissue regeneration in order to improve the implementation of experimental research results in clinical practice.

<text>The (N64) is a home video game console developed and marketed by Nintendo. It was released in Japan on June 23, 1996, in North America on September 29, 1996, and in Europe and Australia on March 1, 1997. The successor to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, it was the last major home console to use ROM cartridges as its primary storage format. As a fifth-generation console, the Nintendo 64 primarily competed with Sony&#x27;s PlayStation and the Sega Saturn.

Development began in 1993 in partnership with Silicon Graphics, using the codename Project Reality, then a test model and arcade platform called Ultra 64. The final design was named after its 64-bit CPU, which aided in the console&#x27;s 3D capabilities. Its design was mostly complete by mid-1995 and launch was delayed until 1996 for the completion of the launch games &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, &quot;Pilotwings 64&quot;, and the Japanese-exclusive &quot;Saikyō Habu Shōgi&quot;. The charcoal-gray console was followed by a series of color variants. Some games require the Expansion Pak accessory to increase system RAM from 4 MB to 8 MB, for improved graphics and functionality. The console mainly supports saved game storage either onboard cartridges or on the Controller Pak accessory. The 64DD peripheral drive hosts both exclusive games and expansion content for cartridges, with many further accessories plus the defunct Internet service Randnet, but it was a commercial failure and was released only in Japan.

&quot;Time&quot; named it Machine of the Year in 1996, and in 2011, &quot;IGN&quot; named it the ninth-greatest video game console of all time. The Nintendo 64 was discontinued in 2002 following the 2001 launch of its successor, the GameCube, having sold over 32 million units globally. The Nintendo 64 was critically acclaimed and, although it sold less than PlayStation, remained at a strong position in the United States, but it commercially failed in Japan and Europe.

== History ==
=== Background ===

Following the video game crash of 1983, Nintendo led the industry with its first home game console, the Famicom, originally released in Japan in 1983 and later released internationally as the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) beginning in 1985. Though the NES and its successor, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), were commercially successful, sales for the SNES decreased as a result of the Japanese recession. Competition from emerging rival Sega&#x27;s 32-bit Saturn console over Nintendo&#x27;s 16-bit SNES emphasized Nintendo&#x27;s need to develop improved SNES hardware or risk losing market dominance to its competitors. The Atari 5200, 7800, Lynx, and Jaguar also competed with Nintendo during this time.

Nintendo thought to enhance the SNES with a proposed CD-ROM peripheral, to be developed in partnership with other companies. Contracts with CD-ROM technology pioneers Philips and Sony failed after some hardware prototypes, and no games from Nintendo or other interested third parties were developed. Philips used the software portion of its license by releasing original &quot;Mario&quot; and &quot;Zelda&quot; games on its competing CD-i console, and Sony salvaged its internal progress to develop the PlayStation. Nintendo&#x27;s third-party developers protested its strict licensing policies.

=== Development ===
Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI), a long-time leader in graphics computing, was exploring expansion by adapting its supercomputing technology into the higher volume consumer market, starting with the video game market. SGI reduced its MIPS R4000 family of enterprise CPUs, to consume only 0.5 watts of power instead of 1.5 to 2 watts, with an estimated target price of instead of –200. The company created a design proposal for a video game chipset, seeking an established partner in that market. Jim Clark, founder of SGI, offered the proposal to Tom Kalinske, who was the CEO of Sega of America. The next candidate would be Nintendo.

Kalinske said that he and Joe Miller of Sega of America were &quot;quite impressed&quot; with SGI&#x27;s prototype, and invited their hardware team to travel from Japan to meet with SGI. The engineers from Sega Enterprises said that their evaluation of the early prototype had revealed several hardware problems. Those were subsequently resolved, but Sega had already decided against SGI&#x27;s design. Nintendo disputed this account, arguing that SGI chose Nintendo because Nintendo was the more appealing partner. Sega demanded exclusive rights to the chip, but Nintendo offered a non-exclusive license. Michael Slater, publisher of Microprocessor Report said, &quot;The mere fact of a business relationship there is significant because of Nintendo&#x27;s phenomenal ability to drive volume. If it works at all, it could bring MIPS to levels of volume [SGI] never dreamed of.&quot;

Jim Clark met with the CEO of Nintendo at the time, Hiroshi Yamauchi, in early 1993, initiating Project Reality. On August 23, 1993, the companies announced a global joint development and licensing agreement surrounding Project Reality, projecting that the yet unnamed product would be &quot;developed specifically for Nintendo, would be unveiled in arcades in 1994, and would be available for home use by late 1995 ... below $250&quot;. This announcement coincided with Nintendo&#x27;s August 1993 Shoshinkai trade show.

SGI had named the core components Reality Immersion Technology, which would be first used in Project Reality: the MIPS R4300i CPU, the MIPS Reality Coprocessor graphics chip, and the embedded software. Some chip technology and manufacturing was provided by NEC, Toshiba, and Sharp. SGI had recently acquired MIPS Computer Systems (renamed to MIPS Technologies), and the two worked together to be ultimately responsible for the design of the Reality Immersion Technology chips under engineering director Jim Foran and chief hardware architect Tim Van Hook.
The initial Project Reality game development platform was developed and sold by SGI in the form of its Onyx supercomputer costing – and loaded with the namesake RealityEngine2 graphics boards and four 150 MHz R4400 CPUs. Its software includes early Project Reality application and emulation APIs based on Performer and OpenGL. This graphics supercomputing platform had served as the source design which SGI had reduced down to become the Reality Immersion Technology for Project Reality.

The Project Reality team prototyped a game controller for the development system by modifying a Super NES controller to have a primitive analog joystick and Z trigger. Under maximal secrecy even from the rest of the company, a LucasArts developer said his team would &quot;furtively hide the prototype controller in a cardboard box while we used it. In answer to the inevitable questions about what we were doing, we replied jokingly that it was a new type of controllera bowl of liquid that absorbed your thoughts through your fingertips. Of course, you had to think in Japanese...&quot;

On June 23, 1994, Nintendo announced the official name of the still unfinished console as &quot;Ultra 64&quot;. The first group of elite developers selected by Nintendo was nicknamed the &quot;Dream Team&quot;: Silicon Graphics, Inc.; Alias Research, Inc.; Software Creations; Rambus, Inc.; MultiGen, Inc.; Rare, Ltd. and Rare Coin-It Toys &amp; Games, Inc.; WMS Industries, Inc.; Acclaim Entertainment, Inc.; Williams Entertainment, Inc.; Paradigm Simulation, Inc.; Spectrum Holobyte; DMA Design Ltd.; Angel Studios; Ocean; Time Warner Interactive; and Mindscape.

By purchasing and developing upon Project Reality&#x27;s graphics supercomputing platform, Nintendo and its Dream Team could begin prototyping their games according to SGI&#x27;s estimated console performance profile, prior to the finalization of the console hardware specifications. When the Ultra 64 hardware was finalized, that supercomputer-based prototyping platform was later supplanted by a much cheaper and fully accurate console simulation board to be hosted within a low-end SGI Indy workstation in July 1995. SGI&#x27;s early performance estimates based upon its supercomputing platform were ultimately reported to have been fairly accurate to the final Ultra 64 product, allowing LucasArts developers to port their &quot;Star Wars&quot; game prototype to console reference hardware in only three days.

The console&#x27;s design was publicly revealed for the first time in late Q2 1994. Images of the console displayed the Nintendo Ultra 64 logo and a ROM cartridge, but no controller. This prototype console&#x27;s form factor would be retained by the product when it eventually launched. Having initially indicated the possibility of utilising the increasingly popular CD-ROM if the medium&#x27;s endemic performance problems were solved, the company now announced a much faster but space-limited cartridge-based system, which prompted open analysis by the gaming press. The system was frequently marketed as the world&#x27;s first 64-bit gaming system, often stating the console was more powerful than the first Moon landing computers. Atari had already claimed to have made the first 64-bit game console with their Atari Jaguar, but the Jaguar only uses a general 64-bit architecture in conjunction with two 32-bit RISC processors and a 16/32-bit Motorola 68000.

Later in Q2 1994, Nintendo signed a licensing agreement with Midway&#x27;s parent company which enabled Midway to develop and market arcade games with the Ultra 64 brand, and formed a joint venture company called &quot;Williams/Nintendo&quot; to market Nintendo-exclusive home conversions of these games. The result is two Ultra 64 branded arcade games, &quot;Killer Instinct&quot; and &quot;Cruis&#x27;n USA&quot;. Not derived from Project Reality&#x27;s console-based branch of Ultra 64, the arcade branch uses a different MIPS CPU, has no Reality Coprocessor, and uses onboard ROM chips and a hard drive instead of a cartridge. &quot;Killer Instinct&quot; features 3D character artwork pre-rendered into 2D form, and computer-generated movie backgrounds that are streamed off the hard drive and animated as the characters move horizontally.

Previously, the plan had been to release the console with the name &quot;Ultra Famicom&quot; in Japan and &quot;Nintendo Ultra 64&quot; in other markets. Rumors circulated attributing the name change to the possibility of legal action by Konami&#x27;s ownership of the Ultra Games trademark. Nintendo said that trademark issues were not a factor, and the sole reason for any name change was to establish a single worldwide brand and logo for the console. The new global name &quot;Nintendo 64&quot; was proposed by &quot;Earthbound&quot; series developer Shigesato Itoi. The prefix for the model numbering scheme for hardware and software across the Nintendo 64 platform is &quot;NUS-&quot;, which is presumed to stand for &quot;Nintendo Ultra Sixty-four&quot;.

=== Announcement ===
The newly renamed Nintendo 64 console was unveiled to the public in playable form on November 24, 1995, at Nintendo&#x27;s 7th Annual Shoshinkai trade show. Eager for a preview, &quot;hordes of Japanese schoolkids huddled in the cold outside ... the electricity of anticipation clearly rippling through their ranks&quot;. &quot;Game Zero&quot; magazine disseminated photos of the event two days later. Official coverage by Nintendo followed later via the &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; website and print magazine.

The console was originally slated for release by Christmas of 1995. In May 1995, Nintendo delayed the release to April 21, 1996. Consumers anticipating a Nintendo release the following year at a lower price than the competition reportedly reduced the sales of competing Sega and Sony consoles during the important Christmas shopping season. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; editor Ed Semrad even suggested that Nintendo may have announced the April 21, 1996 release date with this end in mind, knowing in advance that the system would not be ready by that date.

In its explanation of the delay, Nintendo claimed it needed more time for Nintendo 64 software to mature, and for third-party developers to produce games. Adrian Sfarti, a former engineer for SGI, attributed the delay to hardware problems; he claimed that the chips underperformed in testing and were being redesigned. In 1996, the Nintendo 64&#x27;s software development kit was completely redesigned as the Windows-based Partner-N64 system, by Kyoto Microcomputer, Co. Ltd. of Japan.

The Nintendo 64&#x27;s release date was later delayed again, to June 23, 1996. Nintendo said the reason for this delay, and in particular, the cancellation of plans to release the console in all markets worldwide simultaneously, was that the company&#x27;s marketing studies now indicated that they would not be able to manufacture enough units to meet demand by April 21, 1996, potentially angering retailers in the same way Sega had done with its surprise early launch of the Saturn in North America and Europe.

To counteract the possibility that gamers would grow impatient with the wait for the Nintendo 64 and purchase one of the several competing consoles already on the market, Nintendo ran ads for the system well in advance of its announced release dates, with slogans like &quot;Wait for it...&quot; and &quot;Is it worth the wait? Only if you want the best!&quot;

=== Release ===
&quot;Popular Electronics&quot; called the launch a &quot;much hyped, long-anticipated moment&quot;. Several months before the launch, &quot;GamePro&quot; reported that many gamers, including a large percentage of their own editorial staff, were already saying they favored the Nintendo 64 over the Saturn and PlayStation.
The console was first released in Japan on June 23, 1996. Though the initial shipment of 300,000 units sold out on the first day, Nintendo successfully avoided a repeat of the Super Famicom launch day pandemonium, in part by using a wider retail network which included convenience stores. The remaining 200,000 units of the first production run shipped on June 26 and 30, with almost all of them reserved ahead of time. In the months between the Japanese and North American launches, the Nintendo 64 saw brisk sales on the American gray market, with import stores charging as much as $699 plus shipping for the system. The Nintendo 64 was first sold in North America on September 26, 1996, though having been advertised for the 29th. It was launched with just two games in the United States, &quot;Pilotwings 64&quot; and &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;; &quot;Cruis&#x27;n USA&quot; was pulled from the line-up less than a month before launch because it did not meet Nintendo&#x27;s quality standards. In 1994, prior to the launch, Nintendo of America chairman Howard Lincoln emphasized the quality of first-party games, saying &quot;... we&#x27;re convinced that a few great games at launch are more important than great games mixed in with a lot of dogs&quot;. Its American launch was wildly successful, breaking records - its first day sales were significantly higher than PlayStation&#x27;s and Saturn&#x27;s respective launches the year before.

The PAL version of the console was released in Europe on March 1, 1997, except for France where it was released on September 1 of the same year. According to Nintendo of America representatives, Nintendo had been planning a simultaneous launch in Japan, North America, and Europe, but market studies indicated that worldwide demand for the system far exceeded the number of units they could have ready by launch, potentially leading to consumer and retailer frustration.
Originally intended to be priced at , the console was ultimately launched at to make it competitive with Sony and Sega offerings, as both the Saturn and PlayStation had been lowered to $199.99 earlier that summer. Nintendo priced the console as an impulse purchase, a strategy from the toy industry. The price of the console in the United States was further reduced in August 1998.

==== Promotion ====
The Nintendo 64&#x27;s North American launch was backed with a $54 million marketing campaign by Leo Burnett Worldwide (meaning over $100 in marketing per North American unit that had been manufactured up to this point). While the competing Saturn and PlayStation both set teenagers and adults as their target audience, the Nintendo 64&#x27;s target audience was pre-teens.

To boost sales during the slow post-Christmas season, Nintendo and General Mills worked together on a promotional campaign that appeared in early 1999. The advertisement by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, New York began on January 25 and encouraged children to buy Fruit by the Foot snacks for tips to help them with their Nintendo 64 games. Ninety different tips were available, with three variations of thirty tips each.

Nintendo advertised its Funtastic Series of peripherals with a $10 million print and television campaign from February 28 to April 30, 2000. Leo Burnett Worldwide was in charge again.

== Hardware ==
=== Technical specifications ===

The console&#x27;s main microprocessor is a 64-bit NEC VR4300 CPU with a clock rate of 93.75 MHz and a performance of 125 million instructions per second. &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; said it had power similar to the Pentium processors found in desktop computers. Except for its narrower 32-bit system bus, the VR4300 retained the computational abilities of the more powerful 64-bit MIPS R4300i, though software rarely took advantage of 64-bit data precision operations. Nintendo 64 games generally used faster and more compact 32-bit data-operations, as these were sufficient to generate 3D-scene data for the console&#x27;s RSP (Reality Signal Processor) unit. In addition, 32-bit code executes faster and requires less storage space (which is at a premium on the Nintendo 64&#x27;s cartridges).

In terms of its random-access memory (RAM), the Nintendo 64 was one of the first consoles to implement a unified memory subsystem, instead of having separate banks of memory for CPU, audio, and video operations. The memory itself consists of 4 megabytes of Rambus RDRAM, expandable to 8 MB with the Expansion Pak. Rambus was quite new at the time and offered Nintendo a way to provide a large amount of bandwidth for a relatively low cost.

Audio may be processed by the Reality Coprocessor or the CPU and is output to a DAC with up to sample rate.

The system allows for video output in two formats: composite video and S-Video. The composite and S-Video cables are the same as those used with the preceding Super NES and succeeding GameCube platforms.

The Nintendo 64 supports 16.8 million colors. The system can display resolutions from 320×240 up to 640×480 pixels. Most games that make use of the system&#x27;s higher resolution mode require use of the Expansion Pak RAM upgrade; though several do not, such as Acclaim&#x27;s &quot;NFL Quarterback Club&quot; series and EA Sports&#x27;s second generation &quot;Madden&quot;, &quot;FIFA&quot;, &quot;Supercross&quot;, and &quot;NHL&quot; games. The majority of games use the system&#x27;s low resolution 320×240 mode. Many games support a video display ratio of up to 16:9 using either anamorphic widescreen or letterboxing.

=== Controller ===
The Nintendo 64 controller has an &quot;M&quot; shape with 10 buttons, one analog control stick, and a directional pad.

The Nintendo 64 is one of the first with four controller ports. According to Shigeru Miyamoto, Nintendo opted to have four controller ports for its first console powerful enough to handle a four player split screen without significant slowdown.

=== Game Paks ===

After Nintendo&#x27;s multiple plans for compact disc-based games for Super NES, the industry expected its next console to, like PlayStation, use that medium. The first Nintendo 64 prototypes in November 1995 surprised observers by again using ROM cartridge. Cartridge size varies from 4 to 64 MB. Many cartridges include the ability to save games internally.

Nintendo&#x27;s controversial selection of the cartridge medium for the Nintendo 64 has been cited as a key factor in the company losing its dominant position in the gaming market. Some of the cartridge&#x27;s advantages are difficult for developers to manifest prominently, requiring innovative solutions which only came late in the console&#x27;s life cycle.

====Advantages====
Nintendo cited several advantages for making the Nintendo 64 cartridge-based, primarily cartridges&#x27; very fast load times in comparison to compact disc-based games. Being able to play a cartridge game almost immediately had helped Nintendo defeat the Commodore 64 and other US home computers in the 1980s. While loading screens appear in many PlayStation games, they are rare in Nintendo 64 games. Although vulnerable to long-term environmental damage, the cartridges are far more resistant to physical damage than compact discs. Nintendo also cited the fact that cartridges are more difficult to pirate than CDs, thus resisting copyright infringement, albeit at the expense of lowered profit margin for Nintendo. While unauthorized N64 interface devices for the PC were later developed, these devices are rare when compared to a regular CD drive used on the PlayStation, which suffered widespread copyright infringement.

====Disadvantages====
On the downside, cartridges took longer to manufacture than CDs, with each production run (from order to delivery) taking two weeks or more. This meant that publishers of Nintendo 64 games had to predict demand for a game ahead of its release. They risked being left with a surplus of expensive cartridges for a failed game, or a weeks-long shortage of product if they underestimated a game&#x27;s popularity. The cost of producing a Nintendo 64 cartridge was also far higher than for a CD. Publishers passed these expenses onto the consumer. Nintendo 64 games cost an average of $10 more when compared to games produced for rival consoles. The higher cost also created the potential for much greater losses to the game&#x27;s publisher in the case of a flop, making the less risky CD medium tempting for third-party companies. Some third-party companies also complained that they were at an unfair disadvantage against Nintendo first-party developers when publishing games for the Nintendo 64, since Nintendo owned the manufacturing plant where cartridges for their consoles are made and therefore could sell their first party games at a lower price, and prioritize their production over those of other companies.

Perhaps the most important reason for cartridge, observers thought, was what a later writer described as &quot;Nintendo’s congenital need to be &quot;different&quot;, and to assert its idiosyncratic hegemony by making everyone else dance to its tune while it was at it&quot;.

As fifth generation games became more complex in content, sound and graphics, games began to exceed the limits of cartridge storage capacity. Nintendo 64 cartridges had a maximum of 64 MB of data, whereas CDs held 650 MB. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; initially defended the quality control incentives associated with working with limited storage on cartridges, citing Nintendo&#x27;s position that cartridge game developers tend to &quot;place a premium on substance over flash&quot;, and noted that the N64 launch games are free of &quot;poorly acted live-action sequences or half-baked musical overtures&quot; which it says tend to be found on CD-ROM games. However, the cartridge&#x27;s limitations became apparent with software ported from other consoles, so Nintendo 64 versions of cross-platform games were truncated or redesigned with the storage limits of a cartridge in mind. For instance this meant fewer textures, and/or shorter music tracks, while full motion video was not usually feasible for use in cutscenes unless heavily compressed and of very brief length. Another of its technical drawbacks is a limited-size texture cache, which force textures of limited dimensions and reduced color depth, appearing stretched when covering in-game surfaces.

The era&#x27;s competing systems from Sony and Sega (the PlayStation and Saturn, respectively) used CD-ROM discs to store their games. As a result, game developers who had traditionally supported Nintendo game consoles were now developing games for the competition. Some third-party developers, such as Square and Enix, whose &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; and &quot;Dragon Warrior VII&quot; were initially planned for the Nintendo 64, switched to the PlayStation, citing the insufficient storage capacity of the N64 cartridges. Some who remained released fewer games to the Nintendo 64; Konami released fifty PlayStation games, but only twenty nine for the Nintendo 64. New Nintendo 64 game releases were infrequent while new games were coming out rapidly for the PlayStation.

Through the difficulties with third parties, the Nintendo 64 supported popular games such as &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot;, giving it a long market life. Additionally, Nintendo&#x27;s strong first-party franchises such as &quot;Mario&quot; had strong name brand appeal. Second-parties of Nintendo, such as Rare, helped.

=== Color variants ===
The Nintendo 64 comes in several colors. The standard Nintendo 64 is charcoal gray, nearly black, and the controller is light gray (later releases in the U.S., Canada, and Australia included a bonus second controller in Atomic Purple). Various colorations and special editions were released.

Most Nintendo 64 game cartridges are gray in color, but some games have a colored cartridge. Fourteen games have black cartridges, and other colors (such as yellow, blue, red, gold, and green) were each used for six or fewer games. Several games, such as &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time&quot;, were released both in standard gray and in colored, limited edition versions.

=== Programming characteristics ===
The programming characteristics of the Nintendo 64 present unique challenges, with distinct potential advantages. &quot;The Economist&quot; described effective programming for the Nintendo 64 as being &quot;horrendously complex&quot;. As with many other game consoles and other types of embedded systems, the Nintendo 64&#x27;s architectural optimizations are uniquely acute, due to a combination of oversight on the part of the hardware designers, limitations on 3D technology of the time, and manufacturing capabilities.

As the Nintendo 64 reached the end of its lifecycle, hardware development chief Genyo Takeda repeatedly referred to the programming challenges using the word . Looking back, Takeda said &quot;When we made Nintendo 64, we thought it was logical that if you want to make advanced games, it becomes technically more difficult. We were wrong. We now understand it&#x27;s the cruising speed that matters, not the momentary flash of peak power.&quot;

=== Regional lock-out ===
In contrast to the NES and the Super NESin which the name of the platform and the hardware designs varied 
by regionNintendo developed the same brand and hardware design for the Nintendo 64 in every region worldwide. The company initially announced that regional lock-out chips would be used to region-lock games, but this method was never actually implemented, with region-locking instead being enforced by the cartridge cases having different notches on the back side depending on the market.

== Games ==

A total of 388 Nintendo 64 games were officially released, with just 85 exclusively sold in Japan. For comparison, the PlayStation received 4,105 games, the Saturn got over 1,000, the SNES got 1,755 games, and the NES got 716 Western releases plus over 1,000 in Japan. The considerably smaller Nintendo 64 game library has been attributed by some to the controversial decision not to adopt the CD-ROM, and programming difficulties for its complex architecture. This trend is also seen as a result of Hiroshi Yamauchi&#x27;s strategy, announced during his speech at the Nintendo 64&#x27;s November 1995 unveiling, that Nintendo would be restricting the number of games produced for the Nintendo 64 so that developers would focus on higher quality instead of quantity. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; also observed that this was part of Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;penchant for perfection [...] while other platforms offer quite a bit of junk, Nintendo routinely orders game developers back to the boards to fix less-than-perfect titles&quot;.

Although having much less third-party support than rival consoles, Nintendo&#x27;s strong first-party franchises such as &quot;Mario&quot; enjoyed wide brand appeal. Second-parties of Nintendo, such as Rare, released groundbreaking titles. Consequently, the Nintendo 64 game library included a high number of critically acclaimed and widely sold games. According to TRSTS reports, three of the top five best-selling games in the U.S. for December 1996 were Nintendo 64 games (both of the remaining two were Super NES games). &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; is the best-selling console game of the generation, with 11 million units sold beating &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; for the PlayStation (at 10.85 million) and &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; (at 9.72 million) in sales. The game also received much praise from critics and helped to pioneer three-dimensional control schemes. &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; was important in the evolution of the first-person shooter, and has been named one of the greatest in the genre. &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time&quot; set the standard for future 3D action-adventure games and is considered by many to be one of the greatest games ever made.

=== Graphics ===
The most graphically demanding Nintendo 64 games on larger 32 or 64 MB cartridges are among the most advanced and detailed of 32- and 64-bit platforms. To maximize the hardware, developers created custom microcode. Nintendo 64 games running on custom microcode benefit from much higher polygon counts and more advanced lighting, animation, physics, and AI routines than its competition. &quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot; is arguably the pinnacle of its generation combining multicolored real-time lighting that illuminates each area to real-time shadowing, and detailed texturing replete with a full in-game facial animation system. The Nintendo 64 is capable of executing many more advanced and complex rendering techniques than its competitors. It is the first home console to feature trilinear filtering, to smooth textures. This contrasts with the Saturn and PlayStation, which use nearest-neighbor interpolation and produce more pixelated textures. Overall however the results of the Nintendo cartridge system were mixed.

The smaller storage size of ROM cartridges can limit the number of available textures. As a result, many games with much smaller 8 or 12 MB cartridges are forced to stretch textures over larger surfaces. Compounded by a limit of 4,096 bytes of on-chip texture memory, the result is often a distorted, out-of-proportion appearance. Many games with larger 32 or 64 MB cartridges avoid this issue entirely, including &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot;, &quot;Sin and Punishment: Successor of the Earth&quot;, and &quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot;, allowing for more detailed graphics with multiple, multi-layered textures across all surfaces.

=== Emulation ===

Several Nintendo 64 games have been released for the Wii and Wii U Virtual Console (VC) services and are playable with the Classic Controller, GameCube controller, Wii U Pro Controller, or Wii U GamePad. Differences include a higher resolution and a more consistent framerate than the Nintendo 64 originals. Some features, such as Rumble Pak functionality, are not available in the Wii versions. Some features are also changed on the Virtual Console releases. For example, the VC version of &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot; allows players to send photos through the Wii&#x27;s message service, and &quot;Wave Race 64&quot;″s in-game content was altered due to the expiration of the Kawasaki license. Several games developed by Rare were released on Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox Live Arcade service, including &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot;, &quot;Banjo-Tooie&quot;, and &quot;Perfect Dark&quot;, following Microsoft&#x27;s acquisition of Rareware in 2002. One exception is &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot;, released in April 2015 on the Wii U Virtual Console, as Nintendo retained the rights to the game. Several Nintendo 64 games via the &quot;Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack&quot; as the expanded tier of the Nintendo Switch Online were released in October 2021.

Several unofficial third-party emulators can play Nintendo 64 games on other platforms, such as Windows, Macintosh, and smartphones.

== Accessories ==

Nintendo 64 accessories include the Rumble Pak and the Transfer Pak.

The controller is shaped like an &quot;M&quot;, employing a joystick in the center. &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; called its shape &quot;evocative of some alien space ship&quot;. While noting that the three handles could be confusing, the magazine said, &quot;the separate grips allow different hand positions for various game types&quot;.

=== 64DD ===

Nintendo released a peripheral platform called 64DD, where &quot;DD&quot; stands for &quot;Disk Drive&quot;. Connecting to the expansion slot at the bottom of the system, the 64DD turns the Nintendo 64 console into an Internet appliance, a multimedia workstation, and an expanded gaming platform. This large peripheral allows players to play Nintendo 64 disk-based games, capture images from an external video source, and it allowed players to connect to the now-defunct Japanese Randnet online service. Not long after its limited mail-order release, the peripheral was discontinued. Only nine games were released, including the four &quot;Mario Artist&quot; games (&quot;Paint Studio&quot;, &quot;Talent Studio&quot;, &quot;Communication Kit&quot;, and &quot;Polygon Studio&quot;). Many planned games were eventually released in cartridge format or on other game consoles. The 64DD and the accompanying Randnet online service were released only in Japan.

To illustrate the fundamental significance of the 64DD to all game development at Nintendo, lead designer Shigesato Itoi said: &quot;I came up with a lot of ideas because of the 64DD. All things start with the 64DD. There are so many ideas I wouldn&#x27;t have been allowed to come up with if we didn&#x27;t have the 64DD&quot;. Shigeru Miyamoto concluded: &quot;Almost every new project for the N64 is based on the 64DD. ... we&#x27;ll make the game on a cartridge first, then add the technology we&#x27;ve cultivated to finish it up as a full-out 64DD game&quot;.

== iQue Player ==
The iQue Player was a handheld TV game Nintendo 64 system that released only in China on November 17, 2003, after China banned video game consoles. The games that were released in the iQue Player&#x27;s lifetime (from 2003 to 2016) are &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time&quot;, &quot;Mario Kart 64&quot;, &quot;Wave Race 64&quot;, &quot;Star Fox 64&quot;, &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Story&quot;, &quot;Paper Mario&quot;, &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot;, &quot;F-Zero X&quot;, &quot;Dr. Mario 64&quot;, &quot;Excitebike 64&quot;, &quot;Sin and Punishment&quot;, &quot;Custom Robo&quot; and &quot;Animal Crossing&quot;.

== Reception ==
===Critical reception===
The Nintendo 64 received acclaim from critics. Reviewers praised the console&#x27;s advanced 3D graphics and gameplay, while criticizing the lack of games. On G4techTV&#x27;s &quot;Filter&quot;, the Nintendo 64 was voted up to No. 1 by registered users.

In February 1996, &quot;Next Generation&quot; magazine called the Nintendo Ultra 64 the &quot;best kept secret in videogames&quot; and the &quot;world&#x27;s most powerful game machine&quot;. It called the system&#x27;s November 24, 1995, unveiling at Shoshinkai &quot;the most anticipated videogaming event of the 1990s, possibly of all time&quot;. Previewing the Nintendo 64 shortly prior to its launch, &quot;Time&quot; magazine praised the realistic movement and gameplay provided by the combination of fast graphics processing, pressure-sensitive controller, and the &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; game. The review praised the &quot;fastest, smoothest game action yet attainable via joystick at the service of equally virtuoso motion&quot;, where &quot;[f]or once, the movement on the screen feels real&quot;. Asked if consumers should buy a Nintendo 64 at launch, buy it later, or buy a competing system, a panel of six &quot;GamePro&quot; editors voted almost unanimously to buy at launch; one editor said consumers who already own a PlayStation and are on a limited budget should buy it later, and all others should buy it at launch.

At launch, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called the system &quot;quite simply, the fastest, most graceful game machine on the market&quot;. Its form factor was described as small, light, and &quot;built for heavy play by kids&quot; unlike the &quot;relatively fragile Sega Saturn&quot;. Showing concern for a major console product launch during a sharp, several-year long, decline in the game console market, the review said that the long-delayed Nintendo 64 was &quot;worth the wait&quot; in the company&#x27;s pursuit of quality. Although the &quot;Times&quot; expressed concerns about having only two launch games at retail and twelve expected by Christmas, this was suggested to be part of Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;penchant for perfection&quot;, as &quot;while other platforms offer quite a bit of junk, Nintendo routinely orders game developers back to the boards to fix less-than-perfect titles&quot;. Describing the quality control incentives associated with cartridge-based development, the &quot;Times&quot; cited Nintendo&#x27;s position that cartridge game developers tend to &quot;place a premium on substance over flash&quot;, and noted that the launch games lack the &quot;poorly acted live-action sequences or half-baked musical overtures&quot; which it says tend to be found on CD-ROM games. Praising Nintendo&#x27;s controversial choice of the cartridge medium with its &quot;nonexistent&quot; load times and &quot;continuous, fast-paced action CD-ROMs simply cannot deliver&quot;, the review concluded that &quot;the cartridge-based Nintendo 64 delivers blistering speed and tack-sharp graphics that are unheard of on personal computers and make competing 32-bit, disc-based consoles from Sega and Sony seem downright sluggish&quot;.

&quot;Time&quot; named it the 1996 Machine of the Year, saying the machine had &quot;done to video-gaming what the 707 did to air travel&quot;. The magazine said the console achieved &quot;the most realistic and compelling three-dimensional experience ever presented by a computer&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; credited the Nintendo 64 with revitalizing the video game market, &quot;rescuing this industry from the dustbin of entertainment history&quot;. The magazine suggested that the Nintendo 64 would play a major role in introducing children to digital technology in the final years of the 20th century. The article concluded by saying the console had already provided &quot;the first glimpse of a future where immensely powerful computing will be as common and easy to use as our televisions&quot;. The console also won the 1996 Spotlight Award for Best New Technology.

&quot;Popular Electronics&quot; complimented the system&#x27;s hardware, calling its specifications &quot;quite impressive&quot;. It found the controller &quot;comfortable to hold, and the controls to be accurate and responsive&quot;.

In a 1997 year-end review, a team of five &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; editors gave the Nintendo 64 scores of 8.0, 7.0, 7.5, 7.5, and 9.0. They highly praised the power of the hardware and the quality of the first-party games, especially those developed by Rare&#x27;s and Nintendo&#x27;s internal studios, but also commented that the third-party output to date had been mediocre and the first-party output was not enough by itself to provide Nintendo 64 owners with a steady stream of good games or a full breadth of genres. &quot;Next Generation&quot;″s end of 1997 review expressed similar concern about third party support, while also noting signs that the third party output was improving, and speculated that the Nintendo 64&#x27;s arrival late in its generation could lead to an early obsolescence when Sony and Sega&#x27;s successor consoles launched. However, they said that for some, Nintendo&#x27;s reliably high-quality software would outweigh those drawbacks, and gave the system 3 1/2 out of 5 stars.

Developer Factor 5, which created some of the system&#x27;s most technologically advanced games along with the system&#x27;s audio development tools for Nintendo, said, &quot;[T]he N64 is really sexy because it combines the performance of an SGI machine with a cartridge. We&#x27;re big arcade fans, and cartridges are still the best for arcade games or perhaps a really fast CD-ROM. But there&#x27;s no such thing for consoles yet [as of 1998]&quot;.

=== Sales ===
The Nintendo 64 was highly successful in the North America region; conversely, sales proved to be underwhelming in the domestic Japanese and in European markets. Nintendo reported that the system&#x27;s vintage hardware and software sales had ceased by 2004, three years after the GameCube&#x27;s launch; as of December 31, 2009, the Nintendo 64 had yielded a lifetime total of 5.54 million system units sold in Japan, 20.63 million in the Americas, and 6.75 million in other regions, for a total of 32.93 million units.

==== North America ====
The Nintendo 64 was in heavy demand upon its release. David Cole, industry analyst, said &quot;You have people fighting to get it from stores&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; called the purchasing interest &quot;that rare and glorious middle-class Cabbage Patch-doll frenzy&quot;. The magazine said celebrities Matthew Perry, Steven Spielberg, and Chicago Bulls players called Nintendo to ask for special treatment to get their hands on the console. The console had only two launch games, with &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; as its killer app.

During the system&#x27;s first three days on the market, retailers sold 350,000 of 500,000 available console units. During its first four months, the console yielded 500,000 unit sales in North America. Nintendo successfully outsold Sony and Sega early in 1997 in the United States; and by the end of its first full year, 3.6 million units were sold in the United States. &quot;BusinessWire&quot; reported that the Nintendo 64 was responsible for Nintendo&#x27;s sales having increased by 156% by 1997. Five different Nintendo 64 games exceeded 1 million in sales during 1997.

After a strong launch year, the decision to use the cartridge format is said to have contributed to the diminished release pace and higher price of games compared to the competition, and thus Nintendo was unable to maintain its lead in the United States. The console would continue to outsell the Sega Saturn throughout the generation, but would trail behind the PlayStation.

Nintendo&#x27;s efforts to attain dominance in the key 1997 holiday shopping season were also hurt by game delays. Five high-profile Nintendo games slated for release by Christmas 1997 (&quot;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time&quot;, &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot;, &quot;Conker&#x27;s Quest&quot;, &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Story&quot;, and &quot;Major League Baseball Featuring Ken Griffey Jr.&quot;) were delayed until 1998, and &quot;Diddy Kong Racing&quot; was announced at the last minute in an effort to somewhat fill the gaps. In an effort to take the edge off of the console&#x27;s software pricing disadvantage, Nintendo worked to lower manufacturing costs for Nintendo 64 cartridges, and leading into the 1997 holiday shopping season announced a new pricing structure which amounted to a roughly 15% price cut on both first-party and third-party games. Response from third-party publishers was positive, with key third-party publisher Capcom saying the move led them to reconsider their decision not to publish games for the console.

==== Japan ====
In Japan, the console was not as successful, failing to outsell the PlayStation and the Sega Saturn. Benimaru Itō, a developer for &quot;Mother 3&quot; and friend of Shigeru Miyamoto, speculated in 1997 that the Nintendo 64&#x27;s lower popularity in Japan was due to the lack of role-playing video games. Nintendo CEO Hiroshi Yamauchi also said the console&#x27;s lower popularity in Japan was most likely due to lack of role-playing games, and the small number of games being released in general. The higher price of cartidges as opposed to CD-ROM has also been cited as a reason for the system&#x27;s lackluster third-party support, which led to domestically big titles, such as &quot;Dragon Quest VII&quot;, moving away from Nintendo&#x27;s platforms to its rivals.

Shigeru Miyamoto commented at the time that the Nintendo 64&#x27;s situation in Japan was grim and that it was also tough in Europe, but that these were overcome by its success in America and therefore &quot;the business has become completely viable&quot;.

=== Legacy ===
The Nintendo 64 is one of the most recognized video game systems in history, Designed in tandem with the controller, &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; and &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time&quot; are widely considered by critics and the public to be two of the greatest and most influential games of all time. &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; is one of the most influential games for the shooter genre.

The Aleck 64 is a Nintendo 64 design in arcade form, designed by Seta in cooperation with Nintendo, and sold from 1998 to 2003 only in Japan.

<text>GNU nano is a text editor for Unix-like computing systems or operating environments using a command line interface. It emulates the Pico text editor, part of the Pine email client, and also provides additional functionality. Unlike Pico, nano is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL). Released as free software by Chris Allegretta in 1999, nano became part of the GNU Project in 2001. The logo resembles the lowercase form of the Greek letter Eta (η).

==History==
GNU nano was first created in 1999 with the name &quot;TIP&quot; (a recursive acronym for &quot;TIP Isn&#x27;t Pico&quot;), by Chris Allegretta. His motivation was to create a free software replacement for Pico, which was not distributed under a free-software license. The name was changed to nano on January 10, 2000, to avoid a naming conflict with the existing Unix utility &quot;tip&quot;. The name comes from the system of SI prefixes, in which nano is 1000 times larger than pico. In February 2001, nano became a part of the GNU Project.

GNU nano implements several features that Pico lacks, including syntax highlighting, line numbers, regular expression search and replace, line-by-line scrolling, multiple buffers, indenting groups of lines, rebindable key support, and the undoing and redoing of edit changes.

On 11 August 2003, Chris Allegretta officially handed the source code maintenance of nano to David Lawrence Ramsey. On 20 December 2007, with the release of 2.0.7, Ramsey stepped down as nano&#x27;s maintainer. The license was also upgraded to GPL-3.0-or-later. The project is currently maintained by Benno Schulenberg.

On version 2.6.0 in June 2016, the current principal developer and the other active members of the nano project decided in consensus to leave the GNU Project, because of their objections over the Free Software Foundation&#x27;s copyright assignment policy, and their belief that decentralized copyright ownership does not impede the ability to enforce the GNU General Public License. The step was acknowledged by Debian and Arch Linux, while the GNU Project resisted the move and called it a &quot;fork&quot;. On 19 August 2016, Chris Allegretta announced the return of the project to the GNU family, following concessions from GNU on copyright assignment for Nano specifically, which happened when version 2.7.0 was released in September 2016.

==Control keys==
GNU nano, like Pico, is keyboard-oriented, controlled with control keys. For example, saves the current file; goes to the search menu. GNU nano puts a two-line &quot;shortcut bar&quot; at the bottom of the screen, listing many of the commands available in the current context. For a complete list, gets the help screen.

Unlike Pico, nano uses meta keys to toggle its behavior. For example, toggles smooth scrolling mode on and off. Almost all features that can be selected from the command line can be dynamically toggled. On keyboards without the meta key it is often mapped to the escape key, , such that in order to simulate, say, one has to press the key, then release it, and then press the key.

GNU nano can also use pointing devices, such as a mouse, to activate functions that are on the shortcut bar, as well as position the cursor.

<text>The Nieuwe Waterweg (&quot;New Waterway&quot;) is a ship canal in the Netherlands from het Scheur (a branch of the Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt delta) west of the town of Maassluis to the North Sea at Hook of Holland: the Maasmond, where the Nieuwe Waterweg connects to the Maasgeul. It is the artificial mouth of the river Rhine.

The Nieuwe Waterweg, which opened in 1872 and has a length of approximately , was constructed to keep the city and port of Rotterdam accessible to seafaring vessels as the natural Meuse-Rhine branches silted up. The Waterway is a busy shipping route since it is the primary access to one of the busiest ports in the world, the Port of Rotterdam. At the entrance to the sea, a flood protection system called Maeslantkering has been installed (completed in 1997). There are no bridges or tunnels across the Nieuwe Waterweg.

==History==
By the middle of the 19th century, Rotterdam was already one of the largest port cities in the world, mainly because of transshipment of goods from Germany to Great Britain. The increase in shipping traffic created a capacity problem: there were too many branches in the river delta, making the port difficult to reach.

In 1863, a law was passed that allowed for the provision of a new canal for large ocean-going ships from Rotterdam to the North Sea. Hydraulic engineer Pieter Caland was commissioned to design a canal cutting through the &quot;Hook of Holland” and to extend the Mouth of Rhine to the sea. The designs for this were already done back in 1731 by Nicolaas Samuelsz Cruquius but the implementation could no longer be postponed to prevent the decline of the harbour of Rotterdam.

Construction began on 31 October 1863. The first phase consisted of the expropriation of farm lands from Rozenburg to Hook of Holland.

During the second phase two dikes were built parallel to each other, which took 2 years. Caland proposed to extend the dikes 2 km into the sea to disrupt the coastal sea currents and decrease silt deposits in the shipping lane.

Upon the completion of the dikes, the third phase began by the digging of the actual waterway. This began on 31 October 1866 and was completed three years later. The large amounts of removed soil were in turn used to reinforce other dams and dikes.

The last phase consisted of the removal of the dam separating the new waterway from the sea and river. In 1872, the Nieuwe Waterweg was completed and Rotterdam was easily accessible.

Because of the currents and erosion, the shipping lane has been widened somewhat. Yet because of the draft of today&#x27;s supertankers, it needs to be dredged constantly.

In 1997, the last part of the Delta Works, the Maeslantkering, was put in operation near the mouth of the Nieuwe Waterweg. This storm surge barrier protects Rotterdam against north westerly Beaufort Force 10 to 12 storms.

==Current situation==
The Nieuwe Waterweg gives the Port of Rotterdam its deep-water access to the North Sea. From Hook of Holland it stretches for approximately where the waterway continues as the Nieuwe Maas. The very first Nieuwe Waterweg—a breach through the dunes at Hook of Holland—was only long, but in around 1877 the channel was made much larger and wider and the current Nieuwe Waterweg was created. Currently the width of the channel is between and it is dredged to a depth of below Amsterdam Ordnance Datum.

It is this channel, together with the dredged channels in the North Sea, Maasgeul and Eurogeul, that allows ships like the MS &quot;Berge Stahl&quot; and MV &quot;Vale Rio de Janeiro&quot; (both with a draught of 23 meters) to enter Europoort.

The Dutch government agency Rijkswaterstaat is responsible for maintaining the channel.

==Maasmond==
The point where the Nieuwe Waterweg enters into the North Sea, between Hook of Holland on the north bank and the Maasvlakte to the south, is called the Maasmond. It is marked with two navigation light-towers called the Paddestoelen (&quot;mushrooms&quot;). The Nieuwe Waterweg connects, in the North Sea, to the Maasgeul. This dredged channel in the North Sea is being widened to to facilitate the largest container vessels for the new Maasvlakte 2 that opened in 2013.

<text>Neijia () is the collective name for the internal Chinese martial arts. It relates to those martial arts occupied with spiritual, mental or &quot;qi&quot;-related aspects, as opposed to an &quot;external&quot; approach focused on physiological aspects. The distinction dates to the 17th century, but its modern application is due to publications by Sun Lutang, dating to the period of 1915 to 1928. &quot;Neijin&quot; is developed by using &quot;neigong&quot; or &quot;internal changes&quot;, contrasted with &quot;waigong&quot; (; &quot;wàigōng&quot;) or &quot;external exercises&quot; .

&quot;Wudangquan&quot; is a more specific grouping of internal martial arts named for their association in popular Chinese legend with the Taoist monasteries of the Wudang Mountains in Hubei province. These styles were enumerated by Sun Lutang as tai chi, &quot;xingyiquan&quot; and &quot;baguazhang&quot;, but most also include &quot;bajiquan&quot; and the legendary Wudang Sword.

Some other Chinese arts, not in the wudangquan group, such as &quot;qigong&quot;, &quot;liuhebafa&quot;, &quot;Bak Mei Pai&quot;, &quot;ziranmen&quot; (Nature Boxing), &quot;Bok Foo Pai&quot; and &quot;yiquan&quot; are frequently classified (or classify themselves) as &quot;internal&quot;.

==History==
===Qing China===
The term &quot;neijia&quot; and the distinction between internal and external martial arts first appears in Huang Zongxi&#x27;s 1669 &quot;Epitaph for Wang Zhengnan&quot;. Stanley Henning proposes that the &quot;Epitaph&quot; identification of the internal martial arts with the Taoism indigenous to China and of the external martial arts with the foreign Buddhism of Shaolin—and the Manchu Qing Dynasty to which Huang Zongxi was opposed—was an act of political defiance rather than one of technical classification.

In 1676 Huang Zongxi&#x27;s son, Huang Baijia, who learned martial arts from Wang Zhengnan, compiled the earliest extant manual of internal martial arts, the &quot;Neijia Quanfa&quot;.

===Republic of China===
Beginning in 1914, Sun Lutang together with Yang Shaohou, Yang Chengfu and Wu Jianquan taught tai chi to the public at the Beijing Physical Education Research Institute. Sun taught there until 1928, a seminal period in the development of modern Yang, Wu and Sun-style tai chi. Sun Lutang also published martial arts texts starting in 1915.

In 1928, Kuomintang generals Li Jinglin, Chang Chih-chiang, and Fung Zuziang organized a national martial arts tournament in China; they did so to screen the best martial artists in order to begin building the Central Guoshu Institute. The generals separated the participants of the tournament into Shaolin and Wudang. Wudang participants were recognized as having &quot;internal&quot; skills. These participants were generally practitioners of tai chi, &quot;xingyiquan&quot; and &quot;baguazhang&quot;. All other participants competed under the classification of Shaolin. One of the winners in the &quot;internal&quot; category was the &quot;baguazhang&quot; master Fu Zhensong.

==Sun Lutang==
Sun Lutang identified the following as the criteria that distinguish an internal martial art:
# An emphasis on the use of the mind to coordinate the leverage of the relaxed body as opposed to the use of strength.
# The internal development, circulation, and expression of &quot;qi&quot;, the &quot;vital energy&quot; of classical Chinese philosophy.
# The application of Taoist &quot;daoyin&quot;, &quot;qigong&quot;, and &quot;neigong&quot; principles of external movement.

Sun Lutang&#x27;s eponymous style of tai chi fuses principles from all three arts he named as &quot;neijia&quot;. Similarities applying classical principles between tai chi, &quot;xingyi&quot;, and &quot;baquazhang&quot; include: Loosening (song) the soft tissue, opening shoulder and hip gates or &quot;gua&quot;, cultivating &quot;qi&quot; or intrinsic energy, issuing various &quot;jin&quot; or compounded energies. Tai chi is characterized by an ever-present &quot;peng jin&quot; or expanding energy. &quot;Xingyiquan&quot; is characterized by its solely forward moving pressing &quot;ji jin&quot; energy. &quot;Baguazhang&quot; is characterized by its &quot;dragon body&quot; circular movements. Some Chinese martial arts other than the ones Sun named also teach what are termed internal practices, despite being generally classified as external (e.g. Wing Chun that also is internal ). Some non-Chinese martial arts also claim to be internal, for example Aikido and Kito Ryu. Many martial artists, especially outside of China, disregard the distinction entirely. Some &quot;neijia&quot; schools refer to their arts as &quot;soft style&quot; martial arts.

==Training==

Internal styles focus on awareness of the spirit, mind, &quot;qi&quot; and the use of relaxed ( ) leverage rather than muscular tension. Pushing hands is a training method commonly used in &quot;neijia&quot; arts to develop sensitivity and softness.

Much time may nevertheless be spent on basic physical training, such as stance training (&quot;zhan zhuang&quot;), stretching and strengthening of muscles, as well as on empty hand and weapon forms which can be quite demanding.

Some forms in internal styles are performed slowly, although some include sudden outbursts of explosive movements (&quot;fa jin&quot;), such as those the Chen style of tai chi is famous for teaching earlier than some other styles (e.g. Yang and Wu). The reason for the generally slow pace is to improve coordination and balance by increasing the work load, and to require the student to pay minute attention to their whole body and its weight as they perform a technique. At an advanced level, and in actual fighting, internal styles are performed quickly, but the goal is to learn to involve the entire body in every motion, to stay relaxed, with deep, controlled breathing, and to coordinate the motions of the body and the breathing accurately according to the dictates of the forms while maintaining perfect balance.

==Characteristics==

External styles are characterized by fast and explosive movements and a focus on physical strength and agility. External styles include both the traditional styles focusing on application and fighting, as well as the modern styles adapted for competition and exercise. Examples of external styles are Shaolin kung fu, with its direct explosive attacks and many &quot;wushu&quot; forms that have spectacular aerial techniques. External styles begin with a training focus on muscular power, speed and application, and generally integrate their &quot;qigong&quot; aspects in advanced training, after their desired &quot;hard&quot; physical level has been reached.

Currently, some people believe that there is no difference between &quot;internal&quot; and &quot;external&quot; systems of the Chinese martial arts, while other well known teachers have expressed differing opinions. For example, the tai chi teacher Wu Jianquan:

Those who practice [Shaolin kung fu] leap about with strength and force; people not proficient at this kind of training soon lose their breath and are exhausted. Tai chi is unlike this. Strive for quiescence of body, mind and intention.

==Current practice==

Many internal schools teach forms that are practised for health benefits only. Thus, tai chi in spite of its roots in martial arts has become similar in scope to &quot;qigong&quot;, the purely meditative practice based on notions of circulation of &quot;qi&quot;. As a health practice, tai chi classes have become popular in hospitals, clinics, community and senior centers as the art&#x27;s reputation as a low-stress exercise for seniors became better known.

Traditionalists feel that a school not teaching martial aspects somewhere in their syllabus cannot be said to be actually teaching the art itself, that they have accredited themselves prematurely. Traditional teachers also believe that understanding the core theoretical principles of &quot;neijia&quot; and the ability to apply them are a necessary gateway to health benefits.

==Fiction==
Internal styles have been associated in legend and in much popular fiction with the Taoist monasteries of the Wudang Mountains in central China.

&quot;Neijia&quot; are a common theme in Chinese &quot;wuxia&quot; novels and films, and are usually represented as originating in Wudang or similar mythologies. Often, genuine internal practices are highly exaggerated to the point of making them seem miraculous, as in the novels of Jin Yong and Gu Long. Internal concepts have also been a source of comedy, such as in the films &quot;Shaolin Soccer&quot; and &quot;Kung Fu Hustle&quot;.

In the &quot;Naruto&quot; series, Neji Hyūga&#x27;s name and techniques were based on &quot;neijia&quot;.

<text>Navigation is a field of study that focuses on the process of monitoring and controlling the movement of a craft or vehicle from one place to another. The field of navigation includes four general categories: land navigation, marine navigation, aeronautic navigation, and space navigation. For marine navigation, this involves the safe movement of ships, boats and other nautical craft either on or underneath the water using positions from navigation equipment with appropriate nautical charts (electronic and paper). Navigation equipment for ships is mandated under the requirements of the SOLAS Convention, depending on ship size. For aeronautic (air) navigation, this involves piloting an aircraft from one geographic position to another position while monitoring the position as the flight progresses. For land navigation, this involves the movement of persons, animals and vehicles from one place to another by means of navigation equipment (such as a compass or GNSS receivers), maps and visual navigation marks across urban or rural environments.

It is also the term of art used for the specialized knowledge used by navigators to perform navigation tasks. All navigational techniques involve locating the navigator&#x27;s position compared to known locations or patterns. Navigation, in a broader sense, can refer to any skill or study that involves the determination of position and direction. In this sense, navigation includes orienteering and pedestrian navigation.

==Etymology==
The term stems from the 1530s, from Latin &quot;navigationem&quot; (nom. &quot;navigatio&quot;), from &quot;navigatus&quot;, pp. of &quot;navigare&quot; &quot;to sail, sail over, go by sea, steer a ship,&quot; from &quot;navis&quot; &quot;ship&quot; and the root of &quot;agere&quot; &quot;to drive&quot;.

==History==
 
In the European medieval period, navigation was considered part of the set of &quot;seven mechanical arts&quot;, none of which were used for long voyages across open ocean. Polynesian navigation is probably the earliest form of open-ocean navigation; it was based on memory and observation recorded on scientific instruments like the Marshall Islands Stick Charts of Ocean Swells. Early Pacific Polynesians used the motion of stars, weather, the position of certain wildlife species, or the size of waves to find the path from one island to another.
Maritime navigation using scientific instruments such as the mariner&#x27;s astrolabe first occurred in the Mediterranean during the Middle Ages. Although land astrolabes were invented in the Hellenistic period and existed in classical antiquity and the Islamic Golden Age, the oldest record of a sea astrolabe is that of Spanish astronomer Ramon Llull dating from 1295. The perfecting of this navigation instrument is attributed to Portuguese navigators during early Portuguese discoveries in the Age of Discovery. The earliest known description of how to make and use a sea astrolabe comes from Spanish cosmographer Martín Cortés de Albacar&#x27;s &quot;Arte de Navegar&quot; (&quot;The Art of Navigation&quot;) published in 1551, based on the principle of the archipendulum used in constructing the Egyptian pyramids.

Open-seas navigation using the astrolabe and the compass started during the Age of Discovery in the 15th century. The Portuguese began systematically exploring the Atlantic coast of Africa from 1418, under the sponsorship of Prince Henry. In 1488 Bartolomeu Dias reached the Indian Ocean by this route. In 1492 the Spanish monarchs funded Christopher Columbus&#x27;s expedition to sail west to reach the Indies by crossing the Atlantic, which resulted in the Discovery of the Americas. In 1498, a Portuguese expedition commanded by Vasco da Gama reached India by sailing around Africa, opening up direct trade with Asia. Soon, the Portuguese sailed further eastward, to the Spice Islands in 1512, landing in China one year later.

The first circumnavigation of the earth was completed in 1522 with the Magellan-Elcano expedition, a Spanish voyage of discovery led by Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan and completed by Spanish navigator Juan Sebastián Elcano after the former&#x27;s death in the Philippines in 1521. The fleet of seven ships sailed from Sanlúcar de Barrameda in Southern Spain in 1519, crossed the Atlantic Ocean and after several stopovers rounded the southern tip of South America. Some ships were lost, but the remaining fleet continued across the Pacific making a number of discoveries including Guam and the Philippines. By then, only two galleons were left from the original seven. The &quot;Victoria&quot; led by Elcano sailed across the Indian Ocean and north along the coast of Africa, to finally arrive in Spain in 1522, three years after its departure. The &quot;Trinidad&quot; sailed east from the Philippines, trying to find a maritime path back to the Americas, but was unsuccessful. The eastward route across the Pacific, also known as the &quot;tornaviaje&quot; (return trip) was only discovered forty years later, when Spanish cosmographer Andrés de Urdaneta sailed from the Philippines, north to parallel 39°, and hit the eastward Kuroshio Current which took its galleon across the Pacific. He arrived in Acapulco on October 8, 1565.

==Basic concepts==

In terrestrial navigation, the location of a person, ship, plane, etc is defined as a position using a reference point/coordinates (see Cartesian coordinate system). Positions can either be referenced as latitude/longitude or a distance and direction from a fixed reference point (bearing). Lines of position can be derived from a variety of methods and equipment. By determining and monitoring positions it is possible to find and direct a person, ship, plane, etc in a scientific way from one place to another. This often involves the use of maps or charts from which if desired, courses can be calculated or followed depending on the projection or methods used (Rhumb line, Great circle, etc).

===Latitude===

Roughly, the latitude of a place on Earth is its angular distance north or south of the equator. Latitude is usually expressed in degrees (marked with °) ranging from 0° at the Equator to 90° at the North and South poles. The latitude of the North Pole is 90° N, and the latitude of the South Pole is 90° S. Mariners calculated latitude in the Northern Hemisphere by sighting the pole star (Polaris) with a sextant and using sight reduction tables to correct for height of eye and atmospheric refraction. The height of Polaris in degrees above the horizon is the latitude of the observer, within a degree or so.

===Longitude===

Similar to latitude, the longitude of a place on Earth is the angular distance east or west of the prime meridian or Greenwich meridian. Longitude is usually expressed in degrees (marked with °) ranging from 0° at the Greenwich meridian to 180° east and west. Sydney, for example, has a longitude of about 151° east. New York City has a longitude of 74° west. For most of history, mariners struggled to determine longitude. Longitude can be calculated if the precise time of a sighting is known. Lacking that, one can use a sextant to take a lunar distance (also called &quot;the lunar observation&quot;, or &quot;lunar&quot; for short) that, with a nautical almanac, can be used to calculate the time at zero longitude (see Greenwich Mean Time). Reliable marine chronometers were unavailable until the late 18th century and not affordable until the 19th century. For about a hundred years, from about 1767 until about 1850, mariners lacking a chronometer used the method of lunar distances to determine Greenwich time to find their longitude. A mariner with a chronometer could check its reading using a lunar determination of Greenwich time.

===Loxodrome===

In navigation, a rhumb line (or loxodrome) is a line crossing all meridians of longitude at the same angle, i.e. a path derived from a defined initial bearing. That is, upon taking an initial bearing, one proceeds along the same bearing, without changing the direction as measured relative to true or magnetic north.

==Methods of navigation==
Most modern navigation relies primarily on positions determined electronically by receivers collecting information from satellites. Most other modern techniques rely on finding intersecting lines of position or LOP.

A line of position can refer to two different things, either a line on a chart or a line between the observer and an object in real life. A bearing is a measure of the direction to an object. If the navigator measures the direction in real life, the angle can then be drawn on a nautical chart and the navigator will be somewhere on that bearing line on the chart.

In addition to bearings, navigators also often measure distances to objects. On the chart, a distance produces a circle or arc of position. Circles, arcs, and hyperbolae of positions are often referred to as lines of position.

If the navigator draws two lines of position, and they intersect he must be at that position. A fix is the intersection of two or more LOPs.

If only one line of position is available, this may be evaluated against the dead reckoning position to establish an estimated position.

Lines (or circles) of position can be derived from a variety of sources:
* celestial observation (a short segment of the circle of equal altitude, but generally represented as a line),
* terrestrial range (natural or man made) when two charted points are observed to be in line with each other,
* compass bearing to a charted object,
* radar range to a charted object,
* on certain coastlines, a depth sounding from echo sounder or hand lead line.

There are some methods seldom used today such as the maritime method of &quot;dipping a light&quot; to calculate the geographic range from observer to lighthouse, where the height of the lighthouse is known (from a list of lights or from a chart).

Methods of navigation have changed through history. Each new method has enhanced the mariner&#x27;s ability to complete his voyage. One of the most important judgments the navigator must make is the best method to use. Some types of navigation are depicted in the table.

The practice of navigation usually involves a combination of these different methods.

===Mental navigation checks===
By mental navigation checks, a pilot or a navigator estimates tracks, distances, and altitudes which will then help the pilot avoid gross navigation errors.

===Piloting===
Piloting (also called pilotage) involves navigating an aircraft by visual reference to landmarks, or a water vessel in restricted waters and fixing its position as precisely as possible at frequent intervals. More so than in other phases of navigation, proper preparation and attention to detail are important. Procedures vary from vessel to vessel, and between military, commercial, and private vessels. As pilotage takes place in shallow waters, it typically involves following courses to ensure sufficient under keel clearance, ensuring a sufficient depth of water below the hull as well as a consideration for squat. It may also involve navigating a ship within a river, canal or channel in close proximity to land.

A military navigation team will nearly always consist of several people. A military navigator might have bearing takers stationed at the gyro repeaters on the bridge wings for taking simultaneous bearings, while the civilian navigator on a merchant ship or leisure craft must often take and plot their position themselves, typically with the aid of electronic position fixing. While the military navigator will have a bearing book and someone to record entries for each fix, the civilian navigator will simply pilot the bearings on the chart as they are taken and not record them at all. If the ship is equipped with an ECDIS, it is reasonable for the navigator to simply monitor the progress of the ship along the chosen track, visually ensuring that the ship is proceeding as desired, checking the compass, sounder and other indicators only occasionally. If a pilot is aboard, as is often the case in the most restricted of waters, his judgement can generally be relied upon, further easing the workload. But should the ECDIS fail, the navigator will have to rely on his skill in the manual and time-tested procedures.

===Celestial navigation===

Celestial navigation systems are based on observation of the positions of the Sun, Moon, planets and navigational stars using a sextant or similar navigation instrument. By knowing which point on the rotating Earth a celestial object is above and measuring its height above the observer&#x27;s horizon, the navigator can determine his distance from that subpoint using mathematical calculation. A nautical almanac and a source of time, typically a marine chronometer are used to compute the subpoint on Earth a celestial body is over, and a sextant is used to measure the body&#x27;s angular height above the horizon. That height can then be used to compute distance from the subpoint to create a circular line of position. Alternatively sight reduction tables can be used. A navigator shoots a number of stars in succession to give a series of overlapping lines of position. Where they intersect is the celestial fix. The Moon and Sun may also be used. The Sun can also be used by itself to shoot a succession of lines of position (best done around local noon) to determine a position. Since the advent of GNSS, celestial navigation is less used for marine and air navigation, though it remains useful as a backup or as another method to cross-check the accuracy of electronic systems, particularly in the open ocean.

====Marine chronometer====
In order to accurately measure longitude, the precise time is required of a sextant sighting (down to the second, if possible) which is then recorded for subsequent calculation. Each second of error is equivalent to 15 seconds of longitude error, which at the equator is a position error of .25 of a nautical mile, about the accuracy limit of manual celestial navigation. The spring-driven marine chronometer is a precision timepiece used aboard ship to provide accurate time for celestial observations. A chronometer differs from a spring-driven watch principally in that it contains a variable lever device to maintain even pressure on the mainspring, and a special balance designed to compensate for temperature variations. A spring-driven chronometer is set approximately to Greenwich mean time (GMT) and is not reset until the instrument is overhauled and cleaned, usually at three-year intervals. The difference between GMT and chronometer time is carefully determined and applied as a correction to all chronometer readings. Spring-driven chronometers must be wound at about the same time each day.

Quartz crystal marine chronometers have replaced spring-driven chronometers onboard modern ships because of their greater accuracy. They are maintained on GMT directly from radio time signals. This eliminates chronometer error and watch error corrections. Should the second hand be in error by a readable amount, it can be reset electrically. The basic element for time generation is a quartz crystal oscillator. The quartz crystal is temperature compensated and is hermetically sealed in an evacuated envelope. A calibrated adjustment capability is provided to adjust for the aging of the crystal.

The chronometer is typically designed to operate for a minimum of one year on a single set of batteries. Observations may be timed and ship&#x27;s clocks set with a comparing watch, which is set to chronometer time and taken to the bridge wing for recording sight times. In practice, a wrist watch coordinated to the nearest second with the chronometer will be adequate. A stop watch, either spring wound or digital, may also be used for celestial observations. In this case, the watch is started at a known GMT by chronometer, and the elapsed time of each sight added to this to obtain GMT of the sight. All chronometers and watches should be checked regularly with a radio time signal. Times and frequencies of radio time signals are listed in publications such as Radio Navigational Aids.

====The marine sextant====
The second critical component of celestial navigation is to measure the angle formed at the observer&#x27;s eye between the celestial body and the sensible horizon. The sextant, an optical instrument, is used to perform this function. The sextant consists of two primary assemblies. The frame is a rigid triangular structure with a pivot at the top and a graduated segment of a circle, referred to as the &quot;arc&quot;, at the bottom. The second component is the index arm, which is attached to the pivot at the top of the frame. At the bottom is an endless vernier which clamps into teeth on the bottom of the &quot;arc&quot;. The optical system consists of two mirrors and, generally, a low power telescope. One mirror, referred to as the &quot;index mirror&quot; is fixed to the top of the index arm, over the pivot. As the index arm is moved, this mirror rotates, and the graduated scale on the arc indicates the measured angle (&quot;altitude&quot;). The second mirror, referred to as the &quot;horizon glass&quot;, is fixed to the front of the frame. One half of the horizon glass is silvered and the other half is clear. Light from the celestial body strikes the index mirror and is reflected to the silvered portion of the horizon glass, then back to the observer&#x27;s eye through the telescope. The observer manipulates the index arm so the reflected image of the body in the horizon glass is just resting on the visual horizon, seen through the clear side of the horizon glass.

There are three main errors that must be corrected in order to each usage for navigation. The main errors are perpendicular error, side error and index error. Adjustment of the sextant consists of checking and aligning all the optical elements to eliminate the overall &quot;index error&quot; (or index correction). Index correction should be checked, using the horizon or more preferably a star, each time the sextant is used. The practice of taking celestial observations from the deck of a rolling ship, often through cloud cover and with a hazy horizon, is by far the most challenging part of celestial navigation.

====Bubble octant====
Until the widespread usage of technologies such as inertial navigation systems, VHF omnidirectional range and GNSS, air navigators used the Bubble octant or bubble sextant. Using this instrument to take sights, mathematical calculations could then be carried out to determine the past position of the aircraft.

===Inertial navigation===
Inertial navigation system (INS) is a dead reckoning type of navigation system that computes its position based on motion sensors.Before actually navigating, the initial latitude and longitude and the INS&#x27;s physical orientation relative to the Earth (e.g., north and level) are established. After alignment, an INS receives impulses from motion detectors that measure (a) the acceleration along three axes (accelerometers), and (b) rate of rotation about three orthogonal axes (gyroscopes). These enable an INS to continually and accurately calculate its current latitude and longitude (and often velocity).

Advantages over other navigation systems are that, once aligned, an INS does not require outside information. An INS is not affected by adverse weather conditions and it cannot be detected or jammed. Its disadvantage is that since the current position is calculated solely from previous positions and motion sensors, its errors are cumulative, increasing at a rate roughly proportional to the time since the initial position was input. Inertial navigation systems must therefore be frequently corrected with a location &#x27;fix&#x27; from some other type of navigation system.

The first inertial system is considered to be the V-2 guidance system deployed by the Germans in 1942. However, inertial sensors are traced to the early 19th century. The advantages INSs led their use in aircraft, missiles, surface ships and submarines. For example, the U.S. Navy developed the Ships Inertial Navigation System (SINS) during the Polaris missile program to ensure a reliable and accurate navigation system to initial its missile guidance systems. Inertial navigation systems were in wide use until satellite navigation systems (GPS) became available. INSs are still in common use on submarines (since GPS reception or other fix sources are not possible while submerged) and long-range missiles but are not now widely found elsewhere.

==== Space navigation ====
Not to be confused with satellite navigation, which depends upon satellites to function, space navigation refers to the navigation of spacecraft themselves. This has historically been achieved (during the Apollo program) via a navigational computer, an Inertial navigation system, and via celestial inputs entered by astronauts which were recorded by sextant and telescope. Space rated navigational computers, like those found on Apollo and later missions, are designed to be hardened against possible data corruption from radiation. Navigation in space has three main components: the use of a suitable reference trajectory which describes the planned flight path of the spacecraft, monitoring the actual spacecraft position while the mission is in flight (orbit determination) and creating maneuvers to bring the spacecraft back to the reference trajectory as required (flight path control).

Another possibility that has been explored for deep space navigation is Pulsar navigation, which compares the X-ray bursts from a collection of known pulsars in order to determine the position of a spacecraft. This method has been tested by multiple space agencies, such as NASA and ESA.

===Electronic navigation===

====Radar navigation====
Radars can be used for navigation and marine radars are commonly fitted to ships for navigation at sea. Radar is an effective aid to navigation because it provides ranges and bearings to objects within range of the radar scanner. When a vessel (ship or boat) is within radar range of land or fixed objects (such as special radar aids to navigation and navigation marks) the navigator can take distances and angular bearings to charted objects and use these to establish arcs of position and lines of position on a chart. A fix consisting of only radar information is called a radar fix. Types of radar fixes include &quot;range and bearing to a single object,&quot; &quot;two or more bearings,&quot; &quot;tangent bearings,&quot; and &quot;two or more ranges.&quot; Radar can also be used with ECDIS as a means of position fixing with the radar image or distance/bearing overlaid onto an Electronic nautical chart.

Parallel indexing is a technique defined by William Burger in the 1957 book &quot;The Radar Observer&#x27;s Handbook&quot;. This technique involves creating a line on the screen that is parallel to the ship&#x27;s course, but offset to the left or right by some distance. This parallel line allows the navigator to maintain a given distance away from hazards. The line on the radar screen is set to a specific distance and angle, then the ship&#x27;s position relative to the parallel line is observed. This can provide an immediate reference to the navigator as to whether the ship is on or off its intended course for navigation.

Other techniques that are less used in general navigation have been developed for special situations. One, known as the &quot;contour method,&quot; involves marking a transparent plastic template on the radar screen and moving it to the chart to fix a position. Another special technique, known as the Franklin Continuous Radar Plot Technique, involves drawing the path a radar object should follow on the radar display if the ship stays on its planned course. During the transit, the navigator can check that the ship is on track by checking that the pip lies on the drawn line.

====Radio navigation====
A radio direction finder or RDF is a device for finding the direction to a radio source. Due to radio&#x27;s ability to travel very long distances &quot;over the horizon&quot;, it makes a particularly good navigation system for ships and aircraft that might be flying at a distance from land. RDFs works by rotating a directional antenna and listening for the direction in which the signal from a known station comes through most strongly. This sort of system was widely used in the 1930s and 1940s. RDF antennas are easy to spot on German World War II aircraft, as loops under the rear section of the fuselage, whereas most US aircraft enclosed the antenna in a small teardrop-shaped fairing.

In navigational applications, RDF signals are provided in the form of &quot;radio beacons&quot;, the radio version of a lighthouse. The signal is typically a simple AM broadcast of a morse code series of letters, which the RDF can tune in to see if the beacon is &quot;on the air&quot;. Most modern detectors can also tune in any commercial radio stations, which is particularly useful due to their high power and location near major cities.

Decca, OMEGA, and LORAN-C are three similar hyperbolic navigation systems. Decca was a hyperbolic low frequency radio navigation system (also known as multilateration) that was first deployed during World War II when the Allied forces needed a system which could be used to achieve accurate landings. As was the case with Loran C, its primary use was for ship navigation in coastal waters. Fishing vessels were major post-war users, but it was also used on aircraft, including a very early (1949) application of moving-map displays. The system was deployed in the North Sea and was used by helicopters operating to oil platforms.

The OMEGA Navigation System was the first truly global radio navigation system for aircraft, operated by the United States in cooperation with six partner nations. OMEGA was developed by the United States Navy for military aviation users. It was approved for development in 1968 and promised a true worldwide oceanic coverage capability with only eight transmitters and the ability to achieve a four-mile (6 km) accuracy when fixing a position. Initially, the system was to be used for navigating nuclear bombers across the North Pole to Russia. Later, it was found useful for submarines. Due to the success of the Global Positioning System the use of Omega declined during the 1990s, to a point where the cost of operating Omega could no longer be justified. Omega was terminated on September 30, 1997, and all stations ceased operation.

LORAN is a terrestrial navigation system using low frequency radio transmitters that use the time interval between radio signals received from three or more stations to determine the position of a ship or aircraft. The current version of LORAN in common use is LORAN-C, which operates in the low frequency portion of the EM spectrum from 90 to 110 kHz. Many nations are users of the system, including the United States, Japan, and several European countries. Russia uses a nearly exact system in the same frequency range, called CHAYKA. LORAN use is in steep decline, with GPS being the primary replacement. However, there are attempts to enhance and re-popularize LORAN. LORAN signals are less susceptible to interference and can penetrate better into foliage and buildings than GPS signals.

====Satellite navigation====
A GNSS allow small electronic receivers to determine their location (longitude, latitude, and altitude) within a few meters using time signals transmitted along a line of sight by radio from satellites. Positions derived can then be used with maps and charts for satellite navigation. Since the first experimental satellite was launched in 1978, GNSS have become an indispensable aid to navigation around the world, and an important tool for map-making and land surveying. GNSS also provides a precise time reference used in many applications including scientific study of earthquakes, and synchronization of telecommunications networks. Global Navigation Satellite System or GNSS is the term for satellite navigation systems that provide positioning with global coverage. The first system, GPS was developed by the United States Department of Defense and officially named NAVSTAR GPS (NAVigation Satellite Timing And Ranging Global Positioning System). The satellite constellation is managed by the United States Air Force 50th Space Wing. The cost of maintaining the system is approximately US$750 million per year, including the replacement of aging satellites, and research and development. Despite this fact, GPS is free for civilian use as a public good.

With improvements in technology and developments globally, as of 2024, there are several different operational GNSS now available for navigation by the public. These include the United States NAVSTAR Global Positioning System (GPS), the Russian GLONASS, the European Union&#x27;s Galileo positioning system and the Beidou navigation system of China. The different global systems have varying differences in accuracy but stated positions are normally in the range of between 1 and 10 metres accuracy depending on system and on that system&#x27;s satellite coverage. As a result over 100 satellites are in medium Earth orbit, transmitting signals allowing GNSS receivers to determine the receiver&#x27;s location, speed and direction. There are also several regional GNSS systems available for navigation, including the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System and the Quasi-Zenith Satellite System. However, not all GNSS receivers are capable of operating with these systems and older GNSS receivers, such as on old ships may not be capable of receiving all of the GNSS now available to users.

Modern smartphones act as personal GNSS navigators for civilians who own them. Overuse of these devices, whether in the vehicle or on foot, can lead to a relative inability to learn about navigated environments, resulting in sub-optimal navigation abilities when and if these devices become unavailable. Typically a compass is also provided to determine direction when not moving.

==== Acoustic navigation ====
Acoustic location is a method of navigation by the use of acoustic positioning systems which determine the position of an object by using sound waves. It is primarily used by submarines and ships fitted with sonar and similar transducer based technologies. Underwater acoustic positioning systems are also commonly used by divers and Remotely operated underwater vehicles, specifically the Long baseline acoustic positioning system, the Short baseline acoustic positioning system and the Ultra-short baseline acoustic positioning system.

==Navigation processes==
=== Passage planning ===

Passage planning or voyage planning is a procedure to develop a complete description of vessel&#x27;s voyage from start to finish. The plan includes leaving the dock and harbor area, the en route portion of a voyage, approaching the destination, and mooring. According to international law, a vessel&#x27;s captain is legally responsible for passage planning, however on larger vessels, the task will be delegated to the ship&#x27;s navigator.

Studies show that human error is a factor in 80 percent of navigational accidents and that in many cases the human making the error had access to information that could have prevented the accident. The practice of voyage planning has evolved from penciling lines on nautical charts to a process of risk management.

Passage planning consists of four stages: appraisal, planning, execution, and monitoring, which are specified in &quot;International Maritime Organization Resolution A.893(21), Guidelines For Voyage Planning,&quot; and these guidelines are reflected in the local laws of IMO signatory countries (for example, Title 33 of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations), and a number of professional books or publications. There are some fifty elements of a comprehensive passage plan depending on the size and type of vessel.

The appraisal stage deals with the collection of information relevant to the proposed voyage as well as ascertaining risks and assessing the key features of the voyage. This will involve considering the type of navigation required e.g. Ice navigation, the region the ship will be passing through and the hydrographic information on the route. In the next stage, the written plan is created. The third stage is the execution of the finalised voyage plan, taking into account any special circumstances which may arise such as changes in the weather, which may require the plan to be reviewed or altered. The final stage of passage planning consists of monitoring the vessel&#x27;s progress in relation to the plan and responding to deviations and unforeseen circumstances.

=== Integrated bridge systems ===

Electronic integrated bridge concepts are driving future navigation system planning. Integrated systems take inputs from various ship sensors, electronically display positioning information, and provide control signals required to maintain a vessel on a preset course. The navigator becomes a system manager, choosing system presets, interpreting system output, and monitoring vessel response.
===Ships and similar vessels===
====One day&#x27;s work in traditional navigation====
In traditional marine navigation, one day&#x27;s work in navigation is a minimal set of tasks consistent with prudent celestial navigation. The definition and processes vary on military and civilian vessels, and from ship to ship, but the traditional method takes a form resembling:
# Maintain a continuous dead reckoning plot.
# Take two or more star observations at morning twilight for a celestial fix (prudent to observe six stars).
# Morning Sun observation. Can be taken on or near prime vertical for longitude, or at any time for a line of position.
# Determine compass error by azimuth observation of the Sun.
# Computation of the interval to noon, watch time of local apparent noon, and constants for meridian or ex-meridian sights.
# Noontime meridian or ex-meridian observation of the Sun for noon latitude line. Running fix or cross with Venus line for noon fix.
# Noontime determination the day&#x27;s run and day&#x27;s set and drift.
# At least one afternoon Sun line, in case the stars are not visible at twilight.
# Determine compass error by azimuth observation of the Sun.
# Take two or more star observations at evening twilight for a celestial fix (prudent to observe six stars).

Navigation on ships is usually always conducted on the bridge. It may also take place in adjacent space, where chart tables and publications are available. However, increasingly traditional navigation processes have been replaced with technological processes for marine navigation using GNSS and marine radar.

===Land navigation===
Navigation for cars and other land-based travel typically uses maps, landmarks, and in recent times computer navigation (&quot;satnav&quot;, short for satellite navigation), as well as any means available on water.

Computerized navigation commonly relies on GPS for current location information, a navigational map database of roads and navigable routes, and uses algorithms related to the shortest path problem to identify optimal routes.

Pedestrian navigation is involved in orienteering, land navigation (military), and wayfinding.

===Underwater navigation===

Submariners, divers, remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs) and other underwater craft carry out underwater navigation by a variety of methods and processes including GNSS, radar navigation and sonar/acoustic position fixing.

===Artificial intelligence===
Artificial intelligence can be utilised to assist with planning, problem-serving and decision-making processes in navigation. This includes using AI in navigation systems such as GNSS as well as in general computing to assist with position fixing and monitoring from one position to another such as in vehicles, planes and cars.

==Standards, training and organisations==

Professional standards for navigation depend on the type of navigation and vary by country. For marine navigation, Merchant Navy deck officers are trained and internationally certified according to the STCW Convention. Leisure and amateur mariners may undertake lessons in navigation at local/regional training schools. Naval officers receive navigation training as part of their naval training.

In land navigation, courses and training is often provided to young persons as part of general or extra-curricular education. Land navigation is also an essential part of army training. Additionally, organisations such as the Scouts and DoE programme teach navigation to their students. Orienteering organisations are a type of sports that require navigational skills using a map and compass to navigate from point to point in diverse and usually unfamiliar terrain whilst moving at speed.

In aviation, pilots undertake air navigation training as part of learning to fly.

Professional organisations also assist to encourage improvements in navigation or bring together navigators in learned environments. The Royal Institute of Navigation (RIN) is a learned society with charitable status, aimed at furthering the development of navigation on land and sea, in the air and in space. It was founded in 1947 as a forum for mariners, pilots, engineers and academics to compare their experiences and exchange information. In the US, the Institute of Navigation (ION) is a non-profit professional organisation advancing the art and science of positioning, navigation and timing.

===Publications===

Numerous nautical publications are available on navigation, which are published by professional sources all over the world. In the UK, the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office, the Witherby Publishing Group and the Nautical Institute provide numerous navigational publications, including the comprehensive Admiralty Manual of Navigation.

In the US, Bowditch&#x27;s American Practical Navigator is a free available encyclopedia of navigation issued by the US Government.

==Navigation in spatial cognition==
Navigation is an essential everyday activity that involves a series of abilities that help humans and animals to locate, track, and follow paths in order to arrive at different destinations. Navigation, in spatial cognition, allows for acquiring information about the environment by using the body and landmarks of the environment as frames of references to create mental representations of our environment, also known as a cognitive map. Humans navigate by transitioning between different spaces and coordinating both egocentric and allocentric frames of reference.

Navigation can be distinguished into two sptial components: locomotion and wayfinding. Locomotion is the process of movement from one place to another, both in humans and in animals. Locomotion helps you understand an environment by moving through a space in order to create a mental representation of it. Wayfinding is defined as an active process of following or deciding upon a path between one place to another through mental representations. It involves processes such as representation, planning and decision which help to avoid obstacles, to stay on course or to regulate pace when approaching particular objects.

Navigation and wayfinding can be approached in the environmental space. According to Dan Montello’s space classification, there are four levels of space with the third being the environmental space. The environmental space represents a very large space, like a city, and can only be fully explored through movement since all objects and space are not directly visible. Also Barbara Tversky systematized the space, but this time taking into consideration the three dimensions that correspond to the axes of the human body and its extensions: above/below, front/back and left/right. Tversky ultimately proposed a fourfold classification of navigable space: space of the body, space around the body, space of navigation and space of graphics.

===Wayfinding===
There are two types of wayfinding in navigation: aided and unaided. Aided wayfinding requires a person to use various types of media, such as maps, GPS, directional signage, etc., in their navigation process which generally involves low spatial reasoning and is less cognitively demanding. Unaided wayfinding involves no such devices for the person who is navigating. Unaided wayfinding can be subdivided into a taxonomy of tasks depending on whether it is undirected or directed, which basically makes the distinction of whether there is a precise destination or not: undirected wayfinding means that a person is simply exploring an environment for pleasure without any set destination.

Directed wayfinding, instead, can be further subdivided into search vs. target approximation. Search means that a person does not know where the destination is located and must find it either in an unfamiliar environment, which is labeled as an uninformed search, or in a familiar environment, labeled as an informed search. In target approximation, on the other hand, the location of the destination is known to the navigator but a further distinction is made based on whether the navigator knows how to arrive or not to the destination. Path following means that the environment, the path, and the destination are all known which means that the navigator simply follows the path they already know and arrive at the destination without much thought. For example, when you are in your city and walking on the same path as you normally take from your house to your job or university. However, path finding means that the navigator knows where the destination is but does not know the route they have to take to arrive at the destination: you know where a specific store is but you do not know how to arrive there or what path to take. If the navigator does not know the environment, it is called path search which means that only the destination is known while neither the path nor the environment is: you are in a new city and need to arrive at the train station but do not know how to get there. Path planning, on the other hand, means that the navigator knows both where the destination is and is familiar with the environment so they only need to plan the route or path that they should take to arrive at their target. For example, if you are in your city and need to get to a specific store that you know the destination of but do not know the specific path you need to take to get there.

<text>Non-fiction (or nonfiction) is any document or media content that attempts, in good faith, to convey information only about the real world, rather than being grounded in imagination. Non-fiction typically aims to present topics objectively based on historical, scientific, and empirical information. However, some non-fiction ranges into more subjective territory, including sincerely held opinions on real-world topics.

Often referring specifically to prose writing, non-fiction is one of the two fundamental approaches to story and storytelling, in contrast to narrative fiction, which is largely populated by imaginary characters and events. Non-fiction writers can show the reasons and consequences of events, they can compare, contrast, classify, categorise and summarise information, put the facts in a logical or chronological order, infer and reach conclusions about facts, etc. They can use graphic, structural and printed appearance features such as pictures, graphs or charts, diagrams, flowcharts, summaries, glossaries, sidebars, timelines, table of contents, headings, subheadings, bolded or italicised words, footnotes, maps, indices, labels, captions, etc. to help readers find information. 

While specific claims in a non-fiction work may prove inaccurate, the sincere author aims to be truthful at the time of composition. A non-fiction account is an exercise in accurately representing a topic, and remains distinct from any implied endorsement.

==Distinctions==
The numerous narrative techniques used within fiction are generally thought inappropriate for use in non-fiction. They are still present particularly in older works, but are often muted so as not to overshadow the information within the work. Simplicity, clarity, and directness are some of the most important considerations when producing non-fiction. Audience is important in any artistic or descriptive endeavour, but it is perhaps most important in non-fiction. In fiction, the writer believes that readers will make an effort to follow and interpret an indirectly or abstractly presented progression of theme, whereas the production of non-fiction has more to do with the direct provision of information. Understanding of the potential readers&#x27; use for the work and their existing knowledge of a subject are both fundamental for effective non-fiction. Despite the claim to truth of non-fiction, it is often necessary to persuade the reader to agree with the ideas and so a balanced, coherent, and informed argument is vital. However, the boundaries between fiction and non-fiction are continually blurred and argued upon, especially in the field of biography; as Virginia Woolf said: &quot;if we think of truth as something of granite-like solidity and of personality as something of rainbow-like intangibility and reflect that the aim of biography is to weld these two into one seamless whole, we shall admit that the problem is a stiff one and that we need not wonder if biographers, for the most part failed to solve it.&quot;

Including information that the author knows to be untrue within such works is usually regarded as dishonest. Still, certain kinds of written works can legitimately be either fiction or non-fiction, such as journals of self-expression, letters, magazine articles, and other expressions of imagination. Though they are mostly either one or the other, a blend of both is also possible. Some fiction may include non-fictional elements; semi-fiction is fiction implementing a great deal of non-fiction, (such as a fictional description based on a true story). Some non-fiction may include elements of unverified supposition, deduction, or imagination for the purpose of smoothing out a narrative, but the inclusion of open falsehoods would discredit it as a work of non-fiction. The publishing and bookselling businesses sometimes use the phrase &quot;literary non-fiction&quot; to distinguish works with a more literary or intellectual bent, as opposed to the bulk of non-fiction subjects.

==Types==
Based on the author&#x27;s intention or the purpose of the content, the main genres of non-fiction are instructional, explanatory, discussion-based, report-based (non-chronological), opinion-based (persuasive) and relating (chronological recounting) non-fiction. Non-fictional works of these different genres can be created with the help of a range of structures or formats such as: 
* reference works (almanacs, encyclopaedias, atlases, bibliographies, chronicles, consumer reports, dictionaries, thesauri, business or telephone directories, handbooks, yearbooks, books of quotations, etc)
* life writings (autobiographies, biographies, confessions, diaries, logs, memoirs, epistles, letters, postcards and letter collections, epitaphs, obituaries, etc.)
* literary criticism (book reports and book reviews), art criticism, film criticism
* persuasive writing (apologias and polemics), essays and essay collections; promotional writing (brochures, pamphlets, press releases, advertorials, etc.)
* history books
* academic texts (scholarly papers including scientific papers, monographs, scientific journals, treatises, edited volumes, conference proceedings, etc.)
* news stories, editorials, letters to the editor, and opinion pieces, manifestos, notices (announcements), documentary films and factual television
* textbooks, study guides, field guides, travelogues, recipes, owner&#x27;s manuals and user guides
*self-help books, popular science books, blogs, presentations, orations, sayings
And so on. 
Common literary examples of non-fiction include expository, argumentative, functional, and opinion pieces; essays on art or literature; biographies; memoirs; journalism; and historical, scientific, technical, or economic writings (including electronic ones).

<doc id="21861" wikidata="Q534975" url="?curid=21861" title="Cryptonomicon">
<text>Cryptonomicon is a 1999 novel by American author Neal Stephenson, set in two different time periods. One group of characters are World War II–era Allied codebreakers and tactical-deception operatives affiliated with the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park (UK), and disillusioned Axis military and intelligence figures. The second narrative is set in the late 1990s, with characters that are (in part) descendants of those of the earlier time period, who employ cryptologic, telecom, and computer technology to build an underground data haven in the fictional Sultanate of Kinakuta. Their goal is to facilitate anonymous Internet banking using electronic money and (later) digital gold currency, with a long-term objective to distribute Holocaust Education and Avoidance Pod (HEAP) media for instructing genocide-target populations on defensive warfare.

==Genre and subject matter==
&quot;Cryptonomicon&quot; is closer to the genres of historical fiction and contemporary techno-thriller than to the science fiction of Stephenson&#x27;s two previous novels, &quot;Snow Crash&quot; and &quot;The Diamond Age&quot;. It features fictionalized characterizations of such historical figures as Alan Turing, Albert Einstein, Douglas MacArthur, Winston Churchill, Isoroku Yamamoto, Karl Dönitz, Hermann Göring, and Ronald Reagan, as well as some highly technical and detailed descriptions of modern cryptography and information security, with discussions of prime numbers, modular arithmetic, and Van Eck phreaking.

===Title===
According to Stephenson, the title is a play on &quot;Necronomicon&quot;, the title of a book mentioned in the stories of horror writer H. P. Lovecraft:

The novel&#x27;s Cryptonomicon, described as a &quot;cryptographer&#x27;s bible&quot;, is a fictional book summarizing America&#x27;s knowledge of cryptography and cryptanalysis. Begun by John Wilkins (the Cryptonomicon is mentioned in &quot;Quicksilver&quot;) and amended over time by William Friedman, Lawrence Waterhouse, and others, the Cryptonomicon is described by Katherine Hayles as &quot;a kind of created by a Brotherhood of Code that stretches across centuries. To know its contents is to qualify as a Morlock among the Eloi, and the elite among the elite are those gifted enough actually to contribute to it.&quot;

==Plot==
The action takes place in two periods—World War II and the late 1990s, during the Internet boom and the Asian financial crisis.

In 1942, Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse, a young United States Navy code breaker and mathematical savant, is assigned to the newly formed joint British and American Detachment 2702. This ultra-secret unit&#x27;s role is to hide the fact that Allied intelligence has cracked the German Enigma code. The detachment stages events, often behind enemy lines, that provide alternative explanations for the Allied intelligence successes. United States Marine sergeant Bobby Shaftoe, a veteran of China and Guadalcanal, serves in unit 2702, carrying out Waterhouse&#x27;s plans. At the same time, Japanese soldiers, including mining engineer Goto Dengo, a &quot;friendly enemy&quot; of Shaftoe&#x27;s, are assigned to build a mysterious bunker in the mountains in the Philippines as part of what turns out to be a literal suicide mission.

Circa 1997, Randy Waterhouse (Lawrence&#x27;s grandson) joins his old role-playing game companion Avi Halaby in a new startup, providing Pinoy-grams (inexpensive, non-real-time video messages) to migrant Filipinos via new fiber-optic cables. The Epiphyte Corporation uses this income stream to fund the creation of a data haven in the nearby fictional Sultanate of Kinakuta. Vietnam veteran Doug Shaftoe, the son of Bobby Shaftoe, and his daughter Amy do the undersea surveying for the cables and engineering work on the haven, which is overseen by Goto Furudenendu, heir-apparent to Goto Engineering. Complications arise as figures from the past reappear seeking gold or revenge.

==Characters==

===World War II storyline===

====Fictional characters====
* Sgt. Robert &quot;Bobby&quot; Shaftoe, a gung-ho, haiku-writing United States Marine Raider.
* Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse, an American cryptographer/mathematician serving as an officer in the United States Navy, although he is known to wear an Army uniform if the situation calls for it.
* Günter Bischoff, a Kapitänleutnant in the Kriegsmarine, who commands a U-boat for much of the story, and later takes command of a new, advanced submarine fueled with hydrogen peroxide.
* Rudolf &quot;Rudy&quot; von Hacklheber, a non-Nazi German mathematician and cryptographer, who spent time attending Princeton University, where he had a romantic relationship with Alan Turing and befriended Waterhouse. He seems to know more about the mysterious Societas Eruditorum than any non-member.
* Earl Comstock, a former Electrical Till Corp. executive and US Army officer, who eventually founds the NSA and becomes a key policy maker for US involvement in the Second Indochina War.
* Julieta Kivistik, a Finnish woman who assists some of the World War II characters when they find themselves stranded in Sweden, and who later gives birth to a baby boy (Günter Enoch Bobby Kivistik) whose paternity is uncertain.
* “Uncle” Otto Kivistik, Julieta&#x27;s uncle, who runs a successful smuggling ring between neutral Sweden, Finland, and the USSR during World War II.
* Mary cCmndhd (pronounced &quot;Skuhmithid&quot; and anglicized as &quot;Smith&quot;), a member of a Qwghlmian immigrant community living in Australia, who catches the attention of Lawrence Waterhouse while he is stationed in Brisbane.
* Glory Altamira, a nursing student and Bobby Shaftoe&#x27;s Filipina lover. She becomes a member of the Philippine resistance movement during the Japanese occupation. Mother of Douglas MacArthur Shaftoe.
* Karl Beck, Bischoff&#x27;s executive officer. He temporarily relieves his captain of command for an alleged mental breakdown (during which time he captures Shaftoe and Root) but later relinquishes command back to Bischoff after their entire crew is deemed expendable by their superiors.
====Historical figures====
Fictionalized versions of several historical figures appear in the World War II storyline:
* Alan Turing, the cryptographer and computer scientist, is a colleague and friend of Lawrence Waterhouse and sometime lover of Rudy von Hacklheber.
* Douglas MacArthur, the famed U.S. Army general, who takes a central role toward the end of the World War II timeline.
* Karl Dönitz, Großadmiral of the Kriegsmarine, is never actually seen as a character but issues orders to his U-boats, including the one captained by Bischoff. Bischoff threatens to reveal information about hidden war gold unless Dönitz rescinds an order to sink his submarine.
* Hermann Göring, who appears extensively in the recollections of Rudy von Hacklheber as Rudy recounts how Göring tried recruiting him as a cryptographer for the Nazis: Rudy delivers an intentionally weakened system, reserving the full system for the use of the conspiracy among the characters to locate hidden gold.
* Future United States President Ronald Reagan is depicted during his wartime service as an officer in the U.S. Army Air Corps Public Relations branch&#x27;s 1st Motion Picture Unit. He attempts to film an interview with the recuperating and morphine-addled Bobby Shaftoe, who spoils the production with his account of a giant lizard attack and his harsh criticism of General MacArthur.
* Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto&#x27;s 1943 death at the hands of U.S. Army fighter aircraft during Operation Vengeance over Bougainville Island fills an entire chapter. During his fateful flight, the Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Imperial Navy&#x27;s Combined Fleet reflects upon the failures and hubris of his Imperial Army counterparts, who persistently underestimate the cunning and ferocity of their Allied opponents in the Pacific Theatre of Operations. As his damaged transport plane completes its terminal descent, Yamamoto realizes that all of the Japanese military codes have been broken, which explains why he is &quot;on fire and hurtling through the jungle at a hundred miles per hour in a chair, closely pursued by tons of flaming junk.&quot;
* Albert Einstein brushes off a young Lawrence Waterhouse&#x27;s request for advice. During his year of undergraduate study at Princeton, Waterhouse periodically wanders the halls of the Institute for Advanced Study, randomly asking mathematicians (whose names he never remembers) for advice on how to make intricate calculations for his &quot;sprocket question,&quot; which is how he eventually meets Turing.
*Harvest, an early supercomputer built by IBM (known as &quot;ETC&quot; or &quot;Electrical Till Corp.&quot; in the novel) for the National Security Agency for cryptanalysis. The fictionalized Harvest became operational in the early 1950s, under the supervision of Earl Comstock, while the actual system was installed in 1962.

===1990s storyline===
The precise date of this storyline is not established, but the ages of characters, the technologies described, and certain date-specific references suggest that it is set in the late 1990s, at the time of the internet boom and the Asian financial crisis.

* Randall &quot;Randy&quot; Lawrence Waterhouse, eldest grandson of Lawrence and Mary Waterhouse (née cCmndhd) and an expert systems and network administrator with the Epiphyte(2) corporation. He is mentioned in Stephenson&#x27;s 2019 novel &quot;Fall,&quot; in which he has amassed a fortune that led to the creation of a charitable Foundation bearing his name. 
* Avi &quot;Avid&quot; Halaby, Randy&#x27;s business partner in Epiphyte(2), of which he is the CEO. He is descended on his mother&#x27;s side from New Mexican Crypto-Jews, which detail, while seemingly included as a pun, is explored further in &quot;The Baroque Cycle&quot;. Avi is obsessed with using technology to prevent future genocides, namely by creating a handbook of basic technology and defense practices. His nickname Avid comes from his love of role playing games.
* America &quot;Amy&quot; Shaftoe, Doug Shaftoe&#x27;s daughter (and Bobby Shaftoe&#x27;s granddaughter) who has moved from the U.S. to live with Doug in the Philippines, and who becomes Randy&#x27;s love interest.
* Dr. Hubert Kepler, a.k.a. &quot;The Dentist,&quot; predatory billionaire investment fund manager, Randy and Avi&#x27;s business rival.
* Eberhard Föhr, a member of Epiphyte(2) and an expert in biometrics.
* John Cantrell, a member of Epiphyte(2), a libertarian who is an expert in cryptography and who wrote the fictional cryptography program Ordo.
* Tom Howard, a member of Epiphyte(2), a libertarian and firearms enthusiast who is an expert in large computer installations.
* Beryl Hagen, chief financial officer of Epiphyte(2) and veteran of a dozen startups.
* Charlene, a liberal arts academic and Randy&#x27;s girlfriend at the beginning of the novel, who later moves to New Haven, Connecticut, to live and work with Dr. G.E.B. (Günter Enoch Bobby) Kivistik.
* Andrew Loeb, a former friend and now Randy&#x27;s enemy, a survivalist and neo-Luddite whose lawsuits destroyed Randy and Avi&#x27;s first start-up, and who at the time of the novel works as a lawyer for Hubert Kepler. He is referred to by Randy as &quot;Gollum,&quot; comparing him to that character in the novels of J. R. R. Tolkien.

===Both storylines===
* Goto Dengo, a lieutenant in the Imperial Japanese Army and a mining engineer involved in an Axis project to bury looted gold in the Philippines. In the present-day storyline, he is a semi-retired chief executive of a large Japanese construction company, Goto Engineering.
* Enoch Root, a mysterious, seemingly ageless former Catholic priest and physician, serving as a coast-watcher with the ANZACs during World War II, later a chaplain in the top-secret British-American &quot;Unit 2702&quot;, and an important figure in the equally mysterious &quot;Societas Eruditorum&quot;. He first appears on a Guadalcanal beach to save a badly injured Bobby Shaftoe. Hints about his longevity emerge when Root is critically injured in Norrsbruk, Sweden, and is wed to Julieta Kivistik on his &quot;death bed&quot; so that she and her unborn child can obtain British citizenship. Root is officially pronounced dead, but is slipped away, rapidly recovering after a mysterious therapeutic agent is obtained from his antique cigar box. He turns up in Manila later in 1944 and goes on to spend part of the 1950s with the National Security Agency and, by the 1990s, has been based mostly in the Philippines as a Catholic lay-worker while &quot;gadding about trying to bring Internet stuff to China.&quot; Root also appears in Stephenson&#x27;s &quot;The Baroque Cycle&quot;, which is set between 1655 and 1714, and in his 2019 novel &quot;Fall; or, Dodge in Hell&quot;, including a chapter set in late 21st-century Seattle. 
* Mr. Wing, a wartime northern Chinese slave of the Japanese in the Philippines, who went on to become a general in the Chinese army and later a senior official in the State Grid Corporation of China. Described by Enoch Root as a &quot;wily survivor of many purges,&quot; Wing is one of only two other survivors (along with Goto Dengo and a Filipino worker named Bong) of the Japanese gold burial project, and he competes with Goto and Epiphyte(2) to recover the buried treasure. Although Root and Wing do not meet during the action of the novel, Randy reflects that &quot;it is hard not to get the idea that Enoch Root and General Wing may have other reasons to be pissed off at each other.&quot;
* Douglas (Doug) MacArthur Shaftoe, son of Bobby Shaftoe and Glory Altamira, is introduced near the end of the World War II storyline as a toddler during the Liberation of Manila, when he first meets his father, who tries to explain Shaftoe family heritage, including their enthusiasm for &quot;displaying adaptability.&quot; In the modern-day story line, Doug is a retired U.S. Navy SEAL officer and Annapolis graduate, who lives in the Philippines and operates Semper Marine Services, an underwater survey business with his daughter, Amy, conducting treasure hunts as a sideline.
* Dr. Günter Enoch Bobby &quot;G.E.B.&quot; Kivistik is introduced in the modern storyline as a smug, Oxford-educated liberal-arts professor from Yale who recruits, and later seduces, Randy Waterhouse&#x27;s girlfriend, Charlene. In the World War II storyline he is the unborn son of Julieta Kivistik and one of three possible fathers (hence his unusual name) including Günter Bischoff, Enoch Root and Bobby Shaftoe. He is a minor character in &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot;, but both his [impending] birth and his participation in Charlene&#x27;s &quot;War as Text&quot; conference catalyze major plot developments.
* Mary cCmndhd Waterhouse, Randy&#x27;s Australian-born, Qwghlmian grandmother and Lawrence&#x27;s wife.

==Technical content==
Portions of &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot; contain large amounts of exposition. Several pages are spent explaining in detail some of the concepts behind cryptography and data storage security, including a description of Van Eck phreaking.

===Cryptography===
====Pontifex Cipher====
In the book, a playing-card based cipher called Pontifex is used. At Stephenson&#x27;s request, Bruce Schneier developed such a cipher, calling it Solitaire, and a precise description of Solitaire is included as an appendix. Solitaire was cryptanalyzed in 1999.

====One-time pad====
Several of the characters in the book communicate with each other through the use of one-time pads. A one-time pad (OTP) is an encryption technique that requires a single-use pre-shared key of at least the same length as the encrypted message.

The story posits a variation of the OTP technique wherein there is no pre-shared key - the key is instead generated algorithmically.

===Software===
====Finux====
He also describes computers using a fictional operating system, Finux. The name is a thinly veiled reference to Linux, a kernel originally written by the Finnish native Linus Torvalds. Stephenson changed the name so as not to be creatively constrained by the technical details of Linux-based operating systems.

===Other technology===
* Carbon arc lamp
* The Dun improved galvanic element
* Mercury acoustic delay-line computer memory

==Allusions and references from other works==
An excerpt from &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot; was originally published in the short story collection &quot;Disco 2000&quot;, edited by Sarah Champion and published in 1998. Stephenson&#x27;s subsequent work, a trio of novels dubbed &quot;The Baroque Cycle&quot;, provides part of the deep backstory to the characters and events featured in &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot;. Set in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, the novels feature ancestors of several characters in &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot;, as well as events and objects which affect the action of the later-set book. The subtext implies the existence of secret societies or conspiracies, and familial tendencies and groupings found within those darker worlds.

The short story &quot;Jipi and the Paranoid Chip&quot; takes place some time after the events of &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot;. In the story, the construction of the Crypt has triggered economic growth in Manila and Kinakuta, in which Goto Engineering, and Homa/Homer Goto, a Goto family heir, are involved. The IDTRO (&quot;Black Chamber&quot;) is also mentioned.

Stephenson&#x27;s 2019 novel, &quot;Fall; or, Dodge in Hell&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Reamde&quot; (2011), reveals that &quot;Fall&quot;, &quot;Reamde&quot;, &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot; and &quot;The Baroque Cycle&quot; are all set in the same fictional universe, with references to the Waterhouse, Shaftoe and Hacklheber families, as well as Societas Eruditorum and Epiphyte Corporation. Two &quot;Wise&quot; entities from &quot;The Baroque Cycle&quot; also appear in &quot;Fall,&quot; including Enoch Root.

Peter Thiel states in his book &quot;Zero to One&quot; that &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot; was required reading during the early days of PayPal.

==Literary significance and criticism==

According to critic Jay Clayton, the book is written for a technical or geek audience. Despite the technical detail, the book drew praise from both Stephenson&#x27;s science fiction fan base and literary critics and buyers. In Clayton&#x27;s book &quot;Charles Dickens in Cyberspace: The Afterlife of the Nineteenth Century in Postmodern Culture&quot; (2003), he calls Stephenson&#x27;s book the &quot;ultimate geek novel&quot; and draws attention to the &quot;literary-scientific-engineering-military-industrial-intelligence alliance&quot; that produced discoveries in two eras separated by fifty years, World War II and the Internet age. In July 2012, io9 included the book on its list of &quot;10 Science Fiction Novels You Pretend to Have Read&quot;.

<doc id="21862" wikidata="Q8775712" url="?curid=21862" title="In the Beginning... Was the Command Line">
<text>In the Beginning... Was the Command Line is an essay by Neal Stephenson which was originally published online in 1999 and later made available in book form (November 1999, ). The essay is a commentary on why the proprietary operating systems business is unlikely to remain profitable in the future because of competition from free software. It also analyzes the corporate/collective culture of the Microsoft, Apple Computer, and free software communities.

==Themes==
Stephenson explores the Graphical user interface (GUI) as a metaphor in terms of the increasing interposition of abstractions between humans and the actual workings of devices (in a similar manner to &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot;) and explains the beauty hackers feel in good-quality tools. He does this with a car analogy. He compares four operating systems, Mac OS by Apple Computer to a luxury European car, Windows by Microsoft to a station wagon, Linux to a free tank, and BeOS to a batmobile. Stephenson argues that people continue to buy the station wagon despite free tanks being given away, because people do not want to learn how to operate a tank; they know that the station wagon dealership has a machine shop that they can take their car to when it breaks down. Because of this attitude, Stephenson argues that Microsoft is not really a monopoly, as evidenced by the free availability of other choice OSes, but rather has simply accrued enough mindshare among the people to have them coming back. He compares Microsoft to Disney, in that both are selling a vision to their customers, who in turn &quot;want to believe&quot; in that vision.

Stephenson relays his experience with the Debian bug tracking system (#6518). He then contrasts it with Microsoft&#x27;s approach. Debian developers responded from around the world within a day. He was completely frustrated with his initial attempt to achieve the same response from Microsoft, but he concedes that his subsequent experience was satisfactory. The difference he notes is that Debian developers are personally accessible and transparently own up to defects in their OS distribution, while Microsoft pretends errors don&#x27;t exist.

==Later developments==
The essay was written before the advent of Mac OS X. A recurring theme is the full power of the command line compared with easier-to-learn graphical user interfaces (GUIs) which are described as broken mixed metaphors for &#x27;power users&#x27;. He then mentions GUIs that have traditional terminals in windows. In a Slashdot interview in 2004, in response to the question:

... have you embraced the new UNIX based MacOS X as the OS you want to use when you &quot;Just want to go to Disneyland&quot;?

he replied:
I embraced OS X as soon as it was available and have never looked back. So a lot of &quot;In the Beginning...was the Command Line&quot; is now obsolete. I keep meaning to update it, but if I&#x27;m honest with myself, I have to say this is unlikely.
With Neal Stephenson&#x27;s permission, Garrett Birkel responded to &quot;In the Beginning...was the Command Line&quot; in 2004, bringing it up to date and critically discussing Stephenson&#x27;s argument. Birkel&#x27;s response is interspersed throughout the original text, which remains untouched.

<text>Netscape Navigator is a discontinued web browser, and the original browser of the Netscape line, from versions 1 to 4.08, and 9.x. It was the flagship product of the Netscape Communications Corporation and was the dominant web browser in terms of usage share in the 1990s, but by around 2003 its user base had all but disappeared. This was partly because of Microsoft&#x27;s bundling of Internet Explorer with the Windows operating system.

The business demise of Netscape was a central premise of Microsoft&#x27;s antitrust trial, wherein the Court ruled that Microsoft&#x27;s bundling of Internet Explorer with the Windows operating system was a monopolistic and illegal business practice. The decision came too late for Netscape, however, as Internet Explorer had by then become the dominant web browser in Windows.

The Netscape Navigator web browser was succeeded by the Netscape Communicator suite in 1997. Netscape Communicator&#x27;s 4.x source code was the base for the Netscape-developed Mozilla Application Suite, which was later renamed SeaMonkey. Netscape&#x27;s Mozilla Suite also served as the base for a browser-only spinoff called Mozilla Firefox.

The Netscape Navigator name returned in 2007 when AOL announced version 9 of the Netscape series of browsers, Netscape Navigator 9. On December 28, 2007, AOL canceled its development but continued supporting the web browser with security updates until March 1, 2008. AOL allows downloading of archived versions of the Netscape Navigator web browser family.

==History and development==

===Origin===
Netscape Navigator was inspired by the success of the Mosaic web browser, which was co-written by Marc Andreessen, a part-time employee of the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois. After Andreessen graduated in 1993, he moved to California and there met Jim Clark, the recently departed founder of Silicon Graphics. Clark believed that the Mosaic browser had great commercial possibilities and provided the seed money. Soon Mosaic Communications Corporation was in business in Mountain View, California, with Andreessen as a vice-president. Since the University of Illinois was unhappy with the company&#x27;s use of the Mosaic name, the company changed its name to Netscape Communications (suggested by product manager Greg Sands) and named its flagship web browser Netscape Navigator.

Netscape announced in its first press release (October 13, 1994) that it would make Navigator available without charge to all non-commercial users, and beta versions of version 1.0 and 1.1 were freely downloadable in November 1994 and March 1995, with the full version 1.0 available in December 1994. However, two months later, the company announced that only educational and non-profit institutions could use version 1.0 at no charge.

The reversal was complete with the availability of version 1.1 beta on March 6, 1995, in which a press release states that the final 1.1 release would be available at no cost only for academic and non-profit organizational use.
The first few releases of the product were made available in &quot;commercial&quot; and &quot;evaluation&quot; versions; for example, version &quot;1.0&quot; and version &quot;1.0N&quot;. The &quot;N&quot; evaluation versions were identical to the commercial versions; the letter was intended as a reminder to people to pay for the browser once they felt they had tried it long enough and were satisfied with it. This distinction was formally dropped within a year of the initial release, and the full version of the browser continued to be made available for free online, with boxed versions available on floppy disks (and later CDs) in stores along with a period of phone support. During this era, &quot;Internet Starter Kit&quot; books were popular, and usually included a floppy disk or CD containing internet software, and this was a popular means of obtaining Netscape&#x27;s and other browsers. Email support was initially free and remained so for a year or two until the volume of support requests grew too high.

During development, the Netscape browser was known by the code name &quot;Mozilla&quot;, which became the name of a Godzilla-like cartoon dragon mascot used prominently on the company&#x27;s web site. The Mozilla name was also used as the User-Agent in HTTP requests by the browser. Other web browsers claimed to be compatible with Netscape&#x27;s extensions to HTML and therefore used the same name in their User-Agent identifiers so that web servers would send them the same pages as were sent to Netscape browsers. Mozilla is now a generic name for matters related to the open source successor to Netscape Communicator and is most identified with the browser Firefox.

===Rise of Netscape===
When the consumer Internet revolution arrived in the mid-1990s, Netscape was well-positioned to take advantage of it and the influx of new users it brought. With a good mix of features and an attractive licensing scheme that allowed free use for non-commercial purposes, the Netscape browser soon became the de facto standard, particularly on the Windows platform. Internet service providers and computer magazine publishers helped make Navigator readily available.

An innovation that Netscape introduced in 1994 was the on-the-fly display of web pages, where text and graphics appeared on the screen as the web page downloaded. Earlier web browsers would not display a page until all graphics on it had been loaded over the network connection; this meant a user might have only a blank page for several minutes. With Netscape, people using dial-up connections could begin reading the text of a web page within seconds of entering a web address, even before the rest of the text and graphics had finished downloading. This made the web much more tolerable to the average user.

Through the late 1990s, Netscape made sure that Navigator remained the technical leader among web browsers. New features included cookies, frames, proxy auto-config, and JavaScript (in version 2.0). Although those and other innovations eventually became open standards of the W3C and ECMA and were emulated by other browsers, they were often viewed as controversial. Netscape, according to critics, was more interested in bending the web to its own de facto &quot;standards&quot; (bypassing standards committees and thus marginalizing the commercial competition) than it was in fixing bugs in its products. Consumer rights advocates were particularly critical of cookies and of commercial web sites using them to invade individual privacy.

In the marketplace, however, these concerns made little difference. Netscape Navigator remained the market leader with more than 50% usage share. The browser software was available for a wide range of operating systems, including Windows (3.1, 95, 98, NT), Macintosh, Linux, OS/2, and many versions of Unix including OSF/1, Sun Solaris, BSD/OS, IRIX, AIX, and HP-UX, and looked and worked nearly identically on every one of them. Netscape began to experiment with prototypes of a web-based system, known internally as &quot;Constellation&quot;, which would allow users to access and edit their files anywhere across a network no matter what computer or operating system they happened to be using.

Industry observers forecast the dawn of a new era of connected computing. The underlying operating system, it was believed, would not be an important consideration; future applications would run within a web browser. This was seen by Netscape as a clear opportunity to entrench Navigator at the heart of the next generation of computing, and thus gain the opportunity to expand into all manner of other software and service markets.

===Decline===

With the success of Netscape showing the importance of the web (more people were using the Internet due in part to the ease of using Netscape), Internet browsing began to be seen as a potentially profitable market. Following Netscape&#x27;s lead, Microsoft started a campaign to enter the web browser software market. Like Netscape before them, Microsoft licensed the Mosaic source code from Spyglass, Inc. (which in turn licensed code from University of Illinois). Using this basic code, Microsoft created Internet Explorer (IE).

The competition between Microsoft and Netscape dominated the browser wars. Internet Explorer, Version 1.0 (shipped in the Internet Jumpstart Kit in Microsoft Plus! For Windows 95) and IE, Version 2.0 (the first cross-platform version of the web browser, supporting both Windows and Mac OS) were thought by many to be inferior and primitive when compared to contemporary versions of Netscape Navigator. With the release of IE version 3.0 (1996) Microsoft was able to catch up with Netscape competitively, with IE Version 4.0 (1997) further improvement in terms of market share. IE 5.0 (1999) improved stability and took significant market share from Netscape Navigator for the first time.

There were two versions of Netscape Navigator 3.0, the Standard Edition and the Gold Edition. The latter consisted of the Navigator browser with e-mail, news readers, and a WYSIWYG web page compositor; however, these extra functions enlarged and slowed the software, rendering it prone to crashing.

This Gold Edition was renamed Netscape Communicator starting with version 4.0; the name change diluted its name-recognition and confused users. Netscape CEO James L. Barksdale insisted on the name change because Communicator was a general-purpose &quot;client&quot; application, which contained the Navigator &quot;browser&quot;.

The aging Netscape Communicator 4.x was slower than Internet Explorer 5.0. Typical web pages had become heavily illustrated, often JavaScript-intensive, and encoded with HTML features designed for specific purposes but now employed as global layout tools (HTML tables, the most obvious example of this, were especially difficult for Communicator to render). The Netscape browser, once a solid product, became crash-prone and buggy; for example, some versions re-downloaded an entire web page to re-render it when the browser window was re-sized (a nuisance to dial-up users), and the browser would usually crash when the page contained simple Cascading Style Sheets, as proper support for CSS never made it into Communicator 4.x. At the time that Communicator 4.0 was being developed, Netscape had a competing technology called JavaScript Style Sheets. Near the end of the development cycle, it became obvious that CSS would prevail, so Netscape quickly implemented a CSS to JSSS converter, which then processed CSS as JSSS (this is why turning JavaScript off also disabled CSS). Moreover, Netscape Communicator&#x27;s browser interface design appeared dated in comparison to Internet Explorer and interface changes in Microsoft and Apple&#x27;s operating systems.

By the end of the decade, Netscape&#x27;s web browser had lost dominance over the Windows platform, and the August 1997 Microsoft financial agreement to invest $150 million in Apple Computer required that Apple make Internet Explorer the default web browser in new Mac OS distributions. The latest IE Mac release at that time was Internet Explorer version 3.0 for Macintosh, but Internet Explorer 4 was released later that year.

Microsoft succeeded in having ISPs and PC vendors distribute Internet Explorer to their customers instead of Netscape Navigator, mostly due to Microsoft using its leverage from Windows OEM licenses, and partly aided by Microsoft&#x27;s investment in making IE brandable, such that a customized version of IE could be offered. Also, web developers used proprietary, browser-specific extensions in web pages. Both Microsoft and Netscape did this, having added many proprietary HTML tags to their browsers, which forced users to choose between two competing and almost incompatible web browsers.

In March 1998, Netscape released most of the development code base for Netscape Communicator under an open source license. Only pre-alpha versions of Netscape 5 were released before the open source community decided to scrap the Netscape Navigator codebase entirely and build a new web browser around the Gecko layout engine which Netscape had been developing but which had not yet incorporated. The community-developed open source project was named &quot;Mozilla&quot;, Netscape Navigator&#x27;s original code name. America Online bought Netscape; Netscape programmers took a pre-beta-quality form of the Mozilla codebase, gave it a new GUI, and released it as Netscape 6. This did nothing to win back users, who continued to migrate to Internet Explorer. After the release of Netscape 7 and a long public beta test, Mozilla 1.0 was released on June 5, 2002. The same code-base, notably the Gecko layout engine, became the basis of independent applications, including Firefox and Thunderbird.

On December 28, 2007, the Netscape developers announced that AOL had canceled development of Netscape Navigator, leaving it unsupported as of March 1, 2008. Archived and unsupported versions of the browser remain available for download.

==Legacy==
Netscape&#x27;s contributions to the web include JavaScript, which was submitted as a new standard to Ecma International. The resultant ECMAScript specification allowed JavaScript support by multiple web browsers and its use as a cross-browser scripting language, long after Netscape Navigator itself had dropped in popularity. Another example is the FRAME tag, which is widely supported today, and that has been incorporated into official web standards such as the &quot;HTML 4.01 Frameset&quot; specification.

In a 2007 &quot;PC World&quot; column, the original Netscape Navigator was considered the &quot;best tech product of all time&quot; due to its impact on the Internet.

<text>A neurotransmitter is a signaling molecule secreted by a neuron to affect another cell across a synapse. The cell receiving the signal, or target cell, may be another neuron, but could also be a gland or muscle cell.

Neurotransmitters are released from synaptic vesicles into the synaptic cleft where they are able to interact with neurotransmitter receptors on the target cell. Some neurotransmitters are also stored in large dense core vesicles. The neurotransmitter&#x27;s effect on the target cell is determined by the receptor it binds to. Many neurotransmitters are synthesized from simple and plentiful precursors such as amino acids, which are readily available and often require a small number of biosynthetic steps for conversion.

Neurotransmitters are essential to the function of complex neural systems. The exact number of unique neurotransmitters in humans is unknown, but more than 100 have been identified. Common neurotransmitters include glutamate, GABA, acetylcholine, glycine, dopamine and norepinephrine.

==Mechanism and cycle==
===Synthesis===

Neurotransmitters are generally synthesized in neurons and are made up of, or derived from, precursor molecules that are found abundantly in the cell. Classes of neurotransmitters include amino acids, monoamines, and peptides. Monoamines are synthesized by altering a single amino acid. For example, the precursor of serotonin is the amino acid tryptophan. Peptide neurotransmitters, or neuropeptides, are protein transmitters which are larger than the classical small-molecule neurotransmitters and are often released together to elicit a modulatory effect. Purine neurotransmitters, like ATP, are derived from nucleic acids. Metabolic products such as nitric oxide and carbon monoxide have also been reported to act like neurotransmitters.
===Storage===
Neurotransmitters are generally stored in synaptic vesicles, clustered close to the cell membrane at the axon terminal of the presynaptic neuron. However, some neurotransmitters, like the metabolic gases carbon monoxide and nitric oxide, are synthesized and released immediately following an action potential without ever being stored in vesicles.

===Release===

Generally, a neurotransmitter is released via exocytosis at the presynaptic terminal in response to an electrical signal called an action potential in the presynaptic neuron. However, low-level &quot;baseline&quot; release also occurs without electrical stimulation. Neurotransmitters are released into and diffuse across the synaptic cleft, where they bind to specific receptors on the membrane of the postsynaptic neuron.

===Receptor interaction===

After being released into the synaptic cleft, neurotransmitters diffuse across the synapse where they are able to interact with receptors on the target cell. The effect of the neurotransmitter is dependent on the identity of the target cell&#x27;s receptors present at the synapse. Depending on the receptor, binding of neurotransmitters may cause excitation, inhibition, or modulation of the postsynaptic neuron.

===Elimination===
In order to avoid continuous activation of receptors on the post-synaptic or target cell, neurotransmitters must be removed from the synaptic cleft. Neurotransmitters are removed through one of three mechanisms:

# Diffusion – neurotransmitters drift out of the synaptic cleft, where they are absorbed by glial cells. These glial cells, usually astrocytes, absorb the excess neurotransmitters.
#* Astrocytes, a type of glial cell in the brain, actively contribute to synaptic communication through astrocytic diffusion or gliotransmission. Neuronal activity triggers an increase in astrocytic calcium levels, prompting the release of gliotransmitters, such as glutamate, ATP, and D-serine. These gliotransmitters diffuse into the extracellular space, interacting with nearby neurons and influencing synaptic transmission. By regulating extracellular neurotransmitter levels, astrocytes help maintain proper synaptic function. This bidirectional communication between astrocytes and neurons add complexity to brain signaling, with implications for brain function and neurological disorders.
# Enzyme degradation – proteins called enzymes break the neurotransmitters down.
# Reuptake – neurotransmitters are reabsorbed into the pre-synaptic neuron. Transporters, or membrane transport proteins, pump neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft back into axon terminals (the presynaptic neuron) where they are stored for reuse.

For example, acetylcholine is eliminated by having its acetyl group cleaved by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase; the remaining choline is then taken in and recycled by the pre-synaptic neuron to synthesize more acetylcholine. Other neurotransmitters are able to diffuse away from their targeted synaptic junctions and are eliminated from the body via the kidneys, or destroyed in the liver. Each neurotransmitter has very specific degradation pathways at regulatory points, which may be targeted by the body&#x27;s regulatory system or medication. Cocaine blocks a dopamine transporter responsible for the reuptake of dopamine. Without the transporter, dopamine diffuses much more slowly from the synaptic cleft and continues to activate the dopamine receptors on the target cell.

==Discovery==

Until the early 20th century, scientists assumed that the majority of synaptic communication in the brain was electrical. However, through histological examinations by Ramón y Cajal, a 20 to 40 nm gap between neurons, known today as the synaptic cleft, was discovered. The presence of such a gap suggested communication via chemical messengers traversing the synaptic cleft, and in 1921 German pharmacologist Otto Loewi confirmed that neurons can communicate by releasing chemicals. Through a series of experiments involving the vagus nerves of frogs, Loewi was able to manually slow the heart rate of frogs by controlling the amount of saline solution present around the vagus nerve. Upon completion of this experiment, Loewi asserted that sympathetic regulation of cardiac function can be mediated through changes in chemical concentrations. Furthermore, Otto Loewi is credited with discovering acetylcholine (ACh) – the first known neurotransmitter.

==Identification==
To identify neurotransmitters, the following criteria are typically considered:
# Synthesis: The chemical must be produced within the neuron or be present in it as a precursor molecule.
# Release and response: When the neuron is activated, the chemical must be released and elicit a response in target cells or neurons.
# Experimental response: Application of the chemical directly to the target cells should produce the same response observed when the chemical is naturally released from neurons.
# Removal mechanism: There must be a mechanism in place to remove the neurotransmitter from its site of action once its signaling role is complete.

However, given advances in pharmacology, genetics, and chemical neuroanatomy, the term &quot;neurotransmitter&quot; can be applied to chemicals that:
* Carry messages between neurons via influence on the postsynaptic membrane.
* Have little or no effect on membrane voltage, but have a common carrying function such as changing the structure of the synapse.
* Communicate by sending reverse-direction messages that affect the release or reuptake of transmitters.

The anatomical localization of neurotransmitters is typically determined using immunocytochemical techniques, which identify the location of either the transmitter substances themselves or of the enzymes that are involved in their synthesis. Immunocytochemical techniques have also revealed that many transmitters, particularly the neuropeptides, are co-localized, that is, a neuron may release more than one transmitter from its synaptic terminal. Various techniques and experiments such as staining, stimulating, and collecting can be used to identify neurotransmitters throughout the central nervous system.

== Actions ==
Neurons communicate with each other through synapses, specialized contact points where neurotransmitters transmit signals. When an action potential reaches the presynaptic terminal, the action potential can trigger the release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. These neurotransmitters then bind to receptors on the postsynaptic membrane, influencing the receiving neuron in either an inhibitory or excitatory manner. If the overall excitatory influences outweigh the inhibitory influences, the receiving neuron may generate its own action potential, continuing the transmission of information to the next neuron in the network. This process allows for the flow of information and the formation of complex neural networks.

===Modulation===
A neurotransmitter may have an excitatory, inhibitory or modulatory effect on the target cell. The effect is determined by the receptors the neurotransmitter interacts with at the post-synaptic membrane. Neurotransmitter influences trans-membrane ion flow either to increase (excitatory) or to decrease (inhibitory) the probability that the cell with which it comes in contact will produce an action potential. Synapses containing receptors with excitatory effects are called Type I synapses, while Type II synapses contain receptors with inhibitory effects. Thus, despite the wide variety of synapses, they all convey messages of only these two types. The two types are different appearance and are primarily located on different parts of the neurons under its influence. Receptors with modulatory effects are spread throughout all synaptic membranes and binding of neurotransmitters sets in motion signaling cascades that help the cell regulate its function. Binding of neurotransmitters to receptors with modulatory effects can have many results. For example, it may result in an increase or decrease in sensitivity to future stimulus by recruiting more or less receptors to the synaptic membrane.

Type I (excitatory) synapses are typically located on the shafts or the spines of dendrites, whereas type II (inhibitory) synapses are typically located on a cell body. In addition, Type I synapses have round synaptic vesicles, whereas the vesicles of type II synapses are flattened. The material on the presynaptic and post-synaptic membranes is denser in a Type I synapse than it is in a Type II, and the Type I synaptic cleft is wider. Finally, the active zone on a Type I synapse is larger than that on a Type II synapse.

The different locations of Type I and Type II synapses divide a neuron into two zones: an excitatory dendritic tree and an inhibitory cell body. From an inhibitory perspective, excitation comes in over the dendrites and spreads to the axon hillock to trigger an action potential. If the message is to be stopped, it is best stopped by applying inhibition on the cell body, close to the axon hillock where the action potential originates. Another way to conceptualize excitatory–inhibitory interaction is to picture excitation overcoming inhibition. If the cell body is normally in an inhibited state, the only way to generate an action potential at the axon hillock is to reduce the cell body&#x27;s inhibition. In this &quot;open the gates&quot; strategy, the excitatory message is like a racehorse ready to run down the track, but first, the inhibitory starting gate must be removed.

===Neurotransmitter actions===
As explained above, the only direct action of a neurotransmitter is to activate a receptor. Therefore, the effects of a neurotransmitter system depend on the connections of the neurons that use the transmitter, and the chemical properties of the receptors.
* Glutamate is used at the great majority of fast excitatory synapses in the brain and spinal cord. It is also used at most synapses that are &quot;modifiable&quot;, i.e. capable of increasing or decreasing in strength. Modifiable synapses are thought to be the main memory-storage elements in the brain. Excessive glutamate release can overstimulate the brain and lead to excitotoxicity causing cell death resulting in seizures or strokes. Excitotoxicity has been implicated in certain chronic diseases including ischemic stroke, epilepsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, Huntington disease, and Parkinson&#x27;s disease.
* GABA is used at the great majority of fast inhibitory synapses in virtually every part of the brain. Many sedative/tranquilizing drugs act by enhancing the effects of GABA.
* Glycine is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the spinal cord.
* Acetylcholine was the first neurotransmitter discovered in the peripheral and central nervous systems. It activates skeletal muscles in the somatic nervous system and may either excite or inhibit internal organs in the autonomic system. It is main neurotransmitter at the neuromuscular junction connecting motor nerves to muscles. The paralytic arrow-poison curare acts by blocking transmission at these synapses. Acetylcholine also operates in many regions of the brain as a neuromodulatory, but using different types of receptors, including nicotinic and muscarinic receptors.
* Dopamine has a number of important functions in the brain. This includes critical role in the reward system, motivation and emotional arousal. It also plays an important role in fine motor control and Parkinson&#x27;s disease has been linked to low levels of dopamine due to the loss of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta. Schizophrenia, a highly heterogeneous and complicated disorder has been linked to high levels of dopamine.
* Serotonin is a monoamine neurotransmitter. Most of it is produced by the intestine (approximately 90%), and the remainder by central nervous system neurons at the raphe nuclei. It functions to regulate appetite, sleep, memory and learning, temperature, mood, behaviour, muscle contraction, and the functions of the cardiovascular system and endocrine system. It is speculated to have a role in depression, as some depressed patients have been reported to exhibit lower concentrations of metabolites of serotonin in their cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue.
* Norepinephrine is a member of the catecholamine family of neurotransmitters. It is synthesized from the amino acid tyrosine. In the peripheral nervous system, one of the primary roles of norepinephrine is to stimulate the release of the stress hormone epinephrine (i.e. adrenaline) from the adrenal glands. Norepinephrine is involved in the fight-or-flight response and is also affected in anxiety disorders and depression.
* Epinephrine, a neurotransmitter and hormone is synthesized from tyrosine. It is released from the adrenal glands and also plays a role in the fight-or-flight response. Epinephrine has vasoconstrictive effects, which promote increased heart rate, blood pressure, energy mobilization. Vasoconstriction influences metabolism by promoting the breakdown of glucose released into the bloodstream. Epinephrine also has bronchodilation effects, which is the relaxing of airways.

== Types ==
There are many different ways to classify neurotransmitters and are commonly classified into amino acids, monoamines and peptides.

Some of the major neurotransmitters are:
* Amino acids: glutamate, aspartate, D-serine, gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine
* Gasotransmitters: nitric oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen sulfide (H2S)
* Monoamines:
** Catecholamines: dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (noradrenaline, NE), epinephrine (adrenaline)
** Indolamines: serotonin (5-HT, SER), melatonin
** histamine
* Trace amines: phenethylamine, &quot;N&quot;-methylphenethylamine, tyramine, 3-iodothyronamine, octopamine, tryptamine, etc.
* Peptides: oxytocin, somatostatin, substance P, cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript, opioid peptides
* Purines: adenosine triphosphate (ATP), adenosine
* Others: acetylcholine (ACh), anandamide, etc.

In addition, over 100 neuroactive peptides have been found, and new ones are discovered regularly. Many of these are co-released along with a small-molecule transmitter. Nevertheless, in some cases, a peptide is the primary transmitter at a synapse. Beta-Endorphin is a relatively well-known example of a peptide neurotransmitter because it engages in highly specific interactions with opioid receptors in the central nervous system.

Single ions (such as synaptically released zinc) are also considered neurotransmitters by some, as well as some gaseous molecules such as nitric oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO), and hydrogen sulfide (H2S). The gases are produced in the neural cytoplasm and are immediately diffused through the cell membrane into the extracellular fluid and into nearby cells to stimulate production of second messengers. Soluble gas neurotransmitters are difficult to study, as they act rapidly and are immediately broken down, existing for only a few seconds.

The most prevalent transmitter is glutamate, which is excitatory at well over 90% of the synapses in the human brain. The next most prevalent is gamma-Aminobutyric Acid, or GABA, which is inhibitory at more than 90% of the synapses that do not use glutamate. Although other transmitters are used in fewer synapses, they may be very important functionally: the great majority of psychoactive drugs exert their effects by altering the actions of some neurotransmitter systems, often acting through transmitters other than glutamate or GABA. Addictive drugs such as cocaine and amphetamines exert their effects primarily on the dopamine system. The addictive opiate drugs exert their effects primarily as functional analogs of opioid peptides, which, in turn, regulate dopamine levels.

===List of neurotransmitters, peptides, and gaseous signaling molecules===


==Neurotransmitter systems ==
Neurons expressing certain types of neurotransmitters sometimes form distinct systems, where activation of the system affects large volumes of the brain, called volume transmission. Major neurotransmitter systems include the noradrenaline (norepinephrine) system, the dopamine system, the serotonin system, and the cholinergic system, among others. Trace amines have a modulatory effect on neurotransmission in monoamine pathways (i.e., dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin pathways) throughout the brain via signaling through trace amine-associated receptor 1. A brief comparison of these systems follows:

==Drug effects==
Understanding the effects of drugs on neurotransmitters comprises a significant portion of research initiatives in the field of neuroscience. Most neuroscientists involved in this field of research believe that such efforts may further advance our understanding of the circuits responsible for various neurological diseases and disorders, as well as ways to effectively treat and someday possibly prevent or cure such illnesses.

Drugs can influence behavior by altering neurotransmitter activity. For instance, drugs can decrease the rate of synthesis of neurotransmitters by affecting the synthetic enzyme(s) for that neurotransmitter. When neurotransmitter syntheses are blocked, the amount of neurotransmitters available for release becomes substantially lower, resulting in a decrease in neurotransmitter activity. Some drugs block or stimulate the release of specific neurotransmitters. Alternatively, drugs can prevent neurotransmitter storage in synaptic vesicles by causing the synaptic vesicle membranes to leak. Drugs that prevent a neurotransmitter from binding to its receptor are called receptor antagonists. For example, drugs used to treat patients with schizophrenia such as haloperidol, chlorpromazine, and clozapine are antagonists at receptors in the brain for dopamine. Other drugs act by binding to a receptor and mimicking the normal neurotransmitter. Such drugs are called receptor agonists. An example of a receptor agonist is morphine, an opiate that mimics effects of the endogenous neurotransmitter β-endorphin to relieve pain. Other drugs interfere with the deactivation of a neurotransmitter after it has been released, thereby prolonging the action of a neurotransmitter. This can be accomplished by blocking re-uptake or inhibiting degradative enzymes. Lastly, drugs can also prevent an action potential from occurring, blocking neuronal activity throughout the central and peripheral nervous system. Drugs such as tetrodotoxin that block neural activity are typically lethal.

Drugs targeting the neurotransmitter of major systems affect the whole system, which can explain the complexity of action of some drugs. Cocaine, for example, blocks the re-uptake of dopamine back into the presynaptic neuron, leaving the neurotransmitter molecules in the synaptic gap for an extended period of time. Since the dopamine remains in the synapse longer, the neurotransmitter continues to bind to the receptors on the postsynaptic neuron, eliciting a pleasurable emotional response. Physical addiction to cocaine may result from prolonged exposure to excess dopamine in the synapses, which leads to the downregulation of some post-synaptic receptors. After the effects of the drug wear off, an individual can become depressed due to decreased probability of the neurotransmitter binding to a receptor. Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI), which blocks re-uptake of serotonin by the presynaptic cell which increases the amount of serotonin present at the synapse and furthermore allows it to remain there longer, providing potential for the effect of naturally released serotonin. AMPT prevents the conversion of tyrosine to L-DOPA, the precursor to dopamine; reserpine prevents dopamine storage within vesicles; and deprenyl inhibits monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B and thus increases dopamine levels.

===Agonists===
An agonist is a chemical capable of binding to a receptor, such as a neurotransmitter receptor, and initiating the same reaction typically produced by the binding of the endogenous substance. An agonist of a neurotransmitter will thus initiate the same receptor response as the transmitter. In neurons, an agonist drug may activate neurotransmitter receptors either directly or indirectly. Direct-binding agonists can be further characterized as full agonists, partial agonists, inverse agonists.

Direct agonists act similar to a neurotransmitter by binding directly to its associated receptor site(s), which may be located on the presynaptic neuron or postsynaptic neuron, or both. Typically, neurotransmitter receptors are located on the postsynaptic neuron, while neurotransmitter autoreceptors are located on the presynaptic neuron, as is the case for monoamine neurotransmitters; in some cases, a neurotransmitter utilizes retrograde neurotransmission, a type of feedback signaling in neurons where the neurotransmitter is released postsynaptically and binds to target receptors located on the presynaptic neuron. Nicotine, a compound found in tobacco, is a direct agonist of most nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, mainly located in cholinergic neurons. Opiates, such as morphine, heroin, hydrocodone, oxycodone, codeine, and methadone, are μ-opioid receptor agonists; this action mediates their euphoriant and pain relieving properties.

Indirect agonists increase the binding of neurotransmitters at their target receptors by stimulating the release or preventing the reuptake of neurotransmitters. Some indirect agonists trigger neurotransmitter release and prevent neurotransmitter reuptake. Amphetamine, for example, is an indirect agonist of postsynaptic dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin receptors in each their respective neurons; it produces both neurotransmitter release into the presynaptic neuron and subsequently the synaptic cleft and prevents their reuptake from the synaptic cleft by activating TAAR1, a presynaptic G protein-coupled receptor, and binding to a site on VMAT2, a type of monoamine transporter located on synaptic vesicles within monoamine neurons.

=== Antagonists ===

An antagonist is a chemical that acts within the body to reduce the physiological activity of another chemical substance (such as an opiate); especially one that opposes the action on the nervous system of a drug or a substance occurring naturally in the body by combining with and blocking its nervous receptor.

There are two main types of antagonist: direct-acting Antagonist and indirect-acting Antagonists:
# Direct-acting antagonist- which takes up space present on receptors which are otherwise taken up by neurotransmitters themselves. This results in neurotransmitters being blocked from binding to the receptors. An example of one of the most common is called Atropine.
# Indirect-acting antagonist- drugs that inhibit the release/production of neurotransmitters (e.g., Reserpine).

==== Drug antagonists ====
An antagonist drug is one that attaches (or binds) to a site called a receptor without activating that receptor to produce a biological response. It is therefore said to have no intrinsic activity. An antagonist may also be called a receptor &quot;blocker&quot; because they block the effect of an agonist at the site. The pharmacological effects of an antagonist, therefore, result in preventing the corresponding receptor site&#x27;s agonists (e.g., drugs, hormones, neurotransmitters) from binding to and activating it. Antagonists may be &quot;competitive&quot; or &quot;irreversible&quot;.

A competitive antagonist competes with an agonist for binding to the receptor. As the concentration of antagonist increases, the binding of the agonist is progressively inhibited, resulting in a decrease in the physiological response. High concentration of an antagonist can completely inhibit the response. This inhibition can be reversed, however, by an increase of the concentration of the agonist, since the agonist and antagonist compete for binding to the receptor. Competitive antagonists, therefore, can be characterized as shifting the dose–response relationship for the agonist to the right. In the presence of a competitive antagonist, it takes an increased concentration of the agonist to produce the same response observed in the absence of the antagonist.

An irreversible antagonist binds so strongly to the receptor as to render the receptor unavailable for binding to the agonist. Irreversible antagonists may even form covalent chemical bonds with the receptor. In either case, if the concentration of the irreversible antagonist is high enough, the number of unbound receptors remaining for agonist binding may be so low that even high concentrations of the agonist do not produce the maximum biological response.

===Precursors===

While intake of neurotransmitter precursors does increase neurotransmitter synthesis, evidence is mixed as to whether neurotransmitter release and postsynaptic receptor firing is increased. Even with increased neurotransmitter release, it is unclear whether this will result in a long-term increase in neurotransmitter signal strength, since the nervous system can adapt to changes such as increased neurotransmitter synthesis and may therefore maintain constant firing. Some neurotransmitters may have a role in depression and there is some evidence to suggest that intake of precursors of these neurotransmitters may be useful in the treatment of mild and moderate depression.

====Catecholamine and trace amine precursors====
-DOPA, a precursor of dopamine that crosses the blood–brain barrier, is used in the treatment of Parkinson&#x27;s disease. For depressed patients where low activity of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine is implicated, there is only little evidence for benefit of neurotransmitter precursor administration. L-phenylalanine and L-tyrosine are both precursors for dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. These conversions require vitamin B6, vitamin C, and S-adenosylmethionine. A few studies suggest potential antidepressant effects of L-phenylalanine and L-tyrosine, but there is much room for further research in this area.

====Serotonin precursors====

Administration of L-tryptophan, a precursor for serotonin, is seen to double the production of serotonin in the brain. It is significantly more effective than a placebo in the treatment of mild and moderate depression. This conversion requires vitamin C. 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), also a precursor for serotonin, is more effective than a placebo.

== Diseases and disorders ==
Diseases and disorders may also affect specific neurotransmitter systems. The following are disorders involved in either an increase, decrease, or imbalance of certain neurotransmitters.

=== Dopamine ===

For example, problems in producing dopamine (mainly in the substantia nigra) can result in Parkinson&#x27;s disease, a disorder that affects a person&#x27;s ability to move as they want to, resulting in stiffness, tremors or shaking, and other symptoms. Some studies suggest that having too little or too much dopamine or problems using dopamine in the thinking and feeling regions of the brain may play a role in disorders like schizophrenia or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Dopamine is also involved in addiction and drug use, as most recreational drugs cause an influx of dopamine in the brain (especially opioid and methamphetamines) that produces a pleasurable feeling, which is why users constantly crave drugs.

=== Serotonin ===

Similarly, after some research suggested that drugs that block the recycling, or reuptake, of serotonin seemed to help some people diagnosed with depression, it was theorized that people with depression might have lower-than-normal serotonin levels. Though widely popularized, this theory was not borne out in subsequent research. Therefore, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are used to increase the amounts of serotonin in synapses.

=== Glutamate ===
Furthermore, problems with producing or using glutamate have been suggestively and tentatively linked to many mental disorders, including autism, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), schizophrenia, and depression. Having too much glutamate has been linked to neurological diseases such as Parkinson&#x27;s disease, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, stroke, and ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis).

==Neurotransmitter imbalance==
Generally, there are no scientifically established &quot;norms&quot; for appropriate levels or &quot;balances&quot; of different neurotransmitters. In most cases, it is practically impossible to measure neurotransmitter levels in the brain or body at any given moment. Neurotransmitters regulate each other&#x27;s release, and weak consistent imbalances in this mutual regulation were linked to temperament in healthy people. However, significant imbalances or disruptions in neurotransmitter systems are associated with various diseases and mental disorders, including Parkinson&#x27;s disease, depression, insomnia, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), anxiety, memory loss, dramatic weight changes, and addictions. Some of these conditions are also related to neurotransmitter switching, a phenomenon where neurons change the type of neurotransmitters they release. Chronic physical or emotional stress can be a contributor to neurotransmitter system changes. Genetics also plays a role in neurotransmitter activities.

Apart from recreational use, medications that directly and indirectly interact with one or more transmitter or its receptor are commonly prescribed for psychiatric and psychological issues. Notably, drugs interacting with serotonin and norepinephrine are prescribed to patients with problems such as depression and anxiety—though the notion that there is much solid medical evidence to support such interventions has been widely criticized. Studies shown that dopamine imbalance has an influence on multiple sclerosis and other neurological disorders.

<text>Neutronium (or neutrium, neutrite, or element zero) is a hypothetical substance made purely of neutrons. The word was coined by scientist Andreas von Antropoff in 1926 (before the 1932 discovery of the neutron) for the hypothetical &quot;element of atomic number zero&quot; (with no protons in its nucleus) that he placed at the head of the periodic table (denoted by -). However, the meaning of the term has changed over time, and from the last half of the 20th century onward it has been also used to refer to extremely dense substances resembling the neutron-degenerate matter theorized to exist in the cores of neutron stars.

==In neutron stars==
Neutronium is used in popular physics literature to refer to the material present in the cores of neutron stars (stars which are too massive to be supported by electron degeneracy pressure and which collapse into a denser phase of matter). In scientific literature the term &quot;neutron-degenerate matter&quot; or simply neutron matter is used for this material.

==Hypothetical multi-neutrons==
The term &quot;neutronium&quot; was coined in 1926 by Andreas von Antropoff for a conjectured form of matter made up of neutrons with no protons or electrons, which he placed as the chemical element of atomic number zero at the head of his new version of the periodic table. It was subsequently placed in the middle of several spiral representations of the periodic system for classifying the chemical elements, such as those of Charles Janet (1928), Edgar Emerson (1944), and John D. Clark (1950).

The term is not used in the scientific literature either for a condensed form of matter, or as an element, and theoretical analysis expects no bound forms of neutrons without protons. 

===Scattering resonances with multiple neutrons===
Multi-neutron scattering resonances have been observed or predicted.
* Dineutron: The dineutron, containing two neutrons, is not a stable bound particle, but a extremely short-lived resonance state produced by nuclear reactions involving tritium was unambiguously observed in 2012 in the decay of beryllium-16. It has been suggested to have a transitory existence in nuclear reactions produced by helions (completely ionized helium-3 nuclei) that result in the formation of a proton and a nucleus having the same atomic number as the target nucleus but a mass number two units greater. The dineutron hypothesis had been used in nuclear reactions with exotic nuclei for a long time. Several applications of the dineutron in nuclear reactions can be found in review papers. Its existence has been proven to be relevant for nuclear structure of exotic nuclei. A system made up of only two neutrons is not bound, though the attraction between them is very nearly enough to make them so. This has some consequences on nucleosynthesis and the abundance of the chemical elements.
* Trineutron: A trineutron state consisting of three bound neutrons has not been detected, and is not expected to be bound.
* Tetraneutron: A tetraneutron is a hypothetical particle consisting of four bound neutrons. Reports of its existence have not been replicated.
* Pentaneutron: Calculations indicate that the hypothetical pentaneutron state, consisting of a cluster of five neutrons, would not be bound.

<text>A neutron star is the collapsed core of a massive supergiant star. It results from the supernova explosion of a massive star—combined with gravitational collapse—that compresses the core past white dwarf star density to that of atomic nuclei. Surpassed only by black holes, neutron stars are the second smallest and densest known class of stellar objects. Neutron stars have a radius on the order of and a mass of about . Stars that collapse into neutron stars have a total mass of between 10 and 25 solar masses (), or possibly more for those that are especially rich in elements heavier than hydrogen and helium.

Once formed, neutron stars no longer actively generate heat and cool over time, but they may still evolve further through collisions or accretion. Most of the basic models for these objects imply that they are composed almost entirely of neutrons, as the extreme pressure causes the electrons and protons present in normal matter to combine into additional neutrons. These stars are partially supported against further collapse by neutron degeneracy pressure, just as white dwarfs are supported against collapse by electron degeneracy pressure. However, this is not by itself sufficient to hold up an object beyond and repulsive nuclear forces increasingly contribute to supporting more massive neutron stars. If the remnant star has a mass exceeding the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit, which ranges from the combination of degeneracy pressure and nuclear forces is insufficient to support the neutron star, causing it to collapse and form a black hole. The most massive neutron star detected so far, PSR J0952–0607, is estimated to be .

Newly formed neutron stars may have surface temperatures of ten million K or more. However, since neutron stars generate no new heat through fusion, they inexorably cool down after their formation. Consequently, a given neutron star reaches a surface temperature of one million K when it is between one thousand and one million years old. Older and even-cooler neutron stars are still easy to discover. For example, the well-studied neutron star, has an average surface temperature of about 434,000 K. For comparison, the Sun has an effective surface temperature of 5,780 K.

Neutron star material is remarkably dense: a normal-sized matchbox containing neutron-star material would have a weight of approximately 3 billion tonnes, the same weight as a 0.5-cubic-kilometer chunk of the Earth (a cube with edges of about 800 meters) from Earth&#x27;s surface.

As a star&#x27;s core collapses, its rotation rate increases due to conservation of angular momentum, so newly formed neutron stars typically rotate at up to several hundred times per second. Some neutron stars emit beams of electromagnetic radiation that make them detectable as pulsars, and the discovery of pulsars by Jocelyn Bell Burnell and Antony Hewish in 1967 was the first observational suggestion that neutron stars exist. The fastest-spinning neutron star known is PSR J1748−2446ad, rotating at a rate of 716 times per second or 43,000 revolutions per minute, giving a linear (tangential) speed at the surface on the order of 0.24&quot;c&quot; (i.e., nearly a quarter the speed of light).

There are thought to be around one billion neutron stars in the Milky Way, and at a minimum several hundred million, a figure obtained by estimating the number of stars that have undergone supernova explosions. However, many of them have existed for a long period of time and have cooled down considerably. These stars radiate very little electromagnetic radiation; most neutron stars that have been detected occur only in certain situations in which they do radiate, such as if they are a pulsar or a part of a binary system. Slow-rotating and non-accreting neutron stars are difficult to detect, due to the absence of electromagnetic radiation; however, since the Hubble Space Telescope&#x27;s detection of RX J1856.5−3754 in the 1990s, a few nearby neutron stars that appear to emit only thermal radiation have been detected.

Neutron stars in binary systems can undergo accretion, in which case they emit large amounts of X-rays. During this process, matter is deposited on the surface of the stars, forming &quot;hotspots&quot; that can be sporadically identified as X-ray pulsar systems. Additionally, such accretions are able to &quot;recycle&quot; old pulsars, causing them to gain mass and rotate extremely quickly, forming millisecond pulsars. Furthermore, binary systems such as these continue to evolve, with many companions eventually becoming compact objects such as white dwarfs or neutron stars themselves, though other possibilities include a complete destruction of the companion through ablation or collision.

The study of neutron star systems is central to gravitational wave astronomy. The merger of binary neutron stars produces gravitational waves and may be associated with kilonovae and short-duration gamma-ray bursts. In 2017, the LIGO and Virgo interferometer sites observed GW170817, the first direct detection of gravitational waves from such an event. Prior to this, indirect evidence for gravitational waves was inferred by studying the gravity radiated from the orbital decay of a different type of (unmerged) binary neutron system, the Hulse–Taylor pulsar.

==Formation==

Any main-sequence star with an initial mass of greater than (eight times the mass of the Sun) has the potential to become a neutron star. As the star evolves away from the main sequence, stellar nucleosynthesis produces an iron-rich core. When all nuclear fuel in the core has been exhausted, the core must be supported by degeneracy pressure alone. Further deposits of mass from shell burning cause the core to exceed the Chandrasekhar limit. Electron-degeneracy pressure is overcome, and the core collapses further, causing temperatures to rise to over (5 billion K). At these temperatures, photodisintegration (the breakdown of iron nuclei into alpha particles due to high-energy gamma rays) occurs. As the temperature of the core continues to rise, electrons and protons combine to form neutrons via electron capture, releasing a flood of neutrinos. When densities reach a nuclear density of , a combination of strong force repulsion and neutron degeneracy pressure halts the contraction. The contracting outer envelope of the star is halted and rapidly flung outwards by a flux of neutrinos produced in the creation of the neutrons, resulting in a supernova and leaving behind a neutron star. However, if the remnant has a mass greater than about , it instead becomes a black hole.

As the core of a massive star is compressed during a Type II supernova or a Type Ib or Type Ic supernova, and collapses into a neutron star, it retains most of its angular momentum. Because it has only a tiny fraction of its parent&#x27;s radius (sharply reducing its moment of inertia), a neutron star is formed with very high rotation speed and then, over a very long period, it slows. Neutron stars are known that have rotation periods from about 1.4 ms to 30 s. The neutron star&#x27;s density also gives it very high surface gravity, with typical values ranging from to (more than times that of Earth). One measure of such immense gravity is the fact that neutron stars have an escape velocity of over half the speed of light. The neutron star&#x27;s gravity accelerates infalling matter to tremendous speed, and tidal forces near the surface can cause spaghettification.

==Properties==
=== Equation of state ===
The equation of state of neutron stars is not currently known. This is because neutron stars are the second most dense known object in the universe, only less dense than black holes. The extreme density means there is no way to replicate the material on earth in laboratories, which is how equations of state for other things like ideal gases are tested. The closest neutron star is many parsecs away, meaning there is no feasible way to study it directly. While it is known neutron stars should be similar to a degenerate gas, it cannot be modeled strictly like one (as white dwarfs are) because of the extreme gravity. General relativity must be considered for the neutron star equation of state because Newtonian gravity is no longer sufficient in those conditions. Effects such as quantum chromodynamics (QCD), superconductivity, and superfluidity must also be considered.

At the extraordinarily high densities of neutron stars, ordinary matter is squeezed to nuclear densities. Specifically, the matter ranges from nuclei embedded in a sea of electrons at low densities in the outer crust, to increasingly neutron-rich structures in the inner crust, to the extremely neutron-rich uniform matter in the outer core, and possibly exotic states of matter at high densities in the inner core.

Understanding the nature of the matter present in the various layers of neutron stars, and the phase transitions that occur at the boundaries of the layers is a major unsolved problem in fundamental physics. The neutron star equation of state encodes information about the structure of a neutron star and thus tells us how matter behaves at the extreme densities found inside neutron stars. Constraints on the neutron star equation of state would then provide constraints on how the strong force of the standard model works, which would have profound implications for nuclear and atomic physics. This makes neutron stars natural laboratories for probing fundamental physics.

For example, the exotic states that may be found at the cores of neutron stars are types of QCD matter. At the extreme densities at the centers of neutron stars, neutrons become disrupted giving rise to a sea of quarks. This matter&#x27;s equation of state is governed by the laws of quantum chromodynamics and since QCD matter cannot be produced in any laboratory on Earth, most of the current knowledge about it is only theoretical.

Different equations of state lead to different values of observable quantities. While the equation of state is only directly relating the density and pressure, it also leads to calculating observables like the speed of sound, mass, radius, and Love numbers. Because the equation of state is unknown, there are many proposed ones, such as FPS, UU, APR, L, and SLy, and it is an active area of research. Different factors can be considered when creating the equation of state such as phase transitions.

Another aspect of the equation of state is whether it is a soft or stiff equation of state. This relates to how much pressure there is at a certain energy density, and often corresponds to phase transitions. When the material is about to go through a phase transition, the pressure will tend to increase until it shifts into a more comfortable state of matter. A soft equation of state would have a gently rising pressure versus energy density while a stiff one would have a sharper rise in pressure. In neutron stars, nuclear physicists are still testing whether the equation of state should be stiff or soft, and sometimes it changes within individual equations of state depending on the phase transitions within the model. This is referred to as the equation of state stiffening or softening, depending on the previous behavior. Since it is unknown what neutron stars are made of, there is room for different phases of matter to be explored within the equation of state.

===Density and pressure===

Neutron stars have overall densities of to ( to times the density of the Sun), which is comparable to the approximate density of an atomic nucleus of . The density increases with depth, varying from about at the crust to an estimated or deeper inside. Pressure increases accordingly, from about (32 QPa) at the inner crust to in the center.

A neutron star is so dense that one teaspoon (5 milliliters) of its material would have a mass over , about 900 times the mass of the Great Pyramid of Giza. The entire mass of the Earth at neutron star density would fit into a sphere 305 m in diameter, about the size of the Arecibo Telescope.

In popular scientific writing, neutron stars are sometimes described as macroscopic atomic nuclei. Indeed, both states are composed of nucleons, and they share a similar density to within an order of magnitude. However, in other respects, neutron stars and atomic nuclei are quite different. A nucleus is held together by the strong interaction, whereas a neutron star is held together by gravity. The density of a nucleus is uniform, while neutron stars are predicted to consist of multiple layers with varying compositions and densities.

=== Current constraints ===
Because equations of state for neutron stars lead to different observables, such as different mass-radius relations, there are many astronomical constraints on equations of state. These come mostly from LIGO, which is a gravitational wave observatory, and NICER, which is an X-ray telescope.

NICER&#x27;s observations of pulsars in binary systems, from which the pulsar mass and radius can be estimated, can constrain the neutron star equation of state. A 2021 measurement of the pulsar PSR J0740+6620 was able to constrain the radius of a 1.4 solar mass neutron star to km with 95% confidence. These mass-radius constraints, combined with chiral effective field theory calculations, tightens constraints on the neutron star equation of state.

Equation of state constraints from LIGO gravitational wave detections start with nuclear and atomic physics researchers, who work to propose theoretical equations of state (such as FPS, UU, APR, L, SLy, and others). The proposed equations of state can then be passed onto astrophysics researchers who run simulations of binary neutron star mergers. From these simulations, researchers can extract gravitational waveforms, thus studying the relationship between the equation of state and gravitational waves emitted by binary neutron star mergers. Using these relations, one can constrain the neutron star equation of state when gravitational waves from binary neutron star mergers are observed. Past numerical relativity simulations of binary neutron star mergers have found relationships between the equation of state and frequency dependent peaks of the gravitational wave signal that can be applied to LIGO detections. For example, the LIGO detection of the binary neutron star merger GW170817 provided limits on the tidal deformability of the two neutron stars which dramatically reduced the family of allowed equations of state. Future gravitational wave signals with next generation detectors like Cosmic Explorer can impose further constraints.

When nuclear physicists are trying to understand the likelihood of their equation of state, it is good to compare with these constraints to see if it predicts neutron stars of these masses and radii. There is also recent work on constraining the equation of state with the speed of sound through hydrodynamics.

=== Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff Equation ===
The Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation can be used to describe a neutron star. The equation is a solution to Einstein&#x27;s equations from general relativity for a spherically symmetric, time invariant metric. With a given equation of state, solving the equation leads to observables such as the mass and radius. There are many codes that numerically solve the TOV equation for a given equation of state to find the mass-radius relation and other observables for that equation of state.

The following differential equations can be solved numerically to find the neutron star observables:

=== Mass-Radius relation ===
Using the TOV equations and an equation of state, a mass-radius curve can be found. The idea is that for the correct equation of state, every neutron star that could possibly exist would lie along that curve. This is one of the ways equations of state can be constrained by astronomical observations. To create these curves, one must solve the TOV equations for different central densities. For each central density, you numerically solve the mass and pressure equations until the pressure goes to zero, which is the outside of the star. Each solution gives a corresponding mass and radius for that central density.

Mass-radius curves determine what the maximum mass is for a given equation of state. Through most of the mass-radius curve, each radius corresponds to a unique mass value. At a certain point, the curve will reach a maximum and start going back down, leading to repeated mass values for different radii. This maximum point is what is known as the maximum mass. Beyond that mass, the star will no longer be stable, i.e. no longer be able to hold itself up against the force of gravity, and would collapse into a black hole. Since each equation of state leads to a different mass-radius curve, they also lead to a unique maximum mass value. The maximum mass value is unknown as long as the equation of state remains unknown.

This is very important when it comes to constraining the equation of state. Oppenheimer and Volkoff came up with the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit using a degenerate gas equation of state with the TOV equations that was ~0.7 Solar masses. Since the neutron stars that have been observed are more massive than that, that maximum mass was discarded. The most recent massive neutron star that was observed was PSR J0952-0607 which was solar masses. Any equation of state with a mass less than that would not predict that star and thus is much less likely to be correct.

An interesting phenomenon in this area of astrophysics relating to the maximum mass of neutron stars is what is called the &quot;mass gap&quot;. The mass gap refers to a range of masses from roughly 2-5 solar masses where very few compact objects were observed. This range is based on the current assumed maximum mass of neutron stars (~2 solar masses) and the minimum black hole mass (~5 solar masses). Recently, some objects have been discovered that fall in that mass gap from gravitational wave detections. If the true maximum mass of neutron stars was known, it would help characterize compact objects in that mass range as either neutron stars or black holes.

=== I-Love-Q Relations ===
There are three more properties of neutron stars that are dependent on the equation of state but can also be astronomically observed: the moment of inertia, the quadrupole moment, and the Love number. The moment of inertia of a neutron star describes how fast the star can rotate at a fixed spin momentum. The quadrupole moment of a neutron star specifies how much that star is deformed out of its spherical shape. The Love number of the neutron star represents how easy or difficult it is to deform the star due to tidal forces, typically important in binary systems.

While these properties depend on the material of the star and therefore on the equation of state, there is a relation between these three quantities that is independent of the equation of state. This relation assumes slowly and uniformly rotating stars and uses general relativity to derive the relation. While this relation would not be able to add constraints to the equation of state, since it is independent of the equation of state, it does have other applications. If one of these three quantities can be measured for a particular neutron star, this relation can be used to find the other two. In addition, this relation can be used to break the degeneracies in detections by gravitational wave detectors of the quadrupole moment and spin, allowing the average spin to be determined within a certain confidence level.

===Temperature===

The temperature inside a newly formed neutron star is from around to . However, the huge number of neutrinos it emits carries away so much energy that the temperature of an isolated neutron star falls within a few years to around . At this lower temperature, most of the light generated by a neutron star is in X-rays.

Some researchers have proposed a neutron star classification system using Roman numerals (not to be confused with the Yerkes luminosity classes for non-degenerate stars) to sort neutron stars by their mass and cooling rates: type I for neutron stars with low mass and cooling rates, type II for neutron stars with higher mass and cooling rates, and a proposed type III for neutron stars with even higher mass, approaching , and with higher cooling rates and possibly candidates for exotic stars.

===Magnetic field===
The magnetic field strength on the surface of neutron stars ranges from to  tesla (T). These are orders of magnitude higher than in any other object: for comparison, a continuous 16 T field has been achieved in the laboratory and is sufficient to levitate a living frog due to diamagnetic levitation. Variations in magnetic field strengths are most likely the main factor that allows different types of neutron stars to be distinguished by their spectra, and explains the periodicity of pulsars.

The neutron stars known as magnetars have the strongest magnetic fields, in the range of to , and have become the widely accepted hypothesis for neutron star types soft gamma repeaters (SGRs) and anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs). The magnetic energy density of a field is extreme, greatly exceeding the mass-energy density of ordinary matter. Fields of this strength are able to polarize the vacuum to the point that the vacuum becomes birefringent. Photons can merge or split in two, and virtual particle-antiparticle pairs are produced. The field changes electron energy levels and atoms are forced into thin cylinders. Unlike in an ordinary pulsar, magnetar spin-down can be directly powered by its magnetic field, and the magnetic field is strong enough to stress the crust to the point of fracture. Fractures of the crust cause starquakes, observed as extremely luminous millisecond hard gamma ray bursts. The fireball is trapped by the magnetic field, and comes in and out of view when the star rotates, which is observed as a periodic soft gamma repeater (SGR) emission with a period of 5–8 seconds and which lasts for a few minutes.

The origins of the strong magnetic field are as yet unclear. One hypothesis is that of &quot;flux freezing&quot;, or conservation of the original magnetic flux during the formation of the neutron star. If an object has a certain magnetic flux over its surface area, and that area shrinks to a smaller area, but the magnetic flux is conserved, then the magnetic field would correspondingly increase. Likewise, a collapsing star begins with a much larger surface area than the resulting neutron star, and conservation of magnetic flux would result in a far stronger magnetic field. However, this simple explanation does not fully explain magnetic field strengths of neutron stars.

===Gravity===


The gravitational field at a neutron star&#x27;s surface is about times stronger than on Earth, at around . Such a strong gravitational field acts as a gravitational lens and bends the radiation emitted by the neutron star such that parts of the normally invisible rear surface become visible.
If the radius of the neutron star is 3&quot;GM&quot;/&quot;c&quot;2 or less, then the photons may be trapped in an orbit, thus making the whole surface of that neutron star visible from a single vantage point, along with destabilizing photon orbits at or below the 1 radius distance of the star.

A fraction of the mass of a star that collapses to form a neutron star is released in the supernova explosion from which it forms (from the law of mass–energy equivalence, ). The energy comes from the gravitational binding energy of a neutron star.

Hence, the gravitational force of a typical neutron star is huge. If an object were to fall from a height of one meter on a neutron star 12 kilometers in radius, it would reach the ground at around 1,400 kilometers per second. However, even before impact, the tidal force would cause spaghettification, breaking any sort of an ordinary object into a stream of material.

Because of the enormous gravity, time dilation between a neutron star and Earth is significant. For example, eight years could pass on the surface of a neutron star, yet ten years would have passed on Earth, not including the time-dilation effect of the star&#x27;s very rapid rotation.

Neutron star relativistic equations of state describe the relation of radius vs. mass for various models. The most likely radii for a given neutron star mass are bracketed by models AP4 (smallest radius) and MS2 (largest radius). &quot;E&quot;B is the ratio of gravitational binding energy mass equivalent to the observed neutron star gravitational mass of &quot;M&quot; kilograms with radius &quot;R&quot; meters,

Given current values

*formula_10
*formula_11
and star masses &quot;M&quot; commonly reported as multiples of one solar mass,
formula_12
then the relativistic fractional binding energy of a neutron star is
formula_13

A neutron star would not be more compact than 10,970 meters radius (AP4 model). Its mass fraction gravitational binding energy would then be 0.187, −18.7% (exothermic). This is not near 0.6/2 = 0.3, −30%.

==Structure==
Current understanding of the structure of neutron stars is defined by existing mathematical models, but it might be possible to infer some details through studies of neutron-star oscillations. Asteroseismology, a study applied to ordinary stars, can reveal the inner structure of neutron stars by analyzing observed spectra of stellar oscillations.

Current models indicate that matter at the surface of a neutron star is composed of ordinary atomic nuclei crushed into a solid lattice with a sea of electrons flowing through the gaps between them. It is possible that the nuclei at the surface are iron, due to iron&#x27;s high binding energy per nucleon. It is also possible that heavy elements, such as iron, simply sink beneath the surface, leaving only light nuclei like helium and hydrogen. If the surface temperature exceeds (as in the case of a young pulsar), the surface should be fluid instead of the solid phase that might exist in cooler neutron stars (temperature &lt;).

The &quot;atmosphere&quot; of a neutron star is hypothesized to be at most several micrometers thick, and its dynamics are fully controlled by the neutron star&#x27;s magnetic field. Below the atmosphere one encounters a solid &quot;crust&quot;. This crust is extremely hard and very smooth (with maximum surface irregularities on the order of millimeters or less), due to the extreme gravitational field.

Proceeding inward, one encounters nuclei with ever-increasing numbers of neutrons; such nuclei would decay quickly on Earth, but are kept stable by tremendous pressures. As this process continues at increasing depths, the neutron drip becomes overwhelming, and the concentration of free neutrons increases rapidly.

After a supernova explosion of a supergiant star, neutron stars are born from the remnants. A neutron star is composed mostly of neutrons (neutral particles) and contains a small fraction of protons (positively charged particles) and electrons (negatively charged particles), as well as nuclei. In the extreme density of a neutron star, many neutrons are free neutrons, meaning they are not bound in atomic nuclei and move freely within the star&#x27;s dense matter, especially in the densest regions of the star—the inner crust and core. Over the star&#x27;s lifetime, as its density increases, the energy of the electrons also increases, which generates more neutrons.

In neutron stars, the neutron drip is the transition point where nuclei become so neutron-rich that they can no longer hold additional neutrons, leading to a sea of free neutrons being formed. The sea of neutrons formed after neutron drip provides additional pressure support, which helps maintain the star&#x27;s structural integrity and prevents gravitational collapse. The neutron drip takes place within the inner crust of the neutron star and starts when the density becomes so high that nuclei can no longer hold additional neutrons.

At the beginning of the neutron drip, the pressure in the star from neutrons, electrons, and the total pressure is roughly equal. As the density of the neutron star increases, the nuclei break down, and the neutron pressure of the star becomes dominant. When the density reaches a point where nuclei touch and subsequently merge, they form a fluid of neutrons with a sprinkle of electrons and protons. This transition marks the neutron drip, where the dominant pressure in the neutron star shifts from degenerate electrons to neutrons.

At very high densities, the neutron pressure becomes the primary pressure holding up the star, with neutrons being non-relativistic (moving slower than the speed of light) and extremely compressed. However, at extremely high densities, neutrons begin to move at relativistic speeds (close to the speed of light). These high speeds significantly increase the star&#x27;s overall pressure, altering the star&#x27;s equilibrium state, and potentially leading to the formation of exotic states of matter.

In that region, there are nuclei, free electrons, and free neutrons. The nuclei become increasingly small (gravity and pressure overwhelming the strong force) until the core is reached, by definition the point where mostly neutrons exist. The expected hierarchy of phases of nuclear matter in the inner crust has been characterized as &quot;nuclear pasta&quot;, with fewer voids and larger structures towards higher pressures.
The composition of the superdense matter in the core remains uncertain. One model describes the core as superfluid neutron-degenerate matter (mostly neutrons, with some protons and electrons). More exotic forms of matter are possible, including degenerate strange matter (containing strange quarks in addition to up and down quarks), matter containing high-energy pions and kaons in addition to neutrons, or ultra-dense quark-degenerate matter.

==Radiation==
===Pulsars===
Neutron stars are detected from their electromagnetic radiation. Neutron stars are usually observed to pulse radio waves and other electromagnetic radiation, and neutron stars observed with pulses are called pulsars.

Pulsars&#x27; radiation is thought to be caused by particle acceleration near their magnetic poles, which need not be aligned with the rotational axis of the neutron star. It is thought that a large electrostatic field builds up near the magnetic poles, leading to electron emission. These electrons are magnetically accelerated along the field lines, leading to curvature radiation, with the radiation being strongly polarized towards the plane of curvature. In addition, high-energy photons can interact with lower-energy photons and the magnetic field for electron−positron pair production, which through electron–positron annihilation leads to further high-energy photons.

The radiation emanating from the magnetic poles of neutron stars can be described as &quot;magnetospheric radiation&quot;, in reference to the magnetosphere of the neutron star. It is not to be confused with &quot;magnetic dipole radiation&quot;, which is emitted because the magnetic axis is not aligned with the rotational axis, with a radiation frequency the same as the neutron star&#x27;s rotational frequency.

If the axis of rotation of the neutron star is different from the magnetic axis, external viewers will only see these beams of radiation whenever the magnetic axis point towards them during the neutron star rotation. Therefore, periodic pulses are observed, at the same rate as the rotation of the neutron star.

In May 2022, astronomers reported an ultra-long-period radio-emitting neutron star PSR J0901-4046, with spin properties distinct from the known neutron stars. It is unclear how its radio emission is generated, and it challenges the current understanding of how pulsars evolve.

===Non-pulsating neutron stars===
In addition to pulsars, non-pulsating neutron stars have also been identified, although they may have minor periodic variation in luminosity. This seems to be a characteristic of the X-ray sources known as Central Compact Objects in supernova remnants (CCOs in SNRs), which are thought to be young, radio-quiet isolated neutron stars.

===Spectra===
In addition to radio emissions, neutron stars have also been identified in other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. This includes visible light, near infrared, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. Pulsars observed in X-rays are known as X-ray pulsars if accretion-powered, while those identified in visible light are known as optical pulsars. The majority of neutron stars detected, including those identified in optical, X-ray, and gamma rays, also emit radio waves; the Crab Pulsar produces electromagnetic emissions across the spectrum. However, there exist neutron stars called radio-quiet neutron stars, with no radio emissions detected.

==Rotation==

Neutron stars rotate extremely rapidly after their formation due to the conservation of angular momentum; in analogy to spinning ice skaters pulling in their arms, the slow rotation of the original star&#x27;s core speeds up as it shrinks. A newborn neutron star can rotate many times a second.

===Spin down===

Over time, neutron stars slow, as their rotating magnetic fields in effect radiate energy associated with the rotation; older neutron stars may take several seconds for each revolution. This is called &quot;spin down&quot;. The rate at which a neutron star slows its rotation is usually constant and very small.

The periodic time (&quot;P&quot;) is the rotational period, the time for one rotation of a neutron star. The spin-down rate, the rate of slowing of rotation, is then given the symbol formula_14 (&quot;P&quot;-dot), the derivative of &quot;P&quot; with respect to time. It is defined as periodic time increase per unit time; it is a dimensionless quantity, but can be given the units of s⋅s−1 (seconds per second).

The spin-down rate (&quot;P&quot;-dot) of neutron stars usually falls within the range of to , with the shorter period (or faster rotating) observable neutron stars usually having smaller &quot;P&quot;-dot. As a neutron star ages, its rotation slows (as &quot;P&quot; increases); eventually, the rate of rotation will become too slow to power the radio-emission mechanism, so radio emission from the neutron star no longer can be detected.

&quot;P&quot; and &quot;P&quot;-dot allow minimum magnetic fields of neutron stars to be estimated. &quot;P&quot; and &quot;P&quot;-dot can be also used to calculate the &quot;characteristic age&quot; of a pulsar, but gives an estimate which is somewhat larger than the true age when it is applied to young pulsars.

&quot;P&quot; and &quot;P&quot;-dot can also be combined with neutron star&#x27;s moment of inertia to estimate a quantity called &quot;spin-down luminosity&quot;, which is given the symbol formula_15 (&quot;E&quot;-dot). It is not the measured luminosity, but rather the calculated loss rate of rotational energy that would manifest itself as radiation. For neutron stars where the spin-down luminosity is comparable to the actual luminosity, the neutron stars are said to be &quot;rotation powered&quot;. The observed luminosity of the Crab Pulsar is comparable to the spin-down luminosity, supporting the model that rotational kinetic energy powers the radiation from it. With neutron stars such as magnetars, where the actual luminosity exceeds the spin-down luminosity by about a factor of one hundred, it is assumed that the luminosity is powered by magnetic dissipation, rather than being rotation powered.

&quot;P&quot; and &quot;P&quot;-dot can also be plotted for neutron stars to create a &quot;P&quot;–&quot;P&quot;-dot diagram. It encodes a tremendous amount of information about the pulsar population and its properties, and has been likened to the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram in its importance for neutron stars.

===Spin up===
Neutron star rotational speeds can increase, a process known as spin up. Sometimes neutron stars absorb orbiting matter from companion stars, increasing the rotation rate and reshaping the neutron star into an oblate spheroid. This causes an increase in the rate of rotation of the neutron star of over a hundred times per second in the case of millisecond pulsars.

The most rapidly rotating neutron star currently known, PSR J1748-2446ad, rotates at 716 revolutions per second. A 2007 paper reported the detection of an X-ray burst oscillation, which provides an indirect measure of spin, of 1122 Hz from the neutron star XTE J1739-285, suggesting 1122 rotations a second. However, at present, this signal has only been seen once, and should be regarded as tentative until confirmed in another burst from that star.

===Glitches and starquakes===

Sometimes a neutron star will undergo a glitch, a sudden small increase of its rotational speed or spin up. Glitches are thought to be the effect of a starquake—as the rotation of the neutron star slows, its shape becomes more spherical. Due to the stiffness of the &quot;neutron&quot; crust, this happens as discrete events when the crust ruptures, creating a starquake similar to earthquakes. After the starquake, the star will have a smaller equatorial radius, and because angular momentum is conserved, its rotational speed has increased.

Starquakes occurring in magnetars, with a resulting glitch, is the leading hypothesis for the gamma-ray sources known as soft gamma repeaters.

Recent work, however, suggests that a starquake would not release sufficient energy for a neutron star glitch; it has been suggested that glitches may instead be caused by transitions of vortices in the theoretical superfluid core of the neutron star from one metastable energy state to a lower one, thereby releasing energy that appears as an increase in the rotation rate.

===Anti-glitches===

An anti-glitch, a sudden small decrease in rotational speed, or spin down, of a neutron star has also been reported. It occurred in the magnetar 1E 2259+586, that in one case produced an X-ray luminosity increase of a factor of 20, and a significant spin-down rate change. Current neutron star models do not predict this behavior. If the cause were internal this suggests differential rotation of the solid outer crust and the superfluid component of the magnetar&#x27;s inner structure.

==Population and distances==
At present, there are about 3,200 known neutron stars in the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds, the majority of which have been detected as radio pulsars. Neutron stars are mostly concentrated along the disk of the Milky Way, although the spread perpendicular to the disk is large because the supernova explosion process can impart high translational speeds (400 km/s) to the newly formed neutron star.

Some of the closest known neutron stars are RX J1856.5−3754, which is about 400 light-years from Earth, and PSR J0108−1431 about 424 light-years. RX J1856.5-3754 is a member of a close group of neutron stars called The Magnificent Seven. Another nearby neutron star that was detected transiting the backdrop of the constellation Ursa Minor has been nicknamed Calvera by its Canadian and American discoverers, after the villain in the 1960 film &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;. This rapidly moving object was discovered using the ROSAT Bright Source Catalog.

Neutron stars are only detectable with modern technology during the earliest stages of their lives (almost always less than 1 million years) and are vastly outnumbered by older neutron stars that would only be detectable through their blackbody radiation and gravitational effects on other stars.

==Binary neutron star systems==

About 5% of all known neutron stars are members of a binary system. The formation and evolution of binary neutron stars and double neutron stars can be a complex process. Neutron stars have been observed in binaries with ordinary main-sequence stars, red giants, white dwarfs, or other neutron stars. According to modern theories of binary evolution, it is expected that neutron stars also exist in binary systems with black hole companions. The merger of binaries containing two neutron stars, or a neutron star and a black hole, has been observed through the emission of gravitational waves.

===X-ray binaries===

Binary systems containing neutron stars often emit X-rays, which are emitted by hot gas as it falls towards the surface of the neutron star. The source of the gas is the companion star, the outer layers of which can be stripped off by the gravitational force of the neutron star if the two stars are sufficiently close. As the neutron star accretes this gas, its mass can increase; if enough mass is accreted, the neutron star may collapse into a black hole.

===Neutron star binary mergers and nucleosynthesis===


The distance between two neutron stars in a close binary system is observed to shrink as gravitational waves are emitted. Ultimately, the neutron stars will come into contact and coalesce. The coalescence of binary neutron stars is one of the leading models for the origin of short gamma-ray bursts. Strong evidence for this model came from the observation of a kilonova associated with the short-duration gamma-ray burst GRB 130603B, and was finally confirmed by detection of gravitational wave GW170817 and short GRB 170817A by LIGO, Virgo, and 70 observatories covering the electromagnetic spectrum observing the event. The light emitted in the kilonova is believed to come from the radioactive decay of material ejected in the merger of the two neutron stars. The merger momentarily creates an environment of such extreme neutron flux that the &quot;r&quot;-process can occur; this—as opposed to supernova nucleosynthesis—may be responsible for the production of around half the isotopes in chemical elements beyond iron.

==Planets==
Neutron stars can host exoplanets. These can be original, circumbinary, captured, or the result of a second round of planet formation. Pulsars can also strip the atmosphere off from a star, leaving a planetary-mass remnant, which may be understood as a chthonian planet or a stellar object depending on interpretation. For pulsars, such pulsar planets can be detected with the pulsar timing method, which allows for high precision and detection of much smaller planets than with other methods. Two systems have been definitively confirmed. The first exoplanets ever to be detected were the three planets Draugr, Poltergeist and Phobetor around the pulsar Lich, discovered in 1992–1994. Of these, Draugr is the smallest exoplanet ever detected, at a mass of twice that of the Moon. Another system is PSR B1620−26, where a circumbinary planet orbits a neutron star-white dwarf binary system. Also, there are several unconfirmed candidates. Pulsar planets receive little visible light, but massive amounts of ionizing radiation and high-energy stellar wind, which makes them rather hostile environments to life as presently understood.

==History of discoveries==
At the meeting of the American Physical Society in December 1933 (the proceedings were published in January 1934), Walter Baade and Fritz Zwicky proposed the existence of neutron stars, less than two years after the discovery of the neutron by James Chadwick. In seeking an explanation for the origin of a supernova, they tentatively proposed that in supernova explosions ordinary stars are turned into stars that consist of extremely closely packed neutrons that they called neutron stars. Baade and Zwicky correctly proposed at that time that the release of the gravitational binding energy of the neutron stars powers the supernova: &quot;In the supernova process, mass in bulk is annihilated&quot;. Neutron stars were thought to be too faint to be detectable and little work was done on them until November 1967, when Franco Pacini pointed out that if the neutron stars were spinning and had large magnetic fields, then electromagnetic waves would be emitted. Unknown to him, radio astronomer Antony Hewish and his graduate student Jocelyn Bell at Cambridge were shortly to detect radio pulses from stars that are now believed to be highly magnetized, rapidly spinning neutron stars, known as pulsars.

In 1965, Antony Hewish and Samuel Okoye discovered &quot;an unusual source of high radio brightness temperature in the Crab Nebula&quot;. This source turned out to be the Crab Pulsar that resulted from the great supernova of 1054.

In 1967, Iosif Shklovsky examined the X-ray and optical observations of Scorpius X-1 and correctly concluded that the radiation comes from a neutron star at the stage of accretion.

In 1967, Jocelyn Bell Burnell and Antony Hewish discovered regular radio pulses from PSR B1919+21. This pulsar was later interpreted as an isolated, rotating neutron star. The energy source of the pulsar is the rotational energy of the neutron star. The majority of known neutron stars (about 2000, as of 2010) have been discovered as pulsars, emitting regular radio pulses.

In 1968, Richard V. E. Lovelace and collaborators discovered period formula_16 ms of the Crab pulsar using Arecibo Observatory. After this discovery, scientists concluded that pulsars were rotating neutron stars. Before that, many scientists believed that pulsars were pulsating white dwarfs.

In 1971, Riccardo Giacconi, Herbert Gursky, Ed Kellogg, R. Levinson, E. Schreier, and H. Tananbaum discovered 4.8 second pulsations in an X-ray source in the constellation Centaurus, Cen X-3. They interpreted this as resulting from a rotating hot neutron star. The energy source is gravitational and results from a rain of gas falling onto the surface of the neutron star from a companion star or the interstellar medium.

In 1974, Antony Hewish was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics &quot;for his decisive role in the discovery of pulsars&quot; without Jocelyn Bell who shared in the discovery.

In 1974, Joseph Taylor and Russell Hulse discovered the first binary pulsar, PSR B1913+16, which consists of two neutron stars (one seen as a pulsar) orbiting around their center of mass. Albert Einstein&#x27;s general theory of relativity predicts that massive objects in short binary orbits should emit gravitational waves, and thus that their orbit should decay with time. This was indeed observed, precisely as general relativity predicts, and in 1993, Taylor and Hulse were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for this discovery.

In 1982, Don Backer and colleagues discovered the first millisecond pulsar, PSR B1937+21. This object spins 642 times per second, a value that placed fundamental constraints on the mass and radius of neutron stars. Many millisecond pulsars were later discovered, but PSR B1937+21 remained the fastest-spinning known pulsar for 24 years, until PSR J1748-2446ad (which spins ~716 times a second) was discovered.

In 2003, Marta Burgay and colleagues discovered the first double neutron star system where both components are detectable as pulsars, PSR J0737−3039. The discovery of this system allows a total of 5 different tests of general relativity, some of these with unprecedented precision.

In 2010, Paul Demorest and colleagues measured the mass of the millisecond pulsar PSR J1614−2230 to be , using Shapiro delay. This was substantially higher than any previously measured neutron star mass (, see PSR J1903+0327), and places strong constraints on the interior composition of neutron stars.

In 2013, John Antoniadis and colleagues measured the mass of PSR J0348+0432 to be , using white dwarf spectroscopy. This confirmed the existence of such massive stars using a different method. Furthermore, this allowed, for the first time, a test of general relativity using such a massive neutron star.

In August 2017, LIGO and Virgo made first detection of gravitational waves produced by colliding neutron stars (GW170817), leading to further discoveries about neutron stars.

In October 2018, astronomers reported that GRB 150101B, a gamma-ray burst event detected in 2015, may be directly related to the historic GW170817 and associated with the merger of two neutron stars. The similarities between the two events, in terms of gamma ray, optical and x-ray emissions, as well as to the nature of the associated host galaxies, are &quot;striking&quot;, suggesting the two separate events may both be the result of the merger of neutron stars, and both may be a kilonova, which may be more common in the universe than previously understood, according to the researchers.

In July 2019, astronomers reported that a new method to determine the Hubble constant, and resolve the discrepancy of earlier methods, has been proposed based on the mergers of pairs of neutron stars, following the detection of the neutron star merger of GW170817. Their measurement of the Hubble constant is (km/s)/Mpc.

A 2020 study by University of Southampton PhD student Fabian Gittins suggested that surface irregularities (&quot;mountains&quot;) may only be fractions of a millimeter tall (about 0.000003% of the neutron star&#x27;s diameter), hundreds of times smaller than previously predicted, a result bearing implications for the non-detection of gravitational waves from spinning neutron stars.

Using the JWST, astronomers have identified a neutron star within the remnants of the Supernova 1987A stellar explosion after seeking to do so for 37 years, according to a 23 February 2024 &quot;Science&quot; article. In a paradigm shift, new JWST data provides the elusive direct confirmation of neutron stars within supernova remnants as well as a deeper understanding of the processes at play within SN 1987A&#x27;s remnants.

==Subtypes==
There are a number of types of object that consist of or contain a neutron star:
* Isolated neutron star (INS): not in a binary system.
** Rotation-powered pulsar (RPP or &quot;radio pulsar&quot;): neutron stars that emit directed pulses of radiation towards us at regular intervals (due to their strong magnetic fields).
*** Rotating radio transient (RRATs): are thought to be pulsars which emit more sporadically and/or with higher pulse-to-pulse variability than the bulk of the known pulsars.
** Magnetar: a neutron star with an extremely strong magnetic field (1000 times more than a regular neutron star), and long rotation periods (5 to 12 seconds).
*** Soft gamma repeater (SGR).
*** Anomalous X-ray pulsar (AXP).
** Radio-quiet neutron stars.
*** X-ray dim isolated neutron stars.
*** Central compact objects in supernova remnants (CCOs in SNRs): young, radio-quiet non-pulsating X-ray sources, thought to be Isolated Neutron Stars surrounded by supernova remnants.
* X-ray pulsars or &quot;accretion-powered pulsars&quot;: a class of X-ray binaries.
** Low-mass X-ray binary pulsars: a class of low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXB), a pulsar with a main sequence star, white dwarf or red giant.
*** Millisecond pulsar (MSP) (&quot;recycled pulsar&quot;).
**** &quot;Spider Pulsar&quot;, a pulsar where their companion is a semi-degenerate star.
***** &quot;Black Widow&quot; pulsar, a pulsar that falls under the &quot;Spider Pulsar&quot; if the companion has extremely low mass (less than ).
***** &quot;Redback&quot; pulsar, are if the companion is more massive.
**** Sub-millisecond pulsar.
*** X-ray burster: a neutron star with a low mass binary companion from which matter is accreted resulting in irregular bursts of energy from the surface of the neutron star.
** Intermediate-mass X-ray binary pulsars: a class of intermediate-mass X-ray binaries (IMXB), a pulsar with an intermediate mass star.
** High-mass X-ray binary pulsars: a class of high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXB), a pulsar with a massive star.
** Binary pulsars: a pulsar with a binary companion, often a white dwarf or neutron star.
** X-ray tertiary (theorized).

There are also a number of theorized compact stars with similar properties that are not actually neutron stars.
* Protoneutron star (PNS), a theorized intermediate–stage object that cools and contracts to form a neutron star or a black hole
* Exotic star
** Thorne–Żytkow object: currently a hypothetical merger of a neutron star into a red giant star.
** Quark star: currently a hypothetical type of neutron star composed of quark matter, or strange matter. As of 2018, there are three candidates.
** Electroweak star: currently a hypothetical type of extremely heavy neutron star, in which the quarks are converted to leptons through the electroweak force, but the gravitational collapse of the neutron star is prevented by radiation pressure. As of 2018, there is no evidence for their existence.
** Preon star: currently a hypothetical type of neutron star composed of preon matter. As of 2018, there is no evidence for the existence of preons.

==Examples of neutron stars==
* Black Widow Pulsar – a millisecond pulsar that is very massive
* PSR J0952-0607 – the heaviest neutron star with , a type of Black Widow Pulsar
* LGM-1 (now known as PSR B1919+21) – the first recognized radio-pulsar. It was discovered by Jocelyn Bell Burnell in 1967.
* PSR B1257+12 (Also known as Lich) – the first neutron star discovered with planets (a millisecond pulsar).
* PSR B1509−58 – source of the &quot;Hand of God&quot; photo shot by the Chandra X-ray Observatory
* RX J1856.5−3754 – the closest neutron star
* The Magnificent Seven – a group of nearby, X-ray dim isolated neutron stars
* PSR J0348+0432 – the most massive neutron star with a well-constrained mass, 
* SWIFT J1756.9-2508 – a millisecond pulsar with a stellar-type companion with planetary range mass (below brown dwarf)
*Swift J1818.0-1607 – the youngest-known magnetar

<doc id="21871" wikidata="Q2467" url="?curid=21871" title="Nassau, The Bahamas">
<text>Nassau ( ) is the capital and largest city of the Bahamas. It is located on the island of New Providence, which had a population of 246,329 in 2010, or just over 70% of the entire population of the Bahamas. As of April 2023, the preliminary results of the 2022 census of the Bahamas reported a population of 296,522 for New Providence, 74.26% of the country&#x27;s population. Nassau is commonly defined as a primate city, dwarfing all other towns in the country. It is the centre of commerce, education, law, administration, and media of the country.

Lynden Pindling International Airport, the major airport for the Bahamas, is located about west of the city centre of Nassau, and has daily flights to and from major cities in Canada, the Caribbean, the United Kingdom and the United States. Nassau is the site of the House of Assembly and various judicial departments and was considered historically to be a stronghold of pirates. The city was named in honour of William III of England, Prince of Orange-Nassau.

Nassau&#x27;s modern growth began in the late eighteenth century, with the influx of thousands of Loyalists and their slaves to the Bahamas following the American War of Independence. Many of them settled in Nassau and eventually came to outnumber the original inhabitants.

As the population of Nassau grew, so did its populated areas. Today, the city dominates the entire island. However, until the post-Second World War era, the outer suburbs scarcely existed. Most of New Providence was uncultivated bush until Loyalists were resettled there following the American Revolutionary War; they established several plantations, such as Clifton and Tusculum. Slaves were imported as labour.

After the British abolished the international slave trade in 1807, they resettled thousands of Africans liberated from slave ships by the Royal Navy on New Providence (at Adelaide Village and Gambier Village), along with other islands such as Grand Bahama, Exuma, Abaco and Inagua. In addition, slaves freed from American ships, such as the slave ship Creole in November 1841, were allowed to settle there. The largest concentration of Africans historically lived in the &quot;Over-the-Hill&quot; suburbs of Grants Town and Bain Town to the south of the city of Nassau, while most of the inhabitants of European descent lived on the island&#x27;s northern coastal ridges.

==History==
The town that would be called Nassau was founded in 1670 by British noblemen who brought British settlers with them to New Providence. They built a fort, and named it Charles Town in honour of England&#x27;s King Charles II. During this time there were frequent wars with the Spanish, and Charles Town was used as a base for privateering against them. In 1684 the town was burned to the ground during the Raid on Charles Town. It was rebuilt in 1695 under Governor Nicholas Trott and renamed Nassau in honour of King William III, who belonged to a branch of the House of Nassau. William was the Dutch Stadtholder (&quot;stadhouder&quot; in Dutch), and, from 1689, the King of England, Scotland and Ireland. The name Nassau ultimately derives from the town of Nassau in Germany.

Lacking effective governors after Trott, Nassau fell on hard times. In 1703 Spanish and French allied forces briefly occupied Nassau. More so, Nassau suffered greatly during the War of Spanish Succession and witnessed Spanish incursions during 1703, 1704 and 1706. From 1703 to 1718 there was no legitimate governor in the colony. Thomas Walker was the island&#x27;s last remaining appointed official and although evidence is scarce, it appears that he was acting in the role of deputy governor upon Benjamin Hornigold&#x27;s arrival in 1713. By this time, the sparsely settled Bahamas had become a pirate haven known as New Providence. The Governor of Bermuda stated that there were over 1,000 pirates in Nassau and that they outnumbered the mere hundred inhabitants of the town. They proclaimed Nassau a pirate republic, recognising the island&#x27;s prosperous state in which it offered fresh fruit, meat and water and plenty of protection amid its waterways. Nassau&#x27;s harbour was tailor-made for defence and it could take around 500 vessels, though it was too shallow to accept large battleships. Benjamin Hornigold, along with his great rival Henry Jennings, became the unofficial overlord of a veritable pirate republic which played host to the self-styled Flying Gang. Other pirates of note that spent time in Nassau included Charles Vane, Thomas Barrow (who declared himself &quot;Governor of New Providence&quot;), Calico Jack Rackham, Anne Bonny, Mary Read, and the infamous Edward Teach, better known as &quot;Blackbeard&quot;.

In 1718, the British government sought to regain control of the islands and appointed Captain Woodes Rogers as Royal governor. He successfully clamped down on the pirates, reformed the civil administration, and restored commerce. Rogers cleaned up Nassau and rebuilt the fort, using his own wealth to try to overcome problems. In 1720, the Spanish attacked Nassau but failed to capture the town and the island.

During the wars in the Thirteen Colonies, Nassau experienced an economic boom. With funds from privateering, a new fort, street lights and over 2300 sumptuous houses were built and Nassau was extended. In addition to this, mosquito breeding swamps were filled.

In 1776, the Battle of Nassau resulted in a brief occupation by American Continental Marines during the American War of Independence, where the marines staged their first amphibious raid on Fort Montague after attempting to sneak up on Fort Nassau. In 1778 after an overnight invasion, American raiders led by Captain Rathbun, left with ships, gunpowder and military stores after stopping in Nassau for only two weeks. In 1782 Spain captured Nassau for the last time when Don Juan de Cagigal, governor-general of Cuba, attacked New Providence with 5,000 men. In April 1783, Andrew Deveaux, an American Loyalist who resettled on the island, set forth and recaptured the island for the British Crown with just 220 men and 150 muskets to face a force of 600 trained soldiers.

Lord Dunmore governed the colony from 1787 to 1796. He oversaw the construction of Fort Charlotte and Fort Fincastle in Nassau.

During the American Civil War, Nassau served as a port for blockade runners making their way to and from ports along the southern Atlantic Coast for continued trade with the Confederacy.

In the 1920s and 1930s, Nassau profited from Prohibition in the United States.

During the Cuban Revolution of 1959, tourism further benefitted due to the restrictions imposed on American citizens visiting Cuba. Today, Nassau&#x27;s location close to the United States and ties between the U.S. and The Bahamas make it a common tourist destination.

==Geography==
Located on New Providence Island, Nassau&#x27;s harbour has a blend of old world and colonial architecture, and a busy port. The tropical climate and natural environment of the Bahamas have made Nassau an attractive tourist destination.

Nassau developed directly behind the port area. New Providence provides 200 km2 of relatively flat and low-lying land intersected by low ridges (none of which restricted settlement). In the centre of the island there are several shallow lakes that are tidally connected.

The city&#x27;s proximity to the United States (290 km (181 miles) east-southeast of Miami, Florida) has contributed to its popularity as a holiday resort, especially after the United States imposed a ban on travel to Cuba in 1963. The Atlantis resort on nearby Paradise Island accounts for more tourist arrivals to the city than any other hotel property of Nassau. The mega-resort employs over 6,000 Bahamians, and is the largest employer outside of the government.

===Climate===
Nassau has a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen: &quot;Am&quot;), bordering on a tropical savanna climate (Köppen: &quot;Aw&quot;), with hot wet summers, and mild dry winters. Temperatures are relatively consistent throughout the course of the year. During the wet season from May through October, average daytime high temperatures are , while during the dry season from November through April daytime temperatures are between , rarely falling below .



===Urban development===
During the 19th century, Nassau became urbanized, attracting rural residents. Growth since the 1950s has been outwards from the town. The 1788 heart of Nassau was just a few blocks of buildings between Government House and the harbour, but the town gradually expanded east to Malcolm&#x27;s Park, south to Wulff Road, and west to Nassau Street. Grants Town and Bain Town south of the city became the main residential areas for those of African descent, and until about 30 years ago was the most populous part of the city.

Those of European descent built houses along the shore, east as far as Fort Montagu, west as far as Saunders Beach, and along the ridge edging the city. During the 20th century, the city spread east to Village Road and west to Fort Charlotte and Oakes Field. This semicircle of residential development was the main area of settlement until after the Second World War, and marks a distinct phase in the city&#x27;s expansion, the outer boundary to this zone being the effective limit of the continuous built-up area. The wealthier residents continued to spread east (to East End Point) and West (to Lyford Cay).

In the last 40 years, residential development has been quite different. It has consisted mainly of planned middle-income sub-divisions. Since the 1960s, government has sponsored low-cost housing developments at Yellow Elder, Elizabeth Estates, and Pinewood Gardens, in the outer ring.

====City centre====

The city centre is the hub for all activities in Nassau. Thousands of people visit daily, to shop, dine, sightsee and to enjoy the tropical climate of the city. While the busiest part of central city is the Bay Street thoroughfare and the Woodes Rogers Walk, located across the street from the port and parallel to Bay, the area extends for several blocks in each direction. It starts at West Bay, around the Junkanoo Beach area. A few hotels and restaurants are located on West Bay.

The next landmark is the British Colonial Hotel, which marks the beginning of Bay Street proper. Pirates of Nassau Museum is just across from the British Colonial Hilton. The next few blocks of Bay Street are wall-to-wall boutiques, with a few restaurants and clubs interspersed throughout the retailers.

Historical landmarks are also in the vicinity, including Vendue House, Christ Church Cathedral, and the Nassau Public Library. Although the tourist part of the city centre peters out after about seven blocks, smaller, more local shops are located down Bay Street. At this point, Bay Street becomes East Bay.

The Straw Market is a tourist destination in the city centre. A new market was opened in 2011 after a fire in 2001 destroyed the original Fish, Vegetable and Straw Market. The market is open on all sides, and contains a number of Bahamian craft stores.

====Cable Beach====

Cable Beach is recognized as the hotel district of Nassau. Five hotels—two of which are all-inclusive—are located on this strip. The area is also known for its dining, with most of the area&#x27;s restaurants located in the hotels or across the street. There is a bit of shopping, most of it located in the Wyndham and at Baha Mar. In 2017, the development of Baha Mar, a luxury resort and casino, brought more than 2,000 hotel rooms and the largest gaming and convention facility in the Caribbean to this section of New Providence Island.

==Demographics==

Nassau had a population of 128,420 females and 117,909 males and was home to 70,222 households with an average family size of 3.5 according to the 2010 census. Nassau&#x27;s large population in relation to the remainder of the Bahamas is the result of waves of immigration from the Family Islands to the capital. Consequently, this has led to the decline in the population of the lesser developed islands and the rapid growth of Nassau.

===Public safety===
In January 2018, the U.S. Department of State issued the latest in a series of travel advisories due to violent crime.

==Transport==
===Air===
Lynden Pindling International Airport (formerly Nassau International Airport) is located on the western side of Nassau. New Providence Airport on Paradise Island was closed in 1999 with runway removed and integrated into the resort on the island.

===Water===
Ferries (boats) provide water travel around Nassau to the surrounding islands, namely Paradise Island.

Prince George Wharf is a seaport, the main port in the city, that serves cruise ships with ports of call in Nassau.

Transportation and shipping around the Family Islands is primarily through mailboats based at Potters Cay. International shipping is done through the Arawak Port Department on Arawak Cay. High speed excursions to Exuma, Spanish Wells and Harbour Island are available daily.

===Roads===

Public jitney buses and taxis provide transport in and around Nassau. Rental cars are also available in the city and at the airport.

Major roads in Nassau include:
*Bay Street
*Eastern Road
*Baillou Hill Road (Pronounced &quot;Blue Hill Road&quot; by locals)
*East Street
*Adelaide Road
*Shirley Street
*Soldier Road
*Carmicheal Road
*Prince Charles Drive
*John F Kennedy Drive
*Fox Hill Road
*Wulff Road
*Robinson Road

The major road in Nassau is Bay Street for tourists. Bay Street runs the entire length of the Island from East to West. Bay Street also provides beachfront views. The downtown area and the cruise ships are in walking distance.

The Bahamas is a left-hand traffic country, but many cars are imported from the US and are left-hand drive.

==Culture==
===UNESCO Creative Cities Network===

Nassau has been recognized as a part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network as a city of Crafts and Folk Art. It is one of only three Caribbean cities to receive this honour.

===Junkanoo===
The city&#x27;s chief festival is Junkanoo, an energetic, colourful street parade of brightly costumed people dancing to the rhythmic accompaniment of cowbells, drums and whistles. The word &#x27;Junkanoo&#x27; is derived from the name of the founder: John Canoe. The celebration occurs on December 26, July 10 and January 1, beginning in the early hours of the morning (1:00 a.m.) and ending around 10 a.m. At the end of the Junkanoo procession, judges award cash prizes for the best music, costumes, and overall group presentation. Participants spend all year preparing their handmade costumes by using coloured crepe paper and cardboard.

==In popular culture==
Nassau was the main setting for the Starz Network show &quot;Black Sails&quot; (2014–2017). However, filming was based in South Africa.

Nassau was featured as an important setting in several movies, including the Beatles film &quot;Help!&quot; and the James Bond films &quot;Thunderball&quot; (1965), &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; (1983), and &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (2006). Nassau has also served as a shooting location for film production. In 1981, Nassau was used as a stand-in for Greece in an ocean scene in &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;.

Several other late-20th- and 21st-century movies have been set here, including &quot;After the Sunset&quot; (2004), &quot;Into the Blue&quot; (2005), and &quot;Flipper&quot; (1996).

It hosted the Miss Universe 2009 pageant.

Nassau was featured as a primary setting in the 2013 video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed IV: Black Flag&quot; (2013).

Nassau Town is mentioned in &quot;Sloop John B&quot;, a Bahamian folk song. Since the early 1950s there have been many recordings of the song, the best known being by The Beach Boys on their &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; album.

Nassau is the subject of &quot;Funky Nassau,&quot; a song written by Ray Munnings and Tyrone Fitzgerald and recorded by the Nassau-based funk band The Beginning of the End in 1971 as the single from their album of the same name. The song reached #7 on the US R&amp;B chart, #15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and #31 on the UK Singles Chart in 1971.

<text>Nastassja Aglaia Kinski (; born Nakszynski, ; born 24 January 1961) is a German actress and former model who has appeared in more than 60 films in Europe and the United States. Her worldwide breakthrough was with &quot;Stay as You Are&quot; (1978). She then came to global prominence with her Golden Globe Award-winning performance as the title character in the Roman Polanski-directed film &quot;Tess&quot; (1979). Other films in which she acted include the Francis Ford Coppola musical romance film &quot;One from the Heart&quot; (1982), erotic horror film &quot;Cat People&quot; (1982) from Paul Schrader, and the Wim Wenders drama films &quot;Paris, Texas&quot; (1984) and &quot;Faraway, So Close!&quot; (1993). She also appeared in the biographical drama film &quot;An American Rhapsody&quot; (2001). She is the daughter of German actor Klaus Kinski.

==Early life==

Kinski was born in West Berlin as Nastassja Aglaia Nakszynski. She is the daughter of German actor Klaus Kinski and his second wife, actress Ruth Brigitte Tocki. She is of partial Polish descent, for her grandfather Bruno Nakszynski was a Germanized ethnic Pole. Kinski has two half-siblings: Pola and Nikolai Kinski. Her parents divorced in 1968. After the age of 10, Kinski rarely saw her father. Her young mother struggled financially to support them; they eventually lived in a commune in Munich.

In a 1999 interview, Kinski denied that her father had molested her as a child, but said he had abused her &quot;in other ways&quot;. In 2013, when interviewed about the allegations of sexual abuse made by her half-sister Pola Kinski, she confirmed that he attempted this with her, but did not succeed. She said, &quot;He was no father. Ninety-nine percent of the time I was terrified of him. He was so unpredictable that the family lived in constant terror.&quot; When asked what she would say to him now, if she had the chance, she replied, &quot;I would do anything to put him behind bars for life. I am glad he is no longer alive.&quot;

==Career==

Kinski began working as a model as a teenager in Germany. Actress Lisa Kreuzer of the German New Wave helped get her the role of the mute Mignon in Wim Wenders 1975 film &quot;The Wrong Move&quot;, in which at the age of 12 she was depicted topless. She later played one of the leading roles in Wenders&#x27; film &quot;Paris, Texas&quot; (1984) and appeared in his film &quot;Faraway, So Close&quot; (1993).

In 1976, while still a teenager, Kinski had her first two major roles: in Wolfgang Petersen&#x27;s feature film-length episode &quot;Reifezeugnis&quot; of the German TV crime series &quot;Tatort.&quot; Next, she appeared in the British horror film &quot;To the Devil a Daughter&quot; (1976), produced by Hammer Film Productions, which was released in the UK just 40 days after Kinski&#x27;s fifteenth birthday, making it a virtual certainty she was only fourteen when her scenes were shot (including full frontal nudity). In regards to her early films, Kinski has stated that she felt exploited by the industry. In an interview with &quot;W&quot;, she said, &quot;If I had had somebody to protect me or if I had felt more secure about myself, I would not have accepted certain things. Nudity things. And inside it was just tearing me apart.&quot;

In 1978, Kinski starred in the Italian romance &quot;Stay as You Are&quot; (&quot;Così come sei&quot;) with Marcello Mastroianni, gaining her recognition in the United States after New Line Cinema released it there in December 1979. &quot;Time&quot; wrote that she was &quot;simply ravishing, genuinely sexy and high-spirited without being painfully aggressive about it.&quot; The film also received a major international release from Columbia Pictures.

Kinski met the director Roman Polanski at a party in 1976. He urged her to study method acting with Lee Strasberg in the United States and she was offered the title role in Polanski&#x27;s upcoming film, &quot;Tess&quot; (1979). In 1978, Kinski underwent extensive preparation for the portrayal of an English peasant girl, which included acquiring a Dorset accent through elocution studies:

The film was nominated for six awards, including Best Picture, at the 53rd Academy Awards, and won three.

In 1981, Richard Avedon photographed Kinski with a Burmese python coiled around her nude body. The image, which first appeared in the October 1981 issue of US &quot;Vogue&quot;, was released as a poster and became a best-seller, further confirming her status as a sex symbol.

In 1982, she starred in Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s romantic musical &quot;One from the Heart&quot;, her first film made in the United States. &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; described her as acting &quot;as a Felliniesque circus performer to represent the twinkling evanescence of Eros.&quot; The film failed at the box office and was a major loss for Coppola&#x27;s new Zoetrope Studios. That year, she was also in the erotic supernatural horror movie &quot;Cat People&quot;. On 29 December 1982, Kinski made a puzzling appearance on the program &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;, seeming somewhat oblivious to the jokes and everything else that was going on around her and appearing with an unusual hair style Letterman described as &quot;looking like there was an owl perched on top of her head.&quot; (Letterman&#x27;s second guest, John Candy, came out with his own hair moussed up in a pile as a spoof of Kinski&#x27;s hair.)

Dudley Moore&#x27;s comedy &quot;Unfaithfully Yours&quot; and an adaptation of John Irving&#x27;s &quot;The Hotel New Hampshire&quot; followed in 1984.

Kinski reteamed with Wenders for the 1984 film &quot;Paris, Texas&quot;. One of her most acclaimed films to date, it won the top award at the Cannes Film Festival. Throughout the 1980s, Kinski split her time between Europe and the United States, making &quot;Moon in the Gutter&quot; (1983), &quot;Harem&quot; (1985) and &quot;Torrents of Spring&quot; (1989) in Europe, and &quot;Exposed&quot; (1983), &quot;Maria&#x27;s Lovers&quot; (1984), and &quot;Revolution&quot; (1985) in the United States.

During the 1990s, Kinski appeared in a number of American films, including the action movie &quot;Terminal Velocity&quot; opposite Charlie Sheen, the Mike Figgis 1997 adultery tale &quot;One Night Stand&quot;, &quot;Your Friends &amp; Neighbors&quot; (1998), John Landis&#x27;s &quot;Susan&#x27;s Plan&quot; (1998), and &quot;The Lost Son&quot; (1999).

Her most recent films include David Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Inland Empire&quot; (2006) and Rotimi Rainwater&#x27;s &quot;Sugar&quot; (2013). In 2016, she competed in the German &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; show.

==Personal life==

In 1976, when Kinski was aged 15, it was speculated that there had been a romantic relationship with director Roman Polanski, who at the time was 43. Polanski confirmed the relationship in a 1994 interview with Diane Sawyer: &quot;...what about Nastassja Kinski? She was young and we had a love affair.&quot; However, in a 1999 interview in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Kinski was quoted as saying that there was no affair and that, &quot;There was a flirtation. There could have been a seduction, but there was not. He had respect for me.&quot;

Kinski has three children from different relationships. Her first child, son Aljosha Nakszynski (born 29 June 1984), was fathered by actor Vincent Spano, her co-star in &quot;Maria&#x27;s Lovers&quot;. On 10 September 1984, Kinski married Egyptian filmmaker Ibrahim Moussa, with whom she had daughter Sonja Kinski (born 2 March 1986). The marriage was dissolved in July 1992. From 1992 until 1995, Kinski lived with musician Quincy Jones, though she kept her own apartment on Hilgard Avenue, near UCLA, at the time. They had a daughter, Kenya Julia Niambi Sarah Jones (born 9 February 1993), a model known professionally as Kenya Kinski-Jones.

In 1997, Kinski dated married producer Jonathan D. Krane during a brief separation from his wife, actress Sally Kellerman. Over the course of her career, Kinski has also been romantically linked with Paul Schrader, Jean-Jacques Beineix, Rob Lowe, Jon Voight, Gérard Depardieu, Dudley Moore, Miloš Forman and Wim Wenders. As of 2012, she was dating actor Rick Yune.

In 2001, Kinski stated in an interview in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; that she was affected by the sleep disorder narcolepsy.

<text>The Nuremberg trials were held by the Allies against representatives of the defeated Nazi Germany for plotting and carrying out invasions of other countries across Europe and committing atrocities against their citizens in World War II.

Between 1939 and 1945, Nazi Germany invaded many countries across Europe, inflicting 27 million deaths in the Soviet Union alone. Proposals for how to punish the defeated Nazi leaders ranged from a show trial (the Soviet Union) to summary executions (the United Kingdom). In mid-1945, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States agreed to convene a joint tribunal in Nuremberg, occupied Germany, with the Nuremberg Charter as its legal instrument. Between 20 November 1945 and 1 October 1946, the International Military Tribunal (IMT) tried 22 of the most important surviving leaders of Nazi Germany in the political, military, and economic spheres, as well as six German organizations. The purpose of the trial was not just to convict the defendants but also to assemble irrefutable evidence of Nazi crimes, offer a history lesson to the defeated Germans, and delegitimize the traditional German elite.

The IMT verdict followed the prosecution in declaring the crime of plotting and waging aggressive war &quot;the supreme international crime&quot; because &quot;it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole&quot;. Most of the defendants were also charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity, and the systematic murder of millions of Jews in the Holocaust was significant to the trial. Twelve further trials were conducted by the United States against lower-level perpetrators, which focused more on the Holocaust. Controversial at the time for their retroactive criminalization of aggression, the trials&#x27; innovation of holding individuals responsible for violations of international law is considered &quot;the true beginning of international criminal law&quot;.
==Origin==

Between 1939 and 1945, Nazi Germany invaded many European countries, including Poland, Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, France, Yugoslavia, Greece, and the Soviet Union. German aggression was accompanied by immense brutality in occupied areas; war losses in the Soviet Union alone included 27 million dead, mostly civilians, which was one seventh of the prewar population. The legal reckoning was premised on the extraordinary nature of Nazi criminality, particularly the perceived singularity of the systematic murder of millions of Jews.

The first step towards the trials of Nazi war criminals were initiatives taken by the governments-in-exile of countries occupied by Germany, especially Poland, which as early as December 1939 established agencies aimed at recording crimes committed by Germany in Poland for their later prosecution. These efforts resulted in a Polish-French-British declaration on April 18, 1940, holding Germany responsible for the crimes, without an explicit promise of their prosecution. Such a promise was included in a declaration by the occupied countries in November 1941, gathered at a conference organized on Poland&#x27;s initiative. Another conference, held in January 1942, saw the participation of observers from the USSR, US, China, and the United Kingdom. It adopted a declaration promising to punish both direct perpetrators and their superiors, which later became the basis of the Nuremberg system. The Inter-Allied Commission on the Punishment of War Crimes was also established at that time. The United States and United Kingdom refused to endorse this proposal, citing the failure of war crimes prosecutions after World War I. 

Pressures, primarily from Poland and Czechoslovakia, led the British to take concrete steps in the area of prosecuting German crimes. The London-based United Nations War Crimes Commission—without Soviet participation—first met in October 1943 and became bogged down in the scope of its mandate, with Belgian jurist Marcel de Baer and Czech legal scholar Bohuslav Ečer arguing for a broader definition of war crimes that would include &quot;the crime of war&quot;. On 1 November 1943, the Soviet Union, United Kingdom, and United States issued the Moscow Declaration, warning the Nazi leadership of the signatories&#x27; intent to &quot;pursue them to the uttermost ends of the earth...in order that justice may be done&quot;. The declaration stated that those high-ranking Nazis who had committed crimes in several countries would be dealt with jointly, while others would be tried where they had committed their crimes.

Soviet jurist Aron Trainin developed the concept of crimes against peace (waging aggressive war) which would later be central to the proceedings at Nuremberg. Trainin&#x27;s ideas were reprinted in the West and widely adopted. Of all the Allies, the Soviet Union lobbied most intensely for trying the defeated German leaders for aggression in addition to war crimes. The Soviet Union wanted to hold a trial with a predetermined outcome similar to the 1930s Moscow trials, in order to demonstrate the Nazi leaders&#x27; guilt and build a case for war reparations to rebuild the Soviet economy, which had been devastated by the war. The United States insisted on a trial that would be seen as legitimate as a means of reforming Germany and demonstrating the superiority of the Western system. The United States Department of War was drawing up plans for an international tribunal in late 1944 and early 1945. The British government still preferred the summary execution of Nazi leaders, citing the failure of trials after World War I and qualms about retroactive criminality. The form that retribution would take was left unresolved at the Yalta Conference in February 1945. On 2 May, at the San Francisco Conference, United States president Harry S. Truman announced the formation of an international military tribunal. On 8 May, Germany surrendered unconditionally, bringing an end to the war in Europe.

==Establishment==
===Nuremberg charter===


At the London Conference, held from 26 June to 2 August 1945, representatives of France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States negotiated the form that the trial would take. Until the end of the negotiations, it was not clear that any trial would be held at all.

The offenses that would be prosecuted were crimes against peace, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. At the conference, it was debated whether wars of aggression were prohibited in existing customary international law; regardless, before the charter was adopted there was no law providing for criminal responsibility for aggression. Despite misgivings from other Allies, American negotiator and Supreme Court justice Robert H. Jackson threatened the United States&#x27; withdrawal if aggression was not prosecuted because it had been the rationale for American entry into World War II. However, Jackson conceded on defining crimes against peace; the other three Allies were opposed because it would undermine the freedom of action of the United Nations Security Council.

War crimes already existed in international law as criminal violations of the laws and customs of war, but these did not apply to a government&#x27;s treatment of its own citizens. Legal experts sought a way to try crimes against German citizens, such as the German Jews. A Soviet proposal for a charge of &quot;crimes against civilians&quot; was renamed &quot;crimes against humanity&quot; at Jackson&#x27;s suggestion after previous uses of the term in the post-World War I Commission of Responsibilities and in failed efforts to prosecute the perpetrators of the Armenian genocide. The British proposal to define crimes against humanity was largely accepted, with the final wording being &quot;murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, and other inhumane acts committed against any civilian population&quot;. The final version of the charter limited the tribunal&#x27;s jurisdiction over crimes against humanity to those committed as part of a war of aggression. Both the United States—concerned that its &quot;Jim Crow&quot; system of racial segregation not be labeled a crime against humanity—and the Soviet Union wanted to avoid giving an international court jurisdiction over a government&#x27;s treatment of its own citizens.

The charter upended the traditional view of international law by holding individuals, rather than states, responsible for breaches. The other three Allies&#x27; proposal to limit the definition of the crimes to acts committed by the defeated Axis was rejected by Jackson. Instead, the charter limited the jurisdiction of the court to Germany&#x27;s actions. Article 7 prevented the defendants from claiming sovereign immunity, and the plea of acting under superior orders was left for the judges to decide. The trial was held under modified common law. The negotiators decided that the tribunal&#x27;s permanent seat would be in Berlin, while the trial would be held at the Palace of Justice in Nuremberg. Located in the American occupation zone, Nuremberg was a symbolic location as the site of Nazi rallies. The Palace of Justice was relatively intact but needed to be renovated for the trial due to bomb damage; it had an attached prison where the defendants could be held. On 8 August, the Nuremberg Charter was signed in London.

===Judges and prosecutors===
In early 1946, there were a thousand employees from the four countries&#x27; delegations in Nuremberg, of which about two thirds were from the United States. Besides legal professionals, there were many social-science researchers, psychologists, translators, and interpreters, and graphic designers, the last to make the many charts used during the trial. Each state appointed a prosecution team and two judges, one being a deputy without voting rights.

Jackson was appointed the United States&#x27; chief prosecutor, whom historian Kim Christian Priemel describes as &quot;a versatile politician and a remarkable orator, if not a great legal thinker&quot;. The United States prosecution believed that Nazism was the product of a German deviation from the West (the &quot;Sonderweg&quot; thesis) and sought to correct this deviation with a trial that would serve both retributive and educational purposes. As the largest delegation, it would take on the bulk of the prosecutorial effort. At Jackson&#x27;s recommendation, the United States appointed judges Francis Biddle and John Parker. The British chief prosecutor was Hartley Shawcross, Attorney General for England and Wales, assisted by his predecessor David Maxwell Fyfe. Although the chief British judge, Sir Geoffrey Lawrence (Lord Justice of Appeal), was the nominal president of the tribunal, in practice Biddle exercised more authority.

The French prosecutor, François de Menthon, had just overseen trials of the leaders of Vichy France; he resigned in January 1946 and was replaced by Auguste Champetier de Ribes. The French judges were Henri Donnedieu de Vabres, a professor of criminal law, and deputy Robert Falco, a judge of the Cour de Cassation who had represented France at the London Conference. The French government tried to appoint staff who were not tainted by collaboration with the Vichy regime; some appointments, including Champetier de Ribes, were of those who had been in the French resistance. Expecting a show trial, the Soviet Union initially appointed as chief prosecutor Iona Nikitchenko, who had presided over the Moscow trials, but he was made a judge and replaced by Roman Rudenko, a show trial prosecutor chosen for his skill as an orator. The Soviet judges and prosecutors were not permitted to make any major decisions without consulting a commission in Moscow led by Soviet politician Andrei Vyshinsky; the resulting delays hampered the Soviet effort to set the agenda. The influence of the Soviet delegation was also constrained by limited English proficiency, lack of interpreters, and unfamiliarity with diplomacy and international institutions.

Requests by Chaim Weizmann, the president of the World Zionist Organization, as well as the Provisional Government of National Unity in Poland, for an active role in the trial justified by their representation of victims of Nazi crimes were rejected. The Soviet Union invited prosecutors from its allies, including Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia; Denmark and Norway also sent a delegation. Although the Polish delegation was not empowered to intervene in the proceedings, it submitted evidence and an indictment, succeeding at drawing some attention to crimes committed against Polish Jews and non-Jews.

===Indictment===
The work of drafting the indictment was divided up by the national delegations. The British worked on aggressive war; the other delegations were assigned the task of covering crimes against humanity and war crimes committed on the Western Front (France) and the Eastern Front (the Soviet Union). The United States delegation outlined the overall Nazi conspiracy and criminality of Nazi organizations. The British and American delegations decided to work jointly in drafting the charges of conspiracy to wage aggressive war. On 17 September, the various delegations met to discuss the indictment.

The charge of conspiracy, absent from the charter, held together the wide array of charges and defendants and was used to charge the top Nazi leaders, as well as bureaucrats who had never killed anyone or perhaps even directly ordered killing. It was also an end run on the charter&#x27;s limits on charging crimes committed before the beginning of World War II. Conspiracy charges were central to the cases against propagandists and industrialists: the former were charged with providing the ideological justification for war and other crimes, while the latter were accused of enabling Germany&#x27;s war effort. The charge, a brainchild of War Department lawyer Murray C. Bernays, and perhaps inspired by his previous work prosecuting securities fraud, was spearheaded by the United States and less popular with the other delegations, particularly France.

The problem of translating the indictment and evidence into the three official languages of the tribunal—English, French, and Russian—as well as German was severe due to the scale of the task and difficulty of recruiting interpreters, especially in the Soviet Union. Vyshinsky demanded extensive corrections to the charges of crimes against peace, especially regarding the role of the German–Soviet pact in starting World War II. Jackson also separated out an overall conspiracy charge from the other three charges, aiming that the American prosecution would cover the overall Nazi conspiracy while the other delegations would flesh out the details of Nazi crimes. The division of labor, and the haste with which the indictment was prepared, resulted in duplication, imprecise language, and lack of attribution of specific charges to individual defendants.

===Defendants===

Some of the most prominent Nazis—Adolf Hitler, Heinrich Himmler, and Joseph Goebbels—had committed suicide and therefore could not be tried. The prosecutors wanted to try representative leaders of German politics, economy, and military. Most of the defendants had surrendered to the United States or United Kingdom.

The defendants, who were largely unrepentant, included former cabinet ministers: Franz von Papen (who had brought Hitler to power), Joachim von Ribbentrop (foreign minister), Konstantin von Neurath (foreign minister), Wilhelm Frick (interior minister), and Alfred Rosenberg (minister for the occupied eastern territories). Also prosecuted were leaders of the German economy, such as Gustav Krupp (of the conglomerate Krupp AG), former Reichsbank president Hjalmar Schacht, and economic planners Albert Speer and Walther Funk, along with Speer&#x27;s subordinate and head of the forced labor program, Fritz Sauckel. While the British were skeptical of prosecuting economic leaders, the French had a strong interest in highlighting German economic imperialism. The military leaders were Hermann Göring—the most infamous surviving Nazi and the main target of the trial—Wilhelm Keitel, Alfred Jodl, Erich Raeder, and Karl Dönitz. Also on trial were propagandists Julius Streicher and Hans Fritzsche; Rudolf Hess, Hitler&#x27;s deputy who had flown to Britain in 1941; Hans Frank, governor-general of the General Governorate of Poland; Hitler Youth leader Baldur von Schirach; Arthur Seyss-Inquart, Reich Commissioner for the Netherlands; and Ernst Kaltenbrunner, the leader of Himmler&#x27;s Reich Security Main Office. Observers of the trial found the defendants mediocre and contemptible.

Although the list of defendants was finalized on 29 August, as late as October, Jackson demanded the addition of new names, but this was rejected. Of the 24 men indicted, Martin Bormann was tried &quot;in absentia&quot;, as the Allies were unaware of his death; Krupp was too ill to stand trial; and Robert Ley had committed suicide before the start of the trial. Former Nazis were allowed to serve as counsel and by mid-November all defendants had lawyers. The defendants&#x27; lawyers jointly appealed to the court, claiming it did not have jurisdiction against the accused; but this motion was rejected. The defense lawyers saw themselves as acting on behalf of their clients, but also the German nation. All the defendants entered &quot;not guilty&quot; pleas except for Hess, who refused to enter a plea at all, and Kaltenbrunner, who was hospitalized and unable to attend the early weeks of the proceedings; von Neurath also gave an ambiguous response that could have been interpreted either as his pleading &quot;not guilty&quot; or refusing to enter a plea. &quot;Not guilty&quot; pleas were therefore entered on their behalf, as well as that of Bormann, and no-one pleaded otherwise at any point in the trial.

Initially, the Americans had planned to try fourteen organizations and their leaders, but this was narrowed to six: the Reich Cabinet, the Leadership Corps of the Nazi Party, the Gestapo, the SA, the SS and the SD, and the General Staff and High Command of the German military (Wehrmacht). The aim was to have these organizations declared criminal, so that their members could be tried expeditiously for membership in a criminal organization. Senior American officials believed that convicting organizations was a good way of showing that not just the top German leaders were responsible for crimes, without condemning the entire German people.

===Evidence===
Over the summer, all of the national delegations struggled to gather evidence for the upcoming trial. The American and British prosecutors focused on documentary evidence and affidavits rather than testimony from survivors. This strategy increased the credibility of their case, since survivor testimony was considered less reliable and more vulnerable to accusations of bias, but reduced public interest in the proceedings. The American prosecution drew on reports of the Office of Strategic Services, an American intelligence agency, and information provided by the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research and the American Jewish Committee, while the French prosecution presented many documents that it had obtained from the Center of Contemporary Jewish Documentation. The prosecution called 37 witnesses compared to the defense&#x27;s 83, not including 19 defendants who testified on their own behalf. The prosecution examined 110,000 captured German documents and entered 4,600 into evidence, along with of film and 25,000 photographs.

The charter allowed the admissibility of any evidence deemed to have probative value, including depositions. Because of the loose evidentiary rules, photographs, charts, maps, and films played an important role in making incredible crimes believable. After the American prosecution submitted many documents at the beginning of the trial, the judges insisted that all of the evidence be read into the record, which slowed the trial. The structure of the charges also caused delays as the same evidence ended up being read out multiple times, when it was relevant to both conspiracy and the other charges.

==Course of the trial==
The International Military Tribunal began trial on 20 November 1945, after postponement requests from the Soviet prosecution, who wanted more time to prepare its case, were rejected. All defendants pleaded not guilty. Jackson made it clear that the trial&#x27;s purpose extended beyond convicting the defendants. Prosecutors wanted to assemble irrefutable evidence of Nazi crimes, establish individual responsibility and the crime of aggression in international law, provide a history lesson to the defeated Germans, delegitimize the traditional German elite, and allow the Allies to distance themselves from appeasement. Jackson maintained that while the United States did &quot;not seek to convict the whole German people of crime&quot;, neither did the trial &quot;serve to absolve the whole German people except 21 men in the dock&quot;. Nevertheless, defense lawyers (although not most of the defendants) often argued that the prosecution was trying to promote German collective guilt and forcefully countered this strawman. According to Priemel, the conspiracy charge &quot;invited apologetic interpretations: narratives of absolute, totalitarian dictatorship, run by society&#x27;s lunatic fringe, of which the Germans had been the first victims rather than agents, collaborators, and fellow travellers&quot;. In contrast, the evidence presented on the Holocaust convinced some observers that Germans must have been aware of this crime while it was ongoing.

===American and British prosecution===

On 21 November, Jackson gave the opening speech for the prosecution. He described the fact that the defeated Nazis received a trial as &quot;one of the most significant tributes that Power has ever paid to Reason&quot;. Focusing on aggressive war, which he described as the root of the other crimes, Jackson promoted an intentionalist view of the Nazi state and its overall criminal conspiracy. The speech was favorably received by the prosecution, the tribunal, the audience, historians, and even the defendants.

Much of the American case focused on the development of the Nazi conspiracy before the outbreak of war. The American prosecution became derailed during attempts to provide evidence on the first act of aggression, against Austria. On 29 November, the prosecution was unprepared to continue presenting on the invasion of Czechoslovakia, and instead screened &quot;Nazi Concentration and Prison Camps&quot;. The film, compiled from footage of the liberation of Nazi concentration camps, shocked both the defendants and the judges, who adjourned the trial. Indiscriminate selection and disorganized presentation of documentary evidence without tying it to specific defendants hampered the American prosecutors&#x27; work on the conspiracy to commit crimes against humanity. The Americans summoned commander Otto Ohlendorf, who testified about the murder of 80,000 people by those under his command, and SS general Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski, who admitted that German anti-partisan warfare was little more than a cover for the mass murder of Jews.

The British prosecution covered the charge of crimes against peace, which was largely redundant to the American conspiracy case. On 4 December, Shawcross gave the opening speech, much of which had been written by Cambridge professor Hersch Lauterpacht. Unlike Jackson, Shawcross attempted to minimize the novelty of the aggression charges, elaborating its precursors in the conventions of Hague and Geneva, the League of Nations Covenant, the Locarno Treaty, and the Kellogg–Briand Pact. The British took four days to make their case, with Maxwell Fyfe detailing treaties broken by Germany. In mid-December the Americans switched to presenting the case against the indicted organizations, while in January both the British and Americans presented evidence against individual defendants. Besides the organizations mentioned in the indictment, American, and British prosecutors also mentioned the complicity of the German Foreign Office, army, and navy.

===French prosecution===
From 17 January to 7 February 1946, France presented its charges and supporting evidence. In contrast to the other prosecution teams, the French prosecution delved into Germany&#x27;s development in the nineteenth century, arguing that it had diverged from the West due to pan-Germanism and imperialism. They argued that Nazi ideology, which derived from these earlier ideas, was the &quot;mens rea&quot;—criminal intent—of the crimes on trial. The French prosecutors, more than their British or American counterparts, emphasized the complicity of many Germans; they barely mentioned the charge of aggressive war and instead focused on forced labor, economic plunder, and massacres. Prosecutor Edgar Faure grouped together various German policies, such as the German annexation of Alsace–Lorraine, under the label of Germanization, which he argued was a crime against humanity. Unlike the British and American prosecution strategies, which focused on using German documents to make their cases, the French prosecutors took the perspective of the victims, submitting postwar police reports. Eleven witnesses, including victims of Nazi persecution, were called; resistance fighter and Auschwitz survivor Marie Claude Vaillant-Couturier testified about crimes she had witnessed. The French charges of war crimes were accepted by the tribunal, except for the execution of hostages. Due to the narrow definition of crimes against humanity in the charter, the only part of the Germanization charges accepted by the judges was the deportation of Jews from France and other parts of Western Europe.

===Soviet prosecution===

On 8 February, the Soviet prosecution opened its case with a speech by Rudenko that covered all four prosecution charges, highlighting a wide variety of crimes committed by the German occupiers as part of their destructive and unprovoked invasion. Rudenko tried to emphasize common ground with the other Allies while rejecting any similarity between Nazi and Soviet rule. The next week, the Soviet prosecution produced Friedrich Paulus—a German field marshal captured after the Battle of Stalingrad—as a witness and questioned him about the preparations for the invasion of the Soviet Union. Paulus incriminated his former associates, pointing to Keitel, Jodl, and Göring as the defendants most responsible for the war.

More so than other delegations, Soviet prosecutors showed the gruesome details of German atrocities, especially the death by starvation of 3 million Soviet prisoners of war and several hundred thousand residents of Leningrad. Although Soviet prosecutors dealt most extensively with the systematic murder of Jews in eastern Europe, at times they blurred the fate of Jews with that of other Soviet nationalities. Although these aspects had already been covered by the American prosecution, Soviet prosecutors introduced new evidence from Extraordinary State Commission reports and interrogations of senior enemy officers. Lev Smirnov presented evidence on the Lidice massacre in Czechoslovakia, adding that the German invaders had destroyed thousands of villages and murdered their inhabitants throughout eastern Europe. The Soviet prosecution emphasized the racist aspect of policies such as the deportation of millions of civilians to Germany for forced labor, the murder of children, systematic looting of occupied territories, and theft or destruction of cultural heritage. The Soviet prosecution also attempted to fabricate German responsibility for the Katyn massacre, which had in fact been committed by the NKVD. Although Western prosecutors never publicly rejected the Katyn charge for fear of casting doubt on the entire proceedings, they were skeptical. The defense presented evidence of Soviet responsibility, and Katyn was not mentioned in the verdict.

Inspired by the films shown by the American prosecution, the Soviet Union commissioned three films for the trial: &quot;The German Fascist Destruction of the Cultural Treasures of the Peoples of the USSR&quot;, &quot;Atrocities Committed by the German Fascist Invaders in the USSR&quot;, and &quot;The German Fascist Destruction of Soviet Cities&quot;, using footage from Soviet filmmakers as well as shots from German newsreels. The second film included footage of the liberation of Majdanek and the liberation of Auschwitz and was considered even more disturbing than the American concentration camp film. Soviet witnesses included several survivors of German crimes, including two civilians who lived through the siege of Leningrad, a peasant whose village was destroyed in anti-partisan warfare, a Red Army doctor who endured several prisoner-of-war camps and two Holocaust survivors—Samuel Rajzman, a survivor of Treblinka extermination camp, and poet Abraham Sutzkever, who described the murder of tens of thousands of Jews from Vilna. The Soviet prosecution case was generally well received and presented compelling evidence about the suffering of the Soviet people and the Soviet contributions to victory.

===Defense===

From March to July 1946, the defense presented its counterarguments. Before the prosecution finished, it was clear that their general case was proven, but it remained to determine the individual guilt of each defendant. None of the defendants tried to assert that the Nazis&#x27; crimes had not occurred. Some defendants denied involvement in certain crimes or implausibly claimed ignorance of them, especially the Final Solution. A few defense lawyers inverted the arguments of the prosecution to assert that the Germans&#x27; authoritarian mindset and obedience to the state exonerated them from any personal guilt. Most rejected that Germany had deviated from Western civilization, arguing that few Germans could have supported Hitler because Germany was a civilized country.

The defendants tried to blame their crimes on Hitler, who was mentioned 1,200 times during the trial—more than the top five defendants combined. Other absent and dead men, including Himmler, Reinhard Heydrich, Adolf Eichmann, and Bormann, were also blamed. To counter claims that conservative defendants had enabled the Nazi rise to power, defense lawyers blamed the Social Democratic Party of Germany, trade unions, and other countries that maintained diplomatic relations with Germany. In contrast, most defendants avoided incriminating each other. Most defendants argued their own insignificance within the Nazi system, but Göring took the opposite approach, expecting to be executed but vindicated in the eyes of the German people.

The charter did not recognize a &quot;tu quoque&quot; defense—asking for exoneration on the grounds that the Allies had committed the same crimes with which the defendants were charged. Although defense lawyers repeatedly equated the Nuremberg Laws to legislation found in other countries, Nazi concentration camps to Allied detention facilities, and the deportation of Jews to the expulsion of Germans, the judges rejected their arguments. repeatedly tried to disclose the secret protocols of the German–Soviet pact; although he was eventually successful, it was legally irrelevant and the judges rejected his attempt to bring up the Treaty of Versailles. Six defendants were charged with the German invasion of Norway, and their lawyers argued that this invasion was undertaken to prevent a British invasion of that country; a cover-up prevented the defense from capitalizing on this argument. Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz testified that the United States Navy had also used unrestricted submarine warfare against Japan in the Pacific; Dönitz&#x27;s counsel successfully argued that this meant that it could not be a crime. The judges barred most evidence on Allied misdeeds from being heard in court.

Many defense lawyers complained about various aspects of the trial procedure and attempted to discredit the entire proceedings. In order to appease them, the defendants were allowed a free hand with their witnesses and a great deal of irrelevant testimony was heard. The defendants&#x27; witnesses sometimes managed to exculpate them, but other witnesses—including Rudolf Höss, the former commandant of Auschwitz, and Hans Bernd Gisevius, a member of the German resistance—bolstered the prosecution&#x27;s case. Over the course of the trial, Western judges allowed the defendants additional leeway to denounce the Soviet Union, which was ultimately revealed to be a co-conspirator in the outbreak of World War II. In the context of the brewing Cold War—for example, in 1946 Winston Churchill delivered the Iron Curtain speech—the trial became a means of condemning not only Germany but also the Soviet Union.

===Closing===
On 31 August, closing arguments were presented. Over the course of the trial, crimes against humanity and especially against Jews (who were mentioned as victims of Nazi atrocities far more than any other group) came to upstage the aggressive war charge. In contrast to the opening prosecution statements, all eight closing statements highlighted the Holocaust; and the French and British prosecutors made this the main charge, as opposed to that of aggression. All prosecutors except the Americans mentioned the concept of genocide, which had been recently invented by the Polish-Jewish jurist Raphael Lemkin. British prosecutor Shawcross quoted from witness testimony about a murdered Jewish family from Dubno, Ukraine. During the closing statements, most defendants disappointed the judges by their lies and denial. Speer managed to give the impression of apologizing without assuming personal guilt or naming any victims other than the German people. On 2 September, the court recessed; and the judges retreated into seclusion to decide the verdict and sentences, which had been under discussion since June. The verdict was drafted by British deputy judge Norman Birkett. All eight judges participated in the deliberations, but the deputies could not cast a vote.

==Verdict==
The International Military Tribunal agreed with the prosecution that aggression was the gravest charge against the accused, stating in its judgment that because &quot;war is essentially an evil thing&quot;, &quot;to initiate a war of aggression, therefore, is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole&quot;. The work of the judges was made more difficult due to the broadness of the crimes listed in the Nuremberg Charter. The judges did not attempt to define the crime of aggression and did not mention the retroactivity of the charges in the verdict. Despite the lingering doubts of some of the judges, the official interpretation of the IMT held that all of the charges had a solid basis in customary international law and that the trial was procedurally fair. The judges were aware that both the Allies and the Axis had planned or committed acts of aggression, writing the verdict carefully to avoid discrediting either the Allied governments or the tribunal.

The judges ruled that there had been a premeditated conspiracy to commit crimes against peace, whose goals were &quot;the disruption of the European order&quot; and &quot;the creation of a Greater Germany beyond the frontiers of 1914&quot;. Contrary to Jackson&#x27;s argument that the conspiracy began with the founding of the Nazi Party in 1920, the verdict dated the planning of aggression to the 1937 Hossbach Memorandum. The conspiracy charge caused significant dissent on the bench; Donnedieu de Vabres wanted to scrap it. Through a compromise proposed by the British judges, the charge of conspiracy was narrowed to a conspiracy to wage aggressive war. Only eight defendants were convicted on that charge; all of whom were also found guilty of crimes against peace. All 22 defendants were charged with crimes against peace, and 12 were convicted. The war crimes and crimes against humanity charges held up the best, with only two defendants charged on those grounds being acquitted. The judges determined that crimes against humanity concerning German Jews before 1939 were not under the court&#x27;s jurisdiction because the prosecution had not proven a connection to aggressive war.

Four organizations were ruled to be criminal: the Leadership Corps of the Nazi Party, the SS, the Gestapo, and the SD, although some lower ranks and subgroups were excluded. The verdict only allowed for individual criminal responsibility if willing membership and knowledge of the criminal purpose could be proved, complicating denazification efforts. The SA, the Reich Cabinet, and the General Staff and High Command were not ruled to be criminal organizations. Although the Wehrmacht leadership was not considered an organization within the meaning of the charter, misrepresentation of the verdict as an exoneration was one of the foundations of the clean Wehrmacht myth. The trial had nevertheless resulted in the coverage of its systematic criminality in the German press.

Sentences were debated at length by the judges. Twelve of the defendants were sentenced to death (Göring, Ribbentrop, Keitel, Kaltenbrunner, Rosenberg, Frank, Frick, Streicher, Sauckel, Jodl, Seyss-Inquart, and Bormann). On 16 October, ten were hanged, with Göring killing himself the day before. Seven defendants (Hess, Funk, Raeder, Dönitz, Schirach, Speer, and Neurath) were sent to Spandau Prison to serve their sentences. All three acquittals (Papen, Schacht, and Fritzsche) were based on a deadlock between the judges; these acquittals surprised observers. Despite being accused of the same crimes, Sauckel was sentenced to death, while Speer was given a prison sentence because the judges considered that he could reform. Nikichenko released a dissent approved by Moscow that rejected all the acquittals, called for a death sentence for Hess, and convicted all the organizations.

==Subsequent Nuremberg trials==


Initially, it was planned to hold a second international tribunal for German industrialists, but this was never held because of differences between the Allies. Twelve military trials were convened solely by the United States in the same courtroom that had hosted the International Military Tribunal. Pursuant to Law No. 10 adopted by the Allied Control Council, United States forces arrested almost 100,000 Germans as war criminals. The Office of Chief Counsel for War Crimes identified 2,500 major war criminals, of whom 177 were tried. Many of the worst offenders were not prosecuted, for logistical or financial reasons.

One set of trials focused on the actions of German professionals: the Doctors&#x27; trial focused on human experimentation and euthanasia murders, the Judges&#x27; trial on the role of the judiciary in Nazi crimes, and the Ministries trial on the culpability of bureaucrats of German government ministries, especially the Foreign Office. Also on trial were industrialists—in the Flick trial, the IG Farben trial, and the Krupp trial—for using forced labor, looting property from Nazi victims, and funding SS atrocities. Members of the SS were tried in the Pohl trial, which focused on members of the SS Main Economic and Administrative Office that oversaw SS economic activity, including the Nazi concentration camps; the RuSHA trial of Nazi racial policies; and the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; trial, in which members of the mobile killing squads were tried for the murder of more than one million people behind the Eastern Front. Luftwaffe general Erhard Milch was tried for using slave labor and deporting civilians. In the Hostages case, several generals were tried for executing thousands of hostages and prisoners of war, looting, using forced labor, and deporting civilians in the Balkans. Other generals were tried in the High Command Trial for plotting wars of aggression, issuing criminal orders, deporting civilians, using slave labor, and looting in the Soviet Union.

These trials emphasized the crimes committed during the Holocaust. The trials heard 1,300 witnesses, entered more than 30,000 documents into evidence, and generated 132,855 pages of transcripts, with the judgments totaling 3,828 pages. Of 177 defendants, 142 were convicted and 25 sentenced to death; the severity of sentencing was related to the defendant&#x27;s proximity to mass murder. Legal historian Kevin Jon Heller argues that the trials&#x27; greatest achievement was &quot;their inestimable contribution to the form and substance of international criminal law&quot;, which had been left underdeveloped by the IMT.

==Contemporary reactions==

In all, 249 journalists were accredited to cover the IMT and 61,854 visitor tickets were issued. In France, the sentence for Rudolf Hess and acquittal of organizations were met with outrage from the media and especially from organizations for deportees and resistance fighters, as they were perceived as too lenient. In the United Kingdom, although a variety of responses were reported, it was difficult to sustain interest in a long trial. Where the prosecution was disappointed by some of the verdicts, the defense could take satisfaction.

Many Germans at the time of the trials focused on finding food and shelter. Despite this, a majority read press reports about the trial. In a 1946 poll, 78 percent of Germans assessed the trial as fair, but four years later that had fallen to 38 percent, with 30 percent considering it unfair. As time went on, more Germans considered the trials illegitimate victor&#x27;s justice and an imposition of collective guilt, which they rejected—instead considering themselves victims of the war. As the Cold War began, the rapidly changing political environment began to affect the effectiveness of the trials. The educational purpose of the Nuremberg Military Tribunals was a failure, in part because of the resistance to war crimes trials in German society, but also because of the United States Army&#x27;s refusal to publish the trial record in German for fear it would undermine the fight against communism.

The German churches, both Catholic and Protestant, were vocal proponents of amnesty. The pardon of convicted war criminals also had cross-party support in West Germany, which was established in 1949. The Americans satisfied these wishes to bind West Germany to the Western Bloc, beginning early releases of Nuremberg Military Tribunal convicts in 1949. In 1951, High Commissioner John J. McCloy overturned most of the sentences and the last three prisoners, all convicted at the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; trial, were released in 1958. The German public took the early releases as confirmation of what they saw as the illegitimacy of the trials. The IMT defendants required Soviet permission for release; Speer was not successful in obtaining early release, and Hess remained in prison until his death in 1987. By the late 1950s, the West German consensus on release began to erode, due to greater openness in political culture and new revelations of Nazi criminality, including the first trials of Nazi perpetrators in West German courts.

==Legacy==

The International Military Tribunal, and its charter, &quot;marked the true beginning of international criminal law&quot;. The trial has met a mixed reception ranging from glorification to condemnation. The reaction was initially predominantly negative, but has become more positive over time.

The selective prosecution exclusively of the defeated Axis and hypocrisy of all four Allied powers has garnered the most persistent criticism. Such actions as the German–Soviet pact, the expulsion of millions of Germans from central and eastern Europe, deportation of civilians for forced labor, and violent suppression of anti-colonial uprisings would have been deemed illegal according to the definitions of international crimes in the Nuremberg charter. Another controversy resulted from trying defendants for acts that were not criminal at the time, particularly crimes against peace. Equally novel but less controversial were crimes against humanity, the conspiracy charge, and criminal penalties on individuals for breaches of international law. Besides these criticisms, the trials have been taken to task for the distortion that comes from fitting historical events into legal categories.

The International Military Tribunal for the Far East (Tokyo Trial) borrowed many of its ideas from the IMT, including all four charges, and was intended by the Truman Administration to shore up the IMT&#x27;s legal legacy. On 11 December 1946, the United Nations General Assembly unanimously passed a resolution affirming &quot;the principles of international law recognized by the Charter of the Nuremberg Tribunal and the judgment of the Tribunal&quot;. In 1950, the International Law Commission drafted the Nuremberg principles to codify international criminal law, although the Cold War prevented the adoption of these principles until the 1990s. The 1948 Genocide Convention was much more restricted than Lemkin&#x27;s original concept and its effectiveness was further limited by Cold War politics. In the 1990s, a revival of international criminal law included the establishment of &quot;ad hoc&quot; international criminal tribunals for Yugoslavia (ICTY) and Rwanda (ICTR), which were widely viewed as part of the legacy of the Nuremberg and Tokyo trials. A permanent International Criminal Court (ICC), proposed in 1953, was established in 2002.

The trials were the first use of simultaneous interpretation, which stimulated technical advances in translation methods. The Palace of Justice houses a museum on the trial and the courtroom became a tourist attraction, drawing 13,138 visitors in 2005. The IMT is one of the most well-studied trials in history, and it has also been the subject of an abundance of books and scholarly publications, along with motion pictures such as &quot;Judgment at Nuremberg&quot; (1961) and &quot;The Memory of Justice&quot; (1976).

<text>Natasha Jessica Stott Despoja AO (born 9 September 1969) is an Australian diplomat and former politician. Starting her career in student politics, she became an advisor to the Australian Democrats and was appointed to the Australian Senate in 1995 at the age of 26. At the time, she was the youngest woman to serve in federal Parliament. She went on to become deputy leader of the Democrats in 1997 and then federal leader from 2001 to 2002. She retired from the Senate in 2008 as the longest-serving senator from her party.

She has remained active in the public sphere, working with government and non-profit organisations. She was appointed Officer of the Order of Australia in 2019 for her work on gender equality. Stott Despoja was the founding chair of Our Watch, a national foundation to prevent violence against women and children, and served as national Ambassador for Women and Girls from 2013 to 2016. She was also a member of the World Bank Gender Advisory Council from 2015 to 2017. She has served in positions at the United Nations, including on the High Level Working Group on the Health and Human Rights of Women, Children, and Adolescents in 2017, and as a member of the Committee on Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) since 2020. She has published several books and writes regularly on current topics.

==Early life and education==
Stott Despoja was born in Adelaide on 9 September 1969. She is the daughter of Shirley Stott Despoja, an Australian-born journalist and Mario Despoja, who was from Croatia (then part of Yugoslavia). She attended Stradbroke Primary and Pembroke School and later graduated from the University of Adelaide in 1991. She was President of the Students&#x27; Association of the University of Adelaide (SAUA) and the South Australian Women&#x27;s Officer for the National Union of Students. She then went on to work as a political advisor to Senator John Coulter and Senator Cheryl Kernot.

==Political career==
When Democrats Senator John Coulter resigned for health reasons in 1995, Stott Despoja was the successful candidate to fill the resulting vacancy. Her rise to prominence began when she won a full term in the 1996 election the following year, becoming the youngest woman ever elected to the federal Parliament at age 26. Late the following year, following the resignation of Cheryl Kernot and the rise of Meg Lees to the leadership of the Democrats, Stott Despoja was elected deputy leader of the Democrats. During this time, she built her image as spokesperson for Employment, Higher Education, Youth, Science and Information Technology, Consumer Affairs, Trade, and the Republic.

During the passage of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) legislation in 1999, Stott Despoja and Andrew Bartlett split with the party&#x27;s other senators by opposing the package, which had been negotiated by Lees and prime minister John Howard. She said that she refused to break promises made during the election. The party had stated that they would work with whichever party formed government to improve their tax package. The Australian Democrats traditionally permitted parliamentary representatives to cast a conscience vote on any issue but, on this occasion, close numbers in the Senate placed greater pressure than usual on the dissenters.

===Leader of the Democrats===
The passage of the GST was not popular among the Democrats membership. Unlike other parties, the members directly elected the party leader and a spill could be called at any time with 100 signatures. Meg Lees had been subject to such a challenge before but was re-elected unopposed as no other senator opted to run. By early 2001, the party&#x27;s fortunes were declining. The state election in Western Australia in February, where the Democrats lost both their seats in the upper house, was particularly damaging and prompted another spill campaign against Lees. Stott Despoja, who by this time was widely recognised and popular among voters, decided to run and was successful, winning 69% of votes.

Stott Despoja became the leader of her party on 6 April 2001. From the beginning she faced difficulties in working with Lees, who viewed her run for the leadership as a betrayal. Other senators, including new deputy leader Aden Ridgeway, remained sympathetic to Lees. In the 2001 federal election in November, the Democrats recorded a fall in their Senate vote from 8.5% to 7.3% and returned four of the five senators up for election. The party also saw a marginal lift in its primary vote for the lower house from 5.1% to 5.4%. The substantial rise of the Greens vote to 4.9% in the Senate and their election of a second senator ignited further discussion about the fortunes of the Democrats.

Throughout 2002, Stott Despoja struggled to keep the party together as senators publicly strayed from party positions and privately expressed a lack of confidence in her leadership. After the party bureaucracy opened an investigation into Meg Lees for allegedly damaging party unity, which Lees and her allies saw as part of a campaign by Stott Despoja to silence her, Lees left the party in July 2002. This was followed by a stand-off with Andrew Murray, who threatened to follow. After deciding to stay, Murray proposed a ten-point package to reform party structures and address the issues raised by Lees, designed to shift power from the leader. At a party room meeting on 21 August, all ten measures were passed four votes to three: Murray, Ridgeway, Lyn Allison and John Cherry in favour, with Stott Despoja and her allies Andrew Bartlett and Brian Greig against. Understanding her position to be untenable after this defeat, Stott Despoja announced her resignation to the Senate. She had been leader for 16 and a half months.

===Post-leadership===
Stott Despoja remained active in the Senate and the Democrats after resigning as leader. The party&#x27;s fortunes continued to decline under new leader Andrew Bartlett. In the 2004 election they failed to elect any senators, leaving only the four elected in 2001: Stott Despoja, Bartlett, Lyn Allison, and Andrew Murray.

In 2004, Stott Despoja took 11 weeks&#x27; leave from the Senate following the birth of her first child. She returned to full duties as spokesperson for Higher Education, Science and Biotechnology, Women, Privacy, Territories and Local Government, and Work and Family.

During her career, Stott Despoja introduced 24 private member&#x27;s bills on issues including paid maternity leave, the Republic, genetic privacy, stem cells, captioning, and same-sex marriage. Stott Despoja regularly attends the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras.

On 22 October 2006, after undergoing emergency surgery for an ectopic pregnancy, she announced that she would not contest the 2007 election and would leave office at the expiration of her term on 30 June 2008. She was the Australian Democrats&#x27; longest-serving senator. As in 2004, the Democrats elected no senators in 2007, and Stott Despoja&#x27;s retirement coincided with the end of her party&#x27;s federal parliamentary representation.

==Post-political career==
Stott Despoja has been a casual host on ABC Radio Adelaide, a guest panellist on Channel 10&#x27;s &quot;The Project&quot; and a columnist for the Australian business news website &quot;Business Spectator&quot;. She has also been a columnist for &quot;The Advertiser&quot; and an honorary visiting research fellow at the University of Adelaide.

She was on the board of the Burnet Institute (Australia&#x27;s largest virology and communicable disease research institute) from 2008 until December 2013. On 21 July 2015, Stott Despoja returned to the Burnet Institute as a patron. She was no longer a patron by May 2023.

In 2010, she taught a course at winter school at the University of Adelaide with former foreign minister Alexander Downer, called &quot;The Practice of Australian Politics&quot;.

She was a board member of non-profit organisations the South Australian Museum from 2009 to 2013; the Museum of Australian Democracy from 2010 to 2013; and the Advertising Standards Board from 2008 to 2013. She was a deputy chair at beyondblue, Australia&#x27;s national depression initiative.

She has been an ambassador for Ovarian Cancer Australia, The Orangutan Project; Cancer Australia; secondbite; and the HIV/AIDS anti-stigma campaign, ENUF, (along with her husband Ian Smith).

In July 2013, Stott Despoja was the founding chair of Our Watch, originally named Foundation to Prevent Violence Against Women and their Children. She left the position in July 2021, and was appointed life patron in August 2022. Our Watch is a joint initiative of the Victorian and Commonwealth Governments, based in Melbourne. It is an independent non-profit organisation that is now jointly funded by all states and territories of Australia, after the New South Wales Government was the last state government to join the organisation in 2019.

Foreign minister Julie Bishop announced the appointment of Stott Despoja as Australia&#x27;s new Ambassador for Women and Girls in December 2013, a role she held until 2016. This involved visiting some 45 countries to promote women&#x27;s economic empowerment and leadership and to help reduce violence against women and girls.

Stott Despoja has also been an election observer for the US-based National Democratic Institute in Nigeria (2011); visited Burkina Faso for Oxfam (2012); and went to Laos (2011) and Burma (2013) with The Burnet Institute. She was mentioned in June 2014 as a possible replacement for Kevin Scarce as the next Governor of South Australia, however Hieu Van Le was chosen.

In April 2019 Stott Despoja was on the advisory board of the Australian Privacy Foundation. and the Global Women&#x27;s Institute Leadership Council.

In November 2020, she was elected to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, becoming the first Australian member in 28 years.

In 2022, she delivered the Hugh Stretton Oration at the University of Adelaide.

In March 2024 Stott Despoja was appointed as South Australia&#x27;s Royal Commissioner into Domestic, Family and Sexual Violence, after the Royal Commission into Domestic, Family and Sexual Violence had been announced by Premier Peter Malinauskas in December 2023. On 1 July 2024, she began her role as royal commissioner. which

==Writing==

Stott Despoja has authored a large number of essays, reports and non-fiction works on a range of topics, both during and since her political career.

In March 2019 she published &quot;On Violence&quot;, with the publisher&#x27;s blurb asking &quot;Why is violence against women endemic, and how do we stop it?&quot;. Stott Despoja posits that violence against women is &quot;Australia&#x27;s national emergency&quot;, with one woman dying at the hands of her partner or someone she knows every week. This violence is preventable, and that we need to &quot;create a new normal&quot;.

==Honours and accolades==

In 1999, she was appointed a Global Leader for Tomorrow by the World Economic Forum (WEF).

Despoja was awarded a Member of the Order of Australia in June 2011 for her &quot;service to the Parliament of Australia, particularly as a Senator for South Australia, through leadership roles with the Australian Democrats, to education, and as a role model for women&quot;.

She is listed as one of the &quot;Gender Equality Top 100&quot; by the UK organisation Apolitical.

In June 2019 Despoja was appointed as an Officer of the Order of Australia for her &quot;distinguished service to the global community as an advocate for gender equality, and through roles in a range of organisations&quot;.

<doc id="21881" wikidata="Q697474" url="?curid=21881" title="Nuremberg Code">
<text>The Nuremberg Code () is a set of ethical research principles for human experimentation created by the court in &quot;U.S. v Brandt&quot;, one of the Subsequent Nuremberg trials that were held after the Second World War.

Though it was articulated as part of the court&#x27;s verdict in the trial, the Code would later become significant beyond its original context; in a review written on the 50th anniversary of the &quot;Brandt&quot; verdict, Jay Katz writes that &quot;a careful reading of the judgment suggests that [the authors] wrote the Code for the practice of human experimentation whenever it is being conducted.&quot;

==Background==
The origin of the Code began in pre–World War II German politics, particularly during the 1930s and 1940s. Starting in the mid-1920s, German physicians, usually proponents of racial hygiene, were accused by the public and the medical society of unethical medical practices. The use of racial hygiene was supported by the German government in order to promote an Aryan race. Racial hygiene extremists merged with National Socialism to promote the use of biology to accomplish their goals of racial purity, a core concept in the Nationalist ideology. Physicians were attracted to the scientific ideology and aided in the establishment of the National Socialist Physicians&#x27; League in 1929 to &quot;purify the German medical community of &#x27;Jewish Bolshevism&#x27;.&quot; Criticism was becoming prevalent; Alfons Stauder, member of the Reich Health Office, claimed that the &quot;dubious experiments have no therapeutic purpose&quot;, and Fredrich von Muller, physician and the president of the Deutsche Akademie, joined the criticism.

In response to the criticism of unethical human experimentation, the Weimar Republic (Germany&#x27;s government from 1919 to 1933) issued &quot;Guidelines for New Therapy and Human Experimentation&quot;. The guidelines were based on beneficence and non-maleficence, but also stressed the legal doctrine of informed consent. The guidelines clearly distinguished the difference between therapeutic and non-therapeutic research. For therapeutic purposes, the guidelines allowed administration without consent only in dire situations, but for non-therapeutic purposes any administration without consent was strictly forbidden. However, the guidelines from Weimar were negated by Adolf Hitler. By 1942, the Nazi party included more than 38,000 German physicians, who helped carry out medical programs such as the Sterilization Law.

After World War II, a series of trials were held to hold members of the Nazi party responsible for a multitude of war crimes. The trials were approved by President Harry Truman on 2 May 1945, and were led by the United States, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union. They began on 20 November 1945, in Nuremberg, Germany, in what became known as the Nuremberg trials. In the trial of &quot;USA v. Brandt,&quot; which became known as the &quot;Doctors&#x27; Trial&quot;, German physicians responsible for conducting unethical medical procedures on humans during the war were tried. They focused on physicians who conducted inhumane and unethical human experiments in concentration camps, in addition to those who were involved in over 3.5 million sterilizations of German citizens.

Several of the accused argued that their experiments differed little from those used before the war, and that there was no law that differentiated between legal and illegal experiments. This worried Andrew Ivy and Leo Alexander, who worked with the prosecution during the trial. In April 1947, Alexander submitted a memorandum to the United States Counsel for War Crimes outlining six points for legitimate medical research.

An early version of the Code known as the Memorandum, which stated explicit voluntary consent from patients is required for human experimentation, was drafted on 9 August 1947. On 20 August 1947, the judges delivered their verdict against Karl Brandt and 22 others. The verdict reiterated the Memorandum&#x27;s points and, in response to expert medical advisers for the prosecution, revised the original six points of the Memorandum to ten points. The ten points became known as the Code, which includes such principles as informed consent and absence of coercion; properly formulated scientific experimentation; and beneficence towards experiment participants. It is thought to have been mainly based on the Hippocratic Oath, which was interpreted as endorsing the experimental approach to medicine while protecting the patient.
===Authorship &#x27;controversy&#x27;===
The Code was initially ignored, but gained much greater significance about 20 years after it was written. As a result, there were substantial rival claims for the creation of the Code. Some claimed that Harold Sebring, one of the three U.S. judges who presided over the Doctors&#x27; trial, was the author. Leo Alexander, MD and Andrew Ivy, MD, the prosecution&#x27;s chief medical expert witnesses, were also each identified as authors. In his letter to Maurice Henry Pappworth, an English physician and the author of the 1967 book &quot;Human Guinea Pigs&quot;, Andrew Ivy claimed sole authorship of the code. Leo Alexander, approximately 30 years after the trial, also claimed sole authorship. However, after careful reading of the transcript of the Doctors&#x27; trial, background documents, and the final judgements, it is more accepted that the authorship was shared and the code grew out of the trial itself.

==The ten points of the Nuremberg Code==

The ten points of the code were given in the section of the judges&#x27; verdict entitled &quot;Permissible Medical Experiments&quot;:

==Importance==

The Code has not been officially accepted as law by any nation or as official ethics guidelines by any association. In fact, the Code&#x27;s reference to Hippocratic duty to the individual patient and the need to provide information was not initially favored by the American Medical Association. Katz observes that the Western world initially dismissed the Nuremberg Code as a &quot;code for barbarians, but unnecessary (or superfluous) for ordinary physicians.&quot; Additionally, the final judgment did not specify whether the Code should be applied to cases such as political prisoners, convicted felons, and healthy volunteers. The lack of clarity, the brutality of the unethical medical experiments, and the uncompromising language of the Code created an image that it was designed for singularly egregious transgressions.

However, the Code is considered by some to be the most important document in the history of clinical research ethics, because of its massive influence on global human rights. In the United States, the Code and the related Declaration of Helsinki influenced the drafting of regulations promulgated by the United States Department of Health and Human Services to ensure ethical treatment of human research subjects, known as the Common Rule, which is now codified in Part 46 of Title 45 of the Code of Federal Regulations. These regulations are enforced by Institutional Review Boards (IRBs). In 1966, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was adopted by the United Nations, and after enough nations had ratified the Covenant, it came into force on 23 March 1976. Article Seven prohibits experiments conducted without the &quot;free consent to medical or scientific experimentation&quot; of the subject. As of September 2019, the Covenant has 173 states parties.

In his 2014 review, Gaw observes that the Code &quot;not only entered the legal landscape, but also became the prototype for all future codes of ethical practice across the globe.&quot; The idea of free or informed consent also served as the basis for International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects proposed by the World Health Organization. Another notable symposium review was published by the Medical University of Vienna in 2017: &quot;Medical Ethics in the 70 Years after the Nuremberg Code, 1947 to the Present&quot;. President and Rector Markus Muller writes in his introduction that the Code &quot;constitutes one of the most important milestones in the history of medicine, providing for the first time a proper framework for research on human subjects. This milestone was not a voluntary, precautionary measure, but only came into existence in the aftermath of Nazi atrocities. The Nuremberg Code became a cornerstone of clinical research and bioethics.&quot;

In 1995, Judge Sandra Beckwith ruled in the case &quot;In Re Cincinnati Radiation Litigation&quot; (874 F. Supp 1995) that the Nuremberg Code may be applied in criminal and civil litigation in the Federal Courts of the United States.

<doc id="21885" wikidata="Q724409" url="?curid=21885" title="Nim">
<text>Nim is a mathematical combinatorial game in which two players take turns removing (or &quot;nimming&quot;) objects from distinct heaps or piles. On each turn, a player must remove at least one object, and may remove any number of objects provided they all come from the same heap or pile. Depending on the version being played, the goal of the game is either to avoid taking the last object or to take the last object.

Nim is fundamental to the Sprague–Grundy theorem, which essentially says that every impartial game is equivalent to a nim game with a single pile.

==History==
Variants of nim have been played since ancient times. The game is said to have originated in China—it closely resembles the Chinese game of (), or &quot;picking stones&quot;—but the origin is uncertain; the earliest European references to nim are from the beginning of the 16th century. Its current name was coined by Charles L. Bouton of Harvard University, who also developed the complete theory of the game in 1901, but the origins of the name were never fully explained. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; derives the name from the German verb , meaning &quot;take&quot;.

At the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair Westinghouse displayed a machine, the Nimatron, that played nim. From May 11 to October 27, 1940, only a few people were able to beat the machine in that six-month period; if they did, they were presented with a coin that said &quot;Nim Champ&quot;. It was also one of the first-ever electronic computerized games. Ferranti built a nim-playing computer which was displayed at the Festival of Britain in 1951. In 1952, Herbert Koppel, Eugene Grant and Howard Bailer, engineers from the W. L. Maxson Corporation, developed a machine weighing which played nim against a human opponent and regularly won. A nim playing machine has been described made from tinkertoys.

The game of nim was the subject of Martin Gardner&#x27;s February 1958 Mathematical Games column in &quot;Scientific American&quot;. A version of nim is played—and has symbolic importance—in the French New Wave film &quot;Last Year at Marienbad&quot; (1961).

== Game play and illustration ==
Nim is typically played as a misère game, in which the player to take the last object loses. Nim can also be played as a &quot;normal play&quot; game whereby the player taking the last object wins. In either normal play or a misère game, when there is exactly one heap with at least two objects, the player who takes next can easily win. If this removes either all or all but one objects from the heap that has two or more, then no heaps will have more than one object, so the players are forced to alternate removing exactly one object until the game ends. If the player leaves an even number of non-zero heaps (as the player would do in normal play), the player takes last; if the player leaves an odd number of heaps (as the player would do in misère play), then the other player takes last.

The normal game is between two players and is played with three heaps of any number of objects. The two players alternate taking any number of objects from any one of the heaps. The goal is to be the last to take an object. In misère play, the goal is instead to ensure that the opponent is forced to take the last remaining object.

The following example of a normal game is played between fictional players Bob and Alice, who start with heaps of three, four and five objects.

The practical strategy to win at the game of nim is for a player to get the other into one of the following positions, and every successive turn afterwards they should be able to make one of the smaller positions. Only the last move changes between misère and normal play.

For the generalisations, &quot;n&quot; and &quot;m&quot; can be any value &gt; 0, and they may be the same.

== Mathematical theory ==
Normal-play nim (or more precisely the system of nimbers) is fundamental to the Sprague–Grundy theorem, which essentially says that in normal play every impartial game is equivalent to a nim heap that yields the same outcome when played in parallel with other normal play impartial games (see disjunctive sum).

While all normal-play impartial games can be assigned a nim value, that is not the case under the misère convention. Only tame games can be played using the same strategy as misère nim.

Nim is a special case of a poset game where the poset consists of disjoint chains (the heaps).

The evolution graph of the game of nim with three heaps is the same as three branches of the evolution graph of the Ulam–Warburton automaton.

Nim has been mathematically solved for any number of initial heaps and objects, and there is an easily calculated way to determine which player will win and which winning moves are open to that player.

The key to the theory of the game is the binary digital sum of the heap sizes, i.e., the sum (in binary), neglecting all carries from one digit to another. This operation is also known as &quot;bitwise xor&quot; or &quot;vector addition over GF(2)&quot; (bitwise addition modulo 2). Within combinatorial game theory it is usually called the nim-sum, as it will be called here. The nim-sum of &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; is written to distinguish it from the ordinary sum, . An example of the calculation with heaps of size 3, 4, and 5 is as follows:

 Binary Decimal
 0112 310 Heap A
 1002 410 Heap B
 1012 510 Heap C
 0102 210 The nim-sum of heaps A, B, and C, 3 ⊕ 4 ⊕ 5 = 2

An equivalent procedure, which is often easier to perform mentally, is to express the heap sizes as sums of distinct powers of 2, cancel pairs of equal powers, and then add what is left:

 3 = 0 + 2 + 1 = 2 1 Heap A
 4 = 4 + 0 + 0 = 4 Heap B
 5 = 4 + 0 + 1 = 4 1 Heap C
 2 = 2 What is left after canceling 1s and 4s

In normal play, the winning strategy is to finish every move with a nim-sum of 0. This is always possible if the nim-sum is not zero before the move. If the nim-sum is zero, then the next player will lose if the other player does not make a mistake. To find out which move to make, let X be the nim-sum of all the heap sizes. Find a heap where the nim-sum of X and heap-size is less than the heap-size; the winning strategy is to play in such a heap, reducing that heap to the nim-sum of its original size with X. In the example above, taking the nim-sum of the sizes is . The nim-sums of the heap sizes A=3, B=4, and C=5 with X=2 are
: &quot;A&quot; ⊕ &quot;X&quot; = 3 ⊕ 2 = 1 [Since (011) ⊕ (010) = 001 ]
: &quot;B&quot; ⊕ &quot;X&quot; = 4 ⊕ 2 = 6
: &quot;C&quot; ⊕ &quot;X&quot; = 5 ⊕ 2 = 7
The only heap that is reduced is heap A, so the winning move is to reduce the size of heap A to 1 (by removing two objects).

As a particular simple case, if there are only two heaps left, the strategy is to reduce the number of objects in the bigger heap to make the heaps equal. After that, no matter what move the opponent makes, the player can make the same move on the other heap, guaranteeing that they take the last object.

When played as a misère game, nim strategy is different only when the normal play move would leave only heaps of size one. In that case, the correct move is to leave an odd number of heaps of size one (in normal play, the correct move would be to leave an even number of such heaps).

These strategies for normal play and a misère game are the same until the number of heaps with at least two objects is exactly equal to one. At that point, the next player removes either all objects (or all but one) from the heap that has two or more, so no heaps will have more than one object (in other words, so all remaining heaps have exactly one object each), so the players are forced to alternate removing exactly one object until the game ends. In normal play, the player leaves an even number of non-zero heaps, so the same player takes last; in misère play, the player leaves an odd number of non-zero heaps, so the other player takes last.

In a misère game with heaps of sizes three, four and five, the strategy would be applied like this:

== Proof of the winning formula ==

The soundness of the optimal strategy described above was demonstrated by C. Bouton.

Theorem. In a normal nim game, the player making the first move has a winning strategy if and only if the nim-sum of the sizes of the heaps is not zero. Otherwise, the second player has a winning strategy.

&quot;Proof:&quot; Notice that the nim-sum (⊕) obeys the usual associative and commutative laws of addition (+) and also satisfies an additional property, &quot;x&quot; ⊕ &quot;x&quot; = 0.

Let be the sizes of the heaps before a move, and &quot;y&quot;1, ..., &quot;yn&quot; the corresponding sizes after a move. Let &quot;s&quot; = &quot;x&quot;1 ⊕ ... ⊕ &quot;xn&quot; and &quot;t&quot; = &quot;y&quot;1 ⊕ ... ⊕ &quot;yn&quot;. If the move was in heap &quot;k&quot;, we have &quot;xi&quot; = &quot;yi&quot; for all , and &quot;xk&quot; &gt; &quot;yk&quot;. By the properties of ⊕ mentioned above, we have

formula_1

The theorem follows by induction on the length of the game from these two lemmas.

Lemma 1. If &quot;s&quot; = 0, then &quot;t&quot; ≠ 0 no matter what move is made.

&quot;Proof:&quot; If there is no possible move, then the lemma is vacuously true (and the first player loses the normal play game by definition). Otherwise, any move in heap &quot;k&quot; will produce &quot;t&quot; = &quot;xk&quot; ⊕ &quot;yk&quot; from (*). This number is nonzero, since &quot;xk&quot; ≠ &quot;yk&quot;.

Lemma 2. If &quot;s&quot; ≠ 0, it is possible to make a move so that &quot;t&quot; = 0.

&quot;Proof:&quot; Let &quot;d&quot; be the position of the leftmost (most significant) nonzero bit in the binary representation of &quot;s&quot;, and choose &quot;k&quot; such that the &quot;d&quot;th bit of &quot;xk&quot; is also nonzero. (Such a &quot;k&quot; must exist, since otherwise the &quot;d&quot;th bit of &quot;s&quot; would be 0.)
Then letting &quot;yk&quot; = &quot;s&quot; ⊕ &quot;xk&quot;, we claim that &quot;yk&quot; &lt; &quot;xk&quot;: all bits to the left of &quot;d&quot; are the same in &quot;xk&quot; and &quot;yk&quot;, bit &quot;d&quot; decreases from 1 to 0 (decreasing the value by 2&quot;d&quot;), and any change in the remaining bits will amount to at most 2&quot;d&quot;−1. The first player can thus make a move by taking &quot;xk&quot; − &quot;yk&quot; objects from heap &quot;k&quot;, then
 &quot;t&quot; = &quot;s&quot; ⊕ &quot;xk&quot; ⊕ &quot;yk&quot; (by (*))
 = &quot;s&quot; ⊕ &quot;xk&quot; ⊕ (&quot;s&quot; ⊕ &quot;xk&quot;)
 = 0.

The modification for misère play is demonstrated by noting that the modification first arises in a position that has only one heap of size 2 or more. Notice that in such a position &quot;s&quot; ≠ 0, and therefore this situation has to arise when it is the turn of the player following the winning strategy. The normal play strategy is for the player to reduce this to size 0 or 1, leaving an even number of heaps with size 1, and the misère strategy is to do the opposite. From that point on, all moves are forced.

== Variations ==

=== The subtraction game ===

In another game which is commonly known as nim (but is better called the subtraction game), an upper bound is imposed on the number of objects that can be removed in a turn. Instead of removing arbitrarily many objects, a player can only remove 1 or 2 or ... or &quot;k&quot; at a time. This game is commonly played in practice with only one heap.

Bouton&#x27;s analysis carries over easily to the general multiple-heap version of this game. The only difference is that as a first step, before computing the nim-sums we must reduce the sizes of the heaps modulo &quot;k&quot; + 1. If this makes all the heaps of size zero (in misère play), the winning move is to take &quot;k&quot; objects from one of the heaps. In particular, in ideal play from a single heap of &quot;n&quot; objects, the second player can win if and only if

* &quot;0&quot; = n (mod &quot;k&quot; + 1) (in normal play), or
* &quot;1&quot; = n (mod &quot;k&quot; + 1) (in misère play).

This follows from calculating the nim-sequence of &quot;S&quot;(1, 2, ..., &quot;k&quot;),

formula_2

from which the strategy above follows by the Sprague–Grundy theorem.

=== The 21 game ===

The game &quot;21&quot; is played as a misère game with any number of players who take turns saying a number. The first player says &quot;1&quot; and each player in turn increases the number by 1, 2, or 3, but may not exceed 21; the player forced to say &quot;21&quot; loses. This can be modeled as a subtraction game with a heap of objects. The winning strategy for the two-player version of this game is to always say a multiple of 4; it is then guaranteed that the other player will ultimately have to say 21; so in the standard version, wherein the first player opens with &quot;1&quot;, they start with a losing move.

The 21 game can also be played with different numbers, e.g., &quot;Add at most 5; lose on 34&quot;.

A sample game of 21 in which the second player follows the winning strategy:

=== The 100 game ===
A similar version is the &quot;100 game&quot;: Two players start from 0 and alternately add a number from 1 to 10 to the sum. The player who reaches 100 wins. The winning strategy is to reach a number in which the digits are subsequent (e.g., 01, 12, 23, 34...) and control the game by jumping through all the numbers of this sequence. Once a player reaches 89, the opponent can only choose numbers from 90 to 99, and the next answer can in any case be 100.

=== A multiple-heap rule ===
In another variation of nim, besides removing any number of objects from a single heap, one is permitted to remove the same number of objects from each heap.

=== Circular nim ===
Yet another variation of nim is &quot;circular nim&quot;, wherein any number of objects are placed in a circle and two players alternately remove one, two or three adjacent objects. For example, starting with a circle of ten objects,

three objects are taken in the first move

 _ . . . . . . . _ _

then another three

 _ . _ _ _ . . . _ _

then one

 _ . _ _ _ . . _ _ _

but then three objects cannot be taken out in one move.

=== Grundy&#x27;s game ===

In Grundy&#x27;s game, another variation of nim, a number of objects are placed in an initial heap and two players alternately divide a heap into two nonempty heaps of different sizes. Thus, six objects may be divided into piles of 5+1 or 4+2, but not 3+3. Grundy&#x27;s game can be played as either misère or normal play.

=== Greedy nim ===

Greedy nim is a variation wherein the players are restricted to choosing stones from only the largest pile. It is a finite impartial game. Greedy nim misère has the same rules as greedy nim, but the last player able to make a move loses.

Let the largest number of stones in a pile be &quot;m&quot; and the second largest number of stones in a pile be &quot;n&quot;. Let &quot;p&quot;&quot;m&quot; be the number of piles having &quot;m&quot; stones and &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot; be the number of piles having &quot;n&quot; stones. Then there is a theorem that game positions with &quot;p&quot;&quot;m&quot; even are &quot;P&quot; positions.
 This theorem can be shown by considering the positions where &quot;p&quot;&quot;m&quot; is odd. If &quot;p&quot;&quot;m&quot; is larger than 1, all stones may be removed from this pile to reduce &quot;p&quot;&quot;m&quot; by 1 and the new &quot;p&quot;&quot;m&quot; will be even. If &quot;p&quot;&quot;m&quot; = 1 (i.e. the largest heap is unique), there are two cases:
* If &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot; is odd, the size of the largest heap is reduced to &quot;n&quot; (so now the new &quot;p&quot;&quot;m&quot; is even).
* If &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot; is even, the largest heap is removed entirely, leaving an even number of largest heaps.
Thus, there exists a move to a state where &quot;p&quot;&quot;m&quot; is even. Conversely, if &quot;p&quot;&quot;m&quot; is even, if any move is possible (&quot;p&quot;&quot;m&quot; ≠ 0), then it must take the game to a state where &quot;p&quot;&quot;m&quot; is odd. The final position of the game is even (&quot;p&quot;&quot;m&quot; = 0). Hence, each position of the game with &quot;p&quot;&quot;m&quot; even must be a &quot;P&quot; position.

=== Index-&quot;k&quot; nim ===

A generalization of multi-heap nim was called &quot;nimformula_3&quot; or &quot;index-&quot;k&quot;&quot; nim by E. H. Moore, who analyzed it in 1910. In index-&quot;k&quot; nim, instead of removing objects from only one heap, players can remove objects from at least one but up to &quot;k&quot; different heaps. The number of elements that may be removed from each heap may be either arbitrary or limited to at most &quot;r&quot; elements, like in the &quot;subtraction game&quot; above.

The winning strategy is as follows: Like in ordinary multi-heap nim, one considers the binary representation of the heap sizes (or heap sizes modulo &quot;r&quot; + 1). In ordinary nim one forms the XOR-sum (or sum modulo 2) of each binary digit, and the winning strategy is to make each XOR sum zero. In the generalization to index-&quot;k&quot; nim, one forms the sum of each binary digit modulo &quot;k&quot; + 1.

Again, the winning strategy is to move such that this sum is zero for every digit. Indeed, the value thus computed is zero for the final position, and given a configuration of heaps for which this value is zero, any change of at most &quot;k&quot; heaps will make the value non-zero. Conversely, given a configuration with non-zero value, one can always take from at most &quot;k&quot; heaps, carefully chosen, so that the value will become zero.

=== Building nim ===

Building nim is a variant of nim wherein the two players first construct the game of nim. Given &quot;n&quot; stones and &quot;s&quot; empty piles, the players, alternating turns, place exactly one stone into a pile of their choice. Once all the stones are placed, a game of Nim begins, starting with the next player that would move. This game is denoted &quot;BN(n,s)&quot;.

=== Higher-dimensional nim ===

&quot;n&quot;-d nim is played on a formula_4 board, whereon any number of continuous pieces can be removed from any hyper-row. The starting position is usually the full board, but other options are allowed.

=== Graph nim ===

The starting board is a disconnected graph, and players take turns to remove adjacent vertices.

=== Candy nim ===

Candy nim is a version of normal-play nim in which players try to achieve two goals at the same time: taking the last object (in this case, candy) and taking the maximum number of candies by the end of the game.

<text>Anne &quot;Ninon&quot; de l&#x27;Enclos, also spelled Ninon de Lenclos and Ninon de Lanclos (10 November 1620 – 17 October 1705), was a French author, courtesan and patron of the arts.

==Early life==
Born Anne de l&#x27;Enclos in Paris on 10 November 1620, she was nicknamed &quot;Ninon&quot; at an early age by her father, Henri de l&#x27;Enclos, a lutenist and published composer, who taught her to sing and play the lute. In 1632, he was exiled from France after a duel. When Ninon&#x27;s mother, Marie Barbe de la Marche, died ten years later, the unmarried Ninon entered a convent, only to leave the next year. For the remainder of her life she was determined to remain unmarried and independent.

==Life as a courtesan and author==
Returning to Paris, she became a popular figure in the salons, and her own drawing room became a centre for the discussion and consumption of the literary arts. In her early thirties she was responsible for encouraging the young Molière, and when she died she left money for the son of her notary, a nine-year-old named François-Marie Arouet, later to become known as Voltaire, so he could buy books.

It was during this period that her life as a courtesan began. Ninon took a succession of notable and wealthy lovers, including the king&#x27;s cousin the Great Condé, Gaston de Coligny, and François, duc de La Rochefoucauld. These men did not support her, however; she prided herself on her independent income. Saint-Simon wrote: &quot;Ninon always had crowds of adorers but never more than one lover at a time, and when she tired of the present occupier, she said so frankly and took another. Yet such was the authority of this wanton, that no man dared fall out with his successful rival; he was only too happy to be allowed to visit as a familiar friend.&quot; In 1652, Ninon took up with Louis de Mornay, the marquis de Villarceaux, by whom she had a son, also named Louis. She lived with the marquis until 1655, when she returned to Paris. When she would not return to him, the marquis fell into a fever; to console him, Ninon cut her hair and sent the shorn locks to him, starting a vogue for bobbed hair &quot;à la Ninon&quot;.

This life (less acceptable in her time than it would become in later years) and her opinions on organised religion caused her some trouble, and she was imprisoned in the Madelonnettes Convent in 1656 at the behest of Anne of Austria, Queen of France and regent for her son Louis XIV. Not long after, however, she was visited by Christina, former queen of Sweden. Impressed, Christina wrote to Cardinal Mazarin on Ninon&#x27;s behalf and arranged for her release.

In response, as an author she defended the possibility of living a good life in the absence of religion, notably in 1659&#x27;s &quot;La coquette vengée&quot; (&quot;The Flirt Avenged&quot;). She was also noted for her wit; among her numerous sayings and quips are &quot;Much more genius is needed to make love than to command armies&quot; and &quot;We should take care to lay in a stock of provisions, but not of pleasures: these should be gathered day by day.&quot; An &quot;admirable sketch&quot; of Ninon, under the name of Damo, occurs in Mlle. de Scudéry&#x27;s novel &quot;Clélie&quot; (1654–1661).

Starting in the late 1660s she retired from her courtesan lifestyle and concentrated more on her literary friends – from 1667, she hosted her gatherings at &quot;l&#x27;hôtel Sagonne&quot;, which was considered &quot;the&quot; location of the salon of Ninon de l&#x27;Enclos despite other locales in the past. During this time she was a friend of Jean Racine, the great French playwright. Later she would become a close friend with the devout Françoise d&#x27;Aubigné, better known as Madame de Maintenon, the lady-in-waiting who would later become the second wife of Louis XIV. Saint-Simon wrote that &quot;The lady did not like her to be mentioned in her presence, but dared not disown her, and wrote cordial letters to her from time to time, to the day of her death&quot;. Ninon eventually died at the age of 84, as a very wealthy woman. To the end, she &quot;was convinced that she had no soul, and never abandoned that conviction, not even in advanced old age, not even at the hour of her death.&quot;

==Legacy==
Immanuel Kant in his Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime uses Lenclos&#x27;s life to emphasize how the most bitter reproach for an eighteenth-century woman was to be called unchaste: &quot;The maiden Ninon Lenclos made not the least claims to the honor of chastity, and nevertheless she would have been implacably offended if one of her lovers had gone so far in his judgment.&quot; Kant underscored the sexist moral double-standard during Lenclos&#x27; life and during Kant&#x27;s life time.

Ninon de l&#x27;Enclos is a relatively obscure figure in the English-speaking world, but is much better known in France where her name is synonymous with wit and beauty. Saint-Simon noted &quot;Ninon made friends among the great in every walk of life, had wit and intelligence enough to keep them, and, what is more, to keep them friendly with one another.&quot;

Edgar Allan Poe mentioned her in his short story &quot;The spectacles,&quot; as did Rudyard Kipling the &quot;Venus Annodomini&quot;. Edwin Arlington Robinson used Ninon as a symbol of aging beauty in his poem &quot;Veteran Sirens.&quot; Dorothy Parker wrote the poem &quot;Ninon De L&#x27;Enclos On Her Last Birthday&quot; and also referred to Ninon in another of her poems, &quot;Words Of Comfort To Be Scratched On A Mirror&quot;. L&#x27;Enclos is the eponymous heroine of Charles Lecocq&#x27;s 1896 opéra comique, &quot;Ninette&quot;.

<text>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is an agency of the United States Department of Commerce whose mission is to promote American innovation and industrial competitiveness. NIST&#x27;s activities are organized into physical science laboratory programs that include nanoscale science and technology, engineering, information technology, neutron research, material measurement, and physical measurement. From 1901 to 1988, the agency was named the National Bureau of Standards.

== History ==

===Background===
The Articles of Confederation, ratified by the colonies in 1781, provided:

The United States in Congress assembled shall also have the sole and exclusive right and power of regulating the alloy and value of coin struck by their own authority, or by that of the respective states—fixing the standards of weights and measures throughout the United States.

Article 1, section 8, of the Constitution of the United States, ratified in 1789, granted these powers to the new Congress: &quot;The Congress shall have power ... To coin money, regulate the value thereof, and of foreign coin, and fix the standard of weights and measures&quot;.

In January 1790, President George Washington, in his first annual message to Congress, said, &quot;Uniformity in the currency, weights, and measures of the United States is an object of great importance, and will, I am persuaded, be duly attended to.&quot;

On October 25, 1791, Washington again appealed Congress:

A uniformity of the weights and measures of the country is among the important objects submitted to you by the Constitution and if it can be derived from a standard at once invariable and universal, must be no less honorable to the public council than conducive to the public convenience.

In 1821, President John Quincy Adams declared, &quot;Weights and measures may be ranked among the necessities of life to every individual of human society.&quot;. Nevertheless, it was not until 1838 that the United States government adopted a uniform set of standards.

From 1830 until 1901, the role of overseeing weights and measures was carried out by the Office of Standard Weights and Measures, which was part of the Survey of the Coast—renamed the United States Coast Survey in 1836 and the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1878—in the United States Department of the Treasury.

===Bureau of Standards (1901–1988)===
In 1901, in response to a bill proposed by Congressman James H. Southard (R, Ohio), the National Bureau of Standards was founded with the mandate to provide standard weights and measures, and to serve as the national physical laboratory for the United States. Southard had previously sponsored a bill for metric conversion of the United States.

President Theodore Roosevelt appointed Samuel W. Stratton as the first director. The budget for the first year of operation was $40,000. The Bureau took custody of the copies of the kilogram and meter bars that were the standards for US measures, and set up a program to provide metrology services for United States scientific and commercial users. A laboratory site was constructed in Washington, DC, and instruments were acquired from the national physical laboratories of Europe. In addition to weights and measures, the Bureau developed instruments for electrical units and for measurement of light. In 1905 a meeting was called that would be the first &quot;National Conference on Weights and Measures&quot;.

Initially conceived as purely a metrology agency, the Bureau of Standards was directed by Herbert Hoover to set up divisions to develop commercial standards for materials and products. Some of these standards were for products intended for government use, but product standards also affected private-sector consumption. Quality standards were developed for products including some types of clothing, automobile brake systems and headlamps, antifreeze, and electrical safety. During World War I, the Bureau worked on multiple problems related to war production, even operating its own facility to produce optical glass when European supplies were cut off. Between the wars, Harry Diamond of the Bureau developed a blind approach radio aircraft landing system. During World War II, military research and development was carried out, including development of radio propagation forecast methods, the proximity fuze and the standardized airframe used originally for Project Pigeon, and shortly afterwards the autonomously radar-guided Bat anti-ship guided bomb and the Kingfisher family of torpedo-carrying missiles.
In 1948, financed by the United States Air Force, the Bureau began design and construction of SEAC, the Standards Eastern Automatic Computer. The computer went into operation in May 1950 using a combination of vacuum tubes and solid-state diode logic. About the same time the Standards Western Automatic Computer, was built at the Los Angeles office of the NBS by Harry Huskey and used for research there. A mobile version, DYSEAC, was built for the Signal Corps in 1954.

===National Institute of Standards and Technology (from 1988)===

Due to a changing mission, the &quot;National Bureau of Standards&quot; became the &quot;National Institute of Standards and Technology&quot; in 1988. Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, under the National Construction Safety Team Act (NCST), NIST conducted the official investigation into the collapse of the World Trade Center buildings. Following the 2021 Surfside condominium building collapse, NIST sent engineers to the site to investigate the cause of the collapse.

In 2019, NIST launched a program named NIST on a Chip to decrease the size of instruments from lab machines to chip size. Applications include aircraft testing, communication with satellites for navigation purposes, and temperature and pressure. 

In 2023, the Biden administration began plans to create a U.S. AI Safety Institute within NIST to coordinate AI safety matters. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, NIST is considered &quot;notoriously underfunded and understaffed&quot;, which could present an obstacle to these efforts.

==Constitution==
NIST, known between 1901 and 1988 as the National Bureau of Standards (NBS), is a measurement standards laboratory, also known as the National Metrological Institute (NMI), which is a non-regulatory agency of the United States Department of Commerce. The institute&#x27;s official mission is to:

NIST had an operating budget for fiscal year 2007 (October 1, 2006September 30, 2007) of about $843.3 million. NIST&#x27;s 2009 budget was $992 million, and it also received $610 million as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. NIST employs about 2,900 scientists, engineers, technicians, and support and administrative personnel. About 1,800 NIST associates (guest researchers and engineers from American companies and foreign countries) complement the staff. In addition, NIST partners with 1,400 manufacturing specialists and staff at nearly 350 affiliated centers around the country. NIST publishes the Handbook 44 that provides the &quot;Specifications, tolerances, and other technical requirements for weighing and measuring devices&quot;.

===Metric system===
The Congress of 1866 made use of the metric system in commerce a legally protected activity through the passage of Metric Act of 1866. On May 20, 1875, 17 out of 20 countries signed a document known as the &quot;Metric Convention&quot; or the &quot;Treaty of the Meter&quot;, which established the International Bureau of Weights and Measures under the control of an international committee elected by the General Conference on Weights and Measures.

==Organization==

NIST is headquartered in Gaithersburg, Maryland, and operates a facility in Boulder, Colorado, which was dedicated by President Eisenhower in 1954. NIST&#x27;s activities are organized into laboratory programs and extramural programs. Effective October 1, 2010, NIST was realigned by reducing the number of NIST laboratory units from ten to six. NIST Laboratories include:
* Communications Technology Laboratory (CTL)
* Engineering Laboratory (EL)
* Information Technology Laboratory (ITL)
* Center for Neutron Research (NCNR)
* Material Measurement Laboratory (MML)
* Physical Measurement Laboratory (PML)

Extramural programs include:
* Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP), a nationwide network of centers to assist small and mid-sized manufacturers to create and retain jobs, improve efficiencies, and minimize waste through process improvements and to increase market penetration with innovation and growth strategies;
* Technology Innovation Program (TIP), a grant program where NIST and industry partners cost share the early-stage development of innovative but high-risk technologies;
* Baldrige Performance Excellence Program, which administers the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award, the nation&#x27;s highest award for performance and business excellence.

 NIST&#x27;s Boulder laboratories are best known for NIST‑F1, which houses an atomic clock. NIST‑F1 serves as the source of the nation&#x27;s official time. From its measurement of the natural resonance frequency of cesium—which defines the second—NIST broadcasts time signals via longwave radio station WWVB near Fort Collins, Colorado, and shortwave radio stations WWV and WWVH, located near Fort Collins and Kekaha, Hawaii, respectively.

NIST also operates a neutron science user facility: the NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR). The NCNR provides scientists access to a variety of neutron scattering instruments, which they use in many research fields (materials science, fuel cells, biotechnology, etc.).

The SURF III Synchrotron Ultraviolet Radiation Facility is a source of synchrotron radiation, in continuous operation since 1961. SURF III now serves as the US national standard for source-based radiometry throughout the generalized optical spectrum. All NASA-borne, extreme-ultraviolet observation instruments have been calibrated at SURF since the 1970s, and SURF is used for the measurement and characterization of systems for extreme ultraviolet lithography.

The Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST) performs research in nanotechnology, both through internal research efforts and by running a user-accessible cleanroom nanomanufacturing facility. This &quot;NanoFab&quot; is equipped with tools for lithographic patterning and imaging (e.g., electron microscopes and atomic force microscopes).

===Committees===
NIST has seven standing committees:

* Technical Guidelines Development Committee (TGDC)
* Advisory Committee on Earthquake Hazards Reduction (ACEHR)
* National Construction Safety Team Advisory Committee (NCST Advisory Committee)
* Information Security and Privacy Advisory Board (ISPAB)
* Visiting Committee on Advanced Technology (VCAT)
* Board of Overseers for the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award (MBNQA Board of Overseers)
* Manufacturing Extension Partnership National Advisory Board (MEPNAB)

==Projects==
===Measurements and standards===
As part of its mission, NIST supplies industry, academia, government, and other users with over 1,300 Standard Reference Materials (SRMs). These artifacts are certified as having specific characteristics or component content, used as calibration standards for measuring equipment and procedures, quality control benchmarks for industrial processes, and experimental control samples.

===&quot;Handbook 44&quot;===
NIST publishes the &quot;Handbook 44&quot; each year after the annual meeting of the National Conference on Weights and Measures (NCWM). Each edition is developed through cooperation of the Committee on Specifications and Tolerances of the NCWM and the Weights and Measures Division (WMD) of NIST. The purpose of the book is a partial fulfillment of the statutory responsibility for &quot;cooperation with the states in securing uniformity of weights and measures laws and methods of inspection&quot;.

NIST has been publishing various forms of what is now the &quot;Handbook 44&quot; since 1918 and began publication under the current name in 1949. The 2010 edition conforms to the concept of the primary use of the SI (metric) measurements recommended by the Omnibus Foreign Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988.

===Homeland security===
NIST is developing government-wide identity document standards for federal employees and contractors to prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to government buildings and computer systems.

===World Trade Center collapse investigation===
In 2002, the National Construction Safety Team Act mandated NIST to conduct an investigation into the collapse of the World Trade Center buildings 1 and 2 and the 47-story 7 World Trade Center. The &quot;World Trade Center Collapse Investigation&quot;, directed by lead investigator Shyam Sunder, covered three aspects, including a technical building and fire safety investigation to study the factors contributing to the probable cause of the collapses of the WTC Towers (WTC 1 and 2) and WTC 7. NIST also established a research and development program to provide the technical basis for improved building and fire codes, standards, and practices, and a dissemination and technical assistance program to engage leaders of the construction and building community in implementing proposed changes to practices, standards, and codes. NIST also is providing practical guidance and tools to better prepare facility owners, contractors, architects, engineers, emergency responders, and regulatory authorities to respond to future disasters. The investigation portion of the response plan was completed with the release of the final report on 7 World Trade Center on November 20, 2008. The final report on the WTC Towers—including 30 recommendations for improving building and occupant safety—was released on October 26, 2005.

===Election technology===
NIST works in conjunction with the Technical Guidelines Development Committee of the Election Assistance Commission to develop the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines for voting machines and other election technology.
===Cybersecurity Framework===
In February 2014 NIST published the NIST Cybersecurity Framework that serves as voluntary guidance for organizations to manage and reduce cybersecurity risk. It was later amended and Version 1.1 was published in April 2018. Executive Order 13800, Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure, made the Framework mandatory for U.S. federal government agencies. An extension to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework is the Cybersecurity Maturity Model (CMMC) which was introduced in 2019 (though the origin of CMMC began with Executive Order 13556).

It emphasizes the importance of implementing Zero-trust architecture (ZTA) which focuses on protecting resources over the network perimeter. ZTA utilizes zero trust principles which include &quot;never trust, always verify&quot;, &quot;assume breach&quot; and &quot;least privileged access&quot; to safeguard users, assets, and resources. Since ZTA holds no implicit trust to users within the network perimeter, authentication and authorization are performed at every stage of a digital transaction. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access to resources.

NIST released a draft of the CSF 2.0 for public comment through November 4, 2023. NIST decided to update the framework to make it more applicable to small and medium size enterprises that use the framework, as well as to accommodate the constantly changing nature of cybersecurity.

In August 2024, NIST released a final set of encryption tools designed to withstand the attack of a quantum computer. These post-quantum encryption standards secure a wide range of electronic information, from confidential email messages to e-commerce transactions that propel the modern economy.

==People==
Four scientific researchers at NIST have been awarded Nobel Prizes for work in physics: William Daniel Phillips in 1997, Eric Allin Cornell in 2001, John Lewis Hall in 2005 and David Jeffrey Wineland in 2012, which is the largest number for any US government laboratory. All four were recognized for their work related to laser cooling of atoms, which is directly related to the development and advancement of the atomic clock. In 2011, Dan Shechtman was awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry for his work on quasicrystals in the Metallurgy Division from 1982 to 1984. In addition, John Werner Cahn was awarded the 2011 Kyoto Prize for Materials Science, and the National Medal of Science has been awarded to NIST researchers Cahn (1998) and Wineland (2007). Other notable people who have worked at NBS or NIST include:
* Milton Abramowitz

==Directors==
Since 1989, the director of NIST has been a Presidential appointee and is confirmed by the United States Senate, and since that year the average tenure of NIST directors has fallen from 11 years to 2 years in duration. Since the 2011 reorganization of NIST, the director also holds the title of Under Secretary of Commerce for Standards and Technology. Seventeen individuals have officially held the position (in addition to seven acting directors who have served on a temporary basis).

==Patents==
NIST holds patents on behalf of the Federal government of the United States, with at least one of them being custodial to protect public domain use, such as one for a Chip-scale atomic clock, developed by a NIST team as part of a DARPA competition.

==Controversy regarding NIST standard SP 800-90==
In September 2013, both &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that NIST allowed the National Security Agency (NSA) to insert a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator called Dual EC DRBG into NIST standard SP 800-90 that had a kleptographic backdoor that the NSA can use to covertly predict the future outputs of this pseudorandom number generator thereby allowing the surreptitious decryption of data. Both papers report that the NSA worked covertly to get its own version of SP 800-90 approved for worldwide use in 2006. The whistle-blowing document states that &quot;eventually, NSA became the sole editor&quot;. The reports confirm suspicions and technical grounds publicly raised by cryptographers in 2007 that the EC-DRBG could contain a kleptographic backdoor (perhaps placed in the standard by NSA).

NIST responded to the allegations, stating that &quot;NIST works to publish the strongest cryptographic standards possible&quot; and that it uses &quot;a transparent, public process to rigorously vet our recommended standards&quot;. The agency stated that &quot;there has been some confusion about the standards development process and the role of different organizations in it...The National Security Agency (NSA) participates in the NIST cryptography process because of its recognized expertise. NIST is also required by statute to consult with the NSA.&quot; Recognizing the concerns expressed, the agency reopened the public comment period for the SP800-90 publications, promising that &quot;if vulnerabilities are found in these or any other NIST standards, we will work with the cryptographic community to address them as quickly as possible&quot;. Due to public concern of this cryptovirology attack, NIST rescinded the EC-DRBG algorithm from the NIST SP 800-90 standard.

==Publications==

* The &quot;Journal of Research of the National Institute of Standards and Technology&quot; was the flagship scientific journal at NIST. It was published from 1904 to 2022.
* First published in 1972, the &quot;Journal of Physical and Chemical Reference Data&quot;, is a joint venture of the American Institute of Physics and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

In addition to these journals, NIST (and the National Bureau of Standards before it) has a robust technical reports publishing arm. NIST technical reports are published in several dozen series, which cover a wide range of topics, from computer technology to construction to aspects of standardization including weights, measures and reference data. In addition to technical reports, NIST scientists publish many journal and conference papers each year; an database of these, along with more recent technical reports, can be found on the NIST website.

<text>NATO uses a system of code names, called reporting names, to denote military aircraft and other equipment used by post-Soviet states, former Warsaw Pact countries, China, and other countries. The system assists military communications by providing short, one or two-syllable names, as alternatives to the precise proper names, which may be easily confused under operational conditions or are unknown in the Western world.

The assignment of reporting names is managed by the Five Eyes Air Force Interoperability Council (AFIC), previously known as the Air Standardization Coordinating Committee (ASCC), which is separate from NATO. Based in Washington DC, AFIC comprises representatives from the militaries of three NATO members (Canada, the United Kingdom and United States) and two non-NATO countries (Australia and New Zealand).

When the system was introduced in the 1950s, reporting names also implicitly designated potentially hostile aircraft. However, since the end of the Cold War, some NATO air forces have operated various aircraft types with reporting names (e.g. the &quot;Fulcrum&quot; Mikoyan MiG-29).

==American variations==
The United States Department of Defense (DOD) expands on the NATO reporting names in some cases. NATO refers to surface-to-air missile systems mounted on ships or submarines with the same names as the corresponding land-based systems, but the US DOD assigns a different series of numbers with a different prefix (i.e., SA-N- versus SA-) for these systems. The names are kept the same as a convenience. Where there is no corresponding system, a new name is devised.

==Soviet nicknames==
The Soviet Union did not always assign official &quot;popular names&quot; to its aircraft, but unofficial nicknames were common as in any air force. Generally, Soviet pilots did not use the NATO names, preferring a native Russian nickname. An exception was that Soviet airmen appreciated the MiG-29&#x27;s codename &quot;Fulcrum&quot;, as an indication of its pivotal role in Soviet air defence.

==Nomenclature==
To reduce the risk of confusion, unusual or made-up names are allocated, the idea being that the names chosen are unlikely to occur in normal conversation and are easier to memorise.

For fixed-wing aircraft, the number of syllables indicates the type of the aircraft&#x27;s engine. Single-syllable code names denote reciprocating engine or turboprop, while two-syllable code names denote jet engine.

Bombers have names starting with the letter &quot;B&quot;, and names like &quot;Badger&quot; (Tupolev Tu-16), &quot;Blackjack&quot; (Tupolev Tu-160) and &quot;Bear&quot; (Tupolev Tu-95) have been used. &quot;Frogfoot&quot;, the reporting name for the Sukhoi Su-25, references the aircraft&#x27;s close air support role. Transports have names starting with &quot;C&quot; (for &quot;cargo&quot;), resulting in names like &quot;Condor&quot; for the Antonov An-124 or &quot;Candid&quot; for the Ilyushin Il-76.

==Lists of NATO reporting names==

=== Missiles ===
Source:

The initial letter of the name indicates the use of that equipment. The alphanumeric designations (e.g. AA-2) are assigned by the Department of Defense.

* A—air-to-air missiles, example AA-2 Atoll: List of NATO reporting names for air-to-air missiles
* K—air-to-surface missiles (from the Russian Kh designation), example AS-6 Kingfish: List of NATO reporting names for air-to-surface missiles
* G—surface-to-air missiles, SAM (or Ground-to-air), including ship- and submarine-launched, example SA-15 Gauntlet: List of NATO reporting names for surface-to-air missiles
* S—surface-to-surface missiles, 
**ship- and submarine-launched. Land-based missiles have the prefix SS-, for example the SS-1 Scud. Naval missiles receive the designation SS-N-, e.g. SS-N-2 Styx. Coastal defence missiles are assigned the prefix SS-C-, e.g. SS-C-5 Stooge: List of NATO reporting names for surface-to-surface missiles
** reporting names for anti-tank missiles include AT-5 Spandrel.

=== Aircraft ===
Source:

The first letter indicates the type of aircraft, e.g., &quot;Bear&quot; for a bomber aircraft refers to the Tupolev Tu-95, or &quot;Fulcrum&quot; for the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-29 fighter aircraft. For fixed-wing aircraft, one-syllable names are used for propeller aircraft and two-syllable names for aircraft with jet engines. This distinction is not made for helicopters.
* F—fighter aircraft, also later ground attack aircraft: List of NATO reporting names for fighter aircraft
* B—bomber aircraft: List of NATO reporting names for bomber aircraft
* C—commercial aircraft and airliners, and cargo aircraft: List of NATO reporting names for transport aircraft
* H—helicopters: List of NATO reporting names for helicopters
* M— miscellaneous names are used for trainers, reconnaissance, seaplanes, tankers, airborne early warning

=== Submarines ===
Before the 1980s, reporting names for submarines were taken from the NATO spelling alphabet. Modifications of existing designs were given descriptive terms, such as &quot;Whiskey Long Bin&quot;. From the 1980s, new designs were given names derived from Russian words, such as &quot;Akula&quot;, or &quot;shark&quot;. These names did not correspond to the Soviet names. Coincidentally, &quot;Akula&quot;, which was assigned to an attack submarine by NATO, was the actual Soviet name for the ballistic missile submarine NATO named &quot;Typhoon-class&quot;. The NATO names for submarines of the People&#x27;s Republic of China are taken from Chinese dynasties.

<text>NATO reporting name for AS series air-to-surface missiles, with Soviet designations:

Note: The Soviet / Russian designation is a Cyrillic letter &quot;Х&quot;, which is translated as &quot;Kh&quot; or &quot;H&quot;. Also, sometimes a combination (&quot;complex&quot;) of a missile with its aircraft is marked with a letter &quot;K&quot; (for example, a missile Kh-22 with an aircraft is a &quot;complex K-22&quot;). The Cyrillic &quot;X&quot; (read &quot;Kh&quot;) in the designation of Soviet ASMs is in fact a Latin &quot;X&quot; (&quot;ecks&quot;) for Xperimental, as used by the design bureau. With passing time, however, this was ignored and used in Soviet/Russian as well as foreign literature as the Cyrillic Kh.

<text>The Five Eyes Air Force Interoperability Council (AFIC) assigns codenames for fighters and other military aircraft originating in, or operated by, the air forces of the former Warsaw Pact, including Russia, and the People&#x27;s Republic of China. 

When the system began the names were assigned by the Air Standardization Coordinating Committee (ASCC), made up of the English-speaking allies of the Second World War, the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and two non-NATO countries, Australia and New Zealand. The ASCC names were adopted by the U.S. Department of Defense and then NATO. They have also become known as &quot;NATO reporting names&quot;. The ASCC became the Five Eyes Air Force Interoperability Council and no longer has responsibility for generating reporting names.

<doc id="21904" wikidata="Q3267058" url="?curid=21904" title="List of NATO reporting names for submarines">
<text>NATO has a system of reporting names for non-Western submarines. During the Cold War, NATO introduced a system of internal code names for classes of Soviet and Chinese submarines. This served to provide standard names where the official designation of a Soviet/Chinese designations of vessels were unknown. The system was influenced by a pre-existing, separate system for reporting non-Western aircraft.

Until the 1980s, reporting names for submarines were taken from the NATO spelling alphabet. Modifications of existing designs were given descriptive terms, such as &quot;Whiskey Long Bin&quot;. From the 1980s onwards, new designs were given names derived from Russian words, such as &quot;Akula&quot; (&quot;Shark&quot;). These names did not correspond to the Soviet names. Coincidentally, &quot;Akula&quot;, which was assigned to an attack submarine by NATO, was the actual Soviet name for another, ballistic missile submarine class, which NATO designated &quot;Typhoon&quot;. 

The names for Chinese submarines are taken from Chinese dynasties.

<text>In Judaism, the Seven Laws of Noah (, &quot;Sheva Mitzvot B&#x27;nei Noach&quot;), otherwise referred to as the Noahide Laws or the Noachian Laws (from the Hebrew pronunciation of &quot;Noah&quot;), are a set of universal moral laws which, according to the Talmud, were given by God as a covenant with Noah and with the &quot;sons of Noah&quot;—that is, all of humanity.

The Seven Laws of Noah include prohibitions against worshipping idols, cursing God, murder, adultery and sexual immorality, theft, eating flesh torn from a living animal, as well as the obligation to establish courts of justice.

According to Jewish law, non-Jews (gentiles) are not obligated to convert to Judaism, but they are required to observe the Seven Laws of Noah to be assured of a place in the World to Come (&quot;Olam Ha-Ba&quot;), the final reward of the righteous. The non-Jews that choose to follow the Seven Laws of Noah are regarded as &quot;Righteous Gentiles&quot; (, &quot;Chassiddei Umot ha-Olam&quot;: &quot;Pious People of the World&quot;).

== List ==
The seven Noahide laws as traditionally enumerated in the Babylonian Talmud &quot;Sanhedrin&quot; 56a-b and Tosefta &quot;Avodah Zarah&quot; 9:4, are the following:

# Not to worship idols.
# Not to curse God.
# Not to commit murder.
# Not to commit adultery or sexual immorality.
# Not to steal.
# Not to eat flesh torn from a living animal.
# To establish courts of justice.

According to the Talmud, the seven laws were given first to Adam and subsequently to Noah. The Tannaitic and Amoraitic rabbinic sages (1st–6th centuries CE) disagreed on the exact number of Noahide laws that were originally given to Adam. Six of the seven laws were exegetically derived from passages in the Book of Genesis, with the seventh being the establishment of courts of justice. The earliest complete rabbinic version of the seven Noahide laws can be found in the Tosefta:

== Origins ==
=== Biblical sources ===
According to the Genesis flood narrative, a deluge covered the whole world on account of violent corruption on the earth, killing every surface-dwelling creature except Noah, his wife, his sons, their wives, and the animals taken aboard the Ark. According to the biblical narrative, all modern humans are descendants of Noah, thus the name &quot;Noahide Laws&quot; refers to the laws that apply to all of humanity. After the Flood, God sealed a covenant with Noah with the following admonitions as written in Genesis 9:4–6:
* Flesh of a living animal: (9:4)
* Murder and courts: (9:5–6)

=== Book of Jubilees ===
The Book of Jubilees, generally dated to the 1st century BCE, may include a substantially different list of six commandments at verses 7:20–25:
(1) to observe righteousness;
(2) to cover the shame of their flesh;
(3) to bless their creator;
(4) to honor their parents;
(5) to love their neighbor; and
(6) to guard against fornication, uncleanness, and all iniquity.

== Modern analysis ==
=== Rabbinical ===
The &quot;Encyclopedia Talmudit&quot;, edited by Rabbi Shlomo Yosef Zevin, states that after the giving of the Torah, the Jewish people were no longer included in the category of the sons of Noah. Maimonides (&quot;Mishneh Torah&quot;, &quot;Hilkhot M&#x27;lakhim&quot; 9:1) indicates that the seven commandments are also part of the Torah, and the Babylonian Talmud (&quot;Sanhedrin&quot; 59a, see also Tosafot ad. loc.) states that Jews are obligated in all things that gentiles are obligated in, albeit with some differences in the details. According to the &quot;Encyclopedia Talmudit&quot;, most medieval Jewish authorities considered that all the seven commandments were given to Adam, although Maimonides (&quot;Mishneh Torah&quot;, &quot;Hilkhot M&#x27;lakhim&quot; 9:1) considered the dietary law to have been given to Noah.

Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the Lubavitcher Rebbe, published and spoke about the Seven Laws of Noah many times. According to Schneerson&#x27;s view, based on a detailed reading of Maimonides&#x27; &quot;Hilkhot M&#x27;lakhim&quot;, the Talmud, and the Hebrew Bible, the seven laws originally given to Noah were given yet again, through Moses at Sinai, and it&#x27;s exclusively through the giving of the Torah that the seven laws derive their current force. What has changed with the giving of the Torah is that now, it is the duty of the Jewish people to bring the rest of the world to fulfill the Seven Laws of Noah.

=== Academic and secular ===
According to Michael S. Kogan, professor of philosophy and religious studies at Montclair State University, the Seven Laws of Noah are not explicitly mentioned in the Torah but were exegetically extrapolated from the Book of Genesis by 2nd-century rabbis, which wrote them down in the Tosefta.

According to Adam J. Silverstein, professor of Middle Eastern studies and Islamic studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jewish theologians started to rethink the relevance and applicability of the Seven Laws of Noah during the Middle Ages, primarily due to the precarious living conditions of the Jewish people under the Medieval Christian kingdoms and the Islamic world (see Jewish–Christian relations and Jewish–Islamic relations), since both Christians and Muslims recognize the patriarch Abraham as the unifying figure of the Abrahamic tradition, alongside the monotheistic conception of God. Silverstein states that Jewish theology came to include concepts and frameworks that would permit certain types of non-Jews to be recognized as righteous and deserving of life in the Hereafter due to the &quot;Noachide Law&quot;. He sees there being two &quot;Torahs&quot;: one for Jews, the other for the gentile &quot;Children of Noah&quot;. Whilst theoretically the Noachide Law should be universal, its prohibitions against blasphemy and idolatry mean that in practice it only really applied to non-idolatrous theists. Therefore, Jews normally considered Christians and/or Muslims when discussing this concept.

David Novak, professor of Jewish theology and ethics at the University of Toronto, presents a range of theories regarding the sources from which the Seven Laws of Noah originated, including the Hebrew Bible itself, Hittite laws, the Maccabean period, and the Roman period. Regarding the modern Noahide movement, he denounced it by stating that .

== Judaism ==
=== Talmud ===
According to the Talmud, the Noahide laws apply to all of humanity. In Judaism, the term &quot;B&#x27;nei Noach&quot; (, &quot;Sons of Noah&quot;) refers to all mankind. The Talmud also states: . Any non-Jew who lives according to these laws is regarded as one of the righteous among the gentiles. According to the Talmud, the seven laws were given first to Adam and subsequently to Noah. Six of the seven laws were exegetically derived from passages in the Book of Genesis, with the seventh being the establishment of courts of justice.

The Talmudic sages expanded the concept of universal morality within the Noahide laws and added several other laws beyond the seven listed in the Talmud and Tosefta which are attributed to different rabbis, such as prohibitions against committing incest, cruelty to animals, pairing animals of different species, grafting trees of different kinds, castration, emasculation, homosexuality, pederasty, and sorcery among others, with some of the sages, such as Ulla, going so far as to make a list of 30 laws. The Talmud expands the scope of the seven laws to cover about 100 of the 613 mitzvot.

=== Punishment ===
In practice, Jewish law makes it very difficult to apply the death penalty. No record exists of a gentile having been put to death for violating the seven Noahide laws. Some of the categories of capital punishment recorded in the Talmud are recorded as having never been carried out. It is thought that the rabbis included discussion of them in anticipation of the coming Messianic Age.

According Sanhedrin 56a, for Noahides convicted of a capital crime, the only sanctioned method of execution is decapitation, considered one of the lightest capital punishments. Other sources state that the execution is to be by stoning if he has intercourse with a Jewish betrothed woman, or by strangulation if the Jewish woman has completed the marriage ceremonies, but had not yet consummated the marriage. In Jewish law, the only form of blasphemy which is punishable by death is blaspheming the Ineffable Name (). Some Talmudic rabbis held that only those offences for which a Jew would be executed, are forbidden to gentiles. The Talmudic rabbis discuss which offences and sub-offences are capital offences and which are merely forbidden.

Maimonides states that anyone who does not accept the seven laws is to be executed, as God compelled the world to follow these laws. For the other prohibitions such as the grafting of trees and bestiality he holds that the sons of Noah are not to be executed. Maimonides adds a universalism lacking from earlier Jewish sources. The Talmud differs from Maimonides in that it considers the seven laws enforceable by Jewish authorities on non-Jews living within a Jewish nation. Nahmanides disagrees with Maimonides&#x27; reasoning. He limits the obligation of enforcing the seven laws to non-Jewish authorities, thus taking the matter out of Jewish hands. The Tosafot seems to agree with Nahmanides&#x27; reasoning. According to some opinions, punishment is the same whether the individual transgresses with knowledge of the law or is ignorant of the law.

Some authorities debate whether non-Jewish societies may decide to modify the Noachide laws of evidence (for example, by requiring more witnesses before punishment, or by permitting circumstantial evidence) if they consider that to be more just. Whilst Jewish law requires two witnesses, Noachide law, as recorded by Rambam, Hilkhot Melakhim 9:14, can accept the testimony of a single eyewitness as sufficient for use of the death penalty. Whilst a confession of guilt is not admissible as evidence before a Jewish court, it is a matter of considerable dispute as to whether or not it constitutes sufficient grounds for conviction in Noachide courts.

There is also some debate as to whether the ideal punishment for violation of these laws is the death penalty, or if it is up to the court&#x27;s discretion to decide which punishment is most fitting. While a simple reading of the Talmud might suggest that the ideal punishment is the death penalty, a number of prominent commentators, including Rav Yosef Eliyahu Henkin, have argued that it is up to the courts to decide.

=== Subdivisions ===
Various rabbinic sources have different positions on the way the seven laws are to be subdivided in categories. Maimonides, in his &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot;, included the grafting of trees. Like the Talmud, he interpreted the prohibition against homicide as including a prohibition against abortion. David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra, a commentator on Maimonides, expressed surprise that he left out castration and sorcery which were also listed in the Talmud.

The Talmudist Ulla wrote of 30 laws which the sons of Noah took upon themselves. He only lists three, namely the three that the gentiles follow: not to create a Ketubah between males, not to sell carrion or human flesh in the market and to respect the Torah. The rest of the laws are not listed. Though the authorities seem to take it for granted that Ulla&#x27;s thirty commandments included the original seven, an additional thirty laws are also possible from the reading. Two different lists of the 30 laws exist. Both lists include an additional twenty-three mitzvot which are subdivisions or extensions of the seven laws. One from the 16th-century work &quot;Asarah Maamarot&quot; by Rabbi Menahem Azariah da Fano and a second from the 10th century Samuel ben Hofni which was recently published from his Judeo-Arabic writings after having been found in the Cairo Geniza. Rabbi Zvi Hirsch Chajes suggests Menahem Azariah of Fano enumerated commandments are not related to the first seven, nor based on Scripture, but instead were passed down by oral tradition.

=== &quot;Ger toshav&quot; (resident alien) ===
During biblical times, a gentile living in the Land of Israel who did not want to convert to Judaism but accepted the Seven Laws of Noah as binding upon himself was granted the legal status of &quot;ger toshav&quot; (, &quot;ger&quot;: &quot;foreigner&quot; or &quot;alien&quot; + &quot;toshav&quot;: &quot;resident&quot;, lit. &quot;resident alien&quot;). A &quot;ger toshav&quot; is therefore commonly deemed a &quot;Righteous Gentile&quot; (, &quot;Chassid Umot ha-Olam&quot;: &quot;Pious People of the World&quot;), and is assured of a place in the World to Come (&quot;Olam Ha-Ba&quot;).

The rabbinic regulations regarding Jewish-gentile relations are modified in the case of a &quot;ger toshav&quot;. The accepted halakhic opinion is that the &quot;ger toshav&quot; must accept the seven Noahide laws in the presence of three &quot;haberim&quot; (men of authority), or, according to the rabbinic tradition, before a &quot;beth din&quot; (Jewish rabbinical court). He will receive certain legal protection and privileges from the Jewish community, and there is an obligation to render him aid when in need. The restrictions on having a gentile do work for a Jew on the Shabbat are also greater when the gentile is a &quot;ger toshav&quot;.

According to the Jewish philosopher and professor Menachem Kellner&#x27;s study on Maimonidean texts (1991), a &quot;ger toshav&quot; could be a transitional stage on the way to becoming a &quot;righteous alien&quot; (, &quot;ger tzedek&quot;), i.e. a full convert to Judaism. He conjectures that, according to Maimonides, only a full &quot;ger tzedek&quot; would be found during the Messianic era. Furthermore, Kellner criticizes the assumption within Orthodox Judaism that there is an , which he believes is contrary to what Maimonides thought and the Torah teaches, stating that .

According to Christine Hayes, an American scholar of ancient Judaism and early Christianity serving as the Sterling Professor of Religious Studies in Classical Judaica at Yale University, the &quot;gerim&quot; were not necessarily Gentile converts in the Hebrew Bible, whether in the modern or rabbinic sense. Nonetheless, they were granted many rights and privileges when they lived in the Land of Israel. For example, they could offer sacrifices, actively participate in Israelite politics, keep their distinct ethnic identity for many generations, inherit tribal allotments, etc.

=== Maimonides&#x27; view and his critics ===
During the Golden Age of Jewish culture in the Iberian Peninsula, the medieval Jewish philosopher and rabbi Maimonides (1135–1204) wrote in the halakhic legal code &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; that gentiles must perform exclusively the Seven Laws of Noah and refrain from studying the Torah or performing any Jewish commandment, including resting on the Shabbat. He also states that if gentiles want to perform any Jewish commandment besides the Seven Laws of Noah according to the correct halakhic procedure, they are not prevented from doing so. According to Maimonides, teaching non-Jews to follow the Seven Laws of Noah is incumbent on all Jews, a commandment in and of itself. Nevertheless, the majority of rabbinic authorities over the centuries have rejected Maimonides&#x27; opinion, and the dominant halakhic consensus has always been that Jews are not required to spread the Noahide laws to non-Jews.

Maimonides held that gentiles may have a part in the World to Come (&quot;Olam Ha-Ba&quot;) just by observing the Seven Laws of Noah and accepting them as divinely revealed to Moses. According to Maimonides, such non-Jews achieve the status of &quot;Chassid Umot Ha-Olam&quot; (&quot;Pious People of the World&quot;), and are different from those which solely keep the Noahide laws out of moral/ethical reasoning alone. He wrote in &quot;Hilkhot M&#x27;lakhim&quot;:&quot;

Some later editions of the &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; differ by one letter and read ; the latter reading is narrower. In either reading, Maimonides appears to exclude philosophical Noahides from being &quot;Righteous Gentiles&quot;. According to him, a truly &quot;Righteous Gentile&quot; follows the seven laws because they are divinely revealed, and thus are followed out of obedience to God.

The 15th-century Sephardic Orthodox rabbi Yosef Caro, one of the early Acharonim and author of the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;, rejected Maimonides&#x27; denial of the access to the World to Come to the gentiles who obey the Noahide laws guided only by their reason as anti-rationalistic and unfounded, asserting that there is not any justification to uphold such a view in the Talmud. The 17th-century Sephardic philosopher Baruch Spinoza read Maimonides as using &quot;nor&quot;, and accused him of being narrow and particularistic. Other Jewish philosophers influenced by Spinoza, such as Moses Mendelssohn and Hermann Cohen, also have formulated more inclusive and universal interpretations of the Seven Laws of Noah.

Moses Mendelssohn, one of the leading exponents of the Jewish enlightenment (&quot;Haskalah&quot;), strongly disagreed with Maimonides&#x27; opinion, and instead contended that gentiles which observe the Noahide laws out of ethical, moral, or philosophical reasoning, without believing in the Jewish monotheistic conception of God, retained the status of &quot;Righteous Gentiles&quot; and would still achieve salvation. According to Steven Schwarzschild, Maimonides&#x27; position has its source in his adoption of Aristotle&#x27;s skeptical attitude towards the ability of reason to arrive at moral truths, and this position, which is in comparison to other Jewish thinkers.

A novel understanding of Maimonides&#x27; position in the 20th century, advanced by the Ashkenazi Orthodox rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, is that a non-Jew who follows the commandments due to philosophical conviction rather than revelation (what Maimonides calls ) &quot;also&quot; merits the World to Come; this would be in line with Maimonides&#x27; general approach that following philosophical wisdom advances a person more than following revelatory commands.

=== Modern Noahide movement ===

Menachem Mendel Schneerson encouraged his followers on many occasions to preach the Seven Laws of Noah, devoting some of his addresses to the subtleties of this code. Since the 1990s, Orthodox Jewish rabbis from Israel, most notably those affiliated to Chabad-Lubavitch and religious Zionist organizations, including The Temple Institute, have set up a modern Noahide movement. These Noahide organizations, led by religious Zionist and Orthodox rabbis, are aimed at non-Jews to proselytize among them and commit them to follow the Noahide laws. These religious Zionist and Orthodox rabbis that guide the modern Noahide movement, who are often affiliated with the Third Temple movement, are accused of expounding a racist and supremacist ideology which consists in the belief that the Jewish people are God&#x27;s chosen nation and racially superior to non-Jews, and mentor Noahides because they believe that the Messianic era will begin with the rebuilding of the Third Temple on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem to re-institute the Jewish priesthood along with the practice of ritual sacrifices, and the establishment of a Jewish theocracy in Israel, supported by communities of Noahides. In 1990, Meir Kahane was the keynote speaker at the First International Conference of the Descendants of Noah, the first Noahide gathering, in Fort Worth, Texas. After the assassination of Meir Kahane that same year, The Temple Institute, which advocates rebuilding the Third Jewish Temple on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, started to promote the Noahide laws as well.

=== Public recognition ===
In the 1980s, rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson urged his followers to actively engage in activities to inform non-Jews about the Noahide laws, which had not been done in previous generations. The Chabad-Lubavitch movement has been one of the most active in Noahide outreach, believing that there is spiritual and societal value for non-Jews in at least simply acknowledging the Noahide laws.

In 1982, Chabad-Lubavitch had a reference to the Noahide laws enshrined in a U.S. Presidential proclamation: the &quot;Proclamation 4921&quot;, signed by the then-U.S. President Ronald Reagan. The United States Congress, recalling House Joint Resolution 447 and in celebration of Schneerson&#x27;s 80th birthday, proclaimed 4 April 1982, as a &quot;National Day of Reflection&quot;.

In 1989 and 1990, Chabad-Lubavitch had another reference to the Noahide laws enshrined in a U.S. presidential proclamation: the &quot;Proclamation 5956&quot;, signed by then-U.S. President George H. W. Bush. The United States Congress, recalling House Joint Resolution 173 and in celebration of Schneerson&#x27;s 87th birthday, proclaimed 16 April 1989, and 6 April 1990, as &quot;Education Day, U.S.A.&quot;

In January 2004, the spiritual leader of the Druze community in Israel, Sheikh Mowafak Tarif, met with a representative of Chabad-Lubavitch to sign a declaration calling on all non-Jews in Israel to observe the Noahide laws; the mayor of the Arab city of Shefa-&#x27;Amr (Shfaram) – where Muslim, Christian, and Druze communities live side-by-side – also signed the document.

In March 2016, the Sephardic Chief Rabbi of Israel, Yitzhak Yosef, declared during a sermon that Jewish law requires that only non-Jews who follow the Noahide laws are allowed to live in Israel: Yosef further added: Yosef&#x27;s sermon sparked outrage in Israel and was fiercely criticized by several human rights associations, NGOs and members of the Knesset; Jonathan Greenblatt, Anti-Defamation League&#x27;s CEO and national director, and Carole Nuriel, Anti-Defamation League&#x27;s Israel Office acting director, issued a strong denunciation of Yosef&#x27;s sermon:

=== Contemporary status ===
Historically, some rabbinic opinions consider non-Jews not only not obliged to adhere to all the remaining laws of the Torah, but actually forbidden from observing them.

Noahide law differs radically from Roman law for gentiles (&quot;Jus Gentium&quot;), if only because the latter was enforceable judicial policy. Rabbinic Judaism has never adjudicated any cases under the Noahide laws, and Jewish scholars disagree about whether the Noahide laws are a functional part of the &quot;Halakha&quot; (Jewish law).

Some modern views hold that penalties are a detail of the Noahide Laws and that Noahides themselves must determine the details of their own laws for themselves. According to this school of thought – see N. Rakover, &quot;Law and the Noahides&quot; (1998); M. Dallen, &quot;The Rainbow Covenant&quot; (2003) – the Noahide laws offer humankind a set of absolute values and a framework for righteousness and justice, while the detailed laws that are currently on the books of the world&#x27;s states and nations are presumptively valid.

In recent years, the term &quot;Noahide&quot; has come to refer to non-Jews who strive to live in accord with the seven Noahide Laws; the terms &quot;observant Noahide&quot; or &quot;Torah-centered Noahides&quot; would be more precise but these are infrequently used. Support for the use of &quot;Noahide&quot; in this sense can be found with the Ritva, who uses the term &quot;Son of Noah&quot; to refer to a gentile who keeps the seven laws, but is not a &quot;ger toshav&quot;.

== Early Christianity ==


In the history of Christianity, the Apostolic Decree recorded in Acts 15 is commonly seen as a parallel to the Seven Laws of Noah, and thus be a commonality rather than a differential. Some modern scholars dispute the connection between Acts 15 and the seven Noahide laws. The Apostolic Decree is still observed by the Eastern Orthodox Church and includes some food restrictions.

The &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; article on Paul of Tarsus states:
The article on the New Testament states:
The 18th-century rabbi Jacob Emden hypothesized that Jesus, and Paul after him, intended to convert the gentiles to the Seven Laws of Noah while calling on the Jews to keep the full Law of Moses.

<doc id="21911" wikidata="Q152311" url="?curid=21911" title="Naturism">
<text>Naturism is a lifestyle of practicing non-sexual social nudity in private and in public; the word also refers to the cultural movement which advocates and defends that lifestyle. Both may alternatively be called nudism. Though the two terms are broadly interchangeable, &quot;nudism&quot; emphasizes the practice of nudity, whilst &quot;naturism&quot; highlights an attitude favoring harmony with nature and respect for the environment, into which that practice is integrated. That said, naturists come from a range of philosophical and cultural backgrounds; there is no single naturist ideology.

Ethical or philosophical nudism has a long history, with many advocates of the benefits of enjoying nature without clothing. At the turn of the 20th century, organizations emerged to promote social nudity and to establish private campgrounds and resorts for that purpose. Since the 1960s, with the acceptance of public places for clothing-optional recreation, individuals who do not identify themselves as naturists or nudists have been able to casually participate in nude activities. Nude recreation opportunities vary widely around the world, from isolated places known mainly to locals through officially designated nude beaches and parks, and on to public spaces and buildings in some jurisdictions.

== Definition and lexicology ==
The XIV Congress of the International Naturist Federation (INF) held at Agde, France in 1974 defined naturism as:

Many contemporary naturists and naturist organisations advocate that the practice of social nudity should not be linked with sexual activity. Some recent studies show that naturism can help grow self-esteem, and thus have a positive impact on having a well-balanced sexuality, too. For various sociocultural and historical reasons, the lay public, the media, and many contemporary naturists and their organisations have, or present, a simplified view of the relationship between naturism and sexuality. , research has begun to explore this complex relationship.

The International Naturist Federation explains:

The usage and definition of these terms varies geographically and historically. Naturism and nudism have the same meaning in the United States, but there is a clear distinction between the two terms in Great Britain.

In naturist parlance, the terms &quot;&quot; or &quot;textilist&quot; refer to non-naturist persons, behaviours or facilities (e.g. &quot;the textile beach starts at the flag&quot;, &quot;they are a mixed couple – he is naturist, she is textile&quot;). &quot;Textile&quot; is the predominant term used in the UK (&quot;textilist&quot; is unknown in British naturist magazines, including &quot;H&amp;E naturist&quot;), but some naturists avoid using this term due to perceived negative or derogatory connotations. &quot;Textilist&quot; is said to be used interchangeably with &quot;textile&quot;, but no dictionary definition to this effect exists, nor are there any equivalent examples of use in mainstream literature such as those for &quot;textile&quot;.

== Naturist places and events ==
=== Naturist facilities ===

At naturist-organised events or venues, clothing is usually optional. At naturist swimming pools or sunbathing places, however, complete nudity is expected (weather permitting). This rule is sometimes a source of controversy among naturists. Staff at a naturist facility are usually required to be clothed due to health and safety regulations.

Facilities for naturists are classified in various ways. A landed or members&#x27; naturist club is one that owns its own facilities. Non-landed (or travel) clubs meet at various locations, such as private residences, swimming pools, hot springs, landed clubs and resorts, or rented facilities. Landed clubs can be run by members on democratic lines or by one or more owners who make the rules. In either case, they can determine membership criteria and the obligations of members. This usually involves sharing work necessary to maintain or develop the site.

The international naturist organizations were mainly composed of representatives of landed clubs. &quot;Nudist colony&quot; is no longer a favored term, but can be used by naturists to address landed clubs that have rigid non-inclusive membership criteria.

A holiday centre is a facility that specializes in providing apartments, chalets and camping pitches for visiting holidaymakers. A center is run commercially, and visitors are not members and have no say in the management. Most holiday centers expect visitors to hold an INF card (that is, to belong to an INF-affiliated organization), but some have relaxed this requirement, relying on the carrying of a trade card. Holiday centers vary in size. Larger holiday centres may have swimming pools, sports pitches, an entertainment program, kids&#x27; clubs, restaurants and supermarkets. Some holiday centres allow regular visitors to purchase their own chalets, and generations of the same families may visit each year. Holiday centres are more tolerant of clothing than members-only clubs; total nudity is usually compulsory in the swimming pools and may be expected on the beaches, while on the football pitches, or in the restaurants in the evening, it is rare.

A naturist resort is, to a European, a private property with accommodation and facilities where naturism is the norm. Centre Helio-Marin in Vendays Montalivet, France (the first naturist resort, established in 1950); the naturist village of Charco del Palo on Lanzarote, Canary Islands; Vera Playa in Spain; and Vritomartis Resort in Greece are examples.

In US usage, a naturist resort can mean a holiday centre. Freikörperkultur (FKK)—literally translated as &#x27;free body culture&#x27;—is the name for the general movement in Germany. The abbreviation is recognised outside of Germany and can be found on informal signs indicating the direction to a remote naturist beach.

=== Nude beaches ===


In some European countries, such as Denmark, all beaches are clothing optional, and in others like Germany (and experimentally in France) there are naturist sunbathing areas in public parks (e.g., in Munich and Berlin). Beaches in some holiday destinations, such as Crete, are clothing optional except some central urban beaches. There are two centrally located clothes-optional beaches in Barcelona. Sweden allows nudity on all beaches.

In a survey by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Germans and Austrians were most likely to have visited a nude beach (28%), followed by Norwegians (18%), Spaniards (17%), Australians (17%), and New Zealanders (16%). Of the nationalities surveyed, the Japanese (2%) were the least likely to have visited a nude beach. This result may indicate the lack of nude beaches in Japan; however, the Japanese are open with regard to family bathing nude at home and at onsens (hot springs).

=== Festival naturism ===
From Woodstock to Edinburgh, and Nambassa in the southern hemisphere, communal nudity can be seen at music and counterculture festivals.

The Nambassa hippie festivals held in New Zealand in the late 1970s were examples of non-sexual naturism. Of the 75,000 patrons who attended the 1979 Nambassa three-day festival, an estimated 35% of attendees spontaneously chose to remove their clothing, preferring complete or partial nudity.

Some nudist festivals are held to celebrate particular days of the year, and activities may include nude bodypainting. One example is the Neptune Day Festival held in Koktebel, Crimea to depict mythological events. Another is the Festival Nudista Zipolite organized by the Federación Nudista de México (Mexican Nudist Federation) held annually since 2016 on the first weekend of February.

A few camps organize activities in the nude, such as oil wrestling by camp Gymnasium.

===Summer naturism===

Naturism tends to be more common during the warmer summer months. 
Some regions host first-time naturists and people who have recently started to practice the naturist lifestyle.
One study noted that some of these people are seasonal naturists who wear clothes during other times of the year.

== History ==

Nudity in social contexts has been practised in various forms by many cultures and in all time periods. In modern Western society, social nudity is most frequently encountered in the contexts of bathing, swimming and using saunas, but throughout history and in many contemporary tropical cultures, nudity is a norm at many sports events and competitions.

The first known use of the word occurred in 1778. A French-speaking Belgian, Jean Baptiste Luc Planchon (1734–1781), used the term to advocate nudism as a means of improving the or healthy living.

The earliest known naturist club in the western sense of the word was established in British India in 1891. The Fellowship of the Naked Trust was founded by Charles Edward Gordon Crawford, a widower who was a District and Sessions Judge for the Bombay Civil Service. The commune was based in Matheran and had just three members at the beginning: Crawford and two sons of an Anglican missionary, Andrew and Kellogg Calderwood. The commune fell apart when Crawford was transferred to Ratnagiri; he died soon after in 1894.

In 1902, a series of philosophical papers was published in Germany by Dr. Heinrich Pudor under the pseudonym Heinrich Scham, who coined the term (Nude Culture). In 1906, he wrote a three-volume treatise with this term as its title, which discussed the benefits of nudity in co-education and advocated participating in sports while being free of cumbersome clothing. Richard Ungewitter (&quot;Nacktheit&quot;, 1906, &quot;Nackt&quot;, 1908, etc.) proposed that combining physical fitness, sunlight, and fresh-air bathing with the nudist philosophy contributed to mental and psychological fitness, good health, and an improved moral-life view. Major promoters of these ideas included Adolf Koch and , who was an instructor and manager at the German Army School of Military Physical Education in Wünsdorf. Germany published the first journal of nudism from 1902 to 1932, during which time it evolved and became known as &quot;Freikörperkultur&quot; (FKK), the free body culture movement.

The wide publication of those papers, and others, contributed to an explosive worldwide growth of nudism in which nudists participated in various social, recreational, and physical fitness activities in the nude. The first organized club for nudists on a large scale, (Open-Air Park), was opened near Hamburg in 1903 by Paul Zimmerman.
In 1919, German doctor Kurt Huldschinsky discovered that exposure to sunlight helped to cure rickets in many children, causing sunlight to be associated with improved health.

In France in the early 20th century, the brothers Gaston and André Durville, both physicians, studied the effects of psychology, nutrition, and environment on health and healing. They became convinced of the importance of natural foods and the natural environment on human well-being and health. They named this concept . The profound effect of clean air and sunlight on human bodies became evident to them and so nudity became a part of their naturism.

Naturism became a more widespread phenomenon in the 1920s in Germany, the United Kingdom, France and other European countries and spread to the United States, where it became established in the 1930s.

By 1951, the various national federations united to form the International Naturist Federation. Some naturists preferred not to join clubs, and after 1945, pressure arose to designate beaches for naturist use. From the middle of the 20th century, with changing leisure patterns, commercial organisations began opening holiday resorts to attract naturists who expected the same – or better – standards of comfort and amenity offered to non-naturists. More recently, naturist holiday options have expanded to include cruises.

In the early 21st century, many organised clubs saw a decline in attendance by young people, which worried many naturists about the future of the movement. The clubs&#x27; aging memberships may have put younger people off. A rise in social conservatism, re-asserting a nudity taboo, also may have contributed to the decline. However, since tolerance for nudity in general is increasing over time, and is higher among younger generations, an alternative hypothesis is that younger naturists no longer feel they need to join a club or visit a resort in order to practise naturism. Active recruitment of younger members is being pursued by some organisations. The phenomenon varies by country, with, for example, naturism in France experiencing steady growth in a younger demographic during the 2010s. A similar trend is seen in Germany, with young people eager to depart from social norms and beauty standards.

== Writers ==
Naturism was part of in the late 19th century (see the writings of André Gide) that also influenced the art movements of the time, specifically Henri Matisse and other Fauve painters. This movement was based on the French concept of &quot;joie de vivre&quot;, the idea of reveling freely in physical sensations and direct experiences and a spontaneous approach to life.

* Heinrich Pudor wrote on methods to improve social hygiene in his book (&#x27;Naked people and the rejoicing of the future&#x27;) and then (&#x27;Nude Culture&#x27;). It prescribes an austere lifestyle and nudity.
* Paul Zimmermann opened the Freilicht Park in Lübeck which was open to those who subscribed to principles.
* Richard Ungewitter wrote (&#x27;Nakedness&#x27;) which sold 90,000 copies, prescribed a similar Utopian lifestyle, where everyone would be nude, eat only vegetables and abstain from alcohol and tobacco. In his Utopia, everyone was to be Germanic with blue eyes and blonde hair.
* Adolf Koch, a left-wing primary-school teacher, sought to use social nudity to free the people from &quot;authority fixated conditioning which held proletarians in deference of their masters: parental authority, paternalism of the church, the mass media and organs of law and order.&quot; He used Organic-Rhythmic exercises in Berlin schools in the 1920s. In 1932 there were about 100,000 Germans involved with naturism, of which 70,000 were in Koch&#x27;s schools.
* taught nude gymnastics to soldiers for five years, and on being forced to leave the army, he wrote (in 1924) (&#x27;Man and the Sun&#x27;) which ran to 61 reprints.
* American writers Walt Whitman and Henry David Thoreau both wrote of nudity within the natural environment.

== Health ==
Naturist activities can have positive psychological benefits including greater life satisfaction, more positive body image, and higher self-esteem. Social nudity leads to acceptance in spite of differences in age, body shape, fitness, and health.

== Religion ==

Christian naturism includes various members associated with most denominations. Although beliefs vary, a common theme is that much of Christianity has misinterpreted the events regarding the Garden of Eden, and that God was displeased with Adam and Eve for covering their bodies with fig leaves.

== Controversy ==
Naturism is usually promoted as not being sexual, but there are resorts where social nudity is practised alongside exhibitionism, voyeurism, and other alternative lifestyles like swinging. Mainstream discourse around naturism sometimes conflates sexual and non-sexual variations, though family-oriented naturism organisations try to resist this stigma. Some naturist clubs have shifted to catering to swingers, and as a result may be expelled from mainstream naturist organizations, whilst some naturist villages, notably Cap d&#x27;Agde, have been successfully overtaken by swingers and &quot;libertines&quot;. Others struggle with wanting to maintain a family image while being lax in behavior enforcements for fear of losing revenue and no longer being financially viable. Attempts have been made to legislate naturist activity, such as children&#x27;s summer camps.

Many films and published materials in the middle decades of the 20th century were presented as documentaries of the naturist lifestyle. In fact this was largely a pretext to exploit a loophole in censorship laws restricting the exhibition of nudity. Additionally, child pornography has been distributed under the guise of naturist media. Precisely defining the distinction has proved challenging for law enforcers, as it depends on the subjective question of whether the purpose of the production is sexual. Court cases attempting to differentiate naturist publications from pornography reach back almost a century.

==Africa==

===South Africa===

Mpenjati beach in KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa has nude-beach status.

== Europe ==
In most European countries, nudity is not explicitly forbidden. Whether it is tolerated on beaches which are not marked as official nudist beaches varies greatly. The only country with substantially different laws is Denmark, where beach nudity is explicitly allowed on all beaches, except for two in the far west of the country.

=== Belgium ===
Organized naturism in Belgium began in 1924 when engineer Joseph-Paul Swenne founded the Belgian League of Heliophilous Propaganda (usually abbreviated to ) in Uccle. This was followed four years later by , founded by Jozef Geertz and hosted on the country estate of entrepreneur Oswald Johan de Schampelaere. Belgian naturism was influenced in equal part by French naturism and German . Belgian naturists are represented by the (FBN).

=== Croatia ===
Croatia is world-famous for naturism, which accounts for about 15% of its tourism industry. It was also the first European country to develop commercial naturist resorts. During a 1936 Adriatic cruise, King Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson stopped at a beach on the island of Rab where King Edward obtained special permission from the local government to swim naked, this event marked the beginning of nudist tourism in Croatia.

=== Finland ===

In Finnish culture, nudism is considered to be a relatively normal way to live. It is not uncommon to see entire families spending time together naked. Families may be naked while bathing, in a sauna, swimming in a pool, or playing on a beach, and it is not unusual to see children playing naked in a family yard for example. Nudity as a whole is considered less taboo than in many other countries.

=== France ===

Marcel Kienné de Mongeot is credited with starting naturism in France in 1920. His family had suffered from tuberculosis, and he saw naturism as a cure and a continuation of the traditions of the ancient Greeks. In 1926, he started the magazine (later titled ) and the first French naturist club, , at Garambouville, near Évreux. The court action that he initiated established that nudism was legal on private property that was fenced and screened.

Drs. André and Gaston Durville bought on the Île du Levant where they established the village of Héliopolis, which was open to the public. In 1925, Dr. François Fougerat de David de Lastours wrote a thesis on heliotherapy, and in that year, he opened the . In 1936, the naturist movement was officially recognised.

Albert and Christine Lecocq were active members of many of these clubs, but they left after disagreements, and in 1944, they founded the with members in 84 cities. Four years later, they founded the (FFN); in 1949, they started the magazine , and in 1950, they opened the CHM Montalivet, the world&#x27;s first naturist holiday centre, where the INF was formed.

Henri Zisly was another prominent figure and primitivist in the French naturism movement who wrote on a return to lifestyles based on self-sufficiency.

=== Germany ===

German naturism (, FKK) was part of the movement and the youth movement of 1896, from Steglitz, Berlin, which promoted ideas of fitness and vigour. At the same time, doctors of the (Natural Healing Movement) were using heliotherapy, treating diseases such as tuberculosis, rheumatism, and scrofula with exposure to sunlight.

, a term coined in 1903 by Heinrich Pudor, connected nudity, vegetarianism and social reform, and was practised in a network of 200 members clubs. The movement gained prominence in the 1920s by offering a health-giving lifestyle with Utopian ideals. Germany published the first naturist journal from 1902 to 1932, but it became politicised by radical socialists who believed it would lead to classlessness and a breakdown of society. It eventually became associated with pacificism.

In 1926, Adolf Koch established a school of naturism in Berlin, encouraging a mixing of the sexes, open air exercises, and a programme of &quot;sexual hygiene&quot;. In 1929 the Berlin school hosted the first International Congress on Nudity.

After World War II, East Germans were free to practice naturism, chiefly at beaches rather than clubs (private organizations were regarded as potentially subversive). Naturism became a large element in DDR politics. The subsection of the Workers Sports Organisation had 60,000 members. Since reunification there are many clubs, parks and beaches open to naturists, though nudity has become less common in the former eastern zone. Germans are typically the most commonly seen visitors at nude beaches in France and around Europe.

=== Greece ===
There are no official nude beaches, however there are unofficial nude beaches on the islands frequented by tourists, like Crete, Mykonos or Karpathos, and on smaller islands like Skopelos or Skiathos where nudity is tolerated, usually at the more remote ends or secluded areas of beaches.

Toplessness also is widely practiced by locals and tourists alike as there are no cultural taboos against it.

In 2015, a court in Thessaloniki, Greece&#x27;s second largest city, acquitted nudist activists who were charged for wandering naked in the city as part of their activist actions for promoting the urban nudism. In its ruling, the court deemed these acts to be &quot;not lewd or lascivious&quot;, and vindicated the activists, thus recognizing their right to be naked publicly.

=== Italy ===
Full nudity is allowed in Italy in the official naturist beaches and places of the country, and in many other places where there is an established tradition of naturist attendance, as confirmed by a recent absolution sentence. In all other public places, full nudity is generally prohibited by civil law and could be punished with fines that have been recently reduced (minimum €51 to maximum €309).
In the last decades, six regions have created laws to promote naturist tourism, and actually there are more than 20 official naturist beaches in Italy, where naturism is recognised and guaranteed by administrative acts, and more than 30 beaches with a long tradition of naturist attendance where nudity is accepted. Naturist accommodations are located in most of the regions and it is estimated that the number of nudists and naturists in Italy is about 500,000 people. Since the 1960s, there have been naturist associations in many regions, and a naturist federation on a national level.

Female toplessness is allowed, in a nonsexual context, in all the beaches of the country. On March 20, 2000, the Supreme Court of Cassation through sentence No. 3557 has determined that the exposure of the nude female breast since some decades is considered a &quot;commonly accepted behavior&quot; and therefore has &quot;entered into the social custom&quot;. Since then, local government regulations forbidding toplessness are extremely rare.

=== Netherlands ===
The oldest Dutch naturist association is (&#x27;Sun and Life&#x27;), founded in 1946 with the aim of promoting healthy physical and mental development and a natural way of life. The national association is (NFN), which in 2017 adopted the name (&#x27;Simply Naked&#x27;) in an effort to become more accessible to casual naturists and strengthen the acceptance of nude recreation.

In general, Dutch people are very tolerant of beach nudity, as long as it does not impact others, or involve inappropriate staring or sexual behaviour. Topless sunbathing is permitted on most beaches except where prohibited by signage.

=== Portugal ===

The (Portuguese Naturist Federation) or FPN was founded on 1 March 1977 in Lisbon. In the 21st century, naturism is considered a tolerated practice, whereas there are many officially designated nudist beaches.

=== Poland ===
In modern-day Poland, naturism is practiced in number of the seaside and inland beaches. Most Polish beaches of this type are actually clothing-optional rather than naturist. One such beach is Międzyzdroje-Lubiewo.

=== Spain ===

Public nudity in Spain is not illegal since there is no law banning its practice. Spanish legislation foresees felony for exhibitionism but restricts its scope to obscene exposure in front of children or mentally impaired individuals, i.e. with sexual connotation. There are, however, some municipalities (like San Pedro del Pinatar) where public nudity has been banned by means of by-laws. Other municipalities (like Barcelona, Salou, Platja de Palma and Sant Antoni de Portmany) have used similar provisions to regulate partial nudity, requiring people to cover their torsos on the streets. Some naturist associations have appealed these by-laws on the grounds that a fundamental right (freedom of expression, as they understand nudism to be self-expression) cannot be regulated with such a mechanism. Some courts have ruled in favour of nudist associations. Nudism in Spain is normally practised by the seaside, on beaches or small coves with a tradition of naturism. In Vera, Spain, there is a wide residential area formed by nudist urbanisations. Nudist organisations may organise some activities elsewhere in inner territory.

Research was done on the island of Menorca, where naturism is practiced at small, isolated beaches apart from the island&#x27;s developed resorts. Not everyone on these beaches, even within a group, is nude, and both types of participants were interviewed. Most were white heterosexuals between the ages of 25 and 40 who live in cities such as Madrid or Barcelona. For them, being nude on a beach is about bodily sensations of sun, sea, and sand directly on the skin, not about cultural meanings or performance of bodily appearance. The behaviors that support the non-sexual definition of the situation work by downplaying the visual, most of all by not staring at others. It is also unacceptable for a person to actively seek the gaze of others. Naturists may see the decision not to be nude is holding on to the visual, and non-naturists may see beach nudity as a form of exhibitionism.

Legal provisions regarding partial nudity (or toplessness) are analogous to those regarding full nudity, but social tolerance towards toplessness is higher. The law does not require women to cover their breasts in public swimming, or on any beach in Spain. The governments of the municipalities of Galdakao and L&#x27;Ametlla del Vallès legalized female toplessness on their public pools in March 2016 and June 2018, respectively.

Naturists were a prominent affinity group among Spanish anarcho-syndicalists.

=== United Kingdom ===

In the United Kingdom, the first official nudist club was established in Wickford, Essex, in 1924. According to Michael Farrar, writing for British Naturism, the club adopted the name &quot;Moonella Group&quot; from the name of the owner of the ground and called its site The Camp. Moonella, who was still living in 1965 but whose identity remains to be discovered, had inherited a house with land in 1923 and made it available to certain members of the New Gymnosophy Society. This society was founded a few years before by H.C. Booth, M.H. Sorensen and Rex Wellbye under the name of the English Gymnosophical Society. It met for discussions at the Minerva Cafe at 144 High Holborn in London, the headquarters of the Women&#x27;s Freedom League. Those who were permitted to join the Moonella Group were carefully selected, and the club was run by a leadership of the original members, all of whom had club names to preserve their anonymity. The club closed in 1926 because of construction on adjacent land.

By 1943, there were a number of &quot;sun clubs&quot;, and together they formed the British Sun Bathers Association, or BSBA. In 1954, a group of clubs unhappy with the way the BSBA was being run, split to form the Federation of British Sun Clubs, or FBSC. In 1961, the BSBA Annual Conference agreed that the term nudist was inappropriate and should be discarded in favour of naturist. The two organisations rivalled each other before eventually coming together again in 1964 as the Central Council for British Naturism, or CCBN. This organisational structure has remained much the same but it is called British Naturism or BN.

The first official nude beach was opened at Fairlight Glen in Covehurst Bay near Hastings in 1978 (not to be confused with Fairlight Cove, which is to the east), followed later by the beaches at Brighton and Fraisthorpe. Bridlington opened in April 1980.

== Oceania ==
===Australia===

Australia&#x27;s first naturist club was founded in Sydney in 1931 by the French-born anarchist and pacifist Kleber Claux. In 1975, the southern half of Maslin Beach, south of Adelaide, was declared Australia&#x27;s first official nude beach. The beach is almost long, so the area reserved for nude bathing is away from other beach users.

=== New Zealand ===

Nudist clubs (called &quot;sun clubs&quot;) were established in Dunedin and Auckland in early 1938; the Auckland Sun Group went into recess shortly afterwards due to the outbreak of World War II. In 1958 the allied nudist clubs of New Zealand established the New Zealand Sunbathing Association, later renamed the New Zealand Naturist Federation. The Federation includes 17 affiliated clubs with a total membership (in 2012) of 1,600 people. In 2016 the Federation, in conjunction with Tourism New Zealand, hosted the World Congress of the International Naturist Federation at the Wellington Naturist Club, marking the second time the Congress had ever been held in the Southern Hemisphere.

Outside formal naturist organizations, social nudity is practised in a variety of contexts in New Zealand culture. It is a feature of many summer music festivals, including Convergence, Kiwiburn, Luminate, Rhythm &amp; Vines, and Splore, in a tradition going back to Nambassa in the late 1970s. It is also associated with the culture of rugby, most prominently in the nude rugby match held in Dunedin each winter from 2002 to 2014 (and sporadically thereafter) as pre-match entertainment for the first professional rugby game of the season, and in the mock public holiday &quot;National Nude Day&quot;, an event in which viewers of the talk show &quot;SportsCafe&quot; were invited – chiefly by former rugby player Marc Ellis, the show&#x27;s most irrepressibly comic presenter – to send in photos and video of themselves performing daily activities in the nude.

While a large proportion of New Zealanders are tolerant of nudity, especially on beaches, there remains a contingent who consider it obscene. Naturists who engage in casual public nudity, even in places where this is lawful, risk being reported to police by disapproving people. Legally, nudity is permissible on any beach where it is &quot;known to occur&quot;, in consequence of which New Zealand has no official nude beaches. The indecent exposure provision of the Summary Offences Act is, in practice, reserved for cases of public sexual gratification, but public nudity may still be prosecuted under the &quot;offensive behaviour&quot; provision.

== North America ==
=== Canada ===

In Canada, individuals around the country became interested in nudism, skinny-dipping, and physical culture in the early part of the 20th century. &quot;Sunbathing &amp; Health&quot;, a magazine targeted toward Canadian naturists and which occasionally carried local news, began publication after 1940. There were scattered groups of naturists in several cities during the 1930s and 1940s, and some of these groups attracted enough interest to form clubs on private land. The most significant clubs were the Van Tan Club, formed in 1939, which is still operating in North Vancouver, BC, and the Sun Air Club, in Ontario.

Canadians who served in the military during the Second World War met like-minded souls from across the country, and often visited clubs while in Europe. They were a ready pool of recruits for post-war organizers. A few years later, the wave of post-war immigration brought many Europeans with their own extensive experience, and they not only swelled the ranks of membership, but often formed their own clubs, helping to expand nudism from coast to coast.

Most clubs eventually united in the Canadian Sunbathing Association, which affiliated with the American Sunbathing Association in 1954. Several disagreements between eastern and western members of the CSA resulted in its division into the Western Canadian Sunbathing Association (WCSA) and the Eastern Canadian Sunbathing Association (ECSA) in 1960. The ECSA endured much in-fighting over the next fifteen years, which led to its official demise in 1978. The WCSA changed its name to the American Association for Nude Recreation – Western Canadian Region, a region of the American Association for Nude Recreation (AANR), which itself was formerly known as the ASA.

In 1977 the (FQN) was founded in Quebec by Michel Vaïs, who had experienced European naturism at Montalivet. In 1985 the Federation of Canadian Naturists (FCN) was formed with the support of the FQN. In 1988 the FQN and FCN formed the FQN-FCN Union as the official Canadian representative in the International Naturist Federation.

=== Cuba ===

Naturism was a major component of the Cuban anarchist movement, alongside anarchist communism and anarcho-syndicalism, as an alternative health and lifestyle movement. Adrián del Valle in particular advocated for the emancipatory&quot; function of naturism in a society.

=== Mexico ===

Federación Nudista de México is a members organization with both individual and organization members. It promotes social nudity in Mexico, and it is recognized by the International Naturist Federation as the official national naturist organization in that country.

, Playa Zipolite is Mexico&#x27;s first and only legal public nude beach. A free beach and unofficially nudist for more than 50 years, this beach is reputed to be the best place for nudism in the country. The numerous nude sunbathers, and the long tradition, make it safe for nudism and naturism. Annually since 2016, on the first weekend of February, Zipolite has hosted Festival Nudista Zipolite that in 2019 attracted 7,000–8,000 visitors.

=== United States ===


Kurt Barthel founded the American League for Physical Culture in 1929 and organized the first nudist event. In about 1930 they organized the American Gymnosophical Association. Barthel founded America&#x27;s first official nudist camp, Sky Farm in New Jersey, in May, 1932. Around 1932, the AGA established the Rock Lodge Club as a nudist facility in Stockholm, New Jersey and Ilsley Boone, a Dutch Reformed minister, formed the Christian naturism movement. Naturism began to expand nationwide. Nudism venues were alcohol-free until 1970.

The American Association for Nude Recreation (AANR) is the national naturist organization. Arnd Krüger compared nudists in Germany and the United States and came to the conclusion that in Germany the racial aspects () were important for the breakthrough (e.g. the Commanding General of the Army served as patron for nudists events), while in the U.S. nudism was far more commercial and had thus more difficulties.

In 2008, Florida Young Naturists held its first Naked Bash, which has been repeated multiple times per year and has grown into one of the larger young naturist gatherings in the world.

In 2009, a campaign to promote nudism in the United States occurred with an effort by the AANR to record the largest simultaneous skinny dip at several U.S. clubs and beaches, which occurred on July 11 of that year.

In 2010, an organization formed called Young Naturists America, which was mostly focused on the younger generation, as well as social issues, such as body image. Young Naturists and Nudists America closed in 2017.

== Asia ==

=== Indonesia ===
In the 1970s, nudity on Bali&#x27;s remote and deserted beaches was common, but with the massive growth of tourism this practice has disappeared. In 2002, nudity was declared illegal on Petitenget Beach, the last beach in Seminyak that tolerated discreet nudity. Individuals began to practice nudity in private villas and resorts. Laki Uma Villa, the first naturist facility to open, was for gay men only. Bali au Naturel, the first adult-only nudist resort for both genders, opened its doors in 2004. It subsequently expanded from 3 to 15 rooms and added two more swimming pools.

Indonesia has an underground naturist community who defy the laws against public nudity.

=== Thailand ===
Nudism was introduced in 2012 by The Thailand Naturist Association in Pattaya (Chan Resort), and five more nudist resorts have been created across Thailand: Barefeet Resort in Bangkok, Lemon Tree Resort in Phuket City, Oriental Village in Chiangmai, Phuan Naturist Village in Pattaya, and Peace Blue Naturist Resort in Phuket.

Since 2020 during the worldwide pandemic, Lemon Tree Resort in Phuket, Oriental Village in Chiangmai, and Phuan Naturist Village in Pattaya have closed.

Dragonfly Naturist Village in Pattaya (a member of American Association for Nude Recreation) has opened and expanded its property as the largest naturist resort in Thailand.

== South America ==
=== Argentina ===

Naturism is allowed in the official nude beaches of Puerto Escondido, located near Miramar, and Playa Querandí, located in Villa Gesell. Total nudity is permitted in some private naturist resorts.

=== Brazil ===
In general, public nudity tends to be condemned by the Brazilian authorities, which commonly see it as indecent exposure. However, the country has the highest number of official nude beaches in Latin America, being eight in total, and this number partially is explained by the fact that the Brazilian territory has more than of ocean coast. Moreover, there are a few private naturist clubs throughout the country where full nudity is accepted as well. Naturism in Brazil is regulated by the Brazilian Naturism Federation (in Portuguese: &quot;Federação Brasileira de Naturismo&quot;, abbreviated as &quot;FBrN&quot;).

=== Chile ===
The first nude beach in the country, called Playa Luna, was legalized in 2000, and there are unofficial restricted areas that were created in Playa Luna Norte (Tarapacá), Playa Luna Sur (Coliumo), Playa Escondida (Antofagasta), Playa Blanca (Tongoy) and Pichilemu.

=== Uruguay ===

There are two official nude beaches where the practice of naturism is allowed: Chihuahua, located in the resort of the same name, and La Sirena, located in the resort of Aguas Dulces.

== Naturist media ==
=== Magazines ===

Magazines published by, for or purportedly about naturists can be grouped into the following:

* Magazines published by an &quot;official&quot; national organisation, such as &quot;BN&quot; (British Naturism), &quot;Going Natural/Au naturel&quot; (FCN/FQN), &quot;Nude &amp; Natural Magazine&quot; (The Naturist Society), &quot;gonatural&quot; (New Zealand Naturist Federation).
* Independent magazines published for naturists, such as &quot;Naturally&quot;, &quot;H&amp;E naturist&quot; and &quot;TAN&quot; (acronym of &quot;The Australian Naturist&quot;).
* Magazines that print photographs only or primarily of young female professional models. These types of publications are disapproved of by many naturists and non-naturists alike.

Magazines in the second and, occasionally, third groups feature naturist editorial and advertising. While some naturists argue over which magazines belong in which of these categories, these views may change as publishers and editors change. Many clubs and groups have benefited from magazines which, while not exclusively or even predominantly naturist in character, made naturist information available to many who would not otherwise have been aware of it. The information and advertising provided online, along with the wide availability of free online pornography, has meant the disappearance of old-style &quot;skin&quot; magazines presenting significant glamour content masquerading as, or alongside, naturist content. Naturist magazines have to appeal strongly to naturists to succeed; they cannot sit on the fence between naturism and glamour. Some naturists feel that the worthwhile editorial content in some magazines is not a fair balance for the disapproved-of photographic content.

=== Photography, films and videos ===

Although photographing others when they are nude in a public place may not violate their rights to privacy, individuals retain the personality rights to their own image in many countries. If so, recognizable photographs of any person cannot be published without permission.

Some naturist clubs have been willing to allow filming by the media on their grounds, though content that proved not to be of genuine naturism can end up being parodied by the media.

Some commercial &#x27;naturist&#x27; DVDs are dominated by imagery of naked children. Such material can be marketed in ways that appear to appeal directly to pedophile inclinations, and ownership of these DVDs (and their earlier video cassette incarnations) has resulted in successful British prosecutions for possession of indecent images of children. One case was appealed, unsuccessfully, to the European Court of Human Rights.

Photo shoots, including major high-profile works by Spencer Tunick, are done in public places including beaches.

<text>Nordea Bank Abp, commonly referred to as Nordea, is a Nordic financial services group operating in northern Europe with headquarters in Helsinki, Finland. The name is a blend of the words &quot;Nordic&quot; and &quot;idea&quot;. The bank is the result of the successive mergers and acquisitions of the Finnish, Swedish, Danish, and Norwegian banks of Merita Bank, Nordbanken, Unidanmark, and Christiania Bank og Kreditkasse that took place between 1997 and 2001. The Nordic countries are considered Nordea&#x27;s home market, having finalised the sales of their Polish bank in 2014, Baltic operations in 2019 and completed the exit from Russia in early 2022 following a 2019 decision to close the business there. Nordea is listed on Nasdaq Nordic exchanges in Helsinki, Copenhagen, and Stockholm and Nordea ADR is listed in the US.

Nordea serves 9.3 million private and 530,000 active corporate customers, including 2,650 large corporates and institutions. Nordea&#x27;s credit portfolio is distributed across Finland (21%), Denmark (26%), Norway (21%), and Sweden (30%). There are four Business Areas (BAs) at Nordea, Personal Banking, Business Banking, Large Corporates &amp; Institutions, and Asset &amp; Wealth Management. Assets under Management (AUM) were €411 billion in December 2021.

Nordea has been designated as a Significant Institution since the entry into force of European Banking Supervision in late 2014, first as the Finnish arm of the Stockholm-based group and since 2017 as a financial holding company. As a consequence, it is directly supervised by the European Central Bank.

The company has been embroiled in numerous scandals involving moneylaundering and tax evasion. In 2024, Danish authorities indicted the bank for the most extensive violation by a bank of Denmark’s anti-money laundering act in the country&#x27;s history.

==History==
Nordea&#x27;s roots date to 1820 and Sparekassen for Kjøbenhavn og Omegn in Denmark, and a complete family tree of around 300 banks including some of the oldest banks in the Nordic region. This includes Wermlandsbanken of Sweden (founded 1832), Christiania Kreditkasse of Norway (founded 1848) and Union Bank of Finland (UBF) of Finland (founded 1862). Between 1997 and 2001, the Finnish, Swedish, Danish, and Norwegian banks of Merita Bank, Nordbanken, Unidanmark, and Christiania Bank og Kreditkasse merged into the present day Nordea.

Merita Group was formed in 1995, when UBF and Kansallis-Osake-Pankki (KOP) merged. UBF was established, in 1862, at a time when there were no Limited Liability Companies Act or banking laws in Finland. Therefore, it was modelled after banking standards in other countries. UBF eventually merged with rivals Nordiska Aktiebanken in 1919 and Helsingin Osakepankki (HOP) in 1986. KOP was originally founded in 1890 with its first branch at Aleksanterinkatu 17, in Helsinki. By 1913, KOP had become the second largest commercial bank in Finland. The two banks, KOP and UBF, competed for the title of the largest bank in Finland for decades. KOP suffered large credit losses as a result of the Finnish banking crisis in the early 1990s. On 1 April 1995 it became a subsidiary (51%) of Merita Group in a direct share issue.

Nordbanken was formed in 1986 by a merger of two smaller private local banks, Uplandsbanken and Sundsvallsbanken, though it was the product of numerous original institutions. The oldest of the original Nordbanken constituent banks was Wermlandsbanken, which was founded in 1832. Nordbanken came under Swedish government control in 1992, following the Swedish banking crisis in the early 1990s, with the sale of its non-performing loans to the Swedish government and significant reduction in personnel. Bad debts were transferred to the asset-management company Securum, which sold off the assets. At the time, the approach of establishing &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; banks composed of corresponding assets was a novel resolution approach.

Merita Group merged with Nordbanken in 1997 forming MeritaNordbanken. The Solo internet-based banking operation of MeritaNordbanken was a global pioneer and leader providing mobile and internet banking access in 1999. The bank reached 1 million internet banking customers during 1999 with 3 million log-ins and 3.7 million payments per month. Housing loans via Solo were introduced in 1999. MeritaNordbanken agreed to buy Unidanmark, Denmark&#x27;s second-largest bank, in early 2000 creating the Nordic region&#x27;s biggest financial institution with €186 billion in assets. The merged group had a banking market share of 20% in Sweden, 25% in Denmark and 40% in Finland and a combined workforce of 28,050. By end 2000, MeritaNordbanken had further merged with Christiania Bank og Kreditkasse of Norway, a process started in 1999 and changed its name to Nordea. Christiania Bank had also been impacted severely during the banking crisis in the early 1990s, with Nordea acquiring the bank from the Norwegian Government Bank Investment Fund with a 35% share.

Nordea expanded into Poland, the Baltics and Russia in the early 2000s, with 2% of total revenues from the Poland and Baltics region. Nordea divested its Polish banking operations in 2013, with the sale to PKO Bank Polski for €694 million but retains a presence in Poland via operations and IT units supporting the Nordic banks. By end 2014, lending in the Baltics was €8.2 billion and in Russia €4.5 billion. During the period 2013-2017 exposure to the Russian market was reduced by 63%. In 2016, Luminor was formed by a merger of Nordea&#x27;s and DNB&#x27;s operations in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania creating the third largest Baltic regional bank with assets of €15 billion and a market share of 16.4%. Luminor was sold to Blackstone, with Nordea and DNB retaining each initially a 20% share. However, the full divestment was completed in 2019. Exit from the Russian, Baltic and Polish markets were part of Nordea&#x27;s de-risking strategy, which also included reduced exposures to some sectors (e.g. Shipping, Oil &amp; Offshore and Agriculture in Denmark). Nordea was one of the Nordic banks, including Danske Bank, SEB and Swedbank, allegedly involved in the money laundering scandal, involving ex-Soviet states, that emerged in 2017.

Nordea announced plans to move its corporate headquarters from Stockholm, Sweden to Helsinki, Finland in September 2017. The re-domiciliation of Nordea to Finland put it within the supervision of the European Central Bank and within the European Union&#x27;s banking union. In October 2018, Nordea completed the move of its corporate headquarters to Helsinki, Finland. 
==Performance and ownership==
Nordea’s market capitalisation was €39.6 billion at the end of 2023, making it the fifth largest company in the Nordic region and among the ten largest European financial services groups. Between 2000 – when Nordea was formed by the merger of MeritaNordbanken and Unidanmark – and 2023, the share price of Nordea appreciated by 177%, outperforming the STOXX Europe 600 Banks Index (-50%).

At the end of 2023, Nordea had more than 590,000 shareholders. Nordea’s 10 largest shareholders were:

# BlackRock, 5.1%
# Cevian Capital, 4.5%
# Norges Bank, 4.4%
# Nordea-fonden, 4.4%
# The Vanguard Group, 3.7%
# Swedbank Robur Funds, 2.5%
# Alecta Tjänstepension, 2.2%
# Fidelity_Investments, 1.5%
# Nordea Funds, 1.4%

There are four Business Areas (BAs) at Nordea, Personal Banking, Business Banking, Large Corporates &amp; Institutions, and Asset &amp; Wealth Management.

== Scandals ==
Nordea was the subject of an online phishing scam in 2007. The company estimated 8 million kr ($1.1 million) was stolen. Customers were targeted over a period of 15 months with phishing emails containing a trojan horse. Nordea refunded affected customers.

The largest financial group in the Nordic region, Nordea was, despite warnings from the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (FI) active in using offshore companies in tax havens according to the Panama papers. Other Swedish banks were mentioned in the documents, but mention of Nordea occurred 10,902 times and the second-most mentioned bank has 764 matches. In 2012, Nordea asked Mossack Fonseca to change documents retroactively so that three Danish customers power of attorney documents had been in force since 2010. Nordea bank loaned billions of euros to shipping companies that own vessels in secrecy jurisdictions such as Bermuda, Cyprus, Panama, BVI, the Cayman Islands and the Isle of Man. In the Paradise Papers, Nordea was shown to have lent a significant amount of money to customers based in tax havens. As a consequence of the leaked documents, the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (FI) stated on 4 April 2016 that it had started an investigation into the conduct of Nordea.

The Nordea section in Luxembourg, between the years 2004 and 2014, founded nearly 400 offshore companies in Panama and the British Virgin Islands for its customers. The Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (FI) pointed out that there are &quot;serious deficiencies&quot; in how Nordea monitors money laundering, and gave the bank two warnings. In 2015, Nordea paid the largest possible fine - over 5 million EUR. Stefan Löfven, Prime Minister of Sweden, said in 2016 that he was very critical of the conduct of Nordea and its role, and said: &quot;They are on the list of shame too&quot;. The Swedish minister of Finance Magdalena Andersson characterized the conduct of Nordea as &quot;a crime&quot; and &quot;totally unacceptable&quot;. The director for Nordea Private banking Thorben Sanders admits that before 2009 they did not screen for customers that tried to evade tax. &quot;At the end of 2009 we decided that our bank should not be a means of tax evasion&quot; says Thorben Sanders. Nordea CEO Casper von Koskull stated that he was disappointed with the shortcomings within Nordea&#x27;s operating principles, saying that &quot;this cannot be tolerated&quot;.

In 2013, &quot;Politiken&quot;, a Danish newspaper, revealed that Nordea&#x27;s Copenhagen branch was instrumental in establishing approximately 100 offshore companies for Russian and other nationals, despite warnings about suspicious activities. In 2024, the Danish authorities indicted Nordea for violating anti-money laundering laws by allowing $3.7 billion of suspicious transactions by the Russian clients. According to the Danish authorities, it was most extensive moneylaundering ever committed by a financial company in the country.

In March 2019, public service broadcasting company, Yle, aired a program that revealed money laundering allegations against Nordea. The company was the biggest Nordic lender allegedly involved in the multi-million-dollar money laundering scheme, according to Bloomberg.

In July 2024, Nordea Bank was taken to court in Denmark over allegations of failing to prevent money laundering linked to Russian clients. The charges stem from transactions worth €3.8 billion, where Nordea is accused of neglecting proper oversight and ignoring red flags. Despite setting aside €95 million for potential fines, the actual penalty could be significantly higher, possibly approaching $1 billion.

In August 2024, Nordea agreed to pay $35 million to settle a money-laundering investigation by the New York State Department of Financial Services, linked to the Panama Papers scandal. The probe revealed the bank&#x27;s failure to prevent illegal activities, including inadequate screening of clients from 2008 to 2019.

<doc id="21918" wikidata="Q743179" url="?curid=21918" title="Normal subgroup">
<text>In abstract algebra, a normal subgroup (also known as an invariant subgroup or self-conjugate subgroup) is a subgroup that is invariant under conjugation by members of the group of which it is a part. In other words, a subgroup formula_1 of the group formula_2 is normal in formula_2 if and only if formula_4 for all formula_5 and formula_6. The usual notation for this relation is formula_7.

Normal subgroups are important because they (and only they) can be used to construct quotient groups of the given group. Furthermore, the normal subgroups of formula_2 are precisely the kernels of group homomorphisms with domain formula_2, which means that they can be used to internally classify those homomorphisms.

Évariste Galois was the first to realize the importance of the existence of normal subgroups.

== Definitions ==
A subgroup formula_1 of a group formula_2 is called a normal subgroup of formula_2 if it is invariant under conjugation; that is, the conjugation of an element of formula_1 by an element of formula_2 is always in formula_1. The usual notation for this relation is formula_7.

===Equivalent conditions===
For any subgroup formula_1 of formula_2, the following conditions are equivalent to formula_1 being a normal subgroup of formula_2. Therefore, any one of them may be taken as the definition.

* The image of conjugation of formula_1 by any element of formula_2 is a subset of formula_1, i.e., formula_24 for all formula_25.
* The image of conjugation of formula_1 by any element of formula_2 is equal to formula_28 i.e., formula_29 for all formula_25.
* For all formula_5, the left and right cosets formula_32 and formula_33 are equal.
* The sets of left and right cosets of formula_1 in formula_2 coincide.
* Multiplication in formula_2 preserves the equivalence relation &quot;is in the same left coset as&quot;. That is, for every formula_37 satisfying formula_38 and formula_39, we have formula_40.
* There exists a group on the set of left cosets of formula_1 where multiplication of any two left cosets formula_32 and formula_43 yields the left coset formula_44 (this group is called the &quot;quotient group&quot; of formula_2 &quot;modulo&quot; formula_1, denoted formula_47).
* formula_1 is a union of conjugacy classes of formula_2.
* formula_1 is preserved by the inner automorphisms of formula_2.
* There is some group homomorphism formula_52 whose kernel is formula_1.
* There exists a group homomorphism formula_54 whose fibers form a group where the identity element is formula_1 and multiplication of any two fibers formula_56 and formula_57 yields the fiber formula_58 (this group is the same group formula_47 mentioned above).
* There is some congruence relation on formula_2 for which the equivalence class of the identity element is formula_1.
* For all formula_62 and formula_25. the commutator formula_64 is in formula_1.
* Any two elements commute modulo the normal subgroup membership relation. That is, for all formula_66, formula_67 if and only if formula_68.

== Examples ==
For any group formula_2, the trivial subgroup formula_70 consisting of only the identity element of formula_2 is always a normal subgroup of formula_2. Likewise, formula_2 itself is always a normal subgroup of formula_2 (if these are the only normal subgroups, then formula_2 is said to be simple). Other named normal subgroups of an arbitrary group include the center of the group (the set of elements that commute with all other elements) and the commutator subgroup formula_76. More generally, since conjugation is an isomorphism, any characteristic subgroup is a normal subgroup.

If formula_2 is an abelian group then every subgroup formula_1 of formula_2 is normal, because formula_80. More generally, for any group formula_2, every subgroup of the &quot;center&quot; formula_82 of formula_2 is normal in formula_2 (in the special case that formula_2 is abelian, the center is all of formula_2, hence the fact that all subgroups of an abelian group are normal). A group that is not abelian but for which every subgroup is normal is called a Hamiltonian group.

A concrete example of a normal subgroup is the subgroup formula_87 of the symmetric group formula_88, consisting of the identity and both three-cycles. In particular, one can check that every coset of formula_1 is either equal to formula_1 itself or is equal to formula_91. On the other hand, the subgroup formula_92 is not normal in formula_88 since formula_94. This illustrates the general fact that any subgroup formula_95 of index two is normal.

As an example of a normal subgroup within a matrix group, consider the general linear group formula_96 of all invertible formula_97 matrices with real entries under the operation of matrix multiplication and its subgroup formula_98 of all formula_97 matrices of determinant 1 (the special linear group). To see why the subgroup formula_98 is normal in formula_96, consider any matrix formula_102 in formula_98 and any invertible matrix formula_104. Then using the two important identities formula_105 and formula_106, one has that formula_107, and so formula_108 as well. This means formula_98 is closed under conjugation in formula_96, so it is a normal subgroup.

In the Rubik&#x27;s Cube group, the subgroups consisting of operations which only affect the orientations of either the corner pieces or the edge pieces are normal.

The translation group is a normal subgroup of the Euclidean group in any dimension. This means: applying a rigid transformation, followed by a translation and then the inverse rigid transformation, has the same effect as a single translation. By contrast, the subgroup of all rotations about the origin is &quot;not&quot; a normal subgroup of the Euclidean group, as long as the dimension is at least 2: first translating, then rotating about the origin, and then translating back will typically not fix the origin and will therefore not have the same effect as a single rotation about the origin.

== Properties ==

* If formula_111 is a normal subgroup of formula_2, and formula_113 is a subgroup of formula_2 containing formula_111, then formula_111 is a normal subgroup of formula_113.
* A normal subgroup of a normal subgroup of a group need not be normal in the group. That is, normality is not a transitive relation. The smallest group exhibiting this phenomenon is the dihedral group of order 8. However, a characteristic subgroup of a normal subgroup is normal. A group in which normality is transitive is called a T-group.
* The two groups formula_2 and formula_111 are normal subgroups of their direct product formula_120.
* If the group formula_2 is a semidirect product formula_122, then formula_1 is normal in formula_2, though formula_111 need not be normal in formula_2.
* If formula_127 and formula_1 are normal subgroups of an additive group formula_2 such that formula_130 and formula_131, then formula_132.
* Normality is preserved under surjective homomorphisms; that is, if formula_52 is a surjective group homomorphism and formula_1 is normal in formula_2, then the image formula_136 is normal in formula_111.
* Normality is preserved by taking inverse images; that is, if formula_52 is a group homomorphism and formula_1 is normal in formula_111, then the inverse image formula_141 is normal in formula_2.
* Normality is preserved on taking direct products; that is, if formula_143 and formula_144, then formula_145.
* Every subgroup of index 2 is normal. More generally, a subgroup, formula_111, of finite index, formula_147, in formula_2 contains a subgroup, formula_149 normal in formula_2 and of index dividing formula_151 called the normal core. In particular, if formula_152 is the smallest prime dividing the order of formula_2, then every subgroup of index formula_152 is normal.
* The fact that normal subgroups of formula_2 are precisely the kernels of group homomorphisms defined on formula_2 accounts for some of the importance of normal subgroups; they are a way to internally classify all homomorphisms defined on a group. For example, a non-identity finite group is simple if and only if it is isomorphic to all of its non-identity homomorphic images, a finite group is perfect if and only if it has no normal subgroups of prime index, and a group is imperfect if and only if the derived subgroup is not supplemented by any proper normal subgroup.

=== Lattice of normal subgroups ===
Given two normal subgroups, formula_1 and formula_127, of formula_2, their intersection formula_160 and their product formula_161 are also normal subgroups of formula_2. 

The normal subgroups of formula_2 form a lattice under subset inclusion with least element, formula_70, and greatest element, formula_2. The meet of two normal subgroups, formula_1 and formula_127, in this lattice is their intersection and the join is their product.

The lattice is complete and modular.

== Normal subgroups, quotient groups and homomorphisms ==

If formula_1 is a normal subgroup, we can define a multiplication on cosets as follows: 
formula_169
This relation defines a mapping formula_170. To show that this mapping is well-defined, one needs to prove that the choice of representative elements formula_171 does not affect the result. To this end, consider some other representative elements formula_172. Then there are formula_173 such that formula_174. It follows that formula_175where we also used the fact that formula_1 is a subgroup, and therefore there is formula_177 such that formula_178. This proves that this product is a well-defined mapping between cosets.

With this operation, the set of cosets is itself a group, called the quotient group and denoted with formula_179 There is a natural homomorphism, formula_180, given by formula_181. This homomorphism maps formula_1 into the identity element of formula_47, which is the coset formula_184, that is, formula_185.

In general, a group homomorphism, formula_186 sends subgroups of formula_2 to subgroups of formula_111. Also, the preimage of any subgroup of formula_111 is a subgroup of formula_2. We call the preimage of the trivial group formula_70 in formula_111 the kernel of the homomorphism and denote it by formula_193. As it turns out, the kernel is always normal and the image of formula_194, is always isomorphic to formula_195 (the first isomorphism theorem). In fact, this correspondence is a bijection between the set of all quotient groups of formula_2, formula_47, and the set of all homomorphic images of formula_2 (up to isomorphism). It is also easy to see that the kernel of the quotient map, formula_180, is formula_1 itself, so the normal subgroups are precisely the kernels of homomorphisms with domain formula_2.

<text>Munkar and Nakir () (English translation: &quot;The Denied and The Denier&quot;) in Islamic eschatology, are angels who test the faith of the dead in their graves.

== Scripture ==
There is no reference to Munkar and Nakir in the Quran. Their names are first mentioned by Tirmidhi in the hadith tradition. However, the Quran alludes to them.
&quot;And if you could but see when the angels take the souls of those who disbelieved... They are striking their faces and their backs and [saying], &quot;Taste the punishment of the Burning Fire.&quot; — Saheeh International
And if you could but see when the wrongdoers are in the overwhelming pangs of death while the angels extend their hands,1 [saying], &quot;Discharge your souls! Today you will be awarded the punishment of [extreme] humiliation for what you used to say against Allāh other than the truth and [that] you were, toward His verses, being arrogant. — Saheeh International

==Description==
Al-Suyuti quoted from Ibn Abi al-Dunya, Al-Bayhaqi, and Musnad al-Bazzar that when Munkar and Nakir spoke, tongues of fire come from their mouths. If one answers their questions incorrectly, one is beaten every day, other than Friday, until God (Allah) gives permission for the beating to stop. Al-Suyuti also mentioned from the hadith about Munkar and Nakir digging through the earth to reach the dead person using their teeth, and that their hair reaches their feet. Meanwhile, Al-Suyuti described from Hadith recorded Al-Hakim al-Nishapuri and from Sunan Abu Dawood Munkar and Nakir carrying hammers &quot;so large, that [they] cannot be moved even if whole of mankind unite to lift [them]&quot;.

==Questionings in the grave==

Muslims believe that after a person dies, his soul passes through a stage called barzakh, where it exists in the grave. The questioning will begin when the funeral and burial is over. Nakir and Munkar prop the deceased soul upright in the grave and ask three questions:

# Who is your Lord? 
# What is your religion? 
# Who is your prophet?

A righteous believer will respond correctly, saying that their Lord is Allah, that Islam is their religion, and that Muhammad is their prophet. If the deceased answers correctly, the time spent awaiting the resurrection is pleasant and they may enter heaven. Those who do not answer as described above are chastised until the day of judgment. There is a belief that the fire of Hell can already be seen in barzakh and that the spiritual pain caused by this can lead to purification of the soul.

Shia theologian al-Mufid reports that the angels ask about one&#x27;s &quot;iman.&quot; The correct answer appears to be the Quran.

The questioning of the grave is part of the Islamic Creed according to Ash&#x27;ari.

Muslims believe that a person will correctly answer the questions not by remembering the answers before death but by their iman (faith) and deeds such as salat (prayer) and shahadah (the Islamic profession of faith).

==Cultural interpretations ==

Munkar and Nakir bear some similarity to Zoroastrian divinities. Some of these, such as Mithra, Sraosha and Rashnu have a role in the judgement of souls. Rashnu is described as a figure who holds a set of scales, like some angels of the grave. E.G. Brown has suggested that a continuity exists between Rashnu and Munkar and Nakir. Sebastian Günther also points out it. He writes that &quot;the image and function of Munkar and Nakīr carries certain echoes of the Zoroastrian concept of the angels Srōsh (“Obedience”) and Ātar (“Fire”)&quot;. A mythical figure in Mandaean religion, Abathur Muzania is similar to Rashnu. He has the same position in the world of the dead and he holds a set of scales. &quot;Muzania&quot; means scales (mizan) in Aramaic.

According to a recent research, it is hypothesized that Munkar and Nakir were derived from astrological figures that originally associated with the Mesopotamian astral god Nergal. This is based on idea that the Mesopotamian god Nergal has almost the same characteristics as Munkar and Nakir. First of all, Assyrian nakru which means &#x27;enemy&#x27;, was an epithet of Nergal. The Assyrian &quot;nakru&quot;, like the names Munkar and Nakir, comes from the same root, that is, it comes from the proto-Semitic NKR which derived some negative terms. Some scholars use a different spelling; &quot;nakuru&quot;. which is almost the same as Nakir. Moreover, Nergal is a lord of the Underworld and the grave (Assyrian &quot;qabru&quot;: grave). Like Munkar and Nakir, he has a terrifying voice that can cause panic among men and gods. He holds a shining mace and his breath can burn his enemies. Because he is related to fire most scholars suggest that he was originally a sun god. Furthermore, he is identified with the celestial twins (&quot;Gemini&quot;) in the Babylonian astral mythology which forms a direct link to Munkar and Nakir.

The Mesopotamians still believed in the sun god Shamash, as well as Nergal and several other Babylonian gods at the time Islam was introduced.Thus, Nergal the god of the Underworld who is symbolized by the planet Mars, is a possible prototype for Munkar and Nakir. Astrologically, Munkar and Nakir share more clues in their Martian characteristics which connect them to Nergal.

In stark contrast, scholar A. J. Wensinck found the association of Munkar and Nakir to the root NKR to be unlikely. Similarly, scholar John MacDonald believes the names of the two angels have not been satisfactorily explained, although given that they are in the passive form, they may be understood as &quot;unknown&quot; or &quot;disguised&quot;, much in the same way how angels visit graves in disguise in Judaism. Rabbinic literature offers many traditions about punishing angels, chastising the dead.

<doc id="21920" wikidata="Q181822" url="?curid=21920" title="Napalm">
<text>Napalm is an incendiary mixture of a gelling agent and a volatile petrochemical (usually gasoline or diesel fuel). The name is a portmanteau of two of the constituents of the original thickening and gelling agents: coprecipitated aluminium salts of &quot;na&quot;phthenic acid and &quot;palm&quot;itic acid. A team led by chemist Louis Fieser originally developed napalm for the US Chemical Warfare Service in 1942 in a secret laboratory at Harvard University. Of immediate first interest was its viability as an incendiary device to be used in American fire bombing campaigns during World War II; its potential to be coherently projected into a solid stream that would carry for distance (instead of the bloomy fireball of pure gasoline) resulted in widespread adoption in infantry and tank/boat mounted flamethrowers as well.

Napalm burns at temperatures ranging from . It burns longer than gasoline, is more easily dispersed, and adheres to its targets. These traits make it both effective and controversial. It has been widely used from the air and from the ground, the largest use having been via airdropped bombs in World War II in the incendiary attacks on Japanese cities in 1945. It was used also for close air support roles by the U.S military in the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and various others. Napalm has also fueled most of the flamethrowers (tank-, ship-, and infantry-based) used since World War II, giving them much greater range.

== Development ==
The development of napalm was precipitated by the use of jellied gasoline mixtures by the Allied forces during World War II. Latex, used in these early forms of incendiary devices, became scarce, since natural rubber was almost impossible to obtain after the Japanese army captured the rubber plantations in Malaya, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Thailand.

This shortage of natural rubber prompted chemists at US companies such as DuPont and Standard Oil of New Jersey, and researchers at Harvard University, to develop factory-made alternatives: artificial rubber for all uses, including vehicle tires, tank tracks, gaskets, hoses, medical supplies and rain clothing. A team of chemists led by Louis Fieser at Harvard University was the first to develop synthetic napalm during 1942. &quot;The production of napalm was first entrusted to Nuodex Products, and by the middle of April 1942 they had developed a brown, dry powder that was not sticky by itself, but when mixed with gasoline turned into an extremely sticky and flammable substance.&quot; One of Fieser&#x27;s colleagues suggested adding phosphorus to the mix which increased the &quot;ability to penetrate deeply [...] into the musculature, where it would continue to burn day after day.&quot;

On 4 July 1942, the first test occurred on the football field near the Harvard Business School. Tests under operational conditions were carried out at Jefferson Proving Ground on condemned farm buildings and subsequently at Dugway Proving Ground on buildings designed and constructed to represent those to be found in German and Japanese towns. This new mixture of chemicals was first approved for use on the front lines in 1943.
== Military use ==
=== World War II ===

The first use of napalm in combat was in August 1943 during the Allied invasion of Sicily, when American troops, using napalm-fueled flamethrowers, burned down a wheat field where German forces were believed to be hiding. Napalm incendiary bombs were first used the following year, although the exact date and battle are disputed.

Two-thirds of napalm bombs produced during WWII were used in the Pacific War. Napalm was often deployed against Japanese fortifications on Saipan, Iwo Jima, the Philippines, and Okinawa, where deeply dug-in Japanese troops refused to surrender. Following a shortage of conventional thermite bombs, General Curtis LeMay, among other high-ranking servicemen, ordered air raids on Japan to start using napalm instead. A 1946 report by the National Defense Research Council claims that 40,000 tons of M69s were dropped on Japan throughout the war, damaging 64 cities and causing more deaths than the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

German fortifications and transportation hubs were targeted with napalm during both Operation Overlord and the Battle of the Bulge, sometimes in conjunction with artillery. During the Allied siege of La Rochelle, napalm was dropped on the outskirts of the Royan pocket, inadvertently killing French civilians.

The Royal Air Force (RAF) used napalm to a limited extent in both the Pacific War and the European Theater.
=== Korean War ===
Napalm was widely used by the US during the Korean War. The ground forces in North Korea holding defensive positions were often outnumbered by Chinese and North Koreans, but US Air Force and Navy aviators had control of the air over nearly all of the Korean Peninsula. Hence, the American and other UN aviators used napalm for close air support of the ground troops. Napalm was used most notably at the beginning of the Battle of Outpost Harry.

Eighth Army chemical officer Donald Bode reported that, on an &quot;average good day&quot;, UN pilots used (70,000 US gal; ) of napalm, with approximately (60,000 US gal; ) of this thrown by US forces. The &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; hailed &quot;Napalm, the No. 1 Weapon in Korea&quot;. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill privately criticized the use of napalm in Korea, writing that it was &quot;very cruel&quot;, as US/UN forces, he wrote, were &quot;splashing it all over the civilian population&quot;, &quot;tortur[ing] great masses of people&quot;. He conveyed these sentiments to U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Omar Bradley, who &quot;never published the statement&quot;. Publicly, Churchill allowed Bradley &quot;to issue a statement that confirmed U.K. support for U.S. napalm attacks&quot;.
=== Vietnam War ===
Napalm became an intrinsic element of US military action during the Vietnam War as forces made increasing use of it for its tactical and psychological effects. Reportedly about (388,000 short tons; ) of US napalm bombs were dropped in the region between 1963 and 1973. The US Air Force and US Navy used napalm with great effect against all kinds of targets, such as troops, tanks, buildings, jungles, and even railroad tunnels. The effect was not always purely physical as its destructive effects and ability to spread uncontrolled had psychological effects on Vietnamese forces and civilians as well. 

=== Others ===
During the Greek Civil War, after the capture of Mount Vitsi during Operation Pyrsos, the Hellenic Air Force bombed Mount Grammos—a stronghold for the opposing Democratic Army of Greece—with US-supplied napalm.

The French Air Force regularly used napalm for close air support of ground operations in both the First Indochina War and the Algerian War. At first, the canisters were simply pushed out the cargo doors of transport planes, such as the Amiot AAC.1; later mostly B-26 bombers were used.

Peruvian forces employed napalm throughout the 1960s against both communist insurgents and the Matsés indigenous group; four prominent Matsés villages were bombed during the 1964 Matsés massacres.

From 1968–1978, Rhodesia produced a variant of napalm for use in the Rhodesian Bush War, nicknamed &quot;Frantan&quot; (short for &quot;frangible tank&quot;). Around the same time, its ally South Africa targeted guerrilla bases in Angola with napalm during the South African Border War.

In 2018, Turkey was accused of using napalm in Operation Olive Branch against Kurdish nationalist groups.

== Antipersonnel effects ==
When used as a part of an incendiary weapon, napalm causes severe burns. During combustion, napalm deoxygenates the available air and generates carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, so asphyxiation, unconsciousness, and death are also possible.Napalm is lethal even for dug-in enemy personnel, as it flows into foxholes, tunnels, and bunkers, and drainage and irrigation ditches and other improvised troop shelters. Even people in undamaged shelters can be killed by hyperthermia, radiant heat, dehydration, asphyxiation, smoke exposure, or carbon monoxide poisoning. Crews of armored fighting vehicles are also vulnerable, due to the intense heat conducted through the armor. Even in the case of a near miss, the heat can be enough to disable a vehicle.

One firebomb released from a low-flying plane can damage an area of .

== International law ==
International law does not specifically prohibit the use of napalm or other incendiaries against military targets, but use against civilian populations was banned under Protocol III of the United Nations Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons in 1980, which entered into force as international law in December 1983. As of January 2023, 126 countries have ratified Protocol III.

<text>The Northern Crusades or Baltic Crusades were Christianization campaigns undertaken by Catholic Christian military orders and kingdoms, primarily against the pagan Baltic, Finnic and West Slavic peoples around the southern and eastern shores of the Baltic Sea.

The most notable campaigns were the Livonian and Prussian crusades. Some of these wars were called crusades during the Middle Ages, however others, including the 12th century First Swedish Crusade and several following military incursions by Scandinavian Christians against the then pagan Finns, were dubbed &quot;crusades&quot; only in the 19th century by romantic nationalist historians. However, crusades against Estonians and against &quot;other pagans in those parts&quot; were authorized by Pope Alexander III in the crusade bull &quot;Non parum animus noster&quot;, in 1171 or 1172.

==Background==
At the outset of the northern crusades, Christian monarchs across northern Europe commissioned forays into territories that comprise modern-day Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Russia. The indigenous populations of Pagans suffered forced baptisms and the ravages of military occupation. Spearheading, but by no means monopolizing these incursions, the ascendant Teutonic Order profited immensely from the crusades, as did German merchants who fanned out along trading routes traversing the Baltic frontier.
The official starting point for the Northern Crusades was Pope Celestine III&#x27;s call in 1195, but the Catholic kingdoms of Scandinavia, Poland and the Holy Roman Empire had begun moving to subjugate their pagan neighbors even earlier (see Christianization of Pomerania). The non-Christian people who were objects of the campaigns at various dates included:
* the Polabian Wends, Sorbs, and Obotrites between the Elbe and Oder rivers (by the Saxons, Danes, and Poles, beginning with the Wendish Crusade in 1147)
* the Finns proper in the 1150s in the First Crusade by the Swedes; by the Danes in 1191 and 1202; Tavastia in 1249 in the Second Crusade by the Swedes; and Karelia in 1293 in the Third Crusade by the Swedes; Christianization in these areas had started earlier.
* Livonians, Latgallians, Selonians, and Estonians (by the Germans and Danes, 1193–1227).
* Semigallians and Curonians (1219–1290).
* Old Prussians.
* Lithuanians and Samogitians (by the Germans, unsuccessfully, 1236–1410).

Armed conflict between the Finnic peoples, Balts and Slavs who dwelt by the Baltic shores and their Saxon and Danish neighbors to the north and south had been common for several centuries before the crusade. The previous battles had largely been caused by attempts to destroy castles and sea trade routes to gain an economic advantage in the region, and the crusade basically continued this pattern of conflict, albeit now inspired and prescribed by the Pope and undertaken by Papal knights and armed monks.

==Wendish Crusade==

The campaigns started with the 1147 Wendish Crusade against the Polabian Slavs (or &quot;Wends&quot;) of what is now northern and eastern Germany. The crusade occurred parallel to the Second Crusade to the Holy Land, and continued irregularly until the 16th century.

==Swedish Crusades==

The Swedish crusades were campaigns by Sweden against Finns, Tavastians and Karelians during the period from 1150 to 1293. The wars with the Eastern Orthodox Novgorod Republic also had a religious aspect.

== Danish Crusades ==

The Danes are known to have made at least three crusades to Finland. The first mention of these crusades is from 1187 when crusader Esbern Snare mentioned in his Christmas feast speech a major victory over the Finns. The two next known crusades were made in 1191 and in 1202. The latter one was led by the Bishop of Lund, Anders Sunesen, with his brother.

==Livonian Crusade==

By the 12th century, the peoples inhabiting the lands now known as Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania formed a pagan wedge between increasingly powerful rival Christian states – the Orthodox Church to their east and the Catholic Church to their west. The difference in creeds was one of the reasons they were able to resist being forcibly converted to a different religion. During a period of more than 150 years leading up to the arrival of German crusaders in the region, Estonia was attacked thirteen times by Russian principalities, and by Denmark and Sweden as well. Estonians for their part made raids upon Denmark and Sweden. There were peaceful attempts by some Catholics to convert the Estonians, starting with missions dispatched by Adalbert, Archbishop of Bremen in 1045–1072. However, these peaceful efforts seem to have had limited success.

===Campaign against the Livonians (1198–1212)===
Moving in the wake of German merchants who were now following the old trading routes of the Vikings, a monk named Meinhard landed at the mouth of the Daugava river in present-day Latvia in 1180 and was made bishop in 1186. Pope Celestine III proclaimed a crusade against the Baltic pagans in 1195, which was reiterated by Pope Innocent III, and a crusading expedition led by Meinhard&#x27;s successor, Bishop Berthold of Hanover, landed in Livonia (part of present-day Latvia, surrounding the Gulf of Riga) in 1198. Although the crusaders won their first battle, Bishop Berthold was mortally wounded and the crusaders were repelled.

In 1199, Albert of Buxhoeveden was appointed by the Archbishop Hartwig II of Bremen to Christianise the Baltic countries. By the time Albert died 30 years later, the conquest and formal Christianisation of present-day Estonia and northern Latvia was complete. Albert began his task by touring the Empire, preaching a Crusade against the Baltic countries, and was assisted in this by a papal bull which declared that fighting against the Baltic heathens was of the same rank as participating in a crusade to the Holy Land. Although he landed in the mouth of the Daugava in 1200 with only 23 ships and 500 soldiers, the bishop&#x27;s efforts ensured that a constant flow of recruits followed. The first crusaders usually arrived to fight during the spring and returned to their homes in the autumn. To ensure a permanent military presence, the Livonian Brothers of the Sword were founded in 1202. The founding by Bishop Albert of the market at Riga in 1201 attracted citizens from the Empire and economic prosperity ensued. At Albert&#x27;s request, Pope Innocent III dedicated the Baltic countries to the Virgin Mary to popularize recruitment to his army and the name &quot;Mary&#x27;s Land&quot; has survived up to modern times. This is noticeable in one of the names given to Livonia at the time, Terra Mariana (Land of Mary).

In 1206, the crusaders subdued the Livonian stronghold in Turaida on the right bank of Gauja River, the ancient trading route to the Northwestern Rus. In order to gain control over the left bank of Gauja, the stone castle was built in Sigulda before 1210. By 1211, the Livonian province of Metsepole (now Limbaži district) and the mixed Livonian–Latgallian inhabited county of Idumea (now Straupe) was converted to the Roman Catholic faith. The last battle against the Livonians was the siege of Satezele hillfort near to Sigulda in 1212. The Livonians, who had been paying tribute to the East Slavic Principality of Polotsk, had at first considered the Germans useful allies. The first prominent Livonian to be christened was their leader Caupo of Turaida. As the German grip tightened, the Livonians rebelled against the crusaders and the christened chief but were put down. Caupo of Turaida remained an ally of the crusaders until his death in the Battle of St. Matthew&#x27;s Day in 1217.

The German crusaders enlisted newly baptised Livonian warriors to participate in their campaigns against Latgallians and Selonians (1208–1209), Estonians (1208–1227) and against Semigallians, Samogitians and Curonians (1219–1290).

===Campaign against the Latgallians and Selonians (1208–1224)===

After the subjugation of the Livonians, the crusaders turned their attention to the Latgallian principalities to the east, along the Gauja and Daugava rivers. The military alliance in 1208 and later conversion from Greek Orthodoxy to Roman Catholicism of the Principality of Tālava was the only peaceful subjugation of the Baltic tribes during the Nordic crusades. The ruler of Tālava, Tālivaldis (), became the most loyal ally of German crusaders against the Estonians, and he died a Catholic martyr in 1215. The war against the Latgallian and Selonian countries along the Daugava waterway started in 1208 by the occupation of the Orthodox Principality of Koknese and the Selonian Sēlpils hillfort. The campaign continued in 1209 with an attack on the Orthodox Principality of Jersika (known as ), accused by crusaders of being in alliance with Lithuanian pagans. After the defeat, the king of Jersika, Visvaldis, became the vassal of the Bishop of Livonia and received part of his country (southern Latgale) as a fiefdom. The Selonian stronghold of Sēlpils was briefly the seat of a Selonian diocese (1218–1226), and then came under the rule of the Livonian Order (and eventually the stone castle of Selburg was built in its place). Only in 1224, with the division of Tālava and Adzele counties between the Bishop of Riga and the Order of the Swordbearers, did Latgallian countries finally become the possession of German conquerors. The territory of the former Principality of Jersika was divided between the Bishop of Riga and the Livonian Order in 1239.

By 1208, the Germans were strong enough to begin operations against the Estonians, who were at that time divided into eight major and several smaller counties led by elders with limited cooperation between them. In 1208–1227, war parties of the different sides rampaged through the Livonian, Northern Latgallian, and Estonian counties, with Livonians and Latgallians normally as allies of the Crusaders, and the Principalities of Polotsk and Pskov appearing as allies of different sides at different times. Hillforts, which were the key centres of Estonian counties, were besieged and captured a number of times. A truce between the war-weary sides was established for three years (1213–1215) and proved generally more favourable to the Germans, who consolidated their political position, while the Estonians were unable to develop their system of loose alliances into a centralised state. The Livonian leader Kaupo was killed in battle near Viljandi (Fellin) on 21 September 1217, but the battle was a crushing defeat for the Estonians, whose leader Lembitu was also killed. Since 1211, his name had come to the attention of the German chroniclers as a notable Estonian elder, and he had become the central figure of the Estonian resistance.

The Christian kingdoms of Denmark and Sweden were also greedy for conquests on the Eastern shores of the Baltic. While the Swedes made only one failed foray into western Estonia in 1220, the Danish Fleet headed by King Valdemar II of Denmark had landed at the Estonian town of Lindanisse (present-day Tallinn) in 1219. After the Battle of Lindanise the Danes established a fortress, which was besieged by Estonians in 1220 and 1223 but held out. Eventually, the whole of northern Estonia came under Danish control.

===Wars against Saaremaa (1206–1261)===
The last Estonian county to hold out against the invaders was the island county of Saaremaa (Ösel), whose war fleets had raided Denmark and Sweden during the years of fighting against the German crusaders.

In 1206, a Danish army led by the king Valdemar II and Andreas, the Bishop of Lund landed on Saaremaa and attempted to establish a stronghold without success. In 1216 the Livonian Brothers of the Sword and the bishop Theodorich joined forces and invaded Saaremaa over the frozen sea. In return, the Oeselians raided the territories in Latvia that were under German rule the following spring. In 1220, the Swedish army led by king John I of Sweden and the bishop Karl of Linköping conquered Lihula in Rotalia in Western Estonia. Oeselians attacked the Swedish stronghold the same year, conquered it and killed the entire Swedish garrison including the Bishop of Linköping.

In 1222, the Danish king Valdemar II attempted the second conquest of Saaremaa, this time establishing a stone fortress housing a strong garrison. The Danish stronghold was besieged and surrendered within five days, the Danish garrison returned to Revel, leaving bishop Albert of Riga&#x27;s brother Theodoric, and few others, behind as hostages for peace. The castle was razed to the ground by the Oeselians.

A 20,000 strong army under Papal legate William of Modena crossed the frozen sea while the Saaremaa fleet was icebound, in January 1227. After the surrender of two major Oeselian strongholds, Muhu and Valjala, the Oeselians formally accepted Christianity.

In 1236, after the defeat of the Livonian Brothers of the Sword in the Battle of Saule, military action on Saaremaa broke out again. In 1261, warfare continued as the Oeselians had once more renounced Christianity and killed all the Germans on the island. A peace treaty was signed after the united forces of the Livonian Order, the Bishopric of Ösel-Wiek, and Danish Estonia, including mainland Estonians and Latvians, defeated the Oeselians by conquering their stronghold at Kaarma. Soon thereafter, the Livonian Order established a stone fort at Pöide.

===Wars against the Curonians and Semigallians (1201–1290)===
Although the Curonians had attacked Riga in 1201 and 1210, Albert of Buxhoeveden, considering Courland a tributary of Valdemar II of Denmark, had been reluctant to conduct a large scale campaign against them. After Albert&#x27;s death in 1229, the crusaders secured the peaceful submission of Vanemane (a county with a mixed Livonian, Oselian, and Curonian population in the northeastern part of Courland) by treaty in 1230. In the same year, the papal vice-legate Baldouin of Alnea annulled this agreement and concluded an agreement with the ruler () of Bandava in the central Courland Lammekinus, delivering his kingdom into the hands of the papacy. Baldouin became the popes&#x27;s delegate in Courland and bishop of Semigallia; however, the Germans complained about him to the Roman Curia, and in 1234 Pope Gregory IX removed Baldouin as his delegate.

After their decisive defeat in the Battle of Saule by the Samogitians and Semigallians, the remnants of the Sword Brothers were reorganized in 1237 as a subdivision of the Teutonic Order, and became known as the Livonian Order. In 1242, under the leadership of the master of the Livonian Order Andrew of Groningen, the crusaders began the military conquest of Courland. They defeated the Curonians as far south as Embūte, near the contemporary border with Lithuania, and founded their main fortress at Kuldīga. In 1245 Pope Innocent IV allotted two-thirds of conquered Courland to the Livonian Order, and one third to the Bishopric of Courland.

At the Battle of Durbe in 1260 a force of Samogitians and Curonians overpowered the united forces of the Livonian and Teutonic Orders; over the following years, however, the Crusaders gradually subjugated the Curonians, and in 1267 concluded the peace treaty stipulating the obligations and the rights of their defeated rivals. The unconquered southern parts of their territories (Ceklis and Megava) were united under the rule of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.

The conquest of Semigallian counties started in 1219 when crusaders from Riga occupied Mežotne, the major port on the Lielupe waterway, and founded the Bishopric of Semigallia. After several unsuccessful campaigns against the pagan Semigallian duke Viestards and his Samogitian kinsfolk, the Roman Curia decided in 1251 to abolish the Bishopric of Semigallia, and divided its territories between the Bishopric of Riga and the Order of Livonia. In 1265 a stone castle was built at Jelgava, on the Lielupe, and became the main military base for crusader attacks against the Semigallians. In 1271 the capital hillfort of Tērvete was conquered, but Semigallians under the Duke Nameisis rebelled in 1279, and the Lithuanians under Traidenis defeated Livonian Order forces in the Battle of Aizkraukle. Duke Nameisis&#x27; warriors unsuccessfully attacked Riga in 1280, in response to which around 14,000 crusaders besieged Turaida castle in 1281. To conquer the remaining Semigallian hillforts the Order&#x27;s master Villekin of Endorpe built a castle called () right next to the Tērvete castle in 1287. The same year the Semigallians made another attempt to conquer Riga, but again failed to take it. On their return home, Livonian knights attacked them, but were defeated at the Battle of Garoza, in which the Orders&#x27; master Villekin and at least 35 knights lost their lives. The new master of the Order Konrad von Hattstein organised the last campaigns against the Semigallians in 1289 and 1290; the hillforts of Dobele, Rakte and Sidabre were conquered and most of the Semigallian warriors joined the Samogitian and Lithuanian forces.

==Prussia and Lithuania==
=== Campaigns of Bolesław the Curly and Konrad of Masovia ===
From 1147 the Polish Duke of Mazovia, Boleslaw the Curly, led many expeditions against pagan Prussia, some of them were successful and resulted in the conquest of parts of the Prussian territories.

Konrad I, the Polish Duke of Masovia, unsuccessfully attempted to conquer pagan Prussia in crusades in 1219 and 1222. Taking the advice of the first Bishop of Prussia, Christian of Oliva, Konrad founded the crusading Order of Dobrzyń (or &quot;Dobrin&quot;) in 1220. However, this order was largely ineffective, and Konrad&#x27;s campaigns against the Old Prussians were answered by incursions into the already captured territory of Culmerland (Chełmno Land). Subjected to constant Prussian counter-raids, Konrad wanted to stabilize the north of the Duchy of Masovia in this fight over the border area of Chełmno Land. Masovia became part of Poland in the 10th century but native Prussians, Yotvingians, and Lithuanians were still living in the territories north of Masovia, where no settled borders existed. Konrad&#x27;s military weakness led him in 1226 to ask the Roman Catholic monastic order of the Teutonic Knights to come to Prussia and suppress the Old Prussians.

=== Campaigns of Bolesław the Chaste and Leszek the Black ===
Campaigns against Yotvingians and Lithuanians were also conducted in the years 1248–1282 by princes Bolesław the Chaste and Leszek the Black. They defeated the forces of pagans invading Mazovia, Kujawy and the Lublin region. They also carried out several expeditions to Yotvingian territories.

== Teutonic Order in Livonia and Votia (1237–1410) ==

The Northern Crusades provided a rationale for the growth and expansion of the Teutonic Order of German crusading knights which had been founded in Palestine at the end of the 12th century. Duke Konrad I of Masovia in west-central Poland appealed to the Knights to defend his borders and subdue the pagan Old Prussians in 1226. Already in 1234, a great expedition began, in which the Polish forces of Konrad of Mazovia and the Teutonic Knights defeated the Baltic Prussians in the battle on the Dzierzgoń river. After the subjugation of the Prussians, the Teutonic Knights fought against the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.

When the Livonian knights were crushed by Samogitians and Semigallians in the Battle of Saule in 1236, coinciding with a series of revolts in Estonia, the Livonian Order was inherited by the Teutonic Order, allowing the Teutonic Knights to exercise political control over large territories in the Baltic region. Mindaugas, the King of Lithuania, was baptised together with his wife after his coronation in 1253, hoping that this would help stop the Crusaders&#x27; attacks, which it did not. The Teutonic Knights failed to subdue Lithuania, which officially converted to (Catholic) Christianity in 1386 on the marriage of Grand Duke Jogaila to the 11-year-old, female, king Jadwiga of Poland. However, even after the country was officially converted, the conflict continued up until the 1410 Battle of Grunwald, also known as the First Battle of Tannenberg, when the Lithuanians and Poles, helped by the Tatars, Moldovans and the Czechs, defeated the Teutonic Knights.

In 1221, Pope Honorius III was again worried about the situation in the Finnish-Novgorodian Wars after receiving alarming information from the Archbishop of Uppsala. He authorized the Bishop of Finland to establish a trade embargo against the &quot;barbarians&quot; that threatened Christianity in Finland. The nationality of the &quot;barbarians&quot;, presumably a citation from Archbishop&#x27;s earlier letter, remains unknown, and was not necessarily known even by the Pope. However, as the trade embargo was widened eight years later, it was specifically said to be against the Russians. Based on Papal letters from 1229, the Bishop of Finland requested the Pope enforce a trade embargo against Novgorodians on the Baltic Sea, at least in Visby, Riga and Lübeck. A few years later, the Pope also requested the Livonian Brothers of the Sword send troops to protect Finland. Whether any knights ever arrived remains unknown.

The Teutonic Order&#x27;s attempts to conquer Orthodox Russia (particularly the Republics of Pskov and Novgorod), an enterprise endorsed by Pope Gregory IX, accompanied the Northern Crusades. One of the major blows for the idea of the conquest of Russia was the Battle of the Ice in 1242. With or without the Pope&#x27;s blessing, Sweden also undertook several crusades against Orthodox Novgorod.

Livonian missionary and crusade activity in Estonia caused conflicts with Novgorod, who had also attempted to subjugate, raid and convert the pagan Estonians. The Estonians also sometimes attempted to ally with the Russians against the Crusaders.

Wars between the two sides continued intermittently on several occasions, and halted the eastward expansion of the Teutonic Order, but Novgorodian attempt to take Estonia and Livonia also failed, and the area was firmly dominated by the Teutonic Order.
