<text>New Zealand English (NZE) is the variant of the English language spoken and written by most English-speaking New Zealanders. Its language code in ISO and Internet standards is en-NZ. It is the first language of the majority of the population.

The English language was established in New Zealand by colonists during the 19th century. It is one of &quot;the newest native-speaker variet[ies] of the English language in existence, a variety which has developed and become distinctive only in the last 150 years&quot;. The variety of English that had the biggest influence on the development of New Zealand English was Australian English, itself derived from Southeastern England English, with considerable influence from Scottish and Hiberno-English, and with lesser influences the British prestige accent Received Pronunciation (RP) and American English. An important source of vocabulary is the Māori language of the indigenous people of New Zealand, whose contribution distinguishes New Zealand English from other varieties.

Non-rhotic New Zealand English is most similar to Australian English in pronunciation, but has key differences. A prominent difference is the realisation of (the vowel): in New Zealand English this is pronounced as a schwa. New Zealand English has several increasingly distinct varieties, and while most New Zealanders speak non-rhotic English, rhoticity is increasing quickly, especially among Pasifika and Māori in Auckland and the upper North Island.

==Dictionaries==
The first dictionary with entries documenting New Zealand English was probably the &quot;Heinemann New Zealand Dictionary&quot; published in 1979. Edited by Harry Orsman (1928–2002), it is a 1,337-page book with information relating to the usage and pronunciation of terms that were widely accepted throughout the English-speaking world, and those peculiar to New Zealand. It includes a one-page list of the approximate date of entry into common parlance of the many terms found in New Zealand English but not elsewhere, such as &quot;haka&quot; (1827), &quot;boohai&quot; (1920), and &quot;bach&quot; (1905). A second edition was published in 1989 with the cover subtitle &quot;The first dictionary of New Zealand English and New Zealand pronunciation&quot;. A third edition, edited by Nelson Wattie, was published as &quot;The Reed Dictionary of New Zealand English&quot; by Reed Publishing in 2001.

The first dictionary fully dedicated to the New Zealand variety of English was &quot;The New Zealand Dictionary&quot; published by New House Publishers in 1994 and edited by Elizabeth and Harry Orsman. A second edition was published in 1995.

In 1997, Oxford University Press produced the Harry Orsman-edited &quot;The Dictionary of New Zealand English: A Dictionary of New Zealandisms on Historical Principles&quot;, a 981-page book, which it claimed was based on over 40 years of research. This research started with Orsman&#x27;s 1951 thesis and continued with his editing this dictionary. To assist with and maintain this work, the New Zealand Dictionary Centre was founded in 1997 by Victoria University of Wellington and Oxford University Press. This was followed by &quot;The New Zealand Oxford Paperback Dictionary&quot; in 1998, edited by New Zealand lexicographer Tony Deverson. It is based on &quot;The Oxford Paperback Dictionary, fourth edition&quot;, and &quot;The Australian Oxford Paperback Dictionary, second edition&quot;. Further lexicographical work culminated in the 1,374-page &quot;The New Zealand Oxford Dictionary&quot; published in 2004, by Tony Deverson and Graeme Kennedy. The dictionary contains over 100,000 definitions, including over 12,000 New Zealand entries and a wide range of encyclopedic information. A second, revised edition of &quot;The New Zealand Oxford Paperback Dictionary&quot; was published in 2006, this time using standard lexicographical regional markers to identify the New Zealand content, which were absent from the first edition. The NZ Dictionary Centre ceased active operations after the retirement of its second Director, Dianne Bardsley, in 2012.

Another authoritative work is the &quot;Collins English Dictionary&quot;, first published in 1979 by HarperCollins, which contains an abundance of well-cited New Zealand words and phrases, drawing from the 650-million-word Bank of English, a British research facility set up at the University of Birmingham in 1980 and funded by Collins publishers. Although this is a British dictionary of International English there has always been a credited New Zealand advisor for the New Zealand content, namely Professor Ian Gordon from 1979 until 2002 and Professor Elizabeth Gordon from the University of Canterbury since 2003. 

Australia&#x27;s &quot;Macquarie Dictionary&quot; was first published in 1981, and has since become the authority on Australian English. It has always included an abundance of New Zealand words and phrases additional to the mutually shared words and phrases of both countries. Every edition has retained a New Zealand resident advisor for the New Zealand content, the first being Harry Orsman. and the most recent being Victoria University of Wellington lexicographer Laurie Bauer.

==Historical development==
From the 1790s, New Zealand was visited by British, French and American whaling, sealing and trading ships. Their crews traded European and American goods with the indigenous Māori. The first European settlers to New Zealand were mainly from Australia, some of them ex-convicts or escaped convicts. Sailors, explorers and traders from Australia and other parts of Europe also settled.

When in 1788 the colony of New South Wales was formed, most of New Zealand was nominally included, but no real legal authority or control was exercised. As a non-sovereign nation, New Zealand remained ungoverned and most European settlers intermarried with and lived among the Māori iwi in harmony. Settlers were greatly outnumbered by Māori and relied on them for security and safety. The first official missionaries, who were from England, arrived in New Zealand in 1814, bringing formal education and farming skills as well as Christianity to the communities, many of which by this time had become bi-lingual.

When the New Zealand Company announced in 1839 its plans to establish formal colonies in New Zealand, this and the increased commercial interests of merchants in Sydney and London spurred the British to take stronger action to establish British sovereignty over New Zealand. Captain William Hobson was sent to New Zealand to persuade Māori to cede their sovereignty to the British Crown and on 6 February 1840 Hobson and about forty Māori chiefs (rangatira) signed the Treaty of Waitangi at Waitangi in the Bay of Islands. 

New Zealand broke its connection with New South Wales and became the Colony of New Zealand on 1 July 1841. From this point there was considerable European settlement, primarily from England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland, and to a lesser extent the United States, South Africa, and various parts of continental Europe. Some 400,000 settlers came from Britain, of whom 300,000 stayed permanently. Most were young people and 250,000 babies were born. 

After the Treaty of Waitangi, the next few years saw tensions grow over disputed land purchases by settlers as well as some communities refusing to accept British rule. Conflicts escalated into what became the New Zealand Wars from 1845 to 1872. The colonial government summoned thousands of British troops from Britain and Australia, as well as locally recruited pro-British militia forces, to mount major campaigns to overpower the Māori and Māori-allied separatist movements, eventually resulting in the defeat of the rebel forces.

Despite the wars, gold discoveries in Otago (1861) and Westland (1865) caused a worldwide gold rush that more than doubled the New Zealand population from 71,000 in 1859 to 164,000 in 1863. Between 1864 and 1865, under the New Zealand Settlements Act 1863, 13 ships carrying citizens of England, Scotland, Ireland and South Africa arrived in New Zealand under the Waikato Immigration Scheme. According to census data from 1871, around half the early settlers were English, a quarter Scots, a quarter Irish and 5% Australian. 

The European population of New Zealand grew explosively from fewer than 1000 in 1831 to 500,000 by 1881. By 1911 the population of New Zealand had reached a million, of which 49,844 were Māori. 702,779 were New Zealand-born. The largest foreign-born demographics were those born in England and Scotland, followed by Australia and Ireland. 

A distinct New Zealand variant of the English language has been recognised since at least 1912, when Frank Arthur Swinnerton described it as a &quot;carefully modulated murmur&quot;. From the beginning of the haphazard Australian and European settlements and latter official British migrations, a new dialect began to form by adopting Māori words to describe the different flora and fauna of New Zealand, for which English did not have words.

The New Zealand accent first appeared in towns with mixed populations of immigrants from Australia, England, Ireland, and Scotland. These included the militia towns of the North Island and the gold-mining towns of the South Island. In more homogeneous towns such as those in Otago and Southland, settled mainly by people from Scotland, the New Zealand accent took longer to appear, while the accent was quick to develop in schools starting from the 1890s.

Since the latter 20th century New Zealand society has gradually divested itself of its fundamentally British roots and has adopted influences from all over the world, especially in the early 21st century when New Zealand experienced an increase of non-British immigration, which has brought about a more prominently multi-ethnic society. The Internet, television, movies and popular music have all brought international influences into New Zealand society and the New Zealand lexicon. Americanisation of New Zealand society and language has subtly and gradually been taking place since World War II and especially since the 1970s.

===Legal status===
While the Māori language and New Zealand Sign Language are statutory official languages of New Zealand, English is a &quot;de facto&quot; official language, which may be used in any public or official context. In 2018, MP Clayton Mitchell of New Zealand First put forward a bill for English to be recognised as an official language in legislation.

==Phonology==

Not all New Zealanders have the same accent, as the level of cultivation (i.e. the closeness to Received Pronunciation) of every speaker&#x27;s accent differs. An identifiable feature of New Zealand English is its chain shift where the vowel has moved up to the place of the traditional vowel, which in turn has moved up towards the traditional vowel, which in turn is centralised. This makes &quot;bat&quot; sound like &quot;bet&quot;, &quot;bet&quot; sound like &quot;bit&quot;, and &quot;bit&quot; sound like &quot;but&quot; to foreign ears. For example &quot;six&quot; is in New Zealand English but in Australian English. General New Zealand English is non-rhotic, however Southland is semi-rhotic due to the accent&#x27;s Scottish influence.

==Vocabulary==
New Zealand English has a number of dialectal words and phrases. These are mostly informal terms that are more common in casual speech. Numerous loanwords have been taken from the Māori language or from Australian English.

New Zealand adopted decimal currency in 1967 and the metric system in 1974. Despite this, several imperial measures are still widely encountered and usually understood, such as feet and inches for a person&#x27;s height, pounds and ounces for an infant&#x27;s birth weight, and in colloquial terms such as referring to drinks in pints. In the food manufacturing industry in New Zealand both metric and non-metric systems of weight are used and usually understood, owing to raw food products being imported from both metric and non-metric countries. However, per the December 1976 Weights and Measures Amendment Act, all foodstuffs must be retailed using the metric system. In general, the knowledge of non-metric units is lessening.

Both the words &quot;amongst&quot; and &quot;among&quot; are used, as in British English. The same is true for two other pairs, &quot;whilst&quot; and &quot;while&quot; and &quot;amidst&quot; and &quot;amid&quot;.

===Australian English influences===
New Zealand English terms of Australian origin include &quot;bushed&quot; (lost or bewildered), &quot;chunder&quot; (to vomit), &quot;drongo&quot; (a foolish or stupid person), &quot;fossick&quot; (to search), &quot;larrikin&quot; (mischievous person), &quot;Maccas&quot; (slang for McDonald&#x27;s food), &quot;maimai&quot; (a duckshooter&#x27;s hide; originally a makeshift shelter, from aboriginal &quot;mia-mia&quot;), &quot;paddock&quot; (field, or meadow), &quot;pom&quot; or &quot;pommy&quot; (an Englishman), &quot;skite&quot; (verb: to boast), &quot;station&quot; (for a very large farm), &quot;wowser&quot; (non-drinker of alcohol, or killjoy), and &quot;ute&quot; (pickup truck).

=== American English influences ===
Advancing from its British and Australian English origins, New Zealand English has evolved to include many terms of American origin, or which are otherwise used in American English, in preference over the equivalent contemporary British terms. In a number of instances, terms of British and American origin can be used interchangeably. Many American borrowings are not unique to New Zealand English, and may be found in other dialects of English, including British English. Some examples of such words in New Zealand English are the preferred usage of the American &quot;bobby pin&quot; over the British &quot;hair pin&quot;, &quot;muffler&quot; for &quot;silencer&quot;, &quot;truck&quot; for &quot;lorry&quot;, &quot;station wagon&quot; for &quot;estate car&quot;, &quot;stove&quot; for &quot;cooker&quot;, &quot;creek&quot; over &quot;brook&quot; or &quot;stream&quot;, &quot;eggplant&quot; for &quot;aubergine&quot;, &quot;median strip&quot; for &quot;central reservation&quot;, &quot;pushup&quot; for &quot;press-up&quot;, and &quot;potato chip&quot; for &quot;potato crisp&quot;.

Other examples of vocabulary directly borrowed from American English include &quot;the boonies&quot;, &quot;bucks&quot; (dollars), &quot;butt&quot; (bum or arse), &quot;ding&quot; (dent), &quot;dude&quot;, &quot;duplex&quot;, &quot;faggot&quot; or &quot;fag&quot; (interchangeable with the British &quot;poof&quot; and &quot;poofter&quot;), &quot;figure&quot; (to think or conclude; consider), &quot;hightail it&quot;, &quot;homeboy&quot;, &quot;hooker&quot;, &quot;lagoon&quot;, &quot;lube&quot; (oil change), &quot;man&quot; (in place of &quot;mate&quot; or &quot;bro&quot; in direct address), &quot;major&quot; (to study or qualify in a subject), &quot;to be over&quot; [some situation] (be fed up), &quot;rig&quot; (large truck), &quot;sheltered workshop&quot; (workplace for disabled persons), &quot;spat&quot; (a small argument), and &quot;subdivision&quot;, and &quot;tavern&quot;.

Regarding grammar, &quot;gotten&quot; can be used as opposed to the standard British &quot;got&quot; in New Zealand English in active contexts, though some speakers do not use it. It has been increasing in usage in recent years and is rarely written down.

===Differences from Australian English===
Many of these relate to words used to refer to common items, often based on which major brands become eponyms.

==Usage==
Some New Zealanders often reply to a question with a statement spoken with a rising intonation at the end. This often has the effect of making their statement sound like another question. There is enough awareness of this that it is seen in exaggerated form in comedy parody of New Zealanders, such as in the 1970s comedy character &quot;Lyn Of Tawa&quot;. This rising intonation can also be heard at the end of statements that are not in response to a question but to which the speaker wishes to add emphasis. High rising terminals are also heard in Australia.

In informal speech, some New Zealanders use the third person feminine &quot;she&quot; in place of the third person neuter &quot;it&quot; as the subject of a sentence, especially when the subject is the first word of the sentence. The most common use of this is in the phrase &quot;She&#x27;ll be right&quot; meaning either &quot;It will be okay&quot; or &quot;It is close enough to what is required&quot;. Similar to Australian English are uses such as &quot;she was great car&quot; or &quot;she&#x27;s a real beauty, this [object]&quot;.

Another specific New Zealand usage is the way in which New Zealanders refer to the country&#x27;s two main islands. They are always (except on maps) referred to as &quot;the North Island&quot; and &quot;the South Island&quot;. And because of their size, New Zealanders tend to think of these two islands as being &#x27;places&#x27;, rather than &#x27;pieces of land&#x27;, so the preposition &quot;in&quot; (rather than &quot;on&quot;) is usually used – for example, &quot;my mother lives in the North Island&quot;, &quot;Christchurch is in the South Island&quot;. This is true only for the two main islands; for smaller islands, the usual preposition &quot;on&quot; is used – for example, &quot;on Stewart Island&quot;, or &quot;on Waiheke Island&quot;.

As in some other varieties of English, &quot;us&quot; is sometimes used in place of &quot;me&quot;. A common example is &quot;give us a go&quot;, meaning &quot;give me a go&quot;. About half the country pronounce the words &quot;grown&quot; and &quot;known&quot; with two syllables, as &quot;growen&quot; and &quot;knowen&quot;. Similarly to other English varieties, when follows a vowel it is often vocalised, dropping the usual contact of the tongue and the sound becomes a vowel. An example of this is changing the words &quot;feel&quot; to &quot;fee-u&quot; or &quot;railway&quot; to &quot;rai-u-way&quot;.

==Māori influence==

Many local everyday words are loanwords that have been assimilated from the Māori language, including words for local flora, fauna, place names and the natural environment.

The dominant influence of Māori on New Zealand English is lexical. A 1999 estimate based on the Wellington corpora of written and spoken New Zealand English put the proportion of words of Māori origin at approximately 0.6%, mostly place and personal names.

Some Māori words occur in New Zealand English, such as &quot;kia ora&quot; (hello).

Māori is ever present and has a significant conceptual influence in the legislature, government, and community agencies (e.g. health and education), where legislation requires that proceedings and documents be translated into Māori (under certain circumstances, and when requested). Political discussion and analysis of issues of sovereignty, environmental management, health, and social well-being thus rely on Māori at least in part. Māori as a spoken language is particularly important wherever community consultation occurs.

==Dialects and accents==
Recognisable regional variations are slight, except for Southland and the southern part of neighbouring Otago, with its &quot;Southland burr&quot;, where the postvocalic R is pronounced rather than clipped. This southern area traditionally received heavy immigration from Scotland (see Dunedin). Several words and phrases common in Scots or Scottish English persist there; examples include the use of &quot;wee&quot; for &quot;small&quot;, and phrases such as &quot;to do the messages&quot; meaning &quot;to go shopping&quot;. Other Southland features which may also relate to early Scottish settlement are the use of the (short A) vowel in a set of words which usually use the vowel (long A), such as &quot;dance&quot; or &quot;castle&quot;, which is also common in Australian English. Another feature is the maintaining of the ~ distinction (e.g. where &quot;which&quot; and &quot;witch&quot; are not homophones).

Recent research (2012) suggests that postvocalic is not restricted to Southland, but is found also in the central North Island where there may be a Pasifika influence, but also a possible influence from modern New Zealand hip‐hop music, which has been shown to have high levels of non‐prevocalic after the vowel.

Taranaki has been said to have a minor regional accent, possibly due to the high number of immigrants from the south-west of England. However, this is becoming less pronounced.

Some Māori have an accent distinct from the general New Zealand accent; and also tend to include Māori words more frequently. Comedian Billy T. James and the &quot;bro&#x27;Town&quot; TV programme were notable for featuring exaggerated versions of this. Linguists recognise this as &quot;Māori English&quot;, and describe it as strongly influenced by syllable-timed Māori speech patterns. Linguists count &quot;Pākehā English&quot; as the other main accent, and note that it is beginning to adopt similar rhythms, distinguishing it from other stress-timed English accents.

It is commonly held that New Zealand English is spoken very quickly. This idea is given support by a study comparing adult New Zealand English and American English speakers which observed faster speaking and articulation rates among the New Zealand English group overall. However, a similar study with American and New Zealand English-speaking children found the opposite, with the speaking and articulation rates of the New Zealand children being slower. The same study proposed that differences in the relative number of tense and lax vowels between the two speaker groups may have influenced the speaking and articulation rates.

==Spelling==
* Where there is a difference between British and US spelling (such as &quot;cancelling&quot;/&quot;canceling&quot; and &quot;jewellery&quot;/&quot;jewelry&quot;), the British spelling of double-&quot;L&quot; is universally used. The British use of single-&quot;L&quot; is also universally used in words such as &quot;enrol&quot;.
*New Zealand English prefers the use of &quot;tyres&quot;, not &quot;tires&quot;, except for trademarks such as Cooper Tires.
* The Commonwealth spelling of &quot;kerb&quot; (at roadside) is used over US &quot;curb&quot;.
* New Zealand spelling of &quot;-re&quot; words such as &quot;centre&quot;, &quot;fibre&quot;, &quot;litre&quot;, and &quot;theatre&quot; has always followed the British spelling as opposed to the American &quot;center&quot;, &quot;fiber&quot;, &quot;liter&quot;, and &quot;theater&quot;.
* Nouns with the &quot;-ce&quot; suffix such as &quot;defence&quot; and &quot;licence&quot; are usually spelt with &quot;-ce&quot; as opposed to the American &quot;defense&quot; and &quot;license&quot;.
* With &quot;-our&quot; words like &quot;colour&quot;/&quot;color&quot; or &quot;favour&quot;/&quot;favor&quot; the spelling of &quot;-our&quot; is almost always used except &quot;arbor&quot; in Arbor day or unless it is a trademark, such as Colorsteel or The Color Run.

* New Zealand English retains the distinctions between &quot;program&quot; (&quot;computer heuristic&quot;) and &quot;programme&quot; (&quot;schedule&quot;, &quot;broadcast show&quot;), &quot;disk&quot; (&quot;information storage device&quot;) and &quot;disc&quot; (&quot;flat circular object&quot;), and &quot;analog&quot; (as in &quot;analog stick&quot;) and &quot;analogue&quot; (all other senses) as found in British and often in Australian English.
* It is usual to form past tenses and past participles of certain verbs with &quot;-t&quot; and not &quot;-ed&quot;. For example, &quot;learn&quot; becomes &quot;learnt&quot;, &quot;spoil&quot; becomes &quot;spoilt&quot;, &quot;burn&quot; becomes &quot;burnt&quot;, &quot;dream&quot; becomes &quot;dreamt&quot; , and &quot;smell&quot; becomes &quot;smelt&quot;. These verb forms are pronounced with a final unvoiced sound, meaning &quot;spoilt&quot; is pronounced not . This contrasts with American English, where &quot;-ed&quot; is far more common and is pronounced (e.g. &quot;dwelled&quot; is an American form of &quot;dwelt&quot; ). &quot;Learned&quot;, the adjective meaning &quot;wise&quot;, is universally spelt thus and pronounced as two syllables (). The past tenses and past participles of &quot;earn&quot; and &quot;boil&quot; are &quot;earned&quot; and &quot;boiled&quot; respectively, though they may be pronounced ending with a sound.
* Words with the digraphs &quot;ae&quot; and &quot;oe&quot; in British English are usually spelt as such in New Zealand English (e.g. &quot;faeces&quot; not &quot;feces&quot;) rather than with just &quot;e&quot; as with American English.
* In hyperbolic statements, the spellings of &quot;ton&quot; and &quot;tons&quot; are commonly used (e.g. &quot;I have tons of friends&quot; and &quot;I feel tons better&quot;), despite the metric system with its tonne having been introduced in the 1970s.
* In words that may be spelt with either an &quot;-ise&quot; or an &quot;-ize&quot; suffix (such as &quot;organise&quot;/&quot;organize&quot;) it is acceptable to use either in New Zealand English but &quot;-ise&quot; has taken precedence over several decades. This contrasts with American and Canadian English, where &quot;-ize&quot; is generally preferred, and British English, where &quot;-ise&quot; is also generally preferred. In Australian English &quot;-ise&quot; is strictly used.
* New Zealand favours &quot;fiord&quot; over &quot;fjord&quot;, unlike most other English-speaking countries. The &quot;fiord&quot; spelling was the normal one in English until the early 1920s, and is preserved in many place names worldwide. In New Zealand it is used in Fiordland, a rugged region in the south-west.
* When spelling words borrowed from Māori, New Zealand English can either spell them with macrons or without (e.g. &quot;Maori&quot; and &quot;Māori&quot; are both accepted spellings). Macrons have become more widespread over time.
* Australia and New Zealand always use &quot;jail&quot; over the British &quot;gaol&quot; (which is now considered obsolete, even in the United Kingdom).
* Gram, the unit of mass, is commonly spelt as such and not &quot;gramme&quot;, which is somewhat found in British English. The same holds true for the word&#x27;s derivates (e.g., &quot;kilogram&quot; is more common than &quot;kilogramme&quot;).
* Contractions (i.e. shortened words that retain the final letter of the full word) do not terminate with a full stop. Thus the abbreviation of &quot;Doctor&quot; is &quot;Dr&quot; and that of &quot;Mister&quot; is &quot;Mr&quot;, as opposed to &quot;Dr.&quot; and &quot;Mr.&quot; in American English. Initialisms and acronyms such as &quot;USA&quot; and &quot;NASA&quot; (or &quot;Nasa&quot;) also do not include full stops. This has been the practice in New Zealand since the late 1970s.
Since the advent of word processors with spell-checkers, in modern assignment writing in New Zealand universities the rule is to use either 100% British spelling or 100% American spelling, the emphasis being consistency.

<doc id="21672" wikidata="Q1048747" url="?curid=21672" title="Nucleariida">
<text>Nucleariida is a group of amoebae with pseudopods, known mostly from soils and freshwater. They are distinguished from the superficially similar vampyrellids mainly by having mitochondria with discoid cristae, in the absence of superficial granules, and in the way they consume food.

==Classification==

Molecular studies indicate that nucleariids are closely related to fungi. and more distantly to the lineage that gave rise to choanoflagellates and metazoa opisthokonts, the group which includes animals, fungi. Some use a broad definition of Opisthokonta to include all of these organisms with flattened mitochondrial cristae.

The genera &quot;Rabdiophrys&quot;, &quot;Pinaciophora&quot;, and &quot;Pompholyxophrys&quot;, freshwater forms with hollow siliceous scales or spines, were included in Nucleariida by some. This was disputed by Smith and Chao who placed them in the Rhizaria. Their affinity with the nucleariids has been confirmed. Historically, nucleariids were included among the heliozoa as the Rotosphaerida because both they and heliozoa had rounded bodies and radiating pseudopodia.

According to a 2009 paper, &quot;Fonticula&quot;, a cellular slime mold, is an opisthokont and more closely related to &quot;Nuclearia&quot; than to fungi.

==Characteristics==
Nucleariids (&quot;Nuclearia&quot;) are usually small, up to about 50 μm in size.

<text>North American English (NAmE) encompasses the English language as spoken in both the United States and Canada. Because of their related histories and cultures, plus the similarities between the pronunciations (accents), vocabulary, and grammar of U.S. English and Canadian English, linguists often group the two together. Canadians are generally tolerant of both British and U.S. spellings, although certain words always take British spellings (e.g., &quot;cheque&quot;) and others U.S. spellings (e.g., &quot;tire&quot; rather than &quot;tyre&quot;). 

Dialects of English spoken by United Empire Loyalists who fled the American Revolution (1775–1783) have had a large influence on Canadian English from its early roots. Some terms in North American English are used almost exclusively in Canada and the United States (for example, the terms &quot;diaper&quot; and &quot;gasoline&quot; are widely used instead of &quot;nappy&quot; and &quot;petrol&quot;). Although many English speakers from outside North America regard those terms as distinct Americanisms, they are just as common in Canada, mainly due to the effects of heavy cross-border trade and cultural penetration by the American mass media. The list of divergent words becomes longer if considering regional Canadian dialects, especially as spoken in the Atlantic provinces and parts of Vancouver Island where significant pockets of British culture still remain.

There are a considerable number of different accents within the regions of both the United States and Canada. In North America, different English dialects of immigrants from England, Scotland, Ireland, and other regions of the British Isles mixed together in the 17th and 18th centuries. These were developed, built upon, and blended together as new waves of immigration, and migration across the North American continent, developed new dialects in new areas, and as these ways of speaking merged with and assimilated to the greater American dialect mixture that solidified by the mid-18th century.

===Table of accents===

Below, several major North American English accents are defined by particular characteristics:

==Phonology==

A majority of North American English (for example, in contrast to British English) includes phonological features that concern consonants, such as rhoticity (full pronunciation of all sounds), conditioned T-glottalization (with &quot;satin&quot; pronounced , not ), T- and D-flapping (with &quot;metal&quot; and &quot;medal&quot; pronounced the same, as ), L-velarization (with &quot;filling&quot; pronounced , not ), as well as features that concern vowel sounds, such as various vowel mergers before (so that, &quot;Mary&quot;, &quot;marry&quot;, and &quot;merry&quot; are all commonly pronounced the same), raising of pre-voiceless (with &quot;price&quot; and &quot;bright&quot; using a higher vowel sound than &quot;prize&quot; and &quot;bride&quot;), the weak vowel merger (with &quot;affected&quot; and &quot;effected&quot; often pronounced the same), at least one of the vowel mergers (the – merger is completed among virtually all Americans and the – merger among nearly half, while both are completed among virtually all Canadians), and yod-dropping (with &quot;tuesday&quot; pronounced , not ). The last item is more advanced in American English than Canadian English.

<doc id="21675" wikidata="Q188460" url="?curid=21675" title="Natural resource">
<text>Natural resources are resources that are drawn from nature and used with few modifications. This includes the sources of valued characteristics such as commercial and industrial use, aesthetic value, scientific interest, and cultural value. On Earth, it includes sunlight, atmosphere, water, land, all minerals along with all vegetation, and wildlife.

Natural resources are part of humanity&#x27;s natural heritage or protected in nature reserves. Particular areas (such as the rainforest in Fatu-Hiva) often feature biodiversity and geodiversity in their ecosystems. Natural resources may be classified in different ways. Natural resources are materials and components (something that can be used) found within the environment. Every man-made product is composed of natural resources (at its fundamental level).

A natural resource may exist as a separate entity such as freshwater, air, or any living organism such as a fish, or it may be transformed by extractivist industries into an economically useful form that must be processed to obtain the resource such as metal ores, rare-earth elements, petroleum, timber and most forms of energy. Some resources are renewable, which means that they can be used at a certain rate and natural processes will restore them. In contrast, many extractive industries rely heavily on non-renewable resources that can only be extracted once.

Natural resource allocations can be at the centre of many economic and political confrontations both within and between countries. This is particularly true during periods of increasing scarcity and shortages (depletion and overconsumption of resources). Resource extraction is also a major source of human rights violations and environmental damage. The Sustainable Development Goals and other international development agendas frequently focus on creating more sustainable resource extraction, with some scholars and researchers focused on creating economic models, such as circular economy, that rely less on resource extraction, and more on reuse, recycling and renewable resources that can be sustainably managed.

==Classification==

There are various criteria for classifying natural resources. These include the source of origin, stages of development, renewability and ownership.

===Origin===
* Biotic: Resources that originate from the biosphere and have life such as flora and fauna, fisheries, livestock, etc. Fossil fuels such as coal and petroleum are also included in this category because they are formed from decayed organic matter.
* Abiotic: Resources that originate from non-living and inorganic material. These include land, fresh water, air, rare-earth elements, and heavy metals including ores, such as gold, iron, copper, silver, etc.

===Stage of development===
* Potential resources: Resources that are known to exist, but have not been utilized yet. These may be used in the future. For example, petroleum in sedimentary rocks that, until extracted and put to use, remains a &quot;potential&quot; resource.
* Actual resources: Resources that have been surveyed, quantified and qualified, and are currently used in development. These are typically dependent on technology and the level of their feasibility, wood processing for example.
* Reserves: The part of an actual resource that can be developed profitably in the future.
* Stocks: Resources that have been surveyed, but cannot be used due to lack of technology, hydrogen vehicles for example.

===Renewability/exhaustibility===
* Renewable resources: These resources can be replenished naturally. Some of these resources, like solar energy, air, wind, water, etc. are continuously available and their quantities are not noticeably affected by human consumption. Though many renewable resources do not have such a rapid recovery rate, these resources are susceptible to depletion by over-use. Resources from a human use perspective are classified as renewable so long as the rate of replenishment/recovery exceeds that of the rate of consumption. They replenish easily compared to non-renewable resources.

* Non-renewable resources: These resources are formed over a long geological time period in the environment and cannot be renewed easily. Minerals are the most common resource included in this category. From the human perspective, resources are non-renewable when their rate of consumption exceeds the rate of replenishment/recovery; a good example of this is fossil fuels, which are in this category because their rate of formation is extremely slow (potentially millions of years), meaning they are considered non-renewable. Some resources naturally deplete in amount without human interference, the most notable of these being radio-active elements such as uranium, which naturally decay into heavy metals. Of these, the metallic minerals can be re-used by recycling them, but coal and petroleum cannot be recycled.

===Ownership===
* Individual resources: Resources owned privately by individuals. These include plots, houses, plantations, pastures, ponds, etc.
* Community resources: Resources which are accessible to all the members of a community. E.g.: Cemeteries
* National resources: Resources that belong to the nation. The nation has legal powers to acquire them for public welfare. These also include minerals, forests and wildlife within the political boundaries and Exclusive economic zone.
* International resources: These resources are regulated by international organizations. E.g.: International waters.

== Extraction ==

Resource extraction involves any activity that withdraws resources from nature. This can range in scale from the traditional use of preindustrial societies to global industry. Extractive industries are, along with agriculture, the basis of the primary sector of the economy. Extraction produces raw material, which is then processed to add value. Examples of extractive industries are hunting, trapping, mining, oil and gas drilling, and forestry. Natural resources can be a substantial part of a country&#x27;s wealth; however, a sudden inflow of money caused by a resource extraction boom can create social problems including inflation harming other industries (&quot;Dutch disease&quot;) and corruption, leading to inequality and underdevelopment, this is known as the &quot;resource curse&quot;.

Extractive industries represent a large growing activity in many less-developed countries but the wealth generated does not always lead to sustainable and inclusive growth. People often accuse extractive industry businesses as acting only to maximize short-term value, implying that less-developed countries are vulnerable to powerful corporations. Alternatively, host governments are often assumed to be only maximizing immediate revenue. Researchers argue there are areas of common interest where development goals and business cross. These present opportunities for international governmental agencies to engage with the private sector and host governments through revenue management and expenditure accountability, infrastructure development, employment creation, skills and enterprise development, and impacts on children, especially girls and women. A strong civil society can play an important role in ensuring the effective management of natural resources. Norway can serve as a role model in this regard as it has good institutions and open and dynamic public debate with strong civil society actors that provide an effective checks and balances system for the government&#x27;s management of extractive industries, such as the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), a global standard for the good governance of oil, gas and mineral resources. It seeks to address the key governance issues in the extractive sectors. However, in countries that do not have a very strong and unified society, meaning that there are dissidents who are not as happy with the government as in Norway&#x27;s case, natural resources can actually be a factor in whether a civil war starts and how long the war lasts.

==Depletion==

In recent years, the depletion of natural resources has become a major focus of governments and organizations such as the United Nations (UN). This is evident in the UN&#x27;s Agenda 21 Section Two, which outlines the necessary steps for countries to take to sustain their natural resources. The depletion of natural resources is considered a sustainable development issue. The term &quot;sustainable development&quot; has many interpretations, most notably the Brundtland Commission&#x27;s &#x27;to ensure that it meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs&#x27;; however, in broad terms it is balancing the needs of the planet&#x27;s people and species now and in the future. In regards to natural resources, depletion is of concern for sustainable development as it has the ability to degrade current environments and the potential to impact the needs of future generations.

Depletion of natural resources is associated with social inequity. Considering most biodiversity are located in developing countries, depletion of this resource could result in losses of ecosystem services for these countries. Some view this depletion as a major source of social unrest and conflicts in developing nations.

At present, there is a particular concern for rainforest regions that hold most of the Earth&#x27;s biodiversity. According to Nelson, deforestation and degradation affect 8.5% of the world&#x27;s forests with 30% of the Earth&#x27;s surface already cropped. If we consider that 80% of people rely on medicines obtained from plants and of the world&#x27;s prescription medicines have ingredients taken from plants, loss of the world&#x27;s rainforests could result in a loss of finding more potential life-saving medicines.

The depletion of natural resources is caused by &#x27;direct drivers of change&#x27; such as mining, petroleum extraction, fishing, and forestry as well as &#x27;indirect drivers of change&#x27; such as demography (e.g. population growth), economy, society, politics, and technology. The current practice of agriculture is another factor causing depletion of natural resources. For example, the depletion of nutrients in the soil due to excessive use of nitrogen and desertification.
The depletion of natural resources is a continuing concern for society. This is seen in the cited quote given by Theodore Roosevelt, a well-known conservationist and former United States president, who was opposed to unregulated natural resource extraction.

==Protection==

In 1982, the United Nations developed the World Charter for Nature, which recognized the need to protect nature from further depletion due to human activity. It states that measures must be taken at all societal levels, from international to individual, to protect nature. It outlines the need for sustainable use of natural resources and suggests that the protection of resources should be incorporated into national and international systems of law. To look at the importance of protecting natural resources further, the World Ethic of Sustainability, developed by the IUCN, WWF and the UNEP in 1990, set out eight values for sustainability, including the need to protect natural resources from depletion. Since the development of these documents, many measures have been taken to protect natural resources including establishment of the scientific field and practice of conservation biology and habitat conservation, respectively.

Conservation biology is the scientific study of the nature and status of Earth&#x27;s biodiversity with the aim of protecting species, their habitats, and ecosystems from excessive rates of extinction. It is an interdisciplinary subject drawing on science, economics and the practice of natural resource management. The term &quot;conservation biology&quot; was introduced as the title of a conference held at the University of California, San Diego, in La Jolla, California, in 1978, organized by biologists Bruce A. Wilcox and Michael E. Soulé.

Habitat conservation is a type of land management that seeks to conserve, protect and restore habitat areas for wild plants and animals, especially conservation reliant species, and prevent their extinction, fragmentation or reduction in range.

==Management==
Natural resource management is a discipline in the management of natural resources such as land, water, soil, plants, and animals—with a particular focus on how management affects quality of life for present and future generations. Hence, sustainable development is followed according to the judicious use of resources to supply present and future generations. The disciplines of fisheries, forestry, and wildlife are examples of large subdisciplines of natural resource management.

Management of natural resources involves identifying who has the right to use the resources and who does not to define the management boundaries of the resource. The resources may be managed by the users according to the rules governing when and how the resource is used depending on local condition or the resources may be managed by a governmental organization or other central authority.

A &quot;...successful management of natural resources depends on freedom of speech, a dynamic and wide-ranging public debate through multiple independent media channels and an active civil society engaged in natural resource issues...&quot; because of the nature of the shared resources, the individuals who are affected by the rules can participate in setting or changing them. The users have rights to devise their own management institutions and plans under the recognition by the government. The right to resources includes land, water, fisheries, and pastoral rights. The users or parties accountable to the users have to actively monitor and ensure the utilisation of the resource compliance with the rules and impose penalties on those people who violate the rules. These conflicts are resolved quickly and efficiently by the local institution according to the seriousness and context of the offense. The global science-based platform to discuss natural resources management is the World Resources Forum, based in Switzerland.

<doc id="21683" wikidata="Q233937" url="?curid=21683" title="Nancy Sinatra">
<text>Nancy Sandra Sinatra (born June 8, 1940) is an American singer, actress, film producer and author. She is the elder daughter of Frank Sinatra and Nancy Sinatra ( Barbato) and is known for her 1965 signature hit &quot;These Boots Are Made for Walkin&#x27;.

Nancy Sinatra began her career as a singer in November 1957 with an appearance on her father&#x27;s ABC television variety series &quot;The Frank Sinatra Show&quot; but initially achieved success only in Europe and Japan. In early 1966 she had a transatlantic number-one hit with &quot;These Boots Are Made for Walkin. A TV promo clip from the era features Sinatra in high boots, accompanied by colorfully dressed go-go dancers, in what is now considered an iconic Swinging Sixties look. The song was written by Lee Hazlewood, who wrote and produced most of her hits and sang with her on several duets. As with all of Sinatra&#x27;s 1960s hits, &quot;Boots&quot; featured Billy Strange as arranger and conductor.

Between early 1966 and early 1968, Sinatra charted on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hot 100 with 14 titles, 10 of which reached the Top 40. In addition to &quot;These Boots Are Made for Walkin, defining recordings during this period include &quot;Sugar Town&quot;, &quot;Love Eyes&quot;, the transatlantic 1967 number one &quot;Somethin&#x27; Stupid&quot; (a duet with her father), two versions of the title song from the James Bond film &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; (1967), several collaborations with Lee Hazlewood – including &quot;Summer Wine&quot;, &quot;Jackson&quot;, &quot;Lady Bird&quot; and &quot;Some Velvet Morning&quot; – and a non-single 1966 cover of the Cher hit &quot;Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)&quot;, which features in the opening credits of Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s 2003 film &quot;Kill Bill Volume 1&quot;. In 1971 Sinatra and Hazlewood achieved their first collaborative success in the UK singles chart with the no. 2 hit &quot;Did You Ever?&quot;, and the 2005 UK no. 3 hit by Audio Bullys, &quot;Shot You Down&quot;, sampled Sinatra&#x27;s version of &quot;Bang Bang&quot;.

Between 1964 and 1968, Sinatra appeared in several feature films, co-starring with Peter Fonda in Roger Corman&#x27;s biker-gang movie &quot;The Wild Angels&quot; (1966) and alongside Elvis Presley in the musical drama &quot;Speedway&quot; (1968). Frank and Nancy Sinatra played a fictional father and daughter in the 1965 comedy &quot;Marriage on the Rocks&quot;.

==Early life==
Sinatra was born on June 8, 1940, in Jersey City, New Jersey. She is the eldest of the three children born to Frank Sinatra and his first wife, Nancy Barbato. Both of her parents were of Italian ancestry. When she was a toddler, the family moved to Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey. They later moved again to Toluca Lake, California, for her father&#x27;s Hollywood career. There she spent many years in piano, dance and dramatic performance lessons, and undertook months of voice lessons.

Stefanie Powers was one of Sinatra&#x27;s schoolmates at Hollywood High School. She graduated from University High School (Los Angeles) in June 1958.

==Career==
===1950s and 1960s===
Sinatra began to study music, dancing and voice at UCLA in the late 1950s, but she dropped out after one year. She made her professional debut on her father&#x27;s television show &quot;The Frank Sinatra Show&quot; in November 1957 and then appeared on his 1960 television special &quot;The Frank Sinatra Timex Show: Welcome Home Elvis&quot;, which celebrated the return of Elvis Presley from Europe following his discharge from military service. Nancy was sent to the airport on behalf of her father to welcome Presley when his plane landed. On the special, Sinatra and her father danced and sang a duet, &quot;You Make Me Feel So Young/Old&quot;. That same year, she began a five-year marriage to Tommy Sands.

Sinatra was signed to her father&#x27;s label, Reprise Records, in 1961. Her first single, &quot;Cuff Links and a Tie Clip,&quot; went largely unnoticed. However, subsequent singles charted in Europe and Japan. By 1965, without a hit in the United States, she was on the verge of being dropped by the label. Her singing career received a boost with the help of songwriter/producer/arranger Lee Hazlewood, who had been making records for ten years, notably with Duane Eddy. Hazlewood&#x27;s collaboration with Sinatra began when Frank Sinatra asked Lee to help boost his daughter&#x27;s career. When recording &quot;These Boots Are Made for Walkin&#x27;, Hazlewood is said to have suggested to Nancy, &quot;You can&#x27;t sing like Nancy Nice Lady anymore. You have to sing for the truckers.&quot; She later described him as &quot;part Henry Higgins and part Sigmund Freud&quot;.

Hazlewood had Sinatra sing in a lower key and crafted songs for her. Bolstered by an image overhaulincluding bleached-blond hair, frosted lips, heavy eye makeup and Carnaby Street fashionsSinatra made her mark on the American (and British) music scene in early 1966 with &quot;These Boots Are Made for Walkin&#x27;, its title inspired by a line from Robert Aldrich&#x27;s 1963 western comedy &quot;4 for Texas&quot;, starring her father and Dean Martin. One of her many hits written by Hazlewood, it received three Grammy Award nominations at the 9th Annual Grammy Awards, including two for Sinatra and one for arranger Billy Strange. It sold more than one million copies and was awarded a gold disc. A TV promotional clip featured Sinatra in high boots, accompanied by colorfully dressed go-go dancers, to iconic Swinging Sixties effect.

A run of chart singles followed, including two 1966 US Top Ten hits: &quot;How Does That Grab You, Darlin&#x27;?&quot; (no. 7) and &quot;Sugar Town&quot; (no. 5). &quot;Sugar Town&quot; became Sinatra&#x27;s second million-seller. The ballad &quot;Somethin&#x27; Stupid&quot; – a duet with her father – reached number one in the US and the UK in April 1967 and spent nine weeks at the top of &quot;Billboard&quot;″s easy listening chart. Frank and Nancy became the only father-daughter duo to top the Hot 100, but DJs dubbed the track &quot;the incest song&quot; because it was sung as if by two lovers. The record earned a Grammy Award nomination for Record of the Year at the 10th Annual Grammy Awards and remains the only father-daughter duet to hit number one in the US; it became Nancy&#x27;s third million-selling disc.

Other singles showcasing Sinatra&#x27;s forthright delivery include &quot;Friday&#x27;s Child&quot; (US no. 36, 1966) and the 1967 hits &quot;Love Eyes&quot; (US no. 15) and &quot;Lightning&#x27;s Girl&quot; (US no. 24). She rounded out 1967 with the low-charting &quot;Tony Rome&quot; (US no. 83), the title track from the detective film &quot;Tony Rome&quot; starring her father. Her first solo single in 1968 was the more wistful &quot;100 Years&quot; (US no. 69). That same year she recorded &quot;Highway Song&quot;, written by Kenny Young and produced by Mickie Most, for the European markets. The song reached the Top 20 in the UK and other European countries.
Sinatra enjoyed a parallel recording career cutting duets with the husky-voiced, country-and-western-inspired Hazlewood, starting with &quot;Summer Wine&quot; (originally the B-side of &quot;Sugar Town&quot;). Their biggest hit was a cover of the 1963 country song &quot;Jackson&quot;. The single peaked at no. 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the summer of 1967, just a few months after Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash hit big on the country chart with their cover of the song.

In December 1967 Sinatra and Hazlewood released the single &quot;Some Velvet Morning&quot; (US no. 26), accompanied by a promo clip. The recording is regarded as one of pop&#x27;s more unusual singles; critic Cathi Unsworth wrote, &quot;The puzzle of its lyrics and otherworldly beauty of its sound [offer] seemingly endless interpretations.&quot; The British broadsheet &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; placed &quot;Some Velvet Morning&quot; atop its 2003 list of the Top 50 Best Duets Ever (&quot;Somethin&#x27; Stupid&quot; ranked no. 27.) The song appeared on the duo&#x27;s 1968 album &quot;Nancy &amp; Lee&quot;, about which National Public Radio commented in 2017, &quot;... its sly, sultry movements both are a gem of traditional &#x27;60s pop and an inversion of traditional conceptions of romance.&quot;

Sinatra recorded the theme song for the James Bond film &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; in 1967. In the liner notes of the CD reissue of her 1966 album &quot;Nancy In London&quot;, Sinatra states that she was &quot;scared to death&quot; of recording the song, and asked the songwriters Leslie Bricusse and John Barry: &quot;Are you sure you don&#x27;t want Shirley Bassey?&quot; There are two versions of the Bond theme. The first is the lushly orchestrated track featured during the opening and closing credits of the film. The secondand more guitar-heavyversion appeared on the double A-sided single with &quot;Jackson&quot;, though the Bond theme stalled at no. 44 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Jackson&quot;/&quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; was even more successful in the UK, reaching no. 11 on the singles chart during a 19-week chart run (in the Top 50); it ranked 70 in the year-end chart.

Sinatra traveled to Vietnam to perform for US troops in 1966 and 1967. Many soldiers adopted her song &quot;These Boots Are Made for Walkin as their anthem, as shown in Pierre Schoendoerffer&#x27;s documentary &quot;The Anderson Platoon&quot; (1967) and reprised in a scene in Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; (1987). Sinatra recorded several antiwar songs, including &quot;My Buddy&quot;, which was featured on her album &quot;Sugar&quot;, &quot;Home&quot;, co-written by Mac Davis and &quot;It&#x27;s Such a Lonely Time of Year&quot;, which appeared on the 1968 LP &quot;The Sinatra Family Wish You a Merry Christmas&quot;. Sinatra recreated her Vietnam concert appearances on a 1988 episode of the television show &quot;China Beach&quot;. Sinatra still performs for charitable causes supporting Vietnam veterans, including Rolling Thunder.

====Films and television====
Sinatra played a secretary in the 1963 &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot; episode &quot;Who Killed Wade Walker?&quot; She starred in three beach party films: &quot;For Those Who Think Young&quot; (1964), &quot;Get Yourself a College Girl&quot; (1964) and &quot;The Ghost in the Invisible Bikini&quot; (1966), performing songs in the latter film. After securing the role that eventually went to Linda Evans in &quot;Beach Blanket Bingo&quot;, she withdrew because the film&#x27;s character is kidnappeda parallel she found too close to actual events when her brother Frank Sinatra Jr. was kidnapped in December 1963.

Sinatra appeared as a guest with Woody Allen on the game show &quot;Password&quot; in 1965. She appeared as herself in &quot;The Oscar&quot; (1966), and also starred in &quot;The Last of the Secret Agents?&quot;, in which she sang the title song, and &quot;The Wild Angels&quot; the same year. She appeared in the 1968 Elvis Presley musical comedy &quot;Speedway&quot;, her final film.

Sinatra appeared on &quot;The Virginian&quot;, &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;, &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;, &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot;, and &quot;The Kraft Music Hall&quot;, hosted by Sandler &amp; Young. She also appeared in her father&#x27;s 1966 special &quot;A Man and His Music – Part II&quot; and a 1967 Christmas-themed episode of &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot; which featured the Sinatra and Martin families.

NBC aired Sinatra&#x27;s own special, &quot;Movin&#x27; with Nancy&quot;, in 1967. It featured Lee Hazlewood, her father and his Rat Pack pals Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr., her brother Frank Sinatra Jr. and &quot;West Side Story&quot; dancer David Winters, who choreographed the show. Jack Haley Jr. directed and produced the special, for which he received an Emmy Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Music or Variety at the 20th Primetime Emmy Awards. During the special, Sinatra shared a kiss with Davis Jr., about which she has stated, &quot;The kiss [was] one of the first interracial kisses seen on television and it caused some controversy then, and now. [But] contrary to some inaccurate online reports, the kiss was unplanned and spontaneous.&quot; Winters was nominated for an Emmy in the Special Classification of Individual Achievements category for his choreography but lost to co-winners &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot; and &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot;. The special&#x27;s success may have been a motivating factor for the development of the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Choreography, which was introduced the following year. &quot;Movin&#x27; With Nancy&quot; was sponsored by RC Cola.

===1970s and 1980s===
Sinatra remained with Reprise until 1970. In 1971, she signed with RCA Records, resulting in three albums: &quot;Nancy &amp; Lee – Again&quot; (1971), &quot;Woman&quot; (1972) and a compilation of some of her Reprise recordings called &quot;This Is Nancy Sinatra&quot; (1973). She released the non-LP single &quot;Sugar Me&quot; b/w &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Sunshine&quot; in 1973. &quot;Sugar Me&quot; was written by Lynsey De Paul and Barry Blue and, with other covers of works by early-&#x27;70s popular songwriters, resurfaced on the 1998 album &quot;How Does It Feel?&quot;

In the autumn of 1971, Sinatra and Hazlewood&#x27;s duet &quot;Did You Ever?&quot; reached no. 2 in the UK In 1972 they performed for a Swedish documentary, &quot;Nancy &amp; Lee In Las Vegas&quot;, which chronicled their Las Vegas concerts at the Riviera Hotel and Casino and featured solo numbers and duets from concerts, behind-the-scenes footage and scenes of Sinatra&#x27;s mother and her husband, Hugh Lambert. The film did not appear until 1975.

By 1975, Sinatra was releasing singles on the Private Stock Records label. Among the singles were &quot;Kinky Love&quot;, &quot;Annabell of Mobile&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s for My Dad&quot; and &quot;Indian Summer&quot; (with Hazlewood). &quot;Kinky Love&quot; was banned by some radio stations for its suggestive lyrics. It appeared on &quot;Sheet Music: A Collection of Her Favorite Love Songs&quot; in 1998, and Pale Saints covered the song in 1991.

By the mid-1970s, Sinatra had slowed her musical activity and ceased acting to concentrate on her family. She returned to the studio in 1981 to record a country album with Mel Tillis called &quot;Mel &amp; Nancy&quot;. Two of their songs made the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart: &quot;Texas Cowboy Night&quot; (no.. 23) and &quot;Play Me or Trade Me&quot; (no. 43).

In 1985, Sinatra wrote the book &quot;Frank Sinatra, My Father&quot;.

===1990s–present===

At 54, Sinatra posed for &quot;Playboy&quot; in the May 1995 issue and made appearances on TV shows to promote her album &quot;One More Time&quot;. The magazine appearance caused some controversy. On the talk-show circuit, she said that her father was proud of the photos. Sinatra told Jay Leno on a 1995 &quot;Tonight Show&quot; that her daughters gave their approval, but her mother said that she should ask her father before committing to the project. Sinatra said that when she told her father what &quot;Playboy&quot; would be paying her, he said, &quot;Double it&quot;.

In 1995, Nancy wrote the book &quot;Frank Sinatra, An American Legend&quot;. This was followed by an updated version in 1998 following Frank&#x27;s death.

Taking her father&#x27;s advice to own her masters, Sinatra owns or holds an interest in most of her material, including videos. Sinatra appeared live at the Edinburgh International Festival in August 2002. The sold-out, one-off concert was filmed by the BBC and later aired on BBC Four. She collaborated with former Los Angeles neighbor Morrissey on a 2004 version of his song &quot;Let Me Kiss You&quot;, which was featured on her album &quot;Nancy Sinatra&quot;. The singlereleased the same day as Morrissey&#x27;s versioncharted at no. 46 in the UK, providing Sinatra with her first hit in more than 30 years. The follow-up single, &quot;Burnin&#x27; Down the Spark,&quot; failed to chart. The album featured U2, Sonic Youth, Calexico, Pete Yorn, Jon Spencer, Pulp&#x27;s Jarvis Cocker and Steven Van Zandt, all of whom have cited Sinatra as an influence. Each artist crafted a song for Sinatra to sing on the album. EMI released &quot;The Essential Nancy Sinatra&quot;, a UK-only greatest-hits compilation featuring the previously unreleased track &quot;Machine Gun Kelly&quot;, in 2006. The album was Sinatra&#x27;s first to make the UK charts (no. 73) since 1971&#x27;s &quot;Did You Ever?&quot; reached no. 31. Sinatra recorded &quot;Another Gay Sunshine Day&quot; for &quot;Another Gay Movie&quot; in 2006.

Sinatra received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on May 11, 2006. A Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars was dedicated to her in 2002.

Sinatra appeared as herself on one of the final episodes (&quot;Chasing It&quot;) of the HBO mob drama &quot;The Sopranos&quot;. Her brother Frank Jr. had previously appeared in the 2000 episode &quot;The Happy Wanderer&quot;. Sinatra and Anoushka Shankar recorded a 2007 public-service announcement for Deejay Ra&#x27;s Hip-Hop Literacy campaign, encouraging reading of music and film-related books and screenplays. Sinatra&#x27;s digital-only album &quot;Cherry Smiles: The Rare Singles&quot;, featuring previously unreleased tracks and songs only available as singles, was released in 2009. She released the 2013 digital-only album &quot;Shifting Gears&quot;, featuring 15 previously unreleased tracks, including a rendition of Neil Diamond&#x27;s &quot;Holly Holy&quot;. The orchestra tracks were recorded in the 1970s while Sinatra was touring with a 40-piece orchestra, and her vocal tracks were recorded within 10 years of the release of the collection. Sinatra&#x27;s 1967 hit duet with Lee Hazlewood, &quot;Summer Wine&quot;, was featured in retail apparel giant H&amp;M&#x27;s &quot;The Summer Shop 2017&quot; ad campaign.

In October 2020, Sinatra and Light in the Attic Records announced plans to release the Nancy Sinatra Archival Series. The first release was a Record Store Day Black Friday exclusive 7&quot; vinyl single featuring two Sinatra/Hazlewood duets, &quot;Some Velvet Morning&quot; and &quot;Tired of Waiting for You&quot;. A new 23-track compilation, &quot;Start Walkin&#x27; 1965–1976&quot;, followed in February 2021. The first single, a remastered reissue of Nancy &amp; Lee&#x27;s 1976 Private Stock single &quot;(L&#x27;été Indien) Indian Summer&quot;, was released as a digital exclusive on October 21, 2020. Some of Sinatra&#x27;s past albums were issued on CD for the first time, including her first record with Hazlewood, 1968&#x27;s &quot;Nancy &amp; Lee&quot;, and its follow-up, 1972&#x27;s &quot;Nancy &amp; Lee Again&quot;. Sinatra&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Boots&quot;, was reissued on vinyl, picture disc, compact disc, 4-track, 8-track, and digital by Light In The Attic Records on September 17, 2021. The second wave of the Nancy Sinatra Archival Series kicked off on September 29, 2023 with the digital release of a new 25-song compilation &quot;Keep Walkin&#x27;: Singles, Demos &amp; Rarities 1965-1978.&quot; Physical release followed on October 20, 2023. Sinatra participated in her first YouTube live chat on November 2, 2023.

<text>New Amsterdam (, ) was a 17th-century Dutch settlement established at the southern tip of Manhattan Island that served as the seat of the colonial government in New Netherland. The initial trading &quot;factory&quot; gave rise to the settlement around Fort Amsterdam. The fort was situated on the strategic southern tip of the island of Manhattan and was meant to defend the fur trade operations of the Dutch West India Company in the North River (Hudson River). In 1624, it became a provincial extension of the Dutch Republic and was designated as the capital of the province in 1625. New Amsterdam became a city when it received municipal rights on February 2, 1653.

By 1655, the population of New Netherland had grown to 9000 Dutch 
people, with 1,500 living in New Amsterdam. By 1664, the population of New Netherland had risen to almost 9,000 people, 2,500 of whom lived in New Amsterdam, 1,000 lived near Fort Orange, and the remainder in other towns and villages.

In 1664, the English took over New Amsterdam and renamed it New York after the Duke of York (later James II &amp; VII). After the Second Anglo-Dutch War of 1665–67, England and the United Provinces of the Netherlands agreed to the status quo in the Treaty of Breda. The English kept the island of Manhattan, the Dutch giving up their claim to New Amsterdam and the rest of the colony, while the English formally abandoned Surinam in South America, and the island of Run in the East Indies to the Dutch, confirming their control of the valuable Spice Islands. The area occupied by New Amsterdam is now Lower Manhattan.

== Etymology ==
The indigenous Munsee term for the southern tip of the island was Manhattoe, and variations of this name were also applied to the first Dutch settlement there. With the construction of Fort Amsterdam, the town also became variously known as &quot;Amsterdam&quot; or &quot;New Amsterdam&quot;. New Amsterdam&#x27;s city limits did not extend north of the wall of Wall Street, and neither the remainder of the island of Manhattan nor of wider New Netherland fell under its definition.

==History==
===Early exploration and settlement (1609–1624)===
In 1524, nearly a century before the arrival of the Dutch, the site that would later become New Amsterdam was named Nouvelle Angoulême by the Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano, to commemorate his patron King Francis I of France, whose family consisted of the Counts of Angoulême. The first recorded exploration by the Dutch of the area around what is now called New York Bay was in 1609 with the voyage of the ship &quot;Halve Maen&quot; (English: &quot;Half Moon&quot;), commanded by Henry Hudson in the service of the Dutch Republic, as the emissary of Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange and stadholder of Holland. Hudson named the river the Mauritius River. He was also covertly attempting to find the Northwest Passage for the Dutch East India Company. Instead, he brought back news about the possibility of exploitation of beaver by the Dutch who sent commercial, private missions to the area the following years.

At the time, beaver pelts were highly prized in Europe, because the fur could be felted to make waterproof hats. A by-product of the trade in beaver pelts was castoreum—the secretion of the animals&#x27; anal glands—which was used for its medicinal properties and for perfumes. The expeditions by Adriaen Block and Hendrick Christiaensen in 1611, 1612, 1613 and 1614, resulted in the surveying and charting of the region from the 38th parallel to the 45th parallel. On their 1614 map, which gave them a four-year trade monopoly under a patent of the States General, they named the newly discovered and mapped territory New Netherland for the first time. It also showed the first year-round trading presence in New Netherland, Fort Nassau, which would be replaced in 1624 by Fort Orange, which eventually grew into the town of Beverwijck, renamed Albany in 1664.

Spanish trader Juan Rodriguez (rendered in Dutch as Jan Rodrigues), was born in the Captaincy General of Santo Domingo, the first Spanish Colony in the Americas. Allegedly of Portuguese and African descent, he arrived on Manhattan Island during the winter of 1613–1614 under the command of Thijs Volckenz Mossel captain of the &quot;Jonge Tobias&quot;, trapping beavers and trading with the local population as a representative of the Dutch East India Company. He is the first recorded non-Indigenous inhabitant of what would eventually become New York City.

The territory of New Netherland was originally a private, profit-making commercial enterprise focused on cementing alliances and conducting trade with the local Indigenous peoples. Surveying and exploration of the region was conducted as a prelude to an anticipated official settlement by the Dutch Republic, which occurred in 1624.

====Pilgrims&#x27; attempt to settle in the Hudson River area====

In 1620 the Pilgrims attempted to sail to the Hudson River from England. However, &quot;Mayflower&quot; reached Cape Cod (now part of Massachusetts) on November 9, 1620, after a voyage of 64 days. For a variety of reasons, primarily a shortage of supplies, &quot;Mayflower&quot; could not proceed to the Hudson River, and the colonists decided to settle near Cape Cod, establishing the Plymouth Colony.

====Dutch return====

The mouth of the Hudson River was selected as the ideal place for initial settlement as it had easy access to the ocean while also securing an ice-free lifeline to the beaver trading post near present-day Albany. Here, Indigenous hunters supplied them with pelts in exchange for European-made trade goods and wampum, which was soon being made by the Dutch on Long Island. In 1621, the Dutch West India Company was founded. Between 1621 and 1623, orders were given to the private, commercial traders to vacate the territory, thus opening up the territory to Dutch settlers and company traders. It also allowed the laws and ordinances of the states of Holland to apply. Previously, during the private, commercial period, only the law of the ship had applied.

On May 20, 1624, the first settlers in New Netherland arrived on Noten Eylandt (Nut or Nutten Island, now Governors Island) aboard the ship &quot;Nieu Nederlandt&quot; under the command of Cornelius Jacobsen May, who disembarked on the island with thirty families to take legal possession of the New Netherland territory. The landing on Governors Island in 1624 brought with it the &quot;legal and cultural DNA&quot; of the Republic of the United Netherlands, including progressive values such as freedom of conscience and tolerance, which were foundational to the culture of early New Netherland. Compared to many parts of Europe at that time, New Netherland embraced a relatively progressive philosophy of inclusion, allowing various nationalities, religions, and races to coexist. The ideals of popular sovereignty and free trade formed the backbone of this diverse society, setting it apart from other colonial powers. However, despite these advanced ideals, the colony also engaged in practices that reflected the broader colonial context, such as the mistreatment of Indigenous populations and the introduction of slavery in 1626. These actions show that while the early settlers were ahead of their time in embracing tolerance, they were also part of the colonial systems that perpetuated injustice and exploitation. The WIC ordered engineer and surveyor Crijn Fredericxsz for the construction of Fort Amsterdam. A fortification was completed in 1626.

The families were then dispersed to Fort Wilhelmus on Verhulsten Island (Burlington Island) in the South River (now the Delaware River), to Kievitshoek (now Old Saybrook, Connecticut) at the mouth of the Verse River (now the Connecticut River) and further north at Fort Nassau on the Mauritius or North River (now the Hudson River), near what is now Albany.

A fort and sawmill were soon erected at Nut Island. The windmill was constructed by Franchoys Fezard and was taken apart for iron in 1648.

===Fort Amsterdam (1624)===


The threat of attack from other European colonial powers prompted the directors of the Dutch West India Company to formulate a plan to protect the entrance to the Hudson River. In 1624, 30 families were sponsored by Dutch West India Company moving from Nut Island to Manhattan Island, where a citadel to contain Fort Amsterdam was being laid out by Cryn Frederickz van Lobbrecht at the direction of Willem Verhulst. By the end of 1625, the site had been staked out directly south of Bowling Green on the site of the present U.S. Custom House. The Mohawk-Mahican War in the Hudson Valley led the company to relocate even more settlers to the vicinity of the new Fort Amsterdam. In the end, colonizing was a prohibitively expensive undertaking, only partly subsidized by the fur trade. This led to a scaling back of the original plans. By 1628, a smaller fort was constructed with walls containing a mixture of clay and sand.

The fort also served as the center of trading activity. It contained a barracks, the church, a house for the West India Company director and a warehouse for the storage of company goods. Troops from the fort used the triangle between the &quot;Heerestraat&quot; and what came to be known as Whitehall Street for marching drills.

===1624–1664===

Verhulst, with his council, was responsible for the selection of Manhattan as a permanent place of settlement and for situating Fort Amsterdam. He was replaced as the company director of New Netherland by Peter Minuit in 1626. According to the writer Nathaniel Benchley, to legally safeguard the settlers&#x27; investments, possessions and farms on Manhattan island, Minuit negotiated the &quot;purchase&quot; of Manhattan from a band of Canarse from Brooklyn who occupied the bottom quarter of Manhattan, known then as the Manhattoes, for 60 guilders&#x27; worth of trade goods. Minuit conducted the transaction with the Canarse chief Seyseys, who was only too happy to accept valuable merchandise in exchange for an island that was actually mostly controlled by the Weckquaesgeeks.

An official letter of November 7, 1626 in which Pieter Schagen informed the States General of the purchase (by Peter Minuit) of Manhattan (&quot;&#x27;t eylant Manhettes&quot;, groot 11000 morgen) from the &quot;wilden&quot; (wild ones). This area amounts to . Schagen also mentioned the successful first harvest and the shipload of 7,246 beaver skins (Nationaal Archief, The Hague). For a transcription of the text, see Schagenbrief and Transcriptie Schagenbrief

The deed itself has not survived, so the specific details are unknown. A textual reference to the deed became the foundation for the legend that Minuit had purchased Manhattan from the Native Americans for twenty-four dollars&#x27; worth of trinkets and beads, the guilder rate at the time being about two and a half to a Spanish dollar. The price of 60 Dutch guilders in 1626 amounts to around $1,100 in 2012 dollars. Further complicating the calculation is that the value of goods in the area would have been different from the value of those same goods in the developed market of the Netherlands.

The Dutch introduced windmills first at &quot;Noten Eylandt&quot; for a sawmill, to exploit the stand of hardwoods found there. Later they exploited the hydropower of existing creeks by constructing mills at Turtle Bay (between present-day East 45th–48th Streets) and Montagne&#x27;s Kill, later called Harlem Mill Creek (East 108th Street). In 1639 a sawmill was located in the northern forest at what was later the corner of East 74th Street and Second Avenue, at which African slaves cut lumber.
The New Amsterdam settlement had a population of approximately 270 people, including infants. In 1642 the new director Willem Kieft decided to build a stone church within the fort. The work was carried out by recent English immigrants, the brothers John and Richard Ogden. The church was finished in 1645 and stood until destroyed in the Slave Insurrection of 1741.

A pen-and-ink view of New Amsterdam, drawn on-the-spot and discovered in the map collection of the Austrian National Library in Vienna in 1991, provides a unique view of New Amsterdam as it appeared from Capske (small Cape) Rock in 1648. It was associated with Adriaen van der Donck&#x27;s &quot;Remonstrance of New Netherland&quot;, and may have inspired later views as by Claes Jansz. Visscher. Capske Rock was situated in the water close to Manhattan between Manhattan and Noten Eylant, and signified the start of the East River roadstead.

New Amsterdam received municipal rights by a charter from New Netherland Governor Peter Stuyvesant on February 2, 1653, thus becoming a city.

Albany, then named &quot;Beverwyck&quot;, received its city rights in 1652. &quot;Nieuw Haarlem&quot;, now known as Harlem, was formally recognized in 1658.

The first Dutch Jews known to have arrived in New Amsterdam arrived in 1654. First to arrive were Solomon Pietersen and Jacob Barsimson, who sailed during the summer of 1654 directly from Holland, with passports that gave them permission to trade in the colony. Then in early September, 23 Jewish refugees arrived from the Brazilian city of Recife, which had been conquered by the Portuguese in January 1654. The director-general of New Netherland, Peter Stuyvesant, sought to turn them away but was ultimately overruled by the directors of the Dutch West India Company in Amsterdam. Asser Levy, an Ashkenazi Jew who was one of the 23 refugees, eventually prospered and in 1661 became the first Jew to own a house in New Amsterdam, which also made him the first Jew known to have owned a house anywhere in North America.

On September 15, 1655, New Amsterdam was occupied by several hundred Munsee, possibly in response to a Dutch colonist killing a woman stealing peaches from his orchard. No bloodshed occurred until the Munsee were fired upon as they were preparing to depart. This triggered attacks on Pavonia and Staten Island. Stuyvesant reported 28 farms destroyed, 40 deaths and 100 captives taken in what later became known as the Peach War.

In 1661, the Communipaw ferry was founded and began a long history of trans-Hudson ferry and ultimately rail and road transportation.

In 1664, Jan van Bonnel built a Saw mill on East 74th Street and the East River, where a long stream that began in the north of today&#x27;s Central Park, which became known as the Saw Kill or Saw Kill Creek, emptied into the river. Later owners of the property George Elphinstone and Abraham Shotwell replaced the sawmill with a leather mill in 1677. The Saw Kill was later redirected into a culvert, arched over, and its trickling little stream was called Arch Brook.

===English capture===
On August 27, 1664, while England and the Dutch Republic were at peace, four English frigates sailed into New Amsterdam&#x27;s harbor and demanded New Netherland&#x27;s surrender, effecting the bloodless capture of New Amsterdam. On September 6, the local Dutch deciding not to offer resistance, Stuyvesant&#x27;s lawyer Johannes de Decker and five other delegates signed the official Articles of Surrender of New Netherland. This was swiftly followed by the Second Anglo-Dutch War, between England and the Dutch Republic. In June 1665, New Amsterdam was reincorporated under English law as New York City, named after the Duke of York (later King James II). He was the brother of King Charles II, who had been granted the lands.

In 1667, the Treaty of Breda ended the conflict in favor of the Dutch. The Dutch did not press their claims on New Netherland but did demand control over the valuable sugar plantations and factories captured by them that year on the coast of Surinam, giving them full control over the coast of what is now Guyana and Suriname.

On 9 August 1673 (N.S.; 30 July 1673 (O.S.)), during the Third Anglo-Dutch War, the Dutch quickly but briefly retook the colony of New Netherland, which the English called &quot;New York&quot;, with a combined fleet of a squadron of ships from Amsterdam and a squadron of ships from Zeeland. The commanders were Jacob Benckes (Koudum, 1637–1677) and Cornelis Evertsen de Jongste (Vlissingen, 1642–1706) under instruction of the States General of the Dutch Republic. Anthony Colve was installed as the first Dutch governor of the province. Previously there had only been West India Company Directors and a Director-General.

Amidst the recapture, New York City would be again renamed, this time to New Orange. However, after the signing of the Treaty of Westminster in February 1674, both the Dutch territories were relinquished to the English. With the effective transfer of control on 10 November 1674 (N.S.), the names New Netherland and New Orange reverted to the English versions of &quot;New York&quot; and &quot;New York City&quot;, respectively. Suriname became an official Dutch possession in return.

==Cartography==
The beginnings of New Amsterdam, unlike most other colonies in the New World, were thoroughly documented in city maps. During the time of New Netherland&#x27;s colonization, the Dutch were the pre-eminent cartographers in Europe. The delegated authority of the Dutch West India Company over New Netherland required maintaining sovereignty on behalf of the States General, generating cash flow through commercial enterprise for its shareholders, and funding the province&#x27;s growth. Thus its directors regularly required that censuses be taken. These tools to measure and monitor the province&#x27;s progress were accompanied by accurate maps and plans. These surveys, as well as grassroots activities to seek redress of grievances, account for the existence of some of the most important of the early documents.

There is a particularly detailed city map called the Castello Plan produced in 1660. Virtually every structure in New Amsterdam at the time is believed to be represented, and by cross-referencing the &quot;Nicasius de Sille List&quot; of 1660, which enumerates all the citizens of New Amsterdam and their addresses, it can be determined who resided in every house.

The city map known as the Duke&#x27;s Plan probably derived from the same 1660 census as the Castello Plan. The Duke&#x27;s Plan includes two outlying areas of development on Manhattan along the top of the plan. The work was created for James (1633–1701), the Duke of York and Albany, after whom New York, New York City, and New York&#x27;s Capital – Albany, were named just after the seizure of New Amsterdam by the English. After that provisional relinquishment of New Netherland, Stuyvesant reported to his superiors that he &quot;had endeavored to promote the increase of population, agriculture and commerce...the flourishing condition which might have been more flourishing if the now afflicted inhabitants had been protected by a suitable garrison...and had been helped with the long sought for settlement of the boundary, or in default thereof had they been seconded with the oft besought reinforcement of men and ships against the continual troubles, threats, encroachments and invasions of the British neighbors and government of Hartford Colony, our too powerful enemies&quot;.

The existence of these city maps has proven to be very useful in the archaeology of New York City. For instance, the Castello map aided the excavation of the Stadthuys (City Hall) of New Amsterdam in determining the exact location of the building.

===Layout===
The maps enable a precise reconstruction of the town. Fort Amsterdam was located at the southernmost tip of the island of Manhattan, which today is surrounded by Bowling Green. The Battery is a reference to its battery of cannon.

Broadway was the main street that led out of town north towards Harlem. The town was surrounded to the north by a wall leading from the eastern to the western shore. Today, where the course of this city wall was, is Wall Street. Nearby, a canal which led from the harbor inland was filled in 1676, and is today Broad Street.

The layout of the streets was winding, as in a European city. Only starting from Wall Street going toward uptown did the typical grid become enforced long after the town ceased to be Dutch. Most of the Financial District overlaps with New Amsterdam and has retained its original street layout.

==Legacy==

The 1625 date of the founding of New Amsterdam is now commemorated in the official Seal of New York City. (Formerly, the year on the seal was 1664, the year of the provisional Articles of Transfer, assuring New Netherlanders that they &quot;shall keep and enjoy the liberty of their consciences in religion&quot;, negotiated with the English by Peter Stuyvesant and his council.)

Sometimes considered a dysfunctional trading post by the English who later acquired it from the Dutch, Russell Shorto, author of &quot;The Island at the Center of the World&quot;, suggests that the city left its cultural marks on later New York and, by extension, the United States as a whole.

Major recent historical research has been based on a set of documents that have survived from that period, untranslated. They are the administrative records of the colony, unreadable by most scholars. Since the 1970s, Charles Gehring of the New Netherland Institute has made it his life&#x27;s work to translate this first-hand history of the Colony of New Netherland.

The scholarly conclusion has largely been that the settlement of New Amsterdam is much more like current New York than previously thought. Cultural diversity and a mindset that resembles the American Dream were already present in the first few years of this colony. Writers like Russell Shorto argue that the large influence of New Amsterdam on the American psyche has largely been overlooked in the classic telling of American beginnings, because of animosity between the English victors and the conquered Dutch.

The original 17th-century architecture of New Amsterdam has completely vanished (affected by the fires of 1776 and 1835), leaving only archaeological remnants. The original street plan of New Amsterdam has stayed largely intact, as have some houses outside Manhattan.

The presentation of the legacy of the unique culture of 17th-century New Amsterdam remains a concern of preservationists and educators. In 2009 the National Park Service celebrated the 400th anniversary of Henry Hudson&#x27;s 1609 voyage on behalf of the Dutch with the New Amsterdam Trail.

The Dutch-American historian and journalist Hendrik Willem van Loon wrote in 1933 a work of alternative history entitled &quot;If the Dutch Had Kept Nieuw Amsterdam&quot; (in &quot;If, Or History Rewritten&quot;, edited by J. C. Squire, 1931, Simon &amp; Schuster).

A similar theme, at greater length, was taken up by writer Elizabeth Bear, who published the &quot;New Amsterdam&quot; series of detective stories that take place in a world where the city remained Dutch until the Napoleonic Wars and retained its name also afterward.

One of New York&#x27;s Broadway theatres is the New Amsterdam Theatre. The name New Amsterdam is also written on the architrave situated on top of the row of columns in front of the Manhattan Municipal Building, commemorating the name of the Dutch colony.

Although no architectural monuments or buildings have survived, the legacy lived on in the form of Dutch Colonial Revival architecture. A number of structures in New York City were constructed in the 19th and 20th centuries in this style, such as Wallabout Market in Brooklyn, South William Street in Manhattan, West End Collegiate Church at West 77th Street, and others.

<doc id="21686" wikidata="Q189753" url="?curid=21686" title="Modern paganism">
<text>Modern paganism, also known as contemporary paganism and neopaganism, spans a range of new religious movements variously influenced by the beliefs of pre-modern peoples across Europe, North Africa, and the Near East. Despite some common similarities, contemporary pagan movements are diverse, sharing no single set of beliefs, practices, or religious texts. Scholars of religion may study the phenomenon as a movement divided into different religions, while others study neopaganism as a decentralized religion with an array of denominations.

Adherents rely on pre-Christian, folkloric, and ethnographic sources to a variety of degrees; many of them follow a spirituality that they accept as entirely modern, while others claim to adhere to prehistoric beliefs, or else, they attempt to revive indigenous religions as accurately as possible. Modern pagan movements are frequently described on a spectrum ranging from reconstructive, which seeks to revive historical pagan religions; to eclectic movements, which blend elements from various religions and philosophies with historical paganism. Polytheism, animism, and pantheism are common features across pagan theology. Modern pagans can also include atheists, upholding virtues and principles associated with paganism while maintaining a secular worldview. Humanistic, naturalistic, or secular pagans may recognize deities as archetypes or useful metaphors for different cycles of life, or reframe magic as a purely psychological practice.

Contemporary paganism has been associated with the New Age movement, with scholars highlighting their similarities as well as their differences. The academic field of pagan studies began to coalesce in the 1990s, emerging from disparate scholarship in the preceding two decades.

==Terminology==

===Definition===

There is &quot;considerable disagreement as to the precise definition and the proper usage&quot; of the term &quot;modern paganism&quot;. Even within the academic field of pagan studies, there is no consensus about how contemporary paganism can best be defined. Most scholars describe modern paganism as a broad array of different religions, not a single one. The category of modern paganism could be compared to the categories of Abrahamic religions and Indian religions in its structure. A second, less common definition found within pagan studies – promoted by the religious studies scholars Michael F. Strmiska and Graham Harvey – characterises modern paganism as a single religion, of which groups like Wicca, Druidry, and Heathenry are denominations. This perspective has been critiqued, given the lack of core commonalities in issues such as theology, cosmology, ethics, afterlife, holy days, or ritual practices within the pagan movement.

Contemporary paganism has been defined as &quot;a collection of modern religious, spiritual, and magical traditions that are self-consciously inspired by the pre-Judaic, pre-Christian, and pre-Islamic belief systems of Europe, North Africa, and the Near East.&quot; Thus it has been said that although it is &quot;a highly diverse phenomenon&quot;, &quot;an identifiable common element&quot; nevertheless runs through the pagan movement. Strmiska described paganism as a movement &quot;dedicated to reviving the polytheistic, nature-worshipping pagan religions of pre-Christian Europe and adapting them for the use of people in modern societies.&quot; The religious studies scholar Wouter Hanegraaff characterised paganism as encompassing &quot;all those modern movements which are, first, based on the conviction that what Christianity has traditionally denounced as idolatry and superstition actually represents/represented a profound and meaningful religious worldview and, secondly, that a religious practice based on this worldview can and should be revitalized in our modern world.&quot;

Discussing the relationship between the different pagan religions, religious studies scholars Kaarina Aitamurto and Scott Simpson wrote that they were &quot;like siblings who have taken different paths in life but still retain many visible similarities&quot;. But there has been much &quot;cross-fertilization&quot; between these different faiths: many groups have influenced, and been influenced by, other pagan religions, making clear-cut distinctions among them more difficult for scholars to make. The various pagan religions have been academically classified as new religious movements, with the anthropologist Kathryn Rountree describing paganism as a whole as a &quot;new religious phenomenon&quot;. A number of academics, particularly in North America, consider modern paganism a form of nature religion.

Some practitioners completely eschew the use of the term &quot;pagan&quot;, preferring to use more specific names for their religion, such as &quot;Heathen&quot; or &quot;Wiccan&quot;. This is because the term &quot;pagan&quot; originates in Christian terminology, which individuals who object to the term wish to avoid. Some favor the term &quot;ethnic religion&quot;; the World Pagan Congress, founded in 1998, soon renamed itself the European Congress of Ethnic Religions (ECER), enjoying that term&#x27;s association with the Greek &quot;ethnos&quot; and the academic field of ethnology. Within linguistically Slavic areas of Europe, the term &quot;Native Faith&quot; is often favored as a synonym for paganism, rendered as &quot;Ridnovirstvo&quot; in Ukrainian, &quot;Rodnoverie&quot; in Russian, and &quot;Rodzimowierstwo&quot; in Polish. Alternately, many practitioners in these regions view &quot;Native Faith&quot; as a category within modern paganism that does not encompass all pagan religions. Other terms some pagans favor include &quot;traditional religion&quot;, &quot;indigenous religion&quot;, &quot;nativist religion&quot;, and &quot;reconstructionism&quot;.

Various pagans who are active in pagan studies, such as Michael York and Prudence Jones, have argued that, due to the similarities of their worldviews, the modern pagan movement can be treated as part of the same global phenomenon as pre-Christian Ancient religions, living Indigenous religions, and world religions like Hinduism, Shinto, and Afro-American religions. They have also suggested that these could all be included under the rubric of &quot;paganism&quot;. This approach has been received critically by many specialists in religious studies. Critics have pointed out that such claims would cause problems for analytic scholarship by lumping together belief systems with very significant differences, and that the term would serve modern pagan interests by making the movement appear far larger on the world stage. Doyle White writes that modern religions that draw upon the pre-Christian belief systems of other parts of the world, such as Sub-Saharan Africa or the Americas, cannot be seen as part of the contemporary pagan movement, which is &quot;fundamentally Eurocentric&quot;. Similarly, Strmiska stresses that modern paganism should not be conflated with the belief systems of the world&#x27;s Indigenous peoples because the latter lived under colonialism and its legacy, and that while some pagan worldviews bear similarities to those of indigenous communities, they stem from &quot;different cultural, linguistic, and historical backgrounds&quot;.

===Reappropriation of &quot;paganism&quot;===

Many scholars have favored the use of &quot;neopaganism&quot; to describe this phenomenon, with the prefix &quot;neo-&quot; serving to distinguish the modern religions from their ancient, pre-Christian forerunners. Some pagan practitioners also prefer &quot;neopaganism&quot;, believing that the prefix conveys the reformed nature of the religion, such as its rejection of practices such as animal sacrifice. Conversely, most pagans do not use the word &quot;neopagan&quot;, with some expressing disapproval of it, arguing that the term &quot;neo&quot; offensively disconnects them from what they perceive as their pre-Christian forebears. To avoid causing offense, many scholars in the English-speaking world have begun using the prefixes &quot;modern&quot; or &quot;contemporary&quot; rather than &quot;neo&quot;. Several pagan studies scholars, such as Ronald Hutton and Sabina Magliocco, have emphasized the use of the upper-case &quot;Paganism&quot; to distinguish the modern movement from the lower-case &quot;paganism&quot;, a term commonly used for pre-Christian belief systems. In 2015, Rountree opined that this lower case/upper case division was &quot;now [the] convention&quot; in pagan studies. Among the critics of the upper-case P are York and Andras Corban-Arthen, president of the ECER. Capitalizing the word, they argue, makes &quot;Paganism&quot; appear as the name of a cohesive religion rather than a generic religious category, and comes off as naive, dishonest or as an unwelcome attempt to disrupt the spontaneity and vernacular quality of the movement.

The term &quot;neo-pagan&quot; was coined in the 19th century in reference to Renaissance and Romanticist Hellenophile classical revivalism. By the mid-1930s &quot;neopagan&quot; was being applied to new religious movements like Jakob Wilhelm Hauer&#x27;s German Faith Movement and Jan Stachniuk&#x27;s Polish Zadruga, usually by outsiders and often pejoratively. Pagan as a self-designation appeared in 1964 and 1965, in the publications of the Witchcraft Research Association; at that time, the term was in use by Wiccans in the United States and the United Kingdom, but unconnected to the broader, counterculture pagan movement. The modern popularisation of the terms pagan and neopagan as they are currently understood is largely traced to Oberon Zell-Ravenheart, co-founder of the 1st Neo-Pagan Church of All Worlds who, beginning in 1967 with the early issues of &quot;Green Egg&quot;, used both terms for the growing movement. This usage has been common since the pagan revival in the 1970s.

According to Strmiska, the reappropriation of the term &quot;pagan&quot; by modern pagans served as &quot;a deliberate act of defiance&quot; against &quot;traditional, Christian-dominated society&quot;, allowing them to use it as a source of &quot;pride and power&quot;. In this, he compared it to the gay liberation movement&#x27;s reappropriation of the term &quot;queer&quot;, which had formerly been used only as a term of homophobic abuse. He suggests that part of the term&#x27;s appeal lay in the fact that a large proportion of pagan converts were raised in Christian families, and that by embracing the term &quot;pagan&quot;, a word long used for what was &quot;rejected and reviled by Christian authorities&quot;, a convert summarizes &quot;in a single word his or her definitive break&quot; from Christianity. He further suggests that the term gained appeal through its depiction in romanticist and 19th-century European nationalist literature, where it had been imbued with &quot;a certain mystery and allure&quot;, and that by embracing the word &quot;pagan&quot; modern pagans defy past religious intolerance to honor the pre-Christian peoples of Europe and emphasize those societies&#x27; cultural and artistic achievements.

==Varieties==
===Eclectic and reconstructive===

Modern pagan attitudes differ regarding the source material surrounding pre-Christian belief systems. Strmiska notes that pagan groups can be &quot;divided along a continuum: at one end are those that aim to reconstruct the ancient religious traditions of a particular ethnic group or a linguistic or geographic area to the highest degree possible; at the other end are those that freely blend traditions of different areas, peoples, and time periods.&quot; Strmiska argues that these two poles could be termed &quot;reconstructionism&quot; and &quot;eclecticism&quot;, respectively. Reconstructionists do not altogether reject innovation in their interpretation and adaptation of the source material, however they do believe that the source material conveys greater authenticity and thus should be emphasized. They often follow scholarly debates about the nature of such pre-Christian religions, and some reconstructionists are themselves scholars. Eclectic pagans, conversely, seek general inspiration from the pre-Christian past, and do not attempt to recreate past rites or traditions with specific attention to detail.

On the reconstructionist side can be placed those movements which often favour the designation &quot;Native Faith&quot;, including Romuva, Heathenry, Roman Traditionalism and Hellenism. On the eclectic side has been placed Wicca, Thelema, Adonism, Druidry, the Goddess Movement, Discordianism and the Radical Faeries.
Strmiska also suggests that this division could be seen as being based on &quot;discourses of identity&quot;, with reconstructionists emphasizing a deep-rooted sense of place and people, and eclectics embracing a universality and openness toward humanity and the Earth.

Strmiska nevertheless notes that this reconstructionist-eclectic division is &quot;neither as absolute nor as straightforward as it might appear&quot;. He cites the example of Dievturība, a form of reconstructionist paganism that seeks to revive the pre-Christian religion of the Latvian people, by noting that it exhibits eclectic tendencies by adopting a monotheistic focus and ceremonial structure from Lutheranism. Similarly, while examining neo-shamanism among the Sami people of Northern Scandinavia, Siv Ellen Kraft highlights that despite the religion being reconstructionist in intent, it is highly eclectic in the manner in which it has adopted elements from shamanic traditions in other parts of the world.
In discussing Asatro – a form of Heathenry based in Denmark – Matthew Amster notes that it did not fit clearly within such a framework, because while seeking a reconstructionist form of historical accuracy, Asatro strongly eschewed the emphasis on ethnicity that is common to other reconstructionist groups. While Wicca is identified as an eclectic form of paganism, Strmiska also notes that some Wiccans have moved in a more reconstructionist direction by focusing on a particular ethnic and cultural link, thus developing such variants as Norse Wicca and Celtic Wicca. Concern has also been expressed regarding the utility of the term &quot;reconstructionism&quot; when dealing with paganisms in Central and Eastern Europe, because in many of the languages of these regions, equivalents of the term &quot;reconstructionism&quot; – such as the Czech and Lithuanian – are already used to define the secular hobby of historical re-enactment.

=== Ecologic and secular ===

The spectrum of modern paganism includes a range of ecologic and explicitly ecocentric practices, which may overlap with scientific pantheism. Pagans may distinguish their beliefs and practices as a form of religious naturalism or naturalist philosophy, with some engaged as humanistic or atheopagans.

===Ethnic and regional===
For some pagan groups, ethnicity is central to their religion, and some restrict membership to a single ethnic group. Some critics have described this approach as a form of racism. Other pagan groups allow people of any ethnicity, on the view that the gods and goddesses of a particular region can call anyone to their form of worship. Some such groups feel a particular affinity for the pre-Christian belief systems of a particular region with which they have no ethnic link because they see themselves as reincarnations of people from that society. There is greater focus on ethnicity within the pagan movements in continental Europe than within the pagan movements in North America and the British Isles. Such ethnic paganisms have variously been seen as responses to concerns about foreign ideologies, globalization, cosmopolitanism, and anxieties about cultural erosion.

Although they acknowledged that it was &quot;a highly simplified model&quot;, Aitamurto and Simpson wrote that there was &quot;some truth&quot; to the claim that leftist-oriented forms of paganism were prevalent in North America and the British Isles while rightist-oriented forms of paganism were prevalent in Central and Eastern Europe. They noted that in these latter regions, pagan groups placed an emphasis on &quot;the centrality of the nation, the ethnic group, or the tribe&quot;. Rountree wrote that it was wrong to assume that &quot;expressions of Paganism can be categorized straight-forwardly according to region&quot;, but acknowledged that some regional trends were visible, such as the impact of Catholicism on paganism in Southern Europe.

==Historicity==

Although inspired by the pre-Christian belief systems of the past, modern paganism is not the same phenomenon as these lost traditions and in many respects differs from them considerably. Strmiska stresses that modern paganism is a &quot;new&quot;, &quot;modern&quot; religious movement, even if some of its content derives from ancient sources. Contemporary paganism as practiced in the United States in the 1990s has been described as &quot;a synthesis of historical inspiration and present-day creativity&quot;.

Eclectic paganism takes an undogmatic religious stance and therefore potentially sees no one as having authority to deem a source apocryphal. Contemporary paganism has therefore been prone to fakelore, especially in recent years as information and misinformation alike have been spread on the Internet and in print media. A number of Wiccan, pagan and even some Traditionalist or Tribalist groups have a history of Grandmother Stories – typically involving initiation by a Grandmother, Grandfather, or other elderly relative who is said to have instructed them in the secret, millennia-old traditions of their ancestors. As this secret wisdom can almost always be traced to recent sources, tellers of these stories have often later admitted they made them up. Strmiska asserts that contemporary paganism could be viewed as a part of the &quot;much larger phenomenon&quot; of efforts to revive &quot;traditional, indigenous, or native religions&quot; that were occurring across the globe.

==Beliefs==

Beliefs and practices vary widely among different pagan groups; however, there are a series of core principles common to most, if not all, forms of modern paganism. The English academic Graham Harvey noted that pagans &quot;rarely indulge in theology&quot;.

===Polytheism===
One principle of the pagan movement is polytheism, the belief in and veneration of multiple gods or goddesses.
Within the pagan movement, there can be found many deities, both male and female, who have various associations and embody forces of nature, aspects of culture, and facets of human psychology. These deities are typically depicted in human form, and are viewed as having human faults. They are therefore not seen as perfect, but rather are venerated as being wise and powerful. Pagans feel that this understanding of the gods reflected the dynamics of life on Earth, allowing for the expression of humour.

One view in the pagan community is that these polytheistic deities are not viewed as literal entities, but as Jungian archetypes or other psychological constructs that exist in the human psyche. Others adopt the belief that the deities have both a psychological and external existence. Many pagans believe adoption of a polytheistic world-view would be beneficial for western society – replacing the dominant monotheism they see as innately repressive. In fact, many American modern pagans first came to their adopted faiths because it allowed a greater freedom, diversity, and tolerance of worship among the community. This pluralistic perspective has helped the varied factions of modern paganism exist in relative harmony. Most pagans adopt an ethos of &quot;unity in diversity&quot; regarding their religious beliefs.

The inclusion of female deities is one facet that distinguishes pagan religions from most of their Abrahamic counterparts.
In Wicca, male and female deities are typically balanced out in a form of duotheism. Among many pagans, there is a strong desire to incorporate the female aspects of the divine in their worship and within their lives, which can partially explain the attitude which sometimes manifests as the veneration of women.

There are exceptions to polytheism in paganism, as seen for instance in the form of Ukrainian paganism promoted by Lev Sylenko, which is devoted to a monotheistic veneration of the god Dazhbog. As noted above, pagans with naturalistic worldviews may not believe in or work with deities at all.

Pagan religions commonly exhibit a metaphysical concept of an underlying order that pervades the universe, such as the concept of &quot;harmonia&quot; embraced by Hellenists and that of &quot;Wyrd&quot; found in Heathenry.

===Animism and pantheism===
A key part of most pagan worldviews is the holistic concept of a universe that is interconnected. This is connected with a belief in either pantheism or panentheism. In both beliefs, divinity and the material or spiritual universe are one. For pagans, pantheism means that &quot;divinity is inseparable from nature and that deity is immanent in nature&quot;.

Dennis D. Carpenter noted that the belief in a pantheistic or panentheistic deity has led to the idea of interconnectedness playing a key part in pagans&#x27; worldviews. The prominent Reclaiming priestess Starhawk related that a core part of goddess-centred pagan witchcraft was &quot;the understanding that all being is interrelated, that we are all linked with the cosmos as parts of one living organism. What affects one of us affects us all.&quot;

Another pivotal belief in the contemporary pagan movement is that of animism. This has been interpreted in two distinct ways among the pagan community. First, it can refer to a belief that everything in the universe is imbued with a life force or spiritual energy. In contrast, some contemporary pagans believe that there are specific spirits that inhabit various features in the natural world, and that these can be actively communicated with. Some pagans have reported experiencing communication with spirits dwelling in rocks, plants, trees and animals, as well as power animals or animal spirits who can act as spiritual helpers or guides.

Animism was also a concept common to many pre-Christian European religions, and in adopting it, contemporary pagans are attempting to &quot;reenter the primeval worldview&quot; and participate in a view of cosmology &quot;that is not possible for most Westerners after childhood.&quot;

===Nature veneration===
All pagan movements place great emphasis on the divinity of nature as a primary source of divine will, and on humanity&#x27;s membership of the natural world, bound in kinship to all life and the Earth itself. The animistic aspects of pagan theology assert that all things have a soul – not just humans or organic life – so this bond is held with mountains and rivers as well as trees and wild animals. As a result, pagans believe the essence of their spirituality is both ancient and timeless, regardless of the age of specific religious movements. Places of natural beauty are therefore treated as sacred and ideal for ritual, like the nemetons of the ancient Celts.

Many pagans hold that different lands and/or cultures have their own natural religion, with many legitimate interpretations of divinity, and therefore reject religious exclusivism.

While the pagan community has tremendous variety in political views spanning the whole of the political spectrum, environmentalism is often a common feature.
Such views have also led many pagans to revere the planet Earth as Mother Earth, who is often referred to as Gaia after the ancient Greek goddess of the Earth.

==Practices==
===Ritual===

Pagan ritual can take place in both a public and private setting.
Contemporary pagan ritual is typically geared towards &quot;facilitating altered states of awareness or shifting mind-sets&quot;. To induce such altered states of consciousness, pagans use such elements as drumming, visualization, chanting, singing, dancing, and meditation. American folklorist Sabina Magliocco came to the conclusion, based upon her ethnographic fieldwork in California that certain pagan beliefs &quot;arise from what they experience during religious ecstasy&quot;.

Sociologist Margot Adler highlighted how several pagan groups, like the Reformed Druids of North America and the Erisian movement incorporate a great deal of play in their rituals rather than having them be completely serious and somber. She noted that there are those who would argue that &quot;the Pagan community is one of the only spiritual communities that is exploring humor, joy, abandonment, even silliness and outrageousness as valid parts of spiritual experience&quot;.

Domestic worship typically takes place in the home and is carried out by either an individual or family group. It typically involves offerings – including bread, cake, flowers, fruit, milk, beer, or wine – being given to images of deities, often accompanied with prayers and songs and the lighting of candles and incense.
Common pagan devotional practices have thus been compared to similar practices in Hinduism, Buddhism, Shinto, Roman Catholicism, and Orthodox Christianity, but contrasted with that in Protestantism, Judaism, and Islam.
Although animal sacrifice was a common part of pre-Christian ritual in Europe, it is rarely practiced in contemporary paganism.

===Festival===

Paganism&#x27;s public rituals are generally calendrical, although the pre-Christian festivals that pagans use as a basis varied across Europe. Nevertheless, common to almost all pagan religions is an emphasis on an agricultural cycle and respect for the dead. Common pagan festivals include those marking the summer solstice and winter solstice as well as the start of spring and the harvest. In Wicca and Druidry, a Wheel of the Year has been developed which typically involves eight seasonal festivals.

===Magic===

The belief in magical rituals and spells is held by a &quot;significant number&quot; of contemporary pagans. Among those who believe in it, there are a variety of different views about what magic is. Many modern pagans adhere to the definition of magic provided by Aleister Crowley, the founder of Thelema: &quot;the Science and Art of causing change to occur in conformity with Will&quot;. Also accepted by many is the related definition purportedly provided by the ceremonial magician Dion Fortune: &quot;magic is the art and science of changing consciousness according to the Will&quot;.

Among those who practice magic are Wiccans, those who identify as neopagan witches, and practitioners of some forms of revivalist neo-Druidism, the rituals of which are at least partially based upon those of ceremonial magic and freemasonry.

==History==

===Early modern period===
Discussions about prevailing, returning or new forms of paganism have existed throughout the modern period. Before the 20th century, Christian institutions regularly used paganism as a term for everything outside of Christianity, Judaism and – from the 18th century – Islam. They frequently associated paganism with idolatry, magic and a general concept of &quot;false religion&quot;, which for example has made Catholics and Protestants accuse each other of being pagans. Various folk beliefs have periodically been labeled as pagan and churches have demanded that they should be purged. The Western attitude to paganism gradually changed during the early modern period. One reason was increased contacts with areas outside of Europe, which happened through trade, Christian mission and colonization. Increased knowledge of other cultures led to questions of whether their practices even fit into the definitions of religion, and paganism was incorporated in the idea of progress, where it was ranked as a low, undeveloped form of religion. Another reason for change was the circulation of ancient writings such as those attributed to Hermes Trismegistus; this made paganism an intellectual position some Europeans began to self-identify with, starting at the latest in the 15th century with people like Gemistus Pletho, who wanted to establish a new form of Greco-Roman polytheism.
Gemistus Pletho influenced Cosimo de Medici to establish the Florentine Neoplatonic Academy and consequentially Julius Pomponius Laetus (student of Pletho) also advocated for a revival and established the Roman academy which secretly celebrated the Natale di Roma and the birthday of Romulus. The Academy was dissolved in 1468 when Pope Paul II ordered the arrest and execution of some of the members, Pope Sixtus IV allowed Laetus to open the academy again until the Sack of Rome of the 1527.

Positive identification with paganism became more common in the 18th and 19th centuries, when it tied in with criticism of Christianity and organized religion, rooted in the ideas of the Age of Enlightenment and Romanticism. The approach to paganism varied during this period; Friedrich Schiller&#x27;s 1788 poem &quot;Die Götter Griechenlandes&quot; presents ancient Greek religion as a powerful alternative to Christianity, whereas others took interest in paganism through the concept of the noble savage, often associated with Jean-Jacques Rousseau. During the French Revolution and First French Republic, some public figures incorporated pagan themes in their worldviews. An explicit example was Gabriel André Aucler, who responded to both Christianity and Enlightenment atheism by performing pagan rites and arguing for renewed pagan religiosity in his book &quot;La Thréicie&quot; (1799).

===19th and early 20th centuries===

One of the origins of modern pagan movements lies in the romanticist and national liberation movements that developed in Europe during the 18th and 19th centuries. The publications of studies into European folk customs and culture by scholars like Johann Gottfried Herder and Jacob Grimm resulted in a wider interest in these subjects and a growth in cultural self-consciousness. At the time, it was commonly believed that almost all such folk customs were survivals from the pre-Christian period. These attitudes would also be exported to North America by European immigrants in these centuries.

The Romantic movement of the 18th century led to the re-discovery of Old Gaelic and Old Norse literature and poetry. The 19th century saw a surge of interest in Germanic paganism with the Viking revival in Victorian Britain and Scandinavia, and the Völkisch movement in Germany. These currents coincided with Romanticist interest in folklore and occultism, the widespread emergence of pagan themes in popular literature, and the rise of nationalism.


The rise of modern paganism was aided by the decline in Christianity throughout many parts of Europe and North America, as well as by the concomitant decline in enforced religious conformity and greater freedom of religion that developed, allowing people to explore a wider range of spiritual options and form religious organisations that could operate free from legal persecution.

Historian Ronald Hutton has argued that many of the motifs of 20th century neo-paganism may be traced back to the utopian, mystical counter-cultures of the late-Victorian and Edwardian periods (also extending in some instances into the 1920s), via the works of amateur folklorists, popular authors, poets, political radicals and alternative lifestylers.

Prior to the spread of the 20th-century modern pagan movements, a notable instance of self-identified paganism was in Sioux writer Zitkala-sa&#x27;s essay &quot;Why I Am A Pagan&quot;. Published in the Atlantic Monthly in 1902, the Native American activist and writer outlined her rejection of Christianity (referred to as &quot;the new superstition&quot;) in favor of a harmony with nature embodied by the Great Spirit. She further recounted her mother&#x27;s abandonment of Sioux religion and the unsuccessful attempts of a &quot;native preacher&quot; to get her to attend the village church.

In the 1920s Margaret Murray theorized that a secret pagan religion had survived the witchcraft persecutions enacted by the ecclesiastical and secular courts. Historians now reject Murray&#x27;s theory, as she based it partially upon the similarities of the accounts given by those accused of witchcraft; such similarity is now thought to actually derive from there having been a standard set of questions laid out in the witch-hunting manuals used by interrogators.

In the transition between the 1800s and 1900s, efforts to incorporate pagan-Roman rituals into the Italian national identity were made by archaeologist Giacomo Boni and esoteric circles in Rome.

In 1927, philosopher and esotericist Julius Evola founded the Gruppo di Ur in Rome, along with its journal &quot;Ur&quot; (1927–1928), involving figures like Arturo Reghini. In 1928, Evola published &quot;Imperialismo Pagano&quot;, advocating Italian political paganism to oppose the Lateran Pacts. The journal resumed in 1929 as &quot;Krur&quot;.

A mysterious document published in &quot;Krur&quot; in 1929, attributed to orientalist Leone Caetani, suggested that Italy&#x27;s World War I victory and the rise of fascism were influenced by Etruscan-Roman rites.
===Late 20th century===
The 1960s and 1970s saw a resurgence in neo-Druidism as well as the rise of modern Germanic paganism in the United States and in Iceland. In the 1970s, Wicca was notably influenced by feminism, leading to the creation of an eclectic, Goddess-worshipping movement known as Dianic Wicca. The 1979 publication of Margot Adler&#x27;s &quot;Drawing Down the Moon&quot; and Starhawk&#x27;s &quot;The Spiral Dance&quot; opened a new chapter in public awareness of paganism.
With the growth and spread of large, pagan gatherings and festivals in the 1980s, public varieties of Wicca continued to further diversify into additional, eclectic sub-denominations, often heavily influenced by the New Age and counter-culture movements. These open, unstructured or loosely structured traditions contrast with British Traditional Wicca, which emphasizes secrecy and initiatory lineage.

In 1998, the ECER (European Congress of Ethnic Religions) was founded with the aim of safeguarding pre-Christian or reconstructionist religions. Some of the organizations affiliated with this entity have contributed to the revival of paganism by building temples and organizing rituals and events in collaboration with various organizations.

After the fall of fascism, the public focus on pre-Christian Roman spirituality was mainly promoted by Julius Evola. In the 1970s, interest in pagan Romanity and the &quot;Gruppo di Ur&quot; resurfaced among youth linked to Evola. He also introduced non-Roman religious concepts like Buddhism, Hinduism, and sexual magic.

The &quot;Gruppo dei Dioscuri&quot; was formed in Rome, Naples, and Messina, publishing four pamphlets before disappearing from public view, though it continued activities from 1969 and remained active in various Italian regions after its founder&#x27;s death in 2000.

The Evolian journal &quot;Arthos&quot;, founded in Genoa in 1972 by Renato del Ponte, expressed significant interest in Roman religion. In 1984, the &quot;Gruppo Arx&quot; revived Messina&#x27;s &quot;Dioscuri&quot; activities, and the &quot;Pythagorean Association&quot; briefly resurfaced in Calabria and Sicily from 1984 to 1988, publishing &quot;Yghìeia&quot;.

Other publications include the Genoese &quot;Il Basilisco&quot; (1979–1989), which released several works on pagan studies, and &quot;Politica Romana&quot; (1994–2004), seen as a high-level Romano-pagan journal. One prominent figure was actor Roberto Corbiletto, who died in a mysterious fire in 1999.

The 1980s and 1990s also saw an increasing interest in serious academic research and reconstructionist pagan traditions. The establishment and growth of the Internet in the 1990s brought rapid growth to these, and other pagan movements. By the time of the collapse of the former Soviet Union in 1991, freedom of religion was legally established across Russia and a number of other newly independent states, allowing for the growth in both Christian and non-Christian religions.

==Religious paths and movements==
===Reconstructionist===

In contrast to the eclectic traditions, Polytheistic Reconstructionists practice culturally specific ethnic traditions based on folklore, songs and prayers, as well as reconstructions from the historical record. Hellenic, Roman, Kemetic, Celtic, Germanic, Guanche, Baltic and Slavic reconstructionists aim to preserve and revive the practices and beliefs of Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome, Ancient Egypt, the Celts, the Germanic peoples, the Guanche people, the Balts and the Slavs, respectively.

====Germanic====

Heathenism, also known as Germanic neopaganism, refers to a series of contemporary pagan traditions based on the historical religions, culture and literature of Germanic-speaking Europe. Heathenry is spread out across northwestern Europe, North America and Australasia, where the descendants of historic Germanic-speaking people now live.

Many Heathen groups adopt variants of Norse mythology as a basis for their beliefs, conceiving of the Earth as on the great world tree Yggdrasil. Heathens believe in multiple polytheistic deities adopted from historical Germanic mythologies. Most are polytheistic realists, believing that the deities are real entities, while others view them as Jungian archetypes.

====Celtic====
====Slavic====
Slavic neo-paganism, or Slavic nativism, is a reconstruction of the pre-Christian pagan beliefs of the ancient Slavs, a return to the worship of Perun, Veles, Makosh, etc. based on some historical information and one&#x27;s own ideas, with borrowings from the teachings and rituals of polytheistic beliefs of other peoples and the occult.

====Uralic====
====Baltic====
====Greek====
====Roman====
==== Kemetic ====
====Semitic====
Beit Asherah (the house of the Goddess Asherah) was one of the first modern pagan synagogues, founded in the early 1990s by Stephanie Fox, Steven Posch, and Magenta Griffiths (Lady Magenta). Magenta Griffiths is High Priestess of the Beit Asherah coven, and a former board member of the Covenant of the Goddess.

====Armenian====
====Chuvash====
The Chuvash people, a Turkic ethnic group native to an area stretching from the Volga Region to Siberia, have experienced a pagan revival since the fall of the Soviet Union. While potentially considered a peculiar form of Tengrism, a related revivalist movement of Central Asian traditional religion, Vattisen Yaly (, &quot;Tradition of the Old&quot;) differs significantly: the Chuvash being a heavily Fennicised and Slavified ethnicity and having had exchanges also with other Indo-European ethnicities, their religion shows many similarities with Finnic and Slavic paganisms; moreover, the revival of Vattisen Yaly in recent decades has occurred following modern pagan patterns. Today the followers of the Chuvash Traditional Religion are called &quot;the true Chuvash&quot;. Their main god is Tura, a deity comparable to the Estonian Taara, the Germanic Thunraz and the pan-Turkic Tengri.

===Eclectic===
====Wicca====


Wicca is the largest form of modern paganism, as well as the best-known and most extensively studied.

Religious studies scholar Graham Harvey noted that the poem &quot;Charge of the Goddess&quot; remains central to the liturgy of most Wiccan groups. Originally written by Wiccan High Priestess Doreen Valiente in the mid-1950s, the poem allows Wiccans to gain wisdom and experience deity in &quot;the ordinary things in life.&quot;

Historian Ronald Hutton identified a wide variety of different sources that influenced Wicca&#x27;s development, including ceremonial magic, folk magic, Romanticist literature, Freemasonry, and the witch-cult theory of English archaeologist Margaret Murray. English esotericist Gerald Gardner was at the forefront of the burgeoning Wiccan movement. He claimed to have been initiated by the New Forest coven in 1939, and that the religion he discovered was a survival of the pagan witch-cult described in Murray&#x27;s theory. Various forms of Wicca have since evolved or been adapted from Gardner&#x27;s British Traditional Wicca or Gardnerian Wicca, such as Alexandrian Wicca. Other forms loosely based on Gardner&#x27;s teachings are Faery Wicca, Kemetic Wicca, Judeo-paganism or jewitchery, and Dianic Wicca or feminist Wicca, which emphasizes the divine feminine, often creating women-only or lesbian-only groups. In the academic community Wicca has also been interpreted as having close affinities with process philosophy.

In the 1990s, Wiccan beliefs and practices were used as a partial basis for a number of US films and television series, such as &quot;The Craft&quot;, &quot;Charmed&quot; and &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, leading to a surge in teenagers&#x27; and young adults&#x27; interest and involvement in the religion.

====Goddess movement====

Goddess spirituality, which is also known as the Goddess movement, is a pagan religion in which a singular, monotheistic Goddess is given predominance. Goddess Spirituality revolves around the sacredness of the female form, and of aspects of women&#x27;s lives that adherents say have been traditionally neglected in Western society, such as menstruation, sexuality, and maternity.

The Goddess movement draws some of its inspiration from the work of archaeologists such as Marija Gimbutas, whose interpretation of artifacts excavated from &quot;Old Europe&quot; points to societies of Neolithic Europe that were matristic or goddess-centered worshipping a female deity of three primary aspects, which has inspired some modern pagan worshippers of the Triple Goddess.

Adherents of the Goddess Spirituality movement typically envision a history of the world that is different from traditional narratives about the past, emphasising the role of women rather than that of men. According to this view, human society was formerly a matriarchy, with communities being egalitarian, pacifistic, and focused on the worship of the Mother goddess, which was subsequently overthrown by violent and warlike patriarchal hordes – usually Indo-European pastoralists who worshipped male sky-gods, and continued to rule through the form of Abrahamic religions, specifically Christianity in the West. Adherents look for elements of this human history in &quot;theological, anthropological, archaeological, historical, folkloric and hagiographic writings.&quot;

====Druidry====
Druidry shows similar heterogeneity as Wicca. It draws inspirations from historical Druids, the priest caste of the ancient pagan Celts. Druidry dates to the earliest forms of modern paganism: the Ancient Order of Druids founded in 1781 had many aspects of freemasonry, and has practiced rituals at Stonehenge since 1905. George Watson MacGregor Reid founded the Druid Order in its current form in 1909. In 1964 Ross Nichols established the Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids. In the United States, the Ancient Order of Druids in America (AODA) was established in 1912, the Reformed Druids of North America (RDNA) in 1963, and Ár nDraíocht Féin (ADF) in 1983 by Isaac Bonewits.

====Eco-paganism and Unitarian Universalism====
Eco-paganism and Eco-magic, which are offshoots of direct action environmental groups, strongly emphasize fairy imagery and a belief in the possibility of intercession by the fae (fairies, pixies, gnomes, elves, and other spirits of nature and the Otherworlds).

Some Unitarian Universalists are eclectic pagans. Unitarian Universalists look for spiritual inspiration in a wide variety of religious beliefs. The Covenant of Unitarian Universalist Pagans, or CUUPs, encourages its chapters to &quot;use practices familiar to members who attend for worship services but not to follow only one tradition of paganism.&quot;

====Occultism and ethnic mysticism====
In 1925, the Czech esotericist Franz Sättler founded the pagan religion Adonism, devoted to the ancient Greek god Adonis, whom Sättler equated with the Christian Satan, and which purported that the end of the world would come in 2000. Adonism largely died out in the 1930s, but remained an influence on the German occult scene.

==Demographics==

Establishing precise figures on paganism is difficult. Due to the secrecy and fear of persecution still prevalent among pagans, limited numbers are willing to openly be counted. The decentralised nature of paganism and sheer number of solitary practitioners further complicates matters. Nevertheless, there is a slow growing body of data on the subject. In the US, there are estimated to be between 1 and 1.5 million practitioners.

===Europe===

====Caucasus region====
Among Circassians, the Adyghe Habze faith has been revived after the fall of the Soviet Union, and followers of modern pagan faiths were found to constitute 12% in Karachay-Cherkessia and 3% in Kabardino-Balkaria (both republics are multiethnic and also have many non-Circassians, especially Russians and Turkic peoples) In Abkhazia, the Abkhaz native faith has also been revived, and in the 2003 census, 8% of residents identified with it (note again that there are many non-Abkhaz in the state including Georgians, Russians and Armenians); on 3 August 2012 the Council of Priests of Abkhazia was formally constituted in Sukhumi. In North Ossetia, the Uatsdin faith was revived, and in 2012, 29% of the population identified with it (North Ossetia is about 2/3 Ossetian and 1/3 Russian). Modern pagan movements are also present to a lesser degree elsewhere; in Dagestan 2% of the population identified with folk religious movements, while data on modern pagans is unavailable for Chechnya and Ingushetia.

====Volga region====
The Mari native religion in fact has a continuous existence, but it has co-existed with Orthodox Christianity for centuries and experienced a renewal after the fall of the Soviet Union. A sociological survey conducted in 2004 found that about 15 percent of the population of Mari El consider themselves adherents of the Mari native religion. Since Mari make up just 45 percent of the republic&#x27;s population of 700,000, this figure means that probably more than a third claim to follow the old religion. The percentage of pagans among the Mari of Bashkortostan and the eastern part of Tatarstan is even higher (up to 69% among women). Mari fled here from forced Christianization in the 17th to 19th centuries. A similar number was claimed by Victor Schnirelmann, for whom between a quarter and a half of the Mari either worship the pagan gods or are members of modern pagan groups.

A modern pagan movement drawing from various syncretic practices that had survived among the Christianised Mari people was initiated in 1990 that was estimated in 2004 to have won the adherence of 2% of the Mordvin people.

====Western Europe====
A study by Ronald Hutton compared a number of different sources (including membership lists of major UK organizations, attendance at major events, subscriptions to magazines, etc.) and used standard models for extrapolating likely numbers. This estimate accounted for multiple membership overlaps, as well as the number of adherents represented by each attendee of a pagan gathering. Hutton estimated that there are 250,000 modern pagans in the United Kingdom, roughly equivalent to the national Hindu community.

A smaller number is suggested by the results of the 2001 Census, in which a question about religious affiliation was asked for the first time. Respondents were able to write in an affiliation not covered by the checklist of common religions, and a total of 42,262 people from England, Scotland and Wales declared themselves to be pagans by this method. These figures were not released as a matter of course by the Office for National Statistics but were released after an application by the Pagan Federation of Scotland. This is more than many well known traditions such as Rastafarian, Baháʼí and Zoroastrian groups but fewer than the big six of Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism, Judaism and Buddhism. It is also fewer than the adherents of Jediism, whose campaign made their faith the fourth largest religion after Christianity, Islam and Hinduism.

The 2001 UK Census figures did not allow an accurate breakdown of traditions within the pagan heading, as a campaign by the Pagan Federation before the census encouraged Wiccans, Heathens, Druids and others all to use the same write-in term &#x27;pagan&#x27; to maximise the numbers reported. However, the 2011 census made it possible to describe oneself as pagan-Wiccan, pagan-Druid and so on. The figures for England and Wales showed 80,153 describing themselves as pagan (or some subgroup thereof). The largest subgroup was Wicca, with 11,766 adherents. The overall numbers of people self-reporting as pagan rose between 2001 and 2011. In 2001, about seven people per 10,000 UK respondents were pagan; in 2011, the number (based on the England and Wales population) was 14.3 people per 10,000 respondents.

Census figures in Ireland do not provide a breakdown of religions outside of the major Christian denominations and other major world religions. A total of 22,497 people stated Other Religion in the 2006 census; and a rough estimate is that there were 2,000–3,000 practicing pagans in Ireland in 2009. Numerous pagan groups – primarily Wiccan and Druidic – exist in Ireland though none is officially recognised by the Government. Irish paganism is often strongly concerned with issues of place and language.

===North America===

Canada does not provide extremely detailed records of religious adherence. Its statistics service only collects limited religious information each decade. At the 2001 census, there were a recorded 21,080 pagans in Canada.

The United States government does not directly collect religious information. As a result such information is provided by religious institutions and other third-party statistical organisations. Based on the most recent survey by the Pew Research Center, there are approximately one million pagans in the United States. 0.3% of respondents answered &quot;Pagan&quot; or &quot;Wiccan&quot; when polled.

According to Helen A. Berger&#x27;s 1995 survey &quot;The Pagan Census&quot;, most American pagans are middle-class, educated, and live in urban/suburban areas on the East and West coasts.
===Oceania===
In the 2011 Australian Census, 32,083 respondents identified as pagan. Out of 21,507,717 recorded Australians, they compose approximately 0.15% of the population. The Australian Bureau of Statistics classifies paganism as an affiliation under which several sub-classifications may optionally be specified. This includes animism, nature religion, Druidism, pantheism, and Wicca/Witchcraft. As a result, fairly detailed breakdowns of pagan respondents are available.
In 2006, there were at least 6,804 (0.164%) pagans among New Zealand&#x27;s population of approximately 4 million. Respondents were given the option to select one or more religious affiliations.
==Paganism in society==

===Propagation===
Based upon her study of the pagan community in the United States, the sociologist Margot Adler noted that it is rare for pagan groups to proselytize to gain new converts to their faiths. Instead, she argued that &quot;in most cases,&quot; converts first become interested in the movement through &quot;word of mouth, a discussion between friends, a lecture, a book, an article or a Web site.&quot; She went on to put forward the idea that this typically confirmed &quot;some original, private experience, so that the most common experience of those who have named themselves pagan is something like &#x27;I finally found a group that has the same religious perceptions I always had. A practicing Wiccan herself, Adler used her own conversion to paganism as a case study, remarking that as a child she had taken a great interest in the gods and goddesses of ancient Greece, and had performed her own devised rituals in dedication to them. When she eventually came across the Wiccan religion many years later, she then found that it confirmed her earlier childhood experiences, and that &quot;I never converted in the accepted sense. I simply accepted, reaffirmed, and extended a very old experience&quot;.

Folklorist Sabina Magliocco supported this idea, noting that a great many of those Californian pagans whom she interviewed claimed that they had been greatly interested in mythology and folklore as children, imagining a world of &quot;enchanted nature and magical transformations, filled with lords and ladies, witches and wizards, and humble but often wise peasants&quot;. Magliocco noted that it was this world that pagans &quot;strive to re-create in some measure&quot;. Further support for Adler&#x27;s ideas came from American Wiccan priestess Judy Harrow, who noted that among her comrades, there was a feeling that &quot;you don&#x27;t &quot;become&quot; pagan, you discover that you always were&quot;. They have also been supported by Pagan studies scholar Graham Harvey.

Many pagans in North America encounter the movement through their involvement in other hobbies; particularly popular with US pagans are &quot;golden age-type&quot; pastimes such as the Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA), &quot;Star Trek&quot; fandom, &quot;Doctor Who&quot; fandom and comic book fandom. Other ways in which many North American pagans have gotten involved with the movement are through political or ecological activism, such as vegetarian groups, health food stores, or feminist university courses.

Adler went on to note that from those she interviewed and surveyed in the US she could identify a number of common factors that led to people getting involved in paganism: the beauty, vision and imagination that was found within their beliefs and rituals, a sense of intellectual satisfaction and personal growth that they imparted, their support for environmentalism or feminism, and a sense of freedom.

===Class, gender and ethnicity===
====United States====
Based upon her work in the United States, Adler found that the pagan movement was &quot;very diverse&quot; in its class and ethnic backgrounds. She went on to remark that she had encountered pagans in jobs that ranged from &quot;fireman to PhD chemist&quot; but that the one thing she thought made them into an &quot;elite&quot; was being avid readers, something that she found to be very common within the pagan community despite the fact that avid readers constituted less than 20% of the general population of the United States at the time. Magliocco came to a somewhat different conclusion based upon her ethnographic research of pagans in California, remarking that the majority were &quot;white, middle-class, well-educated urbanites&quot; but that they were united in finding &quot;artistic inspiration&quot; within &quot;folk and indigenous [American] spiritual traditions,&quot;

The sociologist Regina Oboler examined the role of gender in the American pagan community, arguing that although the movement had been constant in its support for the equality of men and women ever since its foundation, there was still an essentialist view of gender ingrained within it, with female deities being accorded traditional western feminine traits and male deities being similarly accorded what western society saw as masculine traits.

===Racism and nationalism===
Generally, modern pagan currents in Western countries do not advocate nationalist or far-right ideologies. Instead, they advocate individual self-improvement and liberal values of personal freedom, gender equality, and environmental protection. The nationalist sentiments expressed by modern pagans in Western countries are marginal, so the ideas of cosmopolitanism are prevalent. Faith and dogmas give way to active practices, including psychotechnics, which was extensively influenced by neo-Hinduism. In contrast, many areas of post-Soviet modern paganism, including Russian, are occupied not so much with individual self-improvement as they are occupied with social problems, and they also create nationalist ideologies based on the &quot;invented past&quot;.

Modern paganism is one of the directions in the development of romantic nationalism with its components such as the idealization of a particular people&#x27;s historical or mythological past, dissatisfaction with modernity, and the ease of transition to a radical stage with the postulation of national superiority.

The &quot;volksgeist&quot;, which is given great attention within the framework of ethnic nationalism, is often identified with religion, so there is a desire to create or revive one&#x27;s religion or nationalize one of the world&#x27;s religions. Heinrich Heine linked nationalism with paganism. The philosopher Nikolai Berdyaev, who shared Heine&#x27;s opinion, noted the regularity of the tendency of the transition of German antisemitism into anti-Christianity.

At the beginning of the 20th century, the spiritual crisis in Russia led to a fascination with paganism, at first ancient and then Slavic &quot;native gods,&quot; which was especially true for the symbolists. The publicist Daniil Pasmanik (1923) wrote that consistent antisemitism should reject Judaism and Christianity. He noted that this trend had already led Germany to worship Odin and, in the future, in his opinion, would inevitably lead Russia to worship Perun.

German occultism and modern paganism arose in the early 20th century, and they became influential through teachings such as Ariosophy, gaining adherents within the far-right Völkisch movement, which eventually culminated in Nazism. The development of such ideas after World War II gave rise to Wotanism, a white nationalist modern pagan movement at the end of the 20th century.
In Germany in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Völkisch movement, characterized by a racist antisemitic ideology of radical ethnic nationalism of the dominant population, spread. The central elements of the worldview were racism and elitism. The movement included a religious modern pagan component. The ideology developed out of German nationalist romanticism. Nazism is considered one of the movements within the völkisch or as strongly influenced by the völkisch. Völkisch consisted of many religiopolitical groups whose leaders and followers were closely associated with each other and the developing Nazi Party. This ideology significantly impacted various aspects of German culture at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries.

Liberalism and rationalism, which demystified the time-honored order that accepted authorities and prejudices, also caused an adverse reaction from supporters of the völkisch movement. A negative attitude towards modernity characterizes the writings of German nationalist &quot;prophets&quot; such as Paul Delagardie, Julius Lang, and Arthur Moeller van den Bruck. The movement combined a sentimental patriotic interest in German folklore and local history with anti-urban, back-to-the-earth populism. To overcome what they considered the ailment of scientific and rationalistic modernity, the authors of völkisch found a spiritual solution in the essence of the &quot;people,&quot; perceived as genuine, intuitive, even &quot;primitive,&quot; in the sense of the location of the &quot;people&quot; on the level with the original (primordial) cosmic order.

Völkisch thinkers tended to idealize the myth of the &quot;original nation&quot;, which they believed could still be found in rural Germany, a form of &quot;primitive democracy freely subject to its natural elite&quot;. The idea of the &quot;people&quot; () was subsequently transformed into the idea of &quot;racial essence&quot;, and Völkisch thinkers understood this term as a life-giving and quasi-eternal essence and not as a sociological category, in the same way as they considered &quot;Nature&quot;.

Modern pagan ideas were present in Ariosophy, an esoteric teaching created by the Austrian occultists Guido von List and Jörg Lanz von Liebenfels in Austria between 1890 and 1930. The term &quot;ariosophy&quot; can also be used generically to describe the &quot;Aryan&quot;/esoteric teachings of the völkisch subset. The doctrine of Ariosophy was based on pseudoscientific ideas about &quot;Aryan&quot; purity and the mystical unity of spirit and body. It was influenced by the German nationalist völkisch movement, the theosophy of Helena Blavatsky, the Austrian pan-German movement, and social Darwinism and its racist conclusions. Ariosophy influenced the ideology of Nazism.

The works of the Ariosophists describe the prehistoric &quot;Aryan&quot; golden age when the wise keepers of knowledge learned and taught occult racial teachings and ruled over a &quot;racially pure&quot; society. It is alleged that there is an evil conspiracy of anti-German forces, including all &quot;non-Aryan&quot; races, Jews, and the Christian church, seeking to destroy the ideal &quot;Aryan&quot; German world by freeing the &quot;non-Aryan&quot; mob to establish a false equality of the illegitimate (representatives of &quot;non-Aryan&quot; races). History, including wars, economic crises, political uncertainty, and the weakening of the power of the German principle, is seen as the result of racial mixing.

The doctrine had followers in Austria and Germany. Occultism in the doctrines of the Ariosophists was of great importance as a sacral justification for an extreme political position and a fundamental rejection of reality, including socio-economic progress. The Ariosophists sought to predict and justify the &quot;coming era&quot; of the German world order. To counter the modern world, &quot;corrupted&quot; by racial mixing, the Ariosophists created many small circles and secret religious societies to revive the &quot;lost&quot; esoteric knowledge and racial virtues of the ancient Germans to create a new pan-German empire.

To recreate the religion of the ancient Germans, List used the Scandinavian epic and the work of contemporary theosophists, in particular Max Ferdinand Sebaldt von Werth, who described the eugenic practices of the &quot;Aryans&quot;, as well as &quot;The Secret Doctrine&quot; by Helena Blavatsky and &quot;The Lost Lemuria&quot; by William Scott-Elliot. Influenced by these works, List used the terms &quot;Ario-Germans&quot; and &quot;race&quot; instead of &quot;Germans&quot; and &quot;people&quot;, perhaps to emphasize the overlap with the fifth root race in Blavatsky&#x27;s scheme. List and Lanz developed ideas about the struggle between the &quot;Aryan race of masters&quot; and the &quot;race of slaves&quot; and about the ancestral home of the &quot;Aryans&quot; on the sunken polar island of Arctogea.

In Nazi Germany, Germanic pagan folklore, as a source of primordial moral standards, was revered higher than Christianity associated with Judaism. Many Nazis saw anti-Christianity as a deeper form of antisemitism. Heinrich Himmler spoke of the need to create a &quot;neo-Germanic religion&quot; capable of replacing Christianity. The Old Testament was especially repugnant to the Nazis. Adolf Hitler called it &quot;Satan&#x27;s Bible&quot;. Rosenberg demanded that it be banned as a &quot;vehicle of Jewish influence&quot; and replaced by the Nordic sagas. The Nazi ideology combined the veneration of the &quot;pagan heritage of the ancestors&quot; with puritanical, Christian sexual morality, which the &quot;Nordic&quot; Apollo was supposed to personify.

White supremacist ideologies and neo-Nazism, including ideas of racism, antisemitism, and anti-LGBTQ, have infiltrated or assimilated many Germanic modern pagan movements such as Odinism and some Ásatrú groups, including the Asatru Folk Assembly. These groups believe that the Germanic beliefs they hold constitute the true Caucasoid ethnic religion.

The issue of race is a major source of contention among modern pagans, especially in the United States. In the modern pagan community, one view is that race is entirely a matter of biological heredity, while the opposite position is that race is a social construct rooted in cultural heritage. In US modern pagan discourse, these views are described as völkische and universalist positions, respectively. The two factions, which Jeffrey Kaplan has called the &quot;racist&quot; and &quot;non-racist&quot; camps, often clash, with Kaplan claiming that there is a &quot;virtual civil war&quot; between them within the American modern pagan community. The division into universalists and völkisch also spread to other countries, but had less impact on the more ethnically homogeneous Iceland. A 2015 survey showed that more modern pagans adhere to universalist ideas than völkisch.

Going beyond this binary classification, religious scholar Mattias Gardell divides modern paganism in the United States into three factions according to their racial stance:
* the &quot;anti-racist&quot; faction, which denounces any connection between religion and racial identity
* the &quot;radical-racist&quot; faction, which believes that members of other racial groups should not follow their religion because racial identity is the natural religion of the &quot;Aryan race&quot;
* an &quot;ethnic&quot; faction seeking to forge a middle path by recognizing their religion&#x27;s roots in Northern Europe and its connection to people of Northern European origin

Religious scholar Stephanie von Schnurbein accepted Gardell&#x27;s tripartite division, and referred to these groups as the &quot;aracist&quot;, &quot;racial-religious&quot;, and &quot;ethnic&quot; factions, respectively.

Supporters of the universalist and anti-racist approach believe that the deities of Germanic Europe can call anyone to worship them, regardless of ethnic origin. This group rejects the völkisch focus on race, believing that even unintentionally, such an approach can lead to racist attitudes towards people of non-Northern European origin. Practicing universalists such as Stephan Grundy emphasize that ancient northern Europeans married and had children with members of other ethnic groups, and in Norse mythology, the Æsir did the same with the Vanir, jötnar, and humans, so these modern pagans criticize racist views.

Universalists favorably accept practitioners of modern paganism who are not of Northern European origin; for example, The Troth, based in the United States, has Jewish and African American members, and many of its white members have spouses who belong to different racial groups. While some pagans continue to believe that Germanic paganism is an innate religion, universalists have sometimes argued that this paganism is an innate religion for the lands of Northern Europe and not for a particular race. Universalists often complain that some journalists portray modern paganism as an inherently racist movement, so they use the Internet to highlight their opposition to far-right politics.

In Heathenry, the terms &quot;völkisch&quot;, &quot;neo-völkisch&quot;, or the Anglicised &quot;folkish&quot; are used both as endonyms and exonyms for groups who believe that the religion is closely related to the claimed biological race. Völkisch practitioners consider paganism to be an indigenous religion of a biologically distinct race that is conceptualized as &quot;White&quot;, &quot;Nordic&quot;, &quot;Aryan&quot;, &quot;Northern European&quot;, or &quot;English&quot;. Völkisch modern pagans generally regard these classifications as self-evident, despite the academic consensus that race is a cultural construct.

Völkisch groups often use ethnonationalist language and claim that only members of these racial groups are entitled to practice a given religion, taking the pseudoscientific view that &quot;gods and goddesses are encoded in the DNA&quot; of the members of a race. Some practitioners explain the idea of linking their race and religion by saying that religion is inextricably linked to the collective unconscious of that race. The American modern pagan Stephen McNallen developed these ideas into a concept he called &quot;metagenetics&quot;. McNallen and many other members of the modern pagan &quot;ethnic&quot; faction explicitly state that they are not racist, although Gardell has noted that their views may be considered racist under specific definitions of the term. Gardell considered many &quot;ethnic&quot; modern pagans to be ethnic nationalists.

Many völkisch practitioners disapprove of multiculturalism and racial mixing in modern Europe, advocating racial separatism. In online media, modern pagan völkische often express a belief in the threat of racial miscegenation, which they blame on the social and political establishment, sometimes claiming that their ideas of racial exclusivity are the result of the threat that other ethnic groups pose to &quot;white&quot; people. While these groups generally claim to be aiming to revive Germanic paganism, their race-centric views have their origins in 19th-century culture, not antiquity. This group&#x27;s discourse contains the concepts of &quot;ancestors&quot; and &quot;homeland&quot;, which are understood very vaguely. Researcher Ethan Doyle White characterizes the position of the Odinic Rite and the Odin Brotherhood as &quot;far right&quot;.

Ethnocentric modern pagans are highly critical of their universalist counterparts, often claiming that the latter have been misled by New Age literature and political correctness. Members of the universalist and ethnocentric factions criticize those who adopt an &quot;ethnic&quot; stance. The former view &quot;ethnic&quot; modern paganism as a cover for racism, while the latter view its adherents as race traitors for their refusal to fully accept the superiority of the &quot;white race&quot;.

Some modern pagans of the völkisch movement are white supremacists and outright racists representing a &quot;radical racist&quot; faction that uses the names &quot;Odinism&quot;, &quot;Wotanism&quot;, and &quot;Wodenism&quot;. According to Kaplan, these adepts occupy the &quot;most remote corners&quot; of modern paganism. The lines between this form of modern paganism and Nazism are &quot;extremely thin&quot; because its adherents praise Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany, claim that the &quot;white race&quot; is threatened with extinction by the efforts of a Jewish world conspiracy, and dismiss Christianity as a work of the Jews.

Many in the inner circle of the terrorist organization The Order, a white supremacist militia operating in the US in the 1980s, called themselves Odinists. Various racist modern pagans supported the Fourteen Words slogan, which was developed by The Order member David Lane. Some racist organizations, such as the Order of Nine Angles and the Black Order, combine elements of modern paganism with Satanism, while other racist modern pagans, such as Wotanist Ron McVan, reject the syncretism of the two religions.

American neo-Nazi William Luther Pierce, the founder of the National Alliance, whose ideas stimulated neo-Nazi terrorism, also created the Cosmotheistic Community Church in 1978. He considered the teaching he created within the framework of this church to be pantheism and leaned towards the &quot;Panaryan&quot; Nordic cults. These cults emphasized the idea of a unique closeness of &quot;white people&quot; with nature and the natural &quot;spiritual essence&quot;, which was influenced by the ideas of Savitri Devi. According to the doctrine, each race has its predestined role: &quot;whites&quot; are predisposed to strive for God, blacks strive for laziness, and Jews strive for corruption.

In 1985, Pierce purchased a large piece of land at Mill Point in West Virginia, fenced it in with barbed wire, and began selling books on Western culture and Western &quot;pagan traditions&quot; there. He aimed to save the &quot;white race&quot; away from the federal government. In part, he also drew on British Israelism and the racist religion of Identity Christianity. The &quot;National Alliance&quot; met regularly to discuss the ideas of &quot;cosmotheism&quot;. Pierce dismissed Christianity as &quot;one of the chief mental illnesses of our people&quot; through which &quot;Jewish influence&quot; spreads. Pierce saw the proposed government after the &quot;racial revolution&quot; as religious, which would be &quot;more like a holy order.&quot; He considered the future religion of the &quot;white race&quot; the &quot;Aryan religion&quot; – the &quot;cosmotheism&quot; that he created.

Sociologist Marlène Laruelle notes the activation of &quot;Aryan&quot; modern paganism in the West and Russia. For example, social movements are thus developing that appeal to the Celtic past and call for a return to the &quot;druidic religions&quot; of pre-Christian Europe. For the most part, the French and German &quot;Nouvelle Droite&quot; share the common idea of a pan-European unity based on an &quot;Aryan&quot; identity and the desire to part with Christianity, the period of domination of which is seen as two thousand years of &quot;wandering in darkness.&quot;

Slavic neopaganism (Rodnoverie) has a close connection with Nazism, reproducing its main ideas: the &quot;Aryan&quot; idea, including the idea of the northern ancestral home (in Rodnoverie, it is in the Russian North, the Northern Urals, or beyond the Arctic Circle); the connection of their people with the &quot;Aryans&quot; or complete identification with them (in Rodnovery, &quot;Slavic-Aryans&quot;); the antiquity of one&#x27;s people and its racial or cultural superiority over others; their people (or the ancient &quot;Aryans&quot; identified with them) are regarded as cultural tregers, distributors of high culture, founders of great civilizations of antiquity, (in Rodnoverie, Slavic or &quot;Slavic-Aryan&quot; &quot;Vedic&quot; technological pracivilization, &quot;taught&quot; all other peoples), and creators of ancient writing (in Rodnoverie, Slavic runes); &quot;Aryan&quot; proto-language (in Rodnoverie, &quot;Slavic-Aryan&quot; or Old Slavic), from which all or many other languages of the world originated; reliance on esotericism; orientation to the faith of ancestors (hence paganism); anti-Christianity (the idea that Christians seek to enslave the people) and antisemitism (Jews as &quot;racial enemies&quot;); &quot;Aryan&quot; socialism (an integral part of the ideology of Nazism) as the most natural for its people (in Rodnoverie, the &quot;original tribal system&quot; of the Slavs, which is thought of as a kind of &quot;Aryan&quot; socialism); symbols and gestures close to or derived from Nazism, etc.

One of the main starting points for the formation of Slavic neopaganism was the search for a rationale for the national idea. Hence follows an increased interest in the origins of national self-consciousness and the national type of religiosity. In the post-Soviet period, in the conditions of the loss of the great &quot;empire&quot; (USSR), land, and influence and in search of internal and external enemies, neopaganism became widespread among nationalist ideologues, just like in Germany in the 1930s. In Rodnoverie, the unity of the Russian people was undergoing a new re-mythologization with an appeal for support to the ideas of the &quot;golden age&quot;, the primordial untainted tradition, and the native land.

Historian Dmitry Shlapentokh wrote that, as in Europe, neopaganism in Russia pushes some of its adherents to antisemitism. This antisemitism is closely related to negative attitudes towards Asians, and this emphasis on racial factors can lead neopagans to neo-Nazism. The tendency of neopagans to antisemitism is a logical development of the ideas of neopaganism and imitation of the Nazis and is also a consequence of some specific conditions of modern Russian politics.

Unlike previous regimes, the current Russian political regime and the ideology of the middle class combine support for Orthodoxy with philosemitism and a positive attitude towards Muslims. These features of the regime contributed to the formation of specific views of neo-Nazi neopagans, which are represented to a large extent among the socially unprotected and marginalized Russian youth. In their opinion, power in Russia was usurped by a cabal of conspirators, including hierarchs of the Orthodox Church, Jews, and Muslims. Contrary to external differences, these forces are believed to have united in their desire to maintain power over the Russian &quot;Aryans&quot;.

Some associations of neopaganism, in particular Slavic, are evaluated by researchers as extremist, radical nationalists. In Russia, individual neopagan organizations and essays were included in the list of extremist organizations of the Ministry of Justice of Russia and the Federal List of Extremist Materials, respectively.

The historian and ethnologist Victor Schnirelmann considers Russian neopaganism as a direction of Russian nationalism that denies Russian Orthodoxy as an enduring national value and distinguishes two cardinal tasks that Russian neopaganism sets for itself: the salvation of Russian national culture from the leveling influence of modernization and the protection of the natural environment from the impact of modern civilization. According to Schnirelmann, &quot;Russian neopaganism is a radical variety of conservative ideology, which is distinguished by frank anti-intellectualism and populism.&quot;

Religious scholar Alexei Gaidukov considers it wrong to reduce the diversity of native faith groups to nationalism only – he views the ecological direction of Rodnovery as no less significant. Historian and religious scholar Roman Shizhensky believes Rodnovery poses little danger and law enforcement agencies should deal with radical groups.

The Austrian occultist Guido von List, who created the doctrine of Ariosophy, argued that an ancient developed &quot;Ario-Germanic&quot; culture reached its dawn several millennia before Roman colonization and Christianity. According to him, before Charlemagne&#x27;s forced introduction of Christianity, Wotanism was practiced in what is now the Danubian territory of Germany. List considered Charlemagne the killer of the Saxons in memory of the bloody baptism of the pagans of Northern Germany by him. List considered the entire Christian period as an era of cultural decline, oblivion of the true faith, and unnatural racial mixing, when the &quot;Aryan&quot; ruling caste of priest-kings was forced to hide, secretly saving their sacred knowledge, which now became available to List as a full-fledged aristocratic descendant of this caste.

In Slavic neopaganism, there is the idea of an ancient multi-thousand-year-old and developed civilization of the &quot;Slavs-Aryans&quot;, while the entire Christian period seems to be an era of regression and decline, the enslavement of the &quot;Aryans&quot; by foreign missionaries who imposed on them a &quot;slave&quot; (Christian) ideology. Rodnovers often regard these missionaries as Jews, &quot;Judeo-Masons&quot;, or their accomplices. At the same time, the Slavic &quot;Aryan&quot; volkhvs or priests had to hide in secret places, preserving the knowledge that was now passed onto their direct descendants, Rodnovers.

The idea of the Jewish-Khazar origin of Prince Vladimir the Great is popular, explaining why he introduced Christianity, an instrument for the enslavement of the &quot;Aryans&quot; by Jews, and staged the genocide of the pagan Slavs. Roman Shizhensky singles out the neopagan myth about Vladimir and characterizes it as one of the most &quot;odious&quot; neopagan historical myths and one of the leading Russian neopagan myths in terms of worldview significance.

The author of this myth is Valery Yemelyanov, one of the founders of Russian neopaganism, who expounded it in his book &quot;Dezionization&quot; (1970s). Shizhensky notes that the neopagan myth about Vladimir contradicts scientific work on the issue and the totality of historical sources.

Concerning the trend of convergence of neopagan associations from different countries, Andrey Beskov notes that neopagan nationalism is not an obstacle to &quot;neopagan internationalism&quot;, and anti-globalism, one of the manifestations of which was the popularity of ethnic religions, itself acquires a global character.

===LGBT===

The western LGBT community, often marginalized and/or outright rejected by Abrahamic-predominant mainstream religious establishments, has often sought spiritual acceptance and association in neopagan religious/spiritual practice. Pagan-specializing religious scholar Christine Hoff Kraemer wrote, &quot;Pagans tend to be relatively accepting of same-sex relationships, BDSM, polyamory, transgender people, and other expressions of gender and sexuality that are marginalized by mainstream society.&quot; Conflict naturally arises, however, as some neopagan belief systems and sect ideologies stem from fundamental beliefs in the male–female gender binary, heterosexual pairing, resulting heterosexual reproduction, and/or gender essentialism.

In response, groups and sects inclusive of or specific to LGBT people have developed. Theologian Jone Salomonsen noted in the 1980s and 1990s that the reclaiming movement of San Francisco featured an unusually high number of LGBT people, particularly bisexuals. Margot Adler noted groups whose practices focused on male homosexuality, such as Eddie Buczynski&#x27;s Minoan Brotherhood, a Wiccan sect that combines the iconography from ancient Minoan religion with a Wiccan theology and an emphasis on men who love men, and the eclectic pagan group known as the Radical Faeries. When Adler asked one gay male pagan what the pagan community offered members of the LGBT community, he replied, &quot;A place to belong. Community. Acceptance. And a way to connect with all kinds of people – gay, bi, straight, celibate, transgender – in a way that is hard to do in the greater society.&quot;

Transgender existence and acceptability is especially controversial in many neopagan sects. One of the most notable of these is Dianic Wicca. This female-only, radical feminist variant of Wicca allows cisgender lesbians but not transgender women. This is due to Dianic belief in gender essentialism; according to founder Zsuzsanna Budapest, &quot;you have to have sometimes [sic] in your life a womb, and ovaries and [menstruate] and not die&quot;. This belief and the way it is expressed is often denounced as transphobia and trans-exclusionary radical feminism.

Trans exclusion can also be found in Alexandrian Wicca, whose founder views trans individuals as melancholy people who should seek other beliefs due to the Alexandrian focus on heterosexual reproduction and duality.

===Relationship with the New Age movement===

Since the 1960s and 1970s, contemporary paganism, or neo-paganism, and the then emergent counterculture, New Age, and hippie movements experienced a degree of cross-pollination. An issue of academic debate has been regarding the connection between these movements. Religious studies scholar Sarah Pike asserted that in the United States, there was a &quot;significant overlap&quot; between modern paganism and New Age, while Aidan A. Kelly stated that paganism &quot;parallels the New Age movement in some ways, differs sharply from it in others, and overlaps it in some minor ways&quot;. Ethan Doyle White stated that while the pagan and New Age movements &quot;do share commonalities and overlap&quot;, they were nevertheless &quot;largely distinct phenomena.&quot;
Hanegraaff suggested that whereas various forms of contemporary paganism were not part of the New Age movement – particularly those who pre-dated the movement – other pagan religions and practices could be identified as New Age. Various differences between the two movements have been highlighted; the New Age movement focuses on an improved future, whereas the focus of Paganism is on the pre-Christian past. Similarly, the New Age movement typically propounds a universalist message which sees all religions as fundamentally the same, whereas paganism stresses the difference between monotheistic religions and those embracing a polytheistic or animistic theology. Further, the New Age movement shows little interest in magic and witchcraft, which are conversely core interests of pagan religions such as Wicca.

Many pagans have sought to distance themselves from the New Age movement, even using &quot;New Age&quot; as an insult within their community, while conversely many involved in the New Age have expressed criticism of paganism for emphasizing the material world over the spiritual.
Many pagans have expressed criticism of the high fees charged by New Age teachers, something not typically present in the pagan movement.

===Relationship with Hinduism===
Because of their common links to the Proto-Indo-European culture, many adherents of modern paganism have come to regard Hinduism as a spiritual relative. Some modern pagan literature prominently features comparative religion involving European and Indian traditions. The ECER has made efforts to establish mutual support with Hindu groups, as has the Lithuanian Romuva movement.

In India, a prominent figure who made similar efforts was the Hindu revivalist Ram Swarup, who pointed out parallels between Hinduism and European and Arabic paganism. Swarup reached out to modern pagans in the West and also had an influence on Western converts to Hinduism or pro-Hindu activists, notably David Frawley and Koenraad Elst, who both have described Hinduism as a form of paganism. The modern pagan writer Christopher Gérard has drawn much inspiration from Hinduism and visited Swarup in India. Reviewing Gérard&#x27;s book &quot;Parcours païen&quot; in 2001, the historian of religion Jean-François Mayer described Gérard&#x27;s activities as part of the development of a &quot;Western-Hindu &#x27;pagan axis.

===Prejudice and opposition===

In the Islamic World, pagans are not considered people of the book, so they do not have the same status as Abrahamic religions in Islamic religious law for example, Muslim men cannot marry pagan women while they are allowed to marry among people of the book; and Muslims can eat meat of halal animals that are slaughtered by people of the book, but not that slaughtered by methods of other religions.

Regarding European paganism, In &quot;Modern Paganism in World Cultures: Comparative Perspectives&quot; Michael F. Strmiska writes that &quot;in pagan magazines, websites, and Internet discussion venues, Christianity is frequently denounced as an antinatural, antifemale, sexually and culturally repressive, guilt-ridden, and authoritarian religion that has fostered intolerance, hypocrisy, and persecution throughout the world.&quot; Further, there is a common belief in the pagan community that Christianity and paganism are opposing belief systems. This animosity is flamed by historical conflicts between Christian and pre-Christian religions, as well as the perceived ongoing Christian disdain from Christians. Some pagans have claimed that Christian authorities have never apologized for the religious displacement of Europe&#x27;s pre-Christian belief systems, particularly following the Roman Catholic Church&#x27;s apology for past antisemitism in its &quot;A Reflection on the Shoah&quot;. They also express disapproval of Christianity&#x27;s continued missionary efforts around the globe at the expense of indigenous and other polytheistic faiths.

Some Christian authors have published books criticizing modern paganism, while other Christian critics have equated paganism with Satanism, which is often portrayed as such in mainstream entertainment industry.

In areas such as the US Bible Belt, where conservative Christian dominance is strong, pagans have faced continued religious persecution. For instance, Strmiska highlighted instances in both the US and UK in which school teachers were fired when their employers discovered that they were pagan. Thus, many pagans keep their religion private to avoid discrimination and ostracism.

===Pagan studies===

The earliest academic studies of contemporary paganism were published in the late 1970s and 1980s by scholars like Margot Adler, Marcello Truzzi and Tanya Luhrmann, although it was not until the 1990s that the actual academic field of pagan studies properly developed, pioneered by academics such as Graham Harvey and Chas S. Clifton. Increasing academic interest in paganism has been attributed to the new religious movement&#x27;s increasing public visibility, as it began interacting with the interfaith movement and holding large public celebrations at sites like Stonehenge.

The first international academic conference on the subject of pagan studies was held at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, North-East England in 1993. It was organised by two British religious studies scholars, Graham Harvey and Charlotte Hardman. In April 1996 a larger conference dealing with contemporary paganism took place at Ambleside in the Lake District. Organised by the Department of Religious Studies at the University of Lancaster, North-West England, it was entitled &quot;Nature Religion Today: Western Paganism, Shamanism and Esotericism in the 1990s&quot;, and led to the publication of an academic anthology, entitled &quot;Nature Religion Today: Paganism in the Modern World&quot;. In 2004, the first peer-reviewed, academic journal devoted to pagan studies began publication. &quot;The Pomegranate: The International Journal of Pagan Studies&quot; was edited by Clifton, while the academic publishers AltaMira Press began release of the Pagan Studies Series. From 2008 onward, conferences have been held bringing together scholars specialising in the study of paganism in Central and Eastern Europe.

The relationship between pagan studies scholars and some practising pagans has at times been strained. The Australian academic and practising pagan Caroline Jane Tully argues that many pagans can react negatively to new scholarship regarding historical pre-Christian societies, believing that it is a threat to the structure of their beliefs and to their &quot;sense of identity&quot;. She furthermore argues that some of those dissatisfied pagans lashed out against academics as a result, particularly on the Internet.

== Criticism ==

Neopaganism has been criticized on a variety of fronts, ranging from pseudohistory to racial issues to institutional issues. As neopaganism is not a unified religion, it means that the criticisms of certain groups often do not apply to other groups. Criticisms of specific neopagan groups range from criticisms of their belief in gender essentialism to criticisms of some belief in nationalism.

<text>NTSC (from National Television System Committee) is the first American standard for analog television, published and adopted in 1941. In 1961, it was assigned the designation System M. It is also known as EIA standard 170.

In 1953, a second NTSC standard was adopted, which allowed for color television broadcast compatible with the existing stock of black-and-white receivers. It is one of three major color formats for analog television, the others being PAL and SECAM. &quot;NTSC color&quot; is usually associated with the System M; this combination is sometimes called NTSC II. The only other broadcast television system to use NTSC color was the System J. Brazil used System M with PAL color. Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos used System M with SECAM color - Vietnam later started using PAL in the early 1990s.

The NTSC/System M standard was used in most of the Americas (except Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay), Myanmar, South Korea, Taiwan, Philippines, Japan, and some Pacific Islands nations and territories (see map).

Since the introduction of digital sources (ex: DVD) the term NTSC has been used to refer to digital formats with number of active lines between 480 and 487 having 30 or 29.97 frames per second rate, serving as a digital shorthand to System M. The so-called &quot;NTSC-Film standard&quot; has a digital standard resolution of 720 × 480 pixel for DVD-Videos, 480 × 480 pixel for Super Video CDs (SVCD, Aspect Ratio: 4:3) and 352 × 240 pixel for Video CDs (VCD). The digital video (DV) camcorder format that is equivalent to NTSC is 720 × 480 pixels. The digital television (DTV) equivalent is 704 × 480 pixels.

== History ==
The National Television System Committee was established in 1940 by the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to resolve the conflicts between companies over the introduction of a nationwide analog television system in the United States. In March 1941, the committee issued a technical standard for black-and-white television that built upon a 1936 recommendation made by the Radio Manufacturers Association (RMA). Technical advancements of the vestigial side band technique allowed for the opportunity to increase the image resolution. The NTSC selected 525 scan lines as a compromise between RCA&#x27;s 441-scan line standard (already being used by RCA&#x27;s NBC TV network) and Philco&#x27;s and DuMont&#x27;s desire to increase the number of scan lines to between 605 and 800. The standard recommended a frame rate of 30 frames (images) per second, consisting of two interlaced fields per frame at 262.5 lines per field and 60 fields per second. Other standards in the final recommendation were an aspect ratio of 4:3, and frequency modulation (FM) for the sound signal (which was quite new at the time).

In January 1950, the committee was reconstituted to standardize color television. The FCC had briefly approved a 405-line field-sequential color television standard in October 1950, which was developed by CBS. The CBS system was incompatible with existing black-and-white receivers. It used a rotating color wheel, reduced the number of scan lines from 525 to 405, and increased the field rate from 60 to 144, but had an effective frame rate of only 24 frames per second. Legal action by rival RCA kept commercial use of the system off the air until June 1951, and regular broadcasts only lasted a few months before manufacture of all color television sets was banned by the Office of Defense Mobilization in October, ostensibly due to the Korean War. A variant of the CBS system was later used by NASA to broadcast pictures of astronauts from space. CBS rescinded its system in March 1953, and the FCC replaced it on December 17, 1953, with the NTSC color standard, which was cooperatively developed by several companies, including RCA and Philco.

In December 1953, the FCC unanimously approved what is now called the &quot;NTSC&quot; color television standard (later defined as RS-170a). The compatible color standard retained full backward compatibility with then-existing black-and-white television sets. Color information was added to the black-and-white image by introducing a color subcarrier of precisely 315/88 MHz (usually described as 3.579545 MHz±10 Hz). The precise frequency was chosen so that horizontal line-rate modulation components of the chrominance signal fall exactly in between the horizontal line-rate modulation components of the luminance signal, such that the chrominance signal could easily be filtered out of the luminance signal on new television sets, and that it would be minimally visible in existing televisions. Due to limitations of frequency divider circuits at the time the color standard was promulgated, the color subcarrier frequency was constructed as composite frequency assembled from small integers, in this case 5×7×9/(8×11) MHz. The horizontal line rate was reduced to approximately 15,734 lines per second (3.579545×2/455 MHz = 9/572 MHz) from 15,750 lines per second, and the frame rate was reduced to 30/1.001 ≈ 29.970 frames per second (the horizontal line rate divided by 525 lines/frame) from 30 frames per second. These changes amounted to 0.1 percent and were readily tolerated by then-existing television receivers.

The first publicly announced network television broadcast of a program using the NTSC &quot;compatible color&quot; system was an episode of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Kukla, Fran and Ollie&quot; on August 30, 1953, although it was viewable in color only at the network&#x27;s headquarters. The first nationwide viewing of NTSC color came on the following January 1 with the coast-to-coast broadcast of the Tournament of Roses Parade, viewable on prototype color receivers at special presentations across the country. The first color NTSC television camera was the RCA TK-40, used for experimental broadcasts in 1953; an improved version, the TK-40A, introduced in March 1954, was the first commercially available color television camera. Later that year, the improved TK-41 became the standard camera used throughout much of the 1960s.

The NTSC standard has been adopted by other countries, including some in the Americas and Japan.

== Digital conversion ==
With the advent of digital television, analog broadcasts were largely phased out. Most US NTSC broadcasters were required by the FCC to shut down their analog transmitters by February 17, 2009, however this was later moved to June 12, 2009. Low-power stations, Class A stations and translators were required to shut down by 2015, although an FCC extension allowed some of those stations operating on Channel 6 to operate until July 13, 2021. The remaining Canadian analog TV transmitters, in markets not subject to the mandatory transition in 2011, were scheduled to be shut down by January 14, 2022, under a schedule published by Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada in 2017; however the scheduled transition dates have already passed for several stations listed that continue to broadcast in analog (e.g. CFJC-TV Kamloops, which has not yet transitioned to digital, is listed as having been required to transition by November 20, 2020).

Most countries using the NTSC standard, as well as those using other analog television standards, have switched to, or are in process of switching to, newer digital television standards, with there being at least four different standards in use around the world. North America, parts of Central America, and South Korea are adopting or have adopted the ATSC standards, while other countries, such as Japan, are adopting or have adopted other standards instead of ATSC. After nearly 70 years, the majority of over-the-air NTSC transmissions in the United States ceased on June 12, 2009, and by August 31, 2011, in Canada and most other NTSC markets. The majority of NTSC transmissions ended in Japan on July 24, 2011, with the Japanese prefectures of Iwate, Miyagi, and Fukushima ending the next year. After a pilot program in 2013, most full-power analog stations in Mexico left the air on ten dates in 2015, with some 500 low-power and repeater stations allowed to remain in analog until the end of 2016. Digital broadcasting allows higher-resolution television, but digital standard definition television continues to use the frame rate and number of lines of resolution established by the analog NTSC standard.

== Technical details ==

=== Resolution and refresh rate ===
NTSC color encoding is used with the System M television signal, which consists of  (approximately 29.97) interlaced frames of video per second. Each frame is composed of two fields, each consisting of 262.5 scan lines, for a total of 525 scan lines. The visible raster is made up of 486 scan lines. The later digital standard, Rec. 601, only uses 480 of these lines for visible raster. The remainder (the vertical blanking interval) allow for vertical synchronization and retrace. This blanking interval was originally designed to simply blank the electron beam of the receiver&#x27;s CRT to allow for the simple analog circuits and slow vertical retrace of early TV receivers. However, some of these lines may now contain other data such as closed captioning and vertical interval timecode (VITC). In the complete raster (disregarding half lines due to interlacing) the even-numbered scan lines (every other line that would be even if counted in the video signal, e.g. {2, 4, 6, ..., 524}) are drawn in the first field, and the odd-numbered (every other line that would be odd if counted in the video signal, e.g. {1, 3, 5, ..., 525}) are drawn in the second field, to yield a flicker-free image at the field refresh frequency of  Hz (approximately 59.94 Hz). For comparison, 625 lines (576 visible) systems, usually used with PAL-B/G and SECAM color, and so have a higher vertical resolution, but a lower temporal resolution of 25 frames or 50 fields per second.

The NTSC field refresh frequency in the black-and-white system originally exactly matched the nominal 60 Hz frequency of alternating current power used in the United States. Matching the field refresh rate to the power source avoided intermodulation (also called &quot;beating&quot;), which produces rolling bars on the screen. Synchronization of the refresh rate to the power incidentally helped kinescope cameras record early live television broadcasts, as it was very simple to synchronize a film camera to capture one frame of video on each film frame by using the alternating current frequency to set the speed of the synchronous AC motor-drive camera. This, as mentioned, is how the NTSC field refresh frequency worked in the original black-and-white system; when &quot;color&quot; was added to the system, however, the refresh frequency was shifted slightly downward by 0.1%, to approximately 59.94 Hz, to eliminate stationary dot patterns in the difference frequency between the sound and color carriers (as explained below in §Color encoding). By the time the frame rate changed to accommodate color, it was nearly as easy to trigger the camera shutter from the video signal itself.

The actual figure of 525 lines was chosen as a consequence of the limitations of the vacuum-tube-based technologies of the day. In early TV systems, a master voltage-controlled oscillator was run at twice the horizontal line frequency, and this frequency was divided down by the number of lines used (in this case 525) to give the field frequency (60 Hz in this case). This frequency was then compared with the 60 Hz power-line frequency and any discrepancy corrected by adjusting the frequency of the master oscillator. For interlaced scanning, an odd number of lines per frame was required in order to make the vertical retrace distance identical for the odd and even fields, which meant the master oscillator frequency had to be divided down by an odd number. At the time, the only practical method of frequency division was the use of a chain of vacuum tube multivibrators, the overall division ratio being the mathematical product of the division ratios of the chain. Since all the factors of an odd number also have to be odd numbers, it follows that all the dividers in the chain also had to divide by odd numbers, and these had to be relatively small due to the problems of thermal drift with vacuum tube devices. The closest practical sequence to 500 that meets these criteria was . (For the same reason, 625-line PAL-B/G and SECAM uses , the old British 405-line system used , the French 819-line system used etc.)

=== Colorimetry ===


Colorimetry refers to the specific colorimetric characteristics of the system and its components, including the specific primary colors used, the camera, the display, etc. Over its history, NTSC color had two distinctly defined colorimetries, shown on the accompanying chromaticity diagram as NTSC 1953 and SMPTE C. Manufacturers introduced a number of variations for technical, economic, marketing, and other reasons.

==== NTSC 1953 ====
The original 1953 color NTSC specification, still part of the United States Code of Federal Regulations, defined the colorimetric values of the system as shown in the above table.

Early color television receivers, such as the RCA CT-100, were faithful to this specification (which was based on prevailing motion picture standards), having a larger gamut than most of today&#x27;s monitors. Their low-efficiency phosphors (notably in the Red) were weak and long-persistent, leaving trails after moving objects. Starting in the late 1950s, picture tube phosphors would sacrifice saturation for increased brightness; this deviation from the standard at both the receiver and broadcaster was the source of considerable color variation.

==== SMPTE C ====
To ensure more uniform color reproduction, some manufacturers incorporated color correction circuits into sets, that converted the received signal—encoded for the colorimetric values listed above—adjusting for the actual phosphor characteristics used within the monitor. Since such color correction can not be performed accurately on the nonlinear gamma corrected signals transmitted, the adjustment can only be approximated, introducing both hue and luminance errors for highly saturated colors.

Similarly at the broadcaster stage, in 1968–69 the Conrac Corp., working with RCA, defined a set of controlled phosphors for use in broadcast color picture video monitors. This specification survives today as the SMPTE C phosphor specification:

As with home receivers, it was further recommended that studio monitors incorporate similar color correction circuits so that broadcasters would transmit pictures encoded for the original 1953 colorimetric values, in accordance with FCC standards.

In 1987, the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) Committee on Television Technology, Working Group on Studio Monitor Colorimetry, adopted the SMPTE C (Conrac) phosphors for general use in Recommended Practice 145, prompting many manufacturers to modify their camera designs to directly encode for SMPTE C colorimetry without color correction, as approved in SMPTE standard 170M, &quot;Composite Analog Video Signal – NTSC for Studio Applications&quot; (1994). As a consequence, the ATSC digital television standard states that for 480i signals, SMPTE C colorimetry should be assumed unless colorimetric data is included in the transport stream.

Japanese NTSC never changed primaries and whitepoint to SMPTE C, continuing to use the 1953 NTSC primaries and whitepoint. Both the PAL and SECAM systems used the original 1953 NTSC colorimetry as well until 1970; unlike NTSC, however, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) rejected color correction in receivers and studio monitors that year and instead explicitly called for all equipment to directly encode signals for the &quot;EBU&quot; colorimetric values.

==== Color compatibility issues ====
In reference to the gamuts shown on the CIE chromaticity diagram (above), the variations between the different colorimetries can result in significant visual differences. To adjust for proper viewing requires gamut mapping via LUTs or additional color grading. SMPTE Recommended Practice RP 167-1995 refers to such an automatic correction as an &quot;NTSC corrective display matrix.&quot; For instance, material prepared for 1953 NTSC may look desaturated when displayed on SMPTE C or ATSC/BT.709 displays, and may also exhibit noticeable hue shifts. On the other hand, SMPTE C materials may appear slightly more saturated on BT.709/sRGB displays, or significantly more saturated on P3 displays, if the appropriate gamut mapping is not performed.

=== Color encoding ===


NTSC uses a luminance-chrominance encoding system, incorporating concepts invented in 1938 by Georges Valensi. Using a separate luminance signal maintained backward compatibility with black-and-white television sets in use at the time; only color sets would recognize the chroma signal, which was essentially ignored by black and white sets.

The red, green, and blue primary color signals formula_1 are weighted and summed into a single luma signal, designated formula_2 (Y prime) which takes the place of the original monochrome signal. The color difference information is encoded into the chrominance signal, which carries only the color information. This allows black-and-white receivers to display NTSC color signals by simply ignoring the chrominance signal. Some black-and-white TVs sold in the U.S. after the introduction of color broadcasting in 1953 were designed to filter chroma out, but the early B&amp;W sets did not do this and chrominance could be seen as a crawling dot pattern in areas of the picture that held saturated colors.

To derive the separate signals containing only color information, the difference is determined between each color primary and the summed luma. Thus the red difference signal is formula_3 and the blue difference signal is formula_4. These difference signals are then used to derive two new color signals known as formula_5 (in-phase) and formula_6 (in quadrature) in a process called QAM. The formula_7 color space is rotated relative to the difference signal color space, such that orange-blue color information (which the human eye is most sensitive to) is transmitted on the formula_5 signal at 1.3 MHz bandwidth, while the formula_6 signal encodes purple-green color information at 0.4 MHz bandwidth; this allows the chrominance signal to use less overall bandwidth without noticeable color degradation. The two signals each amplitude modulate 3.58 MHz carriers which are 90 degrees out of phase with each other and the result added together but with the carriers themselves being suppressed. The result can be viewed as a single sine wave with varying phase relative to a reference carrier and with varying amplitude. The varying phase represents the instantaneous color hue captured by a TV camera, and the amplitude represents the instantaneous color saturation. The  MHz subcarrier is then added to the Luminance to form the composite color signal which modulates the video signal carrier. 3.58 MHz is often stated as an abbreviation instead of 3.579545 MHz.

For a color TV to recover hue information from the color subcarrier, it must have a zero-phase reference to replace the previously suppressed carrier. The NTSC signal includes a short sample of this reference signal, known as the colorburst, located on the back porch of each horizontal synchronization pulse. The color burst consists of a minimum of eight cycles of the unmodulated (pure original) color subcarrier. The TV receiver has a local oscillator, which is synchronized with these color bursts to create a reference signal. Combining this reference phase signal with the chrominance signal allows the recovery of the formula_5 and formula_6 signals, which in conjunction with the formula_2 signal, is reconstructed to the individual formula_13 signals, that are then sent to the CRT to form the image.

In CRT televisions, the NTSC signal is turned into three color signals: red, green, and blue, each controlling an electron gun that is designed to excite only the corresponding red, green, or blue phosphor dots. TV sets with digital circuitry use sampling techniques to process the signals but the result is the same. For both analog and digital sets processing an analog NTSC signal, the original three color signals are transmitted using three discrete signals (Y, I and Q) and then recovered as three separate colors (R, G, and B) and presented as a color image.

When a transmitter broadcasts an NTSC signal, it amplitude-modulates a radio-frequency carrier with the NTSC signal just described, while it frequency-modulates a carrier 4.5 MHz higher with the audio signal. If non-linear distortion happens to the broadcast signal, the  MHz color carrier may beat with the sound carrier to produce a dot pattern on the screen. To make the resulting pattern less noticeable, designers adjusted the original 15,750 Hz scanline rate down by a factor of 1.001 (%) to match the audio carrier frequency divided by the factor 286, resulting in a field rate of approximately 59.94 Hz. This adjustment ensures that the difference between the sound carrier and the color subcarrier (the most problematic intermodulation product of the two carriers) is an odd multiple of half the line rate, which is the necessary condition for the dots on successive lines to be opposite in phase, making them least noticeable.

The 59.94 rate is derived from the following calculations. Designers chose to make the chrominance subcarrier frequency an &quot;n&quot; + 0.5 multiple of the line frequency to minimize interference between the luminance signal and the chrominance signal. (Another way this is often stated is that the color subcarrier frequency is an odd multiple of half the line frequency.) They then chose to make the audio subcarrier frequency an integer multiple of the line frequency to minimize visible (intermodulation) interference between the audio signal and the chrominance signal. The original black-and-white standard, with its 15,750 Hz line frequency and 4.5 MHz audio subcarrier, does not meet these requirements, so designers had to either raise the audio subcarrier frequency or lower the line frequency. Raising the audio subcarrier frequency would prevent existing (black and white) receivers from properly tuning in the audio signal. Lowering the line frequency is comparatively innocuous, because the horizontal and vertical synchronization information in the NTSC signal allows a receiver to tolerate a substantial amount of variation in the line frequency. So the engineers chose the line frequency to be changed for the color standard. In the black-and-white standard, the ratio of audio subcarrier frequency to line frequency is   . In the color standard, this becomes rounded to the integer 286, which means the color standard&#x27;s line rate is  ≈  Hz. Maintaining the same number of scan lines per field (and frame), the lower line rate must yield a lower field rate. Dividing lines per second by 262.5 lines per field gives approximately 59.94 fields per second.

=== Transmission modulation method ===
An NTSC television channel as transmitted occupies a total bandwidth of 6 MHz. The actual video signal, which is amplitude-modulated, is transmitted between 500 kHz and 5.45 MHz above the lower bound of the channel. The video carrier is 1.25 MHz above the lower bound of the channel. Like most AM signals, the video carrier generates two sidebands, one above the carrier and one below. The sidebands are each 4.2 MHz wide. The entire upper sideband is transmitted, but only 1.25 MHz of the lower sideband, known as a vestigial sideband, is transmitted. The color subcarrier, as noted above, is 3.579545 MHz above the video carrier, and is quadrature-amplitude-modulated with a suppressed carrier. The audio signal is frequency-modulated, like the audio signals broadcast by FM radio stations in the 88–108 MHz band, but with a 25 kHz maximum frequency deviation, as opposed to 75 kHz as is used on the FM band, making analog television audio signals sound quieter than FM radio signals as received on a wideband receiver. The main audio carrier is 4.5 MHz above the video carrier, making it 250 kHz below the top of the channel. Sometimes a channel may contain an MTS signal, which offers more than one audio signal by adding one or two subcarriers on the audio signal, each synchronized to a multiple of the line frequency. This is normally the case when stereo audio and/or second audio program signals are used. The same extensions are used in ATSC, where the ATSC digital carrier is broadcast at 0.31 MHz above the lower bound of the channel.

&quot;Setup&quot; is a 54 mV (7.5 IRE) voltage offset between the &quot;black&quot; and &quot;blanking&quot; levels. It is unique to NTSC. CVBS stands for Color, Video, Blanking, and Sync.

The following table shows the values for the basic RGB colors, encoded in NTSC

=== Frame rate conversion ===
There is a large difference in frame rate between film, which runs at 24 frames per second, and the NTSC standard, which runs at approximately 29.97 (10 MHz×63/88/455/525) frames per second.

In regions that use 25-fps television and video standards, this difference can be overcome by speed-up.

For 30-fps standards, a process called &quot;3:2 pulldown&quot; is used. One film frame is transmitted for three video fields (lasting  video frames), and the next frame is transmitted for two video fields (lasting 1 video frame). Two film frames are thus transmitted in five video fields, for an average of  video fields per film frame. The average frame rate is thus 60 ÷ 2.5 = 24 frames per second, so the average film speed is nominally exactly what it should be. (In reality, over the course of an hour of real time, 215,827.2 video fields are displayed, representing 86,330.88 frames of film, while in an hour of true 24-fps film projection, exactly 86,400 frames are shown: thus, 29.97-fps NTSC transmission of 24-fps film runs at 99.92% of the film&#x27;s normal speed.) Still-framing on playback can display a video frame with fields from two different film frames, so any difference between the frames will appear as a rapid back-and-forth flicker. There can also be noticeable jitter/&quot;stutter&quot; during slow camera pans (telecine judder).

Film shot specifically for NTSC television is usually taken at 30 (instead of 24) frames per second to avoid 3:2 pulldown.

To show 25-fps material (such as European television series and some European movies) on NTSC equipment, every fifth frame is duplicated and then the resulting stream is interlaced.

Film shot for NTSC television at 24 frames per second has traditionally been accelerated by 1/24 (to about 104.17% of normal speed) for transmission in regions that use 25-fps television standards. This increase in picture speed has traditionally been accompanied by a similar increase in the pitch and tempo of the audio. More recently, frame-blending has been used to convert 24 FPS video to 25 FPS without altering its speed.

Film shot for television in regions that use 25-fps television standards can be handled in either of two ways:
* The film can be shot at 24 frames per second. In this case, when transmitted in its native region, the film may be accelerated to 25 fps according to the analog technique described above, or kept at 24 fps by the digital technique described above. When the same film is transmitted in regions that use a nominal 30-fps television standard, there is no noticeable change in speed, tempo, and pitch.
* The film can be shot at 25 frames per second. In this case, when transmitted in its native region, the film is shown at its normal speed, with no alteration of the accompanying soundtrack. When the same film is shown in regions that use a 30-fps nominal television standard, every fifth frame is duplicated, and there is still no noticeable change in speed, tempo, and pitch.

Because both film speeds have been used in 25-fps regions, viewers can face confusion about the true speed of video and audio, and the pitch of voices, sound effects, and musical performances, in television films from those regions. For example, they may wonder whether the Jeremy Brett series of Sherlock Holmes television films, made in the 1980s and early 1990s, was shot at 24 fps and then transmitted at an artificially fast speed in 25-fps regions, or whether it was shot at 25 fps natively and then slowed to 24 fps for NTSC exhibition.

These discrepancies exist not only in television broadcasts over the air and through cable, but also in the home-video market, on both tape and disc, including laser disc and DVD.

In digital television and video, which are replacing their analog predecessors, single standards that can accommodate a wider range of frame rates still show the limits of analog regional standards. The initial version of the ATSC standard, for example, allowed frame rates of 23.976, 24, 29.97, 30, 59.94, 60, 119.88 and 120 frames per second, but not 25 and 50. Modern ATSC allows 25 and 50 FPS.

=== Modulation for analog satellite transmission ===
Because satellite power is severely limited, analog video transmission through satellites differs from terrestrial TV transmission. AM is a linear modulation method, so a given demodulated signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) requires an equally high received RF SNR. The SNR of studio quality video is over 50 dB, so AM would require prohibitively high powers and/or large antennas.

Wideband FM is used instead to trade RF bandwidth for reduced power. Increasing the channel bandwidth from 6 to 36 MHz allows a RF SNR of only 10 dB or less. The wider noise bandwidth reduces this 40 dB power saving by 36 MHz / 6 MHz = 8 dB for a substantial net reduction of 32 dB.

Sound is on an FM subcarrier as in terrestrial transmission, but frequencies above 4.5 MHz are used to reduce aural/visual interference. 6.8, 5.8 and 6.2 MHz are commonly used. Stereo can be multiplex, discrete, or matrix and unrelated audio and data signals may be placed on additional subcarriers.

A triangular 60 Hz energy dispersal waveform is added to the composite baseband signal (video plus audio and data subcarriers) before modulation. This limits the satellite downlink power spectral density in case the video signal is lost. Otherwise the satellite might transmit all of its power on a single frequency, interfering with terrestrial microwave links in the same frequency band.

In half transponder mode, the frequency deviation of the composite baseband signal is reduced to 18 MHz to allow another signal in the other half of the 36 MHz transponder. This reduces the FM benefit somewhat, and the recovered SNRs are further reduced because the combined signal power must be &quot;backed off&quot; to avoid intermodulation distortion in the satellite transponder. A single FM signal is constant amplitude, so it can saturate a transponder without distortion.

=== Field order ===
An NTSC &quot;frame&quot; consists of two &quot;fields,&quot; F1 (field one) and F2 (field two). The field dominance depends on a combination of factors, including decisions by various equipment manufacturers as well as historical conventions. As a result, most professional equipment has the option to switch between a dominant upper or dominant lower field. It is not advisable to use the terms &quot;even&quot; or &quot;odd&quot; when speaking of fields, due to substantial ambiguity. For instance if the line numbering for a particular system starts at zero, while another system starts its line numbering at one. As such the same field could be even or odd.

While an analog television set does not care about field dominance per se, field dominance is important when editing NTSC video. Incorrect interpretation of field order can cause a shuddering effect as moving objects jump forward and behind on each successive field.

This is of particular importance when interlaced NTSC is transcoded to a format with a different field dominance and vice versa. Field order is also important when transcoding progressive video to interlaced NTSC, as any place there is a cut between two scenes in the progressive video, there could be a flash field in the interlaced video if the field dominance is incorrect. The film telecine process where a three-two pull down is utilized to convert 24 frames to 30, will also provide unacceptable results if the field order is incorrect.

Because each field is temporally unique for material captured with an interlaced camera, converting interlaced to a digital progressive-frame medium is difficult, as each progressive frame will have artifacts of motion on every alternating line. This can be observed in PC-based video-playing utilities and is frequently solved simply by transcoding the video at half resolution and only using one of the two available fields.

== Variants ==

=== NTSC-M ===
Unlike PAL and SECAM, with its many varied underlying broadcast television systems in use throughout the world, NTSC color encoding is almost invariably used with broadcast system M, giving NTSC-M.

=== NTSC-N and NTSC 50 ===
NTSC-N was originally proposed in the 1960s to the CCIR as a 50 Hz broadcast method for System N countries Paraguay, Uruguay and Argentina before they chose PAL. In 1978, with the introduction of Apple II Europlus, it was effectively reintroduced as &quot;NTSC 50&quot;, a pseudo-system combining 625-line video with 3.58 MHz NTSC color. For example, an Atari ST running PAL software on their NTSC color display used this system as the monitor could not decode PAL color. Most analog NTSC television sets and monitors with a V-Hold knob can display this system after adjusting the vertical hold.

=== NTSC-J ===
Only Japan&#x27;s variant &quot;NTSC-J&quot; is slightly different: in Japan, black level and blanking level of the signal are identical (at 0 IRE), as they are in PAL, while in American NTSC, black level is slightly higher (7.5 IRE) than blanking level. Since the difference is quite small, a slight turn of the brightness knob is all that is required to correctly show the &quot;other&quot; variant of NTSC on any set as it is supposed to be; most watchers might not even notice the difference in the first place. The channel encoding on NTSC-J differs slightly from NTSC-M. In particular, the Japanese VHF band runs from channels 1–12 (located on frequencies directly above the 76–90 MHz Japanese FM radio band) while the North American VHF TV band uses channels 2–13 (54–72 MHz, 76–88 MHz and 174–216 MHz) with 88–108 MHz allocated to FM radio broadcasting. Japan&#x27;s UHF TV channels are therefore numbered from 13 up and not 14 up, but otherwise uses the same UHF broadcasting frequencies as those in North America.

=== NTSC 4.43 ===
NTSC 4.43 is a pseudo-system that transmits a NTSC color subcarrier of 4.43 MHz instead of 3.58 MHz The resulting output is only viewable by TVs that support the resulting pseudo-system (such as most PAL TVs). Using a native NTSC TV to decode the signal yields no color, while using an incompatible PAL TV to decode the system yields erratic colors (observed to be lacking red and flickering randomly). The format was used by the USAF TV based in Germany during the Cold War and Hong Kong Cable Television. It was also found as an optional output on some LaserDisc players sold in markets where the PAL system is used.

The NTSC 4.43 system, while not a broadcast format, appears most often as a playback function of PAL cassette format VCRs, beginning with the Sony 3/4&quot; U-Matic format and then following onto Betamax and VHS format machines, commonly advertised as &quot;NTSC playback on PAL TV&quot;.

Multi-standard video monitors were already in use in Europe to accommodate broadcast sources in PAL, SECAM, and NTSC video formats. The heterodyne color-under process of U-Matic, Betamax &amp; VHS lent itself to minor modification of VCR players to accommodate NTSC format cassettes. The color-under format of VHS uses a 629 kHz subcarrier while U-Matic &amp; Betamax use a 688 kHz subcarrier to carry an &quot;amplitude modulated&quot; chroma signal for both NTSC and PAL formats. Since the VCR was ready to play the color portion of the NTSC recording using PAL color mode, the PAL scanner and capstan speeds had to be adjusted from PAL&#x27;s 50 Hz field rate to NTSC&#x27;s 59.94 Hz field rate, and faster linear tape speed.

The changes to the PAL VCR are minor thanks to the existing VCR recording formats. The output of the VCR when playing an NTSC cassette in NTSC 4.43 mode is 525 lines/29.97 frames per second with PAL compatible heterodyned color. The multi-standard receiver is already set to support the NTSC H &amp; V frequencies; it just needs to do so while receiving PAL color.

The existence of those multi-standard receivers was probably part of the drive for region coding of DVDs. As the color signals are component on disc for all display formats, almost no changes would be required for PAL DVD players to play NTSC (525/29.97) discs as long as the display was frame-rate compatible.

=== OSKM (USSR-NTSC) ===
In January 1960, (7 years prior to adoption of the modified SECAM version) the experimental TV studio in Moscow started broadcasting using the OSKM system. OSKM was the version of NTSC adapted to European D/K 625/50 standard. The OSKM abbreviation means &quot;Simultaneous system with quadrature modulation&quot; (In Russian: Одновременная Система с Квадратурной Модуляцией). It used the color coding scheme that was later used in PAL (U and V instead of I and Q).

The color subcarrier frequency was 4.4296875 MHz and the bandwidth of U and V signals was near 1.5 MHz. Only circa 4000 TV sets of 4 models (Raduga, Temp-22, Izumrud-201 and Izumrud-203) were produced for studying the real quality of TV reception. These TV&#x27;s were not commercially available, despite being included in the goods catalog for trade network of the USSR.

The broadcasting with this system lasted about 3 years and was ceased well before SECAM transmissions started in the USSR. None of the current multi-standard TV receivers can support this TV system.

=== NTSC-film ===

Film content commonly shot at 24 frames/s can be converted to 30 frames/s through the telecine process to duplicate frames as needed.
:formula_14

Mathematically for NTSC this is relatively simple as it is only needed to duplicate every fourth frame. Various techniques are employed. NTSC with an actual frame rate of   (approximately 23.976) frames/s is often defined as NTSC-film. A process known as pullup, also known as pulldown, generates the duplicated frames upon playback. This method is common for H.262/MPEG-2 Part 2 digital video so the original content is preserved and played back on equipment that can display it or can be converted for equipment that cannot.

== Comparative quality ==


For NTSC, and to a lesser extent, PAL, reception problems can degrade the color accuracy of the picture where ghosting can dynamically change the phase of the color burst with picture content, thus altering the color balance of the signal. The only receiver compensation is in the professional TV receiver ghost canceling circuits used by cable companies. The vacuum-tube electronics used in televisions through the 1960s led to various technical problems. Among other things, the color burst phase would often drift. In addition, the TV studios did not always transmit properly, leading to hue changes when channels were changed, which is why NTSC televisions were equipped with a tint control. PAL and SECAM televisions had less of a need for one. SECAM in particular was very robust, but PAL, while excellent in maintaining skin tones which viewers are particularly sensitive to, nevertheless would distort other colors in the face of phase errors. With phase errors, only &quot;Deluxe PAL&quot; receivers would get rid of &quot;Hanover bars&quot; distortion. Hue controls are still found on NTSC TVs, but color drifting generally ceased to be a problem for more modern circuitry by the 1970s. When compared to PAL, in particular, NTSC color accuracy and consistency were sometimes considered inferior, leading to video professionals and television engineers jokingly referring to NTSC as &quot;Never The Same Color&quot;, &quot;Never Twice the Same Color&quot;, or &quot;No True Skin Colors&quot;, while for the more expensive PAL system it was necessary to &quot;Pay for Additional Luxury&quot;.

The use of NTSC coded color in S-Video systems, as well as the use of closed-circuit composite NTSC, both eliminate the phase distortions because there is no reception ghosting in a closed-circuit system to smear the color burst. For VHS videotape on the horizontal axis and frame rate of the three color systems when used with this scheme, the use of S-Video gives the higher resolution picture quality on monitors and TVs without a high-quality motion-compensated comb filtering section. (The NTSC resolution on the vertical axis is lower than the European standards, 525 lines against 625.) However, it uses too much bandwidth for over-the-air transmission. The Atari 800 and Commodore 64 home computers generate S-video, but only when used with specially designed monitors as no TV at the time supported the separate chroma and luma on standard RCA jacks. In 1987, a standardized four-pin mini-DIN socket was introduced for S-video input with the introduction of S-VHS players, which were the first device produced to use the four-pin plugs. However, S-VHS never became very popular. Video game consoles in the 1990s began offering S-video output as well.

== Vertical interval reference ==
The standard NTSC video image contains some lines (lines 1–21 of each field) that are not visible (this is known as the Vertical Blanking Interval, or VBI); all are beyond the edge of the viewable image, but only lines 1–9 are used for the vertical-sync and equalizing pulses. The remaining lines were deliberately blanked in the original NTSC specification to provide time for the electron beam in CRT screens to return to the top of the display.

VIR (or Vertical interval reference), widely adopted in the 1980s, attempts to correct some of the color problems with NTSC video by adding studio-inserted reference data for luminance and chrominance levels on line 19. Suitably equipped television sets could then employ these data in order to adjust the display to a closer match of the original studio image. The actual VIR signal contains three sections, the first having 70 percent luminance and the same chrominance as the color burst signal, and the other two having 50 percent and 7.5 percent luminance respectively.

A less-used successor to VIR, GCR, also added ghost (multipath interference) removal capabilities.

The remaining vertical blanking interval lines are typically used for datacasting or ancillary data such as video editing timestamps (vertical interval timecodes or SMPTE timecodes on lines 12–14), test data on lines 17–18, a network source code on line 20 and closed captioning, XDS, and V-chip data on line 21. Early teletext applications also used vertical blanking interval lines 14–18 and 20, but teletext over NTSC was never widely adopted by viewers.

Many stations transmit TV Guide On Screen (TVGOS) data for an electronic program guide on VBI lines. The primary station in a market will broadcast 4 lines of data, and backup stations will broadcast 1 line. In most markets the PBS station is the primary host. TVGOS data can occupy any line from 10–25, but in practice its limited to 11–18, 20 and line 22. Line 22 is only used for 2 broadcast, DirecTV and CFPL-TV.

TiVo data is also transmitted on some commercials and program advertisements so that customers can autorecord the program being advertised, and is also used in weekly half-hour paid programs on Ion Television and the Discovery Channel which highlight TiVo promotions and advertisers.

== Countries and territories that are using or once used NTSC ==

Below are countries and territories that currently use or once used the NTSC system. Many of these have switched or are currently switching from NTSC to digital television standards such as ATSC (United States, Canada, Mexico, Suriname, Jamaica, South Korea, Saint Lucia, Bahamas, Barbados, Grenada, Antigua and Barbuda, Haiti), ISDB (Japan, Philippines, part of South America and Saint Kitts and Nevis), DVB-T (Taiwan, Panama, Colombia, Myanmar, and Trinidad and Tobago) or DTMB (Cuba).

* 
* 
* 

=== Experimented ===
* (between 1962 and 1963, Rede Tupi and Rede Excelsior made the first unofficial transmissions in color — in specific programs in the city of São Paulo, before the official adoption of PAL-M by the Brazilian Government on February 19, 1972)
* (experimented on 405-line variant of NTSC, later chose 625-line for PAL broadcasting)

=== Countries and territories that have ceased using NTSC ===
The following countries and regions no longer use NTSC for terrestrial broadcasts.

<text>A number is a mathematical object used to count, measure, and label. The most basic examples are the natural numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and so forth. Numbers can be represented in language with number words. More universally, individual numbers can be represented by symbols, called &quot;numerals&quot;; for example, &quot;5&quot; is a numeral that represents the number five. As only a relatively small number of symbols can be memorized, basic numerals are commonly organized in a numeral system, which is an organized way to represent any number. The most common numeral system is the Hindu–Arabic numeral system, which allows for the representation of any non-negative integer using a combination of ten fundamental numeric symbols, called digits. In addition to their use in counting and measuring, numerals are often used for labels (as with telephone numbers), for ordering (as with serial numbers), and for codes (as with ISBNs). In common usage, a &quot;numeral&quot; is not clearly distinguished from the &quot;number&quot; that it represents.

In mathematics, the notion of number has been extended over the centuries to include zero (0), negative numbers, rational numbers such as one half formula_1, real numbers such as the square root of 2 formula_2 and , and complex numbers which extend the real numbers with a square root of (and its combinations with real numbers by adding or subtracting its multiples). Calculations with numbers are done with arithmetical operations, the most familiar being addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. Their study or usage is called arithmetic, a term which may also refer to number theory, the study of the properties of numbers.

Besides their practical uses, numbers have cultural significance throughout the world. For example, in Western society, the number 13 is often regarded as unlucky, and &quot;a million&quot; may signify &quot;a lot&quot; rather than an exact quantity. Though it is now regarded as pseudoscience, belief in a mystical significance of numbers, known as numerology, permeated ancient and medieval thought. Numerology heavily influenced the development of Greek mathematics, stimulating the investigation of many problems in number theory which are still of interest today.

During the 19th century, mathematicians began to develop many different abstractions which share certain properties of numbers, and may be seen as extending the concept. Among the first were the hypercomplex numbers, which consist of various extensions or modifications of the complex number system. In modern mathematics, number systems are considered important special examples of more general algebraic structures such as rings and fields, and the application of the term &quot;number&quot; is a matter of convention, without fundamental significance.

==History==

===First use of numbers===

Bones and other artifacts have been discovered with marks cut into them that many believe are tally marks. These tally marks may have been used for counting elapsed time, such as numbers of days, lunar cycles or keeping records of quantities, such as of animals.

A tallying system has no concept of place value (as in modern decimal notation), which limits its representation of large numbers. Nonetheless, tallying systems are considered the first kind of abstract numeral system.

The first known system with place value was the Mesopotamian base 60 system ( BC) and the earliest known base 10 system dates to 3100 BC in Egypt.

===Numerals===

Numbers should be distinguished from numerals, the symbols used to represent numbers. The Egyptians invented the first ciphered numeral system, and the Greeks followed by mapping their counting numbers onto Ionian and Doric alphabets. Roman numerals, a system that used combinations of letters from the Roman alphabet, remained dominant in Europe until the spread of the superior Hindu–Arabic numeral system around the late 14th century, and the Hindu–Arabic numeral system remains the most common system for representing numbers in the world today. The key to the effectiveness of the system was the symbol for zero, which was developed by ancient Indian mathematicians around 500 AD.

===Zero===

The first known recorded use of zero dates to AD 628, and appeared in the &quot;Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta&quot;, the main work of the Indian mathematician Brahmagupta. He treated 0 as a number and discussed operations involving it, including division by zero. By this time (the 7th century), the concept had clearly reached Cambodia in the form of Khmer numerals, and documentation shows the idea later spreading to China and the Islamic world.

Brahmagupta&#x27;s &quot;Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta&quot; is the first book that mentions zero as a number, hence Brahmagupta is usually considered the first to formulate the concept of zero. He gave rules of using zero with negative and positive numbers, such as &quot;zero plus a positive number is a positive number, and a negative number plus zero is the negative number&quot;. The &quot;Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta&quot; is the earliest known text to treat zero as a number in its own right, rather than as simply a placeholder digit in representing another number as was done by the Babylonians or as a symbol for a lack of quantity as was done by Ptolemy and the Romans.

The use of 0 as a number should be distinguished from its use as a placeholder numeral in place-value systems. Many ancient texts used 0. Babylonian and Egyptian texts used it. Egyptians used the word &quot;nfr&quot; to denote zero balance in double entry accounting. Indian texts used a Sanskrit word or to refer to the concept of &quot;void&quot;. In mathematics texts this word often refers to the number zero. In a similar vein, Pāṇini (5th century BC) used the null (zero) operator in the &quot;Ashtadhyayi&quot;, an early example of an algebraic grammar for the Sanskrit language (also see Pingala).

There are other uses of zero before Brahmagupta, though the documentation is not as complete as it is in the &quot;Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta&quot;.

Records show that the Ancient Greeks seemed unsure about the status of 0 as a number: they asked themselves &quot;How can &#x27;nothing&#x27; be something?&quot; leading to interesting philosophical and, by the Medieval period, religious arguments about the nature and existence of 0 and the vacuum. The paradoxes of Zeno of Elea depend in part on the uncertain interpretation of 0. (The ancient Greeks even questioned whether  was a number.)

The late Olmec people of south-central Mexico began to use a symbol for zero, a shell glyph, in the New World, possibly by the but certainly by 40 BC, which became an integral part of Maya numerals and the Maya calendar. Maya arithmetic used base 4 and base 5 written as base 20. George I. Sánchez in 1961 reported a base 4, base 5 &quot;finger&quot; abacus.

By 130 AD, Ptolemy, influenced by Hipparchus and the Babylonians, was using a symbol for 0 (a small circle with a long overbar) within a sexagesimal numeral system otherwise using alphabetic Greek numerals. Because it was used alone, not as just a placeholder, this Hellenistic zero was the first &quot;documented&quot; use of a true zero in the Old World. In later Byzantine manuscripts of his &quot;Syntaxis Mathematica&quot; (&quot;Almagest&quot;), the Hellenistic zero had morphed into the Greek letter Omicron (otherwise meaning 70).

Another true zero was used in tables alongside Roman numerals by 525 (first known use by Dionysius Exiguus), but as a word, meaning &quot;nothing&quot;, not as a symbol. When division produced 0 as a remainder, , also meaning &quot;nothing&quot;, was used. These medieval zeros were used by all future medieval computists (calculators of Easter). An isolated use of their initial, N, was used in a table of Roman numerals by Bede or a colleague about 725, a true zero symbol.

===Negative numbers ===

The abstract concept of negative numbers was recognized as early as 100–50 BC in China. &quot;The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art&quot; contains methods for finding the areas of figures; red rods were used to denote positive coefficients, black for negative. The first reference in a Western work was in the 3rd century AD in Greece. Diophantus referred to the equation equivalent to (the solution is negative) in &quot;Arithmetica&quot;, saying that the equation gave an absurd result.

During the 600s, negative numbers were in use in India to represent debts. Diophantus&#x27; previous reference was discussed more explicitly by Indian mathematician Brahmagupta, in &quot;Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta&quot; in 628, who used negative numbers to produce the general form quadratic formula that remains in use today. However, in the 12th century in India, Bhaskara gives negative roots for quadratic equations but says the negative value &quot;is in this case not to be taken, for it is inadequate; people do not approve of negative roots&quot;.

European mathematicians, for the most part, resisted the concept of negative numbers until the 17th century, although Fibonacci allowed negative solutions in financial problems where they could be interpreted as debts (chapter 13 of , 1202) and later as losses (in ). René Descartes called them false roots as they cropped up in algebraic polynomials yet he found a way to swap true roots and false roots as well. At the same time, the Chinese were indicating negative numbers by drawing a diagonal stroke through the right-most non-zero digit of the corresponding positive number&#x27;s numeral. The first use of negative numbers in a European work was by Nicolas Chuquet during the 15th century. He used them as exponents, but referred to them as &quot;absurd numbers&quot;.

As recently as the 18th century, it was common practice to ignore any negative results returned by equations on the assumption that they were meaningless.

===Rational numbers ===
It is likely that the concept of fractional numbers dates to prehistoric times. The Ancient Egyptians used their Egyptian fraction notation for rational numbers in mathematical texts such as the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus and the Kahun Papyrus. Classical Greek and Indian mathematicians made studies of the theory of rational numbers, as part of the general study of number theory. The best known of these is Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;, dating to roughly 300 BC. Of the Indian texts, the most relevant is the Sthananga Sutra, which also covers number theory as part of a general study of mathematics.

The concept of decimal fractions is closely linked with decimal place-value notation; the two seem to have developed in tandem. For example, it is common for the Jain math sutra to include calculations of decimal-fraction approximations to pi or the square root of 2. Similarly, Babylonian math texts used sexagesimal (base 60) fractions with great frequency.

===Irrational numbers ===

The earliest known use of irrational numbers was in the Indian Sulba Sutras composed between 800 and 500 BC. The first existence proofs of irrational numbers is usually attributed to Pythagoras, more specifically to the Pythagorean Hippasus of Metapontum, who produced a (most likely geometrical) proof of the irrationality of the square root of 2. The story goes that Hippasus discovered irrational numbers when trying to represent the square root of 2 as a fraction. However, Pythagoras believed in the absoluteness of numbers, and could not accept the existence of irrational numbers. He could not disprove their existence through logic, but he could not accept irrational numbers, and so, allegedly and frequently reported, he sentenced Hippasus to death by drowning, to impede spreading of this disconcerting news.

The 16th century brought final European acceptance of negative integral and fractional numbers. By the 17th century, mathematicians generally used decimal fractions with modern notation. It was not, however, until the 19th century that mathematicians separated irrationals into algebraic and transcendental parts, and once more undertook the scientific study of irrationals. It had remained almost dormant since Euclid. In 1872, the publication of the theories of Karl Weierstrass (by his pupil E. Kossak), Eduard Heine, Georg Cantor, and Richard Dedekind was brought about. In 1869, Charles Méray had taken the same point of departure as Heine, but the theory is generally referred to the year 1872. Weierstrass&#x27;s method was completely set forth by Salvatore Pincherle (1880), and Dedekind&#x27;s has received additional prominence through the author&#x27;s later work (1888) and endorsement by Paul Tannery (1894). Weierstrass, Cantor, and Heine base their theories on infinite series, while Dedekind founds his on the idea of a cut (Schnitt) in the system of real numbers, separating all rational numbers into two groups having certain characteristic properties. The subject has received later contributions at the hands of Weierstrass, Kronecker, and Méray.

The search for roots of quintic and higher degree equations was an important development, the Abel–Ruffini theorem (Ruffini 1799, Abel 1824) showed that they could not be solved by radicals (formulas involving only arithmetical operations and roots). Hence it was necessary to consider the wider set of algebraic numbers (all solutions to polynomial equations). Galois (1832) linked polynomial equations to group theory giving rise to the field of Galois theory.

Simple continued fractions, closely related to irrational numbers (and due to Cataldi, 1613), received attention at the hands of Euler, and at the opening of the 19th century were brought into prominence through the writings of Joseph Louis Lagrange. Other noteworthy contributions have been made by Druckenmüller (1837), Kunze (1857), Lemke (1870), and Günther (1872). Ramus first connected the subject with determinants, resulting, with the subsequent contributions of Heine, Möbius, and Günther, in the theory of .

===Transcendental numbers and reals ===
The existence of transcendental numbers was first established by Liouville (1844, 1851). Hermite proved in 1873 that &quot;e&quot; is transcendental and Lindemann proved in 1882 that π is transcendental. Finally, Cantor showed that the set of all real numbers is uncountably infinite but the set of all algebraic numbers is countably infinite, so there is an uncountably infinite number of transcendental numbers.

===Infinity and infinitesimals ===

The earliest known conception of mathematical infinity appears in the Yajur Veda, an ancient Indian script, which at one point states, &quot;If you remove a part from infinity or add a part to infinity, still what remains is infinity.&quot; Infinity was a popular topic of philosophical study among the Jain mathematicians c. 400 BC. They distinguished between five types of infinity: infinite in one and two directions, infinite in area, infinite everywhere, and infinite perpetually. The symbol formula_3 is often used to represent an infinite quantity.

Aristotle defined the traditional Western notion of mathematical infinity. He distinguished between actual infinity and potential infinity—the general consensus being that only the latter had true value. Galileo Galilei&#x27;s &quot;Two New Sciences&quot; discussed the idea of one-to-one correspondences between infinite sets. But the next major advance in the theory was made by Georg Cantor; in 1895 he published a book about his new set theory, introducing, among other things, transfinite numbers and formulating the continuum hypothesis.

In the 1960s, Abraham Robinson showed how infinitely large and infinitesimal numbers can be rigorously defined and used to develop the field of nonstandard analysis. The system of hyperreal numbers represents a rigorous method of treating the ideas about infinite and infinitesimal numbers that had been used casually by mathematicians, scientists, and engineers ever since the invention of infinitesimal calculus by Newton and Leibniz.

A modern geometrical version of infinity is given by projective geometry, which introduces &quot;ideal points at infinity&quot;, one for each spatial direction. Each family of parallel lines in a given direction is postulated to converge to the corresponding ideal point. This is closely related to the idea of vanishing points in perspective drawing.

===Complex numbers ===

The earliest fleeting reference to square roots of negative numbers occurred in the work of the mathematician and inventor Heron of Alexandria in the , when he considered the volume of an impossible frustum of a pyramid. They became more prominent when in the 16th century closed formulas for the roots of third and fourth degree polynomials were discovered by Italian mathematicians such as Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia and Gerolamo Cardano. It was soon realized that these formulas, even if one was only interested in real solutions, sometimes required the manipulation of square roots of negative numbers.

This was doubly unsettling since they did not even consider negative numbers to be on firm ground at the time. When René Descartes coined the term &quot;imaginary&quot; for these quantities in 1637, he intended it as derogatory. (See imaginary number for a discussion of the &quot;reality&quot; of complex numbers.) A further source of confusion was that the equation
:formula_4
seemed capriciously inconsistent with the algebraic identity
:formula_5
which is valid for positive real numbers &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, and was also used in complex number calculations with one of &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; positive and the other negative. The incorrect use of this identity, and the related identity
:formula_6
in the case when both &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are negative even bedeviled Euler. This difficulty eventually led him to the convention of using the special symbol &quot;i&quot; in place of formula_7 to guard against this mistake.

The 18th century saw the work of Abraham de Moivre and Leonhard Euler. De Moivre&#x27;s formula (1730) states:
:formula_8
while Euler&#x27;s formula of complex analysis (1748) gave us:
:formula_9

The existence of complex numbers was not completely accepted until Caspar Wessel described the geometrical interpretation in 1799. Carl Friedrich Gauss rediscovered and popularized it several years later, and as a result the theory of complex numbers received a notable expansion. The idea of the graphic representation of complex numbers had appeared, however, as early as 1685, in Wallis&#x27;s &quot;De algebra tractatus&quot;.

In the same year, Gauss provided the first generally accepted proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra, showing that every polynomial over the complex numbers has a full set of solutions in that realm. Gauss studied complex numbers of the form , where &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are integers (now called Gaussian integers) or rational numbers. His student, Gotthold Eisenstein, studied the type , where &quot;ω&quot; is a complex root of (now called Eisenstein integers). Other such classes (called cyclotomic fields) of complex numbers derive from the roots of unity for higher values of &quot;k&quot;. This generalization is largely due to Ernst Kummer, who also invented ideal numbers, which were expressed as geometrical entities by Felix Klein in 1893.

In 1850 Victor Alexandre Puiseux took the key step of distinguishing between poles and branch points, and introduced the concept of essential singular points. This eventually led to the concept of the extended complex plane.

===Prime numbers ===
Prime numbers have been studied throughout recorded history. They are positive integers that are divisible only by 1 and themselves. Euclid devoted one book of the &quot;Elements&quot; to the theory of primes; in it he proved the infinitude of the primes and the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, and presented the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers.

In 240 BC, Eratosthenes used the Sieve of Eratosthenes to quickly isolate prime numbers. But most further development of the theory of primes in Europe dates to the Renaissance and later eras.

In 1796, Adrien-Marie Legendre conjectured the prime number theorem, describing the asymptotic distribution of primes. Other results concerning the distribution of the primes include Euler&#x27;s proof that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges, and the Goldbach conjecture, which claims that any sufficiently large even number is the sum of two primes. Yet another conjecture related to the distribution of prime numbers is the Riemann hypothesis, formulated by Bernhard Riemann in 1859. The prime number theorem was finally proved by Jacques Hadamard and Charles de la Vallée-Poussin in 1896. Goldbach and Riemann&#x27;s conjectures remain unproven and unrefuted.

==Main classification==
Numbers can be classified into sets, called number sets or number systems, such as the natural numbers and the real numbers. The main number systems are as follows:
Each of these number systems is a subset of the next one. So, for example, a rational number is also a real number, and every real number is also a complex number. This can be expressed symbolically as
:formula_10.

A more complete list of number sets appears in the following diagram.
===Natural numbers===
The most familiar numbers are the natural numbers (sometimes called whole numbers or counting numbers): 1, 2, 3, and so on. Traditionally, the sequence of natural numbers started with 1 (0 was not even considered a number for the Ancient Greeks.) However, in the 19th century, set theorists and other mathematicians started including 0 (cardinality of the empty set, i.e. 0 elements, where 0 is thus the smallest cardinal number) in the set of natural numbers. Today, different mathematicians use the term to describe both sets, including 0 or not. The mathematical symbol for the set of all natural numbers is N, also written formula_11, and sometimes formula_12 or formula_13 when it is necessary to indicate whether the set should start with 0 or 1, respectively.

In the base 10 numeral system, in almost universal use today for mathematical operations, the symbols for natural numbers are written using ten digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. The radix or base is the number of unique numerical digits, including zero, that a numeral system uses to represent numbers (for the decimal system, the radix is 10). In this base 10 system, the rightmost digit of a natural number has a place value of 1, and every other digit has a place value ten times that of the place value of the digit to its right.

In set theory, which is capable of acting as an axiomatic foundation for modern mathematics, natural numbers can be represented by classes of equivalent sets. For instance, the number 3 can be represented as the class of all sets that have exactly three elements. Alternatively, in Peano Arithmetic, the number 3 is represented as sss0, where s is the &quot;successor&quot; function (i.e., 3 is the third successor of 0). Many different representations are possible; all that is needed to formally represent 3 is to inscribe a certain symbol or pattern of symbols three times.

===Integers===

The negative of a positive integer is defined as a number that produces 0 when it is added to the corresponding positive integer. Negative numbers are usually written with a negative sign (a minus sign). As an example, the negative of 7 is written −7, and . When the set of negative numbers is combined with the set of natural numbers (including 0), the result is defined as the set of integers, Z also written formula_14. Here the letter Z comes . The set of integers forms a ring with the operations addition and multiplication.

The natural numbers form a subset of the integers. As there is no common standard for the inclusion or not of zero in the natural numbers, the natural numbers without zero are commonly referred to as positive integers, and the natural numbers with zero are referred to as non-negative integers.

===Rational numbers===

A rational number is a number that can be expressed as a fraction with an integer numerator and a positive integer denominator. Negative denominators are allowed, but are commonly avoided, as every rational number is equal to a fraction with positive denominator. Fractions are written as two integers, the numerator and the denominator, with a dividing bar between them. The fraction represents &quot;m&quot; parts of a whole divided into &quot;n&quot; equal parts. Two different fractions may correspond to the same rational number; for example and are equal, that is:
:formula_15

In general,
:formula_16 if and only if formula_17

If the absolute value of &quot;m&quot; is greater than &quot;n&quot; (supposed to be positive), then the absolute value of the fraction is greater than 1. Fractions can be greater than, less than, or equal to 1 and can also be positive, negative, or 0. The set of all rational numbers includes the integers since every integer can be written as a fraction with denominator 1. For example −7 can be written . The symbol for the rational numbers is Q (for &quot;quotient&quot;), also written formula_18.

===Real numbers===
The symbol for the real numbers is R, also written as formula_19 They include all the measuring numbers. Every real number corresponds to a point on the number line. The following paragraph will focus primarily on positive real numbers. The treatment of negative real numbers is according to the general rules of arithmetic and their denotation is simply prefixing the corresponding positive numeral by a minus sign, e.g. −123.456.

Most real numbers can only be &quot;approximated&quot; by decimal numerals, in which a decimal point is placed to the right of the digit with place value 1. Each digit to the right of the decimal point has a place value one-tenth of the place value of the digit to its left. For example, 123.456 represents , or, in words, one hundred, two tens, three ones, four tenths, five hundredths, and six thousandths. A real number can be expressed by a finite number of decimal digits only if it is rational and its fractional part has a denominator whose prime factors are 2 or 5 or both, because these are the prime factors of 10, the base of the decimal system. Thus, for example, one half is 0.5, one fifth is 0.2, one-tenth is 0.1, and one fiftieth is 0.02. Representing other real numbers as decimals would require an infinite sequence of digits to the right of the decimal point. If this infinite sequence of digits follows a pattern, it can be written with an ellipsis or another notation that indicates the repeating pattern. Such a decimal is called a repeating decimal. Thus can be written as 0.333..., with an ellipsis to indicate that the pattern continues. Forever repeating 3s are also written as 0..

It turns out that these repeating decimals (including the repetition of zeroes) denote exactly the rational numbers, i.e., all rational numbers are also real numbers, but it is not the case that every real number is rational. A real number that is not rational is called irrational. A famous irrational real number is the , the ratio of the circumference of any circle to its diameter. When pi is written as
:formula_20
as it sometimes is, the ellipsis does not mean that the decimals repeat (they do not), but rather that there is no end to them. It has been proved that is irrational. Another well-known number, proven to be an irrational real number, is
:formula_21
the square root of 2, that is, the unique positive real number whose square is 2. Both these numbers have been approximated (by computer) to trillions of digits.

Not only these prominent examples but almost all real numbers are irrational and therefore have no repeating patterns and hence no corresponding decimal numeral. They can only be approximated by decimal numerals, denoting rounded or truncated real numbers. Any rounded or truncated number is necessarily a rational number, of which there are only countably many. All measurements are, by their nature, approximations, and always have a margin of error. Thus 123.456 is considered an approximation of any real number greater or equal to and strictly less than (rounding to 3 decimals), or of any real number greater or equal to and strictly less than (truncation after the 3. decimal). Digits that suggest a greater accuracy than the measurement itself does, should be removed. The remaining digits are then called significant digits. For example, measurements with a ruler can seldom be made without a margin of error of at least 0.001 m. If the sides of a rectangle are measured as 1.23 m and 4.56 m, then multiplication gives an area for the rectangle between and . Since not even the second digit after the decimal place is preserved, the following digits are not &quot;significant&quot;. Therefore, the result is usually rounded to 5.61.

Just as the same fraction can be written in more than one way, the same real number may have more than one decimal representation. For example, 0.999..., 1.0, 1.00, 1.000, ..., all represent the natural number 1. A given real number has only the following decimal representations: an approximation to some finite number of decimal places, an approximation in which a pattern is established that continues for an unlimited number of decimal places or an exact value with only finitely many decimal places. In this last case, the last non-zero digit may be replaced by the digit one smaller followed by an unlimited number of 9s, or the last non-zero digit may be followed by an unlimited number of zeros. Thus the exact real number 3.74 can also be written 3.7399999999... and 3.74000000000... Similarly, a decimal numeral with an unlimited number of 0s can be rewritten by dropping the 0s to the right of the rightmost nonzero digit, and a decimal numeral with an unlimited number of 9s can be rewritten by increasing by one the rightmost digit less than 9, and changing all the 9s to the right of that digit to 0s. Finally, an unlimited sequence of 0s to the right of a decimal place can be dropped. For example, 6.849999999999... = 6.85 and 6.850000000000... = 6.85. Finally, if all of the digits in a numeral are 0, the number is 0, and if all of the digits in a numeral are an unending string of 9s, you can drop the nines to the right of the decimal place, and add one to the string of 9s to the left of the decimal place. For example, 99.999... = 100.

The real numbers also have an important but highly technical property called the least upper bound property.

It can be shown that any ordered field, which is also complete, is isomorphic to the real numbers. The real numbers are not, however, an algebraically closed field, because they do not include a solution (often called a square root of minus one) to the algebraic equation formula_22.

===Complex numbers===

Moving to a greater level of abstraction, the real numbers can be extended to the complex numbers. This set of numbers arose historically from trying to find closed formulas for the roots of cubic and quadratic polynomials. This led to expressions involving the square roots of negative numbers, and eventually to the definition of a new number: a square root of −1, denoted by &quot;i&quot;, a symbol assigned by Leonhard Euler, and called the imaginary unit. The complex numbers consist of all numbers of the form
:formula_23
where &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are real numbers. Because of this, complex numbers correspond to points on the complex plane, a vector space of two real dimensions. In the expression , the real number &quot;a&quot; is called the real part and &quot;b&quot; is called the imaginary part. If the real part of a complex number is 0, then the number is called an imaginary number or is referred to as &quot;purely imaginary&quot;; if the imaginary part is 0, then the number is a real number. Thus the real numbers are a subset of the complex numbers. If the real and imaginary parts of a complex number are both integers, then the number is called a Gaussian integer. The symbol for the complex numbers is C or formula_24.

The fundamental theorem of algebra asserts that the complex numbers form an algebraically closed field, meaning that every polynomial with complex coefficients has a root in the complex numbers. Like the reals, the complex numbers form a field, which is complete, but unlike the real numbers, it is not ordered. That is, there is no consistent meaning assignable to saying that &quot;i&quot; is greater than 1, nor is there any meaning in saying that &quot;i&quot; is less than 1. In technical terms, the complex numbers lack a total order that is compatible with field operations.

==Subclasses of the integers==

===Even and odd numbers===

An even number is an integer that is &quot;evenly divisible&quot; by two, that is divisible by two without remainder; an odd number is an integer that is not even. (The old-fashioned term &quot;evenly divisible&quot; is now almost always shortened to &quot;divisible&quot;.) Any odd number &quot;n&quot; may be constructed by the formula for a suitable integer &quot;k&quot;. Starting with the first non-negative odd numbers are {1, 3, 5, 7, ...}. Any even number &quot;m&quot; has the form where &quot;k&quot; is again an integer. Similarly, the first non-negative even numbers are {0, 2, 4, 6, ...}.

===Prime numbers===

A prime number, often shortened to just prime, is an integer greater than 1 that is not the product of two smaller positive integers. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11. There is no such simple formula as for odd and even numbers to generate the prime numbers. The primes have been widely studied for more than 2000 years and have led to many questions, only some of which have been answered. The study of these questions belongs to number theory. Goldbach&#x27;s conjecture is an example of a still unanswered question: &quot;Is every even number the sum of two primes?&quot;

One answered question, as to whether every integer greater than one is a product of primes in only one way, except for a rearrangement of the primes, was confirmed; this proven claim is called the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. A proof appears in Euclid&#x27;s Elements.

===Other classes of integers===
Many subsets of the natural numbers have been the subject of specific studies and have been named, often after the first mathematician that has studied them. Example of such sets of integers are Fibonacci numbers and perfect numbers. For more examples, see Integer sequence.

==Subclasses of the complex numbers==

===Algebraic, irrational and transcendental numbers===
Algebraic numbers are those that are a solution to a polynomial equation with integer coefficients. Real numbers that are not rational numbers are called irrational numbers. Complex numbers which are not algebraic are called transcendental numbers. The algebraic numbers that are solutions of a monic polynomial equation with integer coefficients are called algebraic integers.

===Periods and exponential periods===

A period is a complex number that can be expressed as an integral of an algebraic function over an algebraic domain. The periods are a class of numbers which includes, alongside the algebraic numbers, many well known mathematical constants such as the number &quot;π&quot;. The set of periods form a countable ring and bridge the gap between algebraic and transcendental numbers. 

The periods can be extended by permitting the integrand to be the product of an algebraic function and the exponential of an algebraic function. This gives another countable ring: the exponential periods. The number &quot;e&quot; as well as Euler&#x27;s constant are exponential periods. 

===Constructible numbers===
Motivated by the classical problems of constructions with straightedge and compass, the constructible numbers are those complex numbers whose real and imaginary parts can be constructed using straightedge and compass, starting from a given segment of unit length, in a finite number of steps.

===Computable numbers===

A computable number, also known as &quot;recursive number&quot;, is a real number such that there exists an algorithm which, given a positive number &quot;n&quot; as input, produces the first &quot;n&quot; digits of the computable number&#x27;s decimal representation. Equivalent definitions can be given using μ-recursive functions, Turing machines or λ-calculus. The computable numbers are stable for all usual arithmetic operations, including the computation of the roots of a polynomial, and thus form a real closed field that contains the real algebraic numbers.

The computable numbers may be viewed as the real numbers that may be exactly represented in a computer: a computable number is exactly represented by its first digits and a program for computing further digits. However, the computable numbers are rarely used in practice. One reason is that there is no algorithm for testing the equality of two computable numbers. More precisely, there cannot exist any algorithm which takes any computable number as an input, and decides in every case if this number is equal to zero or not.

The set of computable numbers has the same cardinality as the natural numbers. Therefore, almost all real numbers are non-computable. However, it is very difficult to produce explicitly a real number that is not computable.

==Extensions of the concept==

===&quot;p&quot;-adic numbers===

The &quot;p&quot;-adic numbers may have infinitely long expansions to the left of the decimal point, in the same way that real numbers may have infinitely long expansions to the right. The number system that results depends on what base is used for the digits: any base is possible, but a prime number base provides the best mathematical properties. The set of the &quot;p&quot;-adic numbers contains the rational numbers, but is not contained in the complex numbers.

The elements of an algebraic function field over a finite field and algebraic numbers have many similar properties (see Function field analogy). Therefore, they are often regarded as numbers by number theorists. The &quot;p&quot;-adic numbers play an important role in this analogy.

===Hypercomplex numbers===

Some number systems that are not included in the complex numbers may be constructed from the real numbers formula_25 in a way that generalize the construction of the complex numbers. They are sometimes called hypercomplex numbers. They include the quaternions formula_26, introduced by Sir William Rowan Hamilton, in which multiplication is not commutative, the octonions formula_27, in which multiplication is not associative in addition to not being commutative, and the sedenions formula_28, in which multiplication is not alternative, neither associative nor commutative. The hypercomplex numbers include one real unit together with formula_29 imaginary units, for which &quot;n&quot; is a non-negative integer. For example, quaternions can generally represented using the form

formula_30

where the coefficients , , , are real numbers, and , are 3 different imaginary units.

Each hypercomplex number system is a subset of the next hypercomplex number system of double dimensions obtained via the Cayley–Dickson construction. For example, the 4-dimensional quaternions formula_26 are a subset of the 8-dimensional quaternions formula_27, which are in turn a subset of the 16-dimensional sedenions formula_28, in turn a subset of the 32-dimensional trigintaduonions formula_34, and &quot;ad infinitum&quot; with formula_35 dimensions, with &quot;n&quot; being any non-negative integer. Including the complex and real numbers and their subsets, this can be expressed symbolically as:
:formula_36

Alternatively, starting from the real numbers formula_25, which have zero complex units, this can be expressed as

:formula_38

with formula_39 containing formula_35 dimensions.

===Transfinite numbers===

For dealing with infinite sets, the natural numbers have been generalized to the ordinal numbers and to the cardinal numbers. The former gives the ordering of the set, while the latter gives its size. For finite sets, both ordinal and cardinal numbers are identified with the natural numbers. In the infinite case, many ordinal numbers correspond to the same cardinal number.

===Nonstandard numbers===
Hyperreal numbers are used in non-standard analysis. The hyperreals, or nonstandard reals (usually denoted as *R), denote an ordered field that is a proper extension of the ordered field of real numbers R and satisfies the transfer principle. This principle allows true first-order statements about R to be reinterpreted as true first-order statements about *R.

Superreal and surreal numbers extend the real numbers by adding infinitesimally small numbers and infinitely large numbers, but still form fields.

<text>Nightclub two step (NC2S, sometimes disco two step or California two step) is a partner dance initially developed by Buddy Schwimmer in the mid-1960s. The dance is also known as &quot;Two Step&quot; and was &quot;one of the most popular forms of contemporary social dance&quot; as a Disco Couples Dance in 1978. It is frequently danced to mid-tempo ballads in time that have a characteristic quick-quick-slow beat. A classic example is the song &quot;The Lady In Red&quot;.

==Description==
The nightclub two step basic step can be counted as one &amp; two - three &amp; four -.

The dance position for nightclub two step is with a more relaxed hold, or &quot;what people tend to do without lessons&quot;. The lead rocks back on their left foot, the follow on their right, for one beat. &quot;The toe is to the heel, but not further. Don&#x27;t twist your hip. If your hip opens up, you have gone too far.&quot;
 A gentle but noticeable resistance is maintained during the rock step. Then both partners replace weight on the second part of the first beat. On the next beat, the lead takes a step to the left and the follow to the right. Then both partners repeat, but on opposite feet (the lead rocks back on their right foot and moves to the right).

The quick rock steps should be matched with the quick drum beats in the music. The &quot;slow&quot; drum beat and slow step can occur on either the second and fourth, or the first and third beats of a measure. Although other rhythmic interpretations of the music are possible, including the use of &quot;breaks&quot; in the music, they are beyond the scope of this article.

Another pattern in NC2S is the side-cross-side move. Typically, the lead starts this move by stepping side with their left foot and then crosses in front with their right foot. This is followed by another step to the side with the left foot. The rhythm, here, is quick, quick, slow. The follow does the same thing, but starts with their right foot. Both partners cross in front. In an interview with Phil Seyer Buddy said he created this move by modifying something that was popular in the 60&#x27;s called the &quot;Surfer Stomp.&quot; The surfer stomp was simply, &quot;side, together, side, touch.&quot; In the DVIDA Nightclub Two-Step syllabus, this action is called a Traveling Cross.

UCWDC lists a narrow range of 54-64 beats per minute for the dance.

<text>No wave was an avant-garde music genre and visual art scene that emerged in the late 1970s in Downtown New York City. The term was a pun based on the rejection of commercial new wave music. Reacting against punk rock&#x27;s recycling of rock and roll clichés, no wave musicians instead experimented with noise, dissonance, and atonality, as well as non-rock genres like free jazz, funk, and disco. The scene often reflected an abrasive, confrontational, and nihilistic world view.

The movement was short-lived but highly influential in the music world. The 1978 compilation &quot;No New York&quot; is often considered the quintessential testament to the scene&#x27;s musical aesthetic. Aside from the music genre, the no wave movement also had a significant influence in independent film (no wave cinema), fashion, and visual art.

==Overview/characteristics==
No wave is not a clearly definable musical genre with consistent features, but it generally was characterized by a rejection of the recycling of traditional rock aesthetics, such as blues rock styles and Chuck Berry guitar riffs in punk and new wave music. No wave groups drew on and explored such disparate stylistic forms as minimalism, conceptual art, funk, jazz, blues, punk rock, and avant garde noise music. According to &quot;Village Voice&quot; writer Steve Anderson, the scene pursued an abrasive reductionism which &quot;undermined the power and mystique of a rock vanguard by depriving it of a tradition to react against&quot;. Anderson claimed that the no wave scene represented &quot;New York&#x27;s last stylistically cohesive avant-rock movement&quot;.

There were, however, some elements common to most no-wave music, such as abrasive atonal sounds; repetitive, driving rhythms; and a tendency to emphasize musical texture over melody—typical of La Monte Young&#x27;s early downtown music. In the early 1980s, Downtown Manhattan&#x27;s no wave scene transitioned from its abrasive origins into a more dance-oriented sound, with compilations such as ZE Records&#x27;s &quot;Mutant Disco&quot; (1981) highlighting a playful sensibility borne out of the city&#x27;s clash of hip hop, disco and punk styles, as well as dub reggae and world music influences.

No wave music presented a negative and nihilistic world view that reflected the desolation of late 1970s Downtown New York and how they viewed the larger society. In a 2020 essay, Lydia Lunch stated there were many problems in the years that led into the 1970s, and that calling 1967 the Summer of Love was a bald-faced lie. The term &quot;no wave&quot; might have been inspired by the French New Wave pioneer Claude Chabrol, with his remark &quot;There are no waves, only the ocean&quot;.

==Etymology==
There are different theories about how the term was coined. Some suggest Lydia Lunch coined the term in an interview with Roy Trakin in &quot;New York Rocker&quot;. Others suggest it was coined by Chris Nelson (of Mofungo and The Scene Is Now) in &quot;New York Rocker&quot;. Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth claimed to have seen the term spray-painted on CBGB&#x27;s Second Avenue Theater at 66 Second Avenue before seeing it in the press.

==Early forerunners==

Nihilist Spasm Band were an early noise music/noise rock band from the 1960s. Their debut record No Record, released in 1968, has been described as being a &#x27;60s precursor to no wave, with its nihilistic world view and complete disregard for any sort of musical structure, as evinced by the freely improvised noise of songs such as &quot;Destroy The Nations&quot; and &quot;Dog Face Man&quot;. The band plastered the word &quot;NO&quot; on much of their equipment and handmade instruments, and recorded a film between 1965 and 1966 entitled &quot;NO Movie&quot;. Member Bill Exley would sometimes wear a monkey mask on stage to conceal his identity. They&#x27;ve been cited as an influence by Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth.

The Velvet Underground, a 1960s New York City band, are also seen as early contributors to the no wave movement. As described by &quot;Pitchfork&quot;&#x27;s Marc Masters: &quot;Mixing the noisy rock leanings of Lou Reed, the minimalist drones of John Cale (via his work with avant-garde pioneer LaMonte Young), and the art world influence of Andy Warhol&#x27;s Factory, this seminal band provided a comprehensive model for No Wave.&quot;

Captain Beefheart&#x27;s polarizing brand of avant-rock music has been cited as laying &quot;the groundwork for post-punk, new wave, and no wave, allowing the likes of Brian Eno and David Bowie to pick up from where Beefheart had left off&quot;.

Cromagnon were a 1960s New York City band whose sole album &quot;Orgasm&quot; was cited by AllMusic&#x27;s Alex Henderson as foreshadowing no-wave.

Suicide was a New York City duo that was formed in 1970 by Alan Vega and Martin Rev. They have been cited by Marc Masters as having &quot;the biggest influence on no-wave&quot;.

==The no-wave music scene==

In 1978, a punk subculture-influenced noise series was held at New York&#x27;s Artists Space. No wave musicians such as the Contortions, Teenage Jesus and the Jerks, Mars, DNA, Theoretical Girls and Rhys Chatham began experimenting with noise, dissonance and atonality in addition to non-rock styles. The former four groups were included on the compilation &quot;No New York&quot;, often considered the quintessential testament to the scene. The no wave-affiliated label ZE Records was founded in 1978, and would also produce acclaimed and influential compilations in subsequent years.

In 1978, Rhys Chatham curated a concert at The Kitchen with two electric guitar noise music bands that involved Glenn Branca (Theoretical Girls and Daily Life, performed by Branca, Barbara Ess, Paul McMahon, and Christine Hahn) and another two electric-guitar noise music bands that involved Chatham himself (The Gynecologists and Tone Death, performed by Robert Appleton, Nina Canal, Chatham, and Peter Gordon). Tone Death performed Chatham&#x27;s 1977 composition for electric guitars &quot;Guitar Trio&quot;, that was inspired by La Monte Young&#x27;s minimalist composition &quot;Trio for Strings&quot; and Chatham&#x27;s exposure to The Ramones at CBGB via Peter Gordon. This proto-No Wave concert was followed a few weeks later when Artists Space served as a site of concrete inception for the No Wave music movement, hosting a five night underground No Wave music festival, organized by artists Michael Zwack and Robert Longo, that featured ten local bands; including Rhys Chatham&#x27;s The Gynecologists, Glenn Branca&#x27;s Theoretical Girls, Rhys Chatham&#x27;s Tone Death, and Branca&#x27;s Daily Life. 

The final two days of the show featured DNA and the Contortions on Friday, followed by Mars and Teenage Jesus and the Jerks on Saturday. English musician and producer Brian Eno, who had originally come to New York to produce the second Talking Heads album &quot;More Songs About Buildings and Food&quot;, was in the audience. Impressed by what he saw and heard, and advised by Diego Cortez to do so, Eno was convinced that this movement should be documented and proposed the idea of a compilation album, &quot;No New York&quot;, with himself as a producer.

By the early 1980s, artists such as Liquid Liquid, the B-52&#x27;s, Cristina, Arthur Russell, James White and the Blacks and Lizzy Mercier Descloux developed a dance-oriented style described by Lucy Sante as &quot;anything at all + disco bottom&quot;. Other no-wave groups such as Swans, Suicide, Glenn Branca, the Lounge Lizards, Bush Tetras and Sonic Youth instead continued exploring the forays into noise music abrasive territory. For example, Noise Fest was an influential festival of no wave noise music performances curated by Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth at the New York City art space White Columns in June 1981. Sonic Youth made their first live appearances at this show. 

The Noise Fest inspired Speed Trials, the noise rock five-night concert series held May 4–8, 1983, that was organized by Live Skull members in May 1983, also at White Columns (then located at 91 Horatio Street). Among an art installation created by David Wojnarowicz and Joseph Nechvatal, Speed Trials included performances by the Fall, Sonic Youth, Lydia Lunch, Mofungo, Ilona Granet, pre-rap Beastie Boys, 3 Teens Kill 4, Elliott Sharp as Carbon, Swans, the Ordinaires, and Arto Lindsay as Toy Killers. On May 10, the San Francisco noise-punk band Flipper closed the series out with a live concert at Studio 54. This event also included performances by Zev and Eric Bogosian and a video presentation by Tony Oursler. Speed Trials was followed by the short-lived after-hours audio art Speed Club that was established by Nechvatal and Bradley Eros at ABC No Rio that summer.

==Other art media in the no wave scene==
===Cinema===

No Wave Cinema was an underground low-budget film scene in Tribeca and the East Village from the late-1970s to the mid-1980s. Rooted in the gritty, rebellious ethos of the Lower East Side’s no wave post-punk art scene, No Wave Cinema was marked by its DIY approach, low budgets, and an unpolished aesthetic that rejected mainstream filmmaking conventions. Musicians, visual artists, and filmmakers converged, regularly working across multiple mediums. This interdisciplinary collaboration and a sense of community was a hallmark of No Wave Cinema. 

Avant-garde filmmakers like Andy Warhol, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Jean-Pierre Melville, Rainer Werner Fassbinder and Jack Smith were notable influences, as was French Nouvelle Vague cinema, Italian neorealism, early 1970s intimate low budget European films, such as Bernardo Bertolucci’s 1972 film Last Tango in Paris, and a general interest in the history of film noir. Handheld Super 8 film cameras were initially the means to shoot the films often in the street, in downtown nightclubs, in cars, or apartments using available light.

The first No Wave film was Ivan Kral and Amos Poes 1976 film &quot;The Blank Generation&quot; that explored the No Wave music scene in CBGB&#x27;s with the Ramones, Talking Heads, Blondie and Patti Smith, among several others. No Wave filmmakers included Amos Poe, Eric Mitchell, Scott B and Beth B, Jim Jarmusch, Jamie Nares, Coleen Fitzgibbon, Diego Cortez, Charlie Ahearn, Tom DiCillo, Lizzie Borden, Susan Seidelman, Vincent Gallo, Charlie Ahearn, Adele Bertei, David Wojnarowicz, Vivienne Dick, Kiki Smith, Michael McClard, Andrea Callard and Seth Tillett. Eric Mitchell’s 1985 film &quot;The Way It Is or Eurydice in the Avenues&quot; is considered the climatic apogee of low-budget production values of no wave filmmaking as the film’s dialogue track was dubbed over the 35mm film in editing. 

For many years the scene was centered around the Mudd Club and Colab&#x27;s New Cinema Screening Room on St. Marks Place in the East Village. No Wave Cinema actors included Patti Astor, Steve Buscemi, Cookie Mueller, Debbie Harry, John Lurie, Eric Mitchell, Rockets Redglare, Vincent Gallo, Duncan Hannah, Anya Phillips, Rene Ricard, Arto Lindsay, Tom Wright, Richard Hell, and Lydia Lunch.

===Visual art===
Visual artists played a large role in the no wave scene, as visual artists often were playing in bands, or making videos and films, while making visual art for exhibition. An early influence on this aspect of the scene was Alan Vega (aka Alan Suicide) whose electronic junk sculpture predated his role in the music group Suicide, which he formed with fellow musician Martin Rev in 1970. They released &quot;Suicide&quot;, their first album, in 1977.

Important exhibitions of no wave visual art were Barbara Ess&#x27;s &quot;Just Another Asshole&quot; show and subsequent compilation projects and Colab&#x27;s organization of &quot;The Real Estate Show&quot;, &quot;The Times Square Show&quot;, and the &quot;Island of Negative Utopia&quot; show at The Kitchen.

No wave art found an ongoing home on the Lower East Side with the establishment of ABC No Rio Gallery in 1980, and a no wave punk aesthetic was a dominant strand in the art galleries of the East Village (from 1982 to 1986).

==Legacy==
In a foreword to the book &quot;No Wave&quot;, Weasel Walter wrote of the movement&#x27;s ongoing influence:

I began to express myself musically in a way that felt true to myself, constantly pushing the limits of idiom or genre and always screaming &quot;Fuck You!&quot; loudly in the process. It&#x27;s how I felt then and I still feel it now. The ideals behind the (anti-) movement known as No Wave were found in many other archetypes before and just as many afterwards, but for a few years around the late 1970s, the concentration of those ideals reached a cohesive, white-hot focus.

In 2004, Scott Crary made the documentary &quot;Kill Your Idols&quot;, including such no wave bands as Suicide, Teenage Jesus and the Jerks, DNA and Glenn Branca as well as bands influenced by no wave, including Sonic Youth, Swans, Foetus and others.

In 2007–2008, three books on the scene were published: Stuart Baker&#x27;s (editor) Soul Jazz Records &quot;New York Noise&quot; (with photographs by Paula Court), Marc Masters&#x27; Black Dog Publishing &quot;No Wave&quot; (with a foreword by Weasel Walter), and Thurston Moore and Byron Coley&#x27;s Harry N. Abrams &quot;No Wave: Post-Punk. Underground. New York. 1976–1980&quot; (for which Lydia Lunch wrote the Introduction).

Coleen Fitzgibbon and Alan W. Moore created a short film in 1978 (finished in 2009) of a New York City no wave concert to benefit Colab titled &quot;X Magazine Benefit&quot;, documenting performances by DNA, James Chance and the Contortions, and Boris Policeband. Shot in black and white and edited on video, the film captured the gritty look and sound of the music scene during that era. In 2013, it was exhibited at Salon 94, an art gallery in New York City.

In 2023, the No Wave movement received institutional recognition at the Centre Pompidou with a Nicolas Ballet curated exhibition entitled &quot;Who You Staring At: Culture visuelle de la scène no wave des années 1970 et 1980&quot; (&quot;Visual culture of the no wave scene in the 1970s and 1980s&quot;). Musical performances and three recorded conversations with No Wave artists were included as part of the exhibition.

<text>NeXT, Inc. (later NeXT Computer, Inc. and NeXT Software, Inc.) was an American technology company headquartered in Redwood City, California that specialized in computer workstations for higher education and business markets, and later developed web software. It was founded in 1985 by CEO Steve Jobs, the Apple Computer co-founder who had been forcibly removed from Apple that year. NeXT debuted with the NeXT Computer in 1988, and released the NeXTcube and smaller NeXTstation in 1990. The series had relatively limited sales, with only about 50,000 total units shipped. Nevertheless, the object-oriented programming and graphical user interface were highly influential trendsetters of computer innovation.

NeXT partnered with Sun Microsystems to create a programming environment called OpenStep, which decoupled the NeXTSTEP operating system&#x27;s application layer to host it on third-party operating systems. In 1993, NeXT withdrew from the hardware industry to concentrate on marketing OPENSTEP for Mach, its own OpenStep implementation for several other computer vendors. NeXT developed WebObjects, one of the first enterprise web frameworks, and although its market appeal was limited by its high price of , it is a prominent early example of dynamic web pages rather than static content.

Apple merged with NeXT in 1997 as part of a $427 million deal, including 1.5 million shares of Apple stock. The deal appointed Steve Jobs, then the chairman and CEO of NeXT, to an advisory role at Apple; and OPENSTEP for Mach was combined with the classic Mac OS, to create Rhapsody and Mac OS X.

Many successful applications have lineage from NeXT, including the first web browser and the video games &quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;Quake&quot;.

==History==

===Background===
In 1985, Apple co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs led a division campaign called SuperMicro, which was responsible for developing the Macintosh and Lisa computers. They were commercial successes on university campuses because Jobs had personally visited a few notable universities to promote his products, and because of Apple University Consortium, a discounted academic marketing program. The Consortium had earned over $50 million on computer sales by February 1984.

Jobs met Paul Berg, a Nobel Laureate in chemistry, at a luncheon in Silicon Valley held to honor President of France François Mitterrand. Berg was frustrated by the time and expense of researching recombinant DNA via wet laboratories, and suggested that Jobs should use his influence to create a &quot;3M computer&quot; that is designed for higher education.

Jobs was intrigued by Berg&#x27;s concept of a workstation and contemplated starting a higher-education computer company in late 1985, amid increasing turmoil at Apple. Jobs&#x27;s division did not release the upgraded versions of the Macintosh computer and much of the Macintosh Office software. As a result, its sales plummeted, and Apple was forced to write off millions of dollars in unsold inventory. In 1985, John Sculley ousted Jobs from his executive role at Apple and replaced him with Jean-Louis Gassée. Later that year, Jobs began a power struggle to regain control over his company. The board of directors sided with Sculley, and Jobs took a business trip to Western Europe and the Soviet Union on behalf of Apple.

===Original NeXT team===

In September 1985, after several months of being sidelined, Jobs resigned from Apple. He told the board he was leaving to set up a new computer company, and that he would be taking several Apple employees from the SuperMicro division with him, but he also promised that his new company would not compete with Apple and might even consider licensing their designs to them under the Macintosh brand.

Several former Apple employees followed him to NeXT, including Joanna Hoffman, Bud Tribble, George Crow, Rich Page, Susan Barnes, Susan Kare, and Dan&#x27;l Lewin. After consulting with major educational buyers from around the country, including a follow-up meeting with Paul Berg, a tentative specification for the workstation was drawn up. It was designed to be powerful enough to run wet lab simulations and affordable enough for dormitory rooms. Before the specifications were finished, however, Apple sued NeXT on September 23, 1985, for &quot;nefarious schemes&quot; to take advantage of the cofounders&#x27; insider information. Jobs argued, &quot;It is hard to think that a $2 billion company with 4,300-plus people couldn&#x27;t compete with six people in blue jeans.&quot; The suit was eventually dismissed before trial.

In 1986, Jobs recruited graphic designer Paul Rand to create a brand identity for . Jobs recalled, &quot;I asked him if he would come up with a few options, and he said, &#x27;No, I will solve your problem for you and you will pay me. You don&#x27;t have to use the solution. If you want options go talk to other people. Rand created a 20-page brochure detailing the brand, including the precise angle used for the logo (28°) and a new company name spelling, NeXT.

===1987–1993: NeXT Computer===
====First generation====

In mid-1986, NeXT changed its business plan to develop both hardware and software, rather than just workstations. Rich Page, a NeXT cofounder who formerly directed Apple&#x27;s Lisa team, led a team to develop the hardware, while Mach kernel engineer Avie Tevanian led the development of NeXT&#x27;s operating system, NeXTSTEP. NeXT&#x27;s first factory was established in Fremont, California in 1987, capable of manufacturing about 150,000 machines per year. NeXT&#x27;s first workstation is the NeXT Computer, nicknamed &quot;the cube&quot; due to its distinctive magnesium cubic case. The case was designed by Hartmut Esslinger and his team at Frog Design.

In 1987, Ross Perot became NeXT&#x27;s first major outside investor. He invested $20 million for 16% of NeXT&#x27;s stock after seeing a segment about NeXT on the 1986 PBS documentary &quot;Entrepreneurs&quot;. In 1988, he joined the company&#x27;s board of directors.

NeXT and Adobe collaborated on Display PostScript (DPS), a 2D graphics engine that was released in 1987. NeXT engineers wrote an alternative windowing engine edition to take full advantage of NeXTSTEP. NeXT engineers used DPS for on-screen graphics such as title bar and scroller for the user-space windowing library.

The original design team anticipated completing the computer in early 1987 and launching it for by mid-year. On October 12, 1988, the NeXT Computer received standing ovations when it was revealed at a private gala event, &quot;NeXT Introductionthe Introduction to the NeXT Generation of Computers for Education&quot; at the Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall in San Francisco, California. The following day, selected educators and software engineers were invited to attend the first public technical overview of the NeXT computer at the event &quot;The NeXT Day&quot; held at the San Francisco Hilton. The event gave developers interested in NeXT software an insight into their architecture, object-oriented programming, and the NeXT Computer. The luncheon speaker was Steve Jobs.

The first NeXT Computers were test launched in 1989, and then NeXT sold a limited number to universities with NeXTSTEP 0.9 beta pre-installed. Initially, this targeted the United States higher-education institutions only, with a base price of . The computer was widely reviewed in magazines, primarily the hardware portion. When asked if he was upset that the computer&#x27;s debut was delayed by several months, Jobs responded, &quot;Late? This computer is five years ahead of its time!&quot;

The NeXT Computer has the 25 MHz Motorola 68030 central processing unit (CPU). The Motorola 88000 RISC chip was originally considered, but it was not available in sufficient quantities. The computer has between 8 and 64 MB of random-access memory (RAM), a 256 MB magneto-optical (MO) drive, a 40 MB (swap-only), 330 MB, or 660 MB hard disk drive, 10BASE2 Ethernet, NuBus, and a 17-inch MegaPixel grayscale display with 1120×832 pixels. In 1989, a typical new PC, Macintosh, or Amiga computer included a few megabytes of RAM, a 640×480 16-color or 320x240 4,096-color display, a 10- to 20-megabyte hard drive, and few networking capabilities. It is the first computer to ship with a general-purpose DSP chip (Motorola 56001) on the motherboard. This supports sophisticated music and sound processing, including the Music Kit software.

The magneto-optical (MO) drive manufactured by Canon Inc. is the primary mass storage device. This drive technology was relatively new to the market, and the NeXT is the first computer to use it. MO drives were cheaper but much slower than hard drives, with an average seek time of 96 ms; Jobs negotiated Canon&#x27;s initial price of $150 per blank MO disk so that they could sell at retail for only $50. The drive&#x27;s design made it impossible to move files between computers without a network, because each NeXT Computer has only one MO drive and the disk can not be removed without shutting down the system. The drive&#x27;s limited speed and capacity makes it insufficient as NeXTSTEP&#x27;s primary medium.

In 1989, NeXT started a deal for former Compaq reseller Businessland to sell the NeXT Computer in international markets. Selling through a retailer was a major change from NeXT&#x27;s original business model of only selling directly to students and educational institutions. Businessland founder David Norman predicted that sales of the NeXT Computer would surpass sales of Compaq computers after 12 months.

That year, Canon invested in NeXT, for a 16.67% stake, making NeXT worth almost $600 million. This had the condition of installing NeXTSTEP on its own workstations, greatly expanding NeXTSTEP&#x27;s market. After NeXT exited the hardware business, Canon produced a PC line called &quot;object.station&quot;—including models 31, 41, 50, and 52—specifically designed to run NeXTSTEP on Intel. Canon was NeXT&#x27;s distributor in Japan.

The NeXT Computer was released in 1990 for . In June 1991, Perot resigned from the board of directors to concentrate on his company, Perot Systems, a Plano, Texas–based software system integrator.

====Second generation====
In 1990, NeXT released a second generation of workstations, a revised NeXT Computer called NeXTcube and the NeXTstation. The NeXTstation&#x27;s nickname is &quot;the slab&quot; for its low-rise box form-factor. Jobs ensured that NeXT staffers did not nickname the NeXTstation &quot;pizza box&quot; to avoid inadvertent comparison with competitor Sun workstations, which already had that nickname.

The machines were initially planned to use the 2.88 MB floppy drive, but its floppy disks were expensive and had failed to supplant the 1.44 MB floppy. NeXT used the CD-ROM drive instead, which eventually became the industry standard for storage. Color graphics were available on the NeXTstation Color and NeXTdimension graphics processor hardware for the NeXTcube. The new computers, with the new Motorola 68040 processor, were cheaper and faster than their predecessors.

In 1992, NeXT launched &quot;Turbo&quot; variants of the NeXTcube and NeXTstation, with a 33 MHz 68040 processor and the maximum RAM capacity increased to 128 MB. In 1992, NeXT sold 20,000 computers, counting upgraded motherboards on back order as system sales. This was a small number compared with competitors, but the company reported sales of $140 million for the year, which encouraged Canon to invest a further $30 million to keep the company afloat.

In total, 50,000 NeXT machines were sold, including thousands to the then super-secret National Reconnaissance Office located in Chantilly, Virginia. NeXT&#x27;s long-term plan was to migrate to one of the emerging high-performance Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) architectures, with the NeXT RISC Workstation (NRW). Initially, the NRW was to be based on the Motorola 88110 processor, but it was later redesigned around dual PowerPC 601s, due to a lack of confidence in Motorola&#x27;s commitment to the 88000-series architecture in the time leading up to the AIM alliance&#x27;s transition to PowerPC.

===1993–1996: NeXT Software, Inc.===

In late 1991, in preparation for NeXT&#x27;s future withdrawal from the hardware industry, the company started porting the NeXTSTEP operating system to Intel 80486-based IBM PC compatible computers. In January 1992, it was demonstrated at NeXTWorld Expo. By mid-1993, the process was completed, and version 3.1 (NeXTSTEP 486) was released.

NeXTSTEP 3.x was later ported to PA-RISC- and SPARC-based platforms, for a total of four versions: NeXTSTEP/NeXT (for NeXT&#x27;s own hardware), NeXTSTEP/Intel, NeXTSTEP/PA-RISC, and NeXTSTEP/SPARC. Although the latter three ports were not widely used, NeXTSTEP gained popularity at institutions such as First Chicago NBD, Swiss Bank Corporation, O&#x27;Connor and Company, due to its sophisticated 
programming model. The software was used by many U.S. government agencies, including the United States Naval Research Laboratory, the National Security Agency, the Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the National Reconnaissance Office. Some IBM PC clone vendors offered somewhat customized hardware solutions that were delivered running NeXTSTEP on Intel, such as the Elonex NextStation and the Canon object.station 41.

In 1993, NeXT withdrew from the hardware industry, and the company was renamed to NeXT Software, Inc. Consequently, 230 of the 530 staff employees were laid off. NeXT negotiated to sell its hardware business, including the Fremont factory, to Canon, which later canceled the deal. Work on the PowerPC machines was stopped, along with all hardware production. Sun CEO Scott McNealy announced plans to invest $10 million in 1993 and use NeXT software in future Sun systems. NeXT partnered with Sun to create a programming environment called OpenStep, which is NeXTSTEP&#x27;s application layer decoupled for third party operating systems. In 1994, Microsoft and NeXT collaborated on a port of OpenStep to Windows NT, which was never released.

In January 1994, a developers&#x27; conference was held in Washington, D.C. Attendees of the 1994 NeXT East Coast Developer Conference had the opportunity to purchase a software bundle including NEXTSTEP 3.2.

Stepstone, originally named Productivity Products International (PPI), was a software company founded in 1983 by Brad Cox and Tom Love, best known for releasing the original version of the Objective-C programming language. In April 1995, NeXT acquired the Objective-C trademark and rights from Stepstone. Stepstone concurrently licensed back from NeXT the right to continue selling its Objective-C based products. Apple Computer later acquired the rights to Objective-C along with NeXT. 

After exiting the hardware business, NeXT focused on other operating systems. New OpenStep products were released, including OpenStep Enterprise for Windows NT. NeXT launched WebObjects, a platform for building large-scale dynamic web applications. It did not achieve wide popularity, partly because of the initial high price of , but it did generate profit for the company. WebObjects is the first and most prominent early example of a web application server that enabled dynamic page generation based on user interactions instead of static web content. WebObjects was used by many large businesses including Dell, Disney, Deutsche Bank, the BBC, Ford, Nissan, and later Apple for the iTunes Store and online Apple Store.

===1997–2006: Acquisition by Apple===
On December 20, 1996, Apple Computer announced its intention to acquire NeXT. Apple paid $427 million in cash, shares, stock options, and debt. Steve Jobs preferred to only receive cash, but Gil Amelio insisted he take 1.5 million Apple shares to give the deal credibility. The main purpose of the acquisition was to use NeXTSTEP as a foundation to replace the dated classic Mac OS. Steve Jobs also returned to Apple as a consultant.

The deal was finalized on February 7, 1997. In 2000, Jobs took the CEO position as a permanent assignment, holding the position until his resignation on August 24, 2011, shortly before his death on October 5, 2011.

Several NeXT executives replaced their Apple counterparts when Jobs restructured the company&#x27;s board of directors. Over the next five years the NeXTSTEP operating system was ported to the PowerPC architecture of Macintosh. At the same time, an Intel port and OpenStep Enterprise toolkit for Windows were produced. That operating system was codenamed Rhapsody, and the crossplatform toolkit is Yellow Box. For backward compatibility, Apple added the Blue Box to Rhapsody, running existing Mac applications in a self-contained cooperative multitasking environment.

A server version of Rhapsody was released as Mac OS X Server 1.0 in 1999, and the first consumer version, Mac OS X 10.0, in 2001. The OpenStep developer toolkit was renamed Cocoa. Blue Box was renamed Classic Environment and changed to run applications full-screen without requiring a separate window. Apple included an updated version of the original Macintosh toolbox, called Carbon, running existing Mac applications natively without the constraints of Blue Box. Some of NeXTSTEP&#x27;s interface features are used in Mac OS X, including the Dock, the Services menu, the Finder&#x27;s &quot;Column&quot; view, and the Cocoa text system.

NeXTSTEP&#x27;s processor-independent capabilities were retained in Mac OS X, leading to PowerPC, x86, and ARM versions. Only PowerPC versions were publicly available before 2006 and were discontinued by 2009, and ARM versions were not released until 2020. Apple transitioned its Mac computers to Intel processors by August 2006, and to ARM processors as of September 2022.

==Corporate culture and community==

Jobs created a unique corporate culture at NeXT in terms of facilities, salaries, and benefits. Jobs had experimented with some structural changes at Apple, but at NeXT he abandoned conventional corporate structures, instead making a &quot;community&quot; with &quot;members&quot; instead of employees. There were only two different salaries at NeXT until the early 1990s. Team members who joined before 1986 were paid and those who joined afterward were paid . This caused a few awkward situations where managers were paid less than their employees. Later, employees were given performance reviews and raises every six months. To foster openness, all employees had full access to the payrolls, although few employees ever used the privilege. NeXT&#x27;s health insurance plan offered benefits to not only married couples but unmarried and same-sex couples, although the latter privilege was later withdrawn due to insurance complications. The payroll schedule was also very different from other Silicon Valley companies at the time, because instead of employees being paid twice per month at the end of the pay period, they were paid once per month in advance.

Jobs found office space in Palo Alto, California, at 3475 Deer Creek Road, occupying a glass-and-concrete building that featured a staircase designed by the architect I. M. Pei. The first floor had hardwood flooring and large worktables where the workstations would be assembled. To avoid inventory errors, NeXT used the just-in-time (JIT) inventory strategy. The company contracted out for all major , such as mainboards and cases, and had the finished components shipped to the first floor for assembly. On the second floor was office space with an open floor plan. The only enclosed rooms were Jobs&#x27;s office and a few conference rooms.

NeXT&#x27;s expansion prompted renting an office at 800 and 900 Chesapeake Drive, in Redwood City, also designed by Pei. The architectural centerpiece was a &quot;floating&quot; staircase with no visible supports. The open floor plan was retained, with furnishings that were luxurious, such as $5,000 chairs, $10,000 sofas, and Ansel Adams prints.

NeXT&#x27;s Palo Alto office was subsequently occupied by Internet Shopping Network (a subsidiary of Home Shopping Network) in 1994, and later by SAP AG. Its Redwood City office was later occupied by ApniCure and OncoMed Pharmaceuticals Inc.

The first issue of &quot;NeXTWORLD&quot; magazine was printed in 1991. It was edited by Michael Miley and, later, Dan Ruby and was published in San Francisco by Integrated Media. It was the only mainstream periodical to discuss NeXT computers and software. The publication was discontinued in 1994 after only four volumes. A developer conference, NeXTWORLD Expo, was held in 1991 and 1992 at the San Francisco Civic Center and in 1993 and 1994 at the Moscone Center in San Francisco, with Jobs as the keynote speaker.

==Legacy==
Though not very profitable, the company had a wide-ranging impact on the computer industry. Object-oriented programming and graphical user interfaces became more common after the 1988 release of the NeXTcube and NeXTSTEP. The technologically successful platform was often held as the trendsetter when other companies started to emulate the success of NeXT&#x27;s object-oriented system.

Widely seen as a response to NeXT, Microsoft announced the Cairo project in 1991; the Cairo specification included similar object-oriented user-interface features for a proposed consumer version of Windows NT. Although Cairo was ultimately abandoned, some elements were integrated into other projects.

By 1993, Taligent was considered by the press to be a competitor in objects and operating systems, even without any product release, and with NeXT as a main point of comparison. For the first few years, Taligent&#x27;s theoretical innovation was often compared to NeXT&#x27;s older but mature and commercially established platform, but Taligent&#x27;s launch in 1995 was called &quot;too little, too late&quot;, especially when compared with NeXT.

Several developers used the NeXT platform to write pioneering programs. For example, in 1990, computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee used a NeXT Computer to develop the first web browser and web server. The video game series &quot;Doom&quot;, and &quot;Quake&quot; were developed by id Software using NeXT computers. Other commercial programs were released for NeXT computers, including Altsys Virtuoso—a vector-drawing program with page-layout features, which was ported to Mac OS and Windows as Aldus FreeHand v4—and the Lotus Improv spreadsheet program.

<doc id="21699" wikidata="Q5680" url="?curid=21699" title="Nineveh">
<text>Nineveh ( ; , &quot;, Ninua&quot;; , &quot;Nīnəwē&quot;; , &quot;Naynawā&quot;; , &quot;Nīnwē&quot;), also known in early modern times as Kouyunjik, was an ancient Assyrian city of Upper Mesopotamia, located in the modern-day city of Mosul (itself built out of the Assyrian town of Mepsila) in northern Iraq. It is located on the eastern bank of the Tigris River and was the capital and largest city of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, as well as the largest city in the world for several decades. Today, it is a common name for the half of Mosul that lies on the eastern bank of the Tigris, and the country&#x27;s Nineveh Governorate takes its name from it.

It was the largest city in the world for approximately fifty years until the year 612 BC when, after a bitter period of civil war in Assyria, it was sacked by a coalition of its former subject peoples including the Babylonians, Medes, and Scythians. The city was never again a political or administrative centre, but by Late Antiquity it was the seat of an Assyrian Christian bishop of the Assyrian Church of the East. It declined relative to Mosul during the Middle Ages and was mostly abandoned by the 14th century AD after the massacres and dispersal of Assyrian Christians by Tamurlane.

Its ruins lie across the river from the historical city center of Mosul. The two main tells, or mound-ruins, within the walls are Tell Kuyunjiq and Tell Nabī Yūnus, site of a shrine to Jonah. According to the Hebrew Bible and the Quran, Jonah was a prophet who preached to Nineveh. Large numbers of Assyrian sculptures and other artifacts have been excavated from the ruins of Nineveh, and are now located in museums around the world.
==Name==

The English placename &quot;Nineveh&quot; comes from the Latin &#x27; and the Koine Greek &quot;Nineuḗ&quot; () under influence of the Biblical Hebrew &quot;Nīnəweh&quot; (), from the Akkadian &#x27; ( &quot;Ninâ&quot;) or &quot;&quot;. The city was also known as &quot;Ninuwa&quot; in Mari; &quot;Ninawa&quot; in Aramaic; Ninwe (ܢܸܢܘܵܐ) in Syriac; and &quot;Ninawa&quot; () in Arabic.

The original meaning of the name is unclear but may have referred to a patron goddess. The city was said to be devoted to &quot;the goddess Inanna of Nineveh&quot; and &quot;Nina&quot; was one of the Sumerian and Assyrian names for that goddess. The Assyrian cuneiform for &quot;Ninâ&quot; () is a fish within a house (cf. Aramaic &quot;nuna&quot;, &quot;fish&quot;). This may have simply intended &quot;Place of Fish&quot; or may have indicated a goddess associated with fish or the Tigris, possibly originally of Hurrian origin. The word נון/נונא in Old Babylonian refers to the Anthiinae genus of fish, further indicating the possibility of an association between the name Nineveh and fish. In the Quran, Jonah is referred to as &quot;Dhu&#x27;n-Nun&quot; &quot;owner of the fish&quot;, though this may be related to the story of him being swallowed by a &quot;large fish&quot;.

&quot;Nabī Yūnus&quot; is the Arabic for &quot;Prophet Jonah&quot;. &quot;Kuyunjiq&quot; was, according to Layard, a Turkish name (Layard used the form &quot;kouyunjik&quot;, diminutive of &quot;koyun&quot; &quot;sheep&quot; in Turkish); known as &quot;Armousheeah&quot; by the Arabs, it is thought to have some connection with the Qara Qoyunlu dynasty. These toponyms refer to the areas to the North and South of the Khosr stream, respectively: Kuyunjiq is the name for the whole northern sector enclosed by the city walls and is dominated by the large (35 ha) mound of Tell Kuyunjiq, while Nabī (or more commonly Nebi) Yunus is the southern sector around of the mosque of Prophet Yunus/Jonah, which is located on Tell Nebi Yunus.

== Geography ==
The remains of ancient Nineveh, the areas of Kuyunjiq and Nabī Yūnus with their mounds, are located on a level part of the plain at the junction of the Tigris and the Khosr Rivers within an area of circumscribed by a fortification wall. This whole extensive space is now one immense area of ruins overlaid by c. one third by the Nebi Yunus suburbs of the city of eastern Mosul.

The site of ancient Nineveh is bisected by the Khosr river. North of the Khosr, the site is called Kuyunjiq, including the acropolis of Tell Kuyunjiq; the illegal village of Rahmaniye lay in eastern Kuyunjiq. South of the Khosr, the urbanized area is called Nebi Yunus (also Ghazliya, Jezayr, Jammasa), including Tell Nebi Yunus where the mosque of the Prophet Jonah and a palace of Esarhaddon/Ashurbanipal below it are located. South of the street Al-&#x27;Asady (made by Daesh destroying swaths of the city walls) the area is called Jounub Ninawah or Shara Pepsi.

Nineveh was an important junction for commercial routes crossing the Tigris on the great roadway between the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean, thus uniting the East and the West, it received wealth from many sources, so that it became one of the greatest of all the region&#x27;s ancient cities, and the last capital of the Neo-Assyrian Empire.

== History ==

=== Early history ===

Nineveh was one of the oldest and greatest cities in antiquity. Texts from the Hellenistic period later offered an eponymous Ninus as the founder of Νίνου πόλις (Ninopolis), although there is no historical basis for this. Book of Genesis 10:11 says that Nimrod or Ashur, depending on the translation, built Nineveh. The context of Nineveh was as one of many centers within the regional development of Upper Mesopotamia. This area is defined as the plains which can support rain-fed agriculture. It exists as a narrow band from the Syrian coast to the Zagros mountains. It is bordered by deserts to the south and mountains to the north. The cultural practices, technology, and economy in this region were shared and they followed a similar trajectory out of the neolithic.

====Neolithic====
Caves in the Zagros Mountains adjacent to the north side of the Nineveh Plains were used as PPNA settlements, most famously Shanidar Cave. Nineveh itself was founded as early as 6000 BC during the late Neolithic period. Deep sounding at Nineveh uncovered soil layers that have been dated to early in the era of the Hassuna archaeological culture. The development and culture of Nineveh paralleled Tepe Gawra and Tell Arpachiyah a few kilometers to the northeast. Nineveh was a typical farming village in the Halaf Period.

====Chalcolithic====
In 5000 BC, Nineveh transitioned from a Halaf village to an Ubaid village. During the Late Chalcolithic period Nineveh was part one of the few Ubaid villages in Upper Mesopotamia which became a proto-city. Others include Ugarit, Brak, Hamoukar, Arbela, Alep, and regionally Susa, Eridu, Nippur. During the period between 4500 and 4000 BC it grew to 40 hectares in size.

The greater Nineveh area is notable in the diffusion of metal technology across the near east as the first location outside of Anatolia to smelt copper. Tell Arpachiyah has the oldest copper smelting remains, and Tepe Gawra has the oldest metal work. The copper came from the mines at Ergani.

===Early Bronze Age===
Nineveh became a trade colony of Uruk during the Uruk Expansion because of its location as the highest navigable point on the Tigris. It was contemporary and had a similar function to Habuba Kabira on the Euphrates. By 3000 BC, the Kish civilization had expanded into Nineveh. At this time, the main temple of Nineveh becomes known as Ishtar temple, re-dedicated to the Semite goddess Ishtar, in the form of Ishtar of Nineveh. Ishtar of Nineveh was conflated with Šauška from the Hurro-Urartian pantheon. This temple was called &#x27;House of Exorcists&#x27; (Cuneiform: 𒂷𒈦𒈦 GA2.MAŠ.MAŠ; Sumerian: e2 mašmaš). The context of the etymology surrounding the name is the Exorcist called a Mashmash in Sumerian, was a freelance magician who operated independent of the official priesthood, and was in part a medical professional via the act of expelling demons.

==== Ninevite 5 period ====
The regional influence of Nineveh became particularly pronounced during the archaeological period known as &quot;Ninevite 5&quot;, or &quot;Ninevite V&quot; (2900–2600 BC). This period is defined primarily by the characteristic pottery that is found widely throughout Upper Mesopotamia. Also, for the Upper Mesopotamian region, the &quot;Early Jezirah&quot; chronology has been developed by archaeologists. According to this regional chronology, &#x27;Ninevite 5&#x27; is equivalent to the Early Jezirah I–II period.
Ninevite 5 was preceded by the Late Uruk period. Ninevite 5 pottery is roughly contemporary to the Early Transcaucasian culture ware, and the Jemdet Nasr period ware. Iraqi &quot;Scarlet Ware&quot; culture also belongs to this period; this colourful painted pottery is somewhat similar to Jemdet Nasr ware. Scarlet Ware was first documented in the Diyala River basin in Iraq. Later, it was also found in the nearby Hamrin Basin, and in Luristan. It is also contemporary with the Proto-Elamite period in Susa.

====Akkadian period====
At this time, Nineveh was still an autonomous city-state. It was incorporated into the Akkadian Empire. The early city (and subsequent buildings) was constructed on a fault line and, consequently, suffered damage from a number of earthquakes. One such event destroyed the first temple of Ishtar, which was rebuilt in 2260 BC by the Akkadian king Manishtushu.

====Ur III period====
In the final phase of the Early Bronze, Mesopotamia was dominated by the Ur III empire.

===Middle Bronze===
After the fall of Ur in 2000 BC, with the transition into the Middle Bronze, Nineveh was absorbed into the rising power of Assyria.

==== Old Assyrian period ====
The historic Nineveh is mentioned in the Old Assyrian Empire during the reign of Shamshi-Adad I (1809–1775) in about 1800 BC as a centre of worship of Ishtar, whose cult was responsible for the city&#x27;s early importance.

===Late Bronze===
==== Mitanni period ====

The goddess&#x27;s statue was sent to Pharaoh Amenhotep III of Egypt in the 14th century BC, by orders of the king of Mitanni. The Assyrian city of Nineveh became one of Mitanni&#x27;s vassals for half a century until the early 14th century BC.

==== Middle Assyrian period ====
The Assyrian king Ashur-uballit I reclaimed it in 1365 BC while overthrowing the Mitanni Empire and creating the Middle Assyrian Empire (1365–1050 BC).

There is a large body of evidence to show that Assyrian monarchs built extensively in Nineveh during the late 3rd and 2nd millennia BC; it appears to have been originally an &quot;Assyrian provincial town&quot;. Later monarchs whose inscriptions have appeared on the high city include the Middle Assyrian Empire kings Shalmaneser I (1274–1245 BC) and Tiglath-Pileser I (1114–1076 BC), both of whom were active builders in Assur (Ashur).

===Iron Age===
==== Neo-Assyrians ====
During the Neo-Assyrian Empire, particularly from the time of Ashurnasirpal II (ruled 883–859 BC) onward, there was considerable architectural expansion. Successive monarchs such as Tiglath-pileser III, Sargon II, Sennacherib, Esarhaddon, and Ashurbanipal maintained and founded new palaces, as well as temples to Sîn, Ashur, Nergal, Shamash, Ninurta, Ishtar, Tammuz, Nisroch and Nabu.

==== Sennacherib&#x27;s development of Nineveh ====
It was Sennacherib who made Nineveh a truly influential city (), as he laid out new streets and squares and built within it the South West Palace, or &quot;palace without a rival&quot;, the plan of which has been mostly recovered and has overall dimensions of about . It had at least 80 rooms, many of which were lined with sculpture. A large number of cuneiform tablets were found in the palace. The solid foundation was made out of limestone blocks and mud bricks; it was tall. In total, the foundation is made of roughly of brick (approximately 160 million bricks). The walls on top, made out of mud brick, were an additional tall.

Some of the principal doorways were flanked by colossal stone &quot;lamassu&quot; door figures weighing up to ; these were winged Mesopotamian lions or bulls, with human heads. These were transported from quarries at Balatai, and they had to be lifted up once they arrived at the site, presumably by a ramp. There are also of stone Assyrian palace reliefs, that include pictorial records documenting every construction step including carving the statues and transporting them on a barge. One picture shows 44 men towing a colossal statue. The carving shows three men directing the operation while standing on the Colossus. Once the statues arrived at their destination, the final carving was done. Most of the statues weigh between .

The stone carvings in the walls include many battle scenes, impalings and scenes showing Sennacherib&#x27;s men parading the spoils of war before him. The inscriptions boasted of his conquests: he wrote of Babylon: &quot;Its inhabitants, young and old, I did not spare, and with their corpses I filled the streets of the city.&quot; A full and characteristic set shows the campaign leading up to the siege of Lachish in 701; it is the &quot;finest&quot; from the reign of Sennacherib, and now in the British Museum. He later wrote about a battle in Lachish: &quot;And Hezekiah of Judah who had not submitted to my yoke ... him I shut up in Jerusalem his royal city like a caged bird. Earthworks I threw up against him, and anyone coming out of his city gate I made pay for his crime. His cities which I had plundered I had cut off from his land.&quot;

At this time, Nineveh comprised about of land, and fifteen great gates penetrated its walls. An elaborate system of eighteen canals brought water from the hills to Nineveh, and several sections of a magnificently constructed aqueduct erected by Sennacherib were discovered at Jerwan, about distant. The enclosed area had more than 100,000 inhabitants (maybe closer to 150,000), about twice as many as Babylon at the time, placing it among the largest settlements worldwide.

Some scholars such as Stephanie Dalley at Oxford believe that the garden which Sennacherib built next to his palace, with its associated irrigation works, were the original Hanging Gardens of Babylon; Dalley&#x27;s argument is based on a disputation of the traditional placement of the Hanging Gardens attributed to Berossus together with a combination of literary and archaeological evidence.

==== After Ashurbanipal ====

The greatness of Nineveh was short-lived. In around 627 BC, after the death of its last great king Ashurbanipal, the Neo-Assyrian Empire began to unravel through a series of bitter civil wars between rival claimants for the throne, and in 616 BC Assyria was attacked by its own former vassals, the Chaldeans, Babylonians, Medes, and Scythians. In about 616 BC Kalhu was sacked, the allied forces eventually reached Nineveh, besieging and sacking the city in 612 BC, following bitter house-to-house fighting, after which it was razed. Most of the people in the city who could not escape to the last Assyrian strongholds in the north and west were either massacred or deported out of the city and into the countryside where they founded new settlements. Many unburied skeletons were found by the archaeologists at the site. The Assyrian Empire then came to an end by 605 BC, the Medes and Babylonians dividing its colonies between themselves.

It is not clear whether Nineveh came under the rule of the Medes or the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 612. The Babylonian &quot;Chronicle Concerning the Fall of Nineveh&quot; records that Nineveh was &quot;turned into mounds and heaps&quot;, but this is literary hyperbole. The complete destruction of Nineveh has traditionally been seen as confirmed by the Hebrew Book of Ezekiel and the Greek &quot;Retreat of the Ten Thousand&quot; of Xenophon (d. 354 BC). There are no later cuneiform tablets in Akkadian from Nineveh. Although devastated in 612 BC, the city was not completely abandoned. Yet, to the Greek historians Ctesias and Herodotus (c. 400 BC), Nineveh was a thing of the past; and when Xenophon passed the place in the 4th century BC he described it as abandoned.

===Later history===
The earliest piece of written evidence for the persistence of Nineveh as a settlement is possibly the Cyrus Cylinder of 539/538 BC, but the reading of this is disputed. If correctly read as Nineveh, it indicates that Cyrus the Great restored the temple of Ishtar at Nineveh and probably encouraged resettlement. A number of cuneiform Elamite tablets have been found at Nineveh. They probably date from the time of the revival of Elam in the century following the collapse of Assyria. The Hebrew Book of Jonah, which was most likely written between 793 and 758 BC, is an account of the city&#x27;s repentance and God&#x27;s mercy which prevented destruction.

Archaeologically, there is evidence of repairs at the temple of Nabu after 612 BC and for the continued use of Sennacherib&#x27;s palace. There is evidence of syncretic Hellenistic cults. A statue of Hermes has been found and a Greek inscription attached to a shrine of the Sebitti. A statue of Herakles Epitrapezios dated to the 2nd century AD has also been found. The library of Ashurbanipal may still have been in use until around the time of Alexander the Great.

The city was actively resettled under the Seleucid Empire. There is evidence of more changes in Sennacherib&#x27;s palace under the Parthian Empire. The Parthians also established a municipal mint at Nineveh coining in bronze. According to Tacitus, in AD 50 Meherdates, a claimant to the Parthian throne with Roman support, took Nineveh.

By Late Antiquity, Nineveh was restricted to the east bank of the Tigris and the west bank was uninhabited. Under the Sasanian Empire, Nineveh was not an administrative centre. By the 2nd century AD there were Christians present and by 554 it was a bishopric of the Church of the East. King Khosrow II (591–628) built a fortress on the west bank, and two Christian monasteries were constructed around 570 and 595. This growing settlement was not called Mosul until after the Arab conquests. It may have been called Hesnā ʿEbrāyē (Jews&#x27; Fort).

In 627, the city was the site of the Battle of Nineveh between the Eastern Roman Empire and the Sasanians. In 641, it was conquered by the Arabs, who built a mosque on the west bank and turned it into an administrative centre. Under the Umayyad dynasty, Mosul eclipsed Nineveh, which was reduced to a Christian suburb with limited new construction. By the 13th century, Nineveh was mostly ruins and was subsequently absorbed into Mosul. A church was converted into a Muslim shrine to the prophet Jonah, which continued to attract pilgrims until its destruction by ISIL in 2014. The modern city of Mosul is occasionally referred to as Nineveh, such as during the operation to retake Mosul in 2016–17.

== Biblical Nineveh ==
In the Hebrew Bible, Nineveh is first mentioned in Genesis 10:11: &quot;Ashur left that land, and built Nineveh&quot;. Some modern English translations interpret &quot;Ashur&quot; in the Hebrew of this verse as the country &quot;Assyria&quot; rather than a person, thus making Nimrod, rather than Ashur, the founder of Nineveh. Sir Walter Raleigh&#x27;s notion that Nimrod built Nineveh has been disputed by eighteenth century scholar Samuel Shuckford. The discovery of the fifteen Jubilees texts found amongst the Dead Sea Scrolls has since shown that, according to the Jewish sects of Qumran, Genesis 10:11 affirms the apportionment of Nineveh to Ashur. The attribution of Nineveh to Ashur is also supported by the Greek Septuagint, King James Bible, Geneva Bible, and by Roman historian Flavius Josephus in his &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; (Antiquities, i, vi, 4).
Nineveh was the flourishing capital of the Assyrian Empire and was the home of King Sennacherib, King of Assyria, during the Biblical reign of King Hezekiah () and the lifetime of Judean prophet Isaiah (). As recorded in Hebrew scripture, Nineveh was also the place where Sennacherib died at the hands of his two sons, who then fled to the vassal land of &quot;`rrt&quot; (Urartu). The book of the prophet Nahum is almost exclusively taken up with prophetic denunciations against Nineveh. Its ruin and utter desolation are foretold. Its end was strange, sudden, and tragic. According to the Bible, it was God&#x27;s doing, his judgment on Assyria&#x27;s pride. In fulfillment of prophecy, God made &quot;an utter end of the place&quot;. It became a &quot;desolation&quot;. The prophet Zephaniah also predicts its destruction along with the fall of the empire of which it was the capital. Nineveh is also the setting of the Book of Tobit.

The Book of Jonah, set in the days of the Assyrian Empire, describes it as an &quot;exceedingly great city of three days&#x27; journey in breadth&quot;, whose population at that time is given as &quot;more than 120,000&quot;. Genesis 10:11–12 lists four cities &quot;Nineveh, Rehoboth, Calah, and Resen&quot;, ambiguously stating that either Resen or Calah is &quot;the great city&quot;. The ruins of Kuyunjiq, Nimrud, Karamlesh and Khorsabad form the four corners of an irregular quadrilateral. The ruins of the &quot;great city&quot; Nineveh, with the whole area included within the parallelogram they form by lines drawn from the one to the other, are generally regarded as consisting of these four sites. The description of Nineveh in Jonah likely was a reference to greater Nineveh, including the surrounding cities of Rehoboth, Calah and Resen The Book of Jonah depicts Nineveh as a wicked city worthy of destruction. God sent Jonah to preach to the Ninevites of their coming destruction, and they fasted and repented because of this. As a result, God spared the city; when Jonah protests against this, God states he is showing mercy for the population who are ignorant of the difference between right and wrong (&quot;who cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand&quot;) and mercy for the beasts in the city.

Nineveh&#x27;s repentance and salvation from evil can be found in the Hebrew Tanakh, also known as the Old Testament, and referred to in the Christian New Testament and Muslim Quran. To this day, Syriac and Oriental Orthodox churches commemorate the three days Jonah spent inside the fish during the Fast of Nineveh. Some Christians observe this holiday fast by refraining from food and drink, with churches encouraging followers to refrain from dairy products, fish and other meats.

== Archaeology ==

The location of Nineveh was known, to some, continuously through the Middle Ages. Benjamin of Tudela visited it in 1170; Petachiah of Regensburg soon after.

Carsten Niebuhr recorded its location during the 1761–1767 Danish expedition. Niebuhr wrote afterwards that &quot;I did not learn that I was at so remarkable a spot, till near the river. Then they showed me a village on a great hill, which they call Nunia, and a mosque, in which the prophet Jonah was buried. Another hill in this district is called Kalla Nunia, or the Castle of Nineveh. On that lies a village Koindsjug.&quot;

=== Excavation history ===

In 1842, the French Consul General at Mosul, Paul-Émile Botta, began to search the vast mounds that lay along the opposite bank of the river. While at Tell Kuyunjiq he had little success, the locals whom he employed in these excavations, to their great surprise, came upon the ruins of a building at the 20 km far-away mound of Khorsabad, which, on further exploration, turned out to be the royal palace of Sargon II, in which large numbers of reliefs were found and recorded, though they had been damaged by fire and were mostly too fragile to remove.

In 1847 the young British diplomat Austen Henry Layard explored the ruins. Layard did not use modern archaeological methods; his stated goal was &quot;to obtain the largest possible number of well preserved objects of art at the least possible outlay of time and money&quot;. In the Kuyunjiq mound, Layard rediscovered in 1849 the lost palace of Sennacherib with its 71 rooms and colossal bas-reliefs. He also unearthed the palace and famous library of Ashurbanipal with 22,000 cuneiform clay tablets. Most of Layard&#x27;s material was sent to the British Museum, but others were dispersed elsewhere as two large pieces which were given to Lady Charlotte Guest and eventually found their way to the Metropolitan Museum. The study of the archaeology of Nineveh reveals the wealth and glory of ancient Assyria under kings such as Esarhaddon (681–669 BC) and Ashurbanipal (669–626 BC).

The work of exploration was carried on by Hormuzd Rassam (an Assyrian), George Smith and others, and a vast treasury of specimens of Assyria was incrementally exhumed for European museums. Palace after palace was discovered, with their decorations and their sculptured slabs, revealing the life and manners of this ancient people, their arts of war and peace, the forms of their religion, the style of their architecture, and the magnificence of their monarchs.

The mound of Kuyunjiq was excavated again by the archaeologists of the British Museum, led by Leonard William King, at the beginning of the 20th century. Their efforts concentrated on the site of the Temple of Nabu, the god of writing, where another cuneiform library was supposed to exist. However, no such library was ever found: most likely, it had been destroyed by the activities of later residents.

The excavations started again in 1927, under the direction of Campbell Thompson, who had taken part in King&#x27;s expeditions. Some works were carried out outside Kuyunjiq, for instance on the mound of Tell Nebi Yunus, which was the ancient arsenal of Nineveh, or along the outside walls. Here, near the northwestern corner of the walls, beyond the pavement of a later building, the archaeologists found almost 300 fragments of prisms recording the royal annals of Sennacherib, Esarhaddon, and Ashurbanipal, beside a prism of Esarhaddon which was almost perfect.

After the Second World War, several excavations were carried out by Iraqi archaeologists. From 1951 to 1958, Mohammed Ali Mustafa worked the site. The work was continued from 1967 through 1971 by Tariq Madhloom. Some additional excavation occurred by Manhal Jabur from the early 1970s to 1987. For the most part, these digs focused on Tell Nebi Yunus.

The British archaeologist and Assyriologist Professor David Stronach of the University of California, Berkeley conducted a series of surveys and digs at the site from 1987 to 1990, focusing his attentions on the several gates and the existent mudbrick walls, as well as the system that supplied water to the city in times of siege. The excavation reports are in progress.

After Mosul’s liberation from the control of the Islamic State (IS), , University of Heidelberg, established a rescue project in 2018, exploring and documenting the intrusive IS tunnels in the Assyrian Military Palace that is located below the destroyed Mosque of the prophet Jonah on Tell Nebi Yunus. Archaeological excavations have been conducted since 2019. Subsequently, an extensive research project, currently under the direction of Stefan M. Maul, University of Heidelberg, developed, focusing also on other areas of Nineveh. At Tell Kuyunjiq, activities started in 2021 with rescue and restoration measures for the destroyed reliefs in the throne room wing of the Southwest Palace. Excavations in the North Palace commenced in 2022. Since 2023, work has also been conducted at the Nergal Gate, which was bulldozed by IS. In the lower town, geophysical surveys were carried out north of Kuyunjiq in 2021 and 2023 in preparation of future research on residential areas.

=== Archaeological remains ===

Today, Nineveh&#x27;s location is marked by two large mounds, Tell Kuyunjiq and Tell &quot;Nabī Yūnus&quot; &quot;Prophet Jonah&quot;, and the remains of the city walls (about in circumference). The Neo-Assyrian levels of Kuyunjiq have been extensively explored. The other mound, &quot;Nabī Yūnus&quot;, has not been as extensively explored because there was an Arab Muslim shrine dedicated to that prophet on the site. On July 24, 2014, the Islamic State destroyed the shrine as part of a campaign to destroy religious sanctuaries it deemed &quot;un-Islamic&quot;, but also to loot that site through tunneling.

The ruin mound of Kuyunjiq rises about above the surrounding plain of the ancient city. It is quite broad, measuring about . Its upper layers have been extensively excavated, and several Neo-Assyrian palaces and temples have been found there. A deep sounding by Max Mallowan revealed evidence of habitation as early as the 6th millennium BC. Today, there is little evidence of these old excavations other than weathered pits and earth piles. In 1990, the only Assyrian remains visible were those of the entry court and the first few chambers of the Palace of Sennacherib. Since that time, the palace chambers have received significant damage by looters. Portions of relief sculptures that were in the palace chambers in 1990 were seen on the antiquities market by 1996. Photographs of the chambers made in 2003 show that many of the fine relief sculptures there have been reduced to piles of rubble.

Tell Nebi Yunus is located about south of Kuyunjiq and is the secondary ruin mound at Nineveh. On the basis of texts of Sennacherib, the site has traditionally been identified as the &quot;armory&quot; of Nineveh, and a gate and pavements excavated by Iraqis in 1954 have been considered to be part of the &quot;armory&quot; complex. Excavations in 1990 revealed a monumental entryway consisting of a number of large inscribed orthostats and &quot;bull-man&quot; sculptures, some apparently unfinished.

Following the liberation of Mosul, the tunnels under Tell Nebi Yunus were explored in 2018, in which a 3000-year-old palace was discovered, including a pair of reliefs, each showing a row of women, along with reliefs of &quot;lamassu&quot;.

This library or store of clay tablets was found in the royal palace complex in Nineveh; it contained thousands of tablets inscribed with cuneiform text.

==== City wall and gates ====


The ruins of Nineveh are surrounded by the remains of a massive stone and mudbrick wall dating from about 700 BC. About 12 km in length, the wall system consisted of an ashlar stone retaining wall about high surmounted by a mudbrick wall about high and thick. The stone retaining wall had projecting stone towers spaced about every . The stone wall and towers were topped by three-step merlons.

Five of the gateways have been explored to some extent by archaeologists:
* Mashki Gate &quot;Masqi Gate&quot; (Arabic: بوابة مسقي Derived from the passive participle of سَقَى saqā, &quot;to give (sb) a drink, to water, to irrigate&quot;) was perhaps used to take livestock to water from the Tigris which currently flows about to the west. It has been reconstructed in fortified mudbrick to the height of the top of the vaulted passageway. The Assyrian original may have been plastered and ornamented. It was bulldozed along with the Nergal and Adad Gates during IS occupation. During the restoration project, seven damaged alabaster carvings from the time of Sennacherib were found at the gate in 2022.
* Nergal Gate: Named for the god Nergal, it may have been used for some ceremonial purpose, as it is the only known gate flanked by stone sculptures of winged bull-men (&quot;lamassu&quot;). The reconstruction is conjectural, as the gate was excavated by Layard in the mid-19th century and reconstructed in the mid-20th century. The lamassu on this gate were defaced with a jackhammer by IS forces and the gate was utterly destroyed.
* Adad Gate: Named for the god Adad. A roofing above it was begun in the late 1960s by Iraqis but was not completed. The result was a mixture of concrete and eroding mudbrick, which nonetheless does give some idea of the original structure. The excavator left some features unexcavated, allowing a view of the original Assyrian construction. The original brickwork of the outer vaulted passageway was well exposed, as was the entrance of the vaulted stairway to the upper levels. The actions of Nineveh&#x27;s last defenders could be seen in the hastily built mudbrick construction which narrowed the passageway from . Around April 13, 2016, IS demolished both the gate and the adjacent wall by flattening them with a bulldozer. It has been restored by the Iraqi-Italian expedition.
* Shamash Gate: Named for the sun god Shamash, it opens to the road to Erbil. It was excavated by Layard in the 19th century. The stone retaining wall and part of the mudbrick structure were reconstructed in the 1960s. The mudbrick reconstruction has deteriorated significantly. The stone wall projects outward about from the line of main wall for a width of about . It is the only gate with such a significant projection. The mound of its remains towers above the surrounding terrain. Its size and design suggest it was the most important gate in Neo-Assyrian times.
* Halzi Gate: Near the south end of the eastern city wall. Exploratory excavations were undertaken here by the University of California, Berkeley expedition of 1989–1990 and again in 2022 by the Iraqi-Italian Expedition. There is an outward projection of the city wall, though not as pronounced as at the Shamash Gate. The entry passage had been narrowed with mudbrick to about as at the Adad Gate. Human remains from the final battle of Nineveh were found in the passageway. Located in the eastern wall, it is the southernmost and largest of all the remaining gates of ancient Nineveh.
* Besides the possible Sin Gate at the north-west end of the site, a new gate has been discovered in 2021 to the north of the Shamash Gate and south of the Khosr river (in the area labeled as N by the Iraqi-Italian expedition).

== Threats to the site ==
By 2003, the site of Nineveh was exposed to decay of its reliefs by a lack of proper protective roofing, vandalism and looting holes dug into chamber floors. Future preservation is further compromised by the site&#x27;s proximity to expanding suburbs.

The ailing Mosul Dam is a persistent threat to Nineveh as well as the city of Mosul. This is in no small part due to years of disrepair (in 2006, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers cited it as the most dangerous dam in the world), the cancellation of a second dam project in the 1980s to act as flood relief in case of failure, and occupation by ISIL in 2014 resulting in fleeing workers and stolen equipment. If the dam fails, the entire site could be under as much as 45 feet (14 m) of water.

In an October 2010 report titled &quot;Saving Our Vanishing Heritage&quot;, Global Heritage Fund named Nineveh one of 12 sites most &quot;on the verge&quot; of irreparable destruction and loss, citing insufficient management, development pressures and looting as primary causes.

By far, the greatest threat to Nineveh has been purposeful human actions by ISIL, which first occupied the area in 2014. In early 2015, they announced their intention to destroy the walls of Nineveh if the Iraqis tried to liberate the city. They also threatened to destroy artifacts and the destruction of archaeological heritage. On February 26, video footage showing ISIL destroying the smashing of statues and artifacts at the Mosul Museum and are believed to have plundered others to sell overseas. The items were mostly from the Assyrian exhibit, which Daesh declared blasphemous and idolatrous. There were 300 items remaining in the museum out of a total of 1,900, with the other 1,600 being taken to the National Museum of Iraq in Baghdad for security reasons prior to the 2014 Fall of Mosul. Some of the artifacts sold and/or destroyed were from Nineveh. Just a few days after the destruction of the museum pieces, Daesh terrorists demolished parts of three other major UNESCO world heritage sites, Khorsabad, Nimrud and Hatra. In 2016, Daesh effectively destroyed the Adad Gate (along with the adjoining northern city walls), as well as the Mashki Gate (along with the eastern fortifications) (the Mashki Gate is in the process of being restored)). Daesh also called for intensive new housing in the Kuyunjiq part and opened a large road across the southern part of the site (currently known as Al Asady Road).

After the cultural destruction and between 2014-2020, international efforts by archeologists began recording, evaluating and monitoring the damage and destruction inflicted on sensitive archaeological contexts in Nineveh, using satellite-based remote sensing. The results found that a few high-profile acts of deliberate vandalism were accompanied by much more extensive damage caused by construction and rubbish dumping extending across substantial parts of the site.

== Rogation of the Ninevites (Nineveh&#x27;s Wish) ==
Assyrians of the Ancient Church of the East, Chaldean Catholic Church, Syriac Catholic Church, Syriac Orthodox Church, Assyrian Church of the East and Saint Thomas Christians of the Syro-Malabar Church observe a fast called &quot;Ba&#x27;uta d-Ninwe&quot; (ܒܥܘܬܐ ܕܢܝܢܘܐ) which means &quot;Nineveh&#x27;s Prayer&quot;. Copts and Ethiopian Orthodox also maintain this fast.

== In popular culture ==
English Romantic poet Edwin Atherstone wrote an epic titled &quot;The Fall of Nineveh&quot;. The work tells of an uprising against king Sardanapalus by all the nations that were dominated by the Assyrian Empire. He is a great criminal who had one hundred prisoners of war executed. After a long struggle, the town is conquered by Median and Babylonian troops, led by prince Arbaces and priest Belesis. The king then sets his own palace on fire and dies inside together with all his concubines.

Atherstone&#x27;s friend, artist John Martin, created a painting of the same name inspired by the poem. English poet John Masefield&#x27;s well-known, fanciful 1903 poem &quot;Cargoes&quot; mentions Nineveh in its first line. Nineveh is also mentioned in Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s 1897 poem &quot;Recessional&quot; and Arthur O&#x27;Shaughnessy&#x27;s 1873 poem &quot;Ode&quot;.

The 1962 Italian peplum film &quot;War Gods of Babylon&quot; is based on the sacking and fall of Nineveh by the combined rebel armies led by the Babylonians.

In &quot;&quot;, Jonah, much like his biblical counterpart, must travel to Nineveh due to God&#x27;s demands.

The Wright/Forrest/Borodin Broadway hit musical &quot;Kismet&quot; contains a rousing song &quot;Not Since Niniveh&quot;, sung by Dolores Gray in the movie version. 

In the 1973 film &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, Father Lankester Merrin was on an archeological dig near Nineveh before returning to the United States and leading the exorcism of Regan MacNeil.

In the &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; universe, Ollanius Persson was supposedly born in Nineveh in 15,000 BCE, making him the oldest of the Perpetuals.

Nineveh, one of the antagonists from the video game &quot;Zenless Zone Zero&quot;, is named after this city.

<doc id="21702" wikidata="Q430776" url="?curid=21702" title="Nazareth">
<text>Nazareth is the largest city in the Northern District of Israel. In its population was . Known as &quot;the Arab capital of Israel&quot;, Nazareth serves as a cultural, political, religious, economic and commercial center for the Arab citizens of Israel. The inhabitants are predominantly Arab citizens of Israel, of whom 69% are Muslim and 31% Christian. The city also commands immense religious significance, deriving from its status as the hometown of Jesus, the central figure of Christianity and a prophet in Islam and Baha&#x27;i&#x27;sm.

Findings unearthed in the neighboring Qafzeh Cave show that the area around Nazareth was populated in the prehistoric period. Nazareth was a Jewish village during the Roman and Byzantine periods and is described in the New Testament as the childhood home of Jesus. It became an important city during the Crusades after Tancred established it as the capital of the Principality of Galilee. The city declined under Mamluk rule, and following the Ottoman conquest, the city&#x27;s Christian residents were expelled, only to return once Fakhr ad-Dīn II granted them permission to do so. In the 18th century, Zahir al-Umar transformed Nazareth into a large town by encouraging immigration to it. The city grew steadily during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when European powers invested in the construction of churches, monasteries, educational and health facilities.

Since late antiquity, Nazareth has been a center of Christian pilgrimage, with many shrines commemorating biblical events. The Church of the Annunciation is considered one of the largest Christian sites of worship in the Middle East. It contains the Grotto of the Annunciation, where, according to Catholic tradition, angel Gabriel appeared to Mary and announced that she would conceive and bear Jesus. According to Greek Orthodox belief, the same event took place at the Greek Orthodox Church of the Annunciation, also known as Church of Saint Gabriel. Other important churches in Nazareth include the Synagogue Church, St. Joseph&#x27;s Church, the Mensa Christi Church, and the Basilica of Jesus the Adolescent.

==Etymology==

===Hebrew ===
One view holds that the name &#x27;Nazareth&#x27; is derived from one of the Hebrew words for &#x27;branch&#x27;, namely , , and alludes to the prophetic, messianic words in Book of Isaiah 11:1: &quot;from (Jesse&#x27;s) roots a Branch [] will bear fruit&quot;. One view suggests this toponym might be an example of a tribal name used by resettling groups on their return from exile. Alternatively, the name may derive from the verb , , &#x27;watch, guard, keep&quot;, and understood either in the sense of &#x27;watchtower&#x27; or &#x27;guard place&#x27;, implying the early town was perched on or near the brow of the hill, or, in the passive sense as &#x27;preserved, protected&#x27; in reference to its secluded position. The negative references to Nazareth in the Gospel of John suggest that ancient Jews did not connect the town&#x27;s name to prophecy.

===Greek ===
Another theory holds that the Greek form (), used in the Gospel of Matthew and Gospel of Luke, may derive from an earlier Aramaic form of the name, or from another Semitic language form. If there were a &quot;tsade&quot; (צ) in the original Semitic form, as in the later Hebrew forms, it would normally have been transcribed in Greek with a &quot;sigma&quot; (σ) instead of a &quot;zeta&quot; (ζ). This has led some scholars to question whether &quot;Nazareth&quot; and its cognates in the New Testament actually refer to the settlement known traditionally as Nazareth in Lower Galilee. Such linguistic discrepancies may be explained, however, by &quot;a peculiarity of the &#x27;Palestinian&#x27; Aramaic dialect wherein a sade (ṣ) between two voiced (sonant) consonants tended to be partially assimilated by taking on a zayin (z) sound&quot;.

===Arabic ===
The Arabic name for Nazareth is , and Jesus () is also called , reflecting the Arab tradition of according people an attribution, a name denoting whence a person comes in either geographical or tribal terms. In the Qur&#x27;an, Christians are referred to as , meaning &quot;followers of &quot;, or &quot;those who follow Jesus of Nazareth&quot;.

==New Testament references==
In the Gospel of Luke, Nazareth is first described as &quot;a town of Galilee&quot; and home of Mary. Following the birth and early epiphanial events of chapter 2 of Luke, Mary, Joseph and Jesus &quot;returned to Galilee, to their own city, Nazareth&quot;.

The phrase &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; appears seventeen times in English translations of the New Testament, whereas the Greek original contains the form &quot;Jesus the &quot; or &quot;Jesus the .&quot; One plausible view is that () is a normal Greek adaptation of a reconstructed, hypothetical term in Jewish Aramaic for the word later used in Rabbinical sources to refer to Jesus. &quot;Nazaréth&quot; is named twelve times in surviving Greek manuscript versions of the New Testament, 10 times as or , and twice as . The former two may retain the &#x27;feminine&#x27; endings common in Galilean toponyms. The minor variants, and are also attested. () might be the earliest form of the name in Greek, going back to the putative Q document. It is found in Matthew 4:13 and Luke 4:16. However, the Textus Receptus clearly translates all passages as , leaving little room for debate there.

Many scholars have questioned a link between &quot;Nazareth&quot; and the terms &quot;Nazarene&quot; and &quot;Nazoraean&quot; on linguistic grounds, while some affirm the possibility of etymological relation &quot;given the idiosyncrasies of Galilean Aramaic.&quot;

==Extrabiblical references==

The form &quot;Nazara&quot; is also found in the earliest non-scriptural reference to the town, a citation by Sextus Julius Africanus dated about AD 221 (see &quot;Middle Roman to Byzantine Periods&quot; below). The Church Father Origen (c. AD 185 to 254) knows the forms &quot;Nazará&quot; and &quot;Nazarét&quot;. Later, Eusebius in his &quot;Onomasticon&quot; (translated by St. Jerome) also refers to the settlement as &quot;Nazara&quot;. The &quot;nașirutha&quot; of the scriptures of the Mandeans refers to &quot;priestly craft&quot;, not to Nazareth, which they identified with Qom.

The first non-Christian reference to Nazareth is an inscription on a marble fragment from a synagogue found in Caesarea Maritima in 1962. This fragment gives the town&#x27;s name in Hebrew as נצרת (n-ṣ-r-t). The inscription dates to c. AD 300 and chronicles the assignment of priests that took place at some time after the Bar Kokhba revolt, AD 132–35. (See &quot;Middle Roman to Byzantine Periods&quot; below.) An 8th-century AD Hebrew inscription, which was the earliest known Hebrew reference to Nazareth prior to the discovery of the inscription above, uses the same form.

===Nazarenes, Nasranis, &quot;Notzrim&quot;, Christians===

Around 331, Eusebius records that, from the name Nazareth, Christ was called a Nazoraean, and that, in earlier centuries, Christians were once called Nazarenes. Tertullian (Against Marcion 4:8) records that &quot;for this reason the Jews call us &#x27;Nazarenes&#x27;.&quot; In the New Testament Christians are called &quot;Christians&quot; three times (in Acts 11:26; 26:28; and 1 Peter 4:16), but never directly by the Apostle Paul. They are called &quot;Nazarenes&quot; once by Tertullus, a Jewish lawyer. The Rabbinic and modern Hebrew name for Christians, &quot;notzrim&quot;, is also thought to derive from Nazareth, and be connected with Tertullus&#x27; charge against Paul of being a member of the sect of the Nazarenes, &quot;Nazoraioi&quot;, &quot;men of Nazareth&quot; in Acts. Against this, some medieval Jewish polemical texts connect &quot;notzrim&quot; with the &quot;netsarim&quot; &quot;watchmen&quot; of Ephraim in Jeremiah 31:6. In Syriac Aramaic &quot;Nasrath&quot; (ܢܨܪܬ) is used for Nazareth, while &quot;Nazarenes&quot; (Acts 24:5) and &quot;of Nazareth&quot; are both &quot;Nasrani&quot; or &quot;Nasraya&quot; (ܕܢܨܪܝܐ) an adjectival form. &quot;Nasrani&quot; is used in the Quran for Christians, and in Modern Standard Arabic may refer more widely to Western people. Saint Thomas Christians, an ancient community of Jewish Christians in India who trace their origins to evangelistic activity of Thomas the Apostle in the 1st century, are sometimes known by the name &quot;Nasrani&quot; even today.

==History==
===Stone Age===
Archaeological researchers have revealed that a funerary and cult center at Kfar HaHoresh, about two miles () from current Nazareth, dates back roughly 9,000 years to the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B era. The remains of some 65 individuals were found, buried under huge horizontal headstone structures, some of which consisted of up to 3 tons of locally produced white plaster. Decorated human skulls uncovered there have led archaeologists to identify Kfar HaHoresh as a major cult centre in that era.

===Bronze and Iron Age===
The Franciscan priest Bellarmino Bagatti, &quot;Director of Christian Archaeology&quot;, carried out extensive excavation of this &quot;Venerated Area&quot; from 1955 to 1965. Fr. Bagatti uncovered pottery dating from the Middle Bronze Age (2200 to 1500 BC) and ceramics, silos and grinding mills from the Iron Age (1500 to 586 BC) which indicated substantial settlement in the Nazareth basin at that time.

===Roman period===

Archaeological evidence shows that Nazareth was occupied during the late Hellenistic period, through the Roman period and into the Byzantine period.

According to the Gospel of Luke, Nazareth was the home village of Mary as well as the site of the Annunciation (when the angel Gabriel informed Mary that she would give birth to Jesus). According to the Gospel of Matthew, Joseph and Mary resettled in Nazareth after returning from the flight from Bethlehem to Egypt. According to the Bible, Jesus grew up in Nazareth from some point in his childhood. However, some modern scholars also regard Nazareth as the birthplace of the historical Jesus.

A Hebrew inscription found in Caesarea dating to the late 3rd or early 4th century mentions Nazareth as the home of the priestly Hapizzez/Hafizaz family after the Bar Kokhba revolt (AD 132–135). From the three fragments that have been found, the inscription seems to be a list of the twenty-four priestly courses, with each course (or family) assigned its proper order and the name of each town or village in Galilee where it settled. Nazareth is not spelled with the &quot;z&quot; sound but with the Hebrew tsade (thus &quot;Nasareth&quot; or &quot;Natsareth&quot;). Eleazar Kalir (a Hebrew Galilean poet variously dated from the 6th to 10th century) mentions a locality clearly in the Nazareth region bearing the name Nazareth נצרת (in this case vocalized &quot;Nitzrat&quot;), which was home to the descendants of the 18th Kohen family Happitzetz (הפצץ), for at least several centuries after the Bar Kochva revolt.

Although it is mentioned in the New Testament gospels, there are no extant non-biblical references to Nazareth until around AD 200, when Sextus Julius Africanus, cited by Eusebius (&quot;Church History&quot; 1.7.14), speaks of Nazara as a village in Judea and locates it near Cochaba (modern-day Kaukab). In the same passage Africanus writes of &quot;desposunoi&quot; – relatives of Jesus – who he claims &quot;kept the records of their descent with great care&quot;. Ken Dark describes the view that Nazareth did not exist in Jesus&#x27;s time as &quot;archaeologically unsupportable&quot;.
James F. Strange, Professor of Religious Studies at the University of South Florida, notes: &quot;Nazareth is not mentioned in ancient Jewish sources earlier than the third century AD. This likely reflects its lack of prominence both in Galilee and in Judaea.&quot; Strange originally calculated the population of Nazareth at the time of Christ as &quot;roughly 1,600 to 2,000 people&quot; but, in a subsequent publication that followed more than a decade of additional research, revised this figure down to &quot;a maximum of about 480.&quot; In 2009, Israeli archaeologist Yardenna Alexandre excavated archaeological remains in Nazareth that date to the time of Jesus in the early Roman period. Alexandre told reporters, &quot;The discovery is of the utmost importance since it reveals for the very first time a house from the Jewish village of Nazareth.&quot;

Other sources state that during Jesus&#x27; time, Nazareth had a population of 400 and one public bath, which was important for civic and religious purposes, as a &quot;mikva&quot;.
A tablet at the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris, dating to AD 50, was sent from Nazareth to Paris in 1878. It contains an inscription known as the &quot;Ordinance of Caesar&quot; that outlines the penalty of death for those who violate tombs or graves. However, it is suspected that this inscription came to Nazareth from somewhere else (possibly Sepphoris). Bagatti writes: &quot;we are not certain that it was found in Nazareth, even though it came from Nazareth to Paris. At Nazareth there lived various vendors of antiquities who got ancient material from several places.&quot; C. Kopp is more definite: &quot;It must be accepted with certainty that [the Ordinance of Caesar]... was brought to the Nazareth market by outside merchants.&quot; Princeton University archaeologist Jack Finnegan describes additional archaeological evidence related to settlement in the Nazareth basin during the Bronze and Iron Ages, and states that &quot;Nazareth was a strongly Jewish settlement in the Roman period.&quot;

In 2020, Yardenna Alexandre confirmed that Jews from Judea migrated to Galilee and settled in new villages and settlements, including Nazareth, since the late Hellenistic-Hasmonean period (). Under the leadership of priestly families, the Jewish inhabitants observed ritual purity laws. Previously, most of Galiee, except for minor short-lived Israelite settlements in the Naḥal Ẓippori basin, had an occupational gap for about 5 centuries because of the Assyrian conquest in 732 BCE. However, there is strong evidence for Assyrian presence in Galilee, based on artefacts in Cana, which was north of Nazareth. Konrad Schmid and Jens Schroter note that Assyrians were typically relocated to conquered territories, which most likely included Israel.

Some scholars believed Jesus, a native of Nazareth, was influenced by Cynicism, which was popular in Hellenized Galilean cities such as Gadara.

===Byzantine period===
Epiphanius in his &quot;Panarion&quot; () numbers Nazareth among the cities devoid of a non-Jewish population. Epiphanius, writing of Joseph of Tiberias, a wealthy Roman Jew who converted to Christianity in the time of Constantine, says he claimed to have received an imperial rescript to build Christian churches in Jewish towns and villages where no gentiles or Samaritans dwell, naming Tiberias, Diocaesarea, Sepphoris, Nazareth and Capernaum. From this scarce notice, it has been concluded that a small church which encompassed a cave complex might have been located in Nazareth in the early 4th century&quot;, although the town was Jewish until the 7th century.

The Christian monk and Bible translator Jerome, writing at the beginning of the 5th century, says Nazareth was a &quot;viculus&quot; or mere village.

In the 6th century, religious narrations from local Christians about the Virgin Mary began to spark interest in the site among pilgrims, who founded the first church at the location of the current Greek Orthodox Church of the Annunciation at the site of a freshwater spring, today known as Mary&#x27;s Well. Around 570, the Anonymous of Piacenza reports travelling from Sepphoris to Nazareth. There he records seeing in the Jewish synagogue the books from which Jesus learnt his letters, and a bench where he sat. According to him, Christians could lift it, but Jews could not, since it disallowed them from dragging it outside. Writing of the beauty of the Hebrew women there, he records them saying St. Mary was a relative of theirs, and notes that, &quot;The house of St. Mary is a basilica.&quot; Constantine the Great ordered that churches be built in Jewish cities, and Nazareth was one of the places designated for this purpose, although construction of churches apparently only started decades after Constantine&#x27;s death, i.e. after 352.

Archaeologists have unearthed evidence that previous to the erection of the Byzantine-period church at the site of Mary&#x27;s house in the mid-5th century, Judeo-Christians had built there a synagogue-church, leaving behind Judeo-Christian symbols. Until being expelled in c. 630, Jews probably kept on using their older synagogue, while the Judeo-Christian needed to build their own, probably at the site of Mary&#x27;s house.

The Jewish town profited from the Christian pilgrim trade which began in the 4th century AD, but latent anti-Christian hostility broke out in AD 614 when the Persians invaded Palestine. The Christian Byzantine author Eutychius claimed that Jewish people of Nazareth helped the Persians carry out their slaughter of the Christians. When the Byzantine or Eastern Roman emperor Heraclius ejected the Persians in AD 629–630, he expelled the Jews from the village, turning it all-Christian.

===Early Muslim period===
The Arab Muslim invasion of AD 638 had no immediate impact on the Christians of Nazareth and their churches, since Bishop Arculf remembered seeing there around 670 two churches, one at the house of Joseph where Jesus had lived as a child, and one at the house of Mary where she received the Annunciation – but no synagogue, which had possibly been transformed into a mosque. The 721 iconoclastic edict of Caliph Yazid II apparently led to the destruction of the former church, so that Willibald found during his pilgrimage in 724–26 only one church there, the one dedicated to St. Mary, which Christians had to save through repeated payments from destruction by the &quot;pagan Saracens&quot; (Muslim Arabs). The ruins of St. Joseph&#x27;s remained untouched for a very long time, while the Church St. Mary is repeatedly mentioned throughout the following centuries, including by an Arab geographer in 943.

===Crusader period===

In 1099, the Crusader Tancred captured Galilee and established his capital in Nazareth. He was the ruler of the Principality of Galilee, which was established, at least in name, in 1099, as a vassal of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Later, in 1115, Nazareth was created as a seigneury within the principality. A Martin of Nazareth, who probably acted as viscount of Nazareth, is documented in 1115 and in 1130/1131. Nazareth was the original site of the Latin Patriarch, also established by Tancred. The ancient diocese of Scythopolis was relocated under the Archbishop of Nazareth, as one of the four archdioceses in the Kingdom of Jerusalem. When the town returned to Muslim control in 1187 following the victory of Saladin in the Battle of Hattin, the remaining Crusaders and European clergy were forced to leave town. Frederick II managed to negotiate safe passage for pilgrims from Acre in 1229, and in 1251, Louis IX, the king of France, attended mass in the grotto, accompanied by his wife.

===Mamluk period===
In 1263, Baybars, the Mamluk Sultan, destroyed the Christian buildings in Nazareth and declared the site off-limits to Latin clergy, as part of his bid to drive out the remaining Crusaders from Palestine. While Arab Christian families continued to live in Nazareth, its status was reduced to that of a poor village. Pilgrims who visited the site in 1294 reported only a small church protecting the grotto. In the 14th century, Franciscan friars were permitted to return and live within the ruins of the basilica.

===Ottoman period===


In 1584 the Franciscan friars were evicted again from the site of the ruined basilica. In 1620, Fakhr-al-Din II, a Druze emir who controlled this part of Ottoman Syria, permitted them to build a small church at the Grotto of the Annunciation. Pilgrimage tours to surrounding sacred sites were organised by the Franciscans, but the monks suffered harassment from surrounding Bedouin tribes who often kidnapped them for ransom.

Stability returned with the rule of Zahir al-Umar, a powerful Arab sheikh who ruled the Galilee, and later much of the Levantine coast and Palestine. He transformed Nazareth from a minor village into a large town by encouraging immigration to it. Nazareth played a strategic role in Zahir&#x27;s sheikhdom because it allowed him to wield control over the agricultural areas of central Galilee. He ensured Nazareth&#x27;s security for other reasons as well, among them strengthening ties with France by protecting the Christian community and protecting one of his wives who resided in Nazareth.

Zahir authorized the Franciscans to build a church in 1730. That structure stood until 1955, when it was demolished to make way for a larger building completed in 1967. He also permitted the Franciscans to purchase the Synagogue Church in 1741 and authorized the Greek Orthodox community to build St. Gabriel&#x27;s Church in 1767. Zahir commissioned the construction of a government house known as the Seraya, which served as the city&#x27;s municipal headquarters until 1991. His descendants—known as the &quot;Dhawahri&quot;—along with the Zu&#x27;bi, Fahum, and &#x27;Onassah families later constituted Nazareth&#x27;s traditional Muslim elite.

Nazareth&#x27;s Christian community did not fare well under Zahir&#x27;s Ottoman successor, Jazzar Pasha (r. 1776–1804), and friction increased between its Christians and Muslim peasants from the surrounding villages. Nazareth was temporarily captured by the troops of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1799, during his Syrian campaign. Napoleon visited the holy sites and considered appointing his general Jean-Andoche Junot as the duke of Nazareth. During the rule of Governor Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt (1830–1840) over much of Ottoman Syria, Nazareth was opened to European missionaries and traders. After the Ottomans regained control, European money continued to flow into Nazareth and new institutions were established. The Christians of Nazareth were protected during the massacres of 1860 by Aqil Agha, the Bedouin leader who exercised control over the Galilee between 1845 and 1870.

Kaloost Vartan, an Armenian from Istanbul, arrived in 1864 and established the first medical mission in Nazareth, the Scottish &quot;hospital on the hill&quot;, or the Nazareth Hospital as it is known today, with sponsorship from the Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society. The Ottoman Sultan, who favored the French, allowed them to establish an orphanage, the Society of Saint Francis de Sale. By the late 19th century, Nazareth was a town with a strong Arab Christian presence and a growing European community, where a number of communal projects were undertaken and new religious buildings were erected. In 1871 Christ Church, the city&#x27;s only Anglican church, was completed under the leadership of the Rev John Zeller and consecrated by Bishop Samuel Gobat.

In the late 19th century and the first years of the 20th century, Nazareth prospered as it served the role of a market center for the dozens of rural Arab villages located within its vicinity. Local peasants would purchase supplies from Nazareth&#x27;s many &quot;souks&quot; (open-air markets), which included separate &quot;souks&quot; for agricultural produce, metalwork, jewelry and leathers. In 1914, Nazareth consisted of eight quarters: &#x27;Araq, Farah, Jami&#x27;, Khanuq, Maidan, Mazazwa, Sharqiya and Shufani. There were nine churches, two monasteries, four convents, two mosques, four hospitals, four private schools, a public school, a police station, three orphanages, a hotel, three inns, a flour mill and eight &quot;souks&quot;. The Ottomans lost control of Palestine, including Nazareth, to the Allied Powers during World War I. By then, Nazareth&#x27;s importance had declined significantly as most of the Arab villages in the Jezreel Valley had been replaced by newly established Jewish communities.

===British Mandate period===

The United Kingdom gained control of Palestine in 1917, the same year of the Balfour Declaration, which promised British support for the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. In the years preceding and following the declaration, Jewish immigration to Palestine had been increasing. Representatives of Nazareth opposed the Zionist movement, sending a delegation to the 1919 First Palestine Arab Congress and issuing a letter of protest in 1920 that condemned the movement while also proclaiming solidarity with the Jews of Palestine. Politically, Nazareth was becoming further involved in the growing Palestinian nationalist movement. In 1922, a Muslim-Christian Association was established in the town, largely sponsored by the Muslim al-Zu&#x27;bi family. A consistent and effective united Palestinian Arab religious front proved difficult to establish and alternative organizations such as the Supreme Muslim Council&#x27;s Organization of Muslim Youth and the National Muslim Association were established in Nazareth later in the 1920s. In 1922 there were 4885 Christians, 2486 Muslims and 58 Jews living in Nazareth. Nazareth was relatively slow to modernize. While other towns already had wired electricity, Nazareth delayed its electrification until the 1930s and invested instead in improving its water supply system. This included adding two reservoirs at the northwestern hills and several new cisterns. By 1930, a church for the Baptist denomination, a municipal garden at Mary&#x27;s Well and a police station based in Zahir al-Umar&#x27;s Seraya had been established and the Muslim Sharqiya Quarter had expanded.

In the 1936–1939 Arab Revolt, Nazareth played a minor role, contributing two rebel commanders out of 281 rebel commanders active in the country. The two were Nazareth native and Christian Fu&#x27;ad Nassar and Nazareth resident and Indur native Tawfiq al-Ibrahim. The nearby villages of Saffuriya and al-Mujaydil played a more active military role, contributing nine commanders between them. The leaders of the revolt sought to use Nazareth as a staging ground to protest the British proposal to include the Galilee into a future Jewish state. On 26 September 1937, the British district commissioner of the Galilee, Lewis Yelland Andrews, was assassinated in Nazareth by local rebels.

By 1946, the municipal boundary of Nazareth had been enlarged and new neighborhoods, namely Maidan, Maslakh, Khanuq and Nimsawi, were established. New homes were established in existing quarters and the town still had an abundance of orchards and agricultural fields. Two cigarette factories, a tobacco store, two cinemas and a tile factory had been established, significantly boosting Nazareth&#x27;s economy. A new police station was built on Nazareth&#x27;s southernmost hill, while the police station in the Seray had been converted into Nazareth&#x27;s municipal headquarters. Watchtowers were also erected on some of the hilltops around the town. Other new or expanded government offices included a headquarters for the district commissioner at the former Ottoman military barracks, and offices for the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Survey and Settlement.

Nazareth was in the territory allotted to the Arab state under the 1947 UN Partition Plan. In the months leading up to the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the town became a refuge for Arab-Palestinians fleeing the urban centers of Tiberias, Haifa and Baysan before and during the Haganah&#x27;s capture of those cities on 18 April 22 April and 12 May 1948, respectively.

===Israeli period===

====1948 War====

Nazareth itself was not a field of battle during the 1948 War, which began on 15 May, before the first truce on 11 June, although some of the villagers had joined the loosely organized peasant military and paramilitary forces, and troops from the Arab Liberation Army (ALA) had entered Nazareth on 9 July. The local defense of the town consisted of 200–300 militiamen distributed along the hills surrounding the town. The defense in the southern and western hills collapsed after Israeli shelling, while resistance in the northern hills had to contend with an incoming Israeli armored unit. Not long after the Israelis began shelling the local militiamen, Nazareth&#x27;s police chief raised a white flag over the town&#x27;s police station.

Most of the fighting around Nazareth occurred in its satellite villages, particularly in Saffuriya, whose residents put up resistance until largely dispersing following Israeli air raids on 15 July. During the ten days of fighting which occurred between the first and second truce, Nazareth capitulated to Israeli troops during Operation Dekel on 16 July, after little more than token resistance. By then, morale among local militiamen was low and most refused to fight alongside the ALA because of their perceived weakness in the face of Israel&#x27;s perceived military superiority and the alleged maltreatment of Christian residents and clergy by ALA volunteers. Seeking to prevent the town&#x27;s destruction, the Muslim mayor of Nazareth, Yusef Fahum requested a halt to all resistance put up by Nazarenes.

The surrender of Nazareth was formalized in a written agreement, whereby the town&#x27;s leaders agreed to cease hostilities in return for promises from the Israeli officers, including brigade commander Ben Dunkelman (the leader of the operation), that no harm would come to the civilians of the town. Soon after the signing of the agreement, Dunkelman received an order from the Israeli General Chaim Laskov to forcibly evacuate the city&#x27;s Arabs. He refused, remarking that he was &#x27;shocked and horrified&#x27; that he would be commanded to renege on the agreement he, and also Chaim Laskov, had just signed. Twelve hours after defying his superior, he was relieved of his post, but not before obtaining assurances that the security of Nazareth&#x27;s population would be guaranteed. David Ben-Gurion backed Dunkelman&#x27;s judgement, fearing that expelling Christian Arabs might provoke an outcry throughout the Christian world. By the end of the war, Nazareth&#x27;s population saw a large influx of refugees from major urban centers and rural villages in the Galilee.

==== 1950s–1960s ====

In the first few years of its incorporation into Israel, Nazareth&#x27;s affairs were dominated by the issues of land expropriation, internally displaced refugees and the hardships of martial law, which included curfews and travel restrictions. Efforts to resolve these issues were largely unsuccessful and led to frustration among the inhabitants, which in turn contributed to political agitation in the city. As the largest Arab town in Israel, Nazareth became a center of Arab and Palestinian nationalism, and because the Communist Party was the sole legal political group that took up many of the local Arab causes, it gained popularity in Nazareth. Arab political organization within Nazareth and Israel was largely stymied by the state until recent decades. Arab and Palestinian nationalist sentiment continue to influence Nazareth&#x27;s political life.

In 1954, 1,200 dunams of Nazareth&#x27;s land, which had been slated for future urban expansion by the municipality, was expropriated by state authorities for the construction of government offices and, in 1957, for the construction of the Jewish town of Nazareth Illit. The latter was built as a way for the state to counterbalance the Arab majority in the region. Knesset member Seif el-Din el-Zoubi, who represented Nazareth, actively opposed the Absentees&#x27; Property Law, which allowed state expropriation of land from Arab citizens who were not permitted to return to their original villages. Zoubi argued that the internally displaced refugees were not absentees as they were still living in the country as citizens and wanted to return to their homes. Israel offered compensation to these internal refugees, but most refused for fear of permanently relinquishing their right of return. Tensions between Nazareth&#x27;s inhabitants and the state came to a head during a 1958 May Day rally where marchers demanded that refugees be allowed to return to their villages, an end to land expropriation, and self-determination for Palestinians. Several young protesters were arrested for throwing stones at security forces. Martial law ended in 1966.

On 5 January 1964, Pope Paul VI included Nazareth in the first ever papal visit to the Holy Land.

====1980s–2010s====
As of the early 1990s, no city plans drafted by Nazareth Municipality have been approved by the government (both the British Mandate and later Israel) since 1942. This has left many people in Nazareth who vote in the city&#x27;s municipal elections and receive services from its municipality effectively outside of the city&#x27;s jurisdiction. Such areas include the Sharqiya and Jabal el-Daula quarters which are in Nazareth Illit&#x27;s jurisdiction and whose residents had to acquire building permits from the latter city. Similarly, the Bilal neighborhood of the Safafra Quarter is located within Reineh&#x27;s jurisdiction. In 1993, the residents of Bilal became official residents of Reineh. Nazareth&#x27;s municipal plans for expansion prior to the establishment of Nazareth Illit, were to the north and east, areas that the latter city now occupy. Arab satellite towns are closely located to the north, west and southwest. Thus, the remaining area within the city&#x27;s municipal boundaries available for expansion were to the northwest and the south, where the topography restricted urban development. After lobbying the Knesset and the Interior Ministry, el-Zoubi was able to have areas to the northwest of the city annexed to the municipality.

In the 1980s, the government began attempts to merge the nearby village of Ilut with Nazareth, although this move was opposed by residents from both localities and the Nazareth Municipality. Ilut&#x27;s residents were included as part of Nazareth&#x27;s electorate in the 1983 and 1989 municipal elections, which Ilut&#x27;s residents largely boycotted, and in the 1988 national elections. Ilut was designated by the Interior Ministry as a separate local council in 1991. The Israeli government has designated a Nazareth metropolitan area that includes the local councils of Yafa an-Naseriyye to the south, Reineh, Mashhad and Kafr Kanna to the north, Iksal and Nazareth Illit to the east and Migdal HaEmek to the west.
As the political center of Israel&#x27;s Arab citizens, Nazareth is the scene of annual rallies held by the community including Land Day since March 1975 and May Day. There are also frequent demonstrations in support of the Palestinian cause. During the First Intifada (1987–1993), May Day marchers vocally supported the Palestinian uprising. On 22 December 1987, riots broke out during a strike held in solidarity with the Intifada. On 24 January 1988, a mass demonstration attracted between 20,000–50,000 participants from Nazareth and other Arab towns. On 13 May, during a football match in Nahariya, a riot broke out between Arab and Jewish fans, resulting in a Jewish man being stabbed and 54 people, mostly Arabs, being arrested. A rally in Nazareth on 19 May followed, in which thousands of Arabs protested against &quot;racist attacks&quot; against the Arab fans and discriminatory policies against Arabs in general.

Preparations for the Pope&#x27;s visit to Nazareth in 2000 triggered highly publicized tensions related to the Basilica of the Annunciation. In 1997, permission was granted to construct a paved plaza to handle the thousands of Christian pilgrims expected to arrive. A small group of Muslims protested and occupied the site, where a nephew of Saladin, named Shihab al-Din, is believed to be buried. A school, al-Harbyeh, had been built on the site by the Ottomans, and the Shihab-Eddin shrine, along with several shops owned by the waqf, were located there. Government approval of plans for a large mosque on the property triggered protests from Christian leaders. In 2002, a special government commission permanently halted construction of the mosque.

In March 2006, public protests followed the disruption of a prayer service by an Israeli Jew and his Christian wife and daughter, who detonated firecrackers inside the church. The family said it wanted to draw attention to their problems with the welfare authorities. In July 2006 a rocket fired by Hezbollah as part of the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict killed two children in Nazareth.

In March 2010, the Israeli government approved a $3 million plan to develop Nazareth&#x27;s tourism industry. New businesses receive start-up grants of up to 30 percent of their initial investment from the Ministry of Tourism.

==== 2020s ====
Riots broke out in Nazareth during the 2021 Israel–Palestine crisis. In September 2024, a rocket launched by Hezbollah struck the city, and fires broke elsewhere in the city.

==Geography==

Two locations for Nazareth are cited in ancient texts: the Galilean (northern) location in the Christian gospels and a southern (Judean) location mentioned in several early noncanonical texts.

Modern-day Nazareth is nestled in a natural bowl which reaches from 320 metres above sea level to the crest of the hills about 488 metres. Nazareth is about 25 kilometres from the Sea of Galilee and about 9 kilometres west from Mount Tabor. The major cities of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv are situated approximately 146 kilometres and 108 kilometres respectively, away from Nazareth. The Nazareth Range, in which the town lies, is the southernmost of several parallel east–west hill ranges that characterize the elevated tableau of Lower Galilee.
===Climate===
Nazareth has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Csa&quot;).
==Demographics==

Nazareth is the largest Arab city in Israel. In 2009, the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics reported that Nazareth&#x27;s Arab population was 69% Muslim and 31% Christian. The greater Nazareth metropolitan area had a population of 210,000, including 125,000 Arabs (59%) and 85,000 Jews (41%). It is the only urban area with over 50,000 residents in Israel where the majority of the population is Arab. The greater Nazareth metropolitan area includes Nof HaGalil, Yafa an-Naseriyye, Reineh, Migdal HaEmek, Ein Mahil, Ilut, Kafr Kanna, Mashhad and Iksal.

Nazareth is home to the largest Arab Christian community in Israel. The Christian communities of Nazareth are varied and includes various denominations, the most prominent among them the Greek Orthodox, Melkite Greek Catholic, Latin Catholics, Maronites, Armenian Orthodox, and Protestants. By far the largest among them is the Greek-Orthodox community, headed by a Patriarch based in Jerusalem, and represented in Nazareth by a Metropolite. The Christian communities in Nazareth tend to be wealthier and better educated compared to other Arabs elsewhere in Israel, and Christians of Nazareth occupy the majority of the top positions in the town: three hospitals and bank managers, judges and school principals and faculties. The socio-economic gap between the Christians wealth and Muslim poverty led sometimes to sectarian crises.

Many of the descendants of the Zayadina clan in modern-day Israel use the surname &#x27;al-Zawahirah&#x27; or &#x27;Dhawahri&#x27; in honor of Zahir (whose name is colloquially transliterated as &#x27;Dhaher&#x27;). They mostly live in the Galilee localities of Nazareth, Bi&#x27;ina, Kafr Manda, and, before its depopulation in the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, the village of Damun. &quot;Dhawahri&quot;, made up one of the important families in Muslim community of Nazareth, beside the &quot;Fahoums&quot;, the &quot;Zu&#x27;bis&quot;, and the &quot;Onallas&quot;.

===Demographic history===
During the late Ottoman era, the religious majority of the city fluctuated. In 1838, there were 325 Christian families (half of whom were Greek Orthodox, the remainder belonged to various Catholic churches) and 120 Muslim families. In 1856, the population was estimated to be 4,350, of which Muslims comprised 52%, while Christians from various denominations comprised 48%. In 1862, the population estimate was lower (3,120) and Christians formed a substantial majority of over 78%. The population grew to 5,660 in 1867 and Christians constituted roughly two-thirds and Muslims one-third of the inhabitants. These estimates during the late Ottoman era likely represented crude figures.

A population list from about 1887 showed that Nazareth had about 6,575 inhabitants; 1,620 Muslims, 2,485 Greek Catholics, 845 Catholics, 1,115 Latins, 220 Maronites and 290 Protestants.

For much of the British Mandatory period (1922–1948), Nazareth had a Christian majority (mostly Orthodox Christians) and a Muslim minority.

In 1918, Nazareth had an estimated population of 8,000, two-thirds Christian. In the 1922 British census, Nazareth&#x27;s population was recorded as 7,424 residents, of which 66% were Christian, 33% were Muslim and roughly 1% were Jewish. In the 1931 census, the population grew to 8,756 and the ratio of Muslims increased to 37%. The largest Christian community were the Greek Orthodox denomination, followed by the Roman Catholics and the Melkites. Smaller communities of Anglicans, Maronites, Syriac Catholics, Protestants and Copts also existed.

In 1946, Nazareth had a population of 15,540, of whom roughly 60% were Christians and 40% were Muslims. The 1948 War led to an exodus of Palestinians and many expelled or fleeing Muslims from villages in the Galilee and the Haifa area found refuge in Nazareth. At one point, some 20,000 mostly Muslim internally displaced persons were present in the city. Following the war&#x27;s conclusion, the internally displaced persons of Shefa-&#x27;Amr, Dabburiya, Ilut and Kafr Kanna returned to their homes. However, those Muslim and Christian internally displaced persons from the nearby destroyed villages of Ma&#x27;lul, al-Mujaydil, Saffuriya, the Haifa-area village of Balad al-Sheikh and the major cities of Acre, Haifa, Tiberias, Safad and Baysan remained as they were not able to return to their hometowns. During the war and in the following months, internally displaced persons from Saffuriya established the Safafra Quarter, named after their former village. Around 20% of Nazareth&#x27;s native inhabitants left Palestine during the war. In an Israeli army census in July 1948, Nazareth had a total population of 17,118, which consisted of 12,640 Nazarenes and 4,478 internally displaced persons. In 1951, the population was recorded as 20,300, 25% of whom were internally displaced persons. The internally displaced persons came from over two dozen villages, but most were from al-Mujaydil, Saffuriya, Tiberias, Haifa, Ma&#x27;lul and Indur.

Today, Nazareth still has a significant Christian population, made up of various denominations. The Muslim population has grown due to a number of historical factors that include the city having served as administrative center under British rule, and the influx of internally displaced Palestinian Arabs absorbed into the city from neighboring towns during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.

==Economy==

In 2011, Nazareth had over 20 Arab-owned high-tech companies, mostly in the field of software development. According to the &quot;Haaretz&quot; newspaper the city has been called the &quot;Silicon Valley of the Arab community&quot; in view of its potential in this sphere.

==Religious sites==

===Christian===

Nazareth is home to dozens of monasteries and churches, many of them in the Old City.

* The Jesus Trail pilgrimage route connects many of the religious sites in Nazareth on a walking trail which ends in Capernaum
* International Marian Evangelization Center &quot;Mary of Nazareth&quot; (see here:), containing among other things the only archaeologically excavated house from first-century AD Nazareth

===Muslim===
Muslim holy sites include
* The Shrine of al-Sheikh Amer
* The Shrine of &quot;to the Prophet we go&quot; (Makam Ela-Nabi Sa&#x27;in Mosque)
* The Shrine of Shihab ad-Din.

Muslim places of worship include
* The White Mosque (Masjid al-Abiad), the oldest mosque in Nazareth, located in &quot;Harat Alghama&quot; (&quot;Mosque Quarter&quot;) in the center of the Old Market.
* The Peace Mosque (Masjid al-Salam).

==Archaeology==
===&quot;Venerated area&quot; near the Basilica of the Annunciation===
While excavations conducted prior to 1931 in the Franciscan &quot;venerated area&quot; (the side of the hill known as Jabal Nebi Sa&#x27;in, stretching north of the Basilica of the Annunciation) revealed no trace of a Greek or Roman settlement there, later digs under Fr. Bagatti, who acted as the principal archaeologist for the venerated sites in Nazareth, unearthed quantities of later Roman and Byzantine artifacts, attesting to unambiguous human presence there from the 2nd century AD onward. John Dominic Crossan, a noted New Testament scholar, remarked that Bagatti&#x27;s archaeological drawings indicate just how small the village actually was, suggesting that it was little more than an insignificant hamlet.

===Early Roman house===
Remains of a residential house dating to the Early Roman period were discovered in 2009 next to the Basilica of the Annunciation and are on display in the &quot;International Marian Center of Nazareth&quot;. According to the Israel Antiquities Authority, &quot;The artifacts recovered from inside the building were few and mostly included fragments of pottery vessels from the Early Roman period (the first and second centuries AD)... Another hewn pit, whose entrance was apparently camouflaged, was excavated and a few pottery sherds from the Early Roman period were found inside it.&quot; Archaeologist Yardenna Alexandre adds that &quot;based on other excavations that I conducted in other villages in the region, this pit was probably hewn as part of the preparations by the Jews to protect themselves during the Great Revolt against the Romans in 67 AD&quot;.

===Kokh tombs===
Noteworthy is that all the post-Iron Age tombs in the Nazareth basin (approximately two dozen) are of the kokh (plural &quot;kokhim&quot;) or later types; this type probably first appeared in Galilee in the middle of the 1st century AD. Kokh tombs in the Nazareth area have been excavated by B. Bagatti, N. Feig, Z. Yavor, and noted by Z. Gal.

===Ancient bathhouse at Mary&#x27;s Well===
In the mid-1990s, a shopkeeper discovered tunnels under his shop near Mary&#x27;s Well in Nazareth. The tunnels were identified as the hypocaust of a bathhouse. Excavations in 1997–98 revealed remains dating from the Roman, Crusader, Mamluk and Ottoman periods.

==Education==

With the near total depopulation of the Palestinian Arabs in the major cities of Haifa and Jaffa as a result of the 1948 war, Nazareth, Kafr Yasif and Rameh became one of a few towns in the newly-established state of Israel to emerge as a central space for Arab culture and politics.

Three prestigious Arab Christian schools in Nazareth are the St. Joseph&#x27;s Eclerical School, run by the Melkite Greek Catholic Church, the Nuns of St. Joseph School, a Catholic institution, and the Nazareth Baptist High School, a Protestant institution. About half of students in Nazareth attend Christian schools (10 schools) that are found in the city. Christian schools in Nazareth are among the best schools in the country, and while those schools represent only 4% of the Arab schooling sector, about 34% of Arab university students come from Christian schools. These Arab Christian schools accommodate Christian students, Muslims, Druze from across the country.

==Sports==
The city&#x27;s main football club, Ahi Nazareth, currently plays in Liga Leumit, the second tier of Israeli football. The club spent two seasons in the top division, in 2003–04 and again in 2009–10. They are based at the Ilut Stadium in nearby Ilut. Other local clubs are Al-Nahda Nazareth, which currently plays in Liga Bet, and Beitar al-Amal Nazareth, Hapoel Bnei Nazareth and Hapoel al-Ittihad Nazareth, which all play in Liga Gimel.

==Hospitals==

The city has three hospitals, run by the Christian community of Nazareth, and serving its districts:
* The Nazareth Hospital (also called the English Hospital)
* French Nazareth Hospital
* Italian Nazareth Hospital

==Twin towns – sister cities==
Nazareth is twinned with:

* Baguio, Philippines
* Częstochowa, Poland
* Florence, Italy
* Nablus, Palestine
* Neubrandenburg, Germany
===Other cooperation===
* Loreto, Italy (the Sanctuary of the Annunciation in Nazareth and the Sanctuary of the Incarnation in Loreto are twinned)

<doc id="21703" wikidata="Q81422" url="?curid=21703" title="Noah">
<text>Noah (; ) appears as the last of the Antediluvian patriarchs in the traditions of Abrahamic religions. His story appears in the Hebrew Bible (Book of Genesis, chapters 5–9), the Quran and Baha&#x27;i writings, and extracanonically.

The Genesis flood narrative is among the best-known stories of the Bible. In this account, God &quot;regrets&quot; making mankind because they filled the world with evil. Noah then labors faithfully to build the Ark at God&#x27;s command, ultimately saving not only his own family, but mankind itself and all land animals, from extinction during the Flood. Afterwards, God makes a covenant with Noah and promises never again to destroy the earth with a flood. Noah is also portrayed as a &quot;tiller of the soil&quot; who is the first to cultivate the vine. After the flood, God commands Noah and his sons to &quot;be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth&quot;.

The story of Noah in the Pentateuch is similar to the flood narrative in the Mesopotamian Epic of Gilgamesh, composed around 1800 BC, where a hero builds an ark to survive a divinely sent flood. Scholars suggest that the biblical account was influenced by earlier Mesopotamian traditions, with notable parallels in plot elements and structure. Comparisons are also drawn between Noah and the Greek hero Deucalion, who, like Noah, is warned of a flood, builds an ark, and sends a bird to check on the flood&#x27;s aftermath.

==Biblical narrative==
Tenth and final of the pre-Flood (antediluvian) Patriarchs, son to Lamech and a mother whose name is unmentioned, Noah is 500 years old before his sons Shem, Ham and Japheth are born.

===Genesis flood narrative===
The Genesis flood narrative is encompassed within chapters 6–9 in the Book of Genesis, in the Bible. The narrative indicates that God intended to return the Earth to its pre-Creation state of watery chaos by flooding the Earth because of humanity&#x27;s misdeeds and then remake it using the microcosm of Noah&#x27;s ark. Thus, the flood was no ordinary overflow but a reversal of Creation. The narrative discusses the evil of mankind that moved God to destroy the world by way of the flood, the preparation of the ark for certain animals, Noah, and his family, and God&#x27;s guarantee (the Noahic Covenant) for the continued existence of life under the promise that he would never send another flood.

===After the flood===
After the flood, Noah offered burnt offerings to God. God accepted the sacrifice, and made a covenant with Noah, and through him with all mankind, that he would not waste the earth or destroy man by another deluge.

&quot;And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth&quot;. As a pledge of this gracious covenant with man and beast the rainbow was set in the clouds (ib. viii. 15–22, ix. 8–17). Two injunctions were laid upon Noah: While the eating of animal food was permitted, abstinence from blood was strictly enjoined; and the shedding of the blood of man by man was made a crime punishable by death at the hands of man (ib. ix. 3–6).

Noah, as the last of the extremely long-lived Antediluvian patriarchs, died 350 years after the flood, at the age of 950, when Terah was 128. The maximum human lifespan, as depicted by the Bible, gradually diminishes thereafter, from almost 1,000 years to the 120 years of Moses.

===Noah&#x27;s drunkenness===

After the flood, the Bible says that Noah became a farmer and he planted a vineyard. He drank wine made from this vineyard, and got drunk; and lay &quot;uncovered&quot; within his tent. Noah&#x27;s son Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father naked and told his brothers, which led to Ham&#x27;s son Canaan being cursed by Noah.

As early as the Classical era, commentators on Genesis 9:20–21 have excused Noah&#x27;s excessive drinking because he was considered to be the first wine drinker; the first person to discover the effects of wine. John Chrysostom, Archbishop of Constantinople, and a Church Father, wrote in the 4th century that Noah&#x27;s behavior is defensible: as the first human to taste wine, he would not know its effects: &quot;Through ignorance and inexperience of the proper amount to drink, fell into a drunken stupor&quot;. Philo, a Hellenistic Jewish philosopher, also excused Noah by noting that one can drink in two different manners: (1) to drink wine in excess, a peculiar sin to the vicious evil man or (2) to partake of wine as the wise man, Noah being the latter. In Jewish tradition and rabbinic literature on Noah, rabbis blame Satan for the intoxicating properties of the wine.

In the context of Noah&#x27;s drunkenness, relates two facts: (1) Noah became drunken and &quot;he was uncovered within his tent&quot;, and (2) Ham &quot;saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without&quot;.

Because of its brevity and textual inconsistencies, it has been suggested that this narrative is a &quot;splinter from a more substantial tale&quot;. A fuller account would explain what exactly Ham had done to his father, or why Noah directed a curse at Canaan for Ham&#x27;s misdeed, or how Noah realised what had occurred. In the field of psychological biblical criticism, J. H. Ellens and W. G. Rollins have analysed the unconventional behavior that occurs between Noah and Ham as revolving around sexuality and the exposure of genitalia as compared with other Hebrew Bible texts, such as Habakkuk 2:15 and Lamentations 4:21.

Other commentaries mention that &quot;uncovering someone&#x27;s nakedness&quot; could mean having sexual intercourse with that person or that person&#x27;s spouse, as quoted in Leviticus 18:7–8 and 20. From this interpretation comes the speculation that Ham was guilty of engaging in incest and raping Noah or his own mother. The latter interpretation would clarify why Canaan, as the product of this illicit union, was cursed by Noah.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bergsma/Hahn&quot;&gt;John Sietze Bergsma/Scott Walker Hahn. 2005. &quot;Noah&#x27;s Nakedness and the Curse on Canaan&quot;. &quot;Journal Biblical Literature&quot; 124/1 (2005), pp. 25–40.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, Canaan could be the perpetrator himself as the Bible describes the illicit deed being committed by Noah&#x27;s &quot;youngest son&quot;, with Ham being consistently described as the middle son in other verses.

===Table of nations===

Genesis 10 sets forth the descendants of Shem, Ham, and Japheth, from whom the nations branched out over the Earth after the flood. Among Japheth&#x27;s descendants were the maritime nations (10:2–5). Ham&#x27;s son Cush had a son named Nimrod, who became the first man of might on earth, a hunter, king in Babylon and the land of Shinar (10:6–10). From there Ashur went and built Nineveh. (10:11–12) Canaan&#x27;s descendants Sidon, Heth, the Jebusites, the Amorites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites, the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites spread out from Sidon as far as Gerar, near Gaza, and as far as Sodom and Gomorrah (10:15–19). Among Shem&#x27;s descendants was Eber (10:21).

These genealogies differ structurally from those set out in Genesis 5 and 11. It has a segmented or treelike structure, going from one father to many offspring. It is strange that the table, which assumes that the population is distributed about the Earth, precedes the account of the Tower of Babel, which says that all the population is in one place before it is dispersed.

===Family tree===
Genesis 5:1–32 transmits a genealogy of the Sethites down to Noah, which is taken from the priestly tradition. A genealogy of the Canites from the Jawhistic tradition is found in Genesis 4:17–26. Biblical scholars see these as variants on one and the same list. However, if we take the merged text of Genesis as a single account, we can construct the following family tree, which has come down in this form into the Jewish and Christian traditions.

===Narrative analysis===
According to the documentary hypothesis, the first five books of the Bible (Pentateuch/Torah), including Genesis, were collated during the 5th century BC from four main sources, which themselves date from no earlier than the 10th century BC. Two of these, the Jahwist, composed in the 10th century BC, and the Priestly source, from the late 7th century BC, make up the chapters of Genesis which concern Noah. The attempt by the 5th-century editor to accommodate two independent and sometimes conflicting sources accounts for the confusion over such matters as how many of each animal Noah took, and how long the flood lasted.

&quot;The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Books of the Bible&quot; notes that this story echoes parts of the Garden of Eden story: Noah is the first vintner, while Adam is the first farmer; both have problems with their produce; both stories involve nakedness; and both involve a division between brothers leading to a curse. However, after the flood, the stories differ. It is Noah, not God, who plants the vineyard and utters the curse, so &quot;God is less involved&quot;.

==Other accounts==
In addition to the main story in Genesis, the Hebrew Bible (Christian Old Testament) also refers to Noah in the First Book of Chronicles, Isaiah and Ezekiel. References in the deuterocanonical books include the books of Tobit, Wisdom, Sirach, 2 Esdras and 4 Maccabees. New Testament references include the gospels of Matthew and Luke, and some of the epistles (Epistle to the Hebrews, 1 Peter and 2 Peter).

Noah became the subject of much elaboration in the literature of later Abrahamic religions, including Islam (Surahs 71, 7, 11, 54, and 21 of the Quran) and the Baháʼí Faith (Kitáb-i-Íqán and Gems of Divine Mysteries).

===Pseudepigrapha===
The Book of Jubilees refers to Noah and says that he was taught the arts of healing by an angel so that his children could overcome &quot;the offspring of the Watchers&quot;.

In 10:1–3 of the Book of Enoch (which is part of the Orthodox Tewahedo biblical canon) and canonical for Beta Israel, Uriel was dispatched by &quot;the Most High&quot; to inform Noah of the approaching &quot;deluge&quot;.

===Dead Sea scrolls===
There are 20 or so fragments of the Dead Sea scrolls that appear to refer to Noah. Lawrence Schiffman writes, &quot;Among the Dead Sea Scrolls at least three different versions of this legend are preserved.&quot; In particular, &quot;The Genesis Apocryphon devotes considerable space to Noah.&quot; However, &quot;The material seems to have little in common with Genesis 5 which reports the birth of Noah.&quot; Also, Noah&#x27;s father is reported as worrying that his son was actually fathered by one of the Watchers.

==Religious views==
===Judaism===
The righteousness of Noah is the subject of much discussion among rabbis. The description of Noah as &quot;righteous in his generation&quot; implied to some that his perfection was only relative: In his generation of wicked people, he could be considered righteous, but in the generation of a &quot;tzadik&quot; like Abraham, he would not be considered so righteous. They point out that Noah did not pray to God on behalf of those about to be destroyed, as Abraham prayed for the wicked of Sodom and Gomorrah. In fact, Noah is never seen to speak; he simply listens to God and acts on his orders. This led some commentators to offer the figure of Noah as &quot;the righteous man in a fur coat,&quot; who ensured his own comfort while ignoring his neighbour. Others, such as the medieval commentator Rashi, held on the contrary that the building of the Ark was stretched over 120 years, deliberately in order to give sinners time to repent. Rashi interprets his father&#x27;s statement of the naming of Noah (in Hebrew – Noaħ נֹחַ). &quot;This one will comfort us (in Hebrew– yeNaĦamenu יְנַחֲמֵנו) in our work and in the toil of our hands, which come from the ground that the Lord had cursed&quot; Some interpret this as meaning Noah heralded a new era of prosperity, when there was an easing (in Hebrew, naħah נחה) of the curse from Adam&#x27;s time, when the Earth produced thorns and thistles even where men sowed wheat. It is said that Noah introduced the plow, symbolizing this relief.

According to the &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot;, &quot;The Book of Genesis contains two accounts of Noah.&quot; In the first, Noah is the hero of the flood, and in the second, he is the father of mankind and a husbandman who planted the first vineyard. &quot;The disparity of character between these two narratives has caused some critics to insist that the subject of the latter account was not the same as the subject of the former.&quot;

The &quot;Encyclopedia Judaica&quot; notes that Noah&#x27;s drunkenness is not presented as reprehensible behavior. Rather, &quot;It is clear that ... Noah’s venture into viticulture provides the setting for the castigation of Israel’s Canaanite neighbors.&quot; It was Ham who committed an offense when he viewed his father&#x27;s nakedness. Yet, &quot;Noah’s curse, ... is strangely aimed at Canaan rather than the disrespectful Ham.&quot;

===Mandaeism===
In Mandaeism, Noah () is mentioned in of the &quot;Right Ginza&quot;. In the text, Noah&#x27;s wife is named as Nuraita (), while his son is named as Shum (i.e., Shem; ).

===Christianity===
2 Peter 2:5 refers to Noah as a &quot;preacher of righteousness&quot;. In the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke, Jesus compares Noah&#x27;s flood with the coming Day of Judgement: &quot;Just as it was in the days of Noah, so too it will be in the days of the coming of the Son of Man. For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark; and they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away. That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man.&quot;

The First Epistle of Peter compares the power of baptism with the Ark saving those who were in it. In later Christian thought, the Ark came to be compared to the Church: salvation was to be found only within Christ and his Lordship, as in Noah&#x27;s time it had been found only within the Ark. St Augustine of Hippo (354–430), demonstrated in &quot;The City of God&quot; that the dimensions of the Ark corresponded to the dimensions of the human body, which corresponds to the body of Christ; the equation of Ark and Church is still found in the Anglican rite of baptism, which asks God, &quot;who of thy great mercy didst save Noah,&quot; to receive into the Church the infant about to be baptised.

In medieval Christianity, Noah&#x27;s three sons were generally considered as the founders of the populations of the three known continents, Japheth/Europe, Shem/Asia, and Ham/Africa, although a rarer variation held that they represented the three classes of medieval society – the priests (Shem), the warriors (Japheth), and the peasants (Ham). In medieval Christian thought, Ham was considered to be the ancestor of the people of black Africa. So, in racialist arguments, the curse of Ham became a justification for the slavery of the black races.

Isaac Newton, in his religious works on the development of religion, wrote about Noah and his offspring. In Newton&#x27;s view, while Noah was a monotheist, the gods of pagan antiquity are identified with Noah and his descendants.

===Gnosticism===
An important Gnostic text, the &quot;Apocryphon of John&quot;, reports that the chief archon caused the flood because he desired to destroy the world he had made, but the First Thought informed Noah of the chief archon&#x27;s plans, and Noah informed the remainder of humanity. Unlike the account of Genesis, not only are Noah&#x27;s family saved, but many others also heed Noah&#x27;s call. There is no ark in this account. According to Elaine Pagels, &quot;Rather, they hid in a particular place, not only Noah, but also many other people from the unshakable race. They entered that place and hid in a bright cloud.&quot;

===Druze faith===
The Druze regard Noah as the second spokesman (&quot;natiq&quot;) after Adam, who helped transmit the foundational teachings of monotheism (&quot;tawhid&quot;) intended for the larger audience. He is considered an important prophet of God among Druze, being among the seven prophets who appeared in different periods of history.

===Islam===

Noah is a highly important figure in Islam and he is seen as one of the most significant of all prophets. The Quran contains 43 references to Noah, or &quot;Nuḥ&quot;, in 28 chapters, and the seventy-first chapter, &quot;Sūrah Nūḥ&quot; (), is named after him. His life is also spoken of in the commentaries and in Islamic legends.

Noah&#x27;s narratives largely cover his preaching as well the story of the Deluge. Noah&#x27;s narrative sets the prototype for many of the subsequent prophetic stories, which begin with the prophet warning his people and then the community rejecting the message and facing a punishment.

Noah has several titles in Islam, based primarily on praise for him in the Quran, including &quot;Trustworthy Messenger of God&quot; () and &quot;Grateful Servant of God&quot; ().

The Quran focuses on several instances from Noah&#x27;s life more than others, and one of the most significant events is the Flood. God makes a covenant with Noah just as he did with Abraham, Moses, Jesus and Muhammad later on (). Noah is later reviled by his people and reproached by them for being a mere human messenger and not an angel (). Moreover, the people mock Noah&#x27;s words and call him a liar (), and they even suggest that Noah is possessed by a devil when the prophet ceases to preach (). Only the lowest of classes in the community join Noah in believing in God&#x27;s message (), and Noah&#x27;s narrative further describes him preaching both in private and public. The Quran narrates that Noah received a revelation to build an Ark, after his people refused to believe in his message and hear the warning. The narrative goes on to describe that waters poured forth from both the earth and the Heavens, destroying all the sinners. Even one of his sons disbelieved him, stayed behind, and was drowned. After the Flood ended, the Ark rested atop Mount Judi ().

Also, Islamic beliefs deny the idea of Noah being the first person to drink wine and experience the aftereffects of doing so.

Quran 29:14 states that Noah had been living among the people who he was sent to for 950 years when the flood started.

===Baháʼí Faith===
The Baháʼí Faith regards the Ark and the Flood as symbolic. In Baháʼí belief, only Noah&#x27;s followers were spiritually alive, preserved in the ark of his teachings, as others were spiritually dead. The Baháʼí scripture &quot;Kitáb-i-Íqán&quot; endorses the Islamic belief that Noah had a large number of companions, either 40 or 72, besides his family on the Ark, and that he taught for 950 (symbolic) years before the flood.

===Ahmadiyya===
According to the Ahmadiyya understanding of the Quran, the period described in the Quran is the age of his dispensation, which extended until the time of Ibrahim (Abraham, 950 years). The first 50 years were the years of spiritual progress, which were followed by 900 years of spiritual deterioration of the people of Noah.

==Comparative mythology==
Indian and Greek flood-myths also exist, although there is little evidence that they were derived from the Mesopotamian flood-myth that underlies the biblical account.

===Mesopotamian===

The Noah story of the Pentateuch is quite similar to a flood story contained in the Mesopotamian Epic of Gilgamesh, composed . In the Gilgamesh version, the Mesopotamian gods decide to send a great flood to destroy mankind. Various correlations between the stories of Noah and Gilgamesh (the flood, the construction of the ark, the salvation of animals, and the release of birds following the flood) have led to this story being seen as the source for the story of Noah. The few variations include the number of days of the deluge, the order of the birds, and the name of the mountain on which the ark rests. The flood story in Genesis 6–8 matches the Gilgamesh flood myth so closely that &quot;few doubt that [it] derives from a Mesopotamian account.&quot; What is particularly noticeable is the way the Genesis flood story follows the Gilgamesh flood tale &quot;point by point and in the same order&quot;, even when the story permits other alternatives.

The earliest written flood myth is found in the Mesopotamian Epic of Atrahasis and Epic of Gilgamesh texts. The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; says &quot;These mythologies are the source of such features of the biblical Flood story as the building and provisioning of the ark, its flotation, and the subsidence of the waters, as well as the part played by the human protagonist.&quot; The &quot;Encyclopedia Judaica&quot; adds that there is a strong suggestion that &quot;an intermediate agent was active. The people most likely to have fulfilled this role are the Hurrians, whose territory included the city of Harran, where the Patriarch Abraham had his roots. The Hurrians inherited the Flood story from Babylonia&quot;.
The encyclopedia mentions another similarity between the stories: Noah is the tenth patriarch and Berossus notes that &quot;the hero of the great flood was Babylonia&#x27;s tenth antediluvian king.&quot; However, there is a discrepancy in the ages of the heroes. For the Mesopotamian antecedents, &quot;the reigns of the antediluvian kings range from 18,600 to nearly 65,000 years.&quot; In the Bible, the lifespans &quot;fall far short of the briefest reign mentioned in the related Mesopotamian texts.&quot; Also, the name of the hero differs between the traditions: &quot;The earliest Mesopotamian flood account, written in the Sumerian language, calls the deluge hero Ziusudra.&quot;

However, Yi Samuel Chen writes that the oldest versions of the Epic of Gilgamesh never mentioned the flood, just mentioning that he went to talk to Utnapishtim to find the secret of immortality. Starting with the Old Babylonian Period, there were attempts to syncretize Utnapishtim with Ziusudra, even though they were previously seen as different figures. Gilgamesh meeting the flood hero was first alluded to in the Old Babylonian Period in &quot;The Death of Gilgamesh&quot; and eventually was imported and standardized in the Epic of Gilgamesh probably in the Middle Babylonian Period.

Gilgamesh&#x27;s historical reign is believed to have been approximately 2700 BC, shortly before the earliest known written stories. The discovery of artifacts associated with Aga and Enmebaragesi of Kish, two other kings named in the stories, has lent credibility to the historical existence of Gilgamesh.

The earliest Sumerian Gilgamesh poems date from as early as the Third dynasty of Ur (2100–2000 BC). One of these poems mentions Gilgamesh&#x27;s journey to meet the flood hero, as well as a short version of the flood story, although Chen writes that his was included in texts written during the Old Babylonian Period. The earliest Akkadian versions of the unified epic are dated to c. 2000–1700 BC. Due to the fragmentary nature of these Old Babylonian versions, it is unclear whether they included an expanded account of the flood myth; although one fragment definitely includes the story of Gilgamesh&#x27;s journey to meet Utnapishtim. The &quot;standard&quot; Akkadian version included a long version of the flood story and was edited by Sin-liqe-unninni sometime between 1300 and 1000 BC.

Yi Samuel Chen, analyzing various texts from the Early Dynastic III Period to the Old Babylonian Period, argues that the flood narrative was only added in texts written during the latter Old Babylonian Period. Observations by experts indicate that the portions of the Sumerian King List which mention the time before the flood are stylistically different from the King List Proper. Chen writes that Old Babylonian copies tend to show a separate pre-flood tradition which is apart from the King List. Further, the Ur III copy of the King List as well as similar documents indicate that the King List Proper once existed independent of a flood narrative or a pre-flood tradition. Chen provides evidence that the sections of the Sumerian King List that mention references to the flood were all later additions added during the Old Babylonian Period through later updates and edits. The Flood as a watershed in early history of the world was probably a new historiographical concept emerging in the Mesopotamian literary traditions during the Old Babylonian Period, as evident by the fact that the flood motif didn&#x27;t show up in the Ur III copy and that the earliest chronographical sources related to the flood show up in the Old Babylonian Period. Chen concludes that the name of Ziusudra as a flood hero, as well as any hinted references of a flood, in the Old Babylonian Version of the Instructions of Shuruppak were later developments during the Old Babylonian Period, originating from updated information added to the text from the burgeoning Antediluvian Tradition.

===Ancient Greek===
Noah has often been compared to Deucalion, the son of Prometheus and Hesinoe in Greek mythology. Like Noah, Deucalion is warned of the flood (by Zeus and Poseidon); he builds an ark and staffs it with creatures – and when he completes his voyage, gives thanks and takes advice from the gods on how to repopulate the Earth. Deucalion also sends a pigeon to find out about the situation of the world and the bird returns with an olive branch. Deucalion, in some versions of the myth, also becomes the inventor of wine, like Noah. Philo and Justin equate Deucalion with Noah, and Josephus used the story of Deucalion as evidence that the flood actually occurred and that, therefore, Noah existed.

The motif of a weather deity who headed the pantheon causing the great flood and then the trickster who created men from clay saving man is also present in Sumerian Mythology, as Enlil, instead of Zeus, causes the flood, and Enki, rather than Prometheus, saves man. Stephanie West has written that this is perhaps due to the Greeks borrowing stories from the Near East.

<text>Norwegian ( ) is a North Germanic language from the Indo-European language family spoken mainly in Norway, where it is an official language. Along with Swedish and Danish, Norwegian forms a dialect continuum of more or less mutually intelligible local and regional varieties; some Norwegian and Swedish dialects, in particular, are very close. These Scandinavian languages, together with Faroese and Icelandic as well as some extinct languages, constitute the North Germanic languages. Faroese and Icelandic are not mutually intelligible with Norwegian in their spoken form because continental Scandinavian has diverged from them. While the two Germanic languages with the greatest numbers of speakers, English and German, have close similarities with Norwegian, neither is mutually intelligible with it. Norwegian is a descendant of Old Norse, the common language of the Germanic peoples living in Scandinavia during the Viking Age.

Today there are two official forms of &quot;written&quot; Norwegian, (Riksmål) and (Landsmål), each with its own variants. developed from the Dano-Norwegian language that replaced Middle Norwegian as the elite language after the union of Denmark–Norway in the 16th and 17th centuries and then evolved in Norway, while was developed based upon a collective of spoken Norwegian dialects. Norwegian is one of the two official languages in Norway, along with Sámi, a Finno-Ugric language spoken by less than one percent of the population. Norwegian is one of the working languages of the Nordic Council. Under the Nordic Language Convention, citizens of the Nordic countries who speak Norwegian have the opportunity to use it when interacting with official bodies in other Nordic countries without being liable for any interpretation or translation costs.

==History==
===Origins===

Like most of the languages in Europe, Norwegian derives from Proto-Indo-European. As early Indo-Europeans spread across Europe, they became isolated from each other and new languages developed. In northwest Europe, the Germanic languages evolved, further branching off into the North Germanic languages, of which Norwegian is one.

Proto-Norse is thought to have evolved as a northern dialect of Proto-Germanic during the first centuries AD in what is today Southern Sweden. It is the earliest stage of a characteristically North Germanic language, and the language attested in the Elder Futhark inscriptions, the oldest form of the runic alphabets. A number of inscriptions are memorials to the dead, while others are magical in content. The oldest are carved on loose objects, while later ones are chiseled in runestones. They are the oldest written record of any Germanic language.

Around 800 AD, the script was simplified to the Younger Futhark, and inscriptions became more abundant. At the same time, the beginning of the Viking Age led to the spread of Old Norse to Iceland, Greenland, and the Faroe Islands. Viking colonies also existed in parts of the British Isles, France (Normandy), North America, and Kievan Rus. In all of these places except Iceland and the Faroes, Old Norse speakers went extinct or were absorbed into the local population.

===The Roman alphabet===
Around 1030, Christianity came to Scandinavia, bringing with it an influx of Latin borrowings and the Roman alphabet. These new words were related to church practices and ceremonies, although many other loanwords related to general culture also entered the language.

The Scandinavian languages at this time are not considered to be separate languages, although there were minor differences among what are customarily called Old Icelandic, Old Norwegian, Old Gutnish, Old Danish, and Old Swedish.

===11th━15th century===


===Low German influence===
The economic and political dominance of the Hanseatic League between 1250 and 1450 in the main Scandinavian cities brought large Middle Low German–speaking populations to Norway. The influence of their language on Scandinavian is comparable with that of French on English after the Norman conquest.

===Decline of written Norwegian===
In the late Middle Ages, dialects began to develop in Scandinavia because the population was rural and little travel occurred. When the Reformation came from Germany, Martin Luther&#x27;s High German translation of the Bible was quickly translated into Swedish, Danish, and Icelandic. Norway entered a union with Denmark in 1397 and Danish, over time, replaced Middle Norwegian as the language of the elite, the church, literature, and the law. When the union with Denmark ended in 1814, the Dano-Norwegian &quot;koiné&quot; had become the mother tongue of around 1% of the population.

===Danish to Norwegian standardisation===
From the 1840s, some writers experimented with a Norwegianised form of written Danish. Knud Knudsen proposed to change spelling and inflection in accordance with the Dano-Norwegian &quot;koiné&quot;, known as &quot;cultivated everyday speech.&quot; A small adjustment in this direction was implemented in the first official reform of the Danish language in Norway in 1862 and more extensively after his death in two official reforms in 1907 and 1917.

Meanwhile, a nationalistic movement strove for the development of a new written Norwegian. Ivar Aasen, a botanist and self-taught linguist, began his work to create a new Norwegian language at the age of 22. He traveled around the country collecting words and examples of grammar from the dialects and comparing the dialects among the different regions. He examined the development of Icelandic, which had largely escaped the influences under which Norwegian had come. He called his work, which was published in several books from 1848 to 1873, Landsmål, meaning &#x27;national language&#x27;. The name &quot;Landsmål&quot; is sometimes interpreted as &#x27;rural language&#x27; or &#x27;country language&#x27;, but this was clearly not Aasen&#x27;s intended meaning.

The name of the Danish language in Norway was a topic of hot dispute throughout the 19th century. Its proponents claimed that it was a language common to Norway and Denmark, and no more Danish than Norwegian. The proponents of Landsmål thought that the Danish character of the language should not be concealed. In 1899, Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson proposed the neutral name &quot;Riksmål&quot;, meaning &#x27;national language&#x27; like &quot;Landsmål&quot;, and this was officially adopted along with the 1907 spelling reform. The name &quot;Riksmål&quot; is sometimes interpreted as &#x27;state language&#x27;, but this meaning is secondary at best. (Compare to Danish &quot;rigsmål&quot; from where the name was borrowed.)

After the personal union with Sweden was dissolved in 1905, both languages were developed further and reached what is now considered their classic forms after a reform in 1917. Riksmål was, in 1929, officially renamed &quot;Bokmål&quot; (literally &#x27;book language&#x27;), and Landsmål to &quot;Nynorsk&quot; (literally &#x27;new Norwegian&#x27;). A proposition to substitute Danish-Norwegian () for &quot;Bokmål&quot; lost in parliament by a single vote. The name &quot;Nynorsk&quot;, the linguistic term for modern Norwegian, was chosen to contrast with Danish and emphasise the historical connection to Old Norwegian. Today, this meaning is often lost, and it is commonly mistaken as a &quot;new&quot; Norwegian in contrast to the &quot;real&quot; Norwegian Bokmål.

Bokmål and Nynorsk were made closer by a reform in 1938. This was a result of a state policy to merge Nynorsk and Bokmål into a single language, to be called &quot;Samnorsk&quot;. A 1946 poll showed that this policy was supported by 79% of Norwegians at the time. However, opponents of the official policy still managed to create a massive protest movement against &quot;Samnorsk&quot; in the 1950s, fighting in particular the use of &quot;radical&quot; forms in Bokmål text books in schools. In the reform in 1959, the 1938 reform was partially reversed in Bokmål, but Nynorsk was changed further towards Bokmål. Since then Bokmål has reverted even further toward traditional Riksmål, while Nynorsk still adheres to the 1959 standard. Therefore, a small minority of Nynorsk enthusiasts use a more conservative standard called Høgnorsk. The Samnorsk policy had little influence after 1960, and was officially abandoned in 2002.

==Phonology==

While the sound systems of Norwegian and Swedish are similar, considerable variation exists among the dialects.

===Consonants===
The retroflex consonants only appear in East Norwegian dialects as a result of sandhi, combining with , , , , and .

The realization of the rhotic depends on the dialect. In Eastern, Central, and Northern Norwegian dialects, it is a flap , whereas in Western and Southern Norway, and for some speakers also in Eastern Norway, it is uvular or . And in the dialects of North-Western Norway, it is realized as , much like the trilled of Spanish.

===Vowels===
===Accent===
Norwegian is a pitch-accent language with two distinct pitch patterns, like Swedish. They are used to differentiate two-syllable words with otherwise identical pronunciation. For example, in many East Norwegian dialects, the word (&#x27;farmers&#x27;) is pronounced using the simpler tone 1, while (&#x27;beans&#x27; or &#x27;prayers&#x27;) uses the more complex tone 2. Though spelling differences occasionally differentiate written words, in most cases the minimal pairs are written alike, since written Norwegian has no explicit accent marks. In most eastern low-tone dialects, accent 1 uses a low flat pitch in the first syllable, while accent 2 uses a high, sharply falling pitch in the first syllable and a low pitch in the beginning of the second syllable. In both accents, these pitch movements are followed by a rise of intonational nature (phrase accent)—the size (and presence) of which signals emphasis or focus, and corresponds in function to the normal accent in languages that lack lexical tone, such as English. That rise culminates in the final syllable of an accentual phrase, while the utterance-final fall common in most languages is either very small or absent.

There are significant variations in pitch accent between dialects. Thus, in most of western and northern Norway (the so-called high-pitch dialects) accent 1 is falling, while accent 2 is rising in the first syllable and falling in the second syllable or somewhere around the syllable boundary. The pitch accents (as well as the peculiar phrase accent in the low-tone dialects) give the Norwegian language a &quot;singing&quot; quality that makes it easy to distinguish from other languages. Accent 1 generally occurs in words that were monosyllabic in Old Norse, and accent 2 in words that were polysyllabic.

==Written language==

===Alphabet===

The Norwegian alphabet has 29 letters.
The letters &quot;c&quot;, &quot;q&quot;, &quot;w&quot;, &quot;x&quot; and &quot;z&quot; are only used in loanwords. As loanwords are assimilated into Norwegian, their spelling might change to reflect Norwegian pronunciation and the principles of Norwegian orthography, e.g. &quot;zebra&quot; in Norwegian is written . Due to historical reasons, some otherwise Norwegian family names are also written using these letters.

Some letters may be modified by diacritics: &quot;é&quot;, &quot;è&quot;, &quot;ê&quot;, &quot;ó&quot;, &quot;ò&quot;, and &quot;ô&quot;. In Nynorsk, &quot;ì&quot; and &quot;ù&quot; and &quot;ỳ&quot; are occasionally seen as well. The diacritics are not compulsory, but may in a few cases distinguish between different meanings of the word, e.g.: (&#x27;for/to&#x27;), (&#x27;went&#x27;), (&#x27;furrow&#x27;) and (&#x27;fodder&#x27;). Loanwords may be spelled with other diacritics, most notably &quot;ï, ü&quot;, &quot;á&quot; and &quot;à&quot;.

===Bokmål and Nynorsk===
The two legally recognized forms of &quot;written&quot; Norwegian are &quot;Bokmål&quot; (literally &#x27;book tongue&#x27;) and &quot;Nynorsk&quot; (&#x27;new Norwegian&#x27;), which are regulated by the Language Council of Norway (). Two other written forms without official status also exist. One, called &quot;Riksmål&quot; (&#x27;national language&#x27;), is today to a large extent the same language as Bokmål though somewhat closer to the Danish language. It is regulated by the unofficial Norwegian Academy, which translates the name as &#x27;Standard Norwegian&#x27;. The other is &quot;Høgnorsk&quot; (&#x27;High Norwegian&#x27;), a more purist form of Nynorsk, which maintains the language in an original form as given by Ivar Aasen and rejects most of the reforms from the 20th century; this form has limited use.

Nynorsk and Bokmål provide standards for how to write Norwegian, but not for how to speak the language. No standard of spoken Norwegian is officially sanctioned, and most Norwegians speak their own dialects in all circumstances. Thus, unlike in many other countries, the use of any Norwegian dialect, whether it coincides with the written norms or not, is accepted as correct &quot;spoken&quot; Norwegian. However, in areas where East Norwegian dialects are used, a tendency exists to accept a de facto spoken standard for this particular regional dialect, Urban East Norwegian or Standard East Norwegian (), in which the vocabulary coincides with Bokmål. Outside Eastern Norway, this spoken variation is not used.

From the 16th to the 19th centuries, Danish was the standard written language of Norway. As a result, the development of modern written Norwegian has been subject to strong controversy related to nationalism, rural versus urban discourse, and Norway&#x27;s literary history. Historically, Bokmål is a Norwegianised variety of Danish, while Nynorsk is a language form based on Norwegian dialects and puristic opposition to Danish. The now-abandoned official policy to merge Bokmål and Nynorsk into one common language called &quot;Samnorsk&quot; through a series of spelling reforms has created a wide spectrum of varieties of both Bokmål and Nynorsk. The unofficial form known as &quot;Riksmål&quot; is considered more conservative than Bokmål and is far closer to Danish while the unofficial &quot;Høgnorsk&quot; is more conservative than Nynorsk and is far closer to Faroese, Icelandic and Old Norse.

Norwegians are educated in both Bokmål and Nynorsk. Each student gets assigned a native form based on which school they go to, whence the other form (known as ) will be a mandatory school subject from elementary school through high school. For instance, a Norwegian whose main language form is Bokmål will study Nynorsk as a mandatory subject throughout both elementary and high school. A 2005 poll indicates that 86.3% use primarily Bokmål as their daily written language, 5.5% use both Bokmål and Nynorsk, and 7.5% use primarily Nynorsk. Thus, 13% are frequently &quot;writing&quot; Nynorsk, though the majority &quot;speak&quot; dialects that resemble Nynorsk more closely than Bokmål. Broadly speaking, Nynorsk writing is widespread in western Norway, though not in major urban areas, and also in the upper parts of mountain valleys in the southern and eastern parts of Norway. Examples are Setesdal, the western part of Telemark county () and several municipalities in Hallingdal, Valdres, and Gudbrandsdalen. It is little used elsewhere, but 30–40 years ago, it also had strongholds in many rural parts of Trøndelag (mid-Norway) and the southern part of northern Norway (Nordland county). Today, Nynorsk is the official language of not only four of the nineteen Norwegian counties but also various municipalities in five other counties. NRK, the Norwegian broadcasting corporation, broadcasts in both Bokmål and Nynorsk, and all governmental agencies are required to support both written languages. Bokmål is used in 92% of all written publications, and Nynorsk in 8% (2000).

Like some other European countries, Norway has an official &quot;advisory board&quot; Språkrådet (Norwegian Language Council) that determines, after approval from the Ministry of Culture, official spelling, grammar, and vocabulary for the Norwegian language. The board&#x27;s work has been subject to considerable controversy throughout the years.

Both Nynorsk and Bokmål have a great variety of optional forms. The Bokmål that uses the forms that are close to Riksmål is called &quot;moderate&quot; or &quot;conservative&quot;, depending on one&#x27;s viewpoint, while the Bokmål that uses the forms that are close to Nynorsk is called &quot;radical&quot;. Nynorsk has forms that are close to the original Landsmål and forms that are close to Bokmål.

===Riksmål===
Opponents of the spelling reforms aimed at bringing Bokmål closer to Nynorsk have retained the name Riksmål and employ spelling and grammar that predate the Samnorsk movement. Riksmål and conservative versions of Bokmål have been the &quot;de facto&quot; standard written language of Norway for most of the 20th century, being used by large newspapers, encyclopedias, and a significant proportion of the population of the capital Oslo, surrounding areas, and other urban areas, as well as much of the literary tradition. Since the reforms of 1981 and 2003 (effective in 2005), the official Bokmål can be adapted to be almost identical with modern Riksmål. The differences between written Riksmål and Bokmål are comparable to American and British English differences.

Riksmål is regulated by the Norwegian Academy, which determines acceptable spelling, grammar, and vocabulary.

===Høgnorsk===
There is also an unofficial form of Nynorsk, called &quot;Høgnorsk&quot;, discarding the post-1917 reforms, and thus close to Ivar Aasen&#x27;s original Landsmål. It is supported by Ivar Aasen-sambandet, but has found no widespread use.

===Current usage===

In 2010, 86.5% of the pupils in the primary and lower secondary schools in Norway receive education in Bokmål, while 13.0% receive education in Nynorsk. From the eighth grade onwards, pupils are required to learn both. Out of the 431 municipalities in Norway, 161 have declared that they wish to communicate with the central authorities in Bokmål, 116 (representing 12% of the population) in Nynorsk, while 156 are neutral. Of 4,549 state publications in 2000, 8% were in Nynorsk, and 92% in Bokmål. The large national newspapers (, and &quot;VG&quot;) are published in Bokmål or Riksmål. Some major regional newspapers (including and &quot;Stavanger Aftenblad&quot;), many political journals, and many local newspapers use both Bokmål and Nynorsk.

A newer trend is to write in dialect for informal use. When writing an SMS, Facebook update, or fridge note, many people, especially young ones, write approximations of the way they talk rather than using Bokmål or Nynorsk.

==Dialects==

There is general agreement that a wide range of differences makes it difficult to estimate the number of different Norwegian dialects. Variations in grammar, syntax, vocabulary, and pronunciation cut across geographical boundaries and can create a distinct dialect at the level of farm clusters. Dialects are in some cases so dissimilar as to be unintelligible to unfamiliar listeners. Many linguists note a trend toward regionalization of dialects that diminishes the differences at such local levels; there is, however, a renewed interest in preserving dialects.

==Grammar==
===Nouns===

Norwegian nouns are inflected for number (singular/plural) and for definiteness (indefinite/definite). In a few dialects, definite nouns are also inflected for the dative case.

Norwegian nouns belong to three noun classes (genders): masculine, feminine and neuter. All feminine nouns can optionally be inflected using masculine noun class morphology in Bokmål due to its Danish heritage. In comparison, the use of all three genders (including the feminine) is mandatory in Nynorsk.

All Norwegian dialects have traditionally retained all the three grammatical genders from Old Norse to some extent. The only exceptions are the dialect of Bergen and a few upper class sociolects at the west end of Oslo that have completely lost the feminine gender.

According to Marit Westergaard, approximately 80% of nouns in Norwegian are masculine.

Norwegian and other Scandinavian languages use a suffix to indicate definiteness of a noun, unlike English which has a separate article, &quot;the&quot;, to indicate the same.

In general, almost all nouns in Bokmål follow these patterns (like the words in the examples above):
In contrast, almost all nouns in Nynorsk follow these patterns (the noun gender system is more pronounced than in Bokmål):

There is in general no way to infer what grammatical gender a specific noun has, but there are some patterns of nouns where the gender can be inferred. For instance, all nouns ending in -&quot;nad&quot; will be masculine in both Bokmål and Nynorsk (for instance the noun , which means &#x27;job application&#x27;). Most nouns ending in -&quot;ing&quot; will be feminine, like the noun (&#x27;expectation&#x27;).

There are some common irregular nouns, many of which are irregular in both Bokmål and Nynorsk, like the following:

In Nynorsk, even though the irregular word is masculine, it is inflected like a feminine word in the plural. Another word with the same irregular inflection is (&#x27;son – sons&#x27;).

In Nynorsk, nouns ending in -&quot;ing&quot; typically have masculine plural inflections, like the word in the following table. But they are treated as feminine nouns in every other way.

In general, the genitive case has died out in modern Norwegian and there are only some remnants of it in certain expressions: (&#x27;to the mountains&#x27;), (&#x27;to the sea&#x27;). To show ownership, there is an enclitic -&quot;s&quot; similar to English -″&quot;s&quot;; (&#x27;Sondre&#x27;s nice car&#x27;, &quot;Sondre&quot; being a personal name). There are also reflexive possessive pronouns, , , , ; (&#x27;It is Sondre&#x27;s&#x27;). In both Bokmål and modern Nynorsk, there is often a mix of both of these to mark possession, though it is more common in Nynorsk to use the reflexive pronouns; in Nynorsk use of the reflexive possessive pronouns is generally encouraged to avoid mixing the enclitic -&quot;s&quot; with the historical grammatical case remnants of the language. The reflexive pronouns agree in gender and number with the noun.

The enclitic -&quot;s&quot; in Norwegian evolved as a shorthand expression for the possessive pronouns , , and .
===Adjectives===

Norwegian adjectives, like those of Swedish and Danish, inflect for definiteness, gender, number and for comparison (affirmative/comparative/superlative). Inflection for definiteness follows two paradigms, called &quot;weak&quot; and &quot;strong&quot;, a feature shared among the Germanic languages.

The following table summarizes the inflection of adjectives in Norwegian. The indefinite affirmative inflection can vary between adjectives, but in general the paradigm illustrated below is the most common. 

Predicate adjectives follow only the indefinite inflection table. Unlike attributive adjectives, they are not inflected for definiteness. 

In most dialects, some verb participles used as adjectives have a separate form in both definite and plural uses, and sometimes also in the masculine-feminine singular. In some Southwestern dialects, the definite adjective is also declined in gender and number with one form for feminine and plural, and one form for masculine and neuter.

==== Attributive adjectives ====

===== Definite inflection =====
In Norwegian, a definite noun has a suffixed definite article (cf. above) compared to English which in general uses the separate word &quot;the&quot; to indicate the same. However, when a definite noun is preceded by an adjective, the adjective also gets a definite inflection, shown in the inflection table above. There is also another definite marker, , that has to agree in gender with the noun when the definite noun is accompanied by an adjective. It comes before the adjective and has the following forms
Examples of definite affirmative inflection of adjectives (Bokmål):

* (&#x27;The stolen car&#x27;)
* (&#x27;The pretty girl&#x27;)
* (&#x27;The green apple&#x27;)
* (&#x27;The stolen cars&#x27;)

If the adjective is dropped completely, the meaning of the preceding article before the noun changes, as shown in this example.

Examples (Bokmål):

* (&#x27;That car&#x27;)
* (&#x27;That girl&#x27;)
* (&#x27;That apple&#x27;)
* (&#x27;Those cars&#x27;)

Examples of definite comparative and superlative inflection of adjectives (Bokmål):

* (&#x27;The greener apple&#x27;)
* (&#x27;The greenest apple&#x27;)

Definiteness is also signaled by using possessive pronouns or any uses of a noun in its genitive form in either Nynorsk or Bokmål: (&#x27;my green house&#x27;), (&#x27;my green car&#x27;), (&#x27;my receding gums&#x27;), (&#x27;the president&#x27;s old house&#x27;).

===== Indefinite inflection =====
Examples (Bokmål):

* (&#x27;A green car&#x27;)
* (&#x27;A pretty girl&#x27;)
* (&#x27;A green apple&#x27;)
* (&#x27;Many green cars&#x27;)

Examples of comparative and superlative inflections in Bokmål: (&#x27;a greener car&#x27;), (&#x27;greenest car&#x27;).

====Predicative adjectives====
There is also predicative agreement of adjectives in all dialects of Norwegian and in the written languages, unlike related languages like German and Dutch. This feature of predicative agreement is shared among the Scandinavian languages. Predicative adjectives do not inflect for definiteness unlike the attributive adjectives.

This means that nouns will have to agree with the adjective when there is a copula verb involved, like in Bokmål: (&#x27;to be&#x27;), (&#x27;become&#x27;), (&#x27;looks like&#x27;), (&#x27;feels like&#x27;) etc. 
===Verbs===

Norwegian verbs are not conjugated for person or number, unlike English and most European languages, though a few Norwegian dialects do conjugate for number. Norwegian verbs are conjugated according to mainly three grammatical moods: indicative, imperative and subjunctive, though the subjunctive mood has largely fallen out of use and is mainly found in a few common frozen expressions. The imperative is formed by removing the last vowel of the infinitive verb form, just like in the other Scandinavian languages.

Indicative verbs are conjugated for tense: present, past, and future. The present and past tense also have a passive form for the infinitive.

There are four non-finite verb forms: infinitive, passive infinitive, and the two participles: perfective/past participle and imperfective/present participle.

The participles are verbal adjectives. The imperfective participle is not declined, whereas the perfect participle is declined for gender (though not in Bokmål) and number like strong, affirmative adjectives. The definite form of the participle is identical to the plural form.

As with other Germanic languages, Norwegian verbs can be divided into two conjugation classes; weak verbs and strong verbs.

==== Ergative verbs ====

There are ergative verbs in both Bokmål and Nynorsk, where there are two different conjugation patterns depending on if the verb takes an object or not. In Bokmål, there are only two different conjugations for the preterite tense for the strong verbs, while Nynorsk has different conjugations for all tenses, like Swedish and a majority of Norwegian dialects. Some weak verbs are also ergative and are differentiated for all tenses in both Bokmål and Nynorsk, like , both of which meaning &#x27;to lie down&#x27;, but does not take an object while requires an object. corresponds to the English verb &#x27;lay&#x27;, while corresponds to the English verb &#x27;lie&#x27;. There are, however, many verbs that do not have a direct translation to English verbs.
===Pronouns===

Norwegian personal pronouns are declined according to case: nominative and accusative. Like English, pronouns in Bokmål and Nynorsk are the only class that has case declension. Some of the dialects that have preserved the dative in nouns, also have a dative case instead of the accusative case in personal pronouns, while others have accusative in pronouns and dative in nouns, effectively giving these dialects three distinct cases.

In the most comprehensive Norwegian grammar, Norsk referansegrammatikk, the categorization of personal pronouns by person, gender, and number is not regarded as inflection. Pronouns are a closed class in Norwegian.

Since December 2017, the gender-neutral pronoun is present in the Norwegian Academy&#x27;s dictionary (NAOB). In June 2022, the Language Council of Norway (Språkrådet) started including in both Bokmål and Nynorsk Norwegian standards.

The words for &#x27;mine&#x27;, &#x27;yours&#x27; etc. are dependent on the gender of the noun described. Like adjectives, they have to agree in gender with the noun.

Bokmål has two sets of third-person pronouns. and refer to male and female individuals respectively; and refer to impersonal or inanimate nouns, of masculine/feminine or neutral gender respectively. In contrast, Nynorsk and most dialects use the same set of pronouns (&#x27;he&#x27;), (&#x27;she&#x27;) and (&#x27;it&#x27;) for both personal and impersonal references, like in German, Icelandic and Old Norse. also has expletive and cataphoric uses like in the English examples it rains&quot; and it was known by everyone (that) he had travelled the world&quot;.
==== Ordering of possessive pronouns ====
The ordering of possessive pronouns is somewhat freer than in Swedish or Danish. When there is no adjective, the most common word order is the one used in the examples in the table above, where the possessive comes after the noun, while the noun is in its definite form; (&#x27;my book&#x27;). If one wishes to emphasize the owner of the noun, the possessive pronoun will usually be placed first. In Bokmål, however, due to its Danish origins, one could choose to always write the possessive first: (&#x27;my car&#x27;), but this may sound very formal. Some dialects that have been very influenced by Danish also do this; some speakers in Bærum and the west of Oslo may always use this word order. When there is an adjective describing the noun, the possessive pronoun will always come first: (&#x27;my own car&#x27;).

===Determiners===

The closed class of Norwegian determiners are declined in gender and number in agreement with their argument. Not all determiners are inflected.


=== Numerals ===
===Particle classes===
Norwegian has five closed classes without inflection, i.e. lexical categories with grammatical function and a finite number of members that may not be distinguished by morphological criteria. These are interjections, conjunctions, subjunctions, prepositions, and adverbs. The inclusion of adverbs here requires that traditional adverbs that are inflected in comparison be classified as adjectives, as is sometimes done.

==== Adverbs ====
Adverbs can be formed from adjectives in Norwegian. English usually creates adverbs from adjectives by the suffix &quot;-ly&quot;, like the adverb &quot;beautifully&quot; from the adjective &quot;beautiful.&quot; By comparison, Scandinavian languages usually form adverbs from adjectives by the grammatical neuter singular form of the adjective. This is in general true for both Bokmål and Nynorsk.

Example (Bokmål):

* (&#x27;He is terrible&#x27;)
* (&#x27;It is terrible&#x27;)
* (&#x27;He is terribly slow&#x27;)

In the third sentence, is an adverb. In the first and second sentence and are adjectives and must agree in grammatical gender with the noun.

Another example is the adjective (&#x27;beautiful&#x27;) which exists in both Nynorsk and Bokmål and has the neuter singular form .

Example (Nynorsk):

* (&#x27;She is beautiful&#x27;) 
* (&#x27;It is beautiful&#x27;)
* (&#x27;She sings beautifully&#x27;)

===Compound words===
In Norwegian compound words, the head, i.e. the part determining the compound&#x27;s class, is the last part. If the compound word is constructed from many different nouns, the last noun in the compound noun will determine the gender of the compound noun. Only the first part has primary stress. For instance, the compound (&#x27;think tank&#x27;) has primary stress on the first syllable and is a masculine noun since the noun is masculine.

Compound words are written together in Norwegian, which can cause words to become very long, for example (&#x27;maximum likelihood estimator&#x27;) and (&#x27;human rights organizations&#x27;). Other examples are the title (&#x27;Chief Justice of the Supreme Court&#x27;, originally a combination of &quot;supreme court&quot; and the actual title, &quot;justiciar&quot;) and the translation for &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;.

If they are not written together, each part is naturally read with primary stress, and the meaning of the compound is lost. Examples of this in English are the difference between a green house and a greenhouse or a black board and a blackboard.

This is sometimes forgotten, occasionally with humorous results. Instead of writing, for example, &quot;&quot; (&#x27;lamb chops&#x27;), people make the mistake of writing (&#x27;lame&#x27;, or &#x27;paralyzed&#x27;, &#x27;chops&#x27;). The original message can even be reversed, as when (lit. &#x27;smoke-free&#x27;, meaning no smoking) becomes (&#x27;smoke freely&#x27;).

Other examples include:
* (&#x27;Terrace dies&#x27;) instead of (&#x27;Terrace door&#x27;)
* (&#x27;Tuna bites&#x27;, verb) instead of (&#x27;Tuna bits&#x27;, noun)
* (&#x27;Lard calls&#x27;, verb) instead of (&#x27;Doughnuts&#x27;)
* (&#x27;Theft guaranteed&#x27;) instead of (&#x27;Theft-proof&#x27;)
* (&#x27;Fried chicken lives&#x27;, verb) instead of (&#x27;Fried chicken liver&#x27;, noun)
* (&#x27;Butter bread&#x27;, verb) instead of (&#x27;Sandwich&#x27;)
* (&#x27;Cut fish&#x27;, verb) instead of (&#x27;Clipfish&#x27;)
* (&#x27;On cottage the roof&#x27;) instead of (&#x27;On the cottage roof&#x27;)
* (&#x27;Too Norway&#x27;) instead of (&#x27;Everything for Norway&#x27;, the royal motto of Norway)
These misunderstandings occur because most nouns can be interpreted as verbs or other types of words.
Similar misunderstandings can be achieved in English too. The following are examples of phrases that both in Norwegian and English mean one thing as a compound word, and something different when regarded as separate words:
* (&#x27;spellchecker&#x27;) or (&#x27;spell checker&#x27;)
* (&#x27;cookbook&#x27;) or (&#x27;cook book&#x27;)
* (&#x27;real handmade waffles&#x27;) or (&#x27;real hand made waffles&#x27;)

=== Syntax ===
==== Word order ====
Norwegian syntax is predominantly SVO. The subject occupies the sentence-initial position, followed by the verb and then the object. Like many other Germanic languages, it follows the V2 rule, which means that the finite verb is invariably the second element in a sentence. For example:

* (&#x27;I eat fish &quot;today&quot;&#x27;)
* (&#x27;I want to drink coffee &quot;today&quot;&#x27;)

Exceptions to the rule are embedded clauses and question phrases.

===== Negation =====
Negation in Norwegian is expressed by the word , which literally means &#x27;not&#x27; and is placed after the finite verb. Exceptions are embedded clauses.

* (&#x27;The dog did not return with the ball.&#x27;)
* (&#x27;It was the dog that did not return.&#x27;)

Contractions with the negation, as is accepted in for example English (&quot;cannot&quot;, &quot;hadn&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;didn&#x27;t&quot;) are limited to dialects and colloquial speech. In this case contractions apply to the negation and the verb. Otherwise is applied in similar ways as the English &quot;not&quot; and general negation.

===== Adverbs =====

Adverbs follow the verb they modify. Depending on the type of adverb, the order in which they appear in the phrase is pre-determined. Manner adverbs for example, precede temporal adverbs. Switching the order of these adverbs would not render the phrase ungrammatical, but would make it sound awkward. Compare this to the English phrase &quot;John probably already ate dinner.&quot; Switching the adverbs&#x27; position (&quot;already&quot; and &quot;probably&quot;) to &quot;John already probably ate dinner&quot; is not incorrect, but sounds unnatural. For more information, see Cartographic syntax.

* (&#x27;She sang touchingly beautiful.&#x27;)
* (&#x27;She sang unbelievably loud.&#x27;)

The adverb may precede the verb when the focus of the sentence is shifted. If special attention should be directed on the temporal aspect of the sentence, the adverb can be fronted. Since the V2 rule requires the finite verb to syntactically occupy the second position in the clause, the verb consequently also moves in front of the subject.

* . (Today&quot;, I want&quot;&#x27; to drink coffee.&#x27;)
* . (Today&quot;, I eat&quot;&#x27; fish.&#x27;)

Only one adverb may precede the verb, unless it belongs to a bigger constituent, in which case it does not modify the main verb in the phrase, but is part of the constituent.

* . (&#x27;She ate the soup quickly yesterday.&#x27;)
* . (&#x27;Yesterday she ate the soup quickly.&#x27;)
* , (&#x27;The team that played the best had left the pitch.&#x27;)

===== Adjectives =====
Attributive adjectives always precede the noun that they modify.

* (&#x27;The three big fat heavy red books stood on the shelf.&#x27;)
* (&#x27;The other fortunately long thin key fit&#x27;.)

<text>The history of calculus is fraught with philosophical debates about the meaning and logical validity of fluxions or infinitesimal numbers. The standard way to resolve these debates is to define the operations of calculus using limits rather than infinitesimals. Nonstandard analysis instead reformulates the calculus using a logically rigorous notion of infinitesimal numbers.

Nonstandard analysis originated in the early 1960s by the mathematician Abraham Robinson. He wrote:

... the idea of infinitely small or &quot;infinitesimal&quot; quantities seems to appeal naturally to our intuition. At any rate, the use of infinitesimals was widespread during the formative stages of the Differential and Integral Calculus. As for the objection ... that the distance between two distinct real numbers cannot be infinitely small, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz argued that the theory of infinitesimals implies the introduction of ideal numbers which might be infinitely small or infinitely large compared with the real numbers but which were &quot;to possess the same properties as the latter.&quot;

Robinson argued that this law of continuity of Leibniz&#x27;s is a precursor of the transfer principle. Robinson continued:

However, neither he nor his disciples and successors were able to give a rational development leading up to a system of this sort. As a result, the theory of infinitesimals gradually fell into disrepute and was replaced eventually by the classical theory of limits.

Robinson continues:

... Leibniz&#x27;s ideas can be fully vindicated and ... they lead to a novel and fruitful approach to classical Analysis and to many other branches of mathematics. The key to our method is provided by the detailed analysis of the relation between mathematical languages and mathematical structures which lies at the bottom of contemporary model theory.

In 1973, intuitionist Arend Heyting praised nonstandard analysis as &quot;a standard model of important mathematical research&quot;.

== Introduction ==
A non-zero element of an ordered field formula_1 is infinitesimal if and only if its absolute value is smaller than any element of formula_1 that is of the form formula_3, for formula_4 a standard natural number. Ordered fields that have infinitesimal elements are also called non-Archimedean. More generally, nonstandard analysis is any form of mathematics that relies on nonstandard models and the transfer principle. A field that satisfies the transfer principle for real numbers is called a real closed field, and nonstandard real analysis uses these fields as &quot;nonstandard models&quot; of the real numbers.

Robinson&#x27;s original approach was based on these nonstandard models of the field of real numbers. His classic foundational book on the subject &quot;Nonstandard Analysis&quot; was published in 1966 and is still in print. On page 88, Robinson writes:

The existence of nonstandard models of arithmetic was discovered by Thoralf Skolem (1934). Skolem&#x27;s method foreshadows the ultrapower construction [...]

Several technical issues must be addressed to develop a calculus of infinitesimals. For example, it is not enough to construct an ordered field with infinitesimals. See the article Hyperreal number for a discussion of some of the relevant ideas.

== Basic definitions ==
In this section we outline one of the simplest approaches to defining a hyperreal field formula_5. Let formula_6 be the field of real numbers, and let formula_7 be the semiring of natural numbers. Denote by formula_8 the set of sequences of real numbers. A field formula_5 is defined as a suitable quotient of formula_10, as follows. Take a nonprincipal ultrafilter formula_11. In particular, formula_12 contains the Fréchet filter. Consider a pair of sequences

:formula_13

We say that formula_14 and formula_15 are equivalent if they coincide on a set of indices that is a member of the ultrafilter, or in formulas:

:formula_16

The quotient of formula_10 by the resulting equivalence relation is a hyperreal field formula_5, a situation summarized by the formula formula_19.

== Motivation ==
There are at least three reasons to consider nonstandard analysis: historical, pedagogical, and technical.

=== Historical ===
Much of the earliest development of the infinitesimal calculus by Newton and Leibniz was formulated using expressions such as &quot;infinitesimal number&quot; and &quot;vanishing quantity&quot;. These formulations were widely criticized by George Berkeley and others. The challenge of developing a consistent and satisfactory theory of analysis using infinitesimals was first met by Abraham Robinson.

In 1958 Curt Schmieden and Detlef Laugwitz published an article &quot;Eine Erweiterung der Infinitesimalrechnung&quot; (&quot;An Extension of Infinitesimal Calculus&quot;) which proposed a construction of a ring containing infinitesimals. The ring was constructed from sequences of real numbers. Two sequences were considered equivalent if they differed only in a finite number of elements. Arithmetic operations were defined elementwise. However, the ring constructed in this way contains zero divisors and thus cannot be a field.

=== Pedagogical ===
H. Jerome Keisler, David Tall, and other educators maintain that the use of infinitesimals is more intuitive and more easily grasped by students than the &quot;epsilon–delta&quot; approach to analytic concepts. This approach can sometimes provide easier proofs of results than the corresponding epsilon–delta formulation of the proof. Much of the simplification comes from applying very easy rules of nonstandard arithmetic, as follows:

::infinitesimal × finite = infinitesimal

::infinitesimal + infinitesimal = infinitesimal

together with the transfer principle (discussed further below).

Another pedagogical application of nonstandard analysis is Edward Nelson&#x27;s treatment of the theory of stochastic processes.

=== Technical ===
Some recent work has been done in analysis using concepts from nonstandard analysis, particularly in investigating limiting processes of statistics and mathematical physics. Sergio Albeverio et al. discuss some of these applications.

== Approaches ==
There are two, main, different approaches to nonstandard analysis: the semantic or model-theoretic approach and the syntactic approach. Both of these approaches apply to other areas of mathematics beyond analysis, including number theory, algebra and topology.

Robinson&#x27;s original formulation of nonstandard analysis falls into the category of the &quot;semantic approach&quot;. As developed by him in his papers, it is based on studying models (in particular saturated models) of a theory. Since Robinson&#x27;s work first appeared, a simpler semantic approach (due to Elias Zakon) has been developed using purely set-theoretic objects called superstructures. In this approach &quot;a model of a theory&quot; is replaced by an object called a &quot;superstructure&quot; over a set . Starting from a superstructure one constructs another object using the ultrapower construction together with a mapping that satisfies the transfer principle. The map * relates formal properties of and . Moreover, it is possible to consider a simpler form of saturation called countable saturation. This simplified approach is also more suitable for use by mathematicians who are not specialists in model theory or logic.

The &quot;syntactic approach&quot; requires much less logic and model theory to understand and use. This approach was developed in the mid-1970s by the mathematician Edward Nelson. Nelson introduced an entirely axiomatic formulation of nonstandard analysis that he called internal set theory (IST). IST is an extension of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZF) in that alongside the basic binary membership relation ∈, it introduces a new unary predicate &quot;standard&quot;, which can be applied to elements of the mathematical universe together with some axioms for reasoning with this new predicate.

Syntactic nonstandard analysis requires a great deal of care in applying the principle of set formation (formally known as the axiom of comprehension), which mathematicians usually take for granted. As Nelson points out, a fallacy in reasoning in IST is that of &quot;illegal set formation&quot;. For instance, there is no set in IST whose elements are precisely the standard integers (here &quot;standard&quot; is understood in the sense of the new predicate). To avoid illegal set formation, one must only use predicates of ZFC to define subsets.

Another example of the syntactic approach is the Vopěnka&#x27;s alternative set theory, which tries to find set-theory axioms more compatible with the nonstandard analysis than the axioms of ZF.

== Robinson&#x27;s book ==
Abraham Robinson&#x27;s book &quot;Non-standard Analysis&quot; was published in 1966. Some of the topics developed in the book were already present in his 1961 article by the same title (Robinson 1961). In addition to containing the first full treatment of nonstandard analysis, the book contains a detailed historical section where Robinson challenges some of the received opinions on the history of mathematics based on the pre–nonstandard analysis perception of infinitesimals as inconsistent entities. Thus, Robinson challenges the idea that Augustin-Louis Cauchy&#x27;s &quot;sum theorem&quot; in Cours d&#x27;Analyse concerning the convergence of a series of continuous functions was incorrect, and proposes an infinitesimal-based interpretation of its hypothesis that results in a correct theorem.

== Invariant subspace problem ==
Abraham Robinson and Allen Bernstein used nonstandard analysis to prove that every polynomially compact linear operator on a Hilbert space has an invariant subspace.

Given an operator on Hilbert space , consider the orbit of a point in under the iterates of . Applying Gram–Schmidt one obtains an orthonormal basis for . Let be the corresponding nested sequence of &quot;coordinate&quot; subspaces of . The matrix expressing with respect to is almost upper triangular, in the sense that the coefficients are the only nonzero sub-diagonal coefficients. Bernstein and Robinson show that if is polynomially compact, then there is a hyperfinite index such that the matrix coefficient is infinitesimal. Next, consider the subspace of . If in has finite norm, then is infinitely close to .

Now let be the operator formula_20 acting on , where is the orthogonal projection to . Denote by the polynomial such that is compact. The subspace is internal of hyperfinite dimension. By transferring upper triangularisation of operators of finite-dimensional complex vector space, there is an internal orthonormal Hilbert space basis for where runs from to , such that each of the corresponding -dimensional subspaces is -invariant. Denote by the projection to the subspace . For a nonzero vector of finite norm in , one can assume that is nonzero, or to fix ideas. Since is a compact operator, is infinitely close to and therefore one has also . Now let be the greatest index such that formula_21. Then the space of all standard elements infinitely close to is the desired invariant subspace.

Upon reading a preprint of the Bernstein and Robinson paper, Paul Halmos reinterpreted their proof using standard techniques. Both papers appeared back-to-back in the same issue of the &quot;Pacific Journal of Mathematics&quot;. Some of the ideas used in Halmos&#x27; proof reappeared many years later in Halmos&#x27; own work on quasi-triangular operators.

== Other applications ==
Other results were received along the line of reinterpreting or reproving previously known results. Of particular interest is Teturo Kamae&#x27;s proof of the individual ergodic theorem or L. van den Dries and Alex Wilkie&#x27;s treatment of Gromov&#x27;s theorem on groups of polynomial growth. Nonstandard analysis was used by Larry Manevitz and Shmuel Weinberger to prove a result in algebraic topology.

The real contributions of nonstandard analysis lie however in the concepts and theorems that utilize the new extended language of nonstandard set theory. Among the list of new applications in mathematics there are new approaches to probability,
hydrodynamics, measure theory, nonsmooth and harmonic analysis, etc.

There are also applications of nonstandard analysis to the theory of stochastic processes, particularly constructions of Brownian motion as random walks. Albeverio et al. have an introduction to this area of research.

In terms of axiomatics, Boffa’s superuniversality axiom has found application as a basis for axiomatic nonstandard analysis.

=== Applications to calculus ===
As an application to mathematical education, H. Jerome Keisler wrote &quot;Elementary Calculus: An Infinitesimal Approach&quot;. Covering nonstandard calculus, it develops differential and integral calculus using the hyperreal numbers, which include infinitesimal elements. These applications of nonstandard analysis depend on the existence of the &quot;standard part&quot; of a finite hyperreal . The standard part of , denoted , is a standard real number infinitely close to . One of the visualization devices Keisler uses is that of an imaginary infinite-magnification microscope to distinguish points infinitely close together.

== Critique ==

Despite the elegance and appeal of some aspects of nonstandard analysis, criticisms have been voiced, as well, such as those by Errett Bishop, Alain Connes, and Paul Halmos.

== Logical framework ==
Given any set , the &quot;superstructure&quot; over a set is the set defined by the conditions

:formula_22
:formula_23
:formula_24

Thus the superstructure over is obtained by starting from and iterating the operation of adjoining the power set of and taking the union of the resulting sequence. The superstructure over the real numbers includes a wealth of mathematical structures: For instance, it contains isomorphic copies of all separable metric spaces and metrizable topological vector spaces. Virtually all of mathematics that interests an analyst goes on within .

The working view of nonstandard analysis is a set and a mapping that satisfies some additional properties. To formulate these principles we first state some definitions.

A formula has &quot;bounded quantification&quot; if and only if the only quantifiers that occur in the formula have range restricted over sets, that is are all of the form:

:formula_25
:formula_26

For example, the formula

:formula_27

has bounded quantification, the universally quantified variable ranges over , the existentially quantified variable ranges over the powerset of . On the other hand,

:formula_28

does not have bounded quantification because the quantification of &quot;y&quot; is unrestricted.

== Internal sets ==
A set &quot;x&quot; is &quot;internal&quot; if and only if &quot;x&quot; is an element of *&quot;A&quot; for some element &quot;A&quot; of . *&quot;A&quot; itself is internal if &quot;A&quot; belongs to .

We now formulate the basic logical framework of nonstandard analysis:
* &quot;Extension principle&quot;: The mapping * is the identity on .
* &quot;Transfer principle&quot;: For any formula with bounded quantification and with free variables , and for any elements of , the following equivalence holds:

::formula_29

* &quot;Countable saturation&quot;: If {&quot;A&quot;&quot;k&quot;}&quot;k&quot; ∈ N is a decreasing sequence of nonempty internal sets, with &quot;k&quot; ranging over the natural numbers, then

::formula_30

One can show using ultraproducts that such a map * exists. Elements of are called &quot;standard&quot;. Elements of are called hyperreal numbers.

== First consequences ==
The symbol denotes the nonstandard natural numbers. By the extension principle, this is a superset of . The set is nonempty. To see this, apply countable saturation to the sequence of internal sets

:formula_31

The sequence has a nonempty intersection, proving the result.

We begin with some definitions: Hyperreals &quot;r&quot;, &quot;s&quot; are &quot;infinitely close&quot; if and only if

:formula_32

A hyperreal is &quot;infinitesimal&quot; if and only if it is infinitely close to 0. For example, if is a hyperinteger, i.e. an element of , then is an infinitesimal. A hyperreal is &quot;limited&quot; (or &quot;finite&quot;) if and only if its absolute value is dominated by (less than) a standard integer. The limited hyperreals form a subring of containing the reals. In this ring, the infinitesimal hyperreals are an ideal.

The set of limited hyperreals or the set of infinitesimal hyperreals are &quot;external&quot; subsets of ; what this means in practice is that bounded quantification, where the bound is an internal set, never ranges over these sets.

Example: The plane with and ranging over is internal, and is a model of plane Euclidean geometry. The plane with and restricted to limited values (analogous to the Dehn plane) is external, and in this limited plane the parallel postulate is violated. For example, any line passing through the point on the -axis and having infinitesimal slope is parallel to the -axis.

Theorem. For any limited hyperreal there is a unique standard real denoted infinitely close to . The mapping is a ring homomorphism from the ring of limited hyperreals to .

The mapping st is also external.

One way of thinking of the standard part of a hyperreal, is in terms of Dedekind cuts; any limited hyperreal defines a cut by considering the pair of sets where is the set of standard rationals less than and is the set of standard rationals greater than . The real number corresponding to can be seen to satisfy the condition of being the standard part of .

One intuitive characterization of continuity is as follows:

Theorem. A real-valued function on the interval is continuous if and only if for every hyperreal in the interval , we have: .

Similarly,

Theorem. A real-valued function is differentiable at the real value if and only if for every infinitesimal hyperreal number , the value

:formula_33

exists and is independent of {{mvar|h}}. In this case {{math|&quot;f&quot;′(&quot;x&quot;)}} is a real number and is the derivative of {{mvar|f}} at {{mvar|x}}.

== {{mvar|κ}}-saturation ==
It is possible to &quot;improve&quot; the saturation by allowing collections of higher cardinality to be intersected. A model is {{mvar|κ}}-saturated if whenever formula_34 is a collection of internal sets with the finite intersection property and formula_35,
::formula_36

This is useful, for instance, in a topological space {{mvar|X}}, where we may want {{math|{{!}}2&quot;X&quot;{{!}}}}-saturation to ensure the intersection of a standard neighborhood base is nonempty.

For any cardinal {{mvar|κ}}, a {{mvar|κ}}-saturated extension can be constructed.
