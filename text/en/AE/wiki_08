<text>Maximilian Raoul Steiner (10 May 1888 – 28 December 1971) was an Austrian composer and conductor who emigrated to America and became one of Hollywood&#x27;s greatest musical composers.

Steiner was a child prodigy who conducted his first operetta when he was twelve and became a full-time professional, proficient at composing, arranging, and conducting, by the time he was fifteen. Threatened with internment in England during World War I, he fled to Broadway; and in 1929 he moved to Hollywood, where he became one of the first composers to write music scores for films. He is often referred to as &quot;the father of film music&quot;, as Steiner played a major part in creating the tradition of writing music for films, along with composers Dimitri Tiomkin, Erich Wolfgang Korngold, Franz Waxman, Alfred Newman, Bernard Herrmann, and Miklós Rózsa.

Steiner composed over 300 film scores with RKO Pictures and Warner Bros., and was nominated for 24 Academy Awards, winning three: &quot;The Informer&quot; (1935); &quot;Now, Voyager&quot; (1942); and &quot;Since You Went Away&quot; (1944). Besides his Oscar-winning scores, some of Steiner&#x27;s popular works include &quot;King Kong&quot; (1933), &quot;Little Women&quot; (1933), &quot;Jezebel&quot; (1938), and &quot;Casablanca&quot; (1942), though he did not compose its love theme, &quot;As Time Goes By&quot;. In addition, Steiner scored &quot;The Searchers&quot; (1956), &quot;A Summer Place&quot; (1959), and &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939), which ranked second on the AFI&#x27;s list of best American film scores, and is the film score for which he is best known.

He was also the first recipient of the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score, which he won for his score for &quot;Life with Father&quot;. Steiner was a frequent collaborator with some of the best known film directors in history, including Michael Curtiz, John Ford, and William Wyler, and scored many of the films with Errol Flynn, Bette Davis, Humphrey Bogart, and Fred Astaire. Many of his film scores are available as separate soundtrack recordings.

==Biography==
===Early years (1888–1907)===
Max Steiner was born on 10 May 1888, in Vienna, Austria-Hungary, as the only child in a wealthy business and theatrical family of Jewish heritage. He was named after his paternal grandfather, Maximilian Steiner (1839–1880), who was credited with first persuading Johann Strauss II to write for the theater, and was the influential manager of Vienna&#x27;s historic Theater an der Wien. His parents were Marie Josefine/Mirjam (Hasiba) and Hungarian-Jewish (1858–1944, born in Temesvár, Kingdom of Hungary, Austrian Empire), a Viennese impresario, carnival exposition manager, and inventor, responsible for building the Wiener Riesenrad. His father encouraged Steiner&#x27;s musical talent, and allowed him to conduct an American operetta at the age of twelve, &quot;The Belle of New York&quot;, which allowed Steiner to gain early recognition by the operetta&#x27;s author, Gustave Kerker. Steiner&#x27;s mother Marie was a dancer in stage productions put on by his grandfather when she was young, but later became involved in the restaurant business. His godfather was the composer Richard Strauss who strongly influenced Steiner&#x27;s future work. Steiner often credited his family for inspiring his early musical abilities. As early as six years old, Steiner was taking three or four piano lessons a week, yet often became bored with the lessons. Because of this, he would practice improvising on his own, his father encouraging him to write his music down. Steiner cited his early improvisation as an influence of his taste in music, particularly his interest in the music of Claude Debussy which was &quot;avant garde&quot; for the time. In his youth, he began his composing career through his work on marches for regimental bands and hit songs for a show put on by his father.

Steiner&#x27;s parents sent him to the Vienna University of Technology, but he expressed little interest in scholastic subjects. He enrolled in the Imperial Academy of Music in 1904, where, due to his precocious musical talents and private tutoring by Robert Fuchs, and Gustav Mahler, he completed a four-year course in only one year, winning himself a gold medal from the academy at the age of fifteen. He studied various instruments including violin, double bass, organ, and trumpet. His preferred and best instrument was the piano, but he acknowledged the importance of being familiar with what the other instruments could do. He also had courses in harmony, counterpoint, and composition. Along with Mahler and Fuchs, he cited his teachers as Felix Weingartner and Edmund Eysler.

===Beginning music career (1907–1914)===
The music of Edmund Eysler was an early influence in the pieces of Max Steiner; however, one of his first introductions to operettas was by Franz Lehár who worked for a time as a military bandmaster for Steiner&#x27;s father&#x27;s theatre. Steiner paid tribute to Lehár through an operetta modeled after Lehár&#x27;s &quot;Die lustige Witwe&quot; which Steiner staged in 1907 in Vienna. Eysler was well known for his operettas though as critiqued by Richard Traubner, the libretti were poor, with a fairly simple style, the music often relying too heavily on the Viennese waltz style. As a result, when Steiner started writing pieces for the theater, he was interested in writing libretto as his teacher had, but had minimal success. However, many of his future film scores such as &quot;Dark Victory&quot; (1939), &quot;In This Our Life&quot; (1941), and &quot;Now, Voyager&quot; (1942) had frequent waltz melodies as influenced by Eysler. According to author of &quot;Max Steiner&#x27;s &quot;Now, Voyager&quot;&quot; Kate Daubney, Steiner may also have been influenced by Felix Weingartner who conducted the Vienna Opera from 1908 to 1911. Although he took composition classes from Weingartner, as a young boy, Steiner always wanted to be a great conductor.

Between 1907 and 1914, Steiner traveled between Britain and Europe to work on theatrical productions. Steiner first entered the world of professional music when he was fifteen. He wrote and conducted the operetta &quot;The Beautiful Greek Girl&quot;, but his father refused to stage it saying it was not good enough. Steiner took the composition to competing impresario Carl Tuschl who offered to produce it. Much to Steiner&#x27;s pleasure, it ran in the Orpheum Theatre for a year. This led to opportunities to conduct other shows in various cities around the world, including Moscow and Hamburg. Upon returning to Vienna, Steiner found his father in bankruptcy. Having difficulties finding work, he moved to London (in part to follow an English showgirl he had met in Vienna). In London, he was invited to conduct Lehar&#x27;s &quot;The Merry Widow&quot;. He stayed in London for eight years conducting musicals at Daly&#x27;s Theatre, the Adelphi, the Hippodrome, the London Pavilion, and the Blackpool Winter Gardens. Steiner married Beatrice Tilt on September 12, 1912. The exact date of their divorce is unknown.

In England, Steiner wrote and conducted theater productions and symphonies. But the beginning of World War I in 1914 led him to be interned as an enemy alien. Fortunately, he was befriended by the Duke of Westminster, who was a fan of his work, and was given exit papers to go to America, although his money was impounded. He arrived in New York City in December 1914, with only $32. Unable to find work, he resorted to menial jobs such as a copyist for Harms Music Publishing, which quickly led him to jobs orchestrating stage musicals.

===Broadway music (1914–1929)===
In New York, Max Steiner quickly acquired employment and worked for fifteen years as a musical director, arranger, orchestrator, and conductor of Broadway productions. These productions include operettas and musicals written by Victor Herbert, Jerome Kern, Vincent Youmans, and George Gershwin, among others. Steiner&#x27;s credits include: &quot;George White&#x27;s Scandals&quot; (1922) (director), &quot;Peaches&quot; (1923) (composer), and &quot;Lady, Be Good&quot; (1924) (conductor and orchestrator). At twenty-seven years old, Steiner became Fox Film&#x27;s musical director in 1915. At the time, there was no specially written music for films and Steiner told studio founder William Fox his idea to write an original score for &quot;The Bondman&quot; (1916). Fox agreed and they put together a 110-piece orchestra to accompany the screenings. During his time working on Broadway, he married Audree van Lieu on 27 April 1927. They divorced on 14 December 1933. In 1927, Steiner orchestrated and conducted Harry Tierney&#x27;s &quot;Rio Rita&quot;. Tierney himself later requested RKO Pictures in Hollywood hire Steiner to work in their music production departments. William LeBaron, RKO&#x27;s head of production, traveled to New York to watch Steiner conduct and was impressed by Steiner and his musicians, who each played several instruments. Eventually, Steiner became a Hollywood asset. Steiner&#x27;s final production on Broadway was &quot;Sons O&#x27; Guns&quot; in 1929.

===Scoring for RKO (1929–1937)===
By request of Harry Tierney, RKO hired Max Steiner as an orchestrator and his first film job consisted of composing music for the main and end titles and occasional &quot;on screen&quot; music. According to Steiner, the general opinion of filmmakers during the time was that film music was a &quot;necessary evil&quot;, and would often slow down production and release of the film after it was filmed. Steiner&#x27;s first job was for the film &quot;Dixiana&quot;; however, after a while, RKO decided to let him go, feeling they were not using him. His agent found him a job as a musical director on an operetta in Atlantic City. Before he left RKO, they offered him a month to month contract as the head of the music department with promise of more work in the future and he agreed. Because the few composers in Hollywood were unavailable, Steiner composed his first film score for &quot;Cimarron&quot;. The score was well received and was partially credited for the success of the film. He turned down several offers to teach film scoring technique in Moscow and Peking in order to stay in Hollywood. In 1932, Steiner was asked by David O. Selznick, the new producer at RKO, to add music to &quot;Symphony of Six Million&quot;. Steiner composed a short segment; Selznick liked it so much that he asked him to compose the theme and underscoring for the entire picture. Selznick was proud of the film, feeling it gave a realistic view of Jewish family life and tradition. &quot;Music until then had not been used very much for underscoring&quot;. Steiner &quot;pioneered the use of original composition as background scoring for films&quot;. The successful scoring in &quot;Symphony of Six Million&quot; was a turning point for Steiner&#x27;s career and for the film industry. Steiner reflected that a large part of the success of &quot;Symphony of Six Million&quot; &quot;was attributed to the extensive use of music&quot; in the film.

The score for &quot;King Kong&quot; (1933) became Steiner&#x27;s breakthrough and represented a paradigm shift in the scoring of fantasy and adventure films. The score was an integral part of the film, because it added realism to an unrealistic film plot. The studio&#x27;s bosses were initially skeptical about the need for an original score; however, since they disliked the film&#x27;s contrived special effects, they let Steiner try to improve the film with music. The studio suggested using old tracks in order to save on the cost of the film; however, &quot;King Kong&quot; producer Merian C. Cooper asked Steiner to score the film and said he would pay for the orchestra. Steiner took advantage of this offer and used an eighty-piece orchestra, explaining the film &quot;was made for music&quot;. According to Steiner, &quot;it was the kind of film that allowed you to do anything and everything, from weird chords and dissonances to pretty melodies.&quot; Steiner additionally scored the wild tribal music which accompanied the ceremony to sacrifice Ann to Kong. He wrote the score in two weeks and the music recording cost around $50,000. The film became a &quot;landmark of film scoring&quot;, as it showed the power music has to manipulate audience emotions. Steiner constructed the score on Wagnerian leitmotif principle, which calls for special themes for leading characters and concepts. The theme of the monster is recognizable as a descending three-note chromatic motif. After the death of King Kong, the Kong theme and the Fay Wray theme converge, underlining the &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; type relationship between the characters. The music in the film&#x27;s finale helped express the tender feelings Kong had for the woman without the film having to explicitly state it. The majority of the music is heavy and loud, but some of the music is a bit lighter. For example, when the ship sails into Skull Island, Steiner keeps the music calm and quiet with a small amount of texture in the harps to help characterize the ship as it cautiously moves through the misty waters. Steiner received a bonus from his work, as Cooper credited 25 percent of the film&#x27;s success to the film score. Before he died, Steiner admitted &quot;King Kong&quot; was one of his favorite scores.

&quot;King Kong&quot; quickly made Steiner one of the most respected names in Hollywood. He continued as RKO&#x27;s music director for two more years, until 1936. Max married Louise Klos, a harpist, in 1936. They had a son, Ron, together and they divorced in 1946. Steiner composed, arranged and conducted another 55 films, including three of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers&#x27; dance musicals. Additionally, Steiner wrote a sonata used in Katharine Hepburn&#x27;s first film, &quot;Bill of Divorcement&quot; (1932). RKO producers, including Selznick, often came to him when they had problems with films, treating him as if he were a music &quot;doctor&quot;. Steiner was asked to compose a score for &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot; (1934), which originally lacked music. He added musical touches to significant scenes. Director John Ford called on Steiner to score his film, &quot;The Lost Patrol&quot; (1934), which lacked tension without music.

John Ford hired Steiner again to compose for his next film, &quot;The Informer&quot; (1935), before Ford began production of the film. Ford even asked his screenwriter to meet with Steiner during the writing phase to collaborate. This was unusual for Steiner who typically refused to compose a score from anything earlier than a rough cut of the film. Because Steiner scored the music before and during film production, Ford would sometimes shoot scenes in synchronization with the music Steiner composed rather than the usual practice of film composers synchronizing music to the film&#x27;s scenes. Consequently, Steiner directly influenced the development of the protagonist, Gypo. Victor McLaglen, who played Gypo, rehearsed his walking in order to match the fumbling leitmotif Steiner had created for Gypo. This unique film production practice was successful; the film was nominated for six Academy Awards and won four, including Steiner&#x27;s first Academy Award for Best Scoring. This score helped to exemplify Steiner&#x27;s ability to encompass the essence of a film in a single theme. The main title of the film&#x27;s soundtrack has three specific aspects. First, the heavy-march-like theme helps to describe the oppressive military and main character Gypo&#x27;s inevitable downfall. Second, the character&#x27;s theme is stern and sober and puts the audience into the correct mood for the film. Finally, the theme of the music contains some Irish folk song influences which serves to better characterize the Irish historical setting and influence of the film. The theme is not heard consistently throughout the film and serves rather as a framework for the other melodic motifs heard throughout different parts of the film.

The score for this film is made up of many different themes which characterize the different personages and situations in the film. Steiner helps portray the genuine love Katie has for the main character Gypo. In one scene, Katie calls after Gypo as a solo violin echos the falling cadence of her voice. In another scene, Gypo sees an advertisement for a steamship to America and instead of the advertisement, sees himself holding Katie&#x27;s hand on the ship. Wedding bells are heard along with organ music and he sees Katie wearing a veil and holding a bouquet. In a later scene, the Katie theme plays as a drunk Gypo sees a beautiful woman at the bar, insinuating he had mistaken her for Katie. Other musical themes included in the film score are an Irish folk song on French horns for Frankie McPhilip, a warm string theme for Dan and Gallagher and Mary McPhillip, and a sad theme on English horn with harp for the blind man.The most important motif in the film is the theme of betrayal relating to how Gypo betrays his friend Frankie: the &quot;blood-money&quot; motif. The theme is heard as the Captain throws the money on the table after Frankie is killed. The theme is a four note descending tune on harp; the first interval is the tritone. As the men are deciding who will be the executioner, the motif is repeated quietly and perpetually to establish Gypo&#x27;s guilt and the musical motif is synchronized with the dripping of water in the prison. As it appears in the end of the film, the theme is played at a fortissimo volume as Gypo staggers into the church, ending the climax with the clap of the cymbals, indicating Gypo&#x27;s penitence, no longer needing to establish his guilt.

Silent film mannerisms are still seen in Steiner&#x27;s composition such as when actions or consequences are accompanied by a &quot;sforzato&quot; chord immediately before it, followed by silence. An example of this is remarked in the part of the film when Frankie confronts Gypo looking at his reward for arrest poster. Steiner uses minor &quot;Mickey Mousing&quot; techniques in the film. Through this score, Steiner showed the potential of film music, as he attempted the show the internal struggles inside of Gypo&#x27;s mind through the mixing of different themes such as the Irish &quot;Circassian Circle&quot;, the &quot;blood-money&quot; motif, and Frankie&#x27;s theme. The score concludes with an original &quot;Sancta Maria&quot; by Steiner. Some writers have erroneously referred to the cue as featuring Franz Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Ave Maria&quot;.

In 1937, Steiner was hired by Frank Capra to conduct Dimitri Tiomkin&#x27;s score for &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; (1937) as a safeguard in case Steiner needed to rewrite the score by an inexperienced Tiomkin; however, according to Hugo Friedhofer, Tiomkin specifically asked for Steiner, preferring him over the film studio&#x27;s then music director. Selznick set up his own production company in 1936 and recruited Steiner to write the scores for his next three films.

=== Composing for Warner Bros. (1937–1953) ===
In April 1937, Steiner left RKO and signed a long-term contract with Warner Bros.; he would, however, continue to work for Selznick. The first film he scored for Warner Bros. was &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot; (1936). Steiner became a mainstay at Warner Bros., scoring 140 of their films over the next 30 years alongside Hollywood stars such as Bette Davis, Errol Flynn, Humphrey Bogart, and James Cagney. Steiner frequently worked with composer Hugo Friedhofer who was hired as an orchestrator for Warner Bros; Friedholfer would orchestrate more than 50 of Steiner&#x27;s pieces during his career. In 1938, Steiner wrote and arranged the first &quot;composed for film&quot; piece, &quot;Symphony Moderne&quot; which a character plays on the piano and later plays as a theme in &quot;Four Daughters&quot; (1938) and is performed by a full orchestra in &quot;Four Wives&quot; (1939).
In 1939, Steiner was borrowed from Warner Bros. by Selznick to compose the score for &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939), which became one of Steiner&#x27;s most notable successes. Steiner was the only composer Selznick considered for scoring the film. Steiner was given only three months to complete the score, despite composing twelve more film scores in 1939, more than he would in any other year of his career. Because Selznick was concerned Steiner wouldn&#x27;t have enough time to finish the score, he had Franz Waxman write an additional score in the case the Steiner didn&#x27;t finish. To meet the deadline, Steiner sometimes worked for 20-hours straight, assisted by doctor-administered Benzedrine to stay awake. When the film was released, it was the longest film score ever composed, nearly three hours. The composition consisted of 16 main themes and nearly 300 musical segments. Due to the score&#x27;s length, Steiner had help from four orchestrators and arrangers, including Heinz Roemheld, to work on the score. Selznick had asked Steiner to use only pre-existing classical music to help cut down on cost and time, but Steiner tried to convince him that filling the picture with swatches of classic concert music or popular works would not be as effective as an original score, which could be used to heighten the emotional content of scenes. Steiner ignored Selznick&#x27;s wishes and composed an entirely new score. Selznick&#x27;s opinion about using original scoring may have changed due to the overwhelming reaction to the film, nearly all of which contained Steiner&#x27;s music. A year later, he even wrote a letter emphasizing the value of original film scores. The most well known of Steiner&#x27;s themes for the score is the &quot;Tara&quot; theme for the O&#x27;Hara family plantation. Steiner explains Scarlett&#x27;s deep-founded love for her home is why &quot;the &#x27;Tara&#x27; theme begins and ends with the picture and permeates the entire score&quot;. The film went on to win ten Academy Awards, although not for Best Original Score, which instead went to Herbert Stothart for &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. The score of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; is ranked #2 by AFI as the second greatest American film score of all time.

&quot;Now, Voyager&quot; would be the film score for which Steiner would win his second Academy Award. Kate Daubney attributes the success of this score to Steiner&#x27;s ability to &quot;[balance] the scheme of thematic meaning with the sound of the music.&quot; Steiner used motifs and thematic elements in the music to emphasize the emotional development of the narrative. After finishing &quot;Now, Voyager&quot; (1942), Steiner was hired to score the music for &quot;Casablanca&quot; (1942). Steiner would typically wait until the film was edited before scoring it, and after watching &quot;Casablanca&quot;, he decided the song &quot;As Time Goes By&quot; by Herman Hupfeld wasn&#x27;t an appropriate addition to the movie and he wanted to replace it with a song of his own composition; however, Ingrid Bergman had just cut her hair short in preparation for filming &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; (1943), so she couldn&#x27;t re-film the section with Steiner&#x27;s song. Stuck with &quot;As Time Goes By&quot;, Steiner embraced the song and made it the center theme of his score. Steiner&#x27;s score for &quot;Casablanca&quot; was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture, losing to &quot;The Song of Bernadette&quot; (1943). Steiner received his third and final Oscar in 1944 for &quot;Since You Went Away&quot; (1944). Steiner actually first composed the theme from &quot;Since You Went Away&quot; while helping counterbalance Franz Waxman&#x27;s moody score for &quot;Rebecca&quot;. Producer David O. Selznick liked the theme so much, he asked Steiner to include it in &quot;Since You Went Away&quot;. In 1947, Max married Leonette Blair.

Steiner also found success with the film noir genre. &quot;The Big Sleep&quot;, &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot;, and &quot;The Letter&quot; were his best film noir scores of the 1940s. &quot;The Letter&quot; is set in Singapore, the tale of murder begins with the loud main musical theme during the credits, which sets the tense and violent mood of the film. The main theme characterizes Leslie, the main character, by her tragic passion. The main theme is heard in the confrontation between Leslie and the murdered man&#x27;s wife in the Chinese shop. Steiner portrays this scene through the jangling of wind chimes which crescendos as the wife emerges through opium smoke. The jangling continues until the wife asks Leslie to take off her shawl, after which the theme blasts indicating the breaking point of emotions of these women. Steiner&#x27;s score for &quot;The Letter&quot; was nominated for the 1941 Academy Award for Best Original Score, losing to Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Pinocchio&quot;. In the score for &quot;The Big Sleep&quot;, Steiner uses musical thematic characterization for the characters in the film. The theme for Philip Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart) is beguiling and ironic, with a playful grace note at the end of the motif, portrayed mixed between major and minor. At the end of the film, his theme is played fully in major chords and finishes by abruptly ending the chord as the film terminates (this was an unusual film music practice in Hollywood at the time). According to Christopher Palmer, the love theme for Bogart&#x27;s Philip and Lauren Bacall&#x27;s Vivian is one of Steiner&#x27;s strongest themes. Steiner uses the contrast of high strings and low strings and brass to emphasize Philip&#x27;s feelings for Vivian opposed with the brutality of the criminal world.In 1947, Steiner scored a film noir Western, &quot;Pursued&quot;.

Steiner had more success with the Western genre of film, writing the scores for over twenty large-scale Westerns, most with epic-inspiring scores &quot;about empire building and progress&quot;, like &quot;Dodge City&quot; (1939), &quot;The Oklahoma Kid&quot; (1939), and &quot;Virginia City&quot; (1940). &quot;Dodge City&quot;, starring Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland, is a good example of Steiner&#x27;s handling of typical scenes of the Western genre. Steiner used a &quot;lifting, loping melody&quot; which reflected the movement and sounds of wagons, horses, and cattle. Steiner showed a love for combining Westerns and romance, as he did in &quot;They Died with Their Boots On&quot; (1941), also starring Flynn and de Havilland. &quot;The Searchers&quot; (1956) is, today, considered his greatest Western.

===Later works (1953–1965)===
Although his contract ended in 1953, Steiner returned to Warner Bros. in 1958 and scored several films such as &quot;Band of Angels&quot;, &quot;Marjorie Morningstar&quot;, and &quot;John Paul Jones&quot;, and later ventured into television. Steiner still preferred large orchestras and leitmotif techniques during this part of his career. Steiner&#x27;s pace slowed significantly in the mid-1950s, and he began freelancing. In 1954, RCA Victor asked Steiner to prepare and conduct an orchestral suite of music from &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; for a special LP, which was later issued on CD. There are also acetates of Steiner conducting the Warner Brothers studio orchestra in music from many of his film scores. Composer Victor Young and Steiner were good friends, and Steiner completed the film score for &quot;China Gate&quot;, because Young had died before he could finish it. The credit frame reads: &quot;Music by Victor Young, extended by his old friend, Max Steiner.&quot; There are numerous soundtrack recordings of Steiner&#x27;s music as soundtracks, collections, and recordings by others. Steiner wrote into his seventies, ailing and near blind, but his compositions &quot;revealed a freshness and fertility of invention.&quot; A theme for &quot;A Summer Place&quot; in 1959, written when Steiner was 71, became one of Warner Brothers&#x27; biggest hit-tunes for years and a re-recorded pop standard. This memorable instrumental theme spent nine weeks at #1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart in 1960 (in an instrumental cover version by Percy Faith). Steiner continued to score films produced by Warner until the mid-sixties.

In 1963, Steiner began writing his autobiography. Although it was completed, it was never published, and is the only source available on Steiner&#x27;s childhood. A copy of the manuscript resides with the rest of the Max Steiner Collection at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. Steiner scored his last piece in 1965; however, he claimed he would have scored more films had he been offered the opportunity. His lack of work in the last years of his life was due to Hollywood&#x27;s decreased interest in his scores caused by new film producers and new taste in film music. Another contribution to his declining career was his failing eyesight and deteriorating health, which caused him to reluctantly retire. Tony Thomas cited Steiner&#x27;s last score as, &quot;a weak coda to a mighty career.&quot;

Steiner died of congestive heart failure in Hollywood, aged 83. He is entombed in the Great Mausoleum at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.

==Methods of composing==
===Music as background to dialogue===
In the early days of sound, producers avoided underscoring music behind dialogue, feeling the audience would wonder where the music was coming from. As a result, Steiner noted, &quot;They began to add a little music here and there to support love scenes or silent sequences.&quot; But in scenes where music might be expected, such as a nightclub, ballroom, or theater, the orchestra fit in more naturally and was used often. In order to justify the addition of music in scenes where it wasn&#x27;t expected, music was integrated into the scene through characters or added more conspicuously. For example, a shepherd boy might play a flute along with the orchestra heard in the background, or a random, wandering violinist might follow around a couple during a love scene; however, because half of the music was recorded on the set, Steiner says it led to a great deal of inconvenience and cost when scenes were later edited, because the score would often be ruined. As recording technology improved during this period, he was able to record the music synced to the film and could change the score after the film was edited. Steiner explains his own typical method of scoring:

Steiner often followed his instincts and his own reasoning in creating film scores. For example, when he chose to go against Selznick&#x27;s instruction to use classical music for &quot;Gone with the Wind.&quot; Steiner stated:

Scores from the classics were sometimes harmful to a picture, especially when they drew unwanted attention to themselves by virtue of their familiarity. For example, films like &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, &quot;The Sting&quot;, and &quot;Manhattan&quot;, had scores with recognizable tunes instead of having a preferred &quot;subliminal&quot; effect. Steiner, was among the first to acknowledge the need for original scores for each film.

Steiner felt knowing when to start and stop was the hardest part of proper scoring, since incorrect placement of music can speed up a scene meant to be slow and vice versa: &quot;Knowing the difference is what makes a film composer.&quot; He also notes that many composers, contrary to his own technique, would fail to subordinate the music to the film:

===Click tracks===
Although some scholars cite Steiner as the inventor of the click track technique as such, he, possibly alongside Roy Webb, was the first to use the technique in film scoring. Carl W. Stalling and Scott Bradley used the technique first in cartoon music. The click-track allows the composer to sync music and film together more precisely. The technique involves punching holes into the soundtrack film based on the mathematics of metronome speed. As the holes pass through a projector, the orchestra and conductor can hear the clicking sound through headphones, allowing them to record the music along the exact timing of the film. This technique allowed conductors and orchestras to match the music with perfection to the timing of the film, eliminating the previous necessity to cut off or stop music in the middle of recording as had been done previously. Popularized by Steiner in film music, this technique allowed Steiner to &quot;catch the action&quot;, creating sounds for small details on screen. In fact, Steiner reportedly spent more of his time matching the action to the music than composing the melodies and motifs, as creating and composing came easy to him.

===Leitmotifs===
With Steiner&#x27;s background in his European musical training largely consisting of operas and operettas and his experience with stage music, he brought with him a slew of old-fashioned techniques he contributed to the development of the Hollywood film score. Although Steiner has been called, &quot;the man who invented modern film music&quot;, he himself claimed that, &quot;the idea originated with Richard Wagner ... If Wagner had lived in this century, he would have been the No. 1 film composer.&quot; Wagner was the inventor of the leitmotif, and this influenced Steiner&#x27;s composition. In his music, Steiner relied heavily on leitmotifs. He would also quote pre-existing, recognizable melodies in his scores, such as national anthems. Steiner was known and often criticized for his use of Mickey Mousing or &quot;catching the action&quot;. This technique is characterized by the precise matching of music with the actions or gestures on screen. Steiner was criticized for using this technique too frequently. For example, in &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot;, Steiner created a limping effect with his music whenever the clubfooted character walked.

One of the important principles that guided Steiner whenever possible was his rule: &quot;Every character should have a theme.&quot; &quot;Steiner creates a musical picture that tells us all we need to know about the character.&quot; To accomplish this, Steiner synchronized the music, the narrative action, and the leitmotif as a structural framework for his compositions. It may be added that Steiner&#x27;s leitmotifs were more direct and less subtle than those by his contemporary Austrian-emigré competitors in the Hollywood scoring market, such as Erich Korngold or Ernst Toch. Unlike the latter two, Steiner took on large staff to help with orchestration, allowing him to multiply his output.

A good example of how the characters and the music worked together is best exemplified by his score for &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot; (1950):
*For the physically crippled heroine, Laura, Steiner had to &quot;somehow capture in sound her escape from the tawdriness of reality into her make-believe world of glass figures ... The result is tone-colour of an appropriately glassy quality; ... a free use of vibraphone, celesta, piano, glockenspiel and triangle enhances the fragility and beauty of the sound.&quot;
*For Laura&#x27;s well-traveled soldier brother: &quot;Tom&#x27;s theme has a big-city blues-type resonance. It is also rich and warm ... [and] tells us something of Tom&#x27;s good-hearted nature.&quot;
*For Jim, Laura&#x27;s long-awaited &#x27;gentleman caller&#x27; who soon transforms her life: Steiner&#x27;s &quot;clean-limbed melody reflects his likeableness and honesty ... Elements of Jim&#x27;s theme are built into the dance-band music at the &#x27;Paradise&#x27; as he assures her of her essential beauty and begins successfully to counter her deep-seated inferiority complex. Upon their return home, the music darkens the scene in preparation for Jim&#x27;s disclosure that he is already committed to another girl.&quot;

Another film which exemplifies the synchronizing of character and music is &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; (1949):
The character of Roark, an idealist architect (played by Gary Cooper):

In the same way that Steiner created a theme for each character in a film, Steiner&#x27;s music developed themes to express emotional aspects of general scenes which originally lacked emotional content. For example:

*&quot;King Kong&quot; (1933): The music told the story of what was happening in the film. It expressed Kong&#x27;s &quot;feelings of tenderness towards his helpless victim.&quot; The music underscores feelings that the camera simply cannot express. The score of the film showed &quot;the basic power of music to terrorize and to humanize.&quot;
*&quot;The Letter&quot; (1940), starring Bette Davis: The music of this film creates an atmosphere of &quot;tropical tension and violence&quot; by &quot;blasting the credits &quot;fortissimo&quot; across the theater.&quot; Steiner&#x27;s score emphasizes the tragic and passionate themes of the film.
*&quot;The Big Sleep&quot; (1946): The music of this film &quot;darkens to match&quot; the changing atmosphere of the film. It creates a claustrophobic feeling by including high strings &quot;pitted rhythmically&quot; against low strings and brass.
*&quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot; (1948): Steiner uses the music to intensify the anguish of Bogart and Holt, when they are left to dig a mine in the hot sun. The music &quot;assumes the character of a fiercely protesting funeral march.&quot; The timing of the music caves in as the mind caves in on Bogart. The music also serves to emphasize the theme of greed. It &quot;tells us the nature of the thoughts flashing through Holt&#x27;s mind as he stands outside the ruined mine;&quot; however, when the warm tones of the music rise again, it reflects Holt&#x27;s goodness as he saves Bogart from the collapsed mine. This &quot;climax is marked by a &quot;grandioso&quot; statement of the theme on full orchestra.&quot;

===Realistic and background music===
When adding a music score to a picture, Steiner used a &quot;spotting process&quot; in which he and the director of the film would watch the film in its entirety and discuss where underscoring of diegetic music would begin and end. Another technique Steiner used was the mixing of realistic and background music. For example, a character humming to himself is realistic music, and the orchestra might play his tune, creating a background music effect that ties into the film. Steiner was criticized for this technique as the awareness of the film music can ruin the narrative illusion of the film; however, Steiner understood the importance of letting the film take the spotlight, making the music, &quot;subordinate..to the picture,&quot; stating that, &quot;if it gets too decorative, it loses its emotional appeal.&quot; Before 1932, producers of sound films tried to avoid the use of background music, because viewers would wonder where the music was coming from. Steiner was known for writing using atmospheric music without melodic content for certain neutral scenes in music. Steiner designed a melodic motion to create normal-sounding music without taking too much attention away from the film. In contrast, Steiner sometimes used diegetic, or narrative based music, in order to emphasize certain emotions or contradict them. According to Steiner, there is, &quot;no greater counterpoint ... than gay music underlying a tragic scene or vice versa.&quot;

==Influence==
===Industry recognition===
Three of Max Steiner&#x27;s scores won the Academy Award for Best Original Score: &quot;The Informer&quot; (1935), &quot;Now, Voyager&quot; (1942), and &quot;Since You Went Away&quot; (1944). Steiner received a certificate for &quot;The Informer&quot;. He originally received plaques for &quot;Now, Voyager&quot; and &quot;Since You Went Away&quot;, but those plaques were replaced with Academy Award statuettes in 1946. As an individual, Steiner was nominated for a total of 20 Academy Awards, and won two. Prior to 1939, the academy recognized a studio&#x27;s music department, rather than the individual composer, with a nomination in the scoring category. During this time, five of Steiner&#x27;s scores including &quot;The Lost Patrol&quot; and &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot; were nominated, but the academy does not consider these nominations to belong to Max Steiner himself. Consequently, even though Steiner&#x27;s score for &quot;The Informer&quot; won the Academy Award in 1936, the academy does not officially consider Steiner as the individual winner of the award, as Steiner accepted the award on behalf of RKO&#x27;s music department of which he was the department head. Steiner&#x27;s 20 nominations make him the third most nominated individual in the history of the scoring categories, behind John Williams and Alfred Newman.

The United States Postal Service issued its &quot;American Music Series&quot; stamps on 16 September 1999, to pay tribute to renowned Hollywood composers, including Steiner. After Steiner&#x27;s death, Charles Gerhardt conducted the National Philharmonic Orchestra in an RCA Victor album of highlights from Steiner&#x27;s career, titled &quot;Now Voyager&quot;. He also won a Golden Globe for Best Original Score for &quot;Life with Father&quot; (1947). Additional selections of Steiner scores were included on other RCA classic film albums during the early 1970s. The quadraphonic recordings were later digitally remastered for Dolby surround sound and released on CD. In 1975, Steiner was honored with a star located at 1551 Vine Street on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contribution to motion pictures. In 1995, Steiner was inducted posthumously into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In commemoration of Steiner&#x27;s 100th birthday, a memorial plaque was unveiled in 1988 at Steiner&#x27;s birthplace, the &quot;Hotel Nordbahn&quot; (now &quot;Austria Classic Hotel Wien&quot;) on Praterstraße 72. In 1990, Steiner was one of the first to be recognized for Lifetime Achievement by an online awards site.

===Legacy among composers===
In Kurt London&#x27;s &quot;Film Music&quot;, London expressed the opinion that American film music was inferior to European film music because it lacked originality of composition; he cited the music of Steiner as an exception to the rule. Steiner, along with contemporaries Erich Wolfgang Korngold and Alfred Newman, set the style and forms of film music of the time period and for film scores to come. Known for their similar music styles, Roy Webb was also Steiner&#x27;s contemporary and they were friends until Steiner&#x27;s death. Webb&#x27;s score for &quot;Mighty Joe Young&quot; was reminiscent of Steiner. James Bond composer John Barry cited Steiner as an influence of his work. James Newton Howard, who composed the score for the 2005 remake of &quot;King Kong&quot;, stated that he was influenced by Steiner&#x27;s score; his descending theme when Kong first appears is reminiscent of Steiner&#x27;s score. In fact, during the tribal sacrifice scene of the 2005 version, the music playing is from Steiner&#x27;s score of the same scene in the 1933 version. Composer of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; film score, John Williams cited Steiner as well as other European emigrant composers in the 1930s and 1940s &quot;Golden Age&quot; of film music as influences of his work. In fact, George Lucas wanted Williams to use the scores of Steiner and Korngold as influences for the music for &quot;Star Wars&quot;, despite the rarity of grandiose film music and the lack of use of leitmotifs and full orchestrations during the 1970s.

Often compared to his contemporary Erich Wolfgang Korngold, his rival and friend at Warner Bros., the music of Steiner was often seen by critics as inferior to Korngold. Composer David Raksin stated that the music of Korngold was, &quot;of a higher order with a much wider sweep;&quot; however, according to William Darby and Jack Du Bois&#x27;s &quot;American Film Music&quot;, even though other film score composers may have produced greater individual scores than Steiner, no composer ever created as many &quot;very good&quot; ones as Steiner. Despite the inferiority of Steiner&#x27;s individual scores, his influence was largely historical. Steiner was one of the first composers to reintroduce music into films after the invention of talking films. Steiner&#x27;s score for &quot;King Kong&quot; modeled the method of adding background music into a movie. Some of his contemporaries did not like his music. Miklós Rózsa criticized Steiner for his use of Mickey Mousing and did not like his music, but Rózsa conceded that Steiner had a successful career and had a good &quot;melodic sense&quot;.

Now referred to as the &quot;father of film music&quot; or the &quot;dean of film music&quot;, Steiner had written or arranged music for over three hundred films by the end of his career. George Korngold, son of Erich Korngold, produced the Classic Film Score Series albums which included the music of Steiner. Albert K. Bender established the Max Steiner Music Society with international membership, publishing journals and newsletters and a library of audio recordings. When the Steiner collection went to Brigham Young University in 1981, the organization disbanded. The Max Steiner Memorial Society was formed in the United Kingdom continue the work of the Max Steiner Music Society.

<doc id="19694" wikidata="Q308" url="?curid=19694" title="Mercury (planet)">
<text>Mercury is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest in the Solar System. In English, it is named after the ancient Roman god (Mercury), god of commerce and communication, and the messenger of the gods. Mercury is classified as a terrestrial planet, with roughly the same surface gravity as Mars. The surface of Mercury is heavily cratered, as a result of countless impact events that have accumulated over billions of years. Its largest crater, Caloris Planitia, has a diameter of , which is about one-third the diameter of the planet (). Similarly to the Earth&#x27;s Moon, Mercury&#x27;s surface displays an expansive rupes system generated from thrust faults and bright ray systems formed by impact event remnants.

Mercury&#x27;s sidereal year (88.0 Earth days) and sidereal day (58.65 Earth days) are in a 3:2 ratio. This relationship is called spin–orbit resonance, and &quot;sidereal&quot; here means &quot;relative to the stars&quot;. Consequently, one solar day (sunrise to sunrise) on Mercury lasts for around 176 Earth days: twice the planet&#x27;s sidereal year. This means that one side of Mercury will remain in sunlight for one Mercurian year of 88 Earth days; while during the next orbit, that side will be in darkness all the time until the next sunrise after another 88 Earth days.

Combined with its high orbital eccentricity, the planet&#x27;s surface has widely varying sunlight intensity and temperature, with the equatorial regions ranging from at night to during sunlight. Due to the very small axial tilt, the planet&#x27;s poles are permanently shadowed. This strongly suggests that water ice could be present in the craters. Above the planet&#x27;s surface is an extremely tenuous exosphere and a faint magnetic field that is strong enough to deflect solar winds. Mercury has no natural satellites.

As of the early 2020s, many broad details of Mercury&#x27;s geological history are still under investigation or pending data from space probes. Like other planets in the Solar System, Mercury was formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago. Its mantle is highly homogeneous, which suggests that Mercury had a magma ocean early in its history, like the Moon. According to current models, Mercury may have a solid silicate crust and mantle overlying a solid outer core, a deeper liquid core layer, and a solid inner core. There are many competing hypotheses about Mercury&#x27;s origins and development, some of which incorporate collision with planetesimals and rock vaporization.

== Nomenclature ==
Historically, humans knew Mercury by different names depending on whether it was an evening star or a morning star. By about 350 BC, the ancient Greeks had realized the two stars were one. They knew the planet as , meaning &quot;twinkling&quot;, and , for its fleeting motion, a name that is retained in modern Greek ( ). The Romans named the planet after the swift-footed Roman messenger god, Mercury (Latin ), whom they equated with the Greek Hermes, because it moves across the sky faster than any other planet, though some associated the planet with Apollo instead, as detailed by Pliny the Elder. The astronomical symbol for Mercury is a stylized version of Hermes&#x27; caduceus; a Christian cross was added in the 16th century:.

== Physical characteristics ==
Mercury is one of four terrestrial planets in the Solar System, which means it is a rocky body like Earth. It is the smallest planet in the Solar System, with an equatorial radius of . Mercury is also smaller—albeit more massive—than the largest natural satellites in the Solar System, Ganymede and Titan. Mercury consists of approximately 70% metallic and 30% silicate material.

=== Internal structure ===
Mercury appears to have a solid silicate crust and mantle overlying a solid, metallic outer core layer, a deeper liquid core layer, and a solid inner core. The composition of the iron-rich core remains uncertain, but it likely contains nickel, silicon and perhaps sulfur and carbon, plus trace amounts of other elements. The planet&#x27;s density is the second highest in the Solar System at 5.427 g/cm3, only slightly less than Earth&#x27;s density of 5.515 g/cm3. If the effect of gravitational compression were to be factored out from both planets, the materials of which Mercury is made would be denser than those of Earth, with an uncompressed density of 5.3 g/cm3 versus Earth&#x27;s 4.4 g/cm3. Mercury&#x27;s density can be used to infer details of its inner structure. Although Earth&#x27;s high density results appreciably from gravitational compression, particularly at the core, Mercury is much smaller and its inner regions are not as compressed. Therefore, for it to have such a high density, its core must be large and rich in iron.

The radius of Mercury&#x27;s core is estimated to be , based on interior models constrained to be consistent with a moment of inertia factor of . Hence, Mercury&#x27;s core occupies about 57% of its volume; for Earth this proportion is 17%. Research published in 2007 suggests that Mercury has a molten core. The mantle-crust layer is in total thick. Projections differ as to the size of the crust specifically; data from the and &quot;MESSENGER&quot; probes suggests a thickness of , whereas an Airy isostacy model suggests a thickness of . One distinctive feature of Mercury&#x27;s surface is the presence of numerous narrow ridges, extending up to several hundred kilometers in length. It is thought that these were formed as Mercury&#x27;s core and mantle cooled and contracted at a time when the crust had already solidified.

Mercury&#x27;s core has a higher iron content than that of any other planet in the Solar System, and several theories have been proposed to explain this. The most widely accepted theory is that Mercury originally had a metal–silicate ratio similar to common chondrite meteorites, thought to be typical of the Solar System&#x27;s rocky matter, and a mass approximately 2.25 times its current mass. Early in the Solar System&#x27;s history, Mercury may have been struck by a planetesimal of approximately Mercury&#x27;s mass and several thousand kilometers across. The impact would have stripped away much of the original crust and mantle, leaving the core behind as a relatively major component. A similar process, known as the giant impact hypothesis, has been proposed to explain the formation of Earth&#x27;s Moon.

Alternatively, Mercury may have formed from the solar nebula before the Sun&#x27;s energy output had stabilized. It would initially have had twice its present mass, but as the protosun contracted, temperatures near Mercury could have been between 2,500 and 3,500 K and possibly even as high as 10,000 K. Much of Mercury&#x27;s surface rock could have been vaporized at such temperatures, forming an atmosphere of &quot;rock vapor&quot; that could have been carried away by the solar wind. A third hypothesis proposes that the solar nebula caused drag on the particles from which Mercury was accreting, which meant that lighter particles were lost from the accreting material and not gathered by Mercury.

Each hypothesis predicts a different surface composition, and two space missions have been tasked with making observations of this composition. The first &quot;MESSENGER&quot;, which ended in 2015, found higher-than-expected potassium and sulfur levels on the surface, suggesting that the giant impact hypothesis and vaporization of the crust and mantle did not occur because said potassium and sulfur would have been driven off by the extreme heat of these events. &quot;BepiColombo&quot;, which will arrive at Mercury in 2025, will make observations to test these hypotheses. The findings so far would seem to favor the third hypothesis; however, further analysis of the data is needed.

=== Surface geology ===
Mercury&#x27;s surface is similar in appearance to that of the Moon, showing extensive mare-like plains and heavy cratering, indicating that it has been geologically inactive for billions of years. It is more heterogeneous than the surface of Mars or the Moon, both of which contain significant stretches of similar geology, such as maria and plateaus. Albedo features are areas of markedly different reflectivity, which include impact craters, the resulting ejecta, and ray systems. Larger albedo features correspond to higher reflectivity plains. Mercury has &quot;wrinkle-ridges&quot; (dorsa), Moon-like highlands, mountains (montes), plains (planitiae), escarpments (rupes), and valleys (valles).
The planet&#x27;s mantle is chemically heterogeneous, suggesting the planet went through a magma ocean phase early in its history. Crystallization of minerals and convective overturn resulted in a layered, chemically heterogeneous crust with large-scale variations in chemical composition observed on the surface. The crust is low in iron but high in sulfur, resulting from the stronger early chemically reducing conditions than is found on other terrestrial planets. The surface is dominated by iron-poor pyroxene and olivine, as represented by enstatite and forsterite, respectively, along with sodium-rich plagioclase and minerals of mixed magnesium, calcium, and iron-sulfide. The less reflective regions of the crust are high in carbon, most likely in the form of graphite.

Names for features on Mercury come from a variety of sources and are set according to the IAU planetary nomenclature system. Names coming from people are limited to the deceased. Craters are named for artists, musicians, painters, and authors who have made outstanding or fundamental contributions to their field. Ridges, or dorsa, are named for scientists who have contributed to the study of Mercury. Depressions or fossae are named for works of architecture. Montes are named for the word &quot;hot&quot; in a variety of languages. Plains or planitiae are named for Mercury in various languages. Escarpments or rupēs are named for ships of scientific expeditions. Valleys or valles are named for abandoned cities, towns, or settlements of antiquity.

==== Impact basins and craters ====
Mercury was heavily bombarded by comets and asteroids during and shortly following its formation 4.6 billion years ago, as well as during a possibly separate subsequent episode called the Late Heavy Bombardment that ended 3.8 billion years ago. Mercury received impacts over its entire surface during this period of intense crater formation, facilitated by the lack of any atmosphere to slow impactors down. During this time Mercury was volcanically active; basins were filled by magma, producing smooth plains similar to the maria found on the Moon. One of the most unusual craters is Apollodorus, or &quot;the Spider&quot;, which hosts a series of radiating troughs extending outwards from its impact site.

Craters on Mercury range in diameter from small bowl-shaped cavities to multi-ringed impact basins hundreds of kilometers across. They appear in all states of degradation, from relatively fresh rayed craters to highly degraded crater remnants. Mercurian craters differ subtly from lunar craters in that the area blanketed by their ejecta is much smaller, a consequence of Mercury&#x27;s stronger surface gravity. According to International Astronomical Union rules, each new crater must be named after an artist who was famous for more than fifty years, and dead for more than three years, before the date the crater is named.

The largest known crater is Caloris Planitia, or Caloris Basin, with a diameter of . The impact that created the Caloris Basin was so powerful that it caused lava eruptions and left a concentric mountainous ring ~ tall surrounding the impact crater. The floor of the Caloris Basin is filled by a geologically distinct flat plain, broken up by ridges and fractures in a roughly polygonal pattern. It is not clear whether they were volcanic lava flows induced by the impact or a large sheet of impact melt.

At the antipode of the Caloris Basin is a large region of unusual, hilly terrain known as the &quot;Weird Terrain&quot;. One hypothesis for its origin is that shock waves generated during the Caloris impact traveled around Mercury, converging at the basin&#x27;s antipode (180 degrees away). The resulting high stresses fractured the surface. Alternatively, it has been suggested that this terrain formed as a result of the convergence of ejecta at this basin&#x27;s antipode.
Overall, 46 impact basins have been identified. A notable basin is the -wide, multi-ring Tolstoj Basin that has an ejecta blanket extending up to from its rim and a floor that has been filled by smooth plains materials. Beethoven Basin has a similar-sized ejecta blanket and a -diameter rim. Like the Moon, the surface of Mercury has likely incurred the effects of space weathering processes, including solar wind and micrometeorite impacts.

==== Plains ====
There are two geologically distinct plains regions on Mercury. Gently rolling, hilly plains in the regions between craters are Mercury&#x27;s oldest visible surfaces, predating the heavily cratered terrain. These inter-crater plains appear to have obliterated many earlier craters, and show a general paucity of smaller craters below about in diameter.

Smooth plains are widespread flat areas that fill depressions of various sizes and bear a strong resemblance to lunar maria. Unlike lunar maria, the smooth plains of Mercury have the same albedo as the older inter-crater plains. Despite a lack of unequivocally volcanic characteristics, the localization and rounded, lobate shape of these plains strongly support volcanic origins. All the smooth plains of Mercury formed significantly later than the Caloris basin, as evidenced by appreciably smaller crater densities than on the Caloris ejecta blanket.

==== Compressional features ====
An unusual feature of Mercury&#x27;s surface is the numerous compression folds, or rupes, that crisscross the plains. These exist on the Moon, but are much more prominent on Mercury. As Mercury&#x27;s interior cooled, it contracted and its surface began to deform, creating wrinkle ridges and lobate scarps associated with thrust faults. The scarps can reach lengths of and heights of . These compressional features can be seen on top of other features, such as craters and smooth plains, indicating they are more recent. Mapping of the features has suggested a total shrinkage of Mercury&#x27;s radius in the range of ~. Most activity along the major thrust systems probably ended about 3.6–3.7 billion years ago. Small-scale thrust fault scarps have been found, tens of meters in height and with lengths in the range of a few kilometers, that appear to be less than 50 million years old, indicating that compression of the interior and consequent surface geological activity continue to the present.

====Volcanism====

There is evidence for pyroclastic flows on Mercury from low-profile shield volcanoes. Fifty-one pyroclastic deposits have been identified, where 90% of them are found within impact craters. A study of the degradation state of the impact craters that host pyroclastic deposits suggests that pyroclastic activity occurred on Mercury over a prolonged interval.

A &quot;rimless depression&quot; inside the southwest rim of the Caloris Basin consists of at least nine overlapping volcanic vents, each individually up to in diameter. It is thus a &quot;compound volcano&quot;. The vent floors are at least below their brinks and they bear a closer resemblance to volcanic craters sculpted by explosive eruptions or modified by collapse into void spaces created by magma withdrawal back down into a conduit. Scientists could not quantify the age of the volcanic complex system but reported that it could be on the order of a billion years.

=== Surface conditions and exosphere ===
The surface temperature of Mercury ranges from . It never rises above 180 K at the poles, due to the absence of an atmosphere and a steep temperature gradient between the equator and the poles. At perihelion, the equatorial subsolar point is located at latitude 0°W or 180°W, and it climbs to a temperature of about . During aphelion, this occurs at 90° or 270°W and reaches only . On the dark side of the planet, temperatures average . The intensity of sunlight on Mercury&#x27;s surface ranges between 4.59 and 10.61 times the solar constant (1,370 W·m−2).

Although daylight temperatures at the surface of Mercury are generally extremely high, observations strongly suggest that ice (frozen water) exists on Mercury. The floors of deep craters at the poles are never exposed to direct sunlight, and temperatures there remain below 102 K, far lower than the global average. This creates a cold trap where ice can accumulate. Water ice strongly reflects radar, and observations by the 70-meter Goldstone Solar System Radar and the VLA in the early 1990s revealed that there are patches of high radar reflection near the poles. Although ice was not the only possible cause of these reflective regions, astronomers thought it to be the most likely explanation. The presence of water ice was confirmed using &quot;MESSENGER&quot; images of craters at the north pole.

The icy crater regions are estimated to contain about 1014–1015 kg of ice, and may be covered by a layer of regolith that inhibits sublimation. By comparison, the Antarctic ice sheet on Earth has a mass of about 4 kg, and Mars&#x27;s south polar cap contains about 1016 kg of water. The origin of the ice on Mercury is not yet known, but the two most likely sources are from outgassing of water from the planet&#x27;s interior and deposition by impacts of comets.

Mercury is too small and hot for its gravity to retain any significant atmosphere over long periods of time; it does have a tenuous surface-bounded exosphere at a surface pressure of less than approximately 0.5 nPa (0.005 picobars). It includes hydrogen, helium, oxygen, sodium, calcium, potassium, magnesium, silicon, and hydroxide, among others. This exosphere is not stable—atoms are continuously lost and replenished from a variety of sources. Hydrogen atoms and helium atoms probably come from the solar wind, diffusing into Mercury&#x27;s magnetosphere before later escaping back into space. The radioactive decay of elements within Mercury&#x27;s crust is another source of helium, as well as sodium and potassium. Water vapor is present, released by a combination of processes such as comets striking its surface, sputtering creating water out of hydrogen from the solar wind and oxygen from rock, and sublimation from reservoirs of water ice in the permanently shadowed polar craters. The detection of high amounts of water-related ions like O+, OH−, and H3O+ was a surprise. Because of the quantities of these ions that were detected in Mercury&#x27;s space environment, scientists surmise that these molecules were blasted from the surface or exosphere by the solar wind.

Sodium, potassium, and calcium were discovered in the atmosphere during the 1980s–1990s, and are thought to result primarily from the vaporization of surface rock struck by micrometeorite impacts including presently from Comet Encke. In 2008, magnesium was discovered by &quot;MESSENGER&quot;. Studies indicate that, at times, sodium emissions are localized at points that correspond to the planet&#x27;s magnetic poles. This would indicate an interaction between the magnetosphere and the planet&#x27;s surface.

According to NASA, Mercury is not a suitable planet for Earth-like life. It has a surface boundary exosphere instead of a layered atmosphere, extreme temperatures, and high solar radiation. It is unlikely that any living beings can withstand those conditions. Some parts of the subsurface of Mercury may have been habitable, and perhaps life forms, albeit likely primitive microorganisms, may have existed on the planet.

=== Magnetic field and magnetosphere ===

Despite its small size and slow 59-day-long rotation, Mercury has a significant, and apparently global, magnetic field. According to measurements taken by , it is about 1.1% the strength of Earth&#x27;s. The magnetic-field strength at Mercury&#x27;s equator is about . Like that of Earth, Mercury&#x27;s magnetic field is dipolar and nearly aligned with the planet&#x27;s spin axis (10° dipolar tilt, compared to 11° for Earth). Measurements from both the and &quot;MESSENGER&quot; space probes have indicated that the strength and shape of the magnetic field are stable.

It is likely that this magnetic field is generated by a dynamo effect, in a manner similar to the magnetic field of Earth. This dynamo effect would result from the circulation of the planet&#x27;s iron-rich liquid core. Particularly strong tidal heating effects caused by the planet&#x27;s high orbital eccentricity would serve to keep part of the core in the liquid state necessary for this dynamo effect.

Mercury&#x27;s magnetic field is strong enough to deflect the solar wind around the planet, creating a magnetosphere. The planet&#x27;s magnetosphere, though small enough to fit within Earth, is strong enough to trap solar wind plasma. This contributes to the space weathering of the planet&#x27;s surface. Observations taken by the spacecraft detected this low energy plasma in the magnetosphere of the planet&#x27;s nightside. Bursts of energetic particles in the planet&#x27;s magnetotail indicate a dynamic quality to the planet&#x27;s magnetosphere.

During its second flyby of the planet on October 6, 2008, &quot;MESSENGER&quot; discovered that Mercury&#x27;s magnetic field can be extremely &quot;leaky&quot;. The spacecraft encountered magnetic &quot;tornadoes&quot;—twisted bundles of magnetic fields connecting the planetary magnetic field to interplanetary space—that were up to wide or a third of the radius of the planet. These twisted magnetic flux tubes, technically known as flux transfer events, form open windows in the planet&#x27;s magnetic shield through which the solar wind may enter and directly impact Mercury&#x27;s surface via magnetic reconnection. This also occurs in Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. The &quot;MESSENGER&quot; observations showed the reconnection rate was ten times higher at Mercury, but its proximity to the Sun only accounts for about a third of the reconnection rate observed by &quot;MESSENGER&quot;.

== Orbit, rotation, and longitude ==
Mercury has the most eccentric orbit of all the planets in the Solar System; its eccentricity is 0.21 with its distance from the Sun ranging from . It takes 87.969 Earth days to complete an orbit. The diagram illustrates the effects of the eccentricity, showing Mercury&#x27;s orbit overlaid with a circular orbit having the same semi-major axis. Mercury&#x27;s higher velocity when it is near perihelion is clear from the greater distance it covers in each 5-day interval. In the diagram, the varying distance of Mercury to the Sun is represented by the size of the planet, which is inversely proportional to Mercury&#x27;s distance from the Sun.

This varying distance to the Sun leads to Mercury&#x27;s surface being flexed by tidal bulges raised by the Sun that are about 17 times stronger than the Moon&#x27;s on Earth. Combined with a 3:2 spin–orbit resonance of the planet&#x27;s rotation around its axis, it also results in complex variations of the surface temperature. The resonance makes a single solar day (the length between two meridian transits of the Sun) on Mercury last exactly two Mercury years, or about 176 Earth days.

Mercury&#x27;s orbit is inclined by 7 degrees to the plane of Earth&#x27;s orbit (the ecliptic), the largest of all eight known solar planets. As a result, transits of Mercury across the face of the Sun can only occur when the planet is crossing the plane of the ecliptic at the time it lies between Earth and the Sun, which is in May or November. This occurs about every seven years on average.

Mercury&#x27;s axial tilt is almost zero, with the best measured value as low as 0.027 degrees. This is significantly smaller than that of Jupiter, which has the second smallest axial tilt of all planets at 3.1 degrees. This means that to an observer at Mercury&#x27;s poles, the center of the Sun never rises more than 2.1 arcminutes above the horizon. By comparison, the angular size of the Sun as seen from Mercury ranges from to 2 degrees across.

At certain points on Mercury&#x27;s surface, an observer would be able to see the Sun peek up a little more than two-thirds of the way over the horizon, then reverse and set before rising again, all within the same Mercurian day. This is because approximately four Earth days before perihelion, Mercury&#x27;s angular orbital velocity equals its angular rotational velocity so that the Sun&#x27;s apparent motion ceases; closer to perihelion, Mercury&#x27;s angular orbital velocity then exceeds the angular rotational velocity. Thus, to a hypothetical observer on Mercury, the Sun appears to move in a retrograde direction. Four Earth days after perihelion, the Sun&#x27;s normal apparent motion resumes. A similar effect would have occurred if Mercury had been in synchronous rotation: the alternating gain and loss of rotation over a revolution would have caused a libration of 23.65° in longitude.

For the same reason, there are two points on Mercury&#x27;s equator, 180 degrees apart in longitude, at either of which, around perihelion in alternate Mercurian years (once a Mercurian day), the Sun passes overhead, then reverses its apparent motion and passes overhead again, then reverses a second time and passes overhead a third time, taking a total of about 16 Earth-days for this entire process. In the other alternate Mercurian years, the same thing happens at the other of these two points. The amplitude of the retrograde motion is small, so the overall effect is that, for two or three weeks, the Sun is almost stationary overhead, and is at its most brilliant because Mercury is at perihelion, its closest to the Sun. This prolonged exposure to the Sun at its brightest makes these two points the hottest places on Mercury. Maximum temperature occurs when the Sun is at an angle of about 25 degrees past noon due to diurnal temperature lag, at 0.4 Mercury days and 0.8 Mercury years past sunrise. Conversely, there are two other points on the equator, 90 degrees of longitude apart from the first ones, where the Sun passes overhead only when the planet is at aphelion in alternate years, when the apparent motion of the Sun in Mercury&#x27;s sky is relatively rapid. These points, which are the ones on the equator where the apparent retrograde motion of the Sun happens when it is crossing the horizon as described in the preceding paragraph, receive much less solar heat than the first ones described above.

Mercury attains an inferior conjunction (nearest approach to Earth) every 116 Earth days on average, but this interval can range from 105 days to 129 days due to the planet&#x27;s eccentric orbit. Mercury can come as near as to Earth, and that is slowly declining: The next approach to within is in 2679, and to within in 4487, but it will not be closer to Earth than until 28,622. Its period of retrograde motion as seen from Earth can vary from 8 to 15 days on either side of an inferior conjunction. This large range arises from the planet&#x27;s high orbital eccentricity. Essentially, because Mercury is closest to the Sun, when taking an average over time, Mercury is most often the closest planet to the Earth, and—in that measure—it is the closest planet to each of the other planets in the Solar System.

=== Longitude convention ===
The longitude convention for Mercury puts the zero of longitude at one of the two hottest points on the surface, as described above. However, when this area was first visited, by , this zero meridian was in darkness, so it was impossible to select a feature on the surface to define the exact position of the meridian. Therefore, a small crater further west was chosen, called Hun Kal, which provides the exact reference point for measuring longitude. The center of Hun Kal defines the 20° west meridian. A 1970 International Astronomical Union resolution suggests that longitudes be measured positively in the westerly direction on Mercury. The two hottest places on the equator are therefore at longitudes 0° W and 180° W, and the coolest points on the equator are at longitudes 90° W and 270° W. However, the &quot;MESSENGER&quot; project uses an east-positive convention.

=== Spin-orbit resonance ===
For many years it was thought that Mercury was synchronously tidally locked with the Sun, rotating once for each orbit and always keeping the same face directed towards the Sun, in the same way that the same side of the Moon always faces Earth. Radar observations in 1965 proved that the planet has a 3:2 spin-orbit resonance, rotating three times for every two revolutions around the Sun. The eccentricity of Mercury&#x27;s orbit makes this resonance stable—at perihelion, when the solar tide is strongest, the Sun is nearly stationary in Mercury&#x27;s sky.

The 3:2 resonant tidal locking is stabilized by the variance of the tidal force along Mercury&#x27;s eccentric orbit, acting on a permanent dipole component of Mercury&#x27;s mass distribution. In a circular orbit there is no such variance, so the only resonance stabilized in such an orbit is at 1:1 (e.g., Earth–Moon), when the tidal force, stretching a body along the &quot;center-body&quot; line, exerts a torque that aligns the body&#x27;s axis of least inertia (the &quot;longest&quot; axis, and the axis of the aforementioned dipole) to always point at the center. However, with noticeable eccentricity, like that of Mercury&#x27;s orbit, the tidal force has a maximum at perihelion and therefore stabilizes resonances, like 3:2, ensuring that the planet points its axis of least inertia roughly at the Sun when passing through perihelion.

The original reason astronomers thought it was synchronously locked was that, whenever Mercury was best placed for observation, it was always nearly at the same point in its 3:2 resonance, hence showing the same face. This is because, coincidentally, Mercury&#x27;s rotation period is almost exactly half of its synodic period with respect to Earth. Due to Mercury&#x27;s 3:2 spin-orbit resonance, a solar day lasts about 176 Earth days. A sidereal day (the period of rotation) lasts about 58.7 Earth days.

Simulations indicate that the orbital eccentricity of Mercury varies chaotically from nearly zero (circular) to more than 0.45 over millions of years due to perturbations from the other planets. This was thought to explain Mercury&#x27;s 3:2 spin-orbit resonance (rather than the more usual 1:1), because this state is more likely to arise during a period of high eccentricity. However, accurate modeling based on a realistic model of tidal response has demonstrated that Mercury was captured into the 3:2 spin-orbit state at a very early stage of its history, within 20 (more likely, 10) million years after its formation.

Numerical simulations show that a future secular orbital resonant interaction with the perihelion of Jupiter may cause the eccentricity of Mercury&#x27;s orbit to increase to the point where there is a 1% chance that the orbit will be destabilized in the next five billion years. If this happens, Mercury may fall into the Sun, collide with Venus, be ejected from the Solar System, or even disrupt the rest of the inner Solar System.

=== Advance of perihelion ===
In 1859, the French mathematician and astronomer Urbain Le Verrier reported that the slow precession of Mercury&#x27;s orbit around the Sun could not be completely explained by Newtonian mechanics and perturbations by the known planets. He suggested, among possible explanations, that another planet (or perhaps instead a series of smaller &quot;corpuscules&quot;) might exist in an orbit even closer to the Sun than that of Mercury, to account for this perturbation. Other explanations considered included a slight oblateness of the Sun. The success of the search for Neptune based on its perturbations of the orbit of Uranus led astronomers to place faith in this possible explanation, and the hypothetical planet was named Vulcan, but no such planet was ever found.

The observed perihelion precession of Mercury is 5,600 arcseconds (1.5556°) per century relative to Earth, or per century relative to the inertial ICRF. Newtonian mechanics, taking into account all the effects from the other planets and including 0.0254 arcseconds per century due to the oblateness of the Sun, predicts a precession of 5,557 arcseconds (1.5436°) per century relative to Earth, or per century relative to ICRF. In the early 20th century, Albert Einstein&#x27;s general theory of relativity provided the explanation for the observed precession, by formalizing gravitation as being mediated by the curvature of spacetime. The effect is small: just per century (or 0.43 arcsecond per year, or 0.1035 arcsecond per orbital period) for Mercury; it therefore requires a little over 12.5 million orbits, or 3 million years, for a full excess turn. Similar, but much smaller, effects exist for other Solar System bodies: 8.6247 arcseconds per century for Venus, 3.8387 for Earth, 1.351 for Mars, and 10.05 for 1566 Icarus.

== Observation ==

Mercury&#x27;s apparent magnitude is calculated to vary between −2.48 (brighter than Sirius) around superior conjunction and +7.25 (below the limit of naked-eye visibility) around inferior conjunction. The mean apparent magnitude is 0.23 while the standard deviation of 1.78 is the largest of any planet. The mean apparent magnitude at superior conjunction is −1.89 while that at inferior conjunction is +5.93. Observation of Mercury is complicated by its proximity to the Sun, as it is lost in the Sun&#x27;s glare for much of the time. Mercury can be observed for only a brief period during either morning or evening twilight.

Ground-based telescope observations of Mercury reveal only an illuminated partial disk with limited detail. The Hubble Space Telescope cannot observe Mercury at all, due to safety procedures that prevent its pointing too close to the Sun. Because the shift of 0.15 revolutions of Earth in a Mercurian year makes up a seven-Mercurian-year cycle (0.15 × 7 ≈ 1.0), in the seventh Mercurian year, Mercury follows almost exactly (earlier by 7 days) the sequence of phenomena it showed seven Mercurian years before.

Like the Moon and Venus, Mercury exhibits phases as seen from Earth. It is &quot;new&quot; at inferior conjunction and &quot;full&quot; at superior conjunction. The planet is rendered invisible from Earth on both of these occasions because of its being obscured by the Sun, except at its new phase during a transit. Mercury is technically brightest as seen from Earth when it is at a full phase. Although Mercury is farthest from Earth when it is full, the greater illuminated area that is visible and the opposition brightness surge more than compensates for the distance. The opposite is true for Venus, which appears brightest when it is a crescent, because it is much closer to Earth than when gibbous.


Mercury is best observed at the first and last quarter, although they are phases of lesser brightness. The first and last quarter phases occur at greatest elongation east and west of the Sun, respectively. At both of these times, Mercury&#x27;s separation from the Sun ranges anywhere from 17.9° at perihelion to 27.8° at aphelion. At greatest &quot;western&quot; elongation, Mercury rises at its earliest before sunrise, and at greatest &quot;eastern&quot; elongation, it sets at its latest after sunset.

Mercury is more often and easily visible from the Southern Hemisphere than from the Northern. This is because Mercury&#x27;s maximum western elongation occurs only during early autumn in the Southern Hemisphere, whereas its greatest eastern elongation happens only during late winter in the Southern Hemisphere. In both of these cases, the angle at which the planet&#x27;s orbit intersects the horizon is maximized, allowing it to rise several hours before sunrise in the former instance and not set until several hours after sundown in the latter from southern mid-latitudes, such as Argentina and South Africa.

An alternate method for viewing Mercury involves observing the planet with a telescope during daylight hours when conditions are clear, ideally when it is at its greatest elongation. This allows the planet to be found easily, even when using telescopes with apertures. However, great care must be taken to obstruct the Sun from sight because of the extreme risk for eye damage. This method bypasses the limitation of twilight observing when the ecliptic is located at a low elevation (e.g. on autumn evenings). The planet is higher in the sky and less atmospheric effects affect the view of the planet. Mercury can be viewed as close as 4° to the Sun near superior conjunction when it is almost at its brightest.

Mercury can, like several other planets and the brightest stars, be seen during a total solar eclipse.

== Observation history ==

=== Ancient astronomers ===

The earliest known recorded observations of Mercury are from the MUL.APIN tablets. These observations were most likely made by an Assyrian astronomer around the 14th century BC. The cuneiform name used to designate Mercury on the MUL.APIN tablets is transcribed as UDU.IDIM.GU\U4.UD (&quot;the jumping planet&quot;). Babylonian records of Mercury date back to the 1st millennium BC. The Babylonians called the planet Nabu after the messenger to the gods in their mythology.

The Greco-Egyptian astronomer Ptolemy wrote about the possibility of planetary transits across the face of the Sun in his work &quot;Planetary Hypotheses&quot;. He suggested that no transits had been observed either because planets such as Mercury were too small to see, or because transits were too infrequent.

In ancient China, Mercury was known as &quot;the Hour Star&quot; (&quot;Chen-xing&quot; ). It was associated with the direction north and the phase of water in the Five Phases system of metaphysics. Modern Chinese, Korean, Japanese and Vietnamese cultures refer to the planet literally as the &quot;water star&quot; (), based on the Five elements. Hindu mythology used the name Budha for Mercury, and this god was thought to preside over Wednesday. The god Odin (or Woden) of Germanic paganism was associated with the planet Mercury and Wednesday. The Maya may have represented Mercury as an owl (or possibly four owls; two for the morning aspect and two for the evening) that served as a messenger to the underworld. Mercury was sometimes known as Stilbon (Greek: Στίλβων) meaning &#x27;the shining, glittering&#x27;.

In medieval Islamic astronomy, the Andalusian astronomer Abū Ishāq Ibrāhīm al-Zarqālī in the 11th century described the deferent of Mercury&#x27;s geocentric orbit as being oval, like an egg or a pignon, although this insight did not influence his astronomical theory or his astronomical calculations. In the 12th century, Ibn Bajjah observed &quot;two planets as black spots on the face of the Sun&quot;, which was later suggested as the transit of Mercury and/or Venus by the Maragha astronomer Qotb al-Din Shirazi in the 13th century. Most such medieval reports of transits were later taken as observations of sunspots.

In India, the Kerala school astronomer Nilakantha Somayaji in the 15th century developed a partially heliocentric planetary model in which Mercury orbits the Sun, which in turn orbits Earth, similar to the Tychonic system later proposed by Tycho Brahe in the late 16th century.

=== Ground-based telescopic research ===
The first telescopic observations of Mercury were made by Thomas Harriot and Galileo from 1610. In 1612, Simon Marius observed the brightness of Mercury varied with the planet&#x27;s orbital position and concluded it had phases &quot;in the same way as Venus and the Moon&quot;. In 1631, Pierre Gassendi made the first telescopic observations of the transit of a planet across the Sun when he saw a transit of Mercury predicted by Johannes Kepler. In 1639, Giovanni Zupi used a telescope to discover that the planet had orbital phases similar to Venus and the Moon. The observation demonstrated conclusively that Mercury orbited the Sun.

A rare event in astronomy is the passage of one planet in front of another (occultation), as seen from Earth. Mercury and Venus occult each other every few centuries, and the event of May 28, 1737, is the only one historically observed, having been seen by John Bevis at the Royal Greenwich Observatory. The next occultation of Mercury by Venus will be on December 3, 2133.

The difficulties inherent in observing Mercury meant that it was far less studied than the other planets. In 1800, Johann Schröter made observations of surface features, claiming to have observed mountains. Friedrich Bessel used Schröter&#x27;s drawings to erroneously estimate the rotation period as 24 hours and an axial tilt of 70°. In the 1880s, Giovanni Schiaparelli mapped the planet more accurately, and suggested that Mercury&#x27;s rotational period was 88 days, the same as its orbital period due to tidal locking. This phenomenon is known as synchronous rotation. The effort to map the surface of Mercury was continued by Eugenios Antoniadi, who published a book in 1934 that included both maps and his own observations. Many of the planet&#x27;s surface features, particularly the albedo features, take their names from Antoniadi&#x27;s map.

In June 1962, Soviet scientists at the Institute of Radio-engineering and Electronics of the USSR Academy of Sciences, led by Vladimir Kotelnikov, became the first to bounce a radar signal off Mercury and receive it, starting radar observations of the planet. Three years later, radar observations by Americans Gordon H. Pettengill and Rolf B. Dyce, using the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico, showed conclusively that the planet&#x27;s rotational period was about 59 days. The theory that Mercury&#x27;s rotation was synchronous had become widely held, and it was a surprise to astronomers when these radio observations were announced. If Mercury were tidally locked, its dark face would be extremely cold, but measurements of radio emission revealed that it was much hotter than expected. Astronomers were reluctant to drop the synchronous rotation theory and proposed alternative mechanisms such as powerful heat-distributing winds to explain the observations.

In 1965, Italian astronomer Giuseppe Colombo noted that the rotation value was about two-thirds of Mercury&#x27;s orbital period, and proposed that the planet&#x27;s orbital and rotational periods were locked into a 3:2 rather than a 1:1 resonance. Data from subsequently confirmed this view. This means that Schiaparelli&#x27;s and Antoniadi&#x27;s maps were not &quot;wrong&quot;. Instead, the astronomers saw the same features during every &quot;second&quot; orbit and recorded them, but disregarded those seen in the meantime, when Mercury&#x27;s other face was toward the Sun, because the orbital geometry meant that these observations were made under poor viewing conditions.

Ground-based optical observations did not shed much further light on Mercury, but radio astronomers using interferometry at microwave wavelengths, a technique that enables removal of the solar radiation, were able to discern physical and chemical characteristics of the subsurface layers to a depth of several meters. Not until the first space probe flew past Mercury did many of its most fundamental morphological properties become known. Moreover, technological advances have led to improved ground-based observations. In 2000, high-resolution lucky imaging observations were conducted by the Mount Wilson Observatory Hale telescope. They provided the first views that resolved surface features on the parts of Mercury that were not imaged in the mission. Most of the planet has been mapped by the Arecibo radar telescope, with resolution, including polar deposits in shadowed craters of what may be water ice.

=== Research with space probes ===


Reaching Mercury from Earth poses significant technical challenges, because it orbits so much closer to the Sun than Earth. A Mercury-bound spacecraft launched from Earth must travel over into the Sun&#x27;s gravitational potential well. Mercury has an orbital speed of , whereas Earth&#x27;s orbital speed is . Therefore, the spacecraft must make a larger change in velocity (delta-v) to get to Mercury and then enter orbit, as compared to the delta-v required for, say, Mars planetary missions.

The potential energy liberated by moving down the Sun&#x27;s potential well becomes kinetic energy, requiring a delta-v change to do anything other than pass by Mercury. Some portion of this delta-v budget can be provided from a gravity assist during one or more fly-bys of Venus. To land safely or enter a stable orbit the spacecraft would rely entirely on rocket motors. Aerobraking is ruled out because Mercury has a negligible atmosphere. A trip to Mercury requires more rocket fuel than that required to escape the Solar System completely. As a result, only three space probes have visited it so far. A proposed alternative approach would use a solar sail to attain a Mercury-synchronous orbit around the Sun.
==== &quot;Mariner 10&quot; ====

The first spacecraft to visit Mercury was NASA&#x27;s (1974–1975). The spacecraft used the gravity of Venus to adjust its orbital velocity so that it could approach Mercury, making it both the first spacecraft to use this gravitational &quot;slingshot&quot; effect and the first NASA mission to visit multiple planets. provided the first close-up images of Mercury&#x27;s surface, which immediately showed its heavily cratered nature, and revealed many other types of geological features, such as the giant scarps that were later ascribed to the effect of the planet shrinking slightly as its iron core cools. Unfortunately, the same face of the planet was lit at each of close approaches. This made close observation of both sides of the planet impossible, and resulted in the mapping of less than 45% of the planet&#x27;s surface.

The spacecraft made three close approaches to Mercury, the closest of which took it to within of the surface. At the first close approach, instruments detected a magnetic field, to the great surprise of planetary geologists—Mercury&#x27;s rotation was expected to be much too slow to generate a significant dynamo effect. The second close approach was primarily used for imaging, but at the third approach, extensive magnetic data were obtained. The data revealed that the planet&#x27;s magnetic field is much like Earth&#x27;s, which deflects the solar wind around the planet. For many years after the encounters, the origin of Mercury&#x27;s magnetic field remained the subject of several competing theories.

On March 24, 1975, just eight days after its final close approach, ran out of fuel. Because its orbit could no longer be accurately controlled, mission controllers instructed the probe to shut down. is thought to be still orbiting the Sun, passing close to Mercury every few months.

==== &quot;MESSENGER&quot; ====
A second NASA mission to Mercury, named &quot;MESSENGER&quot; (MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging), was launched on August 3, 2004. It made a fly-by of Earth in August 2005, and of Venus in October 2006 and June 2007 to place it onto the correct trajectory to reach an orbit around Mercury. A first fly-by of Mercury occurred on January 14, 2008, a second on October 6, 2008, and a third on September 29, 2009. Most of the hemisphere not imaged by was mapped during these fly-bys. The probe successfully entered an elliptical orbit around the planet on March 18, 2011. The first orbital image of Mercury was obtained on March 29, 2011. The probe finished a one-year mapping mission, and then entered a one-year extended mission into 2013. In addition to continued observations and mapping of Mercury, &quot;MESSENGER&quot; observed the 2012 solar maximum.

 The mission was designed to clear up six key issues: Mercury&#x27;s high density, its geological history, the nature of its magnetic field, the structure of its core, whether it has ice at its poles, and where its tenuous atmosphere comes from. To this end, the probe carried imaging devices that gathered much-higher-resolution images of much more of Mercury than , assorted spectrometers to determine the abundances of elements in the crust, and magnetometers and devices to measure velocities of charged particles. Measurements of changes in the probe&#x27;s orbital velocity were expected to be used to infer details of the planet&#x27;s interior structure. &quot;MESSENGER&quot; final maneuver was on April 24, 2015, and it crashed into Mercury&#x27;s surface on April 30, 2015. The spacecraft&#x27;s impact with Mercury occurred at 3:26:01 p.m. EDT on April 30, 2015, leaving a crater estimated to be in diameter.

==== &quot;BepiColombo&quot; ====

The European Space Agency and the Japanese Space Agency developed and launched a joint mission called &quot;BepiColombo&quot;, which will orbit Mercury with two probes: one to map the planet and the other to study its magnetosphere. Launched on October 20, 2018, &quot;BepiColombo&quot; is expected to reach Mercury in 2025. It will release a magnetometer probe into an elliptical orbit, then chemical rockets will fire to deposit the mapper probe into a circular orbit. Both probes will operate for one terrestrial year. The mapper probe carries an array of spectrometers similar to those on &quot;MESSENGER&quot;, and will study the planet at many different wavelengths including infrared, ultraviolet, X-ray and gamma ray. &quot;BepiColombo&quot; conducted the first of its six planned Mercury flybys on October 1, 2021, and the sixth was completed on January 9, 2025. The spacecraft will enter the planet&#x27;s orbit in 2026.

===&quot;Perseverance&quot; rover===
On March 5, 2024, NASA released images of transits of the moon Deimos, the moon Phobos and the planet Mercury as viewed by the &quot;Perseverance&quot; rover on the planet Mars.

<text>Monty Python and the Holy Grail is a 1975 British comedy film based on the Arthurian legend, written and performed by the Monty Python comedy group (Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, and Michael Palin) and directed by Gilliam and Jones in their feature directorial debuts. It was conceived during the hiatus between the third and fourth series of their BBC Television series &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;.

While the group&#x27;s first film, &quot;And Now for Something Completely Different&quot;, was a compilation of sketches from the first two television series, &quot;Holy Grail&quot; is an original story that parodies the legend of King Arthur&#x27;s quest for the Holy Grail. Thirty years later, Idle used the film as the basis for the 2005 Tony Award-winning musical &quot;Spamalot&quot;.

&quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; grossed more than any other British film screened in the US in 1975 and has since been considered one of the greatest comedy films of all time. In the US, it was selected in 2011 as the second-best comedy of all time in the ABC special &quot;Best in Film: The Greatest Movies of Our Time&quot; behind &quot;Airplane!&quot;. In the UK, readers of &quot;Total Film&quot; magazine in 2000 ranked it the fifth-greatest comedy film of all time; a similar poll of Channel 4 viewers in 2006 placed it sixth.

==Plot==
In AD 932, King Arthur and his squire, Patsy, who claps coconut shells together to make the sound of a horse&#x27;s hooves while Arthur &quot;rides&quot; before him, travel Britain searching for men to join the Knights of the Round Table. Along the way, Arthur debates whether swallows could carry coconuts, passes through a plague-infested town, recounts receiving Excalibur from the Lady of the Lake to two anarcho-syndicalist peasants, and defeats the Black Knight. At an impromptu witch trial, he recruits Sir Bedevere the Wise, later joined by Sir Lancelot the Brave, Sir Galahad the Pure, Sir Robin the Not-Quite-So-Brave-as-Sir-Lancelot, and the aptly named Sir Not-Appearing-in-this-Film, along with their squires and Robin&#x27;s minstrels. Arthur leads the knights to Camelot, but changes his mind after the knights in the castle perform a musical number, deeming it &quot;a silly place&quot;. God then appears and orders Arthur to find the Holy Grail.

Arthur and his knights arrive at a castle occupied by French soldiers, who claim to have the Grail and taunt the Britons, driving them back with a barrage of barnyard animals. Bedevere concocts a plan to sneak in using a Trojan Rabbit but forgets to tell the others to hide inside it; the Knights are forced to flee when it is flung back at them. Arthur decides the knights should go their separate ways to search for the Grail. Meanwhile, a modern-day historian filming a documentary on the Arthurian legends is killed by an unknown knight on horseback, triggering a police investigation.

Arthur and Bedevere are given directions by an old man and attempt to satisfy the strange requests of the dreaded Knights Who Say &quot;Ni!&quot;. Sir Robin avoids a fight with a Three-Headed Knight by running away while the heads are arguing amongst themselves. Sir Galahad is led by a grail-shaped beacon to Castle Anthrax, which is occupied exclusively by nubile young women, who wish to be punished for misleading him, but is &quot;rescued&quot; against his will by Lancelot. Lancelot receives an arrow-shot note from Swamp Castle. Believing the author is a lady being forced to marry against her will, he storms the castle and slaughters several wedding party members, only to discover the author is an effeminate prince.

Arthur and his knights regroup and are joined by Brother Maynard, his monk brethren, and three new knights: Bors, Gawain, and Ector. They meet Tim the Enchanter, a pyromancer who directs them to a cave where the location of the Grail is said to be written. The entrance to the cave is guarded by the Rabbit of Caerbannog. Underestimating it, the knights attack, but the Rabbit easily kills the newcomer knights. Arthur uses the &quot;Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch&quot;, provided by Brother Maynard, to destroy the creature. Inside the cave, they find an inscription from Joseph of Arimathea, directing them to Castle Aarrgh and warning them of the &quot;Legendary Black Beast&quot;, a cave monster whose location of origin is obscured by a screaming sound. In an animated sequence, the Black Beast devours Brother Maynard, but Arthur and the knights escape after the animator unexpectedly suffers a fatal heart attack.

The knights approach the Bridge of Death, where the bridge-keeper demands they answer three questions in order to pass or else be cast into the Gorge of Eternal Peril. Lancelot easily answers simple questions and crosses. An overly cocky Robin is defeated by an unexpectedly difficult question, and an indecisive Galahad fails an easy one; both are magically flung into the gorge. When Arthur asks for clarification on a question regarding the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow, the bridge-keeper cannot answer and is himself thrown into the gorge.

Arthur and Bedevere cannot find Lancelot, unaware that he has been arrested by police investigating the historian&#x27;s death. The pair reach Castle Aarrgh but find it occupied by the French soldiers from earlier in the film. After being repelled by showers of manure, they summon an army of knights and prepare to assault the castle. As the army charges, the police arrive, arrest Arthur and Bedevere on suspicion of the murder of the historian, and break the camera, abruptly ending the film.

==Production==
===Development===

In January 1973, the Monty Python troupe wrote the first draft of the screenplay. Half of the material was set in the Middle Ages and half was set in the present day. The group decided to set the film during the Middle Ages and focus on the legend of the Holy Grail. By the fourth or fifth draft, the story was complete, and the cast joked that the fact that the Grail was never retrieved would be &quot;a big let-down ... a great anti-climax&quot;. Graham Chapman said a challenge was incorporating scenes that did not fit the Holy Grail motif.

Neither Terry Gilliam nor Terry Jones had directed a film before, and described it as a learning experience in which they would learn to make a film by making an entire full-length film. The cast humorously described the novice directing style as employing the level of mutual disrespect always found in Monty Python&#x27;s work.

Nat Cohen of EMI Films elected not to finance the film but later picked it up for distribution. A 2021 tweet by Eric Idle revealed that the film was financed by eight investors: Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Jethro Tull&#x27;s Ian Anderson, &quot;Holy Grail&quot;&#x27;s co-producer Michael White, Heartaches (a cricket team founded by lyricist Tim Rice), and three record companies, including Charisma Records, the record label that had released Python&#x27;s early comedy albums. According to Gilliam, the Pythons turned to rock stars like Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin because no studio would fund the film and the rock stars saw it as &quot;a good tax write-off&quot; because the top rate of UK income tax was &quot;as high as 90%&quot; at the time. Idle and Gilliam had previously mentioned that Elton John also contributed to the financing of the film. The investors contributed the entire original budget of £175,350 (about $410,000 in 1974) and also received a percentage of the proceeds from the 2005 musical &quot;Spamalot&quot;.

===Filming===

&quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; was mostly shot on location in Scotland, particularly around Doune Castle, Glen Coe, and the privately owned Castle Stalker. The many castles seen throughout the film were mainly either Doune Castle shot from different angles or hanging miniatures. There are several exceptions to this: the first exterior shot of a castle at the beginning of the film is Kidwelly Castle in South Wales, and the single exterior shot of the Swamp Castle during &quot;Tale of Sir Lancelot&quot; is Bodiam Castle in East Sussex; all subsequent shots of the exterior and interior of those scenes were filmed at Doune Castle. Production designer Julian Doyle recounted that his crew constructed walls in the forest near Doune. Terry Jones later recalled the crew had selected more castles around Scotland for locations, but during the two weeks prior to principal photography, the Scottish Department of the Environment declined permission for use of the castles in its jurisdiction, for fear of damage.

At the start of &quot;The Tale of Sir Robin&quot;, there is a slow camera zoom in on rocky scenery (that in the voice-over is described as &quot;the dark forest of Ewing&quot;). This is actually a still photograph of the gorge at Mount Buffalo National Park in Victoria, Australia. Doyle stated in 2000 during an interview with &quot;Hotdog&quot; magazine that it was a still image filmed with candles underneath the frame (to give a heat haze). This was a low-cost method of achieving a convincing location effect.
On the DVD audio commentary, Cleese described challenges shooting and editing Castle Anthrax in &quot;The Tale of Sir Galahad&quot;, with what he felt the most comedic take being unused because an anachronistic coat was visible in it. Castle Anthrax was also shot in one part of Doune, where costume designer Hazel Pethig advised against nudity, dressing the girls in shifts.

The scene in which the knights fight the Rabbit of Caerbannog was filmed at Tomnadashan mine. A real white rabbit was used, switched with puppets for its killings. The bite effects were done with special puppetry by both Gilliam and SFX technician John Horton. According to Gilliam, the rabbit was covered with red liquid to simulate blood, though its owner did not want the animal dirty and was kept unaware. The liquid was difficult to remove from the fur. Gilliam also stated that he thought, in hindsight, the crew could have just purchased their own rabbit instead. Regardless, the rabbit itself was unharmed.

As chronicled in &quot;The Life of Python&quot;, &quot;The First 20 Years of Monty Python&quot;, and &quot;The Pythons&#x27; Autobiography&quot;, Chapman suffered from acrophobia, trembling and bouts of forgetfulness during filming due to his alcoholism, prompting him to refrain from drinking while the production continued in order to remain &quot;on an even keel&quot;. Nearly three years later, in December 1977, Chapman achieved sobriety.

Originally the knight characters were going to ride real horses, but after it became clear that the film&#x27;s small budget precluded real horses (except for a lone horse appearing in a couple of scenes), the Pythons decided their characters would mime horse-riding while their porters trotted behind them banging coconut shells together. The joke was derived from the old-fashioned sound effect used by radio shows to convey the sound of hooves clattering. This was later referred to in the German release of the film, which translated the title as &quot;Die Ritter der Kokosnuß&quot; (&quot;The Knights of the Coconut&quot;). Similarly, the Hungarian title &quot;Gyalog galopp&quot; translates to &quot;Galloping on Foot&quot;.

The opening credits of the film feature pseudo-Swedish subtitles, which soon turn into an appeal to visit Sweden and see the country&#x27;s moose. The subtitles are soon stopped and claim that the people responsible have been sacked, but moose references continue throughout the actual credits. The subtitles were written by Michael Palin as a way to &quot;entertain the &#x27;captive&#x27; audience&quot; at the beginning of the film.

==Soundtrack==

In addition to several songs written by Python regular Neil Innes, several pieces of music were licensed from De Wolfe Music Library. These include:
* &quot;Wide Horizon&quot;, composed by Pierre Arvay; used during the opening titles.
* &quot;Ice Floe 9&quot;, composed by Pierre Arvay; used during the opening titles.
* &quot;Countrywide&quot;, composed by Anthony Mawer; used during the beginning titles after the first titlers are sacked.
* &quot;Homeward Bound&quot;, composed by Jack Trombey; used as King Arthur&#x27;s heroic theme.
* &quot;Crossed Swords&quot;, composed by Dudley Matthew; played during King Arthur&#x27;s battle with the Black Knight.
* &quot;The Flying Messenger&quot;, composed by Oliver Armstrong; played during Sir Lancelot&#x27;s misguided storming of Swamp Castle.
* &quot;The Promised Land&quot;, composed by Stanley Black; used in the scene where Arthur approaches the castle on the island.
* &quot;Starlet in the Starlight&quot;, composed by Kenneth Essex; briefly used for Prince Herbert&#x27;s attempt to express himself in song.
* &quot;Love Theme&quot;, composed by Peter Knight; also used briefly for Prince Herbert.
* &quot;Revolt&quot;, composed by Eric Towren; used as the army charges on Castle Aaargh.

Innes was supposed to write the film&#x27;s soundtrack in its entirety, but after the team watched the movie with Innes&#x27;s soundtrack, they decided to go instead with &quot;canned&quot; music, music borrowed from existing stock recordings. One problem with Innes&#x27;s music, apparently, was that they considered it too appropriate, so that, according to Python scholar Darl Larsen, it &quot;undercut the Pythons&#x27; attempt at undercutting the medieval world they were trying to depict&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; had its theatrical debut in London on 3 April 1975, followed by a screening on 27 April 1975 at the Century Plaza Cinemas in Los Angeles. It opened to the public in the United States at Cinema II in New York City on 28 April.

The film had its television premiere 25 February 1977 on the &quot;CBS Late Movie&quot;. Reportedly, the Pythons were displeased to discover a number of edits were done by the network to reduce use of profanity and the showing of blood. The troupe pulled back the rights and thereafter had it broadcast in the United States only on PBS and later other channels such as Comedy Central and IFC, where it runs uncut.

The film has been periodically re-released. A &quot;21st anniversary edition&quot; was released on video in 1995 with 24 seconds of extra footage. This version with a new stereo soundtrack was released in theatres starting 15 June 2001 in the United States. It was re-released on 14 October 2015 in the United Kingdom. It was re-released together with a special &quot;quote-along&quot; version in early December 2023 to celebrate its &quot;48th-and-a-half anniversary&quot;.

===Box office===
The film grossed $122,200 in its first 3 weeks in London. In its first week in New York it grossed $35,000.

According to records of the NFFC, as of 31 December 1978 the distributor earned receipts of £2,358,229 in the United Kingdom. It earned rentals in the US and Canada of $5.17 million.

===Home media===
In Region 1, The Criterion Collection released a LaserDisc version of the film featuring audio commentary from directors Jones and Gilliam.

In 2001, Columbia Tristar published a two-disc, special-edition DVD. Disc one includes the Jones and Gilliam commentary, a second commentary with Idle, Palin and Cleese, the film&#x27;s screenplay on a subtitle track and &quot;Subtitles for People Who Don&#x27;t Like the Film&quot;–consisting of lines taken from William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot;. Disc two includes &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail in Lego&quot;, a &quot;brickfilm&quot; version of the &quot;Camelot Song&quot; as sung by Lego minifigures. It was created by Spite Your Face Productions on commission from the Lego Group and Python Pictures. The project was conceived by the original film&#x27;s respective producer and co-director, John Goldstone and Terry Gilliam. Disc two also includes two scenes from the film&#x27;s Japanese dub, literally translated back into English through subtitles. &quot;The Quest for the Holy Grail Locations&quot;, hosted by Palin and Jones, shows places in Scotland used for the setting titled as &quot;England 932 A.D.&quot; (as well as the two Pythons purchasing a copy of their own script as a guide). Also included is a who&#x27;s who page, advertising galleries and sing-alongs. A &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; DVD release additionally included a book of the screenplay, a limited-edition film cell/senitype, and limited-edition art cards.

A 35th-anniversary edition on Blu-ray was released in the US on 6 March 2012. Special features include &quot;The Holy Book of Days,&quot; a second-screen experience that can be downloaded as an app on an iOS device and played with the Blu-ray to enhance its viewing, lost animation sequences with a new intro from animator Terry Gilliam, outtakes and extended scenes with Python member and the movie&#x27;s co-director Terry Jones.

On the special edition DVD, the studio logos, opening credits and a brief portion of the opening scene of 1961 British film &quot;Dentist on the Job&quot; is added to the start of the film. The clip ends with a spluttering, unseen &quot;projectionist&quot; realising he has played the wrong film. A &quot;slide&quot; then appears urging the audience to wait one moment please while the operator changes reels.

==Reception and legacy==

Contemporary reviews were mixed. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote in a favourable review that the film had &quot;some low spots,&quot; but had gags which were &quot;nonstop, occasionally inspired and should not be divulged, though it&#x27;s not giving away too much to say that I particularly liked a sequence in which the knights, to gain access to an enemy castle, come up with the idea of building a Trojan rabbit.&quot; Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; was also positive, writing that the film, &quot;like &quot;Mad&quot; comics, is not certain to please every taste. But its youthful exuberance and its rousing zaniness are hard not to like. As a matter of fact, the sense of fun is dangerously contagious.&quot; Penelope Gilliatt of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called the film &quot;often recklessly funny and sometimes a matter of comic genius.&quot;

Other reviews were less enthusiastic. &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that the storyline was &quot;basically an excuse for set pieces, some amusing, others overdone.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film two-and-a-half stars, writing that he felt &quot;it contained about 10 very funny moments and 70 minutes of silence. Too many jokes took too long to set up, a trait shared by both &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; and &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot;. I guess I prefer Monty Python in chunks, in its original, television revue format.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called the film &quot;a fitfully amusing spoof of the Arthurian legends&quot; but &quot;rather poky&quot; in tempo, citing the running gag of Swedish subtitles in the opening credits as an example of how the Pythons &quot;don&#x27;t know when to let go of any &quot;shtik&quot;&quot;. Geoff Brown of &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote in a mixed review that &quot;the team&#x27;s visual buffooneries and verbal rigamaroles (some good, some bad, but mostly indifferent) are piled on top of each other with no attention to judicious timing or structure, and a form which began as a jaunty assault on the well-made revue sketch and an ingenious misuse of television&#x27;s fragmented style of presentation, threatens to become as unyielding and unfruitful as the conventions it originally attacked.&quot;
The film&#x27;s reputation grew over time. In 2000, readers of &quot;Total Film&quot; magazine voted &quot;Holy Grail&quot; the fifth-greatest comedy film of all time. The next Python film, &quot;Life of Brian&quot;, was ranked first. A 2006 poll of Channel 4 viewers on the 50 Greatest Comedy Films saw &quot;Holy Grail&quot; placed in sixth place (with &quot;Life of Brian&quot; again topping the list). In 2011, an ABC prime-time special, &quot;Best in Film: The Greatest Movies of Our Time&quot;, counted down the best films chosen by fans based on results of a poll conducted by ABC and &quot;People&quot;. &quot;Holy Grail&quot; was selected as the second best comedy after &quot;Airplane!&quot; In 2016, &quot;Empire&quot; magazine ranked &quot;Holy Grail&quot; 18th in their list of the 100 best British films (&quot;Life of Brian&quot; was ranked 2nd), their entry stating, &quot;Elvis ordered a print of this comedy classic and watched it five times. If it&#x27;s good enough for the King, it&#x27;s good enough for you.&quot;

In a 2017 interview at Indiana University in Bloomington, John Cleese expressed disappointment with the film&#x27;s conclusion. &quot;&#x27;The ending annoys me the most&#x27;&quot;, he said after a screening of the film on the Indiana campus, adding that &quot;&#x27;It ends the way it does because we couldn&#x27;t think of any other way&#x27;&quot;. However, scripts for the film and notebooks that are among Michael Palin&#x27;s private archive, which he donated to the British Library in 2017, do document at least one alternative ending that the troupe considered: &quot;a battle between the knights of Camelot, the French, and the Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog&quot;. Due to the film&#x27;s small production budget, that idea for a &quot;much pricier option&quot; was discarded by the Pythons in favour of the ending with &quot;King Arthur getting arrested&quot;, which Palin deemed &quot;cheaper&quot; and &quot;funnier&quot;.

Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes offers a 96% approval rating from reviews of 83 critics, with an average rating of 8.50/10. The consensus reads, &quot;A cult classic as gut-bustingly hilarious as it is blithely ridiculous, &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; has lost none of its exceedingly silly charm.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 91 out of 100 based on 24 critics&#x27; reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

=== &quot;Spamalot&quot; ===
The film was adapted as the 2005 Tony Award-winning Broadway musical &quot;Spamalot&quot;. Written primarily by Idle, the stage show offers a revised plot, while retaining many jokes from the film.

In May 2018, 20th Century Fox green-lit a film adaptation of the musical. Idle would write the screenplay and stage director Casey Nicholaw would direct. Slated to begin filming in early 2019, production was delayed as a result of the acquisition of 20th Century Fox by The Walt Disney Company. The project announced a move to Paramount Pictures on 6 January 2020, with Idle and Nicholaw still attached as writer and director, and Dan Jinks joining as a producer. However, in 2021, Idle confirmed on his Twitter account that the film would not be made because two of his former colleagues opposed it. A Broadway revival took place at the St. James Theatre, with an official opening night of 16 November 2023.

In 2013, the Pythons lost a legal case to Mark Forstater, the film&#x27;s producer, owing a combined £800,000 in legal fees and back royalties to Forstater for the derivative work of &quot;Spamalot&quot;. To help cover the cost of these royalties and fees, the group arranged and performed in a stage show, &quot;Monty Python Live (Mostly)&quot;, held at the O2 Arena in London in July 2014.

<text>In biology, a mutation is an alteration in the nucleic acid sequence of the genome of an organism, virus, or extrachromosomal DNA. Viral genomes contain either DNA or RNA. Mutations result from errors during DNA or viral replication, mitosis, or meiosis or other types of damage to DNA (such as pyrimidine dimers caused by exposure to ultraviolet radiation), which then may undergo error-prone repair (especially microhomology-mediated end joining), cause an error during other forms of repair, or cause an error during replication (translesion synthesis). Mutations may also result from substitution, insertion or deletion of segments of DNA due to mobile genetic elements.
Mutations may or may not produce detectable changes in the observable characteristics (phenotype) of an organism. Mutations play a part in both normal and abnormal biological processes including: evolution, cancer, and the development of the immune system, including junctional diversity. Mutation is the ultimate source of all genetic variation, providing the raw material on which evolutionary forces such as natural selection can act.

Mutation can result in many different types of change in sequences. Mutations in genes can have no effect, alter the product of a gene, or prevent the gene from functioning properly or completely. Mutations can also occur in non-genic regions. A 2007 study on genetic variations between different species of &quot;Drosophila&quot; suggested that, if a mutation changes a protein produced by a gene, the result is likely to be harmful, with an estimated 70% of amino acid polymorphisms that have damaging effects, and the remainder being either neutral or marginally beneficial.

Mutation and DNA damage are the two major types of errors that occur in DNA, but they are fundamentally different. DNA damage is a physical alteration in the DNA structure, such as a single or double strand break, a modified guanosine residue in DNA such as 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine, or a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon adduct. DNA damages can be recognized by enzymes, and therefore can be correctly repaired using the complementary undamaged strand in DNA as a template or an undamaged sequence in a homologous chromosome if it is available. If DNA damage remains in a cell, transcription of a gene may be prevented and thus translation into a protein may also be blocked. DNA replication may also be blocked and/or the cell may die. In contrast to a DNA damage, a mutation is an alteration of the base sequence of the DNA. Ordinarily, a mutation cannot be recognized by enzymes once the base change is present in both DNA strands, and thus a mutation is not ordinarily repaired. At the cellular level, mutations can alter protein function and regulation. Unlike DNA damages, mutations are replicated when the cell replicates. At the level of cell populations, cells with mutations will increase or decrease in frequency according to the effects of the mutations on the ability of the cell to survive and reproduce. Although distinctly different from each other, DNA damages and mutations are related because DNA damages often cause errors of DNA synthesis during replication or repair and these errors are a major source of mutation.

== Overview ==
Mutations can involve the duplication of large sections of DNA, usually through genetic recombination. These duplications are a major source of raw material for evolving new genes, with tens to hundreds of genes duplicated in animal genomes every million years. Most genes belong to larger gene families of shared ancestry, detectable by their sequence homology. Novel genes are produced by several methods, commonly through the duplication and mutation of an ancestral gene, or by recombining parts of different genes to form new combinations with new functions.

Here, protein domains act as modules, each with a particular and independent function, that can be mixed together to produce genes encoding new proteins with novel properties. For example, the human eye uses four genes to make structures that sense light: three for cone cell or colour vision and one for rod cell or night vision; all four arose from a single ancestral gene. Another advantage of duplicating a gene (or even an entire genome) is that this increases engineering redundancy; this allows one gene in the pair to acquire a new function while the other copy performs the original function. Other types of mutation occasionally create new genes from previously noncoding DNA.

Changes in chromosome number may involve even larger mutations, where segments of the DNA within chromosomes break and then rearrange. For example, in the Homininae, two chromosomes fused to produce human chromosome 2; this fusion did not occur in the lineage of the other apes, and they retain these separate chromosomes. In evolution, the most important role of such chromosomal rearrangements may be to accelerate the divergence of a population into new species by making populations less likely to interbreed, thereby preserving genetic differences between these populations.

Sequences of DNA that can move about the genome, such as transposons, make up a major fraction of the genetic material of plants and animals, and may have been important in the evolution of genomes. For example, more than a million copies of the Alu sequence are present in the human genome, and these sequences have now been recruited to perform functions such as regulating gene expression. Another effect of these mobile DNA sequences is that when they move within a genome, they can mutate or delete existing genes and thereby produce genetic diversity.

Nonlethal mutations accumulate within the gene pool and increase the amount of genetic variation. The abundance of some genetic changes within the gene pool can be reduced by natural selection, while other &quot;more favorable&quot; mutations may accumulate and result in adaptive changes.
For example, a butterfly may produce offspring with new mutations. The majority of these mutations will have no effect; but one might change the colour of one of the butterfly&#x27;s offspring, making it harder (or easier) for predators to see. If this color change is advantageous, the chances of this butterfly&#x27;s surviving and producing its own offspring are a little better, and over time the number of butterflies with this mutation may form a larger percentage of the population.

Neutral mutations are defined as mutations whose effects do not influence the fitness of an individual. These can increase in frequency over time due to genetic drift. It is believed that the overwhelming majority of mutations have no significant effect on an organism&#x27;s fitness. Also, DNA repair mechanisms are able to mend most changes before they become permanent mutations, and many organisms have mechanisms, such as apoptotic pathways, for eliminating otherwise-permanently mutated somatic cells.

Beneficial mutations can improve reproductive success.

== Causes ==

Four classes of mutations are (1) mutations (molecular decay), (2) mutations due to error-prone replication bypass of naturally occurring DNA damage (also called error-prone translesion synthesis), (3) errors introduced during DNA repair, and (4) induced mutations caused by mutagens. Scientists may sometimes deliberately introduce mutations into cells or research organisms for the sake of scientific experimentation.

One 2017 study claimed that 66% of cancer-causing mutations are random, 29% are due to the environment (the studied population spanned 69 countries), and 5% are inherited.

Humans on average pass 60 new mutations to their children but fathers pass more mutations depending on their age with every year adding two new mutations to a child.

=== Spontaneous mutation ===

&quot;Spontaneous mutations&quot; occur with non-zero probability even given a healthy, uncontaminated cell. Naturally occurring oxidative DNA damage is estimated to occur 10,000 times per cell per day in humans and 100,000 times per cell per day in rats. Spontaneous mutations can be characterized by the specific change:
* Tautomerism – A base is changed by the repositioning of a hydrogen atom, altering the hydrogen bonding pattern of that base, resulting in incorrect base pairing during replication. Theoretical results suggest that proton tunnelling is an important factor in the spontaneous creation of GC tautomers.
* Depurination – Loss of a purine base (A or G) to form an apurinic site (AP site).
* Deamination – Hydrolysis changes a normal base to an atypical base containing a keto group in place of the original amine group. Examples include C → U and A → HX (hypoxanthine), which can be corrected by DNA repair mechanisms; and 5MeC (5-methylcytosine) → T, which is less likely to be detected as a mutation because thymine is a normal DNA base.
* Slipped strand mispairing – Denaturation of the new strand from the template during replication, followed by renaturation in a different spot (&quot;slipping&quot;). This can lead to insertions or deletions.

=== Error-prone replication bypass ===

There is increasing evidence that the majority of spontaneously arising mutations are due to error-prone replication (translesion synthesis) past DNA damage in the template strand. In mice, the majority of mutations are caused by translesion synthesis. Likewise, in yeast, Kunz et al. found that more than 60% of the spontaneous single base pair substitutions and deletions were caused by translesion synthesis.

=== Errors introduced during DNA repair ===

Although naturally occurring double-strand breaks occur at a relatively low frequency in DNA, their repair often causes mutation. Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is a major pathway for repairing double-strand breaks. NHEJ involves removal of a few nucleotides to allow somewhat inaccurate alignment of the two ends for rejoining followed by addition of nucleotides to fill in gaps. As a consequence, NHEJ often introduces mutations.

=== Induced mutation ===

Induced mutations are alterations in the gene after it has come in contact with mutagens and environmental causes.

&quot;Induced mutations&quot; on the molecular level can be caused by:
* Chemicals
** Hydroxylamine
** Base analogues (e.g., Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU))
** Alkylating agents (e.g., &quot;N&quot;-ethyl-&quot;N&quot;-nitrosourea (ENU). These agents can mutate both replicating and non-replicating DNA. In contrast, a base analogue can mutate the DNA only when the analogue is incorporated in replicating the DNA. Each of these classes of chemical mutagens has certain effects that then lead to transitions, transversions, or deletions.
** Agents that form DNA adducts (e.g., ochratoxin A)
** DNA intercalating agents (e.g., ethidium bromide)
** DNA crosslinkers
** Oxidative damage
** Nitrous acid converts amine groups on A and C to diazo groups, altering their hydrogen bonding patterns, which leads to incorrect base pairing during replication.
* Radiation
** Ultraviolet light (UV) (including non-ionizing radiation). Two nucleotide bases in DNA—cytosine and thymine—are most vulnerable to radiation that can change their properties. UV light can induce adjacent pyrimidine bases in a DNA strand to become covalently joined as a pyrimidine dimer. UV radiation, in particular longer-wave UVA, can also cause oxidative damage to DNA.
** Ionizing radiation. Exposure to ionizing radiation, such as gamma radiation, can result in mutation, possibly resulting in cancer or death.

Whereas in former times mutations were assumed to occur by chance, or induced by mutagens, molecular mechanisms of mutation have been discovered in bacteria and across the tree of life. As S. Rosenberg states, &quot;These mechanisms reveal a picture of highly regulated mutagenesis, up-regulated temporally by stress responses and activated when cells/organisms are maladapted to their environments—when stressed—potentially accelerating adaptation.&quot; Since they are self-induced mutagenic mechanisms that increase the adaptation rate of organisms, they have some times been named as adaptive mutagenesis mechanisms, and include the SOS response in bacteria, ectopic intrachromosomal recombination and other chromosomal events such as duplications.

== Classification of types ==

=== By effect on structure ===

The sequence of a gene can be altered in a number of ways. Gene mutations have varying effects on health depending on where they occur and whether they alter the function of essential proteins.
Mutations in the structure of genes can be classified into several types.

==== Large-scale mutations ====
Large-scale mutations in chromosomal structure include:
* Amplifications (or gene duplications) or repetition of a chromosomal segment or presence of extra piece of a chromosome broken piece of a chromosome may become attached to a homologous or non-homologous chromosome so that some of the genes are present in more than two doses leading to multiple copies of all chromosomal regions, increasing the dosage of the genes located within them.
* Polyploidy, duplication of entire sets of chromosomes, potentially resulting in a separate breeding population and speciation.
* Deletions of large chromosomal regions, leading to loss of the genes within those regions.
* Mutations whose effect is to juxtapose previously separate pieces of DNA, potentially bringing together separate genes to form functionally distinct fusion genes (e.g., bcr-abl).
* Large scale changes to the structure of chromosomes called chromosomal rearrangement that can lead to a decrease of fitness but also to speciation in isolated, inbred populations. These include:
** Chromosomal translocations: interchange of genetic parts from nonhomologous chromosomes.
** Chromosomal inversions: reversing the orientation of a chromosomal segment.
** Non-homologous chromosomal crossover.
** Interstitial deletions: an intra-chromosomal deletion that removes a segment of DNA from a single chromosome, thereby apposing previously distant genes. For example, cells isolated from a human astrocytoma, a type of brain tumour, were found to have a chromosomal deletion removing sequences between the Fused in Glioblastoma (FIG) gene and the receptor tyrosine kinase (ROS), producing a fusion protein (FIG-ROS). The abnormal FIG-ROS fusion protein has constitutively active kinase activity that causes oncogenic transformation (a transformation from normal cells to cancer cells).
* Loss of heterozygosity: loss of one allele, either by a deletion or a genetic recombination event, in an organism that previously had two different alleles.

==== Small-scale mutations ====

Small-scale mutations affect a gene in one or a few nucleotides. (If only a single nucleotide is affected, they are called point mutations.) Small-scale mutations include:
* Insertions add one or more extra nucleotides into the DNA. They are usually caused by transposable elements, or errors during replication of repeating elements. Insertions in the coding region of a gene may alter splicing of the mRNA (splice site mutation), or cause a shift in the reading frame (frameshift), both of which can significantly alter the gene product. Insertions can be reversed by excision of the transposable element.
* Deletions remove one or more nucleotides from the DNA. Like insertions, these mutations can alter the reading frame of the gene. In general, they are irreversible: Though exactly the same sequence might, in theory, be restored by an insertion, transposable elements able to revert a very short deletion (say 1–2 bases) in &quot;any&quot; location either are highly unlikely to exist or do not exist at all.
* Substitution mutations, often caused by chemicals or malfunction of DNA replication, exchange a single nucleotide for another. These changes are classified as transitions or transversions. Most common is the transition that exchanges a purine for a purine (A ↔ G) or a pyrimidine for a pyrimidine, (C ↔ T). A transition can be caused by nitrous acid, base mispairing, or mutagenic base analogues such as BrdU. Less common is a transversion, which exchanges a purine for a pyrimidine or a pyrimidine for a purine (C/T ↔ A/G). An example of a transversion is the conversion of adenine (A) into a cytosine (C). Point mutations are modifications of single base pairs of DNA or other small base pairs within a gene. A point mutation can be reversed by another point mutation, in which the nucleotide is changed back to its original state (true reversion) or by second-site reversion (a complementary mutation elsewhere that results in regained gene functionality). As discussed below, point mutations that occur within the protein coding region of a gene may be classified as synonymous or nonsynonymous substitutions, the latter of which in turn can be divided into missense or nonsense mutations.

=== By impact on protein sequence ===


The effect of a mutation on protein sequence depends in part on where in the genome it occurs, especially whether it is in a coding or non-coding region. Mutations in the non-coding regulatory sequences of a gene, such as promoters, enhancers, and silencers, can alter levels of gene expression, but are less likely to alter the protein sequence. Mutations within introns and in regions with no known biological function (e.g. pseudogenes, retrotransposons) are generally neutral, having no effect on phenotype – though intron mutations could alter the protein product if they affect mRNA splicing.

Mutations that occur in coding regions of the genome are more likely to alter the protein product, and can be categorized by their effect on amino acid sequence:
* A frameshift mutation is caused by insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides that is not evenly divisible by three from a DNA sequence. Due to the triplet nature of gene expression by codons, the insertion or deletion can disrupt the reading frame, or the grouping of the codons, resulting in a completely different translation from the original. The earlier in the sequence the deletion or insertion occurs, the more altered the protein produced is. (For example, the code CCU GAC UAC CUA codes for the amino acids proline, aspartic acid, tyrosine, and leucine. If the U in CCU was deleted, the resulting sequence would be CCG ACU ACC UAx, which would instead code for proline, threonine, threonine, and part of another amino acid or perhaps a stop codon (where the x stands for the following nucleotide).) By contrast, any insertion or deletion that is evenly divisible by three is termed an &quot;in-frame mutation&quot;.
* A point substitution mutation results in a change in a single nucleotide and can be either synonymous or nonsynonymous.
** A synonymous substitution replaces a codon with another codon that codes for the same amino acid, so that the produced amino acid sequence is not modified. Synonymous mutations occur due to the degenerate nature of the genetic code. If this mutation does not result in any phenotypic effects, then it is called silent, but not all synonymous substitutions are silent. (There can also be silent mutations in nucleotides outside of the coding regions, such as the introns, because the exact nucleotide sequence is not as crucial as it is in the coding regions, but these are not considered synonymous substitutions.)
** A nonsynonymous substitution replaces a codon with another codon that codes for a different amino acid, so that the produced amino acid sequence is modified. Nonsynonymous substitutions can be classified as nonsense or missense mutations:
*** A missense mutation changes a nucleotide to cause substitution of a different amino acid. This in turn can render the resulting protein nonfunctional. Such mutations are responsible for diseases such as Epidermolysis bullosa, sickle-cell disease, and SOD1-mediated ALS. On the other hand, if a missense mutation occurs in an amino acid codon that results in the use of a different, but chemically similar, amino acid, then sometimes little or no change is rendered in the protein. For example, a change from AAA to AGA will encode arginine, a chemically similar molecule to the intended lysine. In this latter case the mutation will have little or no effect on phenotype and therefore be neutral.
*** A nonsense mutation is a point mutation in a sequence of DNA that results in a premature stop codon, or a &quot;nonsense codon&quot; in the transcribed mRNA, and possibly a truncated, and often nonfunctional protein product. This sort of mutation has been linked to different diseases, such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia. (See Stop codon.)

=== By effect on function ===
A mutation becomes an effect on function mutation when the exactitude of functions between a mutated protein and its direct interactor undergoes change. The interactors can be other proteins, molecules, nucleic acids, etc. There are many mutations that fall under the category of by effect on function, but depending on the specificity of the change the mutations listed below will occur.
* Loss-of-function mutations, also called inactivating mutations, result in the gene product having less or no function (being partially or wholly inactivated). When the allele has a complete loss of function (null allele), it is often called an amorph or amorphic mutation in Muller&#x27;s morphs schema. Phenotypes associated with such mutations are most often recessive. Exceptions are when the organism is haploid, or when the reduced dosage of a normal gene product is not enough for a normal phenotype (this is called haploinsufficiency). A disease that is caused by a loss-of-function mutation is Gitelman syndrome and cystic fibrosis.
* Gain-of-function mutations also called activating mutations, change the gene product such that its effect gets stronger (enhanced activation) or even is superseded by a different and abnormal function. When the new allele is created, a heterozygote containing the newly created allele as well as the original will express the new allele; genetically this defines the mutations as dominant phenotypes. Several of Muller&#x27;s morphs correspond to the gain of function, including hypermorph (increased gene expression) and neomorph (novel function).
* Dominant negative mutations (also called anti-morphic mutations) have an altered gene product that acts antagonistically to the wild-type allele. These mutations usually result in an altered molecular function (often inactive) and are characterized by a dominant or semi-dominant phenotype. In humans, dominant negative mutations have been implicated in cancer (e.g., mutations in genes p53, ATM, CEBPA, and PPARgamma). Marfan syndrome is caused by mutations in the FBN1 gene, located on chromosome 15, which encodes fibrillin-1, a glycoprotein component of the extracellular matrix. Marfan syndrome is also an example of dominant negative mutation and haploinsufficiency.
* Lethal mutations result in rapid organismal death when occurring during development and cause significant reductions of life expectancy for developed organisms. An example of a disease that is caused by a dominant lethal mutation is Huntington&#x27;s disease.
* Null mutations, also known as Amorphic mutations, are a form of loss-of-function mutations that completely prohibit the gene&#x27;s function. The mutation leads to a complete loss of operation at the phenotypic level, also causing no gene product to be formed. Atopic eczema and dermatitis syndrome are common diseases caused by a null mutation of the gene that activates filaggrin.
* Suppressor mutations are a type of mutation that causes the double mutation to appear normally. In suppressor mutations the phenotypic activity of a different mutation is completely suppressed, thus causing the double mutation to look normal. There are two types of suppressor mutations, there are intragenic and extragenic suppressor mutations. Intragenic mutations occur in the gene where the first mutation occurs, while extragenic mutations occur in the gene that interacts with the product of the first mutation. A common disease that results from this type of mutation is Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.
* Neomorphic mutations are a part of the gain-of-function mutations and are characterized by the control of new protein product synthesis. The newly synthesized gene normally contains a novel gene expression or molecular function. The result of the neomorphic mutation is the gene where the mutation occurs has a complete change in function.
* A back mutation or reversion is a point mutation that restores the original sequence and hence the original phenotype.

=== By effect on fitness (harmful, beneficial, neutral mutations) ===
In genetics, it is sometimes useful to classify mutations as either or beneficial (or neutral):
* A harmful, or , mutation decreases the fitness of the organism. Many, but not all mutations in essential genes are harmful (if a mutation does not change the amino acid sequence in an essential protein, it is harmless in most cases).
* A beneficial, or advantageous mutation increases the fitness of the organism. Examples are mutations that lead to antibiotic resistance in bacteria (which are beneficial for bacteria but usually not for humans).
* A neutral mutation has no harmful or beneficial effect on the organism. Such mutations occur at a steady rate, forming the basis for the molecular clock. In the neutral theory of molecular evolution, neutral mutations provide genetic drift as the basis for most variation at the molecular level. In animals or plants, most mutations are neutral, given that the vast majority of their genomes is either non-coding or consists of repetitive sequences that have no obvious function (&quot;junk DNA&quot;).
Large-scale quantitative mutagenesis screens, in which thousands of millions of mutations are tested, invariably find that a larger fraction of mutations has harmful effects but always returns a number of beneficial mutations as well. For instance, in a screen of all gene deletions in &quot;E. coli&quot;, 80% of mutations were negative, but 20% were positive, even though many had a very small effect on growth (depending on condition). Gene &quot;deletions&quot; involve removal of whole genes, so that point mutations almost always have a much smaller effect. In a similar screen in &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;, but this time with transposon insertions, 76% of insertion mutants were classified as neutral, 16% had a significantly reduced fitness, but 6% were advantageous.

This classification is obviously relative and somewhat artificial: a harmful mutation can quickly turn into a beneficial mutations when conditions change. Also, there is a gradient from harmful/beneficial to neutral, as many mutations may have small and mostly neglectable effects but under certain conditions will become relevant. Also, many traits are determined by hundreds of genes (or loci), so that each locus has only a minor effect. For instance, human height is determined by hundreds of genetic variants (&quot;mutations&quot;) but each of them has a very minor effect on height, apart from the impact of nutrition. Height (or size) itself may be more or less beneficial as the huge range of sizes in animal or plant groups shows.

==== Distribution of fitness effects (DFE) ====

Attempts have been made to infer the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) using mutagenesis experiments and theoretical models applied to molecular sequence data. DFE, as used to determine the relative abundance of different types of mutations (i.e., strongly deleterious, nearly neutral or advantageous), is relevant to many evolutionary questions, such as the maintenance of genetic variation, the rate of genomic decay, the maintenance of outcrossing sexual reproduction as opposed to inbreeding and the evolution of sex and genetic recombination. DFE can also be tracked by tracking the skewness of the distribution of mutations with putatively severe effects as compared to the distribution of mutations with putatively mild or absent effect. In summary, the DFE plays an important role in predicting evolutionary dynamics. A variety of approaches have been used to study the DFE, including theoretical, experimental and analytical methods.
* Mutagenesis experiment: The direct method to investigate the DFE is to induce mutations and then measure the mutational fitness effects, which has already been done in viruses, bacteria, yeast, and &quot;Drosophila&quot;. For example, most studies of the DFE in viruses used site-directed mutagenesis to create point mutations and measure relative fitness of each mutant. In &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, one study used transposon mutagenesis to directly measure the fitness of a random insertion of a derivative of Tn10. In yeast, a combined mutagenesis and deep sequencing approach has been developed to generate high-quality systematic mutant libraries and measure fitness in high throughput. However, given that many mutations have effects too small to be detected and that mutagenesis experiments can detect only mutations of moderately large effect; DNA sequence analysis can provide valuable information about these mutations.
* Molecular sequence analysis: With rapid development of DNA sequencing technology, an enormous amount of DNA sequence data is available and even more is forthcoming in the future. Various methods have been developed to infer the DFE from DNA sequence data. By examining DNA sequence differences within and between species, we are able to infer various characteristics of the DFE for neutral, deleterious and advantageous mutations. To be specific, the DNA sequence analysis approach allows us to estimate the effects of mutations with very small effects, which are hardly detectable through mutagenesis experiments.

One of the earliest theoretical studies of the distribution of fitness effects was done by Motoo Kimura, an influential theoretical population geneticist. His neutral theory of molecular evolution proposes that most novel mutations will be highly deleterious, with a small fraction being neutral. A later proposal by Hiroshi Akashi proposed a bimodal model for the DFE, with modes centered around highly deleterious and neutral mutations. Both theories agree that the vast majority of novel mutations are neutral or deleterious and that advantageous mutations are rare, which has been supported by experimental results. One example is a study done on the DFE of random mutations in vesicular stomatitis virus. Out of all mutations, 39.6% were lethal, 31.2% were non-lethal deleterious, and 27.1% were neutral. Another example comes from a high throughput mutagenesis experiment with yeast. In this experiment it was shown that the overall DFE is bimodal, with a cluster of neutral mutations, and a broad distribution of deleterious mutations.

Though relatively few mutations are advantageous, those that are play an important role in evolutionary changes. Like neutral mutations, weakly selected advantageous mutations can be lost due to random genetic drift, but strongly selected advantageous mutations are more likely to be fixed. Knowing the DFE of advantageous mutations may lead to increased ability to predict the evolutionary dynamics. Theoretical work on the DFE for advantageous mutations has been done by John H. Gillespie and H. Allen Orr. They proposed that the distribution for advantageous mutations should be exponential under a wide range of conditions, which, in general, has been supported by experimental studies, at least for strongly selected advantageous mutations.

In general, it is accepted that the majority of mutations are neutral or deleterious, with advantageous mutations being rare; however, the proportion of types of mutations varies between species. This indicates two important points: first, the proportion of effectively neutral mutations is likely to vary between species, resulting from dependence on effective population size; second, the average effect of deleterious mutations varies dramatically between species. In addition, the DFE also differs between coding regions and noncoding regions, with the DFE of noncoding DNA containing more weakly selected mutations.

=== By inheritance ===

In multicellular organisms with dedicated reproductive cells, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations, which can be passed on to descendants through their reproductive cells, and somatic mutations (also called acquired mutations), which involve cells outside the dedicated reproductive group and which are not usually transmitted to descendants.

Diploid organisms (e.g., humans) contain two copies of each gene—a paternal and a maternal allele. Based on the occurrence of mutation on each chromosome, we may classify mutations into three types. A wild type or homozygous non-mutated organism is one in which neither allele is mutated.
* A heterozygous mutation is a mutation of only one allele.
* A homozygous mutation is an identical mutation of both the paternal and maternal alleles.
* Compound heterozygous mutations or a genetic compound consists of two different mutations in the paternal and maternal alleles.

==== Germline mutation ====

A germline mutation in the reproductive cells of an individual gives rise to a &quot;constitutional mutation&quot; in the offspring, that is, a mutation that is present in every cell. A constitutional mutation can also occur very soon after fertilization, or continue from a previous constitutional mutation in a parent. A germline mutation can be passed down through subsequent generations of organisms.

The distinction between germline and somatic mutations is important in animals that have a dedicated germline to produce reproductive cells. However, it is of little value in understanding the effects of mutations in plants, which lack a dedicated germline. The distinction is also blurred in those animals that reproduce asexually through mechanisms such as budding, because the cells that give rise to the daughter organisms also give rise to that organism&#x27;s germline.

A new germline mutation not inherited from either parent is called a &quot;&quot; mutation.

==== Somatic mutation ====
A change in the genetic structure that is not inherited from a parent, and also not passed to offspring, is called a somatic mutation&quot;.&quot; Somatic mutations are not inherited by an organism&#x27;s offspring because they do not affect the germline. However, they are passed down to all the progeny of a mutated cell within the same organism during mitosis. A major section of an organism therefore might carry the same mutation. These types of mutations are usually prompted by environmental causes, such as ultraviolet radiation or any exposure to certain harmful chemicals, and can cause diseases including cancer.&quot;&quot;

With plants, some somatic mutations can be propagated without the need for seed production, for example, by grafting and stem cuttings. These type of mutation have led to new types of fruits, such as the &quot;Delicious&quot; apple and the &quot;Washington&quot; navel orange.

Human and mouse somatic cells have a mutation rate more than ten times higher than the germline mutation rate for both species; mice have a higher rate of both somatic and germline mutations per cell division than humans. The disparity in mutation rate between the germline and somatic tissues likely reflects the greater importance of genome maintenance in the germline than in the soma.

=== Special classes ===

* Conditional mutation is a mutation that has wild-type (or less severe) phenotype under certain &quot;permissive&quot; environmental conditions and a mutant phenotype under certain &quot;restrictive&quot; conditions. For example, a temperature-sensitive mutation can cause cell death at high temperature (restrictive condition), but might have no deleterious consequences at a lower temperature (permissive condition). These mutations are non-autonomous, as their manifestation depends upon presence of certain conditions, as opposed to other mutations which appear autonomously. The permissive conditions may be temperature, certain chemicals, light or mutations in other parts of the genome. &quot;In vivo&quot; mechanisms like transcriptional switches can create conditional mutations. For instance, association of Steroid Binding Domain can create a transcriptional switch that can change the expression of a gene based on the presence of a steroid ligand. Conditional mutations have applications in research as they allow control over gene expression. This is especially useful studying diseases in adults by allowing expression after a certain period of growth, thus eliminating the deleterious effect of gene expression seen during stages of development in model organisms. DNA Recombinase systems like Cre-Lox recombination used in association with promoters that are activated under certain conditions can generate conditional mutations. Dual Recombinase technology can be used to induce multiple conditional mutations to study the diseases which manifest as a result of simultaneous mutations in multiple genes. Certain inteins have been identified which splice only at certain permissive temperatures, leading to improper protein synthesis and thus, loss-of-function mutations at other temperatures. Conditional mutations may also be used in genetic studies associated with ageing, as the expression can be changed after a certain time period in the organism&#x27;s lifespan.
* Replication timing quantitative trait loci affects DNA replication.

=== Nomenclature ===
In order to categorize a mutation as such, the &quot;normal&quot; sequence must be obtained from the DNA of a &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;healthy&quot; organism (as opposed to a &quot;mutant&quot; or &quot;sick&quot; one), it should be identified and reported; ideally, it should be made publicly available for a straightforward nucleotide-by-nucleotide comparison, and agreed upon by the scientific community or by a group of expert geneticists and biologists, who have the responsibility of establishing the &quot;standard&quot; or so-called &quot;consensus&quot; sequence. This step requires a tremendous scientific effort. Once the consensus sequence is known, the mutations in a genome can be pinpointed, described, and classified. The committee of the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) has developed the standard human sequence variant nomenclature, which should be used by researchers and DNA diagnostic centers to generate unambiguous mutation descriptions. In principle, this nomenclature can also be used to describe mutations in other organisms. The nomenclature specifies the type of mutation and base or amino acid changes.
* Nucleotide substitution (e.g., 76A&gt;T) – The number is the position of the nucleotide from the 5&#x27; end; the first letter represents the wild-type nucleotide, and the second letter represents the nucleotide that replaced the wild type. In the given example, the adenine at the 76th position was replaced by a thymine.
** If it becomes necessary to differentiate between mutations in genomic DNA, mitochondrial DNA, and RNA, a simple convention is used. For example, if the 100th base of a nucleotide sequence mutated from G to C, then it would be written as g.100G&gt;C if the mutation occurred in genomic DNA, m.100G&gt;C if the mutation occurred in mitochondrial DNA, or r.100g&gt;c if the mutation occurred in RNA. Note that, for mutations in RNA, the nucleotide code is written in lower case.
* Amino acid substitution (e.g., D111E) – The first letter is the one letter code of the wild-type amino acid, the number is the position of the amino acid from the N-terminus, and the second letter is the one letter code of the amino acid present in the mutation. Nonsense mutations are represented with an X for the second amino acid (e.g. D111X).
* Amino acid deletion (e.g., ΔF508) – The Greek letter Δ (delta) indicates a deletion. The letter refers to the amino acid present in the wild type and the number is the position from the N terminus of the amino acid were it to be present as in the wild type.

== Mutation rates ==

Mutation rates vary substantially across species, and the evolutionary forces that generally determine mutation are the subject of ongoing investigation.

In humans, the mutation rate is about 50–90 &quot;de novo&quot; mutations per genome per generation, that is, each human accumulates about 50–90 novel mutations that were not present in his or her parents. This number has been established by sequencing thousands of human trios, that is, two parents and at least one child.

The genomes of RNA viruses are based on RNA rather than DNA. The RNA viral genome can be double-stranded (as in DNA) or single-stranded. In some of these viruses (such as the single-stranded human immunodeficiency virus), replication occurs quickly, and there are no mechanisms to check the genome for accuracy. This error-prone process often results in mutations.

The rate of de novo mutations, whether germline or somatic, vary among organisms. Individuals within the same species can even express varying rates of mutation. Overall, rates of de novo mutations are low compared to those of inherited mutations, which categorizes them as rare forms of genetic variation. Many observations of de novo mutation rates have associated higher rates of mutation correlated to paternal age. In sexually reproducing organisms, the comparatively higher frequency of cell divisions in the parental sperm donor germline drive conclusions that rates of de novo mutation can be tracked along a common basis. The frequency of error during the DNA replication process of gametogenesis, especially amplified in the rapid production of sperm cells, can promote more opportunities for de novo mutations to replicate unregulated by DNA repair machinery. This claim combines the observed effects of increased probability for mutation in rapid spermatogenesis with short periods of time between cellular divisions that limit the efficiency of repair machinery. Rates of de novo mutations that affect an organism during its development can also increase with certain environmental factors. For example, certain intensities of exposure to radioactive elements can inflict damage to an organism&#x27;s genome, heightening rates of mutation. In humans, the appearance of skin cancer during one&#x27;s lifetime is induced by overexposure to UV radiation that causes mutations in the cellular and skin genome.

=== Randomness of mutations ===
There is a widespread assumption that mutations are (entirely) &quot;random&quot; with respect to their consequences (in terms of probability). This was shown to be wrong as mutation frequency can vary across regions of the genome, with such DNA repair- and mutation-biases being associated with various factors. For instance, Monroe and colleagues demonstrated that—in the studied plant (&quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot;)—more important genes mutate less frequently than less important ones. They demonstrated that mutation is &quot;non-random in a way that benefits the plant&quot;. Additionally, previous experiments typically used to demonstrate mutations being random with respect to fitness (such as the Fluctuation Test and Replica plating) have been shown to only support the weaker claim that those mutations are random with respect to external selective constraints, not fitness as a whole.

== Disease causation ==
Changes in DNA caused by mutation in a coding region of DNA can cause errors in protein sequence that may result in partially or completely non-functional proteins. Each cell, in order to function correctly, depends on thousands of proteins to function in the right places at the right times. When a mutation alters a protein that plays a critical role in the body, a medical condition can result. One study on the comparison of genes between different species of &quot;Drosophila&quot; suggests that if a mutation does change a protein, the mutation will most likely be harmful, with an estimated 70 per cent of amino acid polymorphisms having damaging effects, and the remainder being either neutral or weakly beneficial. Some mutations alter a gene&#x27;s DNA base sequence but do not change the protein made by the gene. Studies have shown that only 7% of point mutations in noncoding DNA of yeast are deleterious and 12% in coding DNA are deleterious. The rest of the mutations are either neutral or slightly beneficial.

=== Inherited disorders ===

If a mutation is present in a germ cell, it can give rise to offspring that carries the mutation in all of its cells. This is the case in hereditary diseases. In particular, if there is a mutation in a DNA repair gene within a germ cell, humans carrying such germline mutations may have an increased risk of cancer. A list of 34 such germline mutations is given in the article DNA repair-deficiency disorder. An example of one is albinism, a mutation that occurs in the &quot;OCA1&quot; or &quot;OCA2&quot; gene. Individuals with this disorder are more prone to many types of cancers, other disorders and have impaired vision.

DNA damage can cause an error when the DNA is replicated, and this error of replication can cause a gene mutation that, in turn, could cause a genetic disorder. DNA damages are repaired by the DNA repair system of the cell. Each cell has a number of pathways through which enzymes recognize and repair damages in DNA. Because DNA can be damaged in many ways, the process of DNA repair is an important way in which the body protects itself from disease. Once DNA damage has given rise to a mutation, the mutation cannot be repaired.

=== Role in carcinogenesis ===

On the other hand, a mutation may occur in a somatic cell of an organism. Such mutations will be present in all descendants of this cell within the same organism. The accumulation of certain mutations over generations of somatic cells is part of cause of malignant transformation, from normal cell to cancer cell.

Cells with heterozygous loss-of-function mutations (one good copy of gene and one mutated copy) may function normally with the unmutated copy until the good copy has been spontaneously somatically mutated. This kind of mutation happens often in living organisms, but it is difficult to measure the rate. Measuring this rate is important in predicting the rate at which people may develop cancer.

Point mutations may arise from spontaneous mutations that occur during DNA replication. The rate of mutation may be increased by mutagens. Mutagens can be physical, such as radiation from UV rays, X-rays or extreme heat, or chemical (molecules that misplace base pairs or disrupt the helical shape of DNA). Mutagens associated with cancers are often studied to learn about cancer and its prevention.

== Beneficial and conditional mutations ==
Although mutations that cause changes in protein sequences can be harmful to an organism, on occasions the effect may be positive in a given environment. In this case, the mutation may enable the mutant organism to withstand particular environmental stresses better than wild-type organisms, or reproduce more quickly. In these cases a mutation will tend to become more common in a population through natural selection. That said, the same mutation can be beneficial in one condition and disadvantageous in another condition. Examples include the following:

HIV resistance: a specific 32 base pair deletion in human CCR5 (CCR5-Δ32) confers HIV resistance to homozygotes and delays AIDS onset in heterozygotes. One possible explanation of the etiology of the relatively high frequency of CCR5-Δ32 in the European population is that it conferred resistance to the bubonic plague in mid-14th century Europe. People with this mutation were more likely to survive infection; thus its frequency in the population increased. This theory could explain why this mutation is not found in Southern Africa, which remained untouched by bubonic plague. A newer theory suggests that the selective pressure on the CCR5 Delta 32 mutation was caused by smallpox instead of the bubonic plague.

Malaria resistance: An example of a harmful mutation is sickle-cell disease, a blood disorder in which the body produces an abnormal type of the oxygen-carrying substance haemoglobin in the red blood cells. One-third of all indigenous inhabitants of Sub-Saharan Africa carry the allele, because, in areas where malaria is common, there is a survival value in carrying only a single sickle-cell allele (sickle cell trait). Those with only one of the two alleles of the sickle-cell disease are more resistant to malaria, since the infestation of the malaria &quot;Plasmodium&quot; is halted by the sickling of the cells that it infests.

Antibiotic resistance: Practically all bacteria develop antibiotic resistance when exposed to antibiotics. In fact, bacterial populations already have such mutations that get selected under antibiotic selection. Obviously, such mutations are only beneficial for the bacteria but not for those infected.

Lactase persistence. A mutation allowed humans to express the enzyme lactase after they are naturally weaned from breast milk, allowing adults to digest lactose, which is likely one of the most beneficial mutations in recent human evolution.

== Role in evolution ==
By introducing novel genetic qualities to a population of organisms, de novo mutations play a critical role in the combined forces of evolutionary change. However, the weight of genetic diversity generated by mutational change is often considered a generally &quot;weak&quot; evolutionary force. Although the random emergence of mutations alone provides the basis for genetic variation across all organic life, this force must be taken in consideration alongside all evolutionary forces at play. Spontaneous de novo mutations as cataclysmic events of speciation depend on factors introduced by natural selection, genetic flow, and genetic drift. For example, smaller populations with heavy mutational input (high rates of mutation) are prone to increases of genetic variation which lead to speciation in future generations. In contrast, larger populations tend to see lesser effects of newly introduced mutated traits. In these conditions, selective forces diminish the frequency of mutated alleles, which are most often deleterious, over time.

== Compensated pathogenic deviations ==
Compensated pathogenic deviations refer to amino acid residues in a protein sequence that are pathogenic in one species but are wild type residues in the functionally equivalent protein in another species. Although the amino acid residue is pathogenic in the first species, it is not so in the second species because its pathogenicity is compensated by one or more amino acid substitutions in the second species. The compensatory mutation can occur in the same protein or in another protein with which it interacts.

It is critical to understand the effects of compensatory mutations in the context of fixed deleterious mutations due to the population fitness decreasing because of fixation. Effective population size refers to a population that is reproducing. An increase in this population size has been correlated with a decreased rate of genetic diversity. The position of a population relative to the critical effect population size is essential to determine the effect deleterious alleles will have on fitness. If the population is below the critical effective size fitness will decrease drastically, however if the population is above the critical effect size, fitness can increase regardless of deleterious mutations due to compensatory alleles.

=== Compensatory mutations in RNA ===
As the function of a RNA molecule is dependent on its structure, the structure of RNA molecules is evolutionarily conserved. Therefore, any mutation that alters the stable structure of RNA molecules must be compensated by other compensatory mutations. In the context of RNA, the sequence of the RNA can be considered as &#x27; genotype&#x27; and the structure of the RNA can be considered as its &#x27;phenotype&#x27;. Since RNAs have relatively simpler composition than proteins, the structure of RNA molecules can be computationally predicted with high degree of accuracy. Because of this convenience, compensatory mutations have been studied in computational simulations using RNA folding algorithms.

=== Evolutionary mechanism of compensation ===
Compensatory mutations can be explained by the genetic phenomenon epistasis whereby the phenotypic effect of one mutation is dependent upon mutation(s) at other loci. While epistasis was originally conceived in the context of interaction between different genes, intragenic epistasis has also been studied recently. Existence of compensated pathogenic deviations can be explained by &#x27;sign epistasis&#x27;, in which the effects of a deleterious mutation can be compensated by the presence of an epistatic mutation in another loci. For a given protein, a deleterious mutation (D) and a compensatory mutation (C) can be considered, where C can be in the same protein as D or in a different interacting protein depending on the context. The fitness effect of C itself could be neutral or somewhat deleterious such that it can still exist in the population, and the effect of D is deleterious to the extent that it cannot exist in the population. However, when C and D co-occur together, the combined fitness effect becomes neutral or positive. Thus, compensatory mutations can bring novelty to proteins by forging new pathways of protein evolution : it allows individuals to travel from one fitness peak to another through the valleys of lower fitness.

DePristo et al. 2005 outlined two models to explain the dynamics of compensatory pathogenic deviations (CPD). In the first hypothesis P is a pathogenic amino acid mutation that and C is a neutral compensatory mutation. Under these conditions, if the pathogenic mutation arises after a compensatory mutation, then P can become fixed in the population. The second model of CPDs states that P and C are both deleterious mutations resulting in fitness valleys when mutations occur simultaneously. Using publicly available, Ferrer-Costa et al. 2007 obtained compensatory mutations and human pathogenic mutation datasets that were characterized to determine what causes CPDs. Results indicate that the structural constraints and the location in protein structure determine whether compensated mutations will occur.

=== Experimental evidence of compensatory mutations ===

==== Experiment in bacteria ====
Lunzer et al. tested the outcome of swapping divergent amino acids between two orthologous proteins of isopropymalate dehydrogenase (IMDH). They substituted 168 amino acids in &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; IMDH that are wild type residues in IMDH &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;. They found that over one third of these substitutions compromised IMDH enzymatic activity in the &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; genetic background. This demonstrated that identical amino acid states can result in different phenotypic states depending on the genetic background. Corrigan et al. 2011 demonstrated how &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; was able to grow normally without the presence of lipoteichoic acid due to compensatory mutations. Whole genome sequencing results revealed that when Cyclic-di-AMP phosphodiesterase (GdpP) was disrupted in this bacterium, it compensated for the disappearance of the cell wall polymer, resulting in normal cell growth.

Research has shown that bacteria can gain drug resistance through compensatory mutations that do not impede or having little effect on fitness. Previous research from Gagneux et al. 2006 has found that laboratory grown &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; strains with rifampicin resistance have reduced fitness, however drug resistant clinical strains of this pathogenic bacteria do not have reduced fitness. Comas et al. 2012 used whole genome comparisons between clinical strains and lab derived mutants to determine the role and contribution of compensatory mutations in drug resistance to rifampicin. Genome analysis reveal rifampicin resistant strains have a mutation in rpoA and rpoC. A similar study investigated the bacterial fitness associated with compensatory mutations in rifampin resistant &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;. Results obtained from this study demonstrate that drug resistance is linked to bacterial fitness as higher fitness costs are linked to greater transcription errors.

==== Experiment in virus ====
Gong et al. collected obtained genotype data of influenza nucleoprotein from different timelines and temporally ordered them according to their time of origin. Then they isolated 39 amino acid substitutions that occurred in different timelines and substituted them in a genetic background that approximated the ancestral genotype. They found that 3 of the 39 substitutions significantly reduced the fitness of the ancestral background. Compensatory mutations are new mutations that arise and have a positive or neutral impact on a populations fitness. Previous research has shown that populations have can compensate detrimental mutations. Burch and Chao tested Fisher&#x27;s geometric model of adaptive evolution by testing whether bacteriophage φ6 evolves by small steps. Their results showed that bacteriophage φ6 fitness declined rapidly and recovered in small steps . Viral nucleoproteins have been shown to avoid cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) through arginine-to glycine substitutions. This substitution mutations impacts the fitness of viral nucleoproteins, however compensatory co-mutations impede fitness declines and aid the virus to avoid recognition from CTLs. Mutations can have three different effects; mutations can have deleterious effects, some increase fitness through compensatory mutations, and lastly mutations can be counterbalancing resulting in compensatory neutral mutations.

== Application in human evolution and disease ==
In the human genome, the frequency and characteristics of de novo mutations have been studied as important contextual factors to our evolution. Compared to the human reference genome, a typical human genome varies at approximately 4.1 to 5.0 million loci, and the majority of this genetic diversity is shared by nearly 0.5% of the population. The typical human genome also contains 40,000 to 200,000 rare variants observed in less than 0.5% of the population that can only have occurred from at least one de novo germline mutation in the history of human evolution. De novo mutations have also been researched as playing a crucial role in the persistence of genetic disease in humans. With recents advancements in next-generation sequencing (NGS), all types of de novo mutations within the genome can be directly studied, the detection of which provides a magnitude of insight toward the causes of both rare and common genetic disorders. Currently, the best estimate of the average human germline SNV mutation rate is 1.18 x 10^-8, with an approximate ~78 novel mutations per generation. The ability to conduct whole genome sequencing of parents and offspring allows for the comparison of mutation rates between generations, narrowing down the origin possibilities of certain genetic disorders.

<text>In neuroanatomy, a microgyrus is an area of the cerebral cortex that includes only four cortical layers instead of six.

Microgyria are believed by some to be part of the genetic lack of prenatal development which is a cause of, or one of the causes of, dyslexia.

Albert Galaburda of Harvard Medical School noticed that language centers in dyslexic brains showed microscopic flaws known as ectopias and microgyria (Galaburda &quot;et al.&quot;, 2006, &quot;Nature Neuroscience&quot; 9(10): 1213–1217). Both affect the normal six-layer structure of the cortex. These flaws affect connectivity and functionality of the cortex in critical areas related to sound and visual processing. These and similar structural abnormalities may be the basis of the inevitable and hard to overcome difficulty in reading.

<text>Mercantilism is a nationalist economic policy that is designed to maximize the exports and minimize the imports of an economy. In other words, it seeks to maximize the accumulation of resources within the country and use those resources for one-sided trade. 

The concept aims to reduce a possible current account deficit or reach a current account surplus, and it includes measures aimed at accumulating monetary reserves by a positive balance of trade, especially of finished goods. Historically, such policies may have contributed to war and motivated colonial expansion. Mercantilist theory varies in sophistication from one writer to another and has evolved over time.

Mercantilism promotes government regulation of a nation&#x27;s economy for the purpose of augmenting and bolstering state power at the expense of rival national powers. High tariffs, especially on manufactured goods, were almost universally a feature of mercantilist policy. Before it fell into decline, mercantilism was dominant in modernized parts of Europe and some areas in Africa from the 16th to the 19th centuries, a period of proto-industrialization. Some commentators argue that it is still practised in the economies of industrializing countries in the form of economic interventionism.

With the efforts of supranational organizations such as the World Trade Organization to reduce tariffs globally, non-tariff barriers to trade have assumed a greater importance in neomercantilism.

==History==

Mercantilism became the dominant school of economic thought in Europe throughout the late Renaissance and the early modern period (from the 15th to the 18th centuries). Evidence of mercantilistic practices appeared in early modern Venice, Genoa, and Pisa regarding control of the Mediterranean trade in bullion. However, the empiricism of the Renaissance, which first began to quantify large-scale trade accurately, marked the beginning of mercantilism as a codified school of economic theories. The Italian economist and mercantilist Antonio Serra is considered to have written one of the first treatises on political economy in his 1613 work, &quot;A Short Treatise on the Wealth and Poverty of Nations&quot;.

Mercantilism in its simplest form is bullionism, yet mercantilist writers emphasize the circulation of money and reject hoarding. Their emphasis on monetary metals accords with modern ideas regarding the money supply, such as the stimulating effect of a growing money supply. Fiat money and floating exchange rates have since rendered specie concerns irrelevant. In time, industrial policy supplanted the heavy emphasis on money, accompanied by a shift in focus from the capacity to carry on wars to promoting general prosperity.

England began the first large-scale and integrative approach to mercantilism during the Elizabethan Era (1558–1603). An early statement on national balance of trade appeared in &quot;Discourse of the Common Wealth of this Realm of England&quot;, 1549: &quot;We must always take heed that we buy no more from strangers than we sell them, for so should we impoverish ourselves and enrich them.&quot; The period featured various but often disjointed efforts by the court of Queen Elizabeth I (r. 1558–1603) to develop a naval and merchant fleet capable of challenging the Spanish stranglehold on trade and of expanding the growth of bullion at home. Queen Elizabeth promoted the Trade and Navigation Acts in Parliament and issued orders to her navy for the protection and promotion of English shipping.

Authors noted most for establishing the English mercantilist system include Gerard de Malynes ( 1585–1641) and Thomas Mun (1571–1641), who first articulated the Elizabethan system (&quot;England&#x27;s Treasure by Foreign Trade or the Balance of Foreign Trade is the Rule of Our Treasure&quot;), which Josiah Child (–1699) then developed further.

Numerous French authors helped cement French policy around statist mercantilism in the 17th century, as King Louis XIV (reigned 1643–1715) followed the guidance of Jean Baptiste Colbert, his Controller-General of Finances from 1665 to 1683 who revised the tariff system and expanded industrial policy. Colbertism was based on the principle that the state should rule in the economic realm as it did in the diplomatic, and that the interests of the state as identified by the king were superior to those of merchants and of everyone else. Mercantilist economic policies aimed to build up the state, especially in an age of incessant warfare, and theorists charged the state with looking for ways to strengthen the economy and to weaken foreign adversaries.

In Europe, academic belief in mercantilism began to fade in the late-18th century after the East India Company annexed the Mughal Bengal, a major trading nation, and the establishment of British India through the activities of the East India Company, in light of the arguments of Adam Smith (1723–1790) and of the classical economists. French economic policy liberalized greatly under Napoleon (in power from 1799 to 1814/1815). The British Parliament&#x27;s repeal of the Corn Laws under Robert Peel in 1846 symbolized the emergence of free trade as an alternative system.

==Theory==

Most of the European economists who wrote between 1500 and 1750 are today generally described as mercantilists; this term was initially used solely by critics, such as Mirabeau and Smith, but historians proved quick to adopt it. Originally the standard English term was &quot;mercantile system&quot;. The word &quot;mercantilism&quot; came into English from German in the early-19th century.

The bulk of what is commonly called &quot;mercantilist literature&quot; appeared in the 1620s in Great Britain. Smith saw the English merchant Thomas Mun (1571–1641) as a major creator of the mercantile system, especially in his posthumously published &quot;Treasure by Foreign Trade&quot; (1664), which Smith considered the archetype or manifesto of the movement. Perhaps the last major mercantilist work was James Steuart&#x27;s &quot;Principles of Political Economy&quot;, published in 1767.

Mercantilist literature also extended beyond England. Italy and France produced noted writers of mercantilist themes, including Italy&#x27;s Giovanni Botero (1544–1617) and Antonio Serra (1580–?) and, in France, Jean Bodin and Colbert. Themes also existed in writers from the German historical school from List, as well as followers of the American and British systems of free-trade, thus stretching the system into the 19th century. However, many British writers, including Mun and Misselden, were merchants, while many of the writers from other countries were public officials. Beyond mercantilism as a way of understanding the wealth and power of nations, Mun and Misselden are noted for their viewpoints on a wide range of economic matters.

The Austrian lawyer and scholar Philipp Wilhelm von Hornick, one of the pioneers of Cameralism, detailed a nine-point program of what he deemed effective national economy in his &quot;Austria Over All, If She Only Will&quot; of 1684, which comprehensively sums up the tenets of mercantilism:
* That every little bit of a country&#x27;s soil be utilized for agriculture, mining or manufacturing.
* That all raw materials found in a country be used in domestic manufacture, since finished goods have a higher value than raw materials.
* That a large, working population be encouraged.
* That all exports of gold and silver be prohibited and all domestic money be kept in circulation.
* That all imports of foreign goods be discouraged as much as possible.
* That where certain imports are indispensable they be obtained at first hand, in exchange for other domestic goods instead of gold and silver.
* That as much as possible, imports be confined to raw materials that can be finished [in the home country].
* That opportunities be constantly sought for selling a country&#x27;s surplus manufactures to foreigners, so far as necessary, for gold and silver.
* That no importation be allowed if such goods are sufficiently and suitably supplied at home.

Other than Von Hornick, there were no mercantilist writers presenting an overarching scheme for the ideal economy, as Adam Smith would later do for classical economics. Rather, each mercantilist writer tended to focus on a single area of the economy. Only later did non-mercantilist scholars integrate these &quot;diverse&quot; ideas into what they called mercantilism. Some scholars thus reject the idea of mercantilism completely, arguing that it gives &quot;a false unity to disparate events&quot;. Smith saw the mercantile system as an enormous conspiracy by manufacturers and merchants against consumers, a view that has led some authors, especially Robert E. Ekelund and Robert D. Tollison, to call mercantilism &quot;a rent-seeking society&quot;. To a certain extent, mercantilist doctrine itself made a general theory of economics impossible. Mercantilists viewed the economic system as a zero-sum game, in which any gain by one party required a loss by another. Thus, any system of policies that benefited one group would by definition harm the other, and there was no possibility of economics being used to maximize the commonwealth, or common good. Mercantilists&#x27; writings were also generally created to rationalize particular practices rather than as investigations into the best policies.

Mercantilist domestic policy was more fragmented than its trade policy. While Adam Smith portrayed mercantilism as supportive of strict controls over the economy, many mercantilists disagreed. The early modern era was one of letters patent and government-imposed monopolies; some mercantilists supported these, but others acknowledged the corruption and inefficiency of such systems. Many mercantilists also realized that the inevitable results of quotas and price ceilings were black markets. One notion that mercantilists widely agreed upon was the need for economic oppression of the working population; laborers and farmers were to live at the &quot;margins of subsistence&quot;. The goal was to maximize production, with no concern for consumption. Extra money, free time, and education for the lower classes were seen to inevitably lead to vice and laziness, and would result in harm to the economy.

The mercantilists saw a large population as a form of wealth that made possible the development of bigger markets and armies. Opposite to mercantilism was the doctrine of physiocracy, which predicted that mankind would outgrow its resources. The idea of mercantilism was to protect the markets as well as maintain agriculture and those who were dependent upon it.

==Policies==
Mercantilist ideas were the dominant economic ideology of all of Europe in the early modern period, and most states embraced it to a certain degree. Mercantilism was centred on England and France, and it was in these states that mercantilist policies were most often enacted.

The policies have included:
* High tariffs, especially on manufactured goods.
* Forbidding colonies to trade with other nations.
* Monopolizing markets with staple ports.
* Banning the export of gold and silver, even for payments.
* Forbidding trade to be carried in foreign ships, as per, for example, the Navigation Acts.
* Subsidies on exports.
* Promoting manufacturing and industry through research or direct subsidies.
* Limiting wages.
* Maximizing the use of domestic resources.
* Restricting domestic consumption through non-tariff barriers to trade.

===France===

Mercantilism arose in France in the early 16th century soon after the monarchy had become the dominant force in French politics. In 1539, an important decree banned the import of woolen goods from Spain and some parts of Flanders. The next year, a number of restrictions were imposed on the export of bullion.

Over the rest of the 16th century, further protectionist measures were introduced. The height of French mercantilism is closely associated with Jean-Baptiste Colbert, finance minister for 22 years in the 17th century, to the extent that French mercantilism is sometimes called Colbertism. Under Colbert, the French government became deeply involved in the economy in order to increase exports. Protectionist policies were enacted that limited imports and favored exports. Industries were organized into guilds and monopolies, and production was regulated by the state through a series of more than one thousand directives outlining how different products should be produced.

To encourage industry, foreign artisans and craftsmen were imported. Colbert also worked to decrease internal barriers to trade, reducing internal tariffs and building an extensive network of roads and canals. Colbert&#x27;s policies were quite successful, and France&#x27;s industrial output and the economy grew considerably during this period, as France became the dominant European power. He was less successful in turning France into a major trading power, and Britain and the Dutch Republic remained supreme in this field.

===New France===

France imposed its mercantilist philosophy on its colonies in North America, especially New France. It sought to derive the maximum material benefit from the colony, for the homeland, with a minimum of colonial investment in the colony itself. The ideology was embodied in New France through the establishment under Royal Charter of a number of corporate trading monopolies including La Compagnie des Marchands, which operated from 1613 to 1621, and the Compagnie de Montmorency, from that date until 1627. It was in turn replaced by La Compagnie des Cent-Associés, created in 1627 by King Louis XIII, and the Communauté des habitants in 1643. These were the first corporations to operate in what is now Canada.

===United Kingdom ===

In England, mercantilism reached its peak during the Long Parliament government (1640–60). Mercantilist policies were also embraced throughout much of the Tudor and Stuart periods, with Robert Walpole being another major proponent. In Britain, government control over the domestic economy was far less extensive than on the Continent, limited by common law and the steadily increasing power of Parliament. Government-controlled monopolies were common, especially before the English Civil War, but were often controversial.

With respect to its colonies, British mercantilism meant that the government and the merchants became partners with the goal of increasing political power and private wealth, to the exclusion of other European powers. The government protected its merchants—and kept foreign ones out—through trade barriers, regulations, and subsidies to domestic industries in order to maximize exports from and minimize imports to the realm. The government had to fight smuggling, which became a favourite American technique in the 18th century to circumvent the restrictions on trading with the French, Spanish, or Dutch. The goal of mercantilism was to run trade surpluses to benefit the government. The government took its share through duties and taxes, with the remainder going to merchants in Britain. The government spent much of its revenue on the Royal Navy, which both protected the colonies of Britain but was vital in capturing the colonies of other European powers.

British mercantilist writers were themselves divided on whether domestic controls were necessary. British mercantilism thus mainly took the form of efforts to control trade. A wide array of regulations were put in place to encourage exports and discourage imports. Tariffs were placed on imports and bounties given for exports, and the export of some raw materials was banned completely. The Navigation Acts removed foreign merchants from being involved England&#x27;s domestic trade. British policies in their American colonies led to friction with the inhabitants of the Thirteen Colonies, and mercantilist policies (such as forbidding trade with other European powers and enforcing bans on smuggling) were a major irritant leading to the American Revolution.

Mercantilism taught that trade was a zero-sum game, with one country&#x27;s gain equivalent to a loss sustained by the trading partner. Some have argued that mercantilist policies had a positive impact on Britain, helping to transform the nation into the world&#x27;s dominant trading power and a global hegemon. One domestic policy that had a lasting impact was the conversion of &quot;wastelands&quot; to agricultural use. Mercantilists believed that to maximize a nation&#x27;s power, all land and resources had to be used to their highest and best use, and this era thus saw projects like the draining of The Fens.

===United States===

The American School of economics dominated United States national policies from the time of the American Civil War until the mid-20th century. It is closely related to mercantilism, and it can be seen as contrary to classical economics. It consisted of these three core policies:
# Protecting industry through selective high tariffs (especially 1861–1932) and through subsidies (especially 1932–1970).
# Government investments in infrastructure creating targeted internal improvements (especially in transportation).
# A national bank with policies that promote the growth of productive enterprises rather than speculation.

===Other countries===
The other nations of Europe also embraced mercantilism to varying degrees. The Netherlands, which had become the financial centre of Europe by being its most efficient trader, had little interest in seeing trade restricted and adopted few mercantilist policies. Mercantilism became prominent in Central Europe and Scandinavia after the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–48), with Christina of Sweden, Jacob Kettler of Courland, and Christian IV of Denmark being notable proponents.

The Habsburg Holy Roman Emperors had long been interested in mercantilist policies, but the vast and decentralized nature of their empire made implementing such notions difficult. Some constituent states of the empire did embrace mercantilism, most notably Prussia, which under Frederick the Great had perhaps the most rigidly controlled economy in Europe.

Spain benefited from mercantilism early on as it brought a large amount of precious metals such as gold and silver into their treasury by way of the new world. In the long run, Spain&#x27;s economy collapsed as it was unable to adjust to the inflation that came with the large influx of bullion. Heavy intervention from the crown put crippling laws for the protection of Spanish goods and services. Mercantilist protectionist policy in Spain caused the long-run failure of the Castilian textile industry as the efficiency severely dropped off with each passing year due to the production being held at a specific level. Spain&#x27;s heavily protected industries led to famines as much of its agricultural land was required to be used for sheep instead of grain. Much of their grain was imported from the Baltic region of Europe which caused a shortage of food in the inner regions of Spain. Spain limiting the trade of their colonies is one of the causes that led to the separation of the Dutch from the Spanish Empire. The culmination of all of these policies led to Spain defaulting in 1557, 1575, and 1596.

During the economic collapse of the 17th century, Spain had little coherent economic policy, but French mercantilist policies were imported by Philip V with some success. Ottoman Grand Vizier Kemankeş Kara Mustafa Pasha also followed some mercantilist financial policies during the reign of Ibrahim I. Russia under Peter I (Peter the Great) attempted to pursue mercantilism, but had little success because of Russia&#x27;s lack of a large merchant class or an industrial base.

==Wars and imperialism==
Mercantilism was the economic version of warfare backed up by the state apparatus, and was well suited to an era of military warfare. Since the level of world trade was viewed as fixed, it followed that the only way to increase a nation&#x27;s trade was to take it from another. A number of wars, most notably the Anglo-Dutch Wars and the Franco-Dutch Wars, can be linked directly to mercantilist theories. Most wars had other causes but they reinforced mercantilism by clearly defining the enemy, and justified damage to the enemy&#x27;s economy.

Mercantilism fueled the imperialism of this era, as many nations expended significant effort to conquer new colonies that would be sources of gold (as in Mexico) or sugar (as in the West Indies), as well as becoming exclusive markets. European power spread around the globe, often under the aegis of companies with government-guaranteed monopolies in certain defined geographical regions, such as the Dutch East India Company or the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (operating in present-day Canada).

With the establishment of overseas colonies by European powers early in the 17th century, mercantile theory gained a new and wider significance, in which its aim and ideal became both national and imperialistic.

The connection between communism and mercantilism has been explored by Marxist economist and sociologist Giovanni Arrighi, who analyzed mercantilism as having three components: &quot;settler colonialism, capitalist slavery, and economic nationalism,&quot; and further noted that slavery was &quot;partly a condition and partly a result of the success of settler colonialism.&quot;

In France, the triangular trade method was integral in the continuation of mercantilism throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. In order to maximize exports and minimize imports, France worked on a strict Atlantic route: France, to Africa, to the Americas and then back to France. By bringing African slaves to labor in the New World, their labor value increased, and France capitalized upon the market resources produced by slave labor.

Mercantilism as a weapon has continued to be used by nations through the 21st century by way of modern tariffs as it puts smaller economies in a position to conform to the larger economies goals or risk economic ruin due to an imbalance in trade. Trade wars are often dependent on such tariffs and restrictions hurting the opposing economy.

==Origins==

The term &quot;mercantile system&quot; was used by its foremost critic, Adam Smith, but Mirabeau (1715–1789) had used &quot;mercantilism&quot; earlier. Mercantilism functioned as the economic counterpart of the older version of political power: divine right of kings and absolute monarchy.

Scholars debate why mercantilism dominated economic ideology for 250 years. One group, represented by Jacob Viner, sees mercantilism as simply a straightforward, common-sense system whose logical fallacies remained opaque to people at the time, as they simply lacked the required analytical tools.

The second school, supported by scholars such as Robert B. Ekelund, portrays mercantilism not as a mistake, but rather as the best possible system for those who developed it. This school argues that rent-seeking merchants and governments developed and enforced mercantilist policies. Merchants benefited greatly from the enforced monopolies, bans on foreign competition, and poverty of the workers. Governments benefited from the high tariffs and payments from the merchants. Whereas later economic ideas were often developed by academics and philosophers, almost all mercantilist writers were merchants or government officials.

Monetarism offers a third explanation for mercantilism. European trade exported bullion to pay for goods from Asia, thus reducing the money supply and putting downward pressure on prices and economic activity. The evidence for this hypothesis is the lack of inflation in the British economy until the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, when paper money came into vogue.

A fourth explanation lies in the increasing professionalisation and technification of the wars of the era, which turned the maintenance of adequate reserve funds (in the prospect of war) into a more and more expensive and eventually competitive business.

Mercantilism developed at a time of transition for the European economy. Isolated feudal estates were being replaced by centralized nation-states as the focus of power. Technological changes in shipping and the growth of urban centers led to a rapid increase in international trade. Mercantilism focused on how this trade could best aid the states. Another important change was the introduction of double-entry bookkeeping and modern accounting. This accounting made extremely clear the inflow and outflow of trade, contributing to the close scrutiny given to the balance of trade. New markets and new mines propelled foreign trade to previously inconceivable volumes, resulting in &quot;the great upward movement in prices&quot; and an increase in &quot;the volume of merchant activity itself&quot;.

Before mercantilism, the most important work in economics in Europe was that of the medieval scholastic theorists. The goal of these thinkers was to find an economic system compatible with Christian doctrines of piety and justice. They focused mainly on microeconomics and on local exchanges between individuals. Mercantilism was closely aligned with the other theories and ideas that began to replace the medieval worldview. This period saw the adoption of Machiavellian realpolitik and the primacy of the &quot;raison d&#x27;état&quot; in international relations. The mercantilist idea of all trade as a zero-sum game, in which each side was trying to best the other in a ruthless competition, was integral to the works of Thomas Hobbes. This dark view of human nature also fit well with the Puritan view of the world, and some of the most stridently mercantilist legislation, such as the Navigation Ordinance of 1651, was enacted by the government of Oliver Cromwell.

Jean-Baptiste Colbert&#x27;s work in 17th-century France came to exemplify classical mercantilism. In the English-speaking world, its ideas were criticized by Adam Smith with the publication of &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; in 1776 and later by David Ricardo with his explanation of comparative advantage. Mercantilism was rejected by Britain and France by the mid-19th century. The British Empire embraced free trade and used its power as the financial center of the world to promote the same. The Guyanese historian Walter Rodney describes mercantilism as the period of the worldwide development of European commerce which began in the 15th century with the voyages of Portuguese and Spanish explorers to Africa, Asia, and the New World.

==End of mercantilism==
Adam Smith, David Hume, Edward Gibbon, Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau were the founding fathers of anti-mercantilist thought. A number of scholars found important flaws in mercantilism long before Smith developed an ideology that could fully replace it. Critics such as Hume, Dudley North and John Locke undermined much of mercantilism and it steadily lost favor during the 18th century.

In 1690, Locke argued that prices vary in proportion to the quantity of money. Locke&#x27;s &quot;Second Treatise&quot; also points towards the heart of the anti-mercantilist critique: that the wealth of the world is not fixed, but is created by human labor (represented embryonically by Locke&#x27;s labor theory of value). Mercantilists failed to understand the notions of absolute advantage and comparative advantage (this idea was only fully fleshed out in 1817 by David Ricardo) and the benefits of trade.

Hume famously noted the impossibility of the mercantilists&#x27; goal of a constant positive balance of trade. As bullion flowed into one country, the supply would increase, and the value of bullion in that state would steadily decline relative to other goods. Conversely, in the state exporting bullion, its value would slowly rise. Eventually, it would no longer be cost-effective to export goods from the high-price country to the low-price country, and the balance of trade would reverse. Mercantilists fundamentally misunderstood this, long arguing that an increase in the money supply simply meant that everyone gets richer.

The importance placed on bullion was also a central target, even if many mercantilists had themselves begun to de-emphasize the importance of gold and silver. Adam Smith noted that at the core of the mercantile system was the &quot;popular folly of confusing wealth with money&quot;, that bullion was just the same as any other commodity, and that there was no reason to give it special treatment. More recently, scholars have discounted the accuracy of this critique. They believe Mun and Misselden were not making this mistake in the 1620s, and point to their followers Josiah Child and Charles Davenant, who in 1699 wrote, &quot;Gold and Silver are indeed the Measures of Trade, but that the Spring and Original of it, in all nations is the Natural or Artificial Product of the Country; that is to say, what this Land or what this Labour and Industry Produces.&quot; The critique that mercantilism was a form of rent seeking has also seen criticism, as scholars such as Jacob Viner in the 1930s pointed out that merchant mercantilists such as Mun understood that they would not gain by higher prices for English wares abroad.

The first school to completely reject mercantilism was the physiocrats, who developed their theories in France. Their theories also had several important problems, and the replacement of mercantilism did not come until Adam Smith published &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; in 1776. This book outlines the basics of what is today known as classical economics. Smith spent a considerable portion of the book rebutting the arguments of the mercantilists, though often these are simplified or exaggerated versions of mercantilist thought.

Scholars are also divided over the cause of mercantilism&#x27;s end. Those who believe the theory was simply an error hold that its replacement was inevitable as soon as Smith&#x27;s more accurate ideas were unveiled. Those who feel that mercantilism amounted to rent-seeking hold that it ended only when major power shifts occurred. In Britain, mercantilism faded as the Parliament gained the monarch&#x27;s power to grant monopolies. While the wealthy capitalists who controlled the House of Commons benefited from these monopolies, Parliament found it difficult to implement them because of the high cost of group decision making.

Mercantilist regulations were steadily removed over the course of the 18th century in Britain, and during the 19th century, the British government fully embraced free trade and Smith&#x27;s laissez-faire economics. On the continent, the process was somewhat different. In France, economic control remained in the hands of the royal family, and mercantilism continued until the French Revolution. In Germany, mercantilism remained an important ideology in the 19th and early 20th centuries, when the historical school of economics was paramount.

==Legacy==
Adam Smith criticized the mercantile doctrine that prioritized production in the economy; he maintained that consumption was of prime significance. Additionally, the mercantile system was well liked by the traders as it was what is now referred to as rent seeking. John Maynard Keynes affirmed that motivating the production process was as significant as encouraging consumption, which benefited the new mercantilism. Keynes also affirmed that in the post-classical period the primary focus on gold and silver supplies (bullion) was rational. During the era before paper money, an increase in gold and silver was one of the ways of mercantilism increasing an economy&#x27;s reserve or the supply of money. Keynes reiterated that the doctrines advocated for by mercantilism aided the improvement of both the domestic and foreign outlay—domestic because the policies lowered the domestic rate of interest, and investment by foreigners by tending to create a favorable balance of trade. Keynes and other economists of the 20th century also realized that the balance of payments is an important concern. Keynes also supported government intervention in the economy as necessary, as did mercantilism.

, the word &quot;mercantilism&quot; remains a pejorative term, often used to attack various forms of protectionism.

Paul Samuelson, writing within a Keynesian framework, wrote of mercantilism, &quot;With employment less than full and Net National Product suboptimal, all the debunked mercantilist arguments turn out to be valid.&quot;

Some other systems that copy several mercantilist policies, such as Japan&#x27;s economic system, are also sometimes called neo-mercantilist. In an essay appearing in the May 14, 2007 issue of &quot;Newsweek&quot;, business columnist Robert J. Samuelson wrote that China was pursuing an essentially neo-mercantilist trade policy that threatened to undermine the post–World War II international economic structure.

After the election of Donald Trump as American president in 2024, Serbian American economist Branko Milanović described Trump&#x27;s policies of implementing tariffs on imports, trade blocs, and other barriers against China as neo-mercantilism, and that it &quot;marks a symbolic end to global neoliberalism&quot;

Murray Rothbard, representing the Austrian School of economics, describes it this way:

Rothbard viewed mercantilism not as a coherent economic theory but rather a series of post-hoc rationalizations for various economic policies by interested parties. 

In specific instances, protectionist mercantilist policies also had an important and positive impact on the state that enacted them. Adam Smith, for instance, praised the Navigation Acts, as they greatly expanded the British merchant fleet and played a central role in turning Britain into the world&#x27;s naval and economic superpower from the 18th century onward. Some economists thus feel that protecting infant industries, while causing short-term harm, can be beneficial in the long term.

<text>Meat Puppets are an American rock band formed in January 1980 in Phoenix, Arizona. The group&#x27;s original lineup was Curt Kirkwood (guitar/vocals), his brother Cris Kirkwood (bass guitar/vocals), and Derrick Bostrom (drums). The Kirkwood brothers met Bostrom while attending Brophy Prep High School in Phoenix. The three then moved to Tempe, Arizona (a Phoenix suburb and home to Arizona State University), where the Kirkwood brothers purchased two adjacent houses, one of which had a shed in the back where they regularly practiced.

Meat Puppets started as a punk rock band, but like most of their labelmates on SST Records, they established their own unique style, blending punk with country and psychedelic rock, and featuring Curt&#x27;s warbling vocals. Meat Puppets later gained significant exposure when the Kirkwood brothers served as guest musicians on Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; performance in 1993. The band&#x27;s 1994 album &quot;Too High to Die&quot; subsequently became their most successful release. The band broke up twice, in 1996 and 2002, but reunited again in 2006.

==History==
===Early career (1980–1990)===
In the late 1970s, drummer Derrick Bostrom played with guitarist Jack Knetzger in a band called Atomic Bomb Club, which began as a duo, but would come to include bassist Cris Kirkwood. The band played a few local shows and recorded some demos, but began to dissolve quickly thereafter. Derrick and Cris began rehearsing together with Cris&#x27; brother Curt Kirkwood by learning songs from Bostrom&#x27;s collection of punk rock 45s. After briefly toying with the name The Bastions of Immaturity, they settled on the name Meat Puppets in June, 1980 after a song by Curt of the same name which appears on their first album. Their earliest EP &quot;In A Car&quot; was made entirely of short hardcore punk with goofy lyrics, and attracted the attention of Joe Carducci as he was starting to work with legendary punk label SST Records. Carducci suggested they sign with the label, and Meat Puppets released their first album &quot;Meat Puppets&quot; in 1982, which among several new originals and a pair of heavily skewed Doc Watson and Bob Nolan covers, featured the songs &quot;The Gold Mine&quot; and &quot;Melons Rising&quot;, two tunes Derrick and Cris originally had written and performed as Atomic Bomb Club previously. Years later, when the Meat Puppets reissued all of their albums in 1999, the five songs on In A Car would be combined with their debut album.
By the release of 1984&#x27;s &quot;Meat Puppets II&quot;, the bandmembers &quot;were so sick of the hardcore thing,&quot; according to Bostrom. &quot;We were really into pissing off the crowd.&quot; Here, the band experimented with acid rock and country and western sounds, while still retaining some punk influence on the tracks &quot;Split Myself in Two&quot; and &quot;New Gods&quot;. This album contains some of the band&#x27;s best known songs, such as &quot;Lake of Fire&quot; and &quot;Plateau&quot;. While the album had been recorded in early 1983, the album&#x27;s release was delayed for a year by SST. &quot;Meat Puppets II&quot; turned the band into one of the leading bands on SST Records, and along with the Violent Femmes, the Gun Club and others, helped establish the genre called &quot;cow punk&quot;.

Meat Puppets II was followed by 1985&#x27;s &quot;Up on the Sun&quot;. The album&#x27;s psychedelic sound resembled the folk-rock of The Byrds, while the songs still retained hardcore influences in the lengths of the songs and the tempos. Examples of this new style are the self-titled track, &quot;Enchanted Porkfist&quot; and &quot;Swimming Ground&quot;. &quot;Up On The Sun&quot; featured the Kirkwood brothers harmonizing their vocals for the first time. These two albums were mainstays of college and independent radio at that time.

During the rest of the 1980s, Meat Puppets remained on SST and released a series of albums while touring relentlessly. Between tours they would regularly play small shows in bars around the Phoenix area such as The Mason Jar (now The Rebel Lounge) and The Sun Club in Tempe. After the release of the hard-rock styled &quot;Out My Way&quot; EP in 1986, however, the band was briefly sidelined by an accident when Curt&#x27;s finger was broken after being slammed in their touring van&#x27;s door. The accident delayed the band&#x27;s next album, the even more psychedelic &quot;Mirage&quot;, until the next year. The final result included synthesizers and electronic drums, and as such was considered their most polished sounding album to date. The tour for Mirage lasted less than 6 months, as the band found it difficult to recreate many of this album&#x27;s songs in a concert atmosphere.

Their next album, the ZZ-Top inspired &quot;Huevos&quot;, came out less than six months afterward, in late summer of 1987. In stark contrast to its predecessor, &quot;Huevos&quot; was recorded in a swift, fiery fashion, with many first takes, and minimal second guessing. These recordings were completed in only a matter of days, and along with a few drawings and one of Curt&#x27;s paintings taken from the wall to serve as cover art (a dish of three boiled eggs, a green pepper, and a bottle of Tabasco sauce), were all sent to SST shortly before the band returned to the road en route to their next gig. Curt revealed in an interview that one of the reasons for the album being called Huevos (meaning &#x27;eggs&#x27; in Spanish) was because of the predominance of first-takers on the record, as similarly eggs can only be used once.

&quot;Monsters&quot; was released in 1989, featuring new elements to their sound with extended jams (such as &quot;Touchdown King&quot; and &quot;Flight of the Fire Weasel&quot;) and heavy metal (&quot;Attacked by Monsters&quot;). This album was mostly motivated by the Meat Puppets&#x27; desire to attract the attention of a major label, as they were becoming frustrated with SST Records by this time.

===Major label career (1991–1995)===
As numerous bands from the seminal SST label and other kindred punk-oriented indies had before them, Meat Puppets grappled with the decision to switch to a major label. Two years after their final studio recording for SST, 1989&#x27;s &quot;Monsters&quot;, the trio released its major-label debut, &quot;Forbidden Places&quot;, on the indie-friendly London Records. The band chose London Records because it was the first label that ZZ Top, one of their favorite bands, was signed to.

&quot;Forbidden Places&quot; combined many elements of the band&#x27;s sounds over the years (cowpunk, psychedelia, riffy heavier rock) while some songs had a more laid back early alternative sound. Songs include &quot;Sam&quot; and &quot;Whirlpool&quot;, and the title track. Despite being a fan favorite, &quot;Forbidden Places&quot; is now out of print, and as such it remains a highly sought collectible online.

In 1992 following his departure from the Red Hot Chili Peppers, guitarist John Frusciante auditioned for the band. Cris Kirkwood stated &quot;He showed up with his guitar out of its case and barefoot. We were on a major label then, we just got signed, and those guys had blown up to where they were at and John needed to get out. John gets to our pad and we started getting ready to play and I said, &#x27;You want to use my tuner?&#x27; He said, &#x27;No, I&#x27;ll bend it in.&#x27; It was so far out. Then we jammed but it didn&#x27;t come to anything. Maybe he wasn&#x27;t in the right place and we were a tight little unit. It just didn&#x27;t quite happen but it could have worked.&quot;
In late 1993, Meat Puppets achieved mainstream popularity when Nirvana&#x27;s Kurt Cobain, who became a fan after seeing them open for Black Flag in the &#x27;80s, invited Cris and Curt to join him on &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; for acoustic performances of &quot;Plateau&quot;, &quot;Oh Me&quot; and &quot;Lake of Fire&quot; (all originally from &quot;Meat Puppets II&quot;). The resulting album, &quot;MTV Unplugged in New York,&quot; served as a swan song for Nirvana, as Cobain died less than 5 months after the concert. &quot;Lake of Fire&quot; became a cult favorite for its particularly wrenching vocal performance from Cobain. Subsequently, the Nirvana exposure and the strength of the single &quot;Backwater&quot; (their highest-charting single) helped lift Meat Puppets to new commercial heights. The band&#x27;s studio return was 1994&#x27;s &quot;Too High to Die&quot;, produced by Butthole Surfers guitarist Paul Leary. The album featured &quot;Backwater&quot;, which reached #47 on the Billboard Hot 100, and a hidden-track update of &quot;Lake of Fire&quot;. This album features a more straightforward alternative rock style, with occasional moments of pop, country and neo-psychedelic moments. &quot;Too High To Die&quot; earned the band a gold record (500,000 sold), outselling their previous records combined.

1995&#x27;s &quot;No Joke!&quot; was the final album recorded by the original Meat Puppets lineup. Stylistically it is very similar to &quot;Too High to Die&quot;, although much heavier and with darker lyrics. Examples of this are the single &quot;Scum&quot; and &quot;Eyeball&quot;, although the band&#x27;s usual laid-back style is still heard on tracks like &quot;Chemical Garden&quot;. Though the band&#x27;s drug use had long included cocaine, heroin, LSD and many others, Cris&#x27; use of heroin and crack cocaine became so bad he rarely left his house except to obtain more drugs. At least two people (including his wife and one of his best friends) died of overdoses at his house in Tempe, AZ during this time. The Kirkwood brothers had always had a legendary appetite for illegal substances and during the tour to support &quot;Too High To Die&quot; with Stone Temple Pilots, the easy availability of drugs was too much for Cris. When it was over, he was severely addicted to cocaine and heroin. When their record label discovered Cris&#x27; addictions, support for &quot;No Joke!&quot; was subsequently dropped and it was met with poor sales figures.

===First hiatus and reunion (1996–2001)===
Bostrom recorded a solo EP under the moniker &quot;Today&#x27;s Sounds&quot; in 1996, and later on in 1999 took charge of re-issuing the Puppets&#x27; original seven records on Rykodisc as well as putting out their first live album, &quot;Live in Montana.&quot; Curt formed a new band in Austin, Texas called the Royal Neanderthal Orchestra, but they changed their name to Meat Puppets for legal reasons and released a promotional EP entitled &quot;You Love Me&quot; in 1999, &quot;Golden Lies&quot; in 2000 and &quot;Live&quot; in 2002. The line-up was Curt (voc/git), Kyle Ellison (voc/git), Andrew Duplantis (voc/bass) and Shandon Sahm (drums). Sahm&#x27;s father was the legendary fiddler-singer-songwriter Doug Sahm of The Sir Douglas Quintet and Texas Tornados. The concluding track to &quot;Classic Puppets&quot; entitled &quot;New Leaf&quot; also dates from this incarnation of the band.

===Break up (2002–2005)===
Around 2002, Meat Puppets dissolved after Duplantis left the band. Curt went on to release albums with the groups Eyes Adrift and Volcano. In 2005, he released his first solo album entitled &quot;Snow&quot;.

Bassist Cris was arrested in December 2003 for attacking a security guard at the main post office in downtown Phoenix, Arizona with the guard&#x27;s baton. The guard shot Kirkwood in the stomach at least twice during the melee, causing serious gunshot injuries requiring major surgery. Kirkwood was subsequently denied bail, the judge citing Kirkwood&#x27;s previous drug arrests and probation violations. He eventually went to prison at the Arizona state prison in Florence, Arizona for felony assault. He was released in July 2005.

Derrick Bostrom began a web site for the band about six months before the original trio stopped working together. The site went through many different permutations before it was essentially mothballed in 2003. In late 2005, Bostrom revamped it, this time as a &quot;blog&quot; for his recollections and as a place to share pieces of Meat Puppets history.

===Second reunion (2006–present)===
On March 24, 2006, Curt Kirkwood polled fans at his MySpace page with a bulletin that asked: &quot;Question for all ! Would the original line up of Meat Puppets interest anyone ? Feedback is good – do you want a reunion!?&quot; The response from fans was overwhelmingly positive within a couple of hours, leading to speculation of a full-blown Meat Puppets reunion in the near future. However, a post made by Derrick Bostrom on the official Meat Puppets site dismissed the notion.

In April 2006 &quot;Billboard&quot; reported that the Kirkwood brothers would reunite as Meat Puppets without original drummer Derrick Bostrom. Although Primus drummer Tim Alexander was announced as Bostrom&#x27;s replacement, the position was later filled by Ted Marcus. The new lineup recorded a new full-length album, &quot;Rise to Your Knees&quot;, in mid-to-late 2006. The album was released by Anodyne Records on July 17, 2007.
On January 20, 2007, Meat Puppets brothers performed two songs during an Army of Anyone concert, at La Zona Rosa in Austin, Texas. The first song was played with Curt Kirkwood and Cris Kirkwood along with Army of Anyone&#x27;s Ray Luzier and Dean DeLeo. Then the second song was played with original members Curt and Cris Kirkwood and new Meat Puppets drummer Ted Marcus. This was in the middle of Army of Anyone&#x27;s set, which they listed as &quot;Meat Puppet Theatre&quot; on the evening&#x27;s set list. The band performed several new songs in March at the South by Southwest festival. On March 28, 2007, the band announced a West Coast tour through their MySpace page. This is the first tour with original bassist Cris in eleven years. The tour continued into the east coast and midwest later in 2007.

In 2008 they performed their classic second album live in its entirety at the ATP New York festival.

The band parted ways with Anodyne, signed to Megaforce and began recording new material in the winter of 2008. The resulting album, entitled &quot;Sewn Together&quot;, was released on May 12, 2009.
In the summer of 2009 the band continued to tour across America. They appeared in Rochester, Minnesota outside in front of over 5,000 fans, after playing Summerfest in Milwaukee, Wisconsin the night prior. Meat Puppets performed at the 2009 Voodoo Music Experience in New Orleans over the Halloween weekend.
As of November 2009, Shandon Sahm was back as the drummer in Meat Puppets, replacing Ted Marcus. The band was chosen by Animal Collective to perform the album &#x27;Up on the Sun&#x27; live in its entirety at the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival that they curated in May 2011.

The band&#x27;s thirteenth studio album, entitled &quot;Lollipop&quot;, was released on April 12, 2011. The Dandies supported Meat Puppets on all European dates in 2011.

Meat Puppets have played several gigs in their hometown since 2009, such as the Marquee show in June 2011 with Dead Confederate.

As of early 2011 Elmo Kirkwood, son of Curt Kirkwood and nephew of Cris Kirkwood, was touring regularly with the band playing rhythm guitar.

Meat Puppets also contributed to Spin Magazine&#x27;s exclusive album &quot;&quot;, playing Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;.

In June 2012, a book titled &quot;Too High to Die: Meet the Meat Puppets&quot; by author Greg Prato was released, which featured all-new interviews with band members past and present and friends of the band (including Peter Buck, Kim Thayil, Scott Asheton, Mike Watt, and Henry Rollins, among others), and covered the band&#x27;s entire career.

In October 2012, it was announced that the group had just completed recording new songs. &quot;Rat Farm&quot;, the band&#x27;s 14th album, was released in April 2013.

In March 2013, Meat Puppets opened for Dave Grohl&#x27;s Sound City Players at the SXSW Festival in Austin, Texas.

In April 2014, Meat Puppets completed a tour with The Moistboyz, and in the summer of 2015, they toured with Soul Asylum. 

The Meat Puppets were picked to open for an 11 show tour as support of The Dean Ween Group in October 2016 after Curt Kirkwood and drummer Chuck Treece contribute to &quot;The Deaner Album&quot;. Also the same year, Cris either produced and/or played with the following artists for Slope Records - The Exterminators, the Linecutters, and Sad Kid.

On August 17, 2017, original drummer Derrick Bostrom posted an update on his website derrickbostrom.net. He performed with Cris, Curt and Elmo Kirkwood at a concert honoring the Meat Puppets. It appears that, while Bostrom enjoyed himself, this was a one-off performance.

On July 8, 2018, it was confirmed that Bostrom had replaced Sahm as the drummer for the band, and that keyboardist Ron Stabinsky had joined, as well.

The band released their 15th studio album, &quot;Dusty Notes&quot;, on March 8, 2019.

==Musical style and legacy==
According to the Chicago Reader, Meat Puppets &quot;were part of a crucial group of hardcore bands bucking the conventions of a genre that had quickly become codified.&quot; Pitchfork described the Meat Puppet&#x27;s style as &quot;warped psychedelic country music&quot;. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described the band&#x27;s sound as &quot;punk rock with a strong affection for &#x27;60s psychedelia and American roots music&quot;, noting that they were one of the first bands on SST Records to &quot;drift away from the fractured but muscular punk-oriented sound that had been SST&#x27;s initial trademark.&quot; He also noted Meat Puppets&#x27; longevity compared to many other bands on the SST Records roster during the mid-1980s, saying the band &quot;[survived] where other bands fell apart.&quot;

Musician Lou Barlow, member of the bands Dinosaur Jr. and Sebadoh, said, &quot;Meat Puppets are the singularly most influential band on both Dinosaur Jr. and Sebadoh. I kick myself for not ever emphasizing this enough.&quot; Dinosaur Jr. frontman J Mascis recalled that listeners construed his band as &quot;a Meat Puppets rip-off at first.&quot; In addition to Dinosaur Jr. and Sebadoh, Meat Puppets have been cited as an influence by numerous commercially successful rock bands, including Nirvana, Soundgarden, Pavement, Jawbreaker, and Sublime.

In 2014, &quot;Phoenix New Times&quot; named the band&#x27;s self-titled debut album one of &quot;The Most Influential Arizona Punk Records&quot;.

Meat Puppets were inducted into the Arizona Music &amp; Entertainment Hall of Fame in 2017.

<text>Michael Polanyi ( ; ; 11 March 1891 – 22 February 1976) was a Hungarian-British polymath, who made important theoretical contributions to physical chemistry, economics, and philosophy. He argued that positivism is a false account of knowing.

His wide-ranging research in physical science included chemical kinetics, x-ray diffraction, and adsorption of gases. He pioneered the theory of fibre diffraction analysis in 1921, and the dislocation theory of plastic deformation of ductile metals and other materials in 1934. He emigrated to Germany, in 1926 becoming a chemistry professor at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin, and then in 1933 to England, becoming first a chemistry professor, and then a social sciences professor at the University of Manchester. Two of his pupils won the Nobel Prize, as well as one of his children. In 1944 Polanyi was elected to the Royal Society.

The contributions which Polanyi made to the social sciences include the concept of a polycentric spontaneous order and his rejection of a value neutral conception of liberty. They were developed in the context of his opposition to central planning.

==Life==
===Early life===
Polanyi, born Mihály Pollacsek in Budapest, was the fifth child of Mihály and Cecília Pollacsek (born as Cecília Wohl), secular Jews from Ungvár (then in Hungary but now in Ukraine) and Wilno, then Russian Empire, respectively. His father&#x27;s family were entrepreneurs, while his mother&#x27;s father, Osher Leyzerovich Vol, was the senior teacher of Jewish history at the Vilna rabbinic seminary. The family moved to Budapest and Magyarized their surname to Polányi. His father built much of the Hungarian railway system, but lost most of his fortune in 1899 when bad weather caused a railway building project to go over budget. He died in 1905. Cecília Polányi established a salon that was well known among Budapest&#x27;s intellectuals, and which continued until her death in 1939. His older brother was Karl Polanyi, the political economist and anthropologist, and his niece was Eva Zeisel, a world-renowned ceramist.

===Education===
In 1908, Polanyi graduated the teacher-training secondary school, the Minta Gymnasium. He then studied medicine at the University of Budapest, obtaining his medical diploma in 1914. He was an active member of the Galileo Circle. With the support of , professor of chemistry at the Royal Joseph University of Budapest, he obtained a scholarship to study chemistry at the Technische Hochschule in Karlsruhe, Germany. In the First World War, he served in the Austro-Hungarian army as a medical officer, and was sent to the Serbian front. While on sick-leave in 1916, he wrote a PhD thesis on adsorption. His research, which was encouraged by Albert Einstein, and supervised by , and in 1919 the Royal University of Pest awarded him a doctorate.

===Career===
In October 1918, Mihály Károlyi established the Hungarian Democratic Republic, and Polanyi became Secretary to the Minister of Health. When the Communists seized power in March 1919, he returned to medicine. When the Hungarian Soviet Republic was overthrown, Polanyi emigrated to Karlsruhe in Germany, and was invited by Fritz Haber to join the Kaiser Wilhelm Institut für Faserstoffchemie (fiber chemistry) in Berlin. A Christian since 1913, in a Roman Catholic ceremony he married Magda Elizabeth Kemeny. In 1926 he became the professorial head of department of the Institut für Physikalische Chemie und Elektrochemie (now the Fritz Haber Institute). In 1929, Magda gave birth to their son John, who was awarded a Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1986. Their other son, George Polanyi, who predeceased him, became a well-known economist.

His experience of runaway inflation and high unemployment in Weimar Germany led Polanyi to become interested in economics. With the coming to power in 1933 of the Nazi party, he accepted a chair in physical chemistry at the University of Manchester. Two of his pupils, Eugene Wigner and Melvin Calvin, went on to win the Nobel Prize. Because of his increasing interest in the social sciences, Manchester University created a new chair in Social Science (1948–58) for him.

Polanyi was among the 2,300 names of prominent persons listed on the Nazis&#x27; Special Search List, of those who were to be arrested on the invasion of Great Britain and turned over to the Gestapo.

From June 1944 to 1947, Polanyi participated in the activities of The Moot, a Christian discussion circle concerned with shaping the post-war society, at the invitation of Karl Mannheim and J. H. Oldham.

In 1944 Polanyi was elected a member of the Royal Society, and on his retirement from the University of Manchester in 1958 he was elected a senior research fellow at Merton College, Oxford. In 1962 he was elected a foreign honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

==Work==
===Physical chemistry===
Polanyi&#x27;s scientific interests were extremely diverse, including work in chemical kinetics, x-ray diffraction, and the adsorption of gases at solid surfaces. He is also well known for the potential theory of adsorption, which was disputed for quite some time. In 1921, he laid the mathematical foundation of fibre diffraction analysis. In 1934, Polanyi, at about the same time as G. I. Taylor and Egon Orowan, realised that the plastic deformation of ductile materials could be explained in terms of the theory of dislocations developed by Vito Volterra in 1905. The insight was critical in developing the field of solid mechanics.

===Freedom and community===
In 1936, as a consequence of an invitation to give lectures for the Ministry of Heavy Industry in the USSR, Polanyi met Bukharin, who told him that in socialist societies all scientific research is directed to accord with the needs of the latest Five Year Plan. Polanyi noted what had happened to the study of genetics in the Soviet Union once the doctrines of Trofim Lysenko had gained the backing of the State. Demands in Britain, for example by the Marxist John Desmond Bernal, for centrally planned scientific research led Polanyi to defend the claim that science requires free debate. Together with John Baker, he founded the influential Society for Freedom in Science.

In a series of articles, re-published in &quot;The Contempt of Freedom&quot; (1940) and &quot;The Logic of Liberty&quot; (1951), Polanyi claimed that co-operation amongst scientists is analogous to the way agents co-ordinate themselves within a free market. Just as consumers in a free market determine the value of products, science is a spontaneous order that arises as a consequence of open debate amongst specialists. Science (contrary to the claims of Bukharin) flourishes when scientists have the liberty to pursue truth as an end in itself:

He derived the phrase spontaneous order from Gestalt psychology, and it was adopted by the classical liberal economist Friederich Hayek, although the concept can be traced back to at least Adam Smith. Polanyi unlike Hayek argued that there are higher and lower forms of spontaneous order, and he asserted that defending scientific inquiry on utilitarian or sceptical grounds undermined the practice of science. He extends this into a general claim about free societies. Polanyi defends a free society not on the negative grounds that we ought to respect &quot;private liberties&quot;, but on the positive grounds that &quot;public liberties&quot; facilitate our pursuit of spiritual ends.

According to Polanyi, a free society that strives to be value-neutral undermines its own justification. But it is not enough for the members of a free society to believe that ideals such as truth, justice, and beauty, are not simply subjective, they also have to accept that they transcend our ability to wholly capture them. The non-subjectivity of values must be combined with acceptance that all knowing is fallible.

In &quot;Full Employment and Free Trade&quot; (1948) Polanyi analyses the way money circulates around an economy, and in a monetarist analysis that, according to Paul Craig Roberts, was thirty years ahead of its time, he argues that a free market economy should not be left to be wholly self-adjusting. A central bank should attempt to moderate economic booms/busts via a strict/loose monetary policy.

In 1940, he produced a film, &quot;Unemployment and money. The principles involved&quot;, perhaps the first film about economics. The film defended a version of Keynesianism, neutral Keynesianism, that advised the State to use budget deficit and tax reductions to increase the amount of money in the circulation in times of economic hardship but did not seek direct investment or engage in public works.

===All knowing is personal===

In his book &quot;Science, Faith and Society&quot; (1946), Polanyi set out his opposition to a positivist account of science, noting that among other things it ignores the role personal commitments play in the practice of science. Polanyi gave the Gifford Lectures in 1951–52 at Aberdeen, and a revised version of his lectures were later published as &quot;Personal Knowledge&quot; (1958). In this book Polanyi claims that all knowledge claims (including those that derive from rules) rely on personal judgments. He denies that a scientific method can yield truth mechanically. All knowing, no matter how formalised, relies upon commitments. Polanyi argued that the assumptions that underlie critical philosophy are not only false, they undermine the commitments that motivate our highest achievements. He advocates a fiduciary post-critical approach, in which we recognise that we believe more than we can know, and know more than we can say.

A knower does not stand apart from the universe, but participates personally within it. Our intellectual skills are driven by passionate commitments that motivate discovery and validation. According to Polanyi, a great scientist not only identifies patterns, but also significant questions likely to lead to a successful resolution. Innovators risk their reputation by committing to a hypothesis. Polanyi cites the example of Copernicus, who declared that the Earth revolves around the Sun. He claims that Copernicus arrived at the Earth&#x27;s true relation to the Sun not as a consequence of following a method, but via &quot;the greater intellectual satisfaction he derived from the celestial panorama as seen from the Sun instead of the Earth.&quot; His writings on the practice of science influenced Thomas Kuhn and Paul Feyerabend.

Polanyi rejected the claim by British Empiricists that experience can be reduced into sense data, but he also rejects the notion that &quot;indwelling&quot; within (sometimes incompatible) interpretative frameworks traps us within them. Our tacit awareness connects us, albeit fallibly, with reality. It supplies us with the context within which our articulations have meaning. Contrary to the views of his colleague and friend Alan Turing, whose work at the Victoria University of Manchester prepared the way for the first modern computer, he denied that minds are reducible to collections of rules. His work influenced the critique by Hubert Dreyfus of &quot;First Generation&quot; artificial intelligence.

It was while writing &quot;Personal Knowledge&quot; that he identified the &quot;structure of tacit knowing&quot;. He viewed it as his most important discovery. He claimed that we experience the world by integrating our subsidiary awareness into a focal awareness. In his later work, for example his Terry Lectures, later published as &quot;The Tacit Dimension&quot; (1966), he distinguishes between the phenomenological, instrumental, semantic, and ontological aspects of tacit knowing, as discussed (but not necessarily identified as such) in his previous writing.

===Critique of reductionism===
In &quot;Life&#x27;s irreducible structure&quot; (1968), Polanyi argues that the information contained in the DNA molecule is not reducible to the laws of physics and chemistry. Although a DNA molecule cannot exist without physical properties, these properties are constrained by higher-level ordering principles. In &quot;Transcendence and Self-transcendence&quot; (1970), Polanyi criticises the mechanistic world view that modern science inherited from Galileo.

Polanyi advocates emergence i.e. the claim that there are several levels of reality and of causality. He relies on the assumption that boundary conditions supply degrees of freedom that, instead of being random, are determined by higher-level realities, whose properties are dependent on but distinct from the lower level from which they emerge. An example of a higher-level reality functioning as a downward causal force is consciousness – intentionality – generating meanings – intensionality.

Mind is a higher-level expression of the capacity of living organisms for discrimination. Our pursuit of self-set ideals such as truth and justice transform our understanding of the world. The reductionistic attempt to reduce higher-level realities into lower-level realities generates what Polanyi calls a moral inversion, in which the higher is rejected with moral passion. Polanyi identifies it as a pathology of the modern mind and traces its origins to a false conception of knowledge; although it is relatively harmless in the formal sciences, that pathology generates nihilism in the humanities. Polanyi considered Marxism an example of moral inversion. The State, on the grounds of an appeal to the logic of history, uses its coercive powers in ways that disregard any appeals to morality.

=== Tacit knowledge ===
Tacit knowledge, as distinct from explicit knowledge, is an influential term developed by Polanyi in &quot;The Tacit Dimension&quot; to describe among other things the ability to do something without necessarily being able to articulate it: for example, being able to ride a bicycle or play a musical instrument without being able to fully explain the details of how it happens. He claims that not only do practical skills rely upon tacit awareness, all perception and meaning is rendered possible by agents relying upon their tacit awareness. Every consciousness has a subsidiary and a focal awareness, and this distinction also has an ontological dimension, because a lower and a higher dimension is how emergence takes place.

<doc id="19712" wikidata="Q14982" url="?curid=19712" title="Methanol">
<text>Methanol (also called methyl alcohol and wood spirit, amongst other names) is an organic chemical compound and the simplest aliphatic alcohol, with the chemical formula (a methyl group linked to a hydroxyl group, often abbreviated as MeOH). It is a light, volatile, colorless and flammable liquid with a distinctive alcoholic odor similar to that of ethanol (potable alcohol), but is more acutely toxic than the latter.
Methanol acquired the name wood alcohol because it was once produced through destructive distillation of wood. Today, methanol is mainly produced industrially by hydrogenation of carbon monoxide. 

Methanol consists of a methyl group linked to a polar hydroxyl group. With more than 20 million tons produced annually, it is used as a precursor to other commodity chemicals, including formaldehyde, acetic acid, methyl &quot;tert&quot;-butyl ether, methyl benzoate, anisole, peroxyacids, as well as a host of more specialized chemicals.

==Occurrence==
Small amounts of methanol are present in normal, healthy human individuals. One study found a mean of 4.5 ppm in the exhaled breath of test subjects. The mean endogenous methanol in humans of 0.45 g/d may be metabolized from pectin found in fruit; one kilogram of apple produces up to 1.4 g of pectin (0.6 g of methanol.)

Methanol is produced by anaerobic bacteria and phytoplankton.

===Interstellar medium===
Methanol is also found in abundant quantities in star-forming regions of space and is used in astronomy as a marker for such regions. It is detected through its spectral emission lines.

In 2006, astronomers using the MERLIN array of radio telescopes at Jodrell Bank Observatory discovered a large cloud of methanol in space across. In 2016, astronomers detected methanol in a planet-forming disc around the young star TW Hydrae using the Atacama Large Millimeter Array radio telescope.

==History==
In their embalming process, the ancient Egyptians used a mixture of substances, including methanol, which they obtained from the pyrolysis of wood. Pure methanol, however, was first isolated in 1661 by Robert Boyle, when he produced it via the distillation of buxus (boxwood). It later became known as &quot;pyroxylic spirit&quot;. In 1834, the French chemists Jean-Baptiste Dumas and Eugene Peligot determined its elemental composition.

They also introduced the word &quot;methylène&quot; to organic chemistry, forming it from Greek &quot;&quot; = &quot;alcoholic liquid&quot; + &quot;&quot; = &quot;forest, wood, timber, material&quot;. &quot;Methylène&quot; designated a &quot;radical&quot; that was about 14% hydrogen by weight and contained one carbon atom. This would be , but at the time carbon was thought to have an atomic weight only six times that of hydrogen, so they gave the formula as CH. They then called wood alcohol (l&#x27;esprit de bois) &quot;bihydrate de méthylène&quot; (bihydrate because they thought the formula was or ). The term &quot;methyl&quot; was derived in about 1840 by back-formation from &quot;methylene&quot;, and was then applied to describe &quot;methyl alcohol&quot;. This was shortened to &quot;methanol&quot; in 1892 by the International Conference on Chemical Nomenclature. The suffix -yl, which, in organic chemistry, forms names of carbon groups, is from the word &quot;methyl&quot;.

French chemist Paul Sabatier presented the first process that could be used to produce methanol synthetically in 1905. This process suggested that carbon dioxide and hydrogen could be reacted to produce methanol. German chemists Alwin Mittasch and Mathias Pier, working for Badische-Anilin &amp; Soda-Fabrik (BASF), developed a means to convert synthesis gas (a mixture of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen) into methanol and received a patent. According to Bozzano and Manenti, BASF&#x27;s process was first utilized in Leuna, Germany in 1923. Operating conditions consisted of &quot;high&quot; temperatures (between 300 and 400 °C) and pressures (between 250 and 350 atm) with a zinc/chromium oxide catalyst.

US patent 1,569,775 was applied for on 4 September 1924 and issued on 12 January 1926 to BASF; the process used a chromium and manganese oxide catalyst with extremely vigorous conditions: pressures ranging from 50 to 220 atm, and temperatures up to 450 °C. Modern methanol production has been made more efficient through use of catalysts (commonly copper) capable of operating at lower pressures. The modern low pressure methanol (LPM) process was developed by ICI in the late 1960s with the technology patent long since expired.

During World War II, methanol was used as a fuel in several German military rocket designs, under the name M-Stoff, and in a roughly 50/50 mixture with hydrazine, known as C-Stoff.

The use of methanol as a motor fuel received attention during the oil crises of the 1970s. By the mid-1990s, over 20,000 methanol flexible fuel vehicles (FFVs) capable of operating on methanol or gasoline were introduced in the US. In addition, low levels of methanol were blended in gasoline fuels sold in Europe during much of the 1980s and early-1990s. Automakers stopped building methanol FFVs by the late-1990s, switching their attention to ethanol-fueled vehicles. While the methanol FFV program was a technical success, rising methanol pricing in the mid- to late-1990s during a period of slumping gasoline pump prices diminished interest in methanol fuels.

In the early 1970s, a process was developed by Mobil for producing gasoline fuel from methanol.

Between the 1960s and 1980s methanol emerged as a precursor to the feedstock chemicals acetic acid and acetic anhydride. These processes include the Monsanto acetic acid synthesis, Cativa process, and Tennessee Eastman acetic anhydride process.

==Applications==

===Production of formaldehyde, acetic acid, methyl &quot;tert&quot;-butyl ether===
Methanol is primarily converted to formaldehyde, which is widely used in many areas, especially polymers. The conversion entails oxidation:
Acetic acid can be produced from methanol.
Methanol and isobutene are combined to give methyl &quot;tert&quot;-butyl ether (MTBE). MTBE is a major octane booster in gasoline.

===Methanol to hydrocarbons, olefins, gasoline===
Condensation of methanol to produce hydrocarbons and even aromatic systems is the basis of several technologies related to gas to liquids. These include methanol-to-hydrocarbons (MtH), methanol to gasoline (MtG), methanol to olefins (MtO), and methanol to propylene (MtP). These conversions are catalyzed by zeolites as heterogeneous catalysts. The MtG process was once commercialized at Motunui in New Zealand.

===Gasoline additive===
The European Fuel Quality Directive allows fuel producers to blend up to 3% methanol, with an equal amount of cosolvent, with gasoline sold in Europe. In 2019, it is estimated that China used as much as 7 million tons of methanol as transportation fuels, representing over 5% of their fuel pool.

===Other chemicals===
Methanol is the precursor to most simple methylamines, methyl halides, and methyl ethers. Methyl esters are produced from methanol, including the transesterification of fats and production of biodiesel via transesterification.

===Niche and potential uses===
====Energy carrier====
Methanol is a promising energy carrier because, as a liquid, it is easier to store than hydrogen and natural gas. Its energy density is, however, lower than methane, per kg. Its combustion energy density is 15.6 MJ/L (LHV), whereas that of ethanol is 24 and gasoline is 33 MJ/L.

Further advantages for methanol is its ready biodegradability and low environmental toxicity. It does not persist in either aerobic (oxygen-present) or anaerobic (oxygen-absent) environments. The half-life for methanol in groundwater is just one to seven days, while many common gasoline components have half-lives in the hundreds of days (such as benzene at 10–730 days). Since methanol is miscible with water and biodegradable, it is unlikely to accumulate in groundwater, surface water, air or soil.

====Fuel====

Methanol is occasionally used to fuel internal combustion engines. It burns forming carbon dioxide and water:
Methanol fuel has been proposed for ground transportation. The chief advantage of a methanol economy is that it could be adapted to gasoline internal combustion engines with minimum modification to the engines and to the infrastructure that delivers and stores liquid fuel. Its energy density, however, is less than gasoline, meaning more frequent fill ups would be required. However, it is equivalent to super high-octane gasoline in horsepower, and most modern computer-controlled fuel injection systems can already use it.

Methanol is an alternative fuel for ships that helps the shipping industry meet increasingly strict emissions regulations. It significantly reduces emissions of sulfur oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter. Methanol can be used with high efficiency in marine diesel engines after minor modifications using a small amount of pilot fuel (dual fuel).

In China, methanol fuels industrial boilers, which are used extensively to generate heat and steam for various industrial applications and residential heating. Its use is displacing coal, which is under pressure from increasingly stringent environmental regulations.

Direct-methanol fuel cells are unique in their low temperature, atmospheric pressure operation, which lets them be greatly miniaturized. This, combined with the relatively easy and safe storage and handling of methanol, may open the possibility of fuel cell-powered consumer electronics, such as laptop computers and mobile phones.

Methanol is also a widely used fuel in camping and boating stoves. Methanol burns well in an unpressurized burner, so alcohol stoves are often very simple, sometimes little more than a cup to hold fuel. This lack of complexity makes them a favorite of hikers who spend extended time in the wilderness. Similarly, the alcohol can be gelled to reduce risk of leaking or spilling, as with the brand &quot;Sterno&quot;.

Methanol is mixed with water and injected into high performance diesel and gasoline engines for an increase of power and a decrease in intake air temperature in a process known as water methanol injection.

====Other applications====
Methanol is used as a denaturant for ethanol, the product being known as &quot;denatured alcohol&quot; or &quot;methylated spirit&quot;. This was commonly used during the US prohibition to discourage consumption of bootlegged liquor, and ended up causing several deaths.

It is sometimes used as a fuel in alcohol lamps, portable fire pits and camping stoves.

Methanol is used as a solvent and as an antifreeze in pipelines and windshield washer fluid. Methanol was used as an automobile coolant antifreeze in the early 1900s. As of May 2018, methanol was banned in the EU for use in windscreen washing or defrosting due to its risk of human consumption as a result of 2012 Czech Republic methanol poisonings.

In some wastewater treatment plants, a small amount of methanol is added to wastewater to provide a carbon food source for the denitrifying bacteria, which convert nitrates to nitrogen gas and reduce the nitrification of sensitive aquifers.

Methanol is used as a destaining agent in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

==Production==

===From synthesis gas===
Carbon monoxide and hydrogen react over a catalyst to produce methanol. Today, the most widely used catalyst is a mixture of copper and zinc oxides, supported on alumina, as first used by ICI in 1966. At 5–10 MPa (50–100 atm) and , the reaction

is characterized by high selectivity (&gt;99.8%). The production of synthesis gas from methane produces three moles of hydrogen for every mole of carbon monoxide, whereas the synthesis consumes only two moles of hydrogen gas per mole of carbon monoxide. One way of dealing with the excess hydrogen is to inject carbon dioxide into the methanol synthesis reactor, where it, too, reacts to form methanol according to the equation

In terms of mechanism, the process occurs via initial conversion of CO into , which is then hydrogenated:

where the byproduct is recycled via the water-gas shift reaction

This gives an overall reaction

which is the same as listed above. In a process closely related to methanol production from synthesis gas, a feed of hydrogen and can be used directly. The main advantage of this process is that captured and hydrogen sourced from electrolysis could be used, removing the dependence on fossil fuels.

===Biosynthesis===
The catalytic conversion of methane to methanol is effected by enzymes including methane monooxygenases. These enzymes are mixed-function oxygenases, i.e. oxygenation is coupled with production of water and :

Both Fe- and Cu-dependent enzymes have been characterized. Intense but largely fruitless efforts have been undertaken to emulate this reactivity. Methanol is more easily oxidized than is the feedstock methane, so the reactions tend not to be selective. Some strategies exist to circumvent this problem. Examples include Shilov systems and Fe- and Cu-containing zeolites. These systems do not necessarily mimic the mechanisms employed by metalloenzymes, but draw some inspiration from them. Active sites can vary substantially from those known in the enzymes. For example, a dinuclear active site is proposed in the sMMO enzyme, whereas a mononuclear iron (alpha-oxygen) is proposed in the Fe-zeolite.

Global emissions of methanol by plants are estimated at between 180 and 250 million tons per year. This is between two and three times larger than man-made industrial production of methanol.

== Green methanol ==
As of 2023, 0.2% of global methanol production is produced in ways that have relatively low greenhouse gas emissions; this is known as &quot;green&quot; methanol. Most green methanol is produced from gasification of biomass. Syngas is produced from biomass gasification and further converted into green methanol.

Another method of producing green methanol involves combining hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and a catalyst under high heat and pressure. To be classified as green methanol, the hydrogen must be green hydrogen, which is produced using renewable electricity. Additionally, the carbon dioxide in this process must be a product of carbon capture and storage or direct air capture or biomass of recent origin. Some definitions of green methanol specify that the carbon dioxide must be captured during the burning of bioenergy.

==Quality specifications and analysis==
Methanol is available commercially in various purity grades. Commercial methanol is generally classified according to ASTM purity grades A and AA. Both grade A and grade AA purity are 99.85% methanol by weight. Grade &quot;AA&quot; methanol contains trace amounts of ethanol as well.

Methanol for chemical use normally corresponds to Grade AA. In addition to water, typical impurities include acetone and ethanol (which are very difficult to separate by distillation). UV-vis spectroscopy is a convenient method for detecting aromatic impurities. Water content can be determined by the Karl-Fischer titration.

==Safety==
Methanol is highly flammable. Its vapours are slightly heavier than air and can travel to a distant ignition source and ignite. Methanol fires should be extinguished with dry chemical, carbon dioxide, water spray or alcohol-resistant foam. Methanol flames are invisible in daylight. 

===Toxicity===
Ingesting as little as of pure methanol can cause permanent blindness by destruction of the optic nerve. is potentially fatal. The median lethal dose is , &quot;i.e.&quot;, 1–2 mL/kg body weight of pure methanol. The reference dose for methanol is 0.5 mg/kg in a day. Toxic effects begin hours after ingestion, and antidotes can often prevent permanent damage. Because of its similarities in both appearance and odor to ethanol (the alcohol in beverages) or isopropyl alcohol, it is difficult to differentiate between the three.

Methanol is toxic by two mechanisms. First, methanol can be fatal due to effects on the central nervous system, acting as a central nervous system depressant in the same manner as ethanol poisoning. Second, in a process of toxication, it is metabolised to formic acid (which is present as the formate ion) via formaldehyde in a process initiated by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase in the liver. Methanol is converted to formaldehyde via alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and formaldehyde is converted to formic acid (formate) via aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). The conversion to formate via ALDH proceeds completely, with no detectable formaldehyde remaining. Formate is toxic because it inhibits mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase, causing hypoxia at the cellular level, and metabolic acidosis, among a variety of other metabolic disturbances.
Outbreaks of methanol poisoning have occurred primarily due to contamination of drinking alcohol. It is also worth noting that ethanol is a natural antidote to methanol poisoning. Contaminated batches of alcohol contained a much higher concentration of methanol than ethanol, which did not provide a sufficient dose of the antidote and caused it to be ineffective. This is more common in the developing world. In 2013 more than 1700 cases nonetheless occurred in the United States. Those affected are often adult men. Outcomes may be good with early treatment. Toxicity to methanol was described as early as 1856.

Because of its toxic properties, methanol is frequently used as a denaturant additive for ethanol manufactured for industrial uses. This addition of methanol exempts industrial ethanol (commonly known as &quot;denatured alcohol&quot; or &quot;methylated spirit&quot;) from liquor excise taxation in the US and other countries.

<text>Milk is a white liquid food produced by the mammary glands of mammals. It is the primary source of nutrition for young mammals (including breastfed human infants) before they are able to digest solid food. Milk contains many nutrients, including calcium and protein, as well as lactose and saturated fat. Immune factors and immune-modulating components in milk contribute to milk immunity. Early-lactation milk, which is called colostrum, contains antibodies and immune-modulating components that strengthen the immune system against many diseases. The US CDC agency recommends that children over the age of 12 months (the minimum age to stop giving breast milk or formula) should have two servings of dairy (milk) products a day, and more than six billion people worldwide consume milk and milk products.

As an agricultural product, dairy milk is collected from farm animals, mostly cattle. In 2011, dairy farms produced around of milk from 260 million dairy cows. India is the world&#x27;s largest producer of milk and the leading exporter of skimmed milk powder. New Zealand, Germany, and the Netherlands are the largest exporters of milk products. Between 750 and 900 million people live in dairy-farming households.

==Etymology and terminology==
The term &quot;milk&quot; comes from &quot;Old English &quot;meoluc&quot; (West Saxon), &quot;milc&quot; (Anglian), from Proto-Germanic *&quot;meluks&quot; &quot;milk&quot; (source also of Old Norse &quot;mjolk&quot;, Old Frisian &quot;melok&quot;, Old Saxon &quot;miluk&quot;, Dutch &quot;melk&quot;, Old High German &quot;miluh&quot;, German &quot;Milch&quot;, Gothic &quot;miluks&quot;)&quot;.

Since 1961, the term &quot;milk&quot; has been defined under Codex Alimentarius standards as &quot;the normal mammary secretion of milking animals obtained from one or more milkings without either addition to it or extraction from it, intended for consumption as liquid milk or for further processing.&quot; The term &quot;dairy&quot; refers to animal milk and animal milk production.

==Types of consumption==
There are two distinct categories of milk consumption: all infant mammals drink milk directly from their mothers&#x27; bodies, and it is their primary source of nutrition; and humans obtain milk from other mammals for consumption by humans of all ages, as one component of a varied diet.

===Nutrition for infant mammals===

In almost all mammals, milk is fed to infants through breastfeeding, either directly or by expressing the milk to be stored and consumed later. The early milk from mammals is called colostrum. Colostrum contains antibodies that provide protection to the newborn baby as well as nutrients and growth factors. The makeup of the colostrum and the period of secretion varies from species to species.

For humans, the World Health Organization recommends exclusive breastfeeding for six months and breastfeeding in addition to other food for up to two years of age or more. In some cultures it is common to breastfeed children for three to five years, and the period may be longer.

Fresh goats&#x27; milk is sometimes substituted for breast milk, which introduces the risk of the child developing electrolyte imbalances, metabolic acidosis, megaloblastic anemia, and a host of allergic reactions.

===Food product for humans===

In many cultures, especially in the West, humans continue to consume milk beyond infancy, using the milk of other mammals (especially cattle, goats and sheep) as a food product. Initially, the ability to digest milk was limited to children as adults did not produce lactase, an enzyme necessary for digesting the lactose in milk. People therefore converted milk to curd, cheese, and other products to reduce the levels of lactose. Thousands of years ago, a chance mutation spread in human populations in northwestern Europe that enabled the production of lactase in adulthood. This mutation allowed milk to be used as a new source of nutrition which could sustain populations when other food sources failed. Milk is processed into a variety of products such as cream, butter, yogurt, kefir, ice cream and cheese. Modern industrial processes use milk to produce casein, whey protein, lactose, condensed milk, powdered milk, and many other food-additives and industrial products.

Whole milk, butter, and cream have high levels of saturated fat. The sugar lactose is found only in milk, and possibly in forsythia flowers and a few tropical shrubs. Lactase, the enzyme needed to digest lactose, reaches its highest levels in the human small intestine immediately after birth, and then begins a slow decline unless milk is consumed regularly. Those groups who continue to tolerate milk have often exercised great creativity in using the milk of domesticated ungulates, not only cattle, but also sheep, goats, yaks, water buffalo, horses, reindeer and camels. India is the largest producer and consumer of cattle milk and buffalo milk in the world.
==History==

Humans first learned to consume the milk of other mammals regularly following the domestication of animals during the Neolithic Revolution or the development of agriculture. This development occurred independently in several global locations from as early as 9000–7000BC in Mesopotamia to 3500–3000BC in the Americas. People first domesticated the most important dairy animals – cattle, sheep and goats – in Southwest Asia, although domestic cattle had been independently derived from wild aurochs populations several times since. Initially animals were kept for meat, and archaeologist Andrew Sherratt has suggested that dairying, along with the exploitation of domestic animals for hair and labor, began much later in a separate secondary products revolution in the fourth millennium BC. Sherratt&#x27;s model is not supported by recent findings, based on the analysis of lipid residue in prehistoric pottery, that shows that dairying was practiced in the early phases of agriculture in Southwest Asia, by at least the seventh millennium BC.

From Southwest Asia domestic dairy animals spread to Europe (beginning around 7000 BC but did not reach Britain and Scandinavia until after 4000 BC), and South Asia (7000–5500 BC). The first farmers in central Europe and Britain milked their animals. Pastoral and pastoral nomadic economies, which rely predominantly or exclusively on domestic animals and their products rather than crop farming, were developed as European farmers moved into the Pontic–Caspian steppe in the fourth millennium BC, and subsequently spread across much of the Eurasian steppe. Sheep and goats were introduced to Africa from Southwest Asia, but African cattle may have been independently domesticated around 7000–6000BC. Camels, domesticated in central Arabia in the fourth millennium BC, have also been used as dairy animals in North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. The earliest Egyptian records of burn treatments describe burn dressings using milk from mothers of male babies. In the rest of the world (i.e., East and Southeast Asia, the Americas and Australia), milk and dairy products were historically not a large part of the diet, either because they remained populated by hunter-gatherers who did not keep animals or the local agricultural economies did not include domesticated dairy species. Milk consumption became common in these regions comparatively recently, as a consequence of European colonialism and political domination over much of the world in the last 500 years.

In the Middle Ages, milk was called the &quot;virtuous white liquor&quot; because alcoholic beverages were safer to consume than the water generally available. Incorrectly thought to be blood diverted from the womb to the breast, it was also known as &quot;white blood&quot;, and treated like blood for religious dietary purposes and in humoral theory.

James Rosier&#x27;s record of the 1605 voyage made by George Weymouth to New England reported that the Wabanaki people Weymouth captured in Maine milked &quot;Rain-Deere and Fallo-Deere.&quot; But Journalist Avery Yale Kamila and food historians said Rosier &quot;misinterpreted the evidence.&quot; Historians report the Wabanaki did not domesticate deer. The tribes of the northern woodlands have historically been making nut milk. Cows were imported to New England in 1624.

===Industrialization===

The growth in urban population, coupled with the expansion of the railway network in the mid-19th century, brought about a revolution in milk production and supply. Individual railway firms began transporting milk from rural areas to London from the 1840s and 1850s. Possibly the first such instance was in 1846, when St Thomas&#x27;s Hospital in Southwark contracted with milk suppliers outside London to ship milk by rail. The Great Western Railway was an early and enthusiastic adopter, and began to transport milk into London from Maidenhead in 1860, despite much criticism. By 1900, the company was transporting over annually. The milk trade grew slowly through the 1860s, but went through a period of extensive, structural change in the 1870s and 1880s.
Urban demand began to grow, as consumer purchasing power increased and milk became regarded as a required daily commodity. Over the last three decades of the 19th century, demand for milk in most parts of the country doubled or, in some cases, tripled. Legislation in 1875 made the adulteration of milk illegal– This combined with a marketing campaign to change the image of milk. The proportion of rural imports by rail as a percentage of total milk consumption in London grew from under 5% in the 1860s to over 96% by the early 20th century. By that point, the supply system for milk was the most highly organized and integrated of any food product. Milk was analyzed for infection with tuberculosis. In 1907 180 samples were tested in Birmingham and 13.3% were found to be infected.

The first glass bottle packaging for milk was used in the 1870s. The first company to do so may have been the New York Dairy Company in 1877. The Express Dairy Company in England began glass bottle production in 1880. In 1884, Hervey Thatcher, an American inventor from New York, invented a glass milk bottle, called &quot;Thatcher&#x27;s Common Sense Milk Jar,&quot; which was sealed with a waxed paper disk. In 1932, plastic-coated paper milk cartons were introduced commercially.

In 1863, French chemist and biologist Louis Pasteur invented pasteurization, a method of killing harmful bacteria in beverages and food products. He developed this method while on summer vacation in Arbois, to remedy the frequent acidity of the local wines. He found out experimentally that it is sufficient to heat a young wine to only about for a brief time to kill the microbes, and that the wine could be nevertheless properly aged without sacrificing the final quality. In honor of Pasteur, the process became known as &quot;pasteurization&quot;. Pasteurization was originally used as a way of preventing wine and beer from souring. Commercial pasteurizing equipment was produced in Germany in the 1880s, and producers adopted the process in Copenhagen and Stockholm by 1885.

==Sources==

All mammal species have females who can produce milk for some time after giving birth. Cow milk dominates the amount of milk produced. In 2011, FAO estimates 85% of all milk worldwide was produced from cows. Human milk is not produced or distributed industrially or commercially; however, human milk banks collect donated human breastmilk and redistribute it to infants who may benefit from human milk for various reasons (premature neonates, babies with allergies, metabolic diseases, etc.) but who cannot breastfeed. Actual inability to produce enough milk is rare, with studies showing that mothers from malnourished regions still produce amounts of milk of similar quality to that of mothers in developed countries. There are many reasons a mother may not produce enough breast milk. The amount of milk produced depends on how often the mother is nursing and/or pumping: the more the mother nurses her baby or pumps, the more milk is produced.

In the Western world, cow&#x27;s milk is produced on an industrial scale and is, by far, the most commonly consumed form of milk. Commercial dairy farming using automated milking equipment produces the vast majority of milk in developed countries. Dairy cattle, such as the Holstein, have been bred selectively for increased milk production. About 90% of the dairy cows in the United States and 85% in Great Britain are Holsteins. Other dairy cows in the United States include Ayrshire, Brown Swiss, Guernsey, Jersey and Milking Shorthorn (Dairy Shorthorn).

===Other animal-based sources===

Aside from cattle, many kinds of livestock provide milk used by humans for dairy products. These animals include water buffalo, goat, sheep, camel, donkey, horse, reindeer and yak. The first four respectively produced about 11%, 2%, 1.4% and 0.2% of all milk worldwide in 2011.

In Russia and Sweden, small moose dairies also exist.

According to the US National Bison Association, American bison (also called American buffalo) are not milked commercially; however, various sources report cows resulting from cross-breeding bison and domestic cattle are good milk producers, and have been used both during the European settlement of North America and during the development of commercial Beefalo in the 1970s and 1980s.

Swine are almost never milked, even though their milk is similar to cow&#x27;s milk and perfectly suitable for human consumption. The main reasons for this are that milking a sow&#x27;s numerous small teats is very cumbersome, and that sows cannot store their milk as cows can. A few pig farms do sell pig cheese as a novelty item; these cheeses are exceedingly expensive.

==Production worldwide==







In 2012, the largest producer of milk and milk products was India, followed by the United States of America, China, Pakistan and Brazil. All 28 European Union members together produced of milk in 2013, the largest by any politico-economic union.

Increasing affluence in developing countries, as well as increased promotion of milk and milk products, has led to a rise in milk consumption in developing countries in recent years. In turn, the opportunities presented by these growing markets have attracted investments by multinational dairy firms. Nevertheless, in many countries production remains on a small scale and presents significant opportunities for diversification of income sources by small farms. Local milk collection centers, where milk is collected and chilled prior to being transferred to urban dairies, are a good example of where farmers have been able to work on a cooperative basis, particularly in countries such as India.

===Production yields===
FAO reports Israel dairy farms are the most productive in the world, with a yield of milk per cow per year. This survey over 2001 and 2007 was conducted by ICAR (International Committee for Animal Recording) across 17 developed countries. The survey found that the average herd size in these developed countries increased from 74 to 99 cows per herd between 2001 and 2007. A dairy farm had an average of 19 cows per herd in Norway, and 337 in New Zealand. Annual milk production in the same period increased from per cow in these developed countries. The lowest average production was in New Zealand at per cow. The milk yield per cow depended on production systems, nutrition of the cows, and only to a minor extent different genetic potential of the animals. What the cow ate made the most impact on the production obtained. New Zealand cows with the lowest yield per year grazed all year, in contrast to Israel with the highest yield where the cows ate in barns with an energy-rich mixed diet.

The milk yield per cow in the United States was per year in 2010. In contrast, the milk yields per cow in India and China– the second and third largest producers– were respectively and per year.
The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report mentions the possibility that the already recorded stagnation of dairy production in both China and West Africa can be attributed to persistent increases in heat stress caused by climate change. This is a plausible hypothesis, because even &quot;mild&quot; heat stress can reduce daily yields: research in Sweden found that average daily temperatures of reduce daily milk yield per cow by 0.2 kg, with the loss reaching 0.54 kg for . Research in a humid tropical climate describes a more linear relationship, with every unit of heat stress reducing yield by 2.13%. In the intensive farming systems, daily milk yield per cow declines by 1.8 kg during severe heat stress. In organic farming systems, the effect of heat stress on milk yields is limited, but milk &quot;quality&quot; suffers substantially, with lower fat and protein content. In China, daily milk production per cow is already lower than the average by between 0.7 and 4 kg in July (the hottest month of the year), and by 2070, it may decline by up to 50% (or 7.2 kg) due to climate change. Heatwaves can also reduce milk yield, with particularly acute impacts if the heatwave lasts for four or more days, as at that point the cow&#x27;s thermoregulation capacity is usually exhausted, and its core body temperature starts to increase.

===Price===
It was reported in 2007 that with increased worldwide prosperity and the competition of bio-fuel production for feed stocks, both the demand for and the price of milk had substantially increased worldwide. Particularly notable was the rapid increase of consumption of milk in China and the rise of the price of milk in the United States above the government subsidized price. In 2010 the Department of Agriculture predicted farmers would receive an average of of cow&#x27;s milk, which is down from 2007 and below the break-even point for many cattle farmers.

== Composition ==

Milk is an emulsion or colloid of butterfat globules within a water-based fluid that contains dissolved carbohydrates and protein aggregates with minerals. Because it is produced as a food source for the young, all of its contents provide benefits for growth. The principal requirements are energy (lipids, lactose, and protein), biosynthesis of non-essential amino acids supplied by proteins (essential amino acids and amino groups), essential fatty acids, vitamins and inorganic elements, and water.

===pH===
The pH of cow&#x27;s milk, ranging from 6.7 to 6.9, is similar to other bovines and non-bovine mammals.

===Lipids===

Full fat milk contains about 33 grams of fat per liter, including about 19 grams of saturated fat, 1.2 grams of omega 6 fatty acids, and 0.75 grams of omega 3 fatty acids per liter. The amount of fat varies for products where (some of) the fat has been removed, such as in skimmed milk.

Initially milk fat is secreted in the form of a fat globule surrounded by a membrane. Each fat globule is composed almost entirely of triacylglycerols and is surrounded by a membrane consisting of complex lipids such as phospholipids, along with proteins. These act as emulsifiers which keep the individual globules from coalescing and protect the contents of these globules from various enzymes in the fluid portion of the milk. Although 97–98% of lipids are triacylglycerols, small amounts of di- and monoacylglycerols, free cholesterol and cholesterol esters, free fatty acids, and phospholipids are also present. Unlike protein and carbohydrates, fat composition in milk varies widely due to genetic, lactational, and nutritional factor difference between different species.

Fat globules vary in size from less than 0.2 to about 15 micrometers in diameter between different species. Diameter may also vary between animals within a species and at different times within a milking of a single animal. In unhomogenized cow&#x27;s milk, the fat globules have an average diameter of two to four micrometers and with homogenization, average around 0.4 micrometers. The fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K along with essential fatty acids such as linoleic and linolenic acid are found within the milk fat portion of the milk.

===Proteins===
Normal bovine milk contains 30–35 grams of protein per liter, of which about 80% is arranged in casein micelles. Total proteins in milk represent 3.2% of its composition (nutrition table).

====Caseins====

The largest structures in the fluid portion of the milk are &quot;casein micelles&quot;: aggregates of several thousand protein molecules with superficial resemblance to a surfactant micelle, bonded with the help of nanometer-scale particles of calcium phosphate. Each casein micelle is roughly spherical and about a tenth of a micrometer across. There are four different types of casein proteins: αs1-, αs2-, β-, and κ-caseins. Most of the casein proteins are bound into the micelles. There are several competing theories regarding the precise structure of the micelles, but they share one important feature: the outermost layer consists of strands of one type of protein, k-casein, reaching out from the body of the micelle into the surrounding fluid. These kappa-casein molecules all have a negative electrical charge and therefore repel each other, keeping the micelles separated under normal conditions and in a stable colloidal suspension in the water-based surrounding fluid.

Milk contains dozens of other types of proteins beside caseins and including enzymes. These other proteins are more water-soluble than caseins and do not form larger structures. Because the proteins remain suspended in whey, remaining when caseins coagulate into curds, they are collectively known as &quot;whey proteins&quot;. Lactoglobulin is the most common whey protein by a large margin. The ratio of caseins to whey proteins varies greatly between species; for example, it is 82:18 in cows and around 32:68 in humans.

===Salts, minerals, and vitamins===
Bovine milk contains a variety of cations and anions traditionally referred to as &quot;minerals&quot; or &quot;milk salts&quot;. Calcium, phosphate, magnesium, sodium, potassium, citrate, and chloride are all included and they typically occur at concentrations of 5–40mM. The milk salts strongly interact with casein, most notably calcium phosphate. It is present in excess and often, much greater excess of solubility of solid calcium phosphate. In addition to calcium, milk is a source of many vitamins: Vitamins A, B1, B2, B5 B6, B7, B12, and D.

====Calcium phosphate structure====
For many years the most widely accepted theory of the structure of a micelle was that it was composed of spherical casein aggregates, called submicelles, that were held together by calcium phosphate linkages. However, there are two recent models of the casein micelle that refute the distinct micellular structures within the micelle.

The first theory, attributed to de Kruif and Holt, proposes that nanoclusters of calcium phosphate and the phosphopeptide fraction of beta-casein are the centerpiece to micellar structure. Specifically in this view unstructured proteins organize around the calcium phosphate, giving rise to their structure, and thus no specific structure is formed.

Under the second theory, proposed by Horne, the growth of calcium phosphate nanoclusters begins the process of micelle formation, but is limited by binding phosphopeptide loop regions of the caseins. Once bound, protein-protein interactions are formed and polymerization occurs, in which K-casein is used as an end cap to form micelles with trapped calcium phosphate nanoclusters.

Some sources indicate that the trapped calcium phosphate is in the form of Ca9(PO4)6;
whereas others say it is similar to the structure of the mineral brushite, CaHPO4·2H2O.

===Sugars and carbohydrates===

Milk contains several different carbohydrates, including lactose, glucose, galactose, and other oligosaccharides. The lactose gives milk its sweet taste and contributes approximately 40% of the calories in whole cow&#x27;s milk&#x27;s. Lactose is a disaccharide composite of two simple sugars, glucose and galactose. Bovine milk averages 4.8% anhydrous lactose, which amounts to about 50% of the total solids of skimmed milk. Levels of lactose are dependent upon the type of milk as other carbohydrates can be present at higher concentrations than lactose in milks.

===Miscellaneous contents===
Other components found in raw cow&#x27;s milk are living white blood cells, mammary gland cells, various bacteria, vitamin C, and a large number of active enzymes.

===Appearance===
Both the fat globules and the smaller casein micelles, which are just large enough to deflect light, contribute to the opaque white color of milk. The fat globules contain some yellow-orange carotene, enough in some breeds (such as Guernsey and Jersey cattle) to impart a golden or &quot;creamy&quot; hue to a glass of milk. The riboflavin in the whey portion of milk has a greenish color, which sometimes can be discerned in skimmed milk or whey products. Fat-free skimmed milk has only the casein micelles to scatter light, and they tend to scatter shorter-wavelength blue light more than they do red, giving skimmed milk a bluish tint.

==Processing==

In most Western countries, centralized dairy facilities process milk and products obtained from milk, such as cream, butter, and cheese. In the US, these dairies usually are local companies, while in the Southern Hemisphere facilities may be run by large multi-national corporations such as Fonterra.

===Pasteurization===
Pasteurization is used to kill harmful pathogenic bacteria such as &quot;M. paratuberculosis&quot; and &quot;E. coli 0157:H7&quot; by heating the milk for a short time and then immediately cooling it. Types of pasteurized milk include full cream, reduced fat, skim milk, calcium enriched, flavored, and UHT. The standard high temperature short time (HTST) process of for 15 seconds completely kills pathogenic bacteria in milk, rendering it safe to drink for up to three weeks if continually refrigerated. Dairies print best before dates on each container, after which stores remove any unsold milk from their shelves.

A side effect of the heating of pasteurization is that some vitamin and mineral content is lost. Soluble calcium and phosphorus decrease by 5%, thiamin and vitamin B12 by 10%, and vitamin C by 20% or greater (even to complete loss). Because losses are small in comparison to the large amount of the two B-vitamins present, milk continues to provide significant amounts of thiamin and vitamin B12. The loss of vitamin C is not nutritionally significant in a well-balanced diet, as milk is not an important dietary source of vitamin C.

====Filtration====
Microfiltration is a process that partially replaces pasteurization and produces milk with fewer microorganisms and longer shelf life without a change in the taste of the milk. In this process, cream is separated from the skimmed milk and is pasteurized in the usual way, but the skimmed milk is forced through ceramic microfilters that trap 99.9% of microorganisms in the milk (as compared to 99.999% killing of microorganisms in standard HTST pasteurization). The skimmed milk then is recombined with the pasteurized cream to reconstitute the original milk composition.

Ultrafiltration uses finer filters than microfiltration, which allow lactose and water to pass through while retaining fats, calcium and protein. As with microfiltration, the fat may be removed before filtration and added back in afterwards. Ultrafiltered milk is used in cheesemaking, since it has reduced volume for a given protein content, and is sold directly to consumers as a higher protein, lower sugar content, and creamier alternative to regular milk.

===Creaming and homogenization===

Upon standing for 12 to 24 hours, fresh milk has a tendency to separate into a high-fat cream layer on top of a larger, low-fat milk layer. The cream often is sold as a separate product with its own uses. Today the separation of the cream from the milk usually is accomplished rapidly in centrifugal cream separators. The fat globules rise to the top of a container of milk because fat is less dense than water.

The smaller the globules, the more other molecular-level forces prevent this from happening. The cream rises in cow&#x27;s milk much more quickly than a simple model would predict: rather than isolated globules, the fat in the milk tends to form into clusters containing about a million globules, held together by a number of minor whey proteins. These clusters rise faster than individual globules can. The fat globules in milk from goats, sheep, and water buffalo do not form clusters as readily and are smaller to begin with, resulting in a slower separation of cream from these milks.

Milk often is homogenized, a treatment that prevents a cream layer from separating out of the milk. The milk is pumped at high pressures through very narrow tubes, breaking up the fat globules through turbulence and cavitation. A greater number of smaller particles possess more total surface area than a smaller number of larger ones, and the original fat globule membranes cannot completely cover them. Casein micelles are attracted to the newly exposed fat surfaces.

Nearly one-third of the micelles in the milk end up participating in this new membrane structure. The casein weighs down the globules and interferes with the clustering that accelerated separation. The exposed fat globules are vulnerable to certain enzymes present in milk, which could break down the fats and produce rancid flavors. To prevent this, the enzymes are inactivated by pasteurizing the milk immediately before or during homogenization.

Homogenized milk tastes blander but feels creamier in the mouth than unhomogenized. It is whiter and more resistant to developing off flavors. Creamline (or cream-top) milk is unhomogenized. It may or may not have been pasteurized. Milk that has undergone high-pressure homogenization, sometimes labeled as &quot;ultra-homogenized&quot;, has a longer shelf life than milk that has undergone ordinary homogenization at lower pressures.

=== UHT ===
Ultra Heat Treatment (UHT) is a type of milk processing where all bacteria are destroyed with high heat to extend its shelf life for up to 6 months, as long as the package is not opened. Milk is firstly homogenized and then is heated to 138 degrees Celsius for 2–4seconds. The milk is immediately cooled down and packed into a sterile container. As a result of this treatment, all the pathogenic bacteria within the milk are destroyed, unlike when the milk is just pasteurized. The treated milk will keep for up to 6 months if unopened. UHT milk does not need to be refrigerated until the package is opened, which makes it easier to ship and store. However, in this process there is a loss of vitamin B1 and vitamin C, and there is also a slight change in the taste of the milk.

==Nutrition and health==
The composition of milk differs widely among species. Factors such as the type of protein; the proportion of protein, fat, and sugar; the levels of various vitamins and minerals; and the size of the butterfat globules, and the strength of the curd are among those that may vary. For example:
* Human milk contains, on average, 1.1% protein, 4.2% fat, 7.0% lactose (a sugar), and supplies 72 kcal of energy per 100 grams.
* Cow&#x27;s milk contains, on average, 3.4% protein, 3.6% fat, and 4.6% lactose, 0.7% minerals and supplies 66 kcal of energy per 100 grams. See also Nutritional value further on in this article and more complete lists at online sources that list values and differences in categories.

Donkey and horse milk have the lowest fat content, while the milk of seals and whales may contain more than 50% fat.

===Cow&#x27;s milk: variation by breed===
These compositions vary by breed, animal, and point in the lactation period.

The protein range for these four breeds is 3.3% to 3.9%, while the lactose range is 4.7% to 4.9%.

Milk fat percentages may be manipulated by dairy farmers&#x27; stock diet formulation strategies. The infection known as mastitis, especially in dairy cattle, can cause fat levels to decline.

===Nutritional value===
Processed cow&#x27;s milk was formulated to contain differing amounts of fat during the 1950s. One cup (250 mL) of 2%-fat cow&#x27;s milk contains 285 mg of calcium, which represents 22% to 29% of the daily recommended intake (DRI) of calcium for an adult. Depending on its age, milk contains 8 grams of protein, and a number of other nutrients (either naturally or through fortification).

Whole milk has a glycemic index of 39±3. A food is considered to have a low GI if it is 55 or less.

For protein quality, whole milk has a Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score (DIAAS) of 1.43, with the limiting amino acid for those groups being methionine and cysteine. A DIAAS of 1 or more is considered to be an excellent/high protein quality source.

===Disease===
There is mixed evidence that drinking milk increases the risk of cancer in general, and good evidence that milk drinking may have a protective effect specifically against bowel cancer.

===Allergy===

One of the most common food allergies in infants is to cow&#x27;s milk. This is an immunologically mediated adverse reaction, rarely fatal, to one or more cow&#x27;s milk proteins. Milk allergy affects between 2% and 3% of babies and young children. To reduce risk, recommendations are that babies should be exclusively breastfed for at least four months, preferably six months, before introducing cow&#x27;s milk. The majority of children outgrow milk allergy, but for about 0.4% the condition persists into adulthood.

===Lactose intolerance===

Lactose intolerance is a condition in which people have symptoms due to deficiency or absence of the enzyme lactase in the small intestine, causing poor absorption of milk lactose. People affected vary in the amount of lactose they can tolerate before symptoms develop, which may include abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, gas, and nausea. Severity depends on the amount of milk consumed. Those affected are usually able to drink at least one cup of milk without developing significant symptoms, with greater amounts tolerated if drunk with a meal or throughout the day.

==Evolution of lactation==

The mammary gland is thought to have derived from apocrine skin glands. It has been suggested that the original function of lactation (milk production) was keeping eggs moist. Much of the argument is based on monotremes (egg-laying mammals). The original adaptive significance of milk secretions may have been nutrition and immunological protection.

Tritylodontid cynodonts seem to have displayed lactation, based on their dental replacement patterns.

==Bovine growth hormone supplementation==
Since November 1993, recombinant bovine somatotropin (rbST), also called rBGH, has been sold to dairy farmers with FDA approval. Cows produce bovine growth hormone naturally, but some producers administer an additional recombinant version of BGH which is produced through genetically engineered E. coli to increase milk production. Bovine growth hormone also stimulates liver production of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1).

=== Human health ===

The US Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health and the World Health Organization have reported that both of these compounds are safe for human consumption at the amounts present.

Milk from cows given rBST may be sold in the United States, and the FDA stated that no significant difference has been shown between milk derived from rBST-treated and that from non-rBST-treated cows.

Milk that advertises that it comes from cows not treated with rBST, is required to state this finding on its label.

=== Animal welfare ===

Cows receiving rBGH supplements may more frequently contract an udder infection known as mastitis. Problems with mastitis have led to Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan banning milk from rBST treated cows. Mastitis, among other diseases, may be responsible for the fact that levels of white blood cells in milk vary naturally.

rBGH is also banned in the European Union, for reasons of animal welfare.

==Varieties and brands== 
Milk products are sold in a number of varieties based on types/degrees of:
* additives (e.g. vitamins, flavorings)
* age (e.g. cheddar, old cheddar)
* coagulation (e.g. cottage cheese)
* farming method (e.g. organic, grass-fed, haymilk)
* fat content (e.g. half and half, 3% fat milk, 2% milk, 1% milk, skim milk)
* fermentation (e.g. buttermilk)
* flavoring (e.g. chocolate and strawberry)
* homogenization (e.g. cream top)
* packaging (e.g. bottle, carton, bag)
* pasteurization (e.g. raw milk, pasteurized milk)
* reduction or elimination of lactose
* species (e.g. cow, goat, sheep)
* sweetening (e.g., chocolate and strawberry milk)
* water content (e.g. dry milk powder, condensed milk, ultrafiltered milk)

Milk preserved by the UHT process does not need to be refrigerated before opening and has a much longer shelf life (six months) than milk in ordinary packaging. It is typically sold unrefrigerated in the UK, US, Europe, Latin America, and Australia.

===Reduction or elimination of lactose===
Lactose-free milk can be produced by passing milk over lactase enzyme bound to an inert carrier. Once the molecule is cleaved, there are no lactose ill effects. Forms are available with reduced amounts of lactose (typically 30% of normal), and alternatively with nearly 0%. The only noticeable difference from regular milk is a slightly sweeter taste due to the cleavage of lactose into glucose and galactose. Lactose-reduced milk can also be produced via ultra filtration, which removes smaller molecules such as lactose and water while leaving calcium and proteins behind. Milk produced via these methods has a lower sugar content than regular milk. To aid digestion in those with lactose intolerance, another alternative is dairy foods, milk and yogurt, with added bacterial cultures such as &quot;Lactobacillus acidophilus&quot; (&quot;acidophilus milk&quot;) and bifidobacteria. Another milk with &quot;Lactococcus lactis&quot; bacteria cultures (&quot;cultured buttermilk&quot;) often is used in cooking to replace the traditional use of naturally soured milk, which has become rare due to the ubiquity of pasteurization, which also kills the naturally occurring Lactococcus bacteria.

===Additives and flavoring===
Commercially sold milk commonly has vitamin D added to it to make up for lack of exposure to UVB radiation. Reduced-fat milks often have added vitamin A palmitate to compensate for the loss of the vitamin during fat removal; in the United States this results in reduced fat milks having a higher vitamin A content than whole milk. Milk often has flavoring added to it for better taste or as a means of improving sales. Chocolate milk has been sold for many years and has been followed more recently by strawberry milk and others. Some nutritionists have criticized flavored milk for adding sugar, usually in the form of high-fructose corn syrup, to the diets of children who are already commonly obese in the US.

===Distribution===

Due to the short shelf life of normal milk, it used to be delivered to households daily in many countries; however, improved refrigeration at home, changing food shopping patterns because of supermarkets, and the higher cost of home delivery mean that daily deliveries by a milkman are no longer available in most countries.

====Australia and New Zealand====
In Australia and New Zealand, prior to metrication, milk was generally distributed in 1 pint (568mL) glass bottles. In Australia and Ireland there was a government funded &quot;free milk for school children&quot; program, and milk was distributed at morning recess in 1/3 pint bottles. With the conversion to metric measures, the milk industry was concerned that the replacement of the pint bottles with 500mL bottles would result in a 13.6% drop in milk consumption; hence, all pint bottles were recalled and replaced by 600mL bottles. With time, due to the steadily increasing cost of collecting, transporting, storing and cleaning glass bottles, they were replaced by cardboard cartons. A number of designs were used, including a tetrahedron which could be close-packed without waste space, and could not be knocked over accidentally (slogan: &quot;No more crying over spilt milk&quot;). However, the industry eventually settled on a design similar to that used in the United States.

Milk is now available in a variety of sizes in paperboard milk cartons (250 mL, 375 mL, 600 mL, 1 liter and 1.5 liters) and plastic bottles (1, 2 and 3 liters). A significant addition to the marketplace has been &quot;long-life&quot; milk (UHT), generally available in 1 and 2 liter rectangular cardboard cartons. In urban and suburban areas where there is sufficient demand, home delivery is still available, though in suburban areas this is often three times per week rather than daily. Another significant and popular addition to the marketplace has been flavored milks; for example, as mentioned above, Farmers Union Iced Coffee outsells Coca-Cola in South Australia.

====India====
In rural India, milk is home delivered, daily, by local milkmen carrying bulk quantities in a metal container, usually on a bicycle. In other parts of metropolitan India, milk is usually bought or delivered in plastic bags or cartons via shops or supermarkets.

The current milk chain flow in India is from milk producer to milk collection agent. Then it is transported to a milk chilling center and bulk transported to the processing plant, then to the sales agent and finally to the consumer.

A 2011 survey by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India found that nearly 70% of samples had not conformed to the standards set for milk. The study found that due to lack of hygiene and sanitation in milk handling and packaging, detergents (used during cleaning operations) were not washed properly and found their way into the milk. About 8% of samples in the survey were found to have detergents, which are hazardous to health.

Although India is the world&#x27;s largest milk producer and a major exporter, the country&#x27;s ever-increasing demand for dairy products could eventually make it a net importer.

====Pakistan====
In Pakistan, milk is supplied in jugs. Milk has been a staple food, especially among the pastoral tribes in this country.

====United Kingdom====

Since the late 1990s, milk-buying patterns have changed drastically in the UK. The classic milkman, who travels his local milk round (route) using a milk float (often battery powered) during the early hours and delivers milk in 1-pint glass bottles with aluminum foil tops directly to households, has almost disappeared. Two of the main reasons for the decline of UK home deliveries by milkmen are household refrigerators (which lessen the need for daily milk deliveries) and private car usage (which has increased supermarket shopping). Another factor is that it is cheaper to purchase milk from a supermarket than from home delivery. In 1996, more than 2.5 billion liters of milk were still being delivered by milkmen, but by 2006 only 637 million liters (13% of milk consumed) was delivered by some 9,500 milkmen. By 2010, the estimated number of milkmen had dropped to 6,000. Assuming that delivery per milkman is the same as it was in 2006, this means milkmen deliveries now only account for 6–7% of all milk consumed by UK households (6.7 billion liters in 2008/2009).

Almost 95% of all milk in the UK is thus sold in shops today, most of it in plastic bottles of various sizes, but some also in milk cartons. Milk is hardly ever sold in glass bottles in UK shops.

====United States====
In the United States, glass milk bottles have been replaced mostly with milk cartons and plastic jugs. Gallons of milk are almost always sold in jugs, while half gallons and quarts may be found in both paper cartons and plastic jugs, and smaller sizes are almost always in cartons.

The &quot;half pint&quot; () milk carton is the traditional unit as a component of school lunches, though some companies have replaced that unit size with a plastic bottle, which is also available at retail in 6- and 12-pack size.

===Packaging===



Glass milk bottles are now rare. Most people purchase milk in bags, plastic bottles, or plastic-coated paper cartons. Ultraviolet (UV) light from fluorescent lighting can alter the flavor of milk, so many companies that once distributed milk in transparent or highly translucent containers are now using thicker materials that block the UV light.
Milk comes in a variety of containers with local variants:
;Argentina
: Commonly sold in 1-liter bags and cardboard boxes. The bag is then placed in a plastic jug and the corner cut off before the milk is poured.
;Australia and New Zealand
: Distributed in a variety of sizes, most commonly in aseptic cartons for up to 1.5 liters, and plastic screw-top bottles beyond that with the following volumes; 1.1 L, 2 L, and 3 L. 1-liter milk bags are starting to appear in supermarkets, but have not yet proved popular. Most UHT-milk is packed in 1 or 2 liter paper containers with a sealed plastic spout.
;Brazil
: Used to be sold in cooled 1-liter bags, just like in South Africa. Today the most common form is 1-liter aseptic cartons containing UHT skimmed, semi-skimmed or whole milk, although the plastic bags are still in use for pasteurized milk. Higher grades of pasteurized milk can be found in cartons or plastic bottles. Sizes other than 1-liter are rare.

;Canada
: 1.33 liter plastic bags (sold as 4 liters in 3 bags) are widely available in some areas (especially the Maritimes, Ontario and Quebec), although the 4 liter plastic jug has supplanted them in western Canada. Other common packaging sizes are 2 liter, 1 liter, 500 mL, and 250 mL cartons, as well as 4 liter, 1 liter, 250 mL aseptic cartons and 500 mL plastic jugs.
;Chile
: Distributed most commonly in aseptic cartons for up to 1 liter, but smaller, snack-sized cartons are also popular. The most common flavors, besides the natural presentation, are chocolate, strawberry and vanilla.
;China
: Sweetened milk is a drink popular with students of all ages and is often sold in small plastic bags complete with straw. Adults not wishing to drink at a banquet often drink milk served from cartons or milk tea.
;Colombia
:Sells milk in 1-liter plastic bags.
;Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro
: UHT milk (&quot;trajno mlijeko/trajno mleko/&quot;трајно млеко) is sold in 500 mL and 1 L (sometimes also 200 mL) aseptic cartons. Non-UHT pasteurized milk (&quot;svježe mlijeko/sveže mleko/&quot;свеже млеко) is most commonly sold in 1 L and 1.5 L PET bottles, though in Serbia one can still find milk in plastic bags.
;Estonia
: Commonly sold in 1 L bags or 0.33 L, 0.5 L, 1 L or 1.5 L cartons.
; Parts of Europe
: Sizes of 500 mL, 1 liter (the most common), 1.5 liters, 2 liters and 3 liters are commonplace.
;Finland
: Commonly sold in 1 L or 1.5 L cartons, in some places also in 2 dl and 5 dl cartons.
;Germany
: Commonly sold in 1-liter cartons. Sale in 1-liter plastic bags (common in the 1980s) is now rare.
;Hong Kong
: Milk is sold in glass bottles (220 mL), cartons (236 mL and 1 L), plastic jugs (2 liters) and aseptic cartons (250 mL).
;India
: Commonly sold in 500 mL plastic bags and in bottles in some parts like in the West. It is still customary to serve the milk boiled, despite pasteurization. Milk is often buffalo milk. Flavored milk is sold in most convenience stores in waxed cardboard containers. Convenience stores also sell many varieties of milk (such as flavored and ultra-pasteurized) in various sizes, usually in aseptic cartons.
;Indonesia
: Usually sold in 1-liter cartons, but smaller, snack-sized cartons are available.
;Italy
: Commonly sold in 1-liter cartons or bottles and less commonly in 0.5 or 0.25-liter cartons. Whole milk, semi-skimmed milk, skimmed, lactose-free, and flavored (usually in small packages) milk is available. Milk is sold fresh or UHT. Goat&#x27;s milk is also available in small amounts. UHT semi-skimmed milk is the most sold, but cafés use almost exclusively fresh whole milk.
;Japan
: Commonly sold in 1-liter waxed paperboard cartons. In most city centers there is also home delivery of milk in glass jugs. As seen in China, sweetened and flavored milk drinks are commonly seen in vending machines.
;Kenya
:Milk in Kenya is mostly sold in plastic-coated aseptic paper cartons supplied in 300 mL, 500 mL or 1 liter volumes. In rural areas, milk is stored in plastic bottles or gourds. The standard unit of measuring milk quantity in Kenya is a liter.
;Pakistan
: Milk is supplied in 500 mL plastic bags and carried in jugs from rural to cities for selling
;Philippines
: Milk is supplied in 1000 mL plastic bottles and delivered from factories to cities for selling.
;Poland
: UHT milk is mostly sold in aseptic cartons (500 mL, 1 L, 2 L), and non-UHT in 1 L plastic bags or plastic bottles. Milk, UHT is commonly boiled, despite being pasteurized.
;South Africa
: Commonly sold in 1-liter bags. The bag is then placed in a plastic jug and the corner cut off before the milk is poured.
;South Korea
: Sold in cartons (180 mL, 200 mL, 500 mL 900 mL, 1 L, 1.8 L, 2.3 L), plastic jugs (1 L and 1.8 L), aseptic cartons (180 mL and 200 mL) and plastic bags (1 L).
;Sweden

: Commonly sold in 0.3 L, 1 L or 1.5 L cartons and sometimes as plastic or glass milk bottles.
;Turkey
: Commonly sold in 500 mL or 1 L cartons or special plastic bottles. UHT milk is more popular. Milkmen also serve in smaller towns and villages.
;United Kingdom
: Most stores stock imperial sizes: 1 pint (568 mL), 2 pints (1.136 L), 4 pints (2.273 L), 6 pints (3.408 L) or a combination including both metric and imperial sizes. Glass milk bottles delivered to the doorstep by the milkman are typically pint-sized and are returned empty by the householder for repeated reuse. Milk is sold at supermarkets in either aseptic cartons or HDPE bottles. Supermarkets have also now begun to introduce milk in bags, to be poured from a proprietary jug and nozzle.

;United States

: Commonly sold in gallon (3.78 L), half-gallon (1.89 L) and quart (0.94 L) containers of natural-colored HDPE resin, or, for sizes less than one gallon, cartons of waxed paperboard. Bottles made of opaque PET are also becoming commonplace for smaller, particularly metric, sizes such as one liter. The US single-serving size is usually the half-pint (about 240 mL). Less frequently, dairies deliver milk directly to consumers, from coolers filled with glass bottles which are typically half-gallon sized and returned for reuse. Some convenience store chains in the United States (such as Kwik Trip in the Midwest) sell milk in half-gallon bags, while another rectangular cube gallon container design used for easy stacking in shipping and displaying is used by warehouse clubs such as Costco and Sam&#x27;s Club, along with some Walmart stores.
;Uruguay
: Pasteurized milk is commonly sold in 1-liter bags and ultra-pasteurized milk is sold in cardboard boxes called Tetra Briks. Non-pasteurized milk is forbidden. Until the 1960s no treatment was applied; milk was sold in bottles. , plastic jugs used for pouring the bags, or &quot;sachets&quot;, are in common use.

Practically everywhere, condensed milk and evaporated milk are distributed in metal cans, 250 and 125 mL paper containers and 100 and 200 mL squeeze tubes, and powdered milk (skim and whole) is distributed in boxes or bags.

===Spoilage and fermented milk products===


When raw milk is left standing for a while, it turns &quot;sour&quot;. This is the result of fermentation, where lactic acid bacteria ferment the lactose in the milk into lactic acid. Prolonged fermentation may render the milk unpleasant to consume. This fermentation process is exploited by the introduction of bacterial cultures (e.g. &quot;Lactobacilli sp., Streptococcus sp., Leuconostoc sp.&quot;, etc.) to produce a variety of fermented milk products. The reduced pH from lactic acid accumulation denatures proteins and causes the milk to undergo a variety of different transformations in appearance and texture, ranging from an aggregate to smooth consistency. Some of these products include sour cream, yogurt, cheese, buttermilk, viili, kefir, and kumis. &quot;See Dairy product&quot; for more information.

Pasteurization of cow&#x27;s milk initially destroys any potential pathogens and increases the shelf life, but eventually results in spoilage that makes it unsuitable for consumption. This causes it to assume an unpleasant odor, and the milk is deemed non-consumable due to unpleasant taste and an increased risk of food poisoning. In raw milk, the presence of lactic acid-producing bacteria, under suitable conditions, ferments the lactose present to lactic acid. The increasing acidity in turn prevents the growth of other organisms, or slows their growth significantly. During pasteurization, however, these lactic acid bacteria are mostly destroyed.

In order to prevent spoilage, milk can be kept refrigerated and stored between in bulk tanks. Most milk is pasteurized by heating briefly and then refrigerated to allow transport from factory farms to local markets. The spoilage of milk can be forestalled by using ultra-high temperature (UHT) treatment. Milk so treated can be stored unrefrigerated for several months until opened but has a characteristic &quot;cooked&quot; taste. Condensed milk, made by removing most of the water, can be stored in cans for many years, unrefrigerated, as can evaporated milk.

=== Powdered milk ===
The most durable form of milk is powdered milk, which is produced from milk by removing almost all water. The moisture content is usually less than 5% in both drum- and spray-dried powdered milk.

Freezing of milk can cause fat globule aggregation upon thawing, resulting in milky layers and butterfat lumps. These can be dispersed again by warming and stirring the milk. It can change the taste by destruction of milk-fat globule membranes, releasing oxidized flavors.

==Use in other food products==

Milk is used to make yogurt, cheese, ice milk, pudding, hot chocolate and french toast, among many other products. Milk is often added to dry breakfast cereal, porridge and granola. Milk is mixed with ice cream and flavored syrups in a blender to make milkshakes. Milk is often served in coffee and tea. Frothy steamed milk is used to prepare espresso-based drinks such as cafe latte.

==In language and culture==
In Greek mythology, the Milky Way was formed after the trickster god Hermes suckled the infant Heracles at the breast of Hera, the queen of the gods, while she was asleep. When Hera awoke, she tore Heracles away from her breast and splattered her breast milk across the heavens. In another version of the story, Athena, the patron goddess of heroes, tricked Hera into suckling Heracles voluntarily, but he bit her nipple so hard that she flung him away, spraying milk everywhere.

In many African and Asian countries, butter is traditionally made from fermented milk rather than cream. It can take several hours of churning to produce workable butter grains from fermented milk.

Holy books have also mentioned milk. The Bible contains references to the &quot;Land of Milk and Honey&quot; as a metaphor for the bounty of the Promised Land. In the Qur&#x27;an, there is a request to wonder on milk as follows: &quot;And surely in the livestock there is a lesson for you, We give you to drink of that which is in their bellies from the midst of digested food and blood, pure milk palatable for the drinkers&quot; (16-The Honeybee, 66). The Ramadan fast is traditionally broken with a glass of milk and dates. In Jewish religious law, Chalav Yisrael is the term regulating consumption of milk.

Abhisheka is conducted by Hindu and Jain priests, by pouring libations on the idol of a deity being worshipped, amidst the chanting of mantras. Usually offerings such as milk, yogurt, ghee, honey may be poured among other offerings depending on the type of abhishekam being performed.

A milksop is an &quot;effeminate spiritless man,&quot; an expression which is attested to in the late 14th century. Milk toast is a dish consisting of milk and toast. Its soft blandness served as inspiration for the name of the timid and ineffectual comic strip character Caspar Milquetoast, drawn by H. T. Webster from 1924 to 1952. Thus, the term &quot;milquetoast&quot; entered the language as the label for a timid, shrinking, apologetic person. Milk toast also appeared in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Follow Me Boys&quot; as an undesirable breakfast for the aging main character Lem Siddons.

To &quot;milk&quot; someone, in the vernacular of many English-speaking countries, is to take advantage of the person, by analogy to the way a farmer &quot;milks&quot; a cow and takes its milk. The word &quot;milk&quot; has had many slang meanings over time. In the 19th century, milk was used to describe a cheap and very poisonous alcoholic drink made from methylated spirits (methanol) mixed with water. The word was also used to mean defraud, to be idle, to intercept telegrams addressed to someone else, and a weakling or &quot;milksop.&quot; In the mid-1930s, the word was used in Australia to refer to siphoning gas from a car.

==Non-culinary uses==
Besides serving as a beverage or source of food, milk has been described as used by farmers and gardeners as an organic fungicide and fertilizer, however, its effectiveness is debated. Diluted milk solutions have been demonstrated to provide an effective method of preventing powdery mildew on grape vines, while showing it is unlikely to harm the plant.

Milk paint is a nontoxic water-based paint. It can be made from milk and lime, generally with pigments added for color. In other recipes, borax is mixed with milk&#x27;s casein protein in order to activate the casein and as a preservative.
Milk has been used for centuries as a hair and skin treatment. 
 Hairstylist Richard Marin states that some women rinse their hair with milk to add a shiny appearance to their hair. Cosmetic chemist Ginger King states that milk can &quot;help exfoliate and remove debris [from skin] and make hair softer. Hairstylist Danny Jelaca states that milk&#x27;s keratin proteins may &quot;add weight to the hair&quot;. Some commercial hair products contain milk.

A milk bath is a bath taken in milk rather than just water. Often additives such as oatmeal, honey, and scents such as rose, daisies and essential oils are mixed in. Milk baths use lactic acid, an alpha hydroxy acid, to dissolve the proteins which hold together dead skin cells.

==Interspecies milk consumption ==

The consumption of milk between species is not unique to humans. Seagulls, sheathbills, skuas, western gulls and feral cats have been reported to directly pilfer milk from the elephant seals&#x27; teats.

<text>Miss Congeniality is a 2000 American action comedy film directed by Donald Petrie, written by Marc Lawrence, Katie Ford, and Caryn Lucas, and produced by and starring Sandra Bullock as Gracie Hart, a tomboy agent who is asked by the FBI to go undercover as a contestant when a terrorist threatens to bomb the Miss United States pageant. Michael Caine, Benjamin Bratt, Candice Bergen, William Shatner, and Ernie Hudson star in supporting roles.

&quot;Miss Congeniality&quot; was released by Warner Bros. Pictures on December 22, 2000 to mixed or average critic reviews and was a box office hit, grossing $212 million worldwide against its $45 million budget, and earned Bullock a nomination for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical. It was followed by the sequel &quot;Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous&quot; in 2005.

==Plot==
In 1982, 10-year-old Gracie Hart breaks up a school fight between two boys, one of whom is a bully and the other, her crush. The boy she likes is humiliated, being saved by a girl, and he rudely rejects her; Gracie punches him and the latter leaves.

18 years later, 28-year-old Gracie is a tough special agent for the FBI. During a sting against Russian mobsters, she ignores protocol to save a mob boss who appears to be choking, causing one of her fellow FBI agents to be shot; Gracie is then demoted to a desk job. Soon, the agency receives news of a bomb threat from notorious domestic terrorist &quot;the Citizen&quot;, alluding to an act of terrorism at the upcoming Miss United States beauty pageant in San Antonio, Texas. Gracie&#x27;s partner, Eric Matthews (Bratt), is put in charge of the mission; he relies on Gracie&#x27;s suggestions, only to take credit for them himself. One of Gracie&#x27;s ideas is to plant an agent undercover at the event and reach the top five contestants so they have access to everything in the pageant. When all possible candidates are deemed unfit, Eric suggests that Gracie take on the role, replacing Miss New Jersey, who was to be disqualified anyway.

Beauty pageant coach Victor Melling teaches Gracie how to dress, walk, and behave like a &quot;lady&quot;. Although she is initially appalled, Gracie comes to appreciate Victor&#x27;s thoroughness. She enters the pageant as &quot;Gracie Lou Freebush&quot;, representing New Jersey, and becomes friends with Cheryl Frasier, Miss Rhode Island. As the competition begins, Gracie impresses the judges during the talent competition with her glass harp skills and self-defense techniques.

Several suspects are identified as being &quot;the Citizen&quot;, including the current competition director and former pageant winner Kathy Morningside, her assistant Frank Tobin, veteran MC Stan Fields, and even Cheryl, who has a history of involvement with a radical animal rights activist group. Gracie convinces Cheryl and the other contestants to go out one night and drink. Gracie uses the chance to try prying into Cheryl&#x27;s past, and learns from the others that Kathy&#x27;s past as a pageant contestant is truly suspicious, including the fact that the year she won, the original winner came down with food poisoning. Gracie deduces Kathy is a &quot;Citizen&quot; copycat. When Gracie reports this to Eric and the team, she learns that &quot;the Citizen&quot; has been arrested on an unrelated charge. As there is no perceived threat, their superior, Harry McDonald, pulls the mission. Gracie insists that she suspects something is off, but Eric and the team leave, unconvinced. While on their way home, Victor informs Eric that Frank is actually Kathy&#x27;s son, a fact they had tried to hide from the FBI because of his criminal record. Eric returns to Texas to help continue the investigation, against FBI orders.

In the final round of the pageant, Gracie is stunned when she is named first runner-up. Cheryl is named Miss United States, but as she goes to accept the tiara, Gracie realizes that Frank impersonated &quot;the Citizen&quot; to make the pageant bomb threat, and that the bomb is in the crown. Gracie fights Cheryl for the crown as Eric wrestles with Frank, who is about to detonate the bomb. Finally, Gracie manages to throw the tiara up at the stage scenery, where it explodes and sets the stage on fire. As Kathy and Frank are arrested, Gracie determines that the two wanted to kill the pageant winner on stage as revenge for Kathy&#x27;s own termination from the pageant organization. Afterwards, Eric asks Gracie out on a date, and they kiss. Soon thereafter, Eric and Victor trick Gracie into attending the pageant&#x27;s farewell breakfast, where Cheryl names Gracie &quot;Miss Congeniality&quot;. Gracie tearfully accepts the honor, finally understanding the true spirit of pageantry.

==Cast==
==Production==

===Development===
Ellen DeGeneres claims that the writer was inspired when watching her training to walk in high heels and a dress in preparation for her role co-hosting the Emmys. Although DeGeneres&#x27;s first time hosting the ceremony on her own was not until November 2001, nearly a year after the film had been released, she did co-host the 46th Primetime Emmy Awards in 1994 alongside Patricia Richardson.

===Casting===
Eight actors read for the part of Eric Matthews, including Hugh Jackman. Matt Dillon came close to getting cast as Eric Matthews, but the part went to Benjamin Bratt.

===Filming===
The story is set in New York City and San Antonio. Scenes showing the exterior of the St. Regis New York, as well as a few street scenes, were shot on location in New York, and Weehawken, New Jersey. The Alamo and River Walk scenes were shot on location in San Antonio. The majority of the film was shot in Austin, Texas: scenes depicting the interior of the St. Regis were shot in Austin&#x27;s Driskill Hotel; the pageant scenes were shot at the Bass Concert Hall at the University of Texas at Austin; and scenes depicting the pageant contestants in their hotel rooms were shot in the Omni Austin at South Park.

== Distribution ==
&quot;Miss Congeniality&quot; was distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures in most countries, and by Roadshow Entertainment in Australia and New Zealand.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film was the fifth highest-grossing film in North America on its opening weekend, making US$13.9 million. It had a 5% increase in earnings the following week—enough to make the film reach #3. Overall, it was a box office hit, grossing more than $106 million in the United States, and more than $212 million worldwide.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 41% based on review from 116 critics. The critical consensus reads: &quot;Though critics say Bullock is funny and charming, she can&#x27;t overcome a bad script that makes the movie feel too much like a fluffy, unoriginal sitcom.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a score of 43 out of 100, based on reviews from 20 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of &quot;A−&quot;.

A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described it as &quot;a standard-issue fish-out-of-water comedy&quot; which &quot;seems happily, deliberately second-rate, as if its ideal audience consisted of weary airline passengers&quot;. Roger Ebert for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; wrote: &quot;It isn&#x27;t bad so much as it lacks any ambition to be more than it so obviously is&quot; although he had some praise for Sandra Bullock&#x27;s performance.
It was nominated for several awards, including two Golden Globes: Sandra Bullock for Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture – Comedy/Musical, and Bosson&#x27;s &quot;One in a Million&quot; for Best Original Song in a Motion Picture.

==Home media==
The film&#x27;s first DVD edition, released in 2001, included two audio commentaries, some deleted scenes, the theatrical trailer, and two documentaries about the making of the film. A deluxe-edition DVD, released in 2005, featured different cover art and contained the same features as the other DVD version plus a quiz hosted by William Shatner and a sneak peek at the upcoming sequel. In 2009, a double feature edition was released that included the sequel.

==Sequel==
A sequel, &quot;Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous&quot;, was released on March 24, 2005. The film starred Sandra Bullock, Regina King, Enrique Murciano, William Shatner, Ernie Hudson, Heather Burns, Diedrich Bader, and Treat Williams. The sequel was less successful both critically and commercially, earning only $101.3 million.

The song &quot;Miss United States&quot; was written by the writer Marc Lawrence&#x27;s son Clyde Lawrence when he was only 6 years old.

<doc id="19716" wikidata="Q3294789" url="?curid=19716" title="Magnetism">
<text>Magnetism is the class of physical attributes that occur through a magnetic field, which allows objects to attract or repel each other. Because both electric currents and magnetic moments of elementary particles give rise to a magnetic field, magnetism is one of two aspects of electromagnetism.

The most familiar effects occur in ferromagnetic materials, which are strongly attracted by magnetic fields and can be magnetized to become permanent magnets, producing magnetic fields themselves. Demagnetizing a magnet is also possible. Only a few substances are ferromagnetic; the most common ones are iron, cobalt, nickel, and their alloys.

All substances exhibit some type of magnetism. Magnetic materials are classified according to their bulk susceptibility. Ferromagnetism is responsible for most of the effects of magnetism encountered in everyday life, but there are actually several types of magnetism. Paramagnetic substances, such as aluminium and oxygen, are weakly attracted to an applied magnetic field; diamagnetic substances, such as copper and carbon, are weakly repelled; while antiferromagnetic materials, such as chromium, have a more complex relationship with a magnetic field. The force of a magnet on paramagnetic, diamagnetic, and antiferromagnetic materials is usually too weak to be felt and can be detected only by laboratory instruments, so in everyday life, these substances are often described as non-magnetic.

The strength of a magnetic field always decreases with distance from the magnetic source, though the exact mathematical relationship between strength and distance varies. Many factors can influence the magnetic field of an object including the magnetic moment of the material, the physical shape of the object, both the magnitude and direction of any electric current present within the object, and the temperature of the object.

== History ==

Magnetism was first discovered in the ancient world when people noticed that lodestones, naturally magnetized pieces of the mineral magnetite, could attract iron. The word &quot;magnet&quot; comes from the Greek term μαγνῆτις λίθος &quot;magnētis lithos&quot;, &quot;the Magnesian stone, lodestone&quot;. In ancient Greece, Aristotle attributed the first of what could be called a scientific discussion of magnetism to the philosopher Thales of Miletus, who lived from about 625 BC to about 545 BC. The ancient Indian medical text &quot;Sushruta Samhita&quot; describes using magnetite to remove arrows embedded in a person&#x27;s body.
In ancient China, the earliest literary reference to magnetism lies in a 4th-century BC book named after its author, &quot;Guiguzi&quot;.
The 2nd-century BC annals, &quot;Lüshi Chunqiu&quot;, also notes:
&quot;The lodestone makes iron approach; some (force) is attracting it.&quot; 
The earliest mention of the attraction of a needle is in a 1st-century work &quot;Lunheng&quot; (&quot;Balanced Inquiries&quot;): &quot;A lodestone attracts a needle.&quot; 
The 11th-century Chinese scientist Shen Kuo was the first person to write—in the &quot;Dream Pool Essays&quot;—of the magnetic needle compass and that it improved the accuracy of navigation by employing the astronomical concept of true north.
By the 12th century, the Chinese were known to use the lodestone compass for navigation. They sculpted a directional spoon from lodestone in such a way that the handle of the spoon always pointed south.

Alexander Neckam, by 1187, was the first in Europe to describe the compass and its use for navigation. In 1269, Peter Peregrinus de Maricourt wrote the &quot;Epistola de magnete&quot;, the first extant treatise describing the properties of magnets. In 1282, the properties of magnets and the dry compasses were discussed by Al-Ashraf Umar II, a Yemeni physicist, astronomer, and geographer.

Leonardo Garzoni&#x27;s only extant work, the &quot;Due trattati sopra la natura, e le qualità della calamita&quot; (&quot;Two treatises on the nature and qualities of the magnet&quot;), is the first known example of a modern treatment of magnetic phenomena. Written in years near 1580 and never published, the treatise had a wide diffusion. In particular, Garzoni is referred to as an expert in magnetism by Niccolò Cabeo, whose Philosophia Magnetica (1629) is just a re-adjustment of Garzoni&#x27;s work. Garzoni&#x27;s treatise was known also to Giovanni Battista Della Porta.

In 1600, William Gilbert published his &quot;De Magnete, Magneticisque Corporibus, et de Magno Magnete Tellure&quot; (&quot;On the Magnet and Magnetic Bodies, and on the Great Magnet the Earth&quot;). In this work he describes many of his experiments with his model earth called the terrella. From his experiments, he concluded that the Earth was itself magnetic and that this was the reason compasses pointed north whereas, previously, some believed that it was the pole star Polaris or a large magnetic island on the north pole that attracted the compass.

An understanding of the relationship between electricity and magnetism began in 1819 with work by Hans Christian Ørsted, a professor at the University of Copenhagen, who discovered, by the accidental twitching of a compass needle near a wire, that an electric current could create a magnetic field. This landmark experiment is known as Ørsted&#x27;s Experiment. Jean-Baptiste Biot and Félix Savart, both of whom in 1820 came up with the Biot–Savart law giving an equation for the magnetic field from a current-carrying wire. Around the same time, André-Marie Ampère carried out numerous systematic experiments and discovered that the magnetic force between two DC current loops of any shape is equal to the sum of the individual forces that each current element of one circuit exerts on each other current element of the other circuit.

In 1831, Michael Faraday discovered that a time-varying magnetic flux induces a voltage through a wire loop. In 1835, Carl Friedrich Gauss hypothesized, based on Ampère&#x27;s force law in its original form, that all forms of magnetism arise as a result of elementary point charges moving relative to each other. Wilhelm Eduard Weber advanced Gauss&#x27;s theory to Weber electrodynamics. 

From around 1861, James Clerk Maxwell synthesized and expanded many of these insights into Maxwell&#x27;s equations, unifying electricity, magnetism, and optics into the field of electromagnetism. However, Gauss&#x27;s interpretation of magnetism is not fully compatible with Maxwell&#x27;s electrodynamics. In 1905, Albert Einstein used Maxwell&#x27;s equations in motivating his theory of special relativity, requiring that the laws held true in all inertial reference frames. Gauss&#x27;s approach of interpreting the magnetic force as a mere effect of relative velocities thus found its way back into electrodynamics to some extent.

Electromagnetism has continued to develop into the 21st century, being incorporated into the more fundamental theories of gauge theory, quantum electrodynamics, electroweak theory, and finally the standard model.

== Sources ==

Magnetism, at its root, arises from three sources:
# Electric current
# Spin magnetic moments of elementary particles
# Changing electric fields 
The magnetic properties of materials are mainly due to the magnetic moments of their atoms&#x27; orbiting electrons. The magnetic moments of the nuclei of atoms are typically thousands of times smaller than the electrons&#x27; magnetic moments, so they are negligible in the context of the magnetization of materials. Nuclear magnetic moments are nevertheless very important in other contexts, particularly in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Ordinarily, the enormous number of electrons in a material are arranged such that their magnetic moments (both orbital and intrinsic) cancel out. This is due, to some extent, to electrons combining into pairs with opposite intrinsic magnetic moments as a result of the Pauli exclusion principle (see &quot;electron configuration&quot;), and combining into filled subshells with zero net orbital motion. In both cases, the electrons preferentially adopt arrangements in which the magnetic moment of each electron is canceled by the opposite moment of another electron. Moreover, even when the electron configuration &quot;is&quot; such that there are unpaired electrons and/or non-filled subshells, it is often the case that the various electrons in the solid will contribute magnetic moments that point in different, random directions so that the material will not be magnetic.

Sometimeseither spontaneously, or owing to an applied external magnetic fieldeach of the electron magnetic moments will be, on average, lined up. A suitable material can then produce a strong net magnetic field.

The magnetic behavior of a material depends on its structure, particularly its electron configuration, for the reasons mentioned above, and also on the temperature. At high temperatures, random thermal motion makes it more difficult for the electrons to maintain alignment.

== Types ==
=== Diamagnetism ===

Diamagnetism appears in all materials and is the tendency of a material to oppose an applied magnetic field, and therefore, to be repelled by a magnetic field. However, in a material with paramagnetic properties (that is, with a tendency to enhance an external magnetic field), the paramagnetic behavior dominates. Thus, despite its universal occurrence, diamagnetic behavior is observed only in a purely diamagnetic material. In a diamagnetic material, there are no unpaired electrons, so the intrinsic electron magnetic moments cannot produce any bulk effect. In these cases, the magnetization arises from the electrons&#x27; orbital motions, which can be understood classically as follows:

This description is meant only as a heuristic; the Bohr–Van Leeuwen theorem shows that diamagnetism is impossible according to classical physics, and that a proper understanding requires a quantum-mechanical description.

All materials undergo this orbital response. However, in paramagnetic and ferromagnetic substances, the diamagnetic effect is overwhelmed by the much stronger effects caused by the unpaired electrons.

=== Paramagnetism ===

In a paramagnetic material there are unpaired electrons; i.e., atomic or molecular orbitals with exactly one electron in them. While paired electrons are required by the Pauli exclusion principle to have their intrinsic (&#x27;spin&#x27;) magnetic moments pointing in opposite directions, causing their magnetic fields to cancel out, an unpaired electron is free to align its magnetic moment in any direction. When an external magnetic field is applied, these magnetic moments will tend to align themselves in the same direction as the applied field, thus reinforcing it.

=== Ferromagnetism ===

A ferromagnet, like a paramagnetic substance, has unpaired electrons. However, in addition to the electrons&#x27; intrinsic magnetic moment&#x27;s tendency to be parallel to an applied field, there is also in these materials a tendency for these magnetic moments to orient parallel to each other to maintain a lowered-energy state. Thus, even in the absence of an applied field, the magnetic moments of the electrons in the material spontaneously line up parallel to one another.

Every ferromagnetic substance has its own individual temperature, called the Curie temperature, or Curie point, above which it loses its ferromagnetic properties. This is because the thermal tendency to disorder overwhelms the energy-lowering due to ferromagnetic order.

Ferromagnetism only occurs in a few substances; common ones are iron, nickel, cobalt, their alloys, and some alloys of rare-earth metals.

==== Magnetic domains ====

The magnetic moments of atoms in a ferromagnetic material cause them to behave something like tiny permanent magnets. They stick together and align themselves into small regions of more or less uniform alignment called magnetic domains or Weiss domains. Magnetic domains can be observed with a magnetic force microscope to reveal magnetic domain boundaries that resemble white lines in the sketch. There are many scientific experiments that can physically show magnetic fields.

When a domain contains too many molecules, it becomes unstable and divides into two domains aligned in opposite directions so that they stick together more stably.

When exposed to a magnetic field, the domain boundaries move, so that the domains aligned with the magnetic field grow and dominate the structure (dotted yellow area), as shown at the left. When the magnetizing field is removed, the domains may not return to an unmagnetized state. This results in the ferromagnetic material&#x27;s being magnetized, forming a permanent magnet.

When magnetized strongly enough that the prevailing domain overruns all others to result in only one single domain, the material is magnetically saturated. When a magnetized ferromagnetic material is heated to the Curie point temperature, the molecules are agitated to the point that the magnetic domains lose the organization, and the magnetic properties they cause cease. When the material is cooled, this domain alignment structure spontaneously returns, in a manner roughly analogous to how a liquid can freeze into a crystalline solid.

=== Antiferromagnetism ===
In an antiferromagnet, unlike a ferromagnet, there is a tendency for the intrinsic magnetic moments of neighboring valence electrons to point in &quot;opposite&quot; directions. When all atoms are arranged in a substance so that each neighbor is anti-parallel, the substance is antiferromagnetic. Antiferromagnets have a zero net magnetic moment because adjacent opposite moment cancels out, meaning that no field is produced by them. Antiferromagnets are less common compared to the other types of behaviors and are mostly observed at low temperatures. In varying temperatures, antiferromagnets can be seen to exhibit diamagnetic and ferromagnetic properties.

In some materials, neighboring electrons prefer to point in opposite directions, but there is no geometrical arrangement in which &quot;each&quot; pair of neighbors is anti-aligned. This is called a canted antiferromagnet or spin ice and is an example of geometrical frustration.

=== Ferrimagnetism ===
Like ferromagnetism, ferrimagnets retain their magnetization in the absence of a field. However, like antiferromagnets, neighboring pairs of electron spins tend to point in opposite directions. These two properties are not contradictory, because in the optimal geometrical arrangement, there is more magnetic moment from the sublattice of electrons that point in one direction, than from the sublattice that points in the opposite direction.

Most ferrites are ferrimagnetic. The first discovered magnetic substance, magnetite, is a ferrite and was originally believed to be a ferromagnet; Louis Néel disproved this, however, after discovering ferrimagnetism.

=== Superparamagnetism ===
When a ferromagnet or ferrimagnet is sufficiently small, it acts like a single magnetic spin that is subject to Brownian motion. Its response to a magnetic field is qualitatively similar to the response of a paramagnet, but much larger.

=== Nagaoka magnetism ===
Japanese physicist Yosuke Nagaoka conceived of a type of magnetism in a square, two-dimensional lattice where every lattice node had one electron. If one electron was removed under specific conditions, the lattice&#x27;s energy would be minimal only when all electrons&#x27; spins were parallel.

A variation on this was achieved experimentally by arranging the atoms in a triangular moiré lattice of molybdenum diselenide and tungsten disulfide monolayers. Applying a weak magnetic field and a voltage led to ferromagnetic behavior when 100–150% more electrons than lattice nodes were present. The extra electrons delocalized and paired with lattice electrons to form doublons. Delocalization was prevented unless the lattice electrons had aligned spins. The doublons thus created localized ferromagnetic regions. The phenomenon took place at 140 millikelvins.

=== Other types of magnetism ===
* Metamagnetism
* Molecule-based magnets
* Single-molecule magnet
* Amorphous magnet

== Electromagnet ==
An electromagnet is a type of magnet in which the magnetic field is produced by an electric current. The magnetic field disappears when the current is turned off. Electromagnets usually consist of a large number of closely spaced turns of wire that create the magnetic field. The wire turns are often wound around a magnetic core made from a ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic material such as iron; the magnetic core concentrates the magnetic flux and makes a more powerful magnet.

The main advantage of an electromagnet over a permanent magnet is that the magnetic field can be quickly changed by controlling the amount of electric current in the winding. However, unlike a permanent magnet that needs no power, an electromagnet requires a continuous supply of current to maintain the magnetic field.

Electromagnets are widely used as components of other electrical devices, such as motors, generators, relays, solenoids, loudspeakers, hard disks, MRI machines, scientific instruments, and magnetic separation equipment. Electromagnets are also employed in industry for picking up and moving heavy iron objects such as scrap iron and steel. Electromagnetism was discovered in 1820.

== Magnetism, electricity, and special relativity ==
As a consequence of Einstein&#x27;s theory of special relativity, electricity and magnetism are fundamentally interlinked. Both magnetism lacking electricity, and electricity without magnetism, are inconsistent with special relativity, due to such effects as length contraction, time dilation, and the fact that the magnetic force is velocity-dependent. However, when both electricity and magnetism are taken into account, the resulting theory (electromagnetism) is fully consistent with special relativity. In particular, a phenomenon that appears purely electric or purely magnetic to one observer may be a mix of both to another, or more generally the relative contributions of electricity and magnetism are dependent on the frame of reference. Thus, special relativity &quot;mixes&quot; electricity and magnetism into a single, inseparable phenomenon called electromagnetism, analogous to how general relativity &quot;mixes&quot; space and time into spacetime.

All observations on electromagnetism apply to what might be considered to be primarily magnetism, e.g. perturbations in the magnetic field are necessarily accompanied by a nonzero electric field, and propagate at the speed of light.

== Magnetic fields in a material ==
In vacuum,

where is the vacuum permeability.

In a material,

The quantity is called &quot;magnetic polarization&quot;.

If the field is small, the response of the magnetization in a diamagnet or paramagnet is approximately linear:

: formula_4

In a hard magnet such as a ferromagnet, is not proportional to the field and is generally nonzero even when is zero (see Remanence).

== Magnetic force ==


The phenomenon of magnetism is &quot;mediated&quot; by the magnetic field. An electric current or magnetic dipole creates a magnetic field, and that field, in turn, imparts magnetic forces on other particles that are in the fields.

Maxwell&#x27;s equations, which simplify to the Biot–Savart law in the case of steady currents, describe the origin and behavior of the fields that govern these forces. Therefore, magnetism is seen whenever electrically charged particles are in motion—for example, from movement of electrons in an electric current, or in certain cases from the orbital motion of electrons around an atom&#x27;s nucleus. They also arise from &quot;intrinsic&quot; magnetic dipoles arising from quantum-mechanical spin.

The same situations that create magnetic fields—charge moving in a current or in an atom, and intrinsic magnetic dipoles—are also the situations in which a magnetic field has an effect, creating a force. Following is the formula for moving charge; for the forces on an intrinsic dipole, see magnetic dipole.

When a charged particle moves through a magnetic field B, it feels a Lorentz force F given by the cross product:
: formula_5
where
: formula_6 is the electric charge of the particle, and
: v is the velocity vector of the particle

Because this is a cross product, the force is perpendicular to both the motion of the particle and the magnetic field. The magnitude of the force is
: formula_7
where formula_8 is the angle between v and B.

One tool for determining the direction of the velocity vector of a moving charge, the magnetic field, and the force exerted is labeling the index finger &quot;V&quot;, the middle finger &quot;B&quot;, and the thumb &quot;F&quot; with your right hand. When making a gun-like configuration, with the middle finger crossing under the index finger, the fingers represent the velocity vector, magnetic field vector, and force vector, respectively. See also right-hand rule.

== Magnetic dipoles ==

A very common source of magnetic field found in nature is a dipole, with a &quot;South pole&quot; and a &quot;North pole&quot;, terms dating back to the use of magnets as compasses, interacting with the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field to indicate North and South on the globe. Since opposite ends of magnets are attracted, the north pole of a magnet is attracted to the south pole of another magnet. The Earth&#x27;s North Magnetic Pole (currently in the Arctic Ocean, north of Canada) is physically a south pole, as it attracts the north pole of a compass.
A magnetic field contains energy, and physical systems move toward configurations with lower energy. When diamagnetic material is placed in a magnetic field, a &quot;magnetic dipole&quot; tends to align itself in opposed polarity to that field, thereby lowering the net field strength. When ferromagnetic material is placed within a magnetic field, the magnetic dipoles align to the applied field, thus expanding the domain walls of the magnetic domains.

=== Magnetic monopoles ===

Since a bar magnet gets its ferromagnetism from electrons distributed evenly throughout the bar, when a bar magnet is cut in half, each of the resulting pieces is a smaller bar magnet. Even though a magnet is said to have a north pole and a south pole, these two poles cannot be separated from each other. A monopole—if such a thing exists—would be a new and fundamentally different kind of magnetic object. It would act as an isolated north pole, not attached to a south pole, or vice versa. Monopoles would carry &quot;magnetic charge&quot; analogous to electric charge. Despite systematic searches since 1931, , they have never been observed, and could very well not exist.

Nevertheless, some theoretical physics models predict the existence of these magnetic monopoles. Paul Dirac observed in 1931 that, because electricity and magnetism show a certain symmetry, just as quantum theory predicts that individual positive or negative electric charges can be observed without the opposing charge, isolated South or North magnetic poles should be observable. Using quantum theory Dirac showed that if magnetic monopoles exist, then one could explain the quantization of electric charge—that is, why the observed elementary particles carry charges that are multiples of the charge of the electron.

Certain grand unified theories predict the existence of monopoles which, unlike elementary particles, are solitons (localized energy packets). The initial results of using these models to estimate the number of monopoles created in the Big Bang contradicted cosmological observations—the monopoles would have been so plentiful and massive that they would have long since halted the expansion of the universe. However, the idea of inflation (for which this problem served as a partial motivation) was successful in solving this problem, creating models in which monopoles existed but were rare enough to be consistent with current observations.

== Units ==

=== SI ===
=== Other ===
* gauss – the centimeter-gram-second (CGS) unit of magnetic field (denoted B).
* oersted – the CGS unit of magnetizing field (denoted H)
* maxwell – the CGS unit for magnetic flux
* gamma – a unit of &quot;magnetic flux density&quot; that was commonly used before the tesla came into use (1.0 gamma = 1.0 nanotesla)
* &quot;μ&quot;0 – common symbol for the permeability of free space ( newton/(ampere-turn)2)

== Living things ==

Some organisms can detect magnetic fields, a phenomenon known as magnetoception. Some materials in living things are ferromagnetic, though it is unclear if the magnetic properties serve a special function or are merely a byproduct of containing iron. For instance, chitons, a type of marine mollusk, produce magnetite to harden their teeth, and even humans produce magnetite in bodily tissue. 

Magnetobiology studies the effects of magnetic fields on living organisms; fields naturally produced by an organism are known as biomagnetism. Many biological organisms are mostly made of water, and because water is diamagnetic, extremely strong magnetic fields can repel these living things.

== Interpretation of magnetism by means of relative velocities ==

In the years after 1820, André-Marie Ampère carried out numerous experiments in which he measured the forces between direct currents. In particular, he also studied the magnetic forces between non-parallel wires. The final result of his work was a force law that is now named after him. In 1835, Carl Friedrich Gauss realized that Ampere&#x27;s force law in its original form can be explained by a generalization of Coulomb&#x27;s law. 

Gauss&#x27;s force law states that the electromagnetic force formula_9 experienced by a point charge, formula_10 with trajectory formula_11, in the vicinity of another point charge, formula_12 with trajectory formula_13, in a vacuum is equal to the central force
: formula_14,
where formula_15 is the distance between the charges and formula_16 is the relative velocity. Wilhelm Eduard Weber confirmed Gauss&#x27;s hypothesis in numerous experiments. By means of Weber electrodynamics it is possible to explain the static and quasi-static effects in the non-relativistic regime of classical electrodynamics without magnetic field and Lorentz force.

Since 1870, Maxwell electrodynamics has been developed, which postulates that electric and magnetic fields exist. In Maxwell&#x27;s electrodynamics, the actual electromagnetic force can be calculated using the Lorentz force, which, like the Weber force, is speed-dependent. However, Maxwell&#x27;s electrodynamics is not fully compatible with the work of Ampère, Gauss and Weber in the quasi-static regime. In particular, Ampère&#x27;s original force law and the Biot-Savart law are only equivalent if the field-generating conductor loop is closed. Maxwell&#x27;s electrodynamics therefore represents a break with the interpretation of magnetism by Gauss and Weber, since in Maxwell&#x27;s electrodynamics it is no longer possible to deduce the magnetic force from a central force.

== Quantum-mechanical origin of magnetism ==
While heuristic explanations based on classical physics can be formulated, diamagnetism, paramagnetism and ferromagnetism can be fully explained only using quantum theory.
A successful model was developed already in 1927, by Walter Heitler and Fritz London, who derived, quantum-mechanically, how hydrogen molecules are formed from hydrogen atoms, i.e. from the atomic hydrogen orbitals formula_17 and formula_18 centered at the nuclei &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, see below. That this leads to magnetism is not at all obvious, but will be explained in the following.

According to the Heitler–London theory, so-called two-body molecular formula_19-orbitals are formed, namely the resulting orbital is:
: formula_20

Here the last product means that a first electron, r1, is in an atomic hydrogen-orbital centered at the second nucleus, whereas the second electron runs around the first nucleus. This &quot;exchange&quot; phenomenon is an expression for the quantum-mechanical property that particles with identical properties cannot be distinguished. It is specific not only for the formation of chemical bonds, but also for magnetism. That is, in this connection the term exchange interaction arises, a term which is essential for the origin of magnetism, and which is stronger, roughly by factors 100 and even by 1000, than the energies arising from the electrodynamic dipole-dipole interaction.

As for the &quot;spin function&quot; formula_21, which is responsible for the magnetism, we have the already mentioned Pauli&#x27;s principle, namely that a symmetric orbital (i.e. with the + sign as above) must be multiplied with an antisymmetric spin function (i.e. with a − sign), and &quot;vice versa&quot;. Thus:
: formula_22,

I.e., not only formula_23 and formula_18 must be substituted by &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot;, respectively (the first entity means &quot;spin up&quot;, the second one &quot;spin down&quot;), but also the sign + by the − sign, and finally ri by the discrete values &quot;s&quot;i (= ±); thereby we have formula_25 and formula_26. The &quot;singlet state&quot;, i.e. the − sign, means: the spins are &quot;antiparallel&quot;, i.e. for the solid we have antiferromagnetism, and for two-atomic molecules one has diamagnetism. The tendency to form a (homoeopolar) chemical bond (this means: the formation of a &quot;symmetric&quot; molecular orbital, i.e. with the + sign) results through the Pauli principle automatically in an &quot;antisymmetric&quot; spin state (i.e. with the − sign). In contrast, the Coulomb repulsion of the electrons, i.e. the tendency that they try to avoid each other by this repulsion, would lead to an &quot;antisymmetric&quot; orbital function (i.e. with the − sign) of these two particles, and complementary to a &quot;symmetric&quot; spin function (i.e. with the + sign, one of the so-called &quot;triplet functions&quot;). Thus, now the spins would be &quot;parallel&quot; (ferromagnetism in a solid, paramagnetism in two-atomic gases).

The last-mentioned tendency dominates in the metals iron, cobalt and nickel, and in some rare earths, which are &quot;ferromagnetic&quot;. Most of the other metals, where the first-mentioned tendency dominates, are &quot;nonmagnetic&quot; (e.g. sodium, aluminium, and magnesium) or &quot;antiferromagnetic&quot; (e.g. manganese). Diatomic gases are also almost exclusively diamagnetic, and not paramagnetic. However, the oxygen molecule, because of the involvement of π-orbitals, is an exception important for the life-sciences.

The Heitler-London considerations can be generalized to the Heisenberg model of magnetism (Heisenberg 1928).

The explanation of the phenomena is thus essentially based on all subtleties of quantum mechanics, whereas the electrodynamics covers mainly the phenomenology.

<text>In mathematics, a filter or order filter is a special subset of a partially ordered set (poset), describing &quot;large&quot; or &quot;eventual&quot; elements. Filters appear in order and lattice theory, but also topology, whence they originate. The notion dual to a filter is an order ideal.

Special cases of filters include ultrafilters, which are filters that cannot be enlarged, and describe nonconstructive techniques in mathematical logic.

Filters on sets were introduced by Henri Cartan in 1937. Nicolas Bourbaki, in their book &quot;Topologie Générale&quot;, popularized filters as an alternative to E. H. Moore and Herman L. Smith&#x27;s 1922 notion of a net; order filters generalize this notion from the specific case of a power set under inclusion to arbitrary partially ordered sets. Nevertheless, the theory of power-set filters retains interest in its own right, in part for substantial applications in topology.

==Motivation==

Fix a partially ordered set (poset) . Intuitively, a filter  is a subset of whose members are elements large enough to satisfy some criterion. For instance, if , then the set of elements above is a filter, called the principal filter at . (If and are incomparable elements of , then neither the principal filter at nor is contained in the other.)

Similarly, a filter on a set  contains those subsets that are sufficiently large to contain some given . For example, if is the real line and , then the family of sets including in their interior is a filter, called the neighborhood filter at . The in this case is slightly larger than , but it still does not contain any other specific point of the line.

The above considerations motivate the upward closure requirement in the definition below: &quot;large enough&quot; objects can always be made larger.

To understand the other two conditions, reverse the roles and instead consider as a &quot;locating scheme&quot; to find . In this interpretation, one searches in some space , and expects to describe those subsets of that contain the goal. The goal must be located somewhere; thus the empty set  can never be in . And if two subsets both contain the goal, then should &quot;zoom in&quot; to their common region.

An ultrafilter describes a &quot;perfect locating scheme&quot; where each scheme component gives new information (either &quot;look here&quot; or &quot;look elsewhere&quot;). Compactness is the property that &quot;every search is fruitful,&quot; or, to put it another way, &quot;every locating scheme ends in a search result.&quot;

A common use for a filter is to define properties that are satisfied by &quot;generic&quot; elements of some topological space. This application generalizes the &quot;locating scheme&quot; to find points that might be hard to write down explicitly.

==Definition==

A subset  of a partially ordered set  is a filter or dual ideal if the following are satisfied:

; Nontriviality: The set is non-empty.
; Downward directed: For every , there is some such that and . 
; Upward closure: For every and , the condition implies . 
If, additionally, , then is said to be a proper filter. Authors in set theory and mathematical logic often require all filters to be proper; this article will &quot;eschew&quot; that convention. An ultrafilter is a filter contained in no other proper filter.

=== Filter bases ===

A subset  of is a base or basis for if the upper set generated by (i.e., the smallest upwards-closed set containing ) is equal to . Since every filter is upwards-closed, every filter is a base for itself.

Moreover, if is nonempty and downward directed, then generates an upper set  that is a filter (for which is a base). Such sets are called prefilters, as well as the aforementioned filter base/basis, and is said to be generated or spanned by . A prefilter is proper if and only if it generates a proper filter.

Given , the set is the smallest filter containing , and sometimes written . Such a filter is called a principal filter; is said to be the principal element of , or generate .

==== Refinement ====
Suppose and are two prefilters on , and, for each , there is a , such that . Then we say that is than (or refines) ; likewise, is coarser than (or coarsens) . Refinement is a preorder on the set of prefilters. In fact, if also refines , then and are called equivalent, for they generate the same filter. Thus passage from prefilter to filter is an instance of passing from a preordering to associated partial ordering.

== Special cases ==
Historically, filters generalized to order-theoretic lattices before arbitrary partial orders. In the case of lattices, downward direction can be written as closure under finite meets: for all , one has .

=== Linear filters ===
A linear (ultra)filter is an (ultra)filter on the lattice of vector subspaces of a given vector space, ordered by inclusion. Explicitly, a linear filter on a vector space  is a family  of vector subspaces of such that if and is a vector subspace of that contains , then and .

A linear filter is proper if it does not contain .

=== Filters on a set; subbases ===
Given a set , the power set  is partially ordered by set inclusion; filters on this poset are often just called &quot;filters on ,&quot; in an abuse of terminology. For such posets, downward direction and upward closure reduce to:
; Closure under finite intersections: If , then so too is . 
; Isotony: If and , then .

A proper/non-degenerate filter is one that does not contain , and these three conditions (including non-degeneracy) are Henri Cartan&#x27;s original definition of a filter. It is common — &quot;though not universal&quot; — to require filters on sets to be proper (whatever one&#x27;s stance on poset filters); we shall again eschew this convention.

Prefilters on a set are proper if and only if they do not contain either.

For every subset  of , there is a smallest filter  containing . As with prefilters, is said to generate or span ; a base for is the set  of all finite intersections of . The set is said to be a filter subbase when (and thus ) is proper.

Proper filters on sets have the finite intersection property.

If , then admits only the improper filter .

==== Free filters ====
A filter is said to be a free if the intersection of its members is empty. A proper principal filter is not free.

Since the intersection of any finite number of members of a filter is also a member, no proper filter on a finite set is free, and indeed is the principal filter generated by the common intersection of all of its members. But a nonprincipal filter on an infinite set is not necessarily free: a filter is free if and only if it includes the Fréchet filter (see ).

== Examples ==
See the image at the top of this article for a simple example of filters on the finite poset .

Partially order , the space of real-valued functions on , by pointwise comparison. Then the set of functions &quot;large at infinity,&quot;formula_1is a filter on . One can generalize this construction quite far by compactifying the domain and completing the codomain: if is a set with distinguished subset  and is a poset with distinguished element , then is a filter in .

The set is a filter in . More generally, if is any directed set, thenformula_2is a filter in , called the tail filter. Likewise any net  generates the eventuality filter . A tail filter is the eventuality filter for .

The Fréchet filter on an infinite set  isformula_3If is a measure space, then the collection is a filter. If , then is also a filter; the Fréchet filter is the case where is counting measure.

Given an ordinal , a subset of is called a club if it is closed in the order topology of but has net-theoretic limit . The clubs of form a filter: the club filter, .

The previous construction generalizes as follows: any club  is also a collection of dense subsets (in the ordinal topology) of , and meets each element of . Replacing with an arbitrary collection  of dense sets, there &quot;typically&quot; exists a filter meeting each element of , called a generic filter. For countable , the Rasiowa–Sikorski lemma implies that such a filter must exist; for &quot;small&quot; uncountable , the existence of such a filter can be forced through Martin&#x27;s axiom.

Let denote the set of partial orders of limited cardinality, modulo isomorphism. Partially order by: 
: if there exists a strictly increasing . 
Then the subset of non-atomic partial orders forms a filter. Likewise, if is the set of injective modules over some given commutative ring, of limited cardinality, modulo isomorphism, then a partial order on is: 
: if there exists an injective linear map . 
Given any infinite cardinal , the modules in that cannot be generated by fewer than elements form a filter.

Every uniform structure on a set  is a filter on .

== Relationship to ideals ==

The dual notion to a filter — that is, the concept obtained by reversing all and exchanging with  — is an order ideal. Because of this duality, any question of filters can be mechanically translated to a question about ideals and vice versa; in particular, a prime or maximal filter is a filter whose corresponding ideal is (respectively) prime or maximal.

A filter is an ultrafilter if and only if the corresponding ideal is minimal.

==In model theory==

For every filter  on a set , the set function defined byformula_4is finitely additive — a &quot;measure,&quot; if that term is construed rather loosely. Moreover, the measures so constructed are defined everywhere if is an ultrafilter. Therefore, the statementformula_5can be considered somewhat analogous to the statement that holds &quot;almost everywhere.&quot; That interpretation of membership in a filter is used (for motivation, not actual ) in the theory of ultraproducts in model theory, a branch of mathematical logic.

==In topology==

In general topology and analysis, filters are used to define convergence in a manner similar to the role of sequences in a metric space. They unify the concept of a limit across the wide variety of arbitrary topological spaces.

To understand the need for filters, begin with the equivalent concept of a net. A sequence is usually indexed by the natural numbers , which are a totally ordered set. Nets generalize the notion of a sequence by replacing with an arbitrary directed set. In certain categories of topological spaces, such as first-countable spaces, sequences characterize most topological properties, but this is not true in general. However, nets — as well as filters — always do characterize those topological properties.

Filters do not involve any set external to the topological space , whereas sequences and nets rely on other directed sets. For this reason, the collection of all filters on is always a set, whereas the collection of all -valued nets is a proper class.

=== Neighborhood bases ===
Any point  in the topological space  defines a neighborhood filter or system : namely, the family of all sets containing in their interior. A set  of neighborhoods of is a neighborhood base at if generates . Equivalently, is a neighborhood of if and only if there exists such that .

==== Convergent filters and cluster points ====
A prefilter  converges to a point , written , if and only if generates a filter  that contains the neighborhood filter  — explicitly, for every neighborhood  of , there is some such that . Less explicitly, if and only if refines , and any neighborhood base at can replace in this condition. Clearly, every neighborhood base at converges to .

A filter  (which generates itself) converges to if . The above can also be reversed to characterize the neighborhood filter : is the finest filter coarser than each filter converging to .

If , then is called a limit (point) of . The prefilter is said to cluster at (or have as a cluster point) if and only if each element of has non-empty intersection with each neighborhood of . Every limit point is a cluster point but the converse is not true in general. However, every cluster point of an filter is a limit point.

<text>Metallurgy is a domain of materials science and engineering that studies the physical and chemical behavior of metallic elements, their inter-metallic compounds, and their mixtures, which are known as alloys.

Metallurgy encompasses both the science and the technology of metals, including the production of metals and the engineering of metal components used in products for both consumers and manufacturers. Metallurgy is distinct from the craft of metalworking. Metalworking relies on metallurgy in a similar manner to how medicine relies on medical science for technical advancement. A specialist practitioner of metallurgy is known as a metallurgist.

The science of metallurgy is further subdivided into two broad categories: chemical metallurgy and physical metallurgy. Chemical metallurgy is chiefly concerned with the reduction and oxidation of metals, and the chemical performance of metals. Subjects of study in chemical metallurgy include mineral processing, the extraction of metals, thermodynamics, electrochemistry, and chemical degradation (corrosion). In contrast, physical metallurgy focuses on the mechanical properties of metals, the physical properties of metals, and the physical performance of metals. Topics studied in physical metallurgy include crystallography, material characterization, mechanical metallurgy, phase transformations, and failure mechanisms.

Historically, metallurgy has predominately focused on the production of metals. Metal production begins with the processing of ores to extract the metal, and includes the mixture of metals to make alloys. Metal alloys are often a blend of at least two different metallic elements. However, non-metallic elements are often added to alloys in order to achieve properties suitable for an application. The study of metal production is subdivided into ferrous metallurgy (also known as &quot;black metallurgy&quot;) and non-ferrous metallurgy, also known as colored metallurgy.

Ferrous metallurgy involves processes and alloys based on iron, while non-ferrous metallurgy involves processes and alloys based on other metals. The production of ferrous metals accounts for 95% of world metal production.

Modern metallurgists work in both emerging and traditional areas as part of an interdisciplinary team alongside material scientists and other engineers. Some traditional areas include mineral processing, metal production, heat treatment, failure analysis, and the joining of metals (including welding, brazing, and soldering). Emerging areas for metallurgists include nanotechnology, superconductors, composites, biomedical materials, electronic materials (semiconductors) and surface engineering.

&quot;Metallurgy&quot; derives from the Ancient Greek , , &quot;worker in metal&quot;, from , , &quot;mine, metal&quot; + , , &quot;work&quot; The word was originally an alchemist&#x27;s term for the extraction of metals from minerals, the ending &quot;-urgy&quot; signifying a process, especially manufacturing: it was discussed in this sense in the 1797 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;.

In the late 19th century, metallurgy&#x27;s definition was extended to the more general scientific study of metals, alloys, and related processes. In English, the pronunciation is the more common one in the United Kingdom. The pronunciation is the more common one in the US and is the first-listed variant in various American dictionaries, including &quot;Merriam-Webster Collegiate&quot; and &quot;American Heritage&quot;.

==History==

The earliest metal employed by humans appears to be gold, which can be found &quot;native&quot;. Small amounts of natural gold, dating to the late Paleolithic period, 40,000 BC, have been found in Spanish caves. Silver, copper, tin and meteoric iron can also be found in native form, allowing a limited amount of metalworking in early cultures. Early cold metallurgy, using native copper not melted from mineral has been documented at sites in Anatolia and at the site of Tell Maghzaliyah in Iraq, dating from the 7th/6th millennia BC.

The earliest archaeological support of smelting (hot metallurgy) in Eurasia is found in the Balkans and Carpathian Mountains, as evidenced by findings of objects made by metal casting and smelting dated to around 6200–5000 BC, with the invention of copper metallurgy. Certain metals, such as tin, lead, and copper can be recovered from their ores by simply heating the rocks in a fire or blast furnace in a process known as smelting. The first evidence of copper smelting, dating from the 6th millennium BC, has been found at archaeological sites in Majdanpek, Jarmovac and Pločnik, in present-day Serbia. The site of Pločnik has produced a smelted copper axe dating from 5,500 BC, belonging to the Vinča culture. The Balkans and adjacent Carpathian region were the location of major Chalcolithic cultures including Vinča, Varna, Karanovo, Gumelnița and Hamangia, which are often grouped together under the name of &#x27;Old Europe&#x27;. With the Carpatho-Balkan region described as the &#x27;earliest metallurgical province in Eurasia&#x27;, its scale and technical quality of metal production in the 6th–5th millennia BC totally overshadowed that of any other contemporary production centre.

The earliest documented use of lead (possibly native or smelted) in the Near East dates from the 6th millennium BC, is from the late Neolithic settlements of Yarim Tepe and Arpachiyah in Iraq. The artifacts suggest that lead smelting may have predated copper smelting. Metallurgy of lead has also been found in the Balkans during the same period.

Copper smelting is documented at sites in Anatolia and at the site of Tal-i Iblis in southeastern Iran from .

Copper smelting is first documented in the Delta region of northern Egypt in , associated with the Maadi culture. This represents the earliest evidence for smelting in Africa.

The Varna Necropolis, Bulgaria, is a burial site located in the western industrial zone of Varna, approximately 4 km from the city centre, internationally considered one of the key archaeological sites in world prehistory. The oldest gold treasure in the world, dating from 4,600 BC to 4,200 BC, was discovered at the site. The gold piece dating from 4,500 BC, found in 2019 in Durankulak, near Varna is another important example. Other signs of early metals are found from the third millennium BC in Palmela, Portugal, Los Millares, Spain, and Stonehenge, United Kingdom. The precise beginnings, however, have not be clearly ascertained and new discoveries are both continuous and ongoing.

In approximately 1900 BC, ancient iron smelting sites existed in Tamil Nadu.

In the Near East, about 3,500 BC, it was discovered that by combining copper and tin, a superior metal could be made, an alloy called bronze. This represented a major technological shift known as the Bronze Age.

The extraction of iron from its ore into a workable metal is much more difficult than for copper or tin. The process appears to have been invented by the Hittites in about 1200 BC, beginning the Iron Age. The secret of extracting and working iron was a key factor in the success of the Philistines.

Historical developments in ferrous metallurgy can be found in a wide variety of past cultures and civilizations. This includes the ancient and medieval kingdoms and empires of the Middle East and Near East, ancient Iran, ancient Egypt, ancient Nubia, and Anatolia in present-day Turkey, Ancient Nok, Carthage, the Celts, Greeks and Romans of ancient Europe, medieval Europe, ancient and medieval China, ancient and medieval India, ancient and medieval Japan, amongst others.

A 16th century book by Georg Agricola, &quot;De re metallica&quot;, describes the highly developed and complex processes of mining metal ores, metal extraction, and metallurgy of the time. Agricola has been described as the &quot;father of metallurgy&quot;.

==Extraction==
Extractive metallurgy is the practice of removing valuable metals from an ore and refining the extracted raw metals into a purer form. In order to convert a metal oxide or sulphide to a purer metal, the ore must be reduced physically, chemically, or electrolytically. Extractive metallurgists are interested in three primary streams: feed, concentrate (metal oxide/sulphide) and tailings (waste).

After mining, large pieces of the ore feed are broken through crushing or grinding in order to obtain particles small enough, where each particle is either mostly valuable or mostly waste. Concentrating the particles of value in a form supporting separation enables the desired metal to be removed from waste products.

Mining may not be necessary, if the ore body and physical environment are conducive to leaching. Leaching dissolves minerals in an ore body and results in an enriched solution. The solution is collected and processed to extract valuable metals. Ore bodies often contain more than one valuable metal.

Tailings of a previous process may be used as a feed in another process to extract a secondary product from the original ore. Additionally, a concentrate may contain more than one valuable metal. That concentrate would then be processed to separate the valuable metals into individual constituents.

==Metal and its alloys==
Much effort has been placed on understanding iron–carbon alloy system, which includes steels and cast irons. Plain carbon steels (those that contain essentially only carbon as an alloying element) are used in low-cost, high-strength applications, where neither weight nor corrosion are a major concern. Cast irons, including ductile iron, are also part of the iron-carbon system. Iron-Manganese-Chromium alloys (Hadfield-type steels) are also used in non-magnetic applications such as directional drilling.

Other engineering metals include aluminium, chromium, copper, magnesium, nickel, titanium, zinc, and silicon. These metals are most often used as alloys with the noted exception of silicon, which is not a metal. Other forms include:

* Stainless steel, particularly Austenitic stainless steels, galvanized steel, nickel alloys, titanium alloys, or occasionally copper alloys are used, where resistance to corrosion is important.
* Aluminium alloys and magnesium alloys are commonly used, when a lightweight strong part is required such as in automotive and aerospace applications.
* Copper-nickel alloys (such as Monel) are used in highly corrosive environments and for non-magnetic applications.
* Nickel-based superalloys like Inconel are used in high-temperature applications such as gas turbines, turbochargers, pressure vessels, and heat exchangers.
* For extremely high temperatures, single crystal alloys are used to minimize creep. In modern electronics, high purity single crystal silicon is essential for metal-oxide-silicon transistors (MOS) and integrated circuits.

==Production==
In production engineering, metallurgy is concerned with the production of metallic components for use in consumer or engineering products. This involves production of alloys, shaping, heat treatment and surface treatment of product. The task of the metallurgist is to achieve balance between material properties, such as cost, weight, strength, toughness, hardness, corrosion, fatigue resistance and performance in temperature extremes. To achieve this goal, the operating environment must be carefully considered.

Determining the hardness of the metal using the Rockwell, Vickers, and Brinell hardness scales is a commonly used practice that helps better understand the metal&#x27;s elasticity and plasticity for different applications and production processes. In a saltwater environment, most ferrous metals and some non-ferrous alloys corrode quickly. Metals exposed to cold or cryogenic conditions may undergo a ductile to brittle transition and lose their toughness, becoming more brittle and prone to cracking. Metals under continual cyclic loading can suffer from metal fatigue. Metals under constant stress at elevated temperatures can creep.

===Metalworking processes===
* Casting – molten metal is poured into a shaped mold. Variants of casting include sand casting, investment casting, also called the lost wax process, die casting, centrifugal casting, both vertical and horizontal, and continuous castings. Each of these forms has advantages for certain metals and applications considering factors like magnetism and corrosion.
* Forging – a red-hot billet is hammered into shape.
* Rolling – a billet is passed through successively narrower rollers to create a sheet.
* Extrusion – a hot and malleable metal is forced under pressure through a die, which shapes it before it cools.
* Machining – lathes, milling machines and drills cut the cold metal to shape.
* Sintering – a powdered metal is heated in a non-oxidizing environment after being compressed into a die.
* Fabrication – sheets of metal are cut with guillotines or gas cutters and bent and welded into structural shape.
* Laser cladding – metallic powder is blown through a movable laser beam (e.g. mounted on a NC 5-axis machine). The resulting melted metal reaches a substrate to form a melt pool. By moving the laser head, it is possible to stack the tracks and build up a three-dimensional piece.
* 3D printing – Sintering or melting amorphous powder metal in a 3D space to make any object to shape.

Cold-working processes, in which the product&#x27;s shape is altered by rolling, fabrication or other processes, while the product is cold, can increase the strength of the product by a process called work hardening. Work hardening creates microscopic defects in the metal, which resist further changes of shape.

===Heat treatment===

Metals can be heat-treated to alter the properties of strength, ductility, toughness, hardness and resistance to corrosion. Common heat treatment processes include annealing, precipitation strengthening, quenching, and tempering:
* Annealing process softens the metal by heating it and then allowing it to cool very slowly, which gets rid of stresses in the metal and makes the grain structure large and soft-edged so that, when the metal is hit or stressed it dents or perhaps bends, rather than breaking; it is also easier to sand, grind, or cut annealed metal.
* Quenching is the process of cooling metal very quickly after heating, thus &quot;freezing&quot; the metal&#x27;s molecules in the very hard martensite form, which makes the metal harder.
* Tempering relieves stresses in the metal that were caused by the hardening process; tempering makes the metal less hard while making it better able to sustain impacts without breaking.

Often, mechanical and thermal treatments are combined in what are known as thermo-mechanical treatments for better properties and more efficient processing of materials. These processes are common to high-alloy special steels, superalloys and titanium alloys.

===Plating===
Electroplating is a chemical surface-treatment technique. It involves bonding a thin layer of another metal such as gold, silver, chromium or zinc to the surface of the product. This is done by selecting the coating material electrolyte solution, which is the material that is going to coat the workpiece (gold, silver, zinc). There needs to be two electrodes of different materials: one the same material as the coating material and one that is receiving the coating material. Two electrodes are electrically charged and the coating material is stuck to the work piece. It is used to reduce corrosion as well as to improve the product&#x27;s aesthetic appearance. It is also used to make inexpensive metals look like the more expensive ones (gold, silver).

=== Shot peening ===

Shot peening is a cold working process used to finish metal parts. In the process of shot peening, small round shot is blasted against the surface of the part to be finished. This process is used to prolong the product life of the part, prevent stress corrosion failures, and also prevent fatigue. The shot leaves small dimples on the surface like a peen hammer does, which cause compression stress under the dimple. As the shot media strikes the material over and over, it forms many overlapping dimples throughout the piece being treated. The compression stress in the surface of the material strengthens the part and makes it more resistant to fatigue failure, stress failures, corrosion failure, and cracking.

===Thermal spraying===

Thermal spraying techniques are another popular finishing option, and often have better high temperature properties than electroplated coatings. Thermal spraying, also known as a spray welding process, is an industrial coating process that consists of a heat source (flame or other) and a coating material that can be in a powder or wire form, which is melted then sprayed on the surface of the material being treated at a high velocity. The spray treating process is known by many different names such as HVOF (High Velocity Oxygen Fuel), plasma spray, flame spray, arc spray and metalizing.

=== Electroless deposition ===

Electroless deposition (ED) or electroless plating is defined as the autocatalytic process through which metals and metal alloys are deposited onto nonconductive surfaces. These nonconductive surfaces include plastics, ceramics, and glass etc., which can then become decorative, anti-corrosive, and conductive depending on their final functions. Electroless deposition is a chemical processes that create metal coatings on various materials by autocatalytic chemical reduction of metal cations in a liquid bath.

==Characterization==

 Metallurgists study the microscopic and macroscopic structure of metals using metallography, a technique invented by Henry Clifton Sorby.

In metallography, an alloy of interest is ground flat and polished to a mirror finish. The sample can then be etched to reveal the microstructure and macrostructure of the metal. The sample is then examined in an optical or electron microscope, and the image contrast provides details on the composition, mechanical properties, and processing history.

Crystallography, often using diffraction of x-rays or electrons, is another valuable tool available to the modern metallurgist. Crystallography allows identification of unknown materials and reveals the crystal structure of the sample. Quantitative crystallography can be used to calculate the amount of phases present as well as the degree of strain to which a sample has been subjected.

Current advanced characterization techniques, which are used frequently in this field are: Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Electron Backscattered Diffraction (EBSD) and Atom-Probe Tomography (APT).

<text>MUMPS (&quot;Massachusetts General Hospital Utility Multi-Programming System&quot;), or M, is an imperative, high-level programming language with an integrated transaction processing key–value database. It was originally developed at Massachusetts General Hospital for managing patient medical records and hospital laboratory information systems.

MUMPS technology has since expanded as the predominant database for health information systems and electronic health records in the United States. MUMPS-based information systems, such as Epic Systems&#x27;, provide health information services for over 78% of patients across the U.S.

A unique feature of the MUMPS technology is its integrated database language, allowing direct, high-speed read-write access to permanent disk storage.

== History ==

=== 1960s-1970s - Genesis ===

MUMPS was developed by Neil Pappalardo, Robert A. Greenes, and Curt Marble in Dr. Octo Barnett&#x27;s lab at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) in Boston during 1966 and 1967. It grew out of frustration, during a National Institutes of Health (NIH)-support hospital information systems project at the MGH, with the development in assembly language on a time-shared PDP-1 by primary contractor Bolt Beranek &amp; Newman, Inc. (BBN). MUMPS came out of an internal &quot;skunkworks&quot; project at MGH by Pappalardo, Greenes, and Marble to create an alternative development environment. As a result of initial demonstration of capabilities, Dr. Barnett&#x27;s proposal to NIH in 1967 for renewal of the hospital computer project grant took the bold step of proposing that the system be built in MUMPS going forward, rather than relying on the BBN approach. The project was funded, and serious implementation of the system in MUMPS began.

The original MUMPS system was, like Unix a few years later, built on a DEC PDP-7. Octo Barnett and Neil Pappalardo obtained a backward compatible PDP-9, and began using MUMPS in the admissions cycle and laboratory test reporting. MUMPS was then an interpreted language, yet even then, incorporated a hierarchical database file system to standardize interaction with the data and abstract disk operations so they were only done by the MUMPS language itself. MUMPS was also used in its earliest days in an experimental clinical progress note entry system and a radiology report entry system.

Some aspects of MUMPS can be traced from RAND Corporation&#x27;s JOSS through BBN&#x27;s TELCOMP and STRINGCOMP. The MUMPS team chose to include portability between machines as a design goal.

An advanced feature of the MUMPS language not widely supported in operating systems or in computer hardware of the era was multitasking. Although time-sharing on mainframe computers was increasingly common in systems such as Multics, most mini-computers did not run parallel programs and threading was not available at all. Even on mainframes, the variant of batch processing where a program was run to completion was the most common implementation for an operating system of multi-programming.

It was a few years until Unix was developed. The lack of memory management hardware also meant that all multi-processing was fraught with the possibility that a memory pointer could change some other process. MUMPS programs do not have a standard way to refer to memory directly at all, in contrast to C language, so since the multitasking was enforced by the language, not by any program written in the language it was impossible to have the risk that existed for other systems.

Dan Brevik&#x27;s DEC MUMPS-15 system was adapted to a DEC PDP-15, where it lived for some time. It was first installed at Health Data Management Systems of Denver in May 1971. The portability proved to be useful and MUMPS was awarded a government research grant, and so MUMPS was released to the public domain which was a requirement for grants. MUMPS was soon ported to a number of other systems including the popular DEC PDP-8, the Data General Nova and on DEC PDP-11 and the Artronix PC12 minicomputer. Word about MUMPS spread mostly through the medical community, and was in widespread use, often being locally modified for their own needs.

Versions of the MUMPS system were rewritten by technical leaders Dennis &quot;Dan&quot; Brevik and Paul Stylos of DEC in 1970 and 1971. By the early 1970s, there were many and varied implementations of MUMPS on a range of hardware platforms. Another noteworthy platform was Paul Stylos&#x27; DEC MUMPS-11 on the PDP-11, and MEDITECH&#x27;s MIIS. In the Fall of 1972, many MUMPS users attended a conference in Boston which standardized the then-fractured language, and created the MUMPS Users Group and MUMPS Development Committee (MDC) to do so. These efforts proved successful; a standard was complete by 1974, and was approved, on September 15, 1977, as ANSI standard, X11.1-1977. At about the same time DEC launched DSM-11 (Digital Standard MUMPS) for the PDP-11. This quickly dominated the market, and became the reference implementation of the time. Also, InterSystems sold ISM-11 for the PDP-11 (which was identical to DSM-11).

=== 1980s ===

During the early 1980s several vendors brought MUMPS-based platforms that met the ANSI standard to market. The most significant were:
* Digital Equipment Corporation with DSM (Digital Standard MUMPS). For the PDP-11 series DSM-11 was released 1977. VAX DSM was sold in parallel after released 1978. Both hardware families as well as MUMPS versions were available until 1995 from DEC. The DSM-11 was ported to the Alpha in two variants: DSM for OpenVMS, and as DSM for Ultrix.
* InterSystems with ISM (InterSystems M) on VMS (M/VX), ISM-11 later M/11+ on the PDP-11 platform (1978), M/PC on MS-DOS, M/DG on Data General, M/VM on IBM VM/CMS, and M/UX on various Unixes.
* Greystone Technology Corporation founded 1980, with a compiled version called GT.M for AIX, HP-UX, UNIX and OpenVMS
* DataTree Inc. with an Intel PC-based product called DTM. (1982)
* Micronetics Design Corporation (1980) with a product line called MSM. MSM-PC, MSM/386, MS-UNIX, MSM-NT, MSM/VM fo IBM, VAX/VMS platforms and OpenVMS Alpha platforms.
* Computer Consultants (later renamed MGlobal), a Houston-based company originally created CCSM on 6800, then 6809, and eventually a port to the 68000, which later became MacMUMPS, a Mac OS-based product. They also worked on the MGM MUMPS implementation. MGlobal also ported their implementation to the DOS platform. MGlobal MUMPS was the first commercial MUMPS for the IBM PC and the only implementation for the classic Mac OS.
* Tandem Computers developed an implementation for their fault-tolerant computers.
* IBM briefly sold a MUMPS implementation named MUMPS/VM which ran as a virtual machine on top of VM/370.

This period also saw considerable MDC activity. The second revision of the ANSI standard for MUMPS (X11.1-1984) was approved on November 15, 1984.

=== 1990s ===

* On November 11, 1990, the third revision of the ANSI standard (X11.1-1990) was approved.
* In 1992 the same standard was also adopted as ISO standard 11756–1992. Use of M as an alternative name for the language was approved around the same time.
* On December 8, 1995, the fourth revision of the standard (X11.1-1995) was approved by ANSI, and by ISO in 1999 as ISO 11756:1999, which was also published by ANSI. The MDC finalized a further revision to the standard in 1998 but this has not been presented to ANSI for approval.
* In 1999 the last M Standard (ISO-IEC 11756-1999) was approved. ISO re-affirmed this on 2020. Together with ISO/IEC 15851:1999, Open MUMPS Interconnect and ISO/IEC 15852:1999, MUMPS Windowing Application Programmers Interface.

=== 2000s ===

* By 1998, the middleware vendor InterSystems had become the dominant player in the MUMPS market with the purchase of several other vendors. Initially they acquired DataTree Inc. in 1993. On December 30, 1994, InterSystems acquired the DSM product line from DEC. InterSystems consolidated these products into a single product line, branding them, on several hardware platforms, as OpenM. In 1997, InterSystems launched a new product named Caché. This was based on their ISM product, but with influences from the other implementations. Micronetics Design Corporation, at this time #2 on the market, was acquired by InterSystems on June 21, 1998. InterSystems remains the dominant &quot;M vendor&quot; owning MSM, DSM, ISM, DTM and selling its IRIS Data Platform (and, until 2018, its predecessor Caché) to M developers who write applications for a variety of operating systems. Also Intersystems did not use the term M anymore, neither followed the M standard. 
* Greystone Technology Corporation&#x27;s GT.M implementation was sold to Sanchez Computer Associates (now part of FIS) in the mid-1990s. On November 7, 2000, Sanchez made GT.M for Linux available under the GPL license and on October 28, 2005, GT.M for OpenVMS and Tru64 UNIX were also made available under the AGPL license. GT.M continues to be available on other UNIX platforms under a traditional license.
* During 2000, Ray Newman and others released MUMPS V1, an implementation of MUMPS (initially on FreeBSD) similar to DSM-11. MUMPS V1 has since been ported to Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows (using cygwin). Initially only for the x86 CPU, MUMPS V1 has now been ported to the Raspberry Pi.
* Released in April 2002 an MSM derivative called M21 is offered from the Real Software Company of Rugby, UK.
* There are also several open source implementations of MUMPS, including some research projects. The most notable of these is Mumps/II, by Dr. Kevin O&#x27;Kane (Professor Emeritus, University of Northern Iowa) and students&#x27; project. Dr. O&#x27;Kane has also ported the interpreter to Mac OS X.
* One of the original creators of the MUMPS language, Neil Pappalardo, founded a company called MEDITECH in 1969. They extended and built on the MUMPS language, naming the new language MIIS (and later, another language named MAGIC). Unlike InterSystems, MEDITECH no longer sells middleware, so MIIS and MAGIC are now only used internally at MEDITECH.
* New on the market since 2022 is MiniM from Eugene Karataev
=== Name ===
The chief executive of InterSystems disliked the name MUMPS and felt that it represented a serious marketing obstacle. Thus, favoring M to some extent became identified as alignment with InterSystems. The 1990 ANSI Standard was open to both M and MUMPS and after a &quot;world-wide&quot; discussion in 1992 the Mumps User Groups officially changed the name to M. The dispute also reflected rivalry between organizations (the M Technology Association, the MUMPS Development Committee, the ANSI and ISO Standards Committees) as to who determines the &quot;official&quot; name of the language.

As of 2020, the ISO still mentions both M and MUMPS as officially accepted names.

Massachusetts General Hospital registered &quot;MUMPS&quot; as a trademark with the USPTO on November 28, 1971, and renewed it on November 16, 1992, but let it expire on August 30, 2003.

== Design ==

=== Overview ===

MUMPS is a language intended for and designed to build database applications. Secondary language features were included to help programmers make applications using minimal computing resources. The original implementations were interpreted, though modern implementations may be fully or partially compiled. Individual &quot;programs&quot; run in memory &quot;partitions&quot;. Early MUMPS memory partitions were limited to 2048 bytes so aggressive abbreviation greatly aided multi-programming on severely resource limited hardware, because more than one MUMPS job could fit into the very small memories extant in hardware at the time. The ability to provide multi-user systems was another language design feature. The word &quot;Multi-Programming&quot; in the acronym points to this. Even the earliest machines running MUMPS supported multiple jobs running at the same time. With the change from mini-computers to micro-computers a few years later, even a &quot;single user PC&quot; with a single 8-bit CPU and 16K or 64K of memory could support multiple users, who could connect to it from (non-graphical) video display terminals.

Since memory was tight originally, the language design for MUMPS valued very terse code. Thus, every MUMPS command or function name could be abbreviated from one to three letters in length, e.g. (exit program) as , = function, = command, = function. Spaces and end-of-line markers are significant in MUMPS because line scope promoted the same terse language design. Thus, a single line of program code could express, with few characters, an idea for which other programming languages could require 5 to 10 times as many characters. Abbreviation was a common feature of languages designed in this period (e.g., FOCAL-69, early BASICs such as Tiny BASIC, etc.). An unfortunate side effect of this, coupled with the early need to write minimalist code, was that MUMPS programmers routinely did not comment code and used extensive abbreviations. This meant that even an expert MUMPS programmer could not just skim through a page of code to see its function but would have to analyze it line by line.

Database interaction is transparently built into the language. The MUMPS language provides a hierarchical database made up of persistent sparse arrays, which is implicitly &quot;opened&quot; for every MUMPS application. All variable names prefixed with the caret character () use permanent (instead of RAM) storage, will maintain their values after the application exits, and will be visible to (and modifiable by) other running applications. Variables using this shared and permanent storage are called &quot;Globals&quot; in MUMPS, because the scoping of these variables is &quot;globally available&quot; to all jobs on the system. The more recent and more common use of the name &quot;global variables&quot; in other languages is a more limited scoping of names, coming from the fact that unscoped variables are &quot;globally&quot; available to any programs running in the same process, but not shared among multiple processes. The MUMPS Storage mode (i.e. globals stored as persistent sparse arrays), gives the MUMPS database the characteristics of a document-oriented database.

All variable names which are not prefixed with caret character () are temporary and private. Like global variables, they also have a hierarchical storage model, but are only &quot;locally available&quot; to a single job, thus they are called &quot;locals&quot;. Both &quot;globals&quot; and &quot;locals&quot; can have child nodes (called &quot;subscripts&quot; in MUMPS terminology). Subscripts are not limited to numerals—any ASCII character or group of characters can be a subscript identifier. While this is not uncommon for modern languages such as Perl or JavaScript, it was a highly unusual feature in the late 1970s. This capability was not universally implemented in MUMPS systems before the 1984 ANSI standard, as only canonically numeric subscripts were required by the standard to be allowed. Thus, the variable named &#x27;Car&#x27; can have subscripts &quot;Door&quot;, &quot;Steering Wheel&quot;, and &quot;Engine&quot;, each of which can contain a value and have subscripts of their own. The variable could have a nested variable subscript of &quot;Color&quot; for example. Thus, you could say
SET ^Car(&quot;Door&quot;,&quot;Color&quot;)=&quot;BLUE&quot;
to modify a nested child node of . In MUMPS terms, &quot;Color&quot; is the 2nd subscript of the variable (both the names of the child-nodes and the child-nodes themselves are likewise called subscripts). Hierarchical variables are similar to objects with properties in many object-oriented languages. Additionally, the MUMPS language design requires that all subscripts of variables are automatically kept in sorted order. Numeric subscripts (including floating-point numbers) are stored from lowest to highest. All non-numeric subscripts are stored in alphabetical order following the numbers. In MUMPS terminology, this is &quot;canonical order&quot;. By using only non-negative integer subscripts, the MUMPS programmer can emulate the arrays data type from other languages. Although MUMPS does not natively offer a full set of DBMS features such as mandatory schemas, several DBMS systems have been built on top of it that provide application developers with flat-file, relational, and network database features.

Additionally, there are built-in operators which treat a delimited string (e.g., comma-separated values) as an array. Early MUMPS programmers would often store a structure of related information as a delimited string, parsing it after it was read in; this saved disk access time and offered considerable speed advantages on some hardware.

MUMPS has no data types. Numbers can be treated as strings of digits, or strings can be treated as numbers by numeric operators (&quot;coerced&quot;, in MUMPS terminology). Coercion can have some odd side effects, however. For example, when a string is coerced, the parser turns as much of the string (starting from the left) into a number as it can, then discards the rest. Thus the statement codice_1 is evaluated as codice_2 in MUMPS.

Other features of the language are intended to help MUMPS applications interact with each other in a multi-user environment. Database locks, process identifiers, and atomicity of database update transactions are all required of standard MUMPS implementations.

In contrast to languages in the C or Wirth traditions, some space characters between MUMPS statements are significant. A single space separates a command from its argument, and a space, or newline, separates each argument from the next MUMPS token. Commands which take no arguments (e.g., codice_3) require two following spaces. The concept is that one space separates the command from the (nonexistent) argument, the next separates the &quot;argument&quot; from the next command. Newlines are also significant; an codice_4, codice_3 or codice_6 command processes (or skips) everything else till the end-of-line. To make those statements control multiple lines, you must use the codice_7 command to create a code block.

=== Hello, World! example ===

A simple &quot;Hello, World!&quot; program in MUMPS might be:
 write &quot;Hello, World!&quot;,!


and would be run with the command codice_8 after it has been saved to disk. For direct execution of the code a kind of &quot;label&quot; (any alphanumeric string) on the first position of the program line is needed to tell the mumps interpreter where to start execution. Since MUMPS allows commands to be strung together on the same line, and since commands can be abbreviated to a single letter, this routine could be made more compact:
w &quot;Hello, World!&quot;,! 
The &#x27;codice_9&#x27; after the text generates a newline. This code would return to the prompt.

=== Features ===

ANSI X11.1-1995 gives a complete, formal description of the language; an annotated version of this standard is available online.

Language features include:

; Data types : There is one universal data type, which is implicitly coerced to string, integer, or floating-point data types as context requires.

; Booleans : In IF commands and other syntax that has expressions evaluated as conditions, any string value is evaluated as a numeric value and, if that is a nonzero value, then it is interpreted as True. codice_10 sets A to &quot;FOO&quot; if N is less than 10; codice_11 performs PRINTERR if N is greater than 100. This construct provides a conditional whose scope is less than a full line.

; Abbreviation : You can abbreviate nearly all commands and native functions to one, two, or three characters.

; Reserved words : None. Since MUMPS interprets source code by context, there is no need for reserved words. You may use the names of language commands as variables, so the following is perfectly legal MUMPS code:
GREPTHIS()
 NEW SET,NEW,THEN,IF,KILL,QUIT SET IF=&quot;KILL&quot;,SET=&quot;11&quot;,KILL=&quot;11&quot;,QUIT=&quot;RETURN&quot;,THEN=&quot;KILL&quot;
 IF IF=THEN DO THEN
 QUIT:$QUIT QUIT QUIT ; (quit)
THEN IF IF,SET&amp;KILL SET SET=SET+KILL QUIT
:MUMPS can be made more obfuscated by using the contracted operator syntax, as shown in this terse example derived from the example above:
GREPTHIS()
 N S,N,T,I,K,Q S I=&quot;K&quot;,S=&quot;11&quot;,K=&quot;11&quot;,Q=&quot;R&quot;,T=&quot;K&quot;
 I I=T D T
 Q:$Q Q Q
T I I,S&amp;K S S=S+K Q
; Arrays : are created dynamically, stored as B-trees, are sparse (i.e. use almost no space for missing nodes), can use any number of subscripts, and subscripts can be strings or numeric (including floating point). Arrays are always automatically stored in sorted order, so there is never any occasion to sort, pack, reorder, or otherwise reorganize the database. Built-in functions such as , , (deprecated), and functions provide efficient examination and traversal of the fundamental array structure, on disk or in memory.
for i=10000:1:12345 set sqtable(i)=i*i
set address(&quot;Smith&quot;,&quot;Daniel&quot;)=&quot;dpbsmith@world.std.com&quot;
; Local arrays : variable names not beginning with caret (i.e. &quot;^&quot;) are stored in memory by process, are private to the creating process, and expire when the creating process terminates. The available storage depends on implementation. For those implementations using partitions, it is limited to the partition size (a small partition might be 32K). For other implementations, it may be several megabytes.

; Global arrays : codice_12. These are stored on disk, are available to all processes, and are persistent when the creating process terminates. Very large globals (for example, hundreds of gigabytes) are practical and efficient in most implementations. This is MUMPS&#x27; main &quot;database&quot; mechanism. It is used instead of calling on the operating system to create, write, and read files.

; Indirection : in many contexts, codice_13 can be used, and effectively substitutes the contents of VBL into another MUMPS statement. codice_14 sets the variable ABC to 123. codice_15 performs the subroutine named REPORT. This substitution allows for lazy evaluation and late binding as well as effectively the operational equivalent of &quot;pointers&quot; in other languages.

; Piece function : This breaks variables into segmented pieces guided by a user specified separator string (sometimes called a &quot;delimiter&quot;). Those who know awk will find this familiar. codice_16 means the &quot;third caret-separated piece of .&quot; The piece function can also appear as an assignment (SET command) target.

:codice_17 yields .

:After
SET X=&quot;dpbsmith@world.std.com&quot;
:codice_18 causes X to become &quot;office@world.std.com&quot; (note that is equivalent to and could be written as such).

; Order function : This function treats its input as a structure, and finds the next index that exists which has the same structure except for the last subscript. It returns the sorted value that is ordered after the one given as input. (This treats the array reference as a content-addressable data rather than an address of a value.)
Set stuff(6)=&quot;xyz&quot;,stuff(10)=26,stuff(15)=&quot;&quot;
:codice_19 yields , codice_20 yields , codice_21 yields , codice_22 yields , codice_23 yields .
Set i=&quot;&quot; For Set i=$O(stuff(i)) Quit:i=&quot;&quot; Write !,i,10,stuff(i)
:Here, the argument-less repeats until stopped by a terminating . This line prints a table of and where is successively 6, 10, and 15.

:For iterating the database, the Order function returns the next key to use.
GTM&gt;S n=&quot;&quot;
GTM&gt;S n=$order(^nodex(n))
GTM&gt;zwr n
n=&quot; building&quot;
GTM&gt;S n=$order(^nodex(n))
GTM&gt;zwr n
n=&quot; name:gd&quot;
GTM&gt;S n=$order(^nodex(n))
GTM&gt;zwr n
n=&quot;%kml:guid&quot;
MUMPS supports multiple simultaneous users and processes even when the underlying operating system does not (e.g., MS-DOS). Additionally, there is the ability to specify an environment for a variable, such as by specifying a machine name in a variable (as in codice_24), which can allow you to access data on remote machines.

=== Criticism ===
Some aspects of MUMPS syntax differ strongly from that of more modern languages, which can cause confusion, although those aspects vary between different versions of the language. On some versions, whitespace is not allowed within expressions, as it ends a statement: codice_25 is an error, and must be written codice_26. All operators have the same precedence and are left-associative (codice_27 evaluates to 50). The operators for &quot;less than or equal to&quot; and &quot;greater than or equal to&quot; are codice_28 and codice_29 (that is, the Boolean negation operator codice_30 plus a strict comparison operator in the opposite direction), although some versions allow the use of the more standard codice_31 and codice_32 respectively. Periods (codice_33) are used to indent the lines in a DO block, not whitespace. The ELSE command does not need a corresponding IF, as it operates by inspecting the value in the built-in system variable codice_34.

MUMPS scoping rules are more permissive than other modern languages. Declared local variables are scoped using the stack. A routine can normally see all declared locals of the routines below it on the call stack, and routines cannot prevent routines they call from modifying their declared locals, unless the caller manually creates a new stack level (codice_35) and aliases each of the variables they wish to protect (codice_36) before calling any child routines. By contrast, undeclared variables (variables created by using them, rather than declaration) are in scope for all routines running in the same process, and remain in scope until the program exits.

Because MUMPS database references differ from internal variable references only in the caret prefix, it is dangerously easy to unintentionally edit the database, or even to delete a database &quot;table&quot;.

== Users ==

The US Department of Veterans Affairs (formerly the Veterans Administration) was one of the earliest major adopters of the MUMPS language. Their development work (and subsequent contributions to the free MUMPS application codebase) was an influence on many medical users worldwide. In 1995, the Veterans Affairs&#x27; patient Admission/Tracking/Discharge system, Decentralized Hospital Computer Program (DHCP) was the recipient of the Computerworld Smithsonian Award for best use of Information Technology in Medicine. In July 2006, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) / Veterans Health Administration (VHA) was the recipient of the Innovations in American Government Award presented by the Ash Institute of the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University for its extension of DHCP into the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA). Nearly the entire VA hospital system in the United States, the Indian Health Service, and major parts of the Department of Defense CHCS hospital system use MUMPS databases for clinical data tracking.

Other healthcare IT companies using MUMPS include:

* Epic
* MEDITECH
* GE Healthcare (formerly IDX Systems and Centricity)
* AmeriPath (part of Quest Diagnostics)
* Care Centric
* Allscripts
* Coventry Health Care
* EMIS Health
* Sunquest Information Systems (formerly Misys Healthcare).
* Netsmart

Many reference laboratories, such as DASA, Quest Diagnostics, and Dynacare, use MUMPS software written by or based on Antrim Corporation code. Antrim was purchased by Misys Healthcare (now Sunquest Information Systems) in 2001.

MUMPS is also widely used in financial applications. MUMPS gained an early following in the financial sector and is in use at many banks and credit unions. It is used by the Bank of England and Barclays Bank.

== Implementations ==

Since 2005, the most popular implementations of MUMPS have been Greystone Technology MUMPS (GT.M) from Fidelity National Information Services, and Caché, from Intersystems Corporation. The European Space Agency announced on May 13, 2010, that it will use the InterSystems Caché database to support the &quot;Gaia&quot; mission. This mission aims to map the Milky Way with unprecedented precision. InterSystems is in the process of phasing out Caché in favor of Iris.

Other current implementations include:

* M21
* YottaDB
* MiniM
* Reference Standard M
* FreeM

<doc id="19726" wikidata="Q206040" url="?curid=19726" title="Mercury (programming language)">
<text>Mercury is a functional logic programming language made for real-world uses. The first version was developed at the University of Melbourne, Computer Science department, by Fergus Henderson, Thomas Conway, and Zoltan Somogyi, under Somogyi&#x27;s supervision, and released on April 8, 1995.

Mercury is a purely declarative logic programming language. It is related to both Prolog and Haskell. It features a strong, static, polymorphic type system, and a strong mode and determinism system.

The official implementation, the Melbourne Mercury Compiler, is available for most Unix and Unix-like platforms, including Linux, macOS, and for Windows.

==Overview==
Mercury is based on the logic programming language Prolog. It has the same syntax and the same basic concepts such as the selective linear definite clause resolution (SLD) algorithm. It can be viewed as a pure subset of Prolog with strong types and modes. As such, it is often compared to its predecessor in features and run-time efficiency.

The language is designed using software engineering principles. Unlike the original implementations of Prolog, it has a separate compilation phase, rather than being directly interpreted. This allows a much wider range of errors to be detected before running a program. It features a strict static type and mode system and a module system.

By using information obtained at compile time (such as type and mode), programs written in Mercury typically perform significantly faster than equivalent programs written in Prolog. Its authors claim that Mercury is the fastest logic language in the world, by a wide margin.

Mercury is a purely declarative language, unlike Prolog, since it lacks &quot;extra-logical&quot; Prolog statements such as codice_1 (cut) and imperative input/output (I/O). This enables advanced static program analysis and program optimization, including compile-time garbage collection, but it can make certain programming constructs (such as a switch over a number of options, with a default) harder to express. While Mercury does allow impure functionality, it serves mainly as a way to call foreign language code. All impure code must be explicitly marked. Operations which would typically be impure (such as input/output) are expressed using pure constructs in Mercury using linear types, by threading a dummy &quot;world&quot; value through all relevant code.

Notable programs written in Mercury include the Mercury compiler and the Prince XML formatter. The Software company ODASE has also been using Mercury to develop its Ontology-Centric software development platform, ODASE.

==Back-ends==
Mercury has several back-ends, which enable compiling Mercury code into several languages, including:

===Production level===
* Low-level C for GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), the original Mercury back-end
* High-level C
* Java
* C#

===Past===
* Assembly language via the GCC back-end
* Aditi, a deductive database system also developed at the University of Melbourne. Mercury-0.12.2 is the last version to support Aditi.
* Common Intermediate Language (CIL) for the .NET Framework
* Erlang

Mercury also features a foreign language interface, allowing code in other languages (depending on the chosen back-end) to be linked with Mercury code. The following foreign languages are possible:
Other languages can then be interfaced to by calling them from these languages. However, this means that foreign language code may need to be written several times for the different backends, otherwise portability between backends will be lost.

The most commonly used back-end is the original low-level C back-end.

== Examples ==
Hello World:

 :- module hello.
 :- interface.
 :- import_module io.
 :- pred main(io::di, io::uo) is det.

 :- implementation.
 main(!IO) :-
 io.write_string(&quot;Hello, World!\n&quot;, !IO).
Calculating the 10th Fibonacci number (in the most obvious way):

 :- module fib.
 :- interface.
 :- import_module io.
 :- pred main(io::di, io::uo) is det.
 :- implementation.
 :- import_module int.

 :- func fib(int) = int.
 fib(N) = (if N =&lt; 2 then 1 else fib(N - 1) + fib(N - 2)).

 main(!IO) :-
 io.write_string(&quot;fib(10) = &quot;, !IO),
 io.write_int(fib(10), !IO),
 io.nl(!IO).
 % Could instead use io.format(&quot;fib(10) = %d\n&quot;, [i(fib(10))], !IO).

codice_2 is a &quot;state variable&quot;, which is syntactic sugar for a pair of variables which are assigned concrete names at compilation; for example, the above is desugared to something like:

 main(IO0, IO) :-
 io.write_string(&quot;fib(10) = &quot;, IO0, IO1),
 io.write_int(fib(10), IO1, IO2),
 io.nl(IO2, IO).
==Release schedule==
The stable release naming scheme was 0.1 up to 0.13 for the first thirteen stable releases. In February 2010 the Mercury project decided to name each stable release by using the year and month of the release. For example 10.04 is for a release made in April 2010.

There is often also a periodic snapshot of the development system &quot;release of the day&quot; (ROTD)

==IDE and editor support==
* Developers provide support for Vim
* Flycheck library for Emacs
* A plugin is available for the Eclipse IDE
* A plugin is available for the NetBeans IDE

==See also==

* Curry, another functional logic language
* Alice, a dialect language of Standard ML
* Logtalk, language, an object-oriented extension of Prolog which compiles down to Prolog
* Oz/Mozart, a multiparadigm language
* Visual Prolog, language, a strongly typed object-oriented extension of Prolog, with a new syntax

<doc id="19727" wikidata="Q8750" url="?curid=19727" title="Michael Faraday">
<text>Michael Faraday (; 22 September 1791 – 25 August 1867) was an English chemist and physicist who contributed to the study of electrochemistry and electromagnetism. His main discoveries include the principles underlying electromagnetic induction, diamagnetism, and electrolysis. Although Faraday received little formal education, as a self-made man, he was one of the most influential scientists in history. It was by his research on the magnetic field around a conductor carrying a direct current that Faraday established the concept of the electromagnetic field in physics. Faraday also established that magnetism could affect rays of light and that there was an underlying relationship between the two phenomena. He similarly discovered the principles of electromagnetic induction, diamagnetism, and the laws of electrolysis. His inventions of electromagnetic rotary devices formed the foundation of electric motor technology, and it was largely due to his efforts that electricity became practical for use in technology. The SI unit of capacitance, the farad, is named after him.

As a chemist, Faraday discovered benzene, investigated the clathrate hydrate of chlorine, invented an early form of the Bunsen burner and the system of oxidation numbers, and popularised terminology such as &quot;anode&quot;, &quot;cathode&quot;, &quot;electrode&quot; and &quot;ion&quot;. Faraday ultimately became the first and foremost Fullerian Professor of Chemistry at the Royal Institution, a lifetime position.

Faraday was an experimentalist who conveyed his ideas in clear and simple language. His mathematical abilities did not extend as far as trigonometry and were limited to the simplest algebra. Physicist and mathematician James Clerk Maxwell took the work of Faraday and others and summarised it in a set of equations which is accepted as the basis of all modern theories of electromagnetic phenomena. On Faraday&#x27;s uses of lines of force, Maxwell wrote that they show Faraday &quot;to have been in reality a mathematician of a very high order – one from whom the mathematicians of the future may derive valuable and fertile methods.&quot; 

Albert Einstein kept a portrait of Faraday on his study wall, alongside those of Isaac Newton and James Clerk Maxwell. Physicist Ernest Rutherford stated, &quot;When we consider the magnitude and extent of his discoveries and their influence on the progress of science and of industry, there is no honour too great to pay to the memory of Faraday, one of the greatest scientific discoverers of all time.&quot;

==Biography==
===Early life===
Michael Faraday was born on 22 September 1791 in Newington Butts, Surrey, which is now part of the London Borough of Southwark. His family was not well off. His father, James, was a member of the Glasite sect of Christianity. James Faraday moved his wife, Margaret (née Hastwell), and two children to London during the winter of 1790 from Outhgill in Westmorland, where he had been an apprentice to the village blacksmith. Michael was born in the autumn of the following year, the third of four children. The young Michael Faraday, having only the most basic school education, had to educate himself.

At the age of 14, he became an apprentice to George Riebau, a local bookbinder and bookseller in Blandford Street. During his seven-year apprenticeship Faraday read many books, including Isaac Watts&#x27;s &quot;The Improvement of the Mind&quot;, and he enthusiastically implemented the principles and suggestions contained therein. During this period, Faraday held discussions with his peers in the City Philosophical Society, where he attended lectures about various scientific topics. He also developed an interest in science, especially in electricity. Faraday was particularly inspired by the book &quot;Conversations on Chemistry&quot; by Jane Marcet.

===Adult life===

In 1812, at the age of 20 and at the end of his apprenticeship, Faraday attended lectures by the eminent English chemist Humphry Davy of the Royal Institution and the Royal Society, and John Tatum, founder of the City Philosophical Society. Many of the tickets for these lectures were given to Faraday by William Dance, who was one of the founders of the Royal Philharmonic Society. Faraday subsequently sent Davy a 300-page book based on notes that he had taken during these lectures. Davy&#x27;s reply was immediate, kind, and favourable. In 1813, when Davy damaged his eyesight in an accident with nitrogen trichloride, he decided to employ Faraday as an assistant. Coincidentally one of the Royal Institution&#x27;s assistants, John Payne, was sacked and Sir Humphry Davy had been asked to find a replacement; thus he appointed Faraday as Chemical Assistant at the Royal Institution on 1 March 1813. Very soon, Davy entrusted Faraday with the preparation of nitrogen trichloride samples, and they both were injured in an explosion of this very sensitive substance.

Faraday married Sarah Barnard (1800–1879) on 12 June 1821. They met through their families at the Sandemanian church, and he confessed his faith to the Sandemanian congregation the month after they were married. They had no children. Faraday was a devout Christian; his Sandemanian denomination was an offshoot of the Church of Scotland. Well after his marriage, he served as deacon and for two terms as an elder in the meeting house of his youth. His church was located at Paul&#x27;s Alley in the Barbican. This meeting house relocated in 1862 to Barnsbury Grove, Islington; this North London location was where Faraday served the final two years of his second term as elder prior to his resignation from that post. Biographers have noted that &quot;a strong sense of the unity of God and nature pervaded Faraday&#x27;s life and work.&quot;

===Later life===

In June 1832, the University of Oxford granted Faraday an honorary Doctor of Civil Law degree. During his lifetime, he was offered a knighthood in recognition for his services to science, which he turned down on religious grounds, believing that it was against the word of the Bible to accumulate riches and pursue worldly reward, and stating that he preferred to remain &quot;plain Mr Faraday to the end&quot;. Elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1824, he twice refused to become President. He became the first Fullerian Professor of Chemistry at the Royal Institution in 1833.

In 1832, Faraday was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1838. In 1840, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society. He was one of eight foreign members elected to the French Academy of Sciences in 1844. In 1849 he was elected as associated member to the Royal Institute of the Netherlands, which two years later became the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences and he was subsequently made foreign member.
Faraday had a nervous breakdown in 1839 but eventually returned to his investigations into electromagnetism. In 1848, as a result of representations by the Prince Consort, Faraday was awarded a grace and favour house in Hampton Court in Middlesex, free of all expenses and upkeep. This was the Master Mason&#x27;s House, later called Faraday House, and now No. 37 Hampton Court Road. In 1858 Faraday retired to live there.
Having provided a number of various service projects for the British government, when asked by the government to advise on the production of chemical weapons for use in the Crimean War (1853–1856), Faraday refused to participate, citing ethical reasons. He also refused offers to publish his lectures, believing that they would lose impact if not accompanied by the live experiments. His reply to an offer from a publisher in a letter ends with: &quot;I have always loved science more than money &amp; because my occupation is almost entirely personal I cannot afford to get rich.&quot;

Faraday died at his house at Hampton Court on 25 August 1867, aged 75. He had some years before turned down an offer of burial in Westminster Abbey upon his death, but he has a memorial plaque there, near Isaac Newton&#x27;s tomb. Faraday was interred in the dissenters&#x27; (non-Anglican) section of Highgate Cemetery.

==Scientific achievements==
===Chemistry===

Faraday&#x27;s earliest chemical work was as an assistant to Humphry Davy. Faraday was involved in the study of chlorine; he discovered two new compounds of chlorine and carbon: hexachloroethane which he made via the chlorination of ethylene and carbon tetrachloride from the decomposition of the former. He also conducted the first rough experiments on the diffusion of gases, a phenomenon that was first pointed out by John Dalton. The physical importance of this phenomenon was more fully revealed by Thomas Graham and Joseph Loschmidt. Faraday succeeded in liquefying several gases, investigated the alloys of steel, and produced several new kinds of glass intended for optical purposes. A specimen of one of these heavy glasses subsequently became historically important; when the glass was placed in a magnetic field Faraday determined the rotation of the plane of polarisation of light. This specimen was also the first substance found to be repelled by the poles of a magnet.

Faraday invented an early form of what was to become the Bunsen burner, which is still in practical use in science laboratories around the world as a convenient source of heat.
Faraday worked extensively in the field of chemistry, discovering chemical substances such as benzene (which he called bicarburet of hydrogen) and liquefying gases such as chlorine. The liquefying of gases helped to establish that gases are the vapours of liquids possessing a very low boiling point and gave a more solid basis to the concept of molecular aggregation. In 1820 Faraday reported the first synthesis of compounds made from carbon and chlorine, C2Cl6 and CCl4, and published his results the following year. Faraday also determined the composition of the chlorine clathrate hydrate, which had been discovered by Humphry Davy in 1810. Faraday is also responsible for discovering the laws of electrolysis, and for popularising terminology such as anode, cathode, electrode, and ion, terms proposed in large part by William Whewell.

Faraday was the first to report what later came to be called metallic nanoparticles. In 1847 he discovered that the optical properties of gold colloids differed from those of the corresponding bulk metal. This was probably the first reported observation of the effects of quantum size, and might be considered to be the birth of nanoscience.

===Electricity and magnetism===
Faraday is best known for his work on electricity and magnetism. His first recorded experiment was the construction of a voltaic pile with seven British halfpenny coins, stacked together with seven discs of sheet zinc, and six pieces of paper moistened with salt water. With this pile he passed the electric current through a solution of sulfate of magnesia and succeeded in decomposing the chemical compound (recorded in first letter to Abbott, 12 July 1812).
In 1821, soon after the Danish physicist and chemist Hans Christian Ørsted discovered the phenomenon of electromagnetism, Davy and William Hyde Wollaston tried, but failed, to design an electric motor. Faraday, having discussed the problem with the two men, went on to build two devices to produce what he called &quot;electromagnetic rotation&quot;. One of these, now known as the homopolar motor, caused a continuous circular motion that was engendered by the circular magnetic force around a wire that extended into a pool of mercury wherein was placed a magnet; the wire would then rotate around the magnet if supplied with current from a chemical battery. These experiments and inventions formed the foundation of modern electromagnetic technology. In his excitement, Faraday published results without acknowledging his work with either Wollaston or Davy. The resulting controversy within the Royal Society strained his mentor relationship with Davy and may well have contributed to Faraday&#x27;s assignment to other activities, which consequently prevented his involvement in electromagnetic research for several years.
From his initial discovery in 1821, Faraday continued his laboratory work, exploring electromagnetic properties of materials and developing requisite experience. In 1824, Faraday briefly set up a circuit to study whether a magnetic field could regulate the flow of a current in an adjacent wire, but he found no such relationship. This experiment followed similar work conducted with light and magnets three years earlier that yielded identical results. During the next seven years, Faraday spent much of his time perfecting his recipe for optical quality (heavy) glass, borosilicate of lead, which he used in his future studies connecting light with magnetism. In his spare time, Faraday continued publishing his experimental work on optics and electromagnetism; he conducted correspondence with scientists whom he had met on his journeys across Europe with Davy, and who were also working on electromagnetism. Two years after the death of Davy, in 1831, he began his great series of experiments in which he discovered electromagnetic induction, recording in his laboratory diary on 28 October 1831 that he was &quot;making many experiments with the great magnet of the Royal Society&quot;.

Faraday&#x27;s breakthrough came when he wrapped two insulated coils of wire around an iron ring, and found that, upon passing a current through one coil, a momentary current was induced in the other coil. This phenomenon is now known as mutual inductance. The iron ring-coil apparatus is still on display at the Royal Institution. In subsequent experiments, he found that if he moved a magnet through a loop of wire an electric current flowed in that wire. The current also flowed if the loop was moved over a stationary magnet. His demonstrations established that a changing magnetic field produces an electric field; this relation was modelled mathematically by James Clerk Maxwell as Faraday&#x27;s law, which subsequently became one of the four Maxwell equations, and which have in turn evolved into the generalization known today as field theory. Faraday would later use the principles he had discovered to construct the electric dynamo, the ancestor of modern power generators and the electric motor.
In 1832, he completed a series of experiments aimed at investigating the fundamental nature of electricity; Faraday used &quot;static&quot;, batteries, and &quot;animal electricity&quot; to produce the phenomena of electrostatic attraction, electrolysis, magnetism, etc. He concluded that, contrary to the scientific opinion of the time, the divisions between the various &quot;kinds&quot; of electricity were illusory. Faraday instead proposed that only a single &quot;electricity&quot; exists, and the changing values of quantity and intensity (current and voltage) would produce different groups of phenomena.

Near the end of his career, Faraday proposed that electromagnetic forces extended into the empty space around the conductor. This idea was rejected by his fellow scientists, and Faraday did not live to see the eventual acceptance of his proposition by the scientific community. It would be another half a century before electricity was used in technology, with the West End&#x27;s Savoy Theatre, fitted with the incandescent light bulb developed by Sir Joseph Swan, the first public building in the world to be lit by electricity. As recorded by the Royal Institution, &quot;Faraday invented the generator in 1831 but it took nearly 50 years before all the technology, including Joseph Swan&#x27;s incandescent filament light bulbs used here, came into common use&quot;.

===Diamagnetism===

In 1845, Faraday discovered that many materials exhibit a weak repulsion from a magnetic field: an effect he termed diamagnetism.

Faraday also discovered that the plane of polarization of linearly polarised light can be rotated by the application of an external magnetic field aligned with the direction in which the light is moving. This is now termed the Faraday effect. In Sept 1845 he wrote in his notebook, &quot;I have at last succeeded in &quot;illuminating a magnetic curve&quot; or &quot;line of force&quot; and in &quot;magnetising a ray of light&quot;&quot;.

Later on in his life, in 1862, Faraday used a spectroscope to search for a different alteration of light, the change of spectral lines by an applied magnetic field. The equipment available to him was, however, insufficient for a definite determination of spectral change. Pieter Zeeman later used an improved apparatus to study the same phenomenon, publishing his results in 1897 and receiving the 1902 Nobel Prize in Physics for his success. In both his 1897 paper and his Nobel acceptance speech, Zeeman made reference to Faraday&#x27;s work.

====Faraday cage====
In his work on static electricity, Faraday&#x27;s ice pail experiment demonstrated that the charge resided only on the exterior of a charged conductor, and exterior charge had no influence on anything enclosed within a conductor. This is because the exterior charges redistribute such that the interior fields emanating from them cancel one another. This shielding effect is used in what is now known as a Faraday cage. In January 1836, Faraday had put a wooden frame, 12 ft square, on four glass supports and added paper walls and wire mesh. He then stepped inside and electrified it. When he stepped out of his electrified cage, Faraday had shown that electricity was a force, not an imponderable fluid as was believed at the time.

==Royal Institution and public service==

Faraday had a long association with the Royal Institution of Great Britain. He was appointed Assistant Superintendent of the House of the Royal Institution in 1821. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1824. In 1825, he became Director of the Laboratory of the Royal Institution. Six years later, in 1833, Faraday became the first Fullerian Professor of Chemistry at the Royal Institution of Great Britain, a position to which he was appointed for life without the obligation to deliver lectures. His sponsor and mentor was John &#x27;Mad Jack&#x27; Fuller, who created the position at the Royal Institution for Faraday.

Beyond his scientific research into areas such as chemistry, electricity, and magnetism at the Royal Institution, Faraday undertook numerous, and often time-consuming, service projects for private enterprise and the British government. This work included investigations of explosions in coal mines, being an expert witness in court, and along with two engineers from Chance Brothers , the preparation of high-quality optical glass, which was required by Chance for its lighthouses. In 1846, together with Charles Lyell, he produced a lengthy and detailed report on a serious explosion in the colliery at Haswell, County Durham, which killed 95 miners. Their report was a meticulous forensic investigation and indicated that coal dust contributed to the severity of the explosion. The first-time explosions had been linked to dust, Faraday gave a demonstration during a lecture on how ventilation could prevent it. The report should have warned coal owners of the hazard of coal dust explosions, but the risk was ignored for over 60 years until the 1913 Senghenydd Colliery Disaster.
As a respected scientist in a nation with strong maritime interests, Faraday spent extensive amounts of time on projects such as the construction and operation of lighthouses and protecting the bottoms of ships from corrosion. His workshop still stands at Trinity Buoy Wharf above the Chain and Buoy Store, next to London&#x27;s only lighthouse where he carried out the first experiments in electric lighting for lighthouses.

Faraday was also active in what would now be called environmental science, or engineering. He investigated industrial pollution at Swansea and was consulted on air pollution at the Royal Mint. In July 1855, Faraday wrote a letter to &quot;The Times&quot; on the subject of the foul condition of the River Thames, which resulted in an often-reprinted cartoon in &quot;Punch&quot;. (See also The Great Stink).
Faraday assisted with the planning and judging of exhibits for the Great Exhibition of 1851 in Hyde Park, London. He also advised the National Gallery on the cleaning and protection of its art collection, and served on the National Gallery Site Commission in 1857. Education was another of Faraday&#x27;s areas of service; he lectured on the topic in 1854 at the Royal Institution, and, in 1862, he appeared before a Public Schools Commission to give his views on education in Great Britain. Faraday also weighed in negatively on the public&#x27;s fascination with table-turning, mesmerism, and seances, and in so doing chastised both the public and the nation&#x27;s educational system.

Before his famous Christmas lectures, Faraday delivered chemistry lectures for the City Philosophical Society from 1816 to 1818 in order to refine the quality of his lectures.
Between 1827 and 1860 at the Royal Institution in London, Faraday gave a series of nineteen Christmas lectures for young people, a series which continues today. The objective of the lectures was to present science to the general public in the hopes of inspiring them and generating revenue for the Royal Institution. They were notable events on the social calendar among London&#x27;s gentry. Over the course of several letters to his close friend Benjamin Abbott, Faraday outlined his recommendations on the art of lecturing, writing &quot;a flame should be lighted at the commencement and kept alive with unremitting splendour to the end&quot;. His lectures were joyful and juvenile, he delighted in filling soap bubbles with various gasses (in order to determine whether or not they are magnetic), but the lectures were also deeply philosophical. In his lectures he urged his audiences to consider the mechanics of his experiments: &quot;you know very well that ice floats upon water ... Why does the ice float? Think of that, and philosophise&quot;. The subjects in his lectures consisted of Chemistry and Electricity, and included: 1841: &quot;The Rudiments of Chemistry&quot;, 1843: &quot;First Principles of Electricity&quot;, 1848: &quot;The Chemical History of a Candle&quot;, 1851: &quot;Attractive Forces&quot;, 1853: &quot;Voltaic Electricity&quot;, 1854: &quot;The Chemistry of Combustion&quot;, 1855: &quot;The Distinctive Properties of the Common Metals&quot;, 1857: &quot;Static Electricity&quot;, 1858: &quot;The Metallic Properties&quot;, 1859: &quot;The Various Forces of Matter and their Relations to Each Other&quot;.

==Commemorations==

A statue of Michael Faraday stands in Savoy Place, London, outside the Institution of Engineering and Technology. The Faraday Memorial, designed by brutalist architect Rodney Gordon and completed in 1961, is at the Elephant &amp; Castle gyratory system, near Faraday&#x27;s birthplace at Newington Butts, London. Faraday School is located on Trinity Buoy Wharf where his workshop still stands above the Chain and Buoy Store, next to London&#x27;s only lighthouse. Faraday Gardens is a small park in Walworth, London, not far from his birthplace at Newington Butts. It lies within the local council ward of Faraday in the London Borough of Southwark. Michael Faraday Primary school is situated on the Aylesbury Estate in Walworth.

A building at London South Bank University, which houses the institute&#x27;s electrical engineering departments is named the Faraday Wing, due to its proximity to Faraday&#x27;s birthplace in Newington Butts. A hall at Loughborough University was named after Faraday in 1960. Near the entrance to its dining hall is a bronze casting, which depicts the symbol of an electrical transformer, and inside there hangs a portrait, both in Faraday&#x27;s honour. An eight-storey building at the University of Edinburgh&#x27;s science &amp; engineering campus is named for Faraday, as is a recently built hall of accommodation at Brunel University, the main engineering building at Swansea University, and the instructional and experimental physics building at Northern Illinois University. The former UK Faraday Station in Antarctica was named after him.
Streets named for Faraday can be found in many British cities (e.g., London, Glenrothes, Swindon, Basingstoke, Nottingham, Whitby, Kirkby, Crawley, Newbury, Swansea, Aylesbury and Stevenage) as well as in France (Paris), Germany (Berlin-Dahlem, Hermsdorf), Canada (Quebec City, Quebec; Deep River, Ontario; Ottawa, Ontario), the United States (The Bronx, New York and Reston, Virginia), Australia (Carlton, Victoria), and New Zealand (Hawke&#x27;s Bay).
A Royal Society of Arts blue plaque, unveiled in 1876, commemorates Faraday at 48 Blandford Street in London&#x27;s Marylebone district. From 1991 until 2001, Faraday&#x27;s picture featured on the reverse of Series E £20 banknotes issued by the Bank of England. He was portrayed conducting a lecture at the Royal Institution with the magneto-electric spark apparatus. In 2002, Faraday was ranked number 22 in the BBC&#x27;s list of the 100 Greatest Britons following a UK-wide vote.

Faraday has been commemorated on postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail. In 1991, as a pioneer of electricity he featured in their Scientific Achievements issue along with pioneers in three other fields (Charles Babbage (computing), Frank Whittle (jet engine) and Robert Watson-Watt (radar)). In 1999, under the title &quot;Faraday&#x27;s Electricity&quot;, he featured in their World Changers issue along with Charles Darwin, Edward Jenner and Alan Turing.

The Faraday Institute for Science and Religion derives its name from the scientist, who saw his faith as integral to his scientific research. The logo of the institute is also based on Faraday&#x27;s discoveries. It was created in 2006 by a $2,000,000 grant from the John Templeton Foundation to carry out academic research, to foster understanding of the interaction between science and religion, and to engage public understanding in both these subject areas.

The Faraday Institution, an independent energy storage research institute established in 2017, also derives its name from Michael Faraday. The organisation serves as the UK&#x27;s primary research programme to advance battery science and technology, education, public engagement and market research.

Faraday&#x27;s life and contributions to electromagnetics was the principal topic of the tenth episode, titled &quot;The Electric Boy&quot;, of the 2014 American science documentary series, &quot;&quot;, which was broadcast on Fox and the National Geographic Channel.

The writer Aldous Huxley wrote about Faraday in an essay entitled, &quot;A Night in Pietramala&quot;: &quot;He is always the natural philosopher. To discover truth is his sole aim and interest ... even if I could be Shakespeare, I think I should still choose to be Faraday.&quot; Calling Faraday her &quot;hero&quot;, in a speech to the Royal Society, Margaret Thatcher declared: &quot;The value of his work must be higher than the capitalisation of all the shares on the Stock Exchange!&quot; She borrowed his bust from the Royal Institution and had it placed in the hall of 10 Downing Street.

<doc id="19728" wikidata="Q8445" url="?curid=19728" title="Marriage">
<text>Marriage, also called matrimony or wedlock, is a culturally and often legally recognised union between people called spouses. It establishes rights and obligations between them, as well as between them and their children (if any), and between them and their in-laws. It is nearly a cultural universal, but the definition of marriage varies between cultures and religions, and over time. Typically, it is an institution in which interpersonal relationships, usually sexual, are acknowledged or sanctioned. In some cultures, marriage is recommended or considered to be compulsory before pursuing sexual activity. A marriage ceremony is called a wedding, while a private marriage is sometimes called an elopement.

Around the world, there has been a general trend towards ensuring equal rights for women and ending discrimination and harassment against couples who are interethnic, interracial, interfaith, interdenominational, interclass, intercommunity, transnational, and same-sex as well as immigrant couples, couples with an immigrant spouse, and other minority couples. Debates persist regarding the legal status of married women, leniency towards violence within marriage, customs such as dowry and bride price, marriageable age, and criminalization of premarital and extramarital sex. Individuals may marry for several reasons, including legal, social, libidinal, emotional, financial, spiritual, cultural, economic, political, religious, sexual, and romantic purposes. In some areas of the world, arranged marriage, forced marriage, polygyny marriage, polyandry marriage, group marriage, coverture marriage, child marriage, cousin marriage, sibling marriage, teenage marriage, avunculate marriage, incestuous marriage, and bestiality marriage are practiced and legally permissible, while others areas outlaw them to protect human rights. Female age at marriage has proven to be a strong indicator for female autonomy and is continuously used by economic history research.

Marriage can be recognized by a state, an organization, a religious authority, a tribal group, a local community, or peers. It is often viewed as a contract. A religious marriage ceremony is performed by a religious institution to recognize and create the rights and obligations intrinsic to matrimony in that religion. Religious marriage is known variously as &quot;sacramental marriage&quot; in Christianity (especially Catholicism), &quot;nikah&quot; in Islam, &quot;nissuin&quot; in Judaism, and various other names in other faith traditions, each with their own constraints as to what constitutes, and who can enter into, a valid religious marriage.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;marriage&quot; appeared around 1300 and is borrowed from Old French (12th century), ultimately tracing to the Latin &#x27;married&#x27;, past participle of &#x27;to marry&#x27;. The adjective &#x27; &#x27;matrimonial, nuptial&#x27; could also be used, through nominalization, in the masculine form as a noun for &#x27;husband&#x27; and in the feminine form for &#x27;wife&#x27;. The related word &quot;matrimony&quot; is borrowed from the Old French word &#x27;, which appears around 1300 CE and is in turn ultimately a learned borrowing from Latin &#x27;, which is derived from &#x27; &#x27;mother&#x27; with the suffix for an action, state, or condition.

==Definitions==
Anthropologists have proposed several competing definitions of marriage in an attempt to encompass the wide variety of marital practices observed across cultures. Even within Western culture, &quot;definitions of marriage have careened from one extreme to another and everywhere in between&quot; (as Evan Gerstmann has put it).

===Relation recognized by custom or law===
In &quot;The History of Human Marriage&quot; (1891), Edvard Westermarck defined marriage as &quot;a more or less durable connection between male and female lasting beyond the mere act of propagation till after the birth of the offspring.&quot; In &quot;The Future of Marriage in Western Civilization&quot; (1936), he rejected his earlier definition, instead provisionally defining marriage as &quot;a relation of one or more men to one or more women that is recognized by custom or law&quot;.

===Legitimacy of offspring===
The anthropological handbook &quot;Notes and Queries&quot; (1951) defined marriage as &quot;a union between a man and a woman such that children born to the woman are the recognized legitimate offspring of both partners.&quot; In recognition of a practice by the Nuer people of Sudan allowing women to act as a husband in certain circumstances (the ghost marriage), Kathleen Gough suggested modifying this to &quot;a woman and one or more other persons.&quot;

In an analysis of marriage among the Nayar, a polyandrous society in India, Gough found that the group lacked a husband role in the conventional sense. The husband role, unitary in the west, was instead divided between a non-resident &quot;social father&quot; of the woman&#x27;s children, and her lovers, who were the actual procreators. None of these men had legal rights to the woman&#x27;s child. This forced Gough to disregard sexual access as a key element of marriage and to define it in terms of legitimacy of offspring alone.

Economic anthropologist Duran Bell has criticized the legitimacy-based definition on the basis that some societies do not require marriage for legitimacy. He argued that a legitimacy-based definition of marriage is circular in societies where illegitimacy has no other legal or social implications for a child other than the mother being unmarried.

===Collection of rights===
Edmund Leach criticized Gough&#x27;s definition for being too restrictive in terms of recognized legitimate offspring and suggested that marriage be viewed in terms of the different types of rights it serves to establish. In a 1955 article in &quot;Man&quot;, Leach argued that no one definition of marriage applied to all cultures. He offered a list of ten rights associated with marriage, including sexual monopoly and rights with respect to children, with specific rights differing across cultures. Those rights, according to Leach, included:
# &quot;To establish a legal father of a woman&#x27;s children.

===Right of sexual access===
In a 1997 article in &quot;Current Anthropology&quot;, Duran Bell describes marriage as &quot;a relationship between one or more men (male or female) in severalty to one or more women that provides those men with a demand-right of sexual access within a domestic group and identifies women who bear the obligation of yielding to the demands of those specific men.&quot; In referring to &quot;men in severalty&quot;, Bell is referring to corporate kin groups such as lineages which, in having paid bride price, retain a right in a woman&#x27;s offspring even if her husband (a lineage member) deceases (Levirate marriage). In referring to &quot;men (male or female)&quot;, Bell is referring to women within the lineage who may stand in as the &quot;social fathers&quot; of the wife&#x27;s children born of other lovers. (See Nuer &quot;ghost marriage&quot;.)

==Types==
===Monogamy===

Monogamy is a form of marriage in which an individual has only one spouse during their lifetime or at any one time (serial monogamy).

Anthropologist Jack Goody&#x27;s comparative study of marriage around the world utilizing the Ethnographic Atlas found a strong correlation between intensive plough agriculture, dowry and monogamy. This pattern was found in a broad swath of Eurasian societies from Japan to Ireland. The majority of Sub-Saharan African societies that practice extensive hoe agriculture, in contrast, show a correlation between &quot;bride price&quot; and polygamy. A further study drawing on the Ethnographic Atlas showed a statistical correlation between increasing size of the society, the belief in &quot;high gods&quot; to support human morality, and monogamy.

In the countries which do not permit polygamy, a person who marries in one of those countries a person while still being lawfully married to another commits the crime of bigamy. In all cases, the second marriage is considered legally null and void. Besides the second and subsequent marriages being void, the bigamist is also liable to other penalties, which also vary between jurisdictions.

====Serial monogamy====
Governments that support monogamy may allow easy divorce. In a number of Western countries, divorce rates approach 50%. Those who remarry do so usually no more than three times. Divorce and remarriage can thus result in &quot;serial monogamy&quot;, i.e. having multiple marriages but only one legal spouse at a time. This can be interpreted as a form of plural mating, as are those societies dominated by female-headed families in the Caribbean, Mauritius and Brazil where there is frequent rotation of unmarried partners. In all, these account for 16 to 24% of the &quot;monogamous&quot; category.

Serial monogamy creates a new kind of relative, the &quot;ex-&quot;. The &quot;ex-wife&quot;, for example, may remain an active part of her &quot;ex-husband&#x27;s&quot; or &quot;ex-wife&#x27;s&quot; life, as they may be tied together by transfers of resources (alimony, child support), or shared child custody.

===Polygamy===
Polygamy is a marriage which includes more than two spouses. When a man is married to more than one wife at a time, the relationship is called polygyny, and there is no marriage bond between the wives; and when a woman is married to more than one husband at a time, it is called polyandry, and there is no marriage bond between the husbands. If a marriage includes multiple husbands or wives, it can be called group marriage.

A molecular genetic study of global human genetic diversity argued that sexual polygyny was typical of human reproductive patterns until the shift to sedentary farming communities approximately 10,000 to 5,000 years ago in Europe and Asia, and more recently in Africa and the Americas. As noted above, Anthropologist Jack Goody&#x27;s comparative study of marriage around the world utilizing the Ethnographic Atlas found that the majority of Sub-Saharan African societies that practice extensive hoe agriculture show a correlation between &quot;Bride price&quot; and polygamy. A survey of other cross-cultural samples has confirmed that the absence of the plough was the only predictor of polygamy, although other factors such as high male mortality in warfare (in non-state societies) and pathogen stress (in state societies) had some impact.

Marriages are classified according to the number of legal spouses an individual has. The suffix &quot;-gamy&quot; refers specifically to the number of spouses, as in bi-gamy (two spouses, generally illegal in most nations), and poly-gamy (more than one spouse).

Societies show variable acceptance of polygamy as a cultural ideal and practice. According to the Ethnographic Atlas, of 1,231 societies noted, 186 were monogamous; 453 had occasional polygyny; 588 had more frequent polygyny, and 4 had polyandry. However, as Miriam Zeitzen writes, social tolerance for polygamy is different from the practice of polygamy, since it requires wealth to establish multiple households for multiple wives. The actual practice of polygamy in a tolerant society may actually be low, with the majority of aspirant polygamists practicing monogamous marriage. Tracking the occurrence of polygamy is further complicated in jurisdictions where it has been banned, but continues to be practiced (&quot;de facto polygamy&quot;).

Zeitzen also notes that Western perceptions of African society and marriage patterns are biased by &quot;contradictory concerns of nostalgia for traditional African culture versus critique of polygamy as oppressive to women or detrimental to development.&quot; Polygamy has been condemned as being a form of human rights abuse, with concerns arising over domestic abuse, forced marriage, and neglect. The vast majority of countries do not permit polygamy.

====Polygyny====
Polygyny usually grants wives equal status, although the husband may have personal preferences. One type of de facto polygyny is concubinage, where only one woman gets a wife&#x27;s rights and status, while other women remain legal house mistresses.

Although a society may be classified as polygynous, not all marriages in it necessarily are; monogamous marriages may in fact predominate. It is to this flexibility that Anthropologist Robin Fox attributes its success as a social support system: This has often meant – given the imbalance in the sex ratios, the higher male infant mortality, the shorter life span of males, the loss of males in wartime, etc. – that often women were left without financial support from husbands. To correct this condition, females had to be killed at birth, remain single, become prostitutes, or be siphoned off into celibate religious orders. Polygynous systems have the advantage that they can promise, as did the Mormons, a home and family for every woman.

Nonetheless, polygyny is a gender issue which offers men asymmetrical benefits. In some cases, there is a large age discrepancy (as much as a generation) between a man and his youngest wife, compounding the power differential between the two. Tensions not only exist &quot;between&quot; genders, but also &quot;within&quot; genders; senior and junior men compete for wives, and senior and junior wives in the same household may experience radically different life conditions, and internal hierarchy. Several studies have suggested that the wive&#x27;s relationship with other women, including co-wives and husband&#x27;s female kin, are more critical relationships than that with her husband for her productive, reproductive and personal achievement. In some societies, the co-wives are relatives, usually sisters, a practice called &quot;sororal polygyny&quot;; the pre-existing relationship between the co-wives is thought to decrease potential tensions within the marriage.

Fox argues that &quot;the major difference between polygyny and monogamy could be stated thus: while plural mating occurs in both systems, under polygyny several unions may be recognized as being legal marriages while under monogamy only one of the unions is so recognized. Often, however, it is difficult to draw a hard and fast line between the two.&quot;

As polygamy in Africa is increasingly subject to legal limitations, a variant form of &quot;de facto&quot; (as opposed to legal or &quot;de jure&quot;) polygyny is being practiced in urban centers. Although it does not involve multiple (now illegal) formal marriages, the domestic and personal arrangements follow old polygynous patterns. The de facto form of polygyny is found in other parts of the world as well (including some Mormon sects and Muslim families in the United States).
In some societies such as the Lovedu of South Africa, or the Nuer of the Sudan, aristocratic women may become female &#x27;husbands.&#x27; In the Lovedu case, this female husband may take a number of polygamous wives. This is not a lesbian relationship, but a means of legitimately expanding a royal lineage by attaching these wives&#x27; children to it. The relationships are considered polygynous, not polyandrous, because the female husband is in fact assuming masculine gendered political roles.

Religious groups have differing views on the legitimacy of polygyny. It is allowed in Islam and Confucianism. Judaism and Christianity have mentioned practices involving polygyny in the past, however, outright religious acceptance of such practices was not addressed until its rejection in later passages. They do explicitly prohibit polygyny today.

====Polyandry====
Polyandry is notably more rare than polygyny, though less rare than the figure commonly cited in the &quot;Ethnographic Atlas&quot; (1980) which listed only those polyandrous societies found in the Himalayan Mountains. More recent studies have found 53 societies outside the 28 found in the Himalayans which practice polyandry. It is most common in egalitarian societies marked by high male mortality or male absenteeism. It is associated with &quot;partible paternity&quot;, the cultural belief that a child can have more than one father.

The explanation for polyandry in the Himalayan Mountains is related to the scarcity of land; the marriage of all brothers in a family to the same wife (&quot;fraternal polyandry&quot;) allows family land to remain intact and undivided. If every brother married separately and had children, family land would be split into unsustainable small plots. In Europe, this was prevented through the social practice of impartible inheritance (the dis-inheriting of most siblings, some of whom went on to become celibate monks and priests).

====Plural marriage====
Group marriage (also known as &quot;multi-lateral marriage&quot;) is a form of polyamory in which more than two persons form a family unit, with all the members of the group marriage being considered to be married to all the other members of the group marriage, and all members of the marriage share parental responsibility for any children arising from the marriage. No country legally condones group marriages, neither under the law nor as a common law marriage, but historically it has been practiced by some cultures of Polynesia, Asia, Papua New Guinea and the Americas – as well as in some intentional communities and alternative subcultures such as the Oneida Perfectionists in up-state New York. Of the 250 societies reported by the American anthropologist George Murdock in 1949, only the Kaingang of Brazil had any group marriages at all.

===Child marriage===

A child marriage is a marriage where one or both spouses are under the age of 18. It is related to child betrothal and teenage pregnancy.

Child marriage was common throughout history, even up until the 1900s in the United States, where in 1880 CE, in the state of Delaware, the age of consent for marriage was 7 years old. Still, in 2017, over half of the 50 United States have no explicit minimum age to marry and several states set the age as low as 14. Today it is condemned by international human rights organizations. Child marriages are often arranged between the families of the future bride and groom, sometimes as soon as the girl is born. However, in the late 1800s in England and the United States, feminist activists began calling for raised age of consent laws, which was eventually handled in the 1920s, having been raised to 16–18.

Child marriages can also occur in the context of bride kidnapping.

While child marriage is observed for both boys and girls, the overwhelming majority of child spouses are girls. In many cases, only one marriage-partner is a child, usually the female, due to the importance placed upon female virginity. Causes of child marriage include poverty, bride price, dowry, laws that allow child marriages, religious and social pressures, regional customs, fear of remaining unmarried, and perceived inability of women to work for money.

Today, child marriages are widespread in parts of the world; being most common in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, with more than half of the girls in some countries in those regions being married before 18. The incidence of child marriage has been falling in most parts of the world. In developed countries, child marriage is outlawed or restricted.

Girls who marry before 18 are at greater risk of becoming victims of domestic violence, than those who marry later, especially when they are married to a much older man.

===Same-sex and third-gender marriages===
Several kinds of same-sex marriages have been documented in Indigenous and lineage-based cultures. In the Americas, We&#x27;wha (Zuni), was a &quot;lhamana&quot; (male individuals who, at least some of the time, dress and live in the roles usually filled by women in that culture); a respected artist, We&#x27;wha served as an emissary of the Zuni to Washington, where he met President Grover Cleveland. We&#x27;wha had at least one husband who was generally recognized as such.

While it is a relatively new practice to grant same-sex couples the same form of legal marital recognition as commonly granted to mixed-sex couples, there is some history of recorded same-sex unions around the world. Ancient Greek same-sex relationships were like modern companionate marriages, unlike their different-sex marriages in which the spouses had few emotional ties, and the husband had freedom to engage in outside sexual liaisons. The Codex Theodosianus (&quot;C. Th.&quot; 9.7.3) issued in 438 CE imposed severe penalties or death on same-sex relationships, but the exact intent of the law and its relation to social practice is unclear, as only a few examples of same-sex relationships in that culture exist. Same-sex unions were celebrated in some regions of China, such as Fujian. Possibly the earliest documented same-sex wedding in Latin Christendom occurred in Rome, Italy, at the San Giovanni a Porta Latina basilica in 1581.

===Temporary marriages===
Several cultures have practised temporary and conditional marriages. Examples include the Celtic practice of handfasting and fixed-term marriages in the Muslim community. Pre-Islamic Arabs practiced a form of temporary marriage that carries on today in the practice of Nikah mut&#x27;ah, a fixed-term marriage contract. The Islamic prophet Muhammad sanctioned a temporary marriage – sigheh in Iran and muta&#x27;a in Iraq – which can provide a legitimizing cover for sex workers. The same forms of temporary marriage have been used in Egypt, Lebanon and Iran to make the donation of a human ova legal for in vitro fertilisation; a woman cannot, however, use this kind of marriage to obtain a sperm donation. Muslim controversies related to Nikah Mut&#x27;ah have resulted in the practice being confined mostly to Shi&#x27;ite communities. The matrilineal Mosuo of China practice what they call &quot;walking marriage&quot;.

===Cohabitation===

In some jurisdictions cohabitation, in certain circumstances, may constitute a common-law marriage, an unregistered partnership, or otherwise provide the unmarried partners with various rights and responsibilities; and in some countries, the laws recognize cohabitation in lieu of institutional marriage for taxation and social security benefits. This is the case, for example, in Australia. Cohabitation may be an option pursued as a form of resistance to traditional institutionalized marriage. However, in this context, some nations reserve the right to define the relationship as marital, or otherwise to regulate the relation, even if the relation has not been registered with the state or a religious institution.

Conversely, institutionalized marriages may not involve cohabitation. In some cases, couples living together do not wish to be recognized as married. This may occur because pension or alimony rights are adversely affected; because of taxation considerations; because of immigration issues, or for other reasons. Such marriages have also been increasingly common in Beijing. Guo Jianmei, director of the center for women&#x27;s studies at Beijing University, told a Newsday correspondent, &quot;Walking marriages reflect sweeping changes in Chinese society.&quot; A &quot;walking marriage&quot; refers to a type of temporary marriage formed by the Mosuo of China, in which male partners live elsewhere and make nightly visits. A similar arrangement in Saudi Arabia, called misyar marriage, also involves the husband and wife living separately but meeting regularly.

==Partner selection==
There is wide cross-cultural variation in the social rules governing the selection of a partner for marriage. There is variation in the degree to which partner selection is an individual decision by the partners or a collective decision by the partners&#x27; kin groups, and there is variation in the rules regulating which partners are valid choices.

The United Nations World Fertility Report of 2003 reports that 89% of all people get married before age forty-nine. The percent of women and men who marry before age forty-nine drops to nearly 50% in some nations and reaches near 100% in other nations.

In other cultures with less strict rules governing the groups from which a partner can be chosen the selection of a marriage partner may involve either the couple going through a selection process of courtship or the marriage may be arranged by the couple&#x27;s parents or an outside party, a matchmaker.

===Age difference===
Some people want to marry a person that is older or younger than they. This may impact marital stability and partners with more than a 10-year gap in age tend to experience social disapproval In addition, older women (older than 35) have increased health risks when getting pregnant.

===Social status and wealth===
Some people want to marry a person with higher or lower status than them. Others want to marry people who have similar status. In many societies, women marry men who are of higher social status. There are marriages where each party has sought a partner of similar status. There are other marriages in which the man is older than the woman.

Some persons also wish to engage in transactional relationship for money rather than love (thus a type of marriage of convenience). Such people are sometimes referred to as gold diggers. Separate property systems can however be used to prevent property of being passed on to partners after divorce or death.

Higher income men are more likely to marry and less likely to divorce. High income women are more likely to divorce.

===Incest taboo, exogamy and endogamy===
Societies have often placed restrictions on marriage to relatives, though the degree of prohibited relationship varies widely. Marriages between parents and children, or between full siblings, with few exceptions, have been considered incest and forbidden. However, marriages between more distant relatives have been much more common, with one estimate being that 80% of all marriages in history have been between second cousins or closer. This proportion has fallen dramatically, but still, more than 10% of all marriages are believed to be between people who are second cousins or more closely related. In the United States, such marriages are now highly stigmatized, and laws ban most or all first-cousin marriage in 30 states. Specifics vary: in South Korea, historically it was illegal to marry someone with the same last name and same ancestral line.

An Avunculate marriage is a marriage that occurs between an uncle and his niece or between an aunt and her nephew. Such marriages are illegal in most countries due to incest restrictions. However, a small number of countries have legalized it, including Argentina, Australia, Austria, Malaysia, and Russia.
In various societies, the choice of partner is often limited to suitable persons from specific social groups. In some societies the rule is that a partner is selected from an individual&#x27;s own social group – endogamy, this is often the case in class- and caste-based societies. But in other societies a partner must be chosen from a different group than one&#x27;s own – exogamy, this may be the case in societies practicing totemic religion where society is divided into several exogamous totemic clans, such as most Aboriginal Australian societies. In other societies a person is expected to marry their cross-cousin, a woman must marry her father&#x27;s sister&#x27;s son and a man must marry his mother&#x27;s brother&#x27;s daughter – this is often the case if either a society has a rule of tracing kinship exclusively through patrilineal or matrilineal descent groups as among the Akan people of West Africa. Another kind of marriage selection is the levirate marriage in which widows are obligated to marry their husband&#x27;s brother, mostly found in societies where kinship is based on endogamous clan groups.

Religion has commonly weighed in on the matter of which relatives, if any, are allowed to marry. Relations may be by consanguinity or affinity, meaning by blood or by marriage. On the marriage of cousins, Catholic policy has evolved from initial acceptance, through a long period of general prohibition, to the contemporary requirement for a dispensation. Islam has always allowed it, while Hindu texts vary widely.

===Prescriptive marriage===

In a wide array of lineage-based societies with a classificatory kinship system, potential spouses are sought from a specific class of relative as determined by a prescriptive marriage rule. This rule may be expressed by anthropologists using a &quot;descriptive&quot; kinship term, such as a &quot;man&#x27;s mother&#x27;s brother&#x27;s daughter&quot; (also known as a &quot;cross-cousin&quot;). Such descriptive rules mask the participant&#x27;s perspective: a man should marry a woman from his mother&#x27;s lineage. Within the society&#x27;s kinship terminology, such relatives are usually indicated by a specific term which sets them apart as potentially marriageable. Pierre Bourdieu notes, however, that very few marriages ever follow the rule, and that when they do so, it is for &quot;practical kinship&quot; reasons such as the preservation of family property, rather than the &quot;official kinship&quot; ideology.

Insofar as regular marriages following prescriptive rules occur, lineages are linked together in fixed relationships; these ties between lineages may form political alliances in kinship dominated societies. French structural anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss developed alliance theory to account for the &quot;elementary&quot; kinship structures created by the limited number of prescriptive marriage rules possible.

A pragmatic (or &#x27;arranged&#x27;) marriage is made easier by formal procedures of family or group politics. A responsible authority sets up or encourages the marriage; they may, indeed, engage a professional matchmaker to find a suitable spouse for an unmarried person. The authority figure could be parents, family, a religious official, or a group consensus.

===Forced marriage===
A forced marriage is a marriage in which one or both of the parties is married against their will. Forced marriages continue to be practiced in parts of the world, especially in South Asia and Africa. The line between forced marriage and consensual marriage may become blurred, because the social norms of these cultures dictate that one should never oppose the desire of one&#x27;s parents/relatives in regard to the choice of a spouse; in such cultures, it is not necessary for violence, threats, intimidation etc. to occur, the person simply &quot;consents&quot; to the marriage even if they do not want it, out of the implied social pressure and duty. The customs of bride price and dowry, that exist in parts of the world, can lead to buying and selling people into marriage.

In some societies, ranging from Central Asia to the Caucasus to Africa, the custom of bride kidnapping still exists, in which a woman is captured by a man and his friends. Sometimes this covers an elopement, but sometimes it depends on sexual violence. In previous times, &quot;raptio&quot; was a larger-scale version of this, with groups of women captured by groups of men, sometimes in war; the most famous example is The Rape of the Sabine Women, which provided the first citizens of Rome with their wives.

Other marriage partners are more or less imposed on an individual. For example, widow inheritance provides a widow with another man from her late husband&#x27;s brothers.

In rural areas of India, child marriage is practiced, with parents often arranging the wedding, sometimes even before the child is born. This practice was made illegal under the Child Marriage Restraint Act of 1929.

==Economic considerations==

The financial aspects of marriage vary between cultures and have changed over time.

In some cultures, dowries and bride wealth continue to be required today. In both cases, the financial arrangements are usually made between the groom (or his family) and the bride&#x27;s family; with the bride often not being involved in the negotiations, and often not having a choice in whether to participate in the marriage.

In Early modern Britain, the social status of the couple was supposed to be equal. After the marriage, all the property (called &quot;fortune&quot;) and expected inheritances of the wife belonged to the husband.

===Dowry===
A dowry is a process whereby parental property is distributed to a daughter at her marriage (i.e. &quot;inter vivos&quot;) rather than at the holder&#x27;s death (&quot;mortis causa&quot;)… A dowry establishes some variety of conjugal fund, the nature of which may vary widely. This fund ensures her support (or endowment) in widowhood and eventually goes to provide for her sons and daughters.

In some cultures, especially in countries such as Turkey, India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Morocco, Nepal, dowries continue to be expected. In India, thousands of dowry-related deaths have taken place on yearly basis, to counter this problem, several jurisdictions have enacted laws restricting or banning dowry (see Dowry law in India). In Nepal, dowry was made illegal in 2009. Some authors believe that the giving and receiving of dowry reflects the status and even the effort to climb high in social hierarchy.

===Dower===

Direct Dowry contrasts with bride wealth, which is paid by the groom or his family to the bride&#x27;s parents, and with indirect dowry (or dower), which is property given to the bride herself by the groom at the time of marriage and which remains under her ownership and control.

In the Jewish tradition, the rabbis in ancient times insisted on the marriage couple entering into a prenuptial agreement, called a &quot;ketubah&quot;. Besides other things, the &quot;ketubah&quot; provided for an amount to be paid by the husband in the event of a divorce or his estate in the event of his death. This amount was a replacement of the biblical dower or bride price, which was payable at the time of the marriage by the groom to the father of the bride, because many young prospective husbands could not raise the bride price at the time when they would normally be expected to marry. It is the predecessor to the wife&#x27;s present-day entitlement to maintenance in the event of the breakup of marriage, and family maintenance in the event of the husband not providing adequately for the wife in his will. Another function performed by the &quot;ketubah&quot; amount was to provide a disincentive for the husband contemplating divorcing his wife.

Morning gifts, which might also be arranged by the bride&#x27;s father rather than the bride, are given to the bride herself; the name derives from the Germanic tribal custom of giving them the morning after the wedding night. She might have control of this morning gift during the lifetime of her husband, but is entitled to it when widowed. If the amount of her inheritance is settled by law rather than agreement, it may be called dower. Depending on legal systems and the exact arrangement, she may not be entitled to dispose of it after her death, and may lose the property if she remarries. Morning gifts were preserved for centuries in morganatic marriage, a union where the wife&#x27;s inferior social status was held to prohibit her children from inheriting a noble&#x27;s titles or estates. In this case, the morning gift would support the wife and children. Another legal provision for widowhood was jointure, in which property, often land, would be held in joint tenancy, so that it would automatically go to the widow on her husband&#x27;s death.

Islamic tradition has similar practices. A &#x27;mahr&#x27;, either immediate or deferred, is the woman&#x27;s portion of the groom&#x27;s wealth (divorce) or estate (death). These amounts are usually set on the basis of the groom&#x27;s own and family wealth and incomes, but in some parts these are set very high so as to provide a disincentive for the groom exercising the divorce, or the husband&#x27;s family &#x27;inheriting&#x27; a large portion of the estate, especially if there are no male offspring from the marriage. In some countries, including Iran, the mahr or alimony can amount to more than a man can ever hope to earn, sometimes up to US$1,000,000 (4000 official Iranian gold coins). If the husband cannot pay the mahr, either in case of a divorce or on demand, according to the current laws in Iran, he will have to pay it by installments. Failure to pay the mahr might even lead to imprisonment.

===Bridewealth===
Bridewealth is a common practice in parts of Southeast Asia (Thailand, Cambodia), parts of Central Asia, and in much of sub-Saharan Africa. It is also known as brideprice although this has fallen in disfavor as it implies the purchase of the bride. Bridewealth is the amount of money or property or wealth paid by the groom or his family to the parents of a woman upon the marriage of their daughter to the groom. In anthropological literature, bride price has often been explained as payment made to compensate the bride&#x27;s family for the loss of her labor and fertility. In some cases, bridewealth is a means by which the groom&#x27;s family&#x27;s ties to the children of the union are recognized.

===Taxation===
In some countries a married person or couple benefits from various taxation advantages not available to a single person. For example, spouses may be allowed to average their combined incomes. This is advantageous to a married couple with disparate incomes. To compensate for this, countries may provide a higher tax bracket for the averaged income of a married couple. While income averaging might still benefit a married couple with a stay-at-home spouse, such averaging would cause a married couple with roughly equal personal incomes to pay more total tax than they would as two single persons. In the United States, this is called the marriage penalty.

When the rates applied by the tax code are not based income averaging, but rather on the &quot;sum&quot; of individuals&#x27; incomes, higher rates will usually apply to each individual in a two-earner households in a progressive tax systems. This is most often the case with high-income taxpayers and is another situation called a marriage penalty.

Conversely, when progressive tax is levied on the individual with no consideration for the partnership, dual-income couples fare much better than single-income couples with similar household incomes. The effect can be increased when the welfare system treats the same income as a shared income thereby denying welfare access to the non-earning spouse. Such systems apply in Australia and Canada, for example.

==Post-marital residence==
In many Western cultures, marriage usually leads to the formation of a new household comprising the married couple, with the married couple living together in the same home, often sharing the same bed, but in some other cultures this is not the tradition. Among the Minangkabau of West Sumatra, residency after marriage is matrilocal, with the husband moving into the household of his wife&#x27;s mother. Residency after marriage can also be patrilocal or avunculocal. In these cases, married couples may not form an independent household, but remain part of an extended family household.

Early theories explaining the determinants of postmarital residence connected it with the sexual division of labor. However, to date, cross-cultural tests of this hypothesis using worldwide samples have failed to find any significant relationship between these two variables. However, Korotayev&#x27;s tests show that the female contribution to subsistence does correlate significantly with matrilocal residence in general. However, this correlation is masked by a general polygyny factor.

Although, in different-sex marriages, an increase in the female contribution to subsistence tends to lead to matrilocal residence, it also tends simultaneously to lead to general non-sororal polygyny which effectively destroys matrilocality. If this polygyny factor is controlled (e.g., through a multiple regression model), division of labor turns out to be a significant predictor of postmarital residence. Thus, Murdock&#x27;s hypotheses regarding the relationships between the sexual division of labor and postmarital residence were basically correct, though the actual relationships between those two groups of variables are more complicated than he expected.

There has been a trend toward the neolocal residence in western societies.

==Law==

Marriage laws refer to the legal requirements which determine the validity of a marriage, which vary considerably between countries. Article 16 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights declares that:
===Rights and obligations===
A marriage bestows rights and obligations on the married parties, and sometimes on relatives as well, being the sole mechanism for the creation of affinal ties (in-laws). These may include, depending on jurisdiction:
* Giving one spouse or his/her family control over the other spouse&#x27;s sexual services, labor, and property.
* Giving one spouse responsibility for the other&#x27;s debts.
* Giving one spouse visitation rights when the other is incarcerated or hospitalized.
* Giving one spouse control over the other&#x27;s affairs when the other is incapacitated.
* Establishing the second legal guardian of a parent&#x27;s child.
* Establishing a joint fund of property for the benefit of children.
* Establishing a relationship between the families of the spouses.

These rights and obligations vary considerably between societies, and between groups within society. These might include arranged marriages, family obligations, the legal establishment of a nuclear family unit, the legal protection of children and public declaration of commitment.

===Property regime===
In many countries today, each marriage partner has the choice of keeping his or her property separate or combining properties. In the latter case, called community property, when the marriage ends by divorce each owns half. In lieu of a will or trust, property owned by the deceased generally is inherited by the surviving spouse.

In some legal systems, the partners in a marriage are &quot;jointly liable&quot; for the debts of the marriage. This has a basis in a traditional legal notion called the &quot;Doctrine of Necessities&quot; whereby, in a heterosexual marriage, a husband was responsible to provide necessary things for his wife. Where this is the case, one partner may be sued to collect a debt for which they did not expressly contract. Critics of this practice note that debt collection agencies can abuse this by claiming an unreasonably wide range of debts to be expenses of the marriage. The cost of defense and the burden of proof is then placed on the non-contracting party to prove that the expense is not a debt of the family. The respective maintenance obligations, both during and eventually after a marriage, are regulated in most jurisdictions; alimony is one such method.

===Restrictions===
Marriage is an institution that is historically filled with restrictions. From age, to race, to social status, to consanguinity, to gender, restrictions are placed on marriage by society for reasons of benefiting the children, passing on healthy genes, maintaining cultural values, or because of prejudice and fear. Almost all cultures that recognize marriage also recognize adultery as a violation of the terms of marriage.

====Age====
Most jurisdictions set a minimum age for marriage; that is, a person must attain a certain age to be legally allowed to marry. This age may depend on circumstances, for instance exceptions from the general rule may be permitted if the parents of a young person express their consent and/or if a court decides that said marriage is in the best interest of the young person (often this applies in cases where a girl is pregnant). Although most age restrictions are in place in order to prevent children from being forced into marriages, especially to much older partners – marriages which can have negative education and health related consequences, and lead to child sexual abuse and other forms of violence – such child marriages remain common in parts of the world. According to the UN, child marriages are most common in rural sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. The ten countries with the highest rates of child marriage are: Niger (75%), Chad, Central African Republic, Bangladesh, Guinea, Mozambique, Mali, Burkina Faso, South Sudan, and Malawi.

====Kinship====
To prohibit incest and eugenic reasons, marriage laws have set restrictions for relatives to marry. Direct blood relatives are usually prohibited to marry, while for branch line relatives, laws are wary.

Kinship relations through marriage is also called &quot;affinity&quot;, relationships that arise in one&#x27;s group of origin, can also be called one&#x27;s descent group. Some cultures in kinship relationships may be considered to extend out to those who they have economic or political relationships with; or other forms of social connections. Within some cultures they may lead you back to gods or animal ancestors (totems). This can be conceived of on a more or less literal basis.

====Race====
Laws banning &quot;race-mixing&quot; were enforced in certain North American jurisdictions from 1691 until 1967, in Nazi Germany (the Nuremberg Laws) from 1935 until 1945, and in South Africa during most part of the apartheid era (1949–1985). All these laws primarily banned marriage between persons of different racially or ethnically defined groups, which was termed &quot;amalgamation&quot; or &quot;miscegenation&quot; in the U.S. The laws in Nazi Germany and many of the U.S. states, as well as South Africa, also banned sexual relations between such individuals.

In the United States, laws in some but not all of the states prohibited the marriage of whites and blacks, and in many states also the intermarriage of whites with Native Americans or Asians. In the U.S., such laws were known as anti-miscegenation laws. From 1913 until 1948, 30 out of the then 48 states enforced such laws. Although an &quot;Anti-Miscegenation Amendment&quot; to the United States Constitution was proposed in 1871, in 1912–1913, and in 1928, no nationwide law against racially mixed marriages was ever enacted. In 1967, the Supreme Court of the United States unanimously ruled in &quot;Loving v. Virginia&quot; that anti-miscegenation laws are unconstitutional. With this ruling, these laws were no longer in effect in the remaining 16 states that still had them.

The Nazi ban on interracial marriage and interracial sex was enacted in September 1935 as part of the Nuremberg Laws, the &quot;Gesetz zum Schutze des deutschen Blutes und der deutschen Ehre&quot; (The Law for the Protection of German Blood and German Honour). The Nuremberg Laws classified Jews as a race and forbade marriage and extramarital sexual relations at first with people of Jewish descent, but was later ended to the &quot;Gypsies, Negroes or their bastard offspring&quot; and people of &quot;German or related blood&quot;. Such relations were marked as &quot;Rassenschande&quot; (lit. &quot;race-disgrace&quot;) and could be punished by imprisonment (usually followed by deportation to a concentration camp) and even by death.

In South Africa, the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act, 1949 prohibited marriage between persons of different races, and the Immorality Act of 1950 made sexual relations with a person of a different race a crime.

====Sex====
Same-sex marriage is legally performed and recognized in countries such as Andorra, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Denmark, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Uruguay. Israel recognizes same-sex marriages entered into abroad as full marriages.

The introduction of same-sex marriage has varied by jurisdiction, being variously accomplished through legislative change to marriage law, a court ruling based on constitutional guarantees of equality, or by direct popular vote (via ballot initiative or referendum). The recognition of same-sex marriage is considered to be a human right and a civil right as well as a political, social, and religious issue. The most prominent supporters of same-sex marriage are human rights and civil rights organizations as well as the medical and scientific communities, while the most prominent opponents are religious groups. Various faith communities around the world support same-sex marriage, while many religious groups oppose it. Polls consistently show continually rising support for the recognition of same-sex marriage in all developed democracies and in some developing democracies.

The establishment of recognition in law for the marriages of same-sex couples is one of the most prominent objectives of the LGBT rights movement.

====Number of spouses====
Polygyny is widely practiced in mostly Muslim and African countries. In the Middle Eastern region, Israel, Turkey and Tunisia are notable exceptions.

In most other jurisdictions, polygamy is illegal. For example, In the United States, polygamy is illegal in all 50 states.

In the late-19th century, citizens of the self-governing territory of what is present-day Utah were forced by the United States federal government to abandon the practice of polygamy through the vigorous enforcement of several Acts of Congress, and eventually complied. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints formally abolished the practice in 1890, in a document labeled &#x27;The Manifesto&#x27; (see Latter Day Saint polygamy in the late-19th century). Among American Muslims, a small minority of around 50,000 to 100,000 people are estimated to live in families with a husband maintaining an illegal polygamous relationship.

Several countries such as India and Sri Lanka, permit only their Islamic citizens to practice polygamy. Some Indians have converted to Islam in order to bypass such legal restrictions. Predominantly Christian nations usually do not allow polygamous unions, with a handful of exceptions being the Republic of the Congo, Uganda, and Zambia.

===State recognition===
When a marriage is performed and carried out by a government institution in accordance with the marriage laws of the jurisdiction, without religious content, it is a civil marriage. Civil marriage recognizes and creates the rights and obligations intrinsic to matrimony in the eyes of the state. Some countries do not recognize locally performed religious marriage on its own, and require a separate civil marriage for official purposes. Conversely, civil marriage does not exist in some countries governed by a religious legal system, such as Saudi Arabia, where marriages contracted abroad might not be recognized if they were contracted contrary to Saudi interpretations of Islamic religious law. In countries governed by a mixed secular-religious legal system, such as Lebanon and Israel, locally performed civil marriage does not exist within the country, which prevents interfaith and various other marriages that contradict religious laws from being entered into in the country; however, civil marriages performed abroad may be recognized by the state even if they conflict with religious laws. For example, in the case of recognition of marriage in Israel, this includes recognition of not only interfaith civil marriages performed abroad, but also overseas same-sex civil marriages.

In various jurisdictions, a civil marriage may take place as part of the religious marriage ceremony, although they are theoretically distinct. Some jurisdictions allow civil marriages in circumstances which are notably not allowed by particular religions, such as same-sex marriages or civil unions. Churches may have less strict limits than the civil jurisdictions. It is possible for two people to be recognized as married by a religious or other institution, but not by the state, and hence without the legal rights and obligations of marriage; or to have a civil marriage deemed invalid and sinful by a religion. Similarly, a couple may remain married in religious eyes after a civil divorce.

Most sovereign states and other jurisdictions limit legally recognized marriage to opposite-sex couples and a diminishing number of these permit polygyny marriage, polyandry marriage, group marriage, coverture marriage, arranged marriages, forced marriages, child marriages, cousin marriages, sibling marriages, teenage marriages, avunculate marriages, incestuous marriages, and bestiality marriages. In modern times, a growing number of countries, primarily developed democracies, have lifted bans on, and have established legal recognition for, equal rights for women and the marriages of interethnic, interracial, interfaith, interdenominational, interclass, intercommunity, transnational, and same-sex couples as well as immigrant couples, couples with an immigrant spouse, and other minority couples. In some areas, child marriages and polygamy may occur in spite of national laws against the practice.

====Marriage license, civil ceremony and registration====

A marriage is usually formalized at a wedding or marriage ceremony. The ceremony may be officiated either by a religious official, by a government official or by a state approved celebrant. In various European and Latin American countries, any religious ceremony must be held separately from the required civil ceremony. Some countries – such as Belgium, Bulgaria, France, the Netherlands, Romania and Turkey – require that a civil ceremony take place before any religious one. In some countries – notably the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Norway, and Spain – both ceremonies can be held together; the officiant at the religious and civil ceremony also serving as agent of the state to perform the civil ceremony. To avoid any implication that the state is &quot;recognizing&quot; a religious marriage (which is prohibited in some countries) – the &quot;civil&quot; ceremony is said to be taking place at the same time as the religious ceremony. Often this involves simply signing a register during the religious ceremony. If the civil element of the religious ceremony is omitted, the marriage ceremony is not recognized as a marriage by government under the law.

Some countries, such as Australia, permit marriages to be held in private and at any location; others, including England and Wales, require that the civil ceremony be conducted in a place open to the public and specially sanctioned by law for the purpose. In England, the place of marriage formerly had to be a church or register office, but this was extended to any public venue with the necessary licence. An exception can be made in the case of marriage by special emergency license (UK: licence), which is normally granted only when one of the parties is terminally ill. Rules about where and when persons can marry vary from place to place. Some regulations require one of the parties to reside within the jurisdiction of the register office (formerly parish).

Each religious authority has rules for the manner in which marriages are to be conducted by their officials and members. Where religious marriages are recognised by the state, the officiator must also conform with the law of the jurisdiction.

====Common-law marriage====
In a small number of jurisdictions marriage relationships may be created by the operation of the law alone. Unlike the typical ceremonial marriage with legal contract, wedding ceremony, and other details, a common-law marriage may be called &quot;marriage by habit and repute (cohabitation).&quot; A de facto common-law marriage without a license or ceremony is legally binding in some jurisdictions but has no legal consequence in others.

====Civil unions====

A &quot;civil union&quot;, also referred to as a &quot;civil partnership&quot;, is a legally recognized form of partnership similar to marriage. Beginning with Denmark in 1989, civil unions under one name or another have been established by law in several countries in order to provide same-sex couples rights, benefits, and responsibilities similar (in some countries, identical) to opposite-sex civil marriage. In some jurisdictions, such as Brazil, New Zealand, Uruguay, Ecuador, France and the U.S. states of Hawaii and Illinois, civil unions are also open to opposite-sex couples.

====&quot;Marriage of convenience&quot;====
Sometimes people marry to take advantage of a certain situation, sometimes called a marriage of convenience or a sham marriage. In 2003, over 180,000 immigrants were admitted to the U.S. as spouses of U.S. citizens; more were admitted as fiancés of US citizens for the purpose of being married within 90 days. These marriages had a diverse range of motives, including obtaining permanent residency, securing an inheritance that has a marriage clause, or to enroll in health insurance, among many others. While all marriages have a complex combination of conveniences motivating the parties to marry, a marriage of convenience is one that is devoid of normal reasons to marry. In certain countries like Singapore sham marriages are punishable criminal offences.

===Contemporary legal and human rights criticisms of marriage===

People have proposed arguments against marriage for reasons that include political, philosophical and religious criticisms; concerns about the divorce rate; individual liberty and gender equality; questioning the necessity of having a personal relationship sanctioned by government or religious authorities; or the promotion of celibacy for religious or philosophical reasons. Research has found that unhappily married couples are at 3–25 times the risk of developing clinical depression.

====Power and gender roles====
Historically, in most cultures, married women had very few rights of their own, being considered, along with the family&#x27;s children, the property of the husband; as such, they could not own or inherit property, or represent themselves legally (see, for example, coverture). Since the late 19th century, in some (primarily Western) countries, marriage has undergone gradual legal changes, aimed at improving the rights of the wife. These changes included giving wives legal identities of their own, abolishing the right of husbands to physically discipline their wives, giving wives property rights, liberalizing divorce laws, providing wives with reproductive rights of their own, and requiring a wife&#x27;s consent when sexual relations occur. In the 21st century, there continue to be controversies regarding the legal status of married women, legal acceptance of or leniency towards violence within marriage (especially sexual violence), traditional marriage customs such as dowry and bride price, forced marriage, marriageable age, and criminalization of consensual behaviors such as premarital and extramarital sex.

Feminist theory approaches opposite-sex marriage as an institution traditionally rooted in patriarchy that promotes male superiority and power over women. This power dynamic conceptualizes men as &quot;the provider operating in the public sphere&quot; and women as &quot;the caregivers operating within the private sphere&quot;. &quot;Theoretically, women ... [were] defined as the property of their husbands ... The adultery of a woman was always treated with more severity than that of a man.&quot; &quot;[F]eminist demands for a wife&#x27;s control over her own property were not met [in parts of Britain] until ... [laws were passed in the late 19th century].&quot;

Traditional heterosexual marriage imposed an obligation of the wife to be sexually available for her husband and an obligation of the husband to provide material/financial support for the wife. Numerous philosophers, feminists and other academic figures have commented on this throughout history, condemning the hypocrisy of legal and religious authorities in regard to sexual issues; pointing to the lack of choice of a woman in regard to controlling her own sexuality; and drawing parallels between marriage, an institution promoted as sacred, and prostitution, widely condemned and vilified (though often tolerated as a &quot;necessary evil&quot;). Mary Wollstonecraft, in the 18th century, described marriage as &quot;legal prostitution&quot;. Bertrand Russell in his book &quot;Marriage and Morals&quot; wrote that: &quot;Marriage is for woman the commonest mode of livelihood, and the total amount of undesired sex endured by women is probably greater in marriage than in prostitution.&quot; Angela Carter in &quot;Nights at the Circus&quot; wrote: &quot;What is marriage but prostitution to one man instead of many?&quot;

Some critics object to what they see as propaganda in relation to marriage – from the government, religious organizations, the media – which aggressively promote marriage as a solution for all social problems; such propaganda includes, for instance, marriage promotion in schools, where children, especially girls, are bombarded with positive information about marriage, being presented only with the information prepared by authorities.

The performance of dominant gender roles by men and submissive gender roles by women influence the power dynamic of a heterosexual marriage. In some American households, women internalize gender role stereotypes and often assimilate into the role of &quot;wife&quot;, &quot;mother&quot;, and &quot;caretaker&quot; in conformity to societal norms and their male partner. Author bell hooks states &quot;within the family structure, individuals learn to accept sexist oppression as &#x27;natural&#x27; and are primed to support other forms of oppression, including heterosexist domination.&quot; &quot;[T]he cultural, economic, political and legal supremacy of the husband&quot; was &quot;[t]raditional ... under English law&quot;. This patriarchal dynamic is contrasted with a conception of egalitarian or peer marriage in which power and labour are divided equally, and not according to gender roles.

In the US, studies have shown that, despite egalitarian ideals being common, less than half of respondents viewed their opposite-sex relationships as equal in power, with unequal relationships being more commonly dominated by the male partner. Studies also show that married couples find the highest level of satisfaction in egalitarian relationships and lowest levels of satisfaction in wife dominate relationships. In recent years, egalitarian or peer marriages have been receiving increasing focus and attention politically, economically and culturally in a number of countries, including the United States.

====Extra-marital sex====


Different societies demonstrate variable tolerance of extramarital sex. The Standard Cross-Cultural Sample describes the occurrence of extramarital sex by gender in over 50 pre-industrial cultures. The occurrence of extramarital sex by men is described as &quot;universal&quot; in 6 cultures, &quot;moderate&quot; in 29 cultures, &quot;occasional&quot; in 6 cultures, and &quot;uncommon&quot; in 10 cultures. The occurrence of extramarital sex by women is described as &quot;universal&quot; in 6 cultures, &quot;moderate&quot; in 23 cultures, &quot;occasional&quot; in 9 cultures, and &quot;uncommon&quot; in 15 cultures. Three studies using nationally representative samples in the United States found that between 10 and 15% of women and 20–25% of men engage in extramarital sex.

Many of the world&#x27;s major religions look with disfavor on sexual relations outside marriage. In some non-secular Islamic countries, there are criminal penalties for sexual intercourse before marriage. Sexual relations by a married person with someone other than his/her spouse is known as adultery. Adultery is considered in many jurisdictions to be a crime and grounds for divorce.

In some countries, such as Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Kuwait, Maldives, Morocco, Oman, Mauritania, United Arab Emirates, Sudan, Yemen, any form of sexual activity outside marriage is illegal.

In some parts of the world, women and girls accused of having sexual relations outside marriage are at risk of becoming victims of honor killings committed by their families. In 2011 several people were sentenced to death by stoning after being accused of adultery in Iran, Somalia, Afghanistan, Sudan, Mali and Pakistan. Practices such as honor killings and stoning continue to be supported by mainstream politicians and other officials in some countries. In Pakistan, after the 2008 Balochistan honour killings in which five women were killed by tribesmen of the Umrani Tribe of Balochistan, Pakistani Federal Minister for Postal Services Israr Ullah Zehri defended the practice.

====Sexual violence====

An issue that is a serious concern regarding marriage and which has been the object of international scrutiny is that of sexual violence within marriage. Throughout much of the history, in most cultures, sex in marriage was considered a &#x27;right&#x27;, that could be taken by force (often by a man from a woman), if &#x27;denied&#x27;. As the concept of human rights started to develop in the 20th century, and with the arrival of second-wave feminism, such views, and laws, have become less widely held.

The legal and social concept of marital rape has developed in most industrialized countries in the mid- to late 20th century; in many other parts of the world it is not recognized as a form of abuse, socially or legally. Several countries in Eastern Europe and Scandinavia made marital rape illegal before 1970, and other countries in Western Europe and the English-speaking Western world outlawed it in the 1980s and 1990s. In England and Wales, marital rape was made illegal in 1991. Although marital rape is being increasingly criminalized in developing countries too, cultural, religious, and traditional ideologies about &quot;conjugal rights&quot; remain very strong in many parts of the world; and even where countries may have adequate laws against rape in marriage, these laws may rarely be enforced.

Apart from the issue of rape committed against one&#x27;s spouse, marriage is, in many parts of the world, closely connected with other forms of sexual violence: in some places, like Morocco, unmarried girls and women who are raped are often forced by their families to marry their rapist. Because being the victim of rape and losing virginity carry extreme social stigma, and the victims are deemed to have their &quot;reputation&quot; tarnished, a marriage with the rapist is arranged. This is claimed to be in the advantage of both the victim – who does not remain unmarried and does not lose social status – and of the rapist, who avoids punishment. In 2012, after a Moroccan 16-year-old girl committed suicide after having been forced by her family to marry her rapist and enduring further abuse by the rapist after they married, there have been protests from activists against this practice which is common in Morocco.

In some societies, the very high social and religious importance of marital fidelity, especially female fidelity, has as result the criminalization of adultery, often with harsh penalties such as stoning or flogging; as well as leniency towards punishment of violence related to infidelity (such as honor killings). In the 21st century, criminal laws against adultery have become controversial with international organizations calling for their abolition. Opponents of adultery laws argue that these laws are a major contributor to discrimination and violence against women, as they are enforced selectively mostly against women; that they prevent women from reporting sexual violence; and that they maintain social norms which justify violent crimes committed against women by husbands, families and communities. A Joint Statement by the United Nations Working Group on discrimination against women in law and in practice states that &quot;Adultery as a criminal offence violates women&#x27;s human rights&quot;. Some human rights organizations argue that the criminalization of adultery also violates internationally recognized protections for private life, as it represents an arbitrary interference with an individual&#x27;s privacy, which is not permitted under international law.

====Laws, human rights and gender status====
The laws surrounding heterosexual marriage in many countries have come under international scrutiny because they contradict international standards of human rights; institutionalize violence against women, child marriage and forced marriage; require the permission of a husband for his wife to work in a paid job, sign legal documents, file criminal charges against someone, sue in civil court etc.; sanction the use by husbands of violence to &quot;discipline&quot; their wives; and discriminate against women in divorce.

Such things were legal even in many Western countries until recently: for instance, in France, married women obtained the right to work without their husband&#x27;s permission in 1965, and in West Germany women obtained this right in 1977 (by comparison women in East Germany had many more rights). In Spain, during Franco&#x27;s era, a married woman needed her husband&#x27;s consent, referred to as the &quot;permiso marital&quot;, for almost all economic activities, including employment, ownership of property, and even traveling away from home; the &quot;permiso marital&quot; was abolished in 1975.

An absolute submission of a wife to her husband is accepted as natural in many parts of the world, for instance surveys by UNICEF have shown that the percentage of women aged 15–49 who think that a husband is justified in hitting or beating his wife under certain circumstances is as high as 90% in Afghanistan and Jordan, 87% in Mali, 86% in Guinea and Timor-Leste, 81% in Laos, 80% in Central African Republic. Detailed results from Afghanistan show that 78% of women agree with a beating if the wife &quot;goes out without telling him [the husband]&quot; and 76% agree &quot;if she argues with him&quot;.

Throughout history, and still today in many countries, laws have provided for extenuating circumstances, partial or complete defenses, for men who killed their wives due to adultery, with such acts often being seen as crimes of passion and being covered by legal defenses such as provocation or defense of family honor.

====Right and ability to divorce====
While international law and conventions recognize the need for consent for entering a marriage – namely that people cannot be forced to get married against their will – the right to obtain a divorce is not recognized; therefore holding a person in a marriage against their will (if such person has consented to entering in it) is not considered a violation of human rights, with the issue of divorce being left at the appreciation of individual states.

In the EU, the last country to allow divorce was Malta, in 2011. Around the world, the only countries to forbid divorce are Philippines and Vatican City, although in practice in many countries which use a fault-based divorce system obtaining a divorce is very difficult. The ability to divorce, in law and practice, has been and continues to be a controversial issue in many countries, and public discourse involves different ideologies such as feminism, social conservatism, religious interpretations.

====Dowry and bridewealth====
In recent years, the customs of dowry and bride price have received international criticism for inciting conflicts between families and clans; contributing to violence against women; promoting materialism; increasing property crimes (where men steal goods such as cattle in order to be able to pay the bride price); and making it difficult for poor people to marry. African women&#x27;s rights campaigners advocate the abolishing of bride price, which they argue is based on the idea that women are a form of property which can be bought. Bride price has also been criticized for contributing to child trafficking as impoverished parents sell their young daughters to rich older men. A senior Papua New Guinea police officer has called for the abolishing of bride price arguing that it is one of the main reasons for the mistreatment of women in that country. The opposite practice of dowry has been linked to a high level of violence (see Dowry death) and to crimes such as extortion.

====Children born outside marriage====

Historically, and still in many countries, children born outside marriage suffered severe social stigma and discrimination. In England and Wales, such children were known as bastards and whoresons.

There are significant differences between world regions in regard to the social and legal position of non-marital births, ranging from being fully accepted and uncontroversial to being severely stigmatized and discriminated.

The 1975 European Convention on the Legal Status of Children Born out of Wedlock protects the rights of children born to unmarried parents. The convention states, among others, that: &quot;The father and mother of a child born out of wedlock shall have the same obligation to maintain the child as if it were born in wedlock&quot; and that &quot;A child born out of wedlock shall have the same right of succession in the estate of its father and its mother and of a member of its father&#x27;s or mother&#x27;s family, as if it had been born in wedlock.&quot;

While in most Western countries legal inequalities between children born inside and outside marriage have largely been abolished, this is not the case in some parts of the world.

The legal status of an unmarried father differs greatly from country to country. Without voluntary formal recognition of the child by the father, in most cases there is a need of due process of law in order to establish paternity. In some countries however, unmarried cohabitation of a couple for a specific period of time does create a presumption of paternity similar to that of formal marriage. This is the case in Australia. Under what circumstances can a paternity action be initiated, the rights and responsibilities of a father once paternity has been established (whether he can obtain parental responsibility and whether he can be forced to support the child) as well as the legal position of a father who voluntarily acknowledges the child, vary widely by jurisdiction. A special situation arises when a married woman has a child by a man other than her husband. Some countries, such as Israel, refuse to accept a legal challenge of paternity in such a circumstance, in order to avoid the stigmatization of the child (see Mamzer, a concept under Jewish law). In 2010, the European Court of Human Rights ruled in favor of a German man who had fathered twins with a married woman, granting him right of contact with the twins, despite the fact that the mother and her husband had forbidden him to see the children.

The steps that an unmarried father must take in order to obtain rights to his child vary by country. In some countries (such as the UK – since 2003 in England and Wales, 2006 in Scotland, and 2002 in Northern Ireland) it is sufficient for the father to be listed on the birth certificate for him to have parental rights; in other countries, such as Ireland, simply being listed on the birth certificate does not offer any rights, additional legal steps must be taken (if the mother agrees, the parents can both sign a &quot;statutory declaration&quot;, but if the mother does not agree, the father has to apply to court).

Children born outside marriage have become more common, and in some countries, the majority. Recent data from Latin America showed figures for non-marital childbearing to be 74% for Colombia, 69% for Peru, 68% for Chile, 66% for Brazil, 58% for Argentina, 55% for Mexico. In 2012, in the European Union, 40% of births were outside marriage, and in the United States, in 2013, the figure was similar, at 41%. In the United Kingdom 48% of births were to unmarried women in 2012; in Ireland the figure was 35%.

During the first half of the 20th century, unmarried women in some Western countries were coerced by authorities to give their children up for adoption. This was especially the case in Australia, through the forced adoptions in Australia, with most of these adoptions taking place between the 1950s and the 1970s. In 2013, Julia Gillard, then Prime Minister of Australia, offered a national apology to those affected by the forced adoptions.

Some married couples choose not to have children. Others are unable to have children because of infertility or other factors preventing conception or the bearing of children. In some cultures, marriage imposes an &quot;obligation&quot; on women to bear children. In northern Ghana, for example, payment of bridewealth signifies a woman&#x27;s requirement to bear children, and women using birth control face substantial threats of physical abuse and reprisals.

==Religion==

Religions develop in specific geographic and social milieux. Religious attitudes and practices relating to marriage vary, but have many similarities.

===Abrahamic religions===

====Baháʼí Faith====
The Baháʼí Faith encourages marriage and views it as a mutually strengthening bond. A Baháʼí marriage is contingent on the consent of all living parents.

====Christianity====


Modern Christianity bases its views on marriage upon the teachings of Jesus and the Paul the Apostle. Many of the largest Christian denominations regard marriage as a sacrament, sacred institution, or covenant.

The first known decrees on marriage were during the Roman Catholic Council of Trent (twenty-fourth session of 1563), decrees that made the validity of marriage dependent on the wedding occurring in the presence of a priest and two witnesses. The absence of a requirement of parental consent ended a debate that proceeded from the 12th century. In the case of a civil divorce, the innocent spouse had and has no right to marry again until the death of the other spouse terminates the still valid marriage, even if the other spouse was guilty of adultery.

The Christian Church performed marriages in the narthex of the church prior to the 16th century, when the emphasis was on the marital contract and betrothal. Subsequently, the ceremony moved inside the sacristy of the church.

Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, as well as many Anglicans and Methodists, consider marriage termed &quot;holy matrimony&quot; to be an expression of divine grace, termed a &quot;sacrament&quot; and &quot;mystery&quot; in the first two Christian traditions. In Western ritual, the ministers of the sacrament are the spouses themselves, with a bishop, priest, or deacon merely witnessing the union on behalf of the Church and blessing it. In Eastern ritual churches, the bishop or priest functions as the actual minister of the Sacred Mystery; Eastern Orthodox deacons may not perform marriages. Western Christians commonly refer to marriage as a vocation, while Eastern Christians consider it an ordination and a martyrdom, though the theological emphases indicated by the various names are not excluded by the teachings of either tradition. Marriage is commonly celebrated in the context of a Eucharistic service (a nuptial Mass or Divine Liturgy).

The Roman Catholic tradition of the 12th and 13th centuries defined marriage as a sacrament ordained by God, signifying the mystical marriage of Christ to his Church.
The matrimonial covenant, by which a man and a woman establish between themselves a partnership of the whole of life, is by its nature ordered toward the good of the spouses and the procreation and education of offspring; this covenant between baptized persons has been raised by Christ the Lord to the dignity of a sacrament.
For Catholic and Methodist Christians, the mutual love between husband and wife becomes an image of the eternal love with which God loves humankind. In the United Methodist Church, the celebration of Holy Matrimony ideally occurs in the context of a Service of Worship, which includes the celebration of the Eucharist. Likewise, the celebration of marriage between two Catholics normally takes place during the public liturgical celebration of the Holy Mass, because of its sacramental connection with the unity of the Paschal mystery of Christ (Communion). Sacramental marriage confers a perpetual and exclusive bond between the spouses. By its nature, the institution of marriage and conjugal love is ordered to the procreation and upbringing of offspring. Marriage creates rights and duties in the Church between the spouses and towards their children: &quot;[e]ntering marriage with the intention of never having children is a grave wrong and more than likely grounds for an annulment&quot;. According to Roman Catholic legislation, progeny of annulled relationships are considered legitimate. Civilly remarried persons who civilly divorced a living and lawful spouse are not separated from the Church, but they cannot receive Eucharistic Communion.

Divorce and remarriage, while generally not encouraged, are regarded differently by each Christian denomination, with certain traditions, such as the Catholic Church, teaching the concept of an annulment. For example, the Reformed Church in America permits divorce and remarriage, while connexions such as the Evangelical Methodist Church Conference forbid divorce except in the case of fornication and do not allow for remarriage in any circumstance. The Eastern Orthodox Church allows divorce for a limited number of reasons, and in theory, but usually not in practice, requires that a marriage after divorce be celebrated with a penitential overtone. With respect to marriage between a Christian and a pagan, the early Church &quot;sometimes took a more lenient view, invoking the so-called Pauline privilege of permissible separation (1 Cor. 7) as legitimate grounds for allowing a convert to divorce a pagan spouse and then marry a Christian.&quot;

The Catholic Church adheres to the proscription of Jesus in &quot;Matthew&quot;, 19: 6 that married spouses who have consummated their marriage &quot;are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore, what God has joined together, no human being must separate.&quot; Consequently, the Catholic Church understands that it is wholly without authority to terminate a sacramentally valid and consummated marriage, and its &quot;Codex Iuris Canonici&quot; (1983 Code of Canon Law) confirms this in Canons 1055–7. Specifically, Canon 1056 declares that &quot;the essential properties of marriage are unity and &quot;indissolubility&quot;; in [C]hristian marriage they acquire a distinctive &quot;firmness&quot; by reason of the sacrament.&quot; Canon 1057, §2 declares that marriage is &quot;an &quot;irrevocable&quot; covenant&quot;. Therefore, divorce of such a marriage is a metaphysical, moral, and legal impossibility. However, the Church has the authority to annul a presumed &quot;marriage&quot; by declaring it to have been invalid from the beginning, i. e., declaring it not to be and never to have been a marriage, in an annulment procedure, which is basically a fact-finding and fact-declaring effort.

For Protestant denominations, the purposes of marriage include intimate companionship, rearing children, and mutual support for both spouses to fulfill their life callings. Most Reformed Christians did not regard marriage to the status of a sacrament but considered it a covenant between spouses before God. In addition, some Protestant denominations (such as the Methodist Churches) affirmed that Holy Matrimony is a &quot;means of grace, thus, sacramental in character&quot;.
Since the 16th century, five competing models have shaped marriage in the Western tradition, as described by John Witte, Jr.:
* Marriage as Sacrament in the Roman Catholic Tradition
* Marriage as Social Estate in the Lutheran Reformation
* Marriage as Covenant in the Reformed (and Methodist) Traditions
* Marriage as Commonwealth in the Anglican Tradition
* Marriage as Contract in the Enlightenment Tradition

Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) believe that &quot;marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and that the family is central to the Creator&#x27;s plan for the eternal destiny of His children.&quot; Their view of marriage is that family relationships can endure beyond the grave. This is known as &#x27;eternal marriage&#x27; which can be eternal only when authorized priesthood holders perform the sealing ordinance in sacred temples.

With respect to religion, historic Christian belief emphasizes that Christian weddings should occur in a church as Christian marriage should begin where one also starts their faith journey (Christians receive the sacrament of baptism in church in the presence of their congregation). Catholic Christian weddings must &quot;take place in a church building&quot; as holy matrimony is a sacrament; sacraments normatively occur in the presence of Christ in the house of God, and &quot;members of the faith community [should be] present to witness the event and provide support and encouragement for those celebrating the sacrament.&quot; Bishops never grant permission &quot;to those requesting to be married in a garden, on the beach, or some other place outside of the church&quot; and a dispensation is only granted &quot;in extraordinary circumstances (for example, if a bride or groom is ill or disabled and unable to come to the church).&quot; Marriage in the church, for Christians, is seen as contributing to the fruit of the newlywed couple regularly attending church each Lord&#x27;s Day and raising children in the faith.

=====Christian attitudes to same-sex marriage=====
Although many Christian denominations do not currently perform same-sex marriages, many do, such as the Presbyterian Church (USA), some dioceses of the Episcopal Church, the Metropolitan Community Church, Quakers, United Church of Canada, and United Church of Christ congregations, and some Anglican dioceses, for example. Same-sex marriage is recognized by various religious denominations.

==== Islam ====



Islam also commends marriage, with the age of marriage being whenever the individuals feel ready, financially and emotionally.

In Islam, polygyny is allowed while polyandry is not, with the specific limitation that a man can have no more than four legal wives at any one time and an unlimited number of female slaves as concubines who may have rights similar wives, with the exception of not being free unless the man has children with them, with the requirement that the man is able and willing to partition his time and wealth equally among the respective wives and concubines (this practice of concubinage, as in Judaism, is not applicable in contemporary times and has been deemed by scholars as invalid due to shifts in views about the role of slavery in the world).

For a Muslim wedding to take place, the bridegroom and the guardian of the bride (&quot;wali&quot;) must both agree on the marriage. Should the guardian disagree on the marriage, it may not legally take place. If the &quot;wali&quot; of the girl is her father or paternal grandfather, he has the right to force her into marriage even against her proclaimed will, if it is her first marriage, the exercise of this power is, however, very strictly regulated in the interests of the bride. A guardian who is allowed to force the bride into marriage is called &quot;wali mujbir&quot;. As minors are not in a position to make a declaration of their wishes which is valid in law, they can only be married at all by a wali mudjbir, but a woman married in this way by another than her ascendant is entitled on coming of age to demand that her marriage be declared void (faskh) by the qadi.

From an Islamic (Sharia) law perspective, the minimum requirements and responsibilities in a Muslim marriage are that the groom provide living expenses to the bride, and in return, the bride&#x27;s main responsibility is raising children to be proper Muslims. All other rights and responsibilities are to be decided between the husband and wife, and may even be included as stipulations in the marriage contract, so long as they do not go against the minimum requirements of the marriage.

In Sunni Islam, marriage must take place in the presence of at least two reliable witnesses, with the consent of the guardian of the bride and the consent of the groom. Following the marriage, the couple may consummate the marriage. To create an &#x27;urf marriage, it is sufficient that a man and a woman indicate an intention to marry each other and recite the requisite words in front of a suitable Muslim. The wedding party usually follows but can be held days, or months later, whenever the couple and their families want to; however, there can be no concealment of the marriage as it is regarded as public notification due to the requirement of witnesses.

In Shia Islam, marriage may take place without the presence of witnesses as is often the case in temporary Nikah mut&#x27;ah (prohibited in Sunni Islam), but with the consent of both the bride and the groom. Following the marriage, they may consummate their marriage.

====Judaism====

In Judaism, marriage is based on the laws of the Torah and is a contractual bond between spouses in which the spouses agree to be consecrated to one another. This contract is called Kiddushin. Though procreation is not the sole purpose, a Jewish marriage is also expected to fulfill the commandment to have children, as it is written &quot;God blessed them and God said to them, &#x27;Be fertile and increase. The main focus centers around the relationship between the spouses. Kabbalistically, marriage is understood to mean that the spouses are merging into a single soul. In Kabbalistic thought, a man is considered &quot;incomplete&quot; if he is not married, as his soul is only one part of a larger whole that remains to be unified.

The Hebrew Bible describes a number of marriages, including those of Isaac, Jacob and Samson. Polygyny, or men having multiple wives at once, is one of the most common marital arrangements represented in the Hebrew Bible; another is that of concubinage (pilagshut) which was often arranged by a man, and a woman who generally enjoyed the same rights as a full legal wife. Other means of concubinage are observed by the author of Judges 19–20, or during war, as in Deuteronomy 21:10–12. The rabbis of the Talmud exhibited discomfort with abduction of women in war for the purpose of marriage, declaring it to be a &quot;compromise against man&#x27;s evil inclination&quot; to be avoided. Today Ashkenazi Jews are prohibited to take more than one wife because of a ban instituted on this by Gershom ben Judah (d. 1040 CE). However, academic scholarship indicates that prohibitions on polygyny may have existed far earlier, based on the Damascus Covenant.

Among ancient Hebrews, marriage was a domestic affair and not a religious ceremony; no officiant or witness was required by law. The Rambam wrote that &quot;before the Torah was given, when a man would meet a woman in the marketplace and he and she decided to marry, he would bring her home, conduct relations in private and thus make her his wife.&quot; Subsequently, to the Torah being handed down at Sinai, however, the Jews received the commandment that a marriage must be witnessed.

Betrothal (&quot;erusin&quot;), which refers to the time that this binding contract is made, is distinct from marriage itself (&quot;nissu&#x27;in&quot;), with the time between these events varying substantially. In biblical times, a wife was regarded as personal property, belonging to her husband; the descriptions of the Bible suggest that she would be expected to perform tasks such as spinning, sewing, weaving, manufacture of clothing, fetching of water, baking of bread, and animal husbandry. A husband&#x27;s obligations to his wife are 1) to provide her with food and care; 2) to supply her clothing and shelter; 3) to share a home with her; 4) to provide the ketubah (marriage contract); 5) to supply medical care if she falls ill; 6) to ransom her back if she is kidnapped; 7) to provide proper burial when she dies; 8) to provide for her materially if he predeceases her; 9) to provide for the support of their daughters until they marry or become adults; and 10) to see that their sons inherit the money specified in her ketubah, in addition to their portion of his estate. Men are also obligated sexually to their wives, per BT Ketubot 61b:10, with the frequency of marital relations determined in part by the occupation (and hence availability) of the husband.

Because a wife was regarded as property, her husband was originally free to divorce her for any reason, at any time. However, Talmudic sources complicate this matter significantly, with Beit Shammai stating that a man may divorce his wife only if she has committed a sexual transgression (such as adultery). Divorcing a woman against her will was also banned by Gershom ben Judah for Ashkenazi Jews. A divorced couple were permitted to remarry, unless the wife had married someone else after her divorce.

===Hinduism===

Hinduism regards &quot;Vivāha&quot; or &quot;Biye&quot; (marriage) to be a sacred duty that entails both religious and social obligations. It is regarded to be an important &quot;samskara&quot;, or a rite of passage. Hindu texts describe four &quot;purusharthas&quot; (goals of existence): &quot;dharma&quot; (righteousness), &quot;artha&quot; (wealth), &quot;kama&quot; (desire), and &quot;moksha&quot; (liberation). The purpose of the marriage &quot;samskara&quot; is to fulfill the goal of &quot;kama&quot;, allowing an adherent to gradually advance towards the attainment of &quot;moksha&quot;. The Manusmriti describes many different types of marriages and their categorisation, ranging from the &quot;gandharva vivaha&quot; (a consensual marriage of love between a man and a woman without the performance of rituals or witnesses) to the &quot;rakshasa vivaha&quot; (a &quot;demoniac&quot; marriage, performed by abduction of one participant by the other participant, usually, but not always, with the help of other persons). In the Indian subcontinent, arranged marriages, in which the spouse&#x27;s parents or an older family member choose the partner, are still predominant in comparison with love marriages in the contemporary period. The Hindu Widow&#x27;s Remarriage Act 1856 empowers a Hindu widow to remarry.

===Buddhism===

The Buddhist view of marriage considers marriage a secular affair and thus not a sacrament. Buddhists are expected to follow the civil laws regarding marriage laid out by their respective governments. Gautama Buddha, being a kshatriya was required by Shakyan tradition to pass a series of tests to prove himself as a warrior, before he was allowed to marry.

===Sikhism===
In a Sikh marriage, the couple walks around the &quot;Guru Granth Sahib&quot; holy book four times, and a holy man recites from it in the kirtan style. The ceremony is known as &#x27;Anand Karaj&#x27; and represents the holy union of two souls united as one.

===Wicca===
Wiccan marriages are commonly known as handfastings and are a celebration held by Wiccans. Handfasting was originally a medieval ritual and has been revived by contemporary Pagans. In the ritual, the couple&#x27;s wrists are tied together to symbolize the binding of two lives. It is commonly used in Wicca and Pagan ceremonies, but it has become more mainstream and comes up in both religious and secular vows and readings. Although handfastings vary for each Wiccan they often involve honoring Wiccan deities. Some Wiccan traditions have a marriage vow &quot;for as long as love lasts&quot; instead of the traditional Christian &quot;till death do us part&quot;. The first Wiccan wedding took place in 1960, between Frederic Lamond and his wife, Gillian. Most Wiccan traditions will celebrate same-sex and different-sex handfastings. The length of commitment varies from a year and a day (after which the vows may be renewed), &quot;as long as love shall last&quot;, for a lifetime, or for future incarnations.

Consensual sex is considered sacred for Wiccans. Some traditions perform the Great Rite, in which a High Priest and High Priestess invoke the God and Goddess on each other before making love. It can be used to raise magical energy for the use of spell work. It can also be performed symbolically, using the athame to symbolize masculine energy and the chalice to symbolize feminine energy.

== Health ==
Marriage, like other close relationships, exerts considerable influence on health. Married people experience lower morbidity and mortality across such diverse health threats as cancer, heart attacks, and surgery. Research on marriage and health is part of the broader study of the benefits of social relationships.

Social ties provide people with a sense of identity, purpose, belonging, and support. Simply being married, as well as the quality of one&#x27;s marriage, have been linked to diverse measures of health.

The health-protective effect of marriage is stronger for men than women. Marital status—the simple fact of being married—confers more health benefits to men than women.

Women&#x27;s health is more strongly impacted than men&#x27;s by marital conflict or satisfaction, such that unhappily married women do not enjoy better health relative to their single counterparts. Most research on marriage and health has focused on heterosexual couples; more work is needed to clarify the health impacts of same-sex marriage.

==Divorce and annulment==
In most societies, the death of one of the partners terminates the marriage, and in monogamous societies, this allows the other partner to remarry, though sometimes after a waiting or mourning period.

In some societies, a marriage can be annulled, when an authority declares that a marriage never happened. Jurisdictions often have provisions for void marriages or voidable marriages.

A marriage may also be terminated through divorce. Countries that have relatively recently legalized divorce are Italy (1970), Portugal (1975), Brazil (1977), Spain (1981), Argentina (1987), Paraguay (1991), Colombia (1991), Ireland (1996), Chile (2004) and Malta (2011). As of 2012, the Philippines and the Vatican City are the only jurisdictions which do not allow divorce (this is currently under discussion in Philippines). After divorce, one spouse may have to pay alimony. Laws concerning divorce and the ease with which a divorce can be obtained vary widely around the world. After a divorce or an annulment, the people concerned are free to remarry (or marry).

A statutory right of two married partners to mutually consent to divorce was enacted in western nations in the mid-20th century. In the United States, no-fault divorce was first enacted in California in 1969 and the final state to legalize it was New York in 1989.

About 45% of marriages in Britain and, according to a 2009 study, 46% of marriages in the U.S. end in divorce.

==History==
The history of marriage is often considered under history of the family or legal history.

===Ancient world=== 

====Ancient Near East====
Many cultures have legends concerning the origins of marriage. The way in which a marriage is conducted and its rules and ramifications have changed over time, as has the institution itself, depending on the culture or demographic of the time.

The first recorded evidence of marriage ceremonies uniting a man and a woman dates back to approximately 2350 BC, in ancient Mesopotamia. Wedding ceremonies, as well as dowry and divorce, can be traced back to Mesopotamia and Babylonia.
According to ancient Hebrew tradition, a wife was seen as being property of high value and was, therefore, usually, carefully looked after. Early nomadic communities in the Middle East practiced a form of marriage known as &quot;beena&quot;, in which a wife would own a tent of her own, within which she retains complete independence from her husband. The Covenant Code orders &quot;If he take him another; her food, her clothing, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish (or lessen)&quot;. The Talmud interprets this as a requirement for a man to provide food and clothing to, and have sex with, each of his wives. However, &quot;duty of marriage&quot; is also interpreted as whatever one does as a married couple, which is more than just sexual activity. And the term diminish, which means to lessen, shows the man must treat her as if he was not married to another.

As a polygynous society, the Israelites did not have any laws that imposed marital fidelity on men. Adulterous married women, adulterous betrothed women, and the men who slept with them, however, were subject to the death penalty by the biblical laws against adultery. The literary prophets indicate that adultery was a frequent occurrence, despite these legal strictness&#x27;s.

====Classical Greece and Rome====
In ancient Greece, no specific civil ceremony was required for the creation of a heterosexual marriage – only mutual agreement and the fact that the couple must regard each other as husband and wife accordingly. Men usually married when they were in their 20s and women in their teens. It has been suggested that these ages made sense for the Greeks because men were generally done with military service or financially established by their late 20s, and marrying a teenage girl ensured ample time for her to bear children, as life expectancies were significantly lower. Married Greek women had few rights in ancient Greek society and were expected to take care of the house and children. Time was an important factor in Greek marriage. For example, there were superstitions that being married during a full moon was good luck and Greeks married in the winter in honor of Hera. Inheritance was more important than feelings: a woman whose father dies without male heirs could be forced to marry her nearest male relative – even if she had to divorce her husband first.

There were several types of marriages in ancient Roman society. The traditional (&quot;conventional&quot;) form called &quot;conventio in manum&quot; required a ceremony with witnesses and was also dissolved with a ceremony. In this type of marriage, a woman lost her family rights of inheritance of her old family and gained them with her new one. She now was subject to the authority of her husband. There was the free marriage known as &quot;sine manu&quot;. In this arrangement, the wife remained a member of her original family; she stayed under the authority of her father, kept her family rights of inheritance with her old family and did not gain any with the new family. The minimum age of marriage for girls was 12.

====Germanic tribes====
Among ancient Germanic tribes, the bride and groom were roughly the same age and generally older than their Roman counterparts, at least according to Tacitus:
The youths partake late of the pleasures of love, and hence pass the age of puberty unexhausted: nor are the virgins hurried into marriage; the same maturity, the same full growth is required: the sexes unite equally matched and robust, and the children inherit the vigor of their parents.
Where Aristotle had set the prime of life at 37 years for men and 18 for women, the Visigothic Code of law in the 7th century placed the prime of life at 20 years for both men and women, after which both presumably married. Tacitus states that ancient Germanic brides were on average about 20 and were roughly the same age as their husbands. Tacitus, however, had never visited the German-speaking lands and most of his information on Germania comes from secondary sources. In addition, Anglo-Saxon women, like those of other Germanic tribes, are marked as women from the age of 12 and older, based on archaeological finds, implying that the age of marriage coincided with puberty.

===Europe===

From the early Christian era (30 to 325 CE), marriage was thought of as primarily a private matter, with no uniform religious or other ceremony being required. However, bishop Ignatius of Antioch, writing around 110, exhorts, &quot;[I]t becomes both men and women who marry, to form their union with the approval of the bishop, that their marriage may be according to God, and not after their own lust.&quot;

In 12th-century Europe, women took the surname of their husbands and starting in the second half of the 16th century parental consent along with the church&#x27;s consent was required for marriage.

With few local exceptions, until 1545, Christian marriages in Europe were by mutual consent, declaration of intention to marry and upon the subsequent physical union of the parties. The couple would promise verbally to each other that they would be married to each other; the presence of a priest or witnesses was not required. This promise was known as the &quot;verbum.&quot; If freely given and made in the present tense (e.g., &quot;I marry you&quot;), it was unquestionably binding; if made in the future tense (&quot;I will marry you&quot;), it would constitute a betrothal.

According to the Charter of Navarre, the basic union consisted of a civil marriage with no priest required and at least two witnesses, and the contract could be broken using the same formula. The Church in turn lashed out at those who got married twice or thrice in a row while their formers spouses were still alive. In 1563 the Council of Trent, twenty-fourth session, required that a valid marriage must be performed by a priest before two witnesses.

One of the functions of churches from the Middle Ages was to register marriages, which was not obligatory. There was no state involvement in marriage and personal status, with these issues being adjudicated in ecclesiastical courts. During the Middle Ages marriages were arranged, sometimes as early as birth, and these early pledges to marry were often used to ensure treaties between different royal families, nobles, and heirs of fiefdoms. The church resisted these imposed unions, and increased the number of causes for nullification of these arrangements. As Christianity spread during the Roman period and the Middle Ages, the idea of free choice in selecting marriage partners increased and spread with it.

In medieval Western Europe, later marriage and higher rates of definitive celibacy (the so-called &quot;European marriage pattern&quot;) helped to constrain patriarchy at its most extreme level. For example, Medieval England saw marriage age as variable depending on economic circumstances, with couples delaying marriage until the early twenties when times were bad and falling to the late teens after the Black Death, when there were labor shortages; by appearances, marriage of adolescents was not the norm in England. Where the strong influence of classical Celtic and Germanic cultures (which were not rigidly patriarchal) helped to offset the Judaeo-Roman patriarchal influence, in Eastern Europe the tradition of early and universal marriage (often in early adolescence), as well as traditional Slavic patrilocal custom, led to a greatly inferior status of women at all levels of society.
The average age of marriage for most of Northwestern Europe from 1500 to 1800 was around 25 years of age; as the Church dictated that both parties had to be at least 21 years of age to marry without the consent of their parents, the bride and groom were roughly the same age, with most brides in their early twenties and most grooms two or three years older, and a substantial number of women married for the first time in their thirties and forties, particularly in urban areas, with the average age at first marriage rising and falling as circumstances dictated. In better times, more people could afford to marry earlier and thus fertility rose and conversely marriages were delayed or forgone when times were bad, thus restricting family size; after the Black Death, the greater availability of profitable jobs allowed more people to marry young and have more children, but the stabilization of the population in the 16th century meant fewer job opportunities and thus more people delaying marriages.

The age of marriage was not absolute, however, as child marriages occurred throughout the Middle Ages and later, with just some of them including:
* The 1552 CE marriage between John Somerford and Jane Somerford Brereto, at the ages of 3 and 2, respectively.
* In the early 1900s, Magnus Hirschfeld surveyed the age of consent in about 50 countries, which he found to often range between 12 and 16. In the Vatican, the age of consent was 12.

As part of the Protestant Reformation, the role of recording marriages and setting the rules for marriage passed to the state, reflecting Martin Luther&#x27;s view that marriage was a &quot;worldly thing&quot;. By the 17th century, many of the Protestant European countries had a state involvement in marriage.

In England, under the Anglican Church, marriage by consent and cohabitation was valid until the passage of Marriage Act 1753. This act instituted certain requirements for marriage, including the performance of a religious ceremony observed by witnesses.
As part of the Counter-Reformation, in 1563 the Council of Trent decreed that a Roman Catholic marriage would be recognized only if the marriage ceremony was officiated by a priest with two witnesses. The council also authorized a Catechism, issued in 1566, which defined marriage as &quot;The conjugal union of man and woman, contracted between two qualified persons, which obliges them to live together throughout life.&quot;

In the early modern period, John Calvin and his Protestant colleagues reformulated Christian marriage by enacting the Marriage Ordinance of Geneva, which imposed &quot;The dual requirements of state registration and church consecration to constitute marriage&quot; for recognition.

In England and Wales, Lord Hardwicke&#x27;s Marriage Act 1753 required a formal ceremony of marriage, thereby curtailing the practice of Fleet Marriage, an irregular or a clandestine marriage. From the 1690s until the Marriage Act 1753 as many as 300,000 clandestine marriages were performed at Fleet Prison alone. The act required a marriage ceremony to be officiated by an Anglican priest in the Anglican Church with two witnesses and registration. The act did not apply to Jewish marriages or those of Quakers, whose marriages continued to be governed by their own customs.

In England and Wales, since 1837, civil marriages have been recognized as a legal alternative to church marriages under the Marriage Act 1836. In Germany, civil marriages were recognized in 1875. This law permitted a declaration of the marriage before an official clerk of the civil administration, when both spouses affirm their will to marry, to constitute a legally recognized valid and effective marriage, and allowed an optional private clerical marriage ceremony.

In contemporary English common law, a marriage is a voluntary contract by a man and a woman, in which by agreement they choose to become husband and wife. Edvard Westermarck proposed that &quot;the institution of marriage has probably developed out of a primeval habit&quot;.

Since the late twentieth century, major social changes in Western countries have led to changes in the demographics of marriage, with the age of first marriage increasing, fewer people marrying, and more couples choosing to cohabit rather than marry. For example, the number of marriages in Europe decreased by 30% from 1975 to 2005. As of 2000, the average marriage age range was 25–44 years for men and 22–39 years for women.

===China===
The mythological origin of Chinese marriage is a story about Nüwa and Fu Xi who invented proper marriage procedures after becoming married. In ancient Chinese society, people of the same surname are supposed to consult with their family trees prior to marriage to reduce the potential risk of unintentional incest. Marrying one&#x27;s maternal relatives was generally not thought of as incest. Families sometimes intermarried from one generation to another. Over time, Chinese people became more geographically mobile. Individuals remained members of their biological families. When a couple died, the husband and the wife were buried separately in the respective clan&#x27;s graveyard. In a maternal marriage, a male would become a son-in-law who lived in the wife&#x27;s home.

The New Marriage Law of 1950 radically changed Chinese marriage traditions, enforcing monogamy, equality of men and women, and choice in marriage; arranged marriages were the most common type of marriage in China until then. Starting October 2003, it became legal to marry or divorce without authorization from the couple&#x27;s work units. Although people with infectious diseases such as AIDS may now marry, marriage is still illegal for the mentally ill.

===Korea===
The practice of matrilocality in Korea started in the Goguryeo period and ended in the early Joseon period. The Korean saying that when a man gets married, he is &quot;entering &quot;jangga&quot;&quot; (the house of his father-in-law), stems from the Goguryeo period.

<doc id="19731" wikidata="Q180682" url="?curid=19731" title="Midgard">
<text>In Germanic cosmology, Midgard (an anglicised form of Old Norse ; Old English , Old Saxon , Old High German , and Gothic &quot;Midjun-gards&quot;; &quot;middle yard&quot;, &quot;middle enclosure&quot;) is the name for Earth (equivalent in meaning to the Greek term : oikouménē, &quot;inhabited&quot;) inhabited by and known to humans in early Germanic cosmology. The Old Norse form plays a notable role in Norse cosmology.

==Etymology==
The Old Norse name is cognate with Gothic (attested in the Gospel of Luke as a translation of the Greek ), Old Saxon (in &quot;Heliand&quot;), Old High German (in &quot;Muspilli&quot;), and Old English . The latter, which appears in both prose and poetry, was transformed to or (&quot;Middle-earth&quot;) in Middle English literature.

All these forms stem from Common Germanic , a compound of (&quot;middle&quot;) and (&quot;yard, enclosure&quot;).
In early Germanic cosmology, it stands alongside the term &quot;world&quot; (cf. Old English , Old Saxon , Old High German , Old Frisian , Old Norse ), itself from a Common Germanic compound &quot;*wira-alđiz&quot; (&quot;man-age&quot;), which refers to the inhabited world, i.e. the realm of humankind.

==Old Norse==
In Norse mythology, &quot;Miðgarðr&quot; became applied to the wall around the world that the gods constructed from the eyebrows of the Ymir as a defense against the who lived in Jotunheim, east of &quot;Manheimr&quot;, the &quot;home of men&quot;, a word used to refer to the entire world. The gods slew the Ymir, the first created being, and put his body into the central void of the universe, creating the world out of his body: his flesh constituting the land, his blood the oceans, his bones the mountains, his teeth the cliffs, his hairs the trees, and his brains the clouds. Ymir&#x27;s skull was held by four dwarfs, Nordri, Sudri, Austri, and Vestri, who represent the four points on the compass and became the dome of heaven. The sun, moon, and stars were said to be scattered sparks in the skull.
According to the Eddas, Midgard will be destroyed at Ragnarök, the battle at the end of the world. Jörmungandr (also known as the Midgard Serpent or World Serpent) will arise from the ocean, poisoning the land and sea with his venom and causing the sea to rear up and lash against the land. The final battle will take place on the plain of Vígríðr, following which Midgard and almost all life on it will be destroyed, with the earth sinking into the sea only to rise again, fertile and green when the cycle repeats and the creation begins again.

Although most surviving instances of the word Midgard refer to spiritual matters, it was also used in more mundane situations, as in the Viking Age runestone poem from the inscription Sö 56 from Fyrby:

The Danish and Swedish form or , the Norwegian or , as well as the Icelandic and Faroese form , all derive from the Old Norse term.

==English==
The name &quot;middangeard&quot; occurs six times in the Old English epic poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;, and is the same word as Midgard in Old Norse. The term is equivalent in meaning to the Greek term Oikoumene, as referring to the known and inhabited world.

The concept of Midgard occurs many times in Middle English. The association with &quot;earth&quot; (OE &quot;eorðe&quot;) in Middle English &quot;middellærd&quot;, &quot;middelerde&quot; is by popular etymology; the modern English cognate of &quot;geard&quot; &quot;enclosure&quot; is &quot;yard&quot;. An early example of this transformation is from the Ormulum:

::&quot;þatt ure Drihhtin wollde / ben borenn i þiss middellærd&quot;

::that our Lord wanted / be born in this Middle-earth.

The usage of &quot;Middle-earth&quot; as a name for a setting was popularized by Old English scholar J. R. R. Tolkien in his &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and other fantasy works; he was originally inspired by the references to &quot;middangeard&quot; and &quot;Éarendel&quot; in the Old English poem &quot;Crist A&quot;.

==Other languages==
&quot;Mittilagart&quot; is mentioned in the 9th-century Old High German &quot;Muspilli&quot; (v. 54) meaning &quot;the world&quot; as opposed to the sea and the heavens:
::

::Sea is swallowed, flaming burn the heavens,
::Moon falls, Midgard burns

&quot;Middilgard&quot; is also attested in the Old Saxon &quot;Heliand&quot;:
::

::Over the middle earth;
::And all men He could help
