<text>Probability is the branch of mathematics and statistics concerning events and numerical descriptions of how likely they are to occur. The probability of an event is a number between 0 and 1; the larger the probability, the more likely an event is to occur. This number is often expressed as a percentage (%), ranging from 0% to 100%. A simple example is the tossing of a fair (unbiased) coin. Since the coin is fair, the two outcomes (&quot;heads&quot; and &quot;tails&quot;) are both equally probable; the probability of &quot;heads&quot; equals the probability of &quot;tails&quot;; and since no other outcomes are possible, the probability of either &quot;heads&quot; or &quot;tails&quot; is 1/2 (which could also be written as 0.5 or 50%).

These concepts have been given an axiomatic mathematical formalization in &quot;probability theory&quot;, which is used widely in areas of study such as statistics, mathematics, science, finance, gambling, artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer science, game theory, and philosophy to, for example, draw inferences about the expected frequency of events. Probability theory is also used to describe the underlying mechanics and regularities of complex systems.

==Etymology==

The word &quot;probability&quot; derives from the Latin , which can also mean &quot;probity&quot;, a measure of the authority of a witness in a legal case in Europe, and often correlated with the witness&#x27;s nobility. In a sense, this differs much from the modern meaning of &quot;probability&quot;, which in contrast is a measure of the weight of empirical evidence, and is arrived at from inductive reasoning and statistical inference.

==Interpretations==

When dealing with random experiments – i.e., experiments that are random and well-defined – in a purely theoretical setting (like tossing a coin), probabilities can be numerically described by the number of desired outcomes, divided by the total number of all outcomes. This is referred to as theoretical probability (in contrast to empirical probability, dealing with probabilities in the context of real experiments). For example, tossing a coin twice will yield &quot;head-head&quot;, &quot;head-tail&quot;, &quot;tail-head&quot;, and &quot;tail-tail&quot; outcomes. The probability of getting an outcome of &quot;head-head&quot; is 1 out of 4 outcomes, or, in numerical terms, 1/4, 0.25 or 25%. However, when it comes to practical application, there are two major competing categories of probability interpretations, whose adherents hold different views about the fundamental nature of probability:
* Objectivists assign numbers to describe some objective or physical state of affairs. The most popular version of objective probability is frequentist probability, which claims that the probability of a random event denotes the &quot;relative frequency of occurrence&quot; of an experiment&#x27;s outcome when the experiment is repeated indefinitely. This interpretation considers probability to be the relative frequency &quot;in the long run&quot; of outcomes. A modification of this is propensity probability, which interprets probability as the tendency of some experiment to yield a certain outcome, even if it is performed only once.
* Subjectivists assign numbers per subjective probability, that is, as a degree of belief. The degree of belief has been interpreted as &quot;the price at which you would buy or sell a bet that pays 1 unit of utility if E, 0 if not E&quot;, although that interpretation is not universally agreed upon. The most popular version of subjective probability is Bayesian probability, which includes expert knowledge as well as experimental data to produce probabilities. The expert knowledge is represented by some (subjective) prior probability distribution. These data are incorporated in a likelihood function. The product of the prior and the likelihood, when normalized, results in a posterior probability distribution that incorporates all the information known to date. By Aumann&#x27;s agreement theorem, Bayesian agents whose prior beliefs are similar will end up with similar posterior beliefs. However, sufficiently different priors can lead to different conclusions, regardless of how much information the agents share.

== History ==


The scientific study of probability is a modern development of mathematics. Gambling shows that there has been an interest in quantifying the ideas of probability throughout history, but exact mathematical descriptions arose much later. There are reasons for the slow development of the mathematics of probability. Whereas games of chance provided the impetus for the mathematical study of probability, fundamental issues are still obscured by superstitions.

According to Richard Jeffrey, &quot;Before the middle of the seventeenth century, the term &#x27;probable&#x27; (Latin &quot;probabilis&quot;) meant &quot;approvable&quot;, and was applied in that sense, univocally, to opinion and to action. A probable action or opinion was one such as sensible people would undertake or hold, in the circumstances.&quot; However, in legal contexts especially, &#x27;probable&#x27; could also apply to propositions for which there was good evidence.


The sixteenth-century Italian polymath Gerolamo Cardano demonstrated the efficacy of defining odds as the ratio of favourable to unfavourable outcomes (which implies that the probability of an event is given by the ratio of favourable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes).
Aside from the elementary work by Cardano, the doctrine of probabilities dates to the correspondence of Pierre de Fermat and Blaise Pascal (1654). Christiaan Huygens (1657) gave the earliest known scientific treatment of the subject. Jakob Bernoulli&#x27;s &quot;Ars Conjectandi&quot; (posthumous, 1713) and Abraham de Moivre&#x27;s &quot;Doctrine of Chances&quot; (1718) treated the subject as a branch of mathematics. See Ian Hacking&#x27;s &quot;The Emergence of Probability&quot; and James Franklin&#x27;s &quot;The Science of Conjecture&quot; for histories of the early development of the very concept of mathematical probability.

The theory of errors may be traced back to Roger Cotes&#x27;s &quot;Opera Miscellanea&quot; (posthumous, 1722), but a memoir prepared by Thomas Simpson in 1755 (printed 1756) first applied the theory to the discussion of errors of observation. The reprint (1757) of this memoir lays down the axioms that positive and negative errors are equally probable, and that certain assignable limits define the range of all errors. Simpson also discusses continuous errors and describes a probability curve.

The first two laws of error that were proposed both originated with Pierre-Simon Laplace. The first law was published in 1774, and stated that the frequency of an error could be expressed as an exponential function of the numerical magnitude of the errordisregarding sign. The second law of error was proposed in 1778 by Laplace, and stated that the frequency of the error is an exponential function of the square of the error. The second law of error is called the normal distribution or the Gauss law. &quot;It is difficult historically to attribute that law to Gauss, who in spite of his well-known precocity had probably not made this discovery before he was two years old.&quot;

Daniel Bernoulli (1778) introduced the principle of the maximum product of the probabilities of a system of concurrent errors.

Adrien-Marie Legendre (1805) developed the method of least squares, and introduced it in his &quot;Nouvelles méthodes pour la détermination des orbites des comètes&quot; (&quot;New Methods for Determining the Orbits of Comets&quot;). In ignorance of Legendre&#x27;s contribution, an Irish-American writer, Robert Adrain, editor of &quot;The Analyst&quot; (1808), first deduced the law of facility of error,

formula_1

where formula_2 is a constant depending on precision of observation, and formula_3 is a scale factor ensuring that the area under the curve equals 1. He gave two proofs, the second being essentially the same as John Herschel&#x27;s (1850). Gauss gave the first proof that seems to have been known in Europe (the third after Adrain&#x27;s) in 1809. Further proofs were given by Laplace (1810, 1812), Gauss (1823), James Ivory (1825, 1826), Hagen (1837), Friedrich Bessel (1838), W.F. Donkin (1844, 1856), and Morgan Crofton (1870). Other contributors were Ellis (1844), De Morgan (1864), Glaisher (1872), and Giovanni Schiaparelli (1875). Peters&#x27;s (1856) formula for &quot;r&quot;, the probable error of a single observation, is well known.

In the nineteenth century, authors on the general theory included Laplace, Sylvestre Lacroix (1816), Littrow (1833), Adolphe Quetelet (1853), Richard Dedekind (1860), Helmert (1872), Hermann Laurent (1873), Liagre, Didion and Karl Pearson. Augustus De Morgan and George Boole improved the exposition of the theory.

In 1906, Andrey Markov introduced the notion of Markov chains, which played an important role in stochastic processes theory and its applications. The modern theory of probability based on measure theory was developed by Andrey Kolmogorov in 1931.

On the geometric side, contributors to &quot;The Educational Times&quot; included Miller, Crofton, McColl, Wolstenholme, Watson, and Artemas Martin. See integral geometry for more information.

==Theory==

Like other theories, the theory of probability is a representation of its concepts in formal termsthat is, in terms that can be considered separately from their meaning. These formal terms are manipulated by the rules of mathematics and logic, and any results are interpreted or translated back into the problem domain.

There have been at least two successful attempts to formalize probability, namely the Kolmogorov formulation and the Cox formulation. In Kolmogorov&#x27;s formulation (see also probability space), sets are interpreted as events and probability as a measure on a class of sets. In Cox&#x27;s theorem, probability is taken as a primitive (i.e., not further analyzed), and the emphasis is on constructing a consistent assignment of probability values to propositions. In both cases, the laws of probability are the same, except for technical details.

There are other methods for quantifying uncertainty, such as the Dempster–Shafer theory or possibility theory, but those are essentially different and not compatible with the usually-understood laws of probability.

==Applications==
Probability theory is applied in everyday life in risk assessment and modeling. The insurance industry and markets use actuarial science to determine pricing and make trading decisions. Governments apply probabilistic methods in environmental regulation, entitlement analysis, and financial regulation.

An example of the use of probability theory in equity trading is the effect of the perceived probability of any widespread Middle East conflict on oil prices, which have ripple effects in the economy as a whole. An assessment by a commodity trader that a war is more likely can send that commodity&#x27;s prices up or down, and signals other traders of that opinion. Accordingly, the probabilities are neither assessed independently nor necessarily rationally. The theory of behavioral finance emerged to describe the effect of such groupthink on pricing, on policy, and on peace and conflict.

In addition to financial assessment, probability can be used to analyze trends in biology (e.g., disease spread) as well as ecology (e.g., biological Punnett squares). As with finance, risk assessment can be used as a statistical tool to calculate the likelihood of undesirable events occurring, and can assist with implementing protocols to avoid encountering such circumstances. Probability is used to design games of chance so that casinos can make a guaranteed profit, yet provide payouts to players that are frequent enough to encourage continued play.

Another significant application of probability theory in everyday life is reliability. Many consumer products, such as automobiles and consumer electronics, use reliability theory in product design to reduce the probability of failure. Failure probability may influence a manufacturer&#x27;s decisions on a product&#x27;s warranty.

The cache language model and other statistical language models that are used in natural language processing are also examples of applications of probability theory.

==Mathematical treatment==
Consider an experiment that can produce a number of results. The collection of all possible results is called the sample space of the experiment, sometimes denoted as formula_4. The power set of the sample space is formed by considering all different collections of possible results. For example, rolling a die can produce six possible results. One collection of possible results gives an odd number on the die. Thus, the subset {1,3,5} is an element of the power set of the sample space of dice rolls. These collections are called &quot;events&quot;. In this case, {1,3,5} is the event that the die falls on some odd number. If the results that actually occur fall in a given event, the event is said to have occurred.

A probability is a way of assigning every event a value between zero and one, with the requirement that the event made up of all possible results (in our example, the event {1,2,3,4,5,6}) is assigned a value of one. To qualify as a probability, the assignment of values must satisfy the requirement that for any collection of mutually exclusive events (events with no common results, such as the events {1,6}, {3}, and {2,4}), the probability that at least one of the events will occur is given by the sum of the probabilities of all the individual events.

The probability of an event &quot;A&quot; is written as formula_5, formula_6, or formula_7. This mathematical definition of probability can extend to infinite sample spaces, and even uncountable sample spaces, using the concept of a measure.

The &quot;opposite&quot; or &quot;complement&quot; of an event &quot;A&quot; is the event [not &quot;A&quot;] (that is, the event of &quot;A&quot; not occurring), often denoted as formula_8, formula_9, or formula_10; its probability is given by . As an example, the chance of not rolling a six on a six-sided die is For a more comprehensive treatment, see Complementary event.

If two events &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; occur on a single performance of an experiment, this is called the intersection or joint probability of &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, denoted as formula_11

===Independent events===

If two events, &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are independent then the joint probability is

formula_12

For example, if two coins are flipped, then the chance of both being heads is formula_13

===Mutually exclusive events===

If either event &quot;A&quot; or event &quot;B&quot; can occur but never both simultaneously, then they are called mutually exclusive events.

If two events are mutually exclusive, then the probability of &quot;both&quot; occurring is denoted as formula_14 andformula_15If two events are mutually exclusive, then the probability of &quot;either&quot; occurring is denoted as formula_16 andformula_17

For example, the chance of rolling a 1 or 2 on a six-sided die is formula_18

===Not (necessarily) mutually exclusive events===

If the events are not (necessarily) mutually exclusive thenformula_19Rewritten,formula_20

For example, when drawing a card from a deck of cards, the chance of getting a heart or a face card (J, Q, K) (or both) is formula_21 since among the 52 cards of a deck, 13 are hearts, 12 are face cards, and 3 are both: here the possibilities included in the &quot;3 that are both&quot; are included in each of the &quot;13 hearts&quot; and the &quot;12 face cards&quot;, but should only be counted once.

This can be expanded further for multiple not (necessarily) mutually exclusive events. For three events, this proceeds as follows:formula_22It can be seen, then, that this pattern can be repeated for any number of events.

===Conditional probability===
&quot;Conditional probability&quot; is the probability of some event &quot;A&quot;, given the occurrence of some other event &quot;B&quot;. Conditional probability is written formula_23, and is read &quot;the probability of &quot;A&quot;, given &quot;B&quot;&quot;. It is defined by

formula_24

If formula_25 then formula_23 is formally undefined by this expression. In this case formula_27 and formula_28 are independent, since formula_29 However, it is possible to define a conditional probability for some zero-probability events, for example by using a σ-algebra of such events (such as those arising from a continuous random variable).

For example, in a bag of 2 red balls and 2 blue balls (4 balls in total), the probability of taking a red ball is formula_30 however, when taking a second ball, the probability of it being either a red ball or a blue ball depends on the ball previously taken. For example, if a red ball was taken, then the probability of picking a red ball again would be formula_31 since only 1 red and 2 blue balls would have been remaining. And if a blue ball was taken previously, the probability of taking a red ball will be formula_32

===Inverse probability===

In probability theory and applications, &quot;Bayes&#x27; rule&quot; relates the odds of event formula_33 to event formula_34 before (prior to) and after (posterior to) conditioning on another event formula_35 The odds on formula_33 to event formula_37 is simply the ratio of the probabilities of the two events. When arbitrarily many events formula_27 are of interest, not just two, the rule can be rephrased as &quot;posterior is proportional to prior times likelihood&quot;, formula_39 where the proportionality symbol means that the left hand side is proportional to (i.e., equals a constant times) the right hand side as formula_27 varies, for fixed or given formula_28 (Lee, 2012; Bertsch McGrayne, 2012). In this form it goes back to Laplace (1774) and to Cournot (1843); see Fienberg (2005).

===Summary of probabilities===
==Relation to randomness and probability in quantum mechanics==
In a deterministic universe, based on Newtonian concepts, there would be no probability if all conditions were known (Laplace&#x27;s demon) (but there are situations in which sensitivity to initial conditions exceeds our ability to measure them, i.e. know them). In the case of a roulette wheel, if the force of the hand and the period of that force are known, the number on which the ball will stop would be a certainty (though as a practical matter, this would likely be true only of a roulette wheel that had not been exactly levelled – as Thomas A. Bass&#x27; Newtonian Casino revealed). This also assumes knowledge of inertia and friction of the wheel, weight, smoothness, and roundness of the ball, variations in hand speed during the turning, and so forth. A probabilistic description can thus be more useful than Newtonian mechanics for analyzing the pattern of outcomes of repeated rolls of a roulette wheel. Physicists face the same situation in the kinetic theory of gases, where the system, while deterministic &quot;in principle&quot;, is so complex (with the number of molecules typically the order of magnitude of the Avogadro constant ) that only a statistical description of its properties is feasible.

Probability theory is required to describe quantum phenomena. A revolutionary discovery of early 20th century physics was the random character of all physical processes that occur at sub-atomic scales and are governed by the laws of quantum mechanics. The objective wave function evolves deterministically but, according to the Copenhagen interpretation, it deals with probabilities of observing, the outcome being explained by a wave function collapse when an observation is made. However, the loss of determinism for the sake of instrumentalism did not meet with universal approval. Albert Einstein famously remarked in a letter to Max Born: &quot;I am convinced that God does not play dice&quot;. Like Einstein, Erwin Schrödinger, who discovered the wave function, believed quantum mechanics is a statistical approximation of an underlying deterministic reality. In some modern interpretations of the statistical mechanics of measurement, quantum decoherence is invoked to account for the appearance of subjectively probabilistic experimental outcomes.

<text>Poland, officially the Republic of Poland, is a country in Central Europe. It extends from the Baltic Sea in the north to the Sudetes and Carpathian Mountains in the south, bordered by Lithuania and Russia to the northeast, Belarus and Ukraine to the east, Slovakia and the Czech Republic to the south, and Germany to the west. The territory is characterised by a varied landscape, diverse ecosystems, and temperate climate. Poland is composed of sixteen voivodeships and is the fifth most populous member state of the European Union (EU), with over 38 million people, and the fifth largest EU country by land area, covering a combined area of . The capital and largest city is Warsaw; other major cities include Kraków, Wrocław, Łódź, Poznań, Gdańsk, and Szczecin.

Prehistoric human activity on Polish soil dates to the Lower Paleolithic, with continuous settlement since the end of the Last Glacial Period. Culturally diverse throughout late antiquity, in the early medieval period the region became inhabited by the West Slavic tribal Polans, who gave Poland its name. The process of establishing statehood coincided with the conversion of a pagan ruler of the Polans to Christianity, under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church in 966. The Kingdom of Poland emerged in 1025, and in 1569 cemented its long-standing association with Lithuania, thus forming the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. At the time, the Commonwealth was one of the great powers of Europe, with an elective monarchy and a uniquely liberal political system, which adopted Europe&#x27;s first modern constitution in 1791.

With the passing of the prosperous Polish Golden Age, the country was partitioned by neighbouring states at the end of the 18th century. Poland regained its independence at the end of World War I in 1918 with the creation of the Second Polish Republic, which emerged victorious in various conflicts of the interbellum period. In September 1939, the invasion of Poland by Germany and the Soviet Union marked the beginning of World War II, which resulted in the Holocaust and millions of Polish casualties. Forced into the Eastern Bloc in the global Cold War, the Polish People&#x27;s Republic was a founding signatory of the Warsaw Pact. Through the emergence and contributions of the Solidarity movement, the communist government was dissolved and Poland re-established itself as a liberal democracy in 1989, as the first of its neighbours.

Poland is a semi-presidential republic with its bicameral legislature comprising the Sejm and the Senate. Considered a middle power, it is a developed market and high-income economy that is the sixth largest in the EU by nominal GDP and the fifth largest by PPP-adjusted GDP. Poland enjoys a very high standard of living, safety, and economic freedom, as well as free university education and universal health care. The country has 17 UNESCO World Heritage Sites, 15 of which are cultural. Poland is a founding member state of the United Nations and a member of the Council of Europe, World Trade Organisation, OECD, NATO, and the European Union (including the Schengen Area).

== Etymology ==

The native Polish name for Poland is . The name is derived from the Polans, a West Slavic tribe who inhabited the Warta River basin of present-day Greater Poland region (6th–8th century CE). The tribe&#x27;s name stems from the Proto-Slavic noun &quot;pole&quot; meaning field, which itself originates from the Proto-Indo-European word &quot;*pleh₂-&quot; indicating flatland. The etymology alludes to the topography of the region and the flat landscape of Greater Poland. During the Middle Ages, the Latin form &quot;Polonia&quot; was widely used throughout Europe.

The country&#x27;s alternative archaic name is &quot;Lechia&quot; and its root syllable remains in official use in several languages, notably Hungarian, Lithuanian, and Persian. The exonym possibly derives from either Lech, a legendary ruler of the Lechites, or from the Lendians, a West Slavic tribe that dwelt on the south-easternmost edge of Lesser Poland. The origin of the tribe&#x27;s name lies in the Old Polish word &quot;lęda&quot; (plain). Initially, both names &quot;Lechia&quot; and &quot;Polonia&quot; were used interchangeably when referring to Poland by chroniclers during the Middle Ages.

== History ==
=== Prehistory and protohistory ===

The first Stone Age archaic humans and &quot;Homo erectus&quot; species settled what was to become Poland approximately 500,000 years ago, though the ensuing hostile climate prevented early humans from founding more permanent encampments. The arrival of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; and anatomically modern humans coincided with the climatic discontinuity at the end of the Last Glacial Period (Northern Polish glaciation 10,000 BC), when Poland became habitable. Neolithic excavations indicated broad-ranging development in that era; the earliest evidence of European cheesemaking (5500 BC) was discovered in Polish Kuyavia, and the Bronocice pot is incised with the earliest known depiction of what may be a wheeled vehicle (3400 BC).

The period spanning the Bronze Age and the Early Iron Age (1300 BC–500 BC) was marked by an increase in population density, establishment of palisaded settlements (gords) and the expansion of Lusatian culture. A significant archaeological find from the protohistory of Poland is a fortified settlement at Biskupin, attributed to the Lusatian culture of the Late Bronze Age (mid-8th century BC).

Throughout antiquity (400 BC–500 AD), many distinct ancient populations inhabited the territory of present-day Poland, notably Celtic, Scythian, Germanic, Sarmatian, Baltic and Slavic tribes. Furthermore, archaeological findings confirmed the presence of Roman Legions sent to protect the amber trade. The Polish tribes emerged following the second wave of the Migration Period around the 6th century AD; they were Slavic and may have included assimilated remnants of peoples that earlier dwelled in the area. Beginning in the early 10th century, the Polans would come to dominate other Lechitic tribes in the region, initially forming a tribal federation and later a centralised monarchical state.

=== Kingdom of Poland ===

Poland began to form into a recognisable unitary and territorial entity around the middle of the 10th century under the Piast dynasty. In 966 the ruler of the Polans, Mieszko I, accepted Christianity under the auspices of the Roman Church with the Baptism of Poland. In 968, a missionary bishopric was established in Poznań. An incipit titled Dagome iudex first defined Poland&#x27;s geographical boundaries with its capital in Gniezno and affirmed that its monarchy was under the protection of the Apostolic See. The country&#x27;s early origins were described by Gallus Anonymus in , the oldest Polish chronicle. An important national event of the period was the martyrdom of Saint Adalbert, who was killed by Prussian pagans in 997 and whose remains were reputedly bought back for their weight in gold by Mieszko&#x27;s successor, Bolesław I the Brave.

In 1000, at the Congress of Gniezno, Bolesław obtained the right of investiture from Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor, who assented to the creation of additional bishoprics and an archdioceses in Gniezno. Three new dioceses were subsequently established in Kraków, Kołobrzeg, and Wrocław. Also, Otto bestowed upon Bolesław royal regalia and a replica of the Holy Lance, which were later used at his coronation as the first King of Poland in , when Bolesław received permission for his coronation from Pope John XIX. Bolesław also expanded the realm considerably by seizing parts of German Lusatia, Czech Moravia, Upper Hungary, and southwestern regions of the Kievan Rus&#x27;.

The transition from paganism in Poland was not instantaneous and resulted in the pagan reaction of the 1030s. In 1031, Mieszko II Lambert lost the title of king and fled amidst the violence. The unrest led to the transfer of the capital to Kraków in 1038 by Casimir I the Restorer. In 1076, Bolesław II re-instituted the office of king, but was banished in 1079 for murdering his opponent, Bishop Stanislaus. In 1138, the country fragmented into five principalities when Bolesław III Wrymouth divided his lands among his sons. These were Lesser Poland, Greater Poland, Silesia, Masovia, and Sandomierz, with intermittent hold over Pomerania. In 1226, Konrad I of Masovia invited the Teutonic Knights to aid in combating the Baltic Prussians; a decision that later led to centuries of warfare with the Knights.

In the first half of the 13th century, Henry I the Bearded and Henry II the Pious aimed to unite the fragmented dukedoms, but the Mongol invasion and the death of Henry II in battle hindered the unification. As a result of the devastation which followed, depopulation and the demand for craft labour spurred a migration of German and Flemish settlers into Poland, which was encouraged by the Polish dukes. In 1264, the Statute of Kalisz introduced unprecedented autonomy for the Polish Jews, who came to Poland fleeing persecution elsewhere in Europe.

In 1320, Władysław I the Short became the first king of a reunified Poland since Przemysł II in 1296, and the first to be crowned at Wawel Cathedral in Kraków. Beginning in 1333, the reign of Casimir III the Great was marked by developments in castle infrastructure, army, judiciary and diplomacy. Under his authority, Poland transformed into a major European power; he instituted Polish rule over Ruthenia in 1340 and imposed quarantine that prevented the spread of Black Death. In 1364, Casimir inaugurated the University of Kraków, one of the oldest institutions of higher learning in Europe. Upon his death in 1370, the Piast dynasty came to an end. He was succeeded by his closest male relative, Louis of Anjou, who ruled Poland, Hungary, and Croatia in a personal union. Louis&#x27; younger daughter Jadwiga became Poland&#x27;s first female monarch in 1384.

=== The Golden Age ===

In 1386, Jadwiga of Poland entered a marriage of convenience with Władysław II Jagiełło, the Grand Duke of Lithuania, thus forming the Jagiellonian dynasty and the Polish–Lithuanian union which spanned the late Middle Ages and early Modern Era. The partnership between Poles and Lithuanians brought the vast multi-ethnic Lithuanian territories into Poland&#x27;s sphere of influence and proved beneficial for its inhabitants, who coexisted in one of the largest European political entities of the time.

In the Baltic Sea region, the struggle of Poland and Lithuania with the Teutonic Knights continued and culminated at the Battle of Grunwald in 1410, where a combined Polish-Lithuanian army inflicted a decisive victory against them. In 1466, after the Thirteen Years&#x27; War, king Casimir IV Jagiellon gave royal consent to the Peace of Thorn, which created the future Duchy of Prussia under Polish suzerainty and forced the Prussian rulers to pay tributes. The Jagiellonian dynasty also established dynastic control over the kingdoms of Bohemia (1471 onwards) and Hungary. In the south, Poland confronted the Ottoman Empire (at the Varna Crusade) and the Crimean Tatars, and in the east helped Lithuania to combat Russia.

Poland was developing as a feudal state, with a predominantly agricultural economy and an increasingly powerful landed nobility that confined the population to private manorial farmstead known as &quot;folwarks&quot;. In 1493, John I Albert sanctioned the creation of a bicameral parliament (the Sejm) composed of a lower house, the chamber of deputies, and an upper house, the chamber of senators. The &quot;Nihil novi&quot; act adopted by the Polish General Sejm in 1505, transferred most of the legislative power from the monarch to the parliament, an event which marked the beginning of the period known as Golden Liberty, when the state was ruled by the seemingly free and equal Polish nobles.

The 16th century saw Protestant Reformation movements making deep inroads into Polish Christianity, which resulted in the establishment of policies promoting religious tolerance, unique in Europe at that time. This tolerance allowed the country to avoid the religious turmoil and wars of religion that beset Europe. In Poland, Nontrinitarian Christianity became the doctrine of the so-called Polish Brethren, who separated from their Calvinist denomination and became the co-founders of global Unitarianism.

The European Renaissance evoked under Sigismund I the Old and Sigismund II Augustus a sense of urgency in the need to promote a cultural awakening. During the Polish Golden Age, the nation&#x27;s economy and culture flourished. The Italian-born Bona Sforza, daughter of the Duke of Milan and queen consort to Sigismund I, made considerable contributions to architecture, cuisine, language and court customs at Wawel Castle.

=== Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth ===

The Union of Lublin of 1569 established the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, a unified federal state with an elective monarchy that was largely governed by the nobility. The latter coincided with a period of prosperity. The Polish-dominated union thereafter became a leading power and a major cultural entity, exercising political control over parts of Central, Eastern, Southeastern and Northern Europe. The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth occupied approximately at its peak and was the largest state in Europe. Simultaneously, Poland imposed Polonisation policies in newly acquired territories which were met with resistance from ethnic and religious minorities.

In 1573, Henry de Valois of France, the first elected king, approbated the Henrician Articles which obliged future monarchs to respect the rights of nobles. When he left Poland to become King of France, his successor, Stephen Báthory, led a successful campaign in the Livonian War, granting Poland more lands across the eastern shores of the Baltic Sea. State affairs were then headed by Jan Zamoyski, the Crown Chancellor. Stephen&#x27;s successor, Sigismund III, defeated a rival Habsburg electoral candidate, Archduke Maximilian III, in the War of the Polish Succession (1587–1588). In 1592, Sigismund succeeded his father John Vasa, in Sweden. The Polish-Swedish union endured until 1599, when he was deposed by the Swedes.

In 1609, Sigismund invaded Russia which was engulfed in a civil war, and a year later the Polish winged hussar units under Stanisław Żółkiewski occupied Moscow for two years after defeating the Russians at Klushino. Sigismund also countered the Ottoman Empire in the southeast; at Khotyn in 1621 Jan Karol Chodkiewicz achieved a decisive victory against the Turks, which ushered the downfall of Sultan Osman II. Sigismund&#x27;s long reign in Poland coincided with the Silver Age. The liberal Władysław IV effectively defended Poland&#x27;s territorial possessions but after his death the vast Commonwealth began declining from internal disorder and constant warfare. 

In 1648, the Polish hegemony over Ukraine sparked the Khmelnytsky Uprising, followed by the decimating Swedish Deluge during the Second Northern War, and Prussia&#x27;s independence in 1657. In 1683, John III Sobieski re-established military prowess when he halted the advance of an Ottoman Army into Europe at the Battle of Vienna. The Saxon era, under Augustus II and Augustus III, saw neighboring powers grow in strength at the expense of Poland. Both Saxon kings faced opposition from Stanisław Leszczyński during the Great Northern War (1700) and the War of the Polish Succession (1733).

=== Partitions ===

The royal election of 1764 resulted in the elevation of Stanisław II Augustus Poniatowski to the monarchy. His candidacy was extensively funded by his sponsor and former lover, Empress Catherine II of Russia. The new king maneuvered between his desire to implement necessary modernising reforms, and the necessity to remain at peace with surrounding states. His ideals led to the formation of the 1768 Bar Confederation, a rebellion directed against the Poniatowski and all external influence, which ineptly aimed to preserve Poland&#x27;s sovereignty and privileges held by the nobility. The failed attempts at government restructuring as well as the domestic turmoil provoked its neighbours to invade.

In 1772, the First Partition of the Commonwealth by Prussia, Russia and Austria took place, an act which the Partition Sejm, under considerable duress, eventually ratified as a fait accompli. Disregarding the territorial losses, in 1773 a plan of critical reforms was established, in which the Commission of National Education, the first government education authority in Europe, was inaugurated. Corporal punishment of schoolchildren was officially prohibited in 1783. Poniatowski was the head figure of the Enlightenment, encouraged the development of industries, and embraced republican neoclassicism. For his contributions to the arts and sciences he was awarded a Fellowship of the Royal Society.

In 1791, Great Sejm parliament adopted the 3 May Constitution, the first set of supreme national laws, and introduced a constitutional monarchy. The Targowica Confederation, an organisation of nobles and deputies opposing the act, appealed to Catherine and caused the 1792 Polish–Russian War. Fearing the reemergence of Polish hegemony, Russia and Prussia arranged and in 1793 executed, the Second Partition, which left the country deprived of territory and incapable of independent existence. On 24 October 1795, the Commonwealth was partitioned for the third time and ceased to exist as a territorial entity. Stanisław Augustus, the last King of Poland, abdicated the throne on 25 November 1795.

=== Era of insurrections ===

The Polish people rose several times against the partitioners and occupying armies. An unsuccessful attempt at defending Poland&#x27;s sovereignty took place in the 1794 Kościuszko Uprising, where a popular and distinguished general Tadeusz Kościuszko, who had several years earlier served under George Washington in the American Revolutionary War, led Polish insurgents. Despite the victory at the Battle of Racławice, his ultimate defeat ended Poland&#x27;s independent existence for 123 years.

In 1806, an insurrection organised by Jan Henryk Dąbrowski liberated western Poland ahead of Napoleon&#x27;s advance into Prussia during the War of the Fourth Coalition. In accordance with the 1807 Treaty of Tilsit, Napoleon proclaimed the Duchy of Warsaw, a client state ruled by his ally Frederick Augustus I of Saxony. The Poles actively aided French troops in the Napoleonic Wars, particularly those under Józef Poniatowski who became Marshal of France shortly before his death at Leipzig in 1813. In the aftermath of Napoleon&#x27;s exile, the Duchy of Warsaw was abolished at the Congress of Vienna in 1815 and its territory was divided into Russian Congress Kingdom of Poland, the Prussian Grand Duchy of Posen, and Austrian Galicia with the Free City of Kraków.

In 1830, non-commissioned officers at Warsaw&#x27;s Officer Cadet School rebelled in what was the November Uprising. After its collapse, Congress Poland lost its constitutional autonomy, army and legislative assembly. During the European Spring of Nations, Poles took up arms in the Greater Poland Uprising of 1848 to resist Germanisation, but its failure saw duchy&#x27;s status reduced to a mere province; and subsequent integration into the German Empire in 1871. In Russia, the fall of the January Uprising (1863–1864) prompted severe political, social and cultural reprisals, followed by deportations and pogroms of the Polish-Jewish population. Towards the end of the 19th century, Congress Poland became heavily industrialised; its primary exports being coal, zinc, iron and textiles.

=== Second Polish Republic ===
In the aftermath of World War I, the Allies agreed on the reconstitution of Poland, confirmed through the Treaty of Versailles of June 1919. A total of 2 million Polish troops fought with the armies of the three occupying powers, and over 450,000 died. Following the armistice with Germany in November 1918, Poland regained its independence as the Second Polish Republic.

The Second Polish Republic reaffirmed its sovereignty after a series of military conflicts, most notably the Polish–Soviet War, when Poland inflicted a crushing defeat on the Red Army at the Battle of Warsaw.

The inter-war period heralded a new era of Polish politics. Whilst Polish political activists had faced heavy censorship in the decades up until World War I, a new political tradition was established in the country. Many exiled Polish activists, such as Ignacy Jan Paderewski, who would later become prime minister, returned home. A significant number of them then went on to take key positions in the newly formed political and governmental structures. Tragedy struck in 1922 when Gabriel Narutowicz, inaugural holder of the presidency, was assassinated at the Zachęta Gallery in Warsaw by a painter and right-wing nationalist Eligiusz Niewiadomski.

In 1926, the May Coup, led by the hero of the Polish independence campaign Marshal Józef Piłsudski, turned rule of the Second Polish Republic over to the nonpartisan Sanacja (&quot;Healing&quot;) movement to prevent radical political organisations on both the left and the right from destabilising the country. By the late 1930s, due to increased threats posed by political extremism inside the country, the Polish government became increasingly heavy-handed, banning a number of radical organisations, including communist and ultra-nationalist political parties, which threatened the stability of the country.

=== World War II ===

World War II began with the Nazi German invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939, followed by the Soviet invasion of Poland on 17 September. On 28 September 1939, Warsaw fell. As agreed in the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, Poland was split into two zones, one occupied by Nazi Germany, the other by the Soviet Union. In 1939–1941, the Soviets deported hundreds of thousands of Poles. The Soviet NKVD executed thousands of Polish prisoners of war (among other incidents in the Katyn massacre) ahead of Operation Barbarossa. German planners had in November 1939 called for &quot;the complete destruction of all Poles&quot; and their fate as outlined in the genocidal &quot;Generalplan Ost&quot;.

Poland made the fourth-largest troop contribution in Europe, and its troops served both the Polish Government in Exile in the west and Soviet leadership in the east. Polish troops played an important role in the Normandy, Italian, North African Campaigns and Netherlands and are particularly remembered for the Battle of Britain and Battle of Monte Cassino. Polish intelligence operatives proved extremely valuable to the Allies, providing much of the intelligence from Europe and beyond, Polish code breakers were responsible for cracking the Enigma cipher and Polish scientists participating in the Manhattan Project were co-creators of the American atomic bomb. In the east, the Soviet-backed Polish 1st Army distinguished itself in the battles for Warsaw and Berlin.

The wartime resistance movement, and the Armia Krajowa (&quot;Home Army&quot;), fought against German occupation. It was one of the three largest resistance movements of the entire war, and encompassed a range of clandestine activities, which functioned as an underground state complete with degree-awarding universities and a court system. The resistance was loyal to the exiled government and generally resented the idea of a communist Poland; for this reason, in the summer of 1944 it initiated Operation Tempest, of which the Warsaw Uprising that began on 1 August 1944 is the best-known operation.

Nazi German forces under orders from Adolf Hitler set up six German extermination camps in occupied Poland, including Treblinka, Majdanek and Auschwitz. The Germans transported millions of Jews from across occupied Europe to be murdered in those camps. Altogether, 3 million Polish Jews – approximately 90% of Poland&#x27;s pre-war Jewry – and between 1.8 and 2.8 million ethnic Poles were killed during the German occupation of Poland, including between 50,000 and 100,000 members of the Polish intelligentsia – academics, doctors, lawyers, nobility and priesthood. During the Warsaw Uprising alone, over 150,000 Polish civilians were killed, most were murdered by the Germans during the Wola and Ochota massacres. Around 150,000 Polish civilians were killed by Soviets between 1939 and 1941 during the Soviet Union&#x27;s occupation of eastern Poland (Kresy), and another estimated 100,000 Poles were murdered by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) between 1943 and 1944 in what became known as the Wołyń Massacres. Of all the countries in the war, Poland lost the highest percentage of its citizens: around 6 million perished – more than one-sixth of Poland&#x27;s pre-war population – half of them Polish Jews. About 90% of deaths were non-military in nature.

In 1945, Poland&#x27;s borders were shifted westwards. Over two million Polish inhabitants of Kresy were expelled along the Curzon Line by Stalin. The western border became the Oder-Neisse line. As a result, Poland&#x27;s territory was reduced by 20%, or . The shift forced the migration of millions of other people, most of whom were Poles, Germans, Ukrainians, and Jews.

=== Post-war communism ===
At the insistence of Joseph Stalin, the Yalta Conference sanctioned the formation of a new provisional pro-Communist coalition government in Moscow, which ignored the Polish government-in-exile based in London. This action angered many Poles who considered it a betrayal by the Allies. In 1944, Stalin had made guarantees to Churchill and Roosevelt that he would maintain Poland&#x27;s sovereignty and allow democratic elections to take place. However, upon achieving victory in 1945, the elections organised by the occupying Soviet authorities were falsified and were used to provide a veneer of legitimacy for Soviet hegemony over Polish affairs. The Soviet Union instituted a new communist government in Poland, analogous to much of the rest of the Eastern Bloc. As elsewhere in Communist Europe, the Soviet influence over Poland was met with armed resistance from the outset which continued into the 1950s.

Despite widespread objections, the new Polish government accepted the Soviet annexation of the pre-war eastern regions of Poland (in particular the cities of Wilno and Lwów) and agreed to the permanent garrisoning of Red Army units on Poland&#x27;s territory. Military alignment within the Warsaw Pact throughout the Cold War came about as a direct result of this change in Poland&#x27;s political culture. In the European scene, it came to characterise the full-fledged integration of Poland into the brotherhood of communist nations.

The new communist government took control with the adoption of the Small Constitution on 19 February 1947. The Polish People&#x27;s Republic (&quot;Polska Rzeczpospolita Ludowa&quot;) was officially proclaimed in 1952. In 1956, after the death of Bolesław Bierut, the régime of Władysław Gomułka became temporarily more liberal, freeing many people from prison and expanding some personal freedoms. Collectivisation in the Polish People&#x27;s Republic failed. A similar situation repeated itself in the 1970s under Edward Gierek, but most of the time persecution of anti-communist opposition groups persisted. Despite this, Poland was at the time considered to be one of the least oppressive states of the Eastern Bloc.

Labour turmoil in 1980 led to the formation of the independent trade union &quot;Solidarity&quot; (&quot;Solidarność&quot;), which over time became a political force. Despite persecution and imposition of martial law in 1981 by General Wojciech Jaruzelski, it eroded the dominance of the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party and by 1989 had triumphed in Poland&#x27;s first partially free and democratic parliamentary elections since the end of the Second World War. Lech Wałęsa, a Solidarity candidate, eventually won the presidency in 1990. The Solidarity movement heralded the collapse of communist regimes and parties across Europe.

=== Third Polish Republic ===
A shock therapy programme, initiated by Leszek Balcerowicz in the early 1990s, enabled the country to transform its Soviet-style planned economy into a market economy. As with other post-communist countries, Poland suffered temporary declines in social, economic, and living standards, but it became the first post-communist country to reach its pre-1989 GDP levels as early as 1995, although the unemployment rate increased. Poland became a member of the Visegrád Group in 1991, and joined NATO in 1999. Poles then voted to join the European Union in a referendum in June 2003, with Poland becoming a full member on 1 May 2004, following the consequent enlargement of the organisation.

Poland has joined the Schengen Area in 2007, as a result of which, the country&#x27;s borders with other member states of the European Union were dismantled, allowing for full freedom of movement within most of the European Union. On 10 April 2010, the President of Poland Lech Kaczyński, along with 89 other high-ranking Polish officials died in a plane crash near Smolensk, Russia.

In 2011, the ruling Civic Platform won parliamentary elections. In 2014, the Prime Minister of Poland, Donald Tusk, was chosen to be President of the European Council, and resigned as prime minister. The 2015 and 2019 elections were won by the national-conservative Law and Justice Party (PiS) led by Jarosław Kaczyński, resulting in increased Euroscepticism and increased friction with the European Union. In December 2017, Mateusz Morawiecki was sworn in as the Prime Minister, succeeding Beata Szydlo, in office since 2015. President Andrzej Duda, supported by Law and Justice party, was re-elected in the 2020 presidential election. 

, the Russian invasion of Ukraine had led to 17 million Ukrainian refugees crossing the border to Poland. , 0.9 million of those had stayed in Poland. In October 2023, the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party won the largest share of the vote in the election, but lost its majority in parliament. In December 2023, Donald Tusk became the new Prime Minister leading a coalition made up of Civic Coalition, Third Way, and The Left. Law and Justice became the leading opposition party.

== Geography ==

Poland covers an administrative area of , and is the ninth-largest country in Europe. Approximately of the country&#x27;s territory consists of land, is internal waters and is territorial sea. Topographically, the landscape of Poland is characterised by diverse landforms, water bodies and ecosystems. The central and northern region bordering the Baltic Sea lie within the flat Central European Plain, but its south is hilly and mountainous. The average elevation above the sea level is estimated at 173 metres.

The country has a coastline spanning ; extending from the shores of the Baltic Sea, along the Bay of Pomerania in the west to the Gulf of Gdańsk in the east. The beach coastline is abundant in sand dune fields or coastal ridges and is indented by spits and lagoons, notably the Hel Peninsula and the Vistula Lagoon, which is shared with Russia. The largest Polish island on the Baltic Sea is Wolin, located within Wolin National Park. Poland also shares the Szczecin Lagoon and the Usedom island with Germany.

The mountainous belt in the extreme south of Poland is divided into two major mountain ranges; the Sudetes in the west and the Carpathians in the east. The highest part of the Carpathian massif are the Tatra Mountains, extending along Poland&#x27;s southern border. Poland&#x27;s highest point is Mount Rysy at in elevation, located in the Tatras. The highest summit of the Sudetes massif is Mount Śnieżka at , shared with the Czech Republic. The lowest point in Poland is situated at Raczki Elbląskie in the Vistula Delta, which is below sea level.

Poland&#x27;s longest rivers are the Vistula, the Oder, the Warta, and the Bug. The country also possesses one of the highest densities of lakes in the world, numbering around ten thousand and mostly concentrated in the north-eastern region of Masuria, within the Masurian Lake District. The largest lakes, covering more than , are Śniardwy and Mamry, and the deepest is Lake Hańcza at in depth.

=== Climate ===
The climate of Poland is temperate transitional, and varies from oceanic in the north-west to continental in the south-east. The mountainous southern fringes are situated within an alpine climate. Poland is characterised by warm summers, with a mean temperature of around in July, and moderately cold winters averaging in December. The warmest and sunniest part of Poland is Lower Silesia in the southwest and the coldest region is the northeast corner, around Suwałki in Podlaskie province, where the climate is affected by cold fronts from Scandinavia and Siberia. Precipitation is more frequent during the summer months, with highest rainfall recorded from June to September.

There is a considerable fluctuation in day-to-day weather and the arrival of a particular season can differ each year. Climate change and other factors have further contributed to interannual thermal anomalies and increased temperatures; the average annual air temperature between 2011 and 2020 was , around 1.11 °C higher than in the 2001–2010 period. Winters are also becoming increasingly drier, with less sleet and snowfall.

=== Biodiversity ===

Phytogeographically, Poland belongs to the Central European province of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom. The country has four Palearctic ecoregions – Central, Northern, Western European temperate broadleaf and mixed forest, and the Carpathian montane conifer. Forests occupy 31% of Poland&#x27;s land area, the largest of which is the Lower Silesian Wilderness. The most common deciduous trees found across the country are oak, maple, and beech; the most common conifers are pine, spruce, and fir. An estimated 69% of all forests are coniferous.

The flora and fauna in Poland is that of Continental Europe, with the wisent, white stork and white-tailed eagle designated as national animals, and the red common poppy being the unofficial floral emblem. Among the most protected species is the European bison, Europe&#x27;s heaviest land animal, as well as the Eurasian beaver, the lynx, the gray wolf and the Tatra chamois. The region was also home to the extinct aurochs, the last individual dying in Poland in 1627. Game animals such as red deer, roe deer, and wild boar are found in most woodlands. Poland is also a significant breeding ground for migratory birds and hosts around one quarter of the global population of white storks.

Around , equivalent to 1% of Poland&#x27;s territory, is protected within 23 Polish national parks, two of which – Białowieża and Bieszczady – are UNESCO World Heritage Sites. There are 123 areas designated as landscape parks, along with numerous nature reserves and other protected areas under the Natura 2000 network.

== Government and politics ==

Poland is a unitary semi-presidential republic and a representative democracy, with a president as the head of state. The executive power is exercised further by the Council of Ministers and the prime minister who acts as the head of government. The council&#x27;s individual members are selected by the prime minister, approved by parliament and sworn in by the president. The head of state is elected by popular vote for a five-year term. The current president is Andrzej Duda and the prime minister is Donald Tusk.

Poland&#x27;s legislative assembly is a bicameral parliament consisting of a 460-member lower house (Sejm) and a 100-member upper house (Senate). The Sejm is elected under proportional representation according to the d&#x27;Hondt method for vote-seat conversion. The Senate is elected under the first-past-the-post electoral system, with one senator being returned from each of the one hundred constituencies. The Senate has the right to amend or reject a statute passed by the Sejm, but the Sejm may override the Senate&#x27;s decision with a majority vote.

With the exception of ethnic minority parties, only candidates of political parties receiving at least 5% of the total national vote can enter the Sejm. Both the lower and upper houses of parliament in Poland are elected for a four-year term and each member of the Polish parliament is guaranteed parliamentary immunity. Under current legislation, a person must be 21 years of age or over to assume the position of deputy, 30 or over to become senator and 35 to run in a presidential election.

Members of the Sejm and Senate jointly form the National Assembly of the Republic of Poland. The National Assembly, headed by the Sejm Marshal, is formed on three occasions – when a new president takes the oath of office; when an indictment against the president is brought to the State Tribunal; and in case a president&#x27;s permanent incapacity to exercise his duties due to the state of his health is declared.

=== Administrative divisions ===
Poland is divided into 16 provinces or states known as voivodeships. As of 2022, the voivodeships are subdivided into 380 counties (&quot;powiats&quot;), which are further fragmented into 2,477 municipalities (&quot;gminas&quot;). Major cities normally have the status of both &quot;gmina&quot; and &quot;powiat&quot;. The provinces are largely founded on the borders of historic regions, or named for individual cities. Administrative authority at the voivodeship level is shared between a government-appointed governor (voivode), an elected regional assembly (sejmik) and a voivodeship marshal, an executive elected by the assembly.

=== Law ===

The Constitution of Poland is the enacted supreme law, and Polish judicature is based on the principle of civil rights, governed by the code of civil law. The current democratic constitution was adopted by the National Assembly of Poland on 2 April 1997; it guarantees a multi-party state with freedoms of religion, speech and gatherings, prohibits the practices of forced medical experimentation, torture or corporal punishment, and acknowledges the inviolability of the home, the right to form trade unions, and the right to strike.

The judiciary in Poland is composed of the Supreme Court as the country&#x27;s highest judicial organ, the Supreme Administrative Court for the judicial control of public administration, Common Courts (District, Regional, Appellate) and the Military Court. The Constitutional and State Tribunals are separate judicial bodies, which rule the constitutional liability of people holding the highest offices of state and supervise the compliance of statutory law, thus protecting the Constitution. Judges are nominated by the National Council of the Judiciary and are appointed for life by the president. With the approval of the Senate, the Sejm appoints an ombudsman for a five-year term to guard the observance of social justice.

Poland has a low homicide rate at 0.7 murders per 100,000 people, as of 2018. Rape, assault and violent crime remain at a very low level. The country has imposed strict regulations on abortion, which is permitted only in cases of rape, incest or when the woman&#x27;s life is in danger; congenital disorder is not covered by the law, prompting some women to seek abortion abroad.

Historically, the most significant Polish legal act is the Constitution of 3 May 1791. Instituted to redress long-standing political defects of the federative Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and its Golden Liberty, it was the first modern constitution in Europe and influenced many later democratic movements across the globe. In 1918, the Second Polish Republic became one of the first countries to introduce universal women&#x27;s suffrage.

=== Foreign relations ===
Poland is a middle power and is transitioning into a regional power in Europe. It has a total of 53 representatives in the European Parliament as of 2024. Warsaw serves as the headquarters for Frontex, the European Union&#x27;s agency for external border security as well as ODIHR, one of the principal institutions of the OSCE. Apart from the European Union, Poland has been a member of NATO, the United Nations, and the WTO.

In recent years, Poland significantly strengthened its relations with the United States, thus becoming one of its closest allies and strategic partners in Europe. Historically, Poland maintained strong cultural and political ties to Hungary; this special relationship was recognised by the parliaments of both countries in 2007 with the joint declaration of 23 March as &quot;The Day of Polish-Hungarian Friendship&quot;.

=== Military ===

The Polish Armed Forces are composed of five branches – the Land Forces, the Navy, the Air Force, the Special Forces and the Territorial Defence Force. The military is subordinate to the Ministry of National Defence of the Republic of Poland. However, its commander-in-chief in peacetime is the president, who nominates officers, the Minister for National Defence and the chief of staff. Polish military tradition is generally commemorated by the Armed Forces Day, celebrated annually on 15 August. In July 2024, the Polish Armed Forces had a combined strength of 216,100 active soldiers, making it the largest standing army in the European Union and the third largest in NATO.

Poland ranks 14th in the world in terms of military expenditures; the country allocated 4.12% of its total GDP on military spending, equivalent to approximately US$35 billion in 2024. From 2022, Poland initiated a programme of mass modernisation of its armed forces, in close cooperation with American, South Korean and local Polish defence manufacturers. Also, the Polish military is set to increase its size to 250,000 enlisted and officers, and 50,000 defence force personnel. According to SIPRI, the country exported €487 million worth of arms and armaments to foreign countries in 2020.

Compulsory military service for men, who previously had to serve for nine months, was discontinued in 2008. Polish military doctrine reflects the same defensive nature as that of its NATO partners and the country actively hosts NATO&#x27;s military exercises. Since 1953, the country has been a large contributor to various United Nations peacekeeping missions, and currently maintains military presence in the Middle East, Africa, the Baltic states and southeastern Europe.

=== Security, law enforcement and emergency services ===

Law enforcement in Poland is performed by several agencies which are subordinate to the Ministry of Interior and Administration – the State Police (&quot;Policja&quot;), assigned to investigate crimes or transgression; the Municipal City Guard, which maintains public order; and several specialised agencies, such as the Polish Border Guard. Private security firms are also common, although they possess no legal authority to arrest or detain a suspect. Municipal guards are primarily headed by provincial, regional or city councils; individual guards are not permitted to carry firearms unless instructed by the superior commanding officer. Security service personnel conduct regular patrols in both large urban areas or smaller suburban localities.

The Internal Security Agency (ABW, or ISA in English) is the chief counterintelligence instrument safeguarding Poland&#x27;s internal security, along with Agencja Wywiadu (AW) which identifies threats and collects secret information abroad. The Central Investigation Bureau of Police (CBŚP) and the Central Anticorruption Bureau (CBA) are responsible for countering organised crime and corruption in state and private institutions.

Emergency services in Poland consist of the emergency medical services, search and rescue units of the Polish Armed Forces and State Fire Service. Emergency medical services in Poland are operated by local and regional governments, but are a part of the centralised national agency – the National Medical Emergency Service (&quot;Państwowe Ratownictwo Medyczne&quot;). Thanks to its location, Poland is a country essentially free from the threat of natural disasters such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tornadoes and tropical cyclones. However, floods have occurred in low-lying areas from time to time during periods of extreme rainfall, for example during the 2010 Central European floods.

== Economy ==

Poland is a social market economy and is the regional economic power for East-Central Europe. , the country&#x27;s gross domestic product (GDP) is the sixth largest in the European Union by nominal standards, and the fifth largest by purchasing power parity. It is one of the fastest growing within the Union and reached a developed market status in 2018. The unemployment rate published by Eurostat in 2023 amounted to 2.8%, which was the second-lowest in the EU. , around 62% of the employed population works in the service sector, 29% in manufacturing, and 8% in the agricultural sector, thus manifesting a highly diversified economy. Although Poland is a member of the European single market, the country has not adopted the Euro as legal tender and maintains its own currency – the Polish złoty (zł, PLN).

Poland is a regional European leader in terms of foreign direct investment and possesses around 40 percent of the 500 biggest companies in the region by revenues whilst maintaining a high globalisation rate and relatively high economic competitiveness. The country&#x27;s largest firms compose the WIG20 and WIG30 stock market indexes, which are traded on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. The Central Statistical Office estimated that in 2014 there were 1,437 Polish corporations with interests in 3,194 foreign entities. Poland also has the largest banking sector in Central Europe, with 32.3 branches per 100,000 adults. The monetary policy is determined by the National Bank of Poland (NBP), which controls the issuing of the national currency. It was the only European economy to have avoided the recession of 2008. Since 2019, workers under the age of 26 are exempt from paying the income tax.

The country is the 19th largest exporter of goods and services in the world. Exports of goods and services are valued at approximately 58% of GDP, as of 2023. Poland&#x27;s largest trade partners are Germany, the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and the United States. Among its lead exports are motor cars, buses, and vehicle-related accessories, machinery, electronics, electric batteries, home appliances, furniture, cosmetics, military equipment, and tobacco as well as materials such as silver, copper, steel, coal, zinc, tar, and coke. In 2023, the country produced 1300 tonnes of silver and was the 5th largest silver producer globally. As of 2024, Poland holds the world&#x27;s 12th largest gold reserve, estimated at 377 tonnes.

=== Tourism ===
In 2020, the total value of the tourism industry in Poland was 104.3 billion PLN, then equivalent to 4.5% of the Polish GDP. Tourism contributes considerably to the overall economy and makes up a relatively large proportion of the country&#x27;s service market. Nearly 200,000 people were employed in the accommodation and catering (hospitality) sector in 2020. In 2021, Poland ranked 12th most visited country in the world by international arrivals.

Tourist attractions in Poland vary, from the mountains in the south to the beaches in the north, with a trail of rich architectural and cultural heritage. Among the most recognisable landmarks are Old Towns in Kraków, Warsaw, Wrocław (dwarf statues), Gdańsk, Poznań, Lublin, Toruń and Zamość as well as museums, zoological gardens, theme parks and the Wieliczka Salt Mine, with its labyrinthine tunnels, underground lake and chapels carved by miners out of rock salt beneath the ground. There are over 100 castles in the country, largely within the Lower Silesian Voivodeship, and also on the Trail of the Eagles&#x27; Nests; the largest castle in the world by land area is situated in Malbork. The German Auschwitz concentration camp in Oświęcim, and the Skull Chapel in Kudowa-Zdrój constitute dark tourism. Regarding nature based travel, notable sites include the Masurian Lake District and Białowieża Forest in the east; on the south Karkonosze, the Table Mountains and the Tatra Mountains, where Rysy and the Eagle&#x27;s Path trail are located. The Pieniny and Bieszczady Mountains lie in the extreme south-east.

=== Transport ===

Transport in Poland is provided by means of rail, road, marine shipping and air travel. The country is part of EU&#x27;s Schengen Area and is an important transport hub due to its strategic geographical position in Central Europe. Some of the longest European routes, including the E30 and E40, run through Poland. The country has a good network of highways consisting of express roads and motorways. As of August 2023, Poland has the world&#x27;s 21st-largest road network, maintaining over of highways in use.

In 2022, the nation had of railway track, the third longest in the European Union after Germany and France. The Polish State Railways (PKP) is the dominant railway operator, with certain major voivodeships or urban areas possessing their own commuter and regional rail. Poland has a number of international airports, the largest of which is Warsaw Chopin Airport. It is the primary global hub for LOT Polish Airlines, the country&#x27;s flag carrier.

Seaports exist all along Poland&#x27;s Baltic coast, with most freight operations using Świnoujście, Police, Szczecin, Kołobrzeg, Gdynia, Gdańsk and Elbląg as their base. The Port of Gdańsk is the only port in the Baltic Sea adapted to receive oceanic vessels. Polferries and Unity Line are the largest Polish ferry operators, with the latter providing roll-on/roll-off and train ferry services to Scandinavia.

=== Energy ===

The electricity generation sector in Poland is largely fossil-fuel–based. Coal production in Poland is a major source of employment and the largest source of the nation&#x27;s greenhouse gas emissions. Many power plants nationwide use Poland&#x27;s position as a major European exporter of coal to their advantage by continuing to use coal as the primary raw material in the production of their energy. The three largest Polish coal mining firms (Węglokoks, Kompania Węglowa and JSW) extract around 100 million tonnes of coal annually. After coal, Polish energy supply relies significantly on oil—the nation is the third-largest buyer of Russian oil exports to the EU.

The new Energy Policy of Poland until 2040 (EPP2040) would reduce the share of coal and lignite in electricity generation by 25% from 2017 to 2030. The plan involves deploying new nuclear plants, increasing energy efficiency, and decarbonising the Polish transport system in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prioritise long-term energy security.

=== Science and technology ===

Over the course of history, the Polish people have made considerable contributions in the fields of science, technology and mathematics. Perhaps the most renowned Pole to support this theory was Nicolaus Copernicus (&quot;Mikołaj Kopernik&quot;), who triggered the Copernican Revolution by placing the Sun rather than the Earth at the centre of the universe. He also derived a quantity theory of money, which made him a pioneer of economics. Copernicus&#x27; achievements and discoveries are considered the basis of Polish culture and cultural identity. Poland was ranked 40th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024.

Poland&#x27;s tertiary education institutions; traditional universities, as well as technical, medical, and economic institutions, employ around tens of thousands of researchers and staff members. There are hundreds of research and development institutes. However, in the 19th and 20th centuries many Polish scientists worked abroad; one of the most important of these exiles was Marie Curie, a physicist and chemist who lived much of her life in France. In 1925, she established Poland&#x27;s Radium Institute.

In the first half of the 20th century, Poland was a flourishing centre of mathematics. Outstanding Polish mathematicians formed the Lwów School of Mathematics (with Stefan Banach, Stanisław Mazur, Hugo Steinhaus, Stanisław Ulam) and Warsaw School of Mathematics (with Alfred Tarski, Kazimierz Kuratowski, Wacław Sierpiński and Antoni Zygmund). Numerous mathematicians, scientists, chemists or economists emigrated due to historic vicissitudes, among them Benoit Mandelbrot, Leonid Hurwicz, Alfred Tarski, Joseph Rotblat and Nobel Prize laureates Roald Hoffmann, Georges Charpak and Tadeusz Reichstein.

== Demographics ==

Poland has a population of approximately 38.2 million as of 2021, and is the ninth-most populous country in Europe, as well as the fifth-most populous member state of the European Union. It has a population density of . The total fertility rate was estimated at 1.33 children born to a woman in 2021, which is among the world&#x27;s lowest. Furthermore, Poland&#x27;s population is aging significantly, and the country has a median age of 42.2.

Around 60% of the country&#x27;s population lives in urban areas or major cities and 40% in rural zones. In 2020, 50.2% of Poles resided in detached dwellings and 44.3% in apartments. The most populous administrative province or state is the Masovian Voivodeship and the most populous city is the capital, Warsaw, at 1.8 million inhabitants with a further 2–3 million people living in its metropolitan area. The metropolitan area of Katowice is the largest urban conurbation with a population between 2.7 million and 5.3 million residents. Population density is higher in the south of Poland and mostly concentrated between the cities of Wrocław and Kraków.

In the 2011 Polish census, 37,310,341 people reported Polish identity, 846,719 Silesian, 232,547 Kashubian and 147,814 German. Other identities were reported by 163,363 people (0.41%) and 521,470 people (1.35%) did not specify any nationality. Official population statistics do not include migrant workers who do not possess a permanent residency permit or Karta Polaka. More than 1.7 million Ukrainian citizens worked legally in Poland in 2017. The number of migrants is rising steadily; the country approved 504,172 work permits for foreigners in 2021 alone. According to the Council of Europe, 12,731 Romani people live in Poland.

=== Languages ===

Polish is the official and predominant spoken language in Poland, and is one of the official languages of the European Union. It is also a second language in parts of neighbouring Lithuania, where it is taught in Polish-minority schools. Contemporary Poland is a linguistically homogeneous nation, with 97% of respondents declaring Polish as their mother tongue. There are currently 15 minority languages in Poland, including one recognised regional language, Kashubian, which is spoken by approximately 100,000 people on a daily basis in the northern regions of Kashubia and Pomerania. Poland also recognises secondary administrative languages or auxiliary languages in bilingual municipalities, where bilingual signs and placenames are commonplace. According to the Centre for Public Opinion Research, around 32% of Polish citizens declared knowledge of the English language in 2015.

=== Religion ===

According to the 2021 census, 71.3% of all Polish citizens adhere to the Roman Catholic Church, with 6.9% identifying as having no religion and 20.6% refusing to answer.

Poland is one of the most religious countries in Europe, where Roman Catholicism remains a part of national identity and Polish-born Pope John Paul II is widely revered. In 2015, 61.6% of respondents outlined that religion is of high or very high importance. However, church attendance has greatly decreased in recent years; only 28% of Catholics attended mass weekly in 2021, down from around half in 2000. According to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;Of [the] more than 100 countries studied by the &quot;Pew Research Center&quot; in 2018, Poland was secularising the fastest, as measured by the disparity between the religiosity of young people and their elders.&quot;

Freedom of religion in Poland is guaranteed by the Constitution, and Poland&#x27;s concordat with the Holy See enables the teaching of religion in public schools. Historically, the Polish state maintained a high degree of religious tolerance and provided asylum for refugees fleeing religious persecution in other parts of Europe. Poland hosted Europe&#x27;s largest Jewish diaspora, and the country was a centre of Ashkenazi Jewish culture and traditional learning until the Holocaust.

Contemporary religious minorities include Orthodox Christians, Protestants, including Lutherans of the Evangelical-Augsburg Church, Pentecostals in the Pentecostal Church in Poland, Adventists in the Seventh-day Adventist Church, and other smaller Evangelical denominations, including Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, Eastern Catholics, Mariavites, Jews, Muslims (Tatars), and neopagans, some of whom are members of the Native Polish Church.

=== Health ===

Medical service providers and hospitals in Poland are subordinate to the Ministry of Health; it provides administrative oversight and scrutiny of general medical practice, and is obliged to maintain a high standard of hygiene and patient care. Poland has a universal healthcare system based on an all-inclusive insurance system; state subsidised healthcare is available to all citizens covered by the general health insurance programme of the National Health Fund (NFZ). Private medical complexes exist nationwide; over 50% of the population uses both public and private sectors.

According to the Human Development Report from 2020, the average life expectancy at birth is 79 years (around 75 years for an infant male and 83 years for an infant female); the country has a low infant mortality rate (4 per 1,000 births). In 2019, the principal cause of death was ischemic heart disease; diseases of the circulatory system accounted for 45% of all deaths. In the same year, Poland was also the 15th-largest importer of medications and pharmaceutical products.

=== Education ===

The Jagiellonian University founded in 1364 by Casimir III in Kraków was the first institution of higher learning established in Poland, and is one of the oldest universities still in continuous operation. Poland&#x27;s Commission of National Education (&quot;Komisja Edukacji Narodowej&quot;), established in 1773, was the world&#x27;s first state ministry of education. In 2018, the Programme for International Student Assessment, coordinated by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, placed Poland&#x27;s educational output as one of the highest in the OECD, ranking 5th by student attainment and 6th by student performance in 2022. The study showed that students in Poland perform better academically than in most OECD countries.

The framework for primary, secondary and higher tertiary education are established by the Ministry of Education and Science. One year of kindergarten is compulsory for six-year-olds. Primary education traditionally begins at the age of seven, although children aged six can attend at the request of their parents or guardians. Elementary school spans eight grades and secondary schooling is dependent on student preference – a four-year high school (&quot;liceum&quot;), a five-year technical school (&quot;technikum&quot;) or various vocational studies (&quot;szkoła branżowa&quot;) can be pursued by individual pupils. A liceum or technikum is concluded with a maturity exit exam (&quot;matura&quot;), which must be passed in order to apply for a university or other institutions of higher learning.

In Poland, there are over 500 university-level institutions, with numerous faculties. The University of Warsaw and Warsaw Polytechnic, the University of Wrocław, Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań and the University of Technology in Gdańsk are among the most prominent. There are three conventional academic degrees in Poland – &quot;licencjat&quot; or &quot;inżynier&quot; (first cycle), &quot;magister&quot; (second cycle) and &quot;doktor&quot; (third cycle qualification).

=== Ethnicity ===
Ethnic structure of Poland by voivodeship according to the censuses of 2002, 2011 and 2021:
== Culture ==
The culture of Poland is closely connected with its intricate 1,000-year history, and forms an important constituent in the Western civilisation. The Poles take great pride in their national identity which is often associated with the colours white and red, and exuded by the expression &quot;biało-czerwoni&quot; (&quot;whitereds&quot;). National symbols, chiefly the crowned white-tailed eagle, are often visible on clothing, insignia and emblems. The architectural monuments of great importance are protected by the National Heritage Board of Poland. Over 100 of the country&#x27;s most significant tangible wonders were enlisted onto the Historic Monuments Register, with further 17 being recognised by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites.

=== Holidays and traditions ===

There are 13 government-approved annual public holidays – New Year on 1 January, Three Kings&#x27; Day on 6 January, Easter Sunday and Easter Monday, Labour Day on 1 May, Constitution Day on 3 May, Pentecost, Corpus Christi, Feast of the Assumption on 15 August, All Saints&#x27; Day on 1 November, Independence Day on 11 November and Christmastide on 25 and 26 December.

Particular traditions and superstitious customs observed in Poland are not found elsewhere in Europe. Though Christmas Eve (&quot;Wigilia&quot;) is not a public holiday, it remains the most memorable day of the entire year. Trees are decorated on 24 December, hay is placed under the tablecloth to resemble Jesus&#x27; manger, Christmas wafers (&quot;opłatek&quot;) are shared between gathered guests and a twelve-dish meatless supper is served that same evening when the first star appears. An empty plate and seat are symbolically left at the table for an unexpected guest. On occasion, carolers journey around smaller towns with a folk Turoń creature until the Lent period.

A widely-popular doughnut and sweet pastry feast occurs on Fat Thursday, usually 52 days prior to Easter. Eggs for Holy Sunday are painted and placed in decorated baskets that are previously blessed by clergymen in churches on Easter Saturday. Easter Monday is celebrated with pagan &quot;dyngus&quot; festivities, where the youth is engaged in water fights. Cemeteries and graves of the deceased are annually visited by family members on All Saints&#x27; Day; tombstones are cleaned as a sign of respect and candles are lit to honour the dead on an unprecedented scale.

=== Music ===

Artists from Poland, including famous musicians such as Frédéric Chopin, Artur Rubinstein, Ignacy Jan Paderewski, Krzysztof Penderecki, Henryk Wieniawski, Karol Szymanowski, Witold Lutosławski, Stanisław Moniuszko and traditional, regionalised folk composers create a lively and diverse music scene, which even recognises its own music genres, such as sung poetry and disco polo.

The origins of Polish music can be traced to the 13th century; manuscripts have been found in Stary Sącz containing polyphonic compositions related to the Parisian Notre Dame School. Other early compositions, such as the melody of &quot;Bogurodzica&quot; and &quot;God Is Born&quot; (a coronation polonaise tune for Polish kings by an unknown composer), may also date back to this period, however, the first known notable composer, Nicholas of Radom, lived in the 15th century. Diomedes Cato, a native-born Italian who lived in Kraków, became a renowned lutenist at the court of Sigismund III; he not only imported some of the musical styles from southern Europe but blended them with native folk music.

In the 17th and 18th centuries, Polish baroque composers wrote liturgical music and secular compositions such as concertos and sonatas for voices or instruments. At the end of the 18th century, Polish classical music evolved into national forms like the polonaise. Wojciech Bogusławski is accredited with composing the first Polish national opera, titled &quot;Krakowiacy i Górale&quot;, which premiered in 1794.

Poland today has an active music scene, with the jazz and metal genres being particularly popular among the contemporary populace. Polish jazz musicians such as Krzysztof Komeda created a unique style, which was most famous in the 1960s and 1970s and continues to be popular to this day. Poland has also become a major venue for large-scale music festivals, chief among which are the Pol&#x27;and&#x27;Rock Festival, Open&#x27;er Festival, Opole Festival and Sopot Festival.

=== Art ===

Art in Poland has invariably reflected European trends, with Polish painting pivoted on folklore, Catholic themes, historicism and realism, but also on Impressionism and romanticism. An important art movement was Young Poland, developed in the late 19th century for promoting decadence, symbolism and Art Nouveau. Since the 20th century Polish documentary art and photography has enjoyed worldwide fame, especially the Polish School of Posters. One of the most distinguished paintings in Poland is &quot;Lady with an Ermine&quot; (1490) by Leonardo da Vinci.

Internationally renowned Polish artists include Jan Matejko (historicism), Jacek Malczewski (symbolism), Stanisław Wyspiański (art nouveau), Henryk Siemiradzki (Roman academic art), Tamara de Lempicka (art deco), and Zdzisław Beksiński (dystopian surrealism). Several Polish artists and sculptors were also acclaimed representatives of avant-garde, constructivist, minimalist and contemporary art movements, including Katarzyna Kobro, Władysław Strzemiński, Magdalena Abakanowicz, Alina Szapocznikow, Igor Mitoraj and Wilhelm Sasnal.

Notable art academies in Poland include the Kraków Academy of Fine Arts, Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw, Art Academy of Szczecin, University of Fine Arts in Poznań and the Geppert Academy of Fine Arts in Wrocław. Contemporary works are exhibited at Zachęta, Ujazdów, and MOCAK art galleries.

=== Architecture ===

The architecture of Poland reflects European architectural styles, with strong historical influences derived from Italy, Germany, and the Low Countries. Settlements founded on Magdeburg Law evolved around central marketplaces (&quot;plac&quot;, &quot;rynek&quot;), encircled by a grid or concentric network of streets forming an old town (&quot;stare miasto&quot;). Poland&#x27;s traditional landscape is characterised by ornate churches, city tenements and town halls. Cloth hall markets (&quot;sukiennice&quot;) were once an abundant feature of Polish urban architecture. The mountainous south is known for its Zakopane chalet style, which originated in Poland.

The earliest architectonic trend was Romanesque ( 11th century), but its traces in the form of circular rotundas are scarce. The arrival of brick Gothic ( 13th century) defined Poland&#x27;s most distinguishable medieval style, exuded by the castles of Malbork, Lidzbark, Gniew and Kwidzyn as well as the cathedrals of Gniezno, Gdańsk, Wrocław, Frombork and Kraków. The Renaissance (16th century) gave rise to Italianate courtyards, defensive palazzos and mausoleums. Decorative attics with pinnacles and arcade loggias are elements of Polish Mannerism, found in Poznań, Lublin and Zamość. Foreign artisans often came at the expense of kings or nobles, whose palaces were built thereafter in the Baroque, Neoclassical and Revivalist styles (17th–19th century).

Primary building materials timber and red brick were used extensively in Polish folk architecture, and the concept of a fortified church was commonplace. Secular structures such as &quot;dworek&quot; manor houses, farmsteads, granaries, mills and country inns are still present in some regions or in open air museums (&quot;skansen&quot;). However, traditional construction methods faded in the early-mid 20th century due to urbanisation and the construction of functionalist housing estates and residential areas.

=== Literature ===

The literary works of Poland have traditionally concentrated around the themes of patriotism, spirituality, social allegories and moral narratives. The earliest examples of Polish literature, written in Latin, date to the 12th century. The first Polish phrase &quot;Day ut ia pobrusa, a ti poziwai&quot; (officially translated as &quot;Let me, I shall grind, and you take a rest&quot;) was documented in the Book of Henryków and reflected the use of a quern-stone. It has been since included in UNESCO&#x27;s Memory of World Register. The oldest extant manuscripts of fine prose in Old Polish are the Holy Cross Sermons and the Bible of Queen Sophia, and Calendarium cracoviense (1474) is Poland&#x27;s oldest surviving print.

The poets Jan Kochanowski and Nicholas Rey became the first Renaissance authors to write in Polish. Prime literarians of the period included Dantiscus, Modrevius, Goslicius, Sarbievius and theologian John Laski. In the Baroque era, Jesuit philosophy and local culture greatly influenced the literary techniques of Jan Andrzej Morsztyn (Marinism) and Jan Chryzostom Pasek (sarmatian memoirs). During the Enlightenment, playwright Ignacy Krasicki composed the first Polish-language novel. Poland&#x27;s leading 19th-century romantic poets were the Three Bards – Juliusz Słowacki, Zygmunt Krasiński and Adam Mickiewicz, whose epic poem &quot;Pan Tadeusz&quot; (1834) is a national classic. In the 20th century, the English impressionist and early modernist writings of Joseph Conrad made him one of the most eminent novelists of all time.

Contemporary Polish literature is versatile, with its fantasy genre having been particularly praised. The philosophical sci-fi novel &quot;Solaris&quot; by Stanisław Lem and &quot;The Witcher&quot; series by Andrzej Sapkowski are celebrated works of world fiction. Poland has six Nobel-Prize winning authors – Henryk Sienkiewicz (&quot;Quo Vadis&quot;; 1905), Władysław Reymont (&quot;The Peasants&quot;; 1924), Isaac Bashevis Singer (1978), Czesław Miłosz (1980), Wisława Szymborska (1996), and Olga Tokarczuk (2018).

=== Cuisine ===

The cuisine of Poland is eclectic and shares similarities with other regional cuisines. Among the staple or regional dishes are pierogi (filled dumplings), kielbasa (sausage), bigos (hunter&#x27;s stew), kotlet schabowy (breaded cutlet), gołąbki (cabbage rolls), barszcz (borscht), żurek (soured rye soup), oscypek (smoked cheese), and tomato soup. Bagels, a type of bread roll, also originated in Poland.

Traditional dishes are hearty and abundant in pork, potatoes, eggs, cream, mushrooms, regional herbs, and sauce. Polish food is characteristic for its various kinds of kluski (soft dumplings), soups, cereals and a variety of breads and open sandwiches. Salads, including mizeria (cucumber salad), coleslaw, sauerkraut, carrot and seared beets, are common. Meals conclude with a dessert such as sernik (cheesecake), makowiec (poppy seed roll), or napoleonka (mille-feuille) cream pie.

Traditional alcoholic beverages include honey mead, widespread since the 13th century, beer, wine and vodka. The world&#x27;s first written mention of vodka originates from Poland. The most popular alcoholic drinks at present are beer and wine which took over from vodka more popular in the years 1980–1998. Grodziskie, sometimes referred to as &quot;Polish Champagne&quot;, is an example of a historical beer style from Poland. Tea remains common in Polish society since the 19th century, whilst coffee is drunk widely since the 18th century.

=== Fashion and design ===

Several Polish designers and stylists left a legacy of beauty inventions and cosmetics; including Helena Rubinstein and Maksymilian Faktorowicz, who created a line of cosmetics company in California known as Max Factor and formulated the term &quot;make-up&quot; which is now widely used as an alternative for describing cosmetics. Faktorowicz is also credited with inventing modern eyelash extensions. As of 2020, Poland possesses the sixth-largest cosmetic market in Europe. Inglot Cosmetics is the country&#x27;s largest beauty products manufacturer, and the retail store Reserved is the country&#x27;s most successful clothing store chain.

Historically, fashion has been an important aspect of Poland&#x27;s national consciousness or cultural manifestation, and the country developed its own style known as Sarmatism at the turn of the 17th century. The national dress and etiquette of Poland also reached the court at Versailles, where French dresses inspired by Polish garments included &quot;robe à la polonaise&quot; and the witzchoura. The scope of influence also entailed furniture; rococo Polish beds with canopies became fashionable in French châteaus. Sarmatism eventually faded in the wake of the 18th century.

=== Cinema ===

The cinema of Poland traces its origins to 1894, when inventor Kazimierz Prószyński patented the Pleograph and subsequently the Aeroscope, the first successful hand-held operated film camera. In 1897, Jan Szczepanik constructed the Telectroscope, a prototype of television transmitting images and sounds. They are both recognised as pioneers of cinematography. Poland has also produced influential directors, film producers and actors, many of whom were active in Hollywood, chiefly Roman Polański, Andrzej Wajda, Pola Negri, Samuel Goldwyn, the Warner brothers, Max Fleischer, Agnieszka Holland, Krzysztof Zanussi and Krzysztof Kieślowski.

The themes commonly explored in Polish cinema include history, drama, war, culture and black realism (film noir). In the 21st-century, two Polish productions won the Academy Awards – &quot;The Pianist&quot; (2002) by Roman Polański and &quot;Ida&quot; (2013) by Paweł Pawlikowski. Polish cinematography also created many well-received comedies. The most known of them were made by Stanisław Bareja and Juliusz Machulski.

=== Media ===
According to the Eurobarometer Report (2015), 78 percent of Poles watch the television daily. In 2020, 79 percent of the population read the news more than once a day, placing it second behind Sweden. Poland has a number of major domestic media outlets, chiefly the public broadcasting corporation TVP, free-to-air channels TVN and Polsat as well as 24-hour news channels TVP Info, TVN 24 and Polsat News. Public television extends its operations to genre-specific programmes such as TVP Sport, TVP Historia, TVP Kultura, TVP Rozrywka, TVP Seriale and TVP Polonia, the latter a state-run channel dedicated to the transmission of Polish-language telecasts for the Polish diaspora. In 2020, the most popular types of newspapers were tabloids and socio-political news dailies.

Poland is a major European hub for video game developers and among the most successful companies are CD Projekt, Techland, The Farm 51, CI Games and People Can Fly. Some of the popular video games developed in Poland include &quot;The Witcher&quot; trilogy and &quot;Cyberpunk 2077&quot;. The Polish city of Katowice also hosts Intel Extreme Masters, one of the biggest esports events in the world.

=== Sports ===
Motorcycle Speedway, volleyball and association football are among the country&#x27;s most popular sports, with a rich history of international competitions. Track and field, basketball, handball, boxing, MMA, ski jumping, cross-country skiing, ice hockey, tennis, fencing, swimming, and weightlifting are other popular sports.
The golden era of football in Poland occurred throughout the 1970s and went on until the early 1980s when the Polish national football team achieved their best results in any FIFA World Cup competitions finishing third place in the 1974 and the 1982 tournaments. The team won a gold medal in football at the 1972 Summer Olympics and two silver medals, in 1976 and in 1992. In 2012, Poland co-hosted the UEFA European Football Championship.

As of September 2024, the Polish men&#x27;s national volleyball team is ranked as first in the world. The team won a gold medal at the 1976 Summer Olympics and the gold medal at the FIVB World Championship 1974, 2014 and 2018.
Mariusz Pudzianowski is a highly successful strongman competitor and has won more World&#x27;s Strongest Man titles than any other competitor in the world, winning the event in 2008 for the fifth time.

Poland has made a distinctive mark in motorcycle speedway racing. The top Ekstraliga division has one of the highest average attendances for any sport in Poland. The national speedway team of Poland is one of the major teams in international speedway. Individually, Poland has three Speedway Grand Prix World Champions, with the most successful being five-time World Champion Bartosz Zmarzlik who won back-to-back championships in 2019 and 2020 as well as 2022, 2023 and 2024. In 2021, Poland finished runners-up in the Speedway of Nations world championship final, held in Manchester, England in 2021.

In the 21st century, the country has seen a growth of popularity of tennis and produced a number of successful tennis players including World No. 1 Iga Świątek, winner of five Grand Slam singles titles; former World No. 2 Agnieszka Radwanska, winner of 20 WTA career singles titles including 2015 WTA Finals; Top 10 ATP player Hubert Hurkacz; former World No. 1 doubles player Łukasz Kubot, winner of two Grand Slam doubles titles and Jan Zieliński, winner of two Grand Slam mixed doubles titles. Poland also won the 2015 Hopman Cup with Agnieszka Radwańska and Jerzy Janowicz representing the country.

Poles made significant achievements in mountaineering, in particular, in the Himalayas and the winter ascending of the eight-thousanders (e.g. Jerzy Kukuczka, Krzysztof Wielicki, Wanda Rutkiewicz). Polish mountains are one of the tourist attractions of the country. Hiking, climbing, skiing and mountain biking and attract numerous tourists every year from all over the world. Water sports are the most popular summer recreation activities, with ample locations for fishing, canoeing, kayaking, sailing and windsurfing especially in the northern regions of the country.

<text>The performing arts are arts such as music, dance, and drama which are performed for an audience. They are different from the visual arts, which involve the use of paint, canvas or various materials to create physical or static art objects. Performing arts include a range of disciplines which are performed in front of a live audience, including theatre, music, and dance.

Theatre, music, gymnastics, object manipulation, and other kinds of performances are present in all human cultures. The history of music and dance date to pre-historic times whereas circus skills date to at least Ancient Egypt. Many performing arts are performed professionally. Performance can be in purpose-built buildings, such as theatres and opera houses; on open air stages at festivals; on stages in tents, as in circuses; or on the street.

Live performances before an audience are a form of entertainment. The development of audio and video recording has allowed for private consumption of the performing arts. The performing arts often aim to express emotions or feelings.

==Performers==
Artists who participate in performing arts in front of an audience are called performers. Examples of these include actors, comedians, dancers, magicians, circus artists, musicians, and singers. Performing arts are also supported by workers in related fields, such as songwriting, choreography and stagecraft. Performers often adapt their appearance, such as with costumes and stage makeup, stage lighting, and sound.

==Types==
Performing arts may include dance, music, opera, theatre and musical theatre, magic, illusion, mime, spoken word, puppetry, circus arts, stand-up comedy, improv, professional wrestling and performance art.

There is also a specialized form of fine art, in which the artists &quot;perform&quot; their work live to an audience. This is called performance art. Most performance art also involves some form of plastic art, perhaps in the creation of props. Dance was often referred to as a plastic art during the modern dance era.

===Theatre===

Theatre is the branch of performing arts concerned with acting out stories in front of an audience, using a combination of speech, gesture, music, dance, sound, and spectacle. Any one or more of these elements is considered performing arts. In addition to the standard narrative dialogue style of plays, theater takes such forms as plays, musicals, opera, ballet, illusion, mime, classical Indian dance, kabuki, mummers&#x27; plays, improvisational theatre, comedy, pantomime, and non-conventional or contemporary forms like postmodern theatre, postdramatic theatre, or performance art.

===Dance===
In the context of performing arts, dance generally refers to human movement, typically rhythmic and to music, used as a form of audience entertainment in a performance setting. Definitions of what constitutes dance are dependent on social, cultural, aesthetic, artistic, and moral constraints and range from functional movement (such as folk dance) to codified, virtuoso techniques such as ballet.

There is one another modern form of dance that emerged in 19th- 20th century with the name of free dance style. This form of dance was structured to create a harmonious personality which included features such as physical and spiritual freedom. Isadora Duncan was the first female dancer who argued about &quot;woman of future&quot; and developed novel vector of choreography using Nietzsche&#x27;s idea of &quot;supreme mind in free mind&quot;.

Dance is a powerful impulse, but the art of dance is that impulse channeled by skillful performers into something that becomes intensely expressive and that may delight spectators who feel no wish to dance themselves. These two concepts of the art of dance—dance as a powerful impulse and dance as a skillfully choreographed art practiced largely by a professional few—are the two most important connecting ideas running through any consideration of the subject. In dance, the connection between the two concepts is stronger than in some other arts, and neither can exist without the other.

Choreography is the art of making dances, and the person who practices this art is called a choreographer.

===Music===

Music is an art form which combines pitch, rhythm, and dynamic to create sound. It can be performed using a variety of instruments and styles and is divided into genres such as folk, jazz, hip hop, pop, and rock, etc. As an art form, music can occur in live or recorded formats, and can be planned or improvised.

As music is a protean art, it easily coordinates with words for songs as physical movements do in dance. Moreover, it has a capability of shaping human behaviors as it impacts our emotions.

==History== 
===Western performing arts===

Starting in the 6th century BC, the Classical period of performing art began in Greece, ushered in by the tragic poets such as Sophocles. These poets wrote plays which, in some cases, incorporated dance (see Euripides). The Hellenistic period began the widespread use of comedy.

However, by the 6th century AD, Western performing arts had been largely ended as the Dark Ages began. Between the 9th century and 14th century, performing art in the West was limited to religious historical enactments and morality plays, organized by the Church in celebration of holy days and other important events.

====Renaissance====
In the 15th century performing arts, along with the arts in general, saw a revival as the Renaissance began in Italy and spread throughout Europe plays, some of which incorporated dance, which were performed and Domenico da Piacenza credited with the first use of the term &quot;ballo&quot; (in &quot;De Arte Saltandi et Choreas Ducendi&quot;) instead of &quot;danza&quot; (dance) for his &quot;baletti&quot; or &quot;balli&quot;. The term eventually became &quot;Ballet&quot;. The first Ballet &quot;per se&quot; is thought to be Balthasar de Beaujoyeulx&#x27;s Ballet Comique de la Reine (1581).
By the mid-16th century Commedia Dell&#x27;arte became popular in Europe, introducing the use of improvisation. This period also introduced the Elizabethan masque, featuring music, dance and elaborate costumes as well as professional theatrical companies in England. William Shakespeare&#x27;s plays in the late 16th century developed from this new class of professional performance.

In 1597, the first opera, Dafne was performed and throughout the 17th century, opera would rapidly become the entertainment of choice for the aristocracy in most of Europe, and eventually for large numbers of people living in cities and towns throughout Europe.

====Modern era====

The introduction of the proscenium arch in Italy during the 17th century established the traditional theatre form that persists to this day. Meanwhile, in England, the Puritans forbade acting, bringing a halt to performing arts that lasted until 1660. After that, women began to appear in both French and English plays. The French introduced a formal dance instruction in the late 17th century.

It is also during this time that the first plays were performed in the American Colonies.

During the 18th century, the introduction of the popular opera buffa brought opera to the masses as an accessible form of performance. Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; and &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; are landmarks of the late 18th century opera.

At the turn of the 19th century, Beethoven and the Romantic movement ushered in a new era that led first to the spectacles of grand opera and then to the musical dramas of Giuseppe Verdi and the &quot;Gesamtkunstwerk&quot; (total work of art) of the operas of Richard Wagner leading directly to the music of the 20th century.
The 19th century was a period of growth for the performing arts for all social classes, technical advances such as the introduction of gaslight to theatres, burlesque, minstrel dancing, and variety theatre. In ballet, women make great progress in the previously male-dominated art.

Modern dance began in the late 19th century and early 20th century in response to the restrictions of traditional ballet.
The arrival of Sergei Diaghilev&#x27;s Ballets Russes (1909–1929) revolutionized ballet and the performing arts generally throughout the Western world, most importantly through Diaghilev&#x27;s emphasis on collaboration, which brought choreographers, dancers, set designers/artists, composers and musicians together to revitalize and revolutionize ballet. It is extremely complex.

Konstantin Stanislavski&#x27;s &quot;System&quot; revolutionized acting in the early 20th century, and continues to have a major influence on actors of stage and screen to the current day. Both impressionism and modern realism were introduced to the stage during this period.

With the invention of the motion picture in the late 19th century by Thomas Edison and the growth of the motion picture industry in Hollywood in the early 20th century, film became a dominant performance medium throughout the 20th and 21st centuries.

Rhythm and blues, a cultural phenomenon of black America, rose to prominence in the early 20th century, influencing a range of later popular music styles internationally.

In the 1930s Jean Rosenthal introduced what would become modern stage lighting, changing the nature of the stage as the Broadway musical became a phenomenon in the United States.

====Postwar====
Post-World War II performing arts were highlighted by the resurgence of both ballet and opera in the Western world.

Postmodernism dominated the performing arts during the 1970s and the 1980s.

=== African performing arts ===

Indigenous African performance traditions are rooted in ritual, storytelling, movement, and music. Performances were communal with the storytellers and audience interacting and participating in call and response, which is characterized by a vocalist singing a phrase that is then echoed or responded to with a new phrase by the other performers and/or audience. This ancient tradition is rooted in many African cultures.

==== North Africa ====
The earliest recorded theatrical event dates back to 2000 BC with the ceremonial plays of Ancient Egypt. The story of the god Osiris was performed annually at festivals throughout the civilization, marking the known beginning of a long relationship between theatre and religion. The Dramatic Ramesseum Papyrus, the oldest surviving illustrated papyrus details the performance during the Sed Festival and has been used as evidence of the birth of theatrical tradition, which western scholars often attribute to ancient Greece.

==== West Africa ====
A Griot is a West African oral historian who uses storytelling, poetry, and music to express the genealogies and historical narratives of the tribes they represent, often playing instruments such as the kora. This ancient profession is upheld in a position of community leadership.

=== Eastern performing arts ===

====West Asia====
The most popular forms of theater in the medieval Islamic world were puppet theatre (which included hand puppets, shadow plays and marionette productions) and live passion plays known as &quot;ta&#x27;ziya&quot;, where actors re-enact episodes from Muslim history. In particular, Shia Islamic plays revolved around the &quot;shaheed&quot; (martyrdom) of Ali&#x27;s sons Hasan ibn Ali and Husayn ibn Ali. It commonly refers to passion plays about the battle of Karbala and its prior and subsequent events. Sir Lewis Pelly begins the preface of his book about Ta&#x27;zieh maintaining that &quot;If the success of a drama is to be measured by the effects
which it produces upon the people for whom it is composed, or upon the audiences before whom it is represented, no play has ever surpassed the tragedy known in the Mussulman world as that of Hasan and Husain.&quot;
 Years later Peter Chelkowski, professor of Iranian and Islamic studies at NYU, chooses the same words for the beginning of his book &#x27;Ta`ziyeh, ritual and drama in Iran&#x27;.
Live secular plays were known as &quot;akhraja&quot;, recorded in medieval &quot;adab&quot; literature, though they were less common than puppetry and &quot;ta&#x27;ziya&quot; theater.
====Iran====

In Iran there are other forms of theatrical events such as &quot;Naghali&quot; or &quot;Naqqāli&quot; (story telling), &quot;Ta&#x27;zieh&quot;, &quot;ٰRu-Howzi&quot;, &quot;Siah-Bazi&quot;, &quot;Parde-Khani&quot;, and &quot;Mareke giri&quot;. Prior to the twentieth century, storytelling was the most recognized form of entertainment, although today, some forms still remain. One form, &quot;Naghali,&quot; was traditionally performed in coffeehouses where the storytellers, or &quot;Naghals (Naqqāls),&quot; only recited sections of a story at a time, thus retaining regular cliental. These stories were based on events of historical or religious importance and many referenced poetries from the Shahnameh. These stories were often altered to bond with the atmosphere or mood of the audience.

====India====


Folk theatre and dramatics can be traced to the religious ritualism of the Vedic peoples in the 2nd millennium BC. This folk theatre of the misty past was mixed with dance, food, ritualism, plus a depiction of events from daily life. The last element made it the origin of the classical theatre of later times. Many historians, notably D. D. Kosambi, Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya, Adya Rangacharaya, etc. have referred to the prevalence of ritualism amongst Indo-Aryan tribes in which some members of the tribe acted as if they were wild animals, and some others were the hunters. Those who acted as mammals like goats, buffaloes, reindeer, monkeys, etc. were chased by those playing the role of hunters.

Bharata Muni (fl. 5th–2nd century BC) was an ancient Indian writer best known for writing the &quot;Natya Shastra of Bharata&quot;, a theoretical treatise on Indian performing arts, including theatre, dance, acting, and music, which has been compared to Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Poetics&quot;. Bharata is often known as the father of Indian theatrical arts. His &quot;Natya Shastra&quot; seems to be the first attempt to develop the technique or rather art, of drama in a systematic manner. The Natya Shastra tells us not only what is to be portrayed in a drama, but how the portrayal is to be done. Drama, as Bharata Muni says, is the imitation of men and their doings (&quot;loka-vritti&quot;). As men and their doings have to be respected on the stage, so drama in Sanskrit is also known by the term &quot;rupaka&quot;, which means portrayal.

The &quot;Ramayana&quot; and &quot;Mahabharata&quot; can be considered the first recognized plays that originated in India. These epics provided the inspiration to the earliest Indian dramatists and they do it even today. Indian dramatists such as Bhāsa in the 2nd century BC wrote plays that were heavily inspired by the &quot;Ramayana&quot; and &quot;Mahabharata&quot;.

Kālidāsa in the 1st century BC, is arguably considered to be ancient India&#x27;s greatest dramatist. Three famous romantic plays written by Kālidāsa are the &quot;Mālavikāgnimitram&quot; (&quot;Mālavikā and Agnimitra&quot;), &quot;Vikramōrvaśīyam&quot; (&quot;Pertaining to Vikrama and Urvashi&quot;), and &quot;Abhijñānaśākuntala&quot; (&quot;The Recognition of Shakuntala&quot;). The last was inspired by a story in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and is the most famous. It was the first to be translated into English and German. In comparison to Bhāsa, who drew heavily from the epics, Kālidāsa can be considered an original playwright.

The next great Indian dramatist was Bhavabhuti (c. 7th century). He is said to have written the following three plays: &quot;Malati-Madhava&quot;, &quot;Mahaviracharita&quot; and &quot;Uttar Ramacharita&quot;. Among these three, the last two cover between them, the entire epic of &quot;Ramayana&quot;. The powerful Indian emperor Harsha (606–648) is credited with having written three plays: the comedy &quot;Ratnavali&quot;, &quot;Priyadarsika&quot;, and the Buddhist drama &quot;Nagananda&quot;. Many other dramatists followed during the Middle Ages.

There were many performing art forms in the southern part of India, Kerala is such a state with different such art forms like Koodiyattam, Nangyarkoothu, Kathakali, Chakyar koothu, Thirayattam and there were many prominent artists like Painkulam Raman Chakyar and others.

====China====

There are references to theatrical entertainments in China as early as 1500 BC during the Shang dynasty; they often involved music, clowning and acrobatic displays.

The Tang dynasty is sometimes known as &quot;The Age of 1000 Entertainments&quot;. During this era, Emperor Xuanzong formed an acting school known as the Children of the Pear Garden to produce a form of drama that was primarily musical.

During the Han Dynasty, shadow puppetry first emerged as a recognized form of theatre in China. There were two distinct forms of shadow puppetry, Cantonese southern and Pekingese northern. The two styles were differentiated by the method of making the puppets and the positioning of the rods on the puppets, as opposed to the type of play performed by the puppets. Both styles generally performed plays depicting great adventure and fantasy, rarely was this very stylized form of theatre used for political propaganda. Cantonese shadow puppets were the larger of the two. They were built using thick leather that created more substantial shadows. Symbolic color was also very prevalent; a black face represented honesty, a red one bravery. The rods used to control Cantonese puppets were attached perpendicular to the puppets&#x27; heads. Thus, they were not seen by the audience when the shadow was created. Pekingese puppets were more delicate and smaller. They were created out of thin, translucent leather usually taken from the belly of a donkey. They were painted with vibrant paints, thus they cast a very colorful shadow. The thin rods that controlled their movements were attached to a leather collar at the neck of the puppet. The rods ran parallel to the bodies of the puppet then turned at a ninety-degree angle to connect to the neck. While these rods were visible when the shadow was cast, they laid outside the shadow of the puppet; thus, they did not interfere with the appearance of the figure. The rods attached at the necks to facilitate the use of multiple heads with one body. When the heads were not being used, they were stored in a muslin book or fabric lined box. The heads were always removed at night. This was in keeping with the old superstition that if left intact, the puppets would come to life at night. Some puppeteers went so far as to store the heads in one book and the bodies in another, to further reduce the possibility of reanimating puppets. Shadow puppetry is said to have reached its highest point of artistic development in the 11th century before becoming a tool of the government.

In the Song dynasty, there were many popular plays involving acrobatics and music. These developed in the Yuan dynasty into a more sophisticated form with a four- or five-act structure. Yuan drama spread across China and diversified into numerous regional forms, the best known of which is Beijing Opera, which is still popular today.

====Thailand====

In Thailand, it has been a tradition from the Middle Ages to stage plays based on plots drawn from Indian epics. In particular, the theatrical version of Thailand&#x27;s national epic &quot;Ramakien&quot;, a version of the Indian &quot;Ramayana&quot;, remains popular in Thailand even today.

====Cambodia====
In Cambodia, inscriptions dating back to the 6th century AD indicates evidence of dancers at a local temple and using puppetry for religious plays. At the ancient capital Angkor Wat, stories from the Indian epics &quot;Ramayana&quot; and &quot;Mahabharata&quot; have been carved on the walls of temples and palaces. Similar reliefs are found at Borobudur in Indonesia.

====Philippines====
In the Philippines, the famous epic poem Ibong Adarna, originally titled &quot;Korido at Buhay na Pinagdaanan ng Tatlong Prinsipeng Magkakapatid na anak nina Haring Fernando at Reyna Valeriana sa Kahariang Berbania&quot; (English: &quot;Corrido and Life Lived by the Three Princes, children of King Fernando and Queen Valeriana in the Kingdom of Berbania&quot;) from the 16th century was written by José de la Cruz during the Spanish era. Aside from theatrical performances, different films were produced by different film studios/ television productions. The first produced &quot;Ang Ibong Adarna&quot; film was produced by LVN Pictures, the biggest film studio in the history of the Philippines.

Florante at Laura is an &quot;awit&quot; or a poem consisting of 12-syllable quatrains with the full title &quot;Pinagdaanang Buhay ni Florante at ni Laura sa Kahariang Albanya&quot; (English: &quot;The History of Florante and Laura in the Kingdom of Albania&quot;) was written by Francisco Balagtas in 1838 during his imprisonment dedicated to his sweetheart Maria Asuncuion Rivera (nicknamed &quot;M.A.R.&quot;, referenced to as &quot;Selya&quot;). The poem has a special part entitled &quot;Kay Selya&quot; (English: &quot;For Celia&quot;) specially dedicated for Rivera.

The Philippine&#x27;s national hero, José Rizal who is also a novelist, created the two famous poems in the Philippines, &quot;Noli Me Tángere&quot; (Latin for &quot;Touch me not&quot;, with an acute accent added on the final word in accordance with Spanish orthography) (1887) that describes perceived inequities of the Spanish Catholic friars and the ruling government and &quot;El Filibusterismo&quot; (translations: The filibusterism; The Subversive or The Subversion, as in the Locsín English translation, are also possible translations, also known by its alternative English title The Reign of Greed) (1891). The novel&#x27;s dark theme departs dramatically from the previous novel&#x27;s hopeful and romantic atmosphere, signifying Ibarra&#x27;s resort to solving his country&#x27;s issues through violent means, after his previous attempt in reforming the country&#x27;s system made no effect and seemed impossible with the corrupt attitude of the Spaniards toward the Filipinos. These novels were written during the colonization of the Philippines by the Spanish Empire.

All of these literary pieces were under the curriculum of the K-12 Program for Junior High Schools, Ibong Adarna is under the Grade 7 Curriculum; Florante at Laura (Grade 8); &quot;Noli Me Tángere&quot; (Grade 9); and El Filibusterismo (Grade 10).

====Japan====


During the 14th century, there were small companies of actors in Japan who performed short, sometimes vulgar comedies. A director of one of these companies, Kan&#x27;ami (1333–1384), had a son, Zeami Motokiyo (1363–1443), who was considered one of the finest child actors in Japan. When Kan&#x27;ami&#x27;s company performed for Ashikaga Yoshimitsu (1358–1408), the of Japan, he implored Zeami to have a court education for his arts. After Zeami succeeded his father, he continued to perform and adapt his style into what is today Noh. A mixture of pantomime and vocal acrobatics, the Noh style of theatre has become one of Japan&#x27;s most refined forms of theatrical performance.

Japan, after a long period of civil wars and political disarray, was unified and at peace primarily due to Tokugawa Ieyasu (1600–1668). However, alarmed at the increasing numbers of Christians within the country due to the proselytizing efforts of Christian missionaries, he cut off contact from Japan to Europe and China and outlawed Christianity. When peace did come, a flourish of cultural influence and growing merchant class demanded its own entertainment. The first form of theatre to flourish was Ningyō jōruri (commonly referred to as Bunraku). The founder of and main contributor to Ningyō jōruri, Chikamatsu Monzaemon (1653–1725), turned his form of theatre into a true art form. Ningyō jōruri is a highly stylized form of theatre using puppets, today about the size of a human. The men who control the puppets train to become master puppeteers, when they can then operate the puppet&#x27;s head and right arm and choose to show their faces during the performance. The other puppeteers, controlling the less important limbs of the puppet, cover themselves and their faces in a black suit, to imply their invisibility. The dialogue is handled by a single person, who uses varied tones of voice and speaking manners to simulate different characters. Chikamatsu wrote thousands of plays during his lifetime, most of which are still used today.

Kabuki began shortly after Bunraku, legend has it by an actress named Okuni, who lived around the end of the 16th century. Most of kabuki&#x27;s material came from Noh and Bunraku, and its erratic dance-type movements are also an effect of Bunraku. However, kabuki is less formal and more distant than Noh, yet very popular among the Japanese public. Actors are trained in many varied things including dancing, singing, pantomime, and even acrobatics. Kabuki was first performed by young girls, then by young boys, and by the end of the 16th century, kabuki companies consisted of all men. The men who portrayed women on stage were specifically trained to elicit the essence of a woman in their subtle movements and gestures.

Melanesian dance often exhibits a cultural theme of masculinity where leadership and a unique skill set are important for sharing with the community. These dances demonstrate the soldiery of a man; however they can also represent profitability such as encouraging conflict resolutions or healing. The costumes of impersonating dancers incorporate large masks and unhuman-like characteristics that act to imitate mythical figures. The music can also act as a voice for these magical personas.

<text>Physics is the scientific study of matter, its fundamental constituents, its motion and behavior through space and time, and the related entities of energy and force. Physics is one of the most fundamental scientific disciplines. A scientist who specializes in the field of physics is called a physicist.

Physics is one of the oldest academic disciplines. Over much of the past two millennia, physics, chemistry, biology, and certain branches of mathematics were a part of natural philosophy, but during the Scientific Revolution in the 17th century, these natural sciences branched into separate research endeavors. Physics intersects with many interdisciplinary areas of research, such as biophysics and quantum chemistry, and the boundaries of physics are not rigidly defined. New ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms studied by other sciences and suggest new avenues of research in these and other academic disciplines such as mathematics and philosophy.

Advances in physics often enable new technologies. For example, advances in the understanding of electromagnetism, solid-state physics, and nuclear physics led directly to the development of technologies that have transformed modern society, such as television, computers, domestic appliances, and nuclear weapons; advances in thermodynamics led to the development of industrialization; and advances in mechanics inspired the development of calculus.

==History==

The word &quot;physics&quot; comes from the Latin (&#x27;study of nature&#x27;), which itself is a borrowing of the Greek ( &#x27;natural science&#x27;), a term derived from ( &#x27;origin, nature, property&#x27;).

=== Ancient astronomy ===
Astronomy is one of the oldest natural sciences. Early civilizations dating before 3000 BCE, such as the Sumerians, ancient Egyptians, and the Indus Valley Civilisation, had a predictive knowledge and a basic awareness of the motions of the Sun, Moon, and stars. The stars and planets, believed to represent gods, were often worshipped. While the explanations for the observed positions of the stars were often unscientific and lacking in evidence, these early observations laid the foundation for later astronomy, as the stars were found to traverse great circles across the sky, which could not explain the positions of the planets.

According to Asger Aaboe, the origins of Western astronomy can be found in Mesopotamia, and all Western efforts in the exact sciences are descended from late Babylonian astronomy. Egyptian astronomers left monuments showing knowledge of the constellations and the motions of the celestial bodies, while Greek poet Homer wrote of various celestial objects in his &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot;; later Greek astronomers provided names, which are still used today, for most constellations visible from the Northern Hemisphere.

=== Natural philosophy ===

Natural philosophy has its origins in Greece during the Archaic period (650 BCE – 480 BCE), when pre-Socratic philosophers like Thales rejected non-naturalistic explanations for natural phenomena and proclaimed that every event had a natural cause. They proposed ideas verified by reason and observation, and many of their hypotheses proved successful in experiment; for example, atomism was found to be correct approximately 2000 years after it was proposed by Leucippus and his pupil Democritus.

=== Aristotle and Hellenistic physics ===

During the classical period in Greece (6th, 5th and 4th centuries BCE) and in Hellenistic times, natural philosophy developed along many lines of inquiry. Aristotle (, &quot;Aristotélēs&quot;) (384–322 BCE), a student of Plato,
wrote on many subjects, including a substantial treatise on &quot;Physics&quot; – in the 4th century BC. Aristotelian physics was influential for about two millennia. His approach mixed some limited observation with logical deductive arguments, but did not rely on experimental verification of deduced statements. Aristotle&#x27;s foundational work in Physics, though very imperfect, formed a framework against which later thinkers further developed the field. His approach is entirely superseded today.

He explained ideas such as motion (and gravity) with the theory of four elements.
Aristotle believed that each of the four classical elements (air, fire, water, earth) had its own natural place. Because of their differing densities, each element will revert to its own specific place in the atmosphere. So, because of their weights, fire would be at the top, air underneath fire, then water, then lastly earth. He also stated that when a small amount of one element enters the natural place of another, the less abundant element will automatically go towards its own natural place. For example, if there is a fire on the ground, the flames go up into the air in an attempt to go back into its natural place where it belongs. His laws of motion included: that heavier objects will fall faster, the speed being proportional to the weight and the speed of the object that is falling depends inversely on the density object it is falling through (e.g. density of air). He also stated that, when it comes to violent motion (motion of an object when a force is applied to it by a second object) that the speed that object moves, will only be as fast or strong as the measure of force applied to it. The problem of motion and its causes was studied carefully, leading to the philosophical notion of a &quot;prime mover&quot; as the ultimate source of all motion in the world (Book 8 of his treatise &quot;Physics&quot;).

=== Medieval European and Islamic ===


The Western Roman Empire fell to invaders and internal decay in the fifth century, resulting in a decline in intellectual pursuits in western Europe. By contrast, the Eastern Roman Empire (usually known as the Byzantine Empire) resisted the attacks from invaders and continued to advance various fields of learning, including physics. In the sixth century, John Philoponus challenged the dominant Aristotelian approach to science although much of his work was focused on Christian theology.

In the sixth century, Isidore of Miletus created an important compilation of Archimedes&#x27; works that are copied in the Archimedes Palimpsest.
Islamic scholarship inherited Aristotelian physics from the Greeks and during the Islamic Golden Age developed it further, especially placing emphasis on observation and &quot;a priori&quot; reasoning, developing early forms of the scientific method.

The most notable innovations under Islamic scholarship were in the field of optics and vision, which came from the works of many scientists like Ibn Sahl, Al-Kindi, Ibn al-Haytham, Al-Farisi and Avicenna. The most notable work was &quot;The Book of Optics&quot; (also known as Kitāb al-Manāẓir), written by Ibn al-Haytham, in which he presented the alternative to the ancient Greek idea about vision. His discussed his experiments with camera obscura, showing that light moved in a straight line; he encouraged readers to reproduce his experiments making him one of the originators of the scientific method

=== Scientific Revolution ===
Physics became a separate science when early modern Europeans used experimental and quantitative methods to discover what are now considered to be the laws of physics.

Major developments in this period include the replacement of the geocentric model of the Solar System with the heliocentric Copernican model, the laws governing the motion of planetary bodies (determined by Johannes Kepler between 1609 and 1619), Galileo&#x27;s pioneering work on telescopes and observational astronomy in the 16th and 17th centuries, and Isaac Newton&#x27;s discovery and unification of the laws of motion and universal gravitation (that would come to bear his name). Newton, and separately Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, developed calculus, the mathematical study of continuous change, and Newton applied it to solve physical problems.
=== 19th century ===

The discovery of laws in thermodynamics, chemistry, and electromagnetics resulted from research efforts during the Industrial Revolution as energy needs increased. By the end of the 19th century, theories of thermodynamics, mechanics, and electromagnetics matched a wide variety of observations. Taken together these theories became the basis for what would later be called classical physics.

A few experimental results remained inexplicable. Classical electromagnetism presumed a medium, an luminiferous aether to support the propagation of waves, but this medium could not be detected. The intensity of light from hot glowing blackbody objects did not match the predictions of thermodynamics and electromagnetism. The character of electron emission of illuminated metals differed from predictions. These failures, seemingly insignificant in the big picture would upset the physics world in first two decades of the 20th century.

=== 20th century ===


Modern physics began in the early 20th century with the work of Max Planck in quantum theory and Albert Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity. Both of these theories came about due to inaccuracies in classical mechanics in certain situations. Classical mechanics predicted that the speed of light depends on the motion of the observer, which could not be resolved with the constant speed predicted by Maxwell&#x27;s equations of electromagnetism. This discrepancy was corrected by Einstein&#x27;s theory of special relativity, which replaced classical mechanics for fast-moving bodies and allowed for a constant speed of light. Black-body radiation provided another problem for classical physics, which was corrected when Planck proposed that the excitation of material oscillators is possible only in discrete steps proportional to their frequency. This, along with the photoelectric effect and a complete theory predicting discrete energy levels of electron orbitals, led to the theory of quantum mechanics improving on classical physics at very small scales.

Quantum mechanics would come to be pioneered by Werner Heisenberg, Erwin Schrödinger and Paul Dirac. From this early work, and work in related fields, the Standard Model of particle physics was derived. Following the discovery of a particle with properties consistent with the Higgs boson at CERN in 2012, all fundamental particles predicted by the standard model, and no others, appear to exist; however, physics beyond the Standard Model, with theories such as supersymmetry, is an active area of research. Areas of mathematics in general are important to this field, such as the study of probabilities and groups.

==Core theories==

Physics deals with a wide variety of systems, although certain theories are used by all physicists. Each of these theories was experimentally tested numerous times and found to be an adequate approximation of nature.
These central theories are important tools for research into more specialized topics, and any physicist, regardless of their specialization, is expected to be literate in them. These include classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, electromagnetism, and special relativity.

===Distinction between classical and modern physics===


In the first decades of the 20th century physics was revolutionized by the discoveries of quantum mechanics and relativity. The changes were so fundamental that these new concepts became the foundation of &quot;modern physics&quot;, with other topics becoming &quot;classical physics&quot;. The majority of applications of physics are essentially classical. 
The laws of classical physics accurately describe systems whose important length scales are greater than the atomic scale and whose motions are much slower than the speed of light. Outside of this domain, observations do not match predictions provided by classical mechanics.
===Classical theory===
Classical physics includes the traditional branches and topics that were recognized and well-developed before the beginning of the 20th century—classical mechanics, thermodynamics, and electromagnetism. Classical mechanics is concerned with bodies acted on by forces and bodies in motion and may be divided into statics (study of the forces on a body or bodies not subject to an acceleration), kinematics (study of motion without regard to its causes), and dynamics (study of motion and the forces that affect it); mechanics may also be divided into solid mechanics and fluid mechanics (known together as continuum mechanics), the latter include such branches as hydrostatics, hydrodynamics and pneumatics. Acoustics is the study of how sound is produced, controlled, transmitted and received. Important modern branches of acoustics include ultrasonics, the study of sound waves of very high frequency beyond the range of human hearing; bioacoustics, the physics of animal calls and hearing, and electroacoustics, the manipulation of audible sound waves using electronics.

Optics, the study of light, is concerned not only with visible light but also with infrared and ultraviolet radiation, which exhibit all of the phenomena of visible light except visibility, e.g., reflection, refraction, interference, diffraction, dispersion, and polarization of light. Heat is a form of energy, the internal energy possessed by the particles of which a substance is composed; thermodynamics deals with the relationships between heat and other forms of energy. Electricity and magnetism have been studied as a single branch of physics since the intimate connection between them was discovered in the early 19th century; an electric current gives rise to a magnetic field, and a changing magnetic field induces an electric current. Electrostatics deals with electric charges at rest, electrodynamics with moving charges, and magnetostatics with magnetic poles at rest.

===Modern theory===
The discovery of relativity and of quantum mechanics in the first decades of the 20th century transformed the conceptual basis of physics without reducing the practical value of most of the physical theories developed up to that time. Consequently the topics of physics have come to be divided into &quot;classical physics&quot; and &quot;modern physics&quot;, with the latter category including effects related to quantum mechanics and relativity.
Classical physics is generally concerned with matter and energy on the normal scale of observation, while much of modern physics is concerned with the behavior of matter and energy under extreme conditions or on a very large or very small scale. For example, atomic and nuclear physics study matter on the smallest scale at which chemical elements can be identified. The physics of elementary particles is on an even smaller scale since it is concerned with the most basic units of matter; this branch of physics is also known as high-energy physics because of the extremely high energies necessary to produce many types of particles in particle accelerators. On this scale, ordinary, commonsensical notions of space, time, matter, and energy are no longer valid.

The two chief theories of modern physics present a different picture of the concepts of space, time, and matter from that presented by classical physics. Classical mechanics approximates nature as continuous, while quantum theory is concerned with the discrete nature of many phenomena at the atomic and subatomic level and with the complementary aspects of particles and waves in the description of such phenomena. The theory of relativity is concerned with the description of phenomena that take place in a frame of reference that is in motion with respect to an observer; the special theory of relativity is concerned with motion in the absence of gravitational fields and the general theory of relativity with motion and its connection with gravitation. Both quantum theory and the theory of relativity find applications in many areas of modern physics.

Fundamental concepts in modern physics include:
* Action
* Causality
* Covariance
* Particle
* Physical field
* Physical interaction
* Quantum
* Statistical ensemble
* Symmetry
* Wave

==Research==

===Scientific method===
Physicists use the scientific method to test the validity of a physical theory. By using a methodical approach to compare the implications of a theory with the conclusions drawn from its related experiments and observations, physicists are better able to test the validity of a theory in a logical, unbiased, and repeatable way. To that end, experiments are performed and observations are made in order to determine the validity or invalidity of a theory.

A scientific law is a concise verbal or mathematical statement of a relation that expresses a fundamental principle of some theory, such as Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation.

===Theory and experiment===


Theorists seek to develop mathematical models that both agree with existing experiments and successfully predict future experimental results, while experimentalists devise and perform experiments to test theoretical predictions and explore new phenomena. Although theory and experiment are developed separately, they strongly affect and depend upon each other. Progress in physics frequently comes about when experimental results defy explanation by existing theories, prompting intense focus on applicable modelling, and when new theories generate experimentally testable predictions, which inspire the development of new experiments (and often related equipment).

Physicists who work at the interplay of theory and experiment are called phenomenologists, who study complex phenomena observed in experiment and work to relate them to a fundamental theory.

Theoretical physics has historically taken inspiration from philosophy; electromagnetism was unified this way. Beyond the known universe, the field of theoretical physics also deals with hypothetical issues, such as parallel universes, a multiverse, and higher dimensions. Theorists invoke these ideas in hopes of solving particular problems with existing theories; they then explore the consequences of these ideas and work toward making testable predictions.

Experimental physics expands, and is expanded by, engineering and technology. Experimental physicists who are involved in basic research design and perform experiments with equipment such as particle accelerators and lasers, whereas those involved in applied research often work in industry, developing technologies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and transistors. Feynman has noted that experimentalists may seek areas that have not been explored well by theorists.

===Scope and aims===
Physics covers a wide range of phenomena, from elementary particles (such as quarks, neutrinos, and electrons) to the largest superclusters of galaxies. Included in these phenomena are the most basic objects composing all other things. Therefore, physics is sometimes called the &quot;fundamental science&quot;. Physics aims to describe the various phenomena that occur in nature in terms of simpler phenomena. Thus, physics aims to both connect the things observable to humans to root causes, and then connect these causes together.

For example, the ancient Chinese observed that certain rocks (lodestone and magnetite) were attracted to one another by an invisible force. This effect was later called magnetism, which was first rigorously studied in the 17th century. But even before the Chinese discovered magnetism, the ancient Greeks knew of other objects such as amber, that when rubbed with fur would cause a similar invisible attraction between the two. This was also first studied rigorously in the 17th century and came to be called electricity. Thus, physics had come to understand two observations of nature in terms of some root cause (electricity and magnetism). However, further work in the 19th century revealed that these two forces were just two different aspects of one force—electromagnetism. This process of &quot;unifying&quot; forces continues today, and electromagnetism and the weak nuclear force are now considered to be two aspects of the electroweak interaction. Physics hopes to find an ultimate reason (theory of everything) for why nature is as it is (see section &quot;Current research&quot; below for more information).

===Current research===


Research in physics is continually progressing on a large number of fronts.

In condensed matter physics, an important unsolved theoretical problem is that of high-temperature superconductivity. Many condensed matter experiments are aiming to fabricate workable spintronics and quantum computers.

In particle physics, the first pieces of experimental evidence for physics beyond the Standard Model have begun to appear. Foremost among these are indications that neutrinos have non-zero mass. These experimental results appear to have solved the long-standing solar neutrino problem, and the physics of massive neutrinos remains an area of active theoretical and experimental research. The Large Hadron Collider has already found the Higgs boson, but future research aims to prove or disprove the supersymmetry, which extends the Standard Model of particle physics. Research on the nature of the major mysteries of dark matter and dark energy is also currently ongoing.

Although much progress has been made in high-energy, quantum, and astronomical physics, many everyday phenomena involving complexity, chaos, or turbulence are still poorly understood. Complex problems that seem like they could be solved by a clever application of dynamics and mechanics remain unsolved; examples include the formation of sandpiles, nodes in trickling water, the shape of water droplets, mechanisms of surface tension catastrophes, and self-sorting in shaken heterogeneous collections.

These complex phenomena have received growing attention since the 1970s for several reasons, including the availability of modern mathematical methods and computers, which enabled complex systems to be modeled in new ways. Complex physics has become part of increasingly interdisciplinary research, as exemplified by the study of turbulence in aerodynamics and the observation of pattern formation in biological systems. In the 1932 &quot;Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics&quot;, Horace Lamb said:
==Branches and fields==

===Fields===
The major fields of physics, along with their subfields and the theories and concepts they employ, are shown in the following table.
Since the 20th century, the individual fields of physics have become increasingly specialised, and today most physicists work in a single field for their entire careers. &quot;Universalists&quot; such as Einstein (1879–1955) and Lev Landau (1908–1968), who worked in multiple fields of physics, are now very rare.

Contemporary research in physics can be broadly divided into nuclear and particle physics; condensed matter physics; atomic, molecular, and optical physics; astrophysics; and applied physics. Some physics departments also support physics education research and physics outreach.

====Nuclear and particle====

Particle physics is the study of the elementary constituents of matter and energy and the interactions between them. In addition, particle physicists design and develop the high-energy accelerators, detectors, and computer programs necessary for this research. The field is also called &quot;high-energy physics&quot; because many elementary particles do not occur naturally but are created only during high-energy collisions of other particles.

Currently, the interactions of elementary particles and fields are described by the Standard Model. The model accounts for the 12 known particles of matter (quarks and leptons) that interact via the strong, weak, and electromagnetic fundamental forces. Dynamics are described in terms of matter particles exchanging gauge bosons (gluons, W and Z bosons, and photons, respectively). The Standard Model also predicts a particle known as the Higgs boson. In July 2012 CERN, the European laboratory for particle physics, announced the detection of a particle consistent with the Higgs boson, an integral part of the Higgs mechanism.

Nuclear physics is the field of physics that studies the constituents and interactions of atomic nuclei. The most commonly known applications of nuclear physics are nuclear power generation and nuclear weapons technology, but the research has provided application in many fields, including those in nuclear medicine and magnetic resonance imaging, ion implantation in materials engineering, and radiocarbon dating in geology and archaeology.

====Atomic, molecular, and optical====
Atomic, molecular, and optical physics (AMO) is the study of matter—matter and light—matter interactions on the scale of single atoms and molecules. The three areas are grouped together because of their interrelationships, the similarity of methods used, and the commonality of their relevant energy scales. All three areas include both classical, semi-classical and quantum treatments; they can treat their subject from a microscopic view (in contrast to a macroscopic view).

Atomic physics studies the electron shells of atoms. Current research focuses on activities in quantum control, cooling and trapping of atoms and ions, low-temperature collision dynamics and the effects of electron correlation on structure and dynamics. Atomic physics is influenced by the nucleus (see hyperfine splitting), but intra-nuclear phenomena such as fission and fusion are considered part of nuclear physics.

Molecular physics focuses on multi-atomic structures and their internal and external interactions with matter and light. Optical physics is distinct from optics in that it tends to focus not on the control of classical light fields by macroscopic objects but on the fundamental properties of optical fields and their interactions with matter in the microscopic realm.

====Condensed matter====

Condensed matter physics is the field of physics that deals with the macroscopic physical properties of matter. In particular, it is concerned with the &quot;condensed&quot; phases that appear whenever the number of particles in a system is extremely large and the interactions between them are strong.

The most familiar examples of condensed phases are solids and liquids, which arise from the bonding by way of the electromagnetic force between atoms. More exotic condensed phases include the superfluid and the Bose–Einstein condensate found in certain atomic systems at very low temperature, the superconducting phase exhibited by conduction electrons in certain materials, and the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases of spins on atomic lattices.

Condensed matter physics is the largest field of contemporary physics. Historically, condensed matter physics grew out of solid-state physics, which is now considered one of its main subfields. The term &quot;condensed matter physics&quot; was apparently coined by Philip Anderson when he renamed his research group—previously &quot;solid-state theory&quot;—in 1967. In 1978, the Division of Solid State Physics of the American Physical Society was renamed as the Division of Condensed Matter Physics. Condensed matter physics has a large overlap with chemistry, materials science, nanotechnology and engineering.

====Astrophysics====

Astrophysics and astronomy are the application of the theories and methods of physics to the study of stellar structure, stellar evolution, the origin of the Solar System, and related problems of cosmology. Because astrophysics is a broad subject, astrophysicists typically apply many disciplines of physics, including mechanics, electromagnetism, statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, relativity, nuclear and particle physics, and atomic and molecular physics.

The discovery by Karl Jansky in 1931 that radio signals were emitted by celestial bodies initiated the science of radio astronomy. Most recently, the frontiers of astronomy have been expanded by space exploration. Perturbations and interference from the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere make space-based observations necessary for infrared, ultraviolet, gamma-ray, and X-ray astronomy.

Physical cosmology is the study of the formation and evolution of the universe on its largest scales. Albert Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity plays a central role in all modern cosmological theories. In the early 20th century, Hubble&#x27;s discovery that the universe is expanding, as shown by the Hubble diagram, prompted rival explanations known as the steady state universe and the Big Bang.

The Big Bang was confirmed by the success of Big Bang nucleosynthesis and the discovery of the cosmic microwave background in 1964. The Big Bang model rests on two theoretical pillars: Albert Einstein&#x27;s general relativity and the cosmological principle. Cosmologists have recently established the ΛCDM model of the evolution of the universe, which includes cosmic inflation, dark energy, and dark matter.

== Other aspects ==

===Education===
===Careers===
===Philosophy===

Physics, as with the rest of science, relies on the philosophy of science and its &quot;scientific method&quot; to advance knowledge of the physical world. The scientific method employs &quot;a priori and a posteriori&quot; reasoning as well as the use of Bayesian inference to measure the validity of a given theory.
Study of the philosophical issues surrounding physics, the philosophy of physics, involves issues such as the nature of space and time, determinism, and metaphysical outlooks such as empiricism, naturalism, and realism.

Many physicists have written about the philosophical implications of their work, for instance Laplace, who championed causal determinism, and Erwin Schrödinger, who wrote on quantum mechanics. The mathematical physicist Roger Penrose has been called a Platonist by Stephen Hawking, a view Penrose discusses in his book, &quot;The Road to Reality&quot;. Hawking referred to himself as an &quot;unashamed reductionist&quot; and took issue with Penrose&#x27;s views.


Mathematics provides a compact and exact language used to describe the order in nature. This was noted and advocated by Pythagoras, Plato, Galileo, and Newton. Some theorists, like Hilary Putnam and Penelope Maddy, hold that logical truths, and therefore mathematical reasoning, depend on the empirical world. This is usually combined with the claim that the laws of logic express universal regularities found in the structural features of the world, which may explain the peculiar relation between these fields.

Physics uses mathematics to organise and formulate experimental results. From those results, precise or estimated solutions are obtained, or quantitative results, from which new predictions can be made and experimentally confirmed or negated. The results from physics experiments are numerical data, with their units of measure and estimates of the errors in the measurements. Technologies based on mathematics, like computation have made computational physics an active area of research.

Ontology is a prerequisite for physics, but not for mathematics. It means physics is ultimately concerned with descriptions of the real world, while mathematics is concerned with abstract patterns, even beyond the real world. Thus physics statements are synthetic, while mathematical statements are analytic. Mathematics contains hypotheses, while physics contains theories. Mathematics statements have to be only logically true, while predictions of physics statements must match observed and experimental data.

The distinction is clear-cut, but not always obvious. For example, mathematical physics is the application of mathematics in physics. Its methods are mathematical, but its subject is physical. The problems in this field start with a &quot;mathematical model of a physical situation&quot; (system) and a &quot;mathematical description of a physical law&quot; that will be applied to that system. Every mathematical statement used for solving has a hard-to-find physical meaning. The final mathematical solution has an easier-to-find meaning, because it is what the solver is looking for.

===Fundamental vs. applied physics===
Physics is a branch of fundamental science (also called basic science). Physics is also called &quot;&quot;the&quot; fundamental science&quot; because all branches of natural science including chemistry, astronomy, geology, and biology are constrained by laws of physics. Similarly, chemistry is often called the central science because of its role in linking the physical sciences. For example, chemistry studies properties, structures, and reactions of matter (chemistry&#x27;s focus on the molecular and atomic scale distinguishes it from physics). Structures are formed because particles exert electrical forces on each other, properties include physical characteristics of given substances, and reactions are bound by laws of physics, like conservation of energy, mass, and charge. Fundamental physics seeks to better explain and understand phenomena in all spheres, without a specific practical application as a goal, other than the deeper insight into the phenomema themselves.


Applied physics is a general term for physics research and development that is intended for a particular use. An applied physics curriculum usually contains a few classes in an applied discipline, like geology or electrical engineering. It usually differs from engineering in that an applied physicist may not be designing something in particular, but rather is using physics or conducting physics research with the aim of developing new technologies or solving a problem.

The approach is similar to that of applied mathematics. Applied physicists use physics in scientific research. For instance, people working on accelerator physics might seek to build better particle detectors for research in theoretical physics.

Physics is used heavily in engineering. For example, statics, a subfield of mechanics, is used in the building of bridges and other static structures. The understanding and use of acoustics results in sound control and better concert halls; similarly, the use of optics creates better optical devices. An understanding of physics makes for more realistic flight simulators, video games, and movies, and is often critical in forensic investigations.
With the standard consensus that the laws of physics are universal and do not change with time, physics can be used to study things that would ordinarily be mired in uncertainty. For example, in the study of the origin of the Earth, a physicist can reasonably model Earth&#x27;s mass, temperature, and rate of rotation, as a function of time allowing the extrapolation forward or backward in time and so predict future or prior events. It also allows for simulations in engineering that speed up the development of a new technology.

There is also considerable interdisciplinarity, so many other important fields are influenced by physics (e.g., the fields of econophysics and sociophysics).

<text>Papua New Guinea, officially the Independent State of Papua New Guinea is a country in Oceania that comprises the eastern half of the island of New Guinea and offshore islands in Melanesia, a region of the southwestern Pacific Ocean north of Australia. It has a land border with Indonesia to the west and neighbours Australia to the south and the Solomon Islands to the east. Its capital, on its southern coast, is Port Moresby. The country is the world&#x27;s third largest island country, with an area of .

The nation was split in the 1880s between German New Guinea in the North and the British Territory of Papua in the South, the latter of which was ceded to Australia in 1902. All of present-day Papua New Guinea came under Australian control following World War I, with the legally distinct Territory of New Guinea being established out of the former German colony as a League of Nations mandate. The nation was the site of fierce fighting during the New Guinea campaign of World War II. Papua New Guinea became an independent Commonwealth realm in 1975 with Elizabeth II as its Queen. Since Elizabeth II&#x27;s death in 2022, Charles III has been the King.

There are 840 known languages of Papua New Guinea (including English), making it the most linguistically diverse country in the world. It is also one of the most rural countries, with only 13.25% of its population living in urban centres in 2019. Most of its people live in customary communities. Although government estimates reported the country&#x27;s population to be 11.8 million, it was reported in December 2022 that its population was in fact closer to 17 million. Papua New Guinea is the most populous Pacific island country.

The country is believed to be the home of many undocumented species of plants and animals.

Papua New Guinea is classified as a developing economy by the International Monetary Fund; nearly 40% of the population are subsistence farmers, living relatively independently of the cash economy. Their traditional social groupings are explicitly acknowledged by the Papua New Guinea Constitution, which expresses the wish for &quot;traditional villages and communities to remain as viable units of Papua New Guinean society&quot; and protects their continuing importance to local and national community life. Papua New Guinea has been an observer state in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) since 1976, and has filed its application for full membership status. It is a full member of the Commonwealth of Nations, the Pacific Community, the Pacific Islands Forum, and the United Nations.

==Etymology==
&quot;Papua&quot; is derived from a local term of uncertain origin. Regarding the islands of New Guinea, the Portuguese captain and geographer António Galvão wrote that:

&quot;New Guinea&quot; (&quot;Nueva Guinea&quot;) was the name coined by the Spanish explorer Yñigo Ortiz de Retez. In 1545, he noted the resemblance of the people to those he had earlier seen along the Guinea coast of Africa. Guinea, in its turn, is etymologically derived from the Portuguese word &quot;&quot;. The name is one of several toponyms sharing similar etymologies, ultimately meaning &quot;land of the blacks&quot; or similar meanings, in reference to the dark skin of the inhabitants.

== History ==

Archaeological evidence indicates that humans first arrived in Papua New Guinea around 42,000 to 45,000 years ago. They were descendants of migrants out of Africa, in one of the early waves of human migration. A 2016 study at the University of Cambridge by Christopher Klein et al. suggests that it was about 50,000 years ago that these peoples reached Sahul (the paleocontinent consisting of present-day Australia and New Guinea). The sea levels rose and isolated New Guinea about 10,000 years ago, but Aboriginal Australians and Papuans diverged from each other genetically earlier, about 37,000 years BP. Evolutionary geneticist Svante Pääbo found that people of New Guinea share 4%–7% of their genome with the Denisovans, indicating that the ancestors of Papuans interbred in Asia with these archaic hominins.

Agriculture was independently developed in the New Guinea highlands around 7000 BC, making it one of the few areas in the world where people independently domesticated plants. A major migration of Austronesian-speaking peoples to coastal regions of New Guinea took place around 500 BC. This has been correlated with the introduction of pottery, pigs, and certain fishing techniques.

In the 18th century, traders brought the sweet potato to New Guinea, where it was adopted and became a staple food. Portuguese traders had obtained it from South America and introduced it to the Moluccas. The far higher crop yields from sweet potato radically transformed traditional agriculture and societies. Sweet potato largely supplanted the previous staple, taro, and resulted in a significant increase in population in the highlands.

Although by the late 20th century headhunting and cannibalism had been practically eradicated, in the past they were practised in many parts of the country as part of rituals related to warfare and taking in enemy spirits or powers. In 1901, on Goaribari Island in the Gulf of Papua, missionary Harry Dauncey found 10,000 skulls in the island&#x27;s long houses, a demonstration of past practices. According to Marianna Torgovnick, writing in 1991, &quot;The most fully documented instances of cannibalism as a social institution come from New Guinea, where head-hunting and ritual cannibalism survived, in certain isolated areas, into the Fifties, Sixties, and Seventies, and still leave traces within certain social groups.&quot;

===European encounters===
Little was known in Europe about the island until the 19th century, although Portuguese and Spanish explorers, such as Dom Jorge de Menezes and Yñigo Ortiz de Retez, had encountered it as early as the 16th century. Traders from Southeast Asia visited New Guinea beginning 5,000 years ago to collect bird-of-paradise plumes.

===Missionaries===
Christianity was introduced to New Guinea on 15 September 1847 when a group of Marist missionaries came to Woodlark Island. They established their first mission on Umboi Island. Following that year, they were forced to withdraw their mission endeavour. Five years later on 8 October 1852, the Pontifical Institute for Foreign Missions, a pontifical institute, reestablished the mission on Woodlark Island, encountering sickness and resistance from local people.

===Colonialism===

The country&#x27;s dual name results from its complex administrative history before independence. Beginning in 1884, the region was split between two colonial powers. Germany ruled the northern half of the country for several decades as a colony named German New Guinea, while the southern part of the country became a British protectorate.

In 1888, the British protectorate, as well as some adjacent islands, were annexed by Britain as British New Guinea. In 1902, Papua was effectively transferred to the authority of the new British dominion of Australia. With the passage of the Papua Act 1905, the area was officially renamed the Territory of Papua, and the Australian administration became formal in 1906.

Following the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Australian forces captured German New Guinea and occupied it throughout the war. After Germany and the Central Powers were defeated in the war, the League of Nations authorised Australia to administer this area as a League of Nations mandate territory, which became the Territory of New Guinea.

In contrast to establishing an Australian mandate in former German New Guinea, the League of Nations determined that Papua was an external territory of the Australian Commonwealth; as a matter of law it remained a British possession. The difference in legal status meant that until 1949, Papua (former British protectorate Territory of Papua) and New Guinea (former German territory German New Guinea) had entirely separate administrations, both controlled by Australia. These conditions contributed to the complexity of organising the country&#x27;s post-independence legal system.

The highland valleys were first explored by Australians in the 1930s and were found to be inhabited by over a million people.

===World War II===

During World War II, the New Guinea campaign (1942–1945) was one of the major military campaigns and conflicts between Japan and the Allies. Approximately 216,000 Japanese, Australian, and U.S. servicemen died. After World War II and the victory of the Allies, the two territories were combined into the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. This was later referred to as &quot;Papua New Guinea.&quot;

=== Australian rule and independence ===
After World War II, Australia administered the two newly combined territories of Papua and New Guinea. By 1951, a 28-member Legislative Council was instituted, although this was largely dominated by Australian administrative members, with only 3 seats allocated to Papua New Guineans. Sir Donald Cleland, an Australian soldier, became the first administrator of this new council.

In 1964, the Council was replaced by the 64-member House of Assembly of Papua and New Guinea, which for the first time had a majority of Papua New Guinean members. The Assembly increased to 84 members in 1967 and 100 by 1971.

Debate began over Australian administration both in Papua New Guinea and Australia, with the Bougainville independence movement pushing for greater autonomy as Australian mining company Rio Tinto&#x27;s exploitative practices became extremely controversial to the region&#x27;s indigenous landowners, with demands for compensation being made.

Australian Opposition Leader Gough Whitlam visited Papua New Guinea in 1970 and 1971, amid further calls for independence by the Tolai people in Gazelle Peninsula. He called for self-governance for the Territory as early as 1972.

At the 1972 Papua New Guinean general election in July, Michael Somare was elected as the first Papua New Guinean Chief Minister of the Territory. In December, Whitlam was elected as Prime Minister at the 1972 Australian federal election. The Whitlam Government then instituted self-governance under the rule of Somare in late 1973.

Over the next two years, further arguments for independence were forwarded, culminating in the Whitlam Government passing the Papua New Guinea Independence Act 1975 in September 1975, citing the 16th of September 1975 as the date of independence.

Whitlam and then-Prince Charles attended the independence ceremony, with Somare continuing as the country&#x27;s first Prime Minister.

===Bougainville===
A secessionist revolt in 1975–76 on Bougainville Island resulted in a modification of the draft Constitution of Papua New Guinea to allow for Bougainville and the other eighteen districts to have quasi-federal status as provinces. A renewed uprising on Bougainville started in 1988 and claimed 20,000 lives until it was resolved in 1997. Bougainville had been the primary mining region of the country, generating 40% of the national budget. The native peoples felt they were bearing the adverse environmental effects of the mining, which contaminated the land, water and air, without gaining a fair share of the profits.

The government and rebels negotiated a peace agreement that established the Bougainville Autonomous District and Province. The autonomous Bougainville elected Joseph Kabui as president in 2005, who served until he died in 2008. He was succeeded by his deputy John Tabinaman as acting president while an election to fill the unexpired term was organised. James Tanis won that election in December 2008 and served until the inauguration of John Momis, the winner of the 2010 elections. As part of the current peace settlement, a non-binding independence referendum was held, between 23 November and 7 December 2019. The referendum question was a choice between greater autonomy within Papua New Guinea and full independence for Bougainville, and voters voted overwhelmingly (98.31%) for independence. Negotiations between the Bougainville government and national Papua New Guinea on a path to Bougainville independence began after the referendum, and are ongoing.

== Geography ==

At , Papua New Guinea is the world&#x27;s 54th-largest country and the third-largest island country. Papua New Guinea is part of the Australasian realm, which also includes Australia, New Zealand, eastern Indonesia, and several Pacific island groups, including the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. Including all its islands, it lies between latitudes 0° and 12°S, and longitudes 140° and 160°E. It has an exclusive economic zone of . The mainland of the country is the eastern half of New Guinea island, where the largest towns are also located, including Port Moresby (capital) and Lae; other major islands within Papua New Guinea include New Ireland, New Britain, Manus and Bougainville.

Located north of the Australian mainland, the country&#x27;s geography is diverse and, in places, extremely rugged. A spine of mountains, the New Guinea Highlands, runs the length of the island of New Guinea, forming a populous highlands region mostly covered with tropical rainforest, and the long Papuan Peninsula, known as the &#x27;Bird&#x27;s Tail&#x27;. Dense rainforests can be found in the lowland and coastal areas as well as very large wetland areas surrounding the Sepik and Fly rivers. This terrain has made it difficult for the country to develop transportation infrastructure. This has made it so that air travel is often the most efficient and reliable means of transportation. The highest peak is Mount Wilhelm at . Papua New Guinea is surrounded by coral reefs which are under close watch, in the interests of preservation. Papua New Guinea&#x27;s largest rivers are in New Guinea and include Sepik, Ramu, Markham, Musa, Purari, Kikori, Turama, Wawoi and Fly.

The country is situated on the Pacific Ring of Fire, at the point of collision of several tectonic plates. Geologically, the island of New Guinea is a northern extension of the Indo-Australian tectonic plate, forming part of a single land mass which is Australia-New Guinea (also called &quot;Sahul&quot; or &quot;Meganesia&quot;). It is connected to the Australian segment by a shallow continental shelf across the Torres Strait, which in former ages lay exposed as a land bridge, particularly during ice ages when sea levels were lower than at present. As the Indo-Australian Plate (which includes landmasses of India, Australia, and the Indian Ocean floor in between) drifts north, it collides with the Eurasian Plate. The collision of the two plates pushed up the Himalayas, the Indonesian islands, and New Guinea&#x27;s Central Range. The Central Range is much younger and higher than the mountains of Australia, so high that it is home to rare equatorial glaciers.

There are several active volcanoes, and eruptions are frequent. Earthquakes are relatively common, sometimes accompanied by tsunamis. On 25 February 2018, an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 and depth of 35 kilometres struck the middle of Papua New Guinea. The worst of the damage was centred around the Southern Highlands region. Papua New Guinea is one of the few regions close to the equator that experience snowfall, which occurs in the most elevated parts of the mainland.

The border between Papua New Guinea and Indonesia was confirmed by a treaty with Australia before independence in 1974. The land border comprises a segment of the 141° E meridian from the north coast southwards to where it meets the Fly River flowing east, then a short curve of the river&#x27;s thalweg to where it meets the 141°01&#x27;10&quot; E meridian flowing west, then southwards to the south coast. The 141° E meridian formed the entire eastern boundary of Dutch New Guinea according to its 1828 annexation proclamation. By the Treaty of The Hague (1895) the Dutch and British agreed to a territorial exchange, bringing the entire left bank of the Fly River into British New Guinea and moving the southern border east to the Torasi Estuary. The maritime boundary with Australia was confirmed by a treaty in 1978. In the Torres Strait it runs close to the mainland of New Guinea, keeping the adjacent North Western Torres Strait Islands (Dauan, Boigu and Saibai) under Australian sovereignty. Maritime boundaries with the Solomon Islands were confirmed by a 1989 treaty.

===Earthquakes===
Papua New Guinea is famous for its frequent seismic activity, being on the Ring of Fire. On 17 July 1998, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck north of Aitape. It triggered a 50-foot-high tsunami, which killed over 2,180 people in one of the worst natural disasters in the country.
In September 2002, a magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck off the coast of Wewak, Sandaun Province, killing six people.

From March to April 2018, a chain of earthquakes hit Hela Province, causing widespread landslides and the deaths of 200 people. Various nations from Oceania and Southeast Asia immediately sent aid to the country.

Another severe earthquake occurred on 11 September 2022, killing seven people and causing damaging shaking in some of the country&#x27;s largest cities, such as Lae and Madang, it was also felt in the capital Port Moresby.

On May 24, 2024, a landslide hit the village of Kaokalam in Enga Province, about 600 kilometers (372 miles) northwest of the capital, Port Moresby, at about 3 a.m. local time. The landslide buried more than 2000 people alive, caused major destruction to buildings, and food gardens and caused major impact on the economic lifeline of the country. The casualty figure surpasses the 2006 Southern Leyte mudslide tragedy where a total of 1,126 people lost their lives as the debris flow from a landslide followed 10 days of heavy rain. With over 2,000 reported dead by the Papua New Guinea government, this disaster has now emerged as the deadliest landslide of the 21st century.

=== Climate ===
The climate on the island is essentially tropical, but it varies by region. The maximum mean temperature in the lowlands is 30 to 32 °C, and the minimum 23–24 °C. In the highlands above 2100 metres, colder conditions prevail and night frosts are common there, while the daytime temperature exceeds 22 °C, regardless of the season.

=== Biodiversity ===

Many species of birds and mammals found on New Guinea have close genetic links with corresponding species found in Australia. One notable feature in common for the two landmasses is the existence of several species of marsupial mammals, including some kangaroos and possums, which are not found elsewhere. Papua New Guinea is a megadiverse country.

Many of the other islands within PNG territory, including New Britain, New Ireland, Bougainville, the Admiralty Islands, the Trobriand Islands, and the Louisiade Archipelago, were never linked to New Guinea by land bridges. As a consequence, they have their own flora and fauna; in particular, they lack many of the land mammals and flightless birds that are common to New Guinea and Australia.
Australia and New Guinea are portions of the ancient supercontinent of Gondwana, which started to break into smaller continents in the Cretaceous period, 65–130 million years ago. Australia finally broke free from Antarctica about 45 million years ago. All the Australasian lands are home to the Antarctic flora, descended from the flora of southern Gondwana, including the coniferous podocarps and &quot;Araucaria&quot; pines, and the broad-leafed southern beech (&quot;Nothofagus&quot;). These plant families are still present in Papua New Guinea. New Guinea is part of the humid tropics, and many Indomalayan rainforest plants spread across the narrow straits from Asia, mixing with the old Australian and Antarctic floras. New Guinea has been identified as the world&#x27;s most floristically diverse island in the world, with 13,634 known species of vascular plants.

Papua New Guinea includes several terrestrial ecoregions:

* Admiralty Islands lowland rain forests – forested islands to the north of the mainland, home to a distinct flora.
* Central Range montane rain forests 
* Huon Peninsula montane rain forests
* Louisiade Archipelago rain forests
* New Britain-New Ireland lowland rain forests
* New Britain-New Ireland montane rain forests
* New Guinea mangroves
* Northern New Guinea lowland rain and freshwater swamp forests
* Northern New Guinea montane rain forests
* Solomon Islands rain forests (includes Bougainville Island and Buka)
* Southeastern Papuan rain forests
* Southern New Guinea freshwater swamp forests
* Southern New Guinea lowland rain forests
* Trobriand Islands rain forests
* Trans-Fly savanna and grasslands

Three new species of mammals were discovered in the forests of Papua New Guinea by an Australian-led expedition in the early 2010s. A small wallaby, a large-eared mouse and a shrew-like marsupial were discovered. The expedition was also successful in capturing photographs and video footage of some other rare animals such as the Tenkile tree kangaroo and the Weimang tree kangaroo. Nearly one-quarter of Papua New Guinea&#x27;s rainforests were damaged or destroyed between 1972 and 2002. Papua New Guinea had a Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 8.84/10, ranking it 17th globally out of 172 countries. Mangrove swamps stretch along the coast, and in the inland it is inhabited by nipa palm (Nypa fruticans), and deeper in the inland the sago palm tree inhabits areas in the valleys of larger rivers. Trees such as oaks, red cedars, pines, and beeches are becoming predominant in the uplands above 3,300 feet. Papua New Guinea is rich in various species of reptiles, indigenous freshwater fish and birds, but it is almost devoid of large mammals.

==Government and politics==
Papua New Guinea is a Commonwealth realm with Charles III as King of Papua New Guinea. The monarch&#x27;s representative is the governor-general of Papua New Guinea, who is elected by the unicameral National Parliament of Papua New Guinea. Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands are the only realms in which the governor-general is elected by parliament, although the governor-general is still formally appointed by the monarch in accordance with the parliamentary vote.

The national constitution provides for the executive to be responsible to parliament as the representative of the Papua New Guinean people. The prime minister of Papua New Guinea is elected by the National Parliament, while the other ministers are appointed by the governor-general on the prime minister&#x27;s advice and form the National Executive Council, which acts as the country&#x27;s cabinet. The National Parliament has 111 seats, of which 22 are occupied by the governors of the 22 provinces and the National Capital District. Candidates for members of parliament are voted upon when the prime minister asks the governor-general to call a national election, a maximum of five years after the previous national election.

In the early years of independence, the instability of the party system led to frequent votes of no confidence in parliament, with resulting changes of the government, but with referral to the electorate, through national elections only occurring every five years. In recent years, successive governments have passed legislation preventing such votes sooner than 18 months after a national election and within 12 months of the next election. In 2012, the first two (of three) readings were passed to prevent votes of no confidence occurring within the first 30 months. This restriction on votes of no confidence has arguably resulted in greater stability, although perhaps at the cost of reducing the accountability of the executive branch of government.

Elections in PNG attract numerous candidates. After independence in 1975, members were elected by the first-past-the-post system, with winners frequently gaining less than 15% of the vote. Electoral reforms in 2001 introduced the Limited Preferential Vote system (LPV), a version of the alternative vote. The 2007 general election was the first to be conducted using LPV.

Under a 2002 amendment, the leader of the party winning the largest number of seats in the election is invited by the governor-general to form the government, if they can muster the necessary majority in parliament. The process of forming such a coalition in PNG, where parties do not have much ideology, involves considerable &quot;horse-trading&quot; right up until the last moment. Peter O&#x27;Neill emerged as Papua New Guinea&#x27;s prime minister after the July 2012 election, and formed a government with Leo Dion, the former Governor of East New Britain Province, as deputy prime minister.

In 2011 there was a constitutional crisis between the parliament-elect Prime Minister, Peter O&#x27;Neill (voted into office by a large majority of MPs), and Sir Michael Somare, who was deemed by the supreme court to retain office. The stand-off between parliament and the supreme court continued until the July 2012 national elections, with legislation passed effectively removing the chief justice and subjecting the supreme court members to greater control by the legislature, as well as a series of other laws passed, for example limiting the age for a prime minister. The confrontation reached a peak, with the deputy prime minister entering the supreme court during a hearing, escorted by police, ostensibly to arrest the chief justice. There was strong pressure among some MPs to defer the national elections for a further six months to one year, although their powers to do that were highly questionable. The parliament-elect prime minister and other cooler-headed MPs carried the votes for the writs for the new election to be issued, slightly late, but for the election itself to occur on time, thereby avoiding a continuation of the constitutional crisis.

In May 2019, O&#x27;Neill resigned as prime minister and was replaced through a vote of Parliament by James Marape. Marape was a key minister in O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s government and his defection from the government to the opposition camp had finally led to O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s resignation from office. Davis Steven was appointed deputy prime minister, justice Minister and Attorney General. After an election widely criticised by observers for its inadequate preparation (including failure to update the electoral roll), abuses and violence, in July 2022, Prime Minister James Marape&#x27;s PANGU Party secured the most seats of any party in the election, enabling James Marape to be invited to form a coalition government, which he succeeded in doing and he continued as PNG&#x27;s Prime Minister. In the 2022 Election two women were elected into the eleventh Parliament, one, Rufina Peter, also became Provincial governor of Central Province.

=== Administrative divisions ===

Papua New Guinea is divided into four regions, which are not the primary administrative divisions but are quite significant in many aspects of government, commercial, sporting and other activities. The nation has 22 province-level divisions: twenty provinces, the Autonomous Region of Bougainville and the National Capital District. Each province is divided into one or more districts, which in turn are divided into one or more Local-Level Government areas. Provinces are the primary administrative divisions of the country. Provincial governments are branches of the national government as Papua New Guinea is not a federation of provinces. The province-level divisions are as follows:

In 2009, Parliament approved the creation of two additional provinces: Hela Province, consisting of part of the existing Southern Highlands Province, and Jiwaka Province, formed by dividing Western Highlands Province. Jiwaka and Hela officially became separate provinces on 17 May 2012. The declaration of Hela and Jiwaka is a result of the largest liquefied natural gas project in the country that is situated in both provinces. The government set 23 November 2019 as the voting date for a non-binding independence referendum in the Bougainville autonomous region. In December 2019, the autonomous region voted overwhelmingly for independence, with 97.7% voting in favour of obtaining full independence and around 1.7% voting in favour of greater autonomy.

=== Foreign relations ===
Papua New Guinea is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, Pacific Community, Pacific Islands Forum, and the Melanesian Spearhead Group (MSG) of countries. It was accorded observer status within ASEAN in 1976, followed later by special observer status in 1981. It is also a member of APEC and an ACP country, associated with the European Union.

Papua New Guinea has been a member of the Forum of Small States (FOSS) since the group&#x27;s founding in 1992.

Papua New Guinea supported Indonesia&#x27;s control of Western New Guinea, the focus of the Papua conflict where numerous human rights violations have reportedly been committed by the Indonesian security forces.

=== Military ===
The Papua New Guinea Defence Force is the military organisation responsible for the defence of Papua New Guinea. It consists of three wings. The Land Element has 7 units: the Royal Pacific Islands Regiment, a special forces unit, a battalion of engineers, three other small units primarily dealing with signals and health, and a military academy. The Air Element consists of one aircraft squadron, which transports the other military wings. The Maritime Element consists of four s, three ex-Australian landing craft, and one . One of the landing craft is used as a training ship. Three more Guardian-class patrol boats are under construction in Australia, to replace the old Pacific-class vessels. The main tasks of the Maritime Element are to patrol inshore waters and to transport the Land Element. Papua New Guinea has a very large exclusive economic zone because of its extensive coastline. The Maritime Element relies heavily on satellite imagery to surveil the country&#x27;s waters. Patrolling is generally ineffective because underfunding often leaves the patrol boats unserviceable. This problem will be partially corrected when the larger Guardian-class patrol boats enter service.

=== Law ===

The unicameral Parliament enacts legislation in the same manner as in other Commonwealth realms that use the Westminster system of government. The cabinet collectively agrees on government policy, and then the relevant minister introduces bills to Parliament, depending on which government department is responsible for the implementation of a particular law. Backbench members of parliament can also introduce bills. Parliament debates bills, and (section 110.1 of the Constitution) they become enacted laws when the Speaker certifies that Parliament has passed them. There is no Royal assent.

All ordinary statutes enacted by Parliament must be consistent with the Constitution. The courts have jurisdiction to rule on the constitutionality of statutes, both in disputes before them and on a reference where there is no dispute but only an abstract question of law. Unusually among developing countries, the judicial branch of government in Papua New Guinea has remained remarkably independent, and successive executive governments have continued to respect its authority.

The &quot;underlying law&quot; (Papua New Guinea&#x27;s common law) consists of principles and rules of common law and equity in English common law as it stood on 16 September 1975 (the date of independence), and thereafter the decisions of PNG&#x27;s own courts. The courts are directed by the Constitution and, latterly, the &quot;Underlying Law Act&quot;, to take note of the &quot;custom&quot; of traditional communities. They are to determine which customs are common to the whole country and may be declared also to be part of the underlying law. In practice, this has proved difficult and has been largely neglected. Statutes are largely adapted from overseas jurisdictions, primarily Australia and England. Advocacy in the courts follows the adversarial pattern of other common-law countries. This national court system, used in towns and cities, is supported by a village court system in the more remote areas. The law underpinning the village courts is &#x27;customary law&#x27;.

=== Crime and human rights ===


Papua New Guinea is often ranked as likely the worst place in the world for violence against women. A 2013 study in &quot;The Lancet&quot; found that 27% of men on Bougainville Island reported having raped a non-partner, while 14.1% reported having committed gang rape. According to UNICEF, nearly half of reported rape victims are under 15 years old, and 13% are under 7 years old. A report by ChildFund Australia, citing former Parliamentarian Dame Carol Kidu, claimed 50% of those seeking medical help after rape are under 16, 25% are under 12, and 10% are under 8. Under Dame Carol&#x27;s term as Minister for Community Development, Parliament passed the Family Protection Act (2013) and the Lukautim Pikini Act (2015), although the Family Protection Regulation was not approved until 2017, delaying its application in the Courts.

The 1971 Sorcery Act imposed a penalty of up to 2 years in prison for the practice of &quot;black&quot; magic, until the act was repealed in 2013. An estimated 50–150 alleged witches are killed each year in Papua New Guinea. A Sorcery and Witchcraft Accusation Related National Action Plan (SNAP) was approved by the Government in 2015, although funding and application has been deficient. There are also no protections given to LGBT citizens in the country. Homosexual acts are prohibited by law in Papua New Guinea.

While tribal violence has long been a way of life in the highlands regions, an increase in firearms has led to greater loss of life. In the past, rival groups had been known to utilise axes, bush knives and traditional weapons, as well as respecting rules of engagement that prevented violence while hunting or at markets. These norms have been changing with a greater uptake of firearms. These are believed to be sourced from smuggling operations over the border into Indonesia, as well as losses from government armouries. Only 1/5th of 5000 Australian-made Self Loading Rifles and half of the 2000 M16s delivered to the PNGDF from the 1970s-1990s were found in government armouries during an audit in 2004 and 2005. The smuggling and theft of ammunition have also increased violence in these regions, leading to the police force and military finding it difficult to maintain control, often finding themselves outgunned and only able to retrieve bodies. Village massacres have increased with 69 villagers killed in a single attack in February 2024 in Enga Province, the largest killings since the Bougainville conflict of the 1980s and 90s.

Papua New Guinea received a score of 5.6 out of 10 for safety from the state from the Human Rights Measurement Initiative.

===Royal PNG Constabulary===
The Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary has been troubled in recent years by infighting, political interference and corruption. It was recognised from early after Independence (and hitherto) that a national police force alone could never have the capacity to administer law and order across the country, and that it would also require effective local-level systems of policing and enforcement, notably the village court magisterial service. The weaknesses of police capacity, poor working conditions and recommendations to address them were the subject of the 2004 Royal PNG Constabulary Administrative Review to the Minister for Internal Security.
In 2011, Commissioner for Police Anthony Wagambie took the unusual step of asking the public to report police asking for payments for performing their duties.
In September 2020, Minister for Police Bryan Jared Kramer launched a broadside on Facebook against his own police department, which was subsequently reported in the international media. In the post, Kramer accused the Royal PNG Constabulary of widespread corruption, claiming that &quot;Senior officers based in Police Headquarters in Port Moresby were stealing from their own retired officers’ pension funds. They were implicated in organised crime, drug syndicates, smuggling firearms, stealing fuel, insurance scams, and even misusing police allowances. They misused tens of millions of kina allocated for police housing, resources, and welfare. We also uncovered many cases of senior officers facilitating the theft of Police land.&quot; Commissioner for Police David Manning, in a separate statement, said that his force included &quot;criminals in uniform.&quot;

== Economy ==

Papua New Guinea is richly endowed with natural resources, including mineral and renewable resources, such as forests, marine resources (including a large portion of the world&#x27;s major tuna stocks), and in some parts agriculture. The rugged terrain (including high mountain ranges and valleys, swamps and islands) and the high cost of developing infrastructure, combined with other factors (including law and order problems in some centres and the system of customary land title) make it difficult for outside developers. Local developers are hindered by years of deficient investment in education, health, and access to finance. Agriculture, for subsistence and cash crops, provides a livelihood for 85% of the population and continues to provide some 30% of GDP. Mineral deposits, including gold, oil, and copper, account for 72% of export earnings. Oil palm production has grown steadily over recent years (largely from estates and with extensive outgrower output), with palm oil now the main agricultural export. Coffee remains the major export crop (produced largely in the Highlands provinces); followed by cocoa and coconut oil/copra from the coastal areas, each largely produced by smallholders; tea, produced on estates; and rubber. The Iagifu/Hedinia Field was discovered in 1986 in the Papuan fold and thrust belt.

Former Prime Minister Sir Mekere Morauta tried to restore integrity to state institutions, stabilise the kina, restore stability to the national budget, privatise public enterprises where appropriate, and ensure ongoing peace on Bougainville following the 1997 agreement which ended Bougainville&#x27;s secessionist unrest. The Morauta government had considerable success in attracting international support, specifically gaining the backing of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank in securing development assistance loans.

As of 2019, PNG&#x27;s real GDP growth rate was 3.8%, with an inflation rate of 4.3% This economic growth has been primarily attributed to strong commodity prices, particularly mineral but also agricultural, with the high demand for mineral products largely sustained even during the crisis by the buoyant Asian markets, a booming mining sector and by a buoyant outlook and the construction phase for natural gas exploration, production, and exportation in liquefied form (liquefied natural gas or &quot;LNG&quot;) by LNG tankers, all of which will require multibillion-dollar investments (exploration, production wells, pipelines, storage, liquefaction plants, port terminals, LNG tanker ships).

The first major gas project was the PNG LNG joint venture. ExxonMobil is operator of the joint venture, also comprising PNG company Oil Search, Santos, Kumul Petroleum Holdings (Papua New Guinea&#x27;s national oil and gas company), JX Nippon Oil and Gas Exploration, the PNG government&#x27;s Mineral Resources Development Company and Petromin PNG Holdings. The project is an integrated development that includes gas production and processing facilities in the Hela, Southern Highlands and Western Provinces of Papua New Guinea, including liquefaction and storage facilities (located northwest of Port Moresby) with capacity of 6.9 million tonnes per year. There are over of pipelines connecting the facilities. It is the largest private-sector investment in the history of PNG. A second major project is based on initial rights held by the French oil and gas major TotalEnergies and the U.S. company InterOil Corp. (IOC), which have partly combined their assets after TotalEnergies agreed in December 2013 to purchase 61.3% of IOC&#x27;s Antelope and Elk gas field rights, with the plan to develop them starting in 2016, including the construction of a liquefaction plant to allow export of LNG. TotalEnergies has separately another joint operating agreement with Oil Search.

Further gas and mineral projects are proposed (including the large Wafi-Golpu copper-gold mine), with extensive exploration ongoing across the country.

The PNG government&#x27;s long-term Vision 2050 and shorter-term policy documents, including the 2013 Budget and the 2014 Responsible Sustainable Development Strategy, emphasise the need for a more diverse economy, based upon sustainable industries and avoiding the effects of Dutch disease from major resource extraction projects undermining other industries. This occurred in many countries experiencing oil or other mineral booms, notably in Western Africa, undermining much of their agriculture sector, manufacturing and tourism, and with them broad-based employment prospects. Measures have been taken to mitigate these effects, including through the establishment of a sovereign wealth fund, partly to stabilise revenue and expenditure flows, but much will depend upon the readiness to make real reforms to effective use of revenue, tackling rampant corruption and empowering households and businesses to access markets, services and develop a more buoyant economy, with lower costs, especially for small to medium-sized enterprises. One major project conducted through the PNG Department for Community Development suggested that other pathways to sustainable development should be considered.

The Institute of National Affairs, a PNG independent policy think tank, provides a report on the business and investment environment of Papua New Guinea every five years, based upon a survey of large and small, local and overseas companies, highlighting law and order problems and corruption, as the worst impediments, followed by the poor state of transport, power and communications infrastructure.

=== Land tenure ===
The PNG legislature has enacted laws in which a type of tenure called &quot;customary land title&quot; is recognised, meaning that the traditional lands of the indigenous peoples have some legal basis for inalienable tenure. This customary land notionally covers most of the usable land in the country (some 97% of total land area); alienated land is either held privately under state lease or is government land. Freehold title (also known as fee simple) can only be held by Papua New Guinean citizens.

Only some 3% of the land of Papua New Guinea is in private hands; this is privately held under a 99-year state lease, or it is held by the State. There is virtually no freehold title; the few existing freeholds are automatically converted to state leases when they are transferred between vendor and purchaser. Unalienated land is owned under customary title by traditional landowners. The precise nature of the seisin varies from one culture to another. Many writers portray land as the communal ownership of traditional clans; however, closer studies usually show that the smallest portions of land whose ownership cannot be further divided are held by the individual heads of extended families and their descendants or their descendants alone if they have recently died.

This is a matter of vital importance because a problem of economic development is identifying the membership of customary landowning groups and the owners. Disputes between mining and forestry companies and landowner groups often devolve on the issue of whether the companies entered into contractual relations for the use of land with the true owners. Customary property—usually land—cannot be devised by will. It can only be inherited according to the custom of the deceased&#x27;s people. The Lands Act was amended in 2010 along with the Land Group Incorporation Act, intended to improve the management of state land, mechanisms for dispute resolution over land, and to enable customary landowners to be better able to access finance and possible partnerships over portions of their land if they seek to develop it for urban or rural economic activities. The Land Group Incorporation Act requires more specific identification of the customary landowners than hitherto and their more specific authorisation before any land arrangements are determined; (a major issue in recent years has been a land grab, using, or rather misusing, the Lease-Leaseback provision under the Land Act, notably using &#x27;Special Agricultural and Business Leases&#x27; (SABLs) to acquire vast tracts of customary land, purportedly for agricultural projects, but in almost all cases as a back-door mechanism for securing tropical forest resources for logging—circumventing the more exacting requirements of the Forest Act, for securing Timber Permits (which must comply with sustainability requirements and be competitively secured, and with the customary landowners&#x27; approval). Following a national outcry, these SABLs have been subject to a Commission of Inquiry, established in mid-2011, for which the report is still awaited for initial presentation to the Prime Minister and Parliament.

===Gold discovery===
Traces of gold were first found in 1852, in pottery from Redscar Bay on the Papuan Peninsula.

=== Science and technology ===
Papua New Guinea&#x27;s &quot;National Vision 2050&quot; was adopted in 2009. This has led to the establishment of the Research, Science and Technology Council. At its gathering in November 2014, the Council re-emphasised the need to focus on sustainable development through science and technology.

&quot;Vision 2050&quot;&#x27;s medium-term priorities are:
* emerging industrial technology for downstream processing;
* infrastructure technology for the economic corridors;
* knowledge-based technology;
* science and engineering education; and
* to reach the target of investing 5% of GDP in research and development by 2050. (Papua New Guinea invested 0.03% of GDP in research and development in 2016.)

In 2016, women accounted for 33.2% of researchers in Papua New Guinea.

According to Thomson Reuters&#x27; Web of Science, Papua New Guinea had the largest number of publications (110) among Pacific Island states in 2014, followed by Fiji (106). Nine out of ten scientific publications from Papua New Guinea focused on immunology, genetics, biotechnology and microbiology. Nine out of ten were also co-authored by scientists from other countries, mainly Australia, the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Spain and Switzerland.
In 2019, Papua New Guinea took second place among Pacific Island states with 253 publications, behind Fiji with 303 publications, in the Scopus (Elsevier) database of scientific publications. Health sciences accounted for 49% of these publications. Papua New Guinea&#x27;s top scientific collaborators from 2017 to 2019 were Australia, the United States of America, the United Kingdom, France and India.

Forestry is an important economic resource for Papua New Guinea, but the industry uses low and semi-intensive technological inputs. As a result, product ranges are limited to sawed timber, veneer, plywood, block board, moulding, poles and posts and wood chips. Only a few limited finished products are exported. Lack of automated machinery, coupled with inadequately trained local technical personnel, are some of the obstacles to introducing automated machinery and design.

Renewable energy sources represent two-thirds of the total electricity supply. In 2015, the Secretariat of the Pacific Community observed that, &#x27;while Fiji, Papua New Guinea, and Samoa are leading the way with large-scale hydropower projects, there is enormous potential to expand the deployment of other renewable energy options such as solar, wind, geothermal and ocean-based energy sources&#x27;. The European Union funded the Renewable Energy in Pacific Island Countries Developing Skills and Capacity programme (EPIC) over 2013 to 2017. The programme developed a master&#x27;s programme in renewable energy management, accredited in 2016, at the University of Papua New Guinea and helped to establish a Centre of Renewable Energy at the same university.

Papua New Guinea is one of the 15 beneficiaries of a programme on Adapting to Climate Change and Sustainable Energy worth €37.26 million. The programme resulted from the signing of an agreement in February 2014 between the European Union and the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat. The other beneficiaries are the Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu.

=== Transport ===
The country&#x27;s mountainous terrain impedes transport. Aeroplanes opened up the country during its colonial period and continue to be used for most travel and most high-density/value freight. The capital, Port Moresby, has no road links to any of PNG&#x27;s other major towns. Similarly, many remote villages are reachable only by light aircraft or on foot.

Jacksons International Airport is the major international airport in Papua New Guinea, located from Port Moresby. In addition to two international airfields, Papua New Guinea has 578 airstrips, most of which are unpaved. The national airline is Air Niugini, operating out of Jacksons International.

== Demographics ==

Papua New Guinea is one of the most heterogeneous nations in the world with an estimated 8.95 million inhabitants as of 2020. There are hundreds of ethnic groups indigenous to Papua New Guinea, the majority being from the group known as Papuans, whose ancestors arrived in the New Guinea region tens of thousands of years ago. The other indigenous peoples are Austronesians, their ancestors having arrived in the region less than four thousand years ago.

There are also numerous people from other parts of the world now resident, including Chinese, Europeans, Australians, Indonesians, Filipinos, Polynesians, and Micronesians (the last four belonging to the Austronesian family). Around 50,000 expatriates, mostly from Australia and China, were living in Papua New Guinea in 1975, but most of these had moved by the 21st century. Data from the World Bank indicates that about 0.3% of the Papua New Guinean population is made up of international migrants as of 2015.

With the National Census deferred during 2020/2021, ostensibly on the grounds of the COVID-19 pandemic, an interim assessment was conducted using satellite imagery. In December 2022, a report by the UN, based upon a survey conducted with the University of Southampton using satellite imagery and ground-truthing, suggested a new population estimate of 17 million, nearly double the country&#x27;s official estimate.

=== Urbanisation ===
According to the CIA World Factbook (2018), Papua New Guinea has the second lowest urban population percentage in the world, with 13.2%, only behind Burundi. The geography and economy of Papua New Guinea are the main factors behind the low percentage. Papua New Guinea has an urbanisation rate of 2.51%, measured as the projected change in urban population from 2015 to 2020.
=== Immigration ===
==== Chinese ====

Numerous Chinese have worked and lived in Papua New Guinea, establishing Chinese-majority communities. Anti-Chinese rioting involving tens of thousands of people broke out in May 2009. The initial spark was a fight between ethnic Chinese and indigenous workers at a nickel factory under construction by a Chinese company. Native resentment against Chinese ownership of numerous small businesses and their commercial monopoly in the islands led to the rioting.

==== African ====
There is an existing collaboration between Papua New Guinea and African countries. Papua New Guinea is part of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) forum. There is a thriving community of Africans who live and work in the country.

=== Languages ===


Papua New Guinea has more languages than any other country, with over 820 indigenous languages, representing 12% of the world&#x27;s total, but most have fewer than 1,000 speakers. With an average of only 7,000 speakers per language, Papua New Guinea has a greater density of languages than any other nation on earth except Vanuatu. The most widely spoken indigenous language is Enga, with about 200,000 speakers, followed by Melpa and Huli. Indigenous languages are classified into two large groups, Austronesian languages and non-Austronesian, or Papuan, languages. There are four languages in Papua New Guinea with some statutory recognition: English, Tok Pisin, Hiri Motu, and, since 2015, sign language (which in practice means Papua New Guinean Sign Language).

English is the language of government and the education system, but it is not spoken widely. The primary lingua franca of the country is Tok Pisin (commonly known in English as New Guinean Pidgin or Melanesian Pidgin), in which much of the debate in Parliament is conducted, many information campaigns and advertisements are presented, and a national weekly newspaper, &quot;Wantok&quot;, is published. The only area where Tok Pisin is not prevalent is the southern region of Papua, where people often use the third official language, Hiri Motu. Although it lies in the Papua region, Port Moresby has a highly diverse population that primarily uses Tok Pisin, and to a lesser extent English, with Motu spoken as the indigenous language in outlying villages.

=== Religion ===
The government and judiciary uphold the constitutional right to freedom of speech, thought, and belief, and no legislation to curb those rights has been adopted. The 2011 census found that 95.6% of citizens identified themselves as Christian, 1.4% were not Christian, and 3.1% gave no answer. Virtually no respondent identified as being non-religious. Religious syncretism is high, with many citizens combining their Christian faith with some traditional indigenous religious practices. Most Christians in Papua New Guinea are Protestants, constituting roughly 70% of the total population. They are mostly represented by the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Papua New Guinea, the Seventh-day Adventist Church, diverse Pentecostal denominations, the United Church in Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands, the Evangelical Alliance Papua New Guinea, and the Anglican Church of Papua New Guinea. Apart from Protestants, there is a notable Roman Catholic minority with approximately 25% of the population.

There are approximately 5,000 Muslims in the country. The majority belong to the Sunni group. Non-traditional Christian churches and non-Christian religious groups are active throughout the country. The Papua New Guinea Council of Churches has stated that both Muslim and Confucian missionaries are highly active. Traditional religions are often animist. Some also tend to have elements of veneration of the dead, though generalisation is suspect given the extreme heterogeneity of Melanesian societies. Prevalent among traditional tribes is the belief in &quot;masalai&quot;, or evil spirits, which are blamed for &quot;poisoning&quot; people, causing calamity and death, and the practice of &quot;puripuri&quot; (sorcery).

The first Bahá&#x27;í in PNG was Violete Hoenke who arrived at Admiralty Island, from Australia, in 1954. The PNG Bahá&#x27;í community grew so quickly that in 1969 a National Spiritual Assembly (administrative council) was elected. As of 2020 there are over 30,000 members of the Bahá&#x27;í Faith in PNG. In 2012 the decision was made to erect the first Bahá&#x27;í House of Worship in PNG. Its design is that of a woven basket, a common feature of all groups and cultures in PNG. It is, therefore, hoped to be a symbol for the entire country. Its nine entrances are inspired by the design of Haus Tambaran (Spirit House). Construction began in Port Moresby in 2018.

=== Education ===
A large proportion of the population is illiterate, with women predominating in this area. Much of the education in PNG is provided by church institutions. This includes 500 schools of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Papua New Guinea. Papua New Guinea has six universities as well as other tertiary institutions. The two founding universities are the University of Papua New Guinea, based in the National Capital District, and the Papua New Guinea University of Technology, based outside of Lae, in Morobe Province.

The four other universities were once colleges but have since been recognised by the government. These are the University of Goroka in the Eastern Highlands province, Divine Word University (run by the Catholic Church&#x27;s Divine Word Missionaries) in Madang Province, Vudal University in East New Britain Province, and Pacific Adventist University (run by the Seventh-day Adventist Church) in the National Capital District.

The Human Rights Measurement Initiative reports that Papua New Guinea is achieving 68.5% of what should be possible for the right to education, based on their level of income.

=== Health ===

As of 2019, life expectancy in Papua New Guinea at birth was 63 years for men and 67 for women. Government expenditure health in 2014 accounted for 9.5% of total government spending, with total health expenditure equating to 4.3% of GDP. There were five physicians per 100,000 people in the early 2000s. The 2010 maternal mortality rate per 100,000 births for Papua New Guinea was 250. This is compared with 311.9 in 2008 and 476.3 in 1990. The under-5 mortality rate, per 1,000 births is 69 and the neonatal mortality as a percentage of under-5s&#x27; mortality is 37. In Papua New Guinea, the number of midwives per 1,000 live births is 1 and the lifetime risk of death for pregnant women is 1 in 94.

The Human Rights Measurement Initiative finds that Papua New Guinea is achieving 71.9% of what should be possible for the right to health, based on their level of income.

== Culture ==


It is estimated that more than one thousand cultural groups exist in Papua New Guinea. Because of this diversity, many styles of cultural expression have emerged. Each group has created its own expressive forms in art, dance, weaponry, costumes, singing, music, architecture and much more. Most of these cultural groups have their own language. People typically live in villages that rely on subsistence farming. In some areas people hunt and collect wild plants (such as yam roots and karuka) to supplement their diets. Those who become skilled at hunting, farming and fishing earn a great deal of respect.

Seashells are no longer the currency of Papua New Guinea, as they were in some regions—sea shells were abolished as currency in 1933. This tradition is still present in local customs. In some cultures, to get a bride, a groom must bring a certain number of golden-edged clam shells as a bride price. In other regions, the bride price is paid in lengths of shell money, pigs, cassowaries or cash. Elsewhere, it is brides who traditionally pay a dowry.

People of the highlands engage in colourful local rituals that are called &quot;sing sings.&quot; They paint themselves and dress up with feathers, pearls and animal skins to represent birds, trees or mountain spirits. Sometimes an important event, such as a legendary battle, is enacted at such a musical festival.

The country possesses one UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Kuk Early Agricultural Site, which was inscribed in 2008. The country, however, has no elements inscribed yet in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists, despite having one of the widest arrays of intangible cultural heritage elements in the world.

=== Sport ===
Sport is an important part of Papua New Guinean culture, and rugby league is by far the most popular sport. In a nation where communities are far apart and many people live at a minimal subsistence level, rugby league has been described as a replacement for tribal warfare as a way of explaining the local enthusiasm for the game. Many Papua New Guineans have become celebrities by representing their country or playing in an overseas professional league. Even Australian rugby league players who have played in the annual State of Origin series, which is celebrated every year in PNG, are among the most well-known people throughout the nation. State of Origin is a highlight of the year for most Papua New Guineans, although the support is so passionate that many people have died over the years in violent clashes supporting their team. The Papua New Guinea national rugby league team usually plays against the Australian Prime Minister&#x27;s XIII (a selection of NRL players) each year, normally in Port Moresby.

Although not as popular, Australian rules football is significant in another way, as the national team is ranked second, only after Australia. Other major sports that have a part in the Papua New Guinea sporting landscape are netball, association football, rugby union, basketball and, in eastern Papua, cricket.

<text>Pitcairn Island is the only inhabited island of the Pitcairn Islands, in the southern Pacific Ocean, of which many inhabitants are descendants of mutineers of HMS &quot;Bounty&quot;.

== Geography ==

The island is of volcanic origin, with a rugged cliff coastline. Unlike many other South Pacific islands, it is not surrounded by coral reefs that protect the coast. The only access to the island is via a small pier on Bounty Bay. Adamstown is the sole settlement.

Pawala Valley Ridge is the island&#x27;s highest point at 346 m above sea level.

The volcanic soil and tropical climate with abundant rainfall make the soil productive.

The average temperature ranges from 19 to 24°C. The annual rainfall is 1,800 mm.

== Fauna ==

Indigenous fauna consists of insects and lizards. Since their introduction, rats have become an invasive species.

A large number of seabirds nest along the steep shorelines.

As coral reefs are absent, fishing is offshore. Sharks, sea bream, barracudas and tuna are all abundant. Whale migrations are seen yearly.

<doc id="22948" wikidata="Q41127" url="?curid=22948" title="Poseidon">
<text>Poseidon (; ) is one of the twelve Olympians in ancient Greek religion and mythology, presiding over the sea, storms, earthquakes and horses. He was the protector of seafarers and the guardian of many Hellenic cities and colonies. In pre-Olympian Bronze Age Greece, Poseidon was venerated as a chief deity at Pylos and Thebes, with the cult title &quot;earth shaker&quot;; in the myths of isolated Arcadia, he is related to Demeter and Persephone and was venerated as a horse, and as a god of the waters. Poseidon maintained both associations among most Greeks: he was regarded as the tamer or father of horses, who, with a strike of his trident, created springs (the terms for horses and springs are related in the Greek language). His Roman equivalent is Neptune.
Homer and Hesiod suggest that Poseidon became lord of the sea when, following the overthrow of his father Cronus, the world was divided by lot among Cronus&#x27; three sons; Zeus was given the sky, Hades the underworld, and Poseidon the sea, with the Earth and Mount Olympus belonging to all three. In Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, Poseidon supports the Greeks against the Trojans during the Trojan War; in the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, during the sea-voyage from Troy back home to Ithaca, the Greek hero Odysseus provokes Poseidon&#x27;s fury by blinding his son, the Cyclops Polyphemus, resulting in Poseidon punishing him with storms, causing the complete loss of his ship and companions, and delaying his return by ten years. Poseidon is also the subject of a Homeric hymn. In Plato&#x27;s &quot;Timaeus&quot; and &quot;Critias&quot;, the legendary island of Atlantis was Poseidon&#x27;s domain.

Poseidon is famous for his contests with other deities for winning the patronage of the city. According to legend, Athena became the patron goddess of the city of Athens after a competition with Poseidon, though he remained on the Acropolis in the form of his surrogate, Erechtheus. After the fight, Poseidon sent a monstrous flood to the Attic plain to punish the Athenians for not choosing him. In similar competitions with other deities in different cities, he causes devastating floods when he loses. Poseidon is a horrifying and avenging god and must be honoured even when he is not the patron deity of the city.

Some scholars suggested that Poseidon was probably a Pelasgian god or a god of the Minyans. However it is possible that Poseidon, like Zeus, was a common god of all Greeks from the beginning.

== Etymology ==
The earliest attested occurrence of the name, written in Linear B, is &quot;Po-se-da-o&quot; or &quot;Po-se-da-wo-ne&quot;, which correspond to (&quot;Poseidaōn&quot;) and (&quot;Poseidawοnos&quot;) in Mycenean Greek; in Homeric Greek, it appears as (&quot;Posidaōn&quot;); in Aeolic, as (&quot;Pote(i)daōn&quot;); in Doric, as (&quot;Poteidan&quot;) and (&quot;Poteidas&quot;); in Arcadic, as (&quot;Posoidan&quot;). In inscriptions with Laconic style from Tainaron, Helos and Thuria as (&quot;Pohoidan&quot;), indicating that the Dorians took the name from the older population. The form (&quot;Poteidawōn&quot;) appears in Corinth.

The origins of the name &quot;Poseidon&quot; are unclear and the possible etymologies are contradictive among the scholars. One theory breaks it down into an element meaning &quot;husband&quot; or &quot;lord&quot; (Greek (&quot;posis&quot;), from PIE &quot;*pótis&quot;) and another element meaning &quot;earth&quot; &quot;(&quot; (&quot;da&quot;), Doric for (&quot;gē&quot;)), producing something like lord or spouse of &quot;Da&quot;, i.e. of the earth; this would link him with Demeter, &quot;Earth-mother&quot;. Burkert finds that &quot;the second element &quot;δᾶ-&quot; remains hopelessly ambiguous&quot; and finds a &quot;husband of Earth&quot; reading &quot;quite impossible to prove&quot;. According to Beekes in &quot;Etymological Dictionary of Greek&quot;, &quot;there is no indication that &quot;δᾶ&quot; means &#x27;earth&#x27;&quot;, although the root &quot;da&quot; appears in the Linear B inscription &quot;E-ne-si-da-o-ne&quot;, &quot;earth-shaker&quot;.

Another theory interprets the second element as related to the (presumed) Doric word *δᾶϝον &quot;dâwon&quot;, &quot;water&quot;, Proto-Indo-European &quot;*dah₂-&quot; &quot;water&quot; or &quot;*dʰenh₂-&quot; &quot;to run, flow&quot;, Sanskrit दन् &quot;dā́-nu-&quot; &quot;fluid, drop, dew&quot; and names of rivers such as Danube (&lt; &quot;*Danuvius&quot;) or Don. This would make *&quot;Posei-dawōn&quot; into the master of waters.

Plato in his dialogue Cratylus gives two traditional etymologies: either the sea restrained Poseidon when walking as a &quot;foot-bond&quot; (ποσίδεσμον), or he &quot;knew many things&quot; (πολλά εἰδότος or πολλά εἰδῶν).

Beekes suggests that the word has probably a Pre-Greek origin. The original form was probably the Mycenean Greek (&quot;Pot(s)eidawōn&quot;). &quot;The inervocalic aspiration suggests a Pre Greek (Pelasgian) origin rather than an Indoeuropean one&quot;.

==Bronze Age Greece==
===Linear B (Mycenean Greek) inscriptions===
If surviving Linear B clay tablets can be trusted, the 
names &quot;po-se-da-wo-ne&quot; and &quot;Po-se-da-o&quot; (&quot;Poseidon&quot;) occur with greater frequency than does &quot;di-u-ja&quot; (&quot;Zeus&quot;). A feminine variant, &quot;po-se-de-ia&quot;, is also found, indicating a lost consort goddess, in effect the precursor of Amphitrite.

Poseidon was the chief god at Pylos. The title &quot;wa-na-ka&quot; appears in the inscriptions. Poseidon was identified with &quot;wanax&quot; from the Homeric era to classical Greece. (anax). The title didn&#x27;t mean only king, but also protector. &quot;Wanax&quot; had chthonic aspects, and he was closely associated with Poseidon, who had the title &quot;Lord of the Underworld&quot;. The chthonic nature of Poseidon is also indicated by his title &quot;E-ne-si-da-o-ne&quot; (Earth-shaker) in Mycenean Knossos and Pylos. Through Homer the epithet was also used in classical Greece. (ennosigaios, ennosidas).

&quot;Po-tini-ja&quot; (potnia: lady or mistress) was the chief goddess at Pylos and she was closely associated with Poseidon. She was the Mycenean goddess of nature and Poseidon—&quot;Wanax&quot; is one from the gods who may be considered her &quot;male paredros&quot;. The &quot;earth shaker&quot; received offerings in the cave of the goddess of childbirth Eileithyia at Amnisos in Crete. Poseidon is allied with &quot;Potnia&quot; and the divine child.

&quot;Wa-na-ssa&quot; (anassa:queen or lady) appears in the inscriptions usually in plural. (Wa-na-ssoi). The dual number is common in Indoeuropean grammar (usually for chthonic deities like the Erinyes) and the duality was used for Demeter and Persephone in classical Greece (the double named goddesses). &quot;Potnia&quot; and &quot;wanassa&quot; refer to identical deities or two aspects of the same deity.

&quot;E-ri-nu&quot; (Erinys) is attested in the inscriptions. In some ancient cults &quot;Erinys&quot; is related to Poseidon and her name is an epithet of Demeter.

It is possible that Demeter appears as &quot;Da-ma-te&quot; in a Linear B inscription (PN EN 609), however the interpretation is still under dispute. &quot;Si-to Po-tini-ja&quot; is probably related with Demeter as goddess of grain.

Tablets from Pylos record sacrificial goods destined for &quot;the Two ladies and the Lord&quot; (or &quot;to the Two Queens and the King&quot;: &quot;wa-na-soi&quot;, &quot;wa-na-ka-te&quot;). &quot;Wa-na-ssoi&quot; may be related with Demeter and Persephone, or their precursors, goddesses who were not associated with Poseidon in later periods.

===Mycenean cult===
During the Mycenean period, the ancestral male gods of the Myceneans were probably not represented in human forms, and the information given by the tablets found at Pylos and Knossos is insufficient. Poseidon was the chief deity at Pylos and Thebes. He is identified with Anax and he carried the title &quot;Master of the Underworld&quot;. Anax had probably a cult associated with the protection of the palace. In Acrocorinth he was worshipped as &quot;Poseidon Anax&quot; during the Mycenean age. In the city there was the famous spring Peirene which in a myth is related to the winged horse Pegasus. In Attica there was a cult of &quot;Anax heroes&quot; who was connected to Poseidon. A cult title of Poseidon was &quot;earth-shaker&quot; and in Knossos he was worshipped together with the goddess Eleithyia who was related to the annual birth of the divine child. Potnia was the Mycenean goddess of nature and she was the consort of Poseidon at Pylos. She is mentioned together with bucrania in decorated jugs and he was associated with the animals and especially to the bull. In Athens Poseidon was an inland god who created the salt-sea &quot;Erecthēιs&quot; (), &quot;sea of Erechtheus&quot;. In Acropolis his cult was superimposed on the cult of the local ancestral figure Erechtheus. In Athens and Asine he was worshipped in the house of the king during the Mycenean period. The bull was the favourite animal for sacrifices and it seems that horses were rarely used during the burial of the Mycenean leaders.

===Arcadian myths===

In the Arcadian myths, Poseidon is related to Demeter and Despoina (another name of &quot;Kore- Persephone&quot;) and he was worshipped with the surname &quot;Hippios&quot; in many Arcadian cities. At Thelpusa and Phigalia there were sister worships which are very important for the study of primitive religions. In these cults Demeter and Poseidon were chthonic divinities of the underworld.

Near Thelpusa the river Ladon descended to the sunctuary of Demeter &quot;Erinys&quot; (Demeter-Fury). During her wandering in search of her daughter Demeter changed into a mare to avoid Poseidon. Poseidon took the form of a stallion and after their mating she gave birth to a daughter whose name was not allowed to be told to the unitiated and a horse called Arion (very swift). Her daughter obviously had the shape of a mare too. At first Demeter became angry and she was given the surname Erinys (fury) by the Thelpusians. The Erinyes were deities of vangeance, and &quot;Erinys&quot; had a similar function with the goddess Dike (Justice). In the very old myth of Thelpusa Demeter-Erinys and Poseidon are divinities of the underworld in a pre-mythic period. Poseidon appears as a horse. In Greek folklore the horses had chthonic associations and it was believed that they could create springs. In European folklore the water-creatures or water-spirits appear with the shape of a horse or a bull. In Greece the river god Acheloos is represented like a bull or a man-bull. Many people when sacrificed to Demeter should make a premilinary sacrifice to Acheloos 

At Phigalia Demeter had a sanctuary in a cavern and she was given the surname &quot;Melaina&quot; (black). The goddess was related to the black undeworld. In a similar myth Poseidon appears as horse and Demeter gives birth to a daughter whose name was not allowed to be told to the unitiated (At Lycosura her daughter was called Despoina). Demeter angry with Poseidon put on a black dressing and shut herself in the cavern. When the fruits of the earth were perished, Zeus sent the Moirai to Demeter who listened to them and led aside her wrath. In this cult we have traces of a very old cult of Demeter and Poseidon as deities of the underworld.

In another Arcadian myth when Rhea had given birth to Poseidon, she told Cronus that she had given birth to a horse, and gave him a foal to swallow instead of the child. In the Homeric Hymn Demeter puts a dark mourning robe around her shoulders as a sign of her sorrow. Demeter&#x27;s mare-form was worshipped into historical times. The xoanon of &quot;Melaina &quot;at Phigalia shows how the local cult interpreted her, as goddess of nature. A Medusa type with a horse&#x27;s head with snaky hair, holding a dove and a dolphin, probably representing her power over air and water.

===Boeotian myths===
The myth of Poseidon appearing as a horse and mating with Demeter was not localized in Arcadia. At Haliartos in Boeotia near Thebes Poseidon appears as stallion. He mates with Erinys near the spring of &quot;Tilpousa&quot; and she gives birth to the faboulous horse Arion. At Tilpusa we have a very old cult of the chthonic deities &quot;Erinys&quot; and Poseidon. The water-god Poseidon appears as a horse which seems to represent the water-spirit and &quot;Erinys&quot; is probably the personification of a revenging earth-spirit. From earlier times at Delphi Poseidon was joined in a religious union with the earth-goddess Ge. She is represented as a snake which is a form of the earth-spirit.

In the Theogony of Hesiod Poseidon once slept with the monstrous Medousa near the mountain Helikon. She conceived the winged horse Pegasus who sprang out of her body when Perseus cut off her head. Pegasus stuck the ground with his hoof and created the famous spring Hippocrene near Helikon. 
Praxidicai were female deities of judicial punishment worshipped in the region of Haliartos in the historical times. Ttheir origin is probably the same with &quot;Erinys&quot;. Their images depicted only the heads of the goddesses probably a representation of the earth goddess emerging from the ground. Praxidice is and epithet of Persephone in the Orphic Hymn. Persephone is sometimes depicted with her head emerging from the ground.

==Origins==
During the Mycenean period Poseidon was worshipped in several regions in Greece. At Pylos and some other cities he was a god of the underworld (Lord of the Underworld) and his cult was related to the protection of the palace. He carried the title anax, king or protector. His consort potnia, lady or mistress, was the Mycenean goddess of nature. Her main aspects were birth and vegetation. Poseidon had the title &quot;Enesidaon&quot; (earth-shaker) and in Crete he was associated with the goddess of childbirth Eleithyia. Through Homer the Mycenean titles were also used in classical Greece with similar meaning. He was identified with &quot;anax&quot; and he carried the epithets &quot;Ennosigaios&quot; and &quot;Ennosidas&quot; (earth-shaker). &quot;Potnia&quot; was a title which accompanied female goddesses. The goddess of nature survived in the Eleusinian cult, where the following words were uttered: &quot;Mighty Potnia bore a strong son&quot;. In the heavily sea-dependent Mycenaean culture, there is not sufficient evidence that Poseidon was connected with the sea; it is unclear whether &quot;Posedeia&quot; was a sea-goddess. The Greeks invaders came from far inland and they were not familiarized with the sea.

In the primitive Boeotian and Arcadian myths Poseidon, the god of the underworld, appears as a horse and he is mating with the earth goddess. The earth goddess is called Erinys or Demeter and she gives birth to the fabulous horse Arion and the unnamed daughter Despoina, which is another name of Persephone. The horse represents the divine spirit (numen) and is related to the liquid element and the underworld. In Greek folklore the horse is associated with the underworld and it was believed that it had the ability to create springs. In the European folklore the water-spirit appears with the shape of a horse or a bull. In Greece the river god Acheloos is represented as a bull or a man-bull. Burkert suggests that the Hellenic cult of Poseidon as a horse god may be connected to the introduction of the horse and war-chariot from Anatolia to Greece around 1600 BC.

In the Boeotian myth Poseidon is the water-god and &quot;Erinys&quot; is a goddess of the underworld.
She is probably the personification of a revenging earth spirit and it seems that she had a similar function with the goddess Dike (Justice). At the spring &quot;Tilpousa&quot; she gives birth to Arion. In the Arcadian myth Poseidon &quot;Hippios&quot; (horse) is mating with the mare-Demeter. At Thelpousa &quot;Demeter-Erinys&quot; gives birth to Arion and to an unnamable daughter who has the shape of a mare. In some neighbour cults the daughter was called Despoina (mistress), which is another name of Persephone. The theriomorphic form of gods seems to be local in Arcadia in an old religion associated with xoana.
According to some theories Poseidon was a Pelasgian god or a god of the Minyans. Traditionally the Minyans are considered Pelasgians and they lived in Thessaly and Boeotia. In Thessaly (Pelasgiotis) there was a close relation to the horses. Poseidon created the first horse &quot;Skyphios&quot; hitting a rock with his trident and managed in the same way to drain the valley of Tempe. The Thessalians were famous charioteers. Some of the oldest Greek myths appear in Boeotia. In ancient cults Poseidon was worshipped as a horse. The horse Arion was a sire of Poseidon-horse with Erinys and the winged horse Pegasus a sire of Poseidon foaled by Medousa. At Onchestos he had an old famous festival which included horseracing. However it is possible that Poseidon like Zeus was a common god of all Greeks from the beginning.

It is possible that the Greeks did not bring with them other gods except Zeus, Eos, and the Dioskouroi. The Pelasgian god probably represented the fertilising power of water, and then he was he was considered god of the sea. As the sea encircles and holds the earth in its position, Poseidon is the god who holds the earth and who has the ability to shake the earth. The primeval water who encircled the earth ( Oceanus) is the origin of all rivers and springs. They are children of Oceanus and Tethys.

Farnell suggested that Poseidon was originally the god of the Minyans who occupied Thessaly and Boeotia. There is a similarity between the Boeotian and Arcadian myths and especially between the myths which represent the god of the waters Poseidon as a horse. The mythical horse Arion appears in both regions. The offspring of Poseidon winged horse Pegasus creates famous springs near Helikon and at Troizen. Some springs of Poseidon have similar names in Boeotia and Peloponnese. It is possible that the name of Poseidon &quot;Helikonios&quot; in Boeotia whose fest included horseracing derives from the mountain Helikon. The Minyans had trade contacts with Mycenean Pylos and the Achaeans adopted the cult of Poseidon &quot;Helikonios&quot;. The cult spread in Peloponnese and then to Ionia when the Achaeans migrated to Asia Minor.
Nilsson suggested that Poseidon was probably a common god of all Greeks from the beginning. The Greeks occupied Thessaly, Boeotia and Peloponnese during the Bronze Age. In all these regions Poseidon was the god of the horses. The origin of his cult was Peloponnese and he was the inland god of the Achaeans, the god of the &quot;horses&quot; and the &quot;earthquakes&quot;. When the Achaeans migrated to Ionia there was a transition to regarding Poseidon as the god of the sea because the Ionians were sea-dependent. With no doubt he was originally the god of the waters. The Greeks believed that the cause of the earthquakes was the erosion of the rocks by the waters, by the rivers in Peloponnese which they saw to disappear into the earth and then to burst out again. The god of the waters became the &quot;earth-shaker&quot;. This is what the natural philosophers Thales Anaximenes and Aristotle believed and could not be different from the folk belief. 
 In the Greek legends Arethusa and the river Alpheus traversed underground under the sea and reappeared at Ortygia.

In any case, the early importance of Poseidon can still be glimpsed in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, where Poseidon rather than Zeus is the major mover of events. In Homer, Poseidon is the master of the sea. He is described as a majestic, scary, and avenging monarch of the sea.

==Cult==
:I begin to sing about Poseidon, the great god,
:mover of the earth and fruitless sea
:god of the deep who is also lord of Helicon and wide Aegae.
:A two-fold office the gods allotted you,
:O Shaker of the Earth, to be a tamer of horses
:and a saviour of ships!
:Hail, Poseidon, Holder of the Earth, dark-haired lord!
:O blessed one, be kindly in heart
:and help those who voyage in ships!
:(Homeric Hymn to Poseidon)

The worship of Poseidon was extended all over Greece and southern Italy, but he was specially honoured in Peloponnese which is called &quot;the residence of Poseidon&quot; and in the Ionic cities. The significance of his cult is indicated by the names of cities like Poteidaia in the Chalkidiki peninsula and &quot;Poseidonia&quot; (Paestum), a Greek colony in Italy. &quot;Poseidion&quot; is a frequent Greek placename along coastlines and the name of a Greek colony at the Syrian coast.

In Ionia his cult was introduced by Achaean colonists from Greece in the 11th century BC. Traditionally the colonists came from Pylos where Poseidon was the principal god of the city. The god had a famous temple near the mountain Mycale. The month Poseidaon is the month of the winter-storms. The name of the month was used in Ionic territories, in Athens, in the islands of the Aegean and in the cities of Asia Minor. At Lesbos and Epidauros the month was called &quot;Poseidios&quot;. During this month Poseidon was worshipped as the &quot;master of the sea&quot; in a bright cult.
 
Poseidon was a major civic god of several cities: in Athens, he was second only to Athena in importance, while in Corinth and many cities of Ionia and Magna Graecia he was the chief god of the polis. Many fests of Poseidon included athletic competitions and horseracing.
In Corinth his cult was related to the Isthmian games. In Arcadia his cult was related to the games &quot;Hippocrateia&quot; and at Sparta he had a temple near an Hippodrome. In Onchestos of Boeotia horseracing was a part of the athletic games in honour of the god.

Poseidon was considered a symbol of unity. The Panionia the festival of all Ionians near Mycale were celebrated in honour of Poseidon &quot;Helikonios&quot; and was the place of meeting of the Ionian League. He was the patron god of the Amphictiony of Kalaureia. At Onchestos of Boeotia he was worshipped as Poseidon &quot;Helikonios&quot;. His sanctuary became the place of meeting of the second Boeotian league. At Helike of Achaea there was the famous temple of Poseidon &quot;Helikonios&quot;, which was the place of meeting of the Achaean League.

The &quot;master of the sea&quot; creates
clouds and storms, but he is also the protector of the sailors. He has the ability to calm the sea for a good voyage and save those who are in danger. He was worshipped with the surname &quot;savior&quot; as the protector of the seafarers and the fishermen. He is the &quot;earthshaker&quot;, however he is also the protector against the earthquakes. In some cults he was worshipped as the &quot;bringer of safety&quot; or &quot;protector of the house and the foundations&quot;.
The god was considered the creator of the first horse, and it was believed that he taught men the art of taming horses. He was depicted on horseback, or riding in a chariot drawn by two or four horses. He had a lot of temples in Arcadia, with the surname &quot;Hippios&quot; (of the horse) and he was also transformed into a horse to seduce Demeter.
Being the god of waters, Poseidon is related to the primeval water which encircles the earth (Oceanus), who is the father of all rivers and springs. He can create springs with the strike of his trident. He was worshipped as &quot;ruler of the springs&quot; and &quot;leader of the nymphs&quot; In Thessaly it was believed that he drained the area cutting the rocks of Tempe with his trident. In Greek folklore the horse can also create springs .

As god of the sea Poseidon was also god of fishing and especially of sea-fishing. Tuna was offered to him by the fishermen during the festal meal for the protection of the nets . Tuna and later dolphin was his attribute. He was worshipped in many islands and cities by the coast. At Corcyra a roaring bull near the sea-shore quaranteed a good fishing. The devastating storm of Poseidon is related to fishermen and they poured drink offerings to Poseidon -&quot;savior&quot; into the sea. The god of inland waters is very close to vegetation and Poseidon was worshipped in many cities as god of vegetation. Haloa in Athens was a fest of vegetation. The &quot;Protrygaia&quot;, a wine-fest seem to belong to Dionysus and Poseidon.

In several cities Poseidon was worshipped in relation to the genealogy and the phratry. At Tinos he was worshipped as a healer-god, probably a forerunner of the famous Evangelistria.

The bull is related to Poseidon mainly in Ionia. The sacrifice of a bull offered to Poseidon is mentioned by Homer in an Ionic festival (Panionia). The sacrifices offered to Poseidon consisted of black and white bulls which were killed or thrown into the sea. Boars and rams were also used and in Argolis horses were thrown into a well as a sacrifice to him.
In his benign aspect, Poseidon was seen as creating new islands and offering calm seas. When offended or ignored, he supposedly struck the ground with his trident and caused chaotic springs, earthquakes, drownings and shipwrecks.
Sailors prayed to Poseidon for a safe voyage, sometimes drowning horses as a sacrifice; in this way, according to a fragmentary papyrus, Alexander the Great paused at the Syrian seashore before the climactic battle of Issus, and resorted to prayers, &quot;invoking Poseidon the sea-god, for whom he ordered a four-horse chariot to be cast into the waves&quot;.

According to Pausanias, Poseidon was one of the caretakers of the oracle at Delphi before Olympian Apollo took it over. Apollo and Poseidon worked closely in many realms: in colonization, for example, Delphic Apollo provided the authorization to go out and settle, while Poseidon watched over the colonists on their way, and provided the lustral water for the foundation-sacrifice. At one time Delphi belonged to him in common with Ge, but Apollo gave him the psychopompeion Kalaureia as a compensation for it.

Xenophon&#x27;s &quot;Anabasis&quot; describes a group of Spartan soldiers in 400–399 BC singing to Poseidon a paean—a kind of hymn normally sung for Apollo. Like Dionysus, who inflamed the maenads, Poseidon also caused certain forms of mental disturbance. A Hippocratic text of ca 400 BC, &quot;On the Sacred Disease&quot; says that he was blamed for certain types of epilepsy.

Poseidon is still worshipped today in modern Hellenic religion, among other Greek gods. The worship of Greek gods has been recognized by the Greek government since 2017.

=== Epithets and attributes===
Poseidon had a variety of roles, duties and attributes. He is a separate deity from the oldest Greek god of the sea Pontus. In Athens his name is superimposed οn the name of the non-Greek god Erechtheus (&quot;Poseidon Erechtheus&quot;). 
In the Iliad, he is the lord of the sea and his golden palace is built in Aegai, in the depth of the sea. His significance is indicated by his titles &quot;Eurykreion&quot; () &quot;wide-ruling&quot;, an epithet also applied to Agamemnon and &quot;Helikonios anax&quot; (), &quot;lord of Helicon or Helike&quot; In Helike of Achaia he was specially honoured. &quot;Anax&quot; is identified in Mycenaean Greek (Linear B) as &quot;wa-na-ka&quot;, a title of Poseidon as king of the underworld. Aeschylus uses also the epithet &quot;anax&quot; and Pindar the epithet &quot;Eurymedon&quot; () &quot;widely ruling&quot;.

Some of the epithets (or adjectives) applied to him like &quot;Enosigaios&quot; (), &quot;Enosichthon&quot; () (Homer) and &quot;Ennosidas&quot; () (Pindar), mean &quot;earth shaker&quot;. These epithets indicate his chthonic nature, and have an older evidence of use, as it is identified in Linear B, as , &quot;E-ne-si-da-o-ne&quot;. Other epithets that relate him with the earthquakes are &quot;Gaieochos&quot; () and &quot;Seisichthon&quot; () 
The god who causes the earthquakes is also the protector against them, and he had the epithets &quot;Themeliouchos&quot; () &quot;upholding the foundations&quot;, &quot;Asphaleios&quot; () &quot;securer, protector&quot; with a temple at Tainaron. Pausanias describes a sanctuary of Poseidon near Sparta beside the shrine of Alcon, where he had the surname &quot;Domatites&quot; (), &quot;of the house&quot;

Homer uses for Poseidon the title &quot;Kyanochaites&quot; (), &quot;dark-haired, dark blue of the sea&quot;. Epithets like &quot;Pelagios&quot; () &quot;of the open sea&quot;, &quot;Aegeus&quot; (), &quot;of the high sea&quot; in the town of Aegae in Euboea, where he had a magnificent temple upon a hill, &quot;Pontomedon&quot; (),&quot; lord of the sea&quot; (Pindar, Aeschylus) and &quot;Kymothales&quot; (), &quot;abounding with waves&quot;, indicate that Poseidon was regarded as holding sway over the sea. Other epithets that relate him with the sea are, &quot;Porthmios&quot; (), &quot;of strait, narrow sea&quot; at Karpathos, &quot;Epactaeus&quot; () &quot;god worshipped on the coast&quot;, in Samos, &quot;Alidoupos&quot;, () &quot;sea resounding&quot;. The master of the sea who can cause devastating storms is also the protector of seafarers and he was given the epithet &quot;sōtēr&quot; (), &quot;savior&quot;.

His symbol is the trident and he has the epithet &quot;Eutriaina&quot; (), &quot;with goodly trident&quot; (Pindar). The god of the sea is also the god of fishing, and tuna was his attribute. At Lampsacus they offered fishes to Poseidon and he had the epithet &quot;phytalmios&quot; () His epithet &quot;Phykios&quot; (), &quot;god of seaweeds&quot; at Mykonos, seems to be related with fishing. He had a fest where women were not allowed, with special offers also to &quot;Poseidon Temenites&quot; () &quot;related to an official domain &quot;. At the same day they made offers to &quot;Demeter Chloe&quot; therefore Poseidon was the promotor of vegetation. He had the epithet &quot;phytalmios&quot; () at Myconos, Troizen, Megara and Rhodes, comparable with &quot;Ptorthios&quot; () at Chalcis.

Poseidon had a close association with horses. He is known under the epithet &quot;Hippios&quot; (), &quot;of a horse or horses&quot; usually in Arcadia. He had temples at Lycosura, Mantineia, Methydrium, Pheneos, Pallandion.

At Lycosura he is related with the cult of Despoina. The modern sanctuary near Mantineia was built by Emperor Hadrian. In Athens on the hill of horses there was the altar of &quot; Poseidon Hippios&quot; and &quot;Athena Hippia&quot;. The temple of Poseidon was destroyed by Antigonus when he attacked Attica. He is usually the tamer of horses (&quot;Damaios&quot;, at Corinth), and the tender of horses &quot;Hippokourios&quot; ) at Sparta, where he had a sanctuary near the sanctuary of &quot;Artemis Aiginea&quot;. In some myths he is the father of horses, either by spilling his seed upon a rock or by mating with a creature who then gave birth to the first horse. In Thessaly he had the title &quot;Petraios&quot; , &quot;of the rocks&quot;. He hit a rock and the first horse &quot;Skyphios&quot; appeared. He was closely related with the springs, and with the strike of his trident, he created springs. He had the epithets &quot;Krenouchos&quot; (), &quot;ruling over springs&quot;, and &quot;nymphagetes&quot; () &quot;leader of the nymphs&quot; On the Acropolis of Athens he created the saltspring &quot;Sea of Erechtheus&quot; (). Many springs like Hippocrene and Aganippe in Helikon are related with the word horse (hippos). (also Glukippe, Hyperippe). He is the father of Pegasus, whose name is derived from , (&quot;pēgē&quot;) &quot;spring&quot;.

Epithets like &quot;Genesios&quot; at Lerna &quot;Genethlios&quot; () &quot;of the race or family&quot; &quot;Phratrios&quot; () &quot;of the brotherhood&quot;, and &quot;Patrigenios&quot; () indicate his relation with the genealogy trees and the brotherhood.

Other epithets of Poseidon in local cults are &quot;Epoptes&quot; (), &quot;overseer, watcher&quot; at Megalopolis, &quot;Empylios&quot; (), &quot;at the gate &quot; at Thebes, &quot;Kronios&quot; () (Pindar) and &quot;semnos&quot; (), &quot;august, holy&quot; (Sophocles).

Some of Poseidon&#x27;s epithets are related to festivals and athletic games including racing. At Corinth the Isthmian games was an athletic and music festival in honour of the god who had the epithet &quot;Isthmios&quot; (). At Sparta there was the race &quot;in Gaiaochō&quot;. () Poseidon &quot;Gaiēochos&quot; () had a temple near the city beside an Hippodrome. At Mantineia and Pallandion in Arcadia the &quot;Hippokrateia&quot; () were athletic games in honour of Poseidon &quot;Hippeios&quot; (). At Ephesus there was a fest &quot;Tavria&quot; and he had the epithet &quot;Taureios&quot; (), &quot;related with the bull&quot;.

===Festivals===

==Temples of Poseidon==
The Corinthians are considered to be the inventors of the Doric order. However Corinth was completely destroyed and rebuilt and there is not sufficient evidence for the existence of earliest Doric Greek temples in the city. A building constructed in early 7th century BC c.690-650 BC at Isthmia near Corinth which was later dedicated to Poseidon, is considered a pioneering building featuring Doric architecture. It seems that the first temple with pure Doric elements was built with the aid of Corinthians at Thermon in Aetolia in the middle of 7th century BC century. c.640-630 BC. It was a peripteral narrow wooden structure dedicated to Apollo, It measured 12.13 X38.23 m at the stylobate and the number of pteron columns was 5X15.

In the earlier temples the peripteral colonnade is treated with a freedom unknown to later Doric architects. This is in part an especially western feature (in Italy) because the hexastyle scheme was adopted as in the temple of Poseidon at Taranto and the second temple of Hera at Paestum (traditionally named temple of Poseidon). In the earlier temples where the number of the columns in the porch is odd, so are the columns of the pteron facade. In such temples the side ptera are approximately the width of one or two intercolumniations. In the hexastyle scheme like the temple of Poseidon at Sounion, there are normally two or four columns in the porch and the side ptera are approximately the width of one intercolumniation. In Doric early work the distance between column and column differs on the fronts and on the flanks and this can be observed in the temple of Poseidon at Kalaureia and in &quot;Basilica&quot; at Paestum. After the 6th century the rule in Doric is an approximate equality of intercolumniations and it can be observed in the temple of Poseidon at Sounion, where there is a slight difference.

* Isthmia. The temple dedicated later to the god Poseidon was probably built in early 7th century BC c.690-650 BC in the city Isthmia near Corinth and it had a wooden peristyle. The building was completely destroyed in 470 BC and it seems that it was one of the pioneering buildings featuring Doric architecture. The ground plan showed a temple that was of epic proportions for its time and of a layout that was almost entirely new, however there was no evidence for the employment of the Doric style as it was suggested 

* Paestum, on the west coast of Italy near Naples. The Greek name of the city was Poseidonia. The Doric temple was built in the early 6th century BC and it was believed that it was a temple of Poseidon. Traditionally this name is associated with the 5th century BC temple at Paestum, however recent excavations indicate that both temples were dedicated to Hera. The so-called &quot;Basilica&quot; measured 24,5 X54,3 m at the stylobate and the number of pteron columns was 9x18. The temple is wider than most Greek temples it had two doors. This may indicate a dual dedication of the temple.
*A Doric temple the so-called temple of Poseidon was built in the first half of the 5th century BC and is usually placed later than Parthenon. The temple measured 24,3 X 60,00 m at the stylobate. It was an hexastyle structure and the number of pteron columns was 6X14. The temple was also used to worship Zeus and another deity, whose identity is unknown.
*Taranto, a city of Magna Graecia in Italy. Τhe temple of Poseidon was a perpiteral Doric temple, however its exact plan cannot be outlined. It was probably built in the 6th century BC and it seems that the number of pteron columns was 6X13. The interval of the remaining columns is 3.72 m, indicating that the maximum dimensions of the temple at the stylobate could be 22,32X 47,46 m.
* Sounion in Attica. The first temple of Poseidon (formerly called temple of Athena) was built in 490 BC and it was destroyed by the Persians before completion. It measured 13,12 X30,34 m at the stylobate and the number of pteron columns was 6X13. There is a slight difference between the front and back intercolumniations and those of the flanks. There was probably a double row of inner columns. (close wall, engaged). The cella with porches and adyta measured c.9.00 X21,20m 
*The second temple was built in 425 BC and it was modelled on its predecessor. It measured 13.48 X 31.15 m at the stylobate and the number of pteron columns was 6X13. An Ionic frieze carried across pteron and continued round interior of each end of pteron. The cella with porches and adyta measured c.9.00 X21,20m. The temple probably contained, at one end facing the entrance, a colossal, bronze statue of Poseidon. 
*Kalaureia, an island close to the coast of Troezen in the Peloponnese, part of the modern island-pair Poros. Early roof tiles from c.650 BC suggest the existence of a precursor to the Late Archaic temple of Poseidon. This Doric temple was probably built in the middle of the 6th century BC, constructed mainly of poros stone. It measured 14,50 X27,00 m at the stylobate and the number of the pteron columns was 6X12. Both front and back intercolumniations were wider than those on the flanks. The building was surrounded by a low wall with the main entrance on the east side.

*Hermione in Argolis.The most remarkable temple in the time of Pausanias was the temple of Poseidon. The temple was built in the Late archaic-Early classical period, in the late 6th century BC. It was completely destroyed and its foundations at the peninsula of &quot;Bisti&quot; (Poseidio) indicate that the temple measured approximately 15,00 X30,00 m at the stylobate.
*Tainaron .The sacred sanctuary of Poseidon was built in a cave at the Tainaron peninsula. The path to the interior, carved into the rock, was preparing him who wanted to get into the psychopompeion. It also functioned as a necromancy and oneiromancy temple. The temple was also established as a place for persecuted who fled there for protection.
*Tinos, an island of Cyclades. The temple of Poseidon and Amphitrite was built near a beach of the island, in the 4th century BC (Hellenistic period). It was a peripteral Doric temple, which was reconstructed in the 3rd century BC. The temple was made of local marble and had some representations of the god&#x27;s symbols, such as dolphins and the trident.

==Mythology==
=== Birth ===
In the standard version, Poseidon was born to the Titans Cronus and Rhea, the fifth child out of six, born after Hestia, Demeter, Hera and Hades in that order. Because Poseidon&#x27;s father was afraid that one of his children would overthrow him like he had done to his own father, Cronus devoured each infant as soon as they were born. Poseidon was the last one to suffer this fate before Rhea decided to deceive Cronus and whisk the sixth child, Zeus, away to safety, after offering Cronus a rock wrapped in a blanket to eat. Once Zeus was grown, he gave his father a powerful emetic that made him gorge up the children he had eaten. The five children emerged from their father&#x27;s belly in reverse order, making Poseidon both the second youngest child and the second oldest at the same time. Armed with a trident forged for him by the Cyclopes, Poseidon with his siblings and other divine allies defeated the Titans and became rulers in their place. According to Homer and Apollodorus, Zeus, Poseidon and the third brother Hades then divided the world between them by drawing lots; Zeus got the sky, Poseidon the sea, and Hades the Underworld.

In a rarer - and later- version, Poseidon avoided being devoured by his father as his mother Rhea saved him in the same manner she did Zeus, by offering Cronus a foal instead, claiming she had given birth to a horse instead of a god, while she had actually laid the child in a flock. Rhea entrusted her infant to a spring nymph. When Cronus demanded the child, the nymph Arne denied having him, and her spring thereafter was called Arne (which bears resemblance to the Greek word for &#x27;deny&#x27;).

In another tale, Rhea gave Poseidon to the Telchines, ancient inhabitants of the island of Rhodes; Capheira, an Oceanid nymph, became the young god&#x27;s nurse. As Poseidon grew, he fell in love with Halia, the beautiful sister of the Telchines, and fathered six sons and one daughter, Rhodos, on her. By that time Aphrodite, the goddess of love, had been born and risen from the sea, and attempted to make a stop at Rhodes on her way to Cyprus. Poseidon and Halia&#x27;s sons denied her hospitality, so Aphrodite cursed them to fall in love and rape Halia. After they had done so, Poseidon made them sink below the sea.

In Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Poseidon has a home in &quot;Aegae&quot;.

=== City patronage ===
==== Foundation of Athens ====
Athena became the patron goddess of the city of Athens after a competition with Poseidon. Yet Poseidon remained a numinous presence on the Acropolis in the form of his surrogate, Erechtheus. At the dissolution festival at the end of the year in the Athenian calendar, the Skira, the priests of Athena and the priest of Poseidon would process under canopies to Eleusis. They agreed that each would give the Athenians one gift and the Athenians would choose whichever gift they preferred. Poseidon struck the ground with his trident and a spring sprang up; the water was salty and not very useful, whereas Athena offered them an olive tree.

The Athenians or their king, Cecrops, accepted the olive tree and along with it Athena as their patron, for the olive tree brought wood, oil and food. After the fight, infuriated at his loss, Poseidon sent a monstrous flood to the Attic Plain, to punish the Athenians for not choosing him. The depression made by Poseidon&#x27;s trident and filled with salt water was surrounded by the northern hall of the Erechtheum, remaining open to the air.

Burkert noted :&quot;In cult, Poseidon was identified with Erechtheus&quot; and &quot;the myth turns this into a temporal-causal sequence: in his anger at losing, Poseidon led his son Eumolpus against Athens and killed Erectheus.&quot;

It was also said that Poseidon in his anger over his defeat sent one of his sons, Halirrhothius, to cut down Athena&#x27;s tree gift. But as Halirrhothius swung his axe, he missed his aim and it fell in himself, killing him instantly. Poseidon in fury accused Ares of murder, and the matter was eventually settled on the Areopagus (&quot;hill of Ares&quot;) in favour of Ares, which was thereafter named after the event. In other versions, Halirrhothius raped Alcippe, Ares&#x27;s daughter, so Ares slew him. Poseidon was enraged over the murder of his son, and Ares was thus held in hold, which eventually acquitted him.

The contest of Athena and Poseidon was the subject of the reliefs on the western pediment of the Parthenon, the first sight that greeted the arriving visitor.

This myth is construed by Robert Graves and others as reflecting a clash between the inhabitants during Mycenaean times and newer immigrants. Athens at its height was a significant sea power, at one point defeating the Persian fleet at Salamis Island in a sea battle.

==== Others ====
The Corinthians had a similar story to the foundations of Athens, about their own city Corinth. According to the myth, Helios and Poseidon clashed, both desiring to make the city their own. Their dispute was brought to one of the Hecatoncheires, Briareos, an elder god, who was thus tasked to settle the fight between the two gods. Briareus decided to award the Acrocorinth to Helios, while to Poseidon he gave the isthmus of Corinth. In this tale, Helios and Poseidon are supposed to represent fire versus water. Helios, as the sun god, received the area that is closest to the sky, while Poseidon, who is the sea god, got the isthmus by the sea.

At another time, Poseidon came to an agreement with another goddess, Leto, that he would give her the island of Delos in exchange for the island of Calauria; he also exchanged Delphi for Taenarum with Apollo. A temple of Poseidon stood at Calauria during ancient times. Poseidon also came to dispute with his sister Hera over the city of Argos. A local king was chosen to settle the matter, Phoroneus, and he decided to award the city to Hera, who then became its patroness. Poseidon was enraged, and sent a drought to plague the city. One day, as an Argive woman named Amymone went out in search of water, came upon a satyr who tried to rape her. Amymone prayed to Poseidon for help, and he scared the satyr away with his trident. After Poseidon rescued Amymone from the lecherous satyr he fathered a child on her, Nauplius.

=== Walls of Troy ===
Poseidon and Apollo, having offended Zeus by their rebellion in Hera&#x27;s scheme, were temporarily stripped of their divine authority and sent to serve King Laomedon of Troy. He had them build huge walls around the city and promised to reward them with his immortal horses, a promise he then refused to fulfill. In vengeance, before the Trojan War, Poseidon sent a sea monster to attack Troy. The monster was later killed by Heracles.

=== Theseus ===
Poseidon fathered the hero Theseus with the Troezenian princess Aethra. Theseus was also said to be the son of Aegeus, the king of Athens, who slept with Aethra on the very same night. Thus Theseus&#x27;s origins included both the human and the divine element.

Meanwhile, in Crete, Zeus&#x27;s son Minos asked for Poseidon&#x27;s help in order to certify his claim on the throne of Crete. Poseidon offered Minos a splendid white bull, with the understanding that he was to sacrifice the bull to Poseidon later. The Cretans were so impressed with the bull and the divine sign itself that Minos was declared king of Crete. But wishing to keep the beautiful animal for himself, Minos instead sacrificed an ordinary bull to the sea-god instead of the agreed upon one.

Poseidon, enraged, caused Minos&#x27;s wife, Pasiphae, to fall in love with the bull; their coupling produced the Minotaur, a half-bull half-human creature who fed on human flesh. Minos concealed him within the labyrinth built by Daedalus, and fed to him Athenian men and women he forced Aegeus to send him over.

Once Theseus was grown up and recognized by his father Aegeus in Athens, he decided to end the bloody tax Athens had to pay to Crete once and for all, and volunteered to set sail to Crete along with the other Athenian youths who had been chosen to be devoured by the Minotaur.

Once he arrived in Crete, Minos insulted Theseus and insisted he was no son of Poseidon; to demonstrate so, he threw his own ring in to the sea, and commanded Theseus to retrieve it, expecting he would not be able to do so. Theseus immediately dove in after it.
Dolphins then came as guides and escorted him to the halls of Poseidon and Amphitrite&#x27;s palace, where he was warmly welcomed. He received the ring, and in addition a purple wedding cloak and a crown from Amphitrite, to prove his words. Theseus then emerged from the sea and gave the ring to Minos. Theseus killed the Minotaur, and in time succeeded his father Aegeus as king of Athens. By an Amazon he had a son, Hippolytus, while his wife Phaedra (Minos&#x27; daughter) gave him two sons.

At some point, Poseidon promised three favours to Theseus, and he called upon Poseidon to fulfill one of those when Phaedra falsely accused Hippolytus of forcing himself on her. Theseus, not knowing the truth, asked his father to destroy Hippolytus; Poseidon granted his son&#x27;s wish, and as Hippolytus was driving by the sea, Poseidon sent a terrifying sea monster to spook the man&#x27;s horses, which then dragged him to his death.

=== Consort, lovers, victims and children ===
Poseidon was said to have had many lovers of both sexes. His consort was Amphitrite, a nymph and ancient sea-goddess, daughter of Nereus and Doris. In one account, attributed to Eratosthenes, Poseidon wished to wed Amphitrite, but she fled from him and hid with Atlas. Poseidon sent out many to find her, and it was a dolphin who tracked her down. The dolphin persuaded Amphitrite to accept Poseidon as her husband, and eventually took charge of their wedding. Poseidon then put him among the stars as a reward for his good services. Oppian says that the dolphin betrayed Amphitrite&#x27;s whereabouts to Poseidon, and he carried off Amphitrite against her will to marry her. Together they had a son named Triton, a merman. Poseidon was the father of many heroes. He is thought to have fathered the famed Theseus. Poseidon also had an affair with Alope, his granddaughter through Cercyon, his son and King of Eleusis, begetting the Attic hero Hippothoon. Cercyon had his daughter buried alive but Poseidon turned her into the spring, Alope, near Eleusis.

A mortal woman named Cleito once lived on an isolated island; Poseidon fell in love with the human mortal and created a dwelling sanctuary at the top of a hill near the middle of the island and surrounded the dwelling with rings of water and land to protect her. She gave birth to five sets of twin boys; the firstborn, Atlas, became the first ruler of Atlantis.
Alebion and Bergion and Otos and Ephialtae (the giants).

Not all of Poseidon&#x27;s children were human. His other children include Polyphemus (the Cyclops) and, finally, Amycus was the son of Poseidon and the Bithynian nymph Melia. The philosopher Plato was held by his fellow ancient Greeks to have traced his descent to the sea-God Poseidon through his father Ariston and his mythic predecessors the demigod kings Codrus and Melanthus.

Poseidon also took the young Nerites, the son of Nereus and Doris (and thus brother to Amphitrite) as a lover. Nerites was also Poseidon&#x27;s charioteer, and impressed all marine creatures with his speed. But one day the sun god, Helios, turned Nerites into a shellfish. Aelian, who recorded this tale as told by mariners, says it is not clear why Helios did this, but theorizes he might have been offended somehow, or that he and Poseidon were rivals in love, and Helios wanted Nerites to travel among the constellations instead of the sea-monsters. From the love between Poseidon and Nerites was born Anteros, mutual love.

Other male lovers included Pelops and Patroclus.

==== Rape and assault victims ====
A mortal woman named Tyro was married to Cretheus (with whom she had one son, Aeson), but loved Enipeus, a river god. She pursued Enipeus, who refused her advances. One day, Poseidon, filled with lust for Tyro, disguised himself as Enipeus, and from their union were born the heroes Pelias and Neleus, twin boys.

In an archaic myth, Poseidon once pursued Demeter. She spurned his advances, turning herself into a mare so that she could hide in a herd of horses; he saw through the deception and became a stallion, captured and raped her. Their child was a horse, Arion, which was capable of human speech. According to Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;, Poseidon &quot;lay down in a soft meadow among spring flowers&quot; with the Gorgon Medusa and two offspring, the winged horse Pegasus and the warrior Chrysaor, were born when the hero Perseus cut off Medusa&#x27;s head. 

Ovid however says that Medusa was originally a very beautiful maiden whom Poseidon raped inside the temple of Athena. Athena, furious over the sacrilege, changed the beautiful girl into a monster. Elsewhere in the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, Ovid says that Poseidon seduced Medusa in the form of a bird.

One day, Poseidon spotted Caenis walking by the seashore, caught her and raped her. Having enjoyed her greatly, he offered her a wish, any wish. Traumatized, Caenis wished to be transformed into a man, so that she would never experience assault again. Poseidon fulfilled her request and changed her into a male warrior, who then took the name Caeneus.

Another time Poseidon once fell in love with a Phocian woman, Corone, the daughter of Coronaeus as she was walking along the shore. He attempted to court her, but she rejected him, and ran away. Poseidon then chased her down with the aim to rape her. Athena, witnessing all that, took pity in the girl and changed her into a crow.

When Zeus fell in love and pursued the goddess Asteria, she transformed into a quail and flung herself into the sea to escape being raped by him. Poseidon then, equally rapacious, picked up the chase where Zeus had left it and chased Asteria with the aim to force himself on her, so Asteria had to transform for a second time to save herself, this time into a small rocky island named Delos.

==== List of offspring and their mothers ====
The following is a list of Poseidon&#x27;s offspring, by various mothers. Beside each offspring, the earliest source to record the parentage is given, along with the century to which the source (in some cases approximately) dates.


==Genealogy ==









== In literature and art ==
In Greek art, Poseidon rides a chariot that was pulled by a hippocampus or by horses that could ride on the sea. He was associated with dolphins and three-pronged fish spears (tridents). He lived in a palace on the ocean floor, made of coral and gems.

In the &quot;Iliad,&quot; Poseidon favors the Greeks, and on several occasion takes an active part in the battle against the Trojan forces. However, in Book XX he rescues Aeneas after the Trojan prince is laid low by Achilles.

In the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Poseidon is notable for his hatred of Odysseus who blinded the god&#x27;s son, the Cyclops Polyphemus. The enmity of Poseidon prevents Odysseus&#x27;s return home to Ithaca for many years. Odysseus is even told, notwithstanding his ultimate safe return, that to placate the wrath of Poseidon will require one more voyage on his part.

In the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, Neptune is still resentful of the wandering Trojans, but is not as vindictive as Juno, and in Book I he rescues the Trojan fleet from the goddess&#x27;s attempts to wreck it, although his primary motivation for doing this is his annoyance at Juno&#x27;s having intruded into his domain.

A hymn to Poseidon included among the Homeric Hymns is a brief invocation, a seven-line introduction that addresses the god as both &quot;mover of the earth and barren sea, god of the deep who is also lord of Mount Helicon and wide Aegae, and specifies his twofold nature as an Olympian: &quot;a tamer of horses and a saviour of ships&quot;.

==In modern culture==

Due to his status as a Greek god, Poseidon has made multiple appearances in modern and popular culture.

Poseidon appeared in the 1963 film &quot;Jason and the Argonauts&quot;.

Poseidon appears in the &quot;Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians&quot; novel series, where he is the father of the demigod protagonist Percy Jackson. In the first film adaptation, &quot;Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians: The Lightning Thief&quot;, he is portrayed by Kevin McKidd. In the Disney+ adaptation, he is portrayed by Toby Stephens.

Poseidon has made multiple appearances in video games, such as in &quot;God of War 3&quot; by Sony. In the game, Poseidon appears as a boss for the player to defeat. He also appears in &quot;Smite&quot; as a playable character. In the video game &quot;Hades&quot;, he is a character who will grant &quot;boons&quot;.

Poseidon appears as a primary antagonist in &quot;&quot;, a sung-through adaptation of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;. He is voiced by Steven Rodriguez.

<text>Population is the term typically used to refer to the number of people in a single area. Governments conduct a census to quantify the size of a resident population within a given jurisdiction. The term is also applied to non-human animals, microorganisms, and plants, and has specific uses within such fields as ecology and genetics.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;population&quot; is derived from the Late Latin &quot;populatio&quot; (a people, a multitude), which itself is derived from the Latin word &quot;populus&quot; (a people).

== Use of the term ==
=== Social sciences ===

In sociology and population geography, population refers to a group of human beings with some predefined feature in common, such as location, race, ethnicity, nationality, or religion.

=== Ecology ===

In ecology, a population is a group of organisms of the same species which inhabit the same geographical area and are capable of interbreeding. The area of a sexual population is the area where interbreeding is possible between any opposite-sex pair within the area and more probable than cross-breeding with individuals from other areas.

In humans, interbreeding is unrestricted by racial differences, as all humans belong to the same species of Homo sapiens.

In ecology, the population of a certain species in a certain area can be estimated using the Lincoln index to calculate the total population of an area based on the number of individuals observed.

==== Dynamics ====
=== Genetics ===
In genetics, a &quot;population&quot; is often defined as a set of organisms in which any pair of members can breed together. They can thus routinely exchange gametes in order to have usually fertile progeny, and such a breeding group is also known therefore as a gamodeme. This also implies that all members belong to the same species.
If the gamodeme is very large (theoretically, approaching infinity), and all gene alleles are uniformly distributed by the gametes within it, the gamodeme is said to be panmictic. Under this state, allele (gamete) frequencies can be converted to genotype (zygote) frequencies by expanding an appropriate quadratic equation, as shown by Sir Ronald Fisher in his establishment of quantitative genetics.

This seldom occurs in nature: localization of gamete exchange – through dispersal limitations, preferential mating, cataclysm, or other cause – may lead to small actual gamodemes which exchange gametes reasonably uniformly within themselves but are virtually separated from their neighboring gamodemes. However, there may be low frequencies of exchange with these neighbors. This may be viewed as the breaking up of a large sexual population (panmictic) into smaller overlapping sexual populations. This failure of panmixia leads to two important changes in overall population structure: (1) the component gamodemes vary (through gamete sampling) in their allele frequencies when compared with each other and with the theoretical panmictic original (this is known as dispersion, and its details can be estimated using expansion of an appropriate binomial equation); and (2) the level of homozygosity rises in the entire collection of gamodemes. The overall rise in homozygosity is quantified by the inbreeding coefficient (f or φ). All homozygotes are increased in frequency – both the deleterious and the desirable. The mean phenotype of the gamodemes collection is lower than that of the panmictic original – which is known as inbreeding depression. It is most important to note, however, that some dispersion lines will be superior to the panmictic original, while some will be about the same, and some will be inferior. The probabilities of each can be estimated from those binomial equations. In plant and animal breeding, procedures have been developed which deliberately utilize the effects of dispersion (such as line breeding, pure-line breeding, backcrossing). Dispersion-assisted selection leads to the greatest genetic advance (ΔG=change in the phenotypic mean), and is much more powerful than selection acting without attendant dispersion. This is so for both allogamous (random fertilization) and autogamous (self-fertilization) gamodemes.

== World human population ==
According to the UN, the world&#x27;s population surpassed 8 billion on 15 November 2022, an increase of 1 billion since 12 March 2012. According to a separate estimate by the United Nations, Earth&#x27;s population exceeded seven billion in October 2011. According to UNFPA, growth to such an extent offers unprecedented challenges and opportunities to all of humanity.

According to papers published by the United States Census Bureau, the world population hit 6.5 billion on 24 February 2006. The United Nations Population Fund designated 12 October 1999 as the approximate day on which world population reached 6 billion. This was about 12 years after the world population reached 5 billion in 1987, and six years after the world population reached 5.5 billion in 1993. The population of countries such as Nigeria is not even known to the nearest million, so there is a considerable margin of error in such estimates.

Researcher Carl Haub calculated that a total of over 100 billion people have probably been born in the last 2000 years.

=== Predicted growth and decline ===

Population growth increased significantly as the Industrial Revolution gathered pace from 1700 onwards. The last 50 years have seen a yet more rapid increase in the rate of population growth due to medical advances and substantial increases in agricultural productivity, particularly beginning in the 1960s, made by the Green Revolution. In 2017 the United Nations Population Division projected that the world&#x27;s population would reach about 11.6 billion in 2050 and 24.8 billion in 2100.

In the future, the world&#x27;s population is expected to peak at some point, after which it will decline due to economic reasons, health concerns, land exhaustion and environmental hazards. According to one report, it is very likely that the world&#x27;s population will stop growing before the end of the 21st century. Further, there is some likelihood that population will actually decline before 2100. Population has already declined in the last decade or two in Eastern Europe, the Baltics and in the former Commonwealth of Independent States.

The population pattern of less-developed regions of the world in recent years has been marked by gradually declining birth rates. These followed an earlier sharp reduction in death rates. This transition from high birth and death rates to low birth and death rates is often referred to as the demographic transition.

=== Population planning ===
Human population planning is the practice of changing the rate of growth of a human population. Historically, human population control has been implemented with the goal of limiting the rate of population growth. In the time from the 1950s to the 1980s, concerns about global population growth and its effects on poverty, environmental degradation, and political stability led to efforts to reduce population growth rates. While population control can involve measures that make people&#x27;s lives better by giving them greater control of their reproduction, a few programs, most notably the Chinese government&#x27;s one-child per family policy, have resorted to coercive measures.

In the 1970s, tension grew between population control advocates and women&#x27;s health activists who advanced women&#x27;s reproductive rights as part of a human rights-based approach. Growing opposition to the narrow population control focus led to a significant change in population control policies in the early 1980s.

<doc id="22951" wikidata="Q1362786" url="?curid=22951" title="Psychological egoism">
<text>Psychological egoism is the view that humans are always motivated by self-interest and selfishness, even in what seem to be acts of altruism. It claims that, when people choose to help others, they do so ultimately because of the personal benefits that they themselves expect to obtain, directly or indirectly, from doing so.

This is a descriptive rather than normative view, since it only makes claims about how things are, not how they &quot;ought to be&quot; according to some. It is, however, related to several other normative forms of egoism, such as ethical egoism and rational egoism.

==Subtypes of psychological egoism==

===Psychological hedonism===
A specific form of psychological egoism is psychological hedonism, the view that the ultimate motive for all voluntary human action is the desire to experience pleasure or to avoid pain. 

Immediate gratification can be sacrificed for a chance of greater, future pleasure. Further, humans are not motivated to strictly avoid pain and only pursue pleasure, but, instead, humans will endure pain to achieve the greatest net pleasure. Accordingly, all actions are tools for increasing pleasure or decreasing pain, even those defined as altruistic and those that do not cause an immediate change in satisfaction levels.

The most famous psychological egoists are Sextus Empiricus, Pierre Bayle, and Bernard Mandeville.

===Final cause===
Some theorists explain behavior motivated by self-interest without using pleasure and pain as the final causes of behavior.

==Foundations==
Beginning with ancient philosophy, Epicureanism claims humans live to maximize pleasure. Epicurus argued the theory of human behavior being motivated by pleasure alone is evidenced from infancy to adulthood. Humanity performs altruistic, honorable, and virtuous acts not for the sake of another or because of a moral code but rather to increase the well-being of the self.

In modern philosophy, Jeremy Bentham asserted, like Epicurus, that human behavior is governed by a need to increase pleasure and decrease pain. Bentham explicitly described what types and qualities of pain and pleasure exist, and how human motives are singularly explained using psychological hedonism. Bentham attempted to quantify psychological hedonism. Bentham endeavored to find the ideal human behavior based on hedonic calculus or the measurement of relative gains and losses in pain and pleasure to determine the most pleasurable action a human could choose in a situation.

From an evolutionary perspective, Herbert Spencer, a psychological egoist, argued that all animals primarily seek to survive and protect their lineage. Essentially, the need for the individual and for the individual&#x27;s immediate family to live supersedes the others&#x27; need to live. All species attempt to maximize their own chances of survival and, therefore, well-being. Spencer asserted the best adapted creatures will have their pleasure levels outweigh their pain levels in their environments. Thus, pleasure meant an animal was fulfilling its egoist goal of self survival, and pleasure would always be pursued because species constantly strive for survival.

==Contributions to modern psychology==

===Psychoanalysis===
Whether or not Sigmund Freud was a psychological egoist, his concept of the pleasure principle borrowed much from psychological egoism and psychological hedonism in particular. The pleasure principle rules the behavior of the Id which is an unconscious force driving humans to release tension from unfulfilled desires. When Freud introduced Thanatos and its opposing force, Eros, the pleasure principle emanating from psychological hedonism became aligned with the Eros, which drives a person to satiate sexual and reproductive desires. Alternatively, Thanatos seeks the cessation of pain through death and the end of the pursuit of pleasure: thus, hedonism rules Thanatos, but it centers on the complete avoidance of pain rather than psychological hedonist function which pursues pleasure and avoids pain. Therefore, Freud believed in qualitatively different hedonisms where the total avoidance of pain hedonism and the achievement of the greatest net pleasure hedonism are separate and associated with distinct functions and drives of the human psyche. Although Eros and Thanatos are ruled by qualitatively different types of hedonism, Eros remains under the rule of Jeremy Bentham&#x27;s quantitative psychological hedonism because Eros seeks the greatest net pleasure.

===Behaviorism===
Traditional behaviorism dictates all human behavior is explained by classical conditioning and operant conditioning. Operant conditioning works through reinforcement and punishment which adds or removes pleasure and pain to manipulate behavior. Using pleasure and pain to control behavior means behaviorists assumed the principles of psychological hedonism could be applied to predicting human behavior. For example, Thorndike&#x27;s law of effect states that behaviors associated with pleasantness will be learned and those associated with pain will be extinguished. Often, behaviorist experiments using humans and animals are built around the assumption that subjects will pursue pleasure and avoid pain. Although psychological hedonism is incorporated into the fundamental principles and experimental designs of behaviorism, behaviorism itself explains and interprets only observable behavior and therefore does not theorize about the ultimate cause of human behavior. Thus, behaviorism uses but does not strictly support psychological hedonism over other understandings of the ultimate drive of human behavior.

== Debate ==
Psychological egoism is controversial. Proponents cite evidence from introspection: reflection on one&#x27;s own actions may reveal their motives and intended results to be based on self-interest. Psychological hedonists have found through numerous observations of natural human behavior that behavior can be manipulated through reward and punishment, both of which have direct effects of pain and pleasure. Also, the work of some social scientists has empirically supported this theory. Further, they claim psychological egoism posits a theory that is a more parsimonious explanation than competing theories.

Opponents have argued that psychological egoism is not more parsimonious than other theories. For example, a theory that claims altruism occurs for the sake of altruism explains altruism with less complexity than the egoistic approach. The psychological egoist asserts humans act altruistically for selfish reasons even when cost of the altruistic action is far outweighed by the reward of acting selfishly because altruism is performed to fulfill the desire of a person to act altruistically. Other critics argue that it is false either because it is an over-simplified interpretation of behavior or that there exists empirical evidence of altruistic behaviour. Recently, some have argued that evolutionary theory provides evidence against it.

Critics have stated that proponents of psychological egoism often confuse the satisfaction of their own desires with the satisfaction of their own &quot;self-regarding&quot; desires. Even though it is true that every human being seeks their own satisfaction, this sometimes may only be achieved via the well-being of their neighbor. An example of this situation could be phoning for an ambulance when a car accident has happened. In this case, the caller desires the well-being of the victim, even though the desire itself is the caller&#x27;s own.

To counter this critique, psychological egoism asserts that all such desires for the well-being of others are ultimately derived from self-interest. For example, German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche was a psychological egoist for some of his career, though he is said to have repudiated that later in his campaign against morality. He argues in §133 of &quot;The Dawn&quot; that in such cases compassionate impulses arise out of the projection of our identity unto the object of our feeling. He gives some hypothetical examples as illustrations to his thesis: that of a person, feeling horrified after witnessing a personal feud, coughing blood, or that of the impulse felt to save a person who is drowning in the water. In such cases, according to Nietzsche, there comes into play unconscious fears regarding our own safety. The suffering of another person is felt as a threat to our own happiness and sense of safety, because it reveals our own vulnerability to misfortunes, and thus, by relieving it, one could also ameliorate those personal sentiments. Essentially, proponents argue that altruism is rooted in self-interest whereas opponents claim altruism occurs for altruism&#x27;s sake or is caused by a non-selfish reason.

== Problem of apparent altruism ==
David Hume once wrote, &quot;What interest can a fond mother have in view, who loses her health by assiduous attendance on her sick child, and afterwards languishes and dies of grief, when freed, by its death [the child&#x27;s], from the slavery of that attendance?&quot;. It seems incorrect to describe such a mother&#x27;s goal as self-interested.

Psychological egoists, however, respond that helping others in such ways is ultimately motivated by some form of self-interest, such as non-sensory satisfaction, the expectation of reciprocation, the desire to gain respect or reputation, or by the expectation of a reward in a putative afterlife. The helpful action is merely instrumental to these ultimately selfish goals.

In the ninth century, Mohammed Ibn Al-Jahm Al-Barmaki () has been quoted saying:

This sort of explanation appears to be close to the view of La Rochefoucauld (and perhaps Hobbes).

According to psychological hedonism, the ultimate egoistic motive is to gain good feelings of pleasure and avoid bad feelings of pain. Other, less restricted forms of psychological egoism may allow the ultimate goal of a person to include such things as avoiding punishments from oneself or others (such as guilt or shame) and attaining rewards (such as pride, self-worth, power or reciprocal beneficial action).

Some psychologists explain empathy in terms of psychological hedonism. According to the &quot;merge with others hypothesis&quot;, empathy increases the more an individual feels like they are one with another person, and decreases accordingly. Therefore, altruistic actions emanating from empathy, and empathy itself, are caused by making others&#x27; interests our own, and the satisfaction of their desires becomes our own, not just theirs. Both cognitive studies and neuropsychological experiments have provided evidence for this theory: as humans increase our oneness with others, our empathy increases, and as empathy increases, so too does our inclination to act altruistically. Neuropsychological studies have linked mirror neurons to humans experiencing empathy. Mirror neurons are activated both when a human (or animal) performs an action and when they observe another human (or animal) perform the same action. Researchers have found that the more these mirror neurons fire the more human subjects report empathy. From a neurological perspective, scientists argue that when a human empathizes with another, the brain operates as if the human is actually participating in the actions of the other person. Thus, when performing altruistic actions motivated by empathy, humans experience someone else&#x27;s pleasure of being helped. Therefore, in performing acts of altruism, people act in their own self-interest even at a neurological level.

== Criticism ==

=== Circularity ===
Psychological egoism has been accused of being circular: &quot;If a person willingly performs an act, that means he derives personal enjoyment from it; therefore, people only perform acts that give them personal enjoyment.&quot; In particular, seemingly altruistic acts must be performed because people derive enjoyment from them and are therefore, in reality, egoistic. This statement is circular because its conclusion is identical to its hypothesis: it assumes that people only perform acts that give them personal enjoyment, and concludes that people only perform acts that give them personal enjoyment. This objection was tendered by William Hazlitt and Thomas Macaulay in the 19th century, and has been restated many times since. An earlier version of the same objection was made by Joseph Butler in the &quot;Fifteen Sermons&quot;.

Joel Feinberg, in his 1958 paper &quot;Psychological Egoism&quot;, embraces a similar critique by drawing attention to the infinite regress of psychological egoism. He expounds it in the following cross-examination:

:&quot;All men desire only satisfaction.&quot;

:&quot;Satisfaction of what?&quot;

:&quot;Satisfaction of their desires.&quot;

:&quot;Their desires for what?&quot;

:&quot;Their desires for satisfaction.&quot;

:&quot;Satisfaction of what?&quot;

:&quot;Their desires.&quot;

:&quot;For what?&quot;

:&quot;For satisfaction&quot;—etc., &quot;ad infinitum&quot;.

=== Evolutionary argument ===
In their 1998 book, &quot;Unto Others&quot;, Sober and Wilson detailed an evolutionary argument based on the likelihood for egoism to evolve under the pressures of natural selection. Specifically, they focus on the human behavior of parental care. To set up their argument, they propose two potential psychological mechanisms for this. The hedonistic mechanism is based on a parent&#x27;s ultimate desire for pleasure or the avoidance of pain and a belief that caring for its offspring will be instrumental to that. The altruistic mechanism is based on an altruistic ultimate desire to care for its offspring.

Sober and Wilson argue that when evaluating the likelihood of a given trait to evolve, three factors must be considered: availability, reliability and energetic efficiency. The genes for a given trait must first be &quot;available&quot; in the gene pool for selection. The trait must then &quot;reliably&quot; produce an increase in fitness for the organism. The trait must also operate with &quot;energetic efficiency&quot; to not limit the fitness of the organism. Sober and Wilson argue that there is neither reason to suppose that an altruistic mechanism should be any less available than a hedonistic one nor reason to suppose that the content of thoughts and desires (hedonistic vs. altruistic) should impact energetic efficiency. As availability and energetic efficiency are taken to be equivalent for both mechanisms it follows that the more reliable mechanism will then be the more likely mechanism.

For the hedonistic mechanism to produce the behavior of caring for offspring, the parent must believe that the caring behavior will produce pleasure or avoidance of pain for the parent. Sober and Wilson argue that the belief also must be true and constantly reinforced, or it would not be likely enough to persist. If the belief fails then the behavior is not produced. The altruistic mechanism does not rely on belief; therefore, they argue that it would be less likely to fail than the alternative, i.e. more reliable.

=== Equivocation ===
In philosopher Derek Parfit&#x27;s 2011 book &quot;On What Matters&quot;, Volume 1, Parfit presents an argument against psychological egoism that centers around an apparent equivocation between different senses of the word &quot;want&quot;:

:The word &quot;desire&quot; often refers to our sensual desires or appetites, or to our being attracted to something, by finding the thought of it appealing. I shall use ‘desire’ in a wider sense, which refers to any state of being motivated, or of wanting something to happen and being to some degree disposed to make it happen, if we can. The word &quot;want&quot; already has both these senses.

According to Parfit, the argument for psychological egoism fails, because it uses the word &quot;want&quot; first in the wide sense and then in the narrow sense. If I voluntarily gave up my life to save the lives of several strangers, my act would not be selfish, though I would be doing what in the wide sense I wanted to do.

<doc id="22954" wikidata="Q859" url="?curid=22954" title="Plato">
<text>Plato ( ; Greek: , ; born  BC, died 348 BC) was an ancient Greek philosopher of the Classical period who is considered a foundational thinker in Western philosophy and an innovator of the written dialogue and dialectic forms. He influenced all the major areas of theoretical philosophy and practical philosophy, and was the founder of the Platonic Academy, a philosophical school in Athens where Plato taught the doctrines that would later become known as Platonism. 
Plato&#x27;s most famous contribution is the theory of forms (or ideas), which aims to solve what is now known as the problem of universals. He was influenced by the pre-Socratic thinkers Pythagoras, Heraclitus, and Parmenides, although much of what is known about them is derived from Plato himself.

Along with his teacher Socrates, and his student Aristotle, Plato is a central figure in the history of Western philosophy. Plato&#x27;s complete works are believed to have survived for over 2,400 yearsunlike that of nearly all of his contemporaries. Although their popularity has fluctuated, they have consistently been read and studied through the ages. Through Neoplatonism, he also influenced both Christian and Islamic philosophy. In modern times, Alfred North Whitehead said: &quot;the safest general characterization of the European philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato.&quot;

== Name ==

There is a traditional story that 
Plato is a nickname. According to Diogenes Laërtius, writing hundreds of years after Plato&#x27;s death, his birth name was &quot;Aristocles&quot; (), meaning &#x27;best reputation&#x27;. () sounds like &quot;Platus&quot; or &quot;Platos&quot;, meaning &#x27;broad&#x27;, and according to Diogenes&#x27; sources, Plato gained his nickname either from his wrestling coach, Ariston of Argos, who dubbed him &quot;broad&quot; on account of his chest and shoulders, or he gained it from the breadth of his eloquence, or his wide forehead. Philodemus, in extracts from the Herculaneum papyri, corroborates the claim that Plato was named for his &quot;broad forehead&quot;. Seneca the Younger, writing hundreds of years after Plato&#x27;s death, writes &quot;His very name was given him because of his broad chest.&quot;

According to the traditional story, Plato was originally named after his paternal grandfather, supposedly called Aristocles; the name &quot;Plato&quot; was only used as a nickname; and the philosopher could not have been named &quot;Plato&quot; because that name does not occur previously in his family line.

Modern scholarship tends to reject the &quot;Aristocles&quot; story. Plato always called himself &quot;Platon&quot;. &quot;Platon&quot; was a fairly common name (31 instances are known from Athens alone), including people named before Plato was born. Robin Waterfield states that Plato was not a nickname, but a perfectly normal name, and &quot;the common practice of naming a son after his grandfather was reserved for the eldest son&quot;, not Plato. According to Debra Nails, Plato&#x27;s grandfather was the Aristocles who was archon in 605/4.

== Biography ==

Plato was born in Athens or Aegina, between 428 and 423 BC. He was a member of an aristocratic and influential family. His father was Ariston, who may have been a descendant of two kings, Codrus and Melanthus. His mother was Perictione, descendant of Solon, a statesman credited with laying the foundations of Athenian democracy. Plato had two brothers, Glaucon and Adeimantus, a sister, Potone, and a half brother, Antiphon.

Plato may have travelled to Italy, Sicily, Egypt, and Cyrene. At 40, he founded a school of philosophy, the Academy. It was located in Athens, on a plot of land in the Grove of Hecademus or Academus, named after an Attic hero in Greek mythology. The operated until it was destroyed by Sulla in 84 BC. Many philosophers studied at the , the most prominent being Aristotle.

According to Diogenes Laërtius, throughout his later life, Plato became entangled with the politics of the city of Syracuse, where he attempted to replace the tyrant Dionysius, with Dionysius&#x27;s brother-in-law, Dion of Syracuse, whom Plato had recruited as one of his followers, but the tyrant himself turned against Plato. Plato almost faced death, but was sold into slavery. Anniceris, a Cyrenaic philosopher, bought Plato&#x27;s freedom for twenty minas, and sent him home. Philodemus however states that Plato was sold as a slave as early as in 404 BC, when the Spartans conquered Aegina, or, alternatively, in 399 BC, immediately after the death of Socrates. After Dionysius&#x27;s death, according to Plato&#x27;s &quot;Seventh Letter&quot;, Dion requested Plato return to Syracuse to tutor Dionysius II, who seemed to accept Plato&#x27;s teachings, but eventually became suspicious of their motives, expelling Dion and holding Plato against his will. Eventually Plato left Syracuse and Dion would return to overthrow Dionysius and rule Syracuse, before being usurped by Callippus, a fellow disciple of Plato.

A variety of sources have given accounts of Plato&#x27;s death. One story, based on a mutilated manuscript, suggests Plato died in his bed, whilst a young Thracian girl played the flute to him. Another tradition suggests Plato died at a wedding feast. The account is based on Diogenes Laërtius&#x27;s reference to an account by Hermippus, a third-century Alexandrian. According to Tertullian, Plato simply died in his sleep. According to Philodemus, Plato was buried in the garden of his academy in Athens, close to the sacred shrine of the Muses. In 2024, a scroll found at Herculaneum was deciphered, that supported some previous theories. The papyrus says that before death Plato &quot;retained enough lucidity to critique the musician for her lack of rhythm&quot;, and that he was buried &quot;in his designated garden in the Academy of Athens&quot;.

== Influences ==
=== Socrates ===

Plato never speaks in his own voice in his dialogues; every dialogue except the &quot;Laws&quot; features Socrates, although many dialogues, including the &quot;Timaeus&quot; and &quot;Statesman&quot;, feature him speaking only rarely. Leo Strauss notes that Socrates&#x27; reputation for irony casts doubt on whether Plato&#x27;s Socrates is expressing sincere beliefs. Xenophon&#x27;s &quot;Memorabilia&quot; and Aristophanes&#x27;s &quot;The Clouds&quot; seem to present a somewhat different portrait of Socrates from the one Plato paints. Aristotle attributes a different doctrine with respect to Forms to Plato and Socrates. Aristotle suggests that Socrates&#x27; idea of forms can be discovered through investigation of the natural world, unlike Plato&#x27;s Forms that exist beyond and outside the ordinary range of human understanding. The Socratic problem concerns how to reconcile these various accounts. The precise relationship between Plato and Socrates remains an area of contention among scholars.

=== Pythagoreanism ===
Although Socrates influenced Plato directly, the influence of Pythagoras, or in a broader sense, the Pythagoreans, such as Archytas, also appears to have been significant. Aristotle and Cicero both claimed that the philosophy of Plato closely followed the teachings of the Pythagoreans. According to R. M. Hare, this influence consists of three points:
# The platonic Republic might be related to the idea of &quot;a tightly organized community of like-minded thinkers&quot;, like the one established by Pythagoras in Croton.
# The idea that mathematics and, generally speaking, abstract thinking is a secure basis for philosophical thinking as well as &quot;for substantial theses in science and morals&quot;.
# They shared a &quot;mystical approach to the soul and its place in the material world&quot;.

Pythagoras held that all things are number, and the cosmos comes from numerical principles. He introduced the concept of form as distinct from matter, and that the physical world is an imitation of an eternal mathematical world. These ideas were very influential on Heraclitus, Parmenides and Plato.
=== Heraclitus and Parmenides ===
The two philosophers Heraclitus and Parmenides, influenced by earlier pre-Socratic Greek philosophers such as Pythagoras and Xenophanes, departed from mythological explanations for the universe and began the metaphysical tradition that strongly influenced Plato and continues today. Heraclitus viewed all things as continuously changing, that one cannot &quot;step into the same river twice&quot; due to the ever-changing waters flowing through it, and all things exist as a contraposition of opposites. According to Diogenes Laërtius, Plato received these ideas through Heraclitus&#x27; disciple Cratylus. Parmenides adopted an altogether contrary vision, arguing for the idea of a changeless, eternal universe and the view that change is an illusion. Plato&#x27;s most self-critical dialogue is the &quot;Parmenides&quot;, which features Parmenides and his student Zeno, which criticizes Plato&#x27;s own metaphysical theories. Plato&#x27;s &quot;Sophist&quot; dialogue includes an Eleatic stranger. These ideas about change and permanence, or becoming and Being, influenced Plato in formulating his theory of Forms.

== Philosophy ==
In Plato&#x27;s dialogues, Socrates and his company of disputants had something to say on many subjects, including several aspects of metaphysics. These include religion and science, human nature, love, and sexuality. More than one dialogue contrasts perception and reality, nature and custom, and body and soul. Francis Cornford identified the &quot;twin pillars of Platonism&quot; as the theory of Forms, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the doctrine of immortality of the soul.

=== The Forms ===

In the dialogues Socrates regularly asks for the meaning of a general term (e. g. justice, truth, beauty), and criticizes those who instead give him particular examples, rather than the quality shared by all examples. &quot;Platonism&quot; and its theory of Forms (also known as &#x27;theory of Ideas&#x27;) denies the reality of the material world, considering it only an image or copy of the real world. According to this theory of Forms, there are these two kinds of things: the apparent world of material objects grasped by the senses, which constantly changes, and an unchanging and unseen world of Forms, grasped by reason (). Plato&#x27;s Forms represent types of things, as well as properties, patterns, and relations, which are referred to as objects. Just as individual tables, chairs, and cars refer to objects in this world, &#x27;tableness&#x27;, &#x27;chairness&#x27;, and &#x27;carness&#x27;, as well as e.g. justice, truth, and beauty refer to objects in another world. One of Plato&#x27;s most cited examples for the Forms were the truths of geometry, such as the Pythagorean theorem. The theory of Forms is first introduced in the &quot;Phaedo&quot; dialogue (also known as &quot;On the Soul&quot;), wherein Socrates disputes the pluralism of Anaxagoras, then the most popular response to Heraclitus and Parmenides.

=== The Soul ===

For Plato, as was characteristic of ancient Greek philosophy, the soul was that which gave life. Plato advocates a belief in the immortality of the soul, and several dialogues end with long speeches imagining the afterlife. In the &quot;Timaeus&quot;, Socrates locates the parts of the soul within the human body: Reason is located in the head, spirit in the top third of the torso, and the appetite in the middle third of the torso, down to the navel.

Furthermore, Plato evinces a belief in the theory of reincarnation in multiple dialogues (such as the &quot;Phaedo&quot; and &quot;Timaeus&quot;). Scholars debate whether he intends the theory to be literally true, however. He uses this idea of reincarnation to introduce the concept that knowledge is a matter of recollection of things acquainted with before one is born, and not of observation or study. Keeping with the theme of admitting his own ignorance, Socrates regularly complains of his forgetfulness. In the &quot;Meno&quot;, Socrates uses a geometrical example to expound Plato&#x27;s view that knowledge in this latter sense is acquired by recollection. Socrates elicits a fact concerning a geometrical construction from a slave boy, who could not have otherwise known the fact (due to the slave boy&#x27;s lack of education). The knowledge must be of, Socrates concludes, an eternal, non-perceptible Form.

=== Epistemology ===
Plato also discusses several aspects of epistemology. In several dialogues, Socrates inverts the common man&#x27;s intuition about what is knowable and what is real. Reality is unavailable to those who use their senses. Socrates says that he who sees with his eyes is blind. While most people take the objects of their senses to be real if anything is, Socrates is contemptuous of people who think that something has to be graspable in the hands to be real. In the &quot;Theaetetus&quot;, he says such people are &quot;eu amousoi&quot; (εὖ ἄμουσοι), an expression that means literally, &quot;happily without the muses&quot;. In other words, such people are willingly ignorant, living without divine inspiration and access to higher insights about reality. Many have interpreted Plato as statingeven having been the first to writethat knowledge is justified true belief, an influential view that informed future developments in epistemology. Plato also identified problems with the &quot;justified true belief&quot; definition in the &quot;Theaetetus&quot;, concluding that justification (or an &quot;account&quot;) would require knowledge of &quot;difference&quot;, meaning that the definition of knowledge is circular.

In the &quot;Sophist&quot;, &quot;Statesman&quot;, &quot;Republic&quot;, &quot;Timaeus&quot;, and the &quot;Parmenides&quot;, Plato associates knowledge with the apprehension of unchanging Forms and their relationships to one another (which he calls &quot;expertise&quot; in dialectic), including through the processes of &quot;collection&quot; and &quot;division&quot;. More explicitly, Plato himself argues in the &quot;Timaeus&quot; that knowledge is always proportionate to the realm from which it is gained. In other words, if one derives one&#x27;s account of something experientially, because the world of sense is in flux, the views therein attained will be mere opinions. Meanwhile, opinions are characterized by a lack of necessity and stability. On the other hand, if one derives one&#x27;s account of something by way of the non-sensible Forms, because these Forms are unchanging, so too is the account derived from them. That apprehension of Forms is required for knowledge may be taken to cohere with Plato&#x27;s theory in the &quot;Theaetetus&quot; and &quot;Meno&quot;. Indeed, the apprehension of Forms may be at the base of the account required for justification, in that it offers foundational knowledge which itself needs no account, thereby avoiding an infinite regression.

=== Ethics ===

Several dialogues discuss ethics including virtue and vice, pleasure and pain, crime and punishment, and justice and medicine. Socrates presents the famous Euthyphro dilemma in the dialogue of the same name: &quot;Is the pious (τὸ ὅσιον) loved by the gods because it is pious, or is it pious because it is loved by the gods?&quot; (10a) In the &quot;Protagoras&quot; dialogue it is argued through Socrates that virtue is innate and cannot be learned, that no one does bad on purpose, and to know what is good results in doing what is good; that knowledge is virtue. In the &quot;Republic&quot;, Plato poses the question, &quot;What is justice?&quot; and by examining both individual justice and the justice that informs societies, Plato is able not only to inform metaphysics, but also ethics and politics with the question: &quot;What is the basis of moral and social obligation?&quot; Plato&#x27;s well-known answer rests upon the fundamental responsibility to seek wisdom, wisdom which leads to an understanding of the Form of the Good. Plato views &quot;The Good&quot; as the supreme Form, somehow existing even &quot;beyond being&quot;. In this manner, justice is obtained when knowledge of how to fulfill one&#x27;s moral and political function in society is put into practice.

=== Politics ===
The dialogues also discuss politics. Some of Plato&#x27;s most famous doctrines are contained in the &quot;Republic&quot; as well as in the &quot;Laws&quot; and the &quot;Statesman&quot;. Because these opinions are not spoken directly by Plato and vary between dialogues, they cannot be straightforwardly assumed as representing Plato&#x27;s own views.

Socrates asserts that societies have a tripartite class structure corresponding to the appetite/spirit/reason structure of the individual soul. The appetite/spirit/reason are analogous to the castes of society.
* &quot;Productive&quot; (Workers) – the labourers, carpenters, plumbers, masons, merchants, farmers, ranchers, etc. These correspond to the &quot;appetite&quot; part of the soul.
* &quot;Protective&quot; (Warriors or Guardians) – those who are adventurous, strong and brave; in the armed forces. These correspond to the &quot;spirit&quot; part of the soul.
* &quot;Governing&quot; (Rulers or Philosopher Kings) – those who are intelligent, rational, self-controlled, in love with wisdom, well suited to make decisions for the community. These correspond to the &quot;reason&quot; part of the soul and are very few.

According to Socrates, a state made up of different kinds of souls will, overall, decline from an aristocracy (rule by the best) to a timocracy (rule by the honourable), then to an oligarchy (rule by the few), then to a democracy (rule by the people), and finally to tyranny (rule by one person, rule by a tyrant).

=== Rhetoric and poetry ===

Several dialogues tackle questions about art, including rhetoric and rhapsody. Socrates says that poetry is inspired by the muses, and is not rational. He speaks approvingly of this, and other forms of divine madness (drunkenness, eroticism, and dreaming) in the &quot;Phaedrus&quot;, and yet in the &quot;Republic&quot; wants to outlaw Homer&#x27;s great poetry, and laughter as well. Scholars often view Plato&#x27;s philosophy as at odds with rhetoric due to his criticisms of rhetoric in the &quot;Gorgias&quot; and his ambivalence toward rhetoric expressed in the &quot;Phaedrus&quot;. But other contemporary researchers contest the idea that Plato despised rhetoric and instead view his dialogues as a dramatization of complex rhetorical principles. Plato made abundant use of mythological narratives in his own work; It is generally agreed that the main purpose for Plato in using myths was didactic. He considered that only a few people were capable or interested in following a reasoned philosophical discourse, but men in general are attracted by stories and tales. Consequently, then, he used the myth to convey the conclusions of the philosophical reasoning. Notable examples include the story of Atlantis, the Myth of Er, and the Allegory of the Cave.
=== Definition of humanity ===
When considering the taxonomic definition of mankind, Plato proposed the term &quot;featherless biped&quot;, and later (), a &quot;political&quot; or &quot;state-building&quot; animal (Aristotle&#x27;s term, based on Plato&#x27;s &quot;Statesman&quot;).

Diogenes the Cynic took issue with the former definition, reportedly producing a recently plucked chicken with the exclamation of &quot;Here is Plato’s man!&quot; (variously translated as &quot;Behold, a man!&quot;; &quot;Here is a human!&quot; etc.).

== Works ==
=== Themes ===
Plato never presents himself as a participant in any of the dialogues, and with the exception of the &quot;Apology&quot;, there is no suggestion that he heard any of the dialogues firsthand. Some dialogues have no narrator but have a pure &quot;dramatic&quot; form, some dialogues are narrated by Socrates himself, who speaks in the first person. The &quot;Symposium&quot; is narrated by Apollodorus, a Socratic disciple, apparently to Glaucon. Apollodorus assures his listener that he is recounting the story, which took place when he himself was an infant, not from his own memory, but as remembered by Aristodemus, who told him the story years ago. The &quot;Theaetetus&quot; is also a peculiar case: a dialogue in dramatic form embedded within another dialogue in dramatic form. Some scholars take this as an indication that Plato had by this date wearied of the narrated form. In most of the dialogues, the primary speaker is Socrates, who employs a method of questioning which proceeds by a dialogue form called dialectic. The role of dialectic in Plato&#x27;s thought is contested but there are two main interpretations: a type of reasoning and a method of intuition. Simon Blackburn adopts the first, saying that Plato&#x27;s dialectic is &quot;the process of eliciting the truth by means of questions aimed at opening out what is already implicitly known, or at exposing the contradictions and muddles of an opponent&#x27;s position.&quot; Karl Popper, on the other hand, claims that dialectic is the art of intuition for &quot;visualising the divine originals, the Forms or Ideas, of unveiling the Great Mystery behind the common man&#x27;s everyday world of appearances&quot;. Other researchers also emphasise that Plato&#x27;s philosophy has a strong religious component, e. g. in that philosophising is seen as a means of ascending to a higher level of consciousness.

=== Textual sources and history ===
During the early Renaissance, the Greek language and, along with it, Plato&#x27;s texts were reintroduced to Western Europe by Byzantine scholars. Some 250 known manuscripts of Plato survive. In September or October 1484 Filippo Valori and Francesco Berlinghieri printed 1025 copies of Ficino&#x27;s translation, using at the Dominican convent of . The 1578 edition of Plato&#x27;s complete works published by Henricus Stephanus (Henri Estienne) in Geneva also included parallel Latin translation and running commentary by Joannes Serranus (Jean de Serres). It was this edition which established standard Stephanus pagination, still in use today. The text of Plato as received today apparently represents the complete written philosophical work of Plato, based on the first century AD arrangement of Thrasyllus of Mendes. The modern standard complete English edition is the 1997 Hackett &quot;Plato: Complete Works&quot;, edited by John M. Cooper.

=== Authenticity ===

Thirty-five dialogues and thirteen letters (the &quot;Epistles&quot;) have traditionally been ascribed to Plato, though modern scholarship doubts the authenticity of at least some of these. Jowett mentions in his Appendix to Menexenus, that works which bore the character of a writer were attributed to that writer even when the actual author was unknown.
The works taken as genuine in antiquity but are now doubted by at least some modern scholars are: &quot;Alcibiades I&quot; (*), &quot;Alcibiades II&quot; (‡), &quot;Clitophon&quot; (*), &quot;Epinomis&quot; (‡), &quot;Letters&quot; (*), &quot;Hipparchus&quot; (‡), &quot;Menexenus&quot; (*), &quot;Minos&quot; (‡), &quot;Lovers&quot; (‡), &quot;Theages&quot; (‡)
The following works were transmitted under Plato&#x27;s name in antiquity, but were already considered spurious by the 1st century AD: &quot;Axiochus&quot;, &quot;Definitions&quot;, &quot;Demodocus&quot;, &quot;Epigrams&quot;, &quot;Eryxias&quot;, &quot;Halcyon&quot;, &quot;On Justice&quot;, &quot;On Virtue&quot;, &quot;Sisyphus&quot;.

=== Chronology ===
No one knows the exact order Plato&#x27;s dialogues were written in, nor the extent to which some might have been later revised and rewritten. The works are usually grouped into &quot;Early&quot;, &quot;Middle&quot;, and &quot;Late&quot; period; The following represents one relatively common division amongst developmentalist scholars.
* Early: &quot;Apology&quot;, &quot;Charmides&quot;, &quot;Crito&quot;, &quot;Euthyphro&quot;, &quot;Gorgias&quot;, &quot;Hippias Minor&quot;, &quot;Hippias Major&quot;, &quot;Ion&quot;, &quot;Laches&quot;, &quot;Lysis&quot;, &quot;Protagoras&quot;
* Middle: &quot;Cratylus&quot;, &quot;Euthydemus&quot;, &quot;Meno&quot;, &quot;Parmenides&quot;, &quot;Phaedo&quot;, &quot;Phaedrus&quot;, &quot;Republic&quot;, &quot;Symposium&quot;, &quot;Theatetus&quot;
* Late: &quot;Critias&quot;, &quot;Sophist&quot;, &quot;Statesman&quot;, &quot;Timaeus&quot;, &quot;Philebus&quot;, &quot;Laws.&quot;

Brickhouse and Smith incorporate &quot;early-transitional&quot; and &quot;later-transitional&quot; phases between these divisions.

Whereas those classified as &quot;early dialogues&quot; often conclude in aporia, the so-called &quot;middle dialogues&quot; provide more clearly stated positive teachings that are often ascribed to Plato such as the theory of Forms. The remaining dialogues are classified as &quot;late&quot; and are generally agreed to be difficult and challenging pieces of philosophy. It should, however, be kept in mind that many of the positions in the ordering are still highly disputed, and also that the very notion that Plato&#x27;s dialogues can or should be &quot;ordered&quot; is by no means universally accepted, though Plato&#x27;s works are still often characterized as falling at least roughly into three groups stylistically.

== Legacy ==
=== Unwritten doctrines ===

Plato&#x27;s unwritten doctrines are, according to some ancient sources, the most fundamental metaphysical teaching of Plato, which he disclosed only orally, and some say only to his most trusted fellows, and which he may have kept secret from the public, although many modern scholars doubt these claims. A reason for not revealing it to everyone is partially discussed in &quot;Phaedrus&quot; where Plato criticizes the written transmission of knowledge as faulty, favouring instead the spoken &quot;logos&quot;: &quot;he who has knowledge of the just and the good and beautiful ... will not, when in earnest, write them in ink, sowing them through a pen with words, which cannot defend themselves by argument and cannot teach the truth effectually.&quot; It is, however, said that Plato once disclosed this knowledge to the public in his lecture &quot;On the Good&quot; (), in which the Good () is identified with the One (the Unity, ), the fundamental ontological principle.

The first witness who mentions its existence is Aristotle, who in his &quot;Physics&quot; writes: &quot;It is true, indeed, that the account he gives there [i.e. in &quot;Timaeus&quot;] of the participant is different from what he says in his so-called &quot;unwritten teachings&quot; ().&quot; In &quot;Metaphysics&quot; he writes: &quot;Now since the Forms are the causes of everything else, he [i.e. Plato] supposed that their elements are the elements of all things. Accordingly, the material principle is the Great and Small [i.e. the Dyad], and the essence is the One (), since the numbers are derived from the Great and Small by participation in the One&quot;. &quot;From this account it is clear that he only employed two causes: that of the essence, and the material cause; for the Forms are the cause of the essence in everything else, and the One is the cause of it in the Forms. He also tells us what the material substrate is of which the Forms are predicated in the case of sensible things, and the One in that of the Formsthat it is this the duality (the Dyad, ), the Great and Small (). Further, he assigned to these two elements respectively the causation of good and of evil&quot;.

The most important aspect of this interpretation of Plato&#x27;s metaphysics is the continuity between his teaching and the Neoplatonic interpretation of Plotinus or Ficino which has been considered erroneous by many but may in fact have been directly influenced by oral transmission of Plato&#x27;s doctrine. A modern scholar who recognized the importance of the unwritten doctrine of Plato was Heinrich Gomperz who described it in his speech during the 7th International Congress of Philosophy in 1930. All the sources related to the have been collected by Konrad Gaiser and published as &quot;Testimonia Platonica&quot;.

=== Reception ===

Plato&#x27;s thought is often compared with that of his most famous student, Aristotle, whose reputation during the Western Middle Ages so completely eclipsed that of Plato that the Scholastic philosophers referred to Aristotle as &quot;the Philosopher&quot;. The only Platonic work known to western scholarship was &quot;Timaeus&quot;, until translations were made after the fall of Constantinople, which occurred during 1453. However, the study of Plato continued in the Byzantine Empire, the Caliphates during the Islamic Golden Age, and Spain during the Golden age of Jewish culture. Plato is also referenced by Jewish philosopher and Talmudic scholar Maimonides in his &quot;Guide for the Perplexed&quot;.

The works of Plato were again revived at the times of Islamic Golden ages with other Greek contents through their translation from Greek to Arabic. Neoplatonism was revived from its founding father, Plotinus. Neoplatonism, a philosophical current that permeated Islamic scholarship, accentuated one facet of the Qur’anic conception of God—the transcendent—while seemingly neglecting another—the creative. This philosophical tradition, introduced by Al-Farabi and subsequently elaborated upon by figures such as Avicenna, postulated that all phenomena emanated from the divine source. It functioned as a conduit, bridging the transcendental nature of the divine with the tangible reality of creation. In the Islamic context, Neoplatonism facilitated the integration of Platonic philosophy with mystical Islamic thought, fostering a synthesis of ancient philosophical wisdom and religious insight. Inspired by Plato&#x27;s Republic, Al-Farabi extended his inquiry beyond mere political theory, proposing an ideal city governed by philosopher-kings.

Many of these commentaries on Plato were translated from Arabic into Latin and as such influenced Medieval scholastic philosophers. 

During the Renaissance, George Gemistos Plethon brought Plato&#x27;s original writings to Florence from Constantinople in the century of its fall. Many of the greatest early modern scientists and artists who broke with Scholasticism, with the support of the Plato-inspired Lorenzo (grandson of Cosimo), saw Plato&#x27;s philosophy as the basis for progress in the arts and sciences. The 17th century Cambridge Platonists sought to reconcile Plato&#x27;s more problematic beliefs, such as metempsychosis and polyamory, with Christianity. By the 19th century, Plato&#x27;s reputation was restored, and at least on par with Aristotle&#x27;s. Plato&#x27;s influence has been especially strong in mathematics and the sciences. Plato&#x27;s resurgence further inspired some of the greatest advances in logic since Aristotle, primarily through Gottlob Frege. Albert Einstein suggested that the scientist who takes philosophy seriously would have to avoid systematization and take on many different roles, and possibly appear as a Platonist or Pythagorean, in that such a one would have &quot;the viewpoint of logical simplicity as an indispensable and effective tool of his research.&quot; British philosopher Alfred N. Whitehead is often misquoted of uttering the famous saying of &quot;All of Western philosophy is a footnote to Plato.&quot;

==== Criticism ====
Many recent philosophers have also diverged from what some would describe as ideals characteristic of traditional Platonism. Friedrich Nietzsche notoriously attacked Plato&#x27;s &quot;idea of the good itself&quot; along with many fundamentals of Christian morality, which he interpreted as &quot;Platonism for the masses&quot; in &quot;Beyond Good and Evil&quot; (1886). Martin Heidegger argued against Plato&#x27;s alleged obfuscation of &quot;Being&quot; in his incomplete tome, &quot;Being and Time&quot; (1927). Karl Popper argued in the first volume of &quot;The Open Society and Its Enemies&quot; (1945) that Plato&#x27;s proposal for a &quot;utopian&quot; political regime in the &quot;Republic&quot; was prototypically totalitarian; this has been disputed. Edmund Gettier famously demonstrated the Gettier problem for the justified true belief account of knowledge. That the modern theory of justified true belief as knowledge, which Gettier addresses, is equivalent to Plato&#x27;s is, however, accepted only by some scholars but rejected by others.

<text>In probability theory, the sample space (also called sample description space, possibility space, or outcome space) of an experiment or random trial is the set of all possible outcomes or results of that experiment. A sample space is usually denoted using set notation, and the possible ordered outcomes, or sample points, are listed as elements in the set. It is common to refer to a sample space by the labels &quot;S&quot;, Ω, or &quot;U&quot; (for &quot;universal set&quot;). The elements of a sample space may be numbers, words, letters, or symbols. They can also be finite, countably infinite, or uncountably infinite.

A subset of the sample space is an event, denoted by formula_1. If the outcome of an experiment is included in formula_1, then event formula_1 has occurred.

For example, if the experiment is tossing a single coin, the sample space is the set formula_4, where the outcome formula_5 means that the coin is heads and the outcome formula_6 means that the coin is tails. The possible events are formula_7, formula_8, formula_9, and formula_10. For tossing two coins, the sample space is formula_11, where the outcome is formula_12 if both coins are heads, formula_13 if the first coin is heads and the second is tails, formula_14 if the first coin is tails and the second is heads, and formula_15 if both coins are tails. The event that at least one of the coins is heads is given by formula_16.

For tossing a single six-sided die one time, where the result of interest is the number of pips facing up, the sample space is formula_17.

A well-defined, non-empty sample space formula_18 is one of three components in a probabilistic model (a probability space). The other two basic elements are a well-defined set of possible events (an event space), which is typically the power set of formula_18 if formula_18 is discrete or a σ-algebra on formula_18 if it is continuous, and a probability assigned to each event (a probability measure function).

A sample space can be represented visually by a rectangle, with the outcomes of the sample space denoted by points within the rectangle. The events may be represented by ovals, where the points enclosed within the oval make up the event.

== Conditions of a sample space ==
A set formula_22 with outcomes formula_23 (i.e. formula_24) must meet some conditions in order to be a sample space:
* The outcomes must be mutually exclusive, i.e. if formula_25 occurs, then no other formula_26 will take place, formula_27.
* The outcomes must be collectively exhaustive, i.e. on every experiment (or random trial) there will always take place some outcome formula_28 for formula_29.
* The sample space (formula_22) must have the right granularity depending on what the experimenter is interested in. Irrelevant information must be removed from the sample space and the right abstraction must be chosen.

For instance, in the trial of tossing a coin, one possible sample space is formula_31, where formula_5 is the outcome where the coin lands heads and formula_6 is for tails. Another possible sample space could be formula_34. Here, formula_35 denotes a rainy day and formula_36 is a day where it is not raining. For most experiments, formula_37 would be a better choice than formula_38, as an experimenter likely does not care about how the weather affects the coin toss.

== Multiple sample spaces ==
For many experiments, there may be more than one plausible sample space available, depending on what result is of interest to the experimenter. For example, when drawing a card from a standard deck of fifty-two playing cards, one possibility for the sample space could be the various ranks (Ace through King), while another could be the suits (clubs, diamonds, hearts, or spades). A more complete description of outcomes, however, could specify both the denomination and the suit, and a sample space describing each individual card can be constructed as the Cartesian product of the two sample spaces noted above (this space would contain fifty-two equally likely outcomes). Still other sample spaces are possible, such as right-side up or upside down, if some cards have been flipped when shuffling.

== Equally likely outcomes ==


Some treatments of probability assume that the various outcomes of an experiment are always defined so as to be equally likely. For any sample space with formula_39 equally likely outcomes, each outcome is assigned the probability formula_40. However, there are experiments that are not easily described by a sample space of equally likely outcomes—for example, if one were to toss a thumb tack many times and observe whether it landed with its point upward or downward, there is no physical symmetry to suggest that the two outcomes should be equally likely.

Though most random phenomena do not have equally likely outcomes, it can be helpful to define a sample space in such a way that outcomes are at least approximately equally likely, since this condition significantly simplifies the computation of probabilities for events within the sample space. If each individual outcome occurs with the same probability, then the probability of any event becomes simply:
: formula_41

For example, if two fair six-sided dice are thrown to generate two uniformly distributed integers, formula_42 and formula_43, each in the range from 1 to 6, inclusive, the 36 possible ordered pairs of outcomes formula_44 constitute a sample space of equally likely events. In this case, the above formula applies, such as calculating the probability of a particular sum of the two rolls in an outcome. The probability of the event that the sum formula_45 is five is formula_46, since four of the thirty-six equally likely pairs of outcomes sum to five.

If the sample space was all of the possible sums obtained from rolling two six-sided dice, the above formula can still be applied because the dice rolls are fair, but the number of outcomes in a given event will vary. A sum of two can occur with the outcome formula_47, so the probability is formula_48. For a sum of seven, the outcomes in the event are formula_49, so the probability is formula_50.

=== Simple random sample ===
In statistics, inferences are made about characteristics of a population by studying a sample of that population&#x27;s individuals. In order to arrive at a sample that presents an unbiased estimate of the true characteristics of the population, statisticians often seek to study a simple random sample—that is, a sample in which every individual in the population is equally likely to be included. The result of this is that every possible combination of individuals who could be chosen for the sample has an equal chance to be the sample that is selected (that is, the space of simple random samples of a given size from a given population is composed of equally likely outcomes).

==Infinitely large sample spaces==
In an elementary approach to probability, any subset of the sample space is usually called an event. However, this gives rise to problems when the sample space is continuous, so that a more precise definition of an event is necessary. Under this definition only measurable subsets of the sample space, constituting a σ-algebra over the sample space itself, are considered events.

An example of an infinitely large sample space is measuring the lifetime of a light bulb. The corresponding sample space would be .

<text>In probability theory, an elementary event, also called an atomic event or sample point, is an event which contains only a single outcome in the sample space. Using set theory terminology, an elementary event is a singleton. Elementary events and their corresponding outcomes are often written interchangeably for simplicity, as such an event corresponding to precisely one outcome.

The following are examples of elementary events:
* All sets formula_1 where formula_2 if objects are being counted and the sample space is formula_3 (the natural numbers).
* formula_4 if a coin is tossed twice. formula_5 where formula_6 stands for heads and formula_7 for tails.
* All sets formula_8 where formula_9 is a real number. Here formula_10 is a random variable with a normal distribution and formula_11 This example shows that, because the probability of each elementary event is zero, the probabilities assigned to elementary events do not determine a continuous probability distribution..

==Probability of an elementary event==

Elementary events may occur with probabilities that are between zero and one (inclusively). In a discrete probability distribution whose sample space is finite, each elementary event is assigned a particular probability. In contrast, in a continuous distribution, individual elementary events must all have a probability of zero.

Some &quot;mixed&quot; distributions contain both stretches of continuous elementary events and some discrete elementary events; the discrete elementary events in such distributions can be called atoms or atomic events and can have non-zero probabilities.

Under the measure-theoretic definition of a probability space, the probability of an elementary event need not even be defined. In particular, the set of events on which probability is defined may be some σ-algebra on formula_12 and not necessarily the full power set.

<text>In probability theory, an event is a subset of outcomes of an experiment (a subset of the sample space) to which a probability is assigned. A single outcome may be an element of many different events, and different events in an experiment are usually not equally likely, since they may include very different groups of outcomes. An event consisting of only a single outcome is called an or an ; that is, it is a singleton set. An event that has more than one possible outcome is called a compound event. An event formula_1 is said to if formula_1 contains the outcome formula_3 of the experiment (or trial) (that is, if formula_4). The probability (with respect to some probability measure) that an event formula_1 occurs is the probability that formula_1 contains the outcome formula_3 of an experiment (that is, it is the probability that formula_4). 
An event defines a complementary event, namely the complementary set (the event occurring), and together these define a Bernoulli trial: did the event occur or not?

Typically, when the sample space is finite, any subset of the sample space is an event (that is, all elements of the power set of the sample space are defined as events). However, this approach does not work well in cases where the sample space is uncountably infinite. So, when defining a probability space it is possible, and often necessary, to exclude certain subsets of the sample space from being events (see , below).

==A simple example==

If we assemble a deck of 52 playing cards with no jokers, and draw a single card from the deck, then the sample space is a 52-element set, as each card is a possible outcome. An event, however, is any subset of the sample space, including any singleton set (an elementary event), the empty set (an impossible event, with probability zero) and the sample space itself (a certain event, with probability one). Other events are proper subsets of the sample space that contain multiple elements. So, for example, potential events include: 
* &quot;Red and black at the same time without being a joker&quot; (0 elements),
* &quot;The 5 of Hearts&quot; (1 element),
* &quot;A King&quot; (4 elements),
* &quot;A Face card&quot; (12 elements),
* &quot;A Spade&quot; (13 elements),
* &quot;A Face card or a red suit&quot; (32 elements),
* &quot;A card&quot; (52 elements).
Since all events are sets, they are usually written as sets (for example, {1, 2, 3}), and represented graphically using Venn diagrams. In the situation where each outcome in the sample space Ω is equally likely, the probability formula_9 of an event formula_10 is the following :
formula_11
This rule can readily be applied to each of the example events above.

==Events in probability spaces==

Defining all subsets of the sample space as events works well when there are only finitely many outcomes, but gives rise to problems when the sample space is infinite. For many standard probability distributions, such as the normal distribution, the sample space is the set of real numbers or some subset of the real numbers. Attempts to define probabilities for all subsets of the real numbers run into difficulties when one considers &#x27;badly behaved&#x27; sets, such as those that are nonmeasurable. Hence, it is necessary to restrict attention to a more limited family of subsets. For the standard tools of probability theory, such as joint and conditional probabilities, to work, it is necessary to use a σ-algebra, that is, a family closed under complementation and countable unions of its members. The most natural choice of σ-algebra is the Borel measurable set derived from unions and intersections of intervals. However, the larger class of Lebesgue measurable sets proves more useful in practice.

In the general measure-theoretic description of probability spaces, an event may be defined as an element of a selected -algebra of subsets of the sample space. Under this definition, any subset of the sample space that is not an element of the -algebra is not an event, and does not have a probability. With a reasonable specification of the probability space, however, all are elements of the -algebra.

==A note on notation==

Even though events are subsets of some sample space formula_12 they are often written as predicates or indicators involving random variables. For example, if formula_13 is a real-valued random variable defined on the sample space formula_12 the event
formula_15
can be written more conveniently as, simply,
formula_16
This is especially common in formulas for a probability, such as
formula_17
The set formula_18 is an example of an inverse image under the mapping formula_13 because formula_20 if and only if formula_21

<doc id="22973" wikidata="Q751065" url="?curid=22973" title="Pig Latin">
<text>Pig Latin (&quot;Igpay Atinlay&quot;) is a language game, argot, or cant in which words in English are altered, usually by adding a fabricated suffix or by moving the onset or initial consonant or consonant cluster of a word to the end of the word and adding a vocalic syllable (usually -ay or /eɪ/) to create such a suffix. For example, &quot;Wikipedia&quot; would become &quot;Ikipediaway&quot; (taking the &#x27;W&#x27; and &#x27;ay&#x27; to create a suffix). 

The objective is often to conceal the words from others not familiar with the rules. The reference to Latin is a deliberate misnomer; Pig Latin is simply a form of argot or jargon unrelated to Latin, and the name is used for its English connotations as a strange and foreign-sounding language. It is most often used by young children as a fun way to confuse people unfamiliar with Pig Latin.

==Origins and history==
Early mentions of Pig Latin or Hog Latin describe what is now known today as Dog Latin, a type of parody Latin. Examples of this predate even Shakespeare, whose 1598 play, &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot;, includes a reference to dog Latin:

An 1866 article describes a &quot;hog latin&quot; that has some similarities to current Pig Latin. The article says, &quot;He adds as many new letters as the boys in their &#x27;hog latin&#x27;, which is made use of to mystify eavesdroppers. A boy asking a friend to go with him says, &#x27;Wig-ge you-ge go-ge wig-ge me-ge?&#x27; The other, replying in the negative says, &#x27;Noge, Ige woge.&#x27; &quot;. This is similar to Língua do Pê.

Another early mention of the name was in &quot;Putnam&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in May 1869: &quot;I had plenty of ammunition in reserve, to say nothing, Tom, of our pig Latin. &#x27;Hoggibus, piggibus et shotam damnabile grunto&#x27;, and all that sort of thing&quot;, although the jargon is Dog Latin.

&quot;The Atlantic&quot; January 1895 also included a mention of the subject: &quot;They all spoke a queer jargon which they themselves had invented. It was something like the well-known &#x27;pig Latin&#x27; that all sorts of children like to play with.&quot;

The modern version of Pig Latin appears in a 1919 Columbia Records album containing what sounds like the modern variation, by a singer named Arthur Fields. The song, called &quot;Pig Latin Love&quot;, is followed by the subtitle &quot;I-Yay Ove-Lay oo-yay earie-day&quot;. The Three Stooges used it on multiple occasions, most notably &quot;Tassels in the Air&quot;, a 1938 short where Moe Howard attempts to teach Curley Howard how to use it, thereby conveying the rules to the audience. In an earlier (1934) episode, &quot;Three Little Pigskins&quot;, Larry Fine attempts to impress a woman with his skill in Pig Latin, but it turns out that she knows it, too. No explanation of the rules is given. A few months prior in 1934, in the &quot;Our Gang&quot; short film &quot;Washee Ironee&quot;, Spanky tries to speak to an Asian boy by using Pig Latin. 

Ginger Rogers sang a verse of &quot;We&#x27;re in the Money&quot; in pig Latin in an elaborate Busby Berkeley production number in the film &quot;Gold Diggers of 1933&quot;. The film, the third highest grossing of that year, was inducted into the National Film Registry and that song included in the all-time top 100 movie songs by the American Film Institute. Merle Travis ends his song &quot;When My Baby Double Talks To Me&quot; with the phrase, &quot;What a aybybay&quot;, where the last word is Pig Latin for &quot;baby&quot;.

A 1947 newspaper question and answer column describes the Pig Latin as known today. It describes moving the first letter to the end of a word and then adding &quot;ay&quot;.

Two Pig Latin words that have entered mainstream American English are &quot;&quot; or &quot;icksnay&quot;, the Pig Latin version of &quot;&quot; (itself a borrowing of German &quot;nichts&quot;), which is used as a general negative; and &quot;, Pig Latin for &quot;, meaning &quot;go away&quot; or &quot;get out of here&quot;.

==Rules==
For words that begin with consonant sounds, these are also known as consonant blends (two letters that make one sound: e.g., black, slack, clown). The initial consonant blend (or two letters) is moved to the end of the word, then &quot;ay&quot; is added, as in the following examples:
*&quot;pig&quot; = &quot;igpay&quot;
*&quot;latin&quot; = &quot;atinlay&quot;
*&quot;banana&quot; = &quot;ananabay&quot;
*&quot;black&quot; = &quot;ackblay&quot;
*&quot;slack&quot; = &quot;ackslay&quot;
*&quot;clown&quot; = &quot;ownclay&quot;

When words begin with consonant clusters (multiple consonants that form one sound), the whole sound is moved to the end (before adding &quot;ay&quot;) when speaking or writing.
*&quot;friends&quot; = &quot;iendsfray&quot;
*&quot;smile&quot; = &quot;ilesmay&quot;
*&quot;string&quot; = &quot;ingstray&quot;

For words that begin with vowel sounds, &quot;hay&quot;, &quot;way&quot;, &quot;nay&quot;, or &quot;yay&quot; is added to the end.
Examples are:
*&quot;eat&quot; = &quot;eatway&quot;
*&quot;omelet&quot; = &quot;omeletway&quot;
*&quot;are&quot; = &quot;areway&quot;

For ease of speaking Pig Latin, it can be chosen to not change the way words sound if they begin with a vowel. They would be pronounced the way they normally would. Adding an &quot;ay&quot; at the end of every single word is not necessary. 

An alternative convention for words beginning with vowel sounds, the initial vowel(s) are moved along with the first consonant or consonant cluster. This usually works only for words with more than one syllable and offers a more unique variant of the words in keeping with the mysterious, unrecognizable sounds of the converted words. Examples are:
*&quot;every&quot; = &quot;eryevay&quot;
*&quot;omelet&quot; = &quot;eletomay&quot;
*&quot;another&quot; = &quot;otheranay&quot;

Sentence structure remains the same as it would in English. Pronunciation of some words may be a little difficult for beginners, but people can easily understand Pig Latin with practice.

==Current usage==
Pig Latin is mainly used for fun. It can also be used to hide conversation. For example, a conversation between two people in the presence of an unwanted other may consist of: &quot;ehay isway eryvay illysay&quot; = &quot;he is very silly&quot;.

==In other languages==

In the German-speaking area, varieties of Pig Latin include , which originated around Hamburg harbour, and Mattenenglisch that was used in the &quot;Matte&quot;, the traditional working-class neighborhood of Bern. Though Mattenenglisch has fallen out of use since the mid-20th century, it is still cultivated by voluntary associations. A characteristic of the Mattenenglisch Pig Latin is the complete substitution of the first vowel by &quot;i&quot;, in addition to the usual moving of the initial consonant cluster and the adding of &quot;ee&quot;.

The Swedish equivalent of Pig Latin is Fikonspråket (&quot;Fig language&quot; – see Language game § List of common language games).

The Finnish Pig Latin is known as Kontinkieli (&quot;container language&quot;). After each word, the word kontti &quot;container&quot; is added, the first syllables are switched, so every sentence is converted to twice as many pseudo-words. For example, &quot;wikipedia&quot; ⟶ &quot;wikipedia kontti&quot; ⟶ &quot;kokipedia wintti&quot;. Converting the sentence &quot;I love you&quot; (&quot;Minä rakastan sinua&quot;) would result in &quot;konä mintti kokastan rantti konua sintti&quot;.

In Italian, the &quot;alfabeto farfallino&quot; uses a similar encoding; in Spanish, a similar language variation is called Jeringonza. Spanish as used in Latin America has a further form, Vesre, in which the order of syllables is reversed.

In Estonian, the encoding used is &#x27;bi&#x27; after the first syllable, e.g. &quot;mina&quot; (&#x27;me&#x27; in English) would be &quot;mibina&quot;.

Another equivalent of Pig Latin is used throughout the Slavic-speaking parts of the Balkans. It is called &quot;Šatra&quot; (/sha-tra/)or &quot;Šatrovački&quot; (/shatro-vachki/) and was used in crime-related and street language. For instance, the Balkan slang name for marijuana (trava – meaning &quot;grass&quot;) turns to &quot;vutra&quot;; the Balkan slang name for cocaine (belo – meaning &quot;white&quot;) turns to lobe, a pistol (pištolj) turns to štoljpi, bro (brate) turns to tebra. In the past few years it has become widely used between teenage immigrants in former Yugoslavian countries.

French has the &quot;loucherbem&quot; (or &quot;louchébem&quot;, or &quot;largonji&quot;) coded language, which supposedly was originally used by butchers (&quot;boucher&quot; in French). In &quot;loucherbem&quot;, the leading consonant cluster is moved to the end of the word (as in Pig Latin) and replaced by an &quot;L&quot;, and then a suffix is added at the end of the word (-&quot;oche&quot;, -&quot;em&quot;, -&quot;oque&quot;, etc., depending on the word). Example: &quot;combien&quot; (how much) = &quot;lombienquès&quot;. Similar coded languages are &quot;verlan&quot; and &quot;langue de feu&quot; (see :fr:Javanais (argot). A few louchébem words have become usual French words: &quot;fou&quot; (crazy) = &quot;loufoque&quot; or &quot;louftingue&quot;, &quot;portefeuille&quot; (wallet) = &quot;larfeuille&quot;, &quot;en douce&quot; (on the quiet) = &quot;en loucedé&quot;.

Similarly, the French argot &quot;verlan&quot;, in which the order of the syllables within a word is inverted, is also widely used. The term &quot;verlan&quot; is an autological example of the process it describes, derived from inverting the syllables of &quot;l&#x27;envers,&quot; meaning &quot;reverse&quot;. Documented initially in the 19th century, Verlan was used as a coded language by criminals in effort to conceal illicit activities from others, including police. Over time, particularly in the late 20th century, its use has proliferated in suburban areas predominantly inhabited by migrant workers. Verlan has served as a language bridge between many of these diverse communities, and its popularity encouraged its spread into advertising, film scripts, French rap and hip-hop music, media, and some French dictionaries. In some cases, Verlanned words have even supplanted their original forms.

Here are some French words that have been Verlanned and their English meaning:

<text>Polish (, , or simply , ) is a West Slavic language of the Lechitic group within the Indo-European language family written in the Latin script. It is primarily spoken in Poland and serves as the official language of the country, as well as the language of the Polish diaspora around the world. In 2024, there were over 39.7 million Polish native speakers. It ranks as the sixth most-spoken among languages of the European Union. Polish is subdivided into regional dialects and maintains strict T–V distinction pronouns, honorifics, and various forms of formalities when addressing individuals.

The traditional 32-letter Polish alphabet has nine additions (, , , , , , , , ) to the letters of the basic 26-letter Latin alphabet, while removing three (x, q, v). Those three letters are at times included in an extended 35-letter alphabet. The traditional set comprises 23 consonants and 9 written vowels, including two nasal vowels (, ) defined by a reversed diacritic hook called an . Polish is a synthetic and fusional language which has seven grammatical cases. It has fixed penultimate stress and an abundance of palatal consonants. Contemporary Polish developed in the 1700s as the successor to the medieval Old Polish (10th–16th centuries) and Middle Polish (16th–18th centuries). 

Among the major languages, it is most closely related to Slovak and Czech but differs in terms of pronunciation and general grammar. Additionally, Polish was profoundly influenced by Latin and other Romance languages like Italian and French as well as Germanic languages (most notably German), which contributed to a large number of loanwords and similar grammatical structures. Extensive usage of nonstandard dialects has also shaped the standard language; considerable colloquialisms and expressions were directly borrowed from German or Yiddish and subsequently adopted into the vernacular of Polish which is in everyday use.

Historically, Polish was a &quot;lingua franca&quot;, important both diplomatically and academically in Central and part of Eastern Europe. In addition to being the official language of Poland, Polish is also spoken as a second language in eastern Germany, northern Czech Republic and Slovakia, western parts of Belarus and Ukraine as well as in southeast Lithuania and Latvia. Because of the emigration from Poland during different time periods, most notably after World War II, millions of Polish speakers can also be found in countries such as Canada, Argentina, Brazil, Israel, Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States.

==History==

Polish began to emerge as a distinct language around the 10th century, the process largely triggered by the establishment and development of the Polish state. At the time, it was a collection of dialect groups with some mutual features, but much regional variation was present. Mieszko I, ruler of the Polans tribe from the Greater Poland region, united a few culturally and linguistically related tribes from the basins of the Vistula and Oder before eventually accepting baptism in 966. With Western Christianity, Poland also adopted the Latin alphabet, which made it possible to write down Polish, which until then had existed only as a spoken language. The closest relatives of Polish are the Elbe and Baltic Sea Lechitic dialects (Polabian and Pomeranian varieties). All of them, except Kashubian, are extinct. The precursor to modern Polish is the Old Polish language. Ultimately, Polish descends from the unattested Proto-Slavic language.

The Book of Henryków (Polish: , ), contains the earliest known sentence written in the Polish language: &quot;Day, ut ia pobrusa, a ti poziwai&quot; (in modern orthography: &quot;Daj, uć ja pobrusza, a ti pocziwaj&quot;; the corresponding sentence in modern Polish: &quot;Daj, niech ja pomielę, a ty odpoczywaj&quot; or &quot;Pozwól, że ja będę mełł, a ty odpocznij&quot;; and in English: &quot;Come, let me grind, and you take a rest&quot;), written around 1280. The book is exhibited in the Archdiocesal Museum in Wrocław, and as of 2015 has been added to UNESCO&#x27;s &quot;Memory of the World&quot; list. 

The medieval recorder of this phrase, the Cistercian monk Peter of the Henryków monastery, noted that &quot;Hoc est in polonico&quot; (&quot;This is in Polish&quot;).

The earliest treatise on Polish orthography was written by around 1470. The first printed book in Polish appeared in either 1508 or 1513, while the oldest Polish newspaper was established in 1661. Starting in the 1520s, large numbers of books in the Polish language were published, contributing to increased homogeneity of grammar and orthography. The writing system achieved its overall form in the 16th century, which is also regarded as the &quot;Golden Age of Polish literature&quot;. The orthography was modified in the 19th century and in 1936.

Tomasz Kamusella notes that &quot;Polish is the oldest, non-ecclesiastical, written Slavic language with a continuous tradition of literacy and official use, which has lasted unbroken from the 16th century to this day.&quot; Polish evolved into the main sociolect of the nobles in Poland–Lithuania in the 15th century. The history of Polish as a language of state governance begins in the 16th century in the Kingdom of Poland. Over the later centuries, Polish served as the official language in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Congress Poland, the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, and as the administrative language in the Russian Empire&#x27;s Western Krai. The growth of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth&#x27;s influence gave Polish the status of &quot;lingua franca&quot; in Central and Eastern Europe.

The process of standardization began in the 14th century and solidified in the 16th century during the Middle Polish era. Standard Polish was based on various dialectal features, with the Greater Poland dialect group serving as the base. After World War II, Standard Polish became the most widely spoken variant of Polish across the country, and most dialects stopped being the form of Polish spoken in villages.

==Geographic distribution==

Poland is one of the most linguistically European countries; nearly 97% of Poland&#x27;s citizens declare Polish as their first language. Elsewhere, Poles constitute large minorities in areas which were once administered or occupied by Poland, notably in neighboring Lithuania, Belarus, and Ukraine. Polish is the most widely-used minority language in Lithuania&#x27;s Vilnius County, by 26% of the population, according to the 2001 census results, as Vilnius was part of Poland from 1922 until 1939. Polish is found elsewhere in southeastern Lithuania. In Ukraine, it is most common in the western parts of Lviv and Volyn Oblasts, while in West Belarus it is used by the significant Polish minority, especially in the Brest and Grodno regions and in areas along the Lithuanian border. There are significant numbers of Polish speakers among Polish emigrants and their descendants in many other countries.

In the United States, Polish Americans number more than 11 million but most of them cannot speak Polish fluently. According to the 2000 United States Census, 667,414 Americans of age five years and over reported Polish as the language spoken at home, which is about 1.4% of people who speak languages other than English, 0.25% of the US population, and 6% of the Polish-American population. The largest concentrations of Polish speakers reported in the census (over 50%) were found in three states: Illinois (185,749), (111,740), and New Jersey (74,663). Enough people in these areas speak Polish that PNC Financial Services (which has a large number of branches in all of these areas) offers services available in Polish at all of their cash machines in addition to English and Spanish.

According to the 2011 census there are now over 500,000 people in England and Wales who consider Polish to be their &quot;main&quot; language. In Canada, there is a significant Polish Canadian population: There are 242,885 speakers of Polish according to the 2006 census, with a particular concentration in Toronto (91,810 speakers) and Montreal.

The geographical distribution of the Polish language was greatly affected by the territorial changes of Poland immediately after World War II and Polish population transfers (1944–46). Poles settled in the &quot;Recovered Territories&quot; in the west and north, which had previously been mostly German-speaking. Some Poles remained in the previously Polish-ruled territories in the east that were annexed by the USSR, resulting in the present-day Polish-speaking communities in Lithuania, Belarus, and Ukraine, although many Poles were expelled from those areas to areas within Poland&#x27;s new borders. To the east of Poland, the most significant Polish minority lives in a long strip along either side of the Lithuania-Belarus border. Meanwhile, the flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–50), as well as the expulsion of Ukrainians and Operation Vistula, the 1947 migration of Ukrainian minorities in the Recovered Territories in the west of the country, contributed to the country&#x27;s linguistic homogeneity.

==Dialects==


The inhabitants of different regions of Poland speak Polish somewhat differently, although the differences between modern-day vernacular varieties and standard Polish () appear relatively slight. Most of the middle aged and young speak vernaculars close to standard Polish, while the traditional dialects are preserved among older people in rural areas. First-language speakers of Polish have no trouble understanding each other, and non-native speakers may have difficulty recognizing the regional and social differences. The modern standard dialect, often termed as &quot;correct Polish&quot;, is spoken or at least understood throughout the entire country.

Polish has traditionally been described as consisting of three to five main regional dialects:
* Greater Polish, spoken in the west
* Lesser Polish, spoken in the south and southeast
* Masovian, spoken throughout the central and eastern parts of the country

Silesian and Kashubian, spoken in Upper Silesia and Pomerania respectively, are thought of as either Polish dialects or distinct languages, depending on the criteria used.

Kashubian contains a number of features not found elsewhere in Poland, e.g. nine distinct oral vowels (vs. the six of standard Polish) and (in the northern dialects) phonemic word stress, an archaic feature preserved from Common Slavic times and not found anywhere else among the West Slavic languages. However, it was described by some linguists as lacking most of the linguistic and social determinants of language-hood.

Many linguistic sources categorize Silesian as a regional language separate from Polish, while some consider Silesian to be a dialect of Polish. Many Silesians consider themselves a separate ethnicity and have been advocating for the recognition of Silesian as a regional language in Poland. The law recognizing it as such was passed by the Sejm and Senate in April 2024, but has been vetoed by President Andrzej Duda in late May of 2024.

According to the last official census in Poland in 2011, over half a million people declared Silesian as their native language. Many sociolinguists (e.g. Tomasz Kamusella, Agnieszka Pianka, Alfred F. Majewicz, Tomasz Wicherkiewicz) assume that extralinguistic criteria decide whether a lect is an independent language or a dialect: speakers of the speech variety or/and political decisions, and this is dynamic (i.e. it changes over time). Also, research organizations such as SIL International and resources for the academic field of linguistics such as &quot;Ethnologue&quot;, Linguist List and others, for example the Ministry of Administration and Digitization recognized the Silesian language. In July 2007, the Silesian language was recognized by ISO, and was attributed an ISO code of szl.

Some additional characteristic but less widespread regional dialects include:
# The distinctive dialect of the Gorals (&quot;Góralski&quot;) occurs in the mountainous area bordering the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The Gorals (&quot;Highlanders&quot;) take great pride in their culture and the dialect. It exhibits some cultural influences from the Vlach shepherds in the 14th–17th centuries.
# The Poznański dialect, spoken in Poznań and to some extent in the whole region of the former Prussian Partition (excluding Upper Silesia), with noticeable German influences.
# In the northern and western (formerly German) regions where Poles from the territories annexed by the Soviet Union resettled after World War II, the older generation speaks a dialect of Polish characteristic of the Kresy that includes a longer pronunciation of vowels.
# Poles living in Lithuania (particularly in the Vilnius region), in Belarus (particularly the northwest), and in the northeast of Poland continue to speak the Eastern Borderlands dialect, which sounds &quot;slushed&quot; (in Polish described as &quot;zaciąganie z ruska&quot;, &quot;speaking with a Ruthenian drawl&quot;) and is easily distinguishable.
# Some city dwellers, especially the less affluent population, had their own distinctive dialects – for example, the Warsaw dialect, still spoken by some of the population of Praga on the eastern bank of the Vistula. However, these city dialects are mostly extinct due to assimilation with standard Polish.
# Many Poles living in emigrant communities (for example, in the United States), whose families left Poland just after World War II, retain a number of minor features of Polish vocabulary as spoken in the first half of the 20th century that now sound archaic to contemporary visitors from Poland.

Polish linguistics has been characterized by a strong strive towards promoting prescriptive ideas of language intervention and usage uniformity, along with normatively-oriented notions of language &quot;correctness&quot; (unusual by Western standards).

==Phonology==


===Vowels===
Polish has six oral vowels (seven oral vowels in written form), which are all monophthongs, and two nasal vowels. The oral vowels are (spelled ), (spelled and also transcribed as /ɘ/ or /ɪ/), (spelled ), (spelled ), (spelled ) and (spelled and as separate letters). The nasal vowels are /ɛw̃/ (spelled ) and /ɔw̃/ (spelled ). Unlike Czech or Slovak, Polish does not retain phonemic vowel length — the letter , which formerly represented lengthened /ɔː/ in older forms of the language, is now vestigial and instead corresponds to /u/.

===Consonants===
The Polish consonant system shows more complexity: its characteristic features include the series of affricate and palatal consonants that resulted from four Proto-Slavic palatalizations and two further palatalizations that took place in Polish. The full set of consonants, together with their most common spellings, can be presented as follows (although other phonological analyses exist):


Neutralization occurs between voiced–voiceless consonant pairs in certain environments, at the end of words (where devoicing occurs) and in certain consonant clusters (where assimilation occurs). For details, see &quot;Voicing and devoicing&quot; in the article on Polish phonology.

Most Polish words are paroxytones (that is, the stress falls on the second-to-last syllable of a polysyllabic word), although there are exceptions.

===Consonant distribution===
Polish permits complex consonant clusters, which historically often arose from the disappearance of yers. Polish can have word-initial and word-medial clusters of up to four consonants, whereas word-final clusters can have up to five consonants. Examples of such clusters can be found in words such as &quot;bezwzględny&quot; (&#x27;absolute&#x27; or &#x27;heartless&#x27;, &#x27;ruthless&#x27;), &quot;źdźbło&quot; (&#x27;blade of grass&#x27;), (&#x27;shock&#x27;), and &quot;krnąbrność&quot; (&#x27;disobedience&#x27;). A popular Polish tongue-twister (from a verse by Jan Brzechwa) is (&#x27;In Szczebrzeszyn a beetle buzzes in the reed&#x27;).

Unlike languages such as Czech, Polish does not have syllabic consonants – the nucleus of a syllable is always a vowel.

The consonant is restricted to positions adjacent to a vowel. It also cannot precede the letter .

===Prosody===

The predominant stress pattern in Polish is penultimate stress – in a word of more than one syllable, the next-to-last syllable is stressed. Alternating preceding syllables carry secondary stress, e.g. in a four-syllable word, where the primary stress is on the third syllable, there will be secondary stress on the first.

Each vowel represents one syllable, although the letter normally does not represent a vowel when it precedes another vowel (it represents , palatalization of the preceding consonant, or both depending on analysis). Also the letters and sometimes represent only semivowels when they follow another vowel, as in (&#x27;author&#x27;), mostly in loanwords (so not in native &#x27;science, the act of learning&#x27;, for example, nor in nativized &#x27;Matthew&#x27;).

Some loanwords, particularly from the classical languages, have the stress on the antepenultimate (third-from-last) syllable. For example, () (&#x27;physics&#x27;) is stressed on the first syllable. This may lead to a rare phenomenon of minimal pairs differing only in stress placement, for example &#x27;music&#x27; vs. – genitive singular of &#x27;musician&#x27;. When additional syllables are added to such words through inflection or suffixation, the stress normally becomes regular. For example, (, &#x27;university&#x27;) has irregular stress on the third (or antepenultimate) syllable, but the genitive () and derived adjective () have regular stress on the penultimate syllables. Loanwords generally become nativized to have penultimate stress. In psycholinguistic experiments, speakers of Polish have been demonstrated to be sensitive to the distinction between regular penultimate and exceptional antepenultimate stress.

Another class of exceptions is verbs with the conditional endings , etc. These endings are not counted in determining the position of the stress; for example, (&#x27;I would do&#x27;) is stressed on the first syllable, and (&#x27;we would do&#x27;) on the second. According to prescriptive authorities, the same applies to the first and second person plural past tense endings , although this rule is often ignored in colloquial speech (so &#x27;we did&#x27; should be prescriptively stressed on the second syllable, although in practice it is commonly stressed on the third as ). These irregular stress patterns are explained by the fact that these endings are detachable clitics rather than true verbal inflections: for example, instead of (&#x27;whom did you see?&#x27;) it is possible to say – here retains its usual stress (first syllable) in spite of the attachment of the clitic. Reanalysis of the endings as inflections when attached to verbs causes the different colloquial stress patterns. These stress patterns are considered part of a &quot;usable&quot; norm of standard Polish - in contrast to the &quot;model&quot; (&quot;high&quot;) norm.

Some common word combinations are stressed as if they were a single word. This applies in particular to many combinations of preposition plus a personal pronoun, such as (&#x27;to her&#x27;), (&#x27;on us&#x27;), (&#x27;because of me&#x27;), all stressed on the bolded syllable.

==Orthography==

The Polish alphabet derives from the Latin script but includes certain additional letters formed using diacritics. The Polish alphabet was one of three major forms of Latin-based orthography developed for Western and some South Slavic languages, the others being Czech orthography and Croatian orthography, the last of these being a 19th-century invention trying to make a compromise between the first two. Kashubian uses a Polish-based system, Slovak uses a Czech-based system, and Slovene follows the Croatian one; the Sorbian languages blend the Polish and the Czech ones.

Historically, Poland&#x27;s once diverse and multi-ethnic population utilized many forms of scripture to write Polish. For instance, Lipka Tatars and Muslims inhabiting the eastern parts of the former Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth wrote Polish in the Arabic alphabet. The Cyrillic script is used to a certain extent today by Polish speakers in Western Belarus, especially for religious texts.

The diacritics used in the Polish alphabet are the (graphically similar to the acute accent) over the letters and through the letter in ; the (superior dot) over the letter , and the (&quot;little tail&quot;) under the letters . The letters &quot;q, v, x&quot; are used only in foreign words and names.

Polish orthography is largely phonemic—there is a consistent correspondence between letters (or digraphs and trigraphs) and phonemes (for exceptions see below). The letters of the alphabet and their normal phonemic values are listed in the following table.

The following digraphs and trigraphs are used:
Voiced consonant letters frequently come to represent voiceless sounds (as shown in the tables); this occurs at the end of words and in certain clusters, due to the neutralization mentioned in the &quot;Phonology&quot; section above. Occasionally also voiceless consonant letters can represent voiced sounds in clusters.

The spelling rule for the palatal sounds , , , and is as follows: before the vowel the plain letters are used; before other vowels the combinations are used; when not followed by a vowel the diacritic forms are used. For example, the in (&quot;grey-haired&quot;), the in (&quot;sulfur&quot;) and the in (&quot;holy&quot;) all represent the sound . The exceptions to the above rule are certain loanwords from Latin, Italian, French, Russian or English—where before is pronounced as , e.g. , , , , , , , . In other loanwords the vowel is changed to , e.g. , , , .

The following table shows the correspondence between the sounds and spelling:

Digraphs and trigraphs are used:
Similar principles apply to , , and , except that these can only occur before vowels, so the spellings are before , and otherwise. Most Polish speakers, however, do not consider palatalization of or as creating new sounds.

Except in the cases mentioned above, the letter if followed by another vowel in the same word usually represents , yet a palatalization of the previous consonant is always assumed.

The reverse case, where the consonant remains unpalatalized but is followed by a palatalized consonant, is written by using instead of : for example, , &quot;to eat up&quot;.

The letters and , when followed by plosives and affricates, represent an oral vowel followed by a nasal consonant, rather than a nasal vowel. For example, in (&quot;oak&quot;) is pronounced , and in (&quot;rainbow&quot;) is pronounced (the nasal assimilates to the following consonant). When followed by or (for example , ), is pronounced as just . When is at the end of the word it is often pronounced as just .

Depending on the word, the phoneme can be spelt or , the phoneme can be spelt or , and can be spelt or . In several cases it determines the meaning, for example: (&quot;maybe&quot;) and (&quot;sea&quot;).

In occasional words, letters that normally form a digraph are pronounced separately. For example, represents , not , in words like (&quot;freeze&quot;) and in the name &quot;&quot;.

Doubled letters are usually pronounced as a single, lengthened consonant, however, some speakers might pronounce the combination as two separate sounds.

There are certain clusters where a written consonant would not be pronounced. For example, the in the word (&quot;apple&quot;) might be omitted in ordinary speech, leading to the pronunciation .

== Grammar ==

Polish is a highly fusional language with relatively free word order, although the dominant arrangement is subject–verb–object (SVO). There are no articles, and subject pronouns are often dropped.

Nouns belong to one of three genders: masculine, feminine and neuter. The masculine gender is also divided into subgenders: animate vs inanimate in the singular, human vs nonhuman in the plural. There are seven cases: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, instrumental, locative and vocative.

Adjectives agree with nouns in terms of gender, case, and number. Attributive adjectives most commonly precede the noun, although in certain cases, especially in fixed phrases (like , &quot;Polish (language)&quot;), the noun may come first; the rule of thumb is that generic descriptive adjectives normally precede (e.g. , &quot;beautiful flower&quot;) while categorizing adjectives often follow the noun (e.g. , &quot;black coal&quot;). Most short adjectives and their derived adverbs form comparatives and superlatives by inflection (the superlative is formed by prefixing to the comparative).

Verbs are of imperfective or perfective aspect, often occurring in pairs. Imperfective verbs have a present tense, past tense, compound future tense (except for &quot;to be&quot;, which has a simple future etc., this in turn being used to form the compound future of other verbs), subjunctive/conditional (formed with the detachable particle ), imperatives, an infinitive, present participle, present gerund and past participle. Perfective verbs have a simple future tense (formed like the present tense of imperfective verbs), past tense, subjunctive/conditional, imperatives, infinitive, present gerund and past participle. Conjugated verb forms agree with their subject in terms of person, number, and (in the case of past tense and subjunctive/conditional forms) gender.

Passive-type constructions can be made using the auxiliary or (&quot;become&quot;) with the passive participle. There is also an impersonal construction where the active verb is used (in third person singular) with no subject, but with the reflexive pronoun present to indicate a general, unspecified subject (as in &quot;vodka is being drunk&quot;—note that appears in the accusative). A similar sentence type in the past tense uses the passive participle with the ending , as in (&quot;people were seen&quot;). As in other Slavic languages, there are also subjectless sentences formed using such words as (&quot;it is possible&quot;) together with an infinitive.

Yes–no questions (both direct and indirect) are formed by placing the word (&quot;whether&quot;) at the start, although it&#x27;s often omitted in casual speech. Negation uses the word , before the verb or other item being negated; is still added before the verb even if the sentence also contains other negatives such as (&quot;never&quot;) or (&quot;nothing&quot;), effectively creating a double negative.

Cardinal numbers have a complex system of inflection and agreement. Zero and cardinal numbers higher than five (except for those ending with the digit 2, 3 or 4 but not ending with 12, 13 or 14) govern the genitive case rather than the nominative or accusative. Special forms of numbers (collective numerals) are used with certain classes of noun, which include (&quot;child&quot;) and exclusively plural nouns such as (&quot;door&quot;).

==Borrowed words==
Polish has, over the centuries, borrowed a number of words from other languages. When borrowing, pronunciation was adapted to Polish phonemes and spelling was altered to match Polish orthography. In addition, word endings are liberally applied to almost any word to produce verbs, nouns, adjectives, as well as adding the appropriate endings for cases of nouns, adjectives, diminutives, double-diminutives, augmentatives, etc.

Depending on the historical period, borrowing has proceeded from various languages. Notable influences have been Latin (10th–18th centuries), Czech (10th and 14th–15th centuries), Italian (16th–17th centuries), French (17th–19th centuries), German (13–15th and 18th–20th centuries), Hungarian (15th–16th centuries) and Turkish (17th century). Currently, English words are the most common imports to Polish.

Loanwords make up 26.2% of the Polish vocabulary, with 36.3% originating from Latin, 19.7% from German, 15.9% from French, 7.1% from Czech, 3.8% from Greek, 3.5% from English, 3.1% from Italian, 1.9% from Ukrainian and Belarusian, 1.4% from Russian, and 1.5% from other languages; 5.9% are artificial borrowings (usually compound words of undetermined origin).

The Latin language, for a very long time the only official language of the Polish state, has had a great influence on Polish. Many Polish words were direct borrowings or calques (e.g. &quot;&quot; from &quot;res publica&quot;) from Latin. Latin was known to a larger or smaller degree by most of the numerous szlachta in the 16th to 18th centuries (and it continued to be extensively taught at secondary schools until World War II). Apart from dozens of loanwords, its influence can also be seen in a number of verbatim Latin phrases in Polish literature (especially from the 19th century and earlier).
During the 12th and 13th centuries, Mongolian words were brought to the Polish language during wars with the armies of Genghis Khan and his descendants, e.g. &quot;dzida&quot; (spear) and &quot;szereg&quot; (a line or row).

Words from Czech, an important influence during the 10th and 14th–15th centuries include &quot;sejm&quot;, &quot;hańba&quot; and &quot;brama&quot;.

In 1518, the Polish king Sigismund I the Old married Bona Sforza, the niece of the Holy Roman emperor Maximilian, who introduced Italian cuisine to Poland, especially vegetables. Hence, words from Italian include &quot;pomidor&quot; from &quot;pomodoro&quot; (tomato), &quot;kalafior&quot; from &quot;cavolfiore&quot; (cauliflower), and &quot;pomarańcza&quot;, a portmanteau from Italian &quot;pomo&quot; (pome) plus &quot;arancio&quot; (orange). A later word of Italian origin is &quot;autostrada&quot; (from Italian &quot;autostrada&quot;, highway).

In the 18th century, with the rising prominence of France in Europe, French supplanted Latin as an important source of words. Some French borrowings also date from the Napoleonic era, when the Poles were enthusiastic supporters of Napoleon. Examples include &quot;ekran&quot; (from French &quot;écran&quot;, screen), &quot;abażur&quot; (&quot;abat-jour&quot;, lamp shade), &quot;biuro&quot; (&quot;bureau&quot;, office), &quot;biżuteria&quot; (&quot;bijou&quot;, jewelry), &quot;rekin&quot; (&quot;requin&quot;, shark), &quot;meble&quot; (&quot;meuble&quot;, furniture), &quot;bagaż&quot; (&quot;bagage&quot;, luggage), &quot;walizka&quot; (&quot;valise&quot;, suitcase), &quot;fotel&quot; (&quot;fauteuil&quot;, armchair), &quot;plaża&quot; (&quot;plage&quot;, beach) and &quot;koszmar&quot; (&quot;cauchemar&quot;, nightmare). Some place names have also been adapted from French, such as the Warsaw boroughs of Żoliborz (&quot;joli bord&quot; = beautiful riverside), Marymont (&quot;Marie mont&quot; = Mary&#x27;s hill) as well as the town of Żyrardów (from the name Girard, with the Polish suffix -ów attached to refer to the founder of the town).

Many words were borrowed from the German language from the sizable German population in Polish cities during medieval times. German words found in the Polish language are often connected with trade, the building industry, civic rights and city life. Some words were assimilated verbatim, for example &quot;handel&quot; (trade) and &quot;dach&quot; (roof); others are pronounced similarly, but differ in writing &quot;Schnur&quot;—&quot;sznur&quot; (cord). As a result of being neighbors with Germany, Polish has many German expressions which have become literally translated (calques). The regional dialects of Upper Silesia and Masuria (Modern Polish East Prussia) have noticeably more German loanwords than other varieties.

The contacts with Ottoman Turkey in the 17th century brought many new words, some of them still in use, such as: &quot;jar&quot; (&quot;yar&quot; deep valley), &quot;szaszłyk&quot; (&quot;şişlik&quot; shish kebab), &quot;filiżanka&quot; (&quot;fincan&quot; cup), &quot;arbuz&quot; (&quot;karpuz&quot; watermelon), &quot;dywan&quot; (&quot;divan&quot; carpet), etc.

From the founding of the Kingdom of Poland in 1025 through the early years of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth created in 1569, Poland was the most tolerant country of Jews in Europe. Known as the &quot;paradise for the Jews&quot;, it became a shelter for persecuted and expelled European Jewish communities and the home to the world&#x27;s largest Jewish community of the time. As a result, many Polish words come from Yiddish, spoken by the large Polish Jewish population that existed until the Holocaust. Borrowed Yiddish words include &quot;bachor&quot; (an unruly boy or child), &quot;bajzel&quot; (slang for mess), &quot;belfer&quot; (slang for teacher), &quot;ciuchy&quot; (slang for clothing), &quot;cymes&quot; (slang for very tasty food), &quot;geszeft&quot; (slang for business), &quot;kitel&quot; (slang for apron), &quot;machlojka&quot; (slang for scam), &quot;mamona&quot; (money), &quot;manele&quot; (slang for oddments), &quot;myszygene&quot; (slang for lunatic), &quot;pinda&quot; (slang for girl, pejoratively), &quot;plajta&quot; (slang for bankruptcy), &quot;rejwach&quot; (noise), &quot;szmal&quot; (slang for money), and &quot;trefny&quot; (dodgy).

The mountain dialects of the Górale in southern Poland, have quite a number of words borrowed from Hungarian (e.g. &quot;baca&quot;, &quot;gazda&quot;, &quot;juhas&quot;, &quot;hejnał&quot;) and Romanian as a result of historical contacts with Hungarian-dominated Slovakia and Wallachian herders who travelled north along the Carpathians.

Thieves&#x27; slang includes such words as &quot;kimać&quot; (to sleep) or &quot;majcher&quot; (knife) of Greek origin, considered then unknown to the outside world.

In addition, Turkish and Tatar have exerted influence upon the vocabulary of war, names of oriental costumes etc. Russian borrowings began to make their way into Polish from the second half of the 19th century on.

Polish has also received an intensive number of English loanwords, particularly after World War II. Recent loanwords come primarily from the English language, mainly those that have Latin or Greek roots, for example (computer), (from &#x27;corruption&#x27;, but sense restricted to &#x27;bribery&#x27;) etc. Concatenation of parts of words (e.g. &quot;auto-moto&quot;), which is not native to Polish but common in English, for example, is also sometimes used. When borrowing English words, Polish often changes their spelling. For example, Latin suffix &#x27;-tio&#x27; corresponds to &quot;-cja&quot;. To make the word plural, &quot;-cja&quot; becomes &quot;-cje&quot;. Examples of this include &quot;inauguracja&quot; (inauguration), &quot;dewastacja&quot; (devastation), &quot;recepcja&quot; (reception), &quot;konurbacja&quot; (conurbation) and &quot;konotacje&quot; (connotations). Also, the digraph &quot;qu&quot; becomes &quot;kw&quot; (&quot;kwadrant&quot; = quadrant; &quot;kworum&quot; = quorum).

==Loanwords from Polish in other languages==
The Polish language has influenced others. Particular influences appear in other Slavic languages and in German — due to their proximity and shared borders. Examples of loanwords include German (border), Dutch and Afrikaans from Polish ; German from Polish (weatherfish); German , French , Swedish , and English &quot;sable&quot; from Polish ; and (&quot;little tail&quot;) — the word describing a diacritic hook-sign added below some letters in various alphabets. The common Germanic word &quot;quartz&quot; comes from the dialectical Old Polish &quot;kwardy&quot;. &quot;Szmata,&quot; a Polish, Slovak and Ruthenian word for &quot;mop&quot; or &quot;rag&quot;, became part of Yiddish. The Polish language exerted significant lexical influence upon Ukrainian, particularly in the fields of abstract and technical terminology; for example, the Ukrainian word (country) is derived from Polish . The Polish influence on Ukrainian is particularly marked on western Ukrainian dialects in western Ukraine, which for centuries was under Polish cultural domination.

There are a substantial number of Polish words which officially became part of Yiddish, once the main language of European Jews. These include basic items, objects or terms such as a bread bun (Polish , Yiddish ), a fishing rod (, ), an oak (, ), a meadow (, ), a moustache (, ) and a bladder (, ).

Quite a few culinary loanwords exist in German and in other languages, some of which describe distinctive features of Polish cuisine. These include German and English from (a kind of fresh cheese) and German , English &quot;gherkin&quot; from (cucumber). The word (Polish dumplings) has spread internationally, as well as (Polish donuts) and kiełbasa (sausage, e.g. in Esperanto). As far as concerned, the original Polish word is already in plural (sing. , plural ; stem , plural ending ; NB. becomes in a closed syllable, like here in singular), yet it is commonly used with the English plural ending &quot;-s&quot; in Canada and United States of America, &quot;pierogis&quot;, thus making it a &quot;double plural&quot;. A similar situation happened with the Polish loanword from English (&quot;potato chips&quot;)—from English &quot;chips&quot; being already plural in the original (&quot;chip&quot; + &quot;-s&quot;), yet it has obtained the Polish plural ending .

It is believed that the English word &quot;spruce&quot; was derived from &quot;Prusy&quot;, the Polish name for the region of Prussia. It became &quot;spruce&quot; because in Polish, &quot;z Prus&quot;, sounded like &quot;spruce&quot; in English (transl. &quot;from Prussia&quot;) and was a generic term for commodities brought to England by Hanseatic merchants and because the tree was believed to have come from Polish Ducal Prussia. However, it can be argued that the word is actually derived from the Old French term &quot;Pruce&quot;, meaning literally Prussia.

==Literature==
The Polish language started to be used in literature in the Late Middle Ages. Notable works include the &quot;Holy Cross Sermons&quot; (13th/14th century), &quot;Bogurodzica&quot; (15th century) and &quot;Master Polikarp&#x27;s Dialog with Death&quot; (15th century). The most influential Renaissance-era literary figures in Poland were poet Jan Kochanowski (&quot;Laments&quot;), Mikołaj Rej and Piotr Skarga (&quot;The Lives of the Saints&quot;) who established poetic patterns that would become integral to the Polish literary language and laid foundations for the modern Polish grammar. During the Age of Enlightenment in Poland, Ignacy Krasicki, known as &quot;the Prince of Poets&quot;, wrote the first Polish novel called &quot;The Adventures of Mr. Nicholas Wisdom&quot; as well as &quot;Fables and Parables&quot;. Another significant work form this period is &quot;The Manuscript Found in Saragossa&quot; written by Jan Potocki, a Polish nobleman, Egyptologist, linguist, and adventurer.

In the Romantic Era, the most celebrated national poets, referred to as the Three Bards, were Adam Mickiewicz (&quot;Pan Tadeusz&quot; and &quot;Dziady&quot;), Juliusz Słowacki (&quot;Balladyna&quot;) and Zygmunt Krasiński (&quot;The Undivine Comedy&quot;). Poet and dramatist Cyprian Norwid is regarded by some scholars as the &quot;Fourth Bard&quot;. Important positivist writers include Bolesław Prus (&quot;The Doll&quot;, &quot;Pharaoh&quot;), Henryk Sienkiewicz (author of numerous historical novels the most internationally acclaimed of which is &quot;Quo Vadis&quot;), Maria Konopnicka (&quot;Rota&quot;), Eliza Orzeszkowa (&quot;Nad Niemnem&quot;), Adam Asnyk and Gabriela Zapolska (&quot;The Morality of Mrs. Dulska&quot;). The period known as Young Poland produced such renowned literary figures as Stanisław Wyspiański (&quot;The Wedding&quot;), Stefan Żeromski (&quot;Homeless People&quot;, &quot;The Spring to Come&quot;), Władysław Reymont (&quot;The Peasants&quot;) and Leopold Staff. The prominent interbellum period authors include Maria Dąbrowska (&quot;Nights and Days&quot;), Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz (&quot;Insatiability&quot;), Julian Tuwim, Bruno Schulz, Bolesław Leśmian, Witold Gombrowicz and Zuzanna Ginczanka.

Other notable writers and poets from Poland active during World War II and after are Aleksander Kamiński, Zbigniew Herbert, Stanisław Lem, Zofia Nałkowska, Tadeusz Borowski, Sławomir Mrożek, Krzysztof Kamil Baczyński, Julia Hartwig, Marek Krajewski, Joanna Bator, Andrzej Sapkowski, Adam Zagajewski, Dorota Masłowska, Jerzy Pilch, Ryszard Kapuściński and Andrzej Stasiuk.

Five people writing in the Polish language have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature: Henryk Sienkiewicz (1905), Władysław Reymont (1924), Czesław Miłosz (1980), Wisława Szymborska (1996) and Olga Tokarczuk (2018).

<text>Pulp magazines (also referred to as &quot;the pulps&quot;) were inexpensive fiction magazines that were published from 1896 until around 1955. The term &quot;pulp&quot; derives from the wood pulp paper on which the magazines were printed, due to their cheap nature. In contrast, magazines printed on higher-quality paper were called &quot;glossies&quot; or &quot;slicks&quot;. The typical pulp magazine had 128 pages; it was wide by high, and thick, with ragged, untrimmed edges. Pulps were the successors to the penny dreadfuls, dime novels, and short-fiction magazines of the 19th century.

Although many respected writers wrote for pulps, the magazines were best known for their lurid, exploitative, and sensational subject matter, even though this was but a small part of what existed in the pulps. Digest magazines and men&#x27;s adventure magazines were incorrectly regarded as pulps, though they have different editorial and production standards and are instead replacements. Modern superhero comic books are sometimes considered descendants of &quot;hero pulps&quot;; pulp magazines often featured illustrated novel-length stories of heroic characters, such as Flash Gordon, The Shadow, Doc Savage, and The Phantom Detective.

The pulps gave rise to the term pulp fiction in reference to run-of-the-mill, low-quality literature. Successors of pulps include paperback books, such as hardboiled detective stories and erotic fiction.

==History==
===Origins===
Before pulp magazines, Newgate novels (1840s-1860s) fictionalized the exploits of real-life criminals. Later, British sensation novels gained peak popularity in the 1860s-1870s. Sensation novels focused on shocking stories that reflected modern-day anxieties, and were the direct precursors of pulp fiction. 

The first &quot;pulp&quot; was Frank Munsey&#x27;s revamped &quot;Argosy&quot; magazine of 1896, with about 135,000 words (192 pages) per issue, on pulp paper with untrimmed edges, and no illustrations, even on the cover. The steam-powered printing press had been in widespread use for some time, enabling the boom in dime novels; prior to Munsey, however, no one had combined cheap printing, cheap paper and cheap authors in a package that provided affordable entertainment to young working-class people. In six years, &quot;Argosy&quot; went from a few thousand copies per month to over half a million.

Street &amp; Smith, a dime novel and boys&#x27; weekly publisher, was next on the market. Seeing &quot;Argosy&quot;″s success, they launched &quot;The Popular Magazine&quot; in 1903, which they billed as the &quot;biggest magazine in the world&quot; by virtue of its being two pages (the interior sides of the front and back cover) longer than &quot;Argosy&quot;. Due to differences in page layout however, the magazine had substantially less text than &quot;Argosy&quot;. &quot;The Popular Magazine&quot; did introduce color covers to pulp publishing, and the magazine began to take off when in 1905 the publishers acquired the rights to serialize &quot;Ayesha&quot; (1905), by H. Rider Haggard, a sequel to his popular novel &quot;&quot; (1887). Haggard&#x27;s Lost World genre influenced several key pulp writers, including Edgar Rice Burroughs, Robert E. Howard, Talbot Mundy and Abraham Merritt. In 1907, the cover price rose to 15 cents and 30 pages were added to each issue; along with establishing a stable of authors for each magazine, this change proved successful and circulation began to approach that of &quot;Argosy&quot;. Street and Smith&#x27;s next innovation was the introduction of specialized genre pulps, with each magazine focusing on a particular genre, such as detective stories, romance, etc.
===Peak of popularity===
At their peak of popularity in the 1920s–1940s, the most successful pulps sold up to one million copies per issue. In 1934, Frank Gruber said there were some 150 pulp titles. The most successful pulp magazines were &quot;Argosy&quot;, &quot;Adventure&quot;, &quot;Blue Book&quot; and &quot;Short Stories&quot;, collectively described by some pulp historians as &quot;The Big Four&quot;. Among the best-known other titles of this period were &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, &quot;Black Mask&quot;, &quot;Dime Detective&quot;, &quot;Flying Aces&quot;, &quot;Horror Stories&quot;, &quot;Love Story Magazine&quot;, &quot;Marvel Tales&quot;, &quot;Oriental Stories&quot;, &quot;Planet Stories&quot;, &quot;Spicy Detective&quot;, &quot;Startling Stories&quot;, &quot;Thrilling Wonder Stories&quot;, &quot;Unknown&quot;, &quot;Weird Tales&quot; and &quot;Western Story Magazine&quot;.

During the economic hardships of the Great Depression, pulps provided affordable content to the masses, and were one of the primary forms of entertainment, along with film and radio.

Although pulp magazines were primarily an American phenomenon, there were also a number of British pulp magazines published between the Edwardian era and World War II. Notable UK pulps included &quot;The Pall Mall Magazine&quot;, &quot;The Novel Magazine&quot;, &quot;Cassell&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, &quot;The Story-Teller&quot;, &quot;The Sovereign Magazine&quot;, &quot;Hutchinson&#x27;s Adventure-Story&quot; and &quot;Hutchinson&#x27;s Mystery-Story&quot;. The German fantasy magazine &quot;Der Orchideengarten&quot; had a similar format to American pulp magazines, in that it was printed on rough pulp paper and heavily illustrated.

===World War II and market decline===
During the Second World War, paper shortages had a serious impact on pulp production, starting a steady rise in costs and the decline of the pulps. Following the model of &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot; in 1941, some magazines began to switch to digest size: smaller, sometimes thicker magazines. In 1949, Street &amp; Smith closed most of their pulp magazines in order to move upmarket and produce slicks.

Competition from comic-books and paperback novels further eroded the pulps&#x27; market share, but it has been suggested the widespread expansion of television also drew away the readership of the pulps. In a more affluent post-war America, the price gap compared to slick magazines was far less significant. In the 1950s, men&#x27;s adventure magazines also began to draw some former pulp readers.

The 1957 liquidation of the American News Company, then the primary distributor of pulp magazines, has sometimes been taken as marking the end of the &quot;pulp era&quot;; by that date, many of the famous pulps of the previous generation, including &quot;Black Mask,&quot; &quot;The Shadow,&quot; &quot;Doc Savage,&quot; and &quot;Weird Tales,&quot; were defunct (though some of those titles have been revived in various formats in the decades since). Almost all of the few remaining former pulp magazines are science fiction or mystery magazines, now in formats similar to &quot;digest size&quot;, such as &quot;Analog Science Fiction and Fact&quot;, though the most durable revival of &quot;Weird Tales&quot; began in pulp format, though published on good-quality paper. The old format is still in use for some lengthy serials, like the German science fiction weekly &quot;Perry Rhodan&quot; (over 3,000 issues as of 2019).

Over the course of their evolution, there were a huge number of pulp magazine titles; Harry Steeger of Popular Publications claimed that his company alone had published over 300, and at their peak they were publishing 42 titles per month. Many titles of course survived only briefly. While the most popular titles were monthly, many were bimonthly and some were quarterly.

The collapse of the pulp industry changed the landscape of publishing because pulps were the single largest sales outlet for short stories. Combined with the decrease in slick magazine fiction markets, writers trying to support themselves by creating fiction switched to novels and book-length anthologies of shorter pieces. Some ex-pulp writers like Hugh B. Cave and Robert Leslie Bellem had moved on to writing for television by the 1950s.

==Genres==

Pulp magazines often contained a wide variety of genre fiction, including, but not limited to:
*adventure
*aviation
*detective/mystery
*espionage
*fantasy
*gangster
*&quot;girlie pulps&quot;, also called &quot;saucy/spicy pulps&quot; or &quot;sex pulps&quot; (including soft porn)
*horror/occult (including &quot;weird menace&quot;)
*humor
*railroad
*romance
*science fiction
*&quot;série noire&quot; (French crime fiction)
*sports
*war
*Westerns (also see dime Westerns); the Colorado artist Arthur Roy Mitchell is particularly known for his sketches of the covers of such magazines.

The American Old West was a mainstay genre of early turn of the 20th-century novels as well as later pulp magazines, and lasted longest of all the traditional pulps. In many ways, the later men&#x27;s adventure (&quot;the sweats&quot;) was the replacement of pulps.

Many classic science fiction and crime novels were originally serialized in pulp magazines such as &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, and &quot;Black Mask&quot;.

==Notable original characters==

While the majority of pulp magazines were anthology titles featuring many different authors, characters and settings, some of the most enduring magazines were those that featured a single recurring character. These were often referred to as &quot;hero pulps&quot; because the recurring character was almost always a larger-than-life hero in the mold of Doc Savage or The Shadow.

Popular pulp characters that headlined in their own magazines:
Popular pulp characters who appeared in anthology titles such as &quot;All-Story&quot; or &quot;Weird Tales&quot;:
==Illustrators==
Pulp covers were printed in color on higher-quality (slick) paper. They were famous for their half-dressed damsels in distress, usually awaiting a rescuing hero. Cover art played a major part in the marketing of pulp magazines. The early pulp magazines could boast covers by some distinguished American artists; &quot;The Popular Magazine&quot; had covers by N. C. Wyeth, and Edgar Franklin Wittmack contributed cover art to &quot;Argosy&quot; and &quot;Short Stories&quot;. Later, many artists specialized in creating covers mainly for the pulps; a number of the most successful cover artists became as popular as the authors featured on the interior pages. Among the most famous pulp artists were Walter M. Baumhofer, Earle K. Bergey, Margaret Brundage, Edd Cartier, Virgil Finlay, Frank R. Paul, Norman Saunders, Emmett Watson, Nick Eggenhofer, (who specialized in Western illustrations), Hugh J. Ward, George Rozen, and Rudolph Belarski. Covers were important enough to sales that sometimes they would be designed first; authors would then be shown the cover art and asked to write a story to match.

Later pulps began to feature interior illustrations, depicting elements of the stories. The drawings were printed in black ink on the same cream-colored paper used for the text, and had to use specific techniques to avoid blotting on the coarse texture of the cheap pulp. Thus, fine lines and heavy detail were usually not an option. Shading was by crosshatching or pointillism, and even that had to be limited and coarse. Usually the art was black lines on the paper&#x27;s background, but Finlay and a few others did some work that was primarily white lines against large dark areas.

==Authors and editors==
Another way pulps kept costs down was by paying authors less than other markets; thus many eminent authors started out in the pulps before they were successful enough to sell to better-paying markets, and similarly, well-known authors whose careers were slumping or who wanted a few quick dollars could bolster their income with sales to pulps. Additionally, some of the earlier pulps solicited stories from amateurs who were quite happy to see their words in print and could thus be paid token amounts.

There were also career pulp writers, capable of turning out huge amounts of prose on a steady basis, often with the aid of dictation to stenographers, machines or typists. Before he became a novelist, Upton Sinclair was turning out at least 8,000 words per day seven days a week for the pulps, keeping two stenographers fully employed. Pulps would often have their authors use multiple pen names so that they could use multiple stories by the same person in one issue, or use a given author&#x27;s stories in three or more successive issues, while still appearing to have varied content. One advantage pulps provided to authors was that they paid &quot;upon acceptance&quot; for material instead of on publication. Since a story might be accepted months or even years before publication, to a working writer this was a crucial difference in cash flow.

Some pulp editors became known for cultivating good fiction and interesting features in their magazines. Preeminent pulp magazine editors included Arthur Sullivant Hoffman (&quot;Adventure&quot;), Robert H. Davis (&quot;All-Story Weekly&quot;), Harry E. Maule (&quot;Short Stories&quot;), Donald Kennicott (&quot;Blue Book&quot;), Joseph Shaw (&quot;Black Mask&quot;), Farnsworth Wright (&quot;Weird Tales&quot;, &quot;Oriental Stories&quot;), John W. Campbell (&quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;, &quot;Unknown&quot;) and Daisy Bacon (&quot;Love Story Magazine&quot;, &quot;Detective Story Magazine&quot;).

==Authors featured==
Well-known authors who wrote for pulps include:

Sinclair Lewis, first American winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, worked as an editor for &quot;Adventure&quot;, writing filler paragraphs (brief facts or amusing anecdotes designed to fill small gaps in page layout), advertising copy and a few stories.

==Legacy==
The term &quot;pulp fiction&quot; is often incorrectly used for massmarket paperbacks since the 1950s. The Browne Popular Culture Library News noted:

Many of the paperback houses that contributed to the decline of the genre–Ace, Dell, Avon, among others–were actually started by pulp magazine publishers. They had the presses, the expertise, and the newsstand distribution networks which made the success of the mass-market paperback possible. These pulp-oriented paperback houses mined the old magazines for reprints. This kept pulp literature, if not pulp magazines, alive. &quot;The Return of the Continental Op&quot; reprints material first published in &quot;Black Mask&quot;; &quot;Five Sinister Characters&quot; contains stories first published in &quot;Dime Detective&quot;; and &quot;The Pocket Book of Science Fiction&quot; collects material from &quot;Thrilling Wonder Stories&quot;, &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; and &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;. But note that mass market paperbacks are not pulps.

In 1991, &quot;The Pulpster&quot; debuted at that year&#x27;s Pulpcon, the annual pulp magazine convention that had begun in 1972. The magazine, devoted to the history and legacy of the pulp magazines, has published each year since. It now appears in connection with PulpFest, the summer pulp convention that grew out of and replaced Pulpcon. &quot;The Pulpster&quot; was originally edited by Tony Davis and is currently edited by William Lampkin, who also runs the website ThePulp.Net. Contributors have included Don Hutchison, Robert Sampson, Will Murray, Al Tonik, Nick Carr, Mike Resnick, Hugh B. Cave, Joseph Wrzos, Jessica Amanda Salmonson, Chet Williamson, and many others. 

In 1992, Rich W. Harvey came out with a magazine called &quot;Pulp Adventures&quot; reprinting old classics. It came out regularly until 2001, and then started up again in 2014.

In 1994, Quentin Tarantino directed the film &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;. The working title of the film was &quot;Black Mask&quot;, in homage to the pulp magazine of that name, and it embodied the seedy, violent, often crime-related spirit found in pulp magazines.

In 1997 C. Cazadessus Jr. launched &quot;Pulpdom&quot;, a continuation of his Hugo Award-winning &quot;ERB-dom&quot; which began in 1960. It ran for 75 issues and featured articles about the content and selected fiction from the pulps. It became &quot;Pulpdom Online&quot; in 2013 and continues quarterly publication.

After 2000, several small independent publishers released magazines which published short fiction, either short stories or novel-length presentations, in the tradition of the pulp magazines of the early 20th century. These included &quot;Blood &#x27;N Thunder&quot;, &quot;High Adventure&quot; and a short-lived magazine which revived the title &quot;Argosy&quot;. These specialist publications, printed in limited press runs, were pointedly not printed on the brittle, high-acid wood pulp paper of the old publications and were not mass market publications targeted at a wide audience. In 2004, Lost Continent Library published &quot;Secret of the Amazon Queen&quot; by E.A. Guest, their first contribution to a &quot;New Pulp Era&quot;, featuring the hallmarks of pulp fiction for contemporary mature readers: violence, horror and sex. E.A. Guest was likened to a blend of pulp era icon Talbot Mundy and Stephen King by real-life explorer David Hatcher Childress.

In 2002, the tenth issue of &quot;McSweeney&#x27;s Quarterly&quot; was guest edited by Michael Chabon. Published as &quot;McSweeney&#x27;s Mammoth Treasury of Thrilling Tales&quot;, it is a collection of &quot;pulp fiction&quot; stories written by such current well-known authors as Stephen King, Nick Hornby, Aimee Bender and Dave Eggers. Explaining his vision for the project, Chabon wrote in the introduction, &quot;I think that we have forgotten how much fun reading a short story can be, and I hope that if nothing else, this treasury goes some small distance toward reminding us of that lost but fundamental truth.&quot;

The Scottish publisher DC Thomson publishes &quot;My Weekly Compact Novel&quot; every week. It is literally a pulp novel, though it does not fall into the hard-edged genre most associated with pulp fiction.

From 2006 through 2019, Anthony Tollin&#x27;s imprint Sanctum Books has reprinted all 182 &quot;Doc Savage&quot; pulp novels, all 24 of Paul Ernst&#x27;s &quot;Avenger&quot; novels, the 14 &quot;Whisperer&quot; novels from the original pulp series and all but three novels of the entire run of &quot;The Shadow&quot; (most of his publications featuring two novels in one book).

<doc id="22980" wikidata="Q8183" url="?curid=22980" title="Phoneme">
<text>A phoneme () is any set of similar speech sounds that is perceptually regarded by the speakers of a language as a single basic sound—a smallest possible phonetic unit—that helps distinguish one word from another. All languages contain phonemes (or the spatial-gestural equivalent in sign languages), and all spoken languages include both consonant and vowel phonemes. Phonemes are primarily studied under the branch of linguistics known as phonology.

==Examples and notation==
The English words &quot;cell&quot; and &quot;set&quot; have the exact same sequence of sounds, except for being different in their final consonant sounds: thus, versus in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), a writing system that can be used to represent phonemes. Since and alone distinguish certain words from others, they are each examples of phonemes of the English language. Specifically they are consonant phonemes, along with , while is a vowel phoneme. The spelling of English does not strictly conform to its phonemes, so that the words &quot;knot&quot;, &quot;nut&quot;, and &quot;gnat&quot;, regardless of spelling, all share the consonant phonemes and , differing only by their internal vowel phonemes: , , and , respectively. Similarly, is the notation for a sequence of four phonemes, , , , and , that together constitute the word &quot;pushed&quot;. 

Sounds that are perceived as phonemes vary by languages and dialects, so that and are separate phonemes in English since they distinguish words like &quot;sin&quot; from &quot;sing&quot; ( versus ), yet they comprise a single phoneme in some other languages, such as Spanish, in which and for instance are merely interpreted by Spanish speakers as regional or dialect-specific ways of pronouncing the same word (&quot;pan&quot;: the Spanish word for &quot;bread&quot;). Such spoken variations of a single phoneme are known by linguists as &quot;allophones&quot;. Linguists use slashes in the IPA to transcribe phonemes but square brackets to transcribe more precise pronunciation details, including allophones; they describe this basic distinction as &quot;phonemic&quot; versus &quot;phonetic&quot;. Thus, the pronunciation patterns of &quot;tap&quot; versus &quot;tab&quot;, or &quot;pat&quot; versus &quot;bat&quot;, can be represented phonemically and are written between slashes (including , , etc.), while nuances of exactly how a speaker pronounces are phonetic and written between brackets, like for the &quot;p&quot; in &quot;spit&quot; versus for the &quot;p&quot; in &quot;pit&quot;, which in English is an aspirated allophone of /p/ (i.e., pronounced with an extra burst of air).

There are many views as to exactly what phonemes are and how a given language should be analyzed in phonemic terms. Generally, a phoneme is regarded as an abstraction of a set (or equivalence class) of spoken sound variations that are nevertheless perceived as a single basic unit of sound by the ordinary native speakers of a given language. While phonemes are considered an abstract underlying representation for sound segments within words, the corresponding phonetic realizations of those phonemes—each phoneme with its various allophones—constitute the surface form that is actually uttered and heard. Allophones each have technically different articulations inside particular words or particular environments within words, yet these differences do not create any meaningful distinctions. Alternatively, at least one of those articulations could be feasibly used in all such words with these words still being recognized as such by users of the language. An example in American English is that the sound spelled with the symbol &quot;t&quot; is usually articulated with a glottal stop (or a similar glottalized sound) in the word &quot;cat&quot;, an alveolar flap in &quot;dating&quot;, an alveolar plosive in &quot;stick&quot;, and an aspirated alveolar plosive in &quot;tie&quot;; however, American speakers perceive or &quot;hear&quot; all of these sounds (usually with no conscious effort) as merely being allophones of a single phoneme: the one traditionally represented in the IPA as .

For computer-typing purposes, systems such as X-SAMPA exist to represent IPA symbols using only ASCII characters. However, descriptions of particular languages may use different conventional symbols to represent the phonemes of those languages. For languages whose writing systems employ the phonemic principle, ordinary letters may be used to denote phonemes, although this approach is often imperfect, as pronunciations naturally shift in a language over time, rendering previous spelling systems outdated or no longer closely representative of the sounds of the language (see below).

==Assignment of speech sounds to phonemes==

A phoneme is a sound or a group of different sounds perceived to have the same function by speakers of the language or dialect in question. An example is the English phoneme , which occurs in words such as cat&quot;, kit&quot;, &quot;scat&quot;, &quot;skit&quot;. Although most native speakers do not notice this, in most English dialects, the &quot;c/k&quot; sounds in these words are not identical: in , the sound is aspirated, but in , it is unaspirated. The words, therefore, contain different &quot;speech sounds&quot;, or &quot;phones&quot;, transcribed for the aspirated form and for the unaspirated one. These different sounds are nonetheless considered to belong to the same phoneme, because if a speaker used one instead of the other, the meaning of the word would not change: using the aspirated form in &quot;skill&quot; might sound odd, but the word would still be recognized. By contrast, some other sounds would cause a change in meaning if substituted: for example, substitution of the sound would produce the different word &quot;still&quot;, and that sound must therefore be considered to represent a different phoneme (the phoneme ).

The above shows that in English, and are allophones of a single phoneme . In some languages, however, and are perceived by native speakers as significantly different sounds, and substituting one for the other can change the meaning of a word. In those languages, therefore, the two sounds represent different phonemes. For example, in Icelandic, is the first sound of , meaning &quot;cheerful&quot;, but is the first sound of , meaning &quot;riddles&quot;. Icelandic, therefore, has two separate phonemes and .

===Minimal pairs===
A pair of words like and (above) that differ only in one phone is called a &quot;minimal pair&quot; for the two alternative phones in question (in this case, and ). The existence of minimal pairs is a common test to decide whether two phones represent different phonemes or are allophones of the same phoneme.

To take another example, the minimal pair tip&quot; and dip&quot; illustrates that in English, and belong to separate phonemes, and ; since the words have different meanings, English-speakers must be conscious of the distinction between the two sounds.

Signed languages, such as American Sign Language (ASL), also have minimal pairs, differing only in (exactly) one of the signs&#x27; parameters: handshape, movement, location, palm orientation, and nonmanual signal or marker. A minimal pair may exist in the signed language if the basic sign stays the same, but one of the parameters changes.

However, the absence of minimal pairs for a given pair of phones does not always mean that they belong to the same phoneme: they may be so dissimilar phonetically that it is unlikely for speakers to perceive them as the same sound. For example, English has no minimal pair for the sounds (as in hat&quot;) and (as in &quot;bang), and the fact that they can be shown to be in complementary distribution could be used to argue for their being allophones of the same phoneme. However, they are so dissimilar phonetically that they are considered separate phonemes. A case like this shows that sometimes it is the systemic distinctions and not the lexical context which are decisive in establishing phonemes. This implies that the phoneme should be defined as the smallest phonological unit which is contrastive at a lexical level or distinctive at a systemic level.

Phonologists have sometimes had recourse to &quot;near minimal pairs&quot; to show that speakers of the language perceive two sounds as significantly different even if no exact minimal pair exists in the lexicon. It is challenging to find a minimal pair to distinguish English from , yet it seems uncontroversial to claim that the two consonants are distinct phonemes. The two words &#x27;pressure&#x27; and &#x27;pleasure&#x27; can serve as a near minimal pair. The reason why this is still acceptable proof of phonemehood is that there is nothing about the additional difference (/r/ vs. /l/) that can be expected to somehow condition a voicing difference for a single underlying postalveolar fricative. One can, however, find true minimal pairs for /ʃ/ and /ʒ/ if less common words are considered. For example, &#x27;Confucian&#x27; and &#x27;confusion&#x27; are a valid minimal pair.

==Suprasegmental phonemes==
Besides segmental phonemes such as vowels and consonants, there are also suprasegmental features of pronunciation (such as tone and stress, syllable boundaries and other forms of juncture, nasalization and vowel harmony), which, in many languages, change the meaning of words and so are phonemic.

&quot;Phonemic stress&quot; is encountered in languages such as English. For example, there are two words spelled &quot;invite&quot;, one is a verb and is stressed on the second syllable, the other is a noun and stressed on the first syllable (without changing any of the individual sounds). The position of the stress distinguishes the words and so a full phonemic specification would include indication of the position of the stress: for the verb, for the noun. In other languages, such as French, word stress cannot have this function (its position is generally predictable) and so it is not phonemic (and therefore not usually indicated in dictionaries).

&quot;Phonemic tones&quot; are found in languages such as Mandarin Chinese in which a given syllable can have five different tonal pronunciations:


The tone &quot;phonemes&quot; in such languages are sometimes called &quot;tonemes&quot;. Languages such as English do not have phonemic tone, but they use intonation for functions such as emphasis and attitude.

==Distribution of allophones==
When a phoneme has more than one allophone, the one actually heard at a given occurrence of that phoneme may be dependent on the phonetic environment (surrounding sounds). Allophones that normally cannot appear in the same environment are said to be in complementary distribution. In other cases, the choice of allophone may be dependent on the individual speaker or other unpredictable factors. Such allophones are said to be in free variation, but allophones are still selected in a specific phonetic context, not the other way around.

==Background and related ideas==
The term &quot;phonème&quot; (from , &quot;sound made, utterance, thing spoken, speech, language&quot;) was reportedly first used by A. Dufriche-Desgenettes in 1873, but it referred only to a speech sound. The term &quot;phoneme&quot; as an abstraction was developed by the Polish linguist Jan Baudouin de Courtenay and his student Mikołaj Kruszewski during 1875–1895. The term used by these two was &quot;fonema&quot;, the basic unit of what they called &quot;psychophonetics&quot;. Daniel Jones became the first linguist in the western world to use the term &quot;phoneme&quot; in its current sense, employing the word in his article &quot;The phonetic structure of the Sechuana Language&quot;. The concept of the phoneme was then elaborated in the works of Nikolai Trubetzkoy and others of the Prague School (during the years 1926–1935), and in those of structuralists like Ferdinand de Saussure, Edward Sapir, and Leonard Bloomfield. Some structuralists (though not Sapir) rejected the idea of a cognitive or psycholinguistic function for the phoneme.

Later, it was used and redefined in generative linguistics, most famously by Noam Chomsky and Morris Halle, and remains central to many accounts of the development of modern phonology. As a theoretical concept or model, though, it has been supplemented and even replaced by others.

Some linguists (such as Roman Jakobson and Morris Halle) proposed that phonemes may be further decomposable into features, such features being the true minimal constituents of language. Features overlap each other in time, as do suprasegmental phonemes in oral language and many phonemes in sign languages. Features could be characterized in different ways: Jakobson and colleagues defined them in acoustic terms, Chomsky and Halle used a predominantly articulatory basis, though retaining some acoustic features, while Ladefoged&#x27;s system is a purely articulatory system apart from the use of the acoustic term &#x27;sibilant&#x27;.

In the description of some languages, the term chroneme has been used to indicate contrastive length or &quot;duration&quot; of phonemes. In languages in which tones are phonemic, the tone phonemes may be called tonemes. Though not all scholars working on such languages use these terms, they are by no means obsolete.

By analogy with the phoneme, linguists have proposed other sorts of underlying objects, giving them names with the suffix &quot;-eme&quot;, such as &quot;morpheme&quot; and &quot;grapheme&quot;. These are sometimes called emic units. The latter term was first used by Kenneth Pike, who also generalized the concepts of emic and etic description (from &quot;phonemic&quot; and &quot;phonetic&quot; respectively) to applications outside linguistics.

==Restrictions on occurrence==

Languages do not generally allow words or syllables to be built of any arbitrary sequences of phonemes. There are phonotactic restrictions on which sequences of phonemes are possible and in which environments certain phonemes can occur. Phonemes that are significantly limited by such restrictions may be called &quot;restricted phonemes&quot;.

In English, examples of such restrictions include the following:

* , as in &quot;sing&quot;, occurs only at the end of a syllable, never at the beginning (in many other languages, such as Māori, Swahili, Tagalog, Thai, and Setswana, can appear word-initially).
* occurs only at the beginning of a syllable, never at the end (a few languages, such as Arabic and Romanian, allow syllable-finally).
* In non-rhotic dialects, can occur immediately only before a vowel, never before a consonant.
* and occur only before a vowel, never at the end of a syllable (except in interpretations in which a word like &quot;boy&quot; is analyzed as ).

Some phonotactic restrictions can alternatively be analyzed as cases of neutralization. See Neutralization and archiphonemes below, particularly the example of the occurrence of the three English nasals before stops.

==Biuniqueness==
Biuniqueness is a requirement of classic structuralist phonemics. It means that a given phone, wherever it occurs, must unambiguously be assigned to one and only one phoneme. In other words, the mapping between phones and phonemes is required to be many-to-one rather than many-to-many. The notion of biuniqueness was controversial among some pre-generative linguists and was prominently challenged by Morris Halle and Noam Chomsky in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

An example of the problems arising from the biuniqueness requirement is provided by the phenomenon of flapping in North American English. This may cause either or (in the appropriate environments) to be realized with the phone (an alveolar flap). For example, the same flap sound may be heard in the words &quot;hitting&quot; and &quot;bidding&quot;, although it is intended to realize the phoneme in the first word and in the second. This appears to contradict biuniqueness.

For further discussion of such cases, see the next section.

==Neutralization and archiphonemes==

Phonemes that are contrastive in certain environments may not be contrastive in all environments. In the environments where they do not contrast, the contrast is said to be neutralized. In these positions it may become less clear which phoneme a given phone represents. Absolute neutralization is a phenomenon in which a segment of the underlying representation is not realized in any of its phonetic representations (surface forms). The term was introduced by Paul Kiparsky (1968), and contrasts with contextual neutralization where some phonemes are not contrastive in certain environments. Some phonologists prefer not to specify a unique phoneme in such cases, since to do so would mean providing redundant or even arbitrary information – instead they use the technique of underspecification. An archiphoneme is an object sometimes used to represent an underspecified phoneme.

An example of neutralization is provided by the Russian vowels and . These phonemes are contrasting in stressed syllables, but in unstressed syllables the contrast is lost, since both are reduced to the same sound, usually (for details, see vowel reduction in Russian). In order to assign such an instance of to one of the phonemes and , it is necessary to consider morphological factors (such as which of the vowels occurs in other forms of the words, or which inflectional pattern is followed). In some cases even this may not provide an unambiguous answer. A description using the approach of underspecification would not attempt to assign to a specific phoneme in some or all of these cases, although it might be assigned to an archiphoneme, written something like , which reflects the two neutralized phonemes in this position, or , reflecting its unmerged values.

A somewhat different example is found in English, with the three nasal phonemes . In word-final position these all contrast, as shown by the minimal triplet &quot;sum&quot; , &quot;sun&quot; , &quot;sung&quot; . However, before a stop such as (provided there is no morpheme boundary between them), only one of the nasals is possible in any given position: before , before or , and before , as in &quot;limp, lint, link&quot; (, , ). The nasals are therefore not contrastive in these environments, and according to some theorists this makes it inappropriate to assign the nasal phones heard here to any one of the phonemes (even though, in this case, the phonetic evidence is unambiguous). Instead they may analyze these phonemes as belonging to a single archiphoneme, written something like , and state the underlying representations of &quot;limp, lint, link&quot; to be , , .

This latter type of analysis is often associated with Nikolai Trubetzkoy of the Prague school. Archiphonemes are often notated with a capital letter within double virgules or pipes, as with the examples and given above. Other ways the second of these has been notated include , and .

Another example from English, but this time involving complete phonetic convergence as in the Russian example, is the flapping of and in some American English (described above under Biuniqueness). Here the words &quot;betting&quot; and &quot;bedding&quot; might both be pronounced . Under the generative grammar theory of linguistics, if a speaker applies such flapping consistently, morphological evidence (the pronunciation of the related forms &quot;bet&quot; and &quot;bed&quot;, for example) would reveal which phoneme the flap represents, once it is known which morpheme is being used. However, other theorists would prefer not to make such a determination, and simply assign the flap in both cases to a single archiphoneme, written (for example) .

Further mergers in English are plosives after , where conflate with , as suggested by the alternative spellings &quot;&quot; and &quot;sghetti&quot;. That is, there is no particular reason to transcribe &quot;spin&quot; as rather than as , other than its historical development, and it might be less ambiguously transcribed .

==Morphophonemes==

A morphophoneme is a theoretical unit at a deeper level of abstraction than traditional phonemes, and is taken to be a unit from which morphemes are built up. A morphophoneme within a morpheme can be expressed in different ways in different allomorphs of that morpheme (according to morphophonological rules). For example, the English plural morpheme &quot;-s&quot; appearing in words such as &quot;cats&quot; and &quot;dogs&quot; can be considered to be a single morphophoneme, which might be transcribed (for example) or , and which is realized phonemically as after most voiceless consonants (as in &quot;cats) and as in other cases (as in &quot;dogs).

==Numbers of phonemes in different languages==
All known languages use only a small subset of the many possible sounds that the human speech organs can produce, and, because of allophony, the number of distinct phonemes will generally be smaller than the number of identifiably different sounds. Different languages vary considerably in the number of phonemes they have in their systems (although apparent variation may sometimes result from the different approaches taken by the linguists doing the analysis). The total phonemic inventory in languages varies from as few as 9–11 in Pirahã and 11 in Rotokas to as many as 141 in ǃXũ.

The number of phonemically distinct vowels can be as low as two, as in Ubykh and Arrernte. At the other extreme, the Bantu language Ngwe has 14 vowel qualities, 12 of which may occur long or short, making 26 oral vowels, plus six nasalized vowels, long and short, making a total of 38 vowels; while !Xóõ achieves 31 pure vowels, not counting its additional variation by vowel length, by varying the phonation. As regards consonant phonemes, Puinave and the Papuan language Tauade each have just seven, and Rotokas has only six. !Xóõ, on the other hand, has somewhere around 77, and Ubykh 81. The English language uses a rather large set of 13 to 21 vowel phonemes, including diphthongs, although its 22 to 26 consonants are close to average. Across all languages, the average number of consonant phonemes per language is about 22, while the average number of vowel phonemes is about 8.

Some languages, such as French, have no phonemic tone or stress, while Cantonese and several of the Kam–Sui languages have six to nine tones (depending on how they are counted), and the Kam-Sui Dong language has nine to 15 tones by the same measure. One of the Kru languages, Wobé, has been claimed to have 14, though this is disputed.
The most common vowel system consists of the five vowels . The most common consonants are . Relatively few languages lack any of these consonants, although it does happen: for example, Arabic lacks , standard Hawaiian lacks , Mohawk and Tlingit lack and , Hupa lacks both and a simple , colloquial Samoan lacks and , while Rotokas and Quileute lack and .

==The non-uniqueness of phonemic solutions==
During the development of phoneme theory in the mid-20th century, phonologists were concerned not only with the procedures and principles involved in producing a phonemic analysis of the sounds of a given language, but also with the reality or uniqueness of the phonemic solution. These were central concerns of phonology. Some writers took the position expressed by Kenneth Pike: &quot;There is only one accurate phonemic analysis for a given set of data&quot;, while others believed that different analyses, equally valid, could be made for the same data. Yuen Ren Chao (1934), in his article &quot;The non-uniqueness of phonemic solutions of phonetic systems&quot; stated &quot;given the sounds of a language, there are usually more than one possible way of reducing them to a set of phonemes, and these different systems or solutions are not simply correct or incorrect, but may be regarded only as being good or bad for various purposes&quot;. The linguist F. W. Householder referred to this argument within linguistics as &quot;God&#x27;s Truth&quot; (i.e. the stance that a given language has an intrinsic structure to be discovered) vs. &quot;hocus-pocus&quot; (i.e. the stance that any proposed, coherent structure is as good as any other).

Different analyses of the English vowel system may be used to illustrate this. The article English phonology states that &quot;English has a particularly large number of vowel phonemes&quot; and that &quot;there are 20 vowel phonemes in Received Pronunciation, 14–16 in General American and 20–21 in Australian English&quot;. Although these figures are often quoted as fact, they actually reflect just one of many possible analyses, and later in the English Phonology article an alternative analysis is suggested in which some diphthongs and long vowels may be interpreted as comprising a short vowel linked to either or . The fullest exposition of this approach is found in Trager and Smith (1951), where all long vowels and diphthongs (&quot;complex nuclei&quot;) are made up of a short vowel combined with either , or (plus for rhotic accents), each comprising two phonemes. The transcription for the vowel normally transcribed would instead be , would be and would be , or /ar/ in a rhotic accent if there is an in the spelling. It is also possible to treat English long vowels and diphthongs as combinations of two vowel phonemes, with long vowels treated as a sequence of two short vowels, so that &#x27;palm&#x27; would be represented as /paam/. English can thus be said to have around seven vowel phonemes, or even six if schwa were treated as an allophone of or of other short vowels.

In the same period there was disagreement about the correct basis for a phonemic analysis. The structuralist position was that the analysis should be made purely on the basis of the sound elements and their distribution, with no reference to extraneous factors such as grammar, morphology or the intuitions of the native speaker; this position is strongly associated with Leonard Bloomfield. Zellig Harris claimed that it is possible to discover the phonemes of a language purely by examining the distribution of phonetic segments. Referring to mentalistic definitions of the phoneme, Twaddell (1935) stated &quot;Such a definition is invalid because (1) we have no right to guess about the linguistic workings of an inaccessible &#x27;mind&#x27;, and (2) we can secure no advantage from such guesses. The linguistic processes of the &#x27;mind&#x27; as such are quite simply unobservable; and introspection about linguistic processes is notoriously a fire in a wooden stove.&quot; This approach was opposed to that of Edward Sapir, who gave an important role to native speakers&#x27; intuitions about where a particular sound or group of sounds fitted into a pattern. Using English as an example, Sapir argued that, despite the superficial appearance that this sound belongs to a group of three nasal consonant phonemes (/m/, /n/ and /ŋ/), native speakers feel that the velar nasal is really the sequence [ŋɡ]/. The theory of generative phonology which emerged in the 1960s explicitly rejected the structuralist approach to phonology and favoured the mentalistic or cognitive view of Sapir.

These topics are discussed further in English phonology#Controversial issues.

==Correspondence between letters and phonemes==

Phonemes are considered to be the basis for alphabetic writing systems. In such systems the written symbols (graphemes) represent, in principle, the phonemes of the language being written. This is most obviously the case when the alphabet was invented with a particular language in mind; for example, the Latin alphabet was devised for Classical Latin, and therefore the Latin of that period enjoyed a near one-to-one correspondence between phonemes and graphemes in most cases, though the devisers of the alphabet chose not to represent the phonemic effect of vowel length. However, because changes in the spoken language are often not accompanied by changes in the established orthography (as well as other reasons, including dialect differences, the effects of morphophonology on orthography, and the use of foreign spellings for some loanwords), the correspondence between spelling and pronunciation in a given language may be highly distorted; this is the case with English, for example.

The correspondence between symbols and phonemes in alphabetic writing systems is not necessarily a one-to-one correspondence. A phoneme might be represented by a combination of two or more letters (digraph, trigraph, ), like in English or in German (both representing the phoneme ). Also a single letter may represent two phonemes, as in English representing or . There may also exist spelling/pronunciation rules (such as those for the pronunciation of in Italian) that further complicate the correspondence of letters to phonemes, although they need not affect the ability to predict the pronunciation from the spelling and vice versa, provided the rules are consistent.

==In sign languages==
Sign language phonemes are bundles of articulation features. Stokoe was the first scholar to describe the phonemic system of ASL. He identified the bundles &quot;tab&quot; (elements of location, from Latin &quot;tabula&quot;), &quot;dez&quot; (the handshape, from &quot;designator&quot;), and &quot;sig&quot; (the motion, from &quot;signation&quot;). Some researchers also discern &quot;ori&quot; (orientation), facial expression or mouthing. Just as with spoken languages, when features are combined, they create phonemes. As in spoken languages, sign languages have minimal pairs which differ in only one phoneme. For instance, the ASL signs for &quot;father&quot; and &quot;mother&quot; differ minimally with respect to location while handshape and movement are identical; location is thus contrastive.

Stokoe&#x27;s terminology and notation system are no longer used by researchers to describe the phonemes of sign languages; William Stokoe&#x27;s research, while still considered seminal, has been found not to characterize American Sign Language or other sign languages sufficiently. For instance, non-manual features are not included in Stokoe&#x27;s classification. More sophisticated models of sign language phonology have since been proposed by Brentari, Sandler, and Van der Kooij.

===Chereme===

Cherology and chereme (from &quot;hand&quot;) are synonyms of phonology and phoneme previously used in the study of sign languages. A &quot;chereme&quot;, as the basic unit of signed communication, is functionally and psychologically equivalent to the phonemes of oral languages, and has been replaced by that term in the academic literature. &quot;Cherology&quot;, as the study of &quot;cheremes&quot; in language, is thus equivalent to phonology. The terms are not in use anymore. Instead, the terms &quot;phonology&quot; and &quot;phoneme&quot; (or &quot;distinctive feature&quot;) are used to stress the linguistic similarities between signed and spoken languages.

The terms were coined in 1960 by William Stokoe at Gallaudet University to describe sign languages as true and full languages. Once a controversial idea, the position is now universally accepted in linguistics. Stokoe&#x27;s terminology, however, has been largely abandoned.

<text>In phonetics (a branch of linguistics), a phone is any distinct [[speech]] [[sound]]. It is any surface-level or unanalyzed sound of a language, a smallest identifiable unit occurring inside a stream of speech. In spoken human language, a phone is thus any vowel or consonant sound (or semivowel sound). In sign language, a phone is the equivalent as a unit of gesture. 

==Phones versus phonemes==
Phones are the segments of speech that possesses distinct physical or perceptual properties, regardless of whether the exact sound is critical to the meanings of words. Whereas a phone is a concrete sound used across various spoken languages, a phoneme is more abstract and narrowly defined: any class of phones that the users of a particular language nevertheless &quot;perceive&quot; as a single basic sound, a single unit, and that distinguishes words from other words. If a phoneme is swapped with another phoneme inside a word, it can change the meaning of that word, potentially changing that word into another word (or into nonsense). 

For instance, the phone in the English word &quot;hick&quot;, a word transcribed as in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), distinguishes it from other words, like &quot;hit&quot;, &quot;hip,&quot; &quot;hiss&quot;, &quot;hitch&quot;, etc., suggesting that belongs to a phoneme in English. The English words &quot;kid&quot; and &quot;kit&quot;, and in the IPA, end with two distinct sounds (phones), and , and swapping one for the other makes the one word sound like the other. Thus, in the English language, these particular phones are classifiable under two separate phonemes, transcribed as versus (slashes indicate phonemes in the IPA, while square brackets indicate phones). However, the difference between the sound in some dialects&#x27; pronunciation of &quot;sheet&quot; and the in &quot;shack&quot; ( versus in the IPA) never affects the meaning or identity of a word in English. Even if those particular phones are interchanged, those two words would still likely be recognized as &quot;sheet&quot; and &quot;shack&quot; by native English speakers. Therefore, the phones and do not belong to two separate phonemes in English; rather, they could be classified as two possible phonetic variations (called &quot;allophones&quot;) of the same phoneme. In contrast, languages other than English, such as some Slavic languages like Polish or Russian, may indeed perceive and as separate phonemes.

As another example, swapping the sounds and in the English word &quot;spin&quot; does not change its meaning. However, in Hindustani (Hindi and Urdu), swapping these phones can change one word into another: for instance, (/) means &#x27;fruit&#x27;, and (/) means &#x27;moment&#x27;. The sounds and are thus different phonemes in Hindustani but are not usually considered distinct phonemes in English.

== Connection to orthography ==
Whether a direct mapping between phonemes and characters is achieved depends on the type of orthography used. Phonological orthographies like the Indonesian orthography tend to have one-to-one mappings of phonemes to characters, whereas alphabetic orthographies like the English orthography tend to try to have direct mappings, but often end up mapping one phoneme to multiple characters.

In the examples above the characters enclosed in square brackets: &quot;pʰ&quot; and &quot;p&quot; are IPA representations of phones. The IPA unlike English and Indonesian is not a practical orthography and is used by linguists to obtain phonetic transcriptions of words in spoken languages and is therefore a strongly phonetically spelled system by design.
