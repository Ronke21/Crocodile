<text>Ötzi, also called The Iceman, is the natural mummy of a man who lived between 3350 and 3105 BC. Ötzi&#x27;s remains were discovered on 19 September 1991, in the Ötztal Alps (hence the nickname &quot;Ötzi&quot;, ) at the Austria–Italy border. He is Europe&#x27;s oldest known natural human mummy, offering an unprecedented view of Chalcolithic (Copper Age) Europeans.

Because of the presence of an arrowhead embedded in his left shoulder and various other wounds, researchers believe that Ötzi was killed by another person. The nature of his life and the circumstances of his death are the subject of much investigation and speculation. His remains and personal belongings are on exhibit at the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology in Bolzano, South Tyrol, Italy.

==Discovery==
Ötzi was found on 19 September 1991 by two German tourists, at an elevation of on the east ridge of the Fineilspitze in the Ötztal Alps on the Austrian–Italian border, near Similaun mountain and the Tisenjoch pass. When the tourists, Helmut and Erika Simon, first saw the body, they both believed that they had happened upon a recently deceased mountaineer. The next day, a mountain gendarme and the keeper of the nearby Similaunhütte first attempted to remove the body, which was frozen in ice below the torso, using a pneumatic drill and ice axes, but bad weather forced them to give up. Within a short time, eight groups visited the site, among whom were mountaineers Hans Kammerlander and Reinhold Messner.

The body was extracted on 22 September and salvaged the following day. It was transported to the office of the medical examiner in Innsbruck, together with other objects found nearby. On 24 September, the find was examined there by archaeologist Konrad Spindler of the University of Innsbruck. He dated the find to be &quot;at least four thousand years old&quot; on the basis of the typology of an axe among the retrieved objects. Tissue samples from the corpse and other accompanying materials were later analyzed at several scientific institutions and their results unequivocally concluded that the remains belonged to someone who had lived between 3359 and 3105 BC, or some 5,000 years ago. More specific estimates find that there was a 66% chance he died between 3239 and 3105 BC, a 33% chance he died between 3359 and 3294 BC, and a 1% chance he died between 3277 and 3268 BC.

=== Border dispute ===
At the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye of 1919, the border between North and South Tyrol was defined as the watershed of the rivers Inn and Etsch. Near Tisenjoch, the glacier (which has since retreated) complicated establishing the watershed and the border was drawn too far north. Although Ötzi&#x27;s find site drains to the Austrian side, land surveys in October 1991 ultimately proved that the body had been located inside Italian territory, which was in consonance with Italy&#x27;s original 1919 ownership claim.
The province of South Tyrol claimed property rights but agreed to let Innsbruck University finish its scientific examinations. Since 1998, he has been on display at the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology in Bolzano, the capital of South Tyrol.

==Scientific analyses==
The corpse has been extensively examined, measured, X-rayed, and dated. Tissues and intestinal contents have been examined microscopically, as have the items found with the body. In August 2004, frozen bodies of three Austro-Hungarian soldiers killed during the Battle of San Matteo (1918) were found on the mountain Punta San Matteo in Trentino. One body was sent to a museum in the hope that research on how the environment had affected its preservation would help unravel Ötzi&#x27;s past.

===Body===

By the most recent estimates, at the time of his death, Ötzi was tall, weighed about , and was about 45 years of age. When his body was found, it weighed . Because the body was covered in ice shortly after his death, it had only partially deteriorated. Initial reports claimed that his penis and most of his scrotum were missing, but this was later shown to be unfounded. Analysis of pollen, dust grains and the isotopic composition of his tooth enamel indicates that he spent his childhood near the present South Tyrol village of Feldthurns, north of Bolzano, but later went to live in valleys about farther north.
In 2009, a CAT scan revealed that the stomach had shifted upward to where his lower lung area would normally be. Analysis of the contents revealed the partly digested remains of ibex meat, confirmed by DNA analysis, suggesting he had had a meal less than two hours before his death. Wheat grains were also found. It is believed that Ötzi most likely had a few slices of a dried, fatty meat, which came from a wild goat in South Tyrol, Italy. Analysis of Ötzi&#x27;s intestinal contents showed two meals (the last one consumed about eight hours before his death), one of chamois meat, the other of red deer and herb bread; both were eaten with roots and fruits. The grain also eaten with both meals was a highly processed einkorn wheat bran, quite possibly eaten in the form of bread. In the proximity of the body, and thus possibly originating from the Iceman&#x27;s provisions, chaff and grains of einkorn and barley, and seeds of flax and poppy were discovered, as well as kernels of sloes (small plum-like fruits of the blackthorn tree) and various seeds of berries growing in the wild.

Hair analysis was used to examine his diet from several months before. Pollen in the first meal showed that it had been consumed in a mid-altitude conifer forest, and other pollens indicated the presence of wheat and legumes, which may have been domesticated crops. Pollen grains of hop-hornbeam were also discovered. The pollen was very well preserved, with the cells inside remaining intact, indicating that it had been fresh (estimated about two hours old) at the time of Ötzi&#x27;s death, which places the event in the spring or early summer. Einkorn wheat is harvested in the late summer, and sloes in the autumn; these must have been stored from the previous year.

High levels of both copper particles and arsenic were found in Ötzi&#x27;s hair. This, along with Ötzi&#x27;s copper axe blade, which is 99.7% pure copper, has led scientists to speculate that Ötzi was involved in copper smelting.

By examination of the proportions of Ötzi&#x27;s tibia, femur and pelvis, it was postulated that Ötzi&#x27;s lifestyle included long walks over hilly terrain. This degree of mobility is not characteristic of other Copper Age Europeans. This may indicate that Ötzi was a high-altitude shepherd.

Using modern 3D scanning technology, a facial reconstruction has been created for the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology in Bolzano, Italy. It shows Ötzi looking old for his 45 years, with deep-set brown eyes, a beard, a furrowed face, and sunken cheeks. He is depicted as looking tired and ungroomed.

===Health===
Ötzi apparently had &quot;Trichuris trichiura&quot; (whipworm), an intestinal parasite. During CT scans, it was observed that three or four of his right ribs had been cracked when he had been lying face down after death, or where the ice had crushed his body. One of his fingernails (of the two found) shows three Beau&#x27;s lines, indicating he was sick three times in the six months before he died. The last incident, two months before he died, lasted about two weeks. It was also found that his epidermis, the outer skin layer, was missing, a natural process from his mummification in ice. Ötzi&#x27;s teeth showed considerable internal deterioration from cavities. These oral pathologies may have been brought about by his grain-heavy, high-carbohydrate diet. DNA analysis in February 2012 revealed that Ötzi was lactose intolerant, supporting the theory that lactose intolerance was still common at that time, despite the increasing spread of agriculture and dairying. Ötzi&#x27;s lungs were examined endoscopically and were found to be blackened by soot, probably due to his frequent proximity to open fires for warmth and cooking.

===Skeletal details and tattooing===
Ötzi had a total of 61 tattoos, consisting of 19 groups of black lines ranging from in width and in length. These include groups of parallel lines running along the longitudinal axis of his body and to both sides of the lumbar spine, as well as a cruciform mark behind the right knee and on the right ankle, and parallel lines around the left wrist. The greatest concentration of markings is found on his legs, which together exhibit 12 groups of lines. A microscopic examination of samples collected from these tattoos revealed that they were created from pigment manufactured out of fireplace ash or soot. This pigment was then rubbed into small linear incisions or punctures. It has been suggested that Ötzi was repeatedly tattooed in the same locations, since the majority of them are quite dark.

Radiological examination of Ötzi&#x27;s bones showed &quot;age-conditioned or strain-induced degeneration&quot; corresponding to many tattooed areas, including osteochondrosis and slight spondylosis in the lumbar spine and wear-and-tear degeneration in the knee and especially in the ankle joints. It has been speculated that these tattoos may have been part of pain relief treatments similar to acupressure or acupuncture, though Ötzi lived at least 2,000 years before their previously known earliest use in China ( 1000 BC). For example, 9 of the 19 groups of his tattoos are located next to, or directly on, acupunctural areas used today, and most of the others are on meridians and other acupunctural regions of the body and over arthritic joints. Ötzi&#x27;s abdominal tattoos may have assuaged the intestinal pain of whipworm, which he is thought to have had.

At one point, it was thought that Ötzi was the oldest tattooed human mummy yet discovered. In 2018, however, tattoos were discovered on nearly contemporaneous Egyptian mummies.

Many of Ötzi&#x27;s tattoos originally went unnoticed, since they are difficult to see with the naked eye. In 2015, researchers photographed the body using noninvasive multispectral techniques to capture images on different light wavelengths that are imperceptible by humans, revealing the remainder of his tattoos.

===Clothes and shoes===
Ötzi wore a cloak made of woven grass and a coat, a belt, a pair of leggings, a loincloth, and shoes, all made of leather of different skins. He also wore a bearskin cap with a leather chin strap. The shoes were waterproof and wide, seemingly designed for walking across the snow; they were constructed using bearskin for the soles, deer hide for the top panels, and a netting made of tree bark. Soft grass went around the foot and in the shoe and functioned like modern socks. The coat, belt, leggings and loincloth were constructed of vertical strips of leather sewn together with sinew. His belt had a pouch sewn to it that contained a cache of useful items: a scraper, a drill, a flint flake, a bone awl and a dried fungus (see #Tools and equipment below).
The shoes have since been reproduced by a Czech academic, who said that &quot;because the shoes are actually quite complex, I&#x27;m convinced that even 5,300 years ago, people had the equivalent of a cobbler who made shoes for other people&quot;. The reproductions were found to constitute such excellent footwear that it was reported that a Czech company offered to purchase the rights to sell them. However, a more recent hypothesis by British archaeologist Jacqui Wood is that Ötzi&#x27;s shoes were actually the upper part of snowshoes. According to this theory, the item currently interpreted as part of a backpack is actually the wood frame and netting of one snowshoe and animal hide to cover the face.

The leather loincloth and hide coat were made from sheepskin. Genetic analysis showed that the sheep species was nearer to modern domestic European sheep than to wild sheep; the items were made from the skins of at least four animals. Part of the coat was made from a domesticated goat belonging to a mitochondrial haplogroup (a common female ancestor) that inhabits central Europe today. The coat was made from several animals from two different species and was stitched together using hides. The leggings were made from domesticated goat leather. A similar set of 5,000-year-old leggings discovered in Schnidejoch, Switzerland, were made from goat leather as well.

Irish and Italian researchers were able to undertake an analysis of the mitochondrial DNA from six different items of the body&#x27;s clothing and published their findings in the journal Scientific Reports. These showed that the shoelaces were made from the European genetic population of cattle. The quiver was made from wild roe deer, the fur hat was made from a genetic lineage of brown bear which lives in the region today.

===Tools and equipment===
Other items found with the Iceman were a copper axe with a yew handle, a chert-bladed knife with an ash handle and a quiver of 14 arrows with viburnum and dogwood shafts. Two of the arrows, which were broken, were tipped with flint and had fletching (stabilizing fins), while the other 12 were unfinished and untipped. The arrows were found in a quiver with what is presumed to be a bow string, an unidentified tool, and an antler tool which might have been used for sharpening arrow points. There was also an unfinished yew longbow that was long.

In addition, among Ötzi&#x27;s possessions were berries, two birch bark baskets, and two species of polypore mushrooms with leather strings through them. One of these, the birch fungus, is known to have anthelmintic properties, and was probably used for medicinal purposes. The other was a type of tinder fungus, included with part of what appeared to be a complex firelighting kit. The kit featured pieces of over a dozen different plants, in addition to flint and pyrite for creating sparks.

Ötzi&#x27;s copper axe was of particular interest. His axe&#x27;s haft is long and made from carefully worked yew with a right-angled crook at the shoulder, leading to the blade. The axe head is made of almost pure copper. It was produced through casting and did not undergo mechanical hardening. Despite the fact that copper ore sources in the Alpines are known to have been exploited at the time, a 2017 study indicated that the copper in the axe came from southern Tuscany. It was let into the forked end of the crook and fixed there using birch-tar and tight leather lashing. The blade part of the head extends out of the lashing and shows clear signs of having been used to chop and cut. At the time, such an axe would have been a valuable possession, important both as a tool and as a status symbol for the bearer.

===Genetic analysis===
Ötzi&#x27;s full genome was first sequenced in 2012; a new, high-coverage genome with much less modern human contamination was published in 2023.

According to the 2012 study, the Y chromosome DNA of Ötzi belongs to a subclade of G defined by the SNPs M201, P287, P15, L223 and L91 (G-L91, ISOGG G2a2b, former &quot;G2a4&quot;). He was not typed for any of the subclades downstreaming from G-L91; however, an analysis of his Binary Alignment Map file revealed that he belongs to the L166 and FGC5672 subclades below L91. G-L91 is now mostly found in South Corsica. Analysis of his mitochondrial DNA showed that Ötzi belongs to the K1 subclade, but cannot be categorized into any of the three modern branches of that subclade (K1a, K1b, or K1c). The new subclade has provisionally been named &quot;K1ö&quot; for &quot;Ötzi&quot;. A multiplex assay study was able to confirm that the Iceman&#x27;s mtDNA belongs to a previously unknown European mtDNA clade with a very limited distribution among modern data sets. By autosomal DNA, Ötzi is most closely related to Southern Europeans, especially to geographically isolated populations like Corsicans and Sardinians. Ötzi traced the majority of his ancestry to the Neolithic early European farmers who migrated from Anatolia to Europe beginning during the 7th millennium BC, replacing earlier European hunter-gatherers as dominant population. DNA analysis also showed him at high risk of atherosclerosis and lactose intolerance, with the presence of the DNA sequence of &quot;Borrelia burgdorferi&quot;, possibly making him the earliest known human with Lyme disease. A later analysis suggested the sequence may have been a different &quot;Borrelia&quot; species.

The 2023 study on Ötzi&#x27;s genome found a very high proportion (90%) of Anatolian farmer-related ancestry – in fact, the highest among European populations of the same time—with a lesser contribution from European hunter-gatherer-related ancestry, but (in contrast to the 2012 research) no evidence of Steppe-related ancestry, the disagreement with previous results being attributed to modern human contamination. 
While the absence in Ötzi&#x27;s genome of genetic components from Western Steppe Herders (WSH) is not surprising because these &quot;Proto-Indo-European&quot; populations did not arrive in Europe until about 2900 BC, the unusually low contribution from the Western Hunter Gatherers was explained by positing that the genetic mixing between neolithic farmers originating from Anatolia and WHG was still an ongoing process. Also, examining the genetic sites involved in phenotypical traits, the authors concluded that the Iceman, among other things, had likely darker skin than present-day Europeans, but not as dark as the Mesolithic Western Hunter-Gatherers, was likely affected by baldness, and may have suffered from obesity-related metabolic disorders. The article also leaves room for environmental factors as indicative of their darker skin complexion, so more studies will be necessary in the future.

In October 2013, it was reported that 19 modern Tyrolean men belong to the same paternal lineage (Y-DNA haplogroup G-L91) as Ötzi, and may share a common ancestor with Ötzi, and/or descend from close relatives of Ötzi. Scientists from the Institute of Legal Medicine at Innsbruck Medical University had analysed the DNA of over 3,700 Tyrolean male blood donors and found 19 (c. 0.5%) who shared the same paternal haplogroup with the 5,300-year-old man.

===Blood===
In May 2012, scientists announced the discovery that Ötzi still had intact blood cells. These are the oldest complete human blood cells ever identified. In most bodies this old, the blood cells are either shrunken or mere remnants, but Ötzi&#x27;s have the same dimensions as living red blood cells and resemble a modern-day sample.

===&quot;H. pylori&quot; analysis===
In 2016, researchers reported on a study from the extraction of twelve samples from the gastrointestinal tract of Ötzi to analyze the origins of the &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; in his gut. The &quot;H. pylori&quot; strain found in his gastrointestinal tract was, surprisingly, the hpAsia2 strain, a strain today found primarily in South Asian and Central Asian populations, with extremely rare occurrences in modern European populations. The strain found in Ötzi&#x27;s gut is most similar to three modern individuals from Northern India; the strain itself is, of course, older than the modern Northern Indian strain.

=== Stomach ===
Ötzi&#x27;s stomach was completely full and its contents were mostly undigested. In 2018, researchers performed a thorough analysis of his stomach and intestines to gain insights on Chalcolithic meal composition and dietary habits. Biopsies were performed on the stomach to obtain dietary information in the time leading up to his death, and the contents themselves were also analyzed. Previously, Ötzi was believed to be vegetarian, but during this study, it was revealed that his diet was omnivorous. The presence of certain compounds suggests what kinds of food he generally ate, such as gamma-terpinene, implying the intake of herbs, and several nutritious minerals indicating red meat or dairy consumption. Through analysis of DNA and protein traces, the researchers were able to identify the contents of Ötzi&#x27;s last meal, composed of fat and meat from ibex and red deer as well as einkorn wheat. The results of atomic force microscopy and Raman spectroscopy analysis reveal that he consumed fresh or dried wild meat. A previous study detected charcoal particles in his lower intestine, which indicate that fire was present during some part of the food preparation process, but it was likely used in drying out the meat or smoking it.
===After death===
Analysis shows that the tissues had converted to adipocere, a mixture of fatty acids, before desiccation.
Rather than ice, the body had been in water for months over several seasons.

==Cause of death==

The cause of death remained uncertain until 10 years after the discovery of the body. It was initially believed that Ötzi died from exposure during a winter storm. Later it was speculated that he may have been a victim of a ritual sacrifice, perhaps for being a chieftain. This explanation was inspired by theories previously advanced for the bodies recovered from peat bogs such as the Tollund Man and the Lindow Man.

=== Arrowhead and blood analyses ===
In 2001, X-rays and a CT scan revealed that Ötzi had an arrowhead lodged in his left shoulder when he died and a matching small tear on his coat. The discovery of the arrowhead prompted researchers to theorize Ötzi died of blood loss from the wound, which would probably have been fatal even if modern medical techniques had been available. Further research found that the arrow&#x27;s shaft had been removed before death, and close examination of the body found bruises and cuts to the hands, wrists and chest and cerebral trauma indicative of a blow to the head. One of the cuts, to the base of his thumb, reached down to the bone but had no time to heal before his death. Currently, it is believed that Ötzi bled to death after the arrow shattered the scapula and damaged nerves and blood vessels before lodging near the lung.

DNA analyses taken in 2003 are claimed to have revealed traces of blood from at least four other people on his gear: one from his knife, two from a single arrowhead in his quiver, and a fourth from his coat. Interpretations of these findings are that Ötzi killed two people with the same arrow and was able to retrieve it on both occasions, and the blood on his coat was from a wounded comrade he may have carried over his back. Ötzi&#x27;s posture in death (frozen body, face down, left arm bent across the chest) could support a hypothesis that, before death occurred and rigor mortis set in, the Iceman was turned onto his belly in the effort to remove the arrow shaft. &quot;The Cambridge World History of Violence&quot; (2020) cited Ötzi as evidence of prehistoric warfare.

==== Alternative theory of death location ====
Most research has assumed that Ötzi died at roughly the spot where he was found. In 2010, it was proposed that Ötzi died at a much lower altitude and was buried higher in the mountains, as posited by archaeologist Alessandro Vanzetti of the Sapienza University of Rome and his colleagues. According to their study of the items found near Ötzi and their locations, the iceman may have been placed above what has been interpreted as a stone burial mound, but his body subsequently moved with each thaw cycle that created a flowing watery mixture driven by gravity before being re-frozen. While archaeobotanist Klaus Oeggl of the University of Innsbruck agrees that the natural process described probably caused the body to move from the ridge that includes the stone formation, he pointed out that the paper provided no compelling evidence to demonstrate that the scattered stones constituted a burial platform. Moreover, biological anthropologist Albert Zink argues that the iceman&#x27;s bones display no dislocations that would have resulted from a downhill slide and that the intact blood clots in his arrow wound would show damage if the body had been moved up the mountain. In either case, the burial theory does not contradict the likelihood of a violent cause of death.

==Legal dispute==

Italian law entitled the Simons to a finders&#x27; fee from the South Tyrolean provincial government of 25% of the value of Ötzi. In 1994 the authorities offered a &quot;symbolic&quot; reward of lire10 million (€5,200), which the Simons declined. In 2003, the Simons filed a lawsuit which asked a court in Bolzano to recognize their role in Ötzi&#x27;s discovery and declare them his &quot;official discoverers&quot;. The court decided in the Simons&#x27; favour in November 2003, and at the end of December that year the Simons announced that they were seeking US$300,000 as their fee. The provincial government decided to appeal.

In addition, two people came forward, each with a claim of being part of the same mountaineering party that had come across Ötzi and of discovering the body first:
* Magdalena Mohar Jarc, a retired Slovenian climber, who alleged that she discovered the corpse first after falling into a crevice, and, shortly after returning to a mountain hut, asked Helmut Simon to take photographs of Ötzi. She cited Reinhold Messner, who was also present in the mountain hut, as the witness to this.
* Sandra Nemeth, from Switzerland, who contended that she had found the corpse before Helmut and Erika Simon and spat on it to make sure that her DNA would be found there later. She asked for a DNA test on the remains, but experts believed that there was little chance of finding any trace.

In 2005, the rival claims were heard by a Bolzano court. The legal case angered Mrs. Simon, who alleged that neither woman was present on the mountain that day. In 2005, Mrs. Simon&#x27;s lawyer said: &quot;Mrs. Simon is very upset by all this and by the fact that these two new claimants have decided to appear 14 years after Ötzi was found.&quot; In 2008, however, Jarc stated for a Slovene newspaper that she had written twice to the Bolzano court in regard to her claim but received no reply whatsoever.

In 2004, Helmut Simon died. Two years later, in June 2006, an appeals court affirmed that the Simons had indeed discovered the Iceman and were therefore entitled to a finder&#x27;s fee. It also ruled that the provincial government had to pay the Simons&#x27; legal costs. After this ruling, Mrs. Erika Simon reduced her claim to €150,000. The provincial government&#x27;s response was that the expenses it had incurred to establish a museum and the costs of preserving the Iceman should be considered in determining the finder&#x27;s fee. It insisted it would pay no more than €50,000. In September 2006, the authorities appealed the case to Italy&#x27;s highest court, the Court of Cassation.

On 29 September 2008, it was announced that the provincial government and Mrs. Simon had reached a settlement of the dispute, under which she would receive €150,000 in recognition of Ötzi&#x27;s discovery by her and her late husband and the tourist income that it attracts.

<text>Operation Deadlight was the code name for the Royal Navy operation of November 1945 – February 1946 to scuttle German U-boats surrendered to the Allies after the defeat of Germany near the end of World War II. After the surrender, political discussions continued between the Allies concerning the final disposal of the surviving German naval vessels, the result of which was an agreement to retain 30 U-Boats in total, to be divided equally between the UK, the USA and the USSR. The remainder would be scuttled.

== Operation ==
Of the 156 U-boats that surrendered to the allies at the end of the war, 116 were scuttled as part of Operation Deadlight. The Royal Navy carried out the operation, and planned to tow the submarines to three areas about north-west of Ireland and sink them. The areas were codenamed XX, YY, and ZZ. They intended to use XX as the main scuttling area, while towing 36 boats to ZZ to use as practice targets for aerial attack. YY was to be a reserve position where, if the weather was good enough, they could divert submarines from XX to sink with naval forces. Submarines that were not used for target practice were to be sunk with explosive charges, with naval gunfire as a fall-back option if that failed.

When Operation Deadlight began, the navy found that many of the U-boats were in poor condition from being moored in exposed harbours while awaiting disposal. These issues, combined with poor weather, sank 56 of the boats before they reached the scuttling areas, and those that did reach the area were generally sunk by gunfire rather than explosive charges. The first sinking took place on 17 November 1945 and the last on 11 February 1946.

==U-boats excluded from Operation Deadlight==
Several U-boats escaped Operation Deadlight. Some were claimed as prizes by Britain, France, Norway, and the Soviet Union. Four were in East Asia when Germany surrendered and were commandeered by Japan. was renamed &quot;I-501&quot;, – &quot;I-506&quot;, – &quot;I-505&quot;, – &quot;I-502&quot;, and two other boats, and , had been sold to Japan in 1943 and renamed &quot;RO-500&quot; and &quot;RO-501&quot;. Two U-boats that survived Operation Deadlight are today museum ships. was earmarked for scuttling, but American Rear Admiral Daniel V. Gallery argued successfully that she did not fall under Operation Deadlight. United States Navy Task Group 22.3, under then-Captain Gallery, had captured &quot;U-505&quot; in battle on 4 June 1944. Having been captured, not surrendered at the end of the war, she survived to become a war memorial at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago. was transferred to Norway by Britain in October 1948 and became the Norwegian &quot;Kaura&quot;. She was returned to Germany in 1965, to become a museum ship at Laboe in October 1971.

==Salvage proposals==
In the late-1990s, a firm applied to the British Ministry of Defence for salvage rights to the Operation Deadlight U-boats, planning to raise up to a hundred of them. Because the U-boats were constructed in the pre-atomic age, the wrecks contain metals that are not radioactively tainted, and are therefore valuable for certain research purposes. The ministry awarded no salvage rights, due to objections from Russia and the U.S., and potentially from Great Britain. 

Between 2001 and 2003, nautical archaeologist Innes McCartney discovered and surveyed fourteen of the U-boat wrecks; including the rare Type XXI U-boat &quot;U-2506&quot;, once under the command of Horst von Schroeter; the successful Type IXC U-boat, commanded by Adolf Piening and &quot;U-778&quot;, which was the most promising salvage.

In 2007, Derry City Council announced plans to raise &quot;U-778&quot; to be the main exhibit of a new maritime museum. On 3 October 2007, an Irish diver, Michael Hanrahan, died whilst filming the wreck as part of the salvage project. In November 2009, a spokesman from the council&#x27;s heritage museum service announced the salvage project had been cancelled for cost reasons.

<doc id="22746" wikidata="Q2739646" url="?curid=22746" title="Order of the Eastern Star">
<text>The Order of the Eastern Star (OES) is a Masonic appendant body open to both men and women. It was established in 1850 by lawyer and educator Rob Morris, a noted Freemason, and adopted and approved as an appendant body of the Masonic Fraternity in 1873. The order is based on some teachings from the Bible and is open to people of all religious beliefs. It has approximately 10,000 chapters in 18 countries and approximately 500,000 members under its General Grand Chapter.

Members of the Order of the Eastern Star are aged 18 and older; men must be Master Masons and women used to need to have specific relationships with Masons, however this was changed at General Grand Chapter in 2024. Originally, a woman would have to be the daughter, widow, wife, sister, or mother of a Master Mason. The Order now allows other relatives as well as allowing Job&#x27;s Daughters, Rainbow Girls, and Members of the Organization of Triangles (NY only) to become members when of age.

==History==

The Order was created by Rob Morris in 1850 when he was teaching at the Eureka Masonic College in Richland, Mississippi. While confined by illness, he set down the principles of the order in his &quot;Rosary of the Eastern Star&quot;. By 1855, he had organized a &quot;Supreme Constellation&quot; in New York, which chartered chapters throughout the United States.

In 1866, Dr. Morris started working with Robert Macoy, and handed the Order over to him while Morris was traveling in the Holy Land. Macoy organized the current system of Chapters, and modified Dr. Morris&#x27; &quot;Rosary&quot; into a &quot;Ritual&quot;.

Similarly to Freemasonry, the Order of Eastern Star was not open to African Americans. Prince Hall Freemasonry was formed in 1784 and the first Prince Hall Order of the Eastern Star chapter was founded on December 1, 1874, titled, Queen Esther Chapter, No. 1, and established in Washington, D.C. by Thornton Andrew Jackson.

The &quot;General Grand Chapter&quot; was formed in Indianapolis, Indiana on November 6, 1876. Committees formed at that time created the &quot;Ritual of the Order of the Eastern Star&quot; in more or less its current form.

==Emblem and heroines==
The emblem of the Order is a five-pointed star with the white ray of the star pointing downwards towards the manger. The meaning of the letters FATAL surrounding the center pentagon in the emblem is only revealed to members of the Order. In the Chapter room, the downward-pointing white ray points to the West. The character-building lessons taught in the Order are stories inspired by Biblical figures:
* Adah, Jephthah&#x27;s daughter from the Book of Judges. In Eastern Star, Adah is represented by the color blue and a sword and veil. Adah represents the virtue of obedience.
* Ruth, the widow from the Book of Ruth. In Eastern Star, Ruth is represented by the color yellow and a sheaf of barley. Ruth represents the virtue of religious principles.
* Esther, the wife from the Book of Esther. In Eastern Star, Esther is represented by the color white and a crown and scepter. Esther represents the virtue of loyalty.
* Martha, sister of Mary and Lazarus, from the Gospel of Luke and the Gospel of John. In Eastern Star, Martha is represented by the color green and a broken column. Martha represents the virtue of endurance in trial.
* Electa, the &quot;elect lady&quot; from II John. In Eastern Star, Electa is represented by the color red and a chalice. Electa represents the virtue of endurance of persecution.

==Officers==
There are 18 main officers in a full chapter:

* Worthy Matron – presiding officer
* Worthy Patron – a Master Mason who provides general supervision
* Associate Matron – assumes the duties of the Worthy Matron in the absence of that officer
* Associate Patron – assumes the duties of the Worthy Patron in the absence of that officer
* Secretary – takes care of all correspondence and minutes
* Treasurer – takes care of monies of the Chapter
* Conductress – Leads visitors and initiations.
* Associate Conductress – Prepares candidates for initiation, assists the conductress with introductions and handles the ballot box.
* Chaplain – leads the Chapter in prayer
* Marshal – presents the Flag and leads in all ceremonies
* Organist – provides music for the meetings
* Adah – Shares the lesson of Duty of Obedience to the will of God
* Ruth – Shares the lesson of Honor and Justice
* Esther – Shares the lesson of Loyalty to Family and Friends
* Martha – Shares the lesson of Faith and Trust in God and Everlasting Life
* Electa – Shares the lesson of Charity and Hospitality
* Warder – Sits next to the door inside the meeting room, to make sure those that enter the chapter room are members of the Order.
* Sentinel – Sits next to the door outside the chapter room, to ensure people who wish to enter are members of the Order.

Traditionally, a woman who is elected Associate Conductress will be elected to Conductress the following year, then the next year Associate Matron, and the next year Worthy Matron. A man elected Associate Patron will usually be elected Worthy Patron the following year. Usually, the woman who is elected to become Associate Matron will let it be known who she wishes to be her Associate Patron, so the next year they will both go to the East together as Worthy Matron and Worthy Patron. There is no male counterpart to the Conductress and Associate Conductress. Only women are allowed to be Matrons, Conductresses, and the Star Points (Adah, Ruth, etc.) and only men can be Patrons.

Once a member has served a term as Worthy Matron or Worthy Patron, they may use the post-nominal letters, PM or PP respectively.

==Headquarters==

The General Grand Chapter headquarters, the International Temple, is located in the Dupont Circle neighborhood of Washington, D.C., in the Perry Belmont Mansion. The mansion was built in 1909 for the purpose of entertaining the guests of Perry Belmont. They included Britain&#x27;s Prince of Wales in 1919. General Grand Chapter purchased the building in 1935. The secretary of General Grand Chapter lives there while serving his or her term of office. The mansion features works of art from around the world, most of which were given as gifts from various international Eastern Star chapters.

==Charities==
The Order has a charitable foundation and from 1986 to 2001 contributed $513,147 to Alzheimer&#x27;s disease research, juvenile diabetes research, and juvenile asthma research. It also provides bursaries to students of theology and religious music, as well as other scholarships that differ by jurisdiction. In 2000 over $83,000 was donated. Many jurisdictions support a Masonic and/or Eastern Star retirement center or nursing home for older members; some homes are also open to the public. The Elizabeth Bentley OES Scholarship Fund was started in 1947.

<doc id="22747" wikidata="Q93312" url="?curid=22747" title="OSI model">
<text>The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a reference model from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) that &quot;provides a common basis for the coordination of standards development for the purpose of systems interconnection.&quot; In the OSI reference model, the communications between systems are split into seven different abstraction layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.

The model partitions the flow of data in a communication system into seven abstraction layers to describe networked communication from the physical implementation of transmitting bits across a communications medium to the highest-level representation of data of a distributed application. Each intermediate layer serves a class of functionality to the layer above it and is served by the layer below it.

Classes of functionality are implemented in software development using established communication protocols.

Each layer in the OSI model has well-defined functions, and the methods of each layer communicate and interact with those of the layers immediately above and below as appropriate.

The Internet protocol suite as defined in and is a model of networking developed contemporarily to the OSI model, and was funded primarily by the U.S. Department of Defense. It was the foundation for the development of the Internet. It assumed the presence of generic physical links and focused primarily on the software layers of communication, with a similar but much less rigorous structure than the OSI model.

In comparison, several networking models have sought to create an intellectual framework for clarifying networking concepts and activities, but none have been as successful as the OSI reference model in becoming the standard model for discussing and teaching networking in the field of information technology. The model allows transparent communication through equivalent exchange of protocol data units (PDUs) between two parties, through what is known as peer-to-peer networking (also known as peer-to-peer communication). As a result, the OSI reference model has not only become an important piece among professionals and non-professionals alike, but also in all networking between one or many parties, due in large part to its commonly accepted user-friendly framework.

==History==
The development of the OSI model started in the late 1970s to support the emergence of the diverse computer networking methods that were competing for application in the large national networking efforts in the world (see OSI protocols and Protocol Wars). In the 1980s, the model became a working product of the Open Systems Interconnection group at the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). While attempting to provide a comprehensive description of networking, the model failed to garner reliance during the design of the Internet, which is reflected in the less prescriptive Internet Protocol Suite, principally sponsored under the auspices of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

In the early- and mid-1970s, networking was largely either government-sponsored (NPL network in the UK, ARPANET in the US, CYCLADES in France) or vendor-developed with proprietary standards, such as IBM&#x27;s Systems Network Architecture and Digital Equipment Corporation&#x27;s DECnet. Public data networks were only just beginning to emerge, and these began to use the X.25 standard in the late 1970s.

The Experimental Packet Switched System in the UK –1975 identified the need for defining higher-level protocols. The UK National Computing Centre publication, &quot;Why Distributed Computing&quot;, which came from considerable research into future configurations for computer systems, resulted in the UK presenting the case for an international standards committee to cover this area at the ISO meeting in Sydney in March 1977.

Beginning in 1977, the ISO initiated a program to develop general standards and methods of networking. A similar process evolved at the International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee (CCITT, from French: &quot;Comité Consultatif International Téléphonique et Télégraphique&quot;). Both bodies developed documents that defined similar networking models. The British Department of Trade and Industry acted as the secretariat, and universities in the United Kingdom developed prototypes of the standards.

The OSI model was first defined in raw form in Washington, D.C., in February 1978 by French software engineer Hubert Zimmermann, and the refined but still draft standard was published by the ISO in 1980.

The drafters of the reference model had to contend with many competing priorities and interests. The rate of technological change made it necessary to define standards that new systems could converge to rather than standardizing procedures after the fact; the reverse of the traditional approach to developing standards. Although not a standard itself, it was a framework in which future standards could be defined.

In May 1983, the CCITT and ISO documents were merged to form &quot;The Basic Reference Model for Open Systems Interconnection&quot;, usually referred to as the &quot;Open Systems Interconnection Reference Model&quot;, &quot;OSI Reference Model&quot;, or simply &quot;OSI model&quot;. It was published in 1984 by both the ISO, as standard ISO 7498, and the renamed CCITT (now called the Telecommunications Standardization Sector of the International Telecommunication Union or ITU-T) as standard X.200.

OSI had two major components: an abstract model of networking, called the Basic Reference Model or seven-layer model, and a set of specific protocols. The OSI reference model was a major advance in the standardisation of network concepts. It promoted the idea of a consistent model of protocol layers, defining interoperability between network devices and software.

The concept of a seven-layer model was provided by the work of Charles Bachman at Honeywell Information Systems. Various aspects of OSI design evolved from experiences with the NPL network, ARPANET, CYCLADES, EIN, and the International Network Working Group (IFIP WG6.1). In this model, a networking system was divided into layers. Within each layer, one or more entities implement its functionality. Each entity interacted directly only with the layer immediately beneath it and provided facilities for use by the layer above it.

The OSI standards documents are available from the ITU-T as the X.200 series of recommendations. Some of the protocol specifications were also available as part of the ITU-T X series. The equivalent ISO/IEC standards for the OSI model were available from ISO. Not all are free of charge.

OSI was an industry effort, attempting to get industry participants to agree on common network standards to provide multi-vendor interoperability. It was common for large networks to support multiple network protocol suites, with many devices unable to interoperate with other devices because of a lack of common protocols. For a period in the late 1980s and early 1990s, engineers, organizations and nations became polarized over the issue of which standard, the OSI model or the Internet protocol suite, would result in the best and most robust computer networks. However, while OSI developed its networking standards in the late 1980s, TCP/IP came into widespread use on multi-vendor networks for internetworking.

The OSI model is still used as a reference for teaching and documentation; however, the OSI protocols originally conceived for the model did not gain popularity. Some engineers argue the OSI reference model is still relevant to cloud computing. Others say the original OSI model does not fit today&#x27;s networking protocols and have suggested instead a simplified approach.

==Definitions==

Communication protocols enable an entity in one host to interact with a corresponding entity at the same layer in another host. Service definitions, like the OSI model, abstractly describe the functionality provided to a layer &quot;N&quot; by a layer &quot;N−1&quot;, where &quot;N&quot; is one of the seven layers of protocols operating in the local host.

At each level &quot;N&quot;, two entities at the communicating devices (layer N &quot;peers&quot;) exchange protocol data units (PDUs) by means of a layer N &quot;protocol&quot;. Each PDU contains a payload, called the service data unit (SDU), along with protocol-related headers or footers.

Data processing by two communicating OSI-compatible devices proceeds as follows:
# The data to be transmitted is composed at the topmost layer of the transmitting device (layer &quot;N&quot;) into a &quot;protocol data unit&quot; (&quot;PDU&quot;).
# The &quot;PDU&quot; is passed to layer &quot;N−1&quot;, where it is known as the &quot;service data unit&quot; (&quot;SDU&quot;).
# At layer &quot;N−1&quot; the &quot;SDU&quot; is concatenated with a header, a footer, or both, producing a &quot;layer N−1 PDU&quot;. It is then passed to layer &quot;N−2&quot;.
# The process continues until reaching the lowermost level, from which the data is transmitted to the receiving device.
# At the receiving device the data is passed from the lowest to the highest layer as a series of &quot;SDU&quot;s while being successively stripped from each layer&#x27;s header or footer until reaching the topmost layer, where the last of the data is consumed.

===Standards documents===
The OSI model was defined in ISO/IEC 7498 which consists of the following parts:
*ISO/IEC 7498-1 The Basic Model
*ISO/IEC 7498-2 Security Architecture
*ISO/IEC 7498-3 Naming and addressing
*ISO/IEC 7498-4 Management framework

ISO/IEC 7498-1 is also published as ITU-T Recommendation X.200.

==Layer architecture==
The recommendation X.200 describes seven layers, labelled 1 to 7. Layer 1 is the lowest layer in this model.
===Layer 1: Physical layer===

The physical layer is responsible for the transmission and reception of unstructured raw data between a device, such as a network interface controller, Ethernet hub, or network switch, and a physical transmission medium. It converts the digital bits into electrical, radio, or optical signals. Layer specifications define characteristics such as voltage levels, the timing of voltage changes, physical data rates, maximum transmission distances, modulation scheme, channel access method and physical connectors. This includes the layout of pins, voltages, line impedance, cable specifications, signal timing and frequency for wireless devices. Bit rate control is done at the physical layer and may define transmission mode as simplex, half duplex, and full duplex. The components of a physical layer can be described in terms of the network topology. Physical layer specifications are included in the specifications for the ubiquitous Bluetooth, Ethernet, and USB standards. An example of a less well-known physical layer specification would be for the CAN standard.

The physical layer also specifies how encoding occurs over a physical signal, such as electrical voltage or a light pulse. For example, a 1 bit might be represented on a copper wire by the transition from a 0-volt to a 5-volt signal, whereas a 0 bit might be represented by the transition from a 5-volt to a 0-volt signal. As a result, common problems occurring at the physical layer are often related to the incorrect media termination, EMI or noise scrambling, and NICs and hubs that are misconfigured or do not work correctly.

===Layer 2: Data link layer===

The data link layer provides node-to-node data transfer—a link between two directly connected nodes. It detects and possibly corrects errors that may occur in the physical layer. It defines the protocol to establish and terminate a connection between two physically connected devices. It also defines the protocol for flow control between them.

IEEE 802 divides the data link layer into two sublayers:
* Medium access control (MAC) layer – responsible for controlling how devices in a network gain access to a medium and permission to transmit data.
* Logical link control (LLC) layer – responsible for identifying and encapsulating network layer protocols, and controls error checking and frame synchronization.

The MAC and LLC layers of IEEE 802 networks such as 802.3 Ethernet, 802.11 Wi-Fi, and 802.15.4 Zigbee operate at the data link layer.

The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) is a data link layer protocol that can operate over several different physical layers, such as synchronous and asynchronous serial lines.

The ITU-T G.hn standard, which provides high-speed local area networking over existing wires (power lines, phone lines and coaxial cables), includes a complete data link layer that provides both error correction and flow control by means of a selective-repeat sliding-window protocol.

Security, specifically (authenticated) encryption, at this layer can be applied with MACsec.

===Layer 3: Network layer===

The network layer provides the functional and procedural means of transferring packets from one node to another connected in &quot;different networks&quot;. A network is a medium to which many nodes can be connected, on which every node has an &quot;address&quot; and which permits nodes connected to it to transfer messages to other nodes connected to it by merely providing the content of a message and the address of the destination node and letting the network find the way to deliver the message to the destination node, possibly routing it through intermediate nodes. If the message is too large to be transmitted from one node to another on the data link layer between those nodes, the network may implement message delivery by splitting the message into several fragments at one node, sending the fragments independently, and reassembling the fragments at another node. It may, but does not need to, report delivery errors.

Message delivery at the network layer is not necessarily guaranteed to be reliable; a network layer protocol may provide reliable message delivery, but it does not need to do so.

A number of layer-management protocols, a function defined in the &quot;management annex&quot;, ISO 7498/4, belong to the network layer. These include routing protocols, multicast group management, network-layer information and error, and network-layer address assignment. It is the function of the payload that makes these belong to the network layer, not the protocol that carries them.

===Layer 4: Transport layer===

The transport layer provides the functional and procedural means of transferring variable-length data sequences from a source host to a destination host from one application to another across a network while maintaining the quality-of-service functions. Transport protocols may be connection-oriented or connectionless.

This may require breaking large protocol data units or long data streams into smaller chunks called &quot;segments&quot;, since the network layer imposes a maximum packet size called the maximum transmission unit (MTU), which depends on the maximum packet size imposed by all data link layers on the network path between the two hosts. The amount of data in a data segment must be small enough to allow for a network-layer header and a transport-layer header. For example, for data being transferred across Ethernet, the MTU is 1500 bytes, the minimum size of a TCP header is 20 bytes, and the minimum size of an IPv4 header is 20 bytes, so the maximum segment size is 1500−(20+20) bytes, or 1460 bytes. The process of dividing data into segments is called segmentation; it is an optional function of the transport layer. Some connection-oriented transport protocols, such as TCP and the OSI connection-oriented transport protocol (COTP), perform segmentation and reassembly of segments on the receiving side; connectionless transport protocols, such as UDP and the OSI connectionless transport protocol (CLTP), usually do not.

The transport layer also controls the reliability of a given link between a source and destination host through flow control, error control, and acknowledgments of sequence and existence. Some protocols are state- and connection-oriented. This means that the transport layer can keep track of the segments and retransmit those that fail delivery through the acknowledgment hand-shake system. The transport layer will also provide the acknowledgement of the successful data transmission and sends the next data if no errors occurred.

Reliability, however, is not a strict requirement within the transport layer. Protocols like UDP, for example, are used in applications that are willing to accept some packet loss, reordering, errors or duplication. Streaming media, real-time multiplayer games and voice over IP (VoIP) are examples of applications in which loss of packets is not usually a fatal problem.

The OSI connection-oriented transport protocol defines five classes of connection-mode transport protocols, ranging from class 0 (which is also known as TP0 and provides the fewest features) to class 4 (TP4, designed for less reliable networks, similar to the Internet). Class 0 contains no error recovery and was designed for use on network layers that provide error-free connections. Class 4 is closest to TCP, although TCP contains functions, such as the graceful close, which OSI assigns to the session layer. Also, all OSI TP connection-mode protocol classes provide expedited data and preservation of record boundaries. Detailed characteristics of TP0–4 classes are shown in the following table:

An easy way to visualize the transport layer is to compare it with a post office, which deals with the dispatch and classification of mail and parcels sent. A post office inspects only the outer envelope of mail to determine its delivery. Higher layers may have the equivalent of double envelopes, such as cryptographic presentation services that can be read by the addressee only. Roughly speaking, tunnelling protocols operate at the transport layer, such as carrying non-IP protocols such as IBM&#x27;s SNA or Novell&#x27;s IPX over an IP network, or end-to-end encryption with IPsec. While Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) might seem to be a network-layer protocol, if the encapsulation of the payload takes place only at the endpoint, GRE becomes closer to a transport protocol that uses IP headers but contains complete Layer 2 frames or Layer 3 packets to deliver to the endpoint. L2TP carries PPP frames inside transport segments.

Although not developed under the OSI Reference Model and not strictly conforming to the OSI definition of the transport layer, the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) of the Internet Protocol Suite are commonly categorized as layer 4 protocols within OSI.

Transport Layer Security (TLS) does not strictly fit inside the model either. It contains characteristics of the transport and presentation layers.

===Layer 5: Session layer===

The session layer creates the setup, controls the connections, and ends the teardown, between two or more computers, which is called a &quot;session&quot;. Common functions of the session layer include user logon (establishment) and user logoff (termination) functions. Including this matter, authentication methods are also built into most client software, such as FTP Client and NFS Client for Microsoft Networks. Therefore, the session layer establishes, manages and terminates the connections between the local and remote applications. The session layer also provides for full-duplex, half-duplex, or simplex operation, and establishes procedures for checkpointing, suspending, restarting, and terminating a session between two related streams of data, such as an audio and a video stream in a web-conferencing application. Therefore, the session layer is commonly implemented explicitly in application environments that use remote procedure calls.

===Layer 6: Presentation layer===

The presentation layer establishes data formatting and data translation into a format specified by the application layer during the encapsulation of outgoing messages while being passed down the protocol stack, and possibly reversed during the deencapsulation of incoming messages when being passed up the protocol stack. For this very reason, outgoing messages during encapsulation are converted into a format specified by the application layer, while the conversion for incoming messages during deencapsulation are reversed.

The presentation layer handles protocol conversion, data encryption, data decryption, data compression, data decompression, incompatibility of data representation between operating systems, and graphic commands. The presentation layer transforms data into the form that the application layer accepts, to be sent across a network. Since the presentation layer converts data and graphics into a display format for the application layer, the presentation layer is sometimes called the syntax layer. For this reason, the presentation layer negotiates the transfer of syntax structure through the Basic Encoding Rules of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1), with capabilities such as converting an EBCDIC-coded text file to an ASCII-coded file, or serialization of objects and other data structures from and to XML.

===Layer 7: Application layer===

The application layer is the layer of the OSI model that is closest to the end user, which means both the OSI application layer and the user interact directly with a software application that implements a component of communication between the client and server, such as File Explorer and Microsoft Word. Such application programs fall outside the scope of the OSI model unless they are directly integrated into the application layer through the functions of communication, as is the case with applications such as web browsers and email programs. Other examples of software are Microsoft Network Software for File and Printer Sharing and Unix/Linux Network File System Client for access to shared file resources.

Application-layer functions typically include file sharing, message handling, and database access, through the most common protocols at the application layer, known as HTTP, FTP, SMB/CIFS, TFTP, and SMTP. When identifying communication partners, the application layer determines the identity and availability of communication partners for an application with data to transmit. The most important distinction in the application layer is the distinction between the application entity and the application. For example, a reservation website might have two application entities: one using HTTP to communicate with its users, and one for a remote database protocol to record reservations. Neither of these protocols have anything to do with reservations. That logic is in the application itself. The application layer has no means to determine the availability of resources in the network.

==Cross-layer functions==
Cross-layer functions are services that are not tied to a given layer, but may affect more than one layer. Some orthogonal aspects, such as management and security, involve all of the layers (See ITU-T X.800 Recommendation). These services are aimed at improving the CIA triad—confidentiality, integrity, and availability—of the transmitted data.
Cross-layer functions are the norm, in practice, because the availability of a communication service is determined by the interaction between network design and network management protocols.

Specific examples of cross-layer functions include the following:
* Security service (telecommunication) as defined by ITU-T X.800 recommendation.
* Management functions, i.e. functions that permit to configure, instantiate, monitor, terminate the communications of two or more entities: there is a specific application-layer protocol, Common Management Information Protocol (CMIP) and its corresponding service, Common Management Information Service (CMIS), they need to interact with every layer in order to deal with their instances.
* Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), ATM, and X.25 are 3a protocols. OSI subdivides the Network Layer into three sublayers: 3a) Subnetwork Access, 3b) Subnetwork Dependent Convergence and 3c) Subnetwork Independent Convergence. It was designed to provide a unified data-carrying service for both circuit-based clients and packet-switching clients which provide a datagram-based service model. It can be used to carry many different kinds of traffic, including IP packets, as well as native ATM, SONET, and Ethernet frames. Sometimes one sees reference to a Layer 2.5.
* Cross MAC and PHY Scheduling is essential in wireless networks because of the time-varying nature of wireless channels. By scheduling packet transmission only in favourable channel conditions, which requires the MAC layer to obtain channel state information from the PHY layer, network throughput can be significantly improved and energy waste can be avoided.

==Programming interfaces==
Neither the OSI Reference Model, nor any OSI protocol specifications, outline any programming interfaces, other than deliberately abstract service descriptions. Protocol specifications define a methodology for communication between peers, but the software interfaces are implementation-specific.

For example, the Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS) and Open Data-Link Interface (ODI) are interfaces between the media (layer 2) and the network protocol (layer 3).

==Comparison to other networking suites==
The table below presents a list of OSI layers, the original OSI protocols, and some &quot;approximate&quot; modern matches. This correspondence is rough: the OSI model contains idiosyncrasies not found in later systems such as the IP stack in modern Internet.

===Comparison with TCP/IP model===

The design of protocols in the TCP/IP model of the Internet does not concern itself with strict hierarchical encapsulation and layering. contains a section entitled &quot;Layering considered harmful&quot;. TCP/IP does recognize four broad layers of functionality which are derived from the operating scope of their contained protocols: the scope of the software application; the host-to-host transport path; the internetworking range; and the scope of the direct links to other nodes on the local network.

Despite using a different concept for layering than the OSI model, these layers are often compared with the OSI layering scheme in the following manner:
* The Internet application layer maps to the OSI application layer, presentation layer, and most of the session layer.
* The TCP/IP transport layer maps to the graceful close function of the OSI session layer as well as the OSI transport layer.
* The internet layer performs functions as those in a subset of the OSI network layer.
* The link layer corresponds to the OSI data link layer and may include similar functions as the physical layer, as well as some protocols of the OSI&#x27;s network layer.
These comparisons are based on the original seven-layer protocol model as defined in ISO 7498, rather than refinements in the internal organization of the network layer.

The OSI protocol suite that was specified as part of the OSI project was considered by many as too complicated and inefficient, and to a large extent unimplementable. Taking the &quot;forklift upgrade&quot; approach to networking, it specified eliminating all existing networking protocols and replacing them at all layers of the stack. This made implementation difficult and was resisted by many vendors and users with significant investments in other network technologies. In addition, the protocols included so many optional features that many vendors&#x27; implementations were not interoperable.

Although the OSI model is often still referenced, the Internet protocol suite has become the standard for networking. TCP/IP&#x27;s pragmatic approach to computer networking and to independent implementations of simplified protocols made it a practical methodology. Some protocols and specifications in the OSI stack remain in use, one example being IS-IS, which was specified for OSI as ISO/IEC 10589:2002 and adapted for Internet use with TCP/IP as RFC 1142.

<doc id="22751" wikidata="Q684538" url="?curid=22751" title="Original Sin (2001 film)">
<text>Original Sin is a 2001 American erotic romantic thriller film starring Antonio Banderas and Angelina Jolie. It is based on the novel &quot;Waltz into Darkness&quot; by Cornell Woolrich, and is a remake of the 1969 François Truffaut film &quot;Mississippi Mermaid&quot;. The film was produced by actress Michelle Pfeiffer&#x27;s production company, Via Rosa Productions.

==Plot==
&quot;Original Sin&quot; is set in late 19th century Cuba during the Spanish rule, and flashes back and forth from the scene of a woman awaiting her execution while telling her story to a priest to the actual events of that story.

Luis Vargas, a Cuban man, sends for American Julia Russell from Delaware to be his mail-order bride. Julia comes off the ship, looking nothing like her photos. Julia explains she wants more than a man who is only interested in a pretty face, so she substitutes a plain-looking woman&#x27;s photo. Luis also admits to deception; he has misled her into believing he is a poor clerk instead of a wealthy plantation owner. Julia says that they both have something in common: that both are not to be trusted. But they assure each other that they will try to understand and trust each other in life.

Luis and Julia wed in the church within hours of her setting foot in Cuba. Luis falls desperately in love with her and they have passionate sex. Meanwhile, Julia&#x27;s sister Emily is worried. She sends an emotional letter asking about her welfare. Luis forces Julia to write back, fearing that if Julia continues to ignore Emily&#x27;s letters, Emily will assume something terrible has befallen her sister, and she might send the authorities. Holding off as long as possible, Julia finally pens a letter to her sister.

Luis adds Julia to his business and personal bank accounts, giving her free rein to spend as she pleases. A detective, Walter Downs, arrives from Wilmington and tells Luis that he has been hired by Emily to find her sister Julia and would like to see her on the coming Sunday. Luis informs Julia about this, and she gets upset. Emily arrives in Cuba to meet Luis and shows the letter Julia wrote to her. She informs Luis that she believes Julia to be an impostor and that her sister may be dead. Luis discovers that Julia has taken nearly all of his fortune and teams up with Walter to look for her.

Luis finds Julia and discovers she is actually in league with Walter. Luis believes she loves him and lies to Walter, but when confronted, a fight breaks out, and Luis shoots Walter. Julia sends Luis to go and buy them tickets home, but it is a trick, and Walter is not dead. Julia appears to love Luis but fears Walter, so she and Luis run off to live secretly, with the supposedly dead Walter in pursuit. Walter turns out to be Julia&#x27;s (Bonny&#x27;s) old lover and partner, Billy. Billy makes a cut on Bonny&#x27;s back before having sex with her, as he did during their previous encounters.

Luis throws away his promising future to be with Julia/Bonny. One night, Luis follows Julia/Bonny and discovers Walter/Billy is alive and that the two are still working together; she is apparently going to poison her husband that very night. He returns home to wait for her, and when she arrives, he reveals that he knows about the plan, confesses his love for her once more, and swallows the poisoned drink. Julia flees with the dying Luis, with Walter close behind. They run into him at a train station; Walter is furious that Julia has betrayed him. As Walter holds a knife to her throat, Luis shoots and wounds him, with Julia finishing him off.

Back in the &quot;mise en scene&quot;, Julia finishes her story and asks the priest to pray with her. The next morning the guards come to her cell to take her to her execution, only to find the priest kneeling in her clothing.

In Morocco, Julia is watching a card game. She walks around the table occupied by gamblers – including Luis – and thanks them for allowing her to watch. As Julia signals Luis about the other players&#x27; cards, he begins telling them the story of how they got there.

==Cast==
== Production ==
It was rumored that the chemistry between Jolie and Banderas led to a relationship, which they denied. The film had to be cut to achieve a R-rating, which director Michael Cristofer called censorship.

==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has a 12% approval rating based on 90 reviews and an average rating of 3.40/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Laughably melodramatic, &quot;Original Sin&quot; features bad acting, poor dialogue and even worse plotting.&quot; On Metacritic, it has a score of 33 based on reviews from 24 critics, indicating generally unfavorable reviews. 

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the movie a positive review, and said about Jolie&#x27;s performance: &quot;Jolie continues to stalk through pictures entirely on her own terms. Her presence is like a dare-ya for a man. There&#x27;s dialogue in this movie so overwrought, it&#x27;s almost literally unspeakable, and she survives it by biting it off contemptuously and spitting it out.&quot;
Angelina Jolie was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress for her work in both this film and &quot;Lara Croft: Tomb Raider&quot;.

<text>Oscar Greeley Clendenning Hammerstein II (; July 12, 1895 – August 23, 1960) was an American lyricist, librettist, theatrical producer, and director in musical theater for nearly 40 years. He won eight Tony Awards and two Academy Awards for Best Original Song. Many of his songs are standard repertoire for vocalists and jazz musicians. He co-wrote 850 songs.

He is best known for his collaborations with composer Richard Rodgers, as the duo Rodgers and Hammerstein, whose musicals include &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, &quot;Carousel&quot;, &quot;South Pacific&quot;, &quot;The King and I&quot;, &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot;, and &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;. Described by Stephen Sondheim as an &quot;experimental playwright&quot;, Hammerstein helped bring the American musical to new maturity by popularizing musicals that focused on stories and character rather than the lighthearted entertainment that the musical had been known for beforehand.

He also collaborated with Jerome Kern (with whom he wrote the 1927 musical &quot;Show Boat&quot;), Vincent Youmans, Rudolf Friml, Richard A. Whiting, and Sigmund Romberg.

==Early life==
Oscar Greeley Clendenning Hammerstein II was born on West 125th Street in Harlem, New York. The son of Alice Hammerstein ( Nimmo) and theatrical manager William Hammerstein. His grandfather was the German theater impresario Oscar Hammerstein I. His father was from a Jewish family, and his mother was the daughter of British parents. He attended the Church of the Divine Paternity, now the Fourth Universalist Society in the City of New York.

Although Hammerstein&#x27;s father managed the Victoria Theatre and was a producer of vaudeville shows, he was opposed to his son&#x27;s desire to participate in the arts.

Hammerstein attended Columbia University (1912–1916) and studied at Columbia Law School until 1917. As a student, he maintained high grades and engaged in numerous extracurricular activities. These included playing first base on the baseball team, performing in the Varsity Show and becoming an active member of Pi Lambda Phi fraternity.

After his father&#x27;s death, in June 1914, when he was 19, he participated in his first play with the Varsity Show, entitled &quot;On Your Way&quot;. Throughout the rest of his college career, Hammerstein wrote and performed in several Varsity Shows.&lt;ref name=&quot;PBS-broadway/stars&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Following his graduation, he sat on the judging committee for the show and continued to contribute to several musicals, including &quot;Fly With Me&quot;, written by Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart.

==Early career==
After quitting law school to pursue theater, Hammerstein began his first professional collaboration, with Herbert Stothart, Otto Harbach and Frank Mandel. He began as an apprentice and went on to form a 20-year collaboration with Harbach. Out of this collaboration came his first musical, &quot;Always You&quot;, for which he wrote the book and lyrics. It opened on Broadway in 1920. In 1921 Hammerstein joined The Lambs club.

Throughout the next forty years, Hammerstein teamed up with many other composers, including Jerome Kern, with whom Hammerstein enjoyed a highly successful collaboration. In 1927, Kern and Hammerstein wrote their biggest hit based on Edna Ferber&#x27;s bestselling eponymous novel, &quot;Show Boat&quot;, which is often revived, as it is considered one of the masterpieces of American musical theater. &quot;Here we come to a completely new genre—the musical play as distinguished from musical comedy. Now ... the play was the thing, and everything else was subservient to that play. Now ... came complete integration of song, humor and production numbers into a single and inextricable artistic entity.&quot; Many years later, Hammerstein&#x27;s wife Dorothy bristled when she overheard someone remark that Jerome Kern had written &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot;. &quot;Indeed not&quot;, she retorted. &quot;Jerome Kern wrote &#x27;dum, dum, dum-dum&#x27;. My husband wrote &#x27;Ol&#x27; Man River&#x27;.&quot;

Other Kern–Hammerstein musicals include &quot;Sunny&quot;, &quot;Sweet Adeline&quot;, &quot;Music in the Air&quot;, &quot;Three Sisters&quot;, and &quot;Very Warm for May&quot;. Hammerstein also collaborated with Vincent Youmans (&quot;Wildflower&quot;), Rudolf Friml (&quot;Rose-Marie&quot;), and Sigmund Romberg (&quot;The Desert Song&quot; and &quot;The New Moon&quot;).

==Rodgers and Hammerstein==

Hammerstein&#x27;s most successful and sustained collaboration began when he teamed up with Rodgers to write a musical adaptation of the play &quot;Green Grow the Lilacs&quot;. Rodgers&#x27; first partner, Lorenz Hart, originally planned to collaborate with Rodgers on this piece, but his alcoholism had spiraled out of control, rendering him incapacitated. Hart was also not certain that the idea had much merit, and the two therefore separated. The adaptation became the first Rodgers and Hammerstein collaboration, titled &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, which opened on Broadway in 1943. It furthered the revolution begun by &quot;Show Boat&quot;, by thoroughly integrating all the aspects of musical theater, with the songs and dances arising out of and further developing the plot and characters.

William A. Everett and Paul R. Laird wrote that this was a &quot;show, that, like &quot;Show Boat&quot;, became a milestone, such that subsequent historians writing about important moments in twentieth-century theater began to identify eras according to their relationship to &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;&quot; After &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, Rodgers and Hammerstein were the most important contributors to the musical-play form—with such masterworks as &quot;Carousel&quot;, &quot;The King and I&quot; and &quot;South Pacific&quot;. &quot;The examples they set in creating vital plays, often rich with social thought, provided the necessary encouragement for other gifted writers to create musical plays of their own&quot;.

The partnership went on to produce not only the aforementioned, but also other Broadway musicals such as &quot;Allegro&quot;, &quot;Me and Juliet&quot;, &quot;Pipe Dream&quot;, &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot;, and &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, as well as the musical film &quot;State Fair&quot; (and its stage adaptation of the same name), and the television musical &quot;Cinderella&quot;, all featured in the revue &quot;A Grand Night for Singing&quot;. Hammerstein also wrote the book and lyrics for &quot;Carmen Jones&quot;, an adaptation of Georges Bizet&#x27;s opera &quot;Carmen&quot;, with an all-black cast that became a 1943 Broadway musical and a 1954 film, starring Dorothy Dandridge.

An active advocate for writers&#x27; rights within the theater industry, Hammerstein was a member of the Dramatists Guild of America. In 1956, he was elected as the eleventh president of the nonprofit organization. He continued his presidency at the Guild until 1960; he was succeeded by Alan Jay Lerner.

==Personal life==
Hammerstein married his first wife, Myra Finn, in 1917; the couple divorced in 1929. He married his second wife, the Australian-born Dorothy (Blanchard) Jacobson (1899–1987), in 1929. He had three children: William Hammerstein (1918–2001) and Alice Hammerstein Mathias (1922–2015) by his first wife, and James Hammerstein (1931–1999) by his second wife, with whom he also had a stepson, Henry Jacobson, and a stepdaughter, Susan Blanchard. His son William married the screenwriter Jane-Howard Hammerstein.

Hammerstein died of stomach cancer on August 23, 1960, at his home Highland Farm in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, aged 65, nine months after the opening of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; on Broadway. The final song he wrote was &quot;Edelweiss&quot;, which was added near the end of the second act during rehearsal. The lights of Times Square were turned off for one minute, and London&#x27;s West End lights were dimmed in recognition of his contribution to the musical. He was cremated, and his ashes were buried at the Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York. A memorial plaque was unveiled at Southwark Cathedral, England, on May 24, 1961.

After Hammerstein&#x27;s death, &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; was adapted as a 1965 film, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture.

==Reputation==
Hammerstein was one of the most important &quot;book writers&quot; in Broadway history—he made the story, not the songs or the stars, central to the musical and brought musical theater to full maturity as an art form. According to Stephen Sondheim, &quot;What few people understand is that Oscar&#x27;s big contribution to the theater was as a theoretician, as a Peter Brook, as an innovator. People don&#x27;t understand how experimental &quot;Show Boat&quot; and &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; felt at the time they were done. Oscar is not about the &#x27;lark that is learning to pray&#x27;—that&#x27;s easy to make fun of. He&#x27;s about &quot;Allegro&quot;&quot;, Hammerstein&#x27;s most experimental musical.

His reputation for being sentimental is based largely on the movie versions of the musicals, especially &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, in which a song sung by those in favor of reaching an accommodation with the Nazis, &quot;No Way to Stop It&quot;, was cut. As recent revivals of &quot;Show Boat&quot;, &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, &quot;Carousel&quot;, and &quot;The King and I&quot; in London and New York show, Hammerstein was one of the more tough-minded and socially conscious American musical theater artists. According to Richard Kislan, &quot;The shows of Rodgers and Hammerstein were the product of sincerity. In the light of criticism directed against them and their universe of sweetness and light, it is important to understand that they believed sincerely in what they wrote.&quot; According to Marc Bauch, &quot;The Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals are romantic musical plays. Love is important.&quot;

According to &quot;The Rodgers and Hammerstein Story&quot; by Stanley Green,

For three minutes, on the night of September first, the entire Times Square area in New York City was blacked out in honor of the man who had done so much to light up that particular part of the world. From 8:57 to 9:00 p.m., every neon sign and every light bulb was turned off and all traffic was halted between 42nd Street and 53rd Street, and between eighth Ave and the Avenue of the Americas. A crowd of 5,000 people, many with heads bowed, assembled at the base of the statue of Father Duffy on Times Square where two trumpeters blew taps. It was the most complete blackout on Broadway since World War II, and the greatest tribute of its kind ever paid to one man.
==Major works==


===Songs===
According to &quot;The Complete Lyrics of Oscar Hammerstein II&quot;, edited by Amy Asch, Hammerstein contributed the lyrics to 850 songs, including &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot;, &quot;Can&#x27;t Help Lovin&#x27; That Man&quot; and &quot;Make Believe&quot; from &quot;Show Boat&quot;; &quot;Indian Love Call&quot; from &quot;Rose-Marie&quot;; &quot;People Will Say We&#x27;re in Love&quot; and &quot;Oklahoma&quot; (which has been the official state song of Oklahoma since 1953) from &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;; &quot;If I Loved You&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot; from &quot;Carousel&quot;, &quot;Some Enchanted Evening&quot;, from &quot;South Pacific&quot;; &quot;Getting to Know You&quot; and &quot;Shall We Dance&quot; from &quot;The King and I&quot;; and the title song as well as &quot;Climb Ev&#x27;ry Mountain&quot; from &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;.

Several albums of Hammerstein&#x27;s musicals were named to the &quot;Songs of the Century&quot; list as compiled by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), the National Endowment for the Arts, and Scholastic Corporation:
*&quot;The Sound of Music&quot; — # 36
*&quot;Oklahoma!&quot; — # 66
*&quot;South Pacific&quot; — # 224
*&quot;The King and I&quot; — # 249
*&quot;Show Boat&quot; — # 312

==Awards and nominations==
* Oscar Hammerstein is the only person in history named &quot;Oscar&quot; to have won an Oscar.
* In 1950, the team of Rodgers and Hammerstein received The Hundred Year Association of New York&#x27;s Gold Medal Award &quot;in recognition of outstanding contributions to the City of New York.&quot;
* In 1981, The Oscar Hammerstein II Center for Theater Studies at Columbia University was established with a $1 million gift from his family.

==Legacy==
His advice and work influenced Stephen Sondheim, a friend of the Hammerstein family from childhood. Sondheim has attributed his success in theater, and especially as a lyricist, directly to Hammerstein&#x27;s influence and guidance.

The Oscar Hammerstein Award for Lifetime Achievement in Musical Theater is presented annually. The York Theatre Company of New York City is the administrator of the award. Past awardees are composers such as Stephen Sondheim and performers such as Carol Channing.

Oscar Hammerstein was a member of the American Theater Hall of Fame.

<doc id="22756" wikidata="Q23870" url="?curid=22756" title="Otto Jespersen">
<text>Jens Otto Harry Jespersen (; 16 July 1860 – 30 April 1943) was a Danish linguist who specialized in the grammar of the English language. Steven Mithen described him as &quot;one of the greatest language scholars of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.&quot;

==Early life==
Otto Jespersen was born in Randers in Jutland. He was inspired by the work of Danish philologist Rasmus Rask as a boy, and with the help of Rask&#x27;s grammars taught himself some Icelandic, Italian, and Spanish. He entered the University of Copenhagen in 1877 when he was 17, initially studying law but not forgetting his language studies. In 1881 he shifted his focus completely to languages, and in 1887 earned his master&#x27;s degree in French, with English and Latin as his secondary languages. He supported himself during his studies through part-time work as a schoolteacher and as a shorthand reporter in the Danish parliament.

In June, 1886, Jespersen became a member of the International Phonetic Association, then called The Phonetic Teachers&#x27; Association. In fact the idea of creating a phonetic alphabet that could be used by every language was first put forward by Jespersen in a letter he sent to Paul Passy.

In 1887–1888, he traveled to England, Germany and France, meeting linguists like Henry Sweet and Paul Passy and attending lectures at institutions like Oxford University. Following the advice of his mentor Vilhelm Thomsen, he returned to Copenhagen in August 1888 and began work on his doctoral dissertation on the English case system. He successfully defended his dissertation in 1891.

==Academic life and work==
Jespersen was a professor of English at the University of Copenhagen from 1893 to his retirement in 1925, and served as Rector of the university in 1920–21. His early work focused primarily on language teaching reform and on phonetics, but he is best known for his later work on syntax and on language development.

He advanced the theories of &quot;Rank&quot; and &quot;Nexus&quot; in Danish in two papers: &quot;Sprogets logik&quot; (1913) and &quot;De to hovedarter af grammatiske forbindelser&quot; (1921). Jespersen in this theory of ranks removes the parts of speech from the syntax, and differentiates between primaries, secondaries, and tertiaries; e.g. in &quot;&quot;well honed phrase&quot;,&quot; &quot;phrase&quot; is a primary, this being defined by a secondary, &quot;honed&quot;, which again is defined by a tertiary &quot;well&quot;. The term &quot;Nexus&quot; is applied to sentences, structures similar to sentences and sentences in formation, in which two concepts are expressed in one unit; e.g., &quot;it rained, he ran indoors&quot;. This term is qualified by a further concept called a &quot;junction&quot; which represents one idea, expressed by means of two or more elements, whereas a nexus combines two ideas. Junction and nexus proved valuable in bringing the concept of context to the forefront of the attention of the world of linguistics.

He was most widely recognized for some of his books. &quot;Language: Its Nature, Development and Origin&quot; (1922) is considered by many to be his keystone work. The multi-volume, descriptive reference work &quot;A Modern English Grammar on Historical Principles&quot; (1909–1949) is likely his most influential work and concentrated on morphology and syntax, while &quot;Growth and Structure of the English Language&quot; (1905) is a comprehensive view of the English language, and still in print, over 70 years after his death and more than 100 years after publication. Late in his life he published &quot;Analytic Syntax&quot; (1937), in which he presents his views on syntactic structure using an idiosyncratic shorthand notation. In &quot;The Philosophy of Grammar&quot; (1924) he challenged the accepted views of common concepts in grammar and proposed corrections to the basic definitions of grammatical case, pronoun, object, voice etc., and developed further his notions of &quot;Rank&quot; and &quot;Nexus&quot;. In the 21st century this book is still used as one of the basic texts in modern structural linguistics. &quot;Mankind, Nation and Individual: from a linguistic point of view&quot; (1925) is one of the pioneering works on sociolinguistics.

Jespersen visited the United States twice: he lectured at the Congress of Arts and Sciences in St. Louis in 1904, and in 1909–1910 he visited both the University of California and Columbia University. While in the U.S., he took occasion to study the country&#x27;s educational system. His autobiography (see below) was published in English translation as recently as 1995.

After his retirement in 1925, Jespersen remained active in the international linguistic community. In addition to continuing to write, he convened and chaired the first International Meeting on Linguistic Research in Geneva in 1930, and acted as president of the Fourth International Congress of Linguists in Copenhagen in 1936.

Jespersen was an important figure in the international language movement. He was an early supporter of the Esperanto offshoot Ido and in 1928 published his own project Novial. He also worked with the International Auxiliary Language Association.

Jespersen received honorary degrees from Columbia University in New York (1910), St. Andrews University in Scotland (1925), and the Sorbonne in Paris (1927). He was one of the first six international scholars to be elected as honorary members of the Linguistic Society of America. He was elected a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1931.

<text>This is a list of notable programming languages with features designed for object-oriented programming (OOP).

The listed languages are designed with varying degrees of OOP support. Some are highly focused in OOP while others support multiple paradigms including OOP. For example, C++ is a multi-paradigm language including OOP; however, it is less object-oriented than other languages such as Python and Ruby.

<doc id="22761" wikidata="Q35850" url="?curid=22761" title="Interlingue">
<text>Interlingue (; ISO 639 &quot;ie&quot;, &quot;ile&quot;), originally Occidental (), is an international auxiliary language created in 1922 and renamed in 1949. Its creator, Edgar de Wahl, sought to achieve maximal grammatical regularity and natural character. The vocabulary is based on pre-existing words from various languages and a derivational system which uses recognized prefixes and suffixes.

Many of Interlingue&#x27;s derived word forms reflect those common to certain Western European languages, primarily the Romance languages, along with some Germanic vocabulary. Many of its words are formed using de Wahl&#x27;s rule, a set of rules for regular conversion of all but six verb infinitives into derived words including from Latin double-stem verbs (e.g. &quot;vider&quot; to see and its derivative &quot;vision&quot;). The result is a naturalistic and regular language that is easy to understand at first sight for individuals acquainted with certain Western European languages. Readability and simplified grammar, along with the regular appearance of the magazine &quot;Cosmoglotta&quot;, made Occidental popular in Europe during the years before World War II despite efforts by the Nazis to suppress international auxiliary languages.

Occidental survived the war, but the community had been out of touch with the language&#x27;s creator since 1939. A Baltic German naval officer and teacher from Estonia, de Wahl refused to leave his Tallinn home for Germany, even after his house was destroyed in the 1943 air raids on the city forcing him to take refuge in a psychiatric hospital. Since most of his mail had been intercepted, he died in 1948 largely unaware of developments in the language. The name change to &quot;Interlingue&quot; took place the following year for two reasons: (1) to demonstrate to the Soviet Union the language&#x27;s neutrality, and (2) the expectation of a possible union or closer collaboration with the community around Interlingua, a competing naturalistic project under development. Many users were lost following the latter&#x27;s appearance in 1951, beginning a period of decline until the advent of the Internet.

==History and activity==

=== Beginnings ===

Edgar de Wahl announced the creation of Occidental in 1922 with the first issue of the magazine &quot;Cosmoglotta&quot;, published in Tallinn, Estonia under the name &quot;Kosmoglott&quot;. Occidental was a product of years of personal experimentation under the name Auli (auxiliary language), which he used from 1906 to 1921 and which later on gained the nickname proto-Occidental. De Wahl, originally a proponent of Volapük and then Esperanto, began creating Occidental after the failed vote to reform Esperanto in 1894.

De Wahl corresponded with other language creators, among them the Italian mathematician Giuseppe Peano (creator of Latino sine flexione), from whom he gained an appreciation for its selection of international vocabulary, and Waldemar Rosenberger, the creator of Idiom Neutral.
Upon its announcement in 1922, Occidental was nearly complete. De Wahl had not intended to announce the language for a few years, but decided to accelerate its release after hearing that the League of Nations (LON) had begun an inquiry into the question of an international language. The first known publication in Occidental, a booklet entitled &quot;Transcendent Algebra&quot; by Jacob Linzbach, appeared shortly before &quot;Kosmoglott&quot; debuted.

Occidental began gathering followers due to its readability, despite a complete lack of grammars and dictionaries. Two years later in 1924, de Wahl wrote that he was corresponding with about 30 people &quot;in good Occidental&quot; despite the lack of learning material, and users of other languages began to join Occidental. The first dictionary, the &quot;Radicarium Directiv,&quot; a collection of Occidental root words and their equivalents in eight languages, was published the following year.

&quot;Kosmoglott&quot; was also a forum for various other planned languages, while still mainly written in Occidental. The name was changed to &quot;Cosmoglotta&quot; in 1927 as it began to officially promote Occidental in lieu of other languages, and that January the magazine&#x27;s editorial and administrative office was moved to the Vienna neighborhood of Mauer, now part of Liesing. Much of the early success for Occidental in this period came from the office&#x27;s new central location, along with the efforts of Engelbert Pigal, also from Austria, whose article &quot;Li Ovre de Edgar de Wahl&quot; (The Work of Edgar de Wahl) led to interest in Occidental from users of Ido. Use in France began in 1928, and by the beginning of the next decade the Occidental community was established in Germany, Austria, Sweden, Czechoslovakia and Switzerland.

=== Vienna period and World War II ===

The Vienna period was also marked by financial stability. With the help of two major backers, Hanns Hörbiger, also from Vienna, and G.A. Moore from London, &quot;Cosmoglotta&quot; thrived despite the economic crisis. After the two died in 1931, &quot;Cosmoglotta&quot; was again forced to rely on revenue from subscriptions and republications.

The growing movement began campaigning more assertively for Occidental in the early 1930s, leveraging its at-sight readability by contacting organizations such as companies, embassies, printing houses and the LON with letters entirely in Occidental that were often understood and answered. Recordings of spoken Occidental on gramophone records for distribution were first made in this period.

The years from 1935 to 1939 were particularly active for &quot;Cosmoglotta&quot; and a second edition of the journal was published. Originally entitled &quot;Cosmoglotta-Informationes&quot;, it was soon renamed &quot;Cosmoglotta B&quot;, focusing on items of more internal interest such as linguistic issues, reports of Occidental in the news, and financial updates. In early 1936, not counting the 110 issues of &quot;Cosmoglotta&quot; and other journals and bulletins, a total of 80 publications existed in and about Occidental.

But the years before World War II posed difficulties for Occidental and other planned languages. They were banned in Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia, forced to disband, and kept under surveillance by the Gestapo, which also destroyed instructional materials. The prohibition of auxiliary languages in Germany was particularly damaging as this was where most Occidentalists lived at the time. The inability to accept payment for subscriptions was a financial blow that continued after the war along with Germany&#x27;s division into zones of influence, not all of which allowed payments.

De Wahl, in Tallinn, was unable to communicate with the Occidental Union in Switzerland from 1939 to October 1947, first due to the war and thereafter the interception of mail between Switzerland and the Soviet Union. Unaware of this, de Wahl was bewildered at the lack of response to his continued letters; even a large collection of poetry translated into Occidental was never delivered. The only letter of his received in Switzerland came in 1947, asking the Occidental Union why it had not answered any of his. Meanwhile, de Wahl&#x27;s house and his entire library had been destroyed during the bombardment of Tallinn. De Wahl himself was incarcerated for a time after refusing to leave Estonia for Germany, and later took refuge in a psychiatric hospital where he lived out his life.

The outbreak of war in 1939 put a halt to publications of both &quot;Cosmoglotta&quot;s through 1940, but in 1941 &quot;Cosmoglotta B&quot; began publication once again and continued until 1950. An edition of either &quot;Cosmoglotta&quot; A or B was published every month between January 1937 and September 1939, and then (after the initial shock of the war) every month from September 1941 to June 1951. During the war, only those in neutral Switzerland and Sweden were able to fully devote themselves to the language, carrying on activities semi-officially.

During the war, Occidentalists noticed that the language was often permitted to be sent by telegram within and outside of Switzerland (especially to and from Sweden) even without official recognition, surmising that censors were able to understand it and may have thought them to be written in Spanish or Romansch (a small yet official Romance language in Switzerland). This allowed some communication to take place between the Occidentalists in Switzerland and Sweden. The other centres of Occidental activity in Europe did not fare as well, with the stocks of study materials in Vienna and Tallinn having been destroyed in bombings and numerous Occidentalists sent to concentration camps in Germany and Czechoslovakia.

Contacts were reestablished shortly after the war by those who remained, with letters from countries such as France, Czechoslovakia, Finland and Great Britain reaching &quot;Cosmoglotta&quot;. Writers said they were ready to begin activities anew for the language. &quot;Cosmoglotta&quot; had subscribers in 58 cities in Switzerland a few months before the end of World War II in Europe, and &quot;Cosmoglotta&quot; A began publication again in 1946.

===Language standardization===
During the war many Occidentalists took to standardizing the language. De Wahl had created Occidental with a number of unchangeable features, but believed that its following of the &quot;laws of life&quot; gave it a firm enough base that it could follow a &quot;natural evolution&quot; with a flexibility that would &quot;allow time and practice to take care of modifications that would prove to be necessary&quot;. As a result, some words had more than one permissible form, which could not be resolved by decree alone, thus leaving the ultimate decision to the community by including both possible forms in the first Occidental dictionaries. One example concerned the verb &quot;scrir&quot; (to write) and a possible other form &quot;scripter&quot;, as both created internationally recognizable derivations: &quot;scritura&quot; and &quot;scritor&quot; from &quot;scrir&quot;, or &quot;scriptura&quot; and &quot;scriptor&quot; from &quot;scripter.&quot; De Wahl expressed a preference for &quot;scrir&quot;, finding &quot;scripter&quot; to be somewhat heavy, but commented that the latter was certainly permissible and that Occidental might take on a similar evolution to natural languages in which both forms come into common use, with the longer form having a heavier and formal character and the shorter form a lighter and more everyday tone (such as English &quot;story&quot; vs. &quot;history&quot;).

Orthography was another area in which several possibilities existed, namely etymologic orthography (adtractiv, obpression), historic orthography (attractiv, oppression), or simplified orthography (atractiv, opression). The simplified orthography eventually became the standard by 1939. With questions still remaining about the official form of some words and a lack of general material destined for the general public, much time during World War II was spent on language standardization and course creation, and due to the continuing war, in August 1943 the decision was made to create an interim academy to officialize this process.

This process had just about begun not long before the war, and the Swiss Occidentalists, finding themselves isolated from the rest of the continent, opted to concentrate on instructional materials to have ready by the end of the war.

=== IALA, Interlingua, and name change to Interlingue ===
The International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA), founded in 1924 to study and determine the best planned language for international communication, was at first viewed with suspicion by the Occidental community. Its co-founder Alice Vanderbilt Morris was an Esperantist, as were many of its staff, and many Occidentalists including de Wahl himself believed that its leadership under Esperantist William Edward Collinson meant that it had been set up with a staff of professional linguists under a neutral and scientific pretext to bolster a final recommendation for Esperanto. Relations soon improved, however, as it became clear that the IALA intended to be as impartial as possible by familiarizing itself with all existing planned languages. Ric Berger, a prominent Occidentalist who later joined Interlingua in the 1950s, made a personal visit to Morris in 1935 in which she and her husband showed a curiosity for Occidental and invited him to speak in the language, vastly improving Berger&#x27;s opinion of the organization.

In 1945, the IALA announced that it planned to create its own language and showed four possible versions under consideration, all of which were naturalistic as opposed to schematic. Occidentalists were by and large pleased that the IALA had decided to create a language so similar in nature to Occidental, seeing it as a credible association that gave weight to their argument that an auxiliary language should proceed from study of natural languages instead of attempting to fit them into an artificial system. Ric Berger was particularly positive in describing the upcoming language as a victory for the natural school and &quot;almost the same language&quot; in 1948. Berger still had reservations, however, doubting whether a project with such a similar aspect and structure would be able to &quot;suddenly cause prejudices [against planned languages] to fall and create unity among the partisans of international languages&quot;. Berger also feared that it might simply &quot;disperse the partisans of the natural language with nothing to show for it&quot; after Occidental had created &quot;unity in the naturalistic school&quot; for so long.

While the two languages had a 90 per cent identical vocabulary without orthographic differences taken into account (e.g. with &quot;filosofie&quot; and &quot;philosophia&quot; considered the same word), structurally and derivationally they were very different. De Wahl&#x27;s Rule in Occidental had mostly done away with Latin double stem verbs (verbs such as act: &quot;ager&quot;, &quot;act&quot;- or send: &quot;mitter&quot;, &quot;miss&quot;-), while Interlingua simply accepted them as part and parcel of a naturalistic system. The control languages (Italian, Spanish and/or Portuguese, French, English) used by Interlingua to form its vocabulary for the most part require an eligible word to be found in three source languages (the &quot;rule of three&quot;), which would conflict with Occidental&#x27;s Germanic substrate and various other words which would be by definition ineligible in a unified language that retained Interlingua&#x27;s methodology. Interlingua also allowed optional irregular verbal conjugations such as &quot;so,&quot; &quot;son&quot; and &quot;sia&quot; as the first-person singular, third-person plural and subjunctive form of &quot;esser&quot;, the verb &#x27;to be&#x27;.

Occidental was also still recovering from the war. &quot;Cosmoglotta&quot; continued to report into 1946 on who had survived the war, who among them were ready to participate again and those who were still out of touch. The magazine was financially strained by inflated postwar printing costs and its inability to collect payments from certain countries, a marked contrast to the well-funded New York-based IALA.

International politics was another difficulty for Occidentalists after the war. The beginning of the Cold War created an uncomfortable situation for the Occidental-Union, whose name unfortunately coincided with that of an anti-Russian political league; the Swiss Occidentalists believed that was why all of de Wahl&#x27;s letters from Tallinn were intercepted. De Wahl remained unaware of developments in the language and the proposal for the rest of his life. In early 1948 the Czechoslovak Occidentalists had begun requesting a new name that would allow them to continue their linguistic activities without suspicion, proposing the name Interal (International auxiliari lingue), to which the union responded that the term &quot;Interlingue&quot; would be more appropriate and that they were free to introduce the language as &quot;Interlingue (Occidental)&quot;, or even remove the mention of Occidental in parentheses if they wanted. Ric Berger began advocating for a change of name from Occidental to Interlingue in 1948 which he also hoped would aid in a fusion between the two languages. The official vote on the name change to Interlingue took place in 1949 and was passed with 91 per cent support, making the official name Interlingue, with Interlingue (Occidental) also permitted, starting September 1949.

The 1951 debut of Interlingua weakened Interlingue-Occidental, which until then had been unchallenged in the field of naturalistic planned auxiliary languages. Vĕra Barandovská-Frank&#x27;s perception of the situation at the time was as follows (translated from Esperanto):

Don Harlow similarly summarizes the year 1951 for Occidental:
=== Stagnation and revival ===

While the migration of so many users to Interlingua had severely weakened Interlingue, the ensuing drop in activity was gradual and took place over decades. &quot;Cosmoglotta B&quot; ceased publication after 1950, and the frequency of &quot;Cosmoglotta A&quot; began to gradually drop: once every second month from 1952, and then once per quarter from 1963. Other bulletins in Interlingue continued to appear during this time such as &quot;Cive del Munde&quot; (Switzerland), &quot;Voce de Praha&quot; (Czechoslovakia), &quot;Sved Interlinguist&quot; (Sweden), &quot;International Memorandum&quot; (United Kingdom), &quot;Interlinguistic Novas&quot; (France), &quot;Jurnale Scolari International&quot; (France), &quot;Buletine Pedagogic International&quot; (France), &quot;Super li Frontieras&quot; (France), &quot;Interlingue-Postillon&quot; (1958, Germany), &quot;Novas de Oriente&quot; (1958, Japan), &quot;Amicitie european&quot; (1959, Switzerland), &quot;Teorie e practica&quot; (Switzerland-Czechoslovakia, 1967), and &quot;Novas in Interlingue&quot; (Czechoslovakia, 1971). Barandovská-Frank believed that the ebb in interest in Occidental-Interlingue occurred in concert with the aging of the generation that was first drawn to it from other planned languages:

Activity in Interlingue reached a low during the 1980s and early 1990s, when &quot;Cosmoglotta&quot; publication ceased for a few years. While issue 269 was published in 1972 after publishing once per season between 1963, issue 289 was not reached until summer 2000 for an average of less than one issue per year. According to Harlow, &quot;in 1985 Occidental&#x27;s last periodical, &quot;Cosmoglotta&quot;, ceased publication, and its editor, Mr. Adrian Pilgrim, is quoted as having described Occidental as a &#x27;dead language.&#x27;&quot; A decade later, a documentary film in 1994 by Steve Hawley and Steyger on planned languages introduced Interlingue speaker Donald Gasper as &quot;one of the last remaining speakers of the language Occidental&quot;.

As was the case for other planned languages, the arrival of the Internet spurred Interlingue&#x27;s revival. In the year 1999 the first Yahoo! Group in Occidental was founded, &quot;Cosmoglotta&quot; had begun publishing intermittently again, and the language became a subject of discussion in literature on auxiliary languages. One example is &quot;The Esperanto Book&quot; released in 1995 by Harlow, who wrote that Occidental had an intentional emphasis on European forms and that some of its leading followers espoused a Eurocentric philosophy, which may have hindered its spread. Still, the opposite view was also common in the community and Occidental gained adherents in many nations including Asian nations. An Interlingue Wikipedia was approved in 2004. In recent years official meetings of Interlingue speakers have resumed: one in Ulm in 2013, another in Munich in 2014 with three participants, and a third in Ulm the next year with five.

The most recent edition of &quot;Cosmoglotta&quot; is volume 333, for the period from January to June 2024.

Recent years have shown new books published in Interlingue such as &quot;The Little Prince&quot;, the Gospel of Mark, , and works including &quot;Li sercha in li castelle Dewahl e altri racontas&quot;, &quot;Antologie hispan,&quot; and &quot;Fabules, racontas e mites&quot;.

== Language philosophy ==

De Wahl was first introduced to planned languages through Volapük, an international auxiliary language released in 1879. De Wahl later became one of the earliest users of Esperanto (&quot;la lingvo internacia&quot;), which he encountered for the first time in 1888 during his period as a Volapükist and for which he was in the process of composing a dictionary of marine terms. He quickly became a fervent supporter of Esperanto for a number of years in which he collaborated with Zamenhof on some parts of the language&#x27;s design and translated one of the first works into Esperanto: &quot;Princidino Mary&quot;, published in 1889 originally under the name Princino Mary. He remained an Esperantist until 1894 when the vote to reform Esperanto failed; he was one of just two that voted neither for Esperanto unchanged, nor for the reform proposed by Zamenhof, but for a completely new reform. Occidental would not be announced for a full 28 years after de Wahl had abandoned Esperanto, a period in which he spent working with other language creators trying to develop a system that combined naturalism and regularity, a combination that became a frequently referenced selling point in the promotion of Occidental.

Among those de Wahl worked with while developing Occidental were Waldemar Rosenberger (Idiom Neutral), Julius Lott (Mundolingue), and Antoni Grabowski (Modern Latin for a time, before returning to Esperanto). The method sought after by these &quot;partisans of naturalism&quot; was the distillation of existing words into their parts to obtain the international roots within them (such as naturalisation to nat-ur-al-is-ation), then used in other words to keep root words to a minimum while maintaining a natural appearance. This decomposition of existing words gave rise to a large number of affixes. For example, just those used to form nouns referring to a type of person are as follows: &quot;-er-&quot; (&quot;molinero&quot; – miller), &quot;-or-&quot; (&quot;redactor&quot; – editor), &quot;-ari-&quot; (&quot;millionario&quot; – millionaire), &quot;-on-&quot; (&quot;spion&quot;, spy), &quot;-ard&quot; (&quot;mentard&quot;, liar), &quot;-astr-&quot; (&quot;poetastro&quot;, lousy poet), &quot;-es&quot; (&quot;franceso&quot;, Frenchman), &quot;-essa&quot; (&quot;reyessa&quot;, queen). In de Wahl&#x27;s opinion it was always preferable to opt for a productive suffix than to be forced to coin new words from completely new radicals later on. In addition to this, de Wahl&#x27;s rule developed later allowed for regular derivation from double-stem Latin verbs.

The Delegation for the Adoption of an International Auxiliary Language, a body of academics formed to study the problem of an international language and which recommended Esperanto with reforms (leading to the language known as Ido), occurred in 1907 before Occidental was announced. De Wahl thus chose to send a memorandum of principles on which to base an international language, a memorandum which arrived after the committee had already adjourned. It was only noted in passing by Louis Couturat, who was already familiar with de Wahl and his collaborators. The principles stated in the memorandum are listed in a request for the committee to declare:
De Wahl published in 1922 a modification of Otto Jespersen&#x27;s principle that &quot;That international language is best which in every point offers the greatest facility to the greatest number&quot;, stating that the international language should be easiest for the majority of those &quot;who must apply it&quot;, or in other words those that need it in international relations. De Wahl believed that the number of speakers did not always need to be taken into account, particularly in specialized areas such as botany where for example the term Oenethera biennis (a type of plant) should be implemented unchanged in an international language even if the entire world population of botanists, those most often familiar with and likely to use the word, did not exceed 10,000.

This also implied that words belonging to particular cultures should be imported without modifications, which De Wahl believed brought new ideas of value to European culture that had become &quot;sick&quot; after World War I. He cited the terms &quot;karma&quot;, &quot;ko-tau&quot; (kowtow), &quot;geisha&quot;, and &quot;mahdí&quot; in 1924 as examples of those that should not be put in a &quot;vocalic corset&quot; through obligatory endings (e.g. &quot;karmo, koŭtoŭo,&quot; &quot;gejŝo, madho&quot; in Esperanto&quot;)&quot; when imported into the international language:

In an article on the future development of language, de Wahl wrote in 1927 that due to European dominance in the sciences and other areas Occidental required a form and derivation recognizable to Europeans, but that it should also be fitted with a grammatical structure capable of taking on more analytical, non-derived forms in the future (such as the equivalents of &quot;bake man&quot; for &quot;baker&quot; or &quot;wise way&quot; for &quot;wisdom&quot;) if worldwide linguistic trends began to show a preference for them.

De Wahl believed that there was a fine balance to be maintained between schematic regularity versus naturalism in an international language, where too much of the former may be convenient for the early learner but abhorrent for a speaker, and vice versa:
While primarily Romance in vocabulary, de Wahl opted for a large Germanic substrate which he felt was more expressive for technical and material vocabulary (self, ost (east), svimmar (to swim), moss, etc.), with Romance and Greek vocabulary more appropriate in the derivation of international words (fémina for woman to form feminin, can for dog to form canin (canine), etc.) as well as mental, corporal and natural conceptions. Minor Romance languages such as Ladin, Provençal (Occitan) and Catalan along with creoles were important in the development of Occidental for de Wahl, who wrote as early as 1912 that his language under development was more similar to Provençal than Italian or Spanish. The Swiss magazine &quot;Der Landbote&quot; made a similar comment while reviewing the language in 1945, commenting humorously that &quot;reading through the few examples of Occidental gives us the impression of a half-learned Catalan by a foreigner who doesn&#x27;t much understand the grammar.&quot;

De Wahl stressed that Occidental&#x27;s natural appearance did not imply wholesale importation of national expressions and usage, and warned that doing so would lead to chaos. One of his articles on this subject was directed toward English and French users who he believed incorrectly saw Occidental as a mix of the two: &quot;(Occidental&#x27;s chaotic appearance) is not the fault of Occidental itself, but rather that of its users and especially the French and English, or those that think that the international language should be a mixture of those two languages [...] that is a fundamental error, especially if these forms present exceptions and irregularities in Occidental&#x27;s system.&quot; Alphonse Matejka wrote in &quot;Cosmoglotta&quot; that de Wahl &quot;always claimed a minimum of autonomy for his language and bitterly fought against all propositions that intended to augment the naturalism of the language only by blindly imitating the Romance languages, or as de Wahl said crudely in one of his letters to me, &#x27;by aping French or English&#x27;&quot;.

Occidental&#x27;s erring on the side of regularity led to vocabulary that was still recognizable but different from the international norm, such as ínpossibil in place of impossibil (ín + poss + ibil), scientic (scientific, from scient-ie + -ic), and descrition (description, from descri-r + -tion). This is one of the greatest differences between it and Interlingua, which has a vocabulary taken from so-called &#x27;prototypes&#x27; (the most recent common ancestor to its source languages) while Interlingue/Occidental focused on active, spontaneous derivation. Vocabulary was deemed technically permissible even if it did not match forms in other living languages, with these derived words described as &quot;forms that living languages would have been able to produce using their own means&quot;.

=== Vocabulary ===
Though seemingly favourable to the Romance language family, de Wahl did not see Occidental as a Romance language and did not tolerate any nationalism or chauvinism in the choice of words for the language. His opinion on justice in the choice of vocabulary was that: &quot;However many special, new, significant words each [culture] has respectively added to the common human culture, that much they receive.&quot; In an article entitled &quot;International o Romanic&quot; (International or Romance) in 1929, he gave examples from a number of categories in which particular languages had a particularly large influence. Those included Greek for science and philosophy (teorema, teosofie, astronomie), Latin for politics and law (social, republica, commission), Scandinavian, Dutch and English for navigation (log, fregatte, mast, brigg, bote), and various other international vocabulary originating in other languages (sabat, alcohol, sultan, divan, nirvana, orang-utan, bushido, té, dalai-lama, cigar, jazz, zebra, bumerang, etc.).

=== Symbol ===
The symbol of Occidental and its dimensions were chosen in 1936 after some deliberation and many other proposed symbols that included stylized letters, a star (as in Esperanto and Ido), a setting sun to represent the sun in the west (the Occident), a globe, and more. The tilde, already used by the Occidental-Union, was eventually selected based on five criteria: symbolic character, simplicity, originality, unlikeliness to be confused with another symbol, and for being bichromatic (having two colours) as opposed to polychromatic. Beyond the five criteria, the Occidentalists at the time referenced the advantages of the lack of a fixed meaning for the tilde in the public sphere, and its similarity to a waveform, implying speech.

==Linguistic features==
=== Orthography ===
Interlingue is written with 26 Latin letters: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, and z. The names of the letters are &quot;a, be, ce, de, e, ef, ge, ha, i, jot, ka, el, em, en, o, pe, qu, er, es, te, u, ve, duplic ve, ix, ypsilon&quot;, and &quot;zet&quot;. Accents are written on the five vowels to indicate irregular stress, with the acute accent (á é í ó ú) preferred, but others (è, ê, etc.) permitted.

===Phonology===
==== Vowels ====
Sources on the pronunciations of the vowels are contradictory. Some say that the vowels have their Continental values (that is, [a e i o u]), others that they have different qualities when long and short; they also differ on the number of diphthongs (e.g. &quot;au eu ay ey&quot;). Earlier texts on Occidental described seven vowels (the five continental vowels plus y like , namely French &quot;u&quot; or German &quot;ü&quot;, and &quot;eu&quot; as German &quot;ö&quot;), but by the 1940s the official recommendation was that vocalic &quot;y&quot; be pronounced like &quot;i&quot; and eu as a diphthong instead of &quot;ö&quot;. Rough English equivalents for the vowels are as follows:

* a as in French, German, Spanish or Italian, or English father.
* e open or closed, as German, Spanish or Italian, or English bed and yes.
* i as French, German, Spanish and Italian, or English machine.
* o open or closed as in French, German, Spanish and Italian, or English door, hot.
* u as in German, Spanish and Italian, or English rule, pull. U after q is a short, almost consonantal (w).
* y is a consonant after a vowel or beginning a word before a vowel, otherwise is pronounced as i.

Interlingue has non-obligatory vowel length. Rough English equivalents of the sounds are as follows:

*short a is /æ/ as in &quot;pat&quot;
*short e is /ɛ/ as in &quot;pet&quot;
*short i is /ɪ/ as in &quot;pit&quot;
*short o is /ɒ/ as in &quot;pot&quot;
*short u is /ʊ/ as in &quot;put&quot;

Vowels are short in the following cases:

# Vowels are short in unstressed syllables (Accented vowels tend to be long: e in idé, o in sonori, a in dramatic)
# Vowels are short when followed by two consonants (unless the second consonant is codice_1 or codice_2 a preceding stressed vowel is long)
# Vowels before a final c, ch or x
# Vowels in short grammatical particles tend to be short

Examples of long vowels: &quot;pur&quot;, &quot;robe&quot;, &quot;blu&quot;, &quot;fibre&quot;, &quot;table&quot;.

Examples of short vowels: &quot;calm&quot;, &quot;old&quot;, &quot;potte&quot;, &quot;flagga&quot;, &quot;mann&quot;, &quot;fox&quot;, &quot;storc&quot;, &quot;in&quot;, &quot;it&quot;.

==== Consonants ====

The consonants are pronounced as in English, with the following exceptions:
*c when before e and i = [ts]: &quot;cive&quot;, &quot;helice&quot;, and otherwise as [k]
*g when before e and i = [ʒ], French j, or English s in pleasure: &quot;plage, giraffe&quot;; but elsewhere c and g are hard as in can, go
*ss = [s] as in &quot;pass&quot;
*s between vowels = [z]: &quot;rose, positiv&quot;
*z = [dz]
*zz = [ts]
*ch = [ʃ], English sh: &quot;chambre&quot;
*j = [ʒ], French j, or English s in pleasure
*t as [t], except when followed by ia, io, iu, or ie and not preceded by an s. Thus the t in &quot;nation&quot; is pronounced [ts] but in &quot;bastion&quot; as [t].

Other doubled consonants are pronounced as a single consonant, unless when separated they would be pronounced differently. Ex. grammatica is pronounced as if written gramatica, but acceptar and suggestion are pronounced as if written as ac followed by ceptar, and sug followed by gestion.

===Stress===

Words are generally stressed on the vowel before the final consonant: intercalar, parol, forme. Pluralizing a noun does not change the stress: paroles, formes. The endings -bil, -ic, -im, -ul and -um do not change the stress (even when more than one is present in a single word), nor does the adverbial ending -men: rapidmen, duplic, bonissim, singul, possibil, maximum, statisticas. Two vowels together are diphthongized and do not count as two syllables for the purpose of stress: familie, potentie, unless the word is a single consonant or consonant cluster followed by two vowels: die, deo. Compound words are stressed based on the last word in the compound: hodie, substrae. In cases where the accent is irregular, it is indicated by an accent: café, ínpossibil, numeró, númere, felicitá. The accent mark may also be used for emphasis as needed: Yó ea con la (ne tú).

=== Grammar ===
==== Articles ====
Like English, Interlingue has definite and an indefinite articles. The definite article (the) is &quot;li&quot;, and the indefinite (a, an) is &quot;un&quot;. Plural of a noun is made by adding &quot;-s&quot; after a vowel, or &quot;-es&quot; after most consonants. To avoid pronunciation and stress changes, words ending in -c, -g, and -m only add an -s: un libre, du libres, li tric, li trics, li plug, li plugs, li album, pluri albums.

The ending of the definite article can be modified to lo (masculine), la (feminine), lu (neuter), lis (plural), los (masculine plural), e las (feminine plural). The article itself can also be pluralized before words that are difficult to pluralize on their own: lis s (the s&#x27;s).

==== Personal pronouns ====
Interlingue has two forms for the personal pronouns: one for the subject form (nominative), and one for the object form (accusative or dative, i.e. the oblique form):
The formal second person is &quot;vu&quot;, which is also the second person plural. The indefinite personal pronoun &quot;one&quot; is &quot;on&quot;. One can also specify the gender of third person plural by using &quot;illos&quot; (masculine) or e&quot;llas&quot; (feminine).

==== Grammatical endings ====
Only a few parts of speech in Interlingue (such as verbs in the infinitive) have entirely obligatory endings, while many other endings are optional though sometimes recommended. Some grammatical endings are:

*ar, er, ir: verb infinitive. far (to do), posser (be able), scrir (to write)
*e: the general substantival (noun) ending. Used obligatorily to differentiate nouns from other parts or speech, for reasons of pronunciation, or optionally for euphony.
*i: the general adjectival ending, similar to -e in usage.
*a: nouns that end in e formed from an -ar verb are often written with the -a ending if one wishes to emphasize the verbal (active) aspect. The a ending also makes nouns feminine: anglese (English person), angleso (Englishman), anglesa (English woman). This does not apply to nouns that on their own indicate the gender (patre, matre).
*o: indicates the masculine gender in the same way a indicates the feminine.

==== Correlatives ====
While correlatives were not made to match a pre-determined scheme (such as the correlatives in Esperanto), the majority match the prefixes and suffixes in the chart below.

Notes on the correlatives:

Alcun (some) and necun (no, none) are respectively the adjectives of alquel and nequel.

The -al series is adverbialized with the -men ending: qualmen (how) talmen (that way).

Correlatives can take the plural ending: queles, quales, tis, omnis, etc.

Ci (here) and ta (there) can be affixed to ti and to to indicate proximity or distance: ti libre (this book), ti-ci libre (this book here), ti-ta libre (that book there), tis (these), tis-ci (these here), tis-ta (those there), to-ci (this here), to-ta (that there).

Many derivatives are formed from the correlatives: qualitá from qual + itá, quantitá from quant + -itá, omnipotent from omni + potent.

==== Verbs ====
Verbs in Interlingue have three endings: -ar, -er, and -ir. Conjugation is performed with a combination of endings and auxiliary verbs. The verb esser (to be) is exceptional in being written es in the present tense, while the esse form is the imperative.


The present participle is used to qualify nouns: un cat ama, un amant cat (a cat loves, a loving cat) and is often seen in adjectives such as fatigant (tiring, from fatigar, to tire). The gerund is used to indicate another action or state of being going on at the same time: scriente un missage, yo videt que... (writing a message, I saw that...).

==== Adverbs ====
Interlingue has primary adverbs and derived adverbs. Primary adverbs are not generated from other parts of speech and are thus not formed using any special endings: &quot;tre&quot; (very), &quot;sempre&quot; (always), etc.

Derived adverbs are formed by adding the suffix -men to an adjective (rapid = quick, rapidmen = quickly) Adjectives may be used as adverbs when the sense is clear:

Il ha bon laborat = He has worked well (&quot;He has worked good&quot;)

Noi serchat long = We looked for a long time (&quot;We searched long&quot;)

==== Derivation ====
The application of de Wahl&#x27;s rule to verbs, and the usage of numerous suffixes and prefixes, was created to resolve irregularities that had plagued creators of language projects before Occidental, who were forced to make the choice between regularity and unnatural forms, or irregularity and natural forms. The prevailing view before its application was that natural forms needed to be sacrificed for the sake of regularity, while those that opted for naturalism were forced to admit numerous irregularities when doing so (Idiom Neutral for example had a list of 81 verbs with special radicals used when forming derivatives), a paradox summed up by Louis Couturat in 1903 as follows:

In short, one finds oneself confronted by the antinomy that the words that are international are not regular, and the words that are regular are not international; the prevailing opinion [of naturalists such as Julius Lott and de Wahl] was that regularity should be sacrificed for internationality in the formation of words.

The rules created by de Wahl to resolve this were first described in 1909 in the &quot;Discussiones&quot; of Peano&#x27;s Academia pro Interlingua and are as follows:

#If, after the removal of -r or -er of the infinitive, the root ends in a vowel, the final -t is added. Crear (to create), crea/t-, crea/t/or, crea/t/ion, crea/t/iv, crea/t/ura.
#If the root ends in consonants d or r, they are changed into s: decid/er (to decide), deci/s-, deci/s/ion deci/s/iv. Adherer (to adhere), adhe/s-, adhe/s/ion
#In all other cases, with six exceptions, the removal of the ending gives the exact root: duct/er, duct-, duct/ion.

Once these rules were applied, Occidental was left with six exceptions. They are:

#ced/er, cess- (concession)
#sed/er, sess- (session)
#mov/er, mot- (motion)
#ten/er, tent- (temptation)
#vert/er, vers- (version)
#veni/r, vent- (advent)

Suffixes are added either to the verbal root or the present theme of the verb (the infinitive minus -r). An example of the latter is the suffix -ment: move/r, move/ment (not movetment), experi/r, experi/ment (not experitment), and -ntie (English -nce): tolera/r (tolerate), tolera/ntie, existe/r (exist), existe/ntie.

==== Affixes ====
The major prefixes and suffixes used in word derivation in Interlingue are added to either the present theme (infinitive minus -r), verbal root (infinitive minus two preceding vowels), or perfect theme (present theme + t or +s for verbs finishing with -d or -r) of verbs, as well as other types of speech. Some of the affixes used are:

== Ease of learning ==
As an international auxiliary language, ease of learning through regular derivation and recognizable vocabulary was a key principle in Occidental&#x27;s creation. &quot;Cosmoglotta&quot; often featured letters from new users and former users of other international languages (primarily Esperanto and Ido) attesting to the language&#x27;s simplicity. New users demonstrated their quick command of the language, and experienced auxiliary language users shared their experiences. Because many users of the language had encountered it after first learning Esperanto, data on learnability of the language for those without experience in other international auxiliary languages is scarce. One experiment to ascertain learning time was carried out in the years 1956 to 1957 in a Swiss Catholic high school (gymnasium) in Disentis on the time required to learn the language. The experiment showed that the students participating in the study, who had previous experience with French, Latin, and Greek, mastered both written and spoken Interlingue after 30 hours of study.
Some original texts published as separate books are:
* &quot;Krasina, raconta del subterrania del Moravian carst&quot;, published in 1938 by Jan Amos Kajš.
* &quot;Li astres del Verne&quot;, a collection of original poetry by Jaroslav Podobský, published both in 1935 and 1947.

==Example texts==
Possible pronunciation: 

Translation: &quot;Material civilization, science, and even art unify themselves more and more. The educated European feels himself almost at home in all lands that have European civilization, that is, more and more, in the entire world. Today almost all states war with the same armaments. Without pause the modes of intercommunication improve, and in consequence from that the world seems to decrease. A Parisian is now closer to an Englishman or a German than he was a hundred years before to a French peasant.&quot;

<text>Osiris (, from Egyptian &quot;&quot;) was the god of fertility, agriculture, the afterlife, the dead, resurrection, life, and vegetation in ancient Egyptian religion. He was classically depicted as a green-skinned deity with a pharaoh&#x27;s beard, partially mummy-wrapped at the legs, wearing a distinctive atef crown, and holding a symbolic crook and flail. He was one of the first to be associated with the mummy wrap. When his brother Set cut him up into pieces after killing him, with her sister Nephthys, Osiris&#x27; sister-wife, Isis, searched all over Egypt to find each part of Osiris. She collected all but one – Osiris’s genitalia. She then wrapped his body up, enabling him to return to life. Osiris was widely worshipped until the decline of ancient Egyptian religion during the rise of Christianity in the Roman Empire.

Osiris was at times considered the eldest son of the earth god Geb and the sky goddess Nut, as well as being brother and husband of Isis, and brother of Set, Nephthys, and Horus the Elder, with Horus the Younger being considered his posthumously begotten son. Through syncretism with Iah, he was also a god of the Moon.

Osiris was the judge and lord of the dead and the underworld, the &quot;Lord of Silence&quot; and Khenti-Amentiu, meaning &quot;Foremost of the Westerners&quot;. In the Old Kingdom (2686–2181 BC) the pharaoh was considered a son of the sun god Ra who, after his death, ascended to join Ra in the sky. After the spread of the Osiris cult, however, the kings of Egypt were associated with Osiris in death – as Osiris rose from the dead, they would unite with him and inherit eternal life through imitative magic.

Through the hope of new life after death, Osiris began to be associated with the cycles in nature, in particular the sprouting of vegetation and the annual flooding of the Nile River, as well as the heliacal rising of Orion and Sirius at the start of the new year. He became the sovereign that granted all life, &quot;He Who is Permanently Benign and Youthful&quot;.

The first evidence of the worship of Osiris is from the middle of the Fifth Dynasty of Egypt (25th century BC), although it is likely that he was worshiped much earlier; the Khenti-Amentiu epithet dates to at least the First Dynasty, and was also used as a pharaonic title. Most information available on the Osiris myth is derived from allusions in the Pyramid Texts at the end of the Fifth Dynasty, later New Kingdom source documents such as the Shabaka Stone and &quot;The Contendings of Horus and Seth&quot;, and much later, in the narratives of Greek authors including Plutarch and Diodorus Siculus.

Some Egyptologists believe the Osiris mythos may have originated in a former living ruler — possibly a shepherd who lived in Predynastic times (5500–3100 BC) in the Nile Delta, whose beneficial rule led to him being revered as a god. The accoutrements of the shepherd, the crook and the flail – once insignia of the Delta god Andjety, with whom Osiris was associated – support this theory.

==Etymology of the name==

&quot;Osiris&quot; is a Latin transliteration of the Ancient Greek , which in turn is the Greek adaptation of the original name in the Egyptian language. In Egyptian hieroglyphs the name appears as &quot;&quot;, which some Egyptologists instead choose to transliterate as &quot;ꜣsjr&quot; or &quot;jsjrj&quot;. Since hieroglyphic writing lacks vowels, Egyptologists have vocalized the name in various ways, such as Asar, Ausar, Ausir, Wesir, Usir, or Usire.

Several proposals have been made for the etymology and meaning of the original name; as Egyptologist Mark J. Smith notes, none are fully convincing. Most take &quot;wsjr&quot; as the accepted transliteration, following Adolf Erman:

* John Gwyn Griffiths (1980), &quot;bearing in mind Erman&#x27;s emphasis on the fact that the name must begin with an [sic] &quot;w&quot;&quot;, proposes a derivation from &quot;&quot; with an original meaning of &quot;The Mighty One&quot;.
* Kurt Sethe (1930) proposes a compound &quot;-&quot;, meaning &quot;seat of the eye&quot;, in a hypothetical earlier form &quot;*wst-jrt&quot;; this is rejected by Griffiths on phonetic grounds.
* David Lorton (1985) takes up this same compound but explains &quot;st-jrt&quot; as signifying &quot;product, something made&quot;, Osiris representing the product of the ritual mummification process.
* Wolfhart Westendorf (1987) proposes an etymology from &quot;-&quot; &quot;she who bears the eye&quot;.
* Mark J. Smith (2017) makes no definitive proposals but asserts that the second element must be a form of &quot;&quot; (&quot;to do, make&quot;) (rather than &quot;&quot; (&quot;eye&quot;)).

However, recently alternative transliterations have been proposed:

* Yoshi Muchiki (1990) reexamines Erman&#x27;s evidence that the throne hieroglyph in the word is to be read &quot;ws&quot; and finds it unconvincing, suggesting instead that the name should be read &quot;ꜣsjr&quot; on the basis of Aramaic, Phoenician, and Old South Arabian transcriptions, readings of the throne sign in other words, and comparison with &quot;&quot; (&quot;Isis&quot;).
* James P. Allen (2000) reads the word as &quot;&quot; but revises the reading (2013) to &quot;&quot; and derives it from &quot;-&quot;, meaning &quot;engendering (male) principle&quot;.

==Appearance==

Osiris is represented in his most developed form of iconography wearing the &quot;Atef&quot; crown, which is similar to the White crown of Upper Egypt, but with the addition of two curling ostrich feathers at each side. He also carries the crook and flail. The crook is thought to represent Osiris as a shepherd god. The symbolism of the flail is more uncertain with shepherd&#x27;s whip, fly-whisk, or association with the god Andjety of the ninth nome of Lower Egypt proposed.

He was commonly depicted as a pharaoh with a complexion of either green (the color of rebirth) or black (alluding to the fertility of the Nile floodplain) in mummiform (wearing the trappings of mummification from chest downward).

==Early mythology==

The Pyramid Texts describe early conceptions of an afterlife in terms of eternal travelling with the sun god amongst the stars. Amongst these mortuary texts, at the beginning of the Fourth Dynasty, is found: &quot;An offering the king gives and Anubis&quot;. By the end of the Fifth Dynasty, the formula in all tombs becomes &quot;An offering the king gives and Osiris&quot;.

===Father of Horus===
Osiris is the mythological father of the god Horus, whose conception is described in the Osiris myth (a central myth in ancient Egyptian belief). The myth describes Osiris as having been killed by his brother Set, who wanted Osiris&#x27; throne. His wife, Isis, finds the body of Osiris and hides it in the reeds where it is found and dismembered by Set. Isis retrieves and joins the fragmented pieces of Osiris, then briefly revives him by use of magic. This spell gives her time to become pregnant by Osiris. Isis later gives birth to Horus. Since Horus was born after Osiris&#x27; resurrection, Horus became thought of as a representation of new beginnings and the vanquisher of the usurper Set.

&quot;Ptah-Seker&quot; (who resulted from the identification of the creator god Ptah with Seker) thus gradually became identified with Osiris, the two becoming Ptah-Seker-Osiris. As the sun was thought to spend the night in the underworld, and was subsequently &quot;reborn&quot; every morning, Ptah-Seker-Osiris was identified as king of the underworld, god of the afterlife, life, death, and regeneration. Osiris also has the aspect and form of Seker-Osiris.

===Ram god===

Osiris&#x27; soul, or rather his &quot;ba&quot;, was occasionally worshipped in its own right, almost as if it were a distinct god, especially in the Delta city of Mendes. This aspect of Osiris was referred to as &quot;Banebdjedet&quot;, which is grammatically feminine (also spelt &quot;&quot;Banebded&quot; or &quot;Banebdjed&quot;&quot;), literally &quot;the &quot;ba&quot; of the lord of the &quot;djed&quot;, which roughly means &quot;The soul of the lord of the pillar&quot;. The &quot;djed&quot;, a type of pillar, was usually understood as the backbone of Osiris.

The Nile supplying water, and Osiris (strongly connected to the vegetable regeneration) who died only to be resurrected, represented continuity and stability. As &quot;Banebdjed&quot;, Osiris was given epithets such as &quot;Lord of the Sky&quot; and &quot;Life of the (sun god) Ra&quot;. &quot;Ba&quot; does not mean &quot;soul&quot; in the western sense, and has to do with power, reputation, force of character, especially in the case of a god.

Since the &quot;ba&quot; was associated with power, and also happened to be a word for ram in Egyptian, Banebdjed was depicted as a ram, or as Ram-headed. A living, sacred ram was kept at Mendes and worshipped as the incarnation of the god, and upon death, the rams were mummified and buried in a ram-specific necropolis. Banebdjed was consequently said to be Horus&#x27; father, as Banebdjed was an aspect of Osiris.

Regarding the association of Osiris with the ram, the god&#x27;s traditional crook and flail are the instruments of the shepherd, which has suggested to some scholars also an origin for Osiris in herding tribes of the upper Nile.

==Mythology==
Plutarch recounts one version of the Osiris myth in which Set (Osiris&#x27; brother), along with the Queen of Ethiopia, conspired with 72 accomplices to plot the assassination of Osiris. Set fooled Osiris into getting into a box, which Set then shut, sealed with lead, and threw into the Nile. Osiris&#x27; wife, Isis, searched for his remains until she finally found him embedded in a tamarisk tree trunk, which was holding up the roof of a palace in Byblos on the Phoenician coast. She managed to remove the coffin and retrieve her husband&#x27;s body.

In one version of the myth, Isis used a spell to briefly revive Osiris so he could impregnate her. After embalming and burying Osiris, Isis conceived and gave birth to their son, Horus. Thereafter Osiris lived on as the god of the underworld. Because of his death and resurrection, Osiris was associated with the flooding and retreating of the Nile and thus with the yearly growth and death of crops along the Nile valley.

Diodorus Siculus gives another version of the myth in which Osiris was described as an ancient king who taught the Egyptians the arts of civilization, including agriculture, then travelled the world with his sister Isis, the satyrs, and the nine muses, before finally returning to Egypt. Osiris was then murdered by his evil brother Typhon, who was identified with Set. Typhon divided the body into twenty-six pieces, which he distributed amongst his fellow conspirators in order to implicate them in the murder. Isis and Hercules (Horus) avenged the death of Osiris and slew Typhon. Isis recovered all the parts of Osiris&#x27; body, except the phallus, and secretly buried them. She made replicas of them and distributed them to several locations, which then became centres of Osiris worship.

== Worship ==

Annual ceremonies were performed in honor of Osiris in various places across Egypt. Evidences of which were discovered during underwater archaeological excavations of Franck Goddio and his team in the sunken city of Thonis-Heracleion. These ceremonies were fertility rites which symbolised the resurrection of Osiris. Recent scholars emphasize &quot;the androgynous character of [Osiris&#x27;] fertility&quot; clear from surviving material. For instance, Osiris&#x27; fertility has to come both from being castrated/cut-into-pieces and the reassembly by female Isis, whose embrace of her reassembled Osiris produces the perfect king, Horus. Further, as attested by tomb-inscriptions, both women and men could syncretize (identify) with Osiris at their death, another set of evidence that underlines Osiris&#x27; androgynous nature.

===Death or transition and institution as god of the afterlife===
Plutarch and others have noted that the sacrifices to Osiris were &quot;gloomy, solemn, and mournful...&quot; (Isis and Osiris, 69) and that the great mystery festival, celebrated in two phases, began at Abydos commemorating the death of the god, on the same day that grain was planted in the ground (Isis and Osiris, 13). The annual festival involved the construction of &quot;Osiris Beds&quot; formed in shape of Osiris, filled with soil and sown with seed. The germinating seed symbolized Osiris rising from the dead. An almost pristine example was found in the tomb of Tutankhamun. The imiut emblem- an image of a stuffed, headless skin of an animal tied to a pole mounting a pot, was a symbol associated both with Osiris as god of the underworld and with Anubis, god of mummification, was sometimes included among a deceased person&#x27;s funerary equipment.

The first phase of the festival was a public drama depicting the murder and dismemberment of Osiris, the search for his body by Isis, his triumphal return as the resurrected god, and the battle in which Horus defeated Set.

According to Julius Firmicus Maternus of the fourth century, this play was re-enacted each year by worshippers who &quot;beat their breasts and gashed their shoulders... When they pretend that the mutilated remains of the god have been found and rejoined...they turn from mourning to rejoicing.&quot; (&quot;De Errore Profanarum Religionum&quot;).

The passion of Osiris was reflected in his name &#x27;Wenennefer&quot; (&quot;the one who continues to be perfect&quot;), which also alludes to his post mortem power.

===Ikhernofret Stela===

Much of the extant information about the rites of Osiris can be found on the Ikhernofret Stela at Abydos erected in the Twelfth Dynasty by Ikhernofret, possibly a priest of Osiris or other official (the titles of Ikhernofret are described in his stela from Abydos) during the reign of Senwosret III (Pharaoh Sesostris, about 1875 BC). The ritual reenactment of Osiris&#x27;s funeral rites were held in the last month of the inundation (the annual Nile flood), coinciding with Spring, and held at Abydos which was the traditional place where the body of Osiris drifted ashore after having been drowned in the Nile.

The part of the myth recounting the chopping up of the body into 14 pieces by Set is not recounted in this particular stela. Although it is attested to be a part of the rituals by a version of the Papyrus Jumilhac, in which it took Isis 12 days to reassemble the pieces, coinciding with the festival of ploughing. Some elements of the ceremony were held in the temple, while others involved public participation in a form of theatre. The Stela of Ikhernofret recounts the programme of events of the public elements over the five days of the Festival:
* &quot;The First Day, The Procession of Wepwawet&quot;: A mock battle was enacted during which the enemies of Osiris are defeated. A procession was led by the god Wepwawet (&quot;opener of the way&quot;).
* &quot;The Second Day, The Great Procession of Osiris&quot;: The body of Osiris was taken from his temple to his tomb. The boat he was transported in, the &quot;Neshmet&quot; bark, had to be defended against his enemies.
* &quot;The Third Day:&quot; Osiris is mourned and the enemies of the land are destroyed.
* &quot;The Fourth Day, Night Vigil&quot;: Prayers and recitations are made and funeral rites performed.
* &quot;The Fifth Day, Osiris is Reborn&quot;: Osiris is reborn at dawn and crowned with the crown of Ma&#x27;at. The statue of Osiris is brought back to the temple.
===Wheat and clay rituals===
Contrasting with the public &quot;theatrical&quot; ceremonies sourced from the Middle Kingdom Ikhernofret Stele, more esoteric ceremonies were performed inside the temples by priests. Plutarch mentions that (for much later period) two days after the beginning of the festival &quot;the priests bring forth a sacred chest containing a small golden coffer, into which they pour some potable water...and a great shout arises from the company for joy that Osiris is found (or resurrected). Then they knead some fertile soil with the water...and fashion therefrom a crescent-shaped figure, which they cloth and adorn, this indicating that they regard these gods as the substance of Earth and Water.&quot; (&quot;Isis and Osiris,&quot; 39). Yet his accounts were still obscure, for he also wrote, &quot;I pass over the cutting of the wood&quot; – opting not to describe it, since he considered it as a most sacred ritual (&quot;Ibid.&quot; 21).

In the Osirian temple at Denderah, an inscription (translated by Budge, Chapter XV, Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection) describes in detail the making of wheat paste models of each dismembered piece of Osiris to be sent out to the town where each piece is discovered by Isis. At the temple of Mendes, figures of Osiris were made from wheat and paste placed in a trough on the day of the murder, then water was added for several days, until finally the mixture was kneaded into a mold of Osiris and taken to the temple to be buried (the sacred grain for these cakes were grown only in the temple fields). Molds were made from the wood of a red tree in the forms of the sixteen dismembered parts of Osiris, the cakes of &quot;divine&quot; bread were made from each mold, placed in a silver chest and set near the head of the god with &quot;the inward parts of Osiris&quot; as described in the Book of the Dead (XVII).
== Judgement ==

The idea of divine justice being exercised after death for wrongdoing during life is first encountered during the Old Kingdom in a Sixth Dynasty tomb containing fragments of what would be described later as the Negative Confessions performed in front of the 42 Assessors of Ma&#x27;at.

At death a person faced judgment by a tribunal of forty-two divine judges. If they led a life in conformance with the precepts of the goddess Ma&#x27;at, who represented truth and right living, the person was welcomed into the kingdom of Osiris. If found guilty, the person was thrown to the soul-eating demon Ammit and did not share in eternal life. The person who is taken by the devourer is subject first to terrifying punishment and then annihilated. These depictions of punishment may have influenced medieval perceptions of the inferno in hell via early Christian and Coptic texts. Purification for those who are considered justified may be found in the descriptions of &quot;Flame Island&quot;, where they experience the triumph over evil and rebirth. For the damned, complete destruction into a state of non-being awaits, but there is no suggestion of eternal torture.

During the reign of Seti I, Osiris was also invoked in royal decrees to pursue the living when wrongdoing was observed but kept secret and not reported.
==Greco-Roman era==
===Hellenization===

The early Ptolemaic kings promoted a new god, Serapis, who combined traits of Osiris with those of various Greek gods and was portrayed in a Hellenistic form. Serapis was often treated as the consort of Isis and became the patron deity of the Ptolemies&#x27; capital, Alexandria. Serapis&#x27;s origins are not known. Some ancient authors claim the cult of Serapis was established at Alexandria by Alexander the Great himself, but most who discuss the subject of Serapis&#x27;s origins give a story similar to that by Plutarch. Writing about 400 years after the fact, Plutarch claimed that Ptolemy I established the cult after dreaming of a colossal statue at Sinope in Anatolia. His councillors identified the statue as the Greek god Pluto and said that the Egyptian name for Pluto was Serapis. This name may have been a Hellenization of &quot;Osiris-Apis&quot;. Osiris-Apis was a patron deity of the Memphite Necropolis and the father of the Apis bull who was worshipped there, and texts from Ptolemaic times treat &quot;Serapis&quot; as the Greek translation of &quot;Osiris-Apis&quot;. But little of the early evidence for Serapis&#x27;s cult comes from Memphis, and much of it comes from the Mediterranean world with no reference to an Egyptian origin for Serapis, so Mark Smith expresses doubt that Serapis originated as a Greek form of Osiris-Apis&#x27;s name and leaves open the possibility that Serapis originated outside Egypt.

===Destruction of cult===

The cult of Isis and Osiris continued at Philae until at least the 450s CE, long after the imperial decrees of the late 4th century that ordered the closing of temples to &quot;pagan&quot; gods. Philae was the last major ancient Egyptian temple to be closed.

<doc id="22764" wikidata="Q3850093" url="?curid=22764" title="Orthodox Baháʼí Faith">
<text>The Orthodox Baháʼí Faith is an extremely small Baháʼí sect that was formed in 1960 by Mason Remey, and subsequently was the name used by one of his disputed successors, Joel Marangella. The sect is defined by a belief that the Guardianship of Shoghi Effendi (1921–1957) continued with further appointees, whereas the mainstream Baháʼís follow a line of leadership that transitioned to the elected Universal House of Justice in 1963 with no eligible appointees as Guardian. 

Other than on the matter of leadership and organization, there are few differences between the Orthodox and mainstream Baháʼís regarding their doctrine. As a group who believe that Mason Remey was the second Guardian of the Baháʼí Faith, they are excommunicated by the majority of Baháʼís and labelled covenant-breakers. Those who supported Mason Remey feel in turn that the majority strayed from the original teachings.

Membership data of the Orthodox Baháʼís is scarce. They are mostly located in the United States, with few members and no communal religious life. One source estimated them at no more than 100 members as of 1988, with the largest concentration being 11 in Roswell, New Mexico. In an Illinois court case in 2007 they reported membership in the United States at 40, and a news agency reported them at &quot;about 50&quot; in 2010. Websites claiming to represent the Orthodox Baháʼís indicate followers in the United States and India.

==History==
Following the unexpected death of the Baháʼí Faith&#x27;s first Guardian Shoghi Effendi in 1957, the 27 living Hands of the Cause, gathered and decided that he had died &quot;without having appointed his successor,&quot; and that the Universal House of Justice would decide on the situation after its first election. Charles Mason Remey, one of the Hands, declared himself the successor to Shoghi Effendi in 1960. Almost the whole Baháʼí world rejected his claim, which did not even address the requirements that Guardians be descendants of Baha&#x27;u&#x27;llah—making him ineligible—and that appointments must be clearly confirmed by the nine resident Hands of the Cause in Haifa. Initially the NSA of France and about 100 Baháʼís, mostly Americans, followed Remey. He was shunned as a Covenant-breaker. 

Initially, Remey had followers in Pakistan, India, the United States, and parts of Europe. He settled in Florence, Italy, until the end of his life. From there he appointed three local spiritual assemblies in Santa Fe, New Mexico, Rawalpindi, Pakistan, and Lucknow, India, then organized the election of two National Assemblies – in the united states and Pakistan.

In 1964 the Santa Fe assembly filed a lawsuit against the National Spiritual Assembly (NSA) of the Baháʼís of the United States to receive the legal title to the Baháʼí House of Worship in Illinois, and all other property owned by the NSA. The NSA counter-sued and won. The Santa Fe assembly lost the right to use the term &quot;Baháʼí&quot; in printed material. Remey then changed the name of his sect from &quot;Baháʼís Under the Hereditary Guardianship&quot; to &quot;Abha World Faith&quot; and also referred to it as the &quot;Orthodox Faith of Baháʼu&#x27;lláh&quot;. In 1966, Remey asked the Santa Fe assembly to dissolve, as well as the second International Baháʼí Council that he had appointed with Joel Marangella, residing in France, as president.

Beginning in 1966–67, Remey was abandoned by almost all of his followers due to his criticism of Shoghi Effendi and other statements. The followers of Mason Remey were not organized until several of them began forming their own groups based on different understandings of succession, even before his death in 1974. The majority of them claimed that Remey was showing signs of senility. 

The &quot;Encyclopædia Iranica&quot; reported the following in 1988:
===Joel Marangella===
In 1961 Joel Marangella received a letter from Remey, and a note that, &quot;... in or after 1963. You will know when to break the seal.&quot; In 1964 Remey appointed members to a second International Baháʼí Council with Marangella as president, significant due to Remey&#x27;s claim to Guardianship being based on the same appointment. In 1965 Remey activated the council, and in 1966 wrote letters passing the &quot;affairs of the Faith&quot; to the council, then later dissolving it. In 1969 Marangella made an announcement that the letter of 1961 was Remey&#x27;s appointment of him as the third Guardian, and that he had been the Guardian since 1964, invalidating Remey&#x27;s pronouncements from that point forward.

In 1970 Marangella appointed members to a &quot;National Bureau of the Orthodox Baháʼís in New York&quot;, which two years later was moved to New Mexico, and subsequently changed its name to &quot;Mother Baháʼí Council of the United States&quot; (1978) and &quot;Provisional National Baháʼí Council&quot; (2000), with all members appointed by Joel Marangella.

Marangella gained the support of most of Remey&#x27;s followers, who came to be known as Orthodox Baháʼís. Joel Marangella died in San Diego, California on Sept 1, 2013. A website claiming to represent Orthodox Baháʼís indicates followers in the United States and India, and a fourth Guardian named Nosrat’u’llah Bahremand.

== Ruling on Baháʼí trademarks ==
In 2006, the mainstream Baháʼí administration filed a lawsuit accusing the Orthodox Baháʼís of violating the order issued in 1966. The Orthodox Baháʼís denied that they were the same group.

The federal 7th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 2008 that the 1966 decision against Mason Remey&#x27;s use of Baha&#x27;i trademarks does not apply to any of the successor groups, such as, &quot;Franklin D. Schlatter, Joel B. Marangella, the Provisional National Baha’i Council (&quot;PNBC&quot;), the Second International Baha’I Council (d/b/a Baha’is Under the Provisions of the Covenant) (&quot;SIBC&quot;), and the Baha’i Publishers Under the Provisions of the Covenant (&quot;BPUPC&quot;)&quot;.

<doc id="22773" wikidata="Q227564" url="?curid=22773" title="Oxidative phosphorylation">
<text>Oxidative phosphorylation (UK , US ) or electron transport-linked phosphorylation or terminal oxidation is the metabolic pathway in which cells use enzymes to oxidize nutrients, thereby releasing chemical energy in order to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In eukaryotes, this takes place inside mitochondria. Almost all aerobic organisms carry out oxidative phosphorylation. This pathway is so pervasive because it releases more energy than alternative fermentation processes such as anaerobic glycolysis.

The energy stored in the chemical bonds of glucose is released by the cell in the citric acid cycle, producing carbon dioxide and the energetic electron donors NADH and FADH. Oxidative phosphorylation uses these molecules and O2 to produce ATP, which is used throughout the cell whenever energy is needed. During oxidative phosphorylation, electrons are transferred from the electron donors to a series of electron acceptors in a series of redox reactions ending in oxygen, whose reaction releases half of the total energy.

In eukaryotes, these redox reactions are catalyzed by a series of protein complexes within the inner membrane of the cell&#x27;s mitochondria, whereas, in prokaryotes, these proteins are located in the cell&#x27;s outer membrane. These linked sets of proteins are called the electron transport chain. In eukaryotes, five main protein complexes are involved, whereas in prokaryotes many different enzymes are present, using a variety of electron donors and acceptors.

The energy transferred by electrons flowing through this electron transport chain is used to transport protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane, in a process called &quot;electron transport&quot;. This generates potential energy in the form of a pH gradient and the resulting electrical potential across this membrane. This store of energy is tapped when protons flow back across the membrane and down the potential energy gradient, through a large enzyme called ATP synthase in a process called chemiosmosis. The ATP synthase uses the energy to transform adenosine diphosphate (ADP) into adenosine triphosphate, in a phosphorylation reaction. The reaction is driven by the proton flow, which forces the rotation of a part of the enzyme. The ATP synthase is a rotary mechanical motor.

Although oxidative phosphorylation is a vital part of metabolism, it produces reactive oxygen species such as superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, which lead to propagation of free radicals, damaging cells and contributing to disease and, possibly, aging and senescence. The enzymes carrying out this metabolic pathway are also the target of many drugs and poisons that inhibit their activities.

== Chemiosmosis ==

Oxidative phosphorylation works by using energy-releasing chemical reactions to drive energy-requiring reactions. The two sets of reactions are said to be &quot;coupled&quot;. This means one cannot occur without the other. The chain of redox reactions driving the flow of electrons through the electron transport chain, from electron donors such as NADH to electron acceptors such as oxygen and hydrogen (protons), is an exergonic process – it releases energy, whereas the synthesis of ATP is an endergonic process, which requires an input of energy. Both the electron transport chain and the ATP synthase are embedded in a membrane, and energy is transferred from the electron transport chain to the ATP synthase by movements of protons across this membrane, in a process called &quot;chemiosmosis&quot;. A current of protons is driven from the negative N-side of the membrane to the positive P-side through the proton-pumping enzymes of the electron transport chain. The movement of protons creates an electrochemical gradient across the membrane, is called the proton-motive force. It has two components: a difference in proton concentration (a H+ gradient, ΔpH) and a difference in electric potential, with the N-side having a negative charge.

ATP synthase releases this stored energy by completing the circuit and allowing protons to flow down the electrochemical gradient, back to the N-side of the membrane. The electrochemical gradient drives the rotation of part of the enzyme&#x27;s structure and couples this motion to the synthesis of ATP.

The two components of the proton-motive force are thermodynamically equivalent: In mitochondria, the largest part of energy is provided by the potential; in alkaliphile bacteria the electrical energy even has to compensate for a counteracting inverse pH difference. Inversely, chloroplasts operate mainly on ΔpH. However, they also require a small membrane potential for the kinetics of ATP synthesis. In the case of the fusobacterium &quot;Propionigenium modestum&quot; it drives the counter-rotation of subunits a and c of the FO motor of ATP synthase.

The amount of energy released by oxidative phosphorylation is high, compared with the amount produced by anaerobic fermentation. Glycolysis produces only 2 ATP molecules, but somewhere between 30 and 36 ATPs are produced by the oxidative phosphorylation of the 10 NADH and 2 succinate molecules made by converting one molecule of glucose to carbon dioxide and water, while each cycle of beta oxidation of a fatty acid yields about 14 ATPs. These ATP yields are theoretical maximum values; in practice, some protons leak across the membrane, lowering the yield of ATP.

== Electron and proton transfer molecules ==
The electron transport chain carries both protons and electrons, passing electrons from donors to acceptors, and transporting protons across a membrane. These processes use both soluble and protein-bound transfer molecules. In the mitochondria, electrons are transferred within the intermembrane space by the water-soluble electron transfer protein cytochrome c. This carries only electrons, and these are transferred by the reduction and oxidation of an iron atom that the protein holds within a heme group in its structure. Cytochrome c is also found in some bacteria, where it is located within the periplasmic space.

Within the inner mitochondrial membrane, the lipid-soluble electron carrier coenzyme Q10 (Q) carries both electrons and protons by a redox cycle. This small benzoquinone molecule is very hydrophobic, so it diffuses freely within the membrane. When Q accepts two electrons and two protons, it becomes reduced to the &quot;ubiquinol&quot; form (QH2); when QH2 releases two electrons and two protons, it becomes oxidized back to the &quot;ubiquinone&quot; (Q) form. As a result, if two enzymes are arranged so that Q is reduced on one side of the membrane and QH2 oxidized on the other, ubiquinone will couple these reactions and shuttle protons across the membrane. Some bacterial electron transport chains use different quinones, such as menaquinone, in addition to ubiquinone.

Within proteins, electrons are transferred between flavin cofactors, iron–sulfur clusters and cytochromes. There are several types of iron–sulfur cluster. The simplest kind found in the electron transfer chain consists of two iron atoms joined by two atoms of inorganic sulfur; these are called [2Fe–2S] clusters. The second kind, called [4Fe–4S], contains a cube of four iron atoms and four sulfur atoms. Each iron atom in these clusters is coordinated by an additional amino acid, usually by the sulfur atom of cysteine. Metal ion cofactors undergo redox reactions without binding or releasing protons, so in the electron transport chain they serve solely to transport electrons through proteins. Electrons move quite long distances through proteins by hopping along chains of these cofactors. This occurs by quantum tunnelling, which is rapid over distances of less than 1.4 m.

== Eukaryotic electron transport chains ==

Many catabolic biochemical processes, such as glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and beta oxidation, produce the reduced coenzyme NADH. This coenzyme contains electrons that have a high transfer potential; in other words, they will release a large amount of energy upon oxidation. However, the cell does not release this energy all at once, as this would be an uncontrollable reaction. Instead, the electrons are removed from NADH and passed to oxygen through a series of enzymes that each release a small amount of the energy. This set of enzymes, consisting of complexes I through IV, is called the electron transport chain and is found in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. Succinate is also oxidized by the electron transport chain, but feeds into the pathway at a different point.

In eukaryotes, the enzymes in this electron transport system use the energy released from O2 by NADH to pump protons across the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. This causes protons to build up in the intermembrane space, and generates an electrochemical gradient across the membrane. The energy stored in this potential is then used by ATP synthase to produce ATP. Oxidative phosphorylation in the eukaryotic mitochondrion is the best-understood example of this process. The mitochondrion is present in almost all eukaryotes, with the exception of anaerobic protozoa such as &quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot; that instead reduce protons to hydrogen in a remnant mitochondrion called a hydrogenosome.

=== NADH-coenzyme Q oxidoreductase (complex I) ===
NADH-coenzyme Q oxidoreductase, also known as &quot;NADH dehydrogenase&quot; or &quot;complex I&quot;, is the first protein in the electron transport chain. Complex I is a giant enzyme with the mammalian complex I having 46 subunits and a molecular mass of about 1,000 kilodaltons (kDa). The structure is known in detail only from a bacterium; in most organisms the complex resembles a boot with a large &quot;ball&quot; poking out from the membrane into the mitochondrion. The genes that encode the individual proteins are contained in both the cell nucleus and the mitochondrial genome, as is the case for many enzymes present in the mitochondrion.

The reaction that is catalyzed by this enzyme is the two electron oxidation of NADH by coenzyme Q10 or &quot;ubiquinone&quot; (represented as Q in the equation below), a lipid-soluble quinone that is found in the mitochondrion membrane:

The start of the reaction, and indeed of the entire electron chain, is the binding of a NADH molecule to complex I and the donation of two electrons. The electrons enter complex I via a prosthetic group attached to the complex, flavin mononucleotide (FMN). The addition of electrons to FMN converts it to its reduced form, FMNH2. The electrons are then transferred through a series of iron–sulfur clusters: the second kind of prosthetic group present in the complex. There are both [2Fe–2S] and [4Fe–4S] iron–sulfur clusters in complex I.

As the electrons pass through this complex, four protons are pumped from the matrix into the intermembrane space. Exactly how this occurs is unclear, but it seems to involve conformational changes in complex I that cause the protein to bind protons on the N-side of the membrane and release them on the P-side of the membrane. Finally, the electrons are transferred from the chain of iron–sulfur clusters to a ubiquinone molecule in the membrane. Reduction of ubiquinone also contributes to the generation of a proton gradient, as two protons are taken up from the matrix as it is reduced to ubiquinol (QH2).

=== Succinate-Q oxidoreductase (complex II) ===
Succinate-Q oxidoreductase, also known as &quot;complex II&quot; or &quot;succinate dehydrogenase&quot;, is a second entry point to the electron transport chain. It is unusual because it is the only enzyme that is part of both the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain. Complex II consists of four protein subunits and contains a bound flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor, iron–sulfur clusters, and a heme group that does not participate in electron transfer to coenzyme Q, but is believed to be important in decreasing production of reactive oxygen species. It oxidizes succinate to fumarate and reduces ubiquinone. As this reaction releases less energy than the oxidation of NADH, complex II does not transport protons across the membrane and does not contribute to the proton gradient.

In some eukaryotes, such as the parasitic worm &quot;Ascaris suum&quot;, an enzyme similar to complex II, fumarate reductase (menaquinol:fumarate
oxidoreductase, or QFR), operates in reverse to oxidize ubiquinol and reduce fumarate. This allows the worm to survive in the anaerobic environment of the large intestine, carrying out anaerobic oxidative phosphorylation with fumarate as the electron acceptor. Another unconventional function of complex II is seen in the malaria parasite &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot;. Here, the reversed action of complex II as an oxidase is important in regenerating ubiquinol, which the parasite uses in an unusual form of pyrimidine biosynthesis.

=== Electron transfer flavoprotein-Q oxidoreductase ===
Electron transfer flavoprotein-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (ETF-Q oxidoreductase), also known as &quot;electron transferring-flavoprotein dehydrogenase&quot;, is a third entry point to the electron transport chain. It is an enzyme that accepts electrons from electron-transferring flavoprotein in the mitochondrial matrix, and uses these electrons to reduce ubiquinone. This enzyme contains a flavin and a [4Fe–4S] cluster, but, unlike the other respiratory complexes, it attaches to the surface of the membrane and does not cross the lipid bilayer.

In mammals, this metabolic pathway is important in beta oxidation of fatty acids and catabolism of amino acids and choline, as it accepts electrons from multiple acetyl-CoA dehydrogenases. In plants, ETF-Q oxidoreductase is also important in the metabolic responses that allow survival in extended periods of darkness.

=== Q-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (complex III) ===
Q-cytochrome c oxidoreductase is also known as &quot;cytochrome c reductase&quot;, &quot;cytochrome bc1 complex&quot;, or simply &quot;complex III&quot;. In mammals, this enzyme is a dimer, with each subunit complex containing 11 protein subunits, an [2Fe-2S] iron–sulfur cluster and three cytochromes: one cytochrome c1 and two b cytochromes. A cytochrome is a kind of electron-transferring protein that contains at least one heme group. The iron atoms inside complex III&#x27;s heme groups alternate between a reduced ferrous (+2) and oxidized ferric (+3) state as the electrons are transferred through the protein.

The reaction catalyzed by complex III is the oxidation of one molecule of ubiquinol and the reduction of two molecules of cytochrome c, a heme protein loosely associated with the mitochondrion. Unlike coenzyme Q, which carries two electrons, cytochrome c carries only one electron.

As only one of the electrons can be transferred from the QH2 donor to a cytochrome c acceptor at a time, the reaction mechanism of complex III is more elaborate than those of the other respiratory complexes, and occurs in two steps called the Q cycle. In the first step, the enzyme binds three substrates, first, QH2, which is then oxidized, with one electron being passed to the second substrate, cytochrome c. The two protons released from QH2 pass into the intermembrane space. The third substrate is Q, which accepts the second electron from the QH2 and is reduced to Q.−, which is the ubisemiquinone free radical. The first two substrates are released, but this ubisemiquinone intermediate remains bound. In the second step, a second molecule of QH2 is bound and again passes its first electron to a cytochrome c acceptor. The second electron is passed to the bound ubisemiquinone, reducing it to QH2 as it gains two protons from the mitochondrial matrix. This QH2 is then released from the enzyme.

As coenzyme Q is reduced to ubiquinol on the inner side of the membrane and oxidized to ubiquinone on the other, a net transfer of protons across the membrane occurs, adding to the proton gradient. The rather complex two-step mechanism by which this occurs is important, as it increases the efficiency of proton transfer. If, instead of the Q cycle, one molecule of QH2 were used to directly reduce two molecules of cytochrome c, the efficiency would be halved, with only one proton transferred per cytochrome c reduced.

=== Cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) ===

Cytochrome c oxidase, also known as &quot;complex IV&quot;, is the final protein complex in the electron transport chain. The mammalian enzyme has an extremely complicated structure and contains 13 subunits, two heme groups, as well as multiple metal ion cofactors – in all, three atoms of copper, one of magnesium and one of zinc.

This enzyme mediates the final reaction in the electron transport chain and transfers electrons to oxygen and hydrogen (protons), while pumping protons across the membrane. The final electron acceptor oxygen is reduced to water in this step. Both the direct pumping of protons and the consumption of matrix protons in the reduction of oxygen contribute to the proton gradient. The reaction catalyzed is the oxidation of cytochrome c and the reduction of oxygen:

=== Alternative reductases and oxidases ===
Many eukaryotic organisms have electron transport chains that differ from the much-studied mammalian enzymes described above. For example, plants have alternative NADH oxidases, which oxidize NADH in the cytosol rather than in the mitochondrial matrix, and pass these electrons to the ubiquinone pool. These enzymes do not transport protons, and, therefore, reduce ubiquinone without altering the electrochemical gradient across the inner membrane.

Another example of a divergent electron transport chain is the &quot;alternative oxidase&quot;, which is found in plants, as well as some fungi, protists, and possibly some animals. This enzyme transfers electrons directly from ubiquinol to oxygen.

The electron transport pathways produced by these alternative NADH and ubiquinone oxidases have lower ATP yields than the full pathway. The advantages produced by a shortened pathway are not entirely clear. However, the alternative oxidase is produced in response to stresses such as cold, reactive oxygen species, and infection by pathogens, as well as other factors that inhibit the full electron transport chain. Alternative pathways might, therefore, enhance an organism&#x27;s resistance to injury, by reducing oxidative stress.

=== Organization of complexes ===
The original model for how the respiratory chain complexes are organized was that they diffuse freely and independently in the mitochondrial membrane. However, recent data suggest that the complexes might form higher-order structures called supercomplexes or &quot;respirasomes&quot;. In this model, the various complexes exist as organized sets of interacting enzymes. These associations might allow channeling of substrates between the various enzyme complexes, increasing the rate and efficiency of electron transfer. Within such mammalian supercomplexes, some components would be present in higher amounts than others, with some data suggesting a ratio between complexes I/II/III/IV and the ATP synthase of approximately 1:1:3:7:4. However, the debate over this supercomplex hypothesis is not completely resolved, as some data do not appear to fit with this model.

== Prokaryotic electron transport chains ==

In contrast to the general similarity in structure and function of the electron transport chains in eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea possess a large variety of electron-transfer enzymes. These use an equally wide set of chemicals as substrates. In common with eukaryotes, prokaryotic electron transport uses the energy released from the oxidation of a substrate to pump ions across a membrane and generate an electrochemical gradient. In the bacteria, oxidative phosphorylation in &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; is understood in most detail, while archaeal systems are at present poorly understood.

The main difference between eukaryotic and prokaryotic oxidative phosphorylation is that bacteria and archaea use many different substances to donate or accept electrons. This allows prokaryotes to grow under a wide variety of environmental conditions. In &quot;E. coli&quot;, for example, oxidative phosphorylation can be driven by a large number of pairs of reducing agents and oxidizing agents, which are listed below. The midpoint potential of a chemical measures how much energy is released when it is oxidized or reduced, with reducing agents having negative potentials and oxidizing agents positive potentials.

As shown above, &quot;E. coli&quot; can grow with reducing agents such as formate, hydrogen, or lactate as electron donors, and nitrate, DMSO, or oxygen as acceptors. The larger the difference in midpoint potential between an oxidizing and reducing agent, the more energy is released when they react. Out of these compounds, the succinate/fumarate pair is unusual, as its midpoint potential is close to zero. Succinate can therefore be oxidized to fumarate if a strong oxidizing agent such as oxygen is available, or fumarate can be reduced to succinate using a strong reducing agent such as formate. These alternative reactions are catalyzed by succinate dehydrogenase and fumarate reductase, respectively.

Some prokaryotes use redox pairs that have only a small difference in midpoint potential. For example, nitrifying bacteria such as &quot;Nitrobacter&quot; oxidize nitrite to nitrate, donating the electrons to oxygen. The small amount of energy released in this reaction is enough to pump protons and generate ATP, but not enough to produce NADH or NADPH directly for use in anabolism. This problem is solved by using a nitrite oxidoreductase to produce enough proton-motive force to run part of the electron transport chain in reverse, causing complex I to generate NADH.

Prokaryotes control their use of these electron donors and acceptors by varying which enzymes are produced, in response to environmental conditions. This flexibility is possible because different oxidases and reductases use the same ubiquinone pool. This allows many combinations of enzymes to function together, linked by the common ubiquinol intermediate. These respiratory chains therefore have a modular design, with easily interchangeable sets of enzyme systems.

In addition to this metabolic diversity, prokaryotes also possess a range of isozymes – different enzymes that catalyze the same reaction. For example, in &quot;E. coli&quot;, there are two different types of ubiquinol oxidase using oxygen as an electron acceptor. Under highly aerobic conditions, the cell uses an oxidase with a low affinity for oxygen that can transport two protons per electron. However, if levels of oxygen fall, they switch to an oxidase that transfers only one proton per electron, but has a high affinity for oxygen.

== ATP synthase (complex V) ==
ATP synthase, also called &quot;complex V&quot;, is the final enzyme in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. This enzyme is found in all forms of life and functions in the same way in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The enzyme uses the energy stored in a proton gradient across a membrane to drive the synthesis of ATP from ADP and phosphate (Pi). Estimates of the number of protons required to synthesize one ATP have ranged from three to four, with some suggesting cells can vary this ratio, to suit different conditions.

This phosphorylation reaction is an equilibrium, which can be shifted by altering the proton-motive force. In the absence of a proton-motive force, the ATP synthase reaction will run from right to left, hydrolyzing ATP and pumping protons out of the matrix across the membrane. However, when the proton-motive force is high, the reaction is forced to run in the opposite direction; it proceeds from left to right, allowing protons to flow down their concentration gradient and turning ADP into ATP. Indeed, in the closely related vacuolar type H+-ATPases, the hydrolysis reaction is used to acidify cellular compartments, by pumping protons and hydrolysing ATP.

ATP synthase is a massive protein complex with a mushroom-like shape. The mammalian enzyme complex contains 16 subunits and has a mass of approximately 600 kilodaltons. The portion embedded within the membrane is called FO and contains a ring of c subunits and the proton channel. The stalk and the ball-shaped headpiece is called F1 and is the site of ATP synthesis. The ball-shaped complex at the end of the F1 portion contains six proteins of two different kinds (three α subunits and three β subunits), whereas the &quot;stalk&quot; consists of one protein: the γ subunit, with the tip of the stalk extending into the ball of α and β subunits. Both the α and β subunits bind nucleotides, but only the β subunits catalyze the ATP synthesis reaction. Reaching along the side of the F1 portion and back into the membrane is a long rod-like subunit that anchors the α and β subunits into the base of the enzyme.

As protons cross the membrane through the channel in the base of ATP synthase, the FO proton-driven motor rotates. Rotation might be caused by changes in the ionization of amino acids in the ring of c subunits causing electrostatic interactions that propel the ring of c subunits past the proton channel. This rotating ring in turn drives the rotation of the central axle (the γ subunit stalk) within the α and β subunits. The α and β subunits are prevented from rotating themselves by the side-arm, which acts as a stator. This movement of the tip of the γ subunit within the ball of α and β subunits provides the energy for the active sites in the β subunits to undergo a cycle of movements that produces and then releases ATP.

This ATP synthesis reaction is called the &quot;binding change mechanism&quot; and involves the active site of a β subunit cycling between three states. In the &quot;open&quot; state, ADP and phosphate enter the active site (shown in brown in the diagram). The protein then closes up around the molecules and binds them loosely – the &quot;loose&quot; state (shown in red). The enzyme then changes shape again and forces these molecules together, with the active site in the resulting &quot;tight&quot; state (shown in pink) binding the newly produced ATP molecule with very high affinity. Finally, the active site cycles back to the open state, releasing ATP and binding more ADP and phosphate, ready for the next cycle.

In some bacteria and archaea, ATP synthesis is driven by the movement of sodium ions through the cell membrane, rather than the movement of protons. Archaea such as &quot;Methanococcus&quot; also contain the A1Ao synthase, a form of the enzyme that contains additional proteins with little similarity in sequence to other bacterial and eukaryotic ATP synthase subunits. It is possible that, in some species, the A1Ao form of the enzyme is a specialized sodium-driven ATP synthase, but this might not be true in all cases.

== Oxidative phosphorylation - energetics ==
The transport of electrons from redox pair NAD+/ NADH to the final redox pair 1/2 O2/ H2O can be summarized as

1/2 O2 + NADH + H+ → H2O + NAD+

The potential difference between these two redox pairs is 1.14 volt, which is equivalent to -52 kcal/mol or -2600 kJ per 6 mol of O2.

When one NADH is oxidized through the electron transfer chain, three ATPs are produced, which is equivalent to 7.3 kcal/mol x 3 = 21.9 kcal/mol.

The conservation of the energy can be calculated by the following formula

Efficiency = (21.9 x 100%) / 52 = 42%

So we can conclude that when NADH is oxidized, about 42% of energy is conserved in the form of three ATPs and the remaining (58%) energy is lost as heat (unless the chemical energy of ATP under physiological conditions was underestimated).

== Reactive oxygen species ==

Molecular oxygen is a good terminal electron acceptor because it is a strong oxidizing agent. The reduction of oxygen does involve potentially harmful intermediates. Although the transfer of four electrons and four protons reduces oxygen to water, which is harmless, transfer of one or two electrons produces superoxide or peroxide anions, which are dangerously reactive.

} -&gt;[\ce{e^-}] \underset{Peroxide}{O2^{2-}}&lt;/chem&gt;|}}

These reactive oxygen species and their reaction products, such as the hydroxyl radical, are very harmful to cells, as they oxidize proteins and cause mutations in DNA. This cellular damage may contribute to disease and is proposed as one cause of aging.

The cytochrome c oxidase complex is highly efficient at reducing oxygen to water, and it releases very few partly reduced intermediates; however small amounts of superoxide anion and peroxide are produced by the electron transport chain. Particularly important is the reduction of coenzyme Q in complex III, as a highly reactive ubisemiquinone free radical is formed as an intermediate in the Q cycle. This unstable species can lead to electron &quot;leakage&quot; when electrons transfer directly to oxygen, forming superoxide. As the production of reactive oxygen species by these proton-pumping complexes is greatest at high membrane potentials, it has been proposed that mitochondria regulate their activity to maintain the membrane potential within a narrow range that balances ATP production against oxidant generation. For instance, oxidants can activate uncoupling proteins that reduce membrane potential.

To counteract these reactive oxygen species, cells contain numerous antioxidant systems, including antioxidant vitamins such as vitamin C and vitamin E, and antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, and peroxidases, which detoxify the reactive species, limiting damage to the cell.

== In hypoxic/anoxic conditions ==
As oxygen is fundamental for oxidative phosphorylation, a shortage in O2 level can alter ATP production rates. The proton motive force and ATP production can be maintained by intracellular acidosis. Cytosolic protons that have accumulated with ATP hydrolysis and lactic acidosis can freely diffuse across the mitochondrial outer-membrane and acidify the inter-membrane space, hence directly contributing to the proton motive force and ATP production.

When exposed to hypoxia/anoxia (no oxygen), most animals will see damage done to their mitochondria. From some species, these conditions can happen due to environmental variables, such as low tides, low temperatures, or general living conditions, like living in a hypoxic underground burrow. In humans, these conditions are commonly met in medical emergencies such as strokes, ischemia, and asphyxia.

Despite this, or perhaps due to it, some species have developed their own defense mechanisms against anoxia/hypoxia, as well as during reperfusion/reoxygenation. These mechanisms are diverse and differ between endotherms and ectotherms and can differ even at the species level.

=== Endotherms ===

==== Hypoxia/anoxia intolerance ====
Most mammals and birds are intolerant to low/no oxygen conditions. For the heart, in the absence of oxygen, the first four complexes of the electron transport chain decrease in activity. This will lead to protons leaking through the inner mitochondrial membrane without complexes I, III, and IV pushing protons back through to maintain the proton gradient. There is also electron leak (an event where electrons leak out of the electron transport chain), which happens because NADH dehydrogenase within Complex I becomes damaged, which allows for the production of ROS (reactive oxygen species) during ischemia. This will lead to the reversing of Complex V, which forces protons from the matrix back into the inner membrane space, against their concentration gradient. Forcing protons against their concentration gradient requires energy, so Complex V uses up ATP as an energy source.

==== Reoxygenation of intolerant animals ====
When oxygen re-enters the system, animals are faced with a different set of problems. Since ATP was used up during the anoxic period, it leads to a lack of ADP within the system. This is due to ADP&#x27;s natural degradation into AMP, resulting in ADP being drained from the system. With no ADP in the system, Complex V is unable to start, meaning the protons will not flow through it to enter the matrix. Due to Complex V&#x27;s reversal during anoxia, the proton gradient has become hyperpolarized (where the proton gradient is highly positively charged). Another factor in this problem is that succinate built up during anoxia, so when oxygen is reintroduced, succinate donates electrons to Complex II. The hyperpolarized gradient and succinate buildup leads to reverse electron transport, causing oxidative stress, which can lead to cellular damage and diseases.

==== Hypoxia/anoxia tolerance ====
The naked mole rat (&quot;Heterocephalus glaber&quot;) is a hypoxia-tolerant species that sleeps in deep burrows and in large colonies. The depth of these burrows reduces access to oxygen, and sleeping in large groups will deplete the area of oxygen quicker than usual, leading to hypoxia. The naked mole rat has the unique ability to survive low oxygen conditions for no less than several hours, and zero oxygen conditions for 18 minutes. One of the ways of combatting hypoxia in the brain is decreasing the reliance on oxygen for ATP production, achieved by decreased respiration rates and proton leak.

==== Reoxygenation of tolerant animals ====
Hypoxia/anoxia tolerant species handle ROS production during reoxygenation better than the intolerant. In the cortex of the naked mole rats, they show better homeostasis of ROS production than intolerant species and seem to lack the burst of ROS that typically comes with reoxygenation.

=== Ectotherms ===

==== Hypoxia/anoxia intolerance ====
Research on intolerant ectotherms is more limited than on tolerant ectotherms and intolerant endotherms, but it is shown that anoxia/hypoxia intolerance is different in terms for how long the intolerant survive as opposed to the tolerant between endotherms and ectotherms. While intolerant endotherms only last minutes, intolerant ectotherms can last hours, such as subtidal scallops (&quot;Argopecten irradians&quot;). This difference in intolerance could be due to a couple of different factors. One advantage is that the ectothermic inner mitochondrial membrane is less leaky, so less protons will leak through the inner membrane due to differences in the phospholipid bilayer composition. Another advantage ectotherms tend to have in this category is an ability for their mitochondria to properly function in a wide range of temperatures, such as the western fence lizard (&quot;Sceloporus occidentalis).&quot; While western fence lizards are not considered a hypoxia-tolerant animal, they still showed less temperature sensitivity in their mitochondria than mice mitochondria.

==== Reoxygenation of intolerant animals ====
While it is unclear how reoxygenation affects intolerant ectotherms at the mitochondrial level, there is some research showing how some of them respond. In the hypoxia-sensitive shovelnose ray (&quot;Aptychotrema rostrata),&quot; it is shown that ROS production is lower upon reoxygenation compared to rays only exposed to normoxia (normal oxygen levels). This differs from the hypoxia-sensitive endotherm, which would see an increase in ROS production. However, the ray&#x27;s levels were still higher than the more hypoxia-tolerant Epaulette shark (&quot;Hemiscyllum ocellatum&quot;), which potentially sees hypoxia due to the bouts of low tides that can be seen in reef platforms. Subtidal scallops will see both a decrease in maximal respiration and a depolarization of the membrane during reoxygenation.

==== Hypoxia/anoxia tolerance ====
Hypoxia/Anoxia tolerant ectotherms have shown unique strategies for surviving anoxia. Pond turtles, such as the painted turtle (&quot;Chrysemys picta bellii&quot;), will experience anoxia during winter while they overwinter at the bottom of frozen ponds. In their cardiac mitochondria, the reversing of Complex V, the usage of ATP, and the build-up of succinate are all prevented during anoxia. Crucian carps (&quot;Carassius carassius&quot;) also overwinter in frozen ponds and show no loss membrane potential in their cardiac mitochondria during anoxia, but this relies on complexes I and III to be active.

==== Reoxygenation of tolerant animals ====
Pond turtles are able to completely avoid ROS production upon reoxygenation. However, crucian carp cannot and are unable to prevent the death of brain cells upon reoxygenation.

== Inhibitors ==
There are several well-known drugs and toxins that inhibit oxidative phosphorylation. Although any one of these toxins inhibits only one enzyme in the electron transport chain, inhibition of any step in this process will halt the rest of the process. For example, if oligomycin inhibits ATP synthase, protons cannot pass back into the mitochondrion. As a result, the proton pumps are unable to operate, as the gradient becomes too strong for them to overcome. NADH is then no longer oxidized and the citric acid cycle ceases to operate because the concentration of NAD+ falls below the concentration that these enzymes can use.

Many site-specific inhibitors of the electron transport chain have contributed to the present knowledge of mitochondrial respiration. Synthesis of ATP is also dependent on the electron transport chain, so all site-specific inhibitors also inhibit ATP formation. The fish poison rotenone, the barbiturate drug amytal, and the antibiotic piericidin A inhibit NADH and coenzyme Q.

Carbon monoxide, cyanide, hydrogen sulphide and azide effectively inhibit cytochrome oxidase. Carbon monoxide reacts with the reduced form of the cytochrome while cyanide and azide react with the oxidised form. An antibiotic, antimycin A, and British anti-Lewisite, an antidote used against chemical weapons, are the two important inhibitors of the site between cytochrome B and C1.

Not all inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation are toxins. In brown adipose tissue, regulated proton channels called uncoupling proteins can uncouple respiration from ATP synthesis. This rapid respiration produces heat, and is particularly important as a way of maintaining body temperature for hibernating animals, although these proteins may also have a more general function in cells&#x27; responses to stress.

== History ==

The field of oxidative phosphorylation began with the report in 1906 by Arthur Harden of a vital role for phosphate in cellular fermentation, but initially only sugar phosphates were known to be involved. However, in the early 1940s, the link between the oxidation of sugars and the generation of ATP was firmly established by Herman Kalckar, confirming the central role of ATP in energy transfer that had been proposed by Fritz Albert Lipmann in 1941. Later, in 1949, Morris Friedkin and Albert L. Lehninger proved that the coenzyme NADH linked metabolic pathways such as the citric acid cycle and the synthesis of ATP. The term &quot;oxidative phosphorylation&quot; was coined by in 1939.

For another twenty years, the mechanism by which ATP is generated remained mysterious, with scientists searching for an elusive &quot;high-energy intermediate&quot; that would link oxidation and phosphorylation reactions. This puzzle was solved by Peter D. Mitchell with the publication of the chemiosmotic theory in 1961. At first, this proposal was highly controversial, but it was slowly accepted and Mitchell was awarded a Nobel prize in 1978. Subsequent research concentrated on purifying and characterizing the enzymes involved, with major contributions being made by David E. Green on the complexes of the electron-transport chain, as well as Efraim Racker on the ATP synthase. A critical step towards solving the mechanism of the ATP synthase was provided by Paul D. Boyer, by his development in 1973 of the &quot;binding change&quot; mechanism, followed by his radical proposal of rotational catalysis in 1982. More recent work has included structural studies on the enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation by John E. Walker, with Walker and Boyer being awarded a Nobel Prize in 1997.

<text>The old fashioned is a cocktail made by muddling sugar with bitters and water, adding whiskey (typically rye or bourbon) or sometimes brandy, and garnishing with an orange slice or zest and a cocktail cherry. It is traditionally served with ice in an old fashioned glass (also known as a rocks glass).

Developed during the 19th century and given its name in the 1880s, it is an IBA Official Cocktail. It is also one of six basic drinks listed in David A. Embury&#x27;s &quot;The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks&quot;.

==History==
The recipe for the old fashioned dates to the early 1800s, though not by that name. The term &quot;old-fashioned cocktails&quot; dates to 1880, and recipes by that name appear in cocktail books of the late 1880s and 1890s, with of Chicago the earliest known.

An old fashioned was one of the simpler and earlier versions of cocktails, before the development of advanced bartending techniques and recipes in the later part of the 19th century. The first documented definition of the word &quot;cocktail&quot; was in response to a reader&#x27;s letter asking to define the word in the 6 May 1806, issue of &quot;The Balance and Columbian Repository&quot; in Hudson, New York. In the 13 May 1806, issue, the paper&#x27;s editor wrote that it was a potent concoction of spirits, bitters, water, and sugar; it was also referred to at the time as a bittered sling.
J.E. Alexander describes the cocktail similarly in 1833, as he encountered it in New York City, as being rum, gin, or brandy, significant water, bitters, and sugar, though he includes a nutmeg garnish as well.

By the 1860s, it was common for orange curaçao, absinthe, and other liqueurs to be added to the cocktail. As cocktails became more complex, drinkers accustomed to simpler cocktails began to ask bartenders for something akin to the pre-1850s drinks. The original concoction, albeit in different proportions, came back into vogue, and was referred to as &quot;old-fashioned&quot;. The most popular of the in-vogue &quot;old-fashioned&quot; cocktails were made with whiskey, according to a Chicago barman, quoted in the &quot;Chicago Daily Tribune&quot; in 1882, with rye being more popular than Bourbon. The recipe he describes is a similar combination of spirits, bitters, water, and sugar of seventy-six years earlier.

===Myths===
The invention of the old fashioned is sometimes credited to the Pendennis Club, a gentlemen&#x27;s club founded in 1881 in Louisville, Kentucky, and its introduction to New York to James E. Pepper, a prominent bourbon distiller and member of the club. This attribution is due to Albert Stevens Crockett of the Waldorf-Astoria, writing in the 1930s:
This is flatly contradicted by the historical record – multiple recipes by the name &quot;Old-Fashioned Whiskey Cocktail&quot; were published over 30 years before Crockett&#x27;s claim, and the cocktail itself had existed for decades earlier. Cocktail historians also reject this claim – Robert Simonson rejects it, and David Wondrich rejects this origin story as a &quot;myth&quot;, writing:
The popular story of how making an old-fashioned cocktail with brandy instead of whiskey began attributes it to the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair in 1893, when the recently opened Korbel winery offered samples of their wine and brandy. Central European immigrants from Milwaukee took a liking to the Bohemian-born Korbel brothers&#x27; brandy, and brought it back to their home state and began using it in cocktails. This story is most likely false, however, and the practice more likely began after the Second World War due to supply shortages in spirits other than brandy.

===Popularity===
In January 2020, drinks journal &quot;Drinks International&quot; reported the old fashioned to be the top selling classic cocktail internationally, for the 6th straight year, based on its annual, global poll of 100 bars.

With its purported conception rooted in the city&#x27;s history, in 2015 the city of Louisville named the old fashioned as its official cocktail. Each year, during the first two weeks of June, Louisville celebrates &quot;Old Fashioned Fortnight&quot;, which encompasses bourbon events, cocktail specials, and National Bourbon Day which is always celebrated on 14 June.

Due to the popularity of the cocktail (when made with brandy) in the state of Wisconsin, the brandy old fashioned was named Wisconsin&#x27;s state cocktail in 2023.

==Recipe==
Recipes have varied over the years; the IBA recipe (with fruit) reflects mid-1900s practice, while modern craft cocktail recipes are closer to pre-Prohibition practice, though often modernized.

Early cocktails primarily used Holland gin or brandy, and did not use ice; they consisted of spirit, water, sugar, and bitters, often garnished with a grating of nutmeg. Sugar in turn was cut from a sugarloaf. By the 1860s, cocktails were generally iced, sugar syrup generally replaced solid sugar, whiskey had become a popular spirit, and a lemon twist replaced nutmeg as a garnish. Build was inconsistent: some were stirred, some shaken, some strained off the ice, some built in the glass. By the time &quot;old-fashioned cocktails&quot; started to be referred to in the 1880s, this still referred to various spirits – a whiskey version was called an &quot;old fashioned whiskey cocktail&quot; – but specified a lump of sugar, rather than syrup, building in the glass, and sometimes left a spoon in the glass, to stir or eat the partially undissolved sugar. This continued until Prohibition. Sugar cubes largely replaced sugar loafs around 1900, but some recipes continued to specify a sugar loaf. Orange slices began to be used as early as 1905.

After the repeal of Prohibition, recipes for an &quot;old-fashioned&quot; in the 1930s specified whiskey, and included other fruit (orange slice, cherry), which is reflected in the IBA recipe. These recipes existed prior to Prohibition, but were uncommon or considered different cocktails, not an old fashioned. With the cocktail renaissance in the 2000s, craft cocktail versions returned to the pre-Prohibition recipes, with only a lemon twist (or orange twist, or both, known as &quot;rabbit ears&quot;). By the 2020s, craft cocktail versions generally used sugar syrup, rather than solid sugar, due to better dissolving, consistency, and speed. Traditionally it is built in the glass, but others stir in a mixing glass and then strain over an ice cube.

===Historical recipes===
The earliest recipe for an old-fashioned cocktail is given by Theodore Proulx of Chapin &amp; Gore of Chicago in 1888:

Points to note include that this uses whiskey, without including it in the name; that it specifies either stirring and straining or building in the glass; it includes both half a lump of sugar and (sugar) syrup; and that it includes absinthe in addition to bitters. Proulx also gives a recipe for &quot;Toddy–Old-fashioned&quot;, with only a lump of sugar, water, ice, and whiskey, with the spoon in the glass.

George Kappeler provides several of the earliest published recipes for old-fashioned cocktails in his 1895 book. Recipes are given for whiskey, brandy, Holland gin, and Old Tom gin. The whiskey old fashioned recipe specifies the following (with a jigger being ):

By the 1860s, as illustrated by Jerry Thomas&#x27;s 1862 book, basic cocktail recipes included Curaçao or other liqueurs. These liqueurs were not mentioned in the early 19th century descriptions, nor the &quot;Chicago Daily Tribune&quot; descriptions of the &quot;old-fashioned&quot; cocktails of the early 1880s; they were absent from Kappeler&#x27;s old-fashioned recipes as well. The differences of the old-fashioned cocktail recipes from the cocktail recipes of the late 19th Century are mainly preparation methods, the use of sugar and water in lieu of simple or gum syrup, and the absence of additional liqueurs. These old-fashioned cocktail recipes are literally for cocktails done the old-fashioned way.

Recipes varied in the fruit they used. In 1905, the Hoffman House Old Fashioned Whiskey Cocktail included an orange slice, though this was absent from other recipes. In 1934, an &quot;Old Fashioned Cocktail (Whiskey)&quot; featured a lemon peel, orange peel, and slice of pineapple.

A book by David Embury published in 1948 provides a slight variation, specifying 12 parts American whiskey, 1 part simple syrup, 1–3 dashes Angostura bitters, a twist of lemon peel over the top, and serve garnished with the lemon peel. Two additional recipes from the 1900s vary in the precise ingredients but omit the cherry which was introduced after 1930 as well as the soda water which the occasional recipe calls for. Orange bitters were a popular ingredient in the late 19th century.

==Modifications==

The original old fashioned recipe would have showcased the whiskey available in America in the 19th century: Irish, Bourbon or rye whiskey. But in some regions, especially Wisconsin, brandy is substituted for whiskey (sometimes called a brandy old fashioned). Eventually the use of other spirits became common, such as a gin recipe becoming popularized in the late 1940s.

Common garnishes for an old fashioned include an orange slice or a maraschino cherry or both, although these modifications came around 1930, some time after the original recipe was invented. While some recipes began making sparse use of the orange zest for flavor, the practice of muddling orange and other fruit gained prevalence as late as the 1990s.

Some modern variants have greatly sweetened the old-fashioned, e.g. by adding blood orange soda or lemon-lime soda to make a fizzy old-fashioned, or muddled strawberries to make a strawberry old-fashioned. In Wisconsin, an &quot;old fashioned, sweet&quot; is made with lemon-lime soda, and &quot;old fashioned, sour&quot; is made with grapefruit soda.

Modern versions may also include elaborately carved ice. Cocktail critic David Wondrich notes that this goes against the simple spirit of the old-fashioned.

Another more modern variation is the smoked old fashioned. The glass is smoked by a torch, smoking gun, or cocktail smoker. There is also an option through dry ice, the Smokin&#x27; Steve Old Fashioned, created by Steve Haddadin.

==Cultural impact==
The old fashioned is the cocktail of choice of Don Draper, the lead character on the &quot;Mad Men&quot; television series, set in the 1960s. The use of the drink in the series coincided with a renewed interest in this and other classic cocktails in the 2000s.

It was also the basis of an oft-quoted line from the 1963 movie &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot;, when boozy pilot Jim Backus decides to make the cocktail and leaves passenger Buddy Hackett to fly the plane. When Hackett asks, &quot;What if something happens?&quot; Backus replies, &quot;What could happen to an old-fashioned?&quot; This scene is satirized in &quot;Archer&quot; season 3 episode 1 (&quot;Heart of Archness&quot;) when Sterling Archer attempts to make an old fashioned on Rip Riley&#x27;s seaplane but lacks the basic ingredients.

The cocktail is the subject of the Cole Porter song &quot;Make It Another Old-Fashioned, Please&quot; from &quot;Panama Hattie&quot;, although the song asks to leave out the cherries, orange and bitters, and &quot;Just make it a straight rye&quot;.

<text>Omnipotence is the quality of having unlimited . Monotheistic religions generally attribute omnipotence only to the deity of their faith. In the monotheistic religious philosophy of Abrahamic religions, omnipotence is often listed as one of God&#x27;s characteristics, along with omniscience, omnipresence, and omnibenevolence. The presence of all these properties in a single entity has given rise to considerable theological debate, prominently including the problem of evil, the question of why such a deity would permit the existence of evil. It is accepted in philosophy and science that omnipotence can never be effectively understood.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;omnipotence&quot; derives from the Latin prefix &quot;omni&quot;-, meaning &quot;all&quot;, and the word &quot;potens&quot;, meaning &quot;potent&quot; or &quot;powerful&quot;. Thus the term means &quot;all-powerful&quot;.

==Meanings==
===Scholasticism===
The term omnipotent has been used to connote a number of different positions. These positions include, but are not limited to, the following:
# A deity is able to do anything that it chooses to do. (In this version, God can do the impossible and something contradictory.)
# A deity is able to do anything that is in accord with its own nature (thus, for instance, if it is a logical consequence of a deity&#x27;s nature that what it speaks is truth, then it is not able to lie).
# It is part of a deity&#x27;s nature to be consistent and that it would be inconsistent for said deity to go against its own laws unless there was a reason to do so.

Thomas Aquinas acknowledged difficulty in comprehending the deity&#x27;s power: &quot;All confess that God is omnipotent; but it seems difficult to explain in what His omnipotence precisely consists: for there may be doubt as to the precise meaning of the word &#x27;all&#x27; when we say that God can do all things. If, however, we consider the matter aright, since power is said in reference to possible things, this phrase, &#x27;God can do all things,&#x27; is rightly understood to mean that God can do all things that are possible; and for this reason He is said to be omnipotent.&quot; In Scholasticism, omnipotence is generally understood to be compatible with certain limitations or restrictions. A proposition that is necessarily true is one whose negation is self-contradictory.
Aquinas says that:
The adaptation of means to ends in the universe does not argue, as John Stuart Mill would have it, that the power of the designer is limited, but only that God has willed to manifest his glory by a world so constituted rather than by another. Indeed, the production of secondary causes, capable of accomplishing certain effects, requires greater power than the direct accomplishment of these same effects. On the other hand, even though no creature existed, God&#x27;s power would not be barren, for &quot;creatures are not an end to God.&quot; Regarding the deity&#x27;s power, medieval theologians contended that there are certain things that even an omnipotent deity cannot do. The statement &quot;a deity can do anything&quot; is only sensible with an assumed suppressed clause, &quot;that implies the perfection of true power&quot;. This standard scholastic answer allows that acts of creatures such as walking can be performed by humans but not by a deity. Rather than an advantage in power, human acts such as walking, sitting, or giving birth were possible only because of a &quot;defect&quot; in human power. The capacity to sin, for example, is not a power but a defect or infirmity. In response to questions of a deity performing impossibilities, e.g. making square circles, Aquinas says that &quot;everything that does not imply a contradiction in terms, is numbered amongst those possible things, in respect of which God is called omnipotent: whereas whatever implies contradiction does not come within the scope of divine omnipotence, because it cannot have the aspect of possibility. Hence it is better to say that such things cannot be done, than that God cannot do them. Nor is this contrary to the word of the angel, saying: &#x27;No word shall be impossible with God.&#x27; For whatever implies a contradiction cannot be a word, because no intellect can possibly conceive such a thing.&quot;

C. S. Lewis has adopted a scholastic position in the course of his work &quot;The Problem of Pain&quot;. Lewis follows Aquinas&#x27; view on contradiction:
===As a stage of normal child development===

Sigmund Freud freely used the same term in a comparable way. Referring with respect to an adult neurotic to &quot;the &quot;omnipotence&quot; which he ascribed to his thoughts and feelings&quot;, Freud reckoned that &quot;this belief is a frank acknowledgement of a relic of the old megalomania of infancy&quot;. Similarly Freud concluded that &quot;we can detect an element of megalomania in most other forms of paranoic disorder. We are justified in assuming that this megalomania is essentially of an infantile nature and that, as development proceeds, it is sacrificed to social considerations&quot;. Freud saw megalomania as an obstacle to psychoanalysis. In the second half of the 20th century object relations theory, both in the States and among British Kleinians, set about &quot;rethinking megalomania... intent on transforming an obstacle... into a complex organization that linked object relations and defence mechanisms&quot; in such a way as to offer new &quot;prospects for therapy&quot;.

Edmund Bergler, one of his early followers, considered that &quot;as Freud and Ferenczi have shown, the child lives in a sort of megalomania for a long period; he knows only one yardstick, and that is his own over-inflated ego ... megalomania, it must be understood, is normal in the very young child&quot;. Bergler was of the opinion that in later life &quot;the activity of gambling in itself unconsciously activates the megalomania and grandiosity of childhood, reverting to the &quot;fiction of omnipotence&quot;&quot;.

Heinz Kohut regarded &quot;the narcissistic patient&#x27;s &quot;megalomania&quot; as a part of normal development.

D. W. Winnicott took a more positive view of a belief in early omnipotence, seeing it as essential to the child&#x27;s well-being; and &quot;good-enough&quot; mothering as essential to enable the child to &quot;cope with the immense shock of loss of omnipotence&quot;—as opposed to whatever &quot;prematurely forces it out of its narcissistic universe&quot;.

==Rejection or limitation==
Some monotheists reject the view that a deity is or could be omnipotent, or take the view that, by choosing to create creatures with free will, a deity has chosen to limit divine omnipotence. In Conservative and Reform Judaism, and some movements within Protestant Christianity, including open theism, deities are said to act in the world through persuasion, and not by coercion (this is a matter of choice—a deity could act miraculously, and perhaps on occasion does so—while for process theism it is a matter of necessity—creatures have inherent powers that a deity cannot, even in principle, override). Deities are manifested in the world through inspiration and the creation of possibility, not necessarily by miracles or violations of the laws of nature.

===Philosophical grounds===
Process theology rejects unlimited omnipotence on a philosophical basis, arguing that omnipotence as classically understood would be less than perfect, and is therefore incompatible with the idea of a perfect deity. The idea is grounded in Plato&#x27;s oft-overlooked statement that &quot;being is power&quot;.

From this premise, Charles Hartshorne argues further that:

The argument can be stated as follows:
# If a being exists, then it must have some active tendency.
# If a being has some active tendency, then it has some power to resist its creator.
# If a being has the power to resist its creator, then the creator does not have absolute power.

For example, although someone might control a lump of jelly-pudding almost completely, the inability of that pudding to stage any resistance renders that person&#x27;s power rather unimpressive. Power can only be said to be great if it is over something that has defenses and its own agenda. If a deity&#x27;s power is to be great, it must therefore be over beings that have at least some of their own defenses and agenda. Thus, if a deity does not have absolute power, it must therefore embody some of the characteristics of power, and some of the characteristics of persuasion. This view is known as dipolar theism.

The most popular works espousing this point are from Harold Kushner (in Judaism). The need for a modified view of omnipotence was also articulated by Alfred North Whitehead in the early 20th century and expanded upon by Charles Hartshorne. Hartshorne proceeded within the context of the theological system known as process theology.

Thomas Jay Oord argues that omnipotence dies a death of a thousand philosophical qualifications. To make any sense, the word must undergo various logical, ontological, mathematical, theological, and existential qualifications so that it loses specificity.

===Scriptural grounds===
In the Authorized King James Version of the Bible, as well as several other versions, in Revelation 19:6 it is stated &quot;the Lord God omnipotent reigneth&quot; (, &quot;all-mighty&quot;).

Thomas Jay Oord argues that omnipotence is not found in the Hebrew and Greek scriptures. The Hebrew words Shaddai (breasts) and Sabaoth (hosts) are wrongly translated as &quot;God almighty&quot; or &quot;divine omnipotence&quot;. Pantokrator, the Greek word in the New Testament and Septuagint often translated in English as &quot;almighty&quot;, actually means &quot;all-holding&quot; rather than almighty or omnipotent. Oord offers an alternative view of divine power he calls &quot;amipotence,&quot; which is the maximal power of God&#x27;s uncontrolling love.

==Uncertainty==
Trying to develop a theory to explain, assign or reject omnipotence on grounds of logic has little merit, since being omnipotent, in a Cartesian sense, would mean the omnipotent being is above logic, a view supported by René Descartes. He issues this idea in his &quot;Meditations on First Philosophy&quot;. This view is called universal possibilism.

According to Hindu philosophy the essence of Brahman can never be understood or known since Brahman is beyond both existence and non-existence, transcending and including time, causation and space, and thus can never be known in the same material sense as one traditionally &quot;understands&quot; a given concept or object.

<doc id="22780" wikidata="Q40152" url="?curid=22780" title="Octopus">
<text>An octopus (: octopuses or octopodes) is a soft-bodied, eight-limbed mollusc of the order Octopoda (, ). The order consists of some 300 species and is grouped within the class Cephalopoda with squids, cuttlefish, and nautiloids. Like other cephalopods, an octopus is bilaterally symmetric with two eyes and a beaked mouth at the centre point of the eight limbs. The soft body can radically alter its shape, enabling octopuses to squeeze through small gaps. They trail their eight appendages behind them as they swim. The siphon is used both for respiration and for locomotion, by expelling a jet of water. Octopuses have a complex nervous system and excellent sight, and are among the most intelligent and behaviourally diverse of all invertebrates.

Octopuses inhabit various regions of the ocean, including coral reefs, pelagic waters, and the seabed; some live in the intertidal zone and others at abyssal depths. Most species grow quickly, mature early, and are short-lived. In most species, the male uses a specially adapted arm to deliver a bundle of sperm directly into the female&#x27;s mantle cavity, after which he becomes senescent and dies, while the female deposits fertilised eggs in a den and cares for them until they hatch, after which she also dies. Strategies to defend themselves against predators include the expulsion of ink, the use of camouflage and threat displays, the ability to jet quickly through the water and hide, and even deceit. All octopuses are venomous, but only the blue-ringed octopuses are known to be deadly to humans.

Octopuses appear in mythology as sea monsters like the kraken of Norway and the Akkorokamui of the Ainu, and possibly the Gorgon of ancient Greece. A battle with an octopus appears in Victor Hugo&#x27;s book &quot;Toilers of the Sea&quot;, inspiring other works such as Ian Fleming&#x27;s &quot;Octopussy&quot;. Octopuses appear in Japanese erotic art, &quot;shunga&quot;. They are eaten and considered a delicacy by humans in many parts of the world, especially the Mediterranean and the Asian seas.

==Etymology and pluralisation==

The scientific Latin term was derived from Ancient Greek (), a compound form of (, &#x27;eight&#x27;) and (, &#x27;foot&#x27;), itself a variant form of , a word used for example by Alexander of Tralles ( – ) for the common octopus. The standard pluralised form of &quot;octopus&quot; in English is &quot;octopuses&quot;; the Ancient Greek plural , (), has also been used historically. The alternative plural &quot;octopi&quot; is usually considered incorrect because it wrongly assumes that &quot;octopus&quot; is a Latin second-declension noun or adjective when, in either Greek or Latin, it is a third-declension noun.

Historically, the first plural to commonly appear in English language sources, in the early 19th century, is the Latinate form &quot;octopi&quot;, followed by the English form &quot;octopuses&quot; in the latter half of the same century. The Hellenic plural is roughly contemporary in usage, although it is also the rarest.

&quot;Fowler&#x27;s Modern English Usage&quot; states that the only acceptable plural in English is &quot;octopuses&quot;, that &quot;octopi&quot; is misconceived, and &quot;octopodes&quot; pedantic; the last is nonetheless used frequently enough to be acknowledged by the descriptivist &quot;Merriam-Webster 11th Collegiate Dictionary&quot; and &quot;Webster&#x27;s New World College Dictionary&quot;. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; lists &quot;octopuses&quot;, &quot;octopi&quot;, and &quot;octopodes&quot;, in that order, reflecting frequency of use, calling &quot;octopodes&quot; rare and noting that &quot;octopi&quot; is based on a misunderstanding. The &quot;New Oxford American Dictionary&quot; (3rd Edition, 2010) lists &quot;octopuses&quot; as the only acceptable pluralisation, and indicates that &quot;octopodes&quot; is still occasionally used, but that &quot;octopi&quot; is incorrect.

==Anatomy and physiology==
===Size===

The giant Pacific octopus (&quot;Enteroctopus dofleini&quot;) is often cited as the largest known octopus species. Adults usually weigh , with an arm span of up to . The largest specimen of this species to be scientifically documented was an animal with a live mass of . Much larger sizes have been claimed for the giant Pacific octopus: one specimen was recorded as with an arm span of . A carcass of the seven-arm octopus, &quot;Haliphron atlanticus&quot;, weighed and was estimated to have had a live mass of . The smallest species is &quot;Octopus wolfi&quot;, which is around and weighs less than .

===External characteristics===
The octopus has an elongated body that is bilaterally symmetrical along its dorso-ventral (back to belly) axis; the head and foot are on the ventral side but act as the anterior (front) of the animal. The heads contains both the mouth and the brain. The mouth has a sharp chitinous beak and is surrounded by and underneath the foot, which evolved into flexible, prehensile cephalopod limbs, known as &quot;arms&quot;, which are attached to each other near their base by a webbed structure. The arms can be described based on side and sequence position (such as L1, R1, L2, R2) and divided into four pairs. The two rear appendages are generally used to walk on the sea floor, while the other six are used to forage for food. The bulbous and hollow mantle is fused to the back of the head and contains most of the vital organs. The mantle also has a cavity with muscular walls and a pair of gills; it is connected to the exterior by a funnel or siphon.

The skin consists of a thin outer epidermis with mucous cells and sensory cells and a fibrous inner dermis made of collagen and containing various cells allowing colour change. Most of the body is made of soft tissue, allowing it to squeeze through tiny gaps; even the larger species can pass through a gap little more than in diameter. Lacking skeletal support, the arms work as muscular hydrostats and contain longitudinal, transverse and circular muscles around a central axial nerve. They can squash and stretch, coil at any place in any direction or stiffen.

The interior surfaces of the arms are covered with circular, adhesive suckers. The suckers allow the octopus to secure itself in place or to handle objects. Each sucker is usually circular and bowl-like and has two distinct parts: an outer disc-shaped infundibulum and a inner cup-like called an acetabulum, both of which are thick muscles covered in connective tissue. A chitinous cuticle lines the outer surface. When a sucker attaches to a surface, the orifice between the two structures is sealed and the infundibulm flattens. Muscle contractions allow for attachment and detachment. Each of the eight arms senses and responds to light, allowing the octopus to control the limbs even if its head is obscured.

The cranium of the octopus has two cartilaginous capsules which contain each of the animal&#x27;s large eyes, which resemble those of fish. The cornea of the eye is formed from a translucent epidermal layer; the slit-shaped pupil forms a hole in the iris just behind the cornea. The lens hangs behind the pupil; photoreceptive retinal cells lines the back of the eye. The pupil can expand and contract; a retinal pigment screens incident light in bright conditions.

Some species differ in form from the typical octopus body shape. Basal species, the Cirrina, have two fins located above the eyes, an internal shell and mostly webbed arms that are lined with fleshy papillae or cirri underneath. &quot;Grimpoteuthis&quot; in particular has a stout gelatinous body.

===Circulatory system===
Octopuses have a closed circulatory system, in which the blood remains inside blood vessels. Octopuses have three hearts; a systemic or main heart that circulates blood around the body and two branchial or gill hearts that pump it through each of the two gills. The systemic heart becomes inactive when the animal is swimming. Thus, the octopus loses energy quickly and mostly crawls. Octopus blood contains the copper-rich protein haemocyanin to transport oxygen. This makes the blood very viscous and it requires great pressure to pump it around the body; octopuses&#x27; blood pressures can supress . In cold conditions with low oxygen levels, haemocyanin transports oxygen more efficiently than haemoglobin. The haemocyanin is dissolved in the plasma instead of being carried within blood cells and gives the blood a bluish colour.

The systemic heart has muscular contractile walls and consists of a single ventricle and two atria, which attach it to each of the two gills. The blood vessels consist of arteries, capillaries and veins and are lined with a cellular endothelium which is quite unlike that of most other invertebrates. The blood circulates through the aorta and capillary system, to the venae cavae, after which the blood is pumped through the gills by the branchial hearts and back to the main heart. Much of the venous system is contractile, which helps circulate the blood.

===Respiration===
Respiration involves drawing water into the mantle cavity through an aperture, passing it through the gills, and expelling it through the siphon. The ingress of water is achieved by contraction of radial muscles in the mantle wall, and flapper valves shut when strong circular muscles force the water out through the siphon. Extensive connective tissue lattices support the respiratory muscles and allow them to inflate respiratory chamber. The lamella structure of the gills allows for a high oxygen uptake, up to 65% in water at . Respiration can also play a role in locomotion, and an octopus can propel its body when shooting water out of the siphon.

The thin skin of the octopus absorbs additional oxygen. When resting, around 41% of an octopus&#x27;s oxygen absorption is through the skin. Only 33% of oxygen is through the skin when the octopus swims,despite the amount of oxygen absorption increasing as water flows over the body. When it is resting after a meal, absorption through the skin can drop to 3% of its total oxygen uptake.

===Digestion and excretion===
The digestive system of the octopus begins with the buccal mass which consists of the mouth with the beak, the pharynx, radula and salivary glands. The radula is a serrated organ made of chitin. Food is broken down and is forced into the osophagus by two lateral extensions of the esophageal side walls in addition to the radula. From there it is transferred to the gastrointestinal tract, which is mostly suspended from the roof of the mantle cavity. The tract consists of a crop, where the food is stored; a stomach, where it is smushed with other gut material; a caecum where the now sludgy food is separated into particles and liquids and which also absorbs fats; the digestive gland, where liver cells break down and absorb the fluid and become &quot;brown bodies&quot;; and the intestine, where the built-up waste is turned into faecal ropes by secretions and ejected out of the funnel via the rectum.

During osmoregulation, fluid is added to the pericardia of the branchial hearts. The octopus has two nephridia (equivalent to vertebrate kidneys) which are associated with the branchial hearts; these and their associated ducts connect the pericardial cavities with the mantle cavity. Each branch of the vena cava have renal appendages which pass over the thin-walled nephridium before reaching to the branchial heart. Urine is first created in the pericardial cavity, and is altered by excretion, of mostly ammonia, and absorption from the renal appendages, as it is passed along the associated duct and through the nephridiopore into the mantle cavity.

===Nervous system and senses===
Octopuses and their relatives have a more expansive and complex nervous system than other invertebrates, containing over 500 million neurons, around the same as a dog. Only part of it is localised in its brain, which is contained in a cartilaginous capsule. Two-thirds of an octopus&#x27;s neurons are in the nerve cords of its arms. This allows their arms to perform actions with a level of independence. Learning is mainly done in the brain, but an arm makes a decision when supplied with information. Unlike in many other animals, including other mollusks, the complex motor skills of octopuses and their relatives are not organised in their brains via internal somatotopic maps of their bodies Octopuses have the same jumping genes that are active in the human brain, implying an evolutionary convergence at molecular level.

Like other cephalopods, octopuses have camera-like eyes. Colour vision appears to vary from species to species, for example, being present in &quot;O. aegina&quot; but absent in &quot;O. vulgaris&quot;. 
Opsins in the skin respond to different wavelengths of light and help the animals choose a colouration that camouflages them; the chromatophores in the skin can respond to light independently of the eyes.
An alternative hypothesis is that cephalopod eyes in species that only have a single photoreceptor protein may use chromatic aberration to turn monochromatic vision into colour vision, though this sacrifices image quality. This would explain pupils shaped like the letter &quot;U&quot;, the letter &quot;W&quot;, or a dumbbell, as well as the need for colourful mating displays.

Attached to the otic capules are two organs called statocysts (sac-like structures containing a mineralised mass and sensitive hairs), that allow the octopus to sense the orientation of its body, relative to both gravity and time (angular acceleration). An autonomic response keeps the octopus&#x27;s eyes oriented so that the pupil is always horizontal. Octopuses may also use the statocyst to hear sound. The common octopus can hear sounds between 400 Hz and 1000 Hz, and hears best at 600 Hz.

Octopuses have an excellent somatosensory system. Their suction cups are equipped with chemoreceptors so they can taste what they touch. Octopus arms move easily because the sensors recognise octopus skin and prevent self-attachment. Octopuses appear to have poor proprioceptive sense and must observe the arms visually to keep track of their position.

===Ink sac===

The ink sac of an octopus is located under the digestive gland. A gland attached to the sac produces the ink, and the sac holds it. The sac is close enough to the funnel for the octopus to shoot out the ink with a water jet. As the animal begins to shoot, the ink passes through glands which mix it with mucus and it leaves the funnel as a thick, dark blob which allows the animal to escape from a predator. The main pigment in the ink is melanin, which gives it its black colour. Cirrate octopuses usually lack the ink sac.

==Life cycle==

===Reproduction===
Octopuses have two sexes and have only one gonad (testis in males and ovary in females) which is posteriorly-located. The gonad deposits gametes into an adjacent cavity called the gonocoel. A gonoduct bridges the gonocoel with the mantle cavity. An optic gland creates hormones that cause the octopus to mature and age and stimulate gamete production. The timing of reproduction and lifespan depends on environmental conditions such as temperature, light and nutrition, which trigger the gland. The male has a specialised arm called a hectocotylus which it uses to transfer spermatophores (packets of sperm) into the female&#x27;s mantle cavity. The hectocotylus in &quot;Octopus&quot; is usually the R3 arm, which has a spoon-shaped depression and a suckerless tip. Fertilisation may occurs in the mantle cavity or in the surrounding water.

The reproduction has been studied in some species. In the giant Pacific octopus, courtship includes changes in skin texture and colour, mostly in the male. The male may cling to the top or side of the female or position himself beside her. There is some speculation that he may first use his hectocotylus to remove any spermatophore or sperm already present in the female. He picks up a spermatophore from his spermatophoric sac with the hectocotylus, inserts it into the female&#x27;s mantle cavity, and deposits it in the correct location in the opening of the oviduct. Two spermatophores are transferred in this way; these are about one metre (yard) long, and the empty ends may protrude from the female&#x27;s mantle. A complex hydraulic mechanism releases the sperm from the spermatophore. 

The eggs have large yolks; cleavage (division) is relatively shallow and a germinal disc develops at the pole. During gastrulation, the disc and surround the yolk, forming a yolk sac, which eventually forms part of the gut. The embryo forms as the dorsal side of the disc grows upward, with a shell gland, gills, mantle and eyes on its dorsal side. The arms and funnel form on the ventral side of the disc, with the former moving upward to surround the mouth. The embryo consumes the yolk during development. 

Over a month after mating, Giant Pacific octopuses lay eggs. The species can lay 180,000 eggs in a single clutch, while &quot;Octopus rubescens&quot; clutches number up to 45,000 eggs and &quot;O. vulgaris&quot; clutches can number as much as 500,000 eggs. Fertilised octopus eggs are layed as strings and within a shelter. Female giant Pacific octopuses nurture and protect their for five months (160 days) until they hatch. In colder waters, such as those off Alaska, it may take up to ten months for the eggs to completely develop. In the argonaut (paper nautilus), the female is much larger than the male. She secretes a thin shell shaped like a cornucopia, in which the eggs are deposited and in which she also resides and broods the young while swimming.

Most young octopuses hatch as paralarvae, &quot;Octopus&quot; larave in particular are planktonic for weeks or months. Octopus larave feed on shrimps, isopods and amphipods, eventually settling on the ocean floor and developing into adults. Octopus species that produce larger eggs instead hatch as benthic animals similar to the adults. These include the southern blue-ringed, Caribbean reef, California two-spot and &quot;Eledone moschata&quot;

===Lifespan===

Octopuses have short lifespans living for up to four years, and the lifecycles of some species finish in less than half a year. For most octopuses, the last stage of their life is called senescence. It is the breakdown of cellular function without repair or replacement. It may last from weeks to a few months, at most. Males enter senesce after maturity while for females, it is noticeable after they lay a clutch of eggs. During senescence, an octopus does not feed and quickly weakens and becomes sluggish. Lesions begin to form and the octopus literally degenerates. They may die of starvation or get picked off by predators. Senescence is trigger by the optic glands and experimental removal of them after spawning was found to result in the continuation of their lifecycle and activity as well as longer lifespans. It has been proposed that the naturally short lifespan may prevent rapid overpopulation.

==Distribution and habitat==
Octopuses live in every ocean, and different species have adapted to different marine habitats. As juveniles, common octopuses inhabit shallow tide pools. The Hawaiian day octopus (&quot;Octopus cyanea&quot;) lives on coral reefs; argonauts float in pelagic waters. &quot;Abdopus aculeatus&quot; is a near-shore species and can be found in seagrass beds. Some species can survive in deeper environments. The spoon-armed octopus (&quot;Bathypolypus arcticus&quot;) can live deep, and &quot;Vulcanoctopus hydrothermalis&quot; lives in depths of around hydrothermal vents. Some species, such as &quot;Megaleledone setebos&quot; and &quot;Pareledone charcoti&quot;, can surive in the chilling waters of the Antarctic, which reach . No species are known to live in fresh water.

The cirrate species are often free-swimming and live in deep-water habitats. Although several species are known to live at bathyal and abyssal depths, there is only a single indisputable record of an octopus in the hadal zone; a species of &quot;Grimpoteuthis&quot; (dumbo octopus) photographed at .

==Behaviour and ecology==

Octopuses are considered to be mostly solitary though a few are known to occur in high densities and interact regularly, usually in the context of dominance and reproductive competition. This is likely the result of abundant food supplies combined with less den sites. The Larger Pacific striped octopus has been described as particularly social, living in groups of up to 40 individuals. Octopuses hide in dens, which are typically crevices in rocky or other hard structures, including man-made ones. Small species will even use abandoned shells and bottles. They can navigate back to a den without having to retrace their outward route. They are not migratory.

Octopuses bring captured prey to the den to eat. Dens are often surrounded by a midden of dead and uneaten food items. These middens may attract scavengers like fish, molluscs and echinoderms. On rare occasions, octopuses hunt cooperatively with other species, with fish as their partners. They regulate the species composition of the hunting and the behavior of their by punching them.

===Feeding===
Nearly all octopuses are predatory; bottom-dwelling octopuses eat mainly crustaceans, polychaete worms, and other molluscs such as whelks and clams; open-ocean octopuses eat mainly prawns, fish and other cephalopods. Major items in the diet of the giant Pacific octopus include bivalve molluscs such as the cockle &quot;Clinocardium nuttallii&quot;, clams and scallops and crustaceans such as crabs and spider crabs. Prey that it is likely to reject include moon snails because they are too large and limpets, rock scallops, chitons and abalone, because they are too securely fixed to the rock. Small cirrate octopuses such as those of the genera &quot;Grimpoteuthis&quot; and &quot;Opisthoteuthis&quot; typically prey on polychaetes, copepods, amphipods and isopods.

A benthic (bottom-dwelling) octopus typically moves among the rocks and feels through the crevices. The creature may make a jet-propelled pounce on prey and pull it toward the mouth with its arms, the suckers restraining it. Small prey may be completely trapped by the webbed structure. Octopuses usually inject crustaceans like crabs with a paralysing saliva then dismember them with their beaks. Octopuses feed on shelled molluscs either by forcing the valves apart, or by drilling a hole in the shell to inject a nerve toxin. It used to be thought that the hole was drilled by the radula, but it has now been shown that minute teeth at the tip of the salivary papilla are involved, and an enzyme in the toxic saliva is used to dissolve the calcium carbonate of the shell. It takes about three hours for &quot;O. vulgaris&quot; to create a hole. Once the shell is penetrated, the prey dies almost instantaneously, its muscles relax, and the soft tissues are easy for the octopus to remove. Crabs may also be treated in this way; tough-shelled species are more likely to be drilled, and soft-shelled crabs are torn apart.

Some species have other modes of feeding. &quot;Grimpoteuthis&quot; has a reduced or non-existent radula and swallows prey whole. In the deep-sea genus &quot;Stauroteuthis&quot;, some of the muscle cells that control the suckers in most species have been replaced with photophores which are believed to fool prey by directing them to the mouth, making them one of the few bioluminescent octopuses.

===Locomotion===

Octopuses mainly move about by relatively slow crawling with some swimming in a head-first position. Jet propulsion or backward swimming, is their fastest means of locomotion, followed by swimming and crawling. When in no hurry, they usually crawl on either solid or soft surfaces. Several arms are extended forward, some of the suckers adhere to the substrate and the animal hauls itself forward with its powerful arm muscles, while other arms may push rather than pull. As progress is made, other arms move ahead to repeat these actions and the original suckers detach. During crawling, the heart rate nearly doubles, and the animal requires 10 or 15 minutes to recover from relatively minor exercise.

Most octopuses swim by expelling a jet of water from the mantle through the siphon into the sea. The physical principle behind this is that the force required to accelerate the water through the orifice produces a reaction that propels the octopus in the opposite direction. The direction of travel depends on the orientation of the siphon. When swimming, the head is at the front and the siphon is pointed backward but, when jetting, the visceral hump leads, the siphon points at the head and the arms trail behind, with the animal presenting a fusiform appearance. In an alternative method of swimming, some species flatten themselves dorso-ventrally, and swim with the arms held out sideways; this may provide lift and be faster than normal swimming. Jetting is used to escape from danger, but is physiologically inefficient, requiring a mantle pressure so high as to stop the heart from beating, resulting in a progressive oxygen deficit.

Cirrate octopuses cannot produce jet propulsion and rely on their fins for swimming. They have neutral buoyancy and drift through the water with the fins extended. They can also contract their arms and surrounding web to make sudden moves known as &quot;take-offs&quot;. Another form of locomotion is &quot;pumping&quot;, which involves symmetrical contractions of muscles in their webs producing peristaltic waves. This moves the body slowly.

In 2005, &quot;Adopus aculeatus&quot; and veined octopus (&quot;Amphioctopus marginatus&quot;) were found to walk on two arms, while at the same time mimicking plant matter. This form of locomotion allows these octopuses to move quickly away from a potential predator without being recognised. Some species of octopus can crawl out of the water briefly, which they may do between tide pools. &quot;Stilt walking&quot; is used by the veined octopus when carrying stacked coconut shells. The octopus carries the shells underneath it with two arms, and progresses with an ungainly gait supported by its remaining arms held rigid.

===Intelligence===


Octopuses are highly intelligent. Maze and problem-solving experiments have shown evidence of a memory system that can store both short- and long-term memory. Young octopuses learn nothing from their parents, as adults provide no parental care beyond tending to their eggs until the young octopuses hatch.

In laboratory experiments, octopuses can readily be trained to distinguish between different shapes and patterns. They have been reported to practise observational learning, although the validity of these findings is contested. Octopuses have also been observed in what has been described as play: repeatedly releasing bottles or toys into a circular current in their aquariums and then catching them. Octopuses often break out of their aquariums and sometimes into others in search of food. Growing evidence suggests that octopuses are sentient and capable of experiencing pain. The veined octopus collects discarded coconut shells, then uses them to build a shelter, an example of tool use.

===Camouflage and colour change===
Octopuses use camouflage when hunting and to avoid predators. To do this, they use specialised skin cells that change the appearance of the skin by adjusting its colour, opacity, or reflectivity. Chromatophores contain yellow, orange, red, brown, or black pigments; most species have three of these colours, while some have two or four. Other colour-changing cells are reflective iridophores and white leucophores. This colour-changing ability is also used to communicate with or warn other octopuses. The energy cost of the complete activation of the chromatophore system is very high equally being nearly as much as all the energy used by an octopus at rest.

Octopuses can create distracting patterns with waves of dark colouration across the body, a display known as the &quot;passing cloud&quot;. Muscles in the skin change the texture of the mantle to achieve greater camouflage. In some species, the mantle can take on the bumpy appearance of algae-covered rocks. Octopuses that are diurnal and live in shallow water have evolved more complex skin than their nocturnal and deep-sea counterparts. In the latter species, skin anatomy is limited to one colour or pattern.

A &quot;moving rock&quot; trick involves the octopus mimicking a rock and then inching across the open space with a speed matching that of the surrounding water.

===Defence===
Aside from humans, octopuses may be preyed on by fishes, seabirds, sea otters, pinnipeds, cetaceans, and other cephalopods. Octopuses typically hide or disguise themselves by camouflage and mimicry; some have conspicuous warning coloration (aposematism) or deimatic behaviour (“bluffing” a seemingly threatening appearance). An octopus may spend 40% of its time hidden away in its den. When the octopus is approached, it may extend an arm to investigate. 66% of &quot;Enteroctopus dofleini&quot; in one study had scars, with 50% having amputated arms. The blue rings of the highly venomous blue-ringed octopus are hidden in muscular skin folds which contract when the animal is threatened, exposing the iridescent warning. The Atlantic white-spotted octopus (&quot;Callistoctopus macropus&quot;) turns bright brownish red with oval white spots all over in a high contrast display. Displays are often reinforced by stretching out the animal&#x27;s arms, fins or web to make it look as big and threatening as possible.

Once they have been seen by a predator, they commonly try to escape but can also create a distraction by ejecting an ink cloud from their ink sac. The ink is thought to reduce the efficiency of olfactory organs, which would aid evasion from predators that employ smell for hunting, such as sharks. Ink clouds of some species might act as pseudomorphs, or decoys that the predator attacks instead.

When under attack, some octopuses can perform arm autotomy, in a manner similar to the way skinks and other lizards detach their tails. The crawling arm may distract would-be predators. Such severed arms remain sensitive to stimuli and move away from unpleasant sensations. Octopuses can replace lost limbs.

Some octopuses, such as the mimic octopus, can combine their highly flexible bodies with their colour-changing ability to mimic other, more dangerous animals, such as lionfish, sea snakes, and eels.

===Pathogens and parasites===
The diseases and parasites that affect octopuses have been little studied, but cephalopods are known to be the intermediate or final hosts of various parasitic cestodes, nematodes and copepods; 150 species of protistan and metazoan parasites have been recognised. The Dicyemidae are a family of tiny worms that are found in the renal appendages of many species; it is unclear whether they are parasitic or endosymbionts. Coccidians in the genus &quot;Aggregata&quot; living in the gut cause severe disease to the host. Octopuses have an innate immune system; their haemocytes respond to infection by phagocytosis, encapsulation, infiltration, or cytotoxic activities to destroy or isolate the pathogens. The haemocytes play an important role in the recognition and elimination of foreign bodies and wound repair. Captive animals are more susceptible to pathogens than wild ones. A gram-negative bacterium, &quot;Vibrio lentus&quot;, can cause skin lesions, exposure of muscle and sometimes death.

==Evolution==
The scientific name Octopoda was first coined and given as the order of octopuses in 1818 by English biologist William Elford Leach, who classified them as Octopoida the previous year. The Octopoda consists of around 300 known species and were historically divided into two suborders, the Incirrina and the Cirrina. More recent evidence suggests Cirrina is merely the most basal species, not a unique clade. The incirrate octopuses (the majority of species) lack the cirri and paired swimming fins of the cirrates. In addition, the internal shell of incirrates is either present as a pair of stylets or absent altogether.

===Fossil history and phylogeny===
The Cephalopoda evolved from a mollusc resembling the Monoplacophora in the Cambrian some 530 million years ago. The Coleoidea diverged from the nautiloids in the Devonian some 416 million years ago. In turn, the coleoids (including the squids and octopods) brought their shells inside the body and some 276 million years ago, during the Permian, split into the Vampyropoda and the Decabrachia. The octopuses arose from the Muensterelloidea within the Vampyropoda in the Jurassic. The earliest octopus likely lived near the sea floor (benthic to demersal) in shallow marine environments. Octopuses consist mostly of soft tissue, and so fossils are relatively rare. As soft-bodied cephalopods, they lack the external shell of most molluscs, including other cephalopods like the nautiloids and the extinct Ammonoidea. They have eight limbs like other Coleoidea, but lack the extra specialised feeding appendages known as tentacles which are longer and thinner with suckers only at their club-like ends. The vampire squid (&quot;Vampyroteuthis&quot;) also lacks tentacles but has sensory filaments.

The cladograms are based on Sanchez et al., 2018, who created a molecular phylogeny based on mitochondrial and nuclear DNA marker sequences. The position of the Eledonidae is from Ibáñez et al., 2020, with a similar methodology. Dates of divergence are from Kröger et al., 2011 and Fuchs et al., 2019.

The molecular analysis of the octopods shows that the suborder Cirrina (Cirromorphida) and the superfamily Argonautoidea are paraphyletic and are broken up; these names are shown in quotation marks and italics on the cladogram.

===RNA editing and the genome===

Octopuses, like other coleoid cephalopods but unlike more basal cephalopods or other molluscs, are capable of greater RNA editing, changing the nucleic acid sequence of the primary transcript of RNA molecules, than any other organisms. Editing is concentrated in the nervous system, and affects proteins involved in neural excitability and neuronal morphology. More than 60% of RNA transcripts for coleoid brains are recoded by editing, compared to less than 1% for a human or fruit fly. Coleoids rely mostly on ADAR enzymes for RNA editing, which requires large double-stranded RNA structures to flank the editing sites. Both the structures and editing sites are conserved in the coleoid genome and the mutation rates for the sites are severely hampered. Hence, greater transcriptome plasticity has come at the cost of slower genome evolution.

The octopus genome is unremarkably bilaterian except for large developments of two gene families: protocadherins, which regulate the development of neurons; and the C2H2 zinc-finger transcription factors. Many genes specific to cephalopods are expressed in the animals&#x27; skin, suckers, and nervous system.

==Relationship to humans==

===In art, literature, and mythology===
Ancient seafaring people were aware of the octopus, as evidenced by artworks and designs. For example, a stone carving found in the archaeological recovery from Bronze Age Minoan Crete at Knossos (1900–1100 BC) depicts a fisherman carrying an octopus. The terrifyingly powerful Gorgon of Greek mythology may have been inspired by the octopus or squid, the octopus itself representing the severed head of Medusa, the beak as the protruding tongue and fangs, and its tentacles as the snakes. The kraken is a legendary sea monster of giant proportions said to dwell off the coasts of Norway and Greenland, usually portrayed in art as a giant octopus attacking ships. Linnaeus included it in the first edition of his 1735 &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. One translation of the Hawaiian creation myth the Kumulipo suggests that the octopus is the lone survivor of a previous age. The Akkorokamui is a gigantic octopus-like monster from Ainu folklore, worshipped in Shinto.

A battle with an octopus plays a significant role in Victor Hugo&#x27;s 1866 book &quot;Travailleurs de la mer&quot; (&quot;Toilers of the Sea&quot;). Ian Fleming&#x27;s 1966 short story collection &quot;Octopussy and The Living Daylights&quot;, and the 1983 &quot;James Bond&quot; film were partly inspired by Hugo&#x27;s book. Japanese erotic art, &quot;shunga&quot;, includes ukiyo-e woodblock prints such as Katsushika Hokusai&#x27;s 1814 print &quot;Tako to ama&quot; (&quot;The Dream of the Fisherman&#x27;s Wife&quot;), in which an ama diver is sexually intertwined with a large and a small octopus. The print is a forerunner of tentacle erotica. The biologist P. Z. Myers noted in his science blog, &quot;Pharyngula&quot;, that octopuses appear in &quot;extraordinary&quot; graphic illustrations involving women, tentacles, and bare breasts.

Since it has numerous arms emanating from a common centre, the octopus is often used as a symbol for a powerful and manipulative organisation, company, or country.

The Beatles song &quot;Octopus&#x27;s Garden&quot;, on the band&#x27;s 1969 album &quot;Abbey Road,&quot; was written by Ringo Starr after he was told about how octopuses travel along the sea bed picking up stones and shiny objects with which to build gardens.

===Danger to humans===
Octopuses generally avoid humans, but incidents have been verified. For example, a Pacific octopus, said to be nearly perfectly camouflaged, &quot;lunged&quot; at a diver and &quot;wrangled&quot; over his camera before it let go. Another diver recorded the encounter on video. All species are venomous, but only blue-ringed octopuses have venom that is lethal to humans. Blue-ringed octopuses are among the deadliest animals in the sea; their bites are reported each year across the animals&#x27; range from Australia to the eastern Indo-Pacific Ocean. They bite only when provoked or accidentally stepped upon; bites are small and usually painless. The venom appears to be able to penetrate the skin without a puncture, given prolonged contact. It contains tetrodotoxin, which causes paralysis by blocking the transmission of nerve impulses to the muscles. This causes death by respiratory failure leading to cerebral anoxia. No antidote is known, but if breathing can be kept going artificially, patients recover within 24 hours. Bites have been recorded from captive octopuses of other species; they leave swellings which do not last very long.

===As a food source===
Octopus fisheries exist around the world with total catches varying between 245,320 and 322,999 metric tons from 1986 to 1995. The world catch peaked in 2007 at 380,000 tons, and had fallen by a tenth by 2012. Methods to capture octopuses include pots, traps, trawls, snares, drift fishing, spearing, hooking and hand collection. Octopuses have a food conversion efficiency greater than that of chickens, making octopus aquaculture a possibility. Octopuses compete with human fisheries targeting other species, and even rob traps and nets for their catch; they may, themselves, be caught as bycatch if they cannot get away.

Octopus is eaten in many cultures, such as those on the Mediterranean and Asian coasts. The arms and other body parts are prepared in ways that vary by species and geography. Live octopuses or their wriggling pieces are consumed as &quot;ikizukuri&quot; in Japanese cuisine and &quot;san-nakji&quot; in Korean cuisine. If not prepared properly, however, the severed arms can still choke the diner with their suction cups, causing at least one death in 2010. Animal welfare groups have objected to the live consumption of octopuses on the basis that they can experience pain.

===In science and technology===

In classical Greece, Aristotle (384–322 BC) commented on the colour-changing abilities of the octopus, both for camouflage and for signalling, in his &quot;Historia animalium&quot;: &quot;The octopus ... seeks its prey by so changing its colour as to render it like the colour of the stones adjacent to it; it does so also when alarmed.&quot; Aristotle noted that the octopus had a hectocotyl arm and suggested it might be used in sexual reproduction. This claim was widely disbelieved until the 19th century. It was described in 1829 by the French zoologist Georges Cuvier, who supposed it to be a parasitic worm, naming it as a new species, &quot;Hectocotylus octopodis&quot;. Other zoologists thought it a spermatophore; the German zoologist Heinrich Müller believed it was &quot;designed&quot; to detach during copulation. In 1856, the Danish zoologist Japetus Steenstrup demonstrated that it is used to transfer sperm, and only rarely detaches.

Octopuses offer many possibilities in biological research, including their ability to regenerate limbs, change the colour of their skin, behave intelligently with a distributed nervous system, and make use of 168 kinds of protocadherins (humans have 58), the proteins that guide the connections neurons make with each other. The California two-spot octopus has had its genome sequenced, allowing exploration of its molecular adaptations. Having independently evolved mammal-like intelligence, octopuses have been compared by the philosopher Peter Godfrey-Smith, who has studied the nature of intelligence, to hypothetical intelligent extraterrestrials. Their problem-solving skills, along with their mobility and lack of rigid structure enable them to escape from supposedly secure tanks in laboratories and public aquariums.

Due to their intelligence, octopuses are listed in some countries as experimental animals on which surgery may not be performed without anesthesia, a protection usually extended only to vertebrates. In the UK from 1993 to 2012, the common octopus (&quot;Octopus vulgaris&quot;) was the only invertebrate protected under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. In 2012, this legislation was extended to include all cephalopods in accordance with a general EU directive.

Some robotics research is exploring biomimicry of octopus features. Octopus arms can move and sense largely autonomously without intervention from the animal&#x27;s central nervous system. In 2015 a team in Italy built soft-bodied robots able to crawl and swim, requiring only minimal computation. In 2017, a German company made an arm with a soft pneumatically controlled silicone gripper fitted with two rows of suckers. It is able to grasp objects such as a metal tube, a magazine, or a ball, and to fill a glass by pouring water from a bottle.

<doc id="22781" wikidata="Q1424662" url="?curid=22781" title="Omniscience">
<text>Omniscience is the capacity to know everything. In Hinduism, Sikhism and the Abrahamic religions, this is an attribute of God. In Jainism, omniscience is an attribute that any individual can eventually attain. In Buddhism, there are differing beliefs about omniscience among different schools.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;omniscience&quot; derives from the Latin word &quot;&quot; (&quot;to know&quot; or &quot;conscious&quot;) and the prefix &quot;&quot; (&quot;all&quot; or &quot;every&quot;), but also means &quot;all-seeing&quot;.

==In religion==
===Buddhism===

The topic of omniscience has been much debated in various Indian traditions, but no more so than by the Buddhists. After Dharmakirti&#x27;s excursions into the subject of what constitutes a valid cognition, Śāntarakṣita and his student Kamalaśīla thoroughly investigated the subject in the Tattvasamgraha and its commentary the Panjika. The arguments in the text can be broadly grouped into four sections:
* The refutation that cognitions, either perceived, inferred, or otherwise, can be used to refute omniscience.
* A demonstration of the possibility of omniscience through apprehending the selfless universal nature of all knowables, by examining what it means to be ignorant and the nature of mind and awareness.
* A demonstration of the total omniscience where all individual characteristics (svalaksana) are available to the omniscient being.
* The specific demonstration of Shakyamuni Buddha&#x27;s non-exclusive omniscience, but the knowledge of Shakyamuni Buddha&#x27;s is really infinite and no other gods or being can match his true omniscience.

===Christianity===

Some modern Christian theologians argue that God&#x27;s omniscience is inherent rather than total, and that God chooses to limit his omniscience in order to preserve the free will and dignity of his creatures. John Calvin, among other theologians of the 16th century, comfortable with the definition of God as being omniscient in the total sense, in order for worthy beings&#x27; abilities to choose freely, embraced the doctrine of predestination.

===Hinduism===
In the Bhakti tradition of Vaishnavism, where Vishnu is worshipped as the supreme God, Vishnu is attributed with numerous qualities such as omniscience, energy, strength, lordship, vigour, and splendour.

===Islam===
God in Islam is attributed with absolute omniscience. God knows the past, the present, and the future. It is compulsory for a Muslim to believe that God is indeed omniscient as stated in one of the six articles of faith which is:
* To believe that God&#x27;s divine decree and predestination

It is believed that humans can only change their predestination (wealth, health, deed etc.) and not divine decree (date of birth, date of death, family etc.), thus allowing free will.

===Baha&#x27;i Faith===
Omniscience is an attribute of God, yet it is also an attribute that reveals sciences to humanity: 

===Jainism===

In Jainism, omniscience is considered the highest type of perception. In the words of a Jain scholar, &quot;The perfect manifestation of the innate nature of the self, arising on the complete annihilation of the obstructive veils, is called omniscience.&quot;

Jainism views infinite knowledge as an inherent capability of every soul. &quot;Arihanta&quot; is the word used by Jains to refer to those human beings who have conquered all inner passions (like attachment, greed, pride, anger) and possess &quot;Kevala Jnana&quot; (infinite knowledge). They are said to be of two kinds:
# &quot;Sāmānya kevali&quot; – omniscient beings (&quot;Kevalins&quot;) who are concerned with their own liberation.
# &quot;Tirthankara kevali&quot; – human beings who attain omniscience and then help others to achieve the same.

==Omniscience and free will==
Whether omniscience, particularly regarding the choices that a human will make, is compatible with free will has been debated by theologians and philosophers. The argument that divine foreknowledge is not compatible with free will is known as theological fatalism. It is argued that if humans are free to choose between alternatives, God could not know what this choice will be.

A question arises: if an omniscient entity knows everything, even about its own decisions in the future, does it therefore forbid any free will to that entity? William Lane Craig states that the question subdivides into two:
# If God foreknows the occurrence of some event E, does E happen necessarily?
# If some event E is contingent, how can God foreknow E&#x27;s occurrence?

However, this kind of argument fails to recognize its use of the modal fallacy. It is possible to show that the first premise of arguments like these is fallacious.

==Omniscience and the privacy of conscious experience==
Some philosophers, such as Patrick Grim, Linda Zagzebski, Stephan Torre, and William Mander have discussed the issue of whether the apparent exclusively first-person nature of conscious experience is compatible with God&#x27;s omniscience. There is a strong sense in which conscious experience is private, meaning that no outside observer can gain knowledge of what it is like to be me &quot;as me&quot;. If a subject cannot know what it is like to be another subject in an objective manner, the question is whether that limitation applies to God as well. If it does, then God cannot be said to be omniscient since there is then a form of knowledge that God lacks access to.

The philosopher Patrick Grim most notably raised this issue. Linda Zagzebski argued against this by introducing the notion of &quot;perfect empathy&quot;, a proposed relation that God can have to subjects that would allow God to have perfect knowledge of their conscious experience. William Mander argued that God can only have such knowledge if our experiences are part of God&#x27;s broader experience. Stephan Torre claimed that God can have such knowledge if self-knowledge involves the ascription of properties, either to oneself or to others.

<doc id="22784" wikidata="Q1969923" url="?curid=22784" title="Amiga Original Chip Set">
<text>The Original Chip Set (OCS) is a chipset used in the earliest Commodore Amiga computers and defined the Amiga&#x27;s graphics and sound capabilities. It was succeeded by the slightly improved Enhanced Chip Set (ECS) and the greatly improved Advanced Graphics Architecture (AGA).

The original chipset appeared in Amiga models built between 1985 and 1990: the Amiga 1000, Amiga 2000, Amiga CDTV, and Amiga 500.

==Overview of chips==
The chipset which gave the Amiga its unique graphics features consists of three main &quot;custom&quot; chips: &quot;Agnus&quot;, &quot;Denise&quot;, and &quot;Paula&quot;. Both the original chipset and the enhanced chipset were manufactured using NMOS logic technology by Commodore&#x27;s chip manufacturing subsidiary, MOS Technology. According to Jay Miner, the OCS chipset was fabricated in 5 μm manufacturing process while AGA Lisa was implemented in 1.5 μm process. All three custom chips were originally packaged in 48-pin DIPs; later versions of Agnus, known as Fat Agnus, were packaged in an 84-pin PLCC.

Agnus is the central chip in the design. It controls all access to chip RAM from both the central 68000 processor and the other custom chips, using a complicated priority system. Agnus includes sub-components known as the &quot;blitter&quot; (fast transfer of data in memory without the intervention of the processor) and the &quot;Copper&quot; (video-synchronized co-processor). The original Agnus can address of chip RAM. Later revisions, dubbed &#x27;Fat Agnus&#x27;, added pseudo-fast RAM, which for ECS was changed to 1 MB (sometimes called &#x27;Fatter Agnus&#x27;) and subsequently to 2 MB chip RAM.

Denise is the main video processor. Without using overscan, the Amiga&#x27;s graphics display is 320 or 640 pixels wide by 200 (NTSC) or 256 (PAL) pixels tall. Denise also supports interlacing, which doubles the vertical resolution, at the cost of intrusive flickering on typical monitors of that era. Planar bitmap graphics are used, which splits the individual bits per pixel into separate areas of memory, called bitplanes. In normal operation, Denise allows between one and five bitplanes, giving two to 32 unique colors. These colors are selected from a palette of 4096 colors (four bits per RGB component). A 6th bitplane is available for two special video modes: Halfbrite mode and Hold-And-Modify (HAM) mode. Denise also supports eight sprites, single pixel scrolling, and a &quot;dual-playfield&quot; mode. Denise also handles mouse and digital joystick input.

Paula is primarily the audio chip, with four independent hardware-mixed 8-bit PCM sound channels, each of which supports 65 volume levels (no sound to maximum volume) and waveform output rates from roughly 20 samples per second to almost 29,000 samples per second. Paula also handles interrupts and various I/O functions including the floppy disk drive, the serial port, and analog joysticks.

There are many similarities both in overall functionality and in the division of functionality into the three component chips between the OCS chipset and the much earlier and simpler chipset of the Atari 8-bit computers, consisting of the ANTIC, GTIA and POKEY chips; both chipsets were conceptually designed by Jay Miner, which explains the similarity.

==Agnus==
The Agnus chip is in overall control of the entire chipset&#x27;s operation. All operations are synchronised to the position of the video beam. This includes access to the built-in RAM, known as chip RAM because the chipset has access to it. Both the central 68000 processor and other members of the chipset have to arbitrate for access to chip RAM via &quot;Agnus&quot;. In computing architecture terms, this is Direct Memory Access (DMA), where Agnus is the DMA Controller (DMAC).

Agnus has a complex and priority-based memory access policy that attempts to best coordinate requests for memory access among competing resources. For example, bitplane data fetches are prioritized over blitter transfers as the immediate display of frame buffer data is considered more important than the processing of memory by the blitter. Agnus also attempts to order accesses in such a way so as to overlap CPU bus cycles with DMA cycles. As the original 68000 processor in Amigas tended only to access memory on every second available memory cycle, Agnus operates a system where &quot;odd&quot; memory access cycles are allocated first and as needed to time-critical custom chip DMA while any remaining cycles are available to the CPU, thus the CPU does not generally get locked out of memory access and does not appear to slow down. However, non-time-critical custom chip access, such as &quot;blitter&quot; transfers, can use up any spare odd or even cycles and, if the &quot;BLITHOG&quot; (blitter hog) flag is set, Agnus can lock out the even cycles from the CPU in deference to the &quot;blitter&quot;.

Agnus&#x27;s timings are measured in &quot;color clocks&quot; of 280 ns. This is equivalent to two low resolution (140 ns) pixels or four high resolution (70 ns) pixels. Like Denise, these timings were designed for display on household TVs, and can be synchronized to an external clock source.

===Blitter===
The &quot;blitter&quot; is a sub-component of Agnus. &quot;Blit&quot; is shorthand for &quot;block image transfer&quot; or bit blit. The blitter is a highly parallel memory transfer and logic operation unit. It has three modes of operation: copying blocks of memory, filling blocks (e.g. polygon filling) and line drawing.

The blitter allows rapid copying of video memory, meaning that the CPU can be freed for other tasks. The blitter was primarily used for drawing and redrawing graphics images on the screen, called &quot;bobs&quot;, short for &quot;blitter objects&quot;.

The blitter&#x27;s block copying mode takes zero to three data sources in memory, called A, B and C, performs a programmable Boolean function on the data sources and writes the result to a destination area, D. Any of these four areas can overlap. The blitter runs either from the start of the block to the end, known as &quot;ascending&quot; mode, or in reverse, &quot;descending&quot; mode.

Blocks are &quot;rectangular&quot;; they have a &quot;width&quot; in multiples of 16 bits, a height measured in &quot;lines&quot;, and a &quot;stride&quot; distance to move from the end of one line to the next. This allows the blitter to operate on any video resolution up to 1,024×1,024 pixels. The copy automatically performs a per-pixel logical operation. These operations are described generically using minterms. This is most commonly used to do direct copies (D = A), or apply a pixel mask around blitted objects (D = (C AND B) OR A). The copy can also barrel shift each line by 0 to 15 pixels. This allows the blitter to draw at pixel offsets that are not exactly multiples of 16.

These functions allow the Amiga to move GUI windows around the screen rapidly as each is represented in graphical memory space as a rectangular block of memory which may be shifted to any required screen memory location at will.

The blitter&#x27;s line mode draws single-pixel thick lines using Bresenham&#x27;s line algorithm. It can also apply a 16-bit repeating pattern to the line. The line mode can also be used to draw rotated bobs: each line of bob data is used as line pattern while the line mode draws the tilted bob line by line.

The blitter&#x27;s filling mode is used to fill per-line horizontal spans. On each span, it reads each pixel in turn from right to left. Whenever it reads a set pixel, it toggles filling mode on or off. When filling mode is on, it sets every pixel until filling mode is turned off or the line ends. Together, these modes allow the blitter to draw individual flat-shaded polygons. Later Amigas tended to use a combination of a faster CPU and blitter for many operations.

===Copper===
The &quot;Copper&quot; is another sub-component of Agnus; The name is short for &quot;co-processor&quot;. The Copper is a programmable finite-state machine that executes a programmed instruction stream, synchronized with the video hardware.

When it is turned on, the Copper has three states; either reading an instruction, executing it, or waiting for a specific video beam position. The Copper runs a program called the &quot;Copper list&quot; in parallel with the main CPU. The Copper runs in sync with the video beam, and it can be used to perform various operations which require video synchronization. Most commonly it is used to control video output, but it can write to most of the chipset registers and thus can be used to initiate blits, set audio registers, or interrupt the CPU.

The Copper list has three kinds of instructions, each one being a pair of two bytes, four bytes in total:

* The MOVE instruction writes a 16-bit value into one of the chipset&#x27;s hardware registers and is also used to strobe a new address into the Copper&#x27;s instruction pointer.

* The WAIT instruction halts Copper execution until a given beam position is reached, thus making possible to synchronize other instructions with respect to screen drawing. It can also wait for a blitter operation to finish. During a wait state the copper is off the bus and doesn&#x27;t use DMA cycles.

* The SKIP instruction will skip the following Copper instruction if a given beam position has already been reached. This can be used to create Copper list loops.
The length of the Copper list program is limited by execution time. The Copper restarts executing the Copper list at the start of each new video frame. There is no explicit &quot;end&quot; instruction; instead, the WAIT instruction is used to wait for a location which is never reached.

====Uses of the Copper====
* The Copper is most commonly used to set and reset the video hardware registers at the beginning of each frame.
* It can be used to change video settings mid-frame. This allows the Amiga to change video configuration, including resolution, between scanlines. This allows the Amiga to display different horizontal resolutions, different color depths, and entirely different frame buffers on the same screen. The AmigaOS graphical user interface allows two or more programs to operate at different resolutions in different buffers, while all are visible on the screen simultaneously. A paint program might use this feature to allow users to draw directly on a low resolution Hold-And-Modify (HAM) screen, while offering a high resolution toolbar at the top or bottom of the screen.
* The Copper can also change color registers mid-frame, creating the &quot;raster bars&quot; effect seen commonly in Amiga games. The Copper can go further than this and change the background color often enough to make a blocky graphics display without using any bitmap graphics at all.
* The Copper allows &quot;re-use&quot; of sprites; after a sprite has been drawn at its programmed location, the Copper can then immediately move it to a new location and it will be drawn again, even on the same scanline.
* The Copper can trigger an interrupt when the video beam reaches a precise location on the display. This is useful for synchronizing the CPU to the video beam.
* The Copper can also be used to program and operate the blitter. This allows blitter operation and control to proceed independently of, and concurrently with, the CPU. With copper and blitter programming each other a text mode can be emulated.
* The Copper can be used to produce &quot;sliced HAM&quot;, or S-HAM, this consists of building a Copper list that switches the palette on every scanline, improving the choice of base colors in Hold-And-Modify mode graphics.

===External video timing===
Under normal circumstances, the Amiga generates its own video timings, but Agnus also supports synchronising the system to an external signal so as to achieve genlocking with external video hardware. There is also a 1-bit output on this connector that indicates whether the Amiga is outputting background color or not, permitting easy overlaying of Amiga video onto external video. This made the Amiga particularly attractive as a character generator for titling videos and broadcast work, as it avoided the use and expense of A/B roll and chroma key units that would be required without the genlock support. The support of overscan, interlacing and genlocking capabilities, and the fact that the display timing was very close to broadcast standards (NTSC or PAL), made the Amiga the first ideal computer for video purposes, and indeed, it was used in many studios for digitizing video data (sometimes called frame-grabbing), subtitling and interactive video news.

==Denise==

Denise is programmed to fetch planar video data from one to five bitplanes and translate that into a color lookup. The number of bitplanes is arbitrary, thus if 32 colors are not needed, 2, 4, 8 or 16 can be used instead. The number of bitplanes (and resolution) can be changed on the fly, usually by the Copper. This allows for very economical use of RAM, and balancing of CPU processing speed vs graphical sophistication when executing from Chip RAM (as modes beyond 4bpp in low resolution, or 2bpp in high resolution, use extra DMA channels that can slow or temporarily halt the CPU in addition to the usual non-conflicting channels). There can also be a sixth bitplane, which can be used in three special graphics modes:

* In Extra-HalfBrite (EHB), if a pixel is set on the sixth bitplane, the brightness of the regular 32 color pixel is halved. Early versions of the Amiga 1000 sold in the United States did not have the Extra-HalfBrite mode.

* In Hold-And-Modify (HAM) mode, each 6-bit pixel is interpreted as two control bits and four data bits. The four possible permutations of control bits are &quot;set&quot;, &quot;modify red&quot;, &quot;modify green&quot; and &quot;modify blue&quot;. With &quot;set&quot;, the four data bits act like a regular 16-color display look up. With one of the &quot;modify&quot;s, the red, green or blue component of the previous pixel is modified to the data value, and the other two components are held from the previous pixel. This allows all 4096 colors on screen at once and is an example of lossy image compression in hardware.

* In dual-playfield mode, instead of acting as a single screen, two &quot;playfields&quot; of eight colors each (three bitplanes each) are drawn on top of each other. They are independently scrollable and the background color of the top playfield &quot;shines through&quot; to the underlying playfield.

There are two horizontal graphics resolutions, &quot;lowres&quot; with 140 ns pixels and &quot;hires&quot; with 70 ns pixels, with a default of 320 or 640 horizontal pixels wide without using overscan. As the pixel output is regulated by the main system clock, which is based directly on the NTSC colorburst clock, these sizes very nearly fill the width of a standard television with only a thin &quot;underscan&quot; border between the graphics and the screen border when compared to many other contemporary home computers, for an appearance closer to a games console but with finer detail. On top of this, Denise supports reasonably extensive overscan; technically modes with enough data for up to 400 or 800 pixels (+25%) may be specified, although this is only actually useful for scrolling and special effects that involve partial display of large graphics, as a separate hardware limit is met at 368 (or 736) pixels, which is the maximum that will fit between the end of one blanking period and the start of the next - although it is unlikely that even this many pixels will be visible on any display other than a dedicated monitor that allows adjustment of horizontal scan width, as much of the image will, by design, disappear seamlessly behind the screen bezel (or, on LCDs, be cropped off at the edge of the panel). Because of the highly regular structure of the Amiga&#x27;s timing in relation to scanlines and allocation of DMA resources to various uses besides normal &quot;playfield&quot; graphics, increased horizontal resolution is also a tradeoff between number of pixels and how many hardware sprites are available, as increasing the DMA slots dedicated to playfield video ends up stealing some (from 1 to 7 of the total 8) the sprite engine..

Vertical resolution, without overscan, is 200 pixels for a 60 Hz NTSC Amiga or 256 for a 50 Hz PAL Amiga. This can be doubled using an interlaced display, and, as with horizontal resolution, increased using overscan, to a maximum of 241 (or 483) for NTSC, and 283 (or 567) for PAL (interlaced modes gaining one extra line as the maximum is determined by how many lines are taken from the available total by blanking and sync, and the total scanlines in non-interlaced modes are half the original, broadcast-spec odd-numbered interlaced counts, rounded down). 

Starting with ECS, Denise was upgraded to support &quot;Productivity&quot; mode which allowed for 640x400 non-interlaced albeit with only 4 colors.

Denise can composite up to eight 16-pixel-wide sprites per scan line (in automatic mode) on top, underneath, or between playfields, and detect collisions between sprites and the playfields or between sprites. These sprites have three visible colors and one transparent color. Optionally, adjacent pairs of sprites can be &quot;attached&quot; to make a single 15-color sprite. The Sprite DMA reads data to form a sprite channel as controlled by its registers, enabling the vertical reuse of sprites. There has to be one empty scanline in between two successive list entries to allow for updating sprite data. Using Copper or CPU register manipulations, each sprite &quot;channel&quot; can be reused multiple times in a single frame to increase the total sprites per frame. Sprite &quot;position&quot; registers may also be changed during a scanline, increasing the total number of sprites on a single scanline. However, the sprite &quot;data&quot;, or shape, is only fetched a single time per scanline and can&#x27;t change. The first Amiga game to utilize the sprite re-position registers during a scanline was &quot;Hybris&quot; released in 1988.

The Denise chip does not support a dedicated text mode.

Finally, Denise next to the CIAs is responsible for handling mouse/joystick X/Y inputs.

The notion that Denise fetches bit plane and sprite data is a simplification. It is Agnus who is maintaining horizontal and vertical screen position counters and initiating the DRAM read operations. Denise has a number of bit plane registers which hold 16 bits of data each, enough to draw 16 pixels. When Agnus issues a write to register 1, all registers are then transferred into separate shift registers from which pixels are generated (at the same time new values are loaded from DRAM). Denise is not aware of any memory addresses either.

==Paula==
The Paula chip, designed by Glenn Keller, from MOS Technology, is the interrupt controller, but also includes logic for audio playback, floppy disk drive control, serial port input/output and mouse/joystick buttons two and three signals. The logic remained functionally identical across all Amiga models from Commodore.

===Audio===
Paula has four DMA-driven 8-bit PCM sound channels. Two sound channels are mixed into the left audio output, and the other two are mixed into the right output, producing stereo audio output. The only supported hardware sample format is signed linear 8-bit two&#x27;s complement. Each sound channel has an independent frequency and a 6-bit volume control (64 levels). Internally, the audio hardware is implemented by four state machines, each having eight different states.

Additionally the hardware allows one channel in a channel pair to modulate the other channel&#x27;s period or amplitude. It is rarely used on the Amiga due to both frequency and volume being controllable in better ways, but could be used to achieve different kinds of tremolo and vibrato, and even rudimentary FM synthesis effects.

Audio may be output using two methods. Most often, DMA-driven audio is used. As explained in the discussion of Agnus, memory access is prioritized and one DMA slot per scan line is available for each of the four sound channels. On a regular NTSC or PAL display, DMA audio playback is limited to a maximum output rate of 28,867 values per channel (PAL: 28837) per second totaling 57674 (PAL: 57734) values per second on each stereo output. This rate can be increased with the ECS and AGA chipsets by using a video mode with higher horizontal scan rate.

Alternately, Paula may signal the CPU to load a new sample into any of the four audio output buffers by generating an interrupt when a new sample is needed. This allows for output rates that exceed 57 kHz per channel and increases the number of possible voices (simultaneous sounds) through software mixing.

The Amiga contains an analog low-pass filter (reconstruction filter) which is external to Paula. The filter is a 12 dB/oct Butterworth low-pass filter at approximately 3.3 kHz. The filter can only be applied globally to all four channels. In models after the Amiga 1000 (excluding the very first revision of the Amiga 500), the brightness of the power LED is used to indicate the status of the filter. The filter is active when the LED is at normal brightness, and deactivated when dimmed (on early Amiga 500 models the LED went completely off). Models released before Amiga 1200 also have a static &quot;tone knob&quot; type low-pass filter that is enabled regardless of the optional &quot;LED filter&quot;. This filter is a 6 dB/oct low-pass filter with cutoff frequency at 4.5 or 5 kHz.

A software technique was later developed which can play back 14-bit audio by combining two channels set at different volumes. This results in two 14-bit channels instead of four 8-bit channels. This is achieved by playing the high byte of a 16-bit sample at maximum volume, and the low byte at minimum volume (both ranges overlap, so the low byte needs to be shifted right two bits). The bit shift operation requires a small amount of CPU or blitter overhead, whereas conventional 8-bit playback is almost entirely DMA driven. This technique was incorporated into the retargetable audio subsystem AHI, allowing compatible applications to use this mode transparently.

===Floppy disk controller===
The floppy controller is unusually flexible. It can read and write raw bit sequences directly from and to the disk via DMA or programmed I/O at 500 (double density) or 250 kbit/s (single density or GCR). MFM or GCR were the two most commonly used formats though in theory any run-length limited code could be used. It also provides a number of convenient features, such as sync-on-word (in MFM coding, $4489 is usually used as the sync word). MFM encoding/decoding is usually done with the blitter — one pass for decode, three passes for encode. Normally the entire track is read or written in one shot, rather than sector-by-sector; this made it possible to get rid of most of the inter-sector gaps that most floppy disk formats need to safely prevent the &quot;bleeding&quot; of a written sector into the previously-existing header of the next sector due to speed variations of the drive. If all sectors and their headers are always written in one go, such bleeding is only an issue at the end of the track (which still must not bleed back into its beginning), so that only one gap per track is needed. This way, for the native Amiga disk format, the raw storage capacity of 3.5 inch DD disks was increased from the typical 720 KB to 880 KB, although the less-than-ideal file system of the earlier Amiga models reduced this again to approximately 830 KB of actual payload data.

In addition to the native 880 KB 3.5-inch disk format, the controller can handle many foreign formats, such as:

* IBM PC
* Apple II
* Mac 800 KB (requires a Mac drive)
* AMAX Mac emulator (a special floppy of only 200 KB to exchange data between Amiga and Macintosh could be formatted by the Amiga, and it could be read and written by floppy drives of both systems)
* Commodore 1541 (requires 5¼-inch drive slowed to 280 rpm)
* Commodore 1581 formatted -floppy for C64 and C128

The Amiga 3000 introduced a special, dual-speed floppy drive that also allowed use of high density disks with double capacity without any change to Paula&#x27;s floppy controller.

===Serial port===
The serial port is rudimentary, using programmed input/output only and lacking a FIFO buffer. However, virtually any bit rate can be selected, including all standard rates, MIDI rate, as well as extremely high custom rates.

==Origin of the chip names==
* The name Agnus is derived from &#x27;Address GeNerator UnitS&#x27; since it houses all address registers and controls memory access of the custom chips.
* Denise is a contrived contraction of Display ENabler, intended to continue the naming convention.
* Paula is a similarly contrived contraction of Ports, Audio, UART and Logic, and coincidentally the chip designer&#x27;s girlfriend.

<doc id="22786" wikidata="Q972514" url="?curid=22786" title="Optic neuritis">
<text>Optic neuritis describes any condition that causes inflammation of the optic nerve; it may be associated with demyelinating diseases, or infectious or inflammatory processes.

It is also known as optic papillitis (when the head of the optic nerve is involved), neuroretinitis (when there is a combined involvement of the optic disc and surrounding retina in the macular area) and retrobulbar neuritis (when the posterior part of the nerve is involved). Prelaminar optic neuritis describes involvement of the non-myelinated axons in the retina.

== Classification, diagnosis and symptoms ==
===Classification and diagnosis===
The World Health Organization&#x27;s ICD-11 classification includes optic neuritis. However a 2022 review found that there is no consensus regarding the classification of optic neuritis, and precise diagnostic criteria are not available.

===Symptoms===
Major symptoms are 
*sudden loss of vision (partial or complete), 
*sudden blurred or &quot;foggy&quot; vision, and 
*pain on movement of the affected eye.

Many patients with optic neuritis may lose some of their color vision in the affected eye (especially red), with colors appearing subtly washed out compared to the other eye. Patients may also experience difficulties judging movement in depth, which can be particular troublesome during driving or sport (Pulfrich effect). Likewise, transient worsening of vision with increase of body temperature (Uhthoff&#x27;s phenomenon) and glare disability are a frequent complaint. 

However not everyone who has optic neuritis has problems with their vision.

====Early symptoms====
Early symptoms that require investigation include symptoms from multiple sclerosis (twitching, lack of coordination, slurred speech, frequent episodes of partial vision loss or blurred vision), episodes of &quot;disturbed/blackened&quot; rather than blurry indicate moderate stage and require immediate medical attention to prevent further loss of vision. Other early symptoms are reduced night vision, photophobia and red eyes. 

====Variation in symptoms with age====
Several case studies in children have demonstrated the absence of pain in more than half of cases (approximately 60%) in their pediatric study population, with the most common symptom reported simply as &quot;blurriness&quot;. Other remarkable differences between the presentation of adult optic neuritis as compared to pediatric cases include more often unilateral optic neuritis in adults, while children much predominantly present with bilateral involvement.

===Observation===
On medical examination the head of the optic nerve can easily be visualized by a slit lamp with a high positive lens or by using direct ophthalmoscopy; however, frequently there is no abnormal appearance of the nerve head in optic neuritis (in cases of retrobulbar optic neuritis), though it may be swollen in some patients (anterior papillitis or more extensive optic neuritis). In many cases, only one eye is affected, and patients may not be aware of the loss of color vision until they are asked to close or cover the healthy eye.

===Imaging===
Imaging of the optic nerve with MRI shows increased signal on the affected side. There is contrast enhancement of the symptomatic optic nerve and sheaths acutely or intrinsic signal increase (looking brighter) within ≥ 3 months. 
Advanced imaging using optical coherence tomography (OCT) is very sensitive reveal damage to the optic nerve. The OCT shows corresponding optic disc swelling acutely or an inter-eye difference in the thickness of the neurons and their nerves connecting the eye with the brain in above 4-5% within ≥ 3 months after onset.

====Asymmetry in thickness of RNFL====
Asymmetry between the eyes in thickness of RNFL has been proposed as a strong indicator of optic neuritis.

== Cause ==
The optic nerve comprises axons that emerge from the retina of the eye and carry visual information to the primary visual nuclei, most of which is relayed to the occipital cortex of the brain to be processed into vision. Inflammation of the optic nerve causes loss of vision, usually because of the swelling and destruction of the myelin sheath covering the optic nerve.

A 2019 review divided optic neuritis into 
*Typical optic neuritis - an idiopathic demyelinating condition that is often associated with multiple sclerosis.
*Atypical optic neuritis - resulting from an inflammatory, infectious, or autoimmune disorder. 

The most common cause is multiple sclerosis (MS) or ischemic optic neuropathy due to thrombosis or embolism of the vessel that supplies the optic nerve. Up to 50% of patients with MS will develop an episode of optic neuritis, and 20–30% of the time optic neuritis is the presenting sign of MS. The presence of demyelinating white matter lesions on brain MRI at the time of presentation of optic neuritis is the strongest predictor for developing clinically definite MS. Almost half of the patients with optic neuritis have white matter lesions consistent with multiple sclerosis.

Some other common causes of optic neuritis include infection (e.g. a tooth abscess in the upper jaw, syphilis, Lyme disease, herpes zoster), autoimmune disorders (e.g. lupus, neurosarcoidosis, neuromyelitis optica), methanol poisoning, vitamin B12 deficiency, beriberi, dysautonomia (i.e. autonomic nervous system dysfunction), and diabetes, or an injury to the eye. In neuromyelitis optica higher AQP4 autoantibody levels are associated with the occurrence of optic neuritis.

Less common causes are: papilledema, brain tumor or abscess in the occipital region, cerebral trauma or hemorrhage, meningitis, arachnoidal adhesions, sinus thrombosis, liver dysfunction, or late stage kidney disease.


Other diseases associated with optic neuritis include:
* Parainfectious optic neuritis (associated with viral infections such as measles, mumps, chickenpox, whooping cough and glandular fever)
* Infectious optic neuritis (sinus related or associated with cat-scratch fever, tuberculosis, Lyme disease and cryptococcal meningitis in AIDS patients
* Autoimmune causes (sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, polyarteritis nodosa, MOG antibody disease, granulomatosis with polyangiitis)
* Low phosphorus levels
* Hyperkalaemia

=== Demyelinating recurrent optic neuritis and non-demyelinating (CRION) ===

The repetition of an idiopathic optic neuritis is considered a distinct clinical condition, and when it shows demyelination, it has been found to be associated to anti-MOG and AQP4-negative neuromyelitis optica.

When an inflammatory recurrent optic neuritis is not demyelinating, it is called chronic relapsing inflammatory optic neuropathy (CRION).

When it is anti-MOG related, it is demyelinating and it is considered inside the anti-MOG associated inflammatory demyelinating diseases.

Some reports point to the possibility to establish a difference via optical coherence tomography.

== Outlook and Treatment ==

Many patients see full recovery but some see some lasting effects.

=== Steroids ===
High dose steroids may be given intravenously or orally.

In most MS-associated optic neuritis, visual function spontaneously improves over 2–3 months, and there is evidence that corticosteroid treatment does not affect the long term outcome. However, for optic neuritis that is not MS-associated (or atypical optic neuritis) the evidence is less clear and therefore the threshold for treatment with intravenous corticosteroids is lower. Intravenous corticosteroids also reduce the risk of developing MS in the following two years in patients with MRI lesions; but this effect disappears by the third year of follow up.

Paradoxically, oral administration of corticosteroids in this situation may lead to more recurrent attacks than in non-treated patients (though oral steroids are generally prescribed after the intravenous course, to wean the patient off the medication). This effect of corticosteroids seems to be limited to optic neuritis and has not been observed in other diseases treated with corticosteroids.

A Cochrane systematic review studied the effect of corticosteroids for treating people with acute optic neuritis. Specific corticosteroids studied included intravenous and oral methylprednisone, and oral prednisone. The authors conclude that current evidence does not show a benefit of either intravenous or oral corticosteroids for rate of recovery of vision (in terms of visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, or visual fields). There are a number of reasons why this might be the case.

=== Immunosuppressants ===
Immunosuppressants may also be used in treatment.

=== Pain relief ===

== Epidemiology ==
Optic neuritis typically affects young adults ranging 18–45 years of age, with a mean age of 30–35 years. There is a strong female predominance. The annual incidence is approximately 5/100,000, with a prevalence estimated to be 115/100,000 (0.12%).

== Society and culture ==
In Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;Bleak House&quot;, the main character, Esther Summerville, has a transient episode of visual loss, the symptoms of which are also seen in people who have optic neuritis. Legal historian William Searle Holdsworth suggested that the events in &quot;Bleak House&quot; took place in 1827.

In an episode of &quot;Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman&quot; (&quot;Season of Miracles&quot;, season five), Reverend Timothy Johnson is struck blind by optic neuritis on Christmas Day 1872. He remains blind for the duration of the series.

<text>The Organization of American States (OAS or OEA; ; ; ) is an international organization founded on 30 April 1948 to promote cooperation among its member states within the Americas. 

Headquartered in Washington, D.C., United States, the OAS is a &quot;multilateral regional body focused on human rights, electoral oversight, social and economic development, and security in the Western Hemisphere&quot;, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. As of November 2023, 32 states in the Americas are OAS members. 

Luis Almagro of Uruguay was inaugurated as OAS secretary general in 2015.
His term ends in May 2025 and an election is to be held on 10 March to choose his successor.

== History ==

===19th century===
The notion of an international union in the American continent was first put forward during the liberation of America by José de San Martín and Simón Bolívar who, at the 1826 Congress of Panama, still being part of Colombia, proposed creating a league of American republics, with a common military, a mutual defense pact, and a supranational parliamentary assembly. The meeting was attended by representatives of Gran Colombia, comprising the present-day countries of Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, and Venezuela, Argentina, Peru, Bolivia, the United Provinces of Central America, and Mexico but the grandly titled &quot;Treaty of Union, League, and Perpetual Confederation&quot; was ultimately ratified only by Gran Colombia. Bolívar&#x27;s dream soon floundered with civil war in Gran Colombia, the disintegration of Central America, and the emergence of national rather than New World outlooks in the newly independent American republics. Bolívar&#x27;s dream of inter-American unity was meant to unify Hispanic American nations against external powers.

The pursuit of regional solidarity and cooperation again came to the forefront in 1889–1890, at the First International Conference of American States. Gathered together in Washington, D.C., 18 nations resolved to found the International Union of American Republics, served by a permanent secretariat called the Commercial Bureau of the American Republics (renamed the International Commercial Bureau at the Second International Conference in 1901–1902). These two bodies, in existence as of 14 April 1890, represent the point of inception to which the OAS and its General Secretariat trace their origins.

===20th century===

At the fourth International Conference of American States (Buenos Aires, 1910), the name of the organization was changed to the Union of American Republics and the Bureau became the Pan American Union. The Pan American Union Building was constructed in 1910, on Constitution Avenue, Northwest, Washington, D.C.

In the mid-1930s, U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt organized an inter-American conference in Buenos Aires. One of the items at the conference was a &quot;League of Nations of the Americas&quot;, an idea proposed by Colombia, Guatemala, and the Dominican Republic. At the subsequent Inter-American Conference for the Maintenance of Peace, 21 nations pledged to remain neutral in the event of a conflict between any two members. The experience of World War II convinced hemispheric governments that unilateral action could not ensure the territorial integrity of the American nations in the event of external aggression. To meet the challenges of global conflict in the postwar world and to contain conflicts within the hemisphere, they adopted a system of collective security, the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance (Rio Treaty) signed in 1947 in Rio de Janeiro.

The ninth International Conference of American States was held in Bogotá between March and May 1948 and led by United States Secretary of State George Marshall, a meeting which led to a pledge by members to fight communism in the western hemisphere. This was the event that saw the birth of the OAS as it stands today, with the signature by 21 American countries of the Charter of the Organization of American States on 30 April 1948 (in effect since December 1951). The meeting also adopted the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man, the world&#x27;s first general human rights instrument.

The transition from the Pan American Union to OAS would have been smooth if it had not been for the assassination of Colombian leader Jorge Eliécer Gaitán. The Director General of the Pan American Union, Alberto Lleras Camargo, became the Organization&#x27;s first Secretary General. 

===21st century===

The OAS conducted an audit of the 2019 Bolivian general election, which opposition supporters argued was fraudulent. The OAS report contended that the results were marred by &quot;clear manipulation&quot; and significant irregularities leading to the 2019 Bolivian political crisis. Bolivian president Evo Morales resigned soon after, having lost the confidence of the country&#x27;s military in what he described as a coup. Some media outlets debated whether it should be referred to as a coup. On 21 December, the Technical Mission of Electoral Experts sent by the European Union published a 67-page report which made similar observations and conclusions to that of the OAS. They noted that &quot;there were minutes with an unusually high number of null votes, blank votes and a hundred percent participation of voters in a series of polling stations&quot; and highlighted the general failure of the TSE to declare these irregularities. Studies commissioned by the American left-leaning think tank CEPR argued that the OAS report&#x27;s statistical analysis was inaccurate and unreliable. The author of the OAS&#x27;s vote return analysis stated that the CEPR&#x27;s explanation of the results was implausible. The organization has been criticized by Mexico and the CEPR for their perception of interference into the internal affairs of Bolivia. The OAS observed the subsequent 2020 Bolivian general election stating there was no evidence of fraud. &quot;The New York Times&quot; concluded that there was some fraud, but that it was unclear how much or if it was sufficient to change the result of the election, and suggested the initial analysis by the OAS was flawed.

In November 2021, OAS condemned the outcome of the Nicaraguan general election. In April 2022, Nicaragua reported the completion of its withdrawal process from the OAS initiated in November 2021. The OAS stated that, due to the terms of treaty, the withdrawal would not take effect until 2023. The move was completed on 19 November that year.

== Goals and purpose ==
In the words of Article 1 of the Charter, the goal of the member nations in creating the OAS was &quot;to achieve an order of peace and justice, to promote their solidarity, to strengthen their collaboration, and to defend their sovereignty, their territorial integrity, and their independence.&quot; Article 2 then defines eight essential purposes:
*To strengthen the peace and security of the continent.
*To promote and consolidate representative democracy, with due respect for the principle of non-intervention.
*To prevent possible causes of difficulties and to ensure the pacific settlement of disputes that may arise among the member states.
*To provide for common action on the part of those states in the event of aggression.
*To seek the solution of political, judicial, and economic problems that may arise among them.
*To promote, by cooperative action, their economic, social, and cultural development.
*To eradicate extreme poverty, which constitutes an obstacle to the full democratic development of the peoples of the hemisphere.
*To achieve an effective limitation of conventional weapons that will make it possible to devote the largest amount of resources to the economic and social development of the member states.

Over the course of the 1990s, with the end of the Cold War, the return to democracy in Latin America, and the thrust toward globalization, the OAS made major efforts to reinvent itself to fit the new context. Its stated priorities now include the following:

*Strengthening democracy: Between 1962 and 2002, the Organization sent multinational observation missions to oversee free and fair elections in the member states on more than 100 occasions. The OAS also works to strengthen national and local government and electoral agencies, to promote democratic practices and values, and to help countries detect and defuse official corruption.
*Working for peace: Special OAS missions have supported peace processes in Nicaragua, Suriname, Haiti, and Guatemala. The Organization has played a leading part in the removal of landmines deployed in member states and it has led negotiations to resolve the continents&#x27; remaining border disputes (Guatemala/Belize; Peru/Ecuador). Work is also underway on the construction of a common inter-American counter-terrorism front.
*Defending human rights: The agencies of the inter-American human rights system provide a venue for the denunciation and resolution of human rights violations in individual cases. They also monitor and report on the general human rights situation in the member states.
*Fostering free trade: The OAS is one of the three agencies currently engaged in drafting a treaty aiming to establish an inter-continental free trade area from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego.
*Fighting the drugs trade: The Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission was established in 1986 to coordinate efforts and cross-border cooperation in this area.
*Promoting sustainable development: The goal of the OAS&#x27;s Inter-American Council for Integral Development is to promote economic development and combating poverty. OAS technical cooperation programs address such areas as river basin management, the conservation of biodiversity, preservation of cultural diversity, planning for global climate change, sustainable tourism, and natural disaster mitigation.

== Organizational structure ==

The Organization of American States is composed of a General Secretariat, the Permanent Council, the Inter-American Council for Integral Development, and a number of committees.

The General Secretariat of the Organization of American States consists of six secretariats.
*Secretariat for Political Affairs
*Executive Secretariat for Integral Development
*Secretariat for Multidimensional Security
*Secretariat for Administration and Finance
*Secretariat for Legal Affairs
*Secretariat for External Relations

The various committees of the Organization of American States include:
* The Committee on Juridical and Political Affairs
* The Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Affairs
* The Committee on Hemispheric Security
* The Committee on Inter-American Summits Management and Civil Society Participation in OAS Activities

The various commissions of the Organization of American States include: 
* Inter-American Commission of Women (CIM)
* Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (CIDH)
* Inter-American Telecommunication Commission (CITEL)

=== General Assembly ===
The General Assembly is the supreme decision-making body of OAS. It convenes once every year in a regular session. In special circumstances, and with the approval of two-thirds of the member states, the Permanent Council can convene special sessions.

The Organization&#x27;s member states take turns hosting the General Assembly on a rotating basis. The states are represented at its sessions by their chosen delegates: generally, their ministers of foreign affairs, or their appointed deputies. Each state has one vote, and most matters are settled by a majority vote, except for those for which the Charter or the General Assembly&#x27;s own rules of procedure specifically require a two-thirds majority.

The General Assembly&#x27;s powers include setting the OAS&#x27;s general course and policies by means of resolutions and declarations; approving its budget and determining the contributions payable by the member states; approving the reports and previous year&#x27;s actions of the OAS&#x27;s specialized agencies; and electing members to serve on those agencies.

=== Specialized agencies ===
The OAS has five specialized agencies:
*Pan American Health Organization (PAHO)
* (IIN)
*Inter-American Commission of Women (CIM)
*Pan-American Institute of Geography and History (PAIGH)
* (IICA)

=== Official languages ===

The Organization&#x27;s official languages are Spanish, Portuguese, French, and English. The Charter, the basic instrument governing OAS, makes no reference to the use of official languages. These references are to be found in the Rules of Procedure governing the various OAS bodies. Article 51 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Assembly, the supreme body of the OAS, which meets once a year, states that English, French, Portuguese, and Spanish are the four official languages. Article 28 stipulates that a Style Committee shall be set up with representatives of the four official languages to review the General Assembly resolutions and declarations. Article 53 states that proposals shall be presented in the four official languages. The Rules of Procedure and Statutes of other bodies, such as the Inter-American Council for Integral Development (CIDI), the Permanent Executive Committee of the Inter-American Council for Integral Development (CEPCIDI), the Inter-American Commission of Women (CIM), the Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission (CICAD), the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) and the Inter-American Juridical Committee (CJI), technical bodies of the OAS, also mention the four official languages in which their meetings are to be conducted. Policy is therefore dictated through these instruments that require use of the four official languages at meetings.

Although a number of other languages have official status in one or more member states of OAS (Dutch in Suriname; Haitian Creole alongside French in Haiti; Quechua and Aymara in Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia; Guaraní in Paraguay), they are not official languages of the Organization.

=== Funding ===
The OAS has two funds, one for the General Secretariat, and one for specific programs and initiatives. The General Assembly asks for contributions from each member country based on its capacity to pay. In 2018 the General Secretariat&#x27;s budget was $85 million of which the US contributed $50 million. In 2017 the US contributed $17 million to the fund for specific programs which was almost a third of the total contributions for that year.

==== OAS Office of the Inspector General audits ====
The OAS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) conducts forensic internal performance audits, to assess the General Secretariat in achieving the objectives recommended in administration and operations of the OAS and its safeguarding of resources used to undertake programs across Latin America and the Caribbean. The OIG&#x27;s internal audit reports are presented to the OAS Audit Committee, and the Secretary General as well as member states of the OAS upon request. The OIG maintains whistleblower provisions to report irregular activity to the OIG for review.

==== Financial audits ====
Under General Assembly Resolution 123, adopted on April 14, 1973 Financial audits of the accounts of the OAS are published annually. The annual reports are presented to the General Secretariat by The Audit Committee (formerly The OAS Board of External Auditors.) The Committee members are composed of three members elected by the OAS&#x27;s General Assembly.

=== Canada and the OAS ===
Although admission into OAS&#x27;s predecessor, the Pan American Union, was initially restricted to republics, several overtures were still made for Canada to join the organization in 1928, 1933, 1936, and 1938. During the 1936 Pan American Union Conference, the organization extended its membership from only &quot;American republics&quot; to &quot;American states&quot; to accommodate Canada&#x27;s admission as a constitutional monarchy. However, U.S. opposition to Canadian membership prevented their admittance, with the U.S. fearing the admittance of Canada to the OAS would bring with it British influence that could impede its freedom of action within the organization. The U.S. reversed its position on Canadian membership in 1947. However, by that time, Canadian foreign policy had adopted an Atlanticist position with a European focus; resulting in the Canadian government seeing little value in pursuing OAS membership. 

From the 1960s to the 1980s, the Canadian government expressed some interest in joining the OAS, having successfully applied for permanent observer status in 1972 to evaluate potential membership. In the 1980s, the Canadian government incrementally increased its participation in OAS activities. Canada signed the Charter of the Organization of American States in 1989. Canada&#x27;s membership in the OAS was formalized when the decision was ratified in 1990.

=== Sanctions against the Dominican Republic during Trujillo regime===

During the 6th Conference of Foreign Ministers of the Organization of American States (OAS) in Costa Rica, from 16 to 20 August 1960, a conviction against the State of the Dominican Republic was agreed to unanimously. The penalty was motivated because the foreign ministers checked the veracity of the claim that the Rafael Trujillo regime had sponsored an attack against Rómulo Betancourt, at that time the constitutional president of Venezuela. The meeting was attended by foreign ministers from 21 American nations, including Cuba, which at that time had not yet been expelled from the inter-American system.

All countries, including the United States and Haiti, broke off diplomatic relations with the Dominican Republic. Additionally an economic blockade that affected the exports of sugar was applied, which at that time was the pillar of the Dominican economy.

It was the first application of the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance, which had been adopted at the OAS on 29 July 1960.

=== Permanent observers ===
As of 31 January 2014, there are 69 permanent observer countries including the four countries with territory or territories in the Americas—Denmark, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom; as well as the European Union and India.

In March 2022, the OAS voted to suspend Russia as a permanent observer due to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

== Suspensions, withdrawals and termination ==
=== Cuba ===
The current government of Cuba was excluded from participation in the Organization under a decision adopted by the Eighth Meeting of Consultation in Punta del Este, Uruguay, on 31 January 1962. The vote was passed by 14 in favor, with one against (Cuba) and six abstentions (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, and Mexico). The operative part of the resolution reads as follows:

This meant that the Cuban nation was still technically a member state, but that the current government was denied the right of representation and attendance at meetings and of participation in activities. The OAS&#x27;s position was that although Cuba&#x27;s participation was suspended, its obligations under the Charter, the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man, etc. still hold: for instance, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights continues to publish reports on Cuba&#x27;s human rights situation and to hear individual cases involving Cuban nationals. However, this stance was occasionally questioned by other individual member states.

The resolution to exclude Cuba was controversial when it was adopted, and the reintegration of Cuba into the Inter-American system has remained a frequent source of contention among the countries of the hemisphere ever since. Cuba&#x27;s position was stated in an official note sent to the Organization &quot;merely as a courtesy&quot; by Minister of Foreign Affairs Raúl Roa on 4 November 1964: &quot;Cuba was arbitrarily excluded ... The Organization of American States has no juridical, factual, or moral jurisdiction, nor competence, over a state which it has illegally deprived of its rights.&quot; The reincorporation of Cuba as an active member regularly arose as a topic within the inter-American system for instance, it was intimated by the outgoing ambassador of Mexico in 1998but most observers did not see it as a serious possibility while the present government remained in power. Since 1960, the Cuban administration had repeatedly characterized the OAS as the &quot;Ministry of Colonies&quot; of the United States of America. Fidel Castro and his brother Raúl attacked the OAS as a &quot;Yankee bordello&quot; and &quot;instrument of imperialist domination&quot; and vowed that Cuba would never join, although OAS rescinded the nation&#x27;s expulsion in 2009 and invited it to apply for readmission. Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez promised to veto any final declaration of the 2009 Summit of the Americas due to Cuba&#x27;s exclusion.

On 17 April 2009, after a &quot;trading of warm words&quot; between the administrations of U.S. President Barack Obama and Cuban leader Raúl Castro, OAS Secretary General José Miguel Insulza said he would ask the 2009 General Assembly to annul the 1962 resolution excluding Cuba.

On 3 June 2009, foreign ministers assembled in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, for the OAS&#x27;s 39th General Assembly, passed a vote to lift Cuba&#x27;s suspension from the OAS. The United States had been pressuring the OAS for weeks to condition Cuba&#x27;s readmission to the group on democratic principles and commitment to human rights. Ecuador&#x27;s Foreign Minister Fander Falconí said there will be no such conditions. &quot;This is a new proposal, it has no conditions—of any kind,&quot; Falconí said. &quot;That suspension was made in the Cold War, in the language of the Cold War. What we have done here is fix a historic error.&quot; The suspension was lifted at the end of the General Assembly, but, to be readmitted to the Organization, Cuba will need to comply with all the treaties signed by the Member States, including the Inter-American Democratic Charter of 2001. A statement issued by the Cuban government on 8 June 2009 stated that while Cuba welcomed the Assembly&#x27;s gesture, in light of the Organization&#x27;s historical record &quot;Cuba will not return to the OAS.&quot;

=== Suspension of Honduras (2009–2011) ===

Following the expulsion of its President Manuel Zelaya, Honduras&#x27; membership of the Organization was suspended unanimously at midnight on 5 July 2009. The &quot;de facto&quot; government had already announced it was leaving the OAS hours earlier; this was not, however, taken into account by the OAS, which did not recognize that government as legitimate. An extraordinary meeting had been conducted by the OAS in Washington, D.C., with Zelaya in attendance. The suspension of Honduras was approved unanimously with 33 votes (Honduras did not vote). This was the first suspension carried out by the OAS since that of Cuba in 1962.

After Zelaya&#x27;s return to Honduras in 2011, the country was re-admitted to the Organization on 1 June 2011 with 32 votes in favor and 1 (Ecuador) against. Venezuela expressed some reservations.

=== Nicaragua ===
On 7 November 2021, Nicaragua held a general election which saw President Daniel Ortega re-elected to a fourth term in office. In a vote by the OAS Permanent Council, 25 member states voted in favour of a resolution condemning the election. Seven countries, including Mexico, Honduras and Bolivia, abstained. The motion stated that the election was &quot;not free, fair or transparent and lack[s] democratic legitimacy&quot; and also instructed the Permanent Council to undertake an assessment of the situation and &quot;take appropriate action&quot;.

In response to this statement, Nicaraguan Foreign Minister announced on 19 November that Nicaragua would leave the OAS. Moncada called the bloc &quot;an instrument of interference and intervention&quot; and accused it of &quot;facilitating the hegemony of the United States with its interventionism over the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean.&quot; According to Article 143 of the OAS Charter, the process to withdraw from the organization takes two years after its announcement.

In April 2022, Nicaragua announced that it had completed its withdrawal from the OAS. It said the OAS offices in Managua had been closed. The OAS stated that, due to the terms of treaty, the withdrawal would not take effect until 2023. Nicaragua eventually completed its withdrawal from the OAS on 19 November that year.

=== Venezuela ===
On 28 April 2017, Venezuela notified the OAS of its denunciation of the Charter of the OAS, which as per Article 143 would lead to the withdrawal of Venezuela from the OAS effective two years from the date of notification. During this period, the country did not plan on participating in the OAS.

During the 2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis, the President of the National Assembly of Venezuela Juan Guaidó, who was recognized by the National Assembly as the acting president, sent a letter to the OAS Secretary General annulling the previous denunciation of the OAS Charter, and expressing his desire for Venezuela to remain a member of the OAS. The National Assembly designated a special envoy as representative to the OAS, lawyer Gustavo Tarre Briceño, who the OAS voted to recognize as Venezuela&#x27;s delegate in April. In October 2022, a bloc of leftist OAS member states led a motion to remove Tarre&#x27;s representation in the organization. Out of 35 members, 19 nations voted in favor of the motion and 4 against. The motion fell short of the 24 votes required for a two-thirds majority.

<text>The World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH), formerly the  (OIE), is an intergovernmental organisation founded in 1924, coordinating, supporting and promoting animal disease control. The primary objective of WOAH is to control epizootic diseases and prevent their spread. Further objectives include the sharing of transparent, scientific information; international solidarity; sanitary safety; and the promotion of veterinary services‚ food safety and animal welfare.

WOAH is recognised by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) as an international reference for the safe trade of animals and animal products regarding risks due to animal diseases and zoonoses.

WOAH is not a part of the United Nations (UN) system. Its autonomy is institutional and financial, and its own constitutional texts govern its activities. Since its first General Session held in Paris, the Organisation has carried out its work under the authority of a committee consisting of delegates of the contracting governments. The Organisation maintains permanent relations with over 70 partner organisations and has regional and sub-regional offices on every continent.

During its 91st General Session, the World Assembly of Delegates elected Dr Emmanuelle Soubeyran as Director General for a five-year mandate (2024–2029).

== History ==
=== Origin and founding===

1920s: Establishment and early years

The Organisation&#x27;s creation dates to the early 20th century, making it one of the oldest existing Intergovernmental Organisations. The Office International des Epizooties (OIE) was created through an International Agreement signed on 25 January 1924. Earlier, in May 1921, a rinderpest pandemic motivated Delegates at the International Conference for the Study of Epizootics, with diplomats from 43 countries, to express a call for the establishment of an international organisation to coordinate responses against infectious animal diseases at a global level.

The need to fight animal diseases at a global level led to the creation of the through the international agreement signed in January 1924.

1940s: Second World War and compatibility with newly founded agencies

The OIE had established its new headquarters by the end of the 1930s, but activities were slowed down by the eruption of the Second World War and the subsequent occupation of Paris by the Nazis in 1940. After the war, the existence of the OIE was initially challenged by the creation by the United Nations of the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) in 1946, and the World Health Organisation (WHO) in 1948, as both specialist agencies which partially cover the aims of the OIE. However, the opposition of numerous OIE Members and Delegates when the issue was raised in 1946 and 1951, kept the functions of the Organisation alive.

1950s to 1960s: Animal health legislation in the EU and Official agreements

By 1960, the OIE had signed an official agreement with FAO in 1952 and had lent its support to the first attempts to harmonise animal health legislation within the European Community after the signing of the Treaty of Rome in 1957. In 1960, an official agreement was signed between the OIE and WHO.

1990s: Recognition as an international standard-setting organisation

The 1990s witnessed the signing of various agreements with the OIE and organisations worldwide. In 1998, the OIE accepted a formal cooperation with the World Trade Organisation. The Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures, also known as the SPS Agreement, clearly defined the OIE as the reference organisation for animal health and zoonoses whereby Members are required to base sanitary or phytosanitary measures on international standards, guidelines, and recommendations. 
After this, governments began to understand the importance of the Organisation. Between 1990 and 1999, 41 countries became Members. Set up between 1991 and 1999, the Regional Representations, for Asia and the Pacific (1971, then 1991), Eastern Europe (1994), the Americas (1997), and, lastly, the Middle East (1999) and Africa (1999) have allowed the Organisation to keep abreast of the challenges of its Members.

2000 to 2009: The World Organisation for Animal Health and further strategic agreements

In May 2003, the Office became the &quot;World Organisation for Animal Health&quot;, however, it kept its historical acronym OIE, which was in use until May 2022.

During this decade the OIE reached agreements with organisations and agencies, alongside a new agreement with WHO in 2002, including The World Bank, and World Veterinary Association amongst others.

2010-2020: Rinderpest eradication and increased collaboration with partners

In 2011, the national Delegates of OIE Members unanimously adopted a resolution that officially recognized, following thorough control by the OIE with the support of FAO, that all 198 countries and territories with rinderpest-susceptible animals are free of the disease.

Having celebrated the 85th anniversary of its creation the year before, the OIE adopted its 5th Strategic Plan, which set a roadmap for its global missions in animal health and welfare from 2011 to 2015. The plan sought to continue the key priorities set in previous plans with an enhanced focus on more activities directed to food security, poverty alleviation and animal health, and veterinary public health. Furthermore, the Organisation set a focus on the “One Health” concept, in cooperation with partner organisations.

In January 2017, the outgoing Obama administration designated the OIE as an organisation entitled to benefits of the International Organizations Immunities Act.

In March 2022, The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH), the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), and the World Health Organization (WHO), signed a groundbreaking agreement to strengthen cooperation in the era of One Health, to sustainably balance and optimize the health of humans, animals, plants and the environment.

2022: The World Organisation for Animal Health – WOAH

In May 2022, the Organisation stopped using the historical acronym &quot;OIE&quot;, and started to use the new acronym &quot;WOAH&quot;.

2024: The Organisation commemorates its 100th anniversary, a significant milestone marking the Organisation&#x27;s continued commitment to the health and well-being of animals worldwide.

== Current policies and objectives ==

=== Overall focus ===

WOAH works to improve animal health and welfare worldwide. They do this in several ways. The Organisation monitors the emergence of animal diseases in terrestrial and aquatic animals, either domestic or wild, so they can act before the situation imperils animal health and welfare, public health, or livelihoods. By collecting, analysing, and disseminating veterinary scientific information, through standards, global initiatives, and publications, WOAH collaborates with a wide network of people and has a thorough knowledge base and pool of informative resources. The Organisation also ensures that its Members have the tools and capacity to equip their Veterinary Services and respond to the threats of animal diseases.

Ensure transparency in the global animal disease situation

Another key objective for WOAH is the provision of increased transparency, well-structured policies, increased resources to support Members, strengthened partnerships, and the notification and monitoring of global diseases and shared information via the Organisation&#x27;s health information system, WAHIS.

Disseminate comprehensive information on animal disease events

Timely dissemination of information is crucial to containing outbreaks. The World Animal Health Information Database Interface provides access to all data held within WOAH&#x27;s World Animal Health Information System (WAHIS). This interface provides access to immediate notifications on animal disease events, allowing the Organisation&#x27;s Members to share follow-up reports in response to exceptional disease events in their countries or territories.

== Organisational structure ==
WOAH functions under the authority of a World Assembly of Delegates designated by the Governments of Members. The Organisation is placed under the responsibility of a Director General elected by the World Assembly of Delegates. The International Committee passes resolutions, developed with the support of Commissions elected by delegates, and implemented at WOAH&#x27;s headquarters.

=== Membership ===

As of May 2023, with the latest appointment of St Vincent and the Grenadines, WOAH counts 183 Members.

=== The World Assembly of Delegates ===
Composed of 183 Delegates, the World Assembly of Delegates is the highest authority of WOAH. Delegates belonging to all Members meet at least once a year at a General Session of the Assembly which lasts five days, held yearly in May in Paris. At the annual General Session, Delegates vote on important issues on animal diseases and animal health especially issues related to international trade.

=== Council ===

WOAH&#x27;s Council meets at least twice a year to examine technical and administrative issues, such as the working programme and budgets that will be presented to the Assembly. The Council comprises the President of the World Assembly of Delegates, the Vice President, the Past President, and six Delegates representing all the regions. The current President is Dr Susana Pombo from Portugal.

=== Director general ===

WOAH has had eight directors general since its creation.

== Headquarters ==

WOAH&#x27;s headquarters is based in Paris, in the 17th arrondissement. It was in 1939 that WOAH moved to the aristocratic district of Parc Monceau, after having occupied premises since 1927 near the Champs de Mars and the Eiffel Tower, that had been provided by the French Higher Public Health Council. In May 1938, the WOAH members gave Dr , the Organisation&#x27;s founder and first Director General, full powers to buy a townhouse in Paris, using the reserve fund. Lecleinche chose the mansion from four properties selected by a commission comprising the President of the WOAH, H.C.L.E. Berger (Netherlands), the vice-president, Carlo Bisanti (Italy), and the accountant, (Switzerland). On 22 February 1939, WOAH, represented by E. Leclainche, bought the mansion from the Marquise de Montebello.

The 13th General Session of WOAH was held from 30 May to 5 June 1939, at 12 rue de Prony after rebuilding work had been completed. Due to the Second World War, a General Session was not held until 1946, from 2 to 5 October. Following their entry into Paris in June 1940, the German occupying forces temporarily closed and sealed WOAH headquarters. The efforts of President Gottlieb Flückiger, elected in 1939, resulted in its re-opening.

12 rue de Prony was built in 1879, in Neo-Renaissance style, by the celebrated architect Jean-Louis Pascal for the Austrian baron Jonas von Königswater, a former banker and railway owner. A succession of major works to renovate and modernise the headquarters were undertaken by the directors general elected after Leclainche: Gaston Ramon, René Vittoz, Louis Blajan, Jean Blancou and . Due to the headlong development of the Organisation (tripling of the staff and the budget since 2001), additional premises have been rented at 14 rue de Prony since 2004. On 16 March 2009, WOAH purchased a large part of the 14 rue de Prony building, adjoining its headquarters.

=== Regional representations ===

WOAH also maintains representations in Africa, the Americas, Asia and the Pacific, Europe, and the Middle East. These representations provide services to WOAH Members to help strengthen surveillance and control of animal diseases in regions.

These representations can be found in the following destinations:

Africa

Americas

Asia and the Pacific 
Europe
Middle East
== Specialist commissions ==

WOAH&#x27;s Specialist Commissions collaborate with its global scientific network and are responsible for the official recognition of animal health status. They advise on epidemiology and the prevention and control of animal diseases.

The Organisation&#x27;s Specialist Commissions include: The Aquatic Animal Health Standards Commission, the Biological Standards Commission, the Scientific Commission for Animal Diseases and the Terrestrial Animal Health Standards Commission.

Created in 1960, the Aquatic Animal Health Standards Commission is responsible for overseeing the developments of the Aquatic Animal Health Code, ensuring that the aquatic codes reflect current scientific information. The commission is made up of internationally recognised specialists elected by the World Assembly of Delegates, these experts provide advice on the diagnosis, prevention, and control of aquatic diseases. In addition, they act as a focal point for the exchange of information regarding aquatic diseases.
Charged with the responsibility of approving methods of animal disease diagnosis, the Biological Standards Commission works to develop international standards for laboratory diagnostic tests and vaccines for WOAH-listed animal diseases of mammals, birds, and bees. The Scientific Commission, on the other hand, examines voluntary requests from the Organisation&#x27;s Members regarding disease-specific animal health status.

=== Regional commissions ===

WOAH has five Regional Commissions which serve to express concerns affecting its Members in different regions of the world. These Commissions are entrusted with studying programmes for the control of the main epizootic diseases and organise the coordination of Veterinary Services. WOAH&#x27;s Regional Commissions currently cover regions across Africa, the Americas, Asia, Far East and Oceania, Europe, and the Middle East. They include:

Africa
* Presidency Regional Commission for Africa, Kinshasa, Congo
* Vice Presidency Regional Commission for Africa, Dakar, Senegal
* Vice Presidency Regional Commission for Africa, Windhoek, Namibia
* Secretary General Regional Commission for Africa, Entebbe, Uganda

Americas
* Presidency Regional Commission for Americas, Managua, Nicaragua 
* Vice Presidency Regional Commission for Americas, Buenos Aires, Argentina
* Vice Presidency Regional Commission for Americas, Willemstad, Curaçao
* Secretary General Regional Commission for Americas, Richmond, United States of America

Asia and Pacific
* Presidency Regional Commission for Asia, Far East and Oceania, Qingdao, China 
* Vice Presidency Regional Commission for Asia, Far East and Oceania, Wellington, New Zealand 
* Vice Presidency Regional Commission for Asia, Far East and Oceania, Tokyo, Japan 
* Secretary General Regional Commission for Asia, Far East and Oceania, Nay Pyi Taw, Myanmar

Europe

<text>Osborne Earl Smith (born December 26, 1954) is an American former professional baseball player. Nicknamed &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, Smith played shortstop for the San Diego Padres and St. Louis Cardinals in Major League Baseball, winning the National League Gold Glove Award for defensive play at shortstop for 13 consecutive seasons. A 15-time All-Star, Smith accumulated 2,460 hits and 580 stolen bases during his career, and won the National League Silver Slugger Award as the best hitter at shortstop in 1987. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility in 2002. He was also elected to the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame in the inaugural class of 2014.

Smith was born in Mobile, Alabama; his family moved to Watts, Los Angeles, when he was six years old. While participating in childhood athletic activities, Smith possessed quick reflexes; he went on to play baseball at Locke High School in Los Angeles, then at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. Drafted as an amateur player by the Padres, Smith made his major league debut in 1978. He quickly established himself as an outstanding fielder, and later became known for performing backflips on special occasions while taking his position at the beginning of a game. Smith won his first Gold Glove Award in 1980 and made his first All-Star Game appearance in 1981.

When Smith clashed with the Padres&#x27; owners, Cardinals manager Whitey Herzog flew to San Diego to persuade the shortstop that he would be an appreciated and core component of the St. Louis team. Herzog&#x27;s overture worked; Smith waived his contract&#x27;s &quot;no trade&quot; clause and was traded to the Cardinals for shortstop Garry Templeton in 1982.

Upon joining the Cardinals, Smith helped the team win the 1982 World Series. Three years later, his game-winning home run during Game 5 of the 1985 National League Championship Series prompted broadcaster Jack Buck&#x27;s &quot;Go crazy, folks!&quot; play-by-play call. Despite a rotator cuff injury during the 1985 season, Smith posted career highs in multiple offensive categories in 1987. Smith continued to earn Gold Gloves and All-Star appearances annually until 1993. During the 1995 season, Smith had shoulder surgery and was out nearly three months. After tension with his new manager Tony La Russa developed in 1996, Smith retired at season&#x27;s end, and his uniform number (No. 1) was subsequently retired by the Cardinals. Smith served as host of the television show &quot;This Week in Baseball&quot; from 1997 to 1998.

==Early life==
Smith was born in Mobile, Alabama, the second of Clovi and Marvella Smith&#x27;s six children (five boys and one girl). His father worked as a sandblaster at Brookley Air Force Base. When Smith was six, his family moved to the Watts section of Los Angeles. His father became a delivery truck driver for Safeway stores, while his mother became an aide at a nursing home. His mother was an influential part of his life who stressed the importance of education and encouraged him to pursue his dreams.

Smith played a variety of sports in his youth, though considered baseball to be his favorite. He developed quick reflexes through various athletic and leisure activities, such as bouncing a ball off the concrete steps in front of his house, moving in closer to reduce reaction time with each throw. When not at the local YMCA or playing sports, Smith sometimes went with friends to the neighborhood lumberyard, springboarding off inner tubes and doing flips into sawdust piles (a precursor to his famous backflips). In 1965, at age 10, he endured the Watts Riots with his family, recalling, &quot;We had to sleep on the floor because of all the sniping and looting going on.&quot;

While Smith was attending junior high school, his parents divorced. Continuing to pursue his interest in baseball, he would ride the bus for nearly an hour to reach Dodger Stadium, cheering for the Los Angeles Dodgers at about 25 games a year. Upon becoming a student at Locke High School, Smith played on the basketball and baseball teams. Smith was a teammate of future National Basketball Association player Marques Johnson on the basketball team, and a teammate of future fellow Hall-of-Fame player Eddie Murray on the baseball side. After high school, Smith attended Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in 1974 on a partial academic scholarship, and managed to walk on to the baseball team. He learned to switch-hit from Cal Poly coach Berdy Harr. When Cal Poly&#x27;s starting shortstop broke his leg midway through the 1974 season, Smith took over the starting role. He was named an All-American athlete and established school records in career at-bats (754) and stolen bases (110) before graduating in 1977.

==Professional baseball career==
===San Diego Padres (1978–1981)===
Smith was playing semi-professional baseball in Clarinda, Iowa, when in June 1976 he was selected in the seventh round of the amateur entry draft by the Detroit Tigers. The parties could not agree on a contract; Smith wanted a $10,000 ($ today) signing bonus, while the Tigers offered $8,500 ($ today). Smith returned to Cal Poly for his senior year, then in the 1977 draft was selected in the fourth round by the San Diego Padres, ultimately agreeing to a contract that included a $5,000 signing bonus ($ today). Smith spent his first year of professional baseball during 1977 with the Class A Walla Walla Padres of the Northwest League.

Smith began 1978 as a non-roster invitee to the San Diego Padres&#x27; spring training camp in Yuma, Arizona. Smith credited Padres manager Alvin Dark for giving him confidence by telling reporters the shortstop job was Smith&#x27;s until he proved he can&#x27;t handle it. Even though Dark was fired in the middle of training camp, Smith made his Major League Baseball (MLB) debut on April 7, 1978.

It did not take long for Smith to earn recognition in the major leagues, making what some consider his greatest fielding play only 10 games into his rookie season. The Padres played host to the Atlanta Braves on April 20, 1978, and with two out in the top of the fourth inning, Atlanta&#x27;s Jeff Burroughs hit a ground ball up the middle. Smith described the play by saying, &quot;He hit a ball back up the middle that everybody thought was going into center field. I instinctively broke to my left and dove behind second. As I was in the air, the ball took a bad hop and caromed behind me, but I was able to catch it with my bare hand. I hit the ground, bounced back up, and threw Burroughs out at first.&quot;
During a roadtrip to Houston, later in the season, Smith met a part-time usherette at the Astrodome named Denise while making his way to the team bus outside the stadium. The couple developed a relationship that was sometimes long-distance in nature, and eventually decided to marry. It was also during the 1978 season where Smith introduced a signature move. Padres promotion director Andy Strasberg knew Smith could perform backflips, though only did them during practice before fans entered the stadium. Strasberg asked Smith to do a backflip for fans during Fan Appreciation Day on October 1, the Padres&#x27; last home game of the season. After conferring with veteran teammate Gene Tenace, Smith went ahead with the backflip, and it proved to be wildly popular. Smith finished the 1978 season with a .258 batting average and .970 fielding percentage, placing him second in the National League Rookie of the Year voting to Bob Horner.

After working with a hitting instructor during the offseason, Smith failed to record a base hit in his first 32 at-bats of the 1979 season. Among players with enough at-bats to qualify for the 1979 National League Triple Crown, Smith finished the season last in batting average (.211), home runs (0), and RBI (27). Off the field, conflict developed between Padres&#x27; ownership and the combination of Smith and his agent, Ed Gottlieb. The parties entered into a contract dispute before the 1980 season, and when negotiations lasted into spring training, the Padres renewed Smith&#x27;s contract at his 1979 salary of $72,500 Smith&#x27;s agent told the Padres the shortstop would forgo the season to race in the Tour de France, despite the fact Smith admitted to The Break Room on 96.5 WCMF in Rochester, New York, he had never heard of the Tour. Angered by the Padres&#x27; attitude during those contract talks, Gottlieb took out a help-wanted ad in the &quot;San Diego Union&quot;, part of which read, &quot;Padre baseball player wants part-time employment to supplement income.&quot; When Joan Kroc, wife of Padres owner Ray Kroc, publicly offered Smith a job as an assistant gardener on her estate, Smith and Gottlieb&#x27;s relationship with the organization deteriorated further.

Meanwhile, Smith was winning recognition for his accomplishments on the field. In 1980, he set the single-season record for most assists by a shortstop (621), and began his string of 13 consecutive Gold Glove awards. Smith&#x27;s fielding play prompted the &quot;Yuma Daily Sun&quot; to use the nickname &quot;the Wizard of Oz&quot; in a March 1981 feature article about Smith. While &quot;the Wizard of Oz&quot; nickname was an allusion to the 1939 motion picture of the same name, Smith also came to be known as simply &quot;the Wizard&quot; during his playing career, as Smith&#x27;s Baseball Hall of Fame plaque would later attest. In 1981, Smith made his first All-Star Game appearance as a reserve player.

====Trade====
While Smith was having problems with the Padres&#x27; owners, the St. Louis Cardinals also found themselves unhappy with their shortstop, Garry Templeton. Templeton&#x27;s relationship with Cardinal Nation had become increasingly strained and finally came to a head during a game at Busch Stadium on August 26, 1981, when (after being heckled for not running out a ground ball) he made obscene gestures at fans, and had to be physically pulled off the field by manager Whitey Herzog.

Given the task of overhauling the Cardinals by owner Gussie Busch (and specifically to unload Templeton), Herzog was looking to trade Templeton when he was approached by Padres General Manager Jack McKeon at the 1981 baseball winter meetings. While McKeon had previously told Herzog that Smith was untouchable in any trade, the Padres were now so angry at Smith&#x27;s agent Gottlieb that McKeon was willing to deal. McKeon and Herzog agreed in principle to a six-player trade, with Templeton for Smith as the centerpiece. It was then that Padres manager Dick Williams informed Herzog a no-trade clause had been included in Smith&#x27;s 1981 contract. Upon learning of the trade, Smith&#x27;s initial reaction was to invoke the clause and stay in San Diego, but he was still interested to hear what the Cardinals had to say. While the deal for the players beside Templeton and Smith went through, Herzog flew to San Diego to meet with Smith and Gottlieb over the Christmas holiday. Smith later recalled that, &quot;Whitey told me that with me playing shortstop for the St. Louis Cardinals, we could win the pennant. He made me feel wanted, which was a feeling I was quickly losing from the Padres. The mere fact that Whitey would come all the way out there to talk to us was more than enough to convince me that St. Louis was the place I wanted to be.&quot;

===St. Louis Cardinals (1982–1996)===
====1982–1984====
On December 10, 1981, the Padres traded Smith, Steve Mura, and a player to be named later to the Cardinals for Templeton, Sixto Lezcano and a player to be named later. The teams completed the trade on February 19, 1982, with the Padres sending Al Olmsted to the Cardinals, and St. Louis sending Luis DeLeon to the Padres. Herzog believed Smith could improve his offensive production by hitting more ground balls, and subsequently created a motivational tool designed to help Smith concentrate on that task. Approaching Smith one day during spring training, Herzog said, &quot;Every time you hit a fly ball, you owe me a buck. Every time you hit a ground ball, I owe you a buck. We&#x27;ll keep that going all year.&quot; Smith agreed to the wager, and by the end of the season had won close to $300 from Herzog. As the 1982 season got underway, Herzog&#x27;s newly assembled team won 12 games in a row during the month of April, and finished the season atop the National League East division. Herzog would later say of Smith&#x27;s contributions: &quot;If he saved two runs a game on defense, which he did many a night, it seemed to me that was just as valuable to the team as a player who drove in two runs a game on offense.&quot;

Smith became a father during the 1982 season with the birth of his son O.J., today known as Nikko, on April 28. Smith also developed a lasting friendship with teammate Willie McGee during the season, and Smith said he likes to think he &quot;helped Willie get over some of the rough spots of adjusting to the major leagues&quot;. Smith later participated in the postseason for the first time when the Cardinals faced the Atlanta Braves in the best-of-five 1982 National League Championship Series (NLCS). In Game 1, Smith drove in the series&#x27; first run by hitting a sacrifice fly that scored McGee, ultimately going five for nine in St. Louis&#x27; three-game series sweep.

Just as Herzog had predicted in December, Smith found himself as the team&#x27;s starting shortstop in the best-of-seven 1982 World Series against the Milwaukee Brewers. During the series, Smith scored three runs, had five hits, and did not commit an error in the field. When St. Louis was trailing 3–1 with one out in the sixth inning of Game 7, Smith started a rally with a base hit to left field, eventually scoring the first of the team&#x27;s three runs that inning. The Cardinals scored two more runs in the 8th inning for a 6–3 win and the championship.

In January 1983, Smith and the Cardinals agreed on a new contract that paid Smith $1 million per year.

During the 1983 season, Smith was voted the National League&#x27;s starting shortstop in the All-Star Game for the first time in 1983, and at season&#x27;s end won a fourth consecutive Gold Glove Award.

In July 1984, Smith&#x27;s wrist was broken by a pitch as he batted against the Padres. He returned from the disabled list after a month, but his return to the lineup was not enough to propel the Cardinals to a postseason berth.

====1985–1986====

In 1985, Smith amassed a .276 batting average, 31 stolen bases, and 591 assists in the field. The Cardinals as a team won 101 games during the season and earned another postseason berth. Facing the Los Angeles Dodgers in the now best-of-seven NLCS, a split of the first four games set the stage for Game 5 at Busch Stadium. With the score tied at two runs apiece in the bottom of the ninth inning, Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda called upon closer Tom Niedenfuer to pitch. Smith batted left-handed against Niedenfuer with one out. Smith, who had never hit a home run in his previous 2,967 left-handed major league at-bats, pulled an inside fastball down the right-field line for a walk-off home run, ending Game 5 in a 3–2 Cardinals victory. Smith said, &quot;I was trying to get an extra-base hit and get into scoring position. Fortunately, I was able to get the ball up.&quot; The home run not only prompted broadcaster Jack Buck&#x27;s &quot;Go crazy folks&quot; play-by-play call, but was also later voted the greatest moment in Busch Stadium history by Cardinals fans.

After Smith&#x27;s teammate Jack Clark hit a late-inning home run of his own in Game 6 to defeat the Dodgers, the Cardinals moved on to face the Kansas City Royals in the 1985 World Series. Once again sportswriters were quick to draw attention to Smith&#x27;s outstanding defensive play instead of his 2 for 23 effort at the plate. After the Cardinals took a three-games-to-two advantage, a controversial Game 6 call by umpire Don Denkinger overshadowed the remainder of the Series (which the Royals won in seven games).

What was not publicly known during the regular season and playoffs was that Smith had torn his rotator cuff after suffering an impingement in his right shoulder during the July 11–14 homestand against the Padres. After suffering the impingement diving back into first base on a pickoff throw, Smith altered his throwing motion to such a degree that the rotator cuff tear subsequently developed. The 5&#x27;10&quot; (1.78 m), 180-pound (82 kg) Smith opted to forgo surgery and instead built up his arm strength via weightlifting, playing through whatever pain he encountered. Said Smith, &quot;I didn&#x27;t tell anybody about the injury, because I wanted to keep playing and didn&#x27;t want anybody thinking they could run on me or take advantage of the injury. I tried to do almost everything, except throw a baseball, left-handed: opening a door, turning on the radio—everything. It didn&#x27;t get any better, but it was good enough that I didn&#x27;t have to have surgery.&quot;

Because of his injury, Smith let his then four-year-old son Nikko perform his traditional Opening Day backflip before the Cardinals&#x27; first home game of the 1986 season. Smith made an &quot;eye-popping&quot; play later that season on August 4, during a game against the Philadelphia Phillies at Busch Stadium. In the top of the ninth inning, Phillies pinch-hitter Von Hayes hit a short fly ball to left field, which was pursued by both Smith and left fielder Curt Ford. Running with his back to home plate, Smith dove forward, simultaneously catching the ball while parallel to the ground and flying over the diving Ford, avoiding a collision by inches.

====1987–1990====
After hitting in either the second or eighth spot in the batting order for most of his time in St. Louis, Herzog made Smith the number-two hitter full-time during the 1987 season. Over the course of the year, Smith accrued a .303 batting average, 43 stolen bases, 75 RBIs, 104 runs scored, and 40 doubles, good enough to earn him the Silver Slugger Award at shortstop. In addition to winning the Gold Glove Award at shortstop for the eighth consecutive time, Smith posted a career-high on-base percentage of .392. Smith was also the leading vote-getter in the 1987 All-Star Game. The Cardinals earned a postseason berth with 95 wins, and subsequently faced the San Francisco Giants in the 1987 National League Championship Series. Smith contributed a triple during the series, and the Cardinals won the contest in seven games.

The 1987 World Series matched the Cardinals against the American League champion Minnesota Twins. The home team won every game of the contest, as Minnesota won the series. In 28 at-bats during the Series, Smith scored three runs and had two RBIs. Smith finished second in MVP balloting to Andre Dawson, who had played on the last-place Chicago Cubs, largely because Smith and teammate Jack Clark split the first-place vote. Following the 1987 season, Smith was awarded the largest contract in the National League at $2.34 million.

While the team did not see the postseason for the remainder of the decade, Smith continued to rack up All-Star appearances and Gold Gloves. Combined with the attention he received from his contract, Smith continued to be a national figure. Known as a savvy dresser, he made the April 1988 cover of &quot;GQ&quot; magazine. Smith was witness to change within the Cardinal organization when owner Gussie Busch died in 1989 and Herzog quit as manager during the 1990 season.

====1990–1995====
Joe Torre became Smith&#x27;s new manager in 1990, but the team did not reach the postseason during Torre&#x27;s nearly five-year tenure. While the Cardinals celebrated their 100th anniversary in 1992, Smith marked milestones of his own, stealing his 500th career base on April 26, then notching a triple on May 26 in front of the home crowd for his 2,000th hit. St. Louis had a one-game lead in the National League East division on June 1, 1992, but injuries took their toll on the team, including Smith&#x27;s two-week illness in late July after contracting chicken pox for the first time. As a testament to his national visibility during this time, Smith appeared in a 1992 episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; titled &quot;Homer at the Bat&quot;. Smith became a free agent for the first time in his career on November 2, 1992, only to re-sign with the Cardinals on December 6.

Smith won his final Gold Glove in 1992, and his 13 consecutive Gold Gloves at shortstop in the National League has yet to be matched. The 1993 season marked the only time between 1981 and 1996 where Smith failed to make the All-Star team, and Smith finished the 1993 season with a .288 batting average and .974 fielding percentage. He appeared in 98 games during the strike-shortened 1994 season, and later missed nearly three months of the 1995 season after shoulder surgery on May 31. Smith was recognized for his community service efforts with the 1994 Branch Rickey Award and the 1995 Roberto Clemente Award. In February 1994, Smith took on the role of honorary chairman and official spokesman for the Missouri Governor&#x27;s Council on Physical Fitness and Health.

====1996====
As Smith entered the 1996 season, he finalized a divorce from his wife Denise during the first half of the year. Meanwhile, manager Tony La Russa began his first season with the Cardinals in tandem with a new ownership group. After General Manager Walt Jocketty acquired shortstop Royce Clayton during the offseason, La Russa emphasized an open competition for the spot that would give the Cardinals the best chance to win. When spring training concluded, Smith had amassed a .288 batting average and zero errors in the field, and Clayton batted .190 with eight errors. Smith believed he had earned the position with his spring training performance, but La Russa disagreed, and awarded Clayton the majority of playing time in the platoon situation that developed, where Smith typically saw action every third game. La Russa said, I think it&#x27;s fair to say he misunderstood how he compared to Royce in spring training ... When I and the coaches evaluated the play in spring training—the whole game—Royce started very slowly offensively and you could see him start to get better. By what he was able to do defensively and on the bases, Royce deserved to play the majority of the games.

Smith missed the first month of the season with a hamstring injury, and continued to harbor ill feelings toward La Russa that had developed after spring training ended. In a closed-door meeting in mid-May, La Russa asked Smith if he would like to be traded. Instead, Smith and his agent negotiated a compromise with Cardinals management, agreeing to a buyout of special provisions in his contract in conjunction with Smith announcing his retirement. The agreement prompted a press conference at Busch Stadium on June 19, 1996, during which Smith announced he would retire from baseball at season&#x27;s end.
As Smith made his final tour of the National League, he was honored by many teams, and received a standing ovation at the 1996 All-Star Game in Philadelphia. Between June 19 and September 1, Smith&#x27;s batting average increased from .239 to .286. On September 2 Smith tied a career high by scoring four runs, one of which was a home run, and another on a close play at home plate in the bottom of the 10th inning against division leader Houston. The victory moved the Cardinals to within a half game of Houston in the National League Central Division, and the Cardinals went on to win the division by six games. The Cardinals held a special ceremony at Busch Stadium on September 28, 1996, before a game against the Cincinnati Reds, honoring Smith by retiring his uniform number. Noted for his ritual backflip before Opening Days, All-Star Games, and postseason games, Smith chose this occasion to perform it for one of the last times.

In the postseason, the Cardinals first faced the San Diego Padres in the 1996 National League Division Series. After sitting out Game 1, Smith got the start in Game 2 at Busch Stadium, helping his team go up two games in the series by notching a run, a hit and two walks at the plate, along with an assist and a putout in the field. The Cardinals then swept the series by winning Game 3 in San Diego.

The Cardinals faced the Atlanta Braves in the 1996 National League Championship Series. Smith started Game 1 and subsequently registered three putouts and one assist in the field, but went hitless in four at-bats in the Cardinals&#x27; 4–2 loss. The Cardinals then won Games 2, 3, and 4, contests in which Smith did not appear. Upon receiving the start in Game 5, Smith nearly duplicated his Game 1 performance with four putouts, one assist, and no hits in four at-bats as part of another Cardinals defeat. The Cardinals also failed to win Game 6 or Game 7 in Atlanta, ending their season. When the Cardinals were trailing by 10 runs during Game 7 on October 17, Smith flied out to right field while pinch-hitting in the sixth inning, marking the end of his playing career.

Smith finished his career with distinctions ranging from the accumulation of more than 27.5 million votes in All-Star balloting, to holding the record for the most MLB at-bats without hitting a grand slam.

==Post-playing career==
Upon retirement, Smith took over from Mel Allen as the host of the television series &quot;This Week in Baseball&quot; (&quot;TWIB&quot;) in 1997. Smith also became color commentator for the local broadcast of Cardinals games on KPLR-TV from 1997 to 1999. When his stint on &quot;This Week in Baseball&quot; concluded, Smith then moved on to do work for CNN-SI beginning in 1999. After La Russa retired as manager of the Cardinals in 2011, Smith became active in the organization again, starting with his stint as a special instructor for the team&#x27;s 2012 spring training camp.

On January 8, 2002 Smith learned via a phone call he had been elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame on his first ballot by receiving 91.7% of the votes cast. As it happened, the Olympic torch was passing through St. Louis on its way to Salt Lake City for the 2002 Winter Olympics, and Smith served as a torchbearer in a ceremony with St. Louis Rams&#x27; quarterback Kurt Warner that evening. Smith was inducted into the Hall of Fame during ceremonies on July 28, 2002. During his speech, he compared his baseball experiences with the characters from the novel &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;, after which his son Dustin presented his Hall of Fame plaque. Days later on August 11, Smith was back at Busch Memorial Stadium for the unveiling of a statue in his likeness made by sculptor Harry Weber. Weber chose to emphasize Smith&#x27;s defensive skills by showing Smith stretched horizontal to the ground while fielding a baseball. At the ceremony Weber told Smith, &quot;You spent half of your career up in the air. That makes it difficult for a sculptor to do something with it.&quot;

Smith has also been an entrepreneur in a variety of business ventures. Smith opened &quot;Ozzie&#x27;s&quot; restaurant and sports bar in 1988, started a youth sports academy in 1990, became an investor in a grocery store chain in 1999, and partnered with David Slay to open a restaurant in the early 2000s. Of those businesses the youth academy remains in operation, with the restaurant having closed in 2010 after changing ownership and locations once. Aside from appearing in numerous radio and television commercials in the St. Louis area since retiring from baseball, Smith authored a children&#x27;s book in 2006 and launched his own brand of salad dressing in 2008.

Besides the National Baseball Hall of Fame, Smith has also been inducted or honored in other halls of fame and recognitions. In 1999, he ranked number 87 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and finished third in voting at shortstop for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. He was honored with induction into the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame, Alabama Sports Hall of Fame and the St. Louis Walk of Fame, and received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree from Cal Poly. In January 2014, the Cardinals announced Smith among 22 former players and personnel to be inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum for the inaugural class of 2014.

In March 2023, Smith returned to his alma mater, as his statue in Baggett Stadium was rededicated as part of Ozzie Smith Plaza at the facility&#x27;s entrance.

==Personal life==
Smith is the father to three children from his marriage to former wife Denise: sons Nikko and Dustin, and daughter Taryn. Nikko cracked the top ten finalists of the 2005 edition of &quot;American Idol&quot;. In 2012, Smith made news headlines again, when he sold all of his Gold Gloves at auction together for more than $500,000.

Smith still lives in and remains a visible figure around St. Louis, making varied appearances like playing the role of the Wizard in the St. Louis Municipal Opera&#x27;s summer 2001 production of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. He is the host of Cardinals Insider, a weekly news magazine television show about the club. Since 2016, he has opened five regenerative medicine clinics around Missouri.

<text>The OC-135B Open Skies is a United States Air Force observation aircraft that supports the Treaty on Open Skies. The aircraft, a modified WC-135B, flies unarmed observation flights over participating parties of the treaty. Three OC-135B aircraft were modified by the Aeronautical Systems Center&#x27;s 4950th Test Wing at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio but only two were ever used. The first operationally-capable OC-135B was assigned to the 24th Reconnaissance Squadron at Offutt AFB in October 1993. It is now fitted with a basic set of navigational and sensor equipment, and was placed in inviolate storage at the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base near Tucson, Arizona in 1997. Two fully operational OC-135B aircraft were delivered in 1996 with the full complement of treaty-allowed sensors, which includes an infrared line scanner, synthetic aperture radar and video scanning sensors. 

In May 2020, the Trump administration said it would exit the treaty and gave the required six-month notice. In November, it announced plans to liquidate the two 60-year-old jets, offering them to other countries.

==Description of aircraft==
The interior seats 35 people, including the cockpit crew, aircraft maintenance crew, with bunks for the Crew Chiefs to sleep, foreign country representatives and crew members from the U.S. Department of Defense&#x27;s Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA). Cameras installed include one vertical and two oblique KS-87E framing cameras used for low-altitude photography approximately 3,000 feet (900 m) above the ground, and one KA-91C panoramic camera, which scans from side to side to provide a wide sweep for each picture used for high-altitude photography at approximately .

The data annotation and recording system (DARMS) processes navigational, altitude, time and camera signals to annotate each picture with correct position, altitude, time, roll angle and other information. In addition, this system records every picture taken according to camera, frame and navigational position. A keyboard with trackball is the input device for operation of this system. Two Barco VGA color monitors display camera annotation and other camera data on screen for the sensor operator and observer use.

Camera control, located in the sensor operator&#x27;s console, operates and adjusts individual cameras for cloud cover, frame overlap and other functions. The sensor operator console seats four and has all the equipment listed above plus camera bay heating control, chronometers, emergency oxygen, interphone and individual lighting. The flight following console also seats four and includes most of the equipment listed above except for DARMS and camera controls.

Seven commercial Norcold Tek II coolers with individual refrigeration units maintain temperature and humidity control to maintain peak film performance. The units can be removed, if necessary, from the aircraft in order to transport film. The coolers are capable of storing of film or lots of food and drinks when in country.

==Flight path==
The aircraft flies on its intended flight path throughout the entire mission with no reliance on ground-based navigation devices. A top-of-the-line commercial system, Litton 92 INS/GPS, which is an integrated inertial navigation system (INS) with a global positioning system (GPS), provides continuous updates. The GPS updates the INS several times per second to correct any deviations in the flight path. The INS also feeds precise latitude, longitude, time, roll angle and barometric altitude to the DARMS and camera systems. A true airspeed computer feeds true airspeed data to the INS.

A combined altitude radar altimeter provides precise height above ground information to the pilot for navigational purposes as well as a signal to DARMS for film annotation. It is accurate from above the ground level. Plus, a metric altimeter is installed on the pilot&#x27;s instrument panel for altitude reference when flying in countries that use meters for altitude reference.

The aircraft are being upgraded with the Block 30 Pacer Crag Navigational System upgrade, a first step in making them compliant with ICAO mandated Global Air Traffic Management and Global Air Navigation Standards guidelines.

== Modifications ==
The OC-135B modifications center around four cameras installed in the rear of the aircraft. Since its primary mission is to take pictures, most of the installed equipment and systems provide direct support to the cameras and the camera operator. Other modifications to the aircraft also included installing an auxiliary power unit, crew luggage compartment, sensor operator console, flight following console and upgraded avionics. Though the aircraft feature a large window in the cargo door, this is simply a remnant of their previous weather reconnaissance role.

Other modifications support the aircrew. A gaseous oxygen system replaced the liquid oxygen system to be more compatible with foreign airfields, and fluorescent lighting system was added throughout the cabin to provide adequate lighting for operation and inspections. Four upgraded seats with a conference table, interphone, lighting and oxygen comprise the mission commanders&#x27; station for both countries&#x27; mission commanders. A four channel interphone system enables segregated communications between various elements on board. 
The auxiliary power unit enables the aircraft to start engines and provides electrical power and cabin heat independent of ground support equipment. It was manufactured by Allied Signal with the installation and design of the installation by E-Systems and World Auxiliary Power Company.

Until 2022 the aircraft were assigned to Air Combat Command at the 55th Wing, 45th Reconnaissance Squadron, Offutt Air Force Base near Omaha, Nebraska, for operations, training and maintenance. These aircraft are now located in the boneyard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base and are being decommissioned. When tasked, ACC&#x27;s role was to transport a DTRA observation team to an Open Skies point of entry airport, conduct the observation flight, and then return the team to the continental United States.

<doc id="22792" wikidata="Q1928989" url="?curid=22792" title="Treaty on Open Skies">
<text>The Treaty on Open Skies establishes a program of unarmed aerial surveillance flights over the entire territory of its participants. The treaty is designed to enhance mutual understanding and confidence by giving all participants, regardless of size, a direct role in gathering information about military forces and activities of concern to them. It entered into force on 1 January 2002, and currently has 34 party states. The idea of allowing countries to openly surveil each other is thought to prevent misunderstandings (e.g., to assure a potential opponent that one&#x27;s country is not about to go to war) and limit the escalation of tensions. It also provides mutual accountability for countries to follow through on treaty promises.

The concept of &quot;mutual aerial observation&quot; was initially proposed to Soviet Premier Nikolai Bulganin at the Geneva Conference of 1955 by U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower; however, the Soviets promptly rejected the concept and it lay dormant for several years. The treaty was eventually signed as an initiative of U.S. president (and former Central Intelligence Agency Director) George H. W. Bush in 1989. Negotiated by the then-members of NATO and the Warsaw Pact, the agreement was signed in Helsinki, Finland, on 24 March 1992.

On 22 November 2020, the United States withdrew from the treaty, and on 15 January 2021, Russia also announced its intention to leave, citing the U.S. withdrawal and the inability of member nations to guarantee that information gathered would not be shared with the U.S. Russia formally withdrew in December 2021.

== Membership ==
The 32 state parties to the Open Skies Treaty are Belarus, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark (including Greenland), Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom. Kyrgyzstan signed the treaty but has not yet ratified it. Canada and Hungary are the depositaries of the treaty in recognition of their special contributions to the Open Skies process. Depositary countries maintain treaty documents and provide administrative support.

The Open Skies treaty is one of unlimited duration, and is open to accession by other states. Republics of the former Soviet Union (U.S.S.R.) that have not already become state parties to the treaty may join it at any time. Applications from other interested countries are subject to a consensus decision by the Open Skies Consultative Commission (OSCC). Eight countries have joined into the treaty since it entered into force in 2002: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia, and Sweden.

== Open Skies Consultative Commission ==
The Open Skies Consultative Commission is the implementing body for the Treaty on Open Skies. It comprises representatives from each state party to the treaty and meets monthly at the Vienna headquarters of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe.

== Summary ==
=== Territory ===
The Open Skies regulations covers the territory over which the parties exercise sovereignty, including mainland, islands, and internal and territorial waters. The treaty specifies that the entire territory of a member state is open to observation. Observation flights may only be restricted for reasons of flight safety and not for reasons of national security.

=== Aircraft ===

Observation aircraft may be provided by either the observing party or by the observed party (the &quot;taxi option&quot;), at the latter&#x27;s choice. All Open Skies aircraft and sensors must pass specific certification and pre-flight inspection procedures to ensure that they are compliant with treaty standards.

The official certified U.S. Open Skies aircraft is the OC-135B Open Skies.

Canada uses a C-130 Hercules aircraft equipped with a &quot;SAMSON&quot; sensor pod to conduct flights over other treaty nations. The pod is a converted CC-130 fuel tank modified to carry the permitted sensors, along with associated on-board mission systems. A consortium of nations consisting of Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Canada, France, Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain own and operate this system. The costs of maintaining the SAMSON Pod are shared, based on each nation&#x27;s flight quota and actual use.

Bulgaria, Romania, Russia, and Ukraine use the Antonov An-30 for their flights. The Czech Republic also used to use the An-30 for this purpose but apparently retired all of theirs from service in 2003.

Russia also uses a Tu-154M-ON monitoring aircraft. Germany formerly used this type as well until the aircraft was lost in a 1997 accident. Russia is phasing out both An-30 and Tu-154M-ON and replacing them with two Tu-214ON with the registrations RA-64519 and RA-64525. This aircraft&#x27;s new sensor suite, though, is being challenged by the US.

Sweden uses a Saab 340 aircraft (&quot;OS-100&quot;) that was certified in 2004.

Until 2008, the U.K. designated aircraft was an Andover C.1(PR) aircraft, registration XS596. Since then the U.K. has used a variety of aircraft including a Saab 340, an An-30, and an OC-135.

In 2017, the German Air Force purchased an Airbus A319 as its future Open Skies aircraft.

=== Sensors ===
Open Skies aircraft may have video, optical panoramic, and framing cameras for daylight photography, infrared line scanners for a day/night capability, and synthetic aperture radar for a day/night all weather capability. Photographic image quality will permit recognition of major military equipment (e.g., permit a member state to distinguish between a tank and a truck), thus allowing significant transparency of military forces and activities. Sensor categories may be added and capabilities improved by agreement among member states. All sensors used in Open Skies must be commercially available to all signatories. Imagery resolution is limited to 30 centimetres.

=== Quotas ===
Each state party is obligated to receive observation flights per its passive quota allocation. Each state party may conduct as many observation flightsits active quotaas its passive quota. During the first three years after entry into force, each state was obligated to accept no more than seventy-five percent of its passive quota. Since the overall annual passive quota for the United States is 42, this means that it was obligated to accept no more than 31 observation flights a year during this three-year period. Only two flights were requested over the United States during 2005, by the Russian Federation and Republic of Belarus group of states parties (which functions as a single entity for quota allocation purposes). The United States is entitled to 8 of the 31 annual flights available over Russia/Belarus. Additionally, the United States is entitled to one flight over Ukraine, which is shared with Canada.

=== Data sharing and availability ===
Imagery collected from Open Skies missions is available to any state party upon request for the cost of reproduction. As a result, the data available to each state party is much greater than that which it can collect itself under the treaty quota system.

== History ==
At a Geneva Conference meeting with Soviet Premier Nikolai Bulganin in 1955, U.S. President Eisenhower proposed that the United States and Soviet Union conduct surveillance overflights of each other&#x27;s territory to reassure each country that the other was not preparing to attack. The fears and suspicions of the Cold War led Soviet General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev to reject Eisenhower&#x27;s proposal, known as the Open Skies proposal.

34 years later, the Open Skies concept was reintroduced by U.S. President George H. W. Bush as a means to build confidence and security between all North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and Warsaw Pact countries. In February 1990, an international Open Skies conference involving all NATO and Warsaw Pact countries was held in Ottawa, Canada. Subsequent rounds of negotiations were held in Budapest, Hungary; Vienna, Austria; and Helsinki, Finland.

On 24 March 1992, the Open Skies Treaty was signed in Helsinki by U.S. Secretary of State James Baker and foreign ministers from 23 other countries. The treaty entered into force on 2 January 2002, after Russia and Belarus completed ratification procedures.

In November 1992, President George W. Bush assigned responsibility for overall training, management, leadership, coordination, and support for U.S. Open Skies observation missions to the On-Site Inspection Agency (OSIA), a part of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA). Until entry into force in January 2002, DTRA support for the treaty involved participating in training and joint trial flights (JTFs). The U.S. has conducted over 70 JTFs since 1993. By March 2003, DTRA had successfully certified 16 camera configurations on the OC-135B aircraft. They also had contributed to the certification of the Bulgarian An-30, Hungarian An-26, SAMSON POD Group (see above) C-130H, Romanian An-30, Russian An-30, and Ukrainian An-30. The United States successfully flew its first Open Skies mission over Russia in December 2002.

Formal observation flights began in August 2002. During the first treaty year, state parties conducted 67 observation flights. In 2004, state parties conducted 74 missions, and planned 110 missions for 2005. On 8 and 9 March 2007, Russia conducted overflights of Canada under the Treaty. The OSCC continues to address modalities for conducting observation missions and other implementation issues.

Since 2002, a total of 40 missions have taken place over the U.K. There were 24 quota missions conducted by: Russia – 20; Ukraine – three; and Sweden – one. There were 16 training flights conducted by: Benelux (joint with Estonia); Estonia (joint with Benelux); Georgia – three (one joint with Sweden); Sweden – three (one joint with Georgia); U.S. – three; Latvia; Lithuania; Romania; Slovenia; and Yugoslavia. Also since 2002, the U.K. has undertaken a total of 51 open skies missions – 38 were quota missions to the following countries: Ukraine (five); Georgia (seven); and Russia (26); 13 missions were training missions to the following nations: Bulgaria; Yugoslavia; Estonia; Slovenia (three); Sweden (three); US; Latvia, Lithuania, and the Benelux. The flights cost approximately £50,000 per operational mission, and approximately £25,000 for training missions with an approximate annual cost of £175,000.

A Russian Defence Ministry spokesman stated on 4 February 2016 that Turkey had refused a Russian Open Skies mission, planned to take place on 1–5 February 2016, to fly over areas adjacent to Syria, as well as over NATO air bases. According to Russia, Turkey gave no explanation regarding the limitations, and claimed that they indicated illegal military activity in Syrian territory. The OSCC has not commented on the alleged violation of the Treaty by Turkey.

By 2016, Russian aircraft was using upgraded equipment for missions.

=== Challenges to the treaty ===
Both Russia and the United States alleged that the other was violating the provisions of the treaty. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo cited Russia&#x27;s access refusal in the Russian-controlled areas of Georgia. On 20 September 2019, the U.S. and Canada were denied access to a military exercise in central Russia.

=== American withdrawal ===
In October 2019, documents from the U.S. House of Representatives indicated that President Donald Trump was considering withdrawing from the Open Skies Treaty. Ukraine was against the move, fearing it would enable Russia to reduce further or ban overflights, thus reducing their knowledge of Russian military movements.

In April 2020, it was reported that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Defense Mark Esper had agreed to proceed with U.S. withdrawal from the Treaty on Open Skies. On 21 May 2020, President Trump announced that the United States would be withdrawing from the treaty due to alleged Russian violations.

On 22 May 2020, the United States submitted notice of withdrawal from the Treaty on Open Skies. Senate Democrats questioned the appropriateness of withdrawal so close to the 2020 United States presidential election.

On 22 November 2020, United States official sources—including U.S. Department of State websites, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and the National Security Council&#x27;s official Twitter account—announced that the six-month period was over and the U.S. was no longer a party to the Treaty. The U.S. said it would share some of its intelligence and reconnaissance information with European allies to make up for any loss of critical information from the withdrawal.

=== Russian withdrawal ===
In January 2021, Russia announced that it would follow the United States in withdrawing from the Treaty on Open Skies. The Biden administration informed Moscow in May 2021 that it would not re-enter the pact; on 7 June 2021 Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law that formalized Russia&#x27;s exit from the Treaty on Open Skies.

<doc id="22794" wikidata="Q1814174" url="?curid=22794" title="Limited overs cricket">
<text>Limited overs cricket, also known as white ball cricket, is a version of the sport of cricket in which a match is generally completed in one day. There are a number of formats, including List A cricket (8-hour games), Twenty20 cricket (3-hour games), and 100-ball cricket (2.5 hours). The name reflects the rule that in the match each team bowls a set maximum number of overs (sets of 6 legal balls), usually between 20 and 50, although shorter and longer forms of limited overs cricket have been played.

The concept contrasts with Test and first-class matches, which can take up to five days to complete. One-day cricket is popular with spectators as it can encourage aggressive, risky, entertaining batting, often results in cliffhanger endings, and ensures that a spectator can watch an entire match without committing to five days of continuous attendance.

==Structure==
Each team bats only once, and each innings is limited to a set number of overs, usually fifty in a One Day International and between forty and sixty in a List A. List A is a classification of the limited-overs (one-day) form of cricket, technically as the domestic level.

Despite its name, important one-day matches, international and domestic, often have two days set aside, the second day being a &quot;reserve&quot; day to allow more chance of the game being completed if a result is not possible on the first day (for instance if play is prevented or interrupted by rain).

=== Tiebreaker ===

In some tied limited-overs games, a Super Over is played, wherein each team bats for a one-over innings with two wickets in hand. A tied Super Over may be followed by another Super Over.

===Player restrictions===
====Bowling restrictions====

In almost all competitive one-day games, a restriction is placed on the number of overs that may be bowled by any one bowler. This is to prevent a side playing two top-class bowlers with extremely good stamina who can bowl throughout their opponents&#x27; innings. The usual limitation is set so that a side must include at least five players who bowl i.e. each bowler can only bowl 20% of the overs. For example, the usual limit for twenty-over cricket is four overs per bowler, for forty-over cricket eight per bowler and for fifty-over cricket ten per bowler. There are exceptions: Pro Cricket in the United States restricted bowlers to five overs each, thus leaving a side requiring only four bowlers.

====Fielding restrictions====
=== White balls ===

Limited over cricket is usually played with white balls rather than the traditional red balls. This was introduced because the team batting second is likely to need to play under floodlights and a white ball is easier to see under these conditions. The white balls are supposed to be otherwise identical to traditional balls, but according to BBC Sport, some cricketers claim that the harder surface causes white balls to swing more.

==History==
The idea for a one-day, limited 50-over cricket tournament, was first played in the inaugural match of the All India Pooja Cricket Tournament in 1951 at Tripunithura in Kochi, Kerala. It is thought to be the brain child of KV Kelappan Thampuran, a former cricketer and the first Secretary of the Kerala Cricket Association. The first limited-overs tournament between first-class English teams was the Midlands Knock-Out Cup, which took place in May 1962. Played with 65-over innings, the Cup was organised by Mike Turner, secretary of the Leicestershire County Cricket Club. The competition was small, with three other county teams participating in addition to Leicestershire. However, it drew commercial television coverage and positive commentary by journalists, who noted the potential to attract sponsors and spectators amid declining attendance levels.

The following year, the first full-scale one-day competition between first-class teams was played, the knock-out Gillette Cup, won by Sussex. The number of overs was reduced to 60 for the 1964 season. League one-day cricket also began in England, when the John Player Sunday League was started in 1969 with 40-over matches. Both these competitions continued, with changes in sponsorship, till 2010, when they were replaced by the ECB 40. This was in turn replaced by the 50-over One-Day Cup in 2014.

The first Limited Overs International (LOI) or One-Day International (ODI) match was played between Australia and England in Melbourne on 5 January 1971, and the quadrennial cricket World Cup began in 1975. Many of the &quot;packaging&quot; innovations, such as coloured clothing, were as a result of World Series Cricket, a &quot;rebel&quot; series set up outside the cricketing establishment by Australian entrepreneur Kerry Packer. For more details, see History of cricket.

Twenty20, a curtailed form of one-day cricket with 20 overs (120 legal balls) per side, was first played in England in 2003. It has proven very popular, and several Twenty20 matches have been played between national teams. It makes several changes to the usual laws of cricket, including the use of a Super Over (one or more additional overs played by each team) to decide the result of tied matches.

100-ball cricket (2.5-hour games), another form of one-day cricket with 100 deliveries per side, launched in England in 2021. It is designed to further shorten game time and to attract a new audience. It makes further changes to the usual laws of cricket, such as the involvement of overs that last 5 balls each.

There are now also T10 leagues with a format of 10 overs per side (resulting in 90-minute games). The Emirates Cricket Board also launched Ninety–90 Bash, an upcoming annual franchise-based 90-ball cricket league in the United Arab Emirates.

==One Day Internationals==

One Day International matches are usually played in brightly coloured clothing often in a &quot;day-night&quot; format where the first innings of the day occurs in the afternoon and the second occurs under stadium lights.

=== One Day International tournaments ===

In the early days of ODI cricket, the number of overs was generally 60 overs per side, and matches were also played with 40, 45 or 55 overs per side, but now it has been uniformly fixed at 50 overs.

Every four years, the Cricket World Cup involves all the Test-playing nations and other national sides who qualify through the ICC World Cup Qualifier. It usually consists of round-robin stages, followed by semi-finals and a final. The International Cricket Council (ICC) determines the venue far in advance.

The ICC Champions Trophy involves all the Test-playing nations, and is held between World Cups. It usually consists of a round-robin group stage, semifinals, and a final.

Each Test-playing country often hosts triangular tournaments, between the host nation and two touring sides. There is usually a round-robin group , and then the leading two teams play each other in a final, or sometimes a best-of-three final. When there is only one touring side, there is still often a best-of-five or best-of-seven series of limited overs matches.

The ICC World Cricket League is an ODI competition for national teams with Associate or Affiliate status.

==List A status==

List A cricket is a classification of the limited-overs (one-day) form of the sport of cricket. Much as domestic first-class cricket is the level below international Test match cricket, so List A cricket is the domestic level of one-day cricket below One Day Internationals. Twenty20 matches do not qualify for the present.

Most cricketing nations have some form of domestic List A competition. The number of overs in List A cricket ranges from forty to sixty overs per side.

The Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians created this category for the purpose of providing an equivalent to first-class cricket, to allow the generation of career records and statistics for comparable one-day matches. Only the more important one-day competitions in each country, plus matches against a touring Test team, are included. The categorisation of cricket matches as &quot;List A&quot; was not officially endorsed by the International Cricket Council until 2006, when the ICC announced that it and its member associations would be determining this classification in a manner similar to that done for first class matches.

Matches that qualify as List A:
* One Day Internationals (ODIs)
* Other international matches.
* Premier one-day tournaments in permanent test playing nations
* Official matches of a Test nations against first-class teams
* Official international matches between (officially) second-tier ODI teams

Matches that do not qualify as List A:
* World Cup warm-up matches
* Other Tourist matches (for example, against first-class teams that are not part of the main domestic first-class competition, such as universities)
* Festival and friendly matches
* One Day tournaments in not test playing nations.

==Domestic competitions==
Domestic one-day competitions exist in almost every country where cricket is played. The table below lists the limited overs tournaments that take place in each full member nation.
==One-day records==
The world record for the highest innings total in any List A limited overs match is 506 for 2 by Tamil Nadu against Arunachal Pradesh in Bengaluru on 21 November 2022. On 17 June 2022, England set a new international record, totalling 498 for 4 against Netherlands at Amstelveen. The lowest ever total is 18 by West Indies U-19 against Barbados at Blairmont in 2007. The record low score in ODIs is 35, by Zimbabwe against Sri Lanka in Harare on 25 April 2004 and United States against Nepal in Kirtipur on 12 February 2020.

The most runs scored by both sides in any List A limited overs match is 872: Australia, batting first, scored 434 for four in 50 overs, and yet were beaten by South Africa who scored 438 for nine with a ball to spare during their One Day International at Johannesburg in 2006.

The highest individual innings is 272 by Narayan Jagadeesan for Tamil Nadu against Arunachal Pradesh in Bengaluru in 2022. The best bowling figures are eight for 10 by Shahbaz Nadeem for Jharkhand against Ranchi at Chennai in 2018. The highest international individual innings is by Rohit Sharma who scored 264. The highest score in any formal limited overs match is believed to be United&#x27;s 630 for five against Bay Area in a 45 overs match at Richmond, California in August 2006.

The most runs in an over was scored by Herschelle Gibbs of the South African cricket team when, in the 2007 Cricket World Cup in the West Indies, he hit 6 sixes in one over bowled by Daan van Bunge of the Netherlands. This record is shared by Yuvraj Singh of India who achieved this feat in the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 in South Africa, he hit 6 sixes in an over bowled by Stuart Broad of England. This was later also achieved by Kieron Pollard, Jaskaran Malhotra, Dipendra Singh Airee, and Darius Visser in international cricket.

<doc id="22796" wikidata="Q81299" url="?curid=22796" title="Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe">
<text>The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) is a regional security-oriented intergovernmental organization comprising member states in Europe, North America, and Asia. Its mandate includes issues such as arms control, the promotion of human rights, freedom of the press, and free and fair elections. It employs around 3,460 people, mostly in its field operations but also in its secretariat in Vienna, Austria, and its institutions. It has observer status at the United Nations.

The OSCE had its origins in 1975: its predecessors came together during the era of the Cold War to form a forum for discussion between the Western Bloc and the Eastern Bloc. Most of its 57 participating countries are in Europe, but with some members in Asia or in North America. The participating countries comprise much of the land area of the Northern Hemisphere.

The OSCE is concerned with early warning, conflict prevention, crisis management, and post-conflict rehabilitation.

== History ==
===Roots===
The Organization has its roots in the 1975 Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE). Talks had been mooted about a European security grouping since the 1950s but the Cold War prevented any substantial progress until the talks at Dipoli in Espoo began in November 1972. These talks were held at the suggestion of the Soviet Union which wished to use the talks to maintain its control over the communist states in Eastern Europe, and President of Finland Urho Kekkonen hosted them in order to bolster his policy of neutrality. Western Europe, however, saw these talks as a way to reduce the tension in the region, furthering economic cooperation and obtaining humanitarian improvements for the populations of the communist bloc.

The recommendations of the talks, in the form of &quot;The Blue Book&quot;, gave the practical foundations for a three-stage conference called the &quot;Helsinki process&quot;. The CSCE opened in Helsinki on 3 July 1973 with 35 states sending representatives. Stage I took only five days to agree to follow the Blue Book. Stage II was the main working phase and was conducted in Geneva from 18 September 1973 until 21 July 1975.

The result of Stage II was the Helsinki Final Act. This was signed by the 35 participating states during Stage III, which took place in Finlandia Hall between 30 July – 1 August 1975. It was opened by the Holy See&#x27;s diplomat Cardinal Agostino Casaroli, who was the chairman of the conference.

The concepts of improving relations and implementing the act were developed over a series of follow-up meetings, with major gatherings in Belgrade (4 October 19778 March 1978), Madrid (11 November 19809 September 1983) and Vienna (4 November 198619 January 1989).

The Copenhagen commitment was written &quot;to ensure that individuals are permitted to exercise their rights to peaceful assembly and freedom of association, including the right to form, join and participate effectively in non-governmental organizations, which seek the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.&quot;

The Moscow Mechanism was agreed in 1991.

===CSCE becomes OSCE===
The fall of the Soviet Union required a change of role for the CSCE. The Charter of Paris for a New Europe, signed on 21 November 1990, marked the beginning of this change. The process was capped by the renaming of the CSCE as the OSCE on 1 January 1995, in accordance with the results of a conference held in Budapest in 1994. The OSCE now had a formal secretariat, a Senior Council, a Parliamentary Assembly, a Conflict Prevention Centre, and an Office for Free Elections, which later became the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights.

In December 1996, the &quot;Lisbon Declaration on a Common and Comprehensive Security Model for Europe for the Twenty-First Century&quot; affirmed the universal and indivisible nature of security on the European continent.

In Istanbul on 19 November 1999, the OSCE ended a two-day summit by calling for a political settlement in Chechnya&lt;ref name=&quot;RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty 1999 z527&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and adopting a Charter for European Security.

Through its Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR), the OSCE observes and assesses elections in its member states, in order to support fair and transparent democratic processes, in keeping with the mutual standards to which the organization is committed; between 1994 and 2004 the OSCE sent teams of observers to monitor more than 150 elections, typically focusing on elections in emerging democracies. In 2004, at the invitation of the United States Government, the ODIHR deployed an assessment mission, made up of participants from six OSCE member states, which observed that year&#x27;s US presidential election and produced a report. It was the first time that a US presidential election was the subject of OSCE monitoring, although the organization had previously monitored state-level American elections in Florida and California, in 2002 and 2003.

==== Criticism of OSCE ====
Members of OSCE have criticized the organization for being in a position where Russia, and sometimes Belarus, can veto all OSCE decisions, Moscow has, for a number of years, not allowed the approval of the organization&#x27;s budget, the organization of official OSCE events or the extension of missions. In November 2023 they vetoed the appointment of Estonia as chairman from 2024.

=== OSCE missions and operations ===

==== 1992 Georgia Mission ====
The OSCE Mission to Georgia was established in November 1992 with its headquarters in the capital Tbilisi. The Mission&#x27;s mandate expired on 31 December 2008. Between these dates it was powerless to control the outbreak of the August 2008 Russo-Georgian war.

==== 1993 Mission to Moldova ====
The objective of the mission to Moldova is to facilitate a comprehensive and lasting political settlement of the Transnistria conflict in all its aspects, strengthening the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova within its internationally recognized borders with a special status for Transnistria.

OSCE promoted a 5+2 format as a diplomatic negotiation platform, which began in 2005, suspended by Russia and Transnistria in 2006 until it started again in 2012, before making slow progress over the next ten years. The process stopped following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine as two of the parties were then at war with each other.

In December 2022 Russia blocked the renewal of the annual mandate by limiting it to a six-month period, repeated again in June 2023 to another six-month period.

==== 1995 Mission to Bosnia and Herzegovina ====
The Bosnian War concluded in 1995 with the Dayton Agreement with the ongoing OSCE Mission being mandated to help secure lasting peace and therefore to build a stable, secure, and democratic state through building sustainable democratic institutions, strengthening good governance and human rights principles, and supporting the development of a multi-national and multi-ethnic democratic society.

==== 1998 Kosovo Mission ====
The OSCE Kosovo Verification Mission was established by the Permanent Council in October 1998 and shuttered in June 1999 amidst the recalcitrance of the Milosevic regime.

The 1999 OSCE Mission in Kosovo took over the work in Kosovo where it concentrates on institution and democracy building, as well as human rights.

The OSCE&#x27;s refusal to police events surrounding the 2008 Kosovo declaration of independence still rankles in Russia.

==== 2001 Mission to Macedonia ====
The ongoing Mission to Macedonia is monitoring and supporting the implementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement that put an end to the 2001 armed conflict in North Macedonia.

==== 2001 Mission to Serbia ====
The current mission to Serbia started after Slobodan Milošević lost his power as President of Serbia and Montenegro in 2000. The mission was mandated to assist the authorities and civil society with democratic development and human rights protection, including the rights of persons belonging to national minorities. To promote democratisation, tolerance and the rule of law.

==== 2006 Mission to Montenegro ====
The current mission began with the 2006 Montenegrin independence referendum, monitored by OSCE, with a mandate being granted with the objective of assisting and promoting the implementation of OSCE principles and commitments including the politico-military and human aspects of security and stability.

==== 2012 Texas election ====
Before the U.S. presidential elections of November 2012, the OSCE announced its intention to send electoral observers to Texas and to other U.S. states. This prompted the Attorney General of Texas Greg Abbott to send letters to U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and to the OSCE, threatening to arrest OSCE officials if they should enter electoral premises in Texas and break Texas law. In reply, the U.S. Department of State stated that OSCE observers enjoyed immunities. In the event, no incidents between OSCE and Texas authorities were recorded during the elections.

==== 2017 Turkey constitutional referendum ====
In April 2017, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan criticized the OSCE for reporting that opposition &quot;No&quot; campaigners in the Turkish constitutional referendum had faced bans, police interventions and arrests. Erdoğan said: &quot;Now the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe says if the result is &#x27;yes&#x27;, that means there are a lot of problems. Who are you? First of all, you should know your place. This is not your duty.&quot;

==== OSCE involvement in Ukraine (2014–2021) ====

On 21 March 2014, the OSCE deployed its Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine at the request of Ukraine&#x27;s government. The mission has received mixed reviews. While some observers have applauded its function as the &quot;eyes and ears of the international community&quot;, others have accused the mission of bias towards either Russia or Ukraine.

On 27 April 2014, the Girkin group that had taken control in the city of Sloviansk took eight members of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (OSCE SMM) as hostages. The group appointed Vyacheslav Ponomarev as mayor of the city.

During the war in Donbas, an OSCE observer allowed Russian separatists to travel in a vehicle with the organization&#x27;s markings; this prompted allegations that the OSCE was biased in the war and not interested in carrying out its duties of mediating a ceasefire. The organization issued a statement regretting the incident.

Moreover, the OSCE Observer Mission at Russian Checkpoints Gukovo and Donetsk (which is organizationally separate from the Special Monitoring Mission) also received criticism alleging that only two checkpoints on the Russian–Ukrainian border are currently being monitored, which Daniel Baer, the US ambassador to the OSCE at the time, described as &quot;seriously inadequate&quot;.

The mission has been criticized for taking months to deploy drones to help monitor borders as well as withdrawing them after only several weeks of use due to Russian electronic attacks. Drones have been reintroduced to observe the conflict in 2018.

In 2014, an advisor to the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence wrongly claimed that approximately 80% of the OSCE observers located near Mariupol were Russian citizens and that many had ties to Russian security agencies such as the FSB and the GRU. In reality, one observer out of 17 in Mariupol was a Russian citizen. In total, the mission reports the number of Russian citizens in its ranks as 39 out of 720, or 5,4%. The organization has also been accused of allegedly revealing the locations of Ukrainian troops to Russian forces during the conflict.

On 1 December 2014, the mission was in the area to &quot;facilitate a local ceasefire and monitor the repair works on a power station&quot;, that it &quot;heard an exchange of artillery fire between unspecified parties&quot;, and that &quot;artillery rounds were impacting at approximately 1km to the east of the SMM&#x27;s position; therefore the SMM left due to security concerns&quot;. Furthermore, the report states that the &quot;SMM team in the JCCC was in constant contact with the SMM team in Staromikhailivka&quot;. No mention of a wounded observer is made.

On 27 October 2015, a suspended OSCE monitor confirmed he had been a former employee of Russia&#x27;s Main Intelligence Directorate. The suspended SMM stated that he had no trouble receiving the position and neither the OSCE nor Ukraine&#x27;s Security Service thoroughly checked his background. Following the report the OSCE issued a comment stating the monitor had been fired due to violations of the organization&#x27;s code of conduct.

On 6 April 2016, photos of OSCE monitors attending the wedding of a Russian separatist emerged. The wedding had taken place in June 2015. The OSCE expressed regret over the incident, issuing a statement saying &quot;The unprofessional behaviour displayed by the monitors in the picture is an individual incident that should not be abused to cast a shadow on the reputation of other mission members.&quot; The OSCE reported that the monitors were no longer with the OSCE special monitoring mission.

In April 2017, an OSCE vehicle struck a mine, which killed one SMM member and injured two. Two armoured vehicles were on patrol near Luhansk when one struck the mine. The dead man was an American paramedic, while the injured included a woman from Germany and a man from the Czech Republic.

On 18 July 2018, the German broadcaster ARD reported that Russian intelligence services had received inside information about the activities of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine from a staff member of the OSCE. The insider information consisted of observers&#x27; preferences in alcohol and women, their financial situation, and their contacts in Ukraine. The OSCE issued a statement expressing concern over the alleged security breach.

Russia has accused members of the Mission of working for the Ukrainian SBU and of spying on the pro-Russian separatists. Furthermore, Russia has accused the mission of bias after it reported troop movements from separatist forces, accusing the mission of ignoring similar moves from Ukraine. Russia&#x27;s foreign minister also has claimed that the mission failed to pay sufficient attention to human and minority rights within the Government-controlled areas of Ukraine. Furthermore, he criticised that the mission did not clearly attribute ceasefire violations to either side.

==== 2022 Mission to Armenia ====
An OSCE Needs Assessment Team was sent to Armenia between 21 and 27 October 2022 following the Armenia–Azerbaijan border crisis. The request was made by the government of Armenia. The OSCE sent international experts to monitor the Armenia–Azerbaijan border.

==== OSCE involvement in Ukraine (2022–present) ====
The 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine began on February 24. The OSCE mandate in Ukraine expired on March 31, 2022, due to objections by Russia. On April 24, 2022, the OSCE protested the detention of four staff members in Donetsk and Luhansk, without specifying who had detained them. On 20 September, two Ukrainian OSCE staffers were sentenced to 13 years of prison by a court in the Luhansk People&#x27;s Republic for &quot;alleged high treason and espionage for the United States.&quot;

In March 2022, 45 participating States promoted, with the support of Ukraine, the activation of the Moscow Mechanism for the establishment of an independent expert mission on violations and abuses committed in the war of the Russian Federation, supported by Belarus, against Ukraine. The report of the Mission of Experts was presented to the OSCE Permanent Council on 13 April 2022 and documented clear patterns of violations of international humanitarian law by the Russian Armed Forces in Ukraine. OSCE/ODIHR continues to monitor the violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law in Ukraine.

On 2 June 2022, the same 45 participating States invoked again the Moscow Mechanism to establish a new mission of experts to consider, follow up and build upon the findings of the Moscow Mechanism report published in April 2022. The subsequent report, presented on 14 July 2022 to the OSCE Permanent Council, confirmed the outcomes of the previous mission and identified blatant violations of international humanitarian law, mainly attributable to the Russian armed forces, as well as widespread violations of human rights, especially in the territories under effective control of the Russian Federation.

The Russian delegation was not invited to the 29th OSCE Ministerial Council in December 2022 where the delegates considered the ramifications and regional security challenges created by Russia&#x27;s continued war against Ukraine. There were calls to assess the reparations that Russia should be accountable for.

Since the start of its invasion of Ukraine, Russia has seized €2.7 million worth of armored vehicles that were previously part of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine. According to a letter that was sent by Russian OSCE representatives to OSCE Secretary-General Helga Schmid in January 2023, 71 trucks and cars were brought to the Luhansk People&#x27;s Republic and the Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic as &quot;evidence&quot; and criminal proceedings were initiated against former OSCE personnel for espionage.

== OSCE Parliamentary Assembly ==

In 2004, the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly sent election observers to the U.S. presidential elections. The OSCE Parliamentary Assembly&#x27;s president at the time was Democratic Congressman Alcee Hastings. Hastings had previously been impeached for corruption by the U.S. Congress. The OSCE faced criticism of partisanship and double standards due to Hastings&#x27;s past and the fact that the OSCE&#x27;s mandate was to promote democracy and the values of civil society.

In 2010, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe was criticized from within by the Latvian delegation for lacking transparency and democracy. Spencer Oliver (b. 1938) secretary general of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, who held the post from the organization&#x27;s inception in 1992 until 2015, faced a challenge from the Latvian Artis Pabriks. According to the rules of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, the incumbent general secretary can only be replaced with a full consensus minus one. Pabriks called the rules &quot;quite shocking from the perspective of an organization that&#x27;s monitoring elections&quot;.

== Legal status ==

A unique aspect of the OSCE is the non-binding status of its constitutive charter. Rather than being a formal treaty ratified by national legislatures, the Helsinki Final Act represents a political commitment by the heads of government of all signatories to build security and cooperation in Europe on the basis of its provisions. This allows the OSCE to remain a flexible &quot;process&quot; for the evolution of improved cooperation, which avoids disputes and/or sanctions over implementation.

By agreeing to these commitments, signatories for the first time accepted that the treatment of citizens &quot;within&quot; their borders was also a matter of legitimate international concern. This open process of the OSCE is often given credit for helping build democracy in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, thus leading to the end of the Cold War. Unlike most international intergovernmental organizations, however, the OSCE does not have international legal personality on account of the lack of legal effect of its charter. As a result, its headquarters&#x27; host, Austria, had to confer legal personality on the organization in order to be able to sign a legal agreement regarding its presence in Vienna.

== Structure and institutions ==
Political direction to the organization is given by heads of state or government during summits. Summits are not regular or scheduled but held as needed. The last summit took place in Astana (Kazakhstan), on 1 and 2 December 2010. The high-level decision-making body of the organization is the OSCE Ministerial Council, which meets at the end of every year. At the ambassadorial level, the OSCE Permanent Council convenes weekly in Vienna and serves as the regular negotiating and decision-making body. The chairman of the Permanent Council is the ambassador to the Organization of the participating State which holds the chairmanship.

In addition to the Ministerial Council and Permanent Council, the Forum for Security Co-operation is also an OSCE decision-making body. It deals predominantly with matters of military co-operation, such as modalities for inspections according to the Vienna Document of 1999.

The OSCE&#x27;s Secretariat is located in Vienna, Austria. The organization also has offices in Copenhagen, Geneva, The Hague, Prague and Warsaw.
, the OSCE employed 3,568 staff, including 609 in its secretariat and institutions and 2,959 in its 17 field operations.

The Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe is made up of 323 parliamentarians from 57 member states. The Parliamentary Assembly performs its functions mainly via the Standing Committee, the Bureau, and 3 General Committees (Committee on Political Affairs and Security, Committee on Economic Affairs, Science, Technology and Environment, and Committee on Democracy, Human Rights and Humanitarian Questions).

The Parliamentary Assembly passes resolutions on matters such as political and security affairs, economic and environmental issues, and democracy and human rights. Representing the collective voice of OSCE parliamentarians, these resolutions and recommendations are meant to ensure that all participating states live up to their OSCE commitments. The Parliamentary Assembly also engages in parliamentary diplomacy, and has an extensive election observation program.
The oldest OSCE institution is the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR), established in 1991 following a decision made at the 1990 Summit of Paris. It is based in Warsaw, Poland, and is active throughout the OSCE area in the fields of election observation, democratic development, human rights, tolerance and non-discrimination, rule of law, and Roma and Sinti issues. The ODIHR has observed over 300 elections and referendums since 1995, sending more than 50,000 observers. It has operated outside its own area twice, sending a team that offered technical support to the 9 October 2004 presidential elections in Afghanistan, an OSCE Partner for Co-operation, and an election support team to assist with parliamentary and provincial council elections on 18 September 2005. ODIHR is headed by Matteo Mecacci, Italy.

The Office of the OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media, established in December 1997, acts as a watchdog to provide early warning on violations of freedom of expression in OSCE participating States. The representative also assists participating States by advocating and promoting full compliance with OSCE norms, principles and commitments regarding freedom of expression and free media. As of 2020, the current representative is Teresa Ribeiro, Portugal.

The High Commissioner on National Minorities was created on 8 July 1992 by the Helsinki Summit Meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. It is charged with identifying and seeking early resolution of ethnic tension that might endanger peace, stability or friendly relations between participating states. As of 2020, the current representative is Kairat Abdrakhmanov (Kazakhstan).

Each year the OSCE holds an OSCE Asian Conference with partner nations (currently Australia, Thailand, South Korea, Japan and Afghanistan).

The OSCE and the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic established the OSCE Academy in 2002. The aim of the OSCE Academy is &quot;to promote regional cooperation, conflict prevention and good governance in Central Asia through offering post-graduate education, professional training and intellectual exchange.&quot;

== Chairmanship ==

The OSCE chairmanship is assumed at yearly intervals by one participating state, which then plays the central role in managing the organization&#x27;s work and in its external representation. The foreign minister of the country possessing the chair holds the OSCE&#x27;s most senior position as chairman-in-office (CiO).

The responsibilities of the chairman-in-office include:
* co-ordination of the work of OSCE institutions;
* representing the OSCE;
* supervising activities related to conflict prevention, crisis management, and post-conflict rehabilitation.

The CiO is assisted by the previous and incoming chairmen-in-office; the three of them together constitute the OSCE . The CiO nominates personal representatives – experts in fields of priority for the CiO. The origin of the institution lies with the Charter of Paris for a New Europe (1990), and the Helsinki Document (1992) formally institutionalized this function.

The OSCE chair for 2022 was Poland, with Zbigniew Rau serving as chairman-in-office. The chair for 2023 is North Macedonia, represented by Bujar Osmani as chairman-in-office.

=== Chairmanship history ===
Chairmanship of the OSCE is held by a member state on a calendar-year basis, with the minister for foreign affairs of that state performing the function of chairman-in-office. The table below shows the holders since 1991. Estonia was due to hold the chairmanship in 2024, however, this was not approved following objections from Russia and Belarus.

== Secretary general ==
While the chairman-in-office is the OSCE&#x27;s most senior official, on a day-to-day basis the secretary general is the OSCE&#x27;s chief administrative officer and can, when requested by the chairmanship, serve as a representative of the chairman-in-office. Since the establishment of the office in 1992, the secretaries general have been:

== Summits of heads of state and government ==
=== Ministerial Council Meetings (ordinary) ===
=== Fiscal history ===
Since 1993, the OSCE&#x27;s budget by year (in millions of euro) has been:

== Relations with the United Nations ==
The OSCE considers itself a regional organization in the sense of Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter and is an observer in the United Nations General Assembly. The Chairman-in-Office gives routine briefings to the United Nations Security Council.

==The three dimensions==
=== Politico-military dimension (first dimension) ===
The OSCE takes a comprehensive approach to the politico-military dimension of security, which includes a number of commitments by participating States and mechanisms for conflict prevention and resolution. The organization also seeks to enhance military security by promoting greater openness, transparency and co-operation.

; Arms control
The end of the Cold War resulted in a huge amount of surplus weapons becoming available in what is known as the international grey market for weapons. The OSCE helps to stop the—often illegal—spread of such weapons and offers assistance with their destruction. The OSCE hosts the annual exchange of information under the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty. The OSCE has also implemented two additional exchanges of information, the Vienna Document and the Global Exchange of Military Information. The Open Skies Consultative Commission, the implementing body for the Treaty on Open Skies, meets monthly at its Vienna headquarters.

; Border management
The actions taken by the OSCE in border monitoring range from conflict prevention to post-conflict management, capacity building and institutional support.

; Combating terrorism
With its expertise in conflict prevention, crisis management and early warning, the OSCE contributes to worldwide efforts in combating terrorism.

; Conflict prevention
The OSCE works to prevent conflicts from arising and to facilitate lasting comprehensive political settlements for existing conflicts. It also helps with the process of rehabilitation in post-conflict areas.

; Military reform
The OSCE&#x27;s Forum for Security Co-operation provides a framework for political dialogue on military reform, while practical activities are conducted by field operations, as well as the Conflict Prevention Centre.

; Policing
OSCE police operations are an integral part of the organization&#x27;s efforts in conflict prevention and post-conflict rehabilitation.

; Implementation
The OSCE was a rather small organization until selection by the international community to provide electoral organization to post war Bosnia and Herzegovina in early 1996. Ambassador Frowick was the first OSCE representative to initiate national election in September 1996, human rights issues and rule of law specifically designed to provide a foundation for judicial organization within Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The OSCE had regional offices and field offices, to include the office in Brcko in northeastern Bosnia and Herzegovina which remained in limbo until the Brcko Arbitration Agreement could be decided, finalized and implemented.

Brcko become a &quot;special district&quot; and remains so today.

The OSCE essentially took the place of the United Nations in Bosnia and Herzegovina in part because the Bosnian leadership felt deep contempt for the UN efforts to stop the war which began in 1991 and ended in 1995. During the time the United Nations were attempting a political solution, thousands of UN troops were posted in and around Bosnia and Herzegovina with special emphasis on Sarajevo. From 1991 to 1995, over 200,000 Bosnians were killed and over one million displaced and another million as refugees.

The OSCE continues to have a presence and a number of initiatives to bring a sustained peace to the region.

=== Economic and environmental dimension (second dimension) ===

Activities in the economic and environmental dimension include the monitoring of developments related to economic and environmental security in OSCE participating States, with the aim of alerting them to any threat of conflict; assisting States in the creation of economic and environmental policies, legislation and institutions to promote security in the OSCE region.

; Economic activities
Among the economic activities of the OSCE feature activities related to migration management, transport and energy security. Most activities are implemented in co-operation with partner organizations.

; Environmental activities
The OSCE has developed a range of activities in the environmental sphere aimed at addressing ecologic threats to security in its participating States. Among the activities feature projects in the area of hazardous waste, water management and access to information under the Aarhus Convention.

=== Human dimension (third dimension) ===
The commitments made by OSCE participating States in the human dimension aim to ensure full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms; to abide by the rule of law; to promote the principles of democracy by building, strengthening and protecting democratic institutions; and to promote tolerance throughout the OSCE region.

; Combating trafficking in human beings
Since 2003, the OSCE has had an established mechanism for combating trafficking in human beings, as defined by Article 3 of the Palermo Protocol, which is aimed at raising public awareness of the problem and building the political will within participating states to tackle it effectively.

The OSCE actions against trafficking in human beings are coordinated by the Office of the Special Representative and Co-ordinator for Combating Trafficking in Human Beings. Maria Grazia Giammarinaro, a judge in the Criminal Court of Rome, took Office as the Special Representative in March 2010. From 2006 to 2009, this Office was held by Eva Biaudet, a former Finnish Minister of Health and Social Services. Biaudet currently serves as Finnish Ombudsman for Minorities. Her predecessor was former Austrian Minister Helga Konrad, who served as the first OSCE Special Representative for Combating Trafficking in Human Beings.

The activities around Combating Trafficking in Human Beings in the OSCE Region of the Office of the Special Representative include:
* Co-operation with governments, helping them to accept and act on their responsibilities for curbing trafficking in human beings;
* Providing governments with decision and policy-making aids and offering guidance on anti-trafficking management, with the aim of arriving at solutions tailored to the needs of the individual countries and in line with international standards;
* Assisting governments to develop the national anti-trafficking structures required for efficient internal and transnational co-operation;
* Raising awareness to draw attention to the complexity of the problem and to the need for comprehensive solutions;
* Considering all dimensions of human trafficking, namely trafficking for sexual exploitation, trafficking for forced and bonded labour, including domestic servitude, trafficking into forced marriages, trafficking in organs and trafficking in children;
* Ensuring the effective interaction of all agents and stake holders involved in the fight against human trafficking, ranging from governmental authorities, law enforcement officials to NGOs, and—last but not least—international organizations, as the agencies providing support thorough expertise and know-how;
* Guaranteeing the highest possible visibility of the OSCE&#x27;s fight against human trafficking to focus attention on the issue.

; Democratization
The OSCE claims to promote democracy and assist the participating states in building democratic institutions.

; Education
Education programmes are an integral part of the organization&#x27;s efforts in conflict prevention and post-conflict rehabilitation.

; Elections
As part of its democratization activities, the OSCE carries out election assistance projects in the run-up to, during, and following elections. However, the effectiveness of such assistance is arguable—Kazakhstan, for example, despite being the former chair of the OSCE, is considered by many to be one of the least democratic countries in the world. Moreover, the recent democratic advances made in other Central Asian republics, notably Kyrgyzstan, have led to rumours of Soviet-style disruption of the Kyrgyz democratic process by, in particular, Kazakhstan and Russia. This may be in large part due to fears over the long-term stability of these countries&#x27; own quasi-dictatorships.

; Gender equality
The equality of men and women is an integral part of sustainable democracy. The OSCE aims to provide equal opportunities for men and women and to integrate gender equality in policies and practices.

; Human rights
The OSCE&#x27;s human rights activities focus on such priorities as freedom of movement and religion, preventing torture and trafficking in persons.

; National and international NGOs
OSCE could grant consultive status to NGOs and INGOs in the form of &quot;Researcher-in-residence programme&quot; (run by the Prague Office of the OSCE Secretariat): accredited representatives of national and international NGOs are granted access to all records and to numerous topical compilations related to OSCE field activities.

; Media freedom
The OSCE observes relevant media developments in its participating states with a view to addressing and providing early warning on violations of freedom of expression.

; Minority rights
Ethnic conflict is one of the main sources of large-scale violence in Europe today. The OSCE&#x27;s approach is to identify and to seek early resolution of ethnic tensions, and to set standards for the rights of persons belonging to minority groups and High Commissioner on National Minorities has been established.

== OSCE Democracy Defender Award ==
The Democracy Defender Award honors a person or group for contributions to the promotion of democracy and the defense of human rights &quot;in the spirit of Helsinki Final Act and other OSCE principles and commitments.&quot; The award was established in 2016 on the initiative of Ambassadors of 8 countries, and supported by the delegations of the 18 countries of the OSCE (22 countries in 2017).

<text>Omri ( ; , &quot;‘Omrī&quot;; &quot;Ḫûmrî&quot; [&quot;ḫu-um-ri-i&quot;]; fl. 9th century BCE) was, according to the Hebrew Bible, the sixth king of Israel. He was a successful military campaigner who extended the northern kingdom of Israel. Other monarchs from the House of Omri are Ahab, Ahaziah, Joram, and Athaliah. Like his predecessor, king Zimri, who ruled for only seven days, Omri is the second king mentioned in the Bible without a statement of his tribal origin. One possibility, though unproven, is that he was of the tribe of Issachar.

Nothing is said in Scripture about the lineage of Omri. His name may be Amorite, Arabic, or Hebrew in origin. Omri is credited with the construction of Samaria and establishing it as his capital. Although the Bible is silent about other actions taken during his reign, he is described as doing more evil than all the kings who preceded him. An alternative modern hypothesis maintains that, as founder of the House of Omri, an Israelite royal house, his kingdom formed the first state in the Land of Israel, and that the Kingdom of Judah only achieved statehood later.

Extrabiblical sources such as the Mesha Stele and the Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III also mention his name; however, in the case of the Black Obelisk the reference is to the dynasty named for Omri rather than to Omri himself.

== Name ==
The name &quot;Omri&quot; itself is puzzling to scholars. Its etymology is uncertain, and theories have proposed an origin in several Semitic languages. In the Hebrew Bible, the name &quot;Omri&quot; appears three times outside of references to the king, first to denote a son of Becher, the second of Benjamin&#x27;s ten sons, second to denote a descendant of Perez, son of Judah, and finally to denote a prince of the tribe of Issachar, seemingly suggesting an Israelite origin for the name. Likewise, that Jezreel was the site of Omri&#x27;s estate has been taken by some scholars as indicating that Omri had called the area home, which may imply he was a scion of the tribe of Issachar, but this remains unproven. If Omri, and by extension his name, were indeed of Israelite provenance, a number of Hebrew etymologies have been proposed for &quot;‘Omrī&quot;: including a hypocorism of the unattested personal name &quot;‘Omrīyyā&quot; ( &quot;servant of Yah&quot;), and derivation from the verb &quot;‘āmar&quot; () meaning &quot;to bind, gather&quot;.

== Reign ==
=== Struggle for the succession ===
According to the biblical narrative, Omri was &quot;commander of the army&quot; of King Elah when Zimri, &quot;commander of half the king&#x27;s chariots&quot;, murdered Elah and made himself king. Instead, the troops at Gibbethon chose Omri as king, and he led them to Tirzah where they besieged it. When Zimri saw that the city was taken, he committed suicide by shutting himself in the royal palace and setting it ablaze. He died after a reign of only seven days. Although Zimri was eliminated, &quot;half of the people&quot; supported Tibni in opposition to Omri. It took Omri four years to subdue Tibni and at last proclaim himself undisputed king of Israel.

=== Samaria and successor ===
Initially, the capital was in Tirzah, which had been besieged and the royal palace had been burned down. The Jewish Encyclopedia suggests that &quot;the associations of Tirzah were so repellent and sanguinary, and the location so poor for a capital, that Omri purchased a new site&quot; for his residence. This was in Samaria, on a hill purchased from Shemer for two talents of silver, where Omri built a new capital for the kingdom. In Samaria, Omri reigned until his death and was buried there. His son Ahab became the next king.

== Date ==
Omri became king of Israel in the 31st year of Asa, king of Judah and reigned for 12 years, 6 years of which were in Tirzah. The biblical reference to the period of rivalry with Tibni is from the 27th year of Asa to the 31st year. There are several possible dates: William F. Albright has dated his reign to 876–869 BCE, E. R. Thiele offers the dates of 888 BCE to 880 BCE for his rivalry with Tibni and 880–874 BCE for his sole reign, while Paul L. Maier affirms that it happened between 881–873 BCE.

== Archaeological sources ==
The fortress at Jezreel was situated on one of the main east–west routes through the kingdom. Hugh Williamson believes it served not only a military function, but also a political one; a very visible example of grandiose public works used as a means of social control and to assert claims of legitimacy.

The Moabite Mesha stele (on display in the Louvre) indicates that Omri expanded his holdings to include northern Moab east of the Jordan River. It makes reference to the oppression of Moab by &quot;Omri King of Israel&quot;. Israel would later become identified in sources as the &quot;House of Omri&quot; (&quot;Bit-Humria&quot;), with the term &quot;Israel&quot; being used less and less as history progressed (the other defining term for &quot;Israel&quot; is &quot;Samaria&quot;, beginning in the reign of Joash)..
The Assyrian Black Obelisk in the British Museum has been interpreted as referring to Jehu &quot;son of Omri&quot;, though that interpretation has been questioned, in favor of the reading &quot;Omride&quot;.

== The Omride Dynasty ==
The short-lived dynasty founded by Omri constituted a new chapter in the history of the Northern Kingdom of Israel. It ended almost fifty years of constant civil war over the throne. There was peace with the Kingdom of Judah to the south, and even cooperation between the two rival states, while relations with neighboring Sidon to the north were bolstered by marriages negotiated between the two royal courts. This state of peace with two powerful neighbors enabled the Kingdom of Israel to expand its influence and even political control in Transjordan, and these factors combined brought economic prosperity to the kingdom.

On the other hand, peace with Sidon also resulted in the penetration of Phoenician religious ideas into the kingdom and led to a &quot;kulturkampf&quot; between traditionalists (as personified by the prophet Elijah and his followers) and the aristocracy (as personified by Omri&#x27;s son and heir Ahab and his consort Jezebel). In foreign affairs, this period paralleled the rise of the Kingdom of Aram based in Damascus, and Israel soon found itself at war in the northeast. Most threatening, however, was the ascendancy of Assyria, which was beginning to expand westward from Mesopotamia: the Battle of Qarqar (853 BCE), which pitted Shalmaneser III of Assyria against a coalition of local kings, including Ahab, was the first clash between Assyria and Israel. It was the first in a series of wars that would eventually lead to the destruction of the Kingdom of Israel in 722 BCE and the reduction of the Kingdom of Judah to an Assyrian tributary state.

In 841 BCE, the Assyrian king Shalmaneser III campaigned along the Mediterranean coast and forced Jehu to pay tribute. Assyrian kings frequently referred to Omri&#x27;s successors as belonging to the &quot;House of Omri&quot; (&quot;Bit Hu-um-ri-a&quot;).

<text>Oxycodone, sold under the brand name Roxicodone and OxyContin (which is the extended-release form) among others, is a semi-synthetic opioid used medically for the treatment of moderate to severe pain. It is highly addictive and is a commonly abused drug. It is usually taken by mouth, and is available in immediate-release and controlled-release formulations. Onset of pain relief typically begins within fifteen minutes and lasts for up to six hours with the immediate-release formulation. In the United Kingdom, it is available by injection. Combination products are also available with paracetamol (acetaminophen), ibuprofen, naloxone, naltrexone, and aspirin.
Common side effects include euphoria, constipation, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, drowsiness, dizziness, itching, dry mouth, and sweating. Side effects may also include addiction and dependence, substance abuse, irritability, depression or mania, delirium, hallucinations, hypoventilation, gastroparesis, bradycardia, and hypotension. Those allergic to codeine may also be allergic to oxycodone. Use of oxycodone in early pregnancy appears relatively safe. Opioid withdrawal may occur if rapidly stopped. Oxycodone acts by activating the μ-opioid receptor. When taken by mouth, it has roughly 1.5 times the effect of the equivalent amount of morphine.
Oxycodone was originally produced from the opium poppy opiate alkaloid thebaine in 1916 in Germany. One year later, it was used medically for the first time in Germany in 1917. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 60th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 11million prescriptions. A number of abuse-deterrent formulations are available, such as in combination with naloxone or naltrexone.
==Medical uses==
Oxycodone is used for managing moderate to severe acute or chronic pain when other treatments are not sufficient. It may improve quality of life in certain types of pain. Numerous studies have been completed, and the appropriate use of this compound does improve the quality of life of patients with long term chronic pain syndromes.

Oxycodone is available as a controlled-release tablet. A 2006 review found that controlled-release oxycodone is comparable to immediate-release oxycodone, morphine, and hydromorphone in management of moderate to severe cancer pain, with fewer side effects than morphine. The author concluded that the controlled-release form is a valid alternative to morphine and a first-line treatment for cancer pain. In 2014, the European Association for Palliative Care recommended oxycodone by mouth as a second-line alternative to morphine by mouth for cancer pain.

In children between 11 and 16, the extended-release formulation is FDA-approved for the relief of cancer pain, trauma pain, or pain due to major surgery (for those already treated with opioids, who can tolerate at least 20 mg per day of oxycodone) – this provides an alternative to Duragesic (fentanyl), the only other extended-release opioid analgesic approved for children.

Oxycodone, in its extended-release form and/or in combination with naloxone, is sometimes used off-label in the treatment of severe and refractory restless legs syndrome.

===Available forms===

Oxycodone is available in a variety of formulations for by mouth or under the tongue:

* Immediate-release oxycodone (OxyFast, OxyIR, OxyNorm, Roxicodone)
* Controlled-release oxycodone (OxyContin, Xtampza ER) – 10–12 hour duration
* Oxycodone tamper-resistant (OxyContin OTR)
* Immediate-release oxycodone with paracetamol (acetaminophen) (Percocet, Endocet, Roxicet, Tylox)
* Immediate-release oxycodone with aspirin (Endodan, Oxycodan, Percodan, Roxiprin)
* Immediate-release oxycodone with ibuprofen (Combunox)
* Controlled-release oxycodone with naloxone (Targin, Targiniq, Targinact) – 10–12 hour duration
* Controlled-release oxycodone with naltrexone (Troxyca) – 10–12 hour duration

In the US, oxycodone is only approved for use by mouth, available as tablets and oral solutions. Parenteral formulations of oxycodone (brand name OxyNorm) are also available in other parts of the world, however, and are widely used in the European Union. In Spain, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, oxycodone is approved for intravenous (IV) and intramuscular (IM) use. When first introduced in Germany during World War I, both IV and IM administrations of oxycodone were commonly used for postoperative pain management of Central Powers soldiers.

==Side effects==

The most common side effects of oxycodone include reduced sensitivity to pain, delayed gastric emptying, euphoria, anxiolysis (a reduction in anxiety), feelings of relaxation, and respiratory depression. Common side effects of oxycodone include constipation (23%), nausea (23%), vomiting (12%), somnolence (23%), dizziness (13%), itching (13%), dry mouth (6%), and sweating (5%). Less common side effects (experienced by less than 5% of patients) include loss of appetite, nervousness, abdominal pain, diarrhea, urinary retention, dyspnea, and hiccups.

Most side effects generally become less intense over time, although issues related to constipation are likely to continue for the duration of use. Chronic use of this compound and associated constipation issues can become very serious, and have been implicated in life-threatening bowel perforations, a number of specific medications including naloxegol have been developed to address opioid induced constipation.

Oxycodone in combination with naloxone in managed-release tablets has been formulated to both deter abuse and reduce opioid-induced constipation.

===Dependence and withdrawal===
The risk of experiencing severe withdrawal symptoms is high if a patient has become physically dependent and discontinues oxycodone abruptly. Medically, when the drug has been taken regularly over an extended period, it is withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly. People who regularly use oxycodone recreationally or at higher than prescribed doses are at even higher risk of severe withdrawal symptoms. The symptoms of oxycodone withdrawal, as with other opioids, may include &quot;anxiety, panic attack, nausea, insomnia, muscle pain, muscle weakness, fevers, and other flu-like symptoms&quot;.

Withdrawal symptoms have also been reported in newborns whose mothers had been either injecting or orally taking oxycodone during pregnancy.

===Hormone levels===
As with other opioids, chronic use of oxycodone (particularly with higher doses) can often cause concurrent hypogonadism (low sex hormone levels).

==Overdose==
In high doses, overdoses, or in some persons not tolerant to opioids, oxycodone can cause shallow breathing, slowed heart rate, cold/clammy skin, pauses in breathing, low blood pressure, constricted pupils, circulatory collapse, respiratory arrest, and death.

In 2011, it was the leading cause of drug-related deaths in the U.S. However, from 2012 onwards, heroin and fentanyl have become more common causes of drug-related deaths.

Oxycodone overdose has also been described to cause spinal cord infarction in high doses and ischemic damage to the brain, due to prolonged hypoxia from suppressed breathing.

== Interactions ==

Oxycodone is metabolized by the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Therefore, its clearance can be altered by inhibitors and inducers of these enzymes, increasing and decreasing half-life, respectively. (For lists of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors and inducers, see here and here, respectively.) Natural genetic variation in these enzymes can also influence the clearance of oxycodone, which may be related to the wide inter-individual variability in its half-life and potency.

Ritonavir or lopinavir/ritonavir greatly increase plasma concentrations of oxycodone in healthy human volunteers due to inhibition of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Rifampicin greatly reduces plasma concentrations of oxycodone due to strong induction of CYP3A4. There is also a case report of fosphenytoin, a CYP3A4 inducer, dramatically reducing the analgesic effects of oxycodone in a chronic pain patient. Dosage or medication adjustments may be necessary in each case.

==Pharmacology==
===Pharmacodynamics===

Oxycodone, a semi-synthetic opioid, is a highly selective full agonist of the μ-opioid receptor (MOR). This is the main biological target of the endogenous opioid neuropeptide β-endorphin. Oxycodone has low affinity for the δ-opioid receptor (DOR) and the κ-opioid receptor (KOR), where it is an agonist similarly. After oxycodone binds to the MOR, a G protein-complex is released, which inhibits the release of neurotransmitters by the cell by decreasing the amount of cAMP produced, closing calcium channels, and opening potassium channels. Opioids like oxycodone are thought to produce their analgesic effects via activation of the MOR in the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) and rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM). Conversely, they are thought to produce reward and addiction via activation of the MOR in the mesolimbic reward pathway, including in the ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens, and ventral pallidum. Tolerance to the analgesic and rewarding effects of opioids is complex and occurs due to receptor-level tolerance (e.g., MOR downregulation), cellular-level tolerance (e.g., cAMP upregulation), and system-level tolerance (e.g., neural adaptation due to induction of ΔFosB expression).

Taken orally, 20 mg of immediate-release oxycodone is considered to be equivalent in analgesic effect to 30 mg of morphine, while extended release oxycodone is considered to be twice as potent as oral morphine.

Similarly to most other opioids, oxycodone increases prolactin secretion, but its influence on testosterone levels is unknown. Unlike morphine, oxycodone lacks immunosuppressive activity (measured by natural killer cell activity and interleukin 2 production &quot;in vitro&quot;); the clinical relevance of this has not been clarified.

====Active metabolites====
A few of the metabolites of oxycodone have also been found to be active as MOR agonists, some of which notably have much higher affinity for (as well as higher efficacy at) the MOR in comparison. Oxymorphone possesses 3- to 5-fold higher affinity for the MOR than does oxycodone, while noroxycodone and noroxymorphone possess one-third of and 3-fold higher affinity for the MOR, respectively, and MOR activation is 5- to 10-fold less with noroxycodone but 2-fold higher with noroxymorphone relative to oxycodone. Noroxycodone, noroxymorphone, and oxymorphone also have longer biological half-lives than oxycodone.

However, despite the greater &quot;in vitro&quot; activity of some of its metabolites, it has been determined that oxycodone itself is responsible for 83.0% and 94.8% of its analgesic effect following oral and intravenous administration, respectively. Oxymorphone plays only a minor role, being responsible for 15.8% and 4.5% of the analgesic effect of oxycodone after oral and intravenous administration, respectively. Although the CYP2D6 genotype and the route of administration result in differential rates of oxymorphone formation, the unchanged parent compound remains the major contributor to the overall analgesic effect of oxycodone. In contrast to oxycodone and oxymorphone, noroxycodone and noroxymorphone, while also potent MOR agonists, poorly cross the blood–brain barrier into the central nervous system, and for this reason are only minimally analgesic in comparison.

====κ-opioid receptor====
In 1997, a group of Australian researchers proposed (based on a study in rats) that oxycodone acts on KORs, unlike morphine, which acts upon MORs. Further research by this group indicated the drug appears to be a high-affinity κ2b-opioid receptor agonist. However, this conclusion has been disputed, primarily on the basis that oxycodone produces effects that are typical of MOR agonists. In 2006, research by a Japanese group suggested the effect of oxycodone is mediated by different receptors in different situations. Specifically in diabetic mice, the KOR appears to be involved in the antinociceptive effects of oxycodone, while in nondiabetic mice, the μ1-opioid receptor seems to be primarily responsible for these effects.

===Pharmacokinetics===

====Instant-release absorption profiles and Tmax====
Oxycodone can be administered orally, intravenously, via intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous injection. Along with rectal, sublingual, buccal or intranasal drug delivery. The bioavailability of oral administration of oxycodone averages within a range of 60 to 87%, with rectal administration yielding the same results; Intranasal administration of oxycodone has a bioavailability of ~77%, the same half life as oral oxycodone, along with faster Tmax previously reported as 47% for nasal spray administration due to the solution in the study exceeding the 0.3- to 0.4-mL nasal mucosa limit. Buccal bioavailability ~55%, Tmax ~60 min. Sublingual bioavailability 20% (non alkalized) ~55% (alkalized) Tmax ~60 minutes.

After a dose of conventional (immediate-release) oral oxycodone, the onset of action is 10 to 30 minutes, and peak plasma levels of the drug are attained within roughly 30 to 60 minutes; in contrast, after a dose of OxyContin (an oral controlled-release formulation), peak plasma levels of oxycodone occur in about three hours. The duration of instant-release oxycodone is 3 to 6 hours, although this can be variable depending on the individual.

====Distribution====
Oxycodone has a volume of distribution of 2.6L/kg, in the blood it is distributed to skeletal muscle, liver, intestinal tract, lungs, spleen, and brain. At equilibrium the unbound concentration in the brain is threefold higher than the unbound concentration in blood. Conventional oral preparations start to reduce pain within 10 to 15 minutes on an empty stomach; in contrast, OxyContin starts to reduce pain within one hour.

====Metabolism====
The metabolism of oxycodone in humans occurs in the liver mainly via the cytochrome P450 system and is extensive (about 95%) and complex, with many minor pathways and resulting metabolites. Around 10% (range 8–14%) of a dose of oxycodone is excreted essentially unchanged (unconjugated or conjugated) in the urine. The major metabolites of oxycodone are noroxycodone (70%), noroxymorphone (&quot;relatively high concentrations&quot;), and oxymorphone (5%). The immediate metabolism of oxycodone in humans is as follows:

* N-Demethylation to noroxycodone predominantly via CYP3A4
* O-Demethylation to oxymorphone predominantly via CYP2D6
* 6- to 6α- and 6β-oxycodol
* N-Oxidation to oxycodone-N-oxide

In humans, N-demethylation of oxycodone to noroxycodone by CYP3A4 is the major metabolic pathway, accounting for 45% ± 21% of a dose of oxycodone, while O-demethylation of oxycodone into oxymorphone by CYP2D6 and 6-ketoreduction of oxycodone into 6-oxycodols represent relatively minor metabolic pathways, accounting for 11% ± 6% and 8% ± 6% of a dose of oxycodone, respectively.

Several of the immediate metabolites of oxycodone are subsequently conjugated with glucuronic acid and excreted in the urine. 6α-Oxycodol and 6β-oxycodol are further metabolized by N-demethylation to nor-6α-oxycodol and nor-6β-oxycodol, respectively, and by N-oxidation to 6α-oxycodol-N-oxide and 6β-oxycodol-N-oxide (which can subsequently be glucuronidated as well). Oxymorphone is also further metabolized, as follows:

* 3-Glucuronidation to oxymorphone-3-glucuronide predominantly via UGT2B7
* 6-Ketoreduction to 6α-oxymorphol and 6β-oxymorphol
* N-Demethylation to noroxymorphone

The first pathway of the above three accounts for 40% of the metabolism of oxymorphone, making oxymorphone-3-glucuronide the main metabolite of oxymorphone, while the latter two pathways account for less than 10% of the metabolism of oxymorphone. After N-demethylation of oxymorphone, noroxymorphone is further glucuronidated to noroxymorphone-3-glucuronide.

Because oxycodone is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system in the liver, its pharmacokinetics can be influenced by genetic polymorphisms and drug interactions concerning this system, as well as by liver function. Some people are fast metabolizers of oxycodone, while others are slow metabolizers, resulting in polymorphism-dependent alterations in relative analgesia and toxicity. While higher CYP2D6 activity increases the effects of oxycodone (owing to increased conversion into oxymorphone), higher CYP3A4 activity has the opposite effect and decreases the effects of oxycodone (owing to increased metabolism into noroxycodone and noroxymorphone). The dose of oxycodone must be reduced in patients with reduced liver function.

====Elimination====
The clearance of oxycodone is 0.8 L/min. Oxycodone and its metabolites are mainly excreted in urine. Therefore, oxycodone accumulates in patients with kidney impairment. Oxycodone is eliminated in the urine 10% as unchanged oxycodone, 45% ± 21% as &quot;N&quot;-demethylated metabolites (noroxycodone, noroxymorphone, noroxycodols), 11 ± 6% as &quot;O&quot;-demethylated metabolites (oxymorphone, oxymorphols), and 8% ± 6% as 6-keto-reduced metabolites (oxycodols).

====Duration of action====
Oral oxycodone has a half-life of 4.5 hours. It is available as a generic medication. The manufacturer of OxyContin, a controlled-release preparation of oxycodone, Purdue Pharma, claimed in their 1992 patent application that the duration of action of OxyContin is 12 hours in &quot;90% of patients&quot;. It has never performed any clinical studies in which OxyContin was given at more frequent intervals. In a separate filing, Purdue claims that controlled-release oxycodone &quot;provides pain relief in said patient for at least 12 hours after administration&quot;. However, in 2016 an investigation by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; found that &quot;the drug wears off hours early in many people&quot;, inducing symptoms of opiate withdrawal and intense cravings for OxyContin. One doctor, Lawrence Robbins, told journalists that over 70% of his patients would report that OxyContin would only provide 4–7 hours of relief. Doctors in the 1990s often would switch their patients to a dosing schedule of once every eight hours when they complained that the duration of action for OxyContin was too short to be taken only twice a day. Mean serum concentration of controlled-release oxycodone peaks at 78 ng/ml at 1 hour and drops to 20 ng/ml at 8 hours and under 10 ng/ml at 12 hours.

Purdue strongly discouraged the practice: Purdue&#x27;s medical director Robert Reder wrote to one doctor in 1995 that &quot;OxyContin has been developed for [12-hour] dosing...I request that you not use a [8-hourly] dosing regimen.&quot; Purdue repeatedly released memos to its sales representatives ordering them to remind doctors not to deviate from a 12-hour dosing schedule. One such memo read, &quot;There is no Q8 dosing with OxyContin... [8-hour dosing] needs to be nipped in the bud. NOW!!&quot; The journalists who covered the investigation argued that Purdue Pharma has insisted on a 12-hour duration of action for nearly all patients, despite evidence to the contrary, to protect the reputation of OxyContin as a 12-hour drug and the willingness of health insurance and managed care companies to cover OxyContin despite its high cost relative to generic opiates such as morphine.

Purdue sales representatives were instructed to encourage doctors to write prescriptions for larger 12-hour doses instead of more frequent dosing. An August 1996 memo to Purdue sales representatives in Tennessee entitled &quot;$$$$$$$$$$$$$ It&#x27;s Bonus Time in the Neighborhood!&quot; reminded the representatives that their commissions would dramatically increase if they were successful in convincing doctors to prescribe larger doses. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; journalists argue using interviews from opioid addiction experts that such high doses of OxyContin spaced 12 hours apart create a combination of agony during opiate withdrawal (lower lows) and a schedule of reinforcement that relieves this agony fostering addiction.

As of 2024, the prescribing information for OxyContin still specifies a 12-hour dosing schedule as the only option; it also states, &quot;there are no well-controlled clinical studies evaluating the safety and efficacy with dosing more frequently than every 12 hours.&quot;

==Chemistry==
Oxycodone&#x27;s chemical name is derived from codeine. The chemical structures are very similar, differing only in that

* Oxycodone has a hydroxy group at carbon-14 (codeine has just a hydrogen in its place)
* Oxycodone has a 7,8-dihydro feature. Codeine has a double bond between those two carbons; and
* Oxycodone has a carbonyl group (as in ketones) in place of the hydroxyl group of codeine.

It is also similar to hydrocodone, differing only in that it has a hydroxyl group at carbon-14.

===Biosynthesis===
In terms of biosynthesis, oxycodone has been found naturally in nectar extracts from the orchid family &quot;Epipactis helleborine&quot;; together along with another opioid: 3-{2-{3-{3-benzyloxypropyl}-3-indol, 7,8-didehydro- 4,5-epoxy-3,6-d-morphinan.

Thodey &quot;et al.&quot;, 2014 introduce a microbial compound manufacturing system for compounds including oxycodone. The Thodey platform produces both natural and semisynthetic opioids including this one. This system uses &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; with transgenes from &quot;Papaver somniferum&quot; (the opium poppy) and &quot;Pseudomonas putida&quot; to turn a thebaine input into other opiates and opioids.

===Detection in biological fluids===
Oxycodone and/or its major metabolites may be measured in blood or urine to monitor for clearance, non-medical use, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning, or assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Many commercial opiate screening tests cross-react appreciably with oxycodone and its metabolites, but chromatographic techniques can easily distinguish oxycodone from other opiates.

==History==
Martin Freund and (Jakob) Edmund Speyer of the University of Frankfurt in Germany published the first synthesis of oxycodone from thebaine in 1916. When Freund died, in 1920, Speyer wrote his obituary for the German Chemical Society. Speyer, born to a Jewish family in Frankfurt am Main in 1878, became a victim of the Holocaust. He died on 5 May 1942, the second day of deportations from the Lodz Ghetto; his death was noted in the ghetto&#x27;s chronicle.

The first clinical use of the drug was documented in 1917, the year after it was first developed. It was first introduced to the U.S. market in May 1939. In early 1928, Merck introduced a combination product containing scopolamine, oxycodone, and ephedrine under the German initials for the ingredients SEE, which was later renamed Scophedal (SCOpolamine, ePHEDrine, and eukodAL) in 1942. It was last manufactured in 1987 but can be compounded. This combination is essentially an oxycodone analogue of the morphine-based &quot;twilight sleep&quot;, with ephedrine added to reduce circulatory and respiratory effects. The drug became known as the &quot;Miracle Drug of the 1930s&quot; in Continental Europe and elsewhere and it was the Wehrmacht&#x27;s choice for a battlefield analgesic for a time. The drug was expressly designed to provide what the patent application and package insert referred to as &quot;very deep analgesia and profound and intense euphoria&quot; as well as tranquillisation and anterograde amnesia useful for surgery and battlefield wounding cases. Oxycodone was allegedly chosen over other common opiates for this product because it had been shown to produce less sedation at equianalgesic doses compared to morphine, hydromorphone (Dilaudid), and hydrocodone (Dicodid).

During Operation Himmler, Skophedal was also reportedly injected in massive overdose into the prisoners dressed in Polish Army uniforms in the staged incident on 1 September 1939 which opened the Second World War.

The personal notes of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s physician, Theodor Morell, indicate Hitler received repeated injections of &quot;Eukodal&quot; (oxycodone; produced by Merck) and Scophedal, as well as Dolantin (pethidine) codeine, and morphine less frequently; oxycodone could not be obtained after late January 1945.

In the United States, the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) was passed by the United States Congress and signed into law by President Richard Nixon on 27 October 1970. The passing of the CSA resulted in all products containing oxycodone being classified as a Schedule II controlled substance.

Purdue Pharma, a privately held company based in Stamford, Connecticut, developed the prescription painkiller OxyContin. It was approved by the FDA in 1995 after no long-term studies and no assessment of its addictive capabilities. David Kessler, FDA commissioner at the time, later said of the approval of OxyContin: &quot;No doubt it was a mistake. It was certainly one of the worst medical mistakes, a major mistake.&quot; Upon its release in 1995, OxyContin was hailed as a medical breakthrough, a long-lasting narcotic that could help patients with moderate to severe pain. The drug became a blockbuster and has reportedly generated some US$35 billion in revenue for Purdue.

== Society and culture ==
===Opioid epidemic===
Oxycodone, like other opioid analgesics, tends to induce feelings of euphoria, relaxation, and reduced anxiety in those who are occasional users. These effects make it one of the most commonly abused pharmaceutical drugs in the United States. The abuse of Oxycodone, as well as related opioids more broadly, is not unique to the United States and is a common drug of abuse globally.

====United States====
Oxycodone is the most widely recreationally used opioid in America. In the United States, more than 12 million people use opioid drugs recreationally. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services estimates that about 11 million people in the U.S. consume oxycodone in a non-medical way annually.

Opioids were responsible for 49,000 of the 72,000 drug overdose deaths in the U.S. in 2017. In 2007, about 42,800 emergency room visits occurred due to &quot;episodes&quot; involving oxycodone. In 2008, recreational use of oxycodone and hydrocodone was involved in 14,800 deaths. Some of the cases were due to overdoses of the acetaminophen component, resulting in fatal liver damage.

In September 2013, the FDA released new labeling guidelines for long-acting and extended-release opioids requiring manufacturers to remove moderate pain as an indication for use, instead stating the drug is for &quot;pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long term opioid treatment&quot;. The updated labeling will not restrict physicians from prescribing opioids for moderate pain, as needed.

Reformulated OxyContin is causing some recreational users to change to heroin, which is cheaper and easier to obtain.

=====Lawsuits=====
In October 2017, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; published a story on Mortimer Sackler and Purdue Pharma regarding their ties to the production and manipulation of the oxycodone markets. The article links Raymond and Arthur Sackler&#x27;s business practices with the rise of direct pharmaceutical marketing and eventually to the rise of addiction to oxycodone in the United States. The article implies that the Sackler family bears some responsibility for the opioid epidemic in the United States. In 2019, &quot;The New York Times&quot; ran a piece confirming that Richard Sackler, the son of Raymond Sackler, told company officials in 2008 to &quot;measure our performance by Rx&#x27;s by strength, giving higher measures to higher strengths&quot;. This was verified with documents tied to a lawsuit – which was filed by the Massachusetts attorney general, Maura Healey – claiming that Purdue Pharma and members of the Sackler family knew that high doses of OxyContin over long periods would increase the risk of serious side effects, including addiction. Despite Purdue Pharma&#x27;s proposal for a US$12 billion settlement of the lawsuit, the attorneys general of 23 states, including Massachusetts, rejected the settlement offer in September 2019.

====Australia====
The non-medical use of oxycodone existed since the early 1970s, but by 2015, 91% of a national sample of injecting drug users in Australia had reported using oxycodone, and 27% had injected it in the last six months.

====Canada====
Opioid-related deaths in Ontario had increased by 242% from 1969 to 2014. By 2009 in Ontario there were more deaths from oxycodone overdoses than from cocaine overdoses. Deaths from opioid pain relievers had increased from 13.7 deaths per million residents in 1991 to 27.2 deaths per million residents in 2004. The non-medical use of oxycodone in Canada became a problem. Areas where oxycodone is most problematic are Atlantic Canada and Ontario, where its non-medical use is prevalent in rural towns and in many smaller to medium-sized cities. Oxycodone is also widely available across Western Canada, but methamphetamine and heroin are more serious problems in larger cities, while oxycodone is more common in rural towns. Oxycodone is diverted through doctor shopping, prescription forgery, pharmacy theft, and overprescription.

The recent formulations of oxycodone, particularly Purdue Pharma&#x27;s crush-, chew-, injection- and dissolve-resistant OxyNEO which replaced the banned OxyContin product in Canada in early 2012, have led to a decline in the recreational use of this opiate but have increased the recreational use of the more potent drug fentanyl. According to a Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse study quoted in Maclean&#x27;s magazine, there were at least 655 fentanyl-related deaths in Canada in five years.

In Alberta, the Blood Tribe police claimed that from the fall of 2014 through January 2015, oxycodone pills or a lethal fake variation referred to as Oxy 80s containing fentanyl made in illegal labs by members of organized crime were responsible for ten deaths on the Blood Reserve, which is located southwest of Lethbridge, Alberta. Province-wide, approximately 120 Albertans died from fentanyl-related overdoses in 2014.

====United Kingdom====
Prescriptions of Oxycodone rose in Scotland by 430% between 2002 and 2008, prompting fears of usage problems that would mirror those of the United States. The first known death due to overdose in the UK occurred in 2002.

====Preventive measures====
In August 2010, Purdue Pharma reformulated their long-acting oxycodone line, marketed as OxyContin, using a polymer, Intac, to make the pills more difficult to crush or dissolve in water to reduce non-medical use of OxyContin.Inactive ingredients/excipients are butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), hypromellose, polyethylene glycol 400, polyethylene oxide, magnesium stearate, and titanium dioxide. The FDA approved relabeling the reformulated version as abuse-resistant in April 2013.

Pfizer manufactures a preparation of short-acting oxycodone, marketed as Oxecta, which contains inactive ingredients, referred to as tamper-resistant Aversion Technology. Approved by the FDA in the U.S. in June 2011, the new formulation, while not being able to deter oral recreational use, makes crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the opioid impractical because of a change in its chemical properties.

===Legal status===
Oxycodone is subject to international conventions on narcotic drugs. In addition, oxycodone is subject to national laws that differ by country. The 1931 Convention for Limiting the Manufacture and Regulating the Distribution of Narcotic Drugs of the League of Nations included oxycodone. The 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of the United Nations, which replaced the 1931 convention, categorized oxycodone in Schedule I. Global restrictions on Schedule I drugs include &quot;limit[ing] exclusively to medical and scientific purposes the production, manufacture, export, import, distribution of, trade in, use and possession of&quot; these drugs; &quot;requir[ing] medical prescriptions for the supply or dispensation of [these] drugs to individuals&quot;; and &quot;prevent[ing] the accumulation&quot; of quantities of these drugs &quot;in excess of those required for the normal conduct of business&quot;.

==== Australia ====
Oxycodone is in Schedule I (derived from the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs) of the Commonwealth&#x27;s Narcotic Drugs Act 1967. In addition, it is in Schedule 8 of the Australian Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Drugs and Poisons (&quot;Poisons Standard&quot;), meaning it is a &quot;controlled drug... which should be available for use but require[s] restriction of manufacture, supply, distribution, possession and use to reduce abuse, misuse and physical or psychological dependence&quot;.

==== Canada ====
Oxycodone is a controlled substance under Schedule I of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA).

In February 2012, Ontario passed legislation to allow the expansion of an already existing drug-tracking system for publicly funded drugs to include those that are privately insured. This database will function to identify and monitor patient&#x27;s attempts to seek prescriptions from multiple doctors or retrieve them from multiple pharmacies. Other provinces have proposed similar legislation, while some, such as Nova Scotia, have legislation already in effect for monitoring prescription drug use. These changes have coincided with other changes in Ontario&#x27;s legislation to target the misuse of painkillers and high addiction rates to drugs such as oxycodone. As of 29 February 2012, Ontario passed legislation delisting oxycodone from the province&#x27;s public drug benefit program. This was a first for any province to delist a drug based on addictive properties. The new law prohibits prescriptions for OxyNeo except to certain patients under the Exceptional Access Program including palliative care and in other extenuating circumstances. Patients already prescribed oxycodone will receive coverage for an additional year for OxyNeo, and after that, it will be disallowed unless designated under the exceptional access program.

Much of the legislative activity has stemmed from Purdue Pharma&#x27;s decision in 2011 to begin a modification of OxyContin&#x27;s composition to make it more difficult to crush for snorting or injecting. The new formulation, OxyNeo, is intended to be preventive in this regard and retain its effectiveness as a painkiller. Since introducing its &quot;Narcotics Safety and Awareness Act&quot;, Ontario has committed to focusing on drug addiction, particularly in the monitoring and identification of problem opioid prescriptions, as well as the education of patients, doctors, and pharmacists. This Act, introduced in 2010, commits to the establishment of a unified database to fulfil this intention. Both the public and medical community have received the legislation positively, though concerns about the ramifications of legal changes have been expressed. Because laws are largely provincially regulated, many speculate a national strategy is needed to prevent smuggling across provincial borders from jurisdictions with looser restrictions.

In 2015, Purdue Pharma&#x27;s abuse-resistant OxyNEO and six generic versions of OxyContin had been on the Canada-wide approved list for prescriptions since 2012. In June 2015, then-federal Minister of Health Rona Ambrose announced that within three years, all oxycodone products sold in Canada would need to be tamper-resistant. Some experts warned that the generic product manufacturers may not have the technology to achieve that goal, possibly giving Purdue Pharma a monopoly on this opiate.

Several class-action suits across Canada have been launched against the Purdue group of companies and affiliates. Claimants argue the pharmaceutical manufacturers did not meet a standard of care and were negligent in doing so. These lawsuits reference earlier judgments in the United States, which held that Purdue was liable for wrongful marketing practices and misbranding. Since 2007, the Purdue companies have paid over CAN$650 million in settling litigation or facing criminal fines.

==== Germany ====
The drug is in Appendix III of the Narcotics Act (&quot;Betäubungsmittelgesetz&quot; or BtMG). The law allows only physicians, dentists, and veterinarians to prescribe oxycodone and the federal government to regulate the prescriptions (e.g., by requiring reporting).

==== Hong Kong ====
Oxycodone is regulated under Part I of Schedule 1 of Hong Kong&#x27;s Chapter 134 Dangerous Drugs Ordinance.

==== Japan ====
Oxycodone is a restricted drug in Japan. Its import and export are strictly restricted to specially designated organizations having a prior permit to import it. In a high-profile case an American who was a top Toyota executive living in Tokyo, who claimed to be unaware of the law, was arrested for importing oxycodone into Japan.

==== Singapore ====
Oxycodone is listed as a Class A drug in the Misuse of Drugs Act of Singapore, which means offences concerning the drug attract the most severe level of punishment. A conviction for unauthorized manufacture of the drug attracts a minimum sentence of 10 years of imprisonment and corporal punishment of 5 strokes of the cane, and a maximum sentence of life imprisonment or 30 years of imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane. The minimum and maximum penalties for unauthorized trafficking in the drug are respectively 5 years of imprisonment and 5 strokes of the cane, and 20 years of imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane.

==== United Kingdom ====
Oxycodone is a Class A drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. For Class A drugs, which are &quot;considered to be the most likely to cause harm&quot;, possession without a prescription is punishable by up to seven years in prison, an unlimited fine, or both. Dealing of the drug illegally is punishable by up to life imprisonment, an unlimited fine, or both. Oxycodone is a Schedule 2 drug under the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001 which &quot;provide certain exemptions from the provisions of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971&quot;.

==== United States ====
Under the Controlled Substances Act, oxycodone is a Schedule II controlled substance whether by itself or part of a multi-ingredient medication. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) lists oxycodone both for sale and for use in manufacturing other opioids as ACSCN 9143 and in 2013 approved the following annual aggregate manufacturing quotas: 131.5 metric tons for sale, down from 153.75 in 2012, and 10.25 metric tons for conversion, unchanged from the previous year. In 2020, oxycodone possession was decriminalized in the U.S. state of Oregon.

===Economics===
The International Narcotics Control Board estimated of oxycodone were manufactured worldwide in 1998; by 2007 this figure had grown to . United States accounted for 82% of consumption in 2007 at . Canada, Germany, Australia, and France combined accounted for 13% of consumption in 2007. In 2010, of oxycodone were illegally manufactured using a fake pill imprint. This accounted for 0.8% of consumption. These illicit tablets were later seized by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, according to the International Narcotics Control Board. The board also reported manufactured in 2010. This number had decreased from a record high of in 2009.

===Names===
Expanded expressions for the compound oxycodone in the academic literature include &quot;dihydrohydroxycodeinone&quot;, &quot;Eucodal&quot;, &quot;Eukodal&quot;, &quot;14-hydroxydihydrocodeinone&quot;, and &quot;Nucodan&quot;. In a UNESCO convention, the translations of &quot;oxycodone&quot; are &quot;oxycodon&quot; (Dutch), &quot;oxycodone&quot; (French), &quot;oxicodona&quot; (Spanish), (Arabic), (Chinese), and (Russian).

The word &quot;oxycodone&quot; should not be confused with &quot;oxandrolone&quot;, &quot;oxazepam&quot;, &quot;oxybutynin&quot;, &quot;oxytocin&quot;, or &quot;Roxanol&quot;.

Other brand names include Longtec and Shortec.

<text>Occidental College (informally Oxy) is a private liberal arts college in Los Angeles, California, United States. Founded in 1887 as a coeducational college by clergy and members of the Presbyterian Church, it became non-sectarian in 1910. It is one of the oldest liberal arts colleges on the West Coast of the United States.

Occidental&#x27;s current campus is located in Eagle Rock, Los Angeles, and was designed by architect Myron Hunt. Due to its proximity to Hollywood and its architecture, the campus is frequently used as a filming location for film and television productions. Occidental is a founding member of the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference and its 20 varsity sports teams compete in NCAA Division III. The college&#x27;s curriculum emphasizes diversity, global literacy, and civic engagement.

Notable alumni include President Barack Obama, a Cabinet member, several members of the United States Congress, CEOs of notable companies, 10 Rhodes Scholars, and recipients of the Pulitzer Prize, Academy Award, BAFTA Award, Tony Award and Emmy Award.

==History==
===Early history===

Occidental College was founded on April 20, 1887, by a group of Presbyterian clergy, missionaries, and laymen, including James George Bell, Lyman Stewart, and Thomas Bard. The cornerstone of the school&#x27;s first building was laid in September 1887 in the Boyle Heights now East Los Angeles neighborhood of Los Angeles. The college&#x27;s first term began a year later with 27 male and 13 female students, and tuition of $50 a year.

In 1896, the Boyle Heights building was destroyed by fire. The college temporarily relocated to the old St. Vincent&#x27;s College campus on Hill Street before a new site was selected in Highland Park in 1898. Eventually, the college erected three main buildings: the Academy Building, the Stimson Library, and the Hall of Arts and Letters (the Hall still stands today, converted to apartments). The Highland Park site was also bisected by the tracks of the Santa Fe Railroad, and was the site of two presidential visits, first by William Howard Taft in 1909 and subsequently by Theodore Roosevelt in 1911.

In 1909, the Pomona College Board of Trustees suggested a merger between Pomona and Occidental, but the proposal came to nothing. The following year, the college severed formal ties with the Presbyterian Church and became a non-sectarian, non-denominational institution. The small size of the campus and the disruption caused by frequent freight trains pushed the college&#x27;s trustees to find a new location.

===1900s===

In 1912, the school began construction of a new campus located in Los Angeles&#x27; Eagle Rock neighborhood. The Eagle Rock campus was designed by noted California architect Myron Hunt, also known as the planner of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) campus and as designer of the Huntington Library and Art Gallery and the Rose Bowl. That same year, Occidental President John Willis Baer announced the trustees&#x27; decision to convert Occidental College into an all-men&#x27;s institution. The plans were met with widespread backlash from students and faculty who protested the change. The community outcry garnered national headlines and the board later dropped the proposal.

Two weeks after Booker T. Washington came to visit Occidental, on March 27, 1914, Swan, Fowler, and Johnson Halls were dedicated at its new Eagle Rock campus. Patterson Field, today one of the oldest collegiate sports stadiums in Los Angeles, was opened in 1916. In April 1917, shortly after the United States entered World War I, the college formed a Students Army Training Corps to aid the war effort.

Under Occidental President Remsen Bird, the school opened a series of new Hunt-designed buildings, including Clapp Library (1924), Hillside Theatre and a women&#x27;s dormitory (Orr Hall) in 1925, Alumni Gymnasium (1926), the Freeman Student Union (1928) and a music and speech building (1929). The Delta of California chapter of Phi Beta Kappa was established at Occidental in 1926, at a time when the only other chapters in California were at Stanford, UC Berkeley, and Pomona.

English novelist Aldous Huxley, who had spoken at Occidental&#x27;s convocation ceremony in the then-new Thorne Hall in 1938, lampooned President Remsen Bird as Dr. Herbert Mulge of Tarzana College in his 1939 novel, &quot;After Many a Summer Dies the Swan&quot;. Huxley was never again invited back to campus.

During World War II, many students left Occidental to fight in the war. In July 1943, the U.S. Navy established a Navy V-12 officer training program on campus that produced hundreds of graduates before it was disbanded in 1945 at the end of the war. Occidental President Remsen Bird worked behind the scenes to help Oxy students of Japanese descent continue their education despite mandatory evacuation orders; his letters are included in the Japanese American Relocation Collection in Clapp Library.

After having its first Rhodes Scholar, Clarence Spaulding, named in 1908, Oxy seniors John Paden and Aaron Segal were awarded Rhodes Scholarships in 1958, the only time Occidental has produced two Rhodes Scholars in a single year. Paden and Segal were among the ten Occidental students who participated in Crossroads Africa that year, a forerunner to the Peace Corps that later became a national program.

In 1969, 42 students were suspended for peacefully protesting military recruiting on campus. One year later, faculty voted to suspend classes in the wake of the Kent State shootings and America&#x27;s invasion of Cambodia. Subsequently, Oxy students wrote 7,000 letters to Washington D.C., protesting U.S. involvement in the war in Southeast Asia. Occidental launched one of the country&#x27;s first Upward Bound programs in 1966, aimed at increasing the number of low-income, underrepresented high school students who become the first in their family to go to college.

Also in 1969, the school opened its first two co-ed dormitories, and two more followed a year later. In 1988, John Brooks Slaughter, formerly Chancellor of the University of Maryland, became Occidental&#x27;s first black president. Building on faculty and student advocacy and a series of grants the college had received previously to increase the diversity of the Occidental student body, Slaughter led the process of creating a new mission statement that is still used today. Also, Slaughter led the college&#x27;s community outreach expansion with the creation of the Center for Volunteerism and Community Service, the predecessor for the current Center for Community Based Learning.
In November 1990, the college rededicated the campus&#x27; main chapel as the Herrick Memorial Chapel and Interfaith Center. The school also took down the crosses in the chapel in an attempt to &quot;broaden Occidental&#x27;s appeal among non-Christian students.&quot;

===2000s===
In July 2006, Susan Westerberg Prager became Occidental&#x27;s first female president. She left her position in 2007. Robert Skotheim served as interim president. In July 2009, Jonathan Veitch became Occidental&#x27;s 15th president, and the first native Angeleno president.

The college received national scrutiny in 2014 when the U.S. Department of Education named Occidental College as one of 55 higher education institutions under investigation &quot;for possible violations of federal law over the handling of sexual violence and harassment.&quot; In response to student and faculty outcry the college adopted a new interim sexual misconduct policy, hired a former assistant district attorney as a full-time, independent Title IX coordinator, and added a new 24-hour, 7-days-a-week telephone hotline. The school also created a permanent Sexual Misconduct Advisory Board made up of students, faculty, and staff. Two years later, the investigation was concluded with the Office of Civil Rights finding that &quot;the preponderance of the evidence does not support a conclusion that the College violated Title IX, except with respect to the issue of promptness in several cases during the 2012-13 school years.&quot;

President Barack Obama attended Occidental for two years prior to transferring to Columbia University. In 2015, &quot;birthers&quot; falsely claimed that Obama&#x27;s Occidental College transcript revealed he received financial aid as a foreign student from Indonesia after the resurgence of a fake news story from 2009.

In July 2020, Harry J. Elam, Jr., formerly vice provost for undergraduate education and Drama professor at Stanford University, became Occidental&#x27;s 16th president. In August 2023, it was announced that he will retire in 2024 for health-related reasons. On March 26, 2024, it was announced that Tom Stritikus, late of Fort Lewis College, will become Occidental&#x27;s president effective July 1.

==Campus==

Architect Myron Hunt created the original campus master plan for Occidental&#x27;s Eagle Rock campus in 1911. He structured the campus in a Mediterranean style, with covered walkways and tile roofs. The campus landscape was designed and developed by Beatrix Farrand in the late 1930s. All of the 19 buildings designed by Hunt remain in use today.

The campus is noted for the outdoor Remsen Bird Amphitheater, where between 1960 and 1996 plays and musicals were performed in the summer. Financial cutbacks caused the theater department to end the summer festival programs. Since 1996 the Occidental Children&#x27;s Theater has performed there each summer.

Occidental College was ranked as the sixth &quot;Most Beautiful&quot; campus by &quot;Newsweek&quot; in 2012. The campus is home to a 1-megawatt ground-mounted solar array, which is the largest hillside array on an American college campus and the largest of its kind in Los Angeles. The 4,886-panel installation was completed in Spring 2013 and inaugurated on the school&#x27;s 126-year anniversary.

==Academics==

There are more than 40 majors offered on campus (and nine minor-only programs, including Public Health, Linguistics, and Classical Studies) and a 9:1 student–faculty ratio. The average class size is 18 students and most students take four classes per semester. the most popular majors, based on 2021 graduates, were Econometrics &amp; Quantitative Economics (46), Psychology (38), Biology/Biological Sciences (37), Political Science &amp; Government (34), Environmental Studies (31), International Relations and Affairs (31).

=== Rankings ===
Since 1908, Occidental has graduated ten Rhodes Scholars. In &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&#x27;s&quot; 2025 rankings of American liberal arts colleges, Occidental was tied for 34th overall, tied for 18th in &quot;Top Performers in Social Mobility,&quot; 71st for &quot;Best Value,&quot; and tied at 102nd for &quot;Economics.&quot; The 2017 edition of the &quot;Fiske Guide to Colleges&quot; gave Occidental four-star ratings (out of five) in academics and quality of life. Princeton Review&#x27;s &quot;The Best 381 Colleges&quot; 2017 Edition gave Occidental ratings of 91 (out of 100) in academics and quality of life and 95 in financial aid. In &quot;Forbes&quot;″ 2019 ranking of America&#x27;s Top Colleges, Occidental ranks 102nd out of 650 liberal arts colleges, universities and service academies. &quot;Kiplinger&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Best College Values 2019&quot; rankings places Occidental 58th among 149 liberal arts colleges.

=== Admissions ===
Fall admission statistics

&quot;U.S. News&quot; deemed Occidental&#x27;s admissions &quot;more selective,&quot; with the class of 2020 acceptance rate being 37.3%. Of those admitted submitting such data, 52% were in the top 10% of their high school class. The SAT 25th–75th percentile scores were 1810–2120. Of those admitted to the class of 2020, 50% identified as persons of color, and 13% of those admitted were international students.

In 2023, it was announced by President Harry Elam that Occidental eliminated legacy preferences to the children of alumni in admissions.

==Student life==

At the beginning of every school year, freshmen participate in convocation, a formal ceremony welcoming new students to the college in which the faculty wear their full academic regalia and students don robes. Founders Day is celebrated annually at the school on April 20, the day in 1887 when Occidental&#x27;s incorporation papers were officially signed by the California Secretary of State.

There are also themed-living communities which consist of the Multicultural Hall in Pauley (open to all years), all-women housing (Berkus House, named after alumnus Dave Berkus), Food Justice house, and several communities that support and uplift the experiences of students of color and LGBTQIA students.

===Media===
The campus newspaper is &quot;The Occidental&quot;, an independent, student-run publication. It has been published continuously since 1893.

KOXY is a student-run campus radio station, in operation in the 1960s and 1970s, and again since 2000. It originally operated on the frequency 104.7 in and around campus from 1968 to 2009, but switched to only being available by webstream in 2009. KOXY sponsors several on-campus events.

In 2010, students launched a TV station called CatAList; The station produces 20–30 minutes of student-run content weekly.

===Greek life===
Occidental College&#x27;s Greek Council consists of roughly eight members, both sororites and fraternities.

==Athletics==
Occidental is one of the five schools that founded the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (SCIAC) in 1915 and is currently a member of the SCIAC and NCAA Division III. Occidental features 21 varsity sports teams and a program of club sports and intramural competition. Approximately 25 percent of the student body participates in a varsity sports program.

During the 2006–2007 athletic season, the Tigers cross country, American football and basketball teams were Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference champions. In 2014, diver Jessica Robson set the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference records for both 1m and 3m diving. The school&#x27;s Blackshirts Rugby union team was also league champion for the first time in five years. In 2011, Jeremy Castro (&#x27;99) and Patrick Guthrie (&#x27;86) steered the squad to a NSCRO final, falling to Longwood University 36–27 in Virginia Beach, Virginia. In addition the college has a dance team that also performs at every home football and basketball game.

Occidental athletics date back to 1894, when the college helped organize the first intercollegiate athletic competition in Southern California. Since then, Oxy has produced more than a dozen Olympians, world-record holders, and national champions, including 1935 national girls&#x27; tennis champion Pat Henry Yeomans &#x27;38, two-time diving gold medalist Sammy Lee &#x27;43, and pole vault silver medalist Bob Gutowski &#x27;57.

Occidental has long-standing football rivalries with Pomona College and Whittier College; the Tigers have played both the Sagehens and the Poets over 100 times. In 1982, the Occidental College football team had the rare opportunity for national prominence when, due to the 1982 National Football League strike, their game with San Diego was broadcast on national television. In 2017, Occidental cancelled the remainder of its football season due to lack of healthy players, as few as 30 in some cases. The team forfeited two games and was outscored in the other three 170–19. The Tigers played nine games in 2019, finishing with a 1–8 record. It was the final season for the Tigers football team. The school dropped football in 2020.

In 2011, Occidental College lost a basketball game to Caltech with a score of 46 to 45 giving the Caltech Beavers their first conference win in 26 years and putting an end to their 310-game losing streak.

In 2019, the Occidental Men&#x27;s Basketball Team reached the SCIAC championship game, ultimately losing to Pomona Pitzer in the Tournament Championship game.

Famous Occidental College Tigers include NFL coach Jim E. Mora, former American Football League Most Valuable Player and politician Jack Kemp, former NFL player Vance Mueller, 2011 U.S. Senior Open Champion Olin Browne, CFL Quarterback Bryan James Scott (Toronto Argonauts) and CFL player Justin Goltz (Winnipeg Blue Bombers).

<doc id="22801" wikidata="Q922661" url="?curid=22801" title="1986 United States bombing of Libya">
<text>The United States Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps carried out air strikes, code-named Operation El Dorado Canyon, against Libya on 15 April 1986 in retaliation for the West Berlin discotheque bombing ten days earlier, which U.S. President Ronald Reagan blamed on Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. There were 40 reported Libyan casualties; one U.S. plane was shot down. One of the claimed Libyan deaths was of a baby girl, reported to be Gaddafi&#x27;s daughter, Hana Gaddafi. However, there are doubts both as to whether she was really killed, or even if she truly existed.

==Origins==
Libya represented a high priority for President Ronald Reagan shortly after his 1981 inauguration. Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi was firmly anti-Israel and had supported violent organizations in the Palestinian territories and Syria. There were reports that Libya was attempting to become a nuclear power and Gaddafi&#x27;s occupation of Chad, which was rich in uranium, was of major concern to the United States. Gaddafi&#x27;s ambitions to set up a federation of Arab and Muslim states in North Africa were alarming to U.S. interests. Furthermore, then-U.S. Secretary of State Alexander Haig wanted to take proactive measures against Gaddafi because he had been using former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) operatives (most notably Edwin P. Wilson and Frank E. Terpil) to help set up terrorist camps.

After the December 1985 Rome and Vienna airport attacks, which killed 19 and wounded approximately 140, Gaddafi indicated that he would continue to support the Red Army Faction, the Red Brigades, and the Irish Republican Army as long as the European governments allegedly “supported anti-Gaddafi Libyans.”

After years of occasional skirmishes with Libya over Libyan territorial claims to the Gulf of Sidra, the United States contemplated a military attack to strike targets within the Libyan mainland. In March 1986, the United States, asserting the limit to territorial waters according to international law, sent a carrier task force to the region. Libya responded with aggressive counter-maneuvers on 24 March that led to a naval engagement in the Gulf of Sidra.

On 5 April 1986, alleged Libyan agents bombed &quot;La Belle&quot; nightclub in West Berlin, killing three people, including two U.S. servicemen and a Turkish woman, and injuring 229 people, including 79 Americans. West Germany and the United States obtained cable transcripts from Libyan agents in East Germany who were involved in the attack.

More detailed information was retrieved years later when Stasi archives were investigated by the reunited Germany. Libyan agents who had carried out the operation from the Libyan embassy in East Germany were identified and prosecuted by Germany in the 1990s.

==Preparations==
The attack mission against Libya had been preceded in October 1985 by an exercise in which the 20th TFW stationed at RAF Upper Heyford airbase in the UK, which was equipped with F-111E Aardvarks, received a top-secret order to launch a simulated attack mission on 18 October, with ten F-111Es armed with eight 500-lb practice bombs, against a simulated airfield located in Labrador, Canada south of CFB Goose Bay. The mission was designated Operation Ghost Rider. The mission was a full rehearsal for a long-range strike against Libya. The mission was completed successfully, with the exception of one aircraft that had all but one of its eight bombs hang up on one of its wing racks. The lessons learned were passed on to the 48th TFW which was equipped with the newer F-111F model.

In August 1985 six specially trained B-52H crews of the 23rd Bombardment Squadron in Minot, North Dakota, were designated as the Advanced Conventional Taskforce (ACT) and trained at specialized low-level conventional bombing missions, including the first ever use of Night Vision Goggles by B-52 crews. The specially trained crews were capable of delivering 6 strings of MK-117 munitions seconds apart with pinpoint accuracy operating from North Dakota. In six months of intensive training the special mission unit dropped more live ordnance in the Nevada and Utah test ranges than had been expended since the conclusion of the Vietnam War. The B-52 provided a powerful alternative or follow-on option, however, as the backbone of the U.S. nuclear deterrent there was some risk to using the B-52 option against an SA-6 defended target. 

Elements of the then-secret 4450th Tactical Group (USAF) were put on standby to fly the strike mission against Libya. Over 30 F-117 Nighthawk stealth attack aircraft had already been delivered to Tactical Air Command (USAF) and were operating from Tonopah Test Range Airport in Nevada. European Command senior officers knew nothing about the stealth capabilities of the F-117, or that the aircraft even existed. Within an hour of the planned launch of the F-117s, Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger scrubbed the stealth mission, fearing a compromise of the secret aircraft and its development program. The air strike was carried out with conventional U.S. Navy and USAF aircraft. The F-117 would remain completely unknown to the world for several more months, before being unveiled in 1988 and featured prominently in media coverage of Operation Desert Storm.

For the Libyan raid, the United States was denied overflight rights by France, Spain, and Italy as well as the use of European continental bases, forcing the USAF portion of the operation to be flown around France and Spain, over Portugal and through the Straits of Gibraltar, adding 1,300 miles (2,100 km) each way and requiring multiple aerial refuelings. The French refusal alone added 2,800 km. French President François Mitterrand refused overflight clearance because the United States was interested in limited action in Libya while France was more interested in action that would remove Gaddafi from power. Another factor in the French decision was the United States&#x27; last-minute failure to participate in a retaliatory air raid on Iranian positions after the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings.

==Targets==

After several unproductive days of meetings with European and Arab nations, and influenced by an American serviceman&#x27;s death, Ronald Reagan, on 14 April, ordered an air raid on the following Libyan targets:
* Bab al-Azizia Barracks in Tripoli – Gaddafi&#x27;s command and control center for overseas operations
* Murrat Sidi Bilal in Tripoli – a training camp for naval commandos and combat frogmen
* Mitiga International Airport – used by Ilyushin Il-76 transport aircraft
* Jamahiriyah Guard barracks in Benghazi – an alternative command and control headquarters for overseas operations, and which contained a warehouse for storage of MiG aircraft components
* Benina International Airport – used as a base by defending fighters

==Strike force==
Among operational United States tactical aircraft, only the General Dynamics F-111 and the A-6 Intruder possessed the ability to attack at night with the required precision. Although the F-111s would be required to fly from distant bases, they were essential to mission success, because the eighteen A-6s available aboard and could not carry enough bombs to simultaneously inflict the desired damage on the five targets selected.

===United States Air Force===
Twenty-eight McDonnell Douglas KC-10 Extenders and Boeing KC-135 Stratotankers took off from RAF Mildenhall and RAF Fairford shortly after 19:00 on 14 April. These tankers would conduct four silent refueling operations over the round-trip route the F-111s would fly to target. Within minutes the tankers were followed by twenty-four F-111F strike aircraft of the 48th Tactical Fighter Wing, flying from RAF Lakenheath and five EF-111A Ravens of the 20th Tactical Fighter Wing from RAF Upper Heyford. Six F-111s and one EF-111 were designated spares who returned to base after the first refueling was completed without any system failures among the designated strike aircraft.

===United States Navy===
&quot;America&quot; was on station in the Gulf of Sidra, but &quot;Coral Sea&quot; was preparing to leave the Mediterranean, and made a high speed run from Naples through the Strait of Messina. &quot;America″s&quot; air group would strike targets in downtown Benghazi and provide fighter and suppression support for the USAF bombers, while &quot;Coral Sea″s&quot; planes would strike the Benina airfield outside Benghazi and provide fighter and suppression support for the Navy bombers. About 01:00 &quot;America&quot; launched six A-6E TRAM Intruder strike aircraft with Mark 82 bombs against the Jamahiriyah Guard barracks and six A-7 Corsair strike support aircraft. &quot;Coral Sea&quot;, operating east of &quot;America&quot; simultaneously launched eight A-6E TRAM Intruders and six F/A-18A Hornets. Additional fighters were launched for combat air patrol (CAP).

==The raid==

The raid began in the early hours of 15 April, with the stated objectives of sending a message and reducing Libya&#x27;s ability to support and train terrorists. Shortly after the raid Reagan warned &quot;Today, we have done what we had to do. If necessary, we shall do it again.&quot;

Coordinated jamming by the EF-111s and EA-6B Prowlers began at 01:54 (Libyan time) as the A-7Es and F/A-18As began launching AGM-88 HARM and AGM-45 Shrike missiles for suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD). The attack began at 0200 hours (Libyan time), and lasted about twelve minutes, with 60 tons of munitions dropped. The F-111 bombers&#x27; rules of engagement required target identification by both radar and Pave Tack prior to bomb release to minimize collateral damage. Of the nine F-111s targeting Bab al-Azizia, only three placed their GBU-10 Paveway II bombs on target. One F-111 was shot down by a Libyan SAM over the Gulf of Sidra and one F-111&#x27;s bombs missed the barracks, striking diplomatic and civilian sites in Tripoli, and narrowly missing the French embassy. All three F-111s assigned to Sidi Bilal released their GBU-10 bombs on target. One of the six F-111s assigned to bomb the Tripoli airfield aborted its mission with a terrain-following radar malfunction, but the remaining five dropped BSU-49 high drag bombs destroying two Il-76 transport aircraft. &quot;America″s&quot; A-6s damaged the Jamahiriyah MiG assembly warehouse and destroyed four MiG shipping crates. Two A-6s from &quot;Coral Sea&quot; aborted their mission, but five A-6s with CBU-59 APAM cluster bombs and one with Mk 82 bombs struck Benina airfield destroying three or four MiGs, two Mil Mi-8 helicopters, one Fokker F27 Friendship transport, and one small straight-wing aircraft. A Boeing 727 was also reportedly destroyed during the Benina strike.

Some Libyan soldiers, reportedly, abandoned their positions in fright and confusion, and officers were slow to give orders. Libyan anti-aircraft fire did not begin until after the planes had passed over their targets. No Libyan fighters launched, and HARM launches and jamming prevented any of the 2K12 Kub (SA-6), S-75 Dvina (SA-2), S-125 Neva/Pechora (SA-3), or Crotale SAM launches from homing. One SA-6 however was able to track onto an A-6 from VA-34 during the strike on the Jamahiriyah barracks but was evaded successfully.

Within twelve minutes, all United States aircraft were &quot;feet wet&quot; outbound over the Mediterranean. Navy strike aircraft had been recovered aboard their carriers by 02:53 (Libyan time) and surviving USAF planes, with the exception of one F-111, which landed in Naval Station Rota, Spain, with an overheated engine, had returned to Britain by 10:10 (Libyan time).
Although the bombing operations were staged out of the UK, RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus was employed in the role of an alternate in case of emergency, and was used as such by at least one aircraft. This led to retaliatory action against the British base.

===U.S. forces and targets===
===Libyan air defenses===
The Libyan air defense network was extensive, and included:
* 4 Long range S-200 Vega (SA-5 Gammon) anti-aircraft missile units with 24 launchers.
* 86 S-75 Volkhov (SA-2 Guideline) and S-125 Neva (SA-3 Goa) anti-aircraft missile units with 276 launchers.
Covering Tripoli alone were:
* 7 S-75 Volkhov (SA-2 Guideline) anti-aircraft missile units with 6 missiles launchers per unit giving 42 launchers.
* 12 S-125 Neva (SA-3 Goa) anti-aircraft missile units with 4 missiles launchers per unit giving 48 launchers.
* 3 2K12 Kub (SA-6 Gainful) anti-aircraft missile units with 48 launchers.
* 1 9K33M2 Osa-AK (SA-8 Geko) anti-aircraft regiment with 16 launch vehicles.
* 2 Crotale II anti-aircraft units with 60 launch pads.

==Casualties==

===Libyan===
Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and his family rushed out of their residence in the Bab al-Azizia compound moments before the bombs dropped, forewarned by a telephone call from Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici, Malta&#x27;s Prime Minister. Bonnici had been made aware of the presence of the American strike force by Prime Minister Bettino Craxi of Italy; the latter nation had detected the then-unidentified aircraft off the West coast of Sicily and scrambled a flight of F-104 Starfighters to intercept it, discovering the strike force&#x27;s presence and being warned away by pilots with obvious American accents.

According to medical staff in a nearby hospital, two dozen casualties were brought in wearing military uniforms, and two without uniforms. Total Libyan casualties were estimated at 60, including those at the bombed airbases. An infant girl was among the casualties; her body was shown to American reporters, who were told she was Gaddafi&#x27;s recently adopted daughter Hana. However, there was and remains much skepticism over the claim. She may not have died; the adoption may have been posthumous; or he may have adopted a second daughter and given her the same name after the first one died.

===American===
Two U.S. Air Force captains—Fernando L. Ribas-Dominicci and Paul F. Lorence—were killed when their F-111 fighter-bomber (callsign Karma-52) was shot down over the Gulf of Sidra. In the hours following the attack, the U.S. military refused to speculate as to whether or not the fighter-bomber had been shot down, with Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger suggesting that it could have experienced radio trouble or been diverted to another airfield. The next day, the Pentagon had announced it was no longer searching for the F-111 believed to be downed by a Libyan missile. On 25 December 1988, Gaddafi offered to release the body of Lorence to his family through Pope John Paul II. The body, returned in 1989, was identified as Ribas-Dominicci&#x27;s from dental records. An autopsy conducted in Spain confirmed that he had drowned after his plane was shot down over the Gulf of Sidra. Libya denies that it held Lorence&#x27;s body. However, Lorence&#x27;s brother said that he and his mother saw television footage of a Libyan holding a white helmet with the name &quot;Lorence&quot; stenciled on the back. Furthermore, William C. Chasey, who toured the Bab al-Azizia barracks, claimed to have seen two flight suits and helmets engraved with the names &quot;Lorence&quot; and &quot;Ribas-Dominicci&quot;, as well as the wreckage of their F-111. Gaddafi declared that the raid was a Libyan victory and stated that three American planes had been shot down, but Karma-52 was the only one that failed to return to base.

==Aftermath==

===In Libya===

====Gaddafi&#x27;s announcements====
Gaddafi announced that he had &quot;won a spectacular military victory over the United States&quot; and the country was officially renamed the &quot;Great Socialist People&#x27;s Libyan Arab Jamahiriyah&quot;.

Gaddafi said reconciliation between Libya and the United States was impossible so long as Reagan was in the White House; of the US president he said, &quot;He is mad. He is foolish. He is an Israeli dog.&quot; He said he had no plans to attack the United States or U.S. targets. He claimed that Reagan wanted to kill him, stating &quot;Was Reagan trying to kill me? Of course. The attack was concentrated on my house and I was in my house&quot;, he also described how he rescued his family.
When asked whether he was in danger of losing power, he said: &quot;Really, these reports and writings are not true. As you can see I am fine, and there has been no change in our country.&quot;

====Other events====
The Government of Libya said that the United States had fallen prey to arrogance and madness of power and wanted to become the world&#x27;s policeman. It charged that any party that did not agree to become an American vassal was an outlaw, a terrorist, and a devil.

Gaddafi quashed an internal revolt, the organization of which he blamed on the United States, although Gaddafi appeared to have left the public sphere for a time in 1986 and 1987.

The Libyan Post dedicated several postage stamps issues to the event, from 1986 until 2001. The first issue was released in 1986, 13 July (ref. Scott catalogue n.1311 – Michel catalogue n.1699). The last issue was released in 2001, 15 April (ref. Scott catalogue n.1653 – Michel catalogue n.2748–2763).

===Libyan retaliation===

====Immediate====
Libya responded by firing two Scud missiles at a United States Coast Guard station on the Italian island of Lampedusa which fell short of the island and landed in the sea.

====Later Libyan-connected terrorism====
There was only limited change in Libyan-connected terrorism.

The Libyan government was alleged to have ordered the hijacking of Pan Am Flight 73 in Pakistan on 5 September 1986, which resulted in the deaths of 20 people. The allegation did not come to light until it was reported by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; in March 2004—days after British Prime Minister Tony Blair paid the first official visit to Tripoli by a Western leader in a generation.

In October 1986, Gaddafi financed Jeff Fort&#x27;s Al-Rukn faction of the Chicago Black P. Stones gang, in their emergence as an anti-American armed revolutionary movement. Al-Rukn members were arrested for preparing strikes on behalf of Libya, including blowing up US government buildings and bringing down an airplane; the Al-Rukn defendants were convicted in 1987 of &quot;offering to commit bombings and assassinations on US soil for Libyan payment.&quot;

In May 1987, Australia expelled diplomats and broke off relations with Libya, claiming Libya sought to fuel violence in Australia and Oceania.

In late 1987 French authorities stopped a merchant vessel, the MV &quot;Eksund&quot;, which was attempting to deliver 150 tons of Soviet arms from Libya to the Irish Republican Army (IRA), partly in retaliation against the British for harboring American fighter planes.

In Beirut, Lebanon, two British hostages held by the Libyan-supported Abu Nidal Organization, Leigh Douglas and Philip Padfield, along with an American named Peter Kilburn, were shot dead in revenge. In addition, journalist John McCarthy was kidnapped, and tourist Paul Appleby was murdered in Jerusalem. Another British hostage named Alec Collett was also killed in retaliation for the bombing of Libya. Collett was shown being hanged in a video tape. His body was found in November 2009.

On 21 December 1988 Libya bombed Pan Am Flight 103, which exploded in mid-air and crashed on the town of Lockerbie in Scotland after a bomb detonated, killing all 259 people aboard, and 11 people in Lockerbie. Iran was initially thought to have been responsible for the bombing in revenge for the downing of Iran Air flight 655 by the American missile cruiser USS &quot;Vincennes&quot; over the Persian Gulf, but in 1991 two Libyans were charged, one of whom was convicted of the crime in a controversial judgement on 31 January 2001. The Libyan Government accepted responsibility for the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing on 29 May 2002, and offered $2.7 billion to compensate the families of the 270 victims. The convicted Libyan, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, who was suffering from terminal prostate cancer, was released in August 2009 by the Scottish Government on compassionate grounds. He died in 2012. In May 2014 a group of relatives of the Lockerbie victims continued to campaign for al-Megrahi&#x27;s name to be cleared by reopening the case.

===International response===

====Immediate====

The attack was condemned by many countries. By a vote of 79 in favor to 28 against with 33 abstentions, the United Nations General Assembly adopted resolution 41/38, which &quot;condemns the military attack perpetrated against the Socialist People&#x27;s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya on 15 April 1986, which constitutes a violation of the Charter of the United Nations and of international law.&quot;

A meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement said that it condemned the &quot;dastardly, blatant and unprovoked act of aggression&quot;. The League of Arab States expressed that it was outraged at the United States aggression and that it reinforced an element of anarchy in international relations. The Assembly of Heads of State of the African Union said that the deliberate attempt to kill Libyans violated the principles of international law. The Government of Iran asserted that the attack constituted a policy of aggression, gunboat diplomacy, an act of war, and called for an extensive political and economic boycott of the United States. Others saw the United States motive as an attempt to eliminate Libya&#x27;s revolution.
China stated that the U.S. attack violated norms of international relations and had aggravated tension in the region. The Soviet Union said that there was a clear link between the attack and U.S. policy aimed at stirring up existing hotbeds of tension and creating new ones, and at destabilizing the international situation. West Germany stated that international disputes required diplomatic and not military solutions, and France also criticized the bombing.

Some observers held the opinion that Article 51 of the UN Charter set limitations on the use of force in exercising the legitimate right of self-defense in the absence of an act of aggression, and affirmed that there was no such act by Libya. It was charged that the United States did not exhaust the Charter provisions for settling disputes under Article 33. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; protested that if other nations applied Article 51 as cavalierly as the United States, then &quot;the Nicaraguan government, very reasonably predicting that the U.S. is planning an attack on its territory, has the right to bomb Washington.&quot; British Shadow Foreign Secretary Denis Healey told ABC News that, &quot;by this same rationale of defense against future attack, Britain could bomb apartment blocks in New York and Chicago on the ground that they contained people sending money and military supplies to the Irish Republican Army.&quot;

Others asserted that Libya was innocent in the bombing of the West Berlin discotheque.

The U.S. received support from the UK, Canada, Australia, Israel, and 25 other countries. Its doctrine of declaring a war on what it called &quot;terrorist havens&quot; was not repeated until 1998, when President Bill Clinton ordered strikes on six terrorist camps in Afghanistan. Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s approval of the use of Royal Air Force bases led to substantial public criticism, including an unprecedented story in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; suggesting the Queen was upset by an &quot;uncaring&quot; Prime Minister. However, the Americans strongly endorsed Thatcher, and the long-standing Special Relationship between the United States and Britain was strengthened.

Although the Soviet Union was ostensibly friendly with Libya, it had, by the time of the Libya bombing, made its increasing ambivalence toward Libya apparent in public communications. Gaddafi had a history of verbally attacking the policy agendas and ideology of the Soviet Union, and he often engaged in various international interventions and meddling that conflicted with Soviet goals in a variety of spheres. During a period where the Soviet Union was apparently attempting to lead a subtle diplomatic effort that could impact its global status, close association with the whims of Gaddafi became a liability.

In the entire crisis, the Soviet Union explicitly announced that it would not provide additional help to Libya beyond resupplying basic armaments and munitions. It made no attempt to militarily intimidate the United States, despite the ongoing American operations in the Gulf of Sidra and its previous knowledge that the United States might launch an attack. The Soviet Union did not completely ignore the event, issuing a denunciation of this &#x27;criminal&#x27; act by the United States.

After the raid, Moscow did cancel a planned visit to the United States by foreign affairs minister Eduard Shevardnadze. At the same time, it clearly signaled that it did not want this action to affect negotiations about the upcoming summer summit between the United States and the Soviet Union and its plans for new arms control agreements.

Former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark, acting for Libyan citizens who had been killed or injured in the bombing raid by the U.S. using British air bases, brought suit under international law against the United States and the United Kingdom in U.S. federal court. The lawsuit was dismissed as frivolous. A subsequent appeal was denied, and monetary sanctions against Clark were allowed. Saltany v. Reagan, 886 F. 2d 438 (D.C. Cir. 1989).

====UN response====
Every year, between at least 1994 and 2006, the United Nations General Assembly scheduled a declaration from the Organization of African Unity about the incident, but systematically deferred the discussion year after year until formally putting it aside (along with several other issues which had been similarly rescheduled for years) in 2005.

====First anniversary====
On the first anniversary of the bombing, April 1987, European and North American left-wing activists gathered to commemorate the anniversary. After a day of social and cultural networking with local Libyans, including a tour of Gaddafi&#x27;s bombed house, the group gathered with other Libyans for a commemoration event.

====2009 comment====
In June 2009, during a visit to Italy, Gaddafi criticized American foreign policy and, asked as to the difference between al-Qaeda attacks and the 1986 U.S. bombing of Tripoli, he commented: &quot;If al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden has no state and is an outlaw, America is a state with international rules.&quot;

===Settlement of claims===
On 28 May 2008, the United States began negotiations with Libya on a comprehensive claims settlement agreement to resolve outstanding claims of American and Libyan nationals against each country in their respective courts. Gaddafi&#x27;s son Saif al-Islam publicly announced that an agreement was being negotiated in July of that year. On 14 August 2008, the resulting U.S.-Libya Comprehensive Claims Settlement Agreement was signed in Tripoli by Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs David Welch and by Libyan Secretary for American Affairs Ahmad Fituri.

In October 2008, Libya paid US$1.5 billion (in three installments of $300 million on 9 October 2008, $600 million on 30 October 2008, and US$600 million 31 October 2008) into a fund used to compensate the following victims and their relatives:
* Lockerbie bombing victims, who were given an additional US$2 million each after having been paid US$8 million earlier;
* American victims of the 1986 West Berlin discotheque bombing;
* American victims of the 1989 UTA Flight 772 bombing; and,
* Libyan victims of the 1986 U.S. bombing of Tripoli and Benghazi.

To pay the settlement, Libya demanded US$1.5 billion from global oil companies operating in Libya&#x27;s oil fields, under threat of &quot;serious consequences&quot; to their leases. Libya&#x27;s settlement was at least partially funded by several companies, including some based in the U.S., that chose to cooperate with Libya&#x27;s demand.

On 4 August 2008, President George W. Bush signed into law the Libyan Claims Resolution Act, which had unanimously passed Congress on 31 July. The Act provided for the restoration of Libya&#x27;s sovereign, diplomatic, and official immunities before U.S. courts if the Secretary of State certified that the United States Government has received sufficient funds to resolve outstanding terrorism-related death and physical injury claims against Libya.

On 14 August 2008, the United States and Libya signed a comprehensive claims settlement agreement. Full diplomatic relations were restored between the two nations.

===In songs and books===

English alternative band The The’s 1986 album Infected features the song Sweet Bird of Truth which tells the fictionalised story of a US pilot on the Libya bombing raids. It continues to feature as a popular song on their live tours. 

In 1986, hardcore punk band The Meatmen referred to the lack of French cooperation with the raid in their song &#x27;French People Suck&#x27;: &quot;French people suck, I just gotta&#x27; say/made the jet fighter pilots fly out of their way.&quot; This song appears on the album &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Juggernaut&quot; (Caroline Records).

In 1987, Neil Young wrote &quot;Mideast Vacation&quot; a song from his live album, &quot;Life&quot; about the bombing.

On Roger Waters&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Amused to Death&quot; the songs &quot;Late Home Tonight, Part I&quot; and &quot;Late Home Tonight, Part II&quot; recall the bombing from the perspective of two &quot;ordinary wives&#x27; and a young American F-111 pilot.

In Nelson DeMille&#x27;s book &quot;The Lion&#x27;s Game&quot;, published in 2000, there is a detailed but fictionalised description of the attack from the point of view of one of the book&#x27;s main protagonists.

<text>An operational amplifier (often op amp or opamp) is a DC-coupled electronic voltage amplifier with a differential input, a (usually) single-ended output, and an extremely high gain. Its name comes from its original use of performing mathematical operations in analog computers. 

By using negative feedback, an op amp circuit&#x27;s characteristics (e.g. its gain, input and output impedance, bandwidth, and functionality) can be determined by external components and have little dependence on temperature coefficients or engineering tolerance in the op amp itself. This flexibility has made the op amp a popular building block in analog circuits.

Today, op amps are used widely in consumer, industrial, and scientific electronics. Many standard integrated circuit op amps cost only a few cents; however, some integrated or hybrid operational amplifiers with special performance specifications may cost over . Op amps may be packaged as components or used as elements of more complex integrated circuits.

The op amp is one type of differential amplifier. Other differential amplifier types include the fully differential amplifier (an op amp with a differential rather than single-ended output), the instrumentation amplifier (usually built from three op amps), the isolation amplifier (with galvanic isolation between input and output), and negative-feedback amplifier (usually built from one or more op amps and a resistive feedback network).

==Operation==

The amplifier&#x27;s differential inputs consist of a non-inverting input (+) with voltage &quot;V+&quot; and an inverting input (−) with voltage &quot;V−&quot;; ideally the op amp amplifies only the difference in voltage between the two, which is called the &quot;differential input voltage&quot;. The output voltage of the op amp &quot;V&quot;out is given by the equation
:formula_1
where &quot;A&quot;OL is the open-loop gain of the amplifier (the term &quot;open-loop&quot; refers to the absence of an external feedback loop from the output to the input).

=== Open-loop amplifier ===
The magnitude of &quot;A&quot;OL is typically very large (100,000 or more for integrated circuit op amps, corresponding to +100 dB). Thus, even small microvolts of difference between &quot;V&quot;+ and &quot;V&quot;− may drive the amplifier into clipping or saturation. The magnitude of &quot;A&quot;OL is not well controlled by the manufacturing process, and so it is impractical to use an open-loop amplifier as a stand-alone differential amplifier.

Without negative feedback, and optionally positive feedback for regeneration, an &quot;open-loop&quot; op amp acts as a comparator, although comparator ICs are better suited. If the inverting input is held at ground (0 V), and the input voltage &quot;V&quot;in applied to the non-inverting input is positive, the output will be maximum positive; if &quot;V&quot;in is negative, the output will be maximum negative. 

=== Closed-loop amplifier ===
If predictable operation is desired, negative feedback is used, by applying a portion of the output voltage to the inverting input. The &quot;closed-loop&quot; feedback greatly reduces the gain of the circuit. When negative feedback is used, the circuit&#x27;s overall gain and response is determined primarily by the feedback network, rather than by the op-amp characteristics. If the feedback network is made of components with values small relative to the op amp&#x27;s input impedance, the value of the op amp&#x27;s open-loop response &quot;A&quot;OL does not seriously affect the circuit&#x27;s performance. In this context, high input impedance at the input terminals and low output impedance at the output terminal(s) are particularly useful features of an op amp. 

The response of the op-amp circuit with its input, output, and feedback circuits to an input is characterized mathematically by a transfer function; designing an op-amp circuit to have a desired transfer function is in the realm of electrical engineering. The transfer functions are important in most applications of op amps, such as in analog computers.

In the non-inverting amplifier on the right, the presence of negative feedback via the voltage divider &quot;R&quot;f, &quot;R&quot;g determines the &quot;closed-loop gain&quot; &quot;A&quot;CL = . Equilibrium will be established when &quot;V&quot;out is just sufficient to pull the inverting input to the same voltage as &quot;V&quot;in. The voltage gain of the entire circuit is thus . As a simple example, if &quot;V&quot;in = 1 V and Rf = &quot;R&quot;g, &quot;V&quot;out will be 2 V, exactly the amount required to keep &quot;V&quot;− at 1 V. Because of the feedback provided by the &quot;R&quot;f, &quot;R&quot;g network, this is a &quot;closed-loop&quot; circuit.

Another way to analyze this circuit proceeds by making the following (usually valid) assumptions:
# When an op amp operates in linear (i.e., not saturated) mode, the difference in voltage between the non-inverting (+) and inverting (−) pins is negligibly small.
# The input impedance of the (+) and (−) pins is much larger than other resistances in the circuit.

The input signal &quot;V&quot;in appears at both (+) and (−) pins per assumption 1, resulting in a current &quot;i&quot; through &quot;R&quot;g equal to :
formula_2

Since Kirchhoff&#x27;s current law states that the same current must leave a node as enter it, and since the impedance into the (−) pin is near infinity per assumption 2, we can assume practically all of the same current &quot;i&quot; flows through &quot;R&quot;f, creating an output voltage
formula_3

By combining terms, we determine the closed-loop gain &quot;A&quot;CL:
formula_4

==Op-amp characteristics==

=== Ideal op amps ===
An ideal op amp is usually considered to have the following characteristics:

* Infinite open-loop gain &quot;G&quot; = &quot;v&quot;out / &quot;v&quot;in
* Infinite input impedance &quot;R&quot;in, and so zero input current 
* Zero input offset voltage 
* Infinite output voltage range
* Infinite bandwidth with zero phase shift and infinite slew rate 
* Zero output impedance &quot;R&quot;out, and so infinite output current range
* Zero noise
* Infinite common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR)
* Infinite power supply rejection ratio.
These ideals can be summarized by the two :
# In a closed loop the output does whatever is necessary to make the voltage difference between the inputs zero.
# The inputs draw zero current.

The first rule only applies in the usual case where the op amp is used in a closed-loop design (negative feedback, where there is a signal path of some sort feeding back from the output to the inverting input). These rules are commonly used as a good first approximation for analyzing or designing op-amp circuits.

None of these ideals can be perfectly realized. A real op amp may be modeled with non-infinite or non-zero parameters using equivalent resistors and capacitors in the op-amp model. The designer can then include these effects into the overall performance of the final circuit. Some parameters may turn out to have negligible effect on the final design while others represent actual limitations of the final performance.

=== Real op amps ===
Real op amps differ from the ideal model in various aspects.

;Finite gain
:Open-loop gain is finite in real operational amplifiers. Typical devices exhibit open-loop DC gain exceeding 100,000. So long as the loop gain (i.e., the product of open-loop and feedback gains) is very large, the closed-loop gain will be determined entirely by the amount of negative feedback (i.e., it will be independent of open-loop gain). In applications where the closed-loop gain must be very high (approaching the open-loop gain), the feedback gain will be very low and the lower loop gain in these cases causes non-ideal behavior from the circuit.
;Non-zero output impedance
:Low output impedance is important for low-impedance loads; for these loads, the voltage drop across the output impedance effectively reduces the open-loop gain. In configurations with a voltage-sensing negative feedback, the output impedance of the amplifier is effectively lowered; thus, in linear applications, op-amp circuits usually exhibit a very low output impedance.
:Low-impedance outputs typically require high quiescent (i.e., idle) current in the output stage and will dissipate more power, so low-power designs may purposely sacrifice low output impedance.
;Finite input impedances
:The &quot;differential input impedance&quot; of the operational amplifier is defined as the impedance &quot;between&quot; its two inputs; the &quot;common-mode input impedance&quot; is the impedance from each input to ground. MOSFET-input operational amplifiers often have protection circuits that effectively short circuit any input differences greater than a small threshold, so the input impedance can appear to be very low in some tests. However, as long as these operational amplifiers are used in a typical high-gain negative feedback application, these protection circuits will be inactive. The input bias and leakage currents described below are a more important design parameter for typical operational amplifier applications.
;Input capacitance
:Additional input impedance due to parasitic capacitance can be a critical issue for high-frequency operation where it reduces input impedance and may cause phase shifts.
;Input current
:Due to biasing requirements or leakage, a small amount of current flows into the inputs. When high resistances or sources with high output impedances are used in the circuit, these small currents can produce significant voltage drops. If the input currents are matched, &quot;and&quot; the impedance looking &quot;out&quot; of &quot;both&quot; inputs are matched, then those voltages at each input will be equal. Because the operational amplifier operates on the &quot;difference&quot; between its inputs, these matched voltages will have no effect. It is more common for the input currents to be slightly mismatched. The difference is called input offset current, and even with matched resistances a small &quot;offset voltage&quot; (distinct from the input offset voltage below) can be produced. This offset voltage can create offsets or drifting in the operational amplifier.
;Input offset voltage
:Input offset voltage is a voltage required across the op amp&#x27;s input terminals to drive the output voltage to zero. In the perfect amplifier, there would be no input offset voltage. However, it exists because of imperfections in the differential amplifier input stage of op amps. Input offset voltage creates two problems: First, due to the amplifier&#x27;s high voltage gain, it virtually assures that the amplifier output will go into saturation if it is operated without negative feedback, even when the input terminals are wired together. Second, in a closed loop, negative feedback configuration, the input offset voltage is amplified along with the signal and this may pose a problem if high precision DC amplification is required or if the input signal is very small.
;Common-mode gain
:A perfect operational amplifier amplifies only the voltage difference between its two inputs, completely rejecting all voltages that are common to both. However, the differential input stage of an operational amplifier is never perfect, leading to the amplification of these common voltages to some degree. The standard measure of this defect is called the common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR). Minimization of common-mode gain is important in non-inverting amplifiers that operate at high gain.
;Power-supply rejection
:The output of a perfect operational amplifier will be independent of power supply voltage fluctuations. Every real operational amplifier has a finite power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) that reflects how well the op amp can reject noise in its power supply from propagating to the output. With increasing frequency the power-supply rejection usually gets worse.
;Temperature effects
:Performance and properties of the amplifier typically changes, to some extent, with changes in temperature. Temperature drift of the input offset voltage is especially important. 
;Drift
:Real op-amp parameters are subject to slow change over time and with changes in temperature, input conditions, etc.
;Finite bandwidth
:All amplifiers have finite bandwidth. To a first approximation, the op amp has the frequency response of an integrator with gain. That is, the gain of a typical op amp is inversely proportional to frequency and is characterized by its gain–bandwidth product (GBWP). For example, an op amp with a GBWP of 1 MHz would have a gain of 5 at 200 kHz, and a gain of 1 at 1 MHz. This dynamic response coupled with the very high DC gain of the op amp gives it the characteristics of a first-order low-pass filter with very high DC gain and low cutoff frequency given by the GBWP divided by the DC gain.The finite bandwidth of an op amp can be the source of several problems, including:Typical low-cost, general-purpose op amps exhibit a GBWP of a few megahertz. Specialty and high-speed op amps exist that can achieve a GBWP of hundreds of megahertz. For very high-frequency circuits, a current-feedback operational amplifier is often used.
;Noise
:Amplifiers intrinsically output noise, even when there is no signal applied. This can be due to internal thermal noise and flicker noise of the device. For applications with high gain or high bandwidth, noise becomes an important consideration and a low-noise amplifier, which is specifically designed for minimum intrinsic noise, may be required to meet performance requirements.
====Non-linear imperfections====

;Saturation
:Output voltage is limited to a minimum and maximum value close to the power supply voltages. The output of older op amps can reach to within one or two volts of the supply rails. The output of so-called op amps can reach to within millivolts of the supply rails when providing low output currents.
;Slew rate limiting
:The amplifier&#x27;s output voltage reaches its maximum rate of change, the slew rate, usually specified in volts per microsecond (V/μs). When slew rate limiting occurs, further increases in the input signal have no effect on the rate of change of the output. Slew rate limiting is usually caused by the input stage saturating; the result is a constant current driving a capacitance in the amplifier (especially those capacitances used to implement its frequency compensation); the slew rate is limited by . Slewing is associated with the &quot;large-signal&quot; performance of an op amp. Consider, for example, an op amp configured for a gain of 10. Let the input be a 1V, 100 kHz sawtooth wave. That is, the amplitude is 1V and the period is 10 microseconds. Accordingly, the rate of change (i.e., the slope) of the input is 0.1 V per microsecond. After 10× amplification, the output should be a 10V, 100 kHz sawtooth, with a corresponding slew rate of 1V per microsecond. However, the classic 741 op amp has a 0.5V per microsecond slew rate specification so that its output can rise to no more than 5V in the sawtooth&#x27;s 10-microsecond period. Thus, if one were to measure the output, it would be a 5V, 100 kHz sawtooth, rather than a 10V, 100 kHz sawtooth.Next consider the same amplifier and 100 kHz sawtooth, but now the input amplitude is 100mV rather than 1V. After 10× amplification the output is a 1V, 100 kHz sawtooth with a corresponding slew rate of 0.1V per microsecond. In this instance, the 741 with its 0.5V per microsecond slew rate will amplify the input properly. Modern high-speed op amps can have slew rates in excess of 5,000V per microsecond. However, it is more common for op amps to have slew rates in the range 5–100V per microsecond. For example, the general purpose TL081 op amp has a slew rate of 13V per microsecond. As a general rule, low power and small bandwidth op amps have low slew rates. As an example, the LT1494 micropower op amp consumes 1.5 microamp but has a 2.7 kHz gain-bandwidth product and a 0.001V per microsecond slew rate.
;Non-linear input-output relationship
:The output voltage may not be accurately proportional to the difference between the input voltages producing distortion. This effect will be very small in a practical circuit where substantial negative feedback is used.
;Phase reversal
:In some integrated op amps, when the published common mode voltage is violated (e.g., by one of the inputs being driven to one of the supply voltages), the output may slew to the opposite polarity from what is expected in normal operation. Under such conditions, negative feedback becomes positive, likely causing the circuit to &quot;lock up&quot; in that state.

====Power considerations====
;Limited output current
:The output current must be finite. In practice, most op amps are designed to limit the output current to prevent damage to the device, typically around 25 mA for a type 741 IC op amp. Modern designs are electronically more robust than earlier implementations and some can sustain direct short circuits on their outputs without damage.
;Limited output voltage
:Output voltage cannot exceed the power supply voltage supplied to the op amp. The maximum output of most op amps is further reduced by some amount due to limitations in the output circuitry. &quot;Rail-to-rail op amps&quot; are designed for maximum output levels.
;Output sink current
:The output sink current is the maximum current allowed to sink into the output stage. Some manufacturers provide an output voltage vs. the output sink current plot which gives an idea of the output voltage when it is sinking current from another source into the output pin.
;Limited dissipated power
:The output current flows through the op amp&#x27;s internal output impedance, generating heat that must be dissipated. If the op amp dissipates too much power, then its temperature will increase above some safe limit. The op amp must shut down or risk being damaged.
Modern integrated FET or MOSFET op amps approximate more closely the ideal op amp than bipolar ICs when it comes to input impedance and input bias currents. Bipolars are generally better when it comes to input &quot;voltage&quot; offset, and often have lower noise. Generally, at room temperature, with a fairly large signal, and limited bandwidth, FET and MOSFET op amps now offer better performance.

== Internal circuitry of -type op amp ==
Sourced by many manufacturers, and in multiple similar products, an example of a bipolar transistor operational amplifier is the 741 integrated circuit designed in 1968 by David Fullagar at Fairchild Semiconductor after Bob Widlar&#x27;s LM301 integrated circuit design. 
In this discussion, we use the parameters of the hybrid-pi model to characterize the small-signal, grounded emitter characteristics of a transistor. In this model, the current gain of a transistor is denoted &quot;h&quot;fe, more commonly called the β.

=== Architecture ===
A small-scale integrated circuit, the 741 op amp shares with most op amps an internal structure consisting of three gain stages:
# Differential amplifier (outlined dark blue) — provides high differential amplification (gain), with rejection of common-mode signal, low noise, high input impedance, and drives a
# Voltage amplifier (outlined magenta) — provides high voltage gain, a single-pole frequency roll-off, and in turn drives the
# Output amplifier (outlined cyan and green) — provides high current gain (low output impedance), along with output current limiting, and output short-circuit protection.
Additionally, it contains current mirror (outlined red) bias circuitry and compensation capacitor (30 pF).

==== Differential amplifier ====
The input stage consists of a cascaded differential amplifier (outlined in dark blue) followed by a current-mirror active load. This constitutes a transconductance amplifier, turning a differential voltage signal at the bases of Q1, Q2 into a current signal into the base of Q15.

It entails two cascaded transistor pairs, satisfying conflicting requirements. The first stage consists of the matched NPN emitter follower pair Q1, Q2 that provide high input impedance. The second is the matched PNP common-base pair Q3, Q4 that eliminates the undesirable Miller effect; it drives an active load Q7 plus matched pair Q5, Q6.

That active load is implemented as a modified Wilson current mirror; its role is to convert the (differential) input current signal to a single-ended signal without the attendant 50% losses (increasing the op amp&#x27;s open-loop gain by 3 dB). Thus, a small-signal differential current in Q3 versus Q4 appears summed (doubled) at the base of Q15, the input of the voltage gain stage.

==== Voltage amplifier ====
The (class-A) voltage gain stage (outlined in magenta) consists of the two NPN transistors Q15 and Q19 connected in a Darlington configuration and uses the output side of current mirror formed by Q12 and Q13 as its collector (dynamic) load to achieve its high voltage gain. The output sink transistor Q20 receives its base drive from the common collectors of Q15 and Q19; the level-shifter Q16 provides base drive for the output source transistor Q14. The transistor Q22 prevents this stage from delivering excessive current to Q20 and thus limits the output sink current.

==== Output amplifier ====
The output stage (Q14, Q20, outlined in cyan) is a Class AB amplifier. It provides an output drive with impedance of ~50Ω, in essence, current gain. Transistor Q16 (outlined in green) provides the quiescent current for the output transistors and Q17 limits output source current.

=== Biasing circuits ===
Biasing circuits provide appropriate quiescent current for each stage of the op amp.

The resistor (39 kΩ) connecting the (diode-connected) Q11 and Q12, and the given supply voltage (&quot;V&quot;&quot;S&quot;+ − &quot;V&quot;&quot;S&quot;−), determine the current in the current mirrors, (matched pairs) Q10/Q11 and Q12/Q13. The collector current of Q11, &quot;i&quot;11 × 39 kΩ = &quot;V&quot;&quot;S&quot;+ − &quot;V&quot;&quot;S&quot;− − 2 &quot;V&quot;BE. For the typical &quot;V&quot;&quot;S&quot; = ±20 V, the standing current in Q11 and Q12 (as well as in Q13) would be ~1 mA. A supply current for a typical 741 of about 2 mA agrees with the notion that these two bias currents dominate the quiescent supply current.

Transistors Q11 and Q10 form a Widlar current mirror, with quiescent current in Q10 &quot;i&quot;10 such that ln(&quot;i&quot;11 / &quot;i&quot;10) = &quot;i&quot;10 × 5 kΩ / 28 mV, where 5 kΩ represents the emitter resistor of Q10, and 28 mV is &quot;V&quot;T, the thermal voltage at room temperature. In this case &quot;i&quot;10 ≈ 20 μA.

==== Differential amplifier ====
The biasing circuit of this stage is set by a feedback loop that forces the collector currents of Q10 and Q9 to (nearly) match. Any small difference in these currents provides drive for the common base of Q3 and Q4. The summed quiescent currents through Q1 and Q3 plus Q2 and Q4 is mirrored from Q8 into Q9, where it is summed with the collector current in Q10, the result being applied to the bases of Q3 and Q4.

The quiescent currents through Q1 and Q3 (also Q2 and Q4) &quot;i&quot;1 will thus be half of &quot;i&quot;10, of order ~10 μA. Input bias current for the base of Q1 (also Q2) will amount to &quot;i&quot;1 / β; typically ~50 nA, implying a current gain &quot;h&quot;fe ≈ 200 for Q1 (also Q2).

This feedback circuit tends to draw the common base node of Q3/Q4 to a voltage &quot;V&quot;com − 2 &quot;V&quot;BE, where &quot;V&quot;com is the input common-mode voltage. At the same time, the magnitude of the quiescent current is relatively insensitive to the characteristics of the components Q1–Q4, such as &quot;h&quot;fe, that would otherwise cause temperature dependence or part-to-part variations.

Transistor Q7 drives Q5 and Q6 into conduction until their (equal) collector currents match that of Q1/Q3 and Q2/Q4. The quiescent current in Q7 is &quot;V&quot;BE / 50 kΩ, about 35 μA, as is the quiescent current in Q15, with its matching operating point. Thus, the quiescent currents are pairwise matched in Q1/Q2, Q3/Q4, Q5/Q6, and Q7/Q15.

==== Voltage amplifier ====
Quiescent currents in Q16 and Q19 are set by the current mirror Q12/Q13, which is running at ~1 mA. The collector current in Q19 tracks that standing current.

==== Output amplifier ====
In the circuit involving Q16 (variously named rubber diode or &quot;V&quot;BE multiplier), the 4.5 kΩ resistor must be conducting about 100 μA, with Q16 &quot;V&quot;BE roughly 700 mV. Then &quot;V&quot;CB must be about 0.45 V and &quot;V&quot;CE at about 1.0 V. Because the Q16 collector is driven by a current source and the Q16 emitter drives into the Q19 collector current sink, the Q16 transistor establishes a voltage difference between the Q14 base and the Q20 base of ~1 V, regardless of the common-mode voltage of Q14/Q20 bases. The standing current in Q14/Q20 will be a factor exp(100 mV mm/ &quot;V&quot;T) ≈ 36 smaller than the 1 mA quiescent current in the class A portion of the op amp. This (small) standing current in the output transistors establishes the output stage in class AB operation and reduces the crossover distortion of this stage.

=== Small-signal differential mode ===
A small differential input voltage signal gives rise, through multiple stages of current amplification, to a much larger voltage signal on output.

==== Input impedance ====
The input stage with Q1 and Q3 is similar to an emitter-coupled pair (long-tailed pair), with Q2 and Q4 adding some degenerating impedance. The input impedance is relatively high because of the small current through Q1-Q4. A typical 741 op amp has a differential input impedance of about 2 MΩ. The common mode input impedance is even higher, as the input stage works at an essentially constant current.

==== Differential amplifier ====
A differential voltage &quot;V&quot;in at the op amp inputs (pins 3 and 2, respectively) gives rise to a small differential current in the bases of Q1 and Q2 &quot;i&quot;in ≈ &quot;V&quot;in / (2&quot;h&quot;ie&quot;h&quot;fe). This differential base current causes a change in the differential collector current in each leg by &quot;i&quot;in&quot;h&quot;fe. Introducing the transconductance of Q1, &quot;g&quot;&quot;m&quot; = &quot;h&quot;fe / &quot;h&quot;ie, the (small-signal) current at the base of Q15 (the input of the voltage gain stage) is &quot;V&quot;in&quot;g&quot;&quot;m&quot; / 2.

This portion of the op amp cleverly changes a differential signal at the op amp inputs to a single-ended signal at the base of Q15, and in a way that avoids wastefully discarding the signal in either leg. To see how, notice that a small negative change in voltage at the inverting input (Q2 base) drives it out of conduction, and this incremental decrease in current passes directly from Q4 collector to its emitter, resulting in a decrease in base drive for Q15. On the other hand, a small positive change in voltage at the non-inverting input (Q1 base) drives this transistor into conduction, reflected in an increase in current at the collector of Q3. This current drives Q7 further into conduction, which turns on current mirror Q5/Q6. Thus, the increase in Q3 emitter current is mirrored in an increase in Q6 collector current; the increased collector currents shunts more from the collector node and results in a decrease in base drive current for Q15. Besides avoiding wasting 3 dB of gain here, this technique decreases common-mode gain and feedthrough of power supply noise.

==== Voltage amplifier ====
A current signal &quot;i&quot; at Q15&#x27;s base gives rise to a current in Q19 of order &quot;i&quot;β2 (the product of the &quot;h&quot;fe of each of Q15 and Q19, which are connected in a Darlington pair). This current signal develops a voltage at the bases of output transistors Q14 and Q20 proportional to the &quot;h&quot;ie of the respective transistor.

==== Output amplifier ====
Output transistors Q14 and Q20 are each configured as an emitter follower, so no voltage gain occurs there; instead, this stage provides current gain, equal to the &quot;h&quot;fe of Q14 and Q20.

The current gain lowers the output impedance and although the output impedance is not zero, as it would be in an ideal op amp, with negative feedback it approaches zero at low frequencies.

=== Other linear characteristics ===

==== Overall open-loop gain ====
The net open-loop small-signal voltage gain of the op amp is determined by the product of the current gain &quot;h&quot;fe of some 4 transistors. In practice, the voltage gain for a typical 741-style op amp is of order 200,000, and the current gain, the ratio of input impedance (~2−6MΩ) to output impedance (~50Ω) provides yet more (power) gain.

==== Small-signal common mode gain ====
The ideal op amp has infinite common-mode rejection ratio, or zero common-mode gain.

In the present circuit, if the input voltages change in the same direction, the negative feedback makes Q3/Q4 base voltage follow (with 2 &quot;V&quot;BE below) the input voltage variations. Now the output part (Q10) of Q10-Q11 current mirror keeps up the common current through Q9/Q8 constant in spite of varying voltage. Q3/Q4 collector currents, and accordingly the output current at the base of Q15, remain unchanged.

In the typical 741 op amp, the common-mode rejection ratio is 90 dB, implying an open-loop common-mode voltage gain of about 6.

==== Frequency compensation ====
The innovation of the Fairchild μA741 was the introduction of frequency compensation via an on-chip (monolithic) capacitor, simplifying application of the op amp by eliminating the need for external components for this function. The 30 pF capacitor stabilizes the amplifier via Miller compensation and functions in a manner similar to an op-amp integrator circuit. Also known as &quot;dominant pole compensation&quot; because it introduces a pole that masks (dominates) the effects of other poles into the open loop frequency response; in a 741 op amp this pole can be as low as 10 Hz (where it causes a −3 dB loss of open loop voltage gain).

This internal compensation is provided to achieve unconditional stability of the amplifier in negative feedback configurations where the feedback network is non-reactive and the loop gain is unity or higher. In contrast, amplifiers requiring external compensation, such as the μA748, may require external compensation or closed-loop gains significantly higher than unity.

==== Input offset voltage ====
The &quot;offset null&quot; pins may be used to place external resistors (typically in the form of the two ends of a potentiometer, with the slider connected to &quot;V&quot;&quot;S&quot;–) in parallel with the emitter resistors of Q5 and Q6, to adjust the balance of the Q5/Q6 current mirror. The potentiometer is adjusted such that the output is null (midrange) when the inputs are shorted together.

=== Non-linear characteristics ===

==== Input breakdown voltage ====
The transistors Q3, Q4 help to increase the reverse &quot;V&quot;BE rating; The base-emitter junctions of the NPN transistors Q1 and Q2 break down at around 7V, but the PNP transistors Q3 and Q4 have &quot;V&quot;BE breakdown voltages around 50V.

==== Output-stage voltage swing and current limiting ====
Variations in the quiescent current with temperature, or due to manufacturing variations, are common, so crossover distortion may be subject to significant variation.

The output range of the amplifier is about one volt less than the supply voltage, owing in part to &quot;V&quot;BE of the output transistors Q14 and Q20.

The resistor at the Q14 emitter, along with Q17, limits Q14 current to about ; otherwise, Q17 conducts no current. Current limiting for Q20 is performed in the voltage gain stage: Q22 senses the voltage across Q19&#x27;s emitter resistor (); as it turns on, it diminishes the drive current to Q15 base. Later versions of this amplifier schematic may show a somewhat different method of output current limiting.

===Applicability considerations===
While the 741 was historically used in audio and other sensitive equipment, such use is now rare because of the improved noise performance of more modern op amps. Apart from generating noticeable hiss, 741s and other older op amps may have poor common-mode rejection ratios and so will often introduce cable-borne mains hum and other common-mode interference, such as switch &quot;clicks&quot;, into sensitive equipment.

The &quot;741&quot; has come to often mean a generic op-amp IC (such as μA741, LM301, 558, LM324, TBA221 — or a more modern replacement such as the TL071). The description of the 741 output stage is qualitatively similar for many other designs (that may have quite different input stages), except:
* Some devices (μA748, LM301, LM308) are not internally compensated (require an external capacitor from output to some point within the operational amplifier, if used in low closed-loop gain applications).
* Some modern devices have &quot;rail-to-rail&quot; output capability, meaning that the output can range from within a few millivolts of the positive supply voltage to within a few millivolts of the negative supply voltage.

== Classification ==
Op amps may be classified by their construction:
* discrete, built from individual transistors or tubes/valves,
* hybrid, consisting of discrete and integrated components,
* full integrated circuits — most common, having displaced the former two due to low cost.
IC op amps may be classified in many ways, including:
* Device grade, including acceptable operating temperature ranges and other environmental or quality factors. For example: LM101, LM201, and LM301 refer to the military, industrial, and commercial versions of the same component. Military and industrial-grade components offer better performance in harsh conditions than their commercial counterparts but are sold at higher prices.
* Classification by package type may also affect environmental hardiness, as well as manufacturing options; DIP, and other through-hole packages are tending to be replaced by surface-mount devices.
* Classification by internal compensation: op amps may suffer from high frequency instability in some negative feedback circuits unless a small compensation capacitor modifies the phase and frequency responses. Op amps with a built-in capacitor are termed &quot;compensated&quot;, and allow circuits above some specified closed-loop gain to be stable with no external capacitor. In particular, op amps that are stable even with a closed loop gain of 1 are called &quot;unity gain compensated&quot;.
* Single, dual and quad versions of many commercial op-amp IC are available, meaning 1, 2 or 4 operational amplifiers are included in the same package.
* Rail-to-rail input (and/or output) op amps can work with input (and/or output) signals very close to the power supply rails.
* CMOS op amps (such as the CA3140E) provide extremely high input resistances, higher than JFET-input op amps, which are normally higher than bipolar-input op amps.
* Programmable op amps allow the quiescent current, bandwidth and so on to be adjusted by an external resistor.
* Manufacturers often market their op amps according to purpose, such as low-noise pre-amplifiers, wide bandwidth amplifiers, and so on.

== Applications ==

=== Use in electronics system design ===

The use of op amps as circuit blocks is much easier and clearer than specifying all their individual circuit elements (transistors, resistors, etc.), whether the amplifiers used are integrated or discrete circuits. In the first approximation op amps can be used as if they were ideal differential gain blocks; at a later stage, limits can be placed on the acceptable range of parameters for each op amp.

Circuit design follows the same lines for all electronic circuits. A specification is drawn up governing what the circuit is required to do, with allowable limits. For example, the gain may be required to be 100 times, with a tolerance of 5% but drift of less than 1% in a specified temperature range; the input impedance not less than one megohm; etc.

A basic circuit is designed, often with the help of electronic circuit simulation. Specific commercially available op amps and other components are then chosen that meet the design criteria within the specified tolerances at acceptable cost. If not all criteria can be met, the specification may need to be modified.

A prototype is then built and tested; additional changes to meet or improve the specification, alter functionality, or reduce the cost, may be made.

=== Applications without feedback ===
Without feedback, the op amp may be used as a voltage comparator. Note that a device designed primarily as a comparator may be better if, for instance, speed is important or a wide range of input voltages may be found since such devices can quickly recover from full-on or full-off &quot;saturated&quot; states.

A &quot;voltage level detector&quot; can be obtained if a reference voltage &quot;V&quot;ref is applied to one of the op amp&#x27;s inputs. This means that the op amp is set up as a comparator to detect a positive voltage. If the voltage to be sensed, &quot;E&quot;i, is applied to op amp&#x27;s (+) input, the result is a noninverting positive-level detector: when &quot;E&quot;i is above &quot;V&quot;ref, &quot;V&quot;O equals +&quot;V&quot;sat; when &quot;E&quot;i is below &quot;V&quot;ref, &quot;V&quot;O equals −&quot;V&quot;sat. If &quot;E&quot;i is applied to the inverting input, the circuit is an inverting positive-level detector: When &quot;E&quot;i is above &quot;V&quot;ref, &quot;V&quot;O equals −&quot;V&quot;sat.

A &quot;zero voltage level detector&quot; (&quot;E&quot;i = 0) can convert, for example, the output of a sine-wave from a function generator into a variable-frequency square wave. If &quot;E&quot;i is a sine wave, triangular wave, or wave of any other shape that is symmetrical around zero, the zero-crossing detector&#x27;s output will be square. Zero-crossing detection may also be useful in triggering TRIACs at the best time to reduce mains interference and current spikes.

===Positive-feedback applications===

Another typical configuration of op amps is with positive feedback, which takes a fraction of the output signal back to the non-inverting input. An important application of positive feedback is the comparator with hysteresis, the Schmitt trigger. 

Some circuits may use &quot;positive&quot; feedback and &quot;negative&quot; feedback around the same amplifier, for example triangle-wave oscillators and active filters.

===Negative-feedback applications===

==== Non-inverting amplifier ====

In a non-inverting amplifier, the output voltage changes in the same direction as the input voltage.

The gain equation for the op amp is
:formula_5

However, in this circuit &quot;V&quot;− is a function of &quot;V&quot;out because of the negative feedback through the &quot;R&quot;1 &quot;R&quot;2 network. &quot;R&quot;1 and &quot;R&quot;2 form a voltage divider, and as &quot;V&quot;− is a high-impedance input, it does not load it appreciably. Consequently
:formula_6

where
:formula_7

Substituting this into the gain equation, we obtain
:formula_8

Solving for formula_9:
:formula_10

If formula_11 is very large, this simplifies to
:formula_12

The non-inverting input of the operational amplifier needs a path for DC to ground; if the signal source does not supply a DC path, or if that source requires a given load impedance, then the circuit will require another resistor from the non-inverting input to ground. When the operational amplifier&#x27;s input bias currents are significant, then the DC source resistances driving the inputs should be balanced. The ideal value for the feedback resistors (to give minimal offset voltage) will be such that the two resistances in parallel roughly equal the resistance to ground at the non-inverting input pin. That ideal value assumes the bias currents are well matched, which may not be true for all op amps.

==== Inverting amplifier ====
In an inverting amplifier, the output voltage changes in an opposite direction to the input voltage.

As with the non-inverting amplifier, we start with the gain equation of the op amp:

:formula_5

This time, &quot;V&quot;− is a function of both &quot;V&quot;out and &quot;V&quot;in due to the voltage divider formed by &quot;R&quot;f and &quot;R&quot;in. Again, the op-amp input does not apply an appreciable load, so

:formula_14

Substituting this into the gain equation and solving for formula_9:

:formula_16

If formula_11 is very large, this simplifies to

:formula_18

A resistor is often inserted between the non-inverting input and ground (so both inputs see similar resistances), reducing the input offset voltage due to different voltage drops due to bias current, and may reduce distortion in some op amps.

A DC-blocking capacitor may be inserted in series with the input resistor when a frequency response down to DC is not needed and any DC voltage on the input is unwanted. That is, the capacitive component of the input impedance inserts a DC zero and a low-frequency pole that gives the circuit a bandpass or high-pass characteristic.

The potentials at the operational amplifier inputs remain virtually constant (near ground) in the inverting configuration. The constant operating potential typically results in distortion levels that are lower than those attainable with the non-inverting topology.

===Other applications===

* audio and video preamplifiers and buffers
* differential amplifiers
* differentiators and integrators
* filters
* precision rectifiers
* precision peak detectors
* voltage and current regulators
* analog calculators
* analog-to-digital converters
* digital-to-analog converters
* oscillators and signal generators
* clipper
* clamper (dc inserter or restorer)
* log and antilog amplifiers

Most single, dual and quad op amps available have a standardized pin-out which permits one type to be substituted for another without wiring changes. A specific op amp may be chosen for its open loop gain, bandwidth, noise performance, input impedance, power consumption, or a compromise between any of these factors.

==Historical timeline==
1941: A vacuum tube op amp. An op amp, defined as a general-purpose, DC-coupled, high gain, inverting feedback amplifier, is first found in &quot;Summing Amplifier&quot; filed by Karl D. Swartzel Jr. of Bell Labs in 1941. This design used three vacuum tubes to achieve a gain of and operated on voltage rails of . It had a single inverting input rather than differential inverting and non-inverting inputs, as are common in today&#x27;s op amps. Throughout World War II, Swartzel&#x27;s design proved its value by being liberally used in the M9 artillery director designed at Bell Labs. This artillery director worked with the SCR584 radar system to achieve extraordinary hit rates (near 90%) that would not have been possible otherwise.

1947: An op amp with an explicit non-inverting input. In 1947, the operational amplifier was first formally defined and named in a paper by John R. Ragazzini of Columbia University. In this same paper a footnote mentioned an op-amp design by a student that would turn out to be quite significant. This op amp, designed by Loebe Julie, was superior in a variety of ways. It had two major innovations. Its input stage used a long-tailed triode pair with loads matched to reduce drift in the output and, far more importantly, it was the first op-amp design to have two inputs (one inverting, the other non-inverting). The differential input made a whole range of new functionality possible, but it would not be used for a long time due to the rise of the chopper-stabilized amplifier.

1949: A chopper-stabilized op amp. In 1949, Edwin A. Goldberg designed a chopper-stabilized op amp. This set-up uses a normal op amp with an additional AC amplifier that goes alongside the op amp. The chopper gets an AC signal from DC by switching between the DC voltage and ground at a fast rate (60 Hz or 400 Hz). This signal is then amplified, rectified, filtered and fed into the op amp&#x27;s non-inverting input. This vastly improved the gain of the op amp while significantly reducing the output drift and DC offset. Unfortunately, any design that used a chopper couldn&#x27;t use their non-inverting input for any other purpose. Nevertheless, the much improved characteristics of the chopper-stabilized op amp made it the dominant way to use op amps. Techniques that used the non-inverting input regularly would not be very popular until the 1960s when op-amp ICs started to show up in the field.

1953: A commercially available op amp. In 1953, vacuum tube op amps became commercially available with the release of the model K2-W from George A. Philbrick Researches, Incorporated. The designation on the devices shown, GAP/R, is an acronym for the complete company name. Two nine-pin 12AX7 vacuum tubes were mounted in an octal package and had a model K2-P chopper add-on available that would effectively &quot;use up&quot; the non-inverting input. This op amp was based on a descendant of Loebe Julie&#x27;s 1947 design and, along with its successors, would start the widespread use of op amps in industry.

1961: A discrete IC op amp. With the birth of the transistor in 1947, and the silicon transistor in 1954, the concept of ICs became a reality. The introduction of the planar process in 1959 made transistors and ICs stable enough to be commercially useful. By 1961, solid-state, discrete op amps were being produced. These op amps were effectively small circuit boards with packages such as edge connectors. They usually had hand-selected resistors in order to improve things such as voltage offset and drift. The P45 (1961) had a gain of 94 dB and ran on ±15 V rails. It was intended to deal with signals in the range of .

1961: A varactor bridge op amp. There have been many different directions taken in op-amp design. Varactor bridge op amps started to be produced in the early 1960s. They were designed to have extremely small input current and are still amongst the best op amps available in terms of common-mode rejection with the ability to correctly deal with hundreds of volts at their inputs.

1962: An op amp in a potted module. By 1962, several companies were producing modular potted packages that could be plugged into printed circuit boards. These packages were crucially important as they made the operational amplifier into a single black box which could be easily treated as a component in a larger circuit.

1963: A monolithic IC op amp. In 1963, the first monolithic IC op amp, the μA702 designed by Bob Widlar at Fairchild Semiconductor, was released. Monolithic ICs consist of a single chip as opposed to a chip and discrete parts (a discrete IC) or multiple chips bonded and connected on a circuit board (a hybrid IC). Almost all modern op amps are monolithic ICs; however, this first IC did not meet with much success. Issues such as an uneven supply voltage, low gain and a small dynamic range held off the dominance of monolithic op amps until 1965 when the μA709 (also designed by Bob Widlar) was released.

1968: Release of the μA741. The popularity of monolithic op amps was further improved upon the release of the LM101 in 1967, which solved a variety of issues, and the subsequent release of the μA741 in 1968. The μA741 was extremely similar to the LM101 except that Fairchild&#x27;s facilities allowed them to include a 30 pF compensation capacitor inside the chip instead of requiring external compensation. This simple difference has made the 741 &quot;the&quot; canonical op amp and many modern amps base their pinout on the 741s. The μA741 is still in production, and has become ubiquitous in electronics—many manufacturers produce a version of this classic chip, recognizable by part numbers containing &quot;741&quot;. The same part is manufactured by several companies.

1970: First high-speed, low-input current FET design.
In the 1970s high speed, low-input current designs started to be made by using FETs. These would be largely replaced by op amps made with MOSFETs in the 1980s. 
1972: Single sided supply op amps being produced. A single sided supply op amp is one where the input and output voltages can be as low as the negative power supply voltage instead of needing to be at least two volts above it. The result is that it can operate in many applications with the negative supply pin on the op amp being connected to the signal ground, thus eliminating the need for a separate negative power supply.

The LM324 (released in 1972) was one such op amp that came in a quad package (four separate op amps in one package) and became an industry standard. In addition to packaging multiple op amps in a single package, the 1970s also saw the birth of op amps in hybrid packages. These op amps were generally improved versions of existing monolithic op amps. As the properties of monolithic op amps improved, the more complex hybrid ICs were quickly relegated to systems that are required to have extremely long service lives or other specialty systems.

Recent trends. Recently supply voltages in analog circuits have decreased (as they have in digital logic) and low-voltage op amps have been introduced reflecting this. Supplies of 5 V and increasingly 3.3 V (sometimes as low as 1.8 V) are common. To maximize the signal range modern op amps commonly have rail-to-rail output (the output signal can range from the lowest supply voltage to the highest) and sometimes rail-to-rail inputs.

<text>Oh hell or contract whist is a trick-taking card game of British origin in which the object is to take exactly the number of tricks bid. It was first described by B. C. Westall around 1930 and originally called oh! well. It was said to have been introduced into America via the New York clubs in 1931. Phillips and Westall describe it as &quot;one of the best round games&quot;.

== Name ==

This English game was originally called oh! well, but is often known as contract whist in Britain and, less commonly, as nomination whist, while American sources call it oh pshaw or more frequently oh hell. David Parlett gives other names: blackout, bust, elevator and jungle bridge; while John McLeod adds blob, so called because the player&#x27;s predicted bid is overwritten with a black blob if not achieved.

==Concept==
The game explores the idea of taking an exact number of tricks specified by a bid after the deal. Although the original game was played to 100 points, the modern variants differ from other trick-taking games in that players play a fixed number of deals. The game uses trumps, often decided by turning a card after the cards have been distributed. Like many popular social card games, the game has many local and regional variants in rules and variations in names.

==Famous players==
Prominent players of the game include former United States President Bill Clinton, who learned it from film director Steven Spielberg.

== History ==
The rules are first described by B. C. Westall around 1930 under the name oh! well, and continued to be reprinted by Hubert Phillips until at least 1976. The game was introduced into the United States very shortly after appearing in Britain and was first recorded in the New York clubs in 1931. In these early rules, the number of cards dealt was fixed depending on the number of players and game was 100 points.

Over the decades the game has been elaborated both in Britain and the United States, usually by increasing or decreasing the number of cards dealt per round, e.g., increasing the number from one to seven, from three to seventeen, or from seven to one and back to seven again. The game has many alternative names, but &quot;oh hell&quot; is by far the most common.

The original version, known as &quot;oh! well&quot;, was described as &quot;one of the best round games&quot;.

== Rules ==
Four main variants are described below: the original British game known as oh! well, in which the number of cards dealt is the same every time (⇒), and three common modern variants. Nomination Whist is a British variant in which cards are dealt in &quot;descending and ascending&quot; (⇘⇗) sequence. In Australia and New Zealand this form is called, appropriately, &#x27;Up and Down the River&#x27;. Oh Pshaw is an American name for the variant in which cards are dealt in &quot;ascending&quot; (⇗) sequence only (although Parlett describes a similar game as &#x27;British Oh Hell&#x27;). Finally, the game as described below is a variant popular worldwide in which cards are also dealt in &quot;descending and ascending&quot; sequence (⇘⇗).

=== Common rules ===
There are common rules that apply to all four variants and will not be repeated. There are three to seven players. A standard pack is used and cards rank in their normal order, Aces high. Deal, bidding and play are clockwise, always beginning with eldest hand, the player to the left of the dealer. The aim is to score the most points by correctly bidding the number of tricks you will take. To that end, a bidding round takes place after the cards are dealt; eldest hand begins by announcing the number of tricks s/he thinks s/he can take, e.g., &quot;none&quot; or &quot;five&quot;, and the other players follow in turn. During play, eldest leads to the first trick and players must follow suit if able; otherwise they may trump or discard as they wish. The highest trump wins the trick or, if no trumps are played, the highest card of the led suit wins. The trick winner leads to the next trick.

=== Oh! well ===
Phillips and Westall describe &quot;oh! well&quot; as &quot;one of the best round games&quot;, not only appealing to expert players, but also to beginners and youngsters because of the simplicity of its rules, which are as above with the following additional details:

If three play, the bottom card of the pack is removed and set aside face down. If five, six or seven play, then 2, 4 or 3 cards, respectively, are removed from the bottom of the pack. Otherwise the full pack is used. The dealer distributes the cards and turns the last, which is his, for trump. The dealer or scribe records the bids. The same number of cards is dealt in each deal (⇒).

Players score 1 point for each trick taken. In addition, any player who achieves scores a bonus of 10 points. Game is 100 points. If played for stakes, players pay the differences in their points converted into money at the agreed rate. Alternatively players ante a stake to the pool and the winner takes all.

=== Contract whist ===
In Britain a derivative of oh! well is played, known as contract whist or, less frequently, as nomination whist. The main difference is that the deals follow a &quot;descending and ascending&quot;(⇘⇗) sequence, in that the number of cards dealt starts at seven and decreases each time by one until only one card is dealt; it then rises again until finally seven cards are dealt again (7–1–7). The following rules are based on Arnold (2011):

Cards are dealt and the first one to receive a jack becomes the first dealer. Seven cards are then dealt to each player, one by one; the rest of the pack is placed face down as the stock and the top card turned for trump. In subsequent deals, the number of cards dealt reduces by one each time, so that by the seventh deal each player receives just one. In the eighth deal players receive two cards each and in the deals that follow, the number of cards dealt increases by one each time. The thirteenth deal is the last; seven cards are dealt and the game ends when it is over.

In the bidding, the dealer, who goes last as usual, must ensure that the total number of bids is not equal to the number of cards each player holds, thereby making it impossible for all players to make their bids.

As in oh! well, players score 1 point per trick and a bonus of 10 points if they achieve their bids. Otherwise the rules are as described above.

In a variation, the trump suit is fixed each time, rotating in the order: .

Note that the name Nomination whist is given to at least two other games.

===Up and down the river===
In this Australian and Kiwi version, there are four to eight players, each dealt 10 cards in the first deal. Again the cards dealt follow a &quot;descending and ascending&quot;(⇘⇗) sequence, the number reducing by one each time until each player receives just one card. The sequence then ascends to 10 cards for a total of 19 deals (10–1–10). Again, the dealer must ensure bids do not add up to the number of tricks in the deal. Players score 1 point for each trick taken plus 10 points for achieving their bid.

=== Oh Pshaw ===
Oh Pshaw is an American variant recorded by &quot;Bicycle&quot;, who describe it as &quot;an amusing game&quot; with a worldwide following. It is an &quot;ascending only&quot; (⇗) variant and the rules are as described above with the following additions:

&quot;Bicycle&quot; says that 4 to 5 players are optimal. The game consists of a fixed number of deals. In the first, the dealer distributes one card to each player and turns the next for trump. In subsequent deals, the number of cards given to each player increases by one each time up to the maximum possible. So for example, if four play, there will be 13 deals. If three play, &quot;Bicycle&quot; advises limiting the game to 15 deals, rather than the theoretical maximum of 17. If no cards are left over in the last deal, the game is played at no trump.

Like oh! well, but unlike contract whist, there is no restriction on the dealer as to the number of tricks s/he may bid. However, the scorekeeper must announce whether the bid total is &quot;over&quot;, &quot;under&quot; or &quot;even&quot; compared with the available number of tricks in the deal/number of cards each player holds.

The normal scoring scheme is that players who achieve their bid score 1 point for each trick taken plus 10 bonus points. Players who fail to achieve their bid score nothing. The player with the highest score at the end of the game is the winner. If played for hard score, the winner is given a further 10 point bonus and then players settle with one another based on the difference in their scores. Scoring variations include all players receiving 1 point per trick taken whether or not they achieve their bid; those who do achieve their bid still earn a bonus of 10; and players who announce a bid of “None” may score 5 points, 10 points, or 5 points plus 1 point for each trick in the deal, depending on local rules.

====British variant====
Oh Pshaw as described by &quot;Bicycle&quot; is almost identical with another &quot;ascending only&quot; (⇗) variant that Parlett calls British oh hell! Again, the number of cards dealt ascends from one to a number dependent on the number of players. There are no trumps if all the cards are dealt and there is no restriction on the dealer&#x27;s bid. Players only score for the bonus, not the tricks. In a further variation, players bid simultaneously by clenching fists on the table and, on a signal being given, extending as many fingers as they intend to bid.

=== Oh hell ===
In the game as described by John McLeod at pagat.com, players draw for the first deal, the highest card winning. If three to five play, 10 cards are dealt to each player in the first deal; if six play, 8 cards, and, if seven play, 7 cards. Thereafter the number of cards dealt follows a &quot;descending and ascending&quot; (⇘⇗) sequence. So if 4 play, there are 19 deals (10–1–10); in the first and last deals 10 cards are dealt and, for example, in the 10th deal only one card is dealt per player.

Again, in this variant, the dealer is constrained to ensure that the total of the bids is not equal to the number of tricks in that deal. This is known as the &quot;hook&quot;. Cards are dealt and the next turned for trump.

There is a scorekeeper who keeps track of the bids and scores. McLeod describes two main systems:
* Simple scoring. The simplest system is that only players who achieve their bid exactly score any points. They score 1 point per trick plus a bonus of 10. Players who fail to match their bid score nothing. Games with this scoring are often called blackout or blob because the scorer writes a &quot;1&quot; in front of bids that were successful and scribbles out those that failed, so that they look like a black blob.
* Common scoring. The most widespread scoring scheme is to award all players 1 point per trick. In addition, those who match their bid exactly score the bonus of 10 as well. This gives everyone &quot;a slight incentive&quot; to try and take as many tricks as they can.
* Another variant includes scoring 10 plus the number of tricks taken for any bid above zero. For zero hands, the scoring is 5 plus the number of tricks available. This accounts for the relative ease of making zero hands early on and the increasing difficulty in later hands when more tricks are being bid on.
