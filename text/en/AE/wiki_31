<text>The major scale (or Ionian mode) is one of the most commonly used musical scales, especially in Western music. It is one of the diatonic scales. Like many musical scales, it is made up of seven notes: the eighth duplicates the first at double its frequency so that it is called a higher octave of the same note (from Latin &quot;octavus&quot;, the eighth).

The simplest major scale to write is C major, the only major scale not requiring sharps or flats:

The major scale has a central importance in Western music, particularly that of the common practice period and in popular music.

In Carnatic music, it is known as &quot;Sankarabharanam&quot;. In Hindustani classical music, it is known as &quot;Bilaval&quot;.

==Structure==


A major scale is a diatonic scale. The sequence of intervals between the notes of a major scale is:

: whole, whole, half, whole, whole, whole, half

where &quot;whole&quot; stands for a whole tone (a red u-shaped curve in the figure), and &quot;half&quot; stands for a semitone (a red angled line in the figure).

Whole steps and half steps are explained mathematically in a related article, Twelfth root of two. Notably, an equal-tempered octave has twelve half steps (semitones) spaced equally in terms of the sound frequency ratio. The sound frequency doubles for corresponding notes from one octave to the next. The ratio is 3/2 = 1.5 for a perfect fifth, for example from C to G on a major scale, and 5/4 = 1.25 for a major third, for example from C to E.

A major scale may be seen as two identical tetrachords separated by a whole tone. Each tetrachord consists of two whole tones followed by a semitone (i.e. whole, whole, half).

The major scale is maximally even.

===Scale degrees===
The scale degrees are:

*1st: Tonic
*2nd: Supertonic
*3rd: Mediant
*4th: Subdominant
*5th: Dominant
*6th: Submediant
*7th: Leading tone
*8th: Tonic

=== Triad qualities ===
The triads built on each scale degree follow a distinct pattern. The roman numeral analysis is shown in parentheses.
* 1st: Major triad (I)
* 2nd: minor triad (ii)
* 3rd: minor triad (iii)
* 4th: Major triad (IV)
* 5th: Major triad (V)
* 6th: minor triad (vi)
* 7th: diminished triad (viio)

=== Seventh chord qualities ===

&lt;/score&gt;}}

The seventh chords built on each scale degree follow a distinct pattern. The roman numeral analysis is shown in parentheses.
* 1st: Major seventh chord (IM7)
* 2nd: minor seventh chord (ii7)
* 3rd: minor seventh chord (iii7)
* 4th: Major seventh chord (IVM7)
* 5th: Dominant seventh chord (V7)
* 6th: minor seventh chord (vi7)
* 7th: half-diminished seventh chord (viiø7)

==Relationship to major keys==
If a piece of music (or part of a piece of music) is in a major key, then the notes in the corresponding major scale are considered &quot;diatonic&quot; notes, while the notes &quot;outside&quot; the major scale are considered &quot;chromatic&quot; notes. Moreover, the key signature of the piece of music (or section) will generally reflect the accidentals in the corresponding major scale.

For instance, if a piece of music is in E major, then the seven pitches in the E major scale (E, F, G, A, B, C and D) are considered diatonic pitches, and the other five pitches (E, F/G, A, B, and C/D) are considered chromatic pitches. In this case, the key signature will have three flats (B, E, and A).

The figure below shows all 12 relative major and minor keys, with major keys on the outside and minor keys on the inside arranged around the circle of fifths.

The numbers inside the circle show the number of sharps or flats in the key signature, with the sharp keys going clockwise, and the flat keys counterclockwise from C major (which has no sharps or flats.) The circular arrangement depends on enharmonic relationships in the circle, usually reckoned at six sharps or flats for the major keys of F = G and D = E for minor keys. Seven sharps or flats make major keys (C major or C major) that may be more conveniently spelled with five flats or sharps (as D major or B major).

==Broader sense==
The term &quot;major scale&quot; is also used in the names of some other scales whose first, third, and fifth degrees form a major triad.

The harmonic major scale has a minor sixth. It differs from the harmonic minor scale only by raising the third degree.

The melodic major scale is the combined scale that goes as Ionian ascending and as Aeolian dominant descending. It differs from melodic minor scale only by raising the third degree to a major third.
The double harmonic major scale has a minor second and a minor sixth. It is the fifth mode of the Hungarian minor scale.

== Other notations and usage ==
(As shown in this ,) when expressing the names of major scale keys as abbreviations, the alphabet of the corresponding tonic note name can be written in upper case to indicate only the tonic note name. For example, when expressing the English notation of C major, It can be abbreviated as &#x27;C&#x27;. Plus, when expressing the names of minor scale keys as abbreviations, the Roman alphabet of the corresponding tonic note is sometimes lower case to indicate only the tonic note name. For example, when expressing the English notation of A minor, It is abbreviated as &#x27;a&#x27;.

<doc id="20760" wikidata="Q236" url="?curid=20760" title="Montenegro">
<text>Montenegro is a country in Southeastern Europe, on the Balkan Peninsula. Its 25 municipalities have a total population of 633,158 people in an area of 13,883 km2 (5,360 sq mi). It is bordered by Bosnia and Herzegovina to the northwest, Serbia to the northeast, Kosovo to the east, Albania to the southeast, Croatia to the west, and has a coastline along the Adriatic Sea to the southwest. The capital and largest city is Podgorica, while Cetinje is the Old Royal Capital and cultural centre.

Before the arrival of the Slav peoples in the Balkans in the 6th and 7th centuries CE, the area now known as Montenegro was inhabited principally by people known as Illyrians.
During the Early Medieval period, three principalities were located on the territory of modern-day Montenegro: Duklja, roughly corresponding to the southern half; Travunia, the west; and Rascia proper, the north. The Principality of Zeta emerged in the 14th and 15th centuries. From the late 14th century to the late 18th century, large parts of southern Montenegro were ruled by the Venetian Republic and incorporated into Venetian Albania. The name &quot;Montenegro&quot; was first used to refer to the country in the late 15th century. After falling under Ottoman Empire rule, Montenegro gained semi-autonomy in 1696 under the rule of the House of Petrović-Njegoš, first as a theocracy and later as a secular principality. Montenegro&#x27;s independence was recognised by the Great Powers at the Congress of Berlin in 1878.

In 1910, the country became a kingdom. After World War I, the kingdom became part of Yugoslavia. Following the breakup of Yugoslavia, the republics of Serbia and Montenegro together proclaimed a federation. In June 2006 Montenegro declared its independence from Serbia and Montenegro following an independence referendum, creating Montenegro and Serbia as they exist today.

Montenegro has an upper-middle-income economy, mostly service-based, and is in late transition to a market economy. It is a member of the United Nations, NATO, the World Trade Organization, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the Council of Europe, and the Central European Free Trade Agreement. Montenegro is also a founding member of the Union for the Mediterranean, and has been in the process of joining the European Union since 2012.

== Etymology ==
Montenegro&#x27;s ( ; / ; ) English name derives from a Venetian calque of the Montenegrin phrase &quot;Crna Gora&quot;, meaning literally &quot;Black Mountain&quot;, deriving from the appearance of Mount Lovćen which was covered in dense evergreen forests. &quot;Crna Gora&quot; was mentioned for the first time in edicts issued by Stefan Uroš I to the Serbian Orthodox Zeta Episcopate seat at Vranjina island in Lake Skadar. It came to denote the majority of contemporary Montenegro in the 15th century.

Modern-day Montenegro was more and more known by that name in the historical period following the fall of the Serbian Despotate in 1459. Originally, it had referred to only a small strip of land under the rule of the Paštrovići tribe, but the name eventually came to be used for the wider mountainous region after the Crnojević noble family took power in Upper Zeta. The aforementioned region became known as &quot;Stara Crna Gora&quot; &#x27;Old Montenegro&#x27; by the 19th century to distinguish the independent region from the neighbouring Ottoman-occupied Montenegrin territory of &quot;Brda&quot; (the &quot;Highlands&quot;). Montenegro further increased its size several times by the 20th century, as the result of wars against the Ottoman Empire, which saw the annexation of Old Herzegovina and parts of Metohija and southern Raška. Its borders have changed little since then, losing Metohija and gaining the Bay of Kotor.

After the second session of the AVNOJ during World War II in Yugoslavia, the contemporary modern state of Montenegro was founded as the &quot;Federal State of Montenegro&quot; (Montenegrin: Савезна држава Црне Горе / &quot;Savezna država Crne Gore&quot;) on 15 November 1943 within the Yugoslav Federation by the ZAVNOCGB. After the war, Montenegro became a republic under its name, the &quot;People&#x27;s Republic of Montenegro&quot; (Montenegrin: Народна Република Црна Гора / &quot;Narodna Republika Crna Gora&quot;) on 29 November 1945. In 1963, it was renamed to the &quot;Socialist Republic of Montenegro&quot; (Montenegrin: Социјалистичка Република Црна Гора / &quot;Socijalistička Republika Crna Gora&quot;). As the breakup of Yugoslavia occurred, the SRCG was renamed to the &quot;Republic of Montenegro&quot; (Montenegrin: Република Црна Гора / &quot;Republika Crna Gora&quot;) on 27 April 1992 within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia by removing the adjective &quot;socialist&quot; from the republic&#x27;s title. Since 22 October 2007, a year after its independence, the name of the country became simply known as &quot;Montenegro&quot;. The country is known as &quot;Mali i Zi&quot; (lit. black mountain) in Albanian, while it is known as &quot;Crna Gora&quot; in Montenegrin, Serbian, Bosnian, and Croatian.

== History ==
===Antiquity===
Modern-day Montenegro was part of Illyria and populated by the Indo-European-speaking Illyrians. The Illyrian kingdom was conquered by the Roman Republic in the Illyro-Roman Wars and the region was incorporated into the province of Illyricum (later Dalmatia and Praevalitana).

=== Arrival of the Slavs ===
Three principalities were located on the territory: Duklja, roughly corresponding to the southern half, Travunia, the west, and Raška, the north. Duklja gained its independence from the Byzantine Roman Empire in 1042. Over the next few decades, it expanded its territory to neighbouring Rascia and Bosnia, and also became recognised as a kingdom. Its power started declining at the beginning of the 12th century. After King Bodin&#x27;s death (in 1101 or 1108), civil wars ensued. Duklja reached its zenith under Vojislav&#x27;s son, Mihailo (1046–1081), and his grandson Constantine Bodin (1081–1101).
As the nobility fought for the throne, the kingdom was weakened, and by 1186, the territory of modern-day Montenegro became part of the state ruled by Stefan Nemanja and was a part of various state formations ruled by the Nemanjić dynasty for the next two centuries. After the Serbian Empire collapsed in the second half of the 14th century, the most powerful Zetan family, the Balšićs, became sovereigns of Zeta.

By the 13th century, &quot;Zeta&quot; had replaced &quot;Duklja&quot; when referring to the realm. In the late 14th century, southern Montenegro (Zeta) came under the rule of the Balšić noble family, then the Crnojević noble family, and by the 15th century, Zeta was more often referred to as &quot;Crna Gora&quot;.

In 1421, Zeta was annexed to the Serbian Despotate, but after 1455, another noble family from Zeta, the Crnojevićs, became sovereign rulers of the country, making it the last free monarchy of the Balkans before it fell to the Ottomans in 1496, and got annexed to the &quot;sanjak&quot; of Shkodër. For a short time, Montenegro existed as a separate autonomous &quot;sanjak&quot; in 1514–1528 (Sanjak of Montenegro). Also, Old Herzegovina region was part of Sanjak of Herzegovina.

=== Early modern period ===
From 1392, numerous parts of the territory were controlled by Republic of Venice, including the city of Budva, in that time known as &quot;Budua&quot;. 
The Venetian territory was centred on the Bay of Kotor, and the Republic introduced governors who meddled in Montenegrin politics. Venice controlled territories in present-day Montenegro until its fall in 1797.
Large portions fell under the control of the Ottoman Empire from 1496 to 1878. In the 16th century, Montenegro developed a unique form of autonomy within the Ottoman Empire that permitted Montenegrin clans freedom from certain restrictions. Nevertheless, the Montenegrins were disgruntled with Ottoman rule, and in the 17th century, repeatedly rebelled, which culminated in the defeat of the Ottomans in the Great Turkish War at the end of that century.

Montenegrin territories were controlled by warlike clans. Most clans had a chieftain (&quot;knez&quot;), who was not permitted to assume the title unless he proved to be as worthy a leader as his predecessor. An assembly of Montenegrin clans (&quot;Zbor&quot;) was held every year on 12 July in Cetinje, and any adult clansman could take part. In 1515, Montenegro became a theocracy led by the Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Littoral, which flourished after the Petrović-Njegoš of Cetinje became the prince-bishop (whose title was &quot;Vladika of Montenegro&quot;).

People from Montenegro in this historical period were described as Orthodox Serbs.

=== Principality and Kingdom of Montenegro ===
In 1858, one of the major Montenegrin victories over the Ottomans occurred at the Battle of Grahovac. Grand Duke Mirko Petrović, elder brother of Knjaz Danilo, led an army of 7,500 and defeated the numerically superior Ottomans with 15,000 troops at Grahovac on 1 May 1858. This forced the Great Powers to officially demarcate the borders between Montenegro and Ottoman Empire, &quot;de facto&quot; recognizing Montenegro&#x27;s independence.

In the Battle of Vučji Do Montenegrins inflicted a major defeat on the Ottoman Army under Grand Vizier Ahmed Muhtar Pasha. In the aftermath of the Russian victory against the Ottoman Empire in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, the major powers restructured the map of the Balkan region. The Ottoman Empire recognised the independence of Montenegro in the Treaty of Berlin in 1878.

The first Montenegrin constitution (also known as the Danilo Code) was proclaimed in 1855. Under Nicholas I (ruled 1860–1918), the principality was enlarged several times in the Montenegro-Turkish Wars and was recognised as independent in 1878. Nicholas I established diplomatic relations with the Ottoman Empire. Minor border skirmishes excepted, diplomacy ushered in about 30 years of peace between the two states until the deposition of Abdul Hamid II in 1909.
The political skills of Abdul Hamid II and Nicholas I played a major role in the mutually amicable relations. Modernization of the state followed, culminating with the draft of a Constitution in 1905. However, political rifts emerged between the reigning People&#x27;s Party, who supported the process of democratisation and union with Serbia, and those of the True People&#x27;s Party, who were monarchist.

In 1910, Montenegro became a kingdom, and as a result of the Balkan Wars of 1912–1913, a common border with Serbia was established, with Shkodër being awarded to Albania, though the current capital city of Montenegro, Podgorica, was on the old border of Albania and Yugoslavia. Montenegro became one of the Allied Powers during World War I (1914–1918). In the Battle of Mojkovac fought in January 1916 between Austria-Hungary and the Kingdom of Montenegro, Montenegrins achieved a decisive victory even though they were outnumbered five to one. The Austro-Hungarians accepted military surrender on 25 January 1916. From 1916 to October 1918 Austria-Hungary occupied Montenegro. During the occupation, King Nicholas fled the country and established a government-in-exile in Bordeaux.

=== Kingdom of Yugoslavia ===

In 1922, Montenegro formally became the Oblast of Cetinje in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, with the addition of the coastal areas around Budva and Bay of Kotor. In a further restructuring in 1929, it became a part of a larger Zeta Banate of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia that reached the Neretva River.

Nicholas&#x27;s grandson, the Serb King Alexander I, dominated the Yugoslav government. Zeta Banovina was one of nine banovinas that formed the kingdom; it consisted of the present-day Montenegro and parts of Serbia, Croatia, and Bosnia.

=== World War II and Socialist Yugoslavia ===
In April 1941, Nazi Germany, the Kingdom of Italy, and other Axis allies attacked and occupied the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Italian forces occupied Montenegro and established a puppet Kingdom of Montenegro.

In May, the Montenegrin branch of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia started preparations for an uprising planned for mid-July. The Communist Party and its Youth League organised 6,000 of its members into detachments prepared for guerrilla warfare. According to some historians, the first armed uprising in Nazi-occupied Europe happened on 13 July 1941 in Montenegro.

Unexpectedly, the uprising took hold, and by 20 July, 32,000 men and women had joined the fight. Except for the coast and major towns (Podgorica, Cetinje, Pljevlja, and Nikšić), which were besieged, Montenegro was mostly liberated. In a month of fighting, the Italian army suffered 5,000 dead, wounded, and captured. The uprising lasted until mid-August, when it was suppressed by a counter-offensive of 67,000 Italian troops brought in from Albania. Faced with new and overwhelming Italian forces, many of the fighters laid down their arms and returned home. Nevertheless, intense guerrilla fighting lasted until December.

Fighters who remained under arms fractured into two groups. Most of them went on to join the Yugoslav Partisans, consisting of communists and those inclined towards active resistance; these included Arso Jovanović, Sava Kovačević, Svetozar Vukmanović-Tempo, Milovan Đilas, Peko Dapčević, Vlado Dapčević, Veljko Vlahović, and Blažo Jovanović. Those loyal to the Karađorđević dynasty and opposing communism went on to become Chetniks, and turned to collaboration with Italians against the Partisans.

War broke out between Partisans and Chetniks during the first half of 1942. Pressured by Italians and Chetniks, the core of the Montenegrin Partisans went to Serbia and Bosnia, where they joined with other Yugoslav Partisans. Fighting between Partisans and Chetniks continued through the war. Chetniks with Italian backing controlled most of the country from mid-1942 to April 1943. Montenegrin Chetniks received the status of &quot;anti-communist militia&quot; and received weapons, ammunition, food rations, and money from Italy. Most of them were moved to Mostar, where they fought in the Battle of Neretva against the Partisans, but were dealt a heavy defeat.

During German operation Schwartz against the Partisans in May and June 1943, Germans disarmed many Chetniks without fighting, as they feared they would turn against them in case of an Allied invasion of the Balkans. After the capitulation of Italy in September 1943, Partisans managed to take hold of most of Montenegro for a brief time, but Montenegro was soon occupied by German forces, and fierce fighting continued during late 1943 and 1944. Montenegro was liberated by the Partisans in December 1944.

Montenegro became one of the six constituent republics of the communist Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY). Its capital became Podgorica, renamed Titograd in honour of President Josip Broz Tito. After the war, the infrastructure of Yugoslavia was rebuilt, industrialization began, and the University of Montenegro was established. Greater autonomy was established until the Socialist Republic of Montenegro ratified a new constitution in 1974.

=== Montenegro within FR Yugoslavia ===
After the formal dissolution of the SFRY in 1992, Montenegro remained part of a smaller Federal Republic of Yugoslavia along with Serbia. In the referendum on remaining in Yugoslavia in 1992, 96% of the votes cast were in favour of the federation with Serbia. The referendum was boycotted by opposition parties such as the Liberal Alliance of Montenegro, the Social Democratic and Socialist Parties, as well as minority parties such as the Democratic League in Montenegro, leading to a relatively low turnout of 66%.
During the 1991–1995 Bosnian War and Croatian War, Montenegrin police and military forces, under orders of president Momir Bulatovic and Interior Minister Pavle Bulatovic joined Serbian troops in attacks on Dubrovnik, Croatia. These operations, aimed at acquiring more territory, were characterised by large-scale violations of human rights.

Montenegrin General Pavle Strugar was convicted for his part in the bombing of Dubrovnik. Bosnian refugees were arrested by Montenegrin police and transported to Serb camps in Foča, where they were subjected to systematic torture and executed.

In 1996, Milo Đukanović&#x27;s government severed ties between Montenegro and its partner Serbia, which was led by Slobodan Milošević. Montenegro formed its own economic policy and adopted the German Deutsche Mark as its currency and subsequently adopted the euro, although not part of the Eurozone. Subsequent governments pursued pro-independence policies, and political tensions with Serbia simmered despite political changes in Belgrade.

Targets in Montenegro were bombed by NATO forces during Operation Allied Force in 1999, although the extent of these attacks was limited in both time and area affected.

In 2002, Serbia and Montenegro came to a new agreement for continued cooperation and entered into negotiations regarding the future status of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. This resulted in the Belgrade Agreement, which saw the country&#x27;s transformation into a more decentralised state union named Serbia and Montenegro in 2003. The Belgrade Agreement also contained a provision delaying any future referendum on the independence of Montenegro for at least three years.

=== Independence ===


The status of the union between Montenegro and Serbia was decided by a referendum on Montenegrin independence on 21 May 2006. A total of 419,240 votes were cast, representing 86.5% of the electorate; 230,661 votes (55.5%) were for independence and 185,002 votes (44.5%) were against. This narrowly surpassed the 55% threshold needed to validate the referendum under the rules set by the European Union. According to the electoral commission, the 55% threshold was passed by only 2,300 votes. Serbia, the member-states of the European Union, and the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council all recognised Montenegro&#x27;s independence.

The 2006 referendum was monitored by five international observer missions, headed by an OSCE/ODIHR team, and around 3,000 observers in total (including domestic observers from CDT (OSCE PA), the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe (CLRAE), and the European Parliament (EP) to form an International Referendum Observation Mission (IROM). The IROM—in its preliminary report—&quot;assessed compliance of the referendum process with OSCE commitments, Council of Europe commitments, other international standards for democratic electoral processes, and domestic legislation.&quot; Furthermore, the report stated that the competitive pre-referendum environment was marked by an active and generally peaceful campaign and that &quot;there were no reports of restrictions on fundamental civil and political rights&quot;.

On 3 June 2006, the Montenegrin Parliament declared the independence of Montenegro, formally confirming the result of the referendum.

On 28 June 2006, Montenegro joined the United Nations as its 192nd member state.

Montenegro has been dominated since the breakup of Yugoslavia by Milo Đukanović (four-time prime minister and twice president), accused of having established an authoritarianism and clientelist regime, while maintaining close relations with organized crime. The massive privatizations of the Đukanović era lead to the enrichment of him and oligarchs close to him. His brother Aleksandar, owner of Montenegro&#x27;s first private bank, oversaw the privatizations, while his sister, Ana Kolarevic, has long controlled the judiciary. The clientelist networks of the ruling party dominated all segments of social life. A party card was required to start a business or obtain a position in the administration. This policy also contributed to the reinforcement of regional disparities and social inequalities. Unemployment climbs to 36.6 per cent in the northern part of the country, compared to 3.9 per cent in the coastal region, while a quarter of the population lives below the poverty line (2018).

The Law on the Status of the Descendants of the Petrović Njegoš Dynasty was passed by the Parliament of Montenegro on 12 July 2011. It rehabilitated the Royal House of Montenegro and recognised limited symbolic roles within the constitutional framework of the republic.

In 2015, the investigative journalists&#x27; network OCCRP named Montenegro&#x27;s long-time President and Prime Minister Milo Đukanović &quot;Person of the Year in Organized Crime&quot;. The extent of Đukanović&#x27;s corruption led to street demonstrations and calls for his removal.

In October 2016, for the day of the parliamentary election, a coup d&#x27;état was prepared by a group of persons that included leaders of the Montenegrin opposition, Serbian nationals and Russian agents; the coup was prevented. In 2017, fourteen people, including two Russian nationals and two Montenegrin opposition leaders, Andrija Mandić and Milan Knežević, were indicted for their alleged roles in the coup attempt on charges such as &quot;preparing a conspiracy against the constitutional order and the security of Montenegro&quot; and an &quot;attempted terrorist act&quot;.

=== Recent history ===

Montenegro formally became a member of NATO in June 2017, despite attempts by Russia to sabotage it, an event that triggered a promise of retaliatory actions from Russia&#x27;s government.
Montenegro has been in negotiations with the EU since 2012. In 2018, the earlier goal of acceding by 2022 was revised to 2025. Legislation is being passed bringing Montenegro law in line with EU membership requirements.

In April 2018, Milo Djukanovic, the leader of the ruling Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS), won Montenegro&#x27;s presidential election. The veteran politician had served as Prime Minister six times and as president once before. He had dominated Montenegrin politics since 1991.

Anti-corruption protests began in February 2019 against Đukanović and the Prime Minister Duško Marković-led government of the ruling Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS), which had been in power since 1991.

 the newly adopted Law on Religion, which de jure transferred the ownership of church buildings and estates built before 1918 from the Serbian Orthodox Church to the Montenegrin state, sparked large protests and road blockages. Seventeen opposition Democratic Front MPs were arrested prior to the voting for disrupting the vote. Demonstrations continued into March 2020 as peaceful protest walks, mostly organised by the Serbian Orthodox Church in the majority of Montenegrin municipalities.

In its political rights and civil liberties worldwide report in May 2020, Freedom House marked Montenegro as a hybrid regime rather than a democracy because of declining standards in governance, justice, elections, and media freedom. For the first time in three decades, in the 2020 parliamentary election, the opposition won more votes than Đukanović&#x27;s ruling party. In February 2022, that very same government was voted out in the first successful vote of no-confidence in the country&#x27;s history.

In September 2022 an investigation linked six Russian diplomats with twenty eight Russian citizens holding temporary visas for Montenegro and two local citizens in a spy investigation. The diplomats were expelled. The Russian citizens were later banned from Montenegro and the two locals, one an ex-diplomat, face charges of illegal weapons, organising a criminal organisation and espionage.

In March 2023, Jakov Milatovic, a pro-western candidate of the Europe Now movement, won the presidential election run-off over incumbent Milo Djukanovic to succeed him as the incumbent president of Montenegro. The Europe Now movement won the highest number of seats in the 2023 Montenegrin parliamentary election. On 31 October 2023, Milojko Spajic of the Europe Now Movement became Montenegro&#x27;s new prime minister, leading a coalition of both pro-European and pro-Serb parties.

The Parliament of Montenegro in June 2024 adopted a resolution acknowledging the atrocities committed at the Jasenovac concentration camp during World War II. This decision, spearheaded by pro-Serbian factions, is viewed as a response to Montenegro&#x27;s earlier support for a UN resolution on the Srebrenica genocide. Croatia has criticized the move, accusing Montenegro of politicizing historical events and warned that it could harm Montenegro&#x27;s path to EU membership and bilateral relations between Croatia and Montenegro. The resolution has led to increased diplomatic tensions between the two nations.

== Geography ==


Montenegro features high peaks along its borders with Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, and Serbia. Its geography also includes a segment of the karst of the western Balkan Peninsula, to a narrow coastal plain that is only wide. The plain stops abruptly in the north, where Mount Lovćen and Mount Orjen plunge into the inlet of the Bay of Kotor.

Montenegro&#x27;s large karst region lies generally at elevations of above sea level; some parts, however, rise to , such as Mount Orjen , the highest massif among the coastal limestone ranges. The Zeta River valley, at an elevation of , is the lowest segment.
The mountains of Montenegro include some of the most rugged terrains in Europe, averaging more than in elevation. One of the country&#x27;s notable peaks is Bobotov Kuk in the Durmitor mountains, which reaches a height of and was previously thought to be the country&#x27;s highest point. In 2018, new triangulation measurements showed that Zla Kolata in the Prokletije mountains, which reaches a height of . Owing to the hyperhumid climate on their western sides, the Montenegrin mountain ranges were among the most ice-eroded parts of the Balkan Peninsula during the last glacial period.

Internationally, Montenegro borders Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Albania and Croatia. It lies between latitudes 41° and 44°N, and longitudes 18° and 21°E.


Montenegro is a member of the International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River, as more than of the country&#x27;s territory lie within the Danube catchment area.

=== Biodiversity ===

The diversity of the geological base, landscape, climate, and soil, and the position of Montenegro on the Balkan Peninsula and Adriatic Sea, created the conditions for high biological diversity, putting Montenegro among the &quot;hot-spots&quot; of European and world biodiversity. The number of species per area unit index in Montenegro is 0.837, the highest in any European country.

Biological estimates suggest that over 1,200 species of freshwater algae, 300 species of marine algae, 589 species of moss, 7,000–8,000 species of vascular plants, 2,000 species of fungi, 16,000–20,000 species of insects, 407 species of marine fish, 56 species of reptile, 333 species of regularly visiting birds and a high species diversity of mammals are found in Montenegro.

Montenegro can be divided into two main biogeographic regions, which include the Mediterranean Biogeographic Region and the Alpine Biogeographic Region. It is also home to three terrestrial ecoregions: Balkan mixed forests, Dinaric Mountains mixed forests, and Illyrian deciduous forests. It had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 6.41/10, ranking it 73rd globally out of 172 countries.

The total share of protected areas in Montenegro is 9.05% of the country&#x27;s area, which mainly comes from the five national parks of Montenegro.

== Politics ==


Montenegro is a parliamentary representative democratic republic with a codified constitution established in 2007. The constitution describes Montenegro as a &quot;civic, democratic, ecological state of social justice, based on the reign of Law&quot;. Montenegro is a multi-party system.

The President of Montenegro is the representative head of state, elected for a period of five years through direct election. The President promotes the country internationally through diplomatic engagements, promulgates laws by ordinance, calls elections for the Parliament, and ceremonially proposes candidates for Prime Minister, president and justices of the Constitutional Court to the Parliament. The President also ceremonially proposes the calling of a referendum to Parliament, grants amnesty for criminal offences proscribed by the national law, confers decoration and awards and performs other constitutional duties and is a member of the Supreme Defence Council. The official residence of the President is in Cetinje. The incumbent president is Jakov Milatović who has held the position since May 2023.

The Government of Montenegro is the executive branch of government authority of Montenegro and led by the Prime Minister. The role of Prime Minister is the most politically powerful office in Montenegro. All of Montenegro&#x27;s governments since 2006 have been coalitions comprising a minimum of three political parties. The government is primarily based in Podgorica.

The Parliament of Montenegro is the country&#x27;s unicameral legislature, located in Podgorica. The Parliament has power to appoint the government, pass legislation (parliamentary law) and scrutinise bills (proposed parliamentary law). It also appoints justices of all courts, approves the budget and performs other duties as established by the country&#x27;s Constitution. Parliament can pass a motion of no confidence in the Government by simple majority vote. One member of the Montenegrin parliament, known as a Deputy, is elected per 6,000 voters. There are currently 81 deputies. Elections to the Parliament are conducted by the D&#x27;Hondt method, a form of proportional representation.

In 2019, Montenegro was described as a hybrid regime (a political system which combines democratic and authoritarian features) according to the United States–based Freedom House. The organisation cited state capture, abuse of power, and strongman tactics by Prime Minister Milo Đukanović (2008–2010 and 2012–2016) as explanations for its description as such. Đukanović held a number of senior government positions, including the Presidency, before and after the dissolution of the union between Serbia and Montenegro. In 2021, the &quot;Economist Democracy Index&quot; (EDI) declared Montenegro as a &quot;flawed democracy&quot; and it remains regarded as such by the EDI.

Đukanović&#x27;s pro-European and pro-NATO Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS) narrowly lost the 2020 parliamentary election which ended the party&#x27;s 30-year rule and the pro-Serbia &quot;For the Future of Montenegro&quot; (ZBCG) parliamentary group, composed mainly of Serb nationalist parties, formed a government under Prime Minister Zdravko Krivokapic. Prime Minister Krivokapic&#x27;s government was toppled in a no-confidence vote after just 14 months in power.

In April 2022, a new minority government, led by Prime Minister Dritan Abazović, brought together moderate parties that are both pro-European and pro-Serb. However, his government lost a confidence vote after only 113 days. Since Montenegro had been unable to find a government which could command the confidence of the Parliament, Abazović remained in his post until the Spajić Cabinet had been formed after the Parliamentary election which took place on 11 June 2023, where the Europe Now! party led by Milojko Spajić won the most seats. In October 2023, a new minority government with confidence and supply support from ZBCG enabled Milojko Spajić to become the new prime minister.

=== Administrative divisions ===


Montenegro is divided into twenty-five municipalities (&quot;opština&quot;). Each municipality can contain multiple cities and towns. Historically, the territory of the country was divided into nahije and during the beginning of SR Montenegro was divided into counties (&quot;srez&quot;).

Regions of Montenegro—designed for statistical purposes by the Statistical Office—have no administrative function. Note that other organizations (i.e. Football Association of Montenegro) use different municipalities as a part of similar regions.

*Northern Region

*Central Region
*Coastal Region

=== Foreign relations ===


The Ministry of Foreign Affairs was given the task of defining the foreign policy priorities and activities needed for their implementation in cooperation with other state administration authorities, the President, the Speaker of the Parliament, and other relevant stakeholders.

The country joined NATO on 5 June 2017. Integration into the European Union remains a high-priority for Montenegro and has been the focus of Montenegrin foreign policy since its independence from Serbia. In June 2023, newly elected President Milatović stated that he expects Montenegro to join the European Union by 2027 or 2028.

=== Law ===
The current Constitution of Montenegro was ratified and adopted by the Constitutional Parliament of Montenegro on 19 October 2007 in a session by achieving the required two-thirds supermajority of votes. It was officially proclaimed on 22 October 2007.

The Constitution defines Montenegro as a civic, democratic and environmentally friendly country with social justice, established by the sovereign rights of its government.

The judiciary in Montenegro is composed of several courts, with the Supreme Court being the highest judicial authority. It oversees the uniform application of laws.

The Constitutional Court is a separate body, tasked with safeguarding the constitution by reviewing laws and acts of public authorities to ensure their compliance with the Constitution.

Judges in Montenegro are appointed by the Judicial Council and serve until the age of 67. The President of Montenegro appoints judges upon the recommendation of the Judicial Council. Additionally, the Protector of Human Rights and Freedoms of Montenegro (Ombudsman) is appointed by the Parliament for a six-year term, ensuring the protection of human rights and social justice.

Montenegro has a relatively low homicide rate, with the rate fluctuating around 1.5 to 2.0 murders per 100,000 people in recent years.

Abortion in Montenegro is legal on request during the first ten weeks of pregnancy.

Discrimination on the basis of both sexual orientation and gender identity is banned in employment, the provision of goods and services, education and health services.

Private security firms operate in Montenegro but have no legal authority to arrest or detain suspects.

The National Security Agency (ANB) is responsible for counterintelligence and internal security, while Interpol Montenegro collaborates with international agencies to counter transnational crime. Special units within the police, such as the Special Anti-Terrorist Unit (SAJ), handle organized crime, terrorism, and high-risk operations.

An agreement signed with the EU effective July 2023 permits EU Frontex border management personnel to operate in Montenegro in support of local border police operating on other, non EU, borders in Montenegro.

The military of Montenegro consist of three professional service branches: the Montenegrin Ground Army, the Montenegrin Navy and the Montenegrin Air Force. The armed forces of Montenegro are managed by the Ministry of Defence, and controlled by the Chief of the General Staff. The President of Montenegro is the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces, to whom members of the forces swear an oath of allegiance. The Armed Forces are charged with protecting Montenegro, promoting the global security interests and supporting international peacekeeping efforts.

Montenegro is a NATO member and a member of Adriatic Charter. The government planned to have the army participate in peacekeeping missions through the UN and NATO such as the International Security Assistance Force.

Montenegro is the 35th most peaceful country in the world, according to the 2024 Global Peace Index.

== Economy ==


The economy of Montenegro is mostly service-based and is in late transition to a market economy. According to the International Monetary Fund, the nominal GDP of Montenegro was $5.424 billion in 2019. The GDP PPP for 2019 was $12.516 billion, or $20,083 per capita. According to Eurostat data, the Montenegrin GDP per capita stood at 48% of the EU average in 2018.

Montenegro joined the Central European Free Trade Agreement in 2007 and has a free trade agreement with the European Free Trade Association since 2012. The Central Bank of Montenegro is not part of the euro system but the country is &quot;euroised&quot;, using the euro unilaterally as its currency. Montenegro was ranked 65th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024, up from 75th in 2023.

=== Infrastructure ===
The Montenegrin road infrastructure is not at Western European standards. No roads meet full motorway standards. Construction of new motorways is considered a national priority, as they are important for uniform economic development and the development of Montenegro as an attractive tourist destination.

The European routes that pass through Montenegro are E65 and E80.

The backbone of the Montenegrin rail network is the Belgrade–Bar railway, which provides international connection towards Serbia. A domestic branch line, the Nikšić-Podgorica railway, operated as a freight-only line for decades, that opened for passenger traffic after reconstruction and electrification in 2012. The other branch line from Podgorica towards the Albanian border, the Podgorica–Shkodër railway, is not in use.

Montenegro has two international airports, Podgorica Airport and Tivat Airport.

The Port of Bar is Montenegro&#x27;s main seaport. Initially built in 1906, the port was almost completely destroyed during World War II. Reconstruction began in 1950. It is equipped to handle over five million tons of cargo annually, but has been operating at a loss and well below capacity. The reconstruction of the Belgrade-Bar railway and the proposed Belgrade-Bar motorway are expected to return operating levels to capacity.

In 2023 there is a plan to install an LNG terminal at Bar to receive gas imports.

=== Tourism ===

A total of 2.1 million visitors visited Montenegro in 2022 spending 12.4m nights there. The majority of foreign visitors to Montenegro come from the neighbouring countries of Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo, as well as Russia.

The Montenegrin Adriatic coast is long, with of beaches and many well-preserved ancient towns. Some of the most popular beaches include Jaz Beach, Mogren Beach, Bečići Beach, Sveti Stefan Beach and Velika Plaža. Meanwhile, some of the most popular ancient towns include Herceg Novi, Perast, Kotor, Budva and Ulcinj.

&quot;National Geographic Traveler&quot; (edited once a decade) ranks Montenegro among the &quot;50 Places of a Lifetime&quot;. Montenegrin seaside town Sveti Stefan was once used as the cover for the magazine. The coast region of Montenegro was considered one of the great &quot;discoveries&quot; among world tourists. In January 2010, &quot;The New York Times&quot; ranked the Ulcinj South Coast region of Montenegro, including Velika Plaža, Ada Bojana, and the Hotel Mediteran of Ulcinj, among the &quot;Top 31 Places to Go in 2010&quot; as part of a worldwide ranking.

== Demographics ==
=== Ethnic structure ===

The 2023 census reported 623,633 citizens. Montenegro is a multiethnic state with no ethnic majority. Montenegrins make up 41.1% of the population, Serbs 32.9%, Bosniaks 9.45%, Albanians 4.99%, and Russians 2.01%. There is a significant number of other ethnic groups, including Romani people, Croats, Ukrainians, Belarusians, and Turks.

Montenegro is one of 22 countries with a GHI score of less than 5.

=== Languages ===

The official language in Montenegro is Montenegrin. Serbian, Bosnian, Albanian, and Croatian are recognised in official usage. Montenegrin, Serbian, Bosnian, and Croatian are mutually intelligible as standard varieties of the Serbo-Croatian language. Serbian is the most spoken language in the country, as a plurality of the population at 43.18% consider it as their native language, while 34.52% speaks the Montenegrin language. There is also significant number of people speaking Bosnian (6.98%), Albanian (5.25%), and Russian (2.36%).

=== Religion ===

Montenegro has historically stood at the crossroads of multiculturalism, and over centuries this has shaped its unique co-existence between its Christian and Muslim populations. Montenegrins have throughout history been Eastern Orthodox Christians that are members of the Serbian Orthodox Church, which is governed by the Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Littoral and the Eparchy of Budimlja and Nikšić. Eastern Orthodox Christianity is the predominant religion in Montenegro, with 71.1% of the population adhering to the religion. Meanwhile, the Serbian Orthodox Church is the largest and most popular church, with approximately 90% of Orthodox Christians in Montenegro following the church. A schismatic church called The Montenegrin Orthodox Church, which broke off from the Serbian Orthodox church in 1993, is followed by the remaining 10% of Orthodox Christians in the country. It also has not been officially recognized by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople and is not in communion with any other canonical Orthodox Christian Church.

Despite tensions between religious groups during the Bosnian War, Montenegro remained fairly stable, mainly due to its population&#x27;s perspective on religious tolerance and faith diversity. Religious institutions have guaranteed rights and are separate from the state. The second largest religion is Islam, practiced by 19% of the population. Montenegro has one of the highest proportion of Muslims in Europe and the third highest proportion among Slavic countries, behind only Bosnia and Herzegovina and North Macedonia. A little more than one-fourth of the country&#x27;s Albanians are Catholics (8,126 in the 2003 census) while the rest (22,267) are mainly Sunni Muslims; in 2012 a protocol recognised Islam as an official religion, which ensures that halal foods are served at military facilities, hospitals, dormitories and social facilities; and that Muslim women are permitted to wear headscarves in schools and at public institutions, as well as ensuring that Muslims have the right to take Fridays off for the Jumu&#x27;ah (Friday)-prayer. Since the time of Vojislavljević dynasty Catholicism is autochthonous in the Montenegrin area. A small Roman Catholic population, mostly Albanians with some Croats, is divided between the Archdiocese of Antivari headed by the Primate of Serbia and the Diocese of Kotor that is a part of the Catholic Church in Croatia.

== Culture ==

Montenegrin culture has been shaped most importantly by Orthodox, Ottoman (Turk), Slavic, Central European, and seafaring Adriatic cultures (notably parts of Italy, like the Republic of Venice).

Montenegro has many significant cultural and historical sites, including heritage sites from the pre-Romanesque, Gothic and Baroque periods. The Montenegrin coastal region is known for its religious monuments, including the Cathedral of Saint Tryphon in Kotor (Cattaro under the Venetians), the basilica of St. Luke (over 800 years), Our Lady of the Rocks (Škrpjela), the Savina Monastery and others. Medieval monasteries contain many artistically important frescoes.

One cultural dimension is the ethical ideal of &quot;Čojstvo i Junaštvo&quot;, &quot;Humaneness and Gallantry&quot;. The traditional folk dance of the Montenegrins is the Oro, the &quot;eagle dance&quot; that involves dancing in circles with couples alternating in the centre, and is finished by forming a human pyramid of dancers standing on each other&#x27;s shoulders.

=== Media ===

Television, magazines, and newspapers are operated by both state-owned and for-profit corporations that depend on advertising, subscription, and other sales-related revenues. The Constitution of Montenegro guarantees freedom of speech. Montenegro&#x27;s media system is under transformation, along with the rest of the country.

=== Sport ===
Sport in Montenegro revolves mostly around team sports, such as water polo, football, basketball, handball, and volleyball. Other sports involved are boxing, tennis, swimming, judo, karate, athletics, table tennis, and chess.

Water polo is the most popular and is considered the national sport. Montenegro men&#x27;s national water polo team is one of the world&#x27;s top ranked teams, winning the gold medal at the 2008 Men&#x27;s European Water Polo Championship in Málaga, Spain, and winning the gold medal at the 2009 FINA Men&#x27;s Water Polo World League, held in Podgorica. The Montenegrin team PVK Primorac from Kotor became a champion of Europe at the LEN Euroleague 2009 in Rijeka, Croatia. Montenegro came fourth in the men&#x27;s water polo in the 2016 Olympics.

Football is the second most popular sport. The Montenegro national football team, founded in 2006, played in playoffs for UEFA Euro 2012, its highest play appearance. The Montenegro national basketball team is known for good performances and won many medals as part of the Yugoslavia national basketball team. In 2006, the Basketball Federation of Montenegro along with this team joined the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) on its own, following the Independence. Montenegro participated in two EuroBaskets.

Among women sports, the national handball team is the most successful, winning the country&#x27;s first Olympic medal, claiming silver at the 2012 Summer Olympics. This was followed by the 2012 European Championship which Montenegro won, becoming European champions. ŽRK Budućnost Podgorica has twice won the EHF Champions League. Montenegro was one of the host countries for the 2022 European Women&#x27;s Handball Championship and came third.

=== Cuisine ===


The first major influences to Montenegrin cuisine came from the Levant and Turkey: sarma, musaka, pilav, pita, gibanica, burek, ćevapi, kebab, đuveč, and Turkish sweets such as baklava and tulumba. Hungarian cuisine influences stews and sataraš. While Central European cuisine is evident in the prevalence of crêpes, doughnuts, jams, many types of biscuits and cakes, and various kinds of breads. Montenegrin cuisine also varies geographically; with the cuisine in the coastal area differing from that of the northern highland region. The coastal area is traditionally a representative of Mediterranean cuisine, with seafood being a common dish. The traditional dishes of Montenegro&#x27;s Adriatic coast, unlike its heartland, have been significantly influenced by Italian cuisine.

<text>John Michael Crichton (; October 23, 1942 – November 4, 2008) was an American author, screenwriter and filmmaker. His books have sold over 200 million copies worldwide, and over a dozen have been adapted into films. His literary works heavily feature technology and are usually within the science fiction, techno-thriller, and medical fiction genres. Crichton&#x27;s novels often explore human technological advancement and attempted dominance over nature, both with frequently catastrophic results; many of his works are cautionary tales, especially regarding themes of biotechnology. Several of his stories center on themes of genetic modification, hybridization, paleontology and/or zoology. Many feature medical or scientific underpinnings, reflective of his own medical training and scientific background.

Crichton received an M.D. from Harvard Medical School in 1969 but did not practice medicine, choosing to focus on his writing instead. Initially writing under a pseudonym, he eventually published 25 novels in his lifetime, including: &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot; (1969), &quot;The Terminal Man&quot; (1972), &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; (1975), &quot;Congo&quot; (1980), &quot;Sphere&quot; (1987), &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; (1990), &quot;Rising Sun&quot; (1992), &quot;Disclosure&quot; (1994), &quot;The Lost World&quot; (1995), &quot;Airframe&quot; (1996), &quot;Timeline&quot; (1999), &quot;Prey&quot; (2002), &quot;State of Fear&quot; (2004), and &quot;Next&quot; (2006). Four more novels, in various states of completion, were published after his death in 2008.

Crichton was also involved in the film and television industry. In 1973, he wrote and directed &quot;Westworld&quot;, the first film to use 2D computer-generated imagery. He also directed &quot;Coma&quot; (1978), &quot;The First Great Train Robbery&quot; (1978), &quot;Looker&quot; (1981), and &quot;Runaway&quot; (1984). He was the creator of the television series &quot;ER&quot; (1994–2009), and several of his novels were adapted into films, most notably the &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; franchise.
==Life==
===Early life===
John Michael Crichton was born on October 23, 1942, in Chicago, Illinois, to John Henderson Crichton, a journalist, and Zula Miller Crichton, a homemaker. He was raised on Long Island, in Roslyn, New York, and he showed a keen interest in writing from a young age; at 16, he had an article about a trip he took to Sunset Crater published in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Crichton later recalled, &quot;Roslyn was another world. Looking back, it&#x27;s remarkable what wasn&#x27;t going on. There was no terror. No fear of children being abused. No fear of random murder. No drug use we knew about. I walked to school. I rode my bike for miles and miles, to the movie on Main Street and piano lessons and the like. Kids had freedom. It wasn&#x27;t such a dangerous world... We studied our butts off, and we got a tremendously good education there.&quot;

Crichton had always planned on becoming a writer and began his studies at Harvard College in 1960. During his undergraduate study in literature, he conducted an experiment to expose a professor whom he believed was giving him abnormally low marks and criticizing his literary style. Informing another professor of his suspicions, Crichton submitted an essay by George Orwell under his own name. The paper was returned by his unwitting professor with a mark of &quot;B−&quot;. He later said, &quot;Now Orwell was a wonderful writer, and if a B-minus was all he could get, I thought I&#x27;d better drop English as my major.&quot; His differences with the English department led Crichton to switch his undergraduate concentration. He earned his Bachelor&#x27;s degree in biological anthropology &quot;&quot; in 1964, and was initiated into Phi Beta Kappa society.

Crichton received a Henry Russell Shaw Traveling Fellowship from 1964 to 1965, which allowed him to serve as a visiting lecturer in anthropology at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. Crichton later enrolled at Harvard Medical School. Crichton later said &quot;about two weeks into medical school I realized I hated it. This isn&#x27;t unusual since everyone hates medical school – even happy, practicing physicians.&quot;

===Pseudonymous novels (1965–1968)===

In 1965, while at Harvard Medical School, Crichton wrote a novel, &quot;Odds On&quot;. &quot;I wrote for furniture and groceries&quot;, he said later. &quot;Odds On&quot; is a 215-page paperback novel which describes an attempted robbery at an isolated hotel on the Costa Brava in Spain. The robbery is planned scientifically with the help of a critical path analysis computer program, but unforeseen events get in the way. Crichton submitted it to Doubleday, where a reader liked it but felt it was not for the company. Doubleday passed it on to New American Library, which published it in 1966. Crichton used the pen name John Lange because he planned to become a doctor and did not want his patients to worry that he would use them for his plots. The name came from cultural anthropologist Andrew Lang. Crichton added an &quot;e&quot; to the surname and substituted his own real first name, John, for Andrew. The novel was successful enough to lead to a series of John Lange novels. Film rights were sold in 1969, but no movie resulted.

The second Lange novel, &quot;Scratch One&quot; (1967), relates the story of Roger Carr, a handsome, charming, privileged man who practices law, more as a means to support his playboy lifestyle than a career. Carr is sent to Nice, France, where he has notable political connections, but is mistaken for an assassin and finds his life in jeopardy. Crichton wrote the book while traveling through Europe on a travel fellowship. He visited the Cannes Film Festival and Monaco Grand Prix, and then decided, &quot;any idiot should be able to write a potboiler set in Cannes and Monaco&quot;, and wrote it in eleven days. He later described the book as &quot;no good&quot;. His third John Lange novel, &quot;Easy Go&quot; (1968), is the story of Harold Barnaby, a brilliant Egyptologist who discovers a concealed message while translating hieroglyphics informing him of an unnamed pharaoh whose tomb is yet to be discovered. Crichton said the book earned him $1,500 (). Crichton later said: &quot;My feeling about the Lange books is that my competition is in-flight movies. One can read the books in an hour and a half, and be more satisfactorily amused than watching Doris Day. I write them fast and the reader reads them fast and I get things off my back.&quot;

Crichton&#x27;s fourth novel was &quot;A Case of Need&quot; (1968), a medical thriller. The novel had a different tone from the Lange books; accordingly, Crichton used the pen name &quot;Jeffery Hudson&quot;, based on Sir Jeffrey Hudson, a 17th-century dwarf in the court of queen consort Henrietta Maria of England. The novel would prove a turning point in Crichton&#x27;s future novels, in which technology is important in the subject matter, although this novel was as much about medical practice. The novel earned him an Edgar Award in 1969. He intended to use the &quot;Jeffery Hudson&quot; pseudonym for other medical novels but ended up using it only once. The book was later adapted into the film &quot;The Carey Treatment&quot; (1972).

===Early novels and screenplays (1969–1974)===
Crichton says after he finished his third year of medical school: &quot;I stopped believing that one day I&#x27;d love it and realized that what I loved was writing.&quot; He began publishing book reviews under his name. In 1969, Crichton wrote a review for &quot;The New Republic&quot; (as J. Michael Crichton), critiquing Kurt Vonnegut&#x27;s recently published &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot;. He also continued to write Lange novels: &quot;Zero Cool&quot; (1969), dealt with an American radiologist on vacation in Spain who is caught in a murderous crossfire between rival gangs seeking a precious artifact. &quot;The Venom Business&quot; (1969) relates the story of a smuggler who uses his exceptional skill as a snake handler to his advantage by importing snakes to be used by drug companies and universities for medical research.

The first novel that was published under Crichton&#x27;s name was &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot; (1969), which proved to be the most important novel of his career and established him as a bestselling author. The novel documented the efforts of a team of scientists investigating a deadly extraterrestrial microorganism that fatally clots human blood, causing death within two minutes. Crichton was inspired to write it after reading &quot;The IPCRESS File&quot; by Len Deighton while studying in England. Crichton says he was &quot;terrifically impressed&quot; by the book – &quot;a lot of &quot;Andromeda&quot; is traceable to &quot;Ipcress&quot; in terms of trying to create an imaginary world using recognizable techniques and real people.&quot; He wrote the novel over three years. The novel became an instant hit, and film rights were sold for $250,000. It was adapted into a 1971 film by director Robert Wise.

During his clinical rotations at the Boston City Hospital, Crichton grew disenchanted with the culture there, which appeared to emphasize the interests and reputations of doctors over the interests of patients. He graduated from Harvard, obtaining an MD in 1969, and undertook a post-doctoral fellowship study at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California, from 1969 to 1970. He never obtained a license to practice medicine, devoting himself to his writing career instead. Reflecting on his career in medicine years later, Crichton concluded that patients too often shunned responsibility for their own health, relying on doctors as miracle workers rather than advisors. He experimented with astral projection, aura viewing, and clairvoyance, coming to believe that these included real phenomena that scientists had too eagerly dismissed as paranormal.

Three more Crichton books under pseudonyms were published in 1970. Two were Lange novels, &quot;Drug of Choice&quot; and &quot;Grave Descend&quot;. &quot;Grave Descend&quot; earned him an Edgar Award nomination the following year. There was also &quot;&quot; written with his younger brother Douglas Crichton. &quot;Dealing&quot; was written under the pen name &quot;Michael Douglas&quot;, using their first names. Michael Crichton wrote it &quot;completely from beginning to end&quot;. Then his brother rewrote it from beginning to end, and then Crichton rewrote it again. This novel was . Around this time Crichton also wrote and sold an original film script, &quot;Morton&#x27;s Run&quot;. He also wrote the screenplay &quot;Lucifer Harkness in Darkness&quot;.

Aside from fiction, Crichton wrote several other books based on medical or scientific themes, often based upon his own observations in his field of expertise. In 1970, he published &quot;Five Patients&quot;, which recounts his experiences of hospital practices in the late 1960s at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. The book follows each of five patients through their hospital experience and the context of their treatment, revealing inadequacies in the hospital institution at the time. The book relates the experiences of Ralph Orlando, a construction worker seriously injured in a scaffold collapse; John O&#x27;Connor, a middle-aged dispatcher suffering from fever that has reduced him to a delirious wreck; Peter Luchesi, a young man who severs his hand in an accident; Sylvia Thompson, an airline passenger who suffers chest pains; and Edith Murphy, a mother of three who is diagnosed with a life-threatening disease. In &quot;Five Patients&quot;, Crichton examines a brief history of medicine up to 1969 to help place hospital culture and practice into context, and addresses the costs and politics of American healthcare. In 1974, he wrote a pilot script for a medical series, &quot;24 Hours&quot;, based on his book &quot;Five Patients&quot;, however, networks were not enthusiastic.

As a personal friend of the artist Jasper Johns, Crichton compiled many of Johns&#x27; works in a coffee table book, published as &quot;Jasper Johns&quot;. It was originally published in 1970 by Harry N. Abrams, Inc. in association with the Whitney Museum of American Art and again in January 1977, with a second revised edition published in 1994. The psychiatrist Janet Ross owned a copy of the painting &quot;Numbers&quot; by Jasper Johns in Crichton&#x27;s later novel &quot;The Terminal Man&quot;. The technophobic antagonist of the story found it odd that a person would paint numbers as they were inorganic. In 1972, Crichton published his last novel as John Lange: &quot;Binary&quot;, relates the story of a villainous middle-class businessman, who attempts to assassinate the President of the United States by stealing an army shipment of the two precursor chemicals that form a deadly nerve agent.

&quot;The Terminal Man&quot; (1972), is about a psychomotor epileptic sufferer, Harry Benson, who regularly suffers seizures followed by blackouts, and conducts himself inappropriately during seizures, waking up hours later with no knowledge of what he has done. Believed to be psychotic, he is investigated and electrodes are implanted in his brain. The book continued the preoccupation in Crichton&#x27;s novels with machine-human interaction and technology. The novel was adapted into a 1974 film directed by Mike Hodges and starring George Segal. Crichton was hired to adapt his novel &quot;The Terminal Man&quot; into a script by Warner Bros. The studio felt he had departed from the source material too much and had another writer adapt it for the 1974 film. ABC TV wanted to buy the film rights to Crichton&#x27;s novel &quot;Binary&quot;. The author agreed on the provision that he could direct the film. ABC agreed provided someone other than Crichton write the script. The result, &quot;Pursuit&quot; (1972) was a ratings success. Crichton then wrote and directed the 1973 low-budget science fiction western-thriller film &quot;Westworld&quot; about robots that run amok, which was his feature film directorial debut. It was the first feature film using 2D computer-generated imagery (CGI). The producer of &quot;Westworld&quot; hired Crichton to write an original script, which became the erotic thriller &quot;Extreme Close-Up&quot; (1973). Directed by Jeannot Szwarc, the movie disappointed Crichton.

===Period novels and directing (1975–1988)===

In 1975, Crichton wrote &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot;, which would become a bestseller. The novel is a recreation of the Great Gold Robbery of 1855, a massive gold heist, which takes place on a train traveling through Victorian era England. A considerable portion of the book was set in London. Crichton had become aware of the story when lecturing at the University of Cambridge. He later read the transcripts of the court trial and started researching the historical period.

In 1976, Crichton published &quot;Eaters of the Dead&quot;, a novel about a 10th-century Muslim who travels with a group of Vikings to their settlement. &quot;Eaters of the Dead&quot; is narrated as a scientific commentary on an old manuscript and was inspired by two sources. The first three chapters retell Ahmad ibn Fadlan&#x27;s personal account of his journey north and his experiences in encountering the Rus&#x27;, a Varangian tribe, whilst the remainder is based upon the story of Beowulf, culminating in battles with the &#x27;mist-monsters&#x27;, or &#x27;wendol&#x27;, a relict group of Neanderthals.

Crichton wrote and directed the suspense film &quot;Coma&quot; (1978), adapted from the 1977 novel of the same name by Robin Cook, a friend of his. There are other similarities in terms of genre and the fact that both Cook and Crichton had medical degrees, were of similar age, and wrote about similar subjects. The film was a popular success. Crichton then wrote and directed an adaptation of his own book, &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; (1978), starring Sean Connery and Donald Sutherland. The film would go on to be nominated for Best Cinematography Award by the British Society of Cinematographers, also garnering an Edgar Allan Poe Award for Best Motion Picture by the Mystery Writers Association of America.

In 1979, it was announced that Crichton would direct a movie version of his novel &quot;Eaters of the Dead&quot; for the newly formed Orion Pictures. This did not occur. Crichton pitched the idea of a modern day &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; to 20th Century Fox who paid him $1.5 million for the film rights to the novel, a screenplay and directorial fee for the movie, before a word had been written. He had never worked that way before, usually writing the book then selling it. He eventually managed to finish the book, titled &quot;Congo&quot;, which became a best seller. Crichton did the screenplay for &quot;Congo&quot; after he wrote and directed &quot;Looker&quot; (1981). &quot;Looker&quot; was a financial disappointment. Crichton came close to directing a film of &quot;Congo&quot; with Sean Connery, but the film did not happen. Eventually, a film version was made in 1995 by Frank Marshall. In 1984, Telarium released a graphic adventure based on &quot;Congo&quot;. Because Crichton had sold all adaptation rights to the novel, he set the game, named &quot;Amazon&quot;, in South America, and Amy the gorilla became Paco the parrot. That year Crichton also wrote and directed &quot;Runaway&quot; (1984), a police thriller set in the near future which was a box office disappointment.

Crichton had begun writing &quot;Sphere&quot; in 1967 as a companion piece to &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot;. His initial storyline began with American scientists discovering a 300-year-old spaceship underwater with stenciled markings in English. However, Crichton later realized that he &quot;didn&#x27;t know where to go with it&quot; and put off completing the book until a later date. The novel was published in 1987. It relates the story of psychologist Norman Johnson, who is required by the U.S. Navy to join a team of scientists assembled by the U.S. Government to examine an enormous alien spacecraft discovered on the bed of the Pacific Ocean, and believed to have been there for over 300 years. The novel begins as a science fiction story, but rapidly changes into a psychological thriller, ultimately exploring the nature of the human imagination. The novel was adapted into the 1998 film directed by Barry Levinson and starring Dustin Hoffman.

Crichton worked—-as a director only—on &quot;Physical Evidence&quot; (1989), a thriller originally conceived as a sequel to &quot;Jagged Edge&quot;. In 1988, Crichton was a visiting writer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. A book of autobiographical writings, &quot;Travels&quot;, was also published in 1988.

===&quot;Jurassic Park&quot; and subsequent works (1989–1999)===
In 1990, Crichton published the novel &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;. Crichton utilized the presentation of &quot;fiction as fact&quot;, used in his previous novels, &quot;Eaters of the Dead&quot; and &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot;. In addition, chaos theory and its philosophical implications are used to explain the collapse of an amusement park in a &quot;biological preserve&quot; on Isla Nublar, a fictional island to the west of Costa Rica. The novel had begun as a screenplay Crichton had written in 1983, about a graduate student who recreates a dinosaur. Reasoning that genetic research is expensive and that &quot;there is no pressing need to create a dinosaur&quot;, Crichton concluded that it would emerge from a &quot;desire to entertain&quot;, which led him to set the novel in a wildlife park of extinct animals. The story had originally been told from the point of view of a child, but Crichton changed it because everyone who read the draft felt it would be better if told by an adult.

Steven Spielberg learned of the novel in October 1989 while he and Crichton were discussing a screenplay that would later be developed into the television series &quot;ER&quot;. Before the book was published, Crichton demanded a non-negotiable fee of $1.5 million as well as a substantial percentage of the gross. Warner Bros. and Tim Burton, Sony Pictures Entertainment and Richard Donner, and 20th Century Fox and Joe Dante bid for the rights, but Universal eventually acquired the rights in May 1990 for Spielberg. Universal paid Crichton a further $500,000 to adapt his own novel, which he had completed by the time Spielberg was filming &quot;Hook&quot;. Crichton noted that, because the book was &quot;fairly long&quot;, his script only had about 10% to 20% of the novel&#x27;s content. The film, directed by Spielberg, was released in 1993.

In 1992, Crichton published the novel &quot;Rising Sun&quot;, an internationally bestselling crime thriller about a murder in the Los Angeles headquarters of Nakamoto, a fictional Japanese corporation. The book was adapted into the 1993 film directed by Philip Kaufman and starring Sean Connery and Wesley Snipes; it was released the same year as the adaptation of &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;.

The theme of his next novel, &quot;Disclosure&quot;, published in 1994, was sexual harassment—a theme previously explored in his 1972 novel, &quot;Binary&quot;. Unlike that novel however, &quot;Disclosure&quot; centers on sexual politics in the workplace, emphasizing an array of paradoxes in traditional gender roles by featuring a male protagonist who is being sexually harassed by a female executive. As a result, the book has been criticized harshly by some feminist commentators and accused of being anti-feminist. Crichton, anticipating this response, offered a rebuttal at the close of the novel which states that a &quot;role-reversal&quot; story uncovers aspects of the subject that would not be seen as easily with a female protagonist. The novel was made into a film the same year, directed by Barry Levinson and starring Michael Douglas and Demi Moore.

Crichton was the creator and an executive producer of the television drama &quot;ER&quot;, based on his 1974 pilot script &quot;24 Hours&quot;. Spielberg helped develop the show, serving as an executive producer for season one and offering advice (he insisted on Julianna Margulies becoming a regular, for example). It was also through Spielberg&#x27;s Amblin Entertainment that John Wells was attached as the show&#x27;s executive producer. In 1995, Crichton published &quot;The Lost World&quot; as a sequel to &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;. The title was a reference to Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s &quot;The Lost World&quot; (1912). It was made into the 1997 film two years later, again directed by Spielberg. In March 1994, Crichton said there would probably be a sequel novel as well as a film adaptation, stating that he had an idea for the novel&#x27;s story. In 1996, Crichton published &quot;Airframe&quot;, an aero-techno-thriller. The book continued Crichton&#x27;s overall theme of the failure of humans in human-machine interaction, given that the plane worked perfectly and the accident would not have occurred had the pilot reacted properly. He also wrote &quot;Twister&quot; (1996) with Anne-Marie Martin, his wife at the time.

In 1999, Crichton published &quot;Timeline&quot;, a science-fiction novel in which experts time travel back to the medieval period. The novel, which continued Crichton&#x27;s long history of combining technical details and action in his books, explores quantum physics and time travel directly; it was also warmly received by medieval scholars, who praised his depiction of the challenges involved in researching the Middle Ages. In 1999, Crichton founded Timeline Computer Entertainment with David Smith. Although he signed a multi-title publishing deal with Eidos Interactive, only one game, &quot;Timeline&quot;, was ever published. Released by Eidos Interactive on November 10, 2000, for PCs, the game received negative reviews. A 2003 film based on the book was directed by Richard Donner and starring Paul Walker, Gerard Butler and Frances O&#x27;Connor. &quot;Eaters of the Dead&quot; was adapted into the 1999 film &quot;The 13th Warrior&quot; directed by John McTiernan, who was later removed, with Crichton himself taking over direction of reshoots.

===Final novels and later life (2000–2008)===
In 2002, Crichton published &quot;Prey&quot;, about developments in science and technology, specifically nanotechnology. The novel explores relatively recent phenomena engendered by the work of the scientific community, such as: artificial life, emergence (and by extension, complexity), genetic algorithms, and agent-based computing. In 2004, Crichton published &quot;State of Fear&quot;, a novel concerning eco-terrorists who attempt mass murder to support their views. The novel&#x27;s central premise is that climate scientists exaggerate global warming. A review in &quot;Nature&quot; found the novel &quot;likely to mislead the unwary&quot;. The novel had an initial print run of 1.5 million copies and reached the No. 1 bestseller position at Amazon.com and No. 2 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for one week in January 2005.

The last novel published while he was still living was &quot;Next&quot; in 2006. The novel follows many characters, including transgenic animals, in a quest to survive in a world dominated by genetic research, corporate greed, and legal interventions, wherein government and private investors spend billions of dollars every year on genetic research. In 2006, Crichton clashed with journalist Michael Crowley, a senior editor of the magazine &quot;The New Republic&quot;. In March 2006, Crowley wrote a strongly critical review of &quot;State of Fear&quot;, focusing on Crichton&#x27;s stance on global warming. In the same year, Crichton published the novel &quot;Next&quot;, which contains a minor character named &quot;Mick Crowley&quot;, who is a Yale graduate and a Washington, D.C.–based political columnist. The character was portrayed as a child molester with a small penis. The real Crowley, also a Yale graduate, alleged that by including a similarly named character Crichton had libeled him.

===Posthumous works===
Several novels that were in various states of completion upon Crichton&#x27;s death have since been published. The first, &quot;Pirate Latitudes&quot;, was found as a manuscript on one of his computers after his death. It centers on a fictional privateer who attempts to raid a Spanish galleon. It was published in November 2009 by HarperCollins. Additionally, Crichton had completed the outline for and was roughly a third of the way through a novel titled &quot;Micro&quot;, a novel which centers on technology that shrinks humans to microscopic sizes. &quot;Micro&quot; was completed by Richard Preston using Crichton&#x27;s notes and files, and was published in November 2011.

On July 28, 2016, Crichton&#x27;s website and HarperCollins announced the publication of a third posthumous novel, titled &quot;Dragon Teeth&quot;, which he had written in 1974. It is a historical novel set during the Bone Wars, and includes the real life characters of Othniel Charles Marsh and Edward Drinker Cope. The novel was released in May 2017. In addition, some of his published works are being continued by other authors. On February 26, 2019, Crichton&#x27;s website and HarperCollins announced the publication of &quot;The Andromeda Evolution&quot;, the sequel to &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot;, a collaboration with CrichtonSun LLC. and author Daniel H. Wilson. It was released on November 12, 2019.

In 2020, it was announced that his unpublished works will be adapted into TV series and films in collaboration with CrichtonSun and Range Media Partners. On December 15, 2022, it was announced that James Patterson would coauthor a novel about a mega-eruption of Hawaii&#x27;s Mauna Loa volcano, based on an unfinished manuscript by Crichton. The novel, &quot;Eruption,&quot; was released on June 3, 2024.

==Scientific and legal career==
===Video games and computing===

In 1983, Crichton wrote &quot;Electronic Life&quot;, a book that introduces BASIC programming to its readers. The book, written like a glossary, with entries such as: &quot;Afraid of Computers (everybody is),&quot; &quot;Buying a Computer&quot; and &quot;Computer Crime,&quot; was intended to introduce the idea of personal computers to a reader who might be faced with the hardship of using them at work or at home for the first time. It defined basic computer jargon and assured readers that they could master the machine when it inevitably arrived. In his words, being able to program a computer is liberation: &quot;In my experience, you assert control over a computer—show it who&#x27;s the boss—by making it do something unique. That means programming it... If you devote a couple of hours to programming a new machine, you&#x27;ll feel better about it ever afterward.&quot;

In the book, Crichton predicts a number of events in the history of computer development, that computer networks would increase in importance as a matter of convenience, including the sharing of information and pictures that we see online today, which the telephone never could. He also makes predictions for computer games, dismissing them as &quot;the hula hoops of the 80s,&quot; and saying &quot;already there are indications that the mania for twitch games may be fading.&quot; In a section of the book called &quot;Microprocessors, or how I flunked biostatistics at Harvard,&quot; Crichton again seeks his revenge on the teacher who had given him abnormally low grades in college. Within the book, Crichton included many self-written demonstrative Applesoft (for Apple II) and BASICA (for IBM PC compatibles) programs.

&quot;Amazon&quot; is a graphical adventure game created by Crichton and produced by John Wells. Trillium released it in the United States in 1984 initially for the Apple II, Atari 8-bit computers, and Commodore 64. &quot;Amazon&quot; sold more than 100,000 copies, making it a significant commercial success at the time. It has plot elements similar to those previously used in &quot;Congo&quot;. Crichton started a company selling a computer program he had originally written to help him create budgets for his movies. He often sought to utilize computing in films, such as &quot;Westworld&quot;, which was the first film to employ computer-generated special effects. He also pushed Spielberg to include them in the &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; films. For his pioneering use of computer programs in film production he was awarded the Academy Award for Technical Achievement in 1995.

===Intellectual property cases===
In November 2006, at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., Crichton joked that he considered himself an expert in intellectual property law. He had been involved in several lawsuits with others claiming credit for his work. In 1985, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit heard &quot;Berkic v. Crichton&quot;, 761 F.2d 1289 (1985). Plaintiff Ted Berkic wrote a screenplay called &quot;Reincarnation Inc.&quot;, which he claims Crichton plagiarized for the movie &quot;Coma&quot;. The court ruled in Crichton&#x27;s favor, stating the works were not substantially similar. In the 1996 case, &quot;Williams v. Crichton&quot;, 84 F.3d 581 (2d Cir. 1996), Geoffrey Williams claimed that &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; violated his copyright covering his dinosaur-themed children&#x27;s stories published in the late 1980s. The court granted summary judgment in favor of Crichton. In 1998, A United States District Court in Missouri heard the case of &quot;Kessler v. Crichton&quot; that actually went all the way to a jury trial, unlike the other cases. Plaintiff Stephen Kessler claimed the movie &quot;Twister&quot; (1996) was based on his work &quot;Catch the Wind&quot;. It took the jury about 45 minutes to reach a verdict in favor of Crichton. After the verdict, Crichton refused to shake Kessler&#x27;s hand. Crichton later summarized his intellectual property legal cases: &quot;I always win.&quot;

===Global warming===

Crichton became well known for attacking the science behind global warming. He testified on the subject before Congress in 2005. His views would be contested by a number of scientists and commentators. An example is meteorologist Jeffrey Masters&#x27;s review of Crichton&#x27;s 2004 novel &quot;State of Fear&quot;:

Peter Doran, author of the paper in the January 2002 issue of &quot;Nature&quot;, which reported the finding referred to above, stating that some areas of Antarctica had cooled between 1986 and 2000, wrote an opinion piece in &quot;The New York Times&quot; of July 27, 2006, in which he stated &quot;Our results have been misused as &#x27;evidence&#x27; against global warming by Michael Crichton in his novel &quot;State of Fear.&quot;&quot; Al Gore said on March 21, 2007, before a U.S. House committee: &quot;The planet has a fever. If your baby has a fever, you go to the doctor... if your doctor tells you you need to intervene here, you don&#x27;t say &#x27;Well, I read a science fiction novel that tells me it&#x27;s not a problem. Several commentators have interpreted this as a reference to &quot;State of Fear&quot;.

==Literary technique and style==
Crichton&#x27;s novels, including &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, have been described by &quot;The Guardian&quot; as &quot;harking back to the fantasy adventure fiction of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Jules Verne, Edgar Rice Burroughs, and Edgar Wallace, but with a contemporary spin, assisted by cutting-edge technology references made accessible for the general reader.&quot; According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;Michael Crichton wasn&#x27;t really interested in characters, but his innate talent for storytelling enabled him to breathe new life into the science fiction thriller.&quot; Like &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; has also noted the boys adventure quality to his novels interfused with modern technology and science. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;,
Crichton&#x27;s works were frequently cautionary, his plots often portrayed scientific advancements going awry, commonly resulting in worst-case scenarios. A notable recurring theme in Crichton&#x27;s plots is the pathological failure of complex systems and their safeguards, whether biological (&quot;Jurassic Park&quot;), militaristic/organizational (&quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot;), technological (&quot;Airframe&quot;), or cybernetic (&quot;Westworld&quot;). This theme of the inevitable breakdown of &quot;perfect&quot; systems and the failure of &quot;fail-safe measures&quot; can be seen strongly in the poster for &quot;Westworld&quot;, whose slogan was, &quot;Where nothing can possibly go worng&quot;, and in the discussion of chaos theory in &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;. His 1973 movie &quot;Westworld&quot; contains one of the earliest references to a computer virus and is the first mention of the concept of a computer virus in a movie. Crichton believed, however, that his view of technology had been misunderstood as
The use of author surrogate was a feature of Crichton&#x27;s writings from the beginning of his career. In &quot;A Case of Need&quot;, one of his pseudonymous whodunit stories, Crichton used first-person narrative to portray the hero, a Bostonian pathologist, who is running against the clock to clear a friend&#x27;s name from medical malpractice in a girl&#x27;s death from a hack-job abortion. Crichton has used the literary technique known as the false document. &quot;Eaters of the Dead&quot; is a &quot;recreation&quot; of the Old English epic&quot; Beowulf&quot; presented as a scholarly translation of Ahmad ibn Fadlan&#x27;s 10th century manuscript. &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot; and&quot; Jurassic Park &quot;incorporate fictionalized scientific documents in the form of diagrams, computer output, DNA sequences, footnotes, and bibliography. &quot;The Terminal Man&quot; and &quot;State of Fear&quot; include authentic published scientific works that illustrate the premise point. Crichton often employs the premise of diverse experts or specialists assembled to tackle a unique problem requiring their individual talents and knowledge. The premise was used for &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot;, &quot;Sphere&quot;, &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, and, to a lesser extent, &quot;Timeline&quot;. Sometimes the individual characters in this dynamic work in the private sector and are suddenly called upon by the government to form an immediate response team once some incident or discovery triggers their mobilization. This premise or plot device has been imitated and used by other authors and screenwriters in several books, movies and television shows since.

==Personal life==
As an adolescent, Crichton felt isolated because of his height (6 ft 9 in, or 206 cm). During the 1970s and 1980s, he consulted psychics and enlightenment gurus to make him feel more socially acceptable and to improve his positive karma. As a result of these experiences, Crichton practiced meditation throughout much of his life. While he is often regarded as a deist, he never publicly confirmed this. When asked in an online Q&amp;A if he were a spiritual person, Crichton responded with: &quot;Yes, but it is difficult to talk about.&quot;

Crichton was a workaholic. When drafting a novel, which would typically take him six or seven weeks, Crichton withdrew completely to follow what he called &quot;a structured approach&quot; of ritualistic self-denial. As he neared writing the end of each book, he would rise increasingly early each day, meaning that he would sleep for less than four hours by going to bed at 10 p.m. and waking at 2 am.

In 1992, Crichton was ranked among &quot;People&quot; magazine&#x27;s 50 most beautiful people. He married five times. Four of the marriages ended in divorce: Joan Radam (1965–1970); Kathleen St. Johns (1978–1980); Suzanna Childs (1981–1983); and actress Anne-Marie Martin (1987–2003), the mother of his daughter (born 1989). At the time of his death, Crichton was married to Sherri Alexander (married 2005), who was six months pregnant with their son, born on February 12, 2009.

===Politics===
From 1990 to 1995, Crichton donated $9,750 to Democratic candidates for office. According to Pat Choate, Crichton was a supporter of Reform candidate Ross Perot in the 1996 United States presidential election. Crichton&#x27;s 1992 novel &quot;Rising Sun&quot; delved into the political and economic effect of Japan–United States relations. The novel warns against foreign direct investment in the U.S. economy, with Crichton describing it in interviews as &quot;economic suicide&quot; for America. Crichton stated that his novel was written as a &quot;wakeup call&quot; to Americans.

In a 2003 speech, Crichton warned against partisanship in environmental legislation, arguing for an apolitical environmentalist movement. In 2005, Crichton reportedly met with Republican President George W. Bush to discuss Crichton&#x27;s novel &quot;State of Fear&quot;, of which Bush was a fan. According to Fred Barnes, Bush and Crichton &quot;talked for an hour and were in near-total agreement.&quot; In September 2005, Crichton testified on climate change before the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. Crichton testified about his doubts that human activities are significantly contributing to global warming, and encouraged U.S. lawmakers to more closely examine the methodology of climate science before voting on policy. His testimony received praise from Republican Senator Jim Inhofe, and criticism from Democratic Senator Hillary Clinton.

===Illness and death===
According to Crichton&#x27;s brother Douglas, Crichton was diagnosed with lymphoma in early 2008. In accordance with the private way in which Crichton lived, his cancer was not made public until his death. He was undergoing chemotherapy treatment at the time of his death, and Crichton&#x27;s physicians and relatives had been expecting him to recover. He died at age 66 on November 4, 2008.

Crichton had an extensive collection of 20th-century American art, which Christie&#x27;s auctioned in May 2010.

==Reception==
===Science fiction novels===
Most of Crichton&#x27;s novels address issues emerging in scientific research fields. In a number of his novels (&quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, &quot;The Lost World&quot;, &quot;Next&quot;, &quot;Congo&quot;) genomics plays an important role. Usually, the drama revolves around the sudden eruption of a scientific crisis, revealing the disruptive impacts new forms of knowledge and technology may have, as is stated in &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot;, Crichton&#x27;s first science fiction novel: &quot;This book recounts the five-day history of a major American scientific crisis&quot; (1969, p. 3) or &quot;The Terminal Man&quot; where unexpected behaviors are realized when electrodes are implanted into a person&#x27;s brain.

==Speeches==

Crichton was a popular public speaker. He delivered a number of notable speeches in his lifetime, particularly on the topic of global warming.

===&quot;Intelligence Squared debate&quot;===
On March 14, 2007, Intelligence Squared held a debate in New York City for which the motion was &quot;Global Warming Is Not a Crisis&quot;, moderated by Brian Lehrer. Crichton was for the motion, along with Richard Lindzen and Philip Stott, versus Gavin Schmidt, Richard Somerville, and Brenda Ekwurze, who were against the motion. Before the debate, the audience had voted largely against the motion (57% to 30%, with 13% undecided). At the end of the debate, there was a greater shift in the audience vote for the motion (46% to 42%, with 12% undecided), resulting in Crichton&#x27;s group winning the debate. Although Crichton inspired numerous blog responses and his contribution to the debate was considered one of his best rhetorical performances, reception of his message was mixed.

===Other speeches===
===&quot;Mediasaurus: The Decline of Conventional Media&quot;===
In a speech delivered at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., on April 7, 1993, Crichton predicted the decline of mainstream media.

===&quot;Ritual Abuse, Hot Air, and Missed Opportunities: Science Views Media&quot;===
The AAAS invited Crichton to address scientists concerns about how they are portrayed in the media, which was delivered to the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Anaheim, California on January 25, 1999.

===&quot;Environmentalism as Religion&quot;===
This was not the first discussion of environmentalism as a religion, but it caught on and was widely quoted. Crichton explains his view that religious approaches to the environment are inappropriate and cause damage to the natural world they intend to protect. The speech was delivered to the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco, California on September 15, 2003.

===&quot;Science Policy in the 21st century&quot;===
Crichton outlined several issues before a joint meeting of liberal and conservative think tanks. The speech was delivered at AEI–Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., on January 25, 2005.

===&quot;The Case for Skepticism on Global Warming&quot;===
On January 25, 2005, at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., Crichton delivered a detailed explanation of why he criticized the consensus view on global warming. Using published UN data, he argued that claims for catastrophic warming arouse doubt and that reducing CO2 is vastly more difficult than is commonly presumed. He spoke on why societies are morally unjustified in spending vast sums on a speculative issue when people around the world are dying of starvation and disease.

===&quot;Caltech Michelin Lecture&quot;===
&quot;Aliens Cause Global Warming&quot; January 17, 2003. In the spirit of his science fiction writing, Crichton details research on nuclear winter and SETI Drake equations relative to global warming science.

===&quot;Testimony before the United States Senate&quot;===
Crichton was invited to testify before the Senate in September 2005, as an &quot;expert witness on global warming.&quot; The speech was delivered to the Committee on Environment and Public Works in Washington, D.C.

===&quot;Complexity Theory and Environmental Management&quot;===
In previous speeches, Crichton criticized environmental groups for failing to incorporate complexity theory. Here he explains in detail why complexity theory is essential to environmental management, using the history of Yellowstone Park as an example of what not to do. The speech was delivered to the Washington Center for Complexity and Public Policy in Washington, D.C., on November 6, 2005.

===&quot;Genetic Research and Legislative Needs&quot;===
While writing &quot;Next&quot;, Crichton concluded that laws covering genetic research desperately needed to be revised, and spoke to congressional staff members about problems ahead. The speech was delivered to a group of legislative staffers in Washington, D.C., on September 14, 2006.

===Gell-Mann amnesia effect ===

In a speech in 2002, Crichton coined the term Gell-Mann amnesia effect to describe the phenomenon of experts reading articles within their fields of expertise and finding them to be error-ridden and full of misunderstanding, but seemingly forgetting those experiences when reading articles in the same publications written on topics outside of their fields of expertise, which they believe to be credible. He explained that he had chosen the name ironically, because he had once discussed the effect with physicist Murray Gell-Mann, &quot;and by dropping a famous name I imply greater importance to myself, and to the effect, than it would otherwise have.&quot;

==Legacy==
In 2002, a genus of ankylosaurid, &quot;Crichtonsaurus bohlini&quot;, was named in his honor. This species was concluded to be dubious however, and some of the diagnostic fossil material was then transferred into the new binomial &quot;Crichtonpelta benxiensis&quot;, also named in his honor. His literary works continue to be adapted into films, making him the 20th highest grossing story creator of all time.

<text>In western classical music theory, the minor scale refers to three scale patterns – the natural minor scale (or Aeolian mode), the [[harmonic minor scale]], and the melodic minor scale (ascending or descending).



These scales contain all three notes of a minor triad: the root, a minor third (rather than the major third, as in a major triad or major scale), and a perfect fifth (rather than the diminished fifth, as in a diminished scale or half diminished scale).

Minor scale is also used to refer to other scales with this property, such as the Dorian mode or the minor pentatonic scale (see other minor scales below).

==Natural minor scale==
===Relationship to relative major===
A natural minor scale (or Aeolian mode) is a diatonic scale that is built by starting on the sixth degree of its relative major scale. For instance, the A natural minor scale can be built by starting on the 6th degree of the C major scale:

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f
\relative c&#x27; { 
 \clef treble \time 7/4
 c4^\markup { C major scale } d e f g
\override NoteHead.color = #red a \override NoteHead.color = #black b c2 \bar &quot;||&quot;
 \time 9/4
 \override NoteHead.color = #red a,4^\markup { A natural minor scale } \override NoteHead.color = #black b c d e f g a2 }
&lt;/score&gt;

Because of this, the key of A minor is called the &quot;relative minor&quot; of C major. Every major key has a relative minor, which starts on the 6th scale degree or step. For instance, since the 6th degree of F major is D, the relative minor of F major is D minor.

===Relationship to parallel major===
A natural minor scale can also be constructed by altering a major scale with accidentals. In this way, a natural minor scale is represented by the following notation:

: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

This notation is based on the major scale, and represents each degree (each note in the scale) by a number, starting with the tonic (the first, lowest note of the scale). By making use of flat symbols () this notation thus represents notes by how they deviate from the notes in the major scale. Because of this, we say that a number without a flat represents a major (or perfect) interval, while a number with a flat represents a minor interval. In this example, the numbers mean:
* 1 = (perfect) unison
* 2 = major second
* 3 = minor third
* 4 = perfect fourth
* 5 = perfect fifth
* 6 = minor sixth
* 7 = minor seventh
* 8 = (perfect) octave

Thus, for instance, the A natural minor scale can be built by lowering the third, sixth, and seventh degrees of the A major scale by one semitone:

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f
\relative c&#x27; { 
 \clef treble \time 7/4
 a4^\markup { A major scale } b \override NoteHead.color = #red cis \override NoteHead.color = #black d e \override NoteHead.color = #red fis gis \override NoteHead.color = #black a2 \bar &quot;||&quot;
 \time 9/4
 a,4^\markup { A natural minor scale } b \override NoteHead.color = #red c! \override NoteHead.color = #black d e \override NoteHead.color = #red f! g! \override NoteHead.color = #black a2 }
&lt;/score&gt;

Because they share the same tonic note of A, the key of A minor is called the &quot;parallel minor&quot; of A major.

===Intervals===

The intervals between the notes of a natural minor scale follow the sequence below:
: whole, half, whole, whole, half, whole, whole

where &quot;whole&quot; stands for a whole tone (a red u-shaped curve in the figure), and &quot;half&quot; stands for a semitone (a red angled line in the figure).

The natural minor scale is maximally even.

==Harmonic minor scale==

===Construction===
The harmonic minor scale (or Aeolian 7 scale) has the same notes as the natural minor scale except that the seventh degree is raised by one semitone, creating an augmented second between the sixth and seventh degrees.

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f
\relative c&#x27; { 
 \clef treble \time 7/4
 a4^\markup { A harmonic minor scale } b c d e f gis a2 }
&lt;/score&gt;
Thus, a harmonic minor scale is represented by the following notation:

: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
A harmonic minor scale can be built by lowering the 3rd and 6th degrees of the parallel major scale by one semitone.

Because of this construction, the 7th degree of the harmonic minor scale functions as a leading tone to the tonic because it is a &quot;semitone&quot; lower than the tonic, rather than a &quot;whole tone&quot; lower than the tonic as it is in natural minor scales.

===Intervals===
The intervals between the notes of a harmonic minor scale follow the sequence below:

: whole, half, whole, whole, half, augmented second, half

===Uses===
While it evolved primarily as a basis for chords, the harmonic minor with its augmented second is sometimes used melodically. Instances can be found in Mozart, Beethoven (for example, the finale of his String Quartet No. 14), and Schubert (for example, in the first movement of the &quot;Death and the Maiden Quartet&quot;). In this role, it is used while descending far more often than while ascending. A familiar example of the descending scale is heard in a Ring of bells. A ring of twelve is sometimes augmented with a 5♯ and 6♭ to make a 10 note harmonic minor scale from bell 2 to bell 11 (for example, Worcester Cathedral).

The Hungarian minor scale is similar to the harmonic minor scale but with a raised 4th degree. This scale is sometimes also referred to as &quot;Gypsy Run&quot;, or alternatively &quot;Egyptian Minor Scale&quot;, as mentioned by Miles Davis who describes it in his autobiography as &quot;something that I&#x27;d learned at Juilliard&quot;.

In popular music, examples of songs in harmonic minor include Katy B&#x27;s &quot;Easy Please Me&quot;, Bobby Brown&#x27;s &quot;My Prerogative&quot;, and Jazmine Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;Bust Your Windows&quot;. The scale also had a notable influence on heavy metal, spawning a sub-genre known as neoclassical metal, with guitarists such as Chuck Schuldiner, Yngwie Malmsteen, Ritchie Blackmore, and Randy Rhoads employing it in their music.

==Melodic minor scale==

===Construction===
The distinctive sound of the harmonic minor scale comes from the augmented second between its sixth and seventh scale degrees. While some composers have used this interval to advantage in melodic composition, others felt it to be an awkward leap, particularly in vocal music, and preferred a whole step between these scale degrees for smooth melody writing. To eliminate the augmented second, these composers either raised the sixth degree by a semitone or lowered the seventh by a semitone.

The melodic minor scale is formed by using &quot;both&quot; of these solutions. In particular, the raised sixth appears in the ascending form of the scale, while the lowered seventh appears in the descending form of the scale. Traditionally, these two forms are referred to as:
* the &quot;ascending melodic minor scale&quot; or jazz minor scale (also known as the Ionian 3 or Dorian 7): this form of the scale is also the 5th mode of the acoustic scale.
* the &quot;descending melodic minor scale&quot;: this form is identical to the natural minor scale .
The ascending and descending forms of the A melodic minor scale are shown below:

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f\relative c&#x27; {
 \clef treble \time 7/4 \hide Staff.TimeSignature
 \override Voice.TextScript.font-size = #-2
 a4^\markup { Ascending melodic minor } b c d e fis gis
 a^\markup { Descending melodic minor } g! f! e d c b a2 }

&lt;/score&gt;
The ascending melodic minor scale can be notated as

: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

while the descending melodic minor scale is

: 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

Using these notations, the two melodic minor scales can be built by altering the parallel major scale.

===Intervals===
The intervals between the notes of an ascending melodic minor scale follow the sequence below:
: whole, half, whole, whole, whole, whole, half

The intervals between the notes of a descending melodic minor scale are the same as those of a descending natural minor scale.

===Uses===
Composers have not been consistent in using the two forms of the melodic minor scale. Composers frequently require the lowered 7th degree found in the natural minor in order to avoid the augmented triad (III) that arises in the ascending form of the scale.

Examples of the use of melodic minor in rock and popular music include Elton John&#x27;s &quot;Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word&quot;, which makes, &quot;a nod to the common practice... by the use of F [the leading tone in G minor] as the penultimate note of the final cadence.&quot; The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Yesterday&quot; also partly uses the melodic minor scale.

==Other minor scales==
Other scales with a minor third and a perfect fifth (i.e. containing a minor triad) are also commonly referred to as minor scales.

Within the diatonic modes of the major scale, in addition to the Aeolian mode (which is the natural minor scale), the Dorian mode and the Phrygian mode also fall under this definition. Conversely, the Locrian mode has a minor third, but a &quot;diminished&quot; fifth (thus containing a diminished triad), and is therefore not commonly referred to as a minor scale.

The Hungarian minor scale is another heptatonic (7-note) scale referred to as minor.

The Jazz minor scale is a name for the melodic minor scale when only the &quot;ascending form&quot; is used.

Non-heptatonic scales may also be called &quot;minor&quot;, such as the minor pentatonic scale.

===Limits of terminology===
While any other scale containing a minor triad could be defined as a &quot;minor scale&quot;, the terminology is less commonly used for some scales, especially those further outside the western classical tradition.

The hexatonic (6-note) blues scale is similar to the minor pentatonic scale and fits the above definition. However, the flat fifth is present as a passing tone along with the perfect fifth, and the scale is often played with microtonal mixing of the major and minor thirds – thus making it harder to classify as a &quot;major&quot; or &quot;minor&quot; scale.

The two Neapolitan scales are both &quot;minor scales&quot; following the above definition, but were historically referred to as the &quot;Neapolitan Major&quot; or &quot;Neapolitan Minor&quot; based rather on the quality of their &quot;sixth&quot; degree.

==Key signature==
In modern notation, the key signature for music in a minor key is typically based on the accidentals of the &quot;natural&quot; minor scale, not on those of the harmonic or melodic minor scales. For example, a piece in E minor will have one sharp in its key signature because the E natural minor scale has one sharp (F).

Major and minor keys that share the same key signature are &quot;relative&quot; to each other. For instance, F major is the relative major of D minor since both have key signatures with one flat. Since the natural minor scale is built on the 6th degree of the major scale, the tonic of the relative minor is a major sixth above the tonic of the major scale. For instance, B minor is the relative minor of D major because the note B is a major sixth above D. As a result, the key signatures of B minor and D major both have two sharps (F and C).

== Other notations and usage ==
(As shown in this ,) when expressing the names of minor scale keys as abbreviations, the alphabet of the corresponding tonic note name can be written in lower case letters to indicate only the tonic note name. For example, when expressing the English notation of A minor, It can be abbreviated as &#x27;a&#x27;. Plus, when expressing the names of major scale keys as abbreviations, the Roman alphabet of the corresponding tonic note is sometimes upper case to indicate only the tonic note name. For example, when expressing the English notation of C major, It is abbreviated as &#x27;C&#x27;.

<doc id="20767" wikidata="Q130873" url="?curid=20767" title="Menachem Begin">
<text>Menachem Begin ( &quot;Menaḥem Begin&quot;, ; (Polish documents, 1931–1937); ; 16 August 1913 – 9 March 1992) was an Israeli politician, founder of both Herut and Likud and the sixth Prime Minister of Israel.

Before the creation of the state of Israel, he was the leader of the Zionist militant group Irgun, the Revisionist breakaway from the larger Jewish paramilitary organization Haganah. He proclaimed a revolt, on 1 February 1944, against the British mandatory government, which was opposed by the Jewish Agency. As head of the Irgun, he targeted the British in Palestine, with a notable attack being the King David Hotel bombing. Later, the Irgun fought the Arabs during the 1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine and, as its chief, Begin was described by the British government as the &quot;leader of the notorious terrorist organisation&quot;. It declined him an entry visa to the United Kingdom between 1953 and 1955. However, Begin&#x27;s overtures of friendship eventually paid off and he was granted a visa in 1972, five years prior to becoming prime minister.

Begin was elected to the first Knesset, as head of Herut, the party he founded, and was at first on the political fringe, embodying the opposition to the Mapai-led government and Israeli establishment. He remained in opposition in the eight consecutive elections (except for a national unity government around the Six-Day War), but became more acceptable to the political center. His 1977 electoral victory and premiership ended three decades of Labor Party political dominance.

Begin&#x27;s most significant achievement as Prime Minister was the signing of a peace treaty with Egypt in 1979, for which he and Anwar Sadat shared the Nobel Peace Prize. In the wake of the Camp David Accords, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) withdrew from the Sinai Peninsula, which had been captured from Egypt in the Six-Day War. Later, Begin&#x27;s government promoted the construction of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Begin authorized the bombing of the Osirak nuclear plant in Iraq and the invasion of Lebanon in 1982 to fight PLO strongholds there, igniting the 1982 Lebanon War. As Israeli military involvement in Lebanon deepened, and the Sabra and Shatila massacre, carried out by Christian Phalangist militia allies of the Israelis, shocked world public opinion, Begin grew increasingly isolated. As IDF forces remained mired in Lebanon and the economy suffered from hyperinflation, the public pressure on Begin mounted. Depressed by the death of his wife Aliza in November 1982, he gradually withdrew from public life, until his resignation in October 1983.

==Biography==

Menachem Begin was born to Zeev Dov and Hassia Begun in what was then Brest-Litovsk in the Russian Empire (today Brest, Belarus). He was the youngest of three children. On his mother&#x27;s side he was descended from distinguished rabbis. His father, a timber merchant, was a community leader, a passionate Zionist, and an admirer of Theodor Herzl. The midwife who attended his birth was the grandmother of Ariel Sharon.

After a year of a traditional cheder education Begin started studying at a &quot;Tachkemoni&quot; school, associated with the religious Zionist movement. In his childhood, Begin, like most Jewish children in his town, was a member of the Zionist scouts movement Hashomer Hatzair. He was a member of Hashomer Hatzair until the age of 13, and at 16, he joined Betar. At 14, he was sent to a Polish government school, where he received a solid grounding in classical literature.

Begin studied law at the University of Warsaw, where he learned the oratory and rhetoric skills that became his trademark as a politician, and viewed as demagogy by his critics.
During his studies, he organized a self-defense group of Jewish students to counter harassment by anti-Semites on campus. He graduated in 1935, but never practiced law. At this time he became a disciple of Vladimir &quot;Ze&#x27;ev&quot; Jabotinsky, the founder of the nationalist Revisionist Zionism movement and its youth wing, Betar. His rise within Betar was rapid: at 22, he shared the dais with his mentor at the Betar World Congress in Kraków. The pre-war Polish government actively supported Zionist youth and paramilitary movements. In 1937 he was the active head of Betar in Czechoslovakia and became head of the largest branch, that of Poland. As head of Betar&#x27;s Polish branch, Begin traveled among regional branches to encourage supporters and recruit new members. To save money, he stayed at the homes of Betar members. During one such visit, he met his future wife Aliza Arnold, who was the daughter of his host. The couple married on 29 May 1939. They had three children: Binyamin, Leah and Hassia.

Living in Warsaw in Poland, Begin encouraged Betar to set up an organization to bring Polish Jews to Palestine. He unsuccessfully attempted to smuggle 1,500 Jews into Romania at the end of August 1939. Returning to Warsaw afterward, he left three days after the German 1939 invasion began, first to the southwest and then to Wilno.

In September 1939, after Germany invaded Poland, Begin, in common with a large part of Warsaw&#x27;s Jewish leadership, escaped to Wilno (today Vilnius), then eastern Poland, to avoid inevitable arrest. The town was soon occupied by the Soviet Union, but from 28 October 1939, it was the capital of the Republic of Lithuania. Wilno was a predominately Polish and Jewish town; an estimated 40 percent of the population was Jewish, with the YIVO institute located there. As a prominent pre-war Zionist and reserve status officer-cadet, on 20 September 1940, Begin was arrested by the NKVD and detained in the Lukiškės Prison. In later years he wrote about his experience of being tortured. He was accused of being an &quot;agent of British imperialism&quot; and sentenced to eight years in the Soviet gulag camps. On 1 June 1941 he was sent to the Pechora labor camps in Komi Republic, the northern part of European Russia. Much later in life, Begin recorded and reflected upon his experiences in the interrogations and life in the camp in his memoir &quot;White Nights&quot;.

In July 1941, just after Germany attacked the Soviet Union, and following his release under the Sikorski–Mayski agreement because he was a Polish national, Begin joined the Free Polish Anders&#x27; Army as a corporal officer cadet. He was later sent with the army to Palestine via the Persian Corridor, where he arrived in May 1942.

Upon arriving in Palestine, Begin, like many other Polish Jewish soldiers of the Anders&#x27; Army, faced a choice between remaining with the Anders&#x27; Army to fight Nazi Germany in Europe, or staying in Palestine to fight for establishment of a Jewish state. While he initially wished to remain with the Polish army, he was eventually persuaded to change his mind by his contacts in the Irgun, as well as Polish officers sympathetic to the Zionist cause. Consequently, General Michał Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski, the second-in-command of the Army, issued Begin with a &quot;leave of absence without an expiration&quot; which gave Begin official permission to stay in Palestine. In December 1942 he left Anders&#x27;s Army and joined the Irgun.

During the Holocaust, Begin&#x27;s father was among the 5,000 Brest Jews rounded up by the Nazis at the end of June 1941. Instead of being sent to a forced labor camp, they were shot or drowned in the river. His mother and his elder brother Herzl also were murdered in the Holocaust.

===Jewish underground===

Begin quickly made a name for himself as a fierce critic of the dominant Zionist leadership for being too cooperative with the British, and argued that the only way to save the Jews of Europe, who were facing extermination, was to compel the British to leave so that a Jewish state could be established. In 1942 he joined the Irgun (&quot;Etzel&quot;), an underground Zionist paramilitary organization which had split from the main Jewish military organization, the Haganah, in 1931. Begin assumed the Irgun&#x27;s leadership in 1944, determined to force the British government to remove its troops entirely from Palestine. The official Jewish leadership institutions in Palestine, the Jewish Agency and Jewish National Council (&quot;Vaad Leumi&quot;), backed up by their military arm, the Haganah, had refrained from directly challenging British authority. They were convinced that the British would establish a Jewish state after the war due to support for the Zionist cause among both the Conservative and Labour parties. Giving as reasons that the British had reneged on the promises given in the Balfour Declaration and that the White Paper of 1939 restricting Jewish immigration was an escalation of their pro-Arab policy, he decided to break with the official institutions and launch an armed rebellion against British rule, in cooperation with Lehi, another breakaway Zionist group.

Begin had also carefully studied the tactics of the Indian independence movement. Even more importantly, during multiple meetings with Jewish Lord Mayor of Dublin and senior IRA veteran Robert Briscoe, who jokingly described himself as the &quot;Chair of Subversive Activity against England&quot;, Begin had also carefully studied the highly successful use of guerrilla warfare tactics by Michael Collins during the Irish War of Independence. While planning the rebellion with Irgun commanders, Begin accordingly devised a highly similar strategy that he believed would force the British Empire out. He proposed a series of guerrilla warfare attacks that would humiliate the British Empire and damage their prestige; this would cause the British Cabinet, as they had with the Black and Tans and the Auxiliary Division in Ireland, to unleash indiscriminate total war tactics against the whole Jewish civilian population, which would completely alienate the Yishuv. Similarly to Michael Collins, Begin banked on the international media being attracted to the action, which he referred to as turning Palestine into a &quot;glass house&quot;, as the whole world looked inside. He knew that British total war and civilian repression would create both global sympathy for the Irgun&#x27;s cause and international diplomatic pressure on Britain. Ultimately, the British Cabinet would be forced to choose between further escalating the repression or complete withdrawal, and Begin was certain that in the end, the British would leave. Further, so as not to disturb the Allied war effort against Nazi Germany, only British civilian administration and Palestine Police Force targets would be attacked at first, while British armed forces personnel would only be attacked after Adolf Hitler had been defeated.

On 1 February 1944, the Irgun proclaimed a revolt. Twelve days later, it put its plan into action when Irgun teams bombed the empty offices of the British Mandate&#x27;s Immigration Department in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, and Haifa. The Irgun next bombed the Income Tax Offices in those three cities, followed by a series of attacks on police stations in which two Irgun fighters and six policemen were killed. Meanwhile, Lehi joined the revolt with a series of shooting attacks on policemen.

The Irgun and Lehi attacks intensified throughout 1944. These operations were financed by demanding money from Jewish merchants and engaging in insurance scams in the local diamond industry.

In 1944, after Lehi gunmen assassinated Lord Moyne, the British Resident Minister in the Middle East, the official Jewish authorities, fearing British retaliation, ordered the Haganah to undertake a campaign of collaboration with the British. Known as The Hunting Season, the campaign seriously crippled the Irgun for several months, while Lehi, having agreed to suspend their anti-British attacks, was spared. Begin, anxious to prevent a civil war, ordered his men not to retaliate or resist being taken captive, convinced that the Irgun could ride out the Season, and that the Jewish Agency would eventually side with the Irgun when it became apparent the British government had no intention of making concessions. Gradually, shamed at participating in what was viewed as a collaborationist campaign, the enthusiasm of the Haganah began to wane, and Begin&#x27;s assumptions were proven correct. The Irgun&#x27;s restraint also earned it much sympathy from the Yishuv, whereas previously it had been assumed by many that it had placed its own political interests before those of the Yishuv.

In the summer of 1945, as it became clear that the British were not planning on establishing a Jewish state and would not allow significant Jewish immigration to Palestine, Jewish public opinion shifted decisively against the British, and the Jewish authorities sent feelers to the Irgun and Lehi to discuss an alliance. The result was the Jewish Resistance Movement, a framework under which the Haganah, Irgun, and Lehi launched coordinated series of anti-British operations. For several months in 1945–46, the Irgun fought as part of the Jewish Resistance Movement. Following Operation Agatha, during which the British arrested many Jews, seized arms caches, and occupied the Jewish Agency building, from which many documents were removed, Begin ordered an attack on the British military and administrative headquarters at the King David Hotel following a request from the Haganah, although the Haganah&#x27;s permission was later rescinded. The King David Hotel bombing resulted in the destruction of the building&#x27;s southern wing, and 91 people, mostly British, Arabs, and Jews, were killed.

The fragile partnership collapsed following the bombing, partly because contrary to instructions, it was carried out during the busiest part of the day at the hotel. The Haganah, from then on, would rarely mount attacks against British forces and would focus mainly on the Aliyah Bet illegal immigration campaign, and while it occasionally took half-hearted measures against the Irgun, it never returned to full-scale collaboration with the British. The Irgun and Lehi continued waging a full-scale insurgency against the British, and together with the Haganah&#x27;s illegal immigration campaign, this forced a large commitment of British forces to Palestine that was gradually sapping British financial resources. Three particular Irgun operations directly ordered by Begin: the Night of the Beatings, the Acre Prison break, and the Sergeants affair, were cited as particularly influencing the British to leave due to the great loss of British prestige and growing public opposition to Britain remaining in Palestine at home they generated. In September 1947, the British cabinet voted to leave Palestine, and in November of that year, the United Nations approved a resolution to partition the country between Arabs and Jews. The financial burden imposed on Britain by the Jewish insurgency, together with the tremendous public opposition to keeping troops in Palestine it generated among the British public was later cited by British officials as a major factor in Britain&#x27;s decision to evacuate Palestine.

===1948 Palestine war===


In December 1947, immediately following the UN partition vote, the 1947–1948 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine broke out between the Yishuv and Palestinian Arabs. The Irgun fought together with the Haganah and Lehi during that period. Notable operations in which they took part were the battle of Jaffa and the Jordanian siege on the Jewish Quarter in the Old City of Jerusalem. The Irgun&#x27;s most controversial operation during this period, carried out alongside Lehi, was an assault on the Arab village of Deir Yassin in which more than a hundred villagers and four of the attackers were killed. The event later became known as the Deir Yassin massacre, though Irgun and Lehi sources would deny a massacre took place there. Begin also repeatedly threatened to declare independence if the Jewish Agency did not do so.

Throughout the period of the rebellion against the British and the civil war against the Arabs, Begin lived openly under a series of assumed names, often while sporting a beard. Begin would not come out of hiding until April 1948, when the British, who still maintained nominal authority over Palestine, were almost totally gone. During the period of revolt, Begin was the most wanted man in Palestine, and MI5 placed a &#x27;dead-or-alive&#x27; bounty of £10,000 on his head. Begin had been forced into hiding immediately prior to the declaration of revolt, when Aliza noticed that their house was being watched. He initially lived in a room in the Savoy Hotel, a small hotel in Tel Aviv whose owner was sympathetic to the Irgun&#x27;s cause, and his wife and son were smuggled in to join him after two months. He decided to grow a beard and live openly under an assumed name rather than go completely into hiding. He was aided by the fact that the British authorities possessed only two photographs of his likeness, of which one, which they believed to be his military identity card, bore only a slight resemblance to him, according to Begin, and were fed misinformation by Yaakov Meridor that he had had plastic surgery, and were thus confused over his appearance. Due to the British police conducting searches in the hotel&#x27;s vicinity, he relocated to a Yemenite neighborhood in Petah Tikva, and after a month, moved to the Hasidof neighborhood near Kfar Sirkin, where he pretended to be a lawyer named Yisrael Halperin. After the British searched the area but missed the street where his house was located, Begin and his family moved to a new home on a Tel Aviv side street, where he assumed the name Yisrael Sassover and masqueraded as a rabbi. Following the King David Hotel bombing, when the British searched the entire city of Tel Aviv, Begin evaded capture by hiding in a secret compartment in his home. In 1947, he moved to the heart of Tel Aviv and took the identity of Dr. Yonah Koenigshoffer, the name he found on an abandoned passport in a library.

In the years following the establishment of the State of Israel, the Irgun&#x27;s contribution to precipitating British withdrawal became a hotly contested debate as different factions vied for control over the emerging narrative of Israeli independence. Begin resented his portrayal as a belligerent dissident.

====&quot;Altalena Affair&quot;====
After the Israeli Declaration of Independence on 14 May 1948 and the start of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Irgun continued to fight alongside Haganah and Lehi. On 15 May 1948, Begin broadcast a speech on radio declaring that the Irgun was finally moving out of its underground status. On 1 June Begin signed an agreement with the provisional government headed by David Ben-Gurion, where the Irgun agreed to formally disband and to integrate its force with the newly formed Israel Defense Forces (IDF), but was not truthful of the armaments aboard the &quot;Altalena&quot; as it was scheduled to arrive during the cease-fire ordered by the United Nations and therefore would have put the State of Israel in peril as Britain was adamant the partition of Jewish and Arab Palestine would not occur. This delivery was the smoking gun Britain would need to urge the UN to end the partition action.

Intense negotiations between representatives of the provisional government (headed by Ben-Gurion) and the Irgun (headed by Begin) followed the departure of &quot;Altalena&quot; from France. Among the issues discussed were logistics of the ship&#x27;s landing and distribution of the cargo between the military organizations. Whilst there was agreement on the anchoring place of the &quot;Altalena&quot;, there were differences of opinion about the allocation of the cargo. Ben-Gurion agreed to Begin&#x27;s initial request that 20% of the weapons be dispatched to the Irgun&#x27;s Jerusalem Battalion, which was still fighting independently. His second request, however, that the remainder be transferred to the IDF to equip the newly incorporated Irgun battalions, was rejected by the Government representatives, who interpreted the request as a demand to reinforce an &quot;army within an army.&quot;

The &quot;Altalena&quot; reached Kfar Vitkin in the late afternoon of Sunday, 20 June. Among the Irgun members waiting on the shore was Menachem Begin, who greeted the arrivals with great emotion. After the passengers had disembarked, members of the fishing village of Mikhmoret helped unload the cargo of military equipment. Concomitantly with the events at Kfar Vitkin, the government had convened in Tel Aviv for its weekly meeting. Ben-Gurion reported on the meetings which had preceded the arrival of the &quot;Altalena&quot;, and was adamant in his demand that Begin surrender and hand over all of the weapons:

We must decide whether to hand over power to Begin or to order him to cease his separate activities. If he does not do so, we will open fire! Otherwise, we must decide to disperse our own army.

The debate ended in a resolution to empower the army to use force if necessary to overcome the Irgun and to confiscate the ship and its cargo. Implementation of this decision was assigned to the Alexandroni Brigade, commanded by (Epstein), which the following day surrounded the Kfar Vitkin area. Dan Even issued the following ultimatum:

To: M. BeginBy special order from the Chief of the General Staff of the Israel Defense Forces, I am empowered to confiscate the weapons and military materials which have arrived on the Israeli coast in the area of my jurisdiction in the name of the Israel Government. I have been authorized to demand that you hand over the weapons to me for safekeeping and to inform you that you should establish contact with the supreme command. You are required to carry out this order immediately. If you do not agree to carry out this order, I shall use all the means at my disposal in order to implement the order and to requisition the weapons which have reached shore and transfer them from private possession into the possession of the Israel government. I wish to inform you that the entire area is surrounded by fully armed military units and armored cars, and all roads are blocked. I hold you fully responsible for any consequences in the event of your refusal to carry out this order. The immigrants – unarmed – will be permitted to travel to the camps in accordance with your arrangements. You have ten minutes to give me your answer.D.E., Brigade Commander

The ultimatum was made, according to Even, &quot;in order not to give the Irgun commander time for lengthy considerations and to gain the advantage of surprise.&quot; Begin refused to respond to the ultimatum, and all attempts at mediation failed. Begin&#x27;s failure to respond was a blow to Even&#x27;s prestige, and a clash was now inevitable. Fighting ensued and there were a number of casualties. In order to prevent further bloodshed, the Kfar Vitkin settlers initiated negotiations between Yaakov Meridor (Begin&#x27;s deputy) and Dan Even, which ended in a general ceasefire and the transfer of the weapons on shore to the local IDF commander.
Begin had meanwhile boarded the &quot;Altalena&quot;, which was headed for Tel Aviv where the Irgun had more supporters. Many Irgun members, who joined the IDF earlier that month, left their bases and concentrated on the Tel Aviv beach. A confrontation between them and the IDF units started. In response, Ben-Gurion ordered Yigael Yadin (acting Chief of Staff) to concentrate large forces on the Tel Aviv beach and to take the ship by force. Heavy guns were transferred to the area and at four in the afternoon, Ben-Gurion ordered the shelling of the &quot;Altalena&quot;. One of the shells hit the ship, which began to burn. Yigal Allon, commander of the troops on the shore, later claimed only five or six shells were fired, as warning shots, and the ship was hit by accident.

There was danger that the fire would spread to the holds which contained explosives, and Captain Monroe Fein ordered all aboard to abandon ship. People jumped into the water, whilst their comrades on shore set out to meet them on rafts. Although Captain Fein flew the white flag of surrender, automatic fire continued to be directed at the unarmed survivors swimming in the water. Begin, who was on deck, agreed to leave the ship only after the last of the wounded had been evacuated. Sixteen Irgun fighters were killed in the confrontation with the army (all but three were veteran members and not newcomers in the ship); six were killed in the Kfar Vitkin area and ten on Tel Aviv beach. Three IDF soldiers were killed: two at Kfar Vitkin and one in Tel Aviv.

After the shelling of the &quot;Altalena&quot;, more than 200 Irgun fighters were arrested. Most of them were released several weeks later, with the exception of five senior commanders (Moshe Hason, Eliyahu Lankin, Yaakov Meridor, Bezalel Amitzur, and Hillel Kook), who were detained for more than two months, until 27 August 1948. Begin agreed the Irgun soldiers would be fully integrated with the IDF and not kept in separate units.

About a year later, &quot;Altalena&quot; was refloated, towed 15 miles out to sea and sunk.

==Political career==

===Herut opposition years===

In August 1948, Begin and members of the Irgun High Command emerged from the underground and formed the right-wing political party Herut (&quot;Freedom&quot;) party. The move countered the weakening attraction for the earlier revisionist party, Hatzohar, founded by his late mentor Ze&#x27;ev Jabotinsky. Revisionist &#x27;purists&#x27; alleged nonetheless that Begin was out to steal Jabotinsky&#x27;s mantle and ran against him with the old party. The Herut party can be seen as the forerunner of today&#x27;s Likud.

In November 1948, Begin visited the US on a campaigning trip. During his visit, signed by Albert Einstein, Sidney Hook, Hannah Arendt, and other prominent Americans and several rabbis was published which described Begin&#x27;s Herut party as &quot;terrorist, right-wing chauvinist organization in Palestine,&quot; &quot;closely akin in its organization, methods, political philosophy and social appeal to the Nazi and Fascist parties&quot; and accused his group (along with the smaller, militant, Stern Gang) of preaching &quot;racial superiority&quot; and having &quot;inaugurated a reign of terror in the Palestine Jewish community&quot;.

In the first elections in 1949, Herut, with 11.5 percent of the vote, won 14 seats, while Hatzohar failed to break the threshold and disbanded shortly thereafter. This provided Begin with legitimacy as the leader of the Revisionist stream of Zionism. During the 1950s, Begin was banned from entering the United Kingdom, as the British government regarded him as &quot;leader of the notorious terrorist organisation Irgun.&quot; Begin&#x27;s disappointment at the result of the 1951 Israeli legislative election, in which Herut lost six of its 14 seats, led Begin to resign as Herut leader in August 1951, and naming Aryeh Ben-Eliezer as his successor. Despite sending the party his resignation letter and going abroad to Europe, the party&#x27;s national council voted instead to make Ben-Eliezer deputy chairman and grant Begin a six-month leave of absence, while re-electing him as party chairman. Begin did not return to public life until January 1952, prompted to do so by the growing debate around the Reparations Agreement between Israel and the Federal Republic of Germany as well as by Ben-Eliezer being hospitalized due to a serious heart attack in December 1951.

Between 1948 and 1977, under Begin, Herut and the alliances it formed (Gahal in 1965 and Likud in 1973) formed the main opposition to the dominant Mapai and later the Alignment (the forerunners of today&#x27;s Labor Party) in the Knesset; Herut adopted a radical nationalistic agenda committed to the irredentist idea of Greater Israel that usually included Jordan. During those years, Begin was systematically delegitimized by the ruling party, and was often personally derided by Ben-Gurion who refused to either speak to or refer to him by name. Ben-Gurion famously coined the phrase &#x27;without Herut and Maki&#x27; (Maki was the communist party), referring to his refusal to consider them for coalition, effectively pushing both parties and their voters beyond the margins of political consensus.

The personal animosity between Ben-Gurion and Begin, going back to the hostilities over the &quot;Altalena&quot; Affair, underpinned the political dichotomy between Mapai and Herut. Begin was a keen critic of Mapai, accusing it of coercive Bolshevism and deep-rooted institutional corruption. Drawing on his training as a lawyer in Poland, he preferred wearing a formal suit and tie and evincing the dry demeanor of a legislator to the socialist informality of Mapai, as a means of accentuating their differences.

One of the fiercest confrontations between Begin and Ben-Gurion revolved around the Reparations Agreement between Israel and West Germany, signed in 1952. Begin vehemently opposed the agreement, claiming that it was tantamount to a pardon of Nazi crimes against the Jewish people. While the agreement was debated in the Knesset in January 1952, he led a demonstration in Jerusalem attended by some 15,000 people, and gave a passionate and dramatic speech in which he attacked the government and called for its violent overthrow. Referring to the Altalena Affair, Begin stated that &quot;when you fired at me with a cannon, I gave the order: &#x27;No!&#x27; Today I will give the order, &#x27;Yes!&#x27;&quot; Incited by his speech, the crowd marched towards the Knesset (then at the Frumin Building on King George Street) and threw stones at the windows, and at police as they intervened. After five hours of rioting, police managed to suppress the riots using water cannons and tear gas. Hundreds were arrested, while some 200 rioters, 140 police officers, and several Knesset members were injured. Many held Begin personally responsible for the violence, and he was consequently barred from the Knesset for several months. His behavior was strongly condemned in mainstream public discourse, reinforcing his image as a provocateur. The vehemence of Revisionist opposition was deep; in March 1952, during the ongoing reparations negotiations, a parcel bomb addressed to Konrad Adenauer, the sitting West German Chancellor, was intercepted at a German post office. While being defused, the bomb exploded, killing one sapper and injuring two others. Five Israelis, all former members of Irgun, were later arrested in Paris for their involvement in the plot. Chancellor Adenauer decided to keep secret the involvement of Israeli opposition party members in the plot, thus avoiding Israeli embarrassment and a likely backlash. The five Irgun conspirators were later extradited from both France and Germany, without charge, and sent back to Israel. Forty years after the assassination attempt, Begin was implicated as the organizer of the assassination attempt in a memoir written by one of the conspirators, Elieser Sudit.

Begin&#x27;s impassioned rhetoric, laden with pathos and evocations of the Holocaust, appealed to many, but was deemed inflammatory and demagoguery by others.

===Gahal and unity government===
In the following years, Begin failed to gain electoral momentum, and Herut remained far behind Labor with a total of 17 seats until 1961. In the 1965 Israeli legislative election, Herut and the Liberal Party united to form the Gahal bloc under Begin&#x27;s leadership, but the merger prompted several Liberal MKs to split and form the Independent Liberals and Gahal failed to gain seats in the election, or make up the seats it lost from the Independent Liberal defection. In 1966, during Herut&#x27;s party convention, he was challenged by the young Ehud Olmert. The opposition group within Herut, however, sensed that Begin&#x27;s leadership position was too strong to challenge directly and concentrated on winning control over the party organization. They won overwhelming victories in all votes for the composition of party institutions. Begin responded to these challenges by announcing his retirement as party chairman and suggesting he would also resign seat in the Knesset. Begin&#x27;s move mobilized delegates in support of him, but the party convention ended without a party chairman being elected; the chair would be vacant for eight months. Internal opposition to Begin&#x27; leadership came to a head a month after the convention, when Haim Amsterdam, an assistant to one of the opposition leaders, Shmuel Tamir, published a devastating attack on Begin in &quot;Ha&#x27;aretz&quot;; this led to the suspension of Tamir&#x27;s party membership. The leaders of the opposition then established a new party in the Knesset, the Free Center, with the loss of three seats for Herut. After this revolt, Begin reversed his decision to retire and returned as party chairman in February 1967.

The day the Six-Day War started in June 1967, Gahal joined the national unity government under Prime Minister Levi Eshkol of the Alignment, resulting in Begin serving in the cabinet for the first time, as a Minister without Portfolio. Rafi also joined the unity government at that time, with Moshe Dayan becoming Defense Minister. Gahal&#x27;s arrangement lasted until August 1970, when Begin and Gahal quit the government, then led by Golda Meir due to disagreements over the Rogers Plan and its &quot;in place&quot; cease-fire with Egypt along the Suez Canal, Other sources, including William B. Quandt, note that the Labor party, by formally accepting UN 242 in mid-1970, had accepted &quot;peace for withdrawal&quot; on all fronts, and because of this Begin had left the unity government. On 5 August, Begin explained before the Knesset why he was resigning from the cabinet. He said, &quot;As far as we are concerned, what do the words &#x27;withdrawal from territories administered since 1967 by Israel&#x27; mean other than Judea and Samaria. Not all the territories; but by all opinion, most of them.&quot;

===Likud chairmanship===

In 1973, Begin agreed to a plan by Ariel Sharon to form a larger bloc of opposition parties, made up from Gahal, the Free Centre, and other smaller groups. They came through with a tenuous alliance called the Likud (&quot;Consolidation&quot;). In the elections held later that year, two months after the Yom Kippur War, the Likud won a considerable share of the votes, though with 39 seats still remained in opposition.

Yet the aftermath of the Yom Kippur War saw ensuing public disenchantment with the Alignment. Voices of criticism about the government&#x27;s misconduct of the war gave rise to growing public resentment. Personifying the antithesis to the Alignment&#x27;s socialist ethos, Begin appealed to many Mizrahi Israelis, mostly first and second generation Jewish refugees from Arab countries, who felt they were continuously being treated by the establishment as second-class citizens. His open embrace of Judaism stood in stark contrast to the Alignment&#x27;s secularism, which alienated Mizrahi voters and drew many of them to support Begin, becoming his burgeoning political base. In the years 1974–77 Yitzhak Rabin&#x27;s government suffered from instability due to infighting within the labor party (Rabin and Shimon Peres) and the shift to the right by the National Religious Party, as well as numerous corruption scandals. All these weakened the labor camp and finally allowed Begin to capture the center stage of Israeli politics.

In 1977 Begin declared that &quot;between the [Mediterranean] Sea and the Jordan River there shall only be Israeli sovereignty&quot;.

==Prime Minister of Israel==
===1977 electoral victory===

On 17 May 1977, the Likud, headed by Begin, won the Knesset elections by a landslide, becoming the biggest party in the Knesset. Popularly known as the &quot;Mahapakh&quot; (&quot;upheaval&quot;), the election results had seismic ramifications as for the first time in Israeli history a party other than the Alignment/Mapai was in a position to form a government, effectively ending the left&#x27;s hitherto unrivalled domination over Israeli politics. Likud&#x27;s electoral victory signified a fundamental restructuring of Israeli society in which the founding socialist Ashkenazi elite was being replaced by a coalition representing marginalized Mizrahi and Jewish-religious communities, promoting a socially conservative and economically liberal agenda.
The Likud campaign leading up to the election centered on Begin&#x27;s personality. Demonized by the Alignment as totalitarian and extremist, his self-portrayal as a humble and pious leader struck a chord with many who felt abandoned by the ruling party&#x27;s ideology. In the predominantly Mizrahi working class urban neighborhoods and peripheral towns, the Likud won overwhelming majorities, while disillusionment with the Alignment&#x27;s corruption prompted many middle and upper class voters to support the newly founded centrist Democratic Movement for Change (&quot;Dash&quot;) headed by Yigael Yadin. Dash won 15 seats out of 120, largely at the expense of the Alignment, which was led by Shimon Peres and had shrunk from 51 to 32 seats. Well aware of his momentous achievement and employing his trademark sense for drama, when speaking that night in the Likud headquarters Begin quoted from the Gettysburg Address and the Torah, referring to his victory as a &#x27;turning point in the history of the Jewish people&#x27;.

With 43 seats, the Likud still required the support of other parties in order to reach a parliamentary majority that would enable it to form a government under Israel&#x27;s proportionate representation parliamentary system. Though able to form a narrow coalition with smaller Jewish religious and ultra-orthodox parties, Begin also sought support from centrist elements in the Knesset to provide his government with greater public legitimacy. He controversially offered the foreign affairs portfolio to Moshe Dayan, a former IDF Chief of Staff and Defense Minister, and a prominent Alignment politician identified with the old establishment. Dash eventually joined his government several months later, thus providing it with the broad support of almost two thirds of the Knesset. While prime ministerial adviser, Yehuda Avner, served as Begin&#x27;s speech writer.

On 19 June 1977, Likud signed a coalition agreement with the National Religious Party (which held twelve seats) and the Agudat Yisrael party. Without defections, the coalition of Likud and these two parties created the narrowest-possible majority in a full Knesset (61 seats). After eight hours of debate, Begin&#x27;s government was officially approved in a Knesset vote on 21 June 1977, making him the new prime minister of Israel.

===Socioeconomic policies===

As Prime Minister, Begin presided over various reforms in the domestic field. Tuition fees for secondary education were eliminated and compulsory education was extended to the tenth grade, while new social programmes were introduced such as long-term care insurance and a national income support system. A ban on color television that had been imposed to enforce social equality was abolished, and the minimum age for a driver&#x27;s license was lowered to 17.

Begin&#x27;s economic policies sought to liberalize Israel&#x27;s socialist economy towards a more free-market approach, and he appointed Simha Erlich as Finance Minister. Erlich unveiled a new economic policy that became known as the &quot;economic transformation&quot;. Under the new plan, the exchange rate would from then on be determined by market forces rather than the government, subsidies for many consumer products were cancelled, foreign exchange controls were eased, the VAT tax was raised while the travel tax was cancelled, and customs duties were lowered to encourage imports of more products. The plan generated some improvement; cheap and high-quality imported products began to fill consumer shelves, the business sector benefited greatly, and the stock market recorded rising share prices. However, the program did not improve the lives of the Israeli people as Begin had hoped. The combination of the increased VAT, the end of subsidies, and a rise in the U.S. dollar exchange rate set off a wave of inflation and price increases. In particular, the fact that government spending was not significantly reduced in tandem with the liberalization program triggered a massive bout of inflation. On 17 July 1978, the Israeli cabinet met to discuss rising inflation, but Begin, declaring that &quot;you cannot manage economics over the housewife&#x27;s back&quot;, halted all proposals. In the end, the government decided not to take any actions and allow inflation to ride its course. Begin and his other ministers did not internalize the full meaning of the liberalization plan. As a result, he blocked attempts by Erlich to lower government spending and government plans to privatize public-sector enterprises out of fear of harming the weaker sectors of society, allowing the privatization of only eighteen government companies during his six-year tenure. In 1983, shortly before Begin&#x27;s resignation, a major financial crisis hit Israel after the stocks of the country&#x27;s four largest banks collapsed and were subsequently nationalized by the state. Inflation would continue rapidly rising past Begin&#x27;s tenure, and was only brought under control after the 1985 Israel Economic Stabilization Plan, which among other things greatly curbed government spending, was introduced. The years of rampant inflation devastated the economic power of the powerful Histadrut labor federation and the kibbutzim, which would help Israel&#x27;s approach towards a free-market economy.

Begin&#x27;s government has been credited with starting a trend that would move Israel towards a capitalist economy that would see the rise of a consumer culture and a pursuit of wealth and higher living standards, replacing a culture that scorned capitalism and valued social, as well as government restrictions to enforce equality.

In terms of social justice, however, the legacy of the Begin Government was arguably a questionable one. In 1980, the state Social Security Institute estimated that from 1977 to 1980 the number of babies born in poverty doubled, while there had been a 300% increase in the number of families with four to five children below the poverty line. Additionally, the number of families with more than five children below the poverty line went up by 400,% while child poverty estimates suggested that from 1977 to 1981 the number of children living below the poverty line had risen from 3.8% to 8.4%, while officials at the National Institute of Insurance estimated that the incidence of poverty had doubled during Begin&#x27;s five years in office.

===Camp David accords===
In 1978, Begin, aided by Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan and Defense Minister Ezer Weizman, came to Washington and Camp David to negotiate the Camp David Accords, leading to the 1979 Egypt–Israel peace treaty with Egyptian President, Anwar Sadat. Before going to Washington to meet President Carter, Begin visited Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson for his advice. Under the terms of the treaty, brokered by US President Jimmy Carter, Israel was to hand over the Sinai Peninsula in its entirety to Egypt. The peace treaty with Egypt was a watershed moment in Middle Eastern history, as it was the first time an Arab state recognized Israel&#x27;s legitimacy whereas Israel effectively accepted the land for peace principle as blueprint for resolving the Arab–Israeli conflict. Given Egypt&#x27;s prominent position within the Arab World, especially as Israel&#x27;s biggest and most powerful enemy, the treaty had far reaching strategic and geopolitical implications.

Almost overnight, Begin&#x27;s public image of an irresponsible nationalist radical was transformed into that of a statesman of historic proportions. This image was reinforced by international recognition which culminated with him being awarded, together with Sadat, the Nobel Peace Prize in 1978.

Yet while establishing Begin as a leader with broad public appeal, the peace treaty with Egypt was met with fierce criticism within his own Likud party. His devout followers found it difficult to reconcile Begin&#x27;s history as a keen promoter of the Greater Israel agenda with his willingness to relinquish occupied territory. Agreeing to the removal of Israeli settlements from the Sinai was perceived by many as a clear departure from Likud&#x27;s Revisionist ideology. Several prominent Likud members, most notably Yitzhak Shamir, objected to the treaty and abstained when it was ratified with an overwhelming majority in the Knesset, achieved only thanks to support from the opposition. A small group of hardliners within Likud, associated with Gush Emunim Jewish settlement movement, eventually decided to split and form the Tehiya party in 1979. They led the &quot;Movement for Stopping the Withdrawal from Sinai&quot;, violently clashing with IDF soldiers during the forceful eviction of Yamit settlement in April 1982. Despite the traumatic scenes from Yamit, political support for the treaty did not diminish and the Sinai was handed over to Egypt in 1982.
Begin was less resolute in implementing the section of the Camp David Accord calling for Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. He appointed Agriculture Minister Ariel Sharon to implement a large scale expansion of Jewish settlements in the Israeli-occupied territories, a policy intended to make future territorial concessions in these areas effectively impossible. Begin refocused Israeli settlement strategy from populating peripheral areas in accordance with the Allon Plan, to building Jewish settlements in areas of Biblical and historic significance. When the settlement of Elon Moreh was established on the outskirts of Nablus in 1979, following years of campaigning by Gush Emunim, Begin declared that there are &quot;many more Elon Morehs to come.&quot; During his term dozens of new settlements were built, and Jewish population in the West Bank and Gaza more than quadrupled.

===Bombing Iraqi nuclear reactor===
Begin took Saddam Hussein&#x27;s anti-Zionist threats seriously and therefore took aim at Iraq, which was building a nuclear reactor named Osirak or Tammuz 1 with French and Italian assistance. When Begin took office, preparations were intensified. Begin authorized the construction of a full-scale model of the Iraqi reactor which Israeli pilots could practice bombing. Israel attempted to negotiate with France and Italy to cut off assistance and with the United States to obtain assurances that the program would be halted. The negotiations failed. Begin considered the diplomatic option fruitless, and worried that prolonging the attack would lead to a fatal inability to act in response to the perceived threat.

The decision to attack was hotly contested within Begin&#x27;s government. However, in October 1980, the Mossad informed Begin that the reactor would be fueled and operational by June 1981. This assessment was aided by reconnaissance photos supplied by the United States, and the Israeli cabinet voted to approve an attack. In June 1981, Begin ordered the destruction of the reactor. On 7 June 1981, the Israeli Air Force destroyed the reactor in a successful long-range operation called &quot;Operation Opera&quot;. Soon after, the government and Begin expounded on what came to be known as the Begin Doctrine: &quot;On no account shall we permit an enemy to develop weapons of mass destruction (WMD) against the people of Israel.&quot; Begin explicitly stated the strike was not an anomaly, but instead called the event &quot;a precedent for every future government in Israel&quot;; it remains a feature of Israeli security planning policy. Many foreign governments, including the United States, condemned the operation, and the United Nations Security Council unanimously passed Resolution 487 condemning it. The Israeli left-wing opposition criticized it also at the time, but mainly for its timing relative to domestic elections only three weeks later, when Likud was reelected. The new government annexed the Golan Heights and banned the national airline from flying on Shabbat.

===Lebanon invasion===
On 6 June 1982, Begin&#x27;s government authorized the Israel Defense Forces invasion of Lebanon, in response to the attempted assassination of the Israeli ambassador to the United Kingdom, Shlomo Argov. The objective of Operation &quot;Peace for Galilee&quot; was to force the PLO out of rocket range of Israel&#x27;s northern border. Begin was hoping for a short and limited Israeli involvement that would destroy the PLO&#x27;s political and military infrastructure in southern Lebanon, effectively reshaping the balance of Lebanese power in favor of the Christian Militias who were allied with Israel. Nevertheless, fighting soon escalated into war with Palestinian and Lebanese militias, as well as the Syrian military, and the IDF progressed as far as Beirut, well beyond the 40 km limit initially authorized by the government. Israeli forces were successful in driving the PLO out of Lebanon and forcing its leadership to relocate to Tunisia, but the war ultimately failed to achieve its political goals of bringing security to Israel&#x27;s northern border and creating stability in Lebanon. Begin referred to the invasion as an inevitable act of survival, often comparing Yasser Arafat to Hitler.

====Sabra and Shatila massacre====
Public dissatisfaction reached a peak in September 1982, after the Sabra and Shatila Massacre. Hundreds of thousands gathered in Tel Aviv in what was one of the biggest public demonstrations in Israeli history. The Kahan Commission, appointed to investigate the events, issued its report on 9 February 1983, found the government indirectly responsible for the massacre but that Defense Minister Ariel Sharon &quot;bears personal responsibility.&quot; The commission recommended that Sharon be removed from office and never serve in any future Israeli government. Initially, Sharon attempted to remain in office and Begin refused to fire him. But Sharon resigned as Defense Minister after the death of Emil Grunzweig, who was killed by a grenade tossed into a crowd of demonstrators leaving a Peace Now organized march, which also injured ten others, including the son of an Israeli cabinet minister. Sharon remained in the cabinet as a minister without portfolio. Public pressure on Begin to resign increased.

Begin&#x27;s disoriented appearance on national television while visiting the Beaufort battle site raised concerns that he was being misinformed about the war&#x27;s progress. Asking Sharon whether PLO fighters had ‘machine guns’, Begin seemed out of touch with the nature and scale of the military campaign he had authorized. Almost a decade later, &quot;Haaretz&quot; reporter Uzi Benziman published a series of articles accusing Sharon of intentionally deceiving Begin about the operation&#x27;s initial objectives, and continuously misleading him as the war progressed. Sharon sued both the newspaper and Benziman for libel in 1991. The trial lasted 11 years, with one of the highlights being the deposition of Begin&#x27;s son, Benny, in favor of the defendants. Sharon lost the case.

===Resignation===

After Begin&#x27;s wife Aliza died in November 1982 while he was away on an official visit to Washington DC, he fell into a deep depression. Begin also became disappointed by the war in Lebanon because he had hoped to sign a peace treaty with the government of President Bashir Gemayel, who was assassinated. Instead, there were mounting Israeli casualties, and protesters outside his office maintained a constant vigil with a sign showing the number of Israeli soldiers killed in Lebanon, which was constantly updated. Begin also continued to be plagued by the ill health and occasional hospitalizations that he had endured for years. In October 1983, he resigned, telling his colleagues that &quot;I cannot go on any longer&quot;, and handed over the reins of the office of Prime Minister to his old comrade-in-arms Yitzhak Shamir, who had been the leader of the Lehi resistance to the British.

==Tertiated==
Begin, in his first meeting with President Carter, used the word tertiated to describe how, during the &quot;Holocaust&quot; one in three Jews, of the worldwide Jewish population, were murdered. When Carter asked &quot;What was that word, Mr. Prime Minister?&quot; Begin compared it to the Roman army term &quot;Decimation&quot; and then added &quot;one in three – tertiated!&quot;

Begin elaborated later on: &quot;When I use the word &quot;Tertiated&quot; I mean to say that we do not accept the known term of &quot;Decimation&quot;. Avi Weiss highlighted: &quot;But the Holocaust is different&quot; and noted &quot;As Menachem Begin once said, during the Holocaust our people were not decimated, but &quot;tertiated&quot; — it was not one in ten, but one in three that were murdered.&quot;

==Retirement and seclusion==

Begin subsequently retired to an apartment overlooking the Jerusalem Forest and spent the rest of his life in seclusion. According to Israeli psychologist Ofer Grosbard, he suffered from clinical depression. He would rarely leave his apartment, and then usually to visit his wife&#x27;s grave-site to say the traditional Kaddish prayer for the departed. His seclusion was watched over by his children and his lifetime personal secretary Yechiel Kadishai, who monitored all official requests for meetings. Begin would meet almost no one other than close friends or family. After a year, he changed his telephone number due to journalists constantly calling him. He was cared for by his daughter Leah and a housekeeper. According to Kadishai, Begin spent most of his days reading and watching movies, and would start and finish a book almost every day. He also kept up with world events by continuing his lifelong habit of listening to the BBC every morning, which had begun during his underground days, and maintaining a subscription to several newspapers. Begin retained some political influence in the Likud party, which he used to influence it behind the scenes.

In 1990, Begin broke his hip in a fall and underwent surgery at Shaare Zedek Medical Center. Afterwards, doctors recommended moving him to Ichilov Hospital at the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center for rehabilitation. He was released from hospital in March 1991 and subsequently moved to an apartment in the Afeka neighborhood in Tel Aviv. The hospital stay and permanent move to Tel Aviv greatly improved his health and mood and his seclusion somewhat loosened. On Passover eve in 1991, he gave a telephone interview as part of a television broadcast marking fifty years since the death of Ze&#x27;ev Jabotinsky. He gave another telephone interview, which would be the last interview of his life, in July 1991.

==Death==

On 3 March 1992, Begin suffered a severe heart attack in his apartment, and was rushed to Ichilov Hospital, where he was put in the intensive care unit. Begin arrived there unconscious and paralyzed on the left side of his body. His condition slightly improved following treatment, and he regained consciousness after 20 hours. For the next six days, Begin remained in serious condition. A pacemaker was implanted in his chest to stabilize his heartbeat on 5 March. Begin was too frail to overcome the effects of the heart attack, and his condition began to rapidly deteriorate on 9 March at about 3:15 AM. An emergency team of doctors and nurses attempted to resuscitate his failing heart. His children were notified of his condition and immediately rushed to his side. Begin died at 3:30 AM. His death was announced an hour and a half later. Shortly before 6:00 AM, the hospital rabbi arrived at his bedside to say the Kaddish prayer.

Begin&#x27;s funeral took place in Jerusalem that afternoon. His coffin was carried four kilometers from the Sanhedria Funeral Parlor to Mount of Olives in a funeral procession attended by thousands of people. In accordance with his wishes, Begin was given a simple Jewish burial ceremony rather than a state funeral and buried on the Mount of Olives in the Jewish Cemetery there. He had asked to be buried there instead of Mount Herzl, where most Israeli leaders are laid to rest, because he wanted to be buried beside his wife Aliza, as well as Meir Feinstein of Irgun and Moshe Barazani of Lehi, who committed suicide together in jail while awaiting execution by the British. An estimated 75,000 mourners were present at the funeral. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, President Chaim Herzog, all cabinet ministers present in Israel, Supreme Court justices, Knesset members from most parties and a number of foreign ambassadors attended the funeral. Former members of the Irgun High Command served as pallbearers.

==Overview of offices held==
Begin served as prime minister (Israel&#x27;s head of government) from 21 June 1977 through 10 October 1983, leading the 18th government during the 9th Knesset and the 19th government during the first portion of the 10th Knesset.

Begin was a member of the Knesset from 1949 through until he resigned in 1983. Begin was twice the Knesset&#x27;s opposition leader (at the time an unofficial and honorary role). He was first opposition leader from November 1955 through June 1967, holding the role during the entirety of the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and the first portion of the 6th Knessets, during the second premiership of David Ben-Gurion and the premiership of Levi Eshkol] He again served as opposition leader from August 1970 through June 1977, during the last portion of the 7th Knesset and entirety of the 8th Knesset, during which period Golda Meir and Yitzhak Rabin served as prime minister.

Begin was the founding leader of Herut, and served as the party&#x27;s leader until 1983. He was also made leader of the Likud coalition at its founding in 1973, and also held that position until 1983.

<text>Mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) are business transactions in which the ownership of a company, business organization, or one of their operating units is transferred to or consolidated with another company or business organization. They may happen through direct absorption, a merger, a tender offer or a hostile takeover. As an aspect of strategic management, M&amp;A can allow enterprises to grow or downsize, and change the nature of their business or competitive position.

Technically, a is the legal consolidation of two business entities into one, whereas an occurs when one entity takes ownership of another entity&#x27;s share capital, equity interests or assets. From a legal and financial point of view, both mergers and acquisitions generally result in the consolidation of assets and liabilities under one entity, and the distinction between the two is not always clear.

Most countries require mergers and acquisitions to comply with antitrust or competition law. In the United States, for example, the Clayton Act outlaws any merger or acquisition that may &quot;substantially lessen competition&quot; or &quot;tend to create a monopoly&quot;, and the Hart–Scott–Rodino Act requires notifying the U.S. Department of Justice&#x27;s Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission about any merger or acquisition over a certain size.

==Acquisition==
An acquisition/takeover is the purchase of one business or company by another company or other business entity. Specific acquisition targets can be identified through myriad avenues, including market research, trade expos, sent up from internal business units, or supply chain analysis. Such purchase may be of 100%, or nearly 100%, of the assets or ownership equity of the acquired entity.

A consolidation/amalgamation occurs when two companies combine to form a new enterprise altogether, and neither of the previous companies remains independently owned. Acquisitions are divided into &quot;private&quot; and &quot;public&quot; acquisitions, depending on whether the acquiree or merging company (also termed a &quot;target&quot;) is or is not publicly listed. Some public companies rely on acquisitions as an important value creation strategy. An additional dimension or categorization consists of whether an acquisition is &quot;friendly&quot; or &quot;hostile&quot;.

Achieving acquisition success has proven to be very difficult, while various studies have shown that 50% of acquisitions were unsuccessful. &quot;Serial acquirers&quot; appear to be more successful with M&amp;A than companies who make acquisitions only occasionally (see Douma &amp; Schreuder, 2013, chapter 13). The new forms of buy out created since the crisis are based on serial type acquisitions known as an ECO Buyout which is a co-community ownership buy out and the new generation buy outs of the MIBO (Management Involved or Management &amp; Institution Buy Out) and MEIBO (Management &amp; Employee Involved Buy Out).

Whether a purchase is perceived as being &quot;friendly&quot; or &quot;hostile&quot; depends significantly on how the proposed acquisition is communicated to and perceived by the target company&#x27;s board of directors, employees, and shareholders. It is normal for M&amp;A deal communications to take place in a so-called &quot;confidentiality bubble&quot;, wherein the flow of information is restricted pursuant to confidentiality agreements. In the case of a friendly transaction, the companies cooperate in negotiations; in the case of a hostile deal, the board and/or management of the target is unwilling to be bought or the target&#x27;s board has no prior knowledge of the offer. Hostile acquisitions can, and often do, ultimately become &quot;friendly&quot; as the acquirer secures endorsement of the transaction from the board of the acquiree company. This usually requires an improvement in the terms of the offer and/or through negotiation.

&quot;Acquisition&quot; usually refers to a purchase of a smaller firm by a larger one. Sometimes, however, a smaller firm will acquire management control of a larger and/or longer-established company and retain the name of the latter for the post-acquisition combined entity. This is known as a reverse takeover. Another type of acquisition is the reverse merger, a form of transaction that enables a private company to be publicly listed in a relatively short time frame. A reverse merger is a type of merger where a privately held company, typically one with promising prospects and a need for financing, acquires a publicly listed shell company that has few assets and no significant business operations.

The combined evidence suggests that the shareholders of acquired firms realize significant positive &quot;abnormal returns,&quot; while shareholders of the acquiring company are most likely to experience a negative wealth effect. Most studies indicate that M&amp;A transactions have a positive net effect, with investors in both the buyer and target companies seeing positive returns. This suggests that M&amp;A creates economic value, likely by transferring assets to more efficient management teams who can better utilize them. (See Douma &amp; Schreuder, 2013, chapter 13).

There are also a variety of structures used in securing control over the assets of a company, which have different tax and regulatory implications:

*The buyer buys the shares, and therefore control, of the target company being purchased. Ownership control of the company in turn conveys effective control over the assets of the company, but since the company is acquired intact as a going concern, this form of transaction carries with it all of the liabilities accrued by that business over its past and all of the risks that company faces in its commercial environment and corporate environment
*The buyer buys the assets of the target company. The cash the target receives from the sell-off is paid back to its shareholders by dividend or through liquidation. This type of transaction leaves the target company as an empty shell, if the buyer buys out the entire assets. A buyer often structures the transaction as an asset purchase to &quot;cherry-pick&quot; the assets that it wants and leave out the assets and liabilities that it does not. This can be particularly important where foreseeable liabilities may include future, unquantified damage awards such as those that could arise from litigation over defective products, employee benefits or terminations, or environmental damage. A disadvantage of this structure is the tax that many jurisdictions, particularly outside the United States, impose on transfers of the individual assets, whereas stock transactions can frequently be structured as like-kind exchanges or other arrangements that are tax-free or tax-neutral, both to the buyer and to the seller&#x27;s shareholders.

The terms &quot;demerger&quot;, &quot;spin-off&quot; and &quot;spin-out&quot; are sometimes used to indicate a situation where one company splits into two, generating a second company which may or may not become separately listed on a stock exchange.

As per knowledge-based views, firms can generate greater values through the retention of knowledge-based resources which they generate and integrate. Extracting technological benefits during and after acquisition is an ever-challenging issue because of organizational differences. Based on the content analysis of seven interviews, the authors concluded the following components for their grounded model of acquisition:

#Improper documentation and changing implicit knowledge makes it difficult to share information during acquisition.
#For acquired firm symbolic and cultural independence which is the base of technology and capabilities are more important than administrative independence.
#Detailed knowledge exchange and integrations are difficult when the acquired firm is large and high performing.
#Management of executives from acquired firm is critical in terms of promotions and pay incentives to utilize their talent and value their expertise.
#Transfer of technologies and capabilities are most difficult task to manage because of complications of acquisition implementation. The risk of losing implicit knowledge is always associated with the fast pace acquisition.

An increase in acquisitions in the global business environment requires enterprises to evaluate the key stake holders of acquisitions very carefully before implementation. It is imperative for the acquirer to understand this relationship and apply it to its advantage. Employee retention is possible only when resources are exchanged and managed without affecting their independence.

==Legal structures==
A corporate acquisition can be structured legally as either an &quot;asset purchase&quot; in which the seller sells business assets and liabilities to the buyer, an &quot;equity purchase&quot; in which the buyer purchases equity interests in a target company from one or more selling shareholders or a &quot;merger&quot; in which one legal entity is combined into another entity by operation of the corporate law statute(s) of the jurisdiction of the merging entities. In a transaction structured as a merger or an equity purchase, the buyer acquires all of the assets and liabilities of the acquired entity. In a transaction structured as an asset purchase, the buyer and seller agree on which assets and liabilities the buyer will acquire from the seller.

Asset purchases are common in technology transactions in which the buyer is most interested in particular intellectual property but does not want to acquire liabilities or other contractual relationships. An asset purchase structure may also be used when the buyer wishes to buy a particular division or unit of a company that is not a separate legal entity. Divestitures present a variety of unique challenges, such as identifying the assets and liabilities that pertain solely to the unit being sold, determining whether the unit relies on services from other parts of the seller&#x27;s organization, transferring employees, moving permits and licenses, and safeguarding against potential competition from the seller in the same business sector after the transaction is completed.

=== Types of mergers ===

From an economic point of view, business combinations can also be classified as horizontal, vertical and conglomerate mergers (or acquisitions). A horizontal merger is between two competitors in the same industry. A
vertical merger occurs when two firms combine across the value chain, such as when a firm buys a former supplier (backward integration) or a former customer (forward integration). When there is no strategic relatedness between an acquiring firm and its target, this is called a conglomerate merger (Douma &amp; Schreuder, 2013).

The form of merger most often employed is a triangular merger, where the target company merges with a shell company wholly owned by the buyer, thus becoming a subsidiary of the buyer. In a &quot;forward triangular merger&quot;, the target company merges into the subsidiary, with the subsidiary as the surviving company of the merger; a &quot;reverse triangular merger&quot; is similar except that the subsidiary merges into the target company, with the target company surviving the merger.

Mergers, asset purchases and equity purchases are each taxed differently, and the most beneficial structure for tax purposes is highly situation-dependent. Under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, a forward triangular merger is taxed as if the target company sold its assets to the shell company and then liquidated, them whereas a reverse triangular merger is taxed as if the target company&#x27;s shareholders sold their stock in the target company to the buyer.

==Documentation==
The documentation of an M&amp;A transaction often begins with a letter of intent. The letter of intent generally does not bind the parties to commit to a transaction, but may bind the parties to confidentiality and exclusivity obligations so that the transaction can be considered through a due diligence process involving lawyers, accountants, tax advisors, and other professionals, as well as business people from both sides.

After due diligence is complete, the parties may proceed to draw up a definitive agreement, known as a &quot;merger agreement&quot;, &quot;share purchase agreement,&quot; or &quot;asset purchase agreement&quot; depending on the structure of the transaction. Such contracts are typically 80 to 100 pages long and focus on five key types of terms:
*Conditions, which must be satisfied before there is an obligation to complete the transaction. Conditions typically include matters such as regulatory approvals and the lack of any material adverse change in the target&#x27;s business.
*Representations and warranties by the seller with regard to the company, which are claimed to be true at both the time of signing and the time of closing. Sellers often attempt to craft their representations and warranties with knowledge qualifiers, dictating the level of knowledge applicable and which seller parties&#x27; knowledge is relevant. Some agreements provide that if the representations and warranties by the seller prove to be false, the buyer may claim a refund of part of the purchase price, as is common in transactions involving privately held companies (although in most acquisition agreements involving public company targets, the representations and warranties of the seller do not survive the closing). Representations regarding a target company&#x27;s net working capital are a common source of post-closing disputes.
*Covenants, which govern the conduct of the parties, both before the closing (such as covenants that restrict the operations of the business between signing and closing) and after the closing (such as covenants regarding future income tax filings and tax liability or post-closing restrictions agreed to by the buyer and seller parties).
*Termination rights, which may be triggered by a breach of contract, a failure to satisfy certain conditions or the passage of a certain period of time without consummating the transaction, and fees and damages payable in case of a termination for certain events (also known as breakup fees). 
*Provisions relating to obtaining required shareholder approvals under state law and related SEC filings required under federal law, if applicable, and terms related to the mechanics of the legal transactions to be consummated at closing (such as the determination and allocation of the purchase price) and post-closing adjustments (such as adjustments after the final determination of working capital at closing or earnout payments payable to the sellers), repayment of outstanding debt, and the treatment of outstanding shares, options and other equity interests).
*An indemnification provision, which provides that an indemnitor will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the indemnitee(s) for losses incurred by the indemnitees as a result of the indemnitor&#x27;s breach of its contractual obligations in the purchase agreement
Following the closing of a deal, adjustments may be made to some of the provisions outlined in the purchase agreement, such as the purchase price. These adjustments are subject to enforceability issues in certain situations. Alternatively, certain transactions use the &#x27;locked box&#x27; approach, where the purchase price is fixed at signing and based on the seller&#x27;s equity value at a pre-signing date and an interest charge.

==Business valuation==

The assets of a business are pledged to two categories of stakeholders: equity owners and owners of the business&#x27; outstanding debt. The core value of a business, which accrues to both categories of stakeholders, is called the Enterprise Value (EV), whereas the value which accrues just to shareholders is the Equity Value (also called market capitalization for publicly listed companies). Enterprise Value reflects a capital structure neutral valuation and is frequently a preferred way to compare value as it is not affected by a company&#x27;s, or management&#x27;s, strategic decision to fund the business either through debt, equity, or a portion of both. Five common ways to &quot;triangulate&quot; the enterprise value of a business are:
#asset valuation: the price paid is the value of the &quot;easily salable parts&quot;; the main approaches to valuing these are book value and liquidation value
#historical earnings valuation: the price is such that the payment for the business (or return targeted by the investor), would have been supported by the business&#x27;s &quot;own&quot; earnings or cash-flow averaged over the previous 3–5 years; see also Earnout
#future maintainable earnings valuation: similarly, but forward looking; see generally, Cash flow forecasting and Financial forecast, and re &quot;maintainability&quot;, and Owner earnings. 
#relative valuation: the price paid per dollar of earnings or revenue is based on the same multiple for comparable companies and / or recent comparable transactions
#discounted cash flow valuation (DCF): the price equates to the value of &quot;all&quot; future cash-flows - with synergies and tax given special attention - as discounted to today; see § Determine cash flow for each forecast period under Valuation using discounted cash flows, which compares M&amp;A DCF models to other cases.

Professionals who value businesses generally do not use just one method, but a combination. Valuations implied using these methodologies can prove different to a company&#x27;s current trading valuation. For public companies, the market based enterprise value and equity value can be calculated by referring to the company&#x27;s share price and components on its balance sheet. The valuation methods described above represent ways to determine value of a company independently from how the market currently, or historically, has determined value based on the price of its outstanding securities.

Most often value is expressed in a Letter of Opinion of Value (LOV) when the business is being valued informally. Formal valuation reports generally get more detailed and expensive as the size of a company increases, but this is not always the case as the nature of the business and the industry it is operating in can influence the complexity of the valuation task.

Objectively evaluating the historical and prospective performance of a business is a challenge faced by many. Generally, parties rely on independent third parties to conduct due diligence studies or business assessments. To yield the most value from a business assessment, objectives should be clearly defined and the right resources should be chosen to conduct the assessment in the available timeframe.

As synergy plays a large role in the valuation of acquisitions, it is paramount to get the value of synergies right, as briefly alluded to regarding DCF valuations. Synergies are different from the &quot;sales price&quot; valuation of the firm, as they will accrue to the buyer. Hence, the analysis should be done from the acquiring firm&#x27;s point of view. Synergy-creating investments are initiated by the choice of the acquirer, and therefore they are not obligatory, making them essentially real options. To include this real options aspect into the analysis of acquisition targets is an issue that has been studied lately. See also contingent value rights.

Valuation can be influenced by a range of factors beyond financial performance, including cross-border and cross-industry considerations, sustainability initiatives, and regulatory environments. Cross-border transactions may involve exchange rate risks, differing accounting standards, and geopolitical factors, which can lead to valuation adjustments. Cross-industry acquisitions can introduce complexities in synergies and market positioning, as firms may face integration challenges and differences in business models. Additionally, sustainability-related factors, such as a company&#x27;s environmental, social, and governance performance, can impact valuation by influencing investor sentiment, access to capital, and long-term risk exposure.

==Financing ==
Mergers are generally differentiated from acquisitions partly by the way in which they are financed and partly by the relative size of the companies. Various methods of financing an M&amp;A deal exist:

===Cash===
Payment by cash. Such transactions are usually termed acquisitions rather than mergers because the shareholders of the target company are removed from the picture and the target comes under the (indirect) control of the bidder&#x27;s shareholders.

===Stock===
Payment in the form of the acquiring company&#x27;s stock, issued to the shareholders of the acquired company at a given ratio proportional to the valuation of the latter. They receive stock in the company that is purchasing the smaller subsidiary.

===Financing options===
There are some elements to think about when choosing the form of payment. When submitting an offer, the acquiring firm should consider other potential bidders and think strategically. The form of payment might be decisive for the seller. With pure cash deals, there is no doubt on the real value of the bid (without considering an eventual earnout). The contingency of the share payment is indeed removed. Thus, a cash offer preempts competitors better than securities. Taxes are a second element to consider and should be evaluated with the counsel of competent tax and accounting advisers. Third, with a share deal the buyer&#x27;s capital structure might be affected and the control of the buyer modified. If the issuance of shares is necessary, shareholders of the acquiring company might prevent such capital increase at the general meeting of shareholders. The risk is removed with a cash transaction. Then, the balance sheet of the buyer will be modified and the decision maker should take into account the effects on the reported financial results. For example, in a pure cash deal (financed from the company&#x27;s current account), liquidity ratios might decrease. On the other hand, in a pure stock for stock transaction (financed from the issuance of new shares), the company might show lower profitability ratios (e.g. ROA). However, economic dilution must prevail towards accounting dilution when making the choice. The form of payment and financing options are tightly linked. If the buyer pays cash, there are three main financing options:
*Cash on hand: it consumes financial slack (excess cash or unused debt capacity) and may decrease debt rating. There are no major transaction costs.
*Issue of debt: It consumes financial slack, may decrease debt rating and increase cost of debt.

==Specialist advisory firms==
M&amp;A advice is provided by full-service investment banks- who often advise and handle the biggest deals in the world (called bulge bracket) - and specialist M&amp;A firms, who provide M&amp;A only advisory, generally to mid-market, select industries and SBEs.

Highly focused and specialized M&amp;A advice investment banks are called boutique investment banks.

==Motivation==

===Improving financial performance or reducing risk===
The dominant rationale used to explain M&amp;A activity is that acquiring firms seek improved financial performance or reduce risk. The following motives are considered to improve financial performance or reduce risk:
*Economy of scale: This refers to the fact that the combined company can often reduce its fixed costs by removing duplicate departments or operations, lowering the costs of the company relative to the same revenue stream, thus increasing profit margins.
*Economy of scope: This refers to the efficiencies primarily associated with demand-side changes, such as increasing or decreasing the scope of marketing and distribution, of different types of products.
*Increased revenue or market share: This assumes that the buyer will be absorbing a major competitor and thus increase its market power (by capturing increased market share) to set prices.
*Cross-selling: For example, a bank buying a stock broker could then sell its banking products to the stock broker&#x27;s customers, while the broker can sign up the bank&#x27;s customers for brokerage accounts. Or, a manufacturer can acquire and sell complementary products.
*Synergy: For example, managerial economies such as the increased opportunity of managerial specialization. Another example is purchasing economies due to increased order size and associated bulk-buying discounts.
*Taxation: A profitable company can buy a loss maker to use the target&#x27;s loss as their advantage by reducing their tax liability. In the United States and many other countries, rules are in place to limit the ability of profitable companies to &quot;shop&quot; for loss making companies, limiting the tax motive of an acquiring company.
*Geographical or other diversification: This is designed to smooth the earnings results of a company, which over the long term smoothens the stock price of a company, giving conservative investors more confidence in investing in the company. However, this does not always deliver value to shareholders (see below).
*Resource transfer: resources are unevenly distributed across firms (Barney, 1991) and the interaction of target and acquiring firm resources can create value through either overcoming information asymmetry or by combining scarce resources.
*Vertical integration: Vertical integration occurs when an upstream and downstream firm merge (or one acquires the other). There are several reasons for this to occur. One reason is to internalise an externality problem. A common example of such an externality is double marginalization. Double marginalization occurs when both the upstream and downstream firms have monopoly power and each firm reduces output from the competitive level to the monopoly level, creating two deadweight losses. After a merger, the vertically integrated firm can collect one deadweight loss by setting the downstream firm&#x27;s output to the competitive level. This increases profits and consumer surplus. A merger that creates a vertically integrated firm can be profitable.
*Hiring (acqui-hire): some companies use acquisitions as an alternative to the normal hiring process. This is especially common when the target is a small private company or is in the startup phase. In this case, the acquiring company simply hires (&quot;acquhires&quot;) the staff of the target private company, thereby acquiring its talent (if that is its main asset and appeal). The target private company simply dissolves and few legal issues are involved.
*Absorption of similar businesses under single management: similar portfolio invested by two different mutual funds namely united money market fund and united growth and income fund, caused the management to absorb united money market fund into united growth and income fund.
*Access to hidden or nonperforming assets (land, real estate).
*Acquire innovative intellectual property. Nowadays, intellectual property has become one of the core competences for companies. Studies have shown that successful knowledge transfer and integration after a merger or acquisition has a positive impact to the firm&#x27;s innovative capability and performance.
*Killer Acquisitions: Incumbent firms may acquire innovative targets solely to discontinue the target&#x27;s innovation projects and preempt future competition.
*Exit Strategy: Some start-ups in technological and pharmaceutical industries explicitly cite a potential future acquisition as an &quot;exit strategy&quot; when seeking early VC funding. The potential for an acquisition therefore leads to higher levels of funding for risky or innovative projects.

Megadeals—deals of at least one $1 billion in size—tend to fall into four discrete categories: consolidation, capabilities extension, technology-driven market transformation, and going private.

===Other types===
On average and across the most commonly studied variables, acquiring firms&#x27; financial performance does not positively change as a function of their acquisition activity. Therefore, additional motives for merger and acquisition that may not add shareholder value include:
* Diversification: While this may hedge a company against a downturn in an individual industry it fails to deliver value, since it is possible for individual shareholders to achieve the same hedge by diversifying their portfolios at a much lower cost than those associated with a merger. (In his book &quot;One Up on Wall Street&quot;, Peter Lynch termed this &quot;diworseification&quot;.)
*Manager&#x27;s hubris: manager&#x27;s overconfidence about expected synergies from M&amp;A which results in overpayment for the target company. The effect of manager&#x27;s overconfidence on M&amp;A has been shown to hold both for CEOs and board directors.
*Empire-building: Managers have larger companies to manage and hence more power. 
*Manager&#x27;s compensation: In the past, certain executive management teams had their payout based on the total amount of profit of the company, instead of the profit per share, which would give the team a perverse incentive to buy companies to increase the total profit while decreasing the profit per share (which hurts the owners of the company, the shareholders).

==Different types==

===By functional roles in market===
The M&amp;A process itself is a multifaceted which depends upon the type of merging companies.
*A horizontal merger is usually between two companies in the same business sector. An example of horizontal merger would be if a video game publisher purchases another video game publisher, for instance, Square Enix acquiring Eidos Interactive. This means that synergy can be obtained through many forms such as; increased market share, cost savings and exploring new market opportunities.
*A vertical merger represents the buying of supplier of a business. In a similar example, if a video game publisher purchases a video game development company in order to retain the development studio&#x27;s intellectual properties, for instance, Kadokawa Corporation acquiring FromSoftware. The vertical buying is aimed at reducing overhead cost of operations and economy of scale.
*Conglomerate M&amp;A is the third form of M&amp;A process which deals the merger between two irrelevant companies. The relevant example of conglomerate M&amp;A would be if a video game publisher purchases an animation studio, for instance, when Sega Sammy Holdings subsidized TMS Entertainment. The objective is often diversification of goods and services and capital investment.

===By business outcome===
The M&amp;A process results in the restructuring of a business&#x27;s purpose, corporate governance and brand identity.
*A statutory merger is a merger in which the acquiring company survives and the target company dissolves. The purpose of this merger is to transfer the assets and capital of the target company into the acquiring company without having to maintain the target company as a subsidiary.
*A consolidated merger is a merger in which an entirely new legal company is formed through combining the acquiring and target company. The purpose of this merger is to create a new legal entity with the capital and assets of the merged acquirer and target company. Both the acquiring and target company are dissolved in the process.

===Arm&#x27;s length mergers===
An arm&#x27;s length merger is a merger: 
# approved by disinterested directors and 
# approved by disinterested stockholders:
″The two elements are complementary and not substitutes. The first element is important because the directors have the capability to act as effective and active bargaining agents, which disaggregated stockholders do not. But, because bargaining agents are not always effective or faithful, the second element is critical, because it gives the minority stockholders the opportunity to reject their agents&#x27; work. Therefore, when a merger with a controlling stockholder was: 1) negotiated and approved by a special committee of independent directors; and 2) conditioned on an affirmative vote of a majority of the minority stockholders, the business judgment standard of review should presumptively apply, and any plaintiff ought to have to plead particularized facts that, if true, support an inference that, despite the facially fair process, the merger was tainted because of fiduciary wrongdoing.″

===Strategic mergers===
A Strategic merger usually refers to long-term strategic holding of target (Acquired) firm. This type of M&amp;A process aims at creating synergies in the long run by increased market share, broad customer base, and corporate strength of business. A strategic acquirer may also be willing to pay a premium offer to target firm in the outlook of the synergy value created after M&amp;A process.

=== Acqui-hire ===
The term &quot;acqui-hire&quot; is used to refer to acquisitions where the acquiring company seeks to obtain the target company&#x27;s talent, rather than their products (which are often discontinued as part of the acquisition so the team can focus on projects for their new employer). In recent years, these types of acquisitions have become common in the technology industry, where major web companies such as Facebook, Twitter, and Yahoo! have frequently used talent acquisitions to add expertise in particular areas to their workforces.

=== Merger of equals ===
Merger of equals is often a combination of companies of a similar size. Since 1990, there have been more than 625 M&amp;A transactions announced as mergers of equals with a total value of US$2,164.4 bil. Some of the largest mergers of equals took place during the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s and in the year 2000: AOL and Time Warner (US$164 bil.), SmithKline Beecham and Glaxo Wellcome (US$75 bil.), Citicorp and Travelers Group (US$72 bil.). More recent examples this type of combinations are DuPont and Dow Chemical (US$62 bil.) and Praxair and Linde (US$35 bil.).

==Research and statistics for acquired organizations==
An analysis of 1,600 companies across industries revealed the rewards for M&amp;A activity were greater for consumer products companies than the average company. For the period 2000–2010, consumer products companies turned in an average annual TSR of 7.4%, while the average for all companies was 4.8%.

Given that the cost of replacing an executive can run over 100% of his or her annual salary, any investment of time and energy in re-recruitment will likely pay for itself many times over if it helps a business retain just a handful of key players that would have otherwise left.

Organizations should move rapidly to re-recruit key managers. It&#x27;s much easier to succeed with a team of quality players that one selects deliberately rather than try to win a game with those who randomly show up to play.

==Brand considerations==
Mergers and acquisitions often create brand problems, beginning with what to call the company after the transaction and going down into detail about what to do about overlapping and competing product brands. Decisions about what brand equity to write off are not inconsequential. And, given the ability for the right brand choices to drive preference and earn a price premium, the future success of a merger or acquisition depends on making wise brand choices. Brand decision-makers essentially can choose from four different approaches to dealing with naming issues, each with specific pros and cons:
#Keep one name and discontinue the other. The strongest legacy brand with the best prospects for the future lives on. In the merger of United Airlines and Continental Airlines, the United brand will continue forward, while Continental is retired.
#Keep one name and demote the other. The strongest name becomes the company name and the weaker one is demoted to a divisional brand or product brand. An example is Caterpillar Inc. keeping the Bucyrus International name.
#Keep both names and use them together. Some companies try to please everyone and keep the value of both brands by using them together. This can create an unwieldy name, as in the case of PricewaterhouseCoopers, which has since changed its brand name to &quot;PwC&quot;.
#Discard both legacy names and adopt a totally new one. The classic example is the merger of Bell Atlantic with GTE, which became Verizon Communications. Not every merger with a new name is successful. By consolidating into YRC Worldwide, the company lost the considerable value of both Yellow Freight and Roadway Corp.

The factors influencing brand decisions in a merger or acquisition transaction can range from political to tactical. Ego can drive choice just as well as rational factors such as brand value and costs involved with changing brands.

Beyond the bigger issue of what to call the company after the transaction comes the ongoing detailed choices about what divisional, product and service brands to keep. The detailed decisions about the brand portfolio are covered under the topic brand architecture.

==History==

Most histories of M&amp;A begin in the late 19th century United States. However, mergers coincide historically with the existence of companies. In 1708, for example, the East India Company merged with an erstwhile competitor to restore its monopoly over the Indian trade. In 1784, the Italian Monte dei Paschi and Monte Pio banks were united as the Monti Reuniti. In 1821, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company merged with the rival North West Company.

===The Great Merger Movement: 1895–1905===
The Great Merger Movement was a predominantly U.S. business phenomenon that happened from 1895 to 1905. During this time, small firms with little market share consolidated with similar firms to form large, powerful institutions that dominated their markets, such as the Standard Oil Company, which at its height controlled nearly 90% of the global oil refinery industry. It is estimated that more than 1,800 of these firms disappeared into consolidations, many of which acquired substantial shares of the markets in which they operated. The vehicle used were so-called trusts. In 1900 the value of firms acquired in mergers was 20% of GDP. In 1990 the value was only 3% and from 1998 to 2000 it was around 10–11% of GDP. Companies such as DuPont, U.S. Steel, and General Electric that merged during the Great Merger Movement were able to keep their dominance in their respective sectors through 1929, and in some cases today, due to growing technological advances of their products, patents, and brand recognition by their customers. There were also other companies that held the greatest market share in 1905 but at the same time did not have the competitive advantages of the companies like DuPont and General Electric. These companies such as International Paper and American Chicle saw their market share decrease significantly by 1929 as smaller competitors joined forces with each other and provided much more competition. The companies that merged were mass producers of homogeneous goods that could exploit the efficiencies of large volume production. In addition, many of these mergers were capital-intensive. Due to high fixed costs, when demand fell, these newly merged companies had an incentive to maintain output and reduce prices. However more often than not mergers were &quot;quick mergers&quot;. These &quot;quick mergers&quot; involved mergers of companies with unrelated technology and different management. As a result, the efficiency gains associated with mergers were not present. The new and bigger company would actually face higher costs than competitors because of these technological and managerial differences. Thus, the mergers were not done to see large efficiency gains, they were in fact done because that was the trend at the time. Companies which had specific fine products, like fine writing paper, earned their profits on high margin rather than volume and took no part in the Great Merger Movement.

====Short-run factors====
One of the major short run factors that sparked the Great Merger Movement was the desire to keep prices high. However, high prices attracted the entry of new firms into the industry.

A major catalyst behind the Great Merger Movement was the Panic of 1893, which led to a major decline in demand for many homogeneous goods. For producers of homogeneous goods, when demand falls, these producers have more of an incentive to maintain output and cut prices, in order to spread out the high fixed costs these producers faced (i.e. lowering cost per unit) and the desire to exploit efficiencies of maximum volume production. However, during the Panic of 1893, the fall in demand led to a steep fall in prices.

Another economic model proposed by Naomi R. Lamoreaux for explaining the steep price falls is to view the involved firms acting as monopolies in their respective markets. As quasi-monopolists, firms set quantity where marginal cost equals marginal revenue and price where this quantity intersects demand. When the Panic of 1893 hit, demand fell and along with demand, the firm&#x27;s marginal revenue fell as well. Given high fixed costs, the new price was below average total cost, resulting in a loss. However, also being in a high fixed costs industry, these costs can be spread out through greater production (i.e. higher quantity produced). To return to the quasi-monopoly model, in order for a firm to earn profit, firms would steal part of another firm&#x27;s market share by dropping their price slightly and producing to the point where higher quantity and lower price exceeded their average total cost. As other firms joined this practice, prices began falling everywhere and a price war ensued.

One strategy to keep prices high and to maintain profitability was for producers of the same good to collude with each other and form associations, also known as cartels. These cartels were thus able to raise prices right away, sometimes more than doubling prices. However, these prices set by cartels provided only a short-term solution because cartel members would cheat on each other by setting a lower price than the price set by the cartel. Also, the high price set by the cartel would encourage new firms to enter the industry and offer competitive pricing, causing prices to fall once again. As a result, these cartels did not succeed in maintaining high prices for a period of more than a few years. The most viable solution to this problem was for firms to merge, through horizontal integration, with other top firms in the market in order to control a large market share and thus successfully set a higher price.

====Long-run factors====
In the long run, due to desire to keep costs low, it was advantageous for firms to merge and reduce their transportation costs thus producing and transporting from one location rather than various sites of different companies as in the past. Low transport costs, coupled with economies of scale also increased firm size by two- to fourfold during the second half of the nineteenth century. In addition, technological changes prior to the merger movement within companies increased the efficient size of plants with capital intensive assembly lines allowing for economies of scale. Thus improved technology and transportation were forerunners to the Great Merger Movement. In part due to competitors as mentioned above, and in part due to the government, however, many of these initially successful mergers were eventually dismantled. The U.S. government passed the Sherman Act in 1890, setting rules against price fixing and monopolies. Starting in the 1890s with such cases as Addyston Pipe and Steel Company v. United States, the courts attacked large companies for strategizing with others or within their own companies to maximize profits. Price fixing with competitors created a greater incentive for companies to unite and merge under one name so that they were not competitors anymore and technically not price fixing.

The economic history has been divided into &quot;Merger Waves&quot; based on the merger activities in the business world as:

===Objectives in more recent merger waves===
During the third merger wave (1965–1989), corporate marriages involved more diverse companies. Acquirers more frequently bought into different industries. Sometimes this was done to smooth out cyclical bumps, to diversify, the hope being that it would hedge an investment portfolio.

Starting in the fifth merger wave (1992–1998) and continuing today, companies are more likely to acquire in the same business, or close to it, firms that complement and strengthen an acquirer&#x27;s capacity to serve customers.

In recent decades however, cross-sector convergence has become more common. For example, retail companies are buying tech or e-commerce firms to acquire new markets and revenue streams. It has been reported that convergence will remain a key trend in M&amp;A activity through 2015 and onward.

Buyers are not necessarily hungry for the target companies&#x27; hard assets. Some are more interested in acquiring thoughts, methodologies, people and relationships. Paul Graham recognized this in his 2005 essay &quot;Hiring is Obsolete&quot;, in which he theorizes that the free market is better at identifying talent, and that traditional hiring practices do not follow the principles of free market because they depend a lot upon credentials and university degrees. Graham was probably the first to identify the trend in which large companies such as Google, Yahoo! or Microsoft were choosing to acquire startups instead of hiring new recruits, a process known as acqui-hiring.

Many companies are being bought for their patents, licenses, market share, name brand, research staff, methods, customer base, or culture. Soft capital, like this, is very perishable, fragile, and fluid. Integrating it usually takes more finesse and expertise than integrating machinery, real estate, inventory and other tangibles.

=== Largest deals in history ===
The top ten largest deals in M&amp;A history cumulate to a total value of 1,118,963 mil. USD. (1.118 tril. USD).
==Cross-border==

=== Introduction ===
In a study conducted in 2000 by Lehman Brothers, it was found that, on average, large M&amp;A deals cause the domestic currency of the target corporation to appreciate by 1% relative to the acquirer&#x27;s local currency. Until 2018, around 280,472 cross-border deals have been conducted, which cumulates to a total value of almost US$24,069 billion.

The rise of globalization has exponentially increased the necessity for agencies such as the Mergers and Acquisitions International Clearing (MAIC), trust accounts and securities clearing services for Like-Kind Exchanges for cross-border M&amp;A. On a global basis, the value of cross-border mergers and acquisitions rose seven-fold during the 1990s. In 1997 alone, there were over 2,333 cross-border transactions, worth a total of approximately $298 billion.
The vast literature on empirical studies over value creation in cross-border M&amp;A is not conclusive, but points to higher returns in cross-border M&amp;As compared to domestic ones when the acquirer firm has the capability to exploit resources and knowledge of the target&#x27;s firm and of handling challenges. In China, for example, securing regulatory approval can be complex due to an extensive group of various stakeholders at each level of government. In the United Kingdom, acquirers may face pension regulators with significant powers, in addition to an overall M&amp;A environment that is generally more seller-friendly than the U.S. Nonetheless, the current surge in global cross-border M&amp;A has been called the &quot;New Era of Global Economic Discovery&quot;.

In little more than a decade, M&amp;A deals in China increased by a factor of 20, from 69 in 2000 to more than 1,300 in 2013.

In 2014, Europe registered its highest levels of M&amp;A deal activity since the financial crisis. Driven by U.S. and Asian acquirers, inbound M&amp;A, at $320.6 billion, reached record highs by both deal value and deal count since 2001.

Approximately 23 percent of the 416 M&amp;A deals announced in the U.S. M&amp;A market in 2014 involved non-U.S. acquirers.

For 2016, market uncertainties, including Brexit and the potential reform from a U.S. presidential election, contributed to cross-border M&amp;A activity lagging roughly 20% behind 2015 activity.

In 2017, the controverse trend which started in 2015, decreasing total value but rising total number of cross border deals, kept going. Compared on a year on year basis (2016–2017), the total number of cross border deals decreased by −4.2%, while cumulated value increased by 0.6%.

Even mergers of companies with headquarters in the same country can often be considered international in scale and require MAIC custodial services. For example, when Boeing acquired McDonnell Douglas, the two American companies had to integrate operations in dozens of countries around the world (1997). This is just as true for other apparently &quot;single-country&quot; mergers, such as the $29-billion merger of Swiss drug makers Sandoz and Ciba-Geigy (now Novartis).

=== In emerging countries ===

M&amp;A practice in emerging countries differs from more mature economies, although transaction management and valuation tools (e.g. DCF, comparables) share a common basic methodology. In China, India or Brazil for example, differences affect the formation of asset price and on the structuring of deals. Profitability expectations (e.g. shorter time horizon, no terminal value due to low visibility) and risk represented by a discount rate must both be properly adjusted. In a M&amp;A perspective, differences between emerging and more mature economies include: i) a less developed system of property rights, ii) less reliable financial information, iii) cultural differences in negotiations, and iv) a higher degree of competition for the best targets.

* Property rights: the capacity to transfer property rights and legally enforce the protection of such rights after payment may be questionable. Property transfer through the Stock Purchase Agreement can be imperfect (e.g. no real warranties) and even reversible (e.g. one of the multiple administrative authorizations needed not granted after closing) leading to situations where costly remedial actions may be necessary. When the rule of law is not established, corruption can be a rampant problem.
* Information: documentation delivered to a buyer may be scarce with a limited level of reliability. As an example, double sets of accounting are common practice and blur the capacity to form a correct judgment. Running valuation on such basis bears the risk to lead to erroneous conclusions. Therefore, building a reliable knowledge base on observable facts and on the result of focused due diligences, such as recurring profitability measured by EBITDA, is a good starting point.
* Negotiation: &quot;Yes&quot; may not be synonym that the parties have reached an agreement. Getting immediately to the point may not be considered appropriate in some cultures and even considered rude. The negotiations may continue to the last minute, sometimes even after the deal has been officially closed, if the seller keeps some leverage, like a minority stake, in the divested entity. Therefore, establishing a strong local business network before starting acquisitions is usually a prerequisite to get to know trustable parties to deal with and have allies.
* Competition: the race to acquire the best companies in an emerging economy can generate a high degree of competition and inflate transaction prices, as a consequence of limited available targets. This may push for poor management decisions; before investment, time is always needed to build a reliable set of information on the competitive landscape.

If not properly dealt with, these factors will likely have adverse consequences on return-on-investment (ROI) and create difficulties in day-to-day business operations. It is advisable that M&amp;A tools designed for mature economies are not directly used in emerging markets without some adjustment. M&amp;A teams need time to adapt and understand the key operating differences between their home environment and their new market.

==Failure==
Despite the goal of performance improvement, results from mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) are often disappointing compared with results predicted or expected. Numerous empirical studies show high failure rates of M&amp;A deals. Studies are mostly focused on individual determinants. A book by Thomas Straub (2007) &quot;Reasons for frequent failure in Mergers and Acquisitions&quot; develops a comprehensive research framework that bridges different perspectives and promotes an understanding of factors underlying M&amp;A performance in business research and scholarship. The study should help managers in the decision-making process. The first important step towards this objective is the development of a common frame of reference that spans conflicting theoretical assumptions from different perspectives. On this basis, a comprehensive framework is proposed with which to understand the origins of M&amp;A performance better and address the problem of fragmentation by integrating the most important competing perspectives in respect of studies on M&amp;A. Furthermore, according to the existing literature, relevant determinants of firm performance are derived from each dimension of the model. For the dimension strategic management, the six strategic variables: market similarity, market complementarities, production operation similarity, production operation complementarities, market power, and purchasing power were identified as having an important effect on M&amp;A performance. For the dimension organizational behavior, the variables acquisition experience, relative size, and cultural differences were found to be important. Finally, relevant determinants of M&amp;A performance from the financial field were acquisition premium, bidding process, and due diligence. Three different ways in order to best measure post M&amp;A performance are recognized: synergy realization, absolute performance, and finally relative performance.

Employee turnover contributes to M&amp;A failures. The turnover in target companies is double the turnover experienced in non-merged firms for the ten years after the merger.

M&amp;As involving small businesses are particularly problematic and have been found to take longer and cost more than expected with organisation cultural and effective communication with employees being key determinants of success and failure 

Many M&amp;A fail due to lack of planning or execution of the plan. An empirical research study conducted between 1988 and 2002 found that &quot;Successful acquisitions, as defined by return on investment and time to market, are more likely to involve complex products but minimal uncertainty about whether the product is functional and whether there is an appetite in the market.&quot; But failed mergers and acquisitions are caused by &quot;hasty purchases where information platforms between companies were incompatible and the product was not yet tested for release.&quot; A recommendation to resolve these failed mergers is to wait for the product to become established in the market and research has been completed.

Deloitte determines most companies do not do their due diligence in determining whether a M&amp;A is the correct move due to these four reasons:

* Timing
* Cost
* Existing knowledge of the industry
* Do not see the value in due diligence

Transactions that undergo a due diligence process are more likely to be successful.

A considerable body of research suggests that many mergers fail due to human factors such as issues with trust between employees of the two organizations or trust between employees and their leaders.

Any M&amp;A transaction, no matter the size or structure, can have a significant impact on the acquiring company. Developing and implementing a robust due diligence process can lead to a much better assessment of the risks and potential benefits of a transaction, enable the renegotiation of pricing and other key terms, and smooth the way towards a more effective integration.

M&amp;A can hinder innovation by mismanagement or cultural differences between companies. They can also create bottlenecks when they disrupt the flow of innovation with too many company policies and procedures. Market dominant companies can also be their own demise when presented with an M&amp;A opportunity. Complacency and lack of due diligence may cause the market dominant company to miss the value of an innovative product or service.

<doc id="20770" wikidata="Q4345977" url="?curid=20770" title="United States v. Microsoft Corp.">
<text>United States of America v. Microsoft Corporation, 253 F.3d 34 (D.C. Cir. 2001), was a landmark American antitrust law case at the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The U.S. government accused Microsoft of illegally monopolizing the web browser market for Windows, primarily through the legal and technical restrictions it put on the abilities of PC manufacturers (OEMs) and users to uninstall Internet Explorer and use other programs such as Netscape and Java.

At the initial trial which began in 1998, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that Microsoft&#x27;s actions constituted unlawful monopolization under Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit partially overturned that judgment in 2001. The two parties later reached a settlement in which Microsoft agreed to modify some of its business practices.

==History==
By 1984 Microsoft was one of the most successful software companies, with $55 million in 1983 sales. &quot;InfoWorld&quot; wrote:

The Federal Trade Commission began an inquiry in 1990 over whether Microsoft was abusing its monopoly in the PC operating system market. The commissioners deadlocked with a 2–2 vote in 1993 and closed the investigation, but the Department of Justice (DOJ), led by Janet Reno, opened its own investigation later that year, resulting in a settlement on July 15, 1994, in which Microsoft consented not to tie other Microsoft products to the sale of Windows but remained free to integrate additional features into the operating system. In the years that followed, Microsoft insisted that Internet Explorer (IE) was not a &quot;product&quot; but a &quot;feature&quot; that it was allowed to add to Windows, although the DOJ did not agree with this definition.

The government alleged that Microsoft had abused monopoly power on Intel-based personal computers in its handling of operating system and web browser integration. The central issue was whether Microsoft was allowed to bundle its IE web browser software with its Windows operating system. Bundling the two products was allegedly a key factor in Microsoft&#x27;s victory in the browser wars of the late 1990s, as every Windows user had a copy of IE. It was further alleged that this restricted the market for competing web browsers (such as Netscape Navigator or Opera), since it typically took extra time to buy and install the competing browsers. Underlying these disputes were questions of whether Microsoft had manipulated its application programming interfaces to favor IE over third-party browsers. The government also questioned Microsoft&#x27;s conduct in enforcing restrictive licensing agreements with original equipment manufacturers who were required to include that arrangement.

Microsoft argued that the merging of Windows and IE was the result of innovation and competition, that the two were now the same product and inextricably linked, and that consumers were receiving the benefits of IE for free. Opponents countered that IE was still a separate product that did not need to be tied to Windows, since a separate version of IE was available for Mac OS. They also asserted that IE was not really free because its development and marketing costs may have inflated the price of Windows.

Bill Gates himself denied that Microsoft was a monopoly, stating &quot;Microsoft follows the rules. Microsoft is subject to the rules.&quot; He further compared the situation with IBM thirty years prior: &quot;People who feared IBM were wrong. Technology is ever-changing.&quot;

==District Court trial==
The case was initially tried before Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson at the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The suit began on May 18, 1998, with the Department of Justice joined by the Attorneys General of twenty U.S. states and the District of Columbia. The case organized by the Department of Justice was focused less on interoperability, and more on predatory strategies and market barriers to entry; the DOJ built upon the allegation that Microsoft forced computer makers to include its web browser as a part of the installation of Windows software. 

Bill Gates was called &quot;evasive and nonresponsive&quot; by a source present at his videotaped deposition. He argued over the definitions of words such as &quot;compete&quot;, &quot;concerned&quot;, &quot;ask&quot;, and &quot;we&quot;; certain portions of the proceeding would later provoke laughter from the judge when an excerpted version was shown in court. &quot;Businessweek&quot; reported that &quot;early rounds of his deposition show him offering obfuscatory answers and saying &#x27;I don&#x27;t recall&#x27; so many times that even the presiding judge had to chuckle. Many of Gates&#x27;s denials and pleas of ignorance were directly refuted by prosecutors with snippets of e-mails Gates both sent and received.&quot; Intel Vice-president Steven McGeady, called as a witness, quoted Paul Maritz, a senior Microsoft vice president, as having stated an intention to &quot;extinguish&quot; and &quot;smother&quot; rival Netscape Communications Corporation and to &quot;cut off Netscape&#x27;s air supply&quot; by giving away a clone of Netscape&#x27;s flagship product for free.

A number of videotapes were submitted as evidence by Microsoft during the trial, including one that demonstrated that removing Internet Explorer from Microsoft Windows caused slowdowns and malfunctions in Windows. In the videotaped demonstration of what then-Microsoft vice president Jim Allchin stated to be a seamless segment filmed on one PC, the government noticed that some icons mysteriously disappeared and reappeared on the PC&#x27;s desktop, suggesting that the effects might have been falsified. Allchin admitted that the blame for the tape problems lay with some of his staff. &quot;They ended up filming it—grabbing the wrong screen shot&quot;, he said of the incident. Later, Allchin re-ran the demonstration and provided a new videotape, but in so doing Microsoft dropped the claim that Windows is slowed down when IE is removed. Mark Murray, a Microsoft spokesperson, berated the government attorneys for &quot;nitpicking on issues like video production&quot;.Microsoft later submitted a second inaccurate videotape into evidence. The issue was how easy or difficult it was for America Online users to download and install Netscape Navigator onto a Windows PC. Microsoft&#x27;s videotape showed the process as being quick and easy, resulting in the Netscape icon appearing on the user&#x27;s desktop. The government produced its own videotape of the same process, revealing that Microsoft&#x27;s videotape had conveniently removed a long and complex part of the procedure and that the Netscape icon was not placed on the desktop, requiring a user to search for it. Brad Chase, a Microsoft vice president, verified the government&#x27;s tape and conceded that Microsoft&#x27;s own tape was falsified.

When the judge suggested that Microsoft offer a version of Windows that did not include Internet Explorer, Microsoft responded that the company would offer manufacturers a choice: one version of Windows that was obsolete, or another that did not work properly. The judge asked, &quot;It seemed absolutely clear to you that I entered an order that required that you distribute a product that would not work?&quot; David Cole, a Microsoft vice president, replied, &quot;In plain English, yes. We followed that order. It wasn&#x27;t my place to consider the consequences of that.&quot;

Gates and his successor as CEO Steve Ballmer were so worried about the outcome of the case that they discussed leaving Microsoft &quot;if they really screw the company that badly, really just split it up in a totally irrational way,&quot; Gates recalled. Microsoft defended itself in the public arena, arguing that its attempts to &quot;innovate&quot; were under attack by rival companies jealous of its success, and that government litigation was merely their pawn. A full-page ad appeared in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; on June 2, 1999, created by a think tank called The Independent Institute. The ad was presented as &quot;An Open Letter to President Clinton from 240 Economists on Antitrust Protectionism.&quot; It said in part, &quot;Consumers did not ask for these antitrust actions – rival business firms did. Consumers of high technology have enjoyed falling prices, expanding outputs, and a breathtaking array of new products and innovations. ... Increasingly, however, some firms have sought to handicap their rivals by turning to government for protection. Many of these cases are based on speculation about some vaguely specified consumer harm in some unspecified future, and many of the proposed interventions will weaken successful U.S. firms and impede their competitiveness abroad.&quot;

=== Judgment ===
Judge Jackson issued his findings of fact on November 5, 1999, holding that Microsoft&#x27;s dominance of the x86-based personal computer operating systems market constituted a monopoly, and that Microsoft had taken actions to crush threats to that monopoly, including applications from Apple, Java, Netscape, Lotus Software, RealNetworks, Linux, and others. On April 3, 2000, Jackson issued his conclusions of law, holding that Microsoft had engaged in monopolization, attempted monopolization, and tying in violation of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act. 

On June 7, 2000, the District Court ordered a breakup of Microsoft as its remedy. According to that judgment, Microsoft would have to be split into two separate units, one to produce the operating system and one to produce other software components. Microsoft immediately appealed the judgment to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.

==Appeals Court decision==
After Microsoft filed its appeal, the U.S. government and the states in the suit requested a process that would skip the intermediate Circuit Court and send the case directly to the U.S. Supreme Court. Such an action is permitted by a section of the United States Code that gives the Supreme Court jurisdiction to hear direct appeals from the District Court level in certain antitrust cases initiated by the federal government, if &quot;the district judge who adjudicated the case enters an order stating that immediate consideration of the appeal by the Supreme Court is of general public importance in the administration of justice.&quot; The states also filed a petition for certiorari before judgment at the Supreme Court, requesting the same direct appeal process without going through the Circuit Court. The Supreme Court rejected these requests and sent the appeal to the D.C. Circuit Court.

On June 28, 2001, the Circuit Court overturned Judge Jackson&#x27;s rulings against Microsoft. This was partly because Jackson had improperly discussed the case with the news media while it was still in progress, violating the code of conduct for American judges. The Circuit Court judges accused Jackson of unethical conduct and determined that he should have recused himself from the case. Thus the Circuit Court adopted a &quot;drastically altered scope of liability&quot; due to Jackson&#x27;s conduct, which was favorable for Microsoft. 

Jackson&#x27;s response was that Microsoft&#x27;s conduct itself was the cause of any &quot;perceived bias&quot;; Microsoft executives had, according to him, &quot;proved, time and time again, to be inaccurate, misleading, evasive, and transparently false. ... Microsoft is a company with an institutional disdain for both the truth and for rules of law that lesser entities must respect. It is also a company whose senior management is not averse to offering specious testimony to support spurious defenses to claims of its wrongdoing.&quot; 

Ultimately, the Circuit Court overturned Jackson&#x27;s holding that Microsoft should be broken up as an illegal monopoly. However, the Circuit Court did not overturn Jackson&#x27;s findings of fact, and held that traditional antitrust analysis was not equipped to consider software-related practices like browser tie-ins. The case was remanded back to the D.C. District Court for further proceedings on this matter, with Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly presiding.

==Settlement==
The Department of Justice announced on September 6, 2001 that it was no longer seeking to break up Microsoft and would instead seek a lesser antitrust penalty. Microsoft decided to draft a settlement proposal allowing PC manufacturers to adopt non-Microsoft software.

On November 1, 2001, the DOJ reached an agreement with Microsoft to settle the case. The proposed settlement required Microsoft to share its application programming interfaces with third-party companies and appoint a panel of three people who would have full access to Microsoft&#x27;s systems, records, and source code for five years in order to ensure compliance. However, the DOJ did not require Microsoft to change any of its code nor did it prevent Microsoft from tying other software with Windows in the future. On August 5, 2002, Microsoft announced that it would make some concessions towards the proposed final settlement ahead of the judge&#x27;s decision. On November 1, 2002, Judge Kollar-Kotelly released a ruling that accepted most of the proposed DOJ settlement. Nine states and the District of Columbia (which had been pursuing the case together with the DOJ) did not agree with the settlement, arguing that it did not go far enough to curb Microsoft&#x27;s anti-competitive business practices. On June 30, 2004, the D.C. Circuit Court approved the settlement with the Justice Department, rejecting the states&#x27; claims that the sanctions were inadequate.

In its 2008 Annual Report, Microsoft stated:

Microsoft&#x27;s obligations under the settlement, as originally drafted, expired on November 12, 2007. However, Microsoft later &quot;agreed to consent to a two-year extension of part of the Final Judgments&quot; dealing with communications protocol licensing, and stated that if the government later wished to extend those aspects of the settlement as far as 2012, it would not object. The government made clear that the extension was intended only to give the relevant part of the settlement &quot;the opportunity to succeed for the period of time it was intended to cover&quot;, rather than being due to any &quot;pattern of willful and systematic violations&quot;.

==Impact and criticism==
After the 2002 settlement, industry pundit Robert X. Cringely believed a breakup was not possible, and that &quot;now the only way Microsoft can die is by suicide.&quot; Andrew Chin, an antitrust law professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who assisted Judge Jackson in drafting the findings of fact at the initial District Court trial, wrote that the settlement gave Microsoft &quot;a special antitrust immunity to license Windows and other &#x27;platform software&#x27; under contractual terms that destroy freedom of competition.&quot; Law professor Eben Moglen noted that the way Microsoft was required to disclose its APIs and protocols was useful only for “interoperating with a Windows Operating System Product”, not for implementing support of those APIs and protocols in any competing operating system.

Economist Milton Friedman wrote in 1999 that the antitrust case against Microsoft set a dangerous precedent that foreshadowed increasing government regulation of an industry that had been relatively free of government intrusion, and that future technological progress in the industry will be impeded as a result. After the resulting settlement, the magazine &quot;Business &amp; Economic Research&quot; wrote that, contrary to Friedman&#x27;s forecasts, the case had to that point had little effect on Microsoft&#x27;s behavior. The fines, restrictions, and monitoring imposed were not enough to prevent it from &quot;abusing its monopolistic power and too little to prevent it from dominating the software and operating system industry.&quot; For that reason, Microsoft remained dominant and monopolistic after the trial, and it continued to stifle competitors and innovative technology.

Richard Stallman, founder of the Free Software Foundation, advocating for computing freedom, provided suggestions to Ralph Nader&#x27;s Consumer Project on Technology for dealing with Microsoft&#x27;s behavior in March 1999. He has suggested, for instance, that Microsoft should be required to publish complete documentation of all interfaces between software components, all communications protocols, and all files. In short, the company should not release any implementations for undocumented interfaces. Stallman also noted that Microsoft should refrain from certifying any hardware as compatible with Microsoft software, unless the hardware&#x27;s complete specifications have been published, so that an alternative software to support the same hardware can be implemented freely.

Chris Butts, writing in the &quot;Northwestern Journal of Technology and Intellectual Property&quot;, argued that the U.S. government recognized the benefits of including a web browser with an operating system. At the appellate level, the government dropped the claim of tying given that—as laid out in Section 1 of the Sherman Act—it would have had to prove that more harm than good resulted from the type of tying carried out by Microsoft.

<doc id="20771" wikidata="Q309372" url="?curid=20771" title="Mercator projection">
<text>The Mercator projection () is a conformal cylindrical map projection first presented by Flemish geographer and mapmaker Gerardus Mercator in 1569. In the 18th century, it became the standard map projection for navigation due to its property of representing rhumb lines as straight lines. When applied to world maps, the Mercator projection inflates the size of lands the further they are from the equator. Therefore, landmasses such as Greenland and Antarctica appear far larger than they actually are relative to landmasses near the equator. Nowadays the Mercator projection is widely used because, aside from marine navigation, it is well suited for internet web maps.

== History ==
Joseph Needham, a historian of China, speculated that some star charts of the Chinese Song dynasty may have been drafted on the Mercator projection; however, this claim was presented without evidence, and astronomical historian Kazuhiko Miyajima concluded using cartometric analysis that these charts used an equirectangular projection instead.

In the 13th century, the earliest extant portolan charts of the Mediterranean sea, which are generally not believed to be based on any deliberate map projection, included windrose networks of criss-crossing lines which could be used to help set a ship&#x27;s bearing in sailing between locations on the chart; the region of the Earth covered by such charts was small enough that a course of constant bearing would be approximately straight on the chart. The charts have startling accuracy not found in the maps constructed by contemporary European or Arab scholars, and their construction remains enigmatic; based on cartometric analysis which seems to contradict the scholarly consensus, they have been speculated to have originated in some unknown pre-medieval cartographic tradition, possibly evidence of some ancient understanding of the Mercator projection.

German polymath Erhard Etzlaub engraved miniature &quot;compass maps&quot; (about 10×8 cm) of Europe and parts of Africa that spanned latitudes 0°–67° to allow adjustment of his portable pocket-size sundials. The projection found on these maps, dating to 1511, was stated by John Snyder in 1987 to be the same projection as Mercator&#x27;s. However, given the geometry of a sundial, these maps may well have been based on the similar central cylindrical projection, a limiting case of the gnomonic projection, which is the basis for a sundial. Snyder amended his assessment to &quot;a similar projection&quot; in 1993.

Portuguese mathematician and cosmographer Pedro Nunes first described the mathematical principle of the rhumb line or loxodrome, a path with constant bearing as measured relative to true north, which can be used in marine navigation to pick which compass bearing to follow. In 1537, he proposed constructing a nautical atlas composed of several large-scale sheets in the equirectangular projection as a way to minimize distortion of directions. If these sheets were brought to the same scale and assembled, they would approximate the Mercator projection.
In 1541, Flemish geographer and mapmaker Gerardus Mercator included a network of rhumb lines on a terrestrial globe he made for Nicolas Perrenot.

In 1569, Mercator announced a new projection by publishing a large world map measuring and printed in eighteen separate sheets. Mercator titled the map : &quot;A new and augmented description of Earth corrected for the use of sailors&quot;. This title, along with an elaborate explanation for using the projection that appears as a section of text on the map, shows that Mercator understood exactly what he had achieved and that he intended the projection to aid navigation. Mercator never explained the method of construction or how he arrived at it. Various hypotheses have been tendered over the years, but in any case Mercator&#x27;s friendship with Pedro Nunes and his access to the loxodromic tables Nunes created likely aided his efforts.

English mathematician Edward Wright published the first accurate tables for constructing the projection in 1599 and, in more detail, in 1610, calling his treatise &quot;Certaine Errors in Navigation&quot;. The first mathematical formulation was publicized around 1645 by a mathematician named Henry Bond (–1678). However, the mathematics involved were developed but never published by mathematician Thomas Harriot starting around 1589.

The development of the Mercator projection represented a major breakthrough in the nautical cartography of the 16th century. However, it was much ahead of its time, since the old navigational and surveying techniques were not compatible with its use in navigation. Two main problems prevented its immediate application: the impossibility of determining the longitude at sea with adequate accuracy and the fact that magnetic directions, instead of geographical directions, were used in navigation. Only in the middle of the 18th century, after the marine chronometer was invented and the spatial distribution of magnetic declination was known, could the Mercator projection be fully adopted by navigators.

Despite those position-finding limitations, the Mercator projection can be found in many world maps in the centuries following Mercator&#x27;s first publication. However, it did not begin to dominate world maps until the 19th century, when the problem of position determination had been largely solved. Once the Mercator became the usual projection for commercial and educational maps, it came under persistent criticism from cartographers for its unbalanced representation of landmasses and its inability to usefully show the polar regions.

The criticisms leveled against inappropriate use of the Mercator projection resulted in a flurry of new inventions in the late 19th and early 20th century, often directly touted as alternatives to the Mercator. Due to these pressures, publishers gradually reduced their use of the projection over the course of the 20th century. However, the advent of Web mapping gave the projection an abrupt resurgence in the form of the Web Mercator projection.

Today, the Mercator can be found in marine charts, occasional world maps, and Web mapping services, but commercial atlases have largely abandoned it, and wall maps of the world can be found in many alternative projections. Google Maps, which relied on it since 2005, still uses it for local-area maps but dropped the projection from desktop platforms in 2017 for maps that are zoomed out of local areas. Many other online mapping services still exclusively use the Web Mercator.

The Mercator projection can be visualized as the result of wrapping a cylinder tightly around a sphere, with the two surfaces &quot;tangent&quot; to (touching) each other along a circle halfway between the poles of their common axis, and then conformally unfolding the surface of the sphere outward onto the cylinder, meaning that at each point the projection uniformly scales the image of a small portion of the spherical surface without otherwise distorting it, preserving angles between intersecting curves. Afterward, this cylinder is unrolled onto a flat plane to make a map. In this interpretation, the scale of the surface is preserved exactly along the circle where the cylinder touches the sphere, but increases nonlinearly for points further from the contact circle. However, by uniformly shrinking the resulting flat map, as a final step, any pair of circles parallel to and equidistant from the contact circle can be chosen to have their scale preserved, called the &quot;standard parallels&quot;; then the region between chosen circles will have its scale smaller than on the sphere, reaching a minimum at the contact circle. This is sometimes visualized as a projection onto a cylinder which is &quot;secant&quot; to (cuts) the sphere, though this picture is misleading insofar as the standard parallels are not spaced the same distance apart on the map as the shortest distance between them through the interior of the sphere.

The original and most common aspect of the Mercator projection for maps of the Earth is the normal aspect, for which the axis of the cylinder is the Earth&#x27;s axis of rotation which passes through the North and South poles, and the contact circle is the Earth&#x27;s equator. As for all cylindrical projections in normal aspect, circles of latitude and meridians of longitude are straight and perpendicular to each other on the map, forming a grid of rectangles. While circles of latitude on the Earth are smaller the closer they are to the poles, they are stretched in an East–West direction to have uniform length on any cylindrical map projection. Among cylindrical projections, the Mercator projection is the unique projection which balances this East–West stretching by a precisely corresponding North–South stretching, so that at every location the scale is locally uniform and angles are preserved.

The Mercator projection in normal aspect maps trajectories of constant bearing (called &quot;rhumb lines&quot; or &quot;loxodromes&quot;) on a sphere to straight lines on the map, and is thus uniquely suited to marine navigation: courses and bearings are measured using a compass rose or protractor, and the corresponding directions are easily transferred from point to point, on the map, e.g. with the help of a parallel ruler.

Because the linear scale of a Mercator map in normal aspect increases with latitude, it distorts the size of geographical objects far from the equator and conveys a distorted perception of the overall geometry of the planet. At latitudes greater than 70° north or south, the Mercator projection is practically unusable, because the linear scale becomes infinitely large at the poles. A Mercator map can therefore never fully show the polar areas (but see Uses below for applications of the oblique and transverse Mercator projections).

The Mercator projection is often compared to and confused with the central cylindrical projection, which is the result of projecting points from the sphere onto a tangent cylinder along straight radial lines, as if from a light source placed at the Earth&#x27;s center. Both have extreme distortion far from the equator and cannot show the poles. However, they are different projections and have different properties.

== Distortion of sizes ==

As with all map projections, the shapes or sizes are distortions of the true layout of the Earth&#x27;s surface. The Mercator projection exaggerates areas far from the equator; the closer to the poles of the Earth, the greater the distortion.

===Examples of size distortion===
* Greenland appears the same size as Africa, when in reality Africa&#x27;s area is 14 times as large. 
** Greenland&#x27;s real area is comparable to the Democratic Republic of the Congo&#x27;s alone. 
** Africa appears to be roughly the same size as South America, when in reality Africa is over one and a half times as large.
* Alaska appears to be the same size as Australia, although Australia is actually 4.5 times as large.
** Alaska also takes as much area on the map as Brazil, whereas Brazil&#x27;s area is nearly 5 times that of Alaska.
* Madagascar and Great Britain look about the same size, while Madagascar is actually more than twice as large as Great Britain.

===Criticism===
Because of great land area distortions, critics like George Kellaway and Irving Fisher consider the projection unsuitable for general world maps. It has been conjectured to have influenced people&#x27;s views of the world: because it shows countries near the Equator as too small when compared to those of Europe and North America, it has been supposed to cause people to consider those countries as less important. Mercator himself used the equal-area sinusoidal projection to show relative areas. However, despite such criticisms, the Mercator projection was, especially in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, perhaps the most common projection used in world maps.

Atlases largely stopped using the Mercator projection for world maps or for areas distant from the equator in the 1940s, preferring other cylindrical projections, or forms of equal-area projection. The Mercator projection is, however, still commonly used for areas near the equator where distortion is minimal. It is also frequently found in maps of time zones.

Arno Peters stirred controversy beginning in 1972 when he proposed what is now usually called the Gall–Peters projection to remedy the problems of the Mercator, claiming it to be his own original work without referencing prior work by cartographers such as Gall&#x27;s work from 1855. The projection he promoted is a specific parameterization of the cylindrical equal-area projection. In response, a 1989 resolution by seven North American geographical groups disparaged using cylindrical projections for general-purpose world maps, which would include both the Mercator and the Gall–Peters.

== Uses ==

Practically every marine chart in print is based on the Mercator projection due to its uniquely favorable properties for navigation. It is also commonly used by street map services hosted on the Internet, due to its uniquely favorable properties for local-area maps computed on demand. Mercator projections were also important in the mathematical development of plate tectonics in the 1960s.

===Marine navigation===
The Mercator projection was designed for use in marine navigation because of its unique property of representing any course of constant bearing as a straight segment. Such a course, known as a rhumb (alternately called a rhumb line or loxodrome) is preferred in marine navigation because ships can sail in a constant compass direction. This reduces the difficult, error-prone course corrections that otherwise would be necessary when sailing a different course.

For small distances (compared to the radius of the Earth), the difference between the rhumb and the great circle course is negligible. Even for longer distances, the simplicity of the constant bearing makes it attractive. As observed by Mercator, on such a course, the ship would not arrive by the shortest route, but it will surely arrive. Sailing a rhumb meant that all that the sailors had to do was keep a constant course as long as they knew where they were when they started, where they intended to be when they finished, and had a map in Mercator projection that correctly showed those two coordinates.

=== Web Mercator ===
Many major online street mapping services (Bing Maps, Google Maps, Mapbox, MapQuest, OpenStreetMap, Yahoo! Maps, and others) use a variant of the Mercator projection for their map images called Web Mercator or Google Web Mercator. Despite its obvious scale variation at the world level (small scales), the projection is well-suited as an interactive world map that can be zoomed seamlessly to local (large-scale) maps, where there is relatively little distortion due to the variant projection&#x27;s near-conformality.

The major online street mapping services&#x27; tiling systems display most of the world at the lowest zoom level as a single square image, excluding the polar regions by truncation at latitudes of &quot;φ&quot;max = ±85.05113°. (See below.) Latitude values outside this range are mapped using a different relationship that does not diverge at &quot;φ&quot; = ±90°.

===Transverse Mercator===

A transverse Mercator projection tilts the cylinder axis so that it is perpendicular to Earth&#x27;s axis. The tangent standard line then coincides with a meridian and its opposite meridian, giving a constant scale factor along those meridians and making the projection useful for mapping regions that are predominately north–south in extent. In its more complex ellipsoidal form, most national grid systems around the world use the transverse Mercator, as does the Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system.

===Oblique Mercator===
An oblique Mercator projection tilts the cylinder axis away from the Earth&#x27;s axis to an angle of one&#x27;s choosing, so that its tangent or secant lines of contact are circles that are also tilted relative to the Earth&#x27;s parallels of latitude. Practical uses for the oblique projection, such as national grid systems, use ellipsoidal developments of the oblique Mercator in order to keep scale variation low along the surface projection of the cylinder&#x27;s axis.

== Mathematics ==
=== Cylindrical projections ===
Although the surface of Earth is best modelled by an oblate ellipsoid of revolution, for small scale maps the ellipsoid is approximated by a sphere of radius &quot;a&quot;, where &quot;a&quot; is approximately 6,371 km. This spherical approximation of Earth can be modelled by a smaller sphere of radius &quot;R&quot;, called the &quot;globe&quot; in this section. The globe determines the scale of the map. The various cylindrical projections specify how the geographic detail is transferred from the globe to a cylinder tangential to it at the equator. The cylinder is then unrolled to give the planar map. The fraction is called the representative fraction (RF) or the principal scale of the projection. For example, a Mercator map printed in a book might have an equatorial width of 13.4 cm corresponding to a globe radius of 2.13 cm and an RF of approximately (M is used as an abbreviation for 1,000,000 in writing an RF) whereas Mercator&#x27;s original 1569 map has a width of 198 cm corresponding to a globe radius of 31.5 cm and an RF of about .

A cylindrical map projection is specified by formulae linking the geographic coordinates of latitude &quot;φ&quot; and longitude &quot;λ&quot; to Cartesian coordinates on the map with origin on the equator and &quot;x&quot;-axis along the equator. By construction, all points on the same meridian lie on the same &quot;generator&quot; of the cylinder at a constant value of &quot;x&quot;, but the distance &quot;y&quot; along the generator (measured from the equator) is an arbitrary function of latitude, &quot;y&quot;(&quot;φ&quot;). In general this function does not describe the geometrical projection (as of light rays onto a screen) from the centre of the globe to the cylinder, which is only one of an unlimited number of ways to conceptually project a cylindrical map.

Since the cylinder is tangential to the globe at the equator, the scale factor between globe and cylinder is unity on the equator but nowhere else. In particular since the radius of a parallel, or circle of latitude, is &quot;R&quot; cos &quot;φ&quot;, the corresponding parallel on the map must have been stretched by a factor of . This scale factor on the parallel is conventionally denoted by &quot;k&quot; and the corresponding scale factor on the meridian is denoted by &quot;h&quot;.

=== Scale factor ===

The Mercator projection is conformal. One implication of that is the &quot;isotropy of scale factors&quot;, which means that the point scale factor is independent of direction, so that small shapes are preserved by the projection. This implies that the vertical scale factor, &quot;h&quot;, equals the horizontal scale factor, &quot;k&quot;. Since &quot;k&quot; = , so must &quot;h&quot;.
The graph shows the variation of this scale factor with latitude. Some numerical values are listed below.
:at latitude 30° the scale factor is   &quot;k&quot; = sec 30° ≈ 1.15,
:at latitude 45° the scale factor is   &quot;k&quot; = sec 45° ≈ 1.41,
:at latitude 60° the scale factor is   &quot;k&quot; = sec 60° = 2,
:at latitude 80° the scale factor is   &quot;k&quot; = sec 80° ≈ 5.76,
:at latitude 85° the scale factor is   &quot;k&quot; = sec 85° ≈ 11.5

The area scale factor is the product of the parallel and meridian scales . For Greenland, taking 73° as a median latitude, &quot;hk&quot; = 11.7. For Australia, taking 25° as a median latitude, &quot;hk&quot; = 1.2. For Great Britain, taking 55° as a median latitude, &quot;hk&quot; = 3.04.

The variation with latitude is sometimes indicated by multiple bar scales as shown below.

The classic way of showing the distortion inherent in a projection is to use Tissot&#x27;s indicatrix. Nicolas Tissot noted that the scale factors at a point on a map projection, specified by the numbers &quot;h&quot; and &quot;k&quot;, define an ellipse at that point. For cylindrical projections, the axes of the ellipse are aligned to the meridians and parallels. For the Mercator projection, &quot;h&quot; = &quot;k&quot;, so the ellipses degenerate into circles with radius proportional to the value of the scale factor for that latitude. These circles are rendered on the projected map with extreme variation in size, indicative of Mercator&#x27;s scale variations.

=== Mercator projection transformations ===
==== Derivation ====

As discussed above, the isotropy condition implies that &quot;h&quot; = &quot;k&quot; = . Consider a point on the globe of radius &quot;R&quot; with longitude &quot;λ&quot; and latitude &quot;φ&quot;. If &quot;φ&quot; is increased by an infinitesimal amount, &quot;dφ&quot;, the point moves &quot;R&quot; &quot;dφ&quot; along a meridian of the globe of radius &quot;R&quot;, so the corresponding change in &quot;y&quot;, &quot;dy&quot;, must be &quot;hR&quot; &quot;dφ&quot; = &quot;R&quot; sec &quot;φ&quot; &quot;dφ&quot;. Therefore &quot;y′&quot;(&quot;φ&quot;) = &quot;R&quot; sec &quot;φ&quot;. Similarly, increasing &quot;λ&quot; by &quot;dλ&quot; moves the point &quot;R&quot; cos &quot;φ&quot; &quot;dλ&quot; along a parallel of the globe, so &quot;dx&quot; = &quot;kR&quot; cos &quot;φ&quot; &quot;dλ&quot; = &quot;R&quot; &quot;dλ&quot;. That is, &quot;x′&quot;(&quot;λ&quot;) = &quot;R&quot;. Integrating the equations
:formula_1

with &quot;x&quot;(&quot;λ&quot;0) = 0 and &quot;y&quot;(0) = 0, gives &quot;x(λ)&quot; and &quot;y(φ)&quot;. The value &quot;λ&quot;0 is the longitude of an arbitrary central meridian that is usually, but not always, that of Greenwich (i.e., zero). The angles &quot;λ&quot; and &quot;φ&quot; are expressed in radians. By the integral of the secant function,

:formula_2

The function &quot;y&quot;(&quot;φ&quot;) is plotted alongside &quot;φ&quot; for the case &quot;R&quot; = 1: it tends to infinity at the poles. The linear &quot;y&quot;-axis values are not usually shown on printed maps; instead some maps show the non-linear scale of latitude values on the right. More often than not the maps show only a graticule of selected meridians and parallels.

==== Inverse transformations ====
:formula_3

The expression on the right of the second equation defines the Gudermannian function; i.e., &quot;φ&quot; = gd(): the direct equation may therefore be written as &quot;y&quot; = &quot;R&quot;·gd−1(&quot;φ&quot;).

==== Alternative expressions ====
There are many alternative expressions for &quot;y&quot;(&quot;φ&quot;), all derived by elementary manipulations.
:formula_4

Corresponding inverses are:
:formula_5
For angles expressed in degrees:
:formula_6

The above formulae are written in terms of the globe radius &quot;R&quot;. It is often convenient to work directly with the map width &quot;W&quot; = 2&quot;R&quot;. For example, the basic transformation equations become
:formula_7

==== Truncation and aspect ratio ====
The ordinate &quot;y&quot; of the Mercator projection becomes infinite at the poles and the map must be truncated at some latitude less than ninety degrees. This need not be done symmetrically. Mercator&#x27;s original map is truncated at 80°N and 66°S with the result that European countries were moved toward the centre of the map. The aspect ratio of his map is = 1.65. Even more extreme truncations have been used: a Finnish school atlas was truncated at approximately 76°N and 56°S, an aspect ratio of 1.97.

Much Web-based mapping uses a zoomable version of the Mercator projection with an aspect ratio of one. In this case the maximum latitude attained must correspond to &quot;y&quot; = ±, or equivalently  = . Any of the inverse transformation formulae may be used to calculate the corresponding latitudes:
:formula_8

=== Small element geometry ===
The relations between &quot;y&quot;(&quot;φ&quot;) and properties of the projection, such as the transformation of angles and the variation in scale, follow from the geometry of corresponding &quot;small&quot; elements on the globe and map. The figure below shows a point P at latitude &quot;φ&quot; and longitude &quot;λ&quot; on the globe and a nearby point Q at latitude &quot;φ&quot; + &quot;δφ&quot; and longitude &quot;λ&quot; + &quot;δλ&quot;. The vertical lines PK and MQ are arcs of meridians of length &quot;Rδφ&quot;. The horizontal lines PM and KQ are arcs of parallels of length &quot;R&quot;(cos &quot;φ&quot;)&quot;δλ&quot;. The corresponding points on the projection define a rectangle of width &quot;δx&quot; and height &quot;δy&quot;.
For small elements, the angle PKQ is approximately a right angle and therefore
:formula_9

The previously mentioned scaling factors from globe to cylinder are given by
:&quot;parallel scale factor&quot;     formula_10
:&quot;meridian scale factor&quot;   formula_11

Since the meridians are mapped to lines of constant &quot;x&quot;, we must have and &quot;δx&quot; = &quot;Rδλ&quot;, (&quot;λ&quot; in radians). Therefore, in the limit of infinitesimally small elements
:formula_12

In the case of the Mercator projection, &quot;y&quot;&#x27;(&quot;φ&quot;) = &quot;R&quot; sec &quot;φ&quot;, so this gives us &quot;h&quot; = &quot;k&quot; and &quot;α&quot; = &quot;β&quot;. The fact that &quot;h&quot; = &quot;k&quot; is the isotropy of scale factors discussed above. The fact that &quot;α&quot; = &quot;β&quot; reflects another implication of the mapping being conformal, namely the fact that a sailing course of constant azimuth on the globe is mapped into the same constant grid bearing on the map.

=== Formulae for distance ===
Converting ruler distance on the Mercator map into true (great circle) distance on the sphere is straightforward along the equator but nowhere else. One problem is the variation of scale with latitude, and another is that straight lines on the map (rhumb lines), other than the meridians or the equator, do not correspond to great circles.

The distinction between rhumb (sailing) distance and great circle (true) distance was clearly understood by Mercator. (See Legend 12 on the 1569 map.) He stressed that the rhumb line distance is an acceptable approximation for true great circle distance for courses of short or moderate distance, particularly at lower latitudes. He even quantifies his statement: &quot;When the great circle distances which are to be measured in the vicinity of the equator do not exceed 20 degrees of a great circle, or 15 degrees near Spain and France, or 8 and even 10 degrees in northern parts it is convenient to use rhumb line distances&quot;.

For a ruler measurement of a &quot;short&quot; line, with midpoint at latitude &quot;φ&quot;, where the scale factor is &quot;k&quot; = sec &quot;φ&quot; = :
:True distance = rhumb distance ≅ ruler distance × cos &quot;φ&quot; / RF.   (short lines)

With radius and great circle circumference equal to 6,371 km and 40,030 km respectively an RF of , for which &quot;R&quot; = 2.12 cm and &quot;W&quot; = 13.34 cm, implies that a ruler measurement of 3 mm. in any direction from a point on the equator corresponds to approximately 900 km. The corresponding distances for latitudes 20°, 40°, 60° and 80° are 846 km, 689 km, 450 km and 156 km respectively.

Longer distances require various approaches.

==== On the equator ====
Scale is unity on the equator (for a non-secant projection). Therefore, interpreting ruler measurements on the equator is simple:
:True distance = ruler distance / RF     (equator)

For the above model, with RF = , 1 cm corresponds to 3,000 km.

==== On other parallels ====
On any other parallel the scale factor is sec &quot;φ&quot; so that
:Parallel distance = ruler distance × cos &quot;φ&quot; / RF     (parallel).

For the above model 1 cm corresponds to 1,500 km at a latitude of 60°.

This is not the shortest distance between the chosen endpoints on the parallel because a parallel is not a great circle. The difference is small for short distances but increases as &quot;λ&quot;, the longitudinal separation, increases. For two points, A and B, separated by 10° of longitude on the parallel at 60° the distance along the parallel is approximately 0.5 km greater than the great circle distance. (The distance AB along the parallel is (&quot;a&quot; cos &quot;φ&quot;) &quot;λ&quot;. The length of the chord AB is 2(&quot;a&quot; cos &quot;φ&quot;) sin . This chord subtends an angle at the centre equal to 2arcsin(cos &quot;φ&quot; sin ) and the great circle distance between A and B is 2&quot;a&quot; arcsin(cos &quot;φ&quot; sin ).) In the extreme case where the longitudinal separation is 180°, the distance along the parallel is one half of the circumference of that parallel; i.e., 10,007.5 km. On the other hand, the geodesic between these points is a great circle arc through the pole subtending an angle of 60° at the center: the length of this arc is one sixth of the great circle circumference, about 6,672 km. The difference is 3,338 km so the ruler distance measured from the map is quite misleading even after correcting for the latitude variation of the scale factor.

==== On a meridian ====
A meridian of the map is a great circle on the globe but the continuous scale variation means ruler measurement alone cannot yield the true distance between distant points on the meridian. However, if the map is marked with an accurate and finely spaced latitude scale from which the latitude may be read directly—as is the case for the Mercator 1569 world map (sheets 3, 9, 15) and all subsequent nautical charts—the meridian distance between two latitudes &quot;φ&quot;1 and &quot;φ&quot;2 is simply
:formula_13

If the latitudes of the end points cannot be determined with confidence then they can be found instead by calculation on the ruler distance. Calling the ruler distances of the end points on the map meridian as measured from the equator &quot;y&quot;1 and &quot;y&quot;2, the true distance between these points on the sphere is given by using any one of the inverse Mercator formulae:
:formula_14

where &quot;R&quot; may be calculated from the width &quot;W&quot; of the map by &quot;R&quot; = . For example, on a map with &quot;R&quot; = 1 the values of &quot;y&quot; = 0, 1, 2, 3 correspond to latitudes of &quot;φ&quot; = 0°, 50°, 75°, 84° and therefore the successive intervals of 1 cm on the map correspond to latitude intervals on the globe of 50°, 25°, 9° and distances of 5,560 km, 2,780 km, and 1,000 km on the Earth.

==== On a rhumb ====
A straight line on the Mercator map at angle &quot;α&quot; to the meridians is a rhumb line. When &quot;α&quot; =  or the rhumb corresponds to one of the parallels; only one, the equator, is a great circle. When &quot;α&quot; = 0 or it corresponds to a meridian great circle (if continued around the Earth). For all other values it is a spiral from pole to pole on the globe intersecting all meridians at the same angle, and is thus not a great circle. This section discusses only the last of these cases.

If &quot;α&quot; is neither 0 nor then the above figure of the infinitesimal elements shows that the length of an infinitesimal rhumb line on the sphere between latitudes &quot;φ&quot;; and &quot;φ&quot; + &quot;δφ&quot; is &quot;a&quot; sec &quot;α&quot; &quot;δφ&quot;. Since &quot;α&quot; is constant on the rhumb this expression can be integrated to give, for finite rhumb lines on the Earth:
:formula_15

Once again, if Δ&quot;φ&quot; may be read directly from an accurate latitude scale on the map, then the rhumb distance between map points with latitudes &quot;φ&quot;1 and &quot;φ&quot;2 is given by the above. If there is no such scale then the ruler distances between the end points and the equator, &quot;y&quot;1 and &quot;y&quot;2, give the result via an inverse formula:
:formula_16

These formulae give rhumb distances on the sphere which may differ greatly from true distances whose determination requires more sophisticated calculations.

=== Generalization to the ellipsoid ===
When the Earth is modelled by a spheroid (ellipsoid of revolution) the Mercator projection must be modified if it is to remain conformal. The transformation equations and scale factor for the non-secant version are
formula_17

The scale factor is unity on the equator, as it must be since the cylinder is tangential to the ellipsoid at the equator. The ellipsoidal correction of the scale factor increases with latitude but it is never greater than &quot;e&quot;2, a correction of less than 1%. (The value of &quot;e&quot;2 is about 0.006 for all reference ellipsoids.) This is much smaller than the scale inaccuracy, except very close to the equator. Only accurate Mercator projections of regions near the equator will necessitate the ellipsoidal corrections.

The inverse is solved iteratively, as the isometric latitude is involved.

<doc id="20775" wikidata="Q308398" url="?curid=20775" title="Midas">
<text>Midas (; ) was a king of Phrygia with whom many myths became associated, as well as two later members of the Phrygian royal house.

His father was Gordias, and his mother was Cybele. The most famous King Midas is popularly remembered in Greek mythology for his ability to turn everything he touched into pure gold and this came to be called the &quot;golden touch&quot;, or the &quot;Midas touch&quot;. The legends told about this Midas and his adopted father Gordias, credited with founding the Phrygian capital city Gordium and tying the Gordian Knot, indicate that they were believed to have lived sometime in the 2nd millennium BC, well before the Trojan War. However, Homer does not mention Midas or Gordias, while instead mentioning two other Phrygian kings, Mygdon and Otreus.

Midaeum was presumably named after him, and this is probably also the Midas that according to Pausanias founded Ancyra (today known as Ankara).

Another King Midas ruled Phrygia in the late 8th century BC. Most historians believe this Midas is the same person as the &quot;Mita&quot;, called king of the Mushki in Assyrian texts, who warred with Assyria and its Anatolian provinces during the same period. A third Midas is said by Herodotus to have been a member of the royal house of Phrygia in the 6th century BC.

==Mythological Midas==

There are many, and often contradictory, legends about the most ancient King Midas. In one, Midas was king of Pessinus, a city of Phrygia, who as a child was adopted by King Gordias and Cybele, the goddess whose consort he was, and who (by some accounts) was the goddess-mother of Midas himself. Some accounts place the youth of Midas in Macedonian Bermion (see Bryges). In Thracian Mygdonia, Herodotus referred to a wild rose garden at the foot of Mount Bermion as &quot;the garden of Midas son of Gordias, where roses grow of themselves, each bearing sixty blossoms and of surpassing fragrance&quot;. Herodotus says elsewhere that Phrygians lived in ancient Europe, where they were known as Bryges, and the existence of the garden implies that Herodotus believed that Midas lived prior to a Phrygian migration to Anatolia.

According to some accounts, Midas had a son, Lityerses, the demonic reaper of men, but in some variations of the myth he instead had a daughter, Zoë, whose name means &quot;life&quot;. According to other accounts he had a son named Anchurus.

Arrian gives an alternative story of the descent and life of Midas. According to him, Midas was the son of Gordios, a poor peasant, and a Telmissian maiden of the prophetic race. When Midas grew up to be a handsome and valiant man, the Phrygians were harassed by civil discord, and consulting the oracle, they were told that a wagon would bring them a king, who would put an end to their discord. While they were still deliberating, Midas arrived with his father and mother, and stopped near the assembly, wagon and all. They, comparing the oracular response with this occurrence, decided that this was the person whom the god told them the wagon would bring. They therefore appointed Midas king and he, putting an end to their discord, dedicated his father’s wagon in the citadel as a thank-offering to Zeus the king. In addition to this the following saying was current concerning the wagon, that whosoever could loosen the cord of the yoke of this wagon, was destined to gain the rule of Asia. This someone was to be Alexander the Great. In other versions of the legend, it was Midas&#x27; father Gordias who arrived humbly in the cart and made the Gordian Knot.

Herodotus said that a &quot;Midas son of Gordias&quot; made an offering to the Oracle of Delphi of a royal throne &quot;from which he made judgments&quot; that were &quot;well worth seeing&quot;, and that this Midas was the only foreigner to make an offering to Delphi before Gyges of Lydia. The historical Midas of the 8th century BC and Gyges of Lydia are believed to have been contemporaries, so it seems most likely that Herodotus believed that the throne was donated by the earlier, legendary King Midas. However, some historians believe that this throne was donated by the later, historical King Midas, great grandfather of Alyattes of Lydia who was also referred to as Midas after amassing huge wealth from inventing taxable coinage using electrum sourced from Midas&#x27; famed river Pactolus.
=== Golden Touch ===

One day, as Ovid relates in &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; XI, Dionysus found that his old schoolmaster and foster father, the satyr Silenus, was missing. The old satyr had been drinking wine and wandered away drunk, to be found by some Phrygian peasants who carried him to their king, Midas (alternatively, Silenus passed out in Midas&#x27; rose garden). Midas recognized him and treated him hospitably, entertaining him for ten days and nights with politeness, while Silenus delighted Midas and his friends with stories and songs. On the eleventh day, he took Silenus back to Dionysus in Lydia. Dionysus offered Midas his choice of whatever reward he wished for. Midas asked that whatever he might touch should be changed into gold.

Midas rejoiced in his new power, which he hastened to put to the test. He touches an oak twig and a stone; both turned to gold. Overjoyed, as soon as he got home, he touched every rose in the rose garden, and all became gold. He ordered the servants to set a feast on the table. Upon discovering how even the food and drink turned into gold in his hands, he regretted his wish and cursed it. Claudian states in his &quot;In Rufinum&quot;: &quot;So Midas, king of Lydia, swelled at first with pride when he found he could transform everything he touched to gold; but when he beheld his food grow rigid and his drink harden into golden ice then he understood that this gift was a bane and in his loathing for gold, cursed his prayer.&quot;

In a version told by Nathaniel Hawthorne in &quot;A Wonder-Book for Girls and Boys&quot; (1852), Midas&#x27; daughter came to him, upset about the roses that had lost their fragrance and become hard, and when he reached out to comfort her, found that when he touched his daughter, she turned to gold as well. Now, Midas hated the gift he had coveted. He prayed to Dionysus, begging to be delivered from starvation. Dionysus heard his prayer, and consented; telling Midas to wash in the river Pactolus. Then, whatever he put into the water would be reversed of the touch.

Midas did so, and when he touched the waters, the power flowed into the river, and the river sands turned into gold. This explained why the river Pactolus was so rich in gold and electrum, and the wealth of the dynasty of Alyattes of Lydia claiming Midas as its forefather no doubt the impetus for this origin myth. Gold was perhaps not the only metallic source of Midas&#x27; riches: &quot;King Midas, a Phrygian, son of Cybele, first discovered black and white lead&quot;.

However, according to Aristotle, legend held that Midas eventually died of starvation as a result of his &quot;vain prayer&quot; for the gold touch, the curse never being lifted.

=== Ears of a donkey ===
Midas, now hating wealth and splendor, moved to the country and became a worshipper of Pan, the god of the fields and satyrs. Roman mythographers asserted that his tutor in music was Orpheus.

Once, Pan had the audacity to compare his music with that of Apollo, and challenged Apollo to a trial of skill (also see Marsyas). Tmolus, the mountain-god, was chosen as umpire. Pan blew on his pipes and, with his rustic melody, gave great satisfaction to himself and his faithful follower, Midas, who happened to be present. Then Apollo struck the strings of his lyre. Tmolus at once awarded the victory to Apollo, and all but one agreed with the judgment. Midas dissented, and questioned the justice of the award. Apollo would not suffer such a depraved pair of ears any longer, and said &quot;Must have ears of an ass!&quot;, which caused Midas&#x27;s ears to become those of a donkey. The myth is illustrated by two paintings, &quot;Apollo and Marsyas&quot; by Palma il Giovane (1544–1628), one depicting the scene before, and one after, the punishment. Midas was mortified at this mishap. He attempted to hide his misfortune under an ample turban or headdress, but his barber of course knew the secret, so was told not to mention it. However, the barber could not keep the secret. He went out into a meadow, dug a hole in the ground, whispered the story into it, then covered the hole up. A thick bed of reeds later sprang up from the covered up hole, and began whispering the story, saying &quot;King Midas has an ass&#x27;s ears&quot;. Some sources, such as Plutarch, say that Midas committed suicide by drinking bull&#x27;s blood, a powdered crystal substance which was used in the ancient world as pigment for red paint, but very toxic due to its high level of arsenic.

Sarah Morris demonstrated (Morris, 2004) that donkeys&#x27; ears were a Bronze Age royal attribute, borne by King Tarkasnawa (Greek Tarkondemos) of Mira, on a seal inscribed in both Hittite cuneiform and Luwian hieroglyphs. In this connection, the myth would appear for Greeks to justify the exotic attribute.

The stories of the contests with Apollo of Pan and Marsyas were very often confused, so Titian&#x27;s &quot;Flaying of Marsyas&quot; includes a figure of Midas (who may be a self-portrait), though his ears seem normal.

==== Similar myths in other cultures ====
In pre-Islamic legend of Central Asia, the king of the Ossounes of the Yenisei basin had donkey&#x27;s ears. He would hide them, and order each of his barbers murdered to hide his secret. The last barber among his people was counselled to whisper the heavy secret into a well after sundown, but he didn&#x27;t cover the well afterwards. The well water rose and flooded the kingdom, creating the waters of Lake Issyk-Kul.

According to an Irish legend, the king Labraid Loingsech had horse/donkeys&#x27;s ears, something he was concerned to keep quiet. He had his hair cut once a year, and the barber, who was chosen by lot, was immediately put to death. A widow, hearing that her only son had been chosen to cut the king&#x27;s hair, begged the king not to kill him, and he agreed, so long as the barber kept his secret. The burden of the secret was so heavy that the barber fell ill. A druid advised him to go to a crossroads and tell his secret to the first tree he came to, and he would be relieved of his burden and be well again. He told the secret to a large willow. Soon after this, however, a harper named Craiftine broke his instrument, and made a new one out of the very willow the barber had told his secret to. Whenever he played it, the harp sang &quot;Labraid Lorc has horse&#x27;s ears&quot;. Labraid repented of all the barbers he had put to death and admitted his secret.

In Ireland, at Loch Ine, West Cork, there is a similar story told of the inhabitant of its island, who had ass&#x27;s ears. Anyone engaged to cut this King&#x27;s hair was then put to death. But the reeds (in the form of a musical flute) spoke of them and the secret was out.

The myth is also known in Brittany where the king Mark of Cornwall is believed to have ruled the south-western region of Cornouaille. Chasing a white doe, he loses his best horse &quot;Morvarc&#x27;h&quot; (&quot;Seahorse&quot;) when the doe kills it with an arrow thrown by Mark. Trying to kill the doe, he is cursed by Dahut, a magician who lives under the sea. She gives life to Morvarc&#x27;h back but switches his ears and mane with Mark&#x27;s ears and hair. Worried that the word might get out, Mark hides in his castle and kills every barber that comes to cut his hair until his milk brother Yeun is the last barber alive in Cornouaille. He promises to let him live if Yeun keeps the secret and Yeun cuts his hairs with a magical pair of scissors. The secret is too heavy for Yeun though and he goes to a beach to dig a hole and tell his secret in it. When he leaves, three reeds appear. Years later, when Mark&#x27;s sister marries, the musicians are unable to play for the reeds of their bagpipes and bombards have been stolen by korrigans. They find three reeds on the beach and use them to make new ones, but the music instruments, instead of playing music, only sing &quot;The King Mark has the ears and the mane of his horse Morvarc&#x27;h on his head&quot; and Mark departs never to be seen again.

== Midas (8th century BC) ==
Another King Midas ruled Phrygia in the late 8th century BC, up until the sacking of Gordium by the Cimmerians, when he is said to have committed suicide. Most historians believe this Midas is the same person as the &quot;Mita&quot;, called king of the Mushki in Assyrian texts, who warred with Assyria and its Anatolian provinces during the same period.

The King Midas who ruled Phrygia in the late 8th century BC is known from Greek and Assyrian sources. According to the former, he married a Greek princess, Damodice, daughter of Agamemnon of Cyme, and traded extensively with the Greeks. Damodice is credited with inventing coined money by Julius Pollux after she married Midas. Some historians believe this Midas donated the throne that Herodotus says was offered to the Oracle of Delphi by &quot;Midas son of Gordias&quot; (see above). Assyrian tablets from the reign of Sargon II record attacks by a &quot;Mita&quot;, king of the Mushki, against Assyria&#x27;s eastern Anatolian provinces. Some historians believe Assyrian texts called this Midas king of the &quot;Mushki&quot; because he had subjected the eastern Anatolian people of that name and incorporated them into his army. Greek sources including Strabo say that Midas committed suicide by drinking bull&#x27;s blood during an attack by the Cimmerians, which Eusebius dated to around 695 BC and Julius Africanus to around 676 BC. Archeology has confirmed that Gordium was destroyed and burned around that time.

In 1957, Rodney Young and a team from the University of Pennsylvania opened a chamber tomb at the heart of the Great Tumulus (in Greek, Μεγάλη Τούμπα)—53 metres in height, about 300 metres in diameter—on the site of ancient Gordion (modern Yassıhüyük, Turkey), where there are more than 100 tumuli of different sizes and from different periods. They discovered a royal burial, its timbers dated as cut to about 740 BC complete with remains of the funeral feast and &quot;the best collection of Iron Age drinking vessels ever uncovered&quot;. This inner chamber was rather large: 5.15 metres by 6.2 metres in breadth and 3.25 metres high. On the remains of a wooden coffin in the northwest corner of the tomb lay a skeleton of a man 1.59 metres in height and about 60 years old. In the tomb were found an ornate inlaid table, two inlaid serving stands, and eight other tables, as well as bronze and pottery vessels and bronze fibulae. Although no identifying texts were originally associated with the site, it was called Tumulus MM (for &quot;Midas Mound&quot;) by the excavator. As this funerary monument was erected before the traditional date given for the death of King Midas in the early 7th century BC, it is now generally thought to have covered the burial of his father.

== Midas (6th century BC) ==
A third Midas is said by Herodotus to have been a member of the royal house of Phrygia and the grandfather of Adrastus, son of Gordias who fled Phrygia after accidentally killing his brother and took asylum in Lydia during the reign of Croesus. Phrygia was by that time a Lydian subject. Herodotus says that Croesus regarded the Phrygian royal house as &quot;friends&quot; but does not mention whether the Phrygian royal house still ruled as (vassal) kings of Phrygia.

<doc id="20778" wikidata="Q848867" url="?curid=20778" title="Misandry">
<text>Misandry () is the hatred of, contempt for, or prejudice against men or boys.

Men&#x27;s rights activists (MRAs) and other masculinist groups have characterized modern laws concerning divorce, domestic violence, conscription, circumcision (known as male genital mutilation by opponents), and treatment of male rape victims as examples of institutional misandry. However, in virtually all societies, misandry lacks institutional and systemic support comparable to misogyny, the hatred of women.

In the Internet Age, users posting on manosphere internet forums such as 4chan and subreddits addressing men&#x27;s rights activism have claimed that misandry is widespread, established in preferential treatment of women, and shown by discrimination against men.

Many scholars criticize MRAs for promoting a false equivalence between misandry and misogyny, arguing that modern activism around misandry represents an antifeminist backlash, promoted by marginalized men. The false idea that misandry is commonplace among feminists is so widespread that it has been called the &quot;misandry myth&quot; by 40 topic experts.

==Etymology==
Misandry is formed from the Greek ( &#x27;hatred&#x27;) and , (, gen. &#x27;man&#x27;). &quot;Misandrous&quot; or &quot;misandrist&quot; can be used as adjectival forms of the word. Use of the word can be found as far back as the 19th century, including an 1871 use in &quot;The Spectator&quot; magazine. It appeared in &quot;Merriam-Webster&#x27;s Collegiate Dictionary&quot; (11th ed.) in 1952. Translation of the French to the German (Hatred of Men) is recorded in 1803.

A term with a similar but distinct meaning is &quot;androphobia&quot;, which describes a fear, but not necessarily hatred, of men. Anthropologist David D. Gilmore coined the term &quot;viriphobia&quot; in line with his view that misandry typically targets &quot;machismo&quot;, &quot;the obnoxious manly &quot;, along with the oppressive male roles of patriarchy. Gilmore says that misandry is not the hatred of men as men; this kind of loathing is present only in misogyny, which is the hatred of women as women.

==History==
The term &quot;misandry&quot; originated in the late 19th century. According to information policy scholars Alice Marwick and Robyn Caplan, the term was used as a synonym for feminism from its inception, drawing an equivalence between misandry (&#x27;man-hating&#x27;) and misogyny (&#x27;woman-hating&#x27;). Newspapers in the 1890s occasionally referred to feminist &quot;new women&quot; as &quot;man haters&quot;, and a 1928 article in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Monthly&quot; said that misandry &quot;distorts the more querulous of [modern] feminist arguments.&quot; The term re-emerged in men&#x27;s rights literature and academic literature on structural sexism in the 1980s. It was in use on Usenet since at least 1989, and on websites and blogs dedicated to men&#x27;s rights issues in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Marwick and Caplan argue that usage of the term &quot;misandry&quot; in the internet age is an outgrowth of misogyny and antifeminism. The term is commonly used in the manosphere, such as on men&#x27;s rights discussion forums on websites such as 4chan and Reddit, to counter feminist accusations of misogyny. The critique and parody of the concept of misandry by feminist bloggers has been reported on in periodicals such as &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;Slate&quot; and &quot;Time&quot;.

==Overview==
Men&#x27;s rights activists (MRAs) invoke the idea of misandry in warning against what they see as the advance of a female-dominated society. The idea of feminism as threatening towards men, encapsulated in the term &quot;misandry&quot;, forms a core part of the vocabulary of the manosphere and is used within the men&#x27;s rights movement (MRM) to counter feminist accusations of misogyny. The idea of feminism as a misandrist movement has provided justification for harassment of people espousing feminist ideas, one example being the Gamergate harassment campaign against women in the video games industry. 
MRAs and other masculinist groups have criticized modern laws concerning divorce, domestic violence, the draft, circumcision (known as &quot;genital mutilation&quot; by opponents), and treatment of male rape victims as examples of institutional misandry. Other proposed examples include social problems that lead to men&#x27;s shorter lifespans, higher suicide rates, requirements to participate in military drafts, and lack of tax benefits afforded to widowers compared to widows.

Marc A. Ouellette argues in &quot;International Encyclopedia of Men and Masculinities&quot; that &quot;misandry lacks the systemic, transhistoric, institutionalized, and legislated antipathy of misogyny&quot;; in his view, assuming a parallel between misogyny and misandry overly simplifies relations of gender and power.
Anthropologist David Gilmore argues that misogyny is a &quot;near-universal phenomenon&quot; and that there is no male equivalent. He states that misandry is &quot;different from the intensely &quot;ad feminam&quot; aspect of misogyny that targets women no matter what they believe or do&quot;.
Marwick and Caplan have examined the use of the term &quot;misandry&quot; within the manosphere as a weapon against feminist language and ideas. They characterize men&#x27;s rights activists&#x27; use of the termas a gender-reversed counterpart to &quot;misogyny&quot;as an appropriation of leftist identity politics. Marwick and Caplan also argue that coverage of the discourse of misandry by mainstream journalists serves to reinforce the MRM&#x27;s framing of feminist activism as oppressive toward men, along with its denial of institutionalized sexism against women.

== Racialization ==

Misandry can be racialized. According to some researchers in Black male studies such as Tommy J. Curry, Black men and boys face anti-Black misandry. E. C. Krell, a gender researcher, uses the term racialized transmisandry describing the experience of Black transmasculine people.

==Psychological studies==
Glick and Fiske developed psychometric constructs to measure the attitudes of individuals towards men in their &quot;Ambivalence toward Men Inventory, AMI&quot;, which includes a factor &quot;Hostility toward Men.&quot; These metrics were based on a small group discussion with women which identified factors, these number of questions were then reduced using statistical methods. &quot;Hostility toward Men&quot; was split into three factors: &quot;Resentment of Paternalism&quot;, the belief men supported male power; &quot;Compensatory Gender Differentiation&quot;, the belief that men were supported by women; and &quot;Heterosexual Hostility&quot;, which looked at beliefs that men were likely to engage in hostile actions. The combined construct, Hostility toward Men, was found to be inversely correlated with measures of gender equality when comparing difference countries and in a study with university students, self-describing feminists were found to have a lower score.

== Criminal justice system ==
In the United States, men tend to receive longer sentences than women for committing the same crimes, although the disparity is more pronounced for minor offenses, and is also dependent on the race of the perpetrator. Criminologist Nathan A. Kruis of Pennsylvania State University and colleagues write that a body of research suggests the presence of &quot;potential institutional misandry&quot; in the U.S. criminal justice system.

==In literature==
===Ancient Greek literature===

Classicist Froma Zeitlin writes:
=== Shakespeare ===

Literary critic Harold Bloom argued that even though the word misandry is relatively unheard of in literature, it is not hard to find implicit, even explicit, misandry. In reference to the works of Shakespeare, Bloom argued: 

=== Modern literature ===

Sociologist Anthony Synnott argues that there is a tendency in literature to represent men as villains and women as victims and argues that there is a market for &quot;anti-male&quot; novels with no corresponding &quot;anti-female&quot; market, citing &quot;The Women&#x27;s Room&quot;, by Marilyn French, and &quot;The Color Purple&quot;, by Alice Walker. He gives examples of comparisons of men to Nazi prison guards as a common theme in literature.

Racialized misandry occurs in both &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; culture and literature. For instance, African-American men have often been disparagingly portrayed as either infantile or as eroticized and hyper-masculine, depending on prevailing cultural stereotypes.

Julie M. Thompson, a feminist author, connects misandry with envy of men, in particular &quot;penis envy&quot;, a term coined by Sigmund Freud in 1908, in his theory of female sexual development. Nancy Kang has discussed &quot;the misandric impulse&quot; in relation to the works of Toni Morrison.

In his book, &quot;Gender and Judaism: The Transformation of Tradition&quot;, Harry Brod, a Professor of Philosophy and Humanities in the Department of Philosophy and Religion at the University of Northern Iowa, writes:

In 2020, the explicitly misandric essay &quot;Moi les hommes, je les déteste&quot; (&quot;I Hate Men&quot;) by the French writer Pauline Harmange caused controversy in France after a government official threatened its publisher with criminal prosecution.

==In feminism==
Opponents of feminism often argue that feminism is misandrist; citing examples such as opposition to shared parenting by NOW, or opposition to equal rape and domestic violence laws. The validity of these perceptions and of the concept has been claimed as promoting a false equivalence between misandry and misogyny. Radical feminism has often been associated with misandry in the public consciousness. However, radical feminist arguments have also been misinterpreted, and individual radical feminists such as Valerie Solanas, best known for her attempted assassination of artist Andy Warhol in 1968, have historically had a higher profile in popular culture than within feminist scholarship.

Historian Alice Echols argues that the misandry displayed by Solanas in her tract the &quot;SCUM Manifesto&quot; was not typical for radical feminists of the time: &quot;Solanas&#x27;s unabashed misandry—especially her belief in men&#x27;s biological inferiority—her endorsement of relationships between &#x27;independent women,&#x27; and her dismissal of sex as &#x27;the refuge of the mindless&#x27; contravened the sort of radical feminism which prevailed in most women&#x27;s groups across the country.&quot;
Radical feminist Andrea Dworkin criticized what she called a biological determinist strand that she found &quot;with increasing frequency in feminist circles&quot;; according to Dworkin, this included the view that males are biologically inferior to women and violent by nature, requiring a gendercide to allow for the emergence of a &quot;new &quot;Übermensch&quot; Womon&quot;.

Melinda Kanner and Kristin J. Anderson argue that &quot;man-hater feminist&quot; represents the popular antifeminist myth which has no any scientific evidences, and it&#x27;s rather the antifeminists who perhaps hate men.

The feminist author bell hooks writes that the contemporary feminist movement was from its beginnings portrayed in the mass media as man-hating, even though anti-male factions were a small minority of women&#x27;s liberation advocates. Hooks argues that liberal feminists&#x27; demonization of men as all-powerful misogynist oppressors was a product of bourgeois white women&#x27;s envy of the privileges held by upper-class white men, and that such anti-male sentiments &quot;alienated many poor and working class women, particularly non-white women&quot; from the movement. She writes that anti-male factions received outsized attention from the mass media, leading the men&#x27;s movement to take an anti-female stance which &quot;mirrored the most negative aspects&quot; of the women&#x27;s movement.

Sociologist Anthony Synnott argues that certain forms of feminism present misandristic view of gender. He argues that men are presented as having power over others regardless of the actual power they possess and that some feminists define the experience of being male inaccurately through writing on masculinity. He further argues that some forms of feminism create an in-group of women, simplifies the nuances of gender issues, demonizes those who are not feminists and legimitizes victimization by way of retributive justice.
Reviewing Synnott, Roman Kuhar argues that Synnott might not accurately represent the views of feminism, commenting that &quot;whether it re-thinks men in a manner in which men have not been thought of in feminist theory, is another question.&quot;

Sociologist Allan G. Johnson argues in &quot;The Gender Knot: Unraveling our Patriarchal Legacy&quot; that accusations of man-hating have been used to put down feminists and to shift attention onto men, reinforcing a male-centered culture. Johnson posits that culture offers no comparable anti-male ideology to misogyny and that &quot;people often confuse men as individuals with men as a dominant and privileged category of people. Given the reality of women&#x27;s oppression, male privilege, and men&#x27;s enforcement of both, it&#x27;s hardly surprising that woman should have moments where she resents or even hates &#x27;men. [emphasis in original]

A meta-analysis in 2023 published in the journal Psychology of Women Quarterly investigated the stereotype of feminists&#x27; attitudes to men and concluded that feminist views of men were no different than that of non-feminists or men towards men, and titled the phenomenon the : &quot;We term the focal stereotype the misandry myth in light of the evidence that it is false and widespread, and discuss its implications for the movement.&quot;

<doc id="20781" wikidata="Q1945005" url="?curid=20781" title="Monoid ring">
<text>In abstract algebra, a monoid ring is a ring constructed from a ring and a monoid, just as a group ring is constructed from a ring and a group.

==Definition==
Let &quot;R&quot; be a ring and let &quot;G&quot; be a monoid. The monoid ring or monoid algebra of &quot;G&quot; over &quot;R&quot;, denoted &quot;R&quot;[&quot;G&quot;] or &quot;RG&quot;, is the set of formal sums formula_1,
where formula_2 for each formula_3 and &quot;r&quot;&quot;g&quot; = 0 for all but finitely many &quot;g&quot;, equipped with coefficient-wise addition, and the multiplication in which the elements of &quot;R&quot; commute with the elements of &quot;G&quot;. More formally, &quot;R&quot;[&quot;G&quot;] is the free &quot;R&quot;-module on the set &quot;G&quot;, endowed with &quot;R&quot;-linear multiplication defined on the base elements by &quot;g·h&quot; := &quot;gh&quot;, where the left-hand side is understood as the multiplication in &quot;R&quot;[&quot;G&quot;] and the right-hand side is understood in &quot;G&quot;.

Alternatively, one can identify the element formula_4 with the function &quot;eg&quot; that maps &quot;g&quot; to 1 and every other element of &quot;G&quot; to 0. This way, &quot;R&quot;[&quot;G&quot;] is identified with the set of functions such that } is finite. equipped with addition of functions, and with multiplication defined by
:formula_5.
If &quot;G&quot; is a group, then &quot;R&quot;[&quot;G&quot;] is also called the group ring of &quot;G&quot; over &quot;R&quot;.

==Universal property==
Given &quot;R&quot; and &quot;G&quot;, there is a ring homomorphism sending each &quot;r&quot; to &quot;r&quot;1 (where 1 is the identity element of &quot;G&quot;),
and a monoid homomorphism (where the latter is viewed as a monoid under multiplication) sending each &quot;g&quot; to 1&quot;g&quot; (where 1 is the multiplicative identity of &quot;R&quot;).
We have that α(&quot;r&quot;) commutes with β(&quot;g&quot;) for all &quot;r&quot; in &quot;R&quot; and &quot;g&quot; in &quot;G&quot;.

The universal property of the monoid ring states that given a ring &quot;S&quot;, a ring homomorphism , and a monoid homomorphism to the multiplicative monoid of &quot;S&quot;,
such that α&#x27;(&quot;r&quot;) commutes with β&#x27;(&quot;g&quot;) for all &quot;r&quot; in &quot;R&quot; and &quot;g&quot; in &quot;G&quot;, there is a unique ring homomorphism such that composing α and β with γ produces α&#x27; and β

==Augmentation==

The augmentation is the ring homomorphism defined by 
: formula_6

The kernel of &quot;η&quot; is called the augmentation ideal. It is a free &quot;R&quot;-module with basis consisting of 1 – &quot;g&quot; for all &quot;g&quot; in &quot;G&quot; not equal to 1.

== Examples ==

Given a ring &quot;R&quot; and the (additive) monoid of natural numbers N (or {&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;} viewed multiplicatively), we obtain the ring &quot;R&quot;[{&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;}] =: &quot;R&quot;[&quot;x&quot;] of polynomials over &quot;R&quot;.
The monoid N&quot;n&quot; (with the addition) gives the polynomial ring with &quot;n&quot; variables: &quot;R&quot;[N&quot;n&quot;] =: &quot;R&quot;[&quot;X&quot;1, ..., &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;].

==Generalization==
If &quot;G&quot; is a semigroup, the same construction yields a semigroup ring &quot;R&quot;[&quot;G&quot;].

<text>The magic lantern, also known by its Latin name , was an early type of image projector that used pictures—paintings, prints, or photographs—on transparent plates (usually made of glass), one or more lenses, and a light source. Because a single lens inverts an image projected through it (as in the phenomenon which inverts the image of a camera obscura), slides were inserted upside down in the magic lantern, rendering the projected image correctly oriented.

It was mostly developed in the 17th century and commonly used for entertainment purposes. It was increasingly used for education during the 19th century. Since the late 19th century, smaller versions were also mass-produced as toys. The magic lantern was in wide use from the 18th century until the mid-20th century when it was superseded by a compact version that could hold many 35 mm photographic slides: the slide projector.

==Technology==
===Apparatus===
The magic lantern used a concave mirror behind a light source to direct the light through a small rectangular sheet of glass—a &quot;lantern slide&quot; that bore the image—and onward into a lens at the front of the apparatus. The lens adjusted to focus the plane of the slide at the distance of the projection screen, which could be simply a white wall, and it therefore formed an enlarged image of the slide on the screen. Some lanterns, including those of Christiaan Huygens and Jan van Musschenbroek, used three lenses for the objective.

Biunial lanterns, with two objectives, became common during the 19th century and enabled a smooth and easy change of pictures. Stereopticons added more powerful light sources to optimize the projection of photographic slides.

===Slides===
Originally the pictures were hand painted on glass slides. Initially, figures were rendered with black paint but soon transparent colors were also used. Sometimes the painting was done on oiled paper. Usually black paint was used as a background to block superfluous light, so the figures could be projected without distracting borders or frames. Many slides were finished with a layer of transparent lacquer, but in a later period cover glasses were also used to protect the painted layer. Most handmade slides were mounted in wood frames with a round or square opening for the picture.
After 1820 the manufacturing of hand colored printed slides started, often making use of decalcomania transfers. Many manufactured slides were produced on strips of glass with several pictures on them and rimmed with a strip of glued paper.

The first photographic lantern slides, called &quot;hyalotypes&quot;, were invented by the German-born brothers Ernst Wilhelm (William) and Friedrich (Frederick) Langenheim in 1848 in Philadelphia and patented in 1850.

===Light sources===
Apart from sunlight, the only light sources available at the time of invention in the 17th century were candles and oil lamps, which were very inefficient and produced very dim projected images. The invention of the Argand lamp in the 1790s helped to make the images brighter. The invention of limelight in the 1820s made them even brighter, emitting about 6000-8000 lumens. The invention of the intensely bright electric arc lamp in the 1860s eliminated the need for combustible gases or hazardous chemicals, and eventually the incandescent electric lamp further improved safety and convenience, although not brightness.

==Precursors==

Several types of projection systems existed before the invention of the magic lantern. Giovanni Fontana, Leonardo da Vinci and Cornelis Drebbel described or drew image projectors that had similarities to the magic lantern. In the 17th century, there was an immense interest in optics. The telescope and microscope were invented and apart from being useful to some scientists, such instruments were especially popular as entertaining curiosities to people who could afford them. The magic lantern would prove a natural successor.

===Camera obscura===
The magic lantern can be seen as a further development of camera obscura. This is a natural phenomenon that occurs when an image of a scene at the other side of a screen (for instance a wall) is projected through a small hole in that screen as an inverted image (left to right and upside down) on a surface opposite to the opening. It was known at least since the 5th century BC and experimented with in darkened rooms at least since . The use of a lens in the hole has been traced back to . The portable camera obscura box with a lens was developed in the 17th century. Dutch inventor Cornelis Drebbel is thought to have sold one to Dutch poet, composer and diplomat Constantijn Huygens in 1622, while the oldest known clear description of a box-type camera is in German Jesuit scientist Gaspar Schott&#x27;s 1657 book &quot;Magia universalis naturæ et artis&quot;.

===Steganographic mirror===

The 1645 first edition of German Jesuit scholar Athanasius Kircher&#x27;s book &quot;Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae&quot; included a description of his invention, the &quot;Steganographic Mirror&quot;: a primitive projection system with a focusing lens and text or pictures painted on a concave mirror reflecting sunlight, mostly intended for long-distance communication. He saw limitations in the increase of size and diminished clarity over a long distance and expressed his hope that someone would find a method to improve on this.

In 1654, Belgian Jesuit mathematician André Tacquet used Kircher&#x27;s technique to show the journey from China to Belgium of Italian Jesuit missionary Martino Martini. Some reports say that Martini lectured throughout Europe with a magic lantern, which he might have imported from China, but there&#x27;s no evidence that it used anything other than Kircher&#x27;s technique. However, Tacquet was a correspondent and friend of Christiaan Huygens and may thus have been a very early adapter of the magic lantern technique that Huygens developed around this period.

==Invention==
===Christiaan Huygens===

Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens is considered as one of the possible inventors of the magic lantern. He knew Athanasius Kircher&#x27;s 1645 edition of &quot;Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae&quot; which described a primitive projection system with a focusing lens and text or pictures painted on a concave mirror reflecting sunlight. Christiaan&#x27;s father Constantijn had been acquainted with Cornelis Drebbel who used some unidentified optical techniques to transform himself and to summon appearances in magical performances. Constantijn Huygens wrote about a camera obscura device that he got from Drebbel in 1622.

The oldest known document concerning the magic lantern is a page on which Christiaan Huygens made ten small sketches of a skeleton taking off its skull, above which he wrote &quot;for representations by means of convex glasses with the lamp&quot; (translated from French). As this page was found between documents dated in 1659, it is believed to have been made in the same year. Huygens soon seemed to regret this invention, as he thought it was too frivolous. In a 1662 letter to his brother Lodewijk he claimed he thought of it as some old &quot;bagatelle&quot; and seemed convinced that it would harm the family&#x27;s reputation if people found out the lantern came from him. Christiaan had reluctantly sent a lantern to their father, but when he realized that Constantijn intended to show the lantern to the court of King Louis XIV of France at the Louvre, Christiaan asked Lodewijk to sabotage the lantern.

Christiaan initially referred to the magic lantern as &quot;la lampe&quot; and &quot;la lanterne&quot;, but in the last years of his life he used the then common term &quot;laterna magica&quot; in some notes. In 1694, he drew the principle of a &quot;laterna magica&quot; with two lenses.

===Walgensten, the Dane===

 (–1681), a mathematician from Gotland, studied at the university of Leiden in 1657–58. He possibly met Christiaan Huygens during this time (and/or on several other occasions) and may have learned about the magic lantern from him. Correspondence between them is known from 1667. At least from 1664 until 1670, Walgensten demonstrated the magic lantern in Paris (1664), Lyon (1665), Rome (1665–1666), and Copenhagen (1670). He &quot;sold such lanterns to different Italian princes in such an amount that they now are almost everyday items in Rome&quot;, according to Athanasius Kircher in 1671. In 1670, Walgensten projected an image of Death at the court of King Frederick III of Denmark. This scared some courtiers, but the king dismissed their cowardice and requested to repeat the figure three times. The king died a few days later. After Walgensten died, his widow sold his lanterns to the , but they have not been preserved. Walgensten is credited with coining the term &quot;Laterna Magica&quot;, assuming he communicated this name to Claude Dechales who, in 1674, published about seeing the machine of the &quot;erudite Dane&quot; in 1665 in Lyon.

===Possible German origins: Wiesel and Griendel===

There are many gaps and uncertainties in the magic lantern&#x27;s recorded history. A separate early magic lantern tradition seems to have been developed in southern Germany and includes lanterns with horizontal cylindrical bodies, while Walgensten&#x27;s lantern and probably Huygens&#x27; both had vertical bodies. This tradition dates at least to 1671, with the arrival of instrument maker Johann Franz Griendel in the city of Nürnberg, which Johann Zahn identified as one of the centers of magic lantern production in 1686. Griendel was indicated as the inventor of the magic lantern by Johann Christoph Kohlhans in a 1677 publication. It has been suggested that this tradition is older and that instrument maker Johann Wiesel (1583–1662) from Augsburg may have been making magic lanterns earlier on and possibly inspired Griendel and even Huygens. Huygens is known to have studied samples of Wiesel&#x27;s lens-making and instruments since 1653. Wiesel did make a ship&#x27;s lantern around 1640 that has much in common with the magic lantern design that Griendel would later apply: a horizontal cylindrical body with a rosette chimney on top, a concave mirror behind a fixture for a candle or lamp inside and a biconvex lens at the front. There is no evidence that Wiesel actually ever made a magic lantern, but in 1674, his successor offered a variety of magic lanterns from the same workshop. This successor is thought to have only continued producing Wiesel&#x27;s designs after his death in 1662, without adding anything new.

==Further history==
===Early adopters===
Before 1671, only a small circle of people seemed to have knowledge of the magic lantern, and almost every known report of the device from this period had to do with people that were more or less directly connected to Christiaan Huygens. Despite the rejection expressed in his letters to his brother, Huygens must have familiarized several people with the lantern.

In 1664 Parisian engineer Pierre Petit wrote to Huygens to ask for some specifications of the lantern, because he was trying to construct one after seeing the lantern of &quot;the dane&quot; (probably Walgensten). The lantern that Petit was constructing had a concave mirror behind the lamp. This directed more light through the lens, resulting in a brighter projection, and it would become a standard part of most of the lanterns that were made later. Petit may have copied it from Walgensten, but he expressed that he made a lamp stronger than any he had ever seen.

Starting in 1661, Huygens corresponded with London optical instrument-maker Richard Reeve. Reeve was soon selling magic lanterns, demonstrated one in his shop on 17 May 1663 to Balthasar de Monconys, and sold one to Samuel Pepys in August 1666.

One of Christiaan Huygens&#x27; contacts imagined how Athanasius Kircher would use the magic lantern: &quot;If he would know about the invention of the Lantern he would surely frighten the cardinals with specters.&quot; Kircher would eventually learn about the existence of the magic lantern via Thomas Walgensten and introduced it as &quot;Lucerna Magica&quot; in the widespread 1671 second edition of his book &quot;Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae&quot;. Kircher claimed that Thomas Walgensten reworked his ideas from the previous edition of this book into a better lantern. Kircher described this improved lantern, but it was illustrated in a confusing manner: the pictures seem technically incorrect—with both the projected image and the transparencies (H) shown upright (while the text states that they should be inverted), the hollow mirror is too high in one picture and absent in the other, and the lens (I) is at the wrong side of the slide. However, experiments with a construction as illustrated in Kircher&#x27;s book proved that it could work as a point light-source projection system.
The projected image in one of the illustrations shows a person in purgatory or hellfire and the other depicts Death with a scythe and an hourglass. According to legend Kircher secretly used the lantern at night to project the image of Death on windows of apostates to scare them back into church. Kircher did suggest in his book that an audience would be more astonished by the sudden appearance of images if the lantern would be hidden in a separate room, so the audience would be ignorant of the cause of their appearance.

===Educational use and other subjects===

The earliest reports and illustrations of lantern projections suggest that they were all intended to scare the audience. Pierre Petit called the apparatus &quot;lanterne de peur&quot; (lantern of fear) in his 1664 letter to Huygens. Surviving lantern plates and descriptions from the next decades prove that the new medium was not just used for horror shows, but that many kinds of subjects were projected. Griendel didn&#x27;t mention scary pictures when he described the magic lantern to Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in December 1671: &quot;An optical lantern which presents everything that one desires, figures, paintings, portraits, faces, hunts, even an entire comedy with all its lively colours.&quot; In 1675, Leibniz saw an important role for the magic lantern in his plan for a kind of world exhibition with projections of &quot;attempts at flight, artistic meteors, optical effects, representations of the sky with the star and comets, and a model of the earth (...), fireworks, water fountains, and ships in rare forms; then mandrakes and other rare plants and exotic animals.&quot; In 1685–1686, Johannes Zahn was an early advocate for use of the device for educational purposes: detailed anatomical illustrations were difficult to draw on a chalkboard, but could easily be copied onto glass or mica.
By the 1730s the use of magic lanterns started to become more widespread when travelling showmen, conjurers and storytellers added them to their repertoire. The travelling lanternists were often called Savoyards (they supposedly came from the Savoy region in France) and became a common sight in many European cities.

In France in the 1770s François Dominique Séraphin used magic lanterns to perform his &quot;Ombres Chinoises&quot; (Chinese shadows), a form of shadow play.

Magic lanterns had also become a staple of science lecturing and museum events since Scottish lecturer Henry Moyes&#x27;s tour of America in 1785–86, when he recommended that all college laboratories procure one. French writer and educator Stéphanie Félicité, comtesse de Genlis popularized the use of magic lanterns as an educational tool in the late 18th century when using projected images of plants to teach botany. Her educational methods were published in America in English translation during the early 1820s.
A type of lantern was constructed by Moses Holden between 1814 and 1815 for illustrating his astronomical lectures.

===Mass slide production===
In 1821, Philip Carpenter&#x27;s London company, which became Carpenter and Westley after his death, started manufacturing a sturdy but lightweight and transportable &quot;Phantasmagoria lantern&quot; with an Argand style lamp. It produced high quality projections and was suitable for classrooms. Carpenter also developed a &quot;secret&quot; copper plate printing/burning process to mass-produce glass lantern slides with printed outlines, which were then easily and quickly hand painted ready for sale. These &quot;copper-plate sliders&quot; contained three or four very detailed 4&quot; circular images mounted in thin hardwood frames. The first known set &quot;The Elements of Zoology&quot; became available in 1823, with over 200 images in 56 frames of zoological figures, classified according to the system of the Swedish scientist Carl Linnaeus. The same year many other slides appeared in the company&#x27;s catalogue: &quot;The Kings and Queens of England&quot; (9 sliders taken from David Hume&#x27;s History of England), &quot;Astronomical Diagrams and Constellations&quot; (9 sliders taken from Friedrich Wilhelm Herschel&#x27;s textbooks), &quot;Views and Buildings&quot;, Ancient and Modern Costume (62 sliders from various sources). Fifteen sliders of the category &quot;Humorous&quot; provided some entertainment, but the focus on education was obvious and very successful.

Through the mid-19th century, the market for magic lanterns was concentrated in Europe with production focused primarily on Italy, France, and England. In 1848, a New York optician began advertising imported slides and locally produced magic lanterns. By 1860, however, mass production began to make magic lanterns more widely available and affordable, with much of the production in the latter half of the 19th century concentrated in Germany. These smaller lanterns had smaller glass sliders, which instead of wooden frames usually had colorful strips of paper glued around their edges with the images printed directly on the glass.

===Waning popularity===
The popularity of magic lanterns waned after the introduction of movies in the 1890s, but they remained a common medium until slide projectors became widespread during the 1950s.

==Moving images==

The magic lantern was not only a direct ancestor of the motion picture projector as a means for visual storytelling, but it could itself be used to project moving images. Some suggestion of movement could be achieved by alternating between pictures of different phases of a motion, but most magic lantern &quot;animations&quot; used two glass slides projected together — one with the stationary part of the picture and the other with the part that could be set in motion by hand or by a simple mechanism.

Motion in animated slides was mostly limited to either two phases of a movement or transformation, or a more gradual singular movement (e.g., a train passing through a landscape). These limitations made subjects with repetitive movements popular, like the sails on a windmill turning around or children on a seesaw. Movements could be repeated over and over and could be performed at different speeds. A common technique that is comparable to the effect of a panning camera makes use of a long slide that is simply pulled slowly through the lantern and usually shows a landscape, sometimes with several phases of a story within the continuous backdrop.

Movement of projected images was also possible by moving the magic lantern itself. This became a staple technique in phantasmagoria shows in the late 18th century, often with the lantern sliding on rails or riding on small wheels and hidden from the view of the audience behind the projection screen.

===History===
In 1645, Kircher had already suggested projecting live insects and shadow puppets from the surface of the mirror in his Steganographic system to perform dramatic scenes.

Christiaan Huygens&#x27; 1659 sketches (see above) suggest he intended to animate the skeleton to have it take off its head and place it back on its neck. This can be seen as an indication that the very first magic lantern demonstrations may already have included projections of simple animations.

In 1668, Robert Hooke wrote about the effects of a type of magic lantern installation: &quot;Spectators not well versed in optics, that should see the various apparitions and disappearances, the motions, changes and actions that may this way be represented, would readily believe them to be supernatural and miraculous.&quot; In the same year, Francesco Eschinardi published &quot;Centuriae opticae pars altera seu dialogi optici pars tertia&quot;, which included a detailed description of the construction of the magic lantern.

In 1675, German polymath and philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz proposed a kind of world exhibition that would show all types of new inventions and spectacles. In a handwritten document he supposed it should open and close with magic lantern shows, including subjects &quot;which can be dismembered, to represent quite extraordinary and grotesque movements, which men would not be capable of making&quot; (translated from French).

Several reports of early magic lantern screenings possibly described moving pictures, but are not clear enough to conclude whether the viewers saw animated slides or motion depicted in still images.

In 1698, German engraver and publisher Johann Christoph Weigel described several lantern slides with mechanisms that made glass parts move over one fixed glass slide, for instance by the means of a silk thread, or grooves in which the mobile part slides.

By 1709 a German optician and glass grinder named Themme (or Temme) made moving lantern slides, including a carriage with rotating wheels, a cupid with a spinning wheel, a shooting gun, and falling bombs. Wheels were cut from the glass plate with a diamond and rotated by a thread that was spun around small brass wheels attached to the glass wheels. A paper slip mask would be quickly pulled away to reveal the red fiery discharge and the bullet from a shooting gun. Zacharias Conrad von Uffenbach visited Themme&#x27;s shop and liked the effects, but was disappointed about the very simple mechanisms. Nonetheless, he bought seven moving slides, as well as twelve slides with four pictures each, which he thought were delicately painted.

Several types of mechanical slides were described and illustrated in Dutch professor of mathematics, physics, philosophy, medicine, and astronomy Pieter van Musschenbroek&#x27;s second edition (1739) of &quot;Beginsels Der Natuurkunde&quot; (see illustration below). Pieter was the brother of Jan van Musschenbroek, the maker of an outstanding magic lantern with excellent lenses and a diaphragm (see illustration above).

In 1770, Edmé-Gilles Guyot described a method of using two slides for the depiction of a storm at sea, with waves on one slide and ships and a few clouds on another. Lanternists could project the illusion of mild waves turning into a wild sea tossing the ships around by increasing the movement of the separate slides. Guyot also detailed how projection on smoke could be used to create the illusion of ghosts hovering in the air, which would become a technique commonly used in phantasmagoria.

An especially intricate multiple rackwork mechanism was developed to show the movements of the planets (sometimes accompanied by revolving satellites) revolving around the Sun. In 1795, one M. Dicas offered an early magic lantern system, the Lucernal or Portable Eidouranian, that showed the orbiting planets. From around the 1820s mechanical astronomical slides became quite common.

===Various types of mechanical slides===
Various types of mechanisms were commonly used to add movement to the projected image:
*slipping slides: a movable glass plate with one or more figures (or any part of a picture for which movement was desired) was slipped over a stationary one, directly by hand or with a small drawbar (see: Fig. 7 on the illustration by Petrus van Musschenbroek: a tightrope walker sliding across the rope). A common example showed a creature that could move the pupils in its eyes, as if looking in all directions. A long piece of glass could show a procession of figures, or a train with several wagons. Quite convincing illusions of moving waves on a sea or lake have also been achieved with this method.
*slipping slides with masking: black paint on portions of the moving plate would mask parts of the underlying image — with a black background — on the stationary glass. This made it possible to hide and then reveal the previous position of a part, for instance a limb, to suggest repetitious movement. The suggested movement would be rather jerky and usually operated quickly. Masking in slides was also often used to create change rather than movement (see: Fig. 6 on the illustration by Petrus van Musschenbroek: a man, his wig and his hat): for instance a person&#x27;s head could be replaced with that of an animal. More gradual and natural movement was also possible; for instance to make a nose grow very long by slowly moving a masking glass.
*lever slides: the moving part was operated by a lever. These could show a more natural movement than slipping slides and were mostly used for repetitive movements, for instance a woodcutter raising and lowering his axe, or a girl on a swing. (see: Fig. 5 on the illustration by Petrus van Musschenbroek: a drinking man raising and lowering his glass + Fig. 8: a lady curtsying)
*pulley slides: a pulley rotates the moving part and could for instance be used to turn the sails on a windmill (see: fig. 4 on illustration by Van Musschenbroek)
*rack and pinion slides: turning the handle of a rackwork would rotate or lift the moving part and could for instance be used to turn the sails on a windmill or for having a hot air balloon take off and descend. A more complex astronomical rackwork slide showed the planets and their satellites orbiting around the sun.
*fantoccini slides: jointed figures set in motion by levers, thin rods, or cams and worm wheels. A popular version had a somersaulting monkey with arms attached to mechanism that made it tumble with dangling feet. Named after the Italian word for animated puppets, like marionettes or jumping jacks. Two different British patents for slides with moving jointed figures were granted in 1891.
*a snow effect slide can add snow to another slide (preferably of a winter scene) by moving a flexible loop of material pierced with tiny holes in front of one of the lenses of a double or triple lantern.

Mechanical slides with abstract special effects include:

*the Chromatrope: a slide that produces dazzling colorful geometrical patterns by rotating two painted glass discs in opposite directions, originally with a double pulley mechanism but later usually with a rackwork mechanism. It was possibly invented around 1844 by English glass painter and showman Henry Langdon Childe and soon added as a novelty to the program of the Royal Polytechnic Institution.
*the Astrometeoroscope or Astrometroscope: a large slide that projected a lacework of dots forming constantly changing geometrical line patterns, compared with stars and meteors. It was invented in or before 1858 by the Hungarian engineer S. Pilcher and used a very ingenious mechanism with two metal plates obliquely crossed with slits that moved to and fro in contrary directions. Except for when the only known example was used in a performance, it was kept locked away at the Polytechnic so no one could discover the secret technique. When the Polytechnic auctioned the device, Picher eventually paid an extravagant price for his own invention to keep its workings secret.
*the Eidotrope: counter-rotating discs of perforated metal or card (or wire gauze or lace), producing swirling Moiré patterns of bright white dots. It was invented by English scientist Charles Wheatstone in 1866.
*the Kaleidotrope: a slide with a single perforated metal or cardboard disc suspended on a spiral spring. The holes can be tinted with colored pieces of gelatin. When struck the disc&#x27;s vibration and rotation sends the colored dots of light swirling around in all sorts of shapes and patterns. The device was demonstrated at the Royal Polytechnic Institution around 1870 and dubbed &quot;Kaleidotrope&quot; when commercial versions were marketed.
*the Cycloidotrope (circa 1865): a slide with an adjustable stylus bar for drawing geometric patterns on sooty glass when hand cranked during projection. The patterns are similar to that produced with a Spirograph.
*a Newton colour wheel slide that, when spinning fast enough, blends seven colours into a white circle

===Dissolving views===
The effect of a gradual transition from one image to another, known as a dissolve in modern filmmaking, became the basis of a popular type of magic lantern show in England in the 19th century. Typical dissolving views showed landscapes dissolving from day to night or from summer to winter. This was achieved by aligning the projection of two matching images and slowly diminishing the first image while introducing the second image. The subject and the effect of magic lantern dissolving views is similar to the popular Diorama theatre paintings that originated in Paris in 1822. 19th century magic lantern broadsides often used the terms &quot;dissolving view&quot;, &quot;dioramic view&quot;, or simply &quot;diorama&quot; interchangeably.

The effect was reportedly invented by phantasmagoria pioneer Paul de Philipsthal while in Ireland in 1803 or 1804. He thought of using two lanterns to make the spirit of Samuel appear out of a mist in his representation of the Witch of Endor. While working out the desired effect, he got the idea of using the technique with landscapes. An 1812 newspaper about a London performance indicates that De Philipsthal presented what was possibly a relatively early incarnation of a dissolving views show, describing it as &quot;a series of landscapes (in imitation of moonlight), which insensibly change to various scenes producing a very magical effect.&quot;

Another possible inventor is Henry Langdon Childe, who purportedly once worked for De Philipsthal. He is said to have invented the dissolving views in 1807, and to have improved and completed the technique in 1818. The oldest known use of the term &quot;dissolving views&quot; occurs on playbills for Childe&#x27;s shows at the Adelphi Theatre in London in 1837. Childe further popularized the dissolving views at the Royal Polytechnic Institution in the early 1840s.

Despite later reports about the early invention, and apart from De Philipsthal&#x27;s 1812 performance, no reports of dissolving view shows before the 1820s are known. Some cases may involve confusion with the Diorama or similar media. In 1826, Scottish magician and ventriloquist M. Henry introduced what he described as &quot;beautiful dissolvent scenes&quot;, &quot;imperceptibly changing views&quot;, &quot;dissolvent views&quot;, and &quot;Magic Views&quot;—created &quot;by Machinery invented by M. Henry.&quot; In 1827, Henry Langdon Childe presented &quot;Scenic Views, showing the various effects of light and shade,&quot; with a series of subjects that became classics for the dissolving views. In December 1827, De Philipsthal returned with a show that included &quot;various splendid views (...) transforming themselves imperceptibly (as if it were by Magic) from one form into another.&quot;

Biunial lanterns, with two projecting optical sets in one apparatus, were produced to more easily project dissolving views. Possibly the first horizontal biunial lantern, dubbed the &quot;Biscenascope&quot; was made by the optician Mr. Clarke and presented at the Royal Adelaide Gallery in London on 5 December 1840. The earliest known illustration of a vertical biunial lantern, probably provided by E.G. Wood, appeared in the Horne &amp; Thornthwaite catalogue in 1857. Later on triple lanterns enabled additional effects, for instance the effect of snow falling while a green landscape dissolves into a snowy winter version.

A mechanical device could be fitted on the magic lantern, which locked up a diaphragm on the first slide slowly whilst a diaphragm on a second slide opened simultaneously.

Philip Carpenter&#x27;s copper-plate printing process, introduced in 1823, may have made it much easier to create duplicate slides with printed outlines that could then be colored differently to create dissolving view slides. However, all early dissolving view slides seem to have been hand-painted.

===Experiments===
There have been many different experiments involving sorts of movement with the magic lantern. These include:
*galvanometer slide: a flattened coil with a magnetized needle moving from side to side when a battery is connected.
*projection of moving frog legs, with the nerves and muscles of severed frog legs connected to electric wires.
*hour-glass projection: the projection of a flattened hourglass showed the sand flowing upwards. Extreme magnification made the effect extra impressive, with the grains of sand forming a wave-like pattern.
*cohesion figure projection of liquids: different oils and fats create many kinds of moving patterns when manipulated between clear glass plates or a narrow glass box.
Several of these experiments were publicly demonstrated at the Royal Polytechnic Institution.

===Choreutoscope and phenakistiscope-type systems===
Versions of the magic lantern were used to project transparent variations of the phénakisticope. These were adapted with a mechanism that spins the disc and a shutter system. Duboscq produced some in the 1850s and Thomas Ross patented a version called &quot;Wheel of life&quot; in 1869 and 1870.

The Choreutoscope was purportedly invented around 1866 by the Greenwich engineer John Beale, and demonstrated at the Royal Polytechnic. It projected six pictures and used a hand-cranked mechanism for intermittent movement and synchronized shutter action. The mechanism became a key to the development of the movie camera and projector. The Choreutoscope was used at the first professional public demonstration of the Kinetoscope to explain its principles.

An &quot;Optical Instrument&quot; was patented in the U.S. in 1869 by O.B. Brown, using a phenakistiscope-like disc with a technique very close to the later cinematograph; with Maltese Cross motion; a star-wheel and pin being used for intermittent motion, and a two-sector shutter.

===Life in the lantern - Bio-Phantoscope===
John Arthur Roebuck Rudge built a lantern for William Friese-Greene with a mechanism to project a sequence of seven photographic slides. Reports say it was made in 1872, but also 1875 and (most likely) 1882. The surviving slides show a man removing his head with his hands and raising the loose head. The photographed body belonged to Rudge and Friese-Greene posed for the head. The slides probably provided the very first trick photography sequence projection. Friese-Greene demonstrated the machine in his shop, until the police ordered him to remove it when it attracted too large a crowd.

==Phantasmagoria==
Phantasmagoria was a form of horror theater that used one or more magic lanterns to project frightening images, especially of ghosts. Showmen used rear projection, mobile or portable projectors and a variety of effects to produce convincing necromantic experiences. It was very popular in Europe from the late 18th century to well into the 19th century.

It is thought that optical devices like concave mirrors and the camera obscura have been used since antiquity to fool spectators into believing they saw real gods and spirits, but it was the magician &quot;physicist&quot; Phylidor who created what must have been the first true phantasmagoria show. He probably used mobile magic lanterns with the recently invented Argand lamp to create his successful (Schröpfer-esque and Cagiostro-esque Ghost Apparitions) in Vienna from 1790 to 1792. Phylidor stated that his show of perfected apparitions revealed how charlatans like Johann Georg Schröpfer and Cagliostro had fooled their audiences. As &quot;Paul Filidort,&quot; he presented his &quot;Phantasmagorie&quot; in Paris From December 1792 to July 1793, probably using that term for the first time. As &quot;Paul de Philipsthal,&quot; he performed &quot;Phantasmagoria&quot; shows in Britain beginning in 1801 with great success.

One of many showmen who were inspired by Phylidor, Etienne-Gaspard Robert became very famous with his own &quot;Fantasmagorie&quot; show in Paris from 1798 to 1803 (later performing throughout Europe and returning to Paris for a triumphant comeback in Paris in 1814). He patented a mobile &quot;Fantascope&quot; lantern in 1798.

==Royal Polytechnic Institution shows==
When it opened in 1838, The Royal Polytechnic Institution in London became a very popular and influential venue with many kinds of magic lantern shows as an important part of its program. At the main theatre, with 500 seats, lanternists would make good use of a battery of six large lanterns running on tracked tables to project the finely detailed images of extra large slides on the 648 square feet screen. The magic lantern was used to illustrate lectures, concerts, pantomimes and other forms of theatre. Popular magic lantern presentations included Henry Langdon Childe&#x27;s dissolving views, his chromatrope, phantasmagoria, and mechanical slides.

==Utsushi-e==

Utsushi-e is a type of magic lantern show that became popular in Japan in the 19th century. The Dutch probably introduced the magic lantern in Japan before the 1760s. A new style for magic lantern shows was introduced by Kameya Toraku I, who first performed in 1803 in Edo. Possibly the phantasmagoria shows (popular in the west at that moment) inspired the rear projection technique, moving images and ghost stories. Japanese showmen developed lightweight wooden projectors (furo) that were handheld so that several performers could make the projections of different colourful figures move around the screen at the same time. The Western techniques of mechanical slides were combined with traditional Japanese skills—especially from Karakuri puppets—to further animate the figures and for special effects.

==Today==
Some enthusiasts claim that the brilliant quality of color in lantern slides is unsurpassed by successive projection media. The magic lantern and lantern slides are still popular with collectors and can be found in many museums like, for example, in the Museum of Precinema in Padua where 60 magic lanterns and more than 10000 original slides are preserved. However, of the original lanterns from the first 150 years after its invention only 28 are known to still exist (as of 2009). Because the original slides are fragile, rather than display or project them, museums often digitize the slides for exhibition.

A collaborative research project of several European universities called &quot;A Million Pictures&quot; started in June 2015 and lasted until May 2018. It addresses the sustainable preservation of the massive, untapped heritage resource of the tens of thousands of lantern slides in the collections of libraries and museums across Europe.Genuine public lantern shows are relatively rare. Several regular performers claim they are the only one of their kind in their part of the world. These include Pierre Albanese and glass harmonica player Thomas Bloch live Magic Lantern/Phantasmagoria shows since 2008 in Europe and The American Magic-Lantern Theater. The Magic Lantern Society maintains a list of active lanternists, which contains more than 20 performers in the U.K. and around eight performers in other parts of the world (Europe, U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand).

Dutch theatre group Lichtbende produces contemporary magical light spectacles and workshops with magic lanterns.

<text>Mulholland Drive (stylized as Mulholland Dr.) is a 2001 surrealist neo-noir mystery art film written and directed by David Lynch. Its plot follows an aspiring actress (Naomi Watts) who arrives in Los Angeles, where she befriends a woman (Laura Harring) who is suffering from amnesia after a car accident. The film follows several other vignettes and characters, including a Hollywood director (Justin Theroux) who encounters mob interference while casting for his latest film. Lynch&#x27;s tagline for the film is &quot;a love story in the city of dreams&quot;.

The film was originally conceived as a television pilot for ABC, with footage shot and edited in 1999 as an open-ended mystery. After viewing Lynch&#x27;s cut, however, television executives cancelled the proposed TV series. Lynch then secured funding from French production company StudioCanal to make the material into a feature film, writing an ending to the project and filming new material. The resulting surrealist narrative has left the film&#x27;s events open to interpretation. Lynch declined to offer an explanation, leaving audiences, critics, and even the film&#x27;s own cast to speculate on its meaning.

&quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; earned Lynch the 2001 Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Director, as well as nomination for the Academy Award for Best Director for the film. The film boosted Watts&#x27; Hollywood profile considerably, and was the last feature film to star veteran Hollywood actress Ann Miller.

&quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; is often regarded as Lynch&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot; as well as one of the greatest films of all time. It earned the No. 1 spot on the BBC&#x27;s 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century list in 2016 and was ranked at No. 8 in the 2022 edition of &quot;Sight and Sound&quot;″s Greatest Films of All Time poll. The film was also awarded &#x27;Best Film Of The 21st Century&#x27; by IndieWire and &#x27;Best Film Of The 2000s&#x27; by the LA Film Critics Association.

==Plot==

The film opens with a scene of couples dancing the Jitterbug.

A woman is about to be shot by her chauffeur, but is saved when a car crashes into them at night on Mulholland Drive. The woman is the sole survivor. Dazed, she hides in a vacant apartment. The next morning, Betty Elms, an aspiring actress from Deep River, Ontario, arrives at the apartment, which her aunt has lent her. She finds the woman, who has amnesia but remembers she is in danger. For convenience, the woman adopts the name &quot;Rita&quot; from a &quot;Gilda&quot; poster featuring Rita Hayworth. Betty and Rita discover a large quantity of cash and a blue key in Rita&#x27;s purse.

At Winkie&#x27;s diner on Sunset Boulevard, a man tells his friend about a recurring nightmare in which a horrific figure waits for him in the alley behind the diner. His friend dismisses it, but the two investigate the alley anyway. The figure appears as predicted, and the man collapses in shock.

Film director Adam Kesher is threatened by mobsters who want him to cast unknown actress Camilla Rhodes as the lead in his new project, &quot;The Sylvia North Story&quot;. When he refuses, the mobsters shut down the production. Adam returns home and finds his wife in bed with another man. After a scuffle, his wife&#x27;s lover throws him out of his own house. His personal assistant offers to let him stay with her and unsubtly offers sex, but he politely declines. He is pressured into meeting a man dressed as a cowboy, who urges him to cast Camilla for his own good. Elsewhere, incompetent hitman Joe Messing is forced to kill two bystanders to cover up a theft.

After meeting a waitress named &quot;Diane&quot; at Winkie&#x27;s, Rita remembers the name &quot;Diane Selwyn&quot;. Betty finds Diane&#x27;s address in the phone book, but leaves Rita to attend an audition, where she does marvelously. The casting agent brings her to meet Adam, who is auditioning actresses for &quot;The Sylvia North Story&quot;. The two lock eyes, but Betty flees after remembering she promised to meet Rita. Adam reluctantly casts Camilla to please the mob.

Betty and Rita visit Diane Selwyn&#x27;s apartment, but the occupant recently swapped apartments with Diane. The two break into Diane&#x27;s new apartment and discover a woman&#x27;s decomposing corpse in the bed. Horrified, Rita tries to cut her hair off, but Betty persuades her to instead don a blonde wig similar to Betty&#x27;s own hairstyle. They have sex and fall asleep, but Rita wakes them both up when she chants &quot;silencio, no hay banda&quot; (Spanish for &quot;silence, there is no band&quot;) in her sleep.

Rita insists on visiting Club Silencio immediately. There, Betty and Rita watch a surrealist performance art piece, in which a trumpeter and singer Rebekah Del Rio mime and lip-sync performances that are eventually revealed to have been pre-recorded. The idea terrifies Betty. After Rebekah&#x27;s performance, Betty discovers a blue box in her purse matching Rita&#x27;s key, and the two women return home. Rita is about to unlock the box, but finds that Betty has vanished. After unlocking the box, Rita also vanishes.

Diane Selwyn, a depressed and struggling actress who looks exactly like Betty, awakens in the apartment Betty and Rita investigated. Her neighbor visits to pick up her things and warns that detectives are looking for Diane. Diane daydreams about Camilla Rhodes, a successful actress who looks exactly like Rita. She cries after recalling that Camilla broke up with her.

Camilla invites Diane to a party at Adam&#x27;s house on Mulholland Drive. There, Diane meets Adam&#x27;s mother, who looks exactly like Betty&#x27;s landlady. Diane explains that she moved to Los Angeles with money she inherited from her deceased aunt and that she met Camilla when they both auditioned for the lead in &quot;The Sylvia North Story&quot;. It is revealed that Adam cast Camilla as the lead in a film; that Adam and Camilla are now dating; and that Camilla threw the party to announce their engagement. In addition, Camilla publicly kisses her mistress, who looks exactly like the &quot;Camilla Rhodes&quot; from the mobster subplot. Diane shakes with rage.

Diane meets Joe Messing at Winkie&#x27;s (where a waitress is named &quot;Betty&quot;) and hires him to kill Camilla. He promises to leave Diane a blue key as a sign that the job is done. Later, a traumatized Diane stares at the blue key on her coffee table. Terrorized by hallucinations, she runs into her bedroom and shoots herself. At Club Silencio, a blue-haired woman whispers &quot;silencio&quot;.

==Themes and interpretations==
Giving the film only the tagline &quot;A love story in the city of dreams&quot;, David Lynch refused to comment on &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot;″s meaning or symbolism, leading to much discussion and multiple interpretations. The &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot; film critic David Sterritt spoke with Lynch after the film screened at Cannes and wrote that the director &quot;insisted that &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; does tell a coherent, comprehensible story&quot;, unlike some of Lynch&#x27;s earlier films like &quot;Lost Highway&quot;. On the other hand, Justin Theroux said of Lynch&#x27;s feelings on the multiple meanings people perceive in the film, &quot;I think he&#x27;s genuinely happy for it to mean anything you want. He loves it when people come up with really bizarre interpretations. David works from his subconscious.&quot; The film was described as a neo-noir.

===Dreams and alternative realities===
An early interpretation of the film uses dream analysis to argue that the first part is a dream of the real Diane Selwyn, who has cast her dream-self as the innocent and hopeful &quot;Betty Elms&quot;, reconstructing her history and persona into something like an old Hollywood film. In the dream, Betty is successful, charming, and lives the fantasy life of a soon-to-be-famous actress. The remainder of the film presents Diane&#x27;s real life, in which she has failed both personally and professionally. She arranges for Camilla, an ex-lover, to be killed, and unable to cope with the guilt, re-imagines her as the dependent, pliable amnesiac Rita. Clues to her inevitable demise, however, continue to appear throughout her dream.

This interpretation was similar to what Naomi Watts construed, when she said in an interview, &quot;I thought Diane was the real character and that Betty was the person she wanted to be and had dreamed up. Rita is the damsel in distress and she&#x27;s in absolute need of Betty, and Betty controls her as if she were a doll. Rita is Betty&#x27;s fantasy of who she wants Camilla to be.&quot; Watts&#x27; own early experiences in Hollywood parallel those of Diane&#x27;s. She endured some professional frustration before she became successful, auditioned for parts in which she did not believe, and encountered people who did not follow through with opportunities. She recalled, &quot;There were a lot of promises, but nothing actually came off. I ran out of money and became quite lonely.&quot; Michael Wilmington of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; found that &quot;everything in &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; is a nightmare. It&#x27;s a portrayal of the Hollywood golden dream turning rancid, curdling into a poisonous stew of hatred, envy, sleazy compromise and soul-killing failure. This is the underbelly of our glamorous fantasies, and the area Lynch shows here is realistically portrayed.&quot;

&quot;The Guardian&quot; asked six well-known film critics for their own perceptions of the overall meaning in &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot;. Neil Roberts of &quot;The Sun&quot; and Tom Charity of &quot;Time Out&quot; subscribe to the theory that Betty is Diane&#x27;s projection of a happier life. Roger Ebert and Jonathan Ross seem to accept this interpretation, but both hesitate to overanalyze the film. Ebert states, &quot;There is no explanation. There may not even be a mystery.&quot; Ross observes that there are storylines that go nowhere: &quot;Perhaps these were leftovers from the pilot it was originally intended to be, or perhaps these things are the non-sequiturs and subconscious of dreams.&quot; Philip French from &quot;The Observer&quot; sees it as an allusion to Hollywood tragedy, while Jane Douglas from the BBC rejects the theory of Betty&#x27;s life as Diane&#x27;s dream, but also warns against too much analysis.

Media theorist Siobhan Lyons similarly disagrees with the dream theory, arguing that it is a &quot;superficial interpretation [which] undermines the strength of the absurdity of reality that often takes place in Lynch&#x27;s universe.&quot; Instead, Lyons posits that Betty and Diane are in fact two different people who happen to look similar, a common motif among Hollywood starlets. In a similar interpretation, Betty and Rita and Diane and Camilla may exist in parallel universes that sometimes interconnect. Another theory offered is that the narrative is a Möbius strip. It was also suggested that the entire film takes place in a dream, yet the identity of the dreamer is unknown. Repeated references to beds, bedrooms and sleeping represent the influence of dreams. Rita falls asleep several times; in between these episodes, disconnected scenes such as the men having a conversation at Winkie&#x27;s, Betty&#x27;s arrival in Los Angeles and the bungled hit take place, suggesting that Rita may be dreaming them. The opening shot of the film zooms into a bed containing an unknown sleeper, instilling, according to film scholar Ruth Perlmutter, the necessity to question the reality of following events. Professor of dream studies Kelly Bulkeley argues that the early scene at the diner, being the only scene in which dreams or dreaming are explicitly mentioned, illustrates &quot;revelatory truth and epistemological uncertainty in Lynch&#x27;s film.&quot; The monstrous being from the dream, who is the subject of conversation of the men in Winkie&#x27;s, reappears at the end of the film right before and after Diane commits suicide. Bulkeley asserts that the lone discussion of dreams in that scene presents an opening to &quot;a new way of understanding everything that happens in the movie.&quot;

Philosopher and film theorist Robert Sinnerbrink similarly notes that the images following Diane&#x27;s apparent suicide undermine the &quot;dream and reality&quot; interpretation. After Diane shoots herself, the bed is consumed with smoke, and Betty and Rita are shown beaming at each other, after which a woman in the Club Silencio balcony whispers &quot;Silencio&quot; as the screen fades to black. Sinnerbrink writes that the &quot;concluding images float in an indeterminate zone between fantasy and reality, which is perhaps the genuinely metaphysical dimension of the cinematic image,&quot; also noting that it might be that the &quot;last sequence comprises the fantasy images of Diane&#x27;s dying consciousness, concluding with the real moment of her death: the final &quot;Silencio&quot;.&quot; Referring to the same sequence, film theorist Andrew Hageman notes that &quot;the ninety-second coda that follows Betty/Diane&#x27;s suicide is a cinematic space that persists after the curtain has dropped on her living consciousness, and this persistent space is the very theatre where the illusion of illusion is continually unmasked.&quot;

Film theorist David Roche writes that Lynch films do not simply tell detective stories, but rather force the audience into the role of becoming detectives themselves to make sense of the narratives, and that &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot;, like other Lynch films, frustrates &quot;the spectator&#x27;s need for a rational diegesis by playing on the spectator&#x27;s mistake that narration is synonymous with diegesis.&quot; In Lynch&#x27;s films, the spectator is always &quot;one step behind narration&quot; and thus &quot;narration prevails over diegesis.&quot; Roche also notes that there are multiple mysteries in the film that ultimately go unanswered by the characters who meet dead ends, like Betty and Rita, or give in to pressures as Adam does. Although the audience still struggles to make sense of the stories, the characters are no longer trying to solve their mysteries. Roche concludes that &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; is a mystery film not because it allows the audience to view the solution to a question, but the film itself is a mystery that is held together &quot;by the spectator-detective&#x27;s desire to make sense&quot; of it.

===A &quot;poisonous valentine to Hollywood&quot;===

Despite the proliferation of theories, critics note that no explanation satisfies all of the loose ends and questions that arise from the film. Stephen Holden of the &quot;New York Times&quot; writes, &quot;&quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; has little to do with any single character&#x27;s love life or professional ambition. The movie is an ever-deepening reflection on the allure of Hollywood and on the multiple role-playing and self-invention that the movie-going experience promises. ... What greater power is there than the power to enter and to program the dream life of the culture?&quot; J. Hoberman from the &quot;Village Voice&quot; echoes this sentiment by calling it a &quot;poisonous valentine to Hollywood.&quot;

&quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; has been compared with Billy Wilder&#x27;s film noir &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; (1950), another tale about broken dreams in Hollywood, and early in the film Rita is shown crossing Sunset Boulevard at night. Apart from both titles being named after iconic Los Angeles streets, &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; is &quot;Lynch&#x27;s unique account of what held Wilder&#x27;s attention too: human putrefaction (a term Lynch used several times during his press conference at the New York Film Festival 2001) in a city of lethal illusions.&quot; Lynch lived near Mulholland Drive, and stated in an interview, &quot;At night, you ride on the top of the world. In the daytime you ride on top of the world, too, but it&#x27;s mysterious, and there&#x27;s a hair of fear because it goes into remote areas. You feel the history of Hollywood in that road.&quot; Watts also had experience with the road before her career was established: &quot;I remember driving along the street many times sobbing my heart out in my car, going, &#x27;What am I doing here?

Critic Gregory Weight cautions viewers against the cynicism of believing that Lynch presents only &quot;the façade and that he believes only evil and deceit lie beneath it.&quot; As much as Lynch makes a statement about the deceit, manipulation and false pretenses in Hollywood culture, he also infuses nostalgia throughout the film and recognizes that real art comes from classic filmmaking, as Lynch cast and thereby paid tribute to veteran actors Ann Miller, Lee Grant and Chad Everett. He also portrays Betty as extraordinarily talented and shows that her abilities are noticed by powerful people in the entertainment industry. Commenting on the contrasting positions between film nostalgia and the putrefaction of Hollywood, Steven Dillon writes that &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; is critical of the culture of Hollywood as much as it is a condemnation of cinephilia.

Harring described her interpretation after seeing the film: &quot;When I saw it the first time, I thought it was the story of Hollywood dreams, illusion and obsession. It touches on the idea that nothing is quite as it seems, especially the idea of being a Hollywood movie star. The second and third times I saw it, I thought it dealt with identity. Do we know who we are? And then I kept seeing different things in it. ... There&#x27;s no right or wrong to what someone takes away from it or what they think the film is really about. It&#x27;s a movie that makes you continuously ponder, makes you ask questions. I&#x27;ve heard over and over, &#x27;This is a movie that I&#x27;ll see again&#x27; or &#x27;This is a movie you&#x27;ve got to see again.&#x27; It intrigues you. You want to get it, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a movie to be gotten. It&#x27;s achieved its goal if it makes you ask questions.&quot;

===Romantic content===
The relationships between Betty and Rita, and Diane and Camilla have been variously described as &quot;touching,&quot; &quot;moving,&quot; as well as &quot;titillating.&quot; The French critic Thierry Jousse, in his review for &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot;, said that the love between the women depicted is &quot;of lyricism practically without equal in contemporary cinema.&quot; In the pages of &quot;Film Comment&quot;, Phillip Lopate states that the pivotal romantic interlude between Betty and Rita was made poignant and tender by Betty&#x27;s &quot;understanding for the first time, with self-surprise, that all her helpfulness and curiosity about the other woman had a point: desire ... It is a beautiful moment, made all the more miraculous by its earned tenderness, and its distances from anything lurid.&quot; Stephanie Zacharek of &quot;Salon&quot; magazine stated that the scene&#x27;s &quot;eroticism [was] so potent it blankets the whole movie, coloring every scene that came before and every one that follows.&quot; Betty and Rita were chosen by the Independent Film Channel as the emblematic romantic couple of the 2000s. Writer Charles Taylor said, &quot;Betty and Rita are often framed against darkness so soft and velvety it&#x27;s like a hovering nimbus, ready to swallow them if they awake from the film&#x27;s dream. And when they are swallowed, when smoke fills the frame as if the sulfur of hell itself were obscuring our vision, we feel as if not just a romance has been broken, but the beauty of the world has been cursed.&quot;

Some film theorists have argued that Lynch inserts queerness in the aesthetic and thematic content of the film. The non-linear film is &quot;incapable of sustaining narrative coherence,&quot; as Lee Wallace argues, and &quot;lesbianism dissolves the ideological conventions of narrative realism, operating as the switch point for the contesting storyworlds within Lynch&#x27;s elaborately plotted film.&quot; The presence of mirrors and doppelgangers throughout the film &quot;are common representations of lesbian desire.&quot; The co-dependency in the relationship between Betty and Rita—which borders on outright obsession—has been compared to the female relationships in two similar films, Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s &quot;Persona&quot; (1966) and Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;3 Women&quot; (1977), which also depict identities of vulnerable women that become tangled, interchanging and ultimately merged: &quot;The female couples also mirror each other, with their mutual interactions conflating hero(ine) worship with same-sex desire.&quot; Lynch pays direct homage to &quot;Persona&quot; in the scene where Rita dons the blonde wig, styled exactly like Betty&#x27;s own hair. Rita and Betty then gaze at each other in the mirror &quot;drawing attention to their physical similarity, linking the sequence to theme of embrace, physical coupling and the idea of merging or doubling.&quot; Mirroring and doubles, which are prominent themes throughout the film, serve to further queer the form and content of the film.

Several theorists have accused Lynch of perpetuating stereotypes and clichés of lesbians, bisexuals and lesbian relationships. Rita (the &quot;femme fatale&quot;) and Betty (the school girl) represent two classic stock lesbian characters; Heather Love identifies two key clichés used in the film: &quot;Lynch presents lesbianism in its innocent and expansive form: lesbian desire appears as one big adventure, an entrée into a glamorous and unknown territory.&quot; Simultaneously, he presents the tragic lesbian triangle, &quot;in which an attractive but unavailable woman dumps a less attractive woman who is figured as exclusively lesbian,&quot; perpetuating the stereotype of the bisexual &quot;ending up with a man.&quot; Maria San Filippo recognizes that Lynch relies on classic film noir archetypes to develop Camilla&#x27;s eventual betrayal: these archetypes &quot;become ingrained to such a degree that viewers are immediately cued that &#x27;Rita&#x27; is not what she seems and that it is only a matter of time before she reveals her duplicitous nature.&quot; For Love, Diane&#x27;s exclusively lesbian desire is &quot;between success and failure, between sexiness and abjection, even between life and death&quot; if she is rejected. In this context the character of Diane may be interpreted as the &quot;tragic lesbian&quot; cliché pining after the bisexual in the heterosexual relationship. Love&#x27;s analysis of the film notes the media&#x27;s peculiar response to the film&#x27;s lesbian content: &quot;reviewers rhapsodized in particular and at length about the film&#x27;s sex scenes, as if there were a contest to see who could enjoy this representation of female same-sex desire the most.&quot; She points out that the film used a classic theme in literature and film depicting lesbian relationships: Camilla as achingly beautiful and available, rejecting Diane for Adam. Popular reaction to the film suggests the contrasting relationships between Betty and Rita and Diane and Camilla are &quot;understood as both the hottest thing on earth and, at the same time, as something fundamentally sad and not at all erotic&quot; as &quot;the heterosexual order asserts itself with crushing effects for the abandoned woman.&quot;

Heterosexuality as primary is important in the latter half of the film, as the ultimate demise of Diane and Camilla&#x27;s relationship springs from the matrimony of the heterosexual couple. At Adam&#x27;s party, they begin to announce that Camilla and Adam are getting married; through laughs and kisses, the declaration is delayed because it is obvious and expected. The heterosexual closure of the scene is interrupted by a scene change. As Lee Wallace suggests, by planning a hit against Camilla, &quot;Diane circumvents the heterosexual closure of the industry story but only by going over to its storyworld, an act that proves fatal for both women, the cause and effect relations of the thriller being fundamentally incompatible with the plot of lesbianism as the film presents it.&quot;

Media portrayals of Naomi Watts&#x27;s and Laura Elena Harring&#x27;s views of their onscreen relationships were varied and conflicting. Watts said of the filming of the scene, &quot;I don&#x27;t see it as erotic, though maybe it plays that way. The last time I saw it, I actually had tears in my eyes because I knew where the story was going. It broke my heart a little bit.&quot; However, in another interview Watts stated, &quot;I was amazed how honest and real all this looks on screen. These girls look really in love and it was curiously erotic.&quot; While Harring was quoted saying, &quot;The love scene just happened in my eyes. Rita&#x27;s very grateful for the help Betty&#x27;s given [her] so I&#x27;m saying goodbye and goodnight to her, thank you, from the bottom of my heart. I kiss her and then there&#x27;s just an energy that takes us [over]. Of course, I have amnesia so I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve done it before, but I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re really lesbians.&quot; Heather Love agreed somewhat with Harring&#x27;s perception when she stated that identity in &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; is not as important as desire: &quot;who we are does not count for much—what matters instead is what we are about to do, what we want to do.&quot;

==Characters==

Betty Elms (Naomi Watts) is the bright and talented newcomer to Los Angeles, described as &quot;wholesome, optimistic, determined to take the town by storm,&quot; and &quot;absurdly naïve.&quot; Her perkiness and intrepid approach to helping Rita because it is the right thing to do is reminiscent of Nancy Drew for reviewers. Her entire persona at first is an apparent cliché of small-town naïveté. But it is Betty&#x27;s identity, or loss of it, that appears to be the focus of the film. For one critic, Betty performed the role of the film&#x27;s consciousness and unconscious. Watts, who modeled Betty on Doris Day, Tippi Hedren and Kim Novak, observed that Betty is a thrill-seeker, someone &quot;who finds herself in a world she doesn&#x27;t belong in and is ready to take on a new identity, even if it&#x27;s somebody else&#x27;s.&quot; This has also led one theorist to conclude that since Betty had naïvely, yet eagerly entered the Hollywood system, she had become a &quot;complicit actor&quot; who had &quot;embraced the very structure that&quot; destroyed her. In an explanation of her development of the Betty character, Watts stated:

I had to therefore come up with my own decisions about what this meant and what this character was going through, what was dream and what was reality. My interpretation could end up being completely different, from both David and the audience. But I &quot;did&quot; have to reconcile all of that, and people seem to think it works.

Betty, however difficult to believe as her character is established, shows an astonishing depth in her audition. Previously rehearsed with Rita in the apartment, where Rita feeds her lines woodenly, the scene is &quot;dreck&quot; and &quot;hollow; every line unworthy of a genuine actress&#x27;s commitment,&quot; and Betty plays it in rehearsal as poorly as it is written. However, though nervous but plucky as ever at the audition, Betty enters the cramped room, and when pitted inches from her audition partner (Chad Everett), she turns it into a scene of powerful sexual tension that she fully controls and draws in every person in the room. The sexuality erodes immediately as the scene ends and she stands before them shyly waiting for their approval. One film analyst asserts that Betty&#x27;s previously unknown ability steals the show, specifically, taking the dark mystery away from Rita and assigning it to herself, and by Lynch&#x27;s use of this scene, he illustrates his use of deception in his characters. Betty&#x27;s acting ability prompts Ruth Perlmutter to speculate that if Betty is acting the role of Diane in either a dream or a parody of a film, ultimately her acting turns against her.

Rita (Laura Elena Harring) is the mysterious and helpless apparent victim, a classic &quot;femme fatale&quot; with her dark, strikingly beautiful appearance. Roger Ebert was so impressed with Harring that he said of her &quot;all she has to do is stand there and she is the first good argument in 55 years for a &quot;Gilda&quot; remake.&quot; She serves as the object of desire, directly oppositional to Betty&#x27;s bright self-assuredness. She is also the first character with whom the audience identifies, and as viewers know her as confused and frightened, not knowing who she is and where she is going, she represents their desire to make sense of the film through her identity. Instead of threatening, she inspires Betty to nurture, console and help her. Her amnesia makes her a blank persona, which one reviewer notes is &quot;the vacancy that comes with extraordinary beauty and the onlooker&#x27;s willingness to project any combination of angelic and devilish onto her.&quot; A character analysis of Rita asserts that her actions are the most genuine of the first portion of the film, since she has no memory and nothing to use as a frame of reference for how to behave. Todd McGowan, however, author of a book on themes in Lynch&#x27;s films, states that the first portion of &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; can be construed as Rita&#x27;s fantasy, until Diane Selwyn is revealed; Betty is the object that overcomes Rita&#x27;s anxiety about her loss of identity. According to film historian Steven Dillon, Diane transitions a former roommate into Rita: following a tense scene where the roommate collects her remaining belongings, Rita appears in the apartment, smiling at Diane.

After Betty and Rita find the decomposing body, they flee the apartment and their images are split apart and reintegrated. David Roche notes that Rita&#x27;s lack of identity causes a breakdown that &quot;occurs not only at the level of the character but also at the level of the image; the shot is subjected to special effects that fragment their image and their voices are drowned out in reverb, the camera seemingly writing out the mental state of the characters&quot;. Immediately they return to Betty&#x27;s aunt&#x27;s apartment where Rita dons a blonde wig—ostensibly to disguise herself—but making her look remarkably like Betty. It is this transformation that one film analyst suggests is the melding of both identities. This is supported by visual clues, like particular camera angles making their faces appear to be merging into one. This is further illustrated soon after by their sexual intimacy, followed by Rita&#x27;s personality becoming more dominant as she insists they go to Club Silencio at 2 a.m., that eventually leads to the total domination by Camilla.

Diane Selwyn (Watts) is the palpably frustrated and depressed woman, who seems to have ridden the coattails of Camilla, whom she idolizes and adores, but who does not return her affection. She is considered to be the reality of the too-good-to-be-true Betty, or a later version of Betty after living too long in Hollywood. For Steven Dillon, the plot of the film &quot;makes Rita the perfect empty vessel for Diane&#x27;s fantasies&quot;, but because Rita is only a &quot;blank cover girl&quot; Diane has &quot;invested herself in emptiness&quot;, which leads her to depression and apparently to suicide. Hence, Diane is the personification of dissatisfaction, painfully illustrated when she is unable to climax while masturbating, in a scene that indicates &quot;through blurred, jerky, point of view shots of the stony wall—not only her tears and humiliation but the disintegration of her fantasy and her growing desire for revenge&quot;. One analysis of Diane suggests her devotion to Camilla is based on a manifestation of narcissism, as Camilla embodies everything Diane wants and wants to be. Although she is portrayed as weak and the ultimate loser, for Jeff Johnson, author of a book about morality in Lynch films, Diane is the only character in the second portion of the film whose moral code remains intact. She is &quot;a decent person corrupted by the miscellaneous miscreants who populate the film industry&quot;. Her guilt and regret are evident in her suicide, and in the clues that surface in the first portion of the film. Rita&#x27;s fear, the dead body and the illusion at Club Silencio indicate that something is dark and wrong in Betty and Rita&#x27;s world. In becoming free from Camilla, her moral conditioning kills her.

Camilla Rhodes (Melissa George, Laura Elena Harring) is little more than a face in a photo and a name that has inspired many representatives of some vaguely threatening power to place her in a film against the wishes of Adam. Referred to as a &quot;vapid moll&quot; by one reviewer, she barely makes an impression in the first portion of the film, but after the blue box is opened and she is portrayed by Harring, she becomes a full person who symbolizes &quot;betrayal, humiliation and abandonment&quot;, and is the object of Diane&#x27;s sexual obsession and frustration. Diane is a sharp contrast to Camilla, who is more voluptuous than ever, and who appears to have &quot;sucked the life out of Diane&quot;. Immediately after telling Diane that &quot;she drives her wild&quot;, Camilla tells her they must end their affair. On a film set where Adam is directing Camilla, he orders the set cleared, except for Diane—at Camilla&#x27;s request—where Adam shows another actor just how to kiss Camilla correctly. Instead of punishing Camilla for such public humiliation, as is suggested by Diane&#x27;s conversation with the bungling hit man, one critic views Rita as the vulnerable representation of Diane&#x27;s desire for Camilla.

Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux) is established in the first portion of the film as a &quot;vaguely arrogant&quot;, but apparently successful, director who endures one humiliation after another. Theroux said of his role, &quot;He&#x27;s sort of the one character in the film who doesn&#x27;t know what the [hell&#x27;s] going on. I think he&#x27;s the one guy the audience says, &#x27;I&#x27;m kind of like you right now. I don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;re being subjected to all this pain. After being stripped of creative control of his film, he is cuckolded by the pool cleaner (played by Billy Ray Cyrus), and thrown out of his own opulent house above Hollywood. After he checks into a seedy motel and pays with cash, the manager arrives to tell him that his credit is no good. Witnessed by Diane, Adam is pompous and self-important. He is the only character whose personality does not seem to change completely from the first part of the film to the second. One analysis of Adam&#x27;s character contends that because he capitulated and chose Camilla Rhodes for his film, that is the end of Betty&#x27;s cheerfulness and ability to help Rita, placing the blame for her tragedy on the representatives of studio power. Another analysis suggests that &quot;Adam Kesher does not have the control, he wants and is willing to step over who or what is necessary to consolidate his career. Hungry for power, he uses the appearance of love or seduction only as one more tool. Love for power justifies that everything else is forgotten, be it pride, love or any other consideration. There are no regrets, it is Mulholland Drive in Los Angeles.&quot;

Minor characters include The Cowboy (Monty Montgomery), the Castigliani Brothers (Dan Hedaya and Angelo Badalamenti) and Mr. Roque (Michael J. Anderson), all of whom are somehow involved in pressuring Adam to cast Camilla Rhodes in his film. These characters represent the death of creativity for film scholars, and they portray a &quot;vision of the industry as a closed hierarchical system in which the ultimate source of power remains hidden behind a series of representatives&quot;. Ann Miller portrays Coco, the landlady who welcomes Betty to her wonderful new apartment. Coco, in the first part of the film, represents the old guard in Hollywood, who welcomes and protects Betty. In the second part of the film, however, she appears as Adam&#x27;s mother, who impatiently chastises Diane for being late to the party and barely pays attention to Diane&#x27;s embarrassed tale of how she got into acting.

==Style==
The filmmaking style of David Lynch has been written about extensively using descriptions like &quot;ultraweird&quot;, &quot;dark&quot; and &quot;oddball&quot;. Todd McGowan writes, &quot;One cannot watch a Lynch film the way one watches a standard Hollywood film noir nor in the way that one watches most radical films.&quot; Through Lynch&#x27;s juxtaposition of cliché and surreal, nightmares and fantasies, nonlinear story lines, camera work, sound and lighting, he presents a film that challenges viewers to suspend belief of what they are experiencing. Many of the characters in &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; are archetypes that can only be perceived as cliché: the new Hollywood hopeful, the &quot;femme fatale&quot;, the maverick director and shady powerbrokers that Lynch never seems to explore fully. Lynch places these often hackneyed characters in dire situations, creating dream-like qualities. By using these characters in scenarios that have components and references to dreams, fantasies and nightmares, viewers are left to decide, between the extremes, what is reality. One film analyst, Jennifer Hudson, writes of him, &quot;Like most surrealists, Lynch&#x27;s language of the unexplained is the fluid language of dreams.&quot;

David Lynch uses various methods of deception in &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot;. A shadowy figure named Mr. Roque, who seems to control film studios, is portrayed by dwarf actor Michael J. Anderson. Anderson, who has only two lines and is seated in an enormous wooden wheelchair, was fitted with oversized foam prosthetic arms and legs in order to portray his head as abnormally small. During Adam and Camilla&#x27;s party, Diane watches Camilla (played by Harring) with Adam on one arm, lean over and deeply kiss the same woman who appeared as Camilla (Melissa George) before the blue box was opened. Both then turn and smile pointedly at Diane. Film critic Franklin Ridgway writes that the depiction of such a deliberate &quot;cruel and manipulative&quot; act makes it unclear if Camilla is as capricious as she seems, or if Diane&#x27;s paranoia is allowing the audience only to see what she senses. In a scene immediately after Betty&#x27;s audition, the film cuts to a woman singing without apparent accompaniment, but as the camera pulls backwards, the audience sees that it is a recording studio. In actuality, it is a sound stage where Betty has just arrived to meet Adam Kesher, that the audience realizes as the camera pulls back further. Ridgway insists that such deception through artful camera work sets the viewer full of doubt about what is being presented: &quot;It is as if the camera, in its graceful fluidity of motion, reassures us that it (thinks it) sees everything, has everything under control, even if we (and Betty) do not.&quot;

According to Stephen Dillon, Lynch&#x27;s use of different camera positions throughout the film, such as hand-held points of view, makes the viewer &quot;identify with the suspense of the character in his or her particular space&quot;, but that Lynch at moments also &quot;disconnects the camera from any particular point of view, thereby ungrounding a single or even a human perspective&quot; so that the multiple perspectives keep contexts from merging, significantly troubling &quot;our sense of the individual and the human&quot;. Andrew Hageman similarly notes that the camera work in the film &quot;renders a very disturbing sense of place and presence&quot;, such as the scene in Winkie&#x27;s where the &quot;camera floats irregularly during the shot-reverse shot dialogue&quot; by which the &quot;spectator becomes aware that a set of normally objective shots have become disturbingly subjective&quot;. Scholar Curt Hersey recognizes several avant-garde techniques used in the film including lack of transitions, abrupt transitions, motion speed, nontraditional camera movement, computer-generated imagery, nondiegetic images, nonlinear narration and intertextuality.

The first portion of the film that establishes the characters of Betty, Rita and Adam presents some of the most logical filmmaking of Lynch&#x27;s career. The later part of the film that represents reality to many viewers, however, exhibits a marked change in cinematic effect that gives it a quality just as surreal as the first part. Diane&#x27;s scenes feature choppier editing and dirtier lighting that symbolize her physical and spiritual impoverishment, which contrasts with the first portion of the film where &quot;even the plainest decor seems to sparkle&quot;, Betty and Rita glow with light and transitions between scenes are smooth. Lynch moves between scenes in the first portion of the film by using panoramic shots of the mountains, palm trees and buildings in Los Angeles. In the darker part of the film, sound transitions to the next scene without a visual reference where it is taking place. At Camilla&#x27;s party, when Diane is most humiliated, the sound of crashing dishes is heard that carries immediately to the scene where dishes have been dropped in the diner, and Diane is speaking with the hit man. Sinnerbrink also notes that several scenes in the film, such as the one featuring Diane&#x27;s hallucination of Camilla after Diane wakes up, the image of the being from behind Winkie&#x27;s after Diane&#x27;s suicide, or the &quot;repetition, reversal and displacement of elements that were differently configured&quot; in the early portion of the film, creates the uncanny effect where viewers are presented with familiar characters or situations in altered times or locations. Similarly, Hageman has identified the early scene at Winkie&#x27;s as &quot;extremely uncanny&quot;, because it is a scene where the &quot;boundaries separating physical reality from the imaginary realities of the unconscious disintegrate&quot;. Author Valtteri Kokko has identified three groups of &quot;uncanny metaphors&quot;; the doppelgänger of multiple characters played by the same actors, dreams and an everyday object—primarily the blue box—that initiates Rita&#x27;s disappearance and Diane&#x27;s real life.

Another recurring element in Lynch&#x27;s films is his experimentation with sound. He stated in an interview, &quot;you look at the image and the scene silent, it&#x27;s doing the job it&#x27;s supposed to do, but the work isn&#x27;t done. When you start working on the sound, keep working until it feels correct. There&#x27;s so many wrong sounds and instantly you know it. Sometimes it&#x27;s really magical.&quot; In the opening scene of the film, as the dark-haired woman stumbles off Mulholland Drive, silently it suggests she is clumsy. After Lynch added &quot;a hint of the steam [from the wreck] and the screaming kids&quot;, however, it transformed Laura Elena Harring from clumsy to terrified. Lynch also infused subtle rumblings throughout portions of the film that reviewers noted added unsettling and creepy effects. Hageman also identifies &quot;perpetual and uncanny ambient sound&quot;, and places a particular emphasis on the scene where the man collapses behind Winkie&#x27;s as normal sound is drowned out by a buzzing roar, noting that the noise &quot;creates a dissonance and suspense that draws in the spectator as detective to place the sound and reestablish order&quot;. &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot;″s ending with the woman at Club Silencio whispering is an example of Lynch&#x27;s aural deception and surreality, according to Ruth Perlmutter, who writes, &quot;The acting, the dreams, the search for identity, the fears and terrors of the undefined self are over when the film is over, and therefore, there is only silence and enigma.&quot;

==Production==
===Development===
Originally conceived as a television series, &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; began as a 90-minute pilot produced for Touchstone Television and intended for the ABC television network. Tony Krantz, the agent who was responsible for the development of &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, was &quot;fired up&quot; about doing another television series. Lynch sold the idea to ABC executives based only on the story of Rita emerging from the car accident with her purse containing $125,000 in cash and the blue key, and Betty trying to help her figure out who she is. An ABC executive recalled, &quot;I remember the creepiness of this woman in this horrible, horrible crash, and David teasing us with the notion that people are chasing her. She&#x27;s not just &#x27;in&#x27; trouble—she &quot;is&quot; trouble. Obviously, we asked, &#x27;What happens next?&#x27; And David said, &#x27;You have to buy the pitch for me to tell you. Lynch showed ABC a rough cut of the pilot. The person who saw it, according to Lynch, was watching it at six in the morning and was having coffee and standing up. He hated the pilot, and ABC immediately cancelled it. Pierre Edelman, Lynch&#x27;s friend from Paris, came to visit and started talking to him about the film being a feature. Edelman went back to Paris. Canal+ wanted to give Lynch money to make it into a feature and it took a year to negotiate.

Lynch described the attractiveness of the idea of a pilot, despite the knowledge that the medium of television would be constricting: &quot;I&#x27;m a sucker for a continuing story ... Theoretically, you can get a very deep story and you can go so deep and open the world so beautifully, but it takes time to do that.&quot; The story included surreal elements, much like Lynch&#x27;s earlier series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;. Groundwork was laid for story arcs, such as the mystery of Rita&#x27;s identity, Betty&#x27;s career and Adam Kesher&#x27;s film project.

Actress Sherilyn Fenn stated in a 2014 interview that the original idea came during the filming of &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, as a spin-off film for her character of Audrey Horne.

===Casting===

Lynch cast Naomi Watts and Laura Harring by their photographs. He called them in separately for half-hour interviews and told them that he had not seen any of their previous works in film or television. Harring considered it fateful that she was involved in a minor car accident on the way to the first interview, only to learn her character would also be involved in a car accident in the film. Watts arrived wearing jeans for the first interview, direct from the airplane from New York City. Lynch asked her to return the next day &quot;more glammed up&quot;. She was offered the part two weeks later. Lynch explained his selection of Watts, &quot;I saw someone that I felt had a tremendous talent, and I saw someone who had a beautiful soul, an intelligence—possibilities for a lot of different roles, so it was a beautiful full package.&quot; Justin Theroux also met Lynch directly after his airplane flight. After a long flight with little sleep, Theroux arrived dressed all in black, with untidy hair. Lynch liked the look and decided to cast Adam wearing similar clothes and the same hairstyle.

===Filming===
Filming for the television pilot began on location in Los Angeles in February 1999 and took six weeks. Ultimately, the network was unhappy with the pilot and decided not to place it on its schedule. Objections included the nonlinear storyline, the ages of Harring and Watts (whom they considered too old), cigarette smoking by Ann Miller&#x27;s character and a close-frame shot of dog feces in one scene. Lynch remembered, &quot;All I know is, I loved making it, ABC hated it, and I don&#x27;t like the cut I turned in. I agreed with ABC that the longer cut was too slow, but I was forced to butcher it because we had a deadline, and there wasn&#x27;t time to finesse anything. It lost texture, big scenes and storylines, and there are 300 tape copies of the bad version circulating around. Lots of people have seen it, which is embarrassing, because they&#x27;re bad-quality tapes, too. I don&#x27;t want to think about it.&quot;

The script was later rewritten and expanded when Lynch decided to transform it into a feature film. Lynch explained the process of developing an ending for the unfinished story: &quot;The day came when I got the greenlight to turn it into a feature, and I had zero ideas. I just hadn’t been thinking about it. Then came the day I needed to get those ideas, and that night, I sat down during my meditation and in there, I say like a string of pearls, all the ideas came, all at once, and there it was.&quot; He added that, &quot;Now, looking back, I see that [the film] always wanted to be this way. It just took this strange beginning to cause it to be what it is.&quot; The result was an extra eighteen pages of material that included the romantic relationship between Rita and Betty and the events that occurred after the blue box was opened. Watts was relieved that the pilot was dropped by ABC. She found Betty too one-dimensional without the darker portion of the film that was put together afterward. Most of the new scenes were filmed in October 2000, funded with $7 million from French production company StudioCanal.

Theroux described approaching filming without entirely understanding the plot: &quot;You get the whole script, but he might as well withhold the scenes you&#x27;re not in, because the whole turns out to be more mystifying than the parts. David welcomes questions, but he won&#x27;t answer any of them ... You work kind of half-blindfolded. If he were a first-time director and hadn&#x27;t demonstrated any command of this method, I&#x27;d probably have reservations. But it obviously works for him.&quot; Theroux noted that the only answer Lynch did provide was that he was certain that Theroux&#x27;s character, a Hollywood director, was not meant to be Lynch. Watts stated that she tried to bluff Lynch by pretending she had the plot figured out, and that he delighted in the cast&#x27;s frustration.

&quot;I&#x27;m not going to lie: I felt very vulnerable,&quot; Laura Harring said of filming the sex scene between Harring and Watts&#x27; characters. &quot;I was in my dressing room and was on the verge of tears. It&#x27;s hard. There are a lot of people there ... Naomi and I were friends. It was pretty awkward.&quot;

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack of &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; was supervised by Angelo Badalamenti, who collaborated on previous Lynch projects &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; and &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;. Badalamenti, who was nominated for awards from the American Film Institute (AFI) and the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) for his work on the film, also has a cameo as an espresso aficionado and mobster.

Reviewers noted that Badalamenti&#x27;s ominous score, described as his &quot;darkest yet&quot;, contributes to the sense of mystery as the film opens on the dark-haired woman&#x27;s limousine, that contrasts with the bright, hopeful tones of Betty&#x27;s first arrival in Los Angeles, with the score &quot;acting as an emotional guide for the viewer&quot;. Film music journalist Daniel Schweiger remarks that Badalamenti&#x27;s contribution to the score alternates from the &quot;nearly motionless string dread to noir jazz and audio feedback&quot;, with &quot;the rhythms building to an explosion of infinite darkness.&quot; Badalamenti described a particular technique of sound design applied to the film, by which he would provide Lynch with multiple ten- to twelve-minute tracks at slow tempo, that they called &quot;firewood&quot;, from which Lynch &quot;would take fragments and experiment with them resulting in a lot of film&#x27;s eerie soundscapes.&quot;

Lynch uses two pop songs from the 1960s directly after one another, playing as two actresses are auditioning by lip synching them. According to an analyst of music used in Lynch films, Lynch&#x27;s female characters are often unable to communicate through normal channels and are reduced to lip-synching or being otherwise stifled. Connie Stevens&#x27;s &quot;Sixteen Reasons&quot; is the song being sung while the camera pans backwards to reveal several illusions, and Linda Scott&#x27;s version of &quot;I&#x27;ve Told Ev&#x27;ry Little Star&quot; is the audition for the first Camilla Rhodes, that film scholar Eric Gans considers a song of empowerment for Betty. Originally written by Jerome Kern as a duet, sung by Linda Scott in this rendition by herself, Gans suggests it takes on a homosexual overtone in &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot;. Unlike &quot;Sixteen Reasons&quot;, however, portions of &quot;I&#x27;ve Told Ev&#x27;ry Little Star&quot; are distorted to suggest &quot;a sonic split-identity&quot; for Camilla. When the song plays, Betty has just entered the sound stage where Adam is auditioning actresses for his film, and she sees Adam, locks eyes with him and abruptly flees after Adam has declared &quot;This is the girl&quot; about Camilla, thereby avoiding his inevitable rejection.
At the hinge of the film is a scene in an unusual late night theater called Club Silencio where a performer announces &quot;&quot;No hay banda&quot; (there is no band) ... but yet we hear a band&quot;, variated between English, Spanish and French. Described as &quot;the most original and stunning sequence in an original and stunning film&quot;, Rebekah Del Rio&#x27;s Spanish a cappella rendition of &quot;Crying&quot;, named &quot;Llorando&quot;, is praised as &quot;show-stopping ... except that there&#x27;s no show to stop&quot; in the sparsely attended Club Silencio. Lynch wanted to use Roy Orbison&#x27;s version of &quot;Crying&quot; in &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;, but changed his mind when he heard Orbison&#x27;s &quot;In Dreams&quot;. Del Rio, who popularized the Spanish version and who received her first recording contract on the basis of the song, stated that Lynch flew to Nashville where she was living, and she sang the song for him once and did not know he was recording her. Lynch wrote a part for her in the film and used the version she sang for him in Nashville. The song tragically serenades the lovers Betty and Rita, who sit spellbound and weeping, moments before their relationship disappears and is replaced by Diane and Camilla&#x27;s dysfunction. According to one film scholar, the song and the entire theater scene marks the disintegration of Betty&#x27;s and Rita&#x27;s personalities, as well as their relationship. With the use of multiple languages and a song to portray such primal emotions, one film analyst states that Lynch exhibits his distrust of intellectual discourse and chooses to make sense through images and sounds. The disorienting effect of the music playing although del Rio is no longer there is described as &quot;the musical version of Magritte&#x27;s painting &quot;Ceci n&#x27;est pas une pipe&quot;&quot;.

==Release and reception==
&quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; premiered at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival in May to major critical acclaim. Lynch was awarded the Best Director prize at the festival, sharing it with co-winner Joel Coen for &quot;The Man Who Wasn&#x27;t There&quot;. It drew positive reviews from many critics and some of the strongest audience reactions of Lynch&#x27;s career.

The film was publicized with cryptic posters bearing the abbreviation &quot;Mulholland Dr.&quot;

===Box office===
Universal Pictures released &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; theatrically in 66 theaters in the United States on October 12, 2001, grossing $587,591 over its opening weekend. It eventually expanded to its widest release of 247 theaters, ultimately grossing $7,220,243 at the U.S. box office. TVA Films released the film theatrically in Canada on October 26, 2001. In other territories outside the United States, the film grossed $12,897,096, for a worldwide total of $20,117,339 on the film&#x27;s original release, plus much smaller sums on later re-releases.

===Reception and legacy===
Since its release, &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; has received &quot;both some of the harshest epithets and some of the most lavish praise in recent cinematic history&quot;. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 84% based on 262 reviews, with an average rating of 7.8/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;David Lynch&#x27;s dreamlike and mysterious &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; is a twisty neo-noir with an unconventional structure that features a mesmerizing performance from Naomi Watts as a woman on the dark fringes of Hollywood.&quot; On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 87 out of 100 based on 37 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, who had often been dismissive of Lynch&#x27;s work, awarded the film four stars out of four, writing, &quot;David Lynch has been working toward &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; all of his career, and now that he&#x27;s arrived there I forgive him for &quot;Wild at Heart&quot; and even &quot;Lost Highway&quot;. At last his experiment doesn&#x27;t shatter the test tubes. The movie is a surrealist dreamscape in the form of a Hollywood film noir, and the less sense it makes, the more we can&#x27;t stop watching it&quot;. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Stephen Holden wrote that the film &quot;ranks alongside Fellini&#x27;s &quot;8½&quot; and other auteurist fantasias as a monumental self-reflection&quot; and added: &quot;Looked at lightly, it is the grandest and silliest cinematic carnival to come along in quite some time ... on a more serious level, its investigation into the power of movies pierces a void from which you can hear the screams of a ravenous demon whose appetites can never be slaked.&quot; Edward Guthmann of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; called it &quot;exhilarating ... for its dreamlike images and fierce, frequently reckless imagination&quot; and added, &quot;there&#x27;s a mesmerizing quality to its languid pace, its sense of foreboding and its lost-in-time atmosphere ... it holds us, spellbound and amused, for all of its loony and luscious, exasperating 146 minutes [and] proves that Lynch is in solid form—and still an expert at pricking our nerves&quot;.

In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Peter Travers observed, &quot;&quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; makes movies feel alive again. This sinful pleasure is a fresh triumph for Lynch, and one of the best films of a sorry-ass year. For visionary daring, swooning eroticism and colors that pop like a whore&#x27;s lip gloss, there&#x27;s nothing like this baby anywhere.&quot; J. Hoberman of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; stated, &quot;This voluptuous phantasmagoria ... is certainly Lynch&#x27;s strongest movie since &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; and maybe &quot;Eraserhead&quot;. The very things that failed him in the bad-boy rockabilly debacle of &quot;Lost Highway&quot;—the atmosphere of free-floating menace, pointless transmigration of souls, provocatively dropped plot stitches, gimcrack alternate universes—are here brilliantly rehabilitated.&quot; A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that, while some might consider the plot an &quot;offense against narrative order&quot;, the film is &quot;an intoxicating liberation from sense, with moments of feeling all the more powerful for seeming to emerge from the murky night world of the unconscious&quot;.

Among detractors, Rex Reed of &quot;The New York Observer&quot; said that it was the worst film he had seen in 2001, calling it &quot;a load of moronic and incoherent garbage&quot;. In &quot;New York&quot;, Peter Rainer observed, &quot;Although I like it more than some of his other dreamtime freakfests, it&#x27;s still a pretty moribund ride ... Lynch needs to renew himself with an influx of the deep feeling he has for people, for outcasts, and lay off the cretins and hobgoblins and zombies for a while.&quot; In &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Desson Howe called it &quot;an extended mood opera, if you want to put an arty label on incoherence&quot;. Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; found much to praise—&quot;Lynch cranks up the levels of bizarre humor, dramatic incident and genuine mystery with a succession of memorable scenes, some of which rank with his best&quot;—but also noted, &quot;the film jumps off the solid ground of relative narrative coherence into Lynchian fantasyland ... for the final 45 minutes, Lynch is in mind-twisting mode that presents a form of alternate reality with no apparent meaning or logical connection to what came before. Although such tactics are familiar from &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; and elsewhere, the sudden switcheroo to head games is disappointing because, up to this point, Lynch had so wonderfully succeeded in creating genuine involvement.&quot; James Berardinelli also criticized it, saying: &quot;Lynch cheats his audience, pulling the rug out from under us. He throws everything into the mix with the lone goal of confusing us. Nothing makes any sense because it&#x27;s not supposed to make any sense. There&#x27;s no purpose or logic to events. Lynch is playing a big practical joke on us.&quot; Film theorist Ray Carney notes, &quot;You wouldn&#x27;t need all the emotional back-flips and narrative trap doors if you had anything to say. You wouldn&#x27;t need doppelgangers and shadow-figures if your characters had souls.&quot;

Later, &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; was named the best film of the decade by the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, &quot;Cahiers du cinéma&quot;, IndieWire, &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;, &quot;Reverse Shot&quot;, &quot;The Village Voice&quot; and &quot;Time Out New York&quot;, who asked rhetorically in a reference to the September 11 attacks, &quot;Can there be another movie that speaks as resonantly—if unwittingly—to the awful moment that marked our decade? ... &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; is the monster behind the diner; it&#x27;s the self-delusional dream turned into nightmare.&quot; It was also voted best of the decade in a &quot;Film Comment&quot; poll of international &quot;critics, programmers, academics, filmmakers and others&quot;, and by the magazine&#x27;s readers. It appeared on lists among the ten best films of the decade, coming in third according to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Peter Travers, the Canadian Press, &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; critic Scott Mantz, and eighth on critic Michael Phillips&#x27;s list. In 2010 it was named the second best arthouse film ever by &quot;The Guardian&quot;. The film was voted as the 11th best film set in Los Angeles in the last 25 years by a group of &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; writers and editors with the primary criterion of communicating an inherent truth about the L.A. experience. &quot;Empire&quot; magazine placed &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; at number 391 on their list of the five hundred greatest films ever. It has also been ranked number 38 on the Channel 4 program &quot;50 Films to See Before You Die&quot;. In 2011, online magazine &quot;Slate&quot; named &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; in its piece on &quot;New Classics&quot; as the most enduring film since 2000. Ebert added &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; to his canon of &quot;Great Movies&quot;: &quot;David Lynch loves movies, genres, archetypes and obligatory shots. &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; employs the conventions of film noir in a pure form. One useful definition of noirs is that they&#x27;re about characters who have committed a crime or a sin, are immersed with guilt, and fear they&#x27;re getting what they deserve. Another is that they&#x27;ve done nothing wrong, but it nevertheless certainly appears as if they have. The second describes Hitchcock&#x27;s favorite plot, the Innocent Man Wrongly Accused. The first describes the central dilemma of &quot;Mulholland Dr.&quot; Yet it floats in an uneasy psychic space, never defining who sinned. The film evokes the feeling of noir guilt while never attaching to anything specific. A neat trick. Pure cinema.&quot;

In the British Film Institute&#x27;s 2012 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; poll, &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; was ranked the 28th greatest film ever made, and in the 2022 poll, its ranking rose to 8th. Having received 40 critics&#x27; votes, it is one of only two films from the 21st century to be included in the list, along with 2000&#x27;s &quot;In the Mood for Love&quot;. In a 2015 BBC poll, it was ranked 21st among all American films. The following year, &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; was named as the greatest film of the 21st century in a poll conducted by BBC Culture. In July 2021, the 4K restoration version of &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; was shown in the Cannes Classics section at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival.

===Home media===
The film was released on VHS and DVD by Universal Studios Home Video on April 9, 2002, in the United States and Canada, with few special features. It was released without chapter stops, a feature that Lynch objects to on the grounds that it &quot;demystifies&quot; the film.

Nick Coccellato of Eccentric Cinema gave the film a rating of nine out of ten and the DVD release an eight out of ten, saying that the lack of special features &quot;only adds to the mystery the film itself possesses, in abundance&quot;. Special features in later versions and overseas versions of the DVD include a Lynch interview at the Cannes Film Festival and highlights of the debut of the film at Cannes.

Optimum Home Entertainment released &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; to the European market on Blu-ray as part of its StudioCanal Collection on September 13, 2010. New special features exclusive to this release include: an introduction by Thierry Jousse; &quot;In the Blue Box&quot;, a retrospective documentary featuring directors and critics; two making-of documentaries: &quot;On the Road to Mulholland Drive&quot; and &quot;Back to Mulholland Drive&quot;, and several interviews with people involved in making the film. It is the second David Lynch film in this line of Blu-rays after &quot;The Elephant Man&quot;.

The Criterion Collection has released several versions of &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot;. In October 2015, it released a 2K digital transfer of a restoration of the film on Blu-Ray and DVD, along with interviews, portions of the 2005 edition of Chris Rodley&#x27;s book &quot;Lynch on Lynch&quot;, and other special features. It was Lynch&#x27;s second film to receive a Criterion Collection release on DVD and Blu-ray, following &quot;Eraserhead&quot; in 2014. &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; was part of Criterion&#x27;s first batch of 4K Ultra HD releases in 2021. Although the Blu-ray release was under license from Focus Features and Universal Studios Home Entertainment, Criterion&#x27;s parent company Janus Films subsequently acquired the distribution rights.

===Awards and honors===
Lynch was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Director for the film. From the Hollywood Foreign Press, the film received four Golden Globe nominations in the categories of Best Picture (Drama), Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Original Score. It was named Best Picture by the New York Film Critics Circle at the 2001 New York Film Critics Circle Awards and Online Film Critics Society. Mary Sweeney also won the BAFTA Award for Best Editing for her work on the film.

<text>Mary Magdalene (sometimes called Mary of Magdala, or simply the Magdalene or the Madeleine) was a woman who, according to the four canonical gospels, traveled with Jesus as one of his followers and was a witness to his crucifixion and resurrection. She is mentioned by name twelve times in the canonical gospels, more than most of the apostles and more than any other woman in the gospels, other than Jesus&#x27;s family. Mary&#x27;s epithet &quot;Magdalene&quot; may be a toponymic surname, meaning that she came from the town of Magdala, a fishing town on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee in Roman Judea.

The Gospel of Luke chapter 8 lists Mary Magdalene as one of the women who traveled with Jesus and helped support his ministry &quot;out of their resources&quot;, indicating that she was probably wealthy. The same passage also states that seven demons had been driven out of her, a statement which is repeated from Mark 16. In all four canonical gospels, Mary Magdalene is a witness to the crucifixion of Jesus and, in the Synoptic Gospels, she is also present at his burial. All four gospels identify her, either alone or as a member of a larger group of women, as the first to witness the empty tomb, and, either alone or as a member of a group, as the first to witness Jesus&#x27;s resurrection.

Mary Magdalene is considered to be a saint by the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Anglican, and Lutheran denominations. In 2016, Pope Francis raised the level of liturgical memory on July 22 from memorial to feast, and for her to be referred to as the &quot;Apostle of the apostles&quot;. Some Protestant churches honor her as a heroine of the faith. The Eastern Orthodox Church also commemorates her on the Sunday of the Myrrhbearers, the Orthodox equivalent of one of the Western Three Marys traditions.

==Portrayal in Gnostic writings==
Because she was the first to witness Jesus&#x27;s resurrection, Mary Magdalene is known in some Christian traditions as the &quot;apostle to the apostles&quot;. She is a central figure in Gnostic Christian writings, including the Dialogue of the Savior, the &quot;Pistis Sophia&quot;, the Gospel of Thomas, the Gospel of Philip, and the Gospel of Mary. These texts portray her as an apostle, as Jesus&#x27;s closest and most beloved disciple and the only one who truly understood his teachings. In the Gnostic texts, or Gnostic gospels, Mary&#x27;s closeness to Jesus results in tension with another disciple, Peter, due to her gender and Peter&#x27;s envy of the special teachings given to her. In the Gospel of Philip&#x27;s text, Marvin Meyer&#x27;s translation says (missing text bracketed): &quot;The companion of the [...] is Mary of Magdala. The [...] her more than [...] the disciples, [...] kissed her often on her [...].&quot;

==Life==
It is widely accepted among secular historians that, like Jesus, Mary Magdalene was a real historical figure. Nonetheless, very little is known about her life. Unlike Paul the Apostle, Mary Magdalene left behind no known writings of her own. She was never mentioned in any of the Pauline epistles or in any of the general epistles. The earliest and most reliable sources about her life are the three Synoptic Gospels of Mark, Matthew, and Luke, which were all written during the first century AD.

===During Jesus&#x27;s ministry===
Mary Magdalene&#x27;s epithet &quot;Magdalene&quot; (; ) probably means that she came from Magdala, a village on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee that was primarily known in antiquity as a fishing town. &quot;Mary&quot; was, by far, the most common Jewish given name for girls and women during the first century, so it was necessary for the authors of the gospels to call her &quot;Magdalene&quot; in order to distinguish her from the other women named Mary who followed Jesus. Although the Gospel of Mark, reputed by scholars to be the earliest surviving gospel, does not mention Mary Magdalene until Jesus&#x27;s crucifixion, the Gospel of Luke 8:2–3 provides a brief summary of her role during his ministry:


According to the Gospel of Luke, Jesus exorcised &quot;seven demons&quot; from Mary Magdalene. That seven demons had possessed Mary is repeated in Mark 16:9, part of the &quot;longer ending&quot; of that gospel – this is not found in the earliest manuscripts and is possibly a second-century addition to the original text, possibly based on the Gospel of Luke. In the first century, demons were believed widely to cause physical and psychological illness. Bruce Chilton, a scholar of early Christianity, states that the reference to the number of demons being &quot;seven&quot; may mean that Mary had to undergo seven exorcisms, probably over a long period of time, due to the first six being partially or wholly unsuccessful.

Bart D. Ehrman, a New Testament scholar and historian of early Christianity, contends that the number seven may be merely symbolic, since, in Jewish tradition, seven was the number of completion, so that Mary was possessed by seven demons may simply mean she was completely overwhelmed by their power. In either case, Mary must have suffered from severe emotional or psychological trauma for an exorcism of this kind to have been perceived as necessary. Consequently, her devotion to Jesus resulting from this healing must have been very strong. The Gospels&#x27; writers normally relish giving dramatic descriptions of Jesus&#x27;s public exorcisms, with the possessed person wailing, thrashing, and tearing his or her clothes in front of a crowd. By contrast, that Mary&#x27;s exorcism receives little attention may indicate that either Jesus performed it privately or that the recorders did not perceive it as particularly dramatic.

Because Mary is listed as one of the women who supported Jesus&#x27;s ministry financially, she must have been relatively wealthy. The places where she and the other women are mentioned throughout the gospels indicate strongly that they were vital to Jesus&#x27;s ministry and that Mary Magdalene always appears first, whenever she is listed in the Synoptic Gospels as a member of a group of women, indicates that she was seen as the most important out of all of them. Carla Ricci notes that, in lists of the disciples, Mary Magdalene occupies a similar position among Jesus&#x27;s female followers as Simon Peter does among the male apostles.

That women played such an active and important role in Jesus&#x27;s ministry was not entirely radical or even unique; inscriptions from a synagogue in Aphrodisias in Asia Minor from around the same time period reveal that many of the major donors to the synagogue were women. Jesus&#x27;s ministry did bring women greater liberation than they would typically have held in mainstream Jewish society.

===Witness to Jesus&#x27;s crucifixion and burial===
All four canonical gospels agree that several other women watched Jesus&#x27;s crucifixion from a distance, with three explicitly naming Mary Magdalene as present. lists the names of these women as Mary Magdalene; Mary, mother of James; and Salome. lists Mary Magdalene, Mary mother of James and Joseph, and the unnamed mother of the sons of Zebedee (who may be the same person Mark calls Salome). mentioned a group of women watching the crucifixion, but did not give any of their names. lists Mary, mother of Jesus, her sister, Mary, wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene as witnesses to the crucifixion.

Virtually all reputable historians agree that Jesus was crucified by the Romans under the orders of Pontius Pilate. James Dunn states of baptism and crucifixion that these &quot;two facts in the life of Jesus command almost universal assent&quot;. Nonetheless, the gospels&#x27; accounts of Jesus&#x27;s crucifixion differ. Ehrman states that the presence of Mary Magdalene and the other women at the cross is probably historical because Christians would have been unlikely to make up that the main witnesses to the crucifixion were women and also because their presence is attested in both the Synoptic Gospels and in the Gospel of John independently. Maurice Casey concurs that the presence of Mary Magdalene and the other women at the crucifixion of Jesus may be recorded as an historical fact. According to E. P. Sanders, the reason why the women watched the crucifixion even after the male disciples had fled may have been because they were less likely to be arrested, they were braver than the men, or some combination thereof.
All four canonical gospels, as well as the apocryphal Gospel of Peter, agree that Jesus&#x27;s body was taken down from the cross and buried by a man named Joseph of Arimathea. lists Mary Magdalene and Mary, mother of Joses as witnesses to the burial of Jesus. lists Mary Magdalene and &quot;the other Mary&quot; as witnesses. mentions &quot;the women who had followed him from Galilee&quot;, but does not list any of their names. does not mention any women present during Joseph&#x27;s burial of Jesus, but does mention the presence of Nicodemus, a Pharisee with whom Jesus had a conversation near the beginning of the gospel. Ehrman, who previously accepted the story of Jesus&#x27;s burial as historical, now rejects it as a later invention on the basis that Roman governors almost never allowed for executed criminals to be given any kind of burial and Pontius Pilate in particular was not &quot;the sort of ruler who would break with tradition and policy when kindly asked by a member of the Jewish council to provide a decent burial for a crucified victim&quot;. Casey argues that Jesus was given a proper burial by Joseph of Arimathea, noting that, on some very rare occasions, Roman governors did release the bodies of executed prisoners for burial. Nonetheless, he rejects that Jesus could have been interred in an expensive tomb with a stone rolled in front of it like the one described in the gospels, leading him to conclude that Mary and the other women must not have seen the tomb. Sanders affirms Jesus&#x27;s burial by Joseph of Arimathea in the presence of Mary Magdalene and the other female followers as completely historical.

===Resurrection of Jesus===
The earliest description of Jesus&#x27;s post-resurrection appearances is a quotation of a pre-Pauline creed preserved by Paul the Apostle in , which was written roughly 20 years before any of the gospels. This passage made no mention of Mary Magdalene, the other women, or the story of the empty tomb, but rather credits Simon Peter with having been the first to see the risen Jesus. Despite this, all four canonical gospels, as well as the apocryphal Gospel of Peter, agreed that Mary Magdalene, either alone or as a member of a group, was the first person to discover that Jesus&#x27;s tomb was empty. Nonetheless, the details of the accounts differ drastically.

According to , the earliest account of the discovery of the empty tomb, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome went to the tomb just after sunrise, a day and half after Jesus&#x27;s burial and found that the stone had already been rolled away. They went inside and saw a young man dressed in white, who told them that Jesus had risen from the dead and instructed them to tell the male disciples that he would meet them in Galilee. Instead, the women ran away and told no one, because they were too afraid. The original text of the gospel ends here, without the resurrected Jesus making an appearance to anyone. Casey argues that the reason for this abrupt ending may be because the Gospel of Mark is an unfinished first draft.

According to , Mary Magdalene and &quot;the other Mary&quot; went to the tomb. An earthquake occurred and an angel dressed in white descended from Heaven and rolled aside the stone as the women were watching. The angel told them that Jesus had risen from the dead. Then the risen Jesus himself appeared to the women as they were leaving the tomb and told them to tell the other disciples that he would meet them in Galilee.

According to Mary Magdalene, Joanna, and Mary the mother of James went to the tomb and found the stone already rolled away, as in Mark. They went inside and saw two young men dressed in white who told them that Jesus had risen from the dead. Then they went and told the eleven remaining apostles, who dismissed their story as nonsense. In Luke&#x27;s account, Jesus never appears to the women, but instead makes his first appearance to Cleopas and an unnamed &quot;disciple&quot; on the road to Emmaus. Luke&#x27;s narrative also removes the injunction for the women to tell the disciples to return to Galilee and instead has Jesus tell the disciples &quot;not&quot; to return to Galilee, but rather to stay in the precincts of Jerusalem.
Mary Magdalene&#x27;s role in the resurrection narrative is greatly increased in the account from the Gospel of John. According to , Mary Magdalene went to the tomb when it was still dark and saw that the stone had already been rolled away. She did not see anyone, but immediately ran to tell Peter and the &quot;beloved disciple&quot;, who came with her to the tomb and confirmed that it was empty, but returned home without seeing the risen Jesus. According to , Mary, now alone in the garden outside the tomb, saw two angels sitting where Jesus&#x27;s body had been. Then the risen Jesus approached her. She at first mistook him for the gardener, but, after she heard him say her name, she recognized him and cried out &quot;Rabbouni!&quot; (which is Aramaic for &#x27;teacher&#x27;). His next words may be translated as &quot;Don&#x27;t touch me, for I have not yet ascended to my Father&quot; or &quot;Stop clinging to me, [etc.]&quot;, the latter more probable in view of the grammar (negated present imperative: stop doing something already in progress) as well as Jesus&#x27;s challenge to Thomas a week later (see ). Jesus then sent her to tell the other apostles the good news of his resurrection. The Gospel of John therefore portrays Mary Magdalene as the first apostle, the apostle sent &quot;to&quot; the apostles.

Because scribes were unsatisfied with the abrupt ending of the Gospel of Mark, they wrote several different alternative endings for it. In the &quot;shorter ending&quot;, which is found in very few manuscripts, the women go to &quot;those around Peter&quot; and tell them what they had seen at the tomb, followed by a brief declaration of the gospel being preached from east to west. This &quot;very forced&quot; ending contradicts the last verse of the original gospel, stating that the women &quot;told no one&quot;. The &quot;longer ending&quot;, which is found in most surviving manuscripts, is an &quot;amalgam of traditions&quot; containing episodes derived from the other gospels. First, it describes an appearance by Jesus to Mary Magdalene alone (as in the Gospel of John), followed by brief descriptions of him appearing to the two disciples on the road to Emmaus (as in the Gospel of Luke) and to the eleven remaining disciples (as in the Gospel of Matthew).

In his book published in 2006, Ehrman states that &quot;it appears virtually certain&quot; that the stories of the empty tomb, regardless of whether or not they are accurate, can definitely be traced back to the historical Mary Magdalene, saying that, in Jewish society, women were regarded as unreliable witnesses and were forbidden from giving testimony in court, so early Christians would have had no motive to make up a story about a woman being the first to discover the empty tomb. In fact, if they had made the story up, they would have had strong motivation to make Peter, Jesus&#x27;s closest disciple while he was alive, the discoverer of the tomb instead. He also says that the story of Mary Magdalene discovering the empty tomb is independently attested in the Synoptics, the Gospel of John, and in the Gospel of Peter. N. T. Wright states that, &quot;it is, frankly, impossible to imagine that [the women at the tomb] were inserted into the tradition after Paul&#x27;s day.&quot;

Casey challenges this argument, contending that the women at the tomb are not legal witnesses, but rather heroines in line with a long Jewish tradition. He contends that the story of the empty tomb was invented by either the author of the Gospel of Mark or by one of his sources, based on the historically genuine fact that the women really had been present at Jesus&#x27;s crucifixion and burial. In his book published in 2014, Ehrman rejects his own previous argument, stating that the story of the empty tomb can only be a later invention because there is virtually no possibility that Jesus&#x27;s body could have been placed in any kind of tomb and, if Jesus was never buried, then no one alive at the time could have said that his non-existent tomb had been found empty. He concludes that the idea that early Christians would have had &quot;no motive&quot; to make up the story simply &quot;suffers from a poverty of imagination&quot; and that they would have had all kinds of possible motives, especially since women were overrepresented in early Christian communities and women themselves would have had strong motivation to make up a story about other women being the first to find the tomb. He does conclude later, however, that Mary Magdalene must have been one of the people who had an experience in which she thought she saw the risen Jesus, citing her prominence in the gospel resurrection narratives and her absence everywhere else in the gospels as evidence.

==Apocryphal early Christian writings==

New Testament apocrypha writings mention Mary Magdalene. Some of these writings were cited as scripture by early Christians. However, they were never admitted to the canon of the New Testament. Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Protestant churches generally do not view these writings as part of the Bible. In these apocryphal texts, Mary Magdalene is portrayed as a visionary and leader of the early movement whom Jesus loved more than he loved the other disciples. These texts were written long after the death of the historical Mary Magdalene. They are not regarded by bible scholars as reliable sources of information about her life. Sanders summarizes the scholarly consensus that:

... very, very little in the apocryphal gospels could conceivably go back to the time of Jesus. They are legendary and mythological. Of all the apocryphal material, only some of the sayings in the Gospel of Thomas are worth consideration.
Nonetheless, the texts have been frequently promoted in modern works as though they were reliable. Such works often support sensationalist statements about Jesus and Mary Magdalene&#x27;s relationship.

===Dialogue of the Saviour===

The earliest dialogue between Jesus and Mary Magdalene is probably the Dialogue of the Saviour, a badly damaged Gnostic text discovered in the Nag Hammadi library in 1945. The dialogue consists of a conversation between Jesus, Mary and two apostles – Thomas the Apostle and Matthew the Apostle. In saying 53, the &quot;Dialogue&quot; attributes to Mary three aphorisms that are attributed to Jesus in the New Testament: &quot;The wickedness of each day [is sufficient]. Workers deserve their food. Disciples resemble their teachers.&quot; The narrator commends Mary stating, &quot;she spoke this utterance as a woman who understood everything.&quot;

===&quot;Pistis Sophia&quot;===

The &quot;Pistis Sophia&quot;, possibly dating as early as the second century, is the best surviving of the Gnostic writings. It was discovered in the 18th century in a large volume containing numerous early Gnostic treatises. The document takes the form of a long dialogue in which Jesus answers his followers&#x27; questions. Of the 64 questions, 39 are presented by a woman who is referred to as Mary or Mary Magdalene. At one point, Jesus says, &quot;Mary, thou blessed one, whom I will perfect in all mysteries of those of the height, discourse in openness, thou, whose heart is raised to the kingdom of heaven more than all thy brethren.&quot; At another point, he tells her, &quot;Well done, Mary. You are more blessed than all women on earth, because you will be the fullness of fullness and the completion of completion.&quot; Simon Peter, annoyed at Mary&#x27;s dominance of the conversation, tells Jesus, &quot;My master, we cannot endure this woman who gets in our way and does not let any of us speak, though she talks all the time.&quot; Mary defends herself, saying, &quot;My master, I understand in my mind that I can come forward at any time to interpret what Pistis Sophia [a female deity] has said, but I am afraid of Peter, because he threatens me and hates our gender.&quot; Jesus assures her, &quot;Any of those filled with the spirit of light will come forward to interpret what I say: no one will be able to oppose them.&quot;

===Gospel of Thomas===

The Gospel of Thomas, usually dated to the late first or early second century, was among the ancient texts discovered in the Nag Hammadi library in 1945. The Gospel of Thomas consists entirely of 114 sayings attributed to Jesus. Many of these sayings are similar to ones in the canonical gospels, but others are completely unlike anything found in the New Testament. Some scholars believe that at least a few of these sayings may authentically be traced back to the historical Jesus. Two of the sayings reference a woman named &quot;Mary&quot;, who is generally regarded as Mary Magdalene. In saying 21, Mary herself asks Jesus, &quot;Whom are your disciples like?&quot; Jesus responds, &quot;They are like children who have settled in a field which is not theirs. When the owners of the field come, they will say, &#x27;Let us have back our field.&#x27; They (will) undress in their presence in order to let them have back their field and to give it back to them.&quot; Following this, Jesus continues his explanation with a parable about the owner of a house and a thief, ending with the common rhetoric, &quot;Whoever has ears to hear let him hear.&quot;

Mary&#x27;s mention in saying 114, however, has generated considerable controversy:

In the ancient world, many patriarchal cultures believed that women were inferior to men and that they were, in essence, &quot;imperfect men&quot; who had not fully developed. When Peter challenges Mary&#x27;s authority in this saying, he does so on the widely accepted premise that she is a woman and therefore an inferior human being. When Jesus rebukes him for this, he bases his response on the same premise, stating that Mary and all faithful women like her will &quot;become&quot; men and that salvation is therefore open to all, even those who are presently women.

===Gospel of Philip===

The Gospel of Philip, dating from the second or third century, survives in part among the texts found in Nag Hammadi in 1945. In a manner very similar to , the Gospel of Philip presents Mary Magdalene among Jesus&#x27;s female entourage, adding that she was his &quot;koinônos&quot;, a Greek word variously translated in contemporary versions as &#x27;partner, associate, comrade, companion&#x27;:

The Gospel of Philip uses cognates of &quot;koinônos&quot; and Coptic equivalents to refer to the literal pairing of men and women in marriage and sexual intercourse, but also metaphorically, referring to a spiritual partnership, and the reunification of the Gnostic Christian with the divine realm. The Gospel of Philip also contains another passage relating to Jesus&#x27;s relationship with Mary Magdalene. The text is badly fragmented, and speculated but unreliable additions are shown in brackets:

For early Christians, kissing did not have a romantic connotation and it was common for Christians to kiss their fellow believers as a way of greeting. This tradition is still practiced in many Christian congregations today and is known as the &quot;kiss of peace&quot;. Ehrman explains that, in the context of the Gospel of Philip, the kiss of peace is used as a symbol for the passage of truth from one person to another and that it is not in any way an act of &quot;divine foreplay&quot;.

===Gospel of Mary===

The Gospel of Mary is the only surviving apocryphal text named after a woman. It contains information about the role of women in the early church. The text was probably written over a century after the historical Mary Magdalene&#x27;s death. The text is not attributed to her and its author is anonymous. Instead, it received its title because it is &quot;about&quot; her. The main surviving text comes from a Coptic translation preserved in a fifth-century manuscript (&quot;Berolinensis Gnosticus&quot; 8052,1) discovered in Cairo in 1896. As a result of numerous intervening conflicts, the manuscript was not published until 1955. Roughly half the text of the gospel in this manuscript has been lost; the first six pages and four from the middle are missing. In addition to this Coptic translation, two brief third-century fragments of the gospel in the original Greek (P. Rylands 463 and P. Oxyrhynchus 3525) have also been discovered, which were published in 1938 and 1983 respectively.

The first part of the gospel deals with Jesus&#x27;s parting words to his followers after a post-resurrection appearance. Mary first appears in the second part, in which she tells the other disciples, who are all in fright for their own lives: &quot;Do not weep or grieve or be in doubt, for his grace will be with you all and will protect you. Rather, let us praise his greatness, for he has prepared us and made us truly human.&quot; Unlike in the Gospel of Thomas, where women can only be saved by becoming men, in the Gospel of Mary, they can be saved just as they are. Peter approaches Mary and asks her:

Mary then proceeds to describe the Gnostic cosmology in depth, revealing that she is the only one who has understood Jesus&#x27;s true teachings. Andrew the Apostle challenges Mary, insisting, &quot;Say what you think about what she said, but I do not believe the savior said this. These teachings are strange ideas.&quot; Peter responds, saying, &quot;Did he really speak with a woman in private, without our knowledge? Should we all listen to her? Did he prefer her to us?&quot; Andrew and Peter&#x27;s responses are intended to demonstrate that they do not understand Jesus&#x27;s teachings and that it is really only Mary who truly understands. Matthew the Apostle comes to Mary&#x27;s defense, giving a sharp rebuke to Peter: &quot;Peter, you are always angry. Now I see you arguing against this woman like an adversary. If the savior made her worthy, who are you to reject her? Surely the savior knows her well. That is why he loved her more than us.&quot;

===Borborite scriptures===
The Borborites, also known as the Phibionites, were an early Christian Gnostic sect during the late fourth century who had numerous scriptures involving Mary Magdalene, including &quot;The Questions of Mary&quot;, &quot;The Greater Questions of Mary&quot;, &quot;The Lesser Questions of Mary&quot;, and &quot;The Birth of Mary&quot;. None of these texts have survived to the present, but they are mentioned by the early Christian heretic-hunter Epiphanius of Salamis in his &quot;Panarion&quot;. Epiphanius says that the &quot;Greater Questions of Mary&quot; contained an episode in which, during a post-resurrection appearance, Jesus took Mary to the top of a mountain, where he pulled a woman out of his side and engaged in sexual intercourse with her. Then, upon ejaculating, Jesus drank his own semen and told Mary, &quot;Thus we must do, that we may live.&quot; Upon hearing this, Mary instantly fainted, to which Jesus responded by helping her up and telling her, &quot;O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?&quot; This story was supposedly the basis for the Borborite Eucharist ritual in which they allegedly engaged in orgies and drank semen and menstrual blood as the &quot;body and blood of Christ&quot; respectively. Ehrman casts doubt on the accuracy of Epiphanius&#x27;s summary, commenting that &quot;the details of Epiphanius&#x27;s description sound very much like what you can find in the ancient rumor mill about secret societies in the ancient world&quot;.

==Legacy==

===Patristic era===
Most of the earliest Church Fathers do not mention Mary Magdalene, and those who do mention her usually only discuss her very briefly. In his anti-Christian polemic &quot;The True Word&quot;, written between 170 and 180, the pagan philosopher Celsus declared that Mary Magdalene was nothing more than &quot;a hysterical female... who either dreamt in a certain state of mind and through wishful thinking had a hallucination due to some mistaken notion (an experience which has happened to thousands), or, which is more likely, wanted to impress others by telling this fantastic tale, and so by this cock-and-bull story to provide a chance for other beggars&quot;. The Church Father Origen ( 184 – 253) defended Christianity against this accusation in his apologetic treatise &quot;Against Celsus&quot;, mentioning , which lists Mary Magdalene and &quot;the other Mary&quot; both seeing the resurrected Jesus, thus providing a second witness. Origen also preserves a statement from Celsus that some Christians in his day followed the teachings of a woman named &quot;Mariamme&quot;, who is almost certainly Mary Magdalene. Origen merely dismisses this, remarking that Celsus &quot;pours on us a heap of names&quot;.

A sermon attributed to Hippolytus of Rome ( 170 – 235) refers to Mary of Bethany and her sister Martha seeking Jesus in the garden like Mary Magdalene in , indicating a conflation between Mary of Bethany and Mary Magdalene. The sermon describes the conflated woman as a &quot;second Eve&quot; who compensates for the disobedience of the first Eve through her obedience. The sermon also explicitly identifies Mary Magdalene and the other women as &quot;apostles&quot;. The first clear identification of Mary Magdalene as a redeemed sinner comes from Ephrem the Syrian ( 306 – 373). Part of the reason for the identification of Mary Magdalene as a sinner may derive from the reputation of her birthplace, Magdala, which, by the late first century, was infamous for its inhabitants&#x27; alleged vice and licentiousness.

In one of his preserved sayings, Gregory of Nyssa ( 330 – 395) identifies Mary Magdalene as &quot;the first witness to the resurrection, that she might set straight again by her faith in the resurrection, what was turned over in her transgression&quot;. Ambrose ( 340 – 397), by contrast, not only rejected the conflation of Mary Magdalene, Mary of Bethany, and the anointing sinner, but even proposed that the authentic Mary Magdalene was, in fact, two separate people: one woman named Mary Magdalene who discovered the empty tomb and a different Mary Magdalene who saw the risen Christ. Augustine of Hippo (354–430) entertained the possibility that Mary of Bethany and the unnamed sinner from Luke might be the same person, but did not associate Mary Magdalene with either of them. Instead, Augustine praised Mary Magdalene as &quot;unquestionably... surpassingly more ardent in her love than these other women who had administered to the Lord&quot;.

===Portrayal as a prostitute===
The portrayal of Mary Magdalene as a prostitute began in 591, when Pope Gregory I identified Mary Magdalene, who was introduced in Luke 8:2, with Mary of Bethany (Luke 10:39) and the unnamed &quot;sinful woman&quot; who anointed Jesus&#x27;s feet in Luke 7:36–50. Pope Gregory&#x27;s Easter sermon resulted in a widespread belief that Mary Magdalene was a repentant prostitute or promiscuous woman.

Her reputation in Western Christianity as being a repentant prostitute or loose woman are not supported by the canonical gospels, which at no point imply that she had ever been a prostitute or in any way notable for a sinful way of life. The misconception probably arose due to a conflation between Mary Magdalene, Mary of Bethany (who anoints Jesus&#x27;s feet in ), and the unnamed &quot;sinful woman&quot; who anoints Jesus&#x27;s feet in . As early as the third century, the Church Father Tertullian ( 160 – 225) references the touch of &quot;the woman which was a sinner&quot; in effort to prove that Jesus &quot;was not a phantom, but really a solid body&quot;. This may indicate that Mary Magdalene was already being conflated with the &quot;sinful woman&quot; in , though Tertullian never clearly identifies the woman of whom he speaks as Mary Magdalene.
Elaborate medieval legends from Western Europe then emerged, which told exaggerated tales of Mary Magdalene&#x27;s wealth and beauty, as well as of her alleged journey to southern Gaul (modern-day France). The identification of Mary Magdalene with Mary of Bethany and the unnamed &quot;sinful woman&quot; was still a major controversy in the years leading up to the Reformation, and some Protestant leaders rejected it. During the Counter-Reformation, the Catholic Church emphasized Mary Magdalene as a symbol of penance. In 1969, Pope Paul VI removed the identification of Mary Magdalene with Mary of Bethany and the &quot;sinful woman&quot; from the General Roman Calendar, but the view of her as a former prostitute has persisted in popular culture.

===Early Middle Ages===
The unnamed &quot;sinful woman&quot; in is never identified as a prostitute and, in Jewish society at the time the gospel was written, &quot;sinful&quot; could have simply meant that she &quot;did not assiduously observe the law of Moses&quot;. The notion of Mary Magdalene specifically being a former prostitute or loose woman dates to a narrative in an influential homily by Pope Gregory I (&quot;Gregory the Great&quot;) in around 591, in which he not only identifies Magdalene with the anonymous sinner with the perfume in Luke&#x27;s gospel and with Mary of Bethany, the sister of Martha and Lazarus, but also, for the first time, explicitly identifies her sins as ones of a sexual nature:

In Pope Gregory&#x27;s interpretation, the seven demons expelled from Mary Magdalene by Jesus are transformed into the seven deadly sins of medieval Catholicism, leading Mary &quot;to be condemned not only for lust, but for pride and covetousness as well&quot;. The aspect of the repentant sinner became almost equally significant as the disciple in her &quot;persona&quot; as depicted in Western art and religious literature, fitting well with the great importance of penitence in medieval theology. In subsequent religious legend, Mary&#x27;s story became conflated with that of Mary of Egypt, a repentant prostitute who then lived as a hermit. With that, Mary&#x27;s image was, according to Susan Haskins, author of &quot;Mary Magdalene: Myth and Metaphor&quot;, &quot;finally settled...for nearly fourteen hundred years&quot;, although in fact the most important late medieval popular accounts of her life describe her as a rich woman whose life of sexual freedom is purely for pleasure. This composite depiction of Mary Magdalene was carried into the Mass texts for her feast day: in the Tridentine Mass, the collect explicitly identifies her as Mary of Bethany by describing Lazarus as her brother, and the Gospel is the story of the penitent woman anointing Jesus&#x27;s feet.

The &quot;composite Magdalene&quot; was never accepted by the Eastern Orthodox churches, who saw only Mary the disciple, and believed that after the Resurrection she lived as a companion to Mary the mother of Jesus, and not even in the West was it universally accepted. The Benedictine Order always celebrated Mary of Bethany together with Martha and Lazarus of Bethany on July 29, while Mary Magdalene was celebrated on July 22. Not only John Chrysostom in the East (&quot;Matthew, Homily 88&quot;), but also Ambrose (&quot;De virginitate&quot; 3,14; 4,15) in the West, when speaking of Mary Magdalene after the resurrection of Jesus Christ, far from calling her a harlot, suggest she was a virgin. Starting in around the eighth century, Christian sources record mention of a church in Magdala purported to have been built on the site of Mary Magdalene&#x27;s house, where Jesus exorcized her of the seven demons.

In an eastern tradition supported by the western bishop and historian Gregory of Tours ( 538 – 594), Mary Magdalene is said to have retired to Ephesus in Asia Minor with Mary the mother of Jesus, where they both lived out the rest of their lives. Gregory states that Mary Magdalene was buried in the city of Ephesus. Modestus, the Patriarch of Jerusalem from 630 until 634, describes a slightly different tradition that Mary Magdalene had come to Ephesus to live with the apostle John following the death of Mary the mother of Jesus.

===High Middle Ages===

====Fictional biographies====
Starting in early High Middle Ages, writers in western Europe began developing elaborate fictional biographies of Mary Magdalene&#x27;s life, in which they heavily embellished upon the vague details given in the gospels. Stories about noble saints were popular during this time period; accordingly, tales of Mary Magdalene&#x27;s wealth and social status became heavily exaggerated. In the tenth century, Odo of Cluny ( 880 – 942) wrote a sermon in which he described Mary as an extraordinarily wealthy noblewoman of royal descent. Some manuscripts of the sermon record that Mary&#x27;s parents were named Syrus and Eucharia and one manuscript goes into great detail describing her family&#x27;s purported land holdings in Bethany, Jerusalem, and Magdala.

The theologian Honorius Augustodunensis ( 1080 – 1151) embellished this tale even further, reporting that Mary was a wealthy noblewoman who was married in &quot;Magdalum&quot;, but that she committed adultery, so she fled to Jerusalem and became a &quot;public sinner&quot; (&quot;vulgaris meretrix&quot;). Honorius mentions that, out of love for Jesus, Mary repented and withdrew into a life of quiet isolation. Under the influence of stories about other female saints, such as Mary of Egypt and Pelagia, painters in Italy during the ninth and tenth centuries gradually began to develop the image of Mary Magdalene living alone in the desert as a penitent ascetic. This portrayal became so popular that it quickly spread to Germany and England. From the twelfth century, Abbot Hugh of Semur (died 1109), Peter Abelard (died 1142), and Geoffrey of Vendôme (died 1132) all referred to Mary Magdalene as the sinner who merited the title &quot;apostolorum apostola&quot; (Apostle to the Apostles), with the title becoming commonplace during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.

====Alleged burial in France====
In western Europe, elaborate and conflicting legends began to develop, which said that Mary Magdalene had travelled to southern France and died there. Starting in around 1050, the monks of the Vézelay Abbey of la Madaleine in Burgundy said they discovered Mary Magdalene&#x27;s actual skeleton. At first, the existence of the skeleton was merely asserted, but, in 1265, the monks made a spectacular, public show of &quot;discovering&quot; it and, in 1267, the bones were brought before the king of France, who venerated them. On December 9, 1279, an excavation ordered by Charles II, King of Naples at Saint-Maximin-la-Sainte-Baume, Provence, led to the discovery of another purported burial of Mary Magdalene. The shrine was purportedly found intact, with an explanatory inscription stating why the relics had been hidden. Charles II commissioned the building of a new gothic basilica on the site and, in return for providing accommodation for pilgrims, the town&#x27;s residents were exempt from taxes. Saint-Maximin-la-Sainte-Baume gradually displaced Vézelay in popularity and acceptance.

====&quot;The Golden Legend&quot;====
The most famous account of Mary Magdalene&#x27;s legendary life comes from &quot;The Golden Legend&quot;, a collection of medieval saints&#x27; stories compiled circa 1260 by the Italian writer and Dominican friar Jacobus de Voragine ( 1230 – 1298). In this account, Mary Magdalene is, in Ehrman&#x27;s words, &quot;fabulously rich, insanely beautiful, and outrageously sensual&quot;, but she gives up her life of wealth and sin to become a devoted follower of Jesus. Fourteen years after Jesus&#x27;s crucifixion, some pagans throw Mary, Martha, Lazarus (who, in this account, is their brother due to a conflation with Mary of Bethany), and two other Christians named Maximin and Cedonius onto a rudderless boat in the Mediterranean to die. Miraculously, however, the boat washes ashore at Marseille in southern France. Mary persuades the governor of the city not to offer sacrifices to a pagan god and later persuades him to convert to Christianity after she proves the Christian God&#x27;s power by successfully praying to Him to make the governor&#x27;s wife pregnant. The governor and his wife sail for Rome to meet the apostle Peter in person, but their ship is struck by a storm, which causes the wife to go into labor. The wife dies in childbirth and the governor leaves her on an island with the still-living infant at her breast. The governor spends two years with Peter in Rome and, on his way home, he stops at the same island to discover that, due to Mary Magdalene&#x27;s miraculous long-distance intercession, his child has survived for two years on his dead mother&#x27;s breast milk. Then the governor&#x27;s wife rises from the dead and tells him that Mary Magdalene has brought her back. The whole family returns to Marseille, where they meet Mary again in person. Mary herself spends the last thirty years of her life alone as a penitent ascetic in a cave in a desert in the French region of Provence. At every canonical hour, the angels come and lift her up to hear their songs in Heaven. On the last day of her life, Maximin, now the bishop of Aix, comes to her and gives her the Eucharist. Mary cries tears of joy and, after taking it, she lies down and dies. De Voragine gives the common account of the transfer of Mary Magdalene&#x27;s relics from her sepulchre in the oratory of Saint Maximin at Aix-en-Provence to the newly founded Vézelay; the transportation of the relics is entered as undertaken in 771 by the founder of the abbey, identified as Gerard, Duke of Burgundy.

====Spouse of John the Evangelist====
The monk and historian Domenico Cavalca ( 1270 – 1342), citing Jerome, suggested that Mary Magdalene was betrothed to John the Evangelist: &quot;I like to think that the Magdalene was the spouse of John, not affirming it... I am glad and blythe that St Jerome should say so.&quot; They were sometimes thought to be the couple at the Wedding at Cana, though the Gospel accounts say nothing of the ceremony being abandoned. In the &quot;Golden Legend&quot;, De Voragine dismisses talk of John and Mary being betrothed and John leaving his bride at the altar to follow Jesus as nonsense.

===Late Middle Ages and Renaissance===
The thirteenth-century Cistercian monk and chronicler Peter of Vaux de Cernay said it was part of Catharist belief that the earthly Jesus Christ had a relationship with Mary Magdalene, described as his concubine: &quot;Further, in their secret meetings they said that the Christ who was born in the earthly and visible Bethlehem and crucified at Jerusalem was &quot;evil&quot;, and that Mary Magdalene was his concubine – and that she was the woman taken in adultery who is referred to in the Scriptures.&quot; A document, possibly written by Ermengaud of Béziers, undated and anonymous and attached to his &quot;Treatise against Heretics&quot;, makes a similar statement:

In the middle of the fourteenth century, a Dominican friar wrote a biography of Mary Magdalene in which he described her brutally mutilating herself after giving up prostitution, clawing at her legs until they bled, tearing out clumps of her hair, and beating her face with her fists and her breasts with stones. This portrayal of her inspired the sculptor Donatello ( 1386 – 1466) to portray her as a gaunt and beaten ascetic in his wooden sculpture &quot;Penitent Magdalene&quot; ( 1454) for the Florence Baptistery. In 1449, King René d&#x27;Anjou gave to Angers Cathedral the amphora from Cana in which Jesus changed water to wine, acquiring it from the nuns of Marseilles, who told him that Mary Magdalene had brought it with her from Judea, relating to the legend where she was the jilted bride at the wedding after which John the Evangelist received his calling from Jesus.

===Reformation and Counter-Reformation===
In 1517, on the brink of the Protestant Reformation, the leading French Renaissance humanist Jacques Lefèvre d&#x27;Étaples published his book &quot;De Maria Magdalena et triduo Christi disceptatio&quot; (&quot;Disputation on Mary Magdalene and the Three Days of Christ&quot;), in which he argued against the conflation of Mary Magdalene, Mary of Bethany, and the unnamed sinner in Luke. Various authors published a flurry of books and pamphlets in response, the vast majority of which opposed Lefèvre d&#x27;Étaples. In 1521, the theology faculty of the Sorbonne formally condemned the idea that the three women were separate people as heretical, and debate died down, overtaken by the larger issues raised by Martin Luther. Luther and Huldrych Zwingli (1484–1531) both supported the composite Magdalene. Luther, whose views on sexuality were much more liberal than those of his fellow reformers, reportedly once joked to a group of friends that &quot;even pious Christ himself&quot; had committed adultery three times: once with Mary Magdalene, once with the Samaritan woman at the well, and once with the adulteress he had let off so easily. Because the cult of Mary Magdalene was inextricably associated with the Catholic teaching of the intercession of saints, it came under particularly harsh criticism by Protestant leaders. Zwingli demanded for the cult of Mary Magdalene to be abolished and all images of her to be destroyed. John Calvin (1509–1564) not only rejected the composite Magdalene, but criticized Catholics as ignorant for having ever believed in it.

During the Counter-Reformation, Roman Catholicism began to strongly emphasize Mary Magdalene&#x27;s role as a penitent sinner. Her medieval role as a patron and advocate became minimized and her penitence became regarded as her most important aspect, especially in France and in the Catholic portions of southern Germany. A massive number of Baroque paintings and sculptures depict the penitent Magdalene, often showing her naked or partially naked, with a strong emphasis on her erotic beauty. Poems about Mary Magdalene&#x27;s repentance were also popular. Anton Giulio Brignole-Sale&#x27;s &quot;Maria Maddalena peccatrice convertita&quot; (1636) is considered one of the masterpieces of the 17th-century religious novel, depicting the Magdalen&#x27;s tormented journey to repentance convincingly and with psychological subtlety. Estates of nobles and royalty in southern Germany were equipped with so-called &quot;Magdalene cells&quot;, small, modest hermitages that functioned as both chapels and dwellings, where the nobility could retreat to find religious solace. They were usually located in wild areas away from the rest of the property and their exteriors were designed to suggest vulnerability.

===Modern era===

Because of the legends saying that Mary Magdalene had been a prostitute, she became the patroness of &quot;wayward women&quot;, and, in the eighteenth century, moral reformers established Magdalene asylums to help save women from prostitution. Edgar Saltus&#x27;s historical fiction novel &quot;Mary Magdalene: A Chronicle&quot; (1891) depicts her as a heroine living in a castle at Magdala, who moves to Rome becoming the &quot;toast of the tetrarchy&quot;, telling John the Baptist she will &quot;drink pearls... sup on peacock&#x27;s tongues&quot;. St Peter Julian Eymard calls her &quot;the patroness and model of a life spent in the adoration and service of Jesus in the sacrament of His Love&quot;.

The common identification of Mary Magdalene with other New Testament figures was omitted in the 1969 revision of the General Roman Calendar, with the comment regarding her liturgical celebration on July 22: &quot;No change has been made in the title of today&#x27;s memorial, but it concerns only Saint Mary Magdalene, to whom Christ appeared after his resurrection. It is not about the sister of Saint Martha, nor about the sinful woman whose sins the Lord forgave.&quot; Elsewhere it said of the Roman liturgy of July 22 that &quot;it will make mention neither of Mary of Bethany nor of the sinful woman of Luke 7:36–50, but only of Mary Magdalene, the first person to whom Christ appeared after his resurrection&quot;. According to historian Michael Haag, these changes were a quiet admission from the Vatican that the Church&#x27;s previous teaching of Mary Magdalene as a repentant whore had been wrong. Mary of Bethany&#x27;s feast day and that of her brother Lazarus is now on July 29, the memorial of their sister Martha.

Nonetheless, despite the Vatican&#x27;s rejection of it, the view of Mary as a repentant prostitute only grew more prevalent in popular culture. She is portrayed as one in Nikos Kazantzakis&#x27;s 1955 novel &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot; and Martin Scorsese&#x27;s 1988 film adaptation of it, in which Jesus, as he is dying on the cross, has a vision from Satan of what it would be like if he married Mary Magdalene and raised a family with her instead of dying for humanity&#x27;s sins. Mary is likewise portrayed as a reformed prostitute in Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice&#x27;s 1971 rock opera &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;. In &quot;Superstar&quot;, Mary describes her sexual attraction to Jesus in the song &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know How to Love Him&quot;, which shocked many of the play&#x27;s original viewers. Ki Longfellow&#x27;s novel &quot;The Secret Magdalene&quot; (2005) draws on the Gnostic gospels and other sources to portray Mary as a brilliant and dynamic woman who studies at the fabled library of Alexandria, and shares her knowledge with Jesus. Lady Gaga&#x27;s song &quot;Judas&quot; (2011) is sung from Mary&#x27;s perspective, portraying her as a prostitute who is &quot;beyond repentance&quot;.

The 2018 film &quot;Mary Magdalene&quot;, starring Rooney Mara as the eponymous character, sought to reverse the centuries-old portrayal of Mary Magdalene as a repentant prostitute, while also combating the conspiracy statements of her being Jesus&#x27;s wife or sexual partner. Instead, the film portrays her as Jesus&#x27;s closest disciple and the only one who truly understands his teachings. This portrayal is partially based on the Gnostic &quot;Gospel of Mary Magdalene&quot;. The film, which has been described as having a &quot;strongly feminist bent&quot;, was praised for its music score and cinematography, its surprising faithfulness to the Biblical narrative, and its acting, but was criticized as slow-moving, overwritten, and too solemn to be believable. It was also criticized by many Christians, who were offended by the film&#x27;s use of extracanonical source material.

===In Western art===
The early notion of Mary Magdalene as a sinner and adulteress was reflected in Western medieval Christian art, where she was the most commonly depicted female figure after the Virgin Mary. She may be shown either as very extravagantly and fashionably dressed, unlike other female figures wearing contemporary styles of clothes, or alternatively as completely naked but covered by very long blonde or reddish-blonde hair. The latter depictions represent the &quot;Penitent Magdalene&quot;, according to the medieval legend that she had spent a period of repentance as a desert hermit after leaving her life as a follower of Jesus. Her story became conflated in the West with that of Mary of Egypt, a fourth-century prostitute turned hermit, whose clothes wore out and fell off in the desert. The widespread artistic representations of Mary Magdalene in tears are the source of the modern English word &quot;maudlin&quot;, meaning &#x27;sickeningly sentimental or emotional&#x27;.

In medieval depictions Mary&#x27;s long hair entirely covers her body and preserves her modesty (supplemented in some German versions such as one by Tilman Riemenschneider by thick body hair), but, from the sixteenth century, some depictions, like those by Titian, show part of her naked body, the amount of nudity tending to increase in successive periods. Even if covered, she often wears only a drape pulled around her, or an undergarment. In particular, Mary is often shown naked in the legendary scene of her &quot;Elevation&quot;, where she is sustained in the desert by angels who raise her up and feed her heavenly manna, as recounted in the &quot;Golden Legend&quot;.

Mary Magdalene at the foot of the cross during the Crucifixion appears in an eleventh-century English manuscript &quot;as an expressional device rather than a historical motif&quot;, intended as &quot;the expression of an emotional assimilation of the event, that leads the spectator to identify himself with the mourners&quot;. Other isolated depictions occur, but, from the thirteenth century, additions to the Virgin Mary and John as the spectators at the Crucifixion become more common, with Mary Magdalene as the most frequently found, either kneeling at the foot of the cross clutching the shaft, sometimes kissing Christ&#x27;s feet, or standing, usually at the left and behind Mary and John, with her arms stretched upwards towards Christ in a gesture of grief, as in a damaged painting by Cimabue in the upper church at Assisi of 1290. A kneeling Magdalene by Giotto in the Scrovegni Chapel ( 1305) was especially influential. As Gothic painted crucifixions became crowded compositions, the Magdalene became a prominent figure, with a halo and identifiable by her long unbound blonde hair, and usually a bright red dress. As the swooning Virgin Mary became more common, generally occupying the attention of John, the unrestrained gestures of Magdalene increasingly represented the main display of the grief of the spectators.

According to Robert Kiely, &quot;No figure in the Christian Pantheon except Jesus, the Virgin Mary, and John the Baptist has inspired, provoked, or confounded the imagination of painters more than the Magdalene.&quot; Apart from the Crucifixion, Mary was often shown in scenes of the Passion of Jesus, when mentioned in the Gospels, such as the Crucifixion, Christ Carrying the Cross and Noli me Tangere, but usually omitted in other scenes showing the Twelve Apostles, such as the Last Supper. As Mary of Bethany, she is shown as present at the Resurrection of Lazarus, her brother, and in the scene with Jesus and her sister Martha, which began to be depicted often in the seventeenth century, as in &quot;Christ in the House of Martha and Mary&quot; by Velázquez.

==Religious views==
===Eastern Orthodox===
The Eastern Orthodox Church has never identified Mary Magdalene with Mary of Bethany or the &quot;sinful woman&quot; who anoints Jesus in Luke 7:36–50 and has always taught that Mary was a virtuous woman her entire life, even before her conversion. They have never celebrated her as a penitent. Mary Magdalene&#x27;s image did not become conflated with other women mentioned in Biblical texts until Pope Gregory the Great&#x27;s sermon in the sixth century, and even then this only occurred in Western traditions. Instead, she has traditionally been honored as a &quot;Myrrhbearer&quot; (Μυροφόρος; the equivalent of the western Three Marys) and &quot;Equal to the Apostles&quot; (ἰσαπόστολος). For centuries, it has been the custom of many Eastern Orthodox Christians to share dyed and painted eggs, particularly on Easter Sunday. The eggs represent new life, and Christ bursting forth from the tomb. Among Eastern Orthodox Christians this sharing is accompanied by the proclamation &quot;Christ is risen!&quot; One folk tradition concerning Mary Magdalene says that following the death and resurrection of Jesus, she used her position to gain an invitation to a banquet given by the Roman emperor Tiberius in Rome. When she met him, she held a plain egg in her hand and exclaimed, &quot;Christ is risen!&quot;. The emperor laughed, and said that Christ rising from the dead was as likely as the egg in her hand turning red while she held it. Before he finished speaking, the egg in her hand turned a bright red and she continued proclaiming the Gospel to the entire imperial house.

===Roman Catholicism===
During the Counter-Reformation and Baroque periods (late 16th and 17th centuries), the description &quot;penitent&quot; was added to the indication of her name on her feast day, July 22. It had not yet been added at the time of the Tridentine calendar of 1569 and is no longer found in the present General Roman Calendar but, once added, it remained until the General Roman Calendar of 1960. The Gospel reading in the Tridentine Mass was Luke 7:36–50 (the sinful woman anointing the feet of Jesus), while in the present version of the Roman Rite of Mass it is John 20:1–2, 11–18 (meeting of Mary Magdalene with Jesus after his resurrection).
According to Darrell Bock, the title of &quot;apostola apostolorum&quot; first appears in the 10th century, but Katherine Ludwig Jansen says she found no reference to it earlier than the 12th century, by which time it was already commonplace. She mentions in particular Hugh of Cluny (1024–1109), Peter Abelard (1079–1142), and Bernard of Clairvaux (1090–1153) among those who gave Mary Magdalene the title of &quot;apostolorum apostola&quot; (apostle of the apostles). Jane Schaberg adds Geoffrey of Vendôme (/70 – 1132).

The equivalent of the phrase &quot;apostolorum apostola&quot; may have appeared already in the 9th century. Chapter XXVII of the &quot;Life of Mary Magdalene&quot; attributed to Hrabanus Maurus (c. 780 – 784 February 856) is headed: &quot;Ubi Magdalenam Christus ad apostolos mittit apostolam&quot; (Wherein Christ sends Magdalene as an apostle to the apostles). The same chapter says she did not delay in exercising the office of apostolate with which he had been honored (&quot;apostolatus officio quo honorata fuerat fungi non distulit&quot;). Raymond E. Brown, commenting on this fact, remarks that Hrabanus Maurus frequently applies the word &quot;apostle&quot; to Mary Magdalene in this work. However the work is actually no earlier than the 12th century. Because of Mary Magdalene&#x27;s position as an apostle, though not one of those who became official witnesses to the resurrection, the Catholic Church honored her by reciting the Gloria on her feast day – the only female saint so honored apart from Mary, the mother of Jesus. In his apostolic letter &quot;Mulieris Dignitatem&quot; (&quot;On the dignity and vocation of women&quot;, parts 67–69) dated August 15, 1988, Pope John Paul II dealt with the Easter events in relation to the women being present at the tomb after the Resurrection, in a section entitled &#x27;First Witnesses of the Resurrection&#x27;:
 On June 10, 2016, the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments issued a decree which elevated Mary&#x27;s liturgical commemoration from an obligatory memorial to a feast day, like that of most of the Apostles (Peter and Paul are jointly commemorated with a solemnity). The Mass and Liturgy of the Hours (Divine Office) remain the same as they were, except that a specific preface was added to the Mass to refer to her explicitly as the &quot;Apostle to the Apostles&quot;.

===Protestantism===
The 1549 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; had on July 22 a feast of Saint Mary Magdalene, with the same Scripture readings as in the Tridentine Mass and with a newly composed collect: &quot;Merciful father geue us grace, that we neuer presume to synne through the example of anye creature, but if it shall chaunce vs at any tyme to offende thy dyuine maiestie: that then we maye truly repent, and lament the same, after the example of Mary Magdalene, and by lyuelye faythe obtayne remission of all oure sinnes: throughe the onely merites of thy sonne oure sauiour Christ.&quot; The 1552 edition omitted the feast of Saint Mary Magdalene, which was restored to the Book of Common Prayer only after some 400 years.

Modern Protestants honor her as a disciple and friend of Jesus. Anglican Christians refer to her as a saint and may follow her example of repentance; While some interpret the Thirty-Nine Articles as forbidding them to call upon her for intercession, other Anglicans, citing the Episcopal burial service, say they can ask the saint to pray for them.

The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America honors Mary Magdalene on July 22 as an apostle. Her feast day is marked as a lesser festival, which are defined as &quot;days when we celebrate the life of Christ, the witness of those who accompanied and testified to him, and the gifts of God in the church&quot;.

Presbyterians honor her as the &quot;apostle to the apostles&quot; and, in the book &quot;Methodist Theology&quot;, Kenneth Wilson describes her as, &quot;in effect&quot;, one of the &quot;first missionaries&quot;.

Mary Magdalene is remembered in the Church of England with a Festival and in the Episcopal Church with a Major Feast on July 22.

===Baháʼí Faith===
There are many references to Mary Magdalene in the writings of the Baháʼí Faith, where she enjoys an exalted status as a heroine of faith and the &quot;archetypal woman of all cycles&quot;. `Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá, the son of the founder of the religion, said that she was &quot;the channel of confirmation&quot; to Jesus&#x27;s disciples, a &quot;heroine&quot; who &quot;re-established the faith of the apostles&quot; and was &quot;a light of nearness in his kingdom&quot;. `Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá also wrote that &quot;her reality is ever shining from the horizon of Christ&quot;, &quot;her face is shining and beaming forth on the horizon of the universe forevermore&quot; and that &quot;her candle is, in the assemblage of the world, lighted till eternity&quot;. `Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá considered her to be the supreme example of how women are completely equal with men in the sight of God and can at times even exceed men in holiness and greatness. Indeed he said that she surpassed all the men of her time, and that &quot;crowns studded with the brilliant jewels of guidance&quot; were upon her head.

The Baháʼí writings also expand upon the scarce references to her life in the canonical Gospels, with a wide array of extra-canonical stories about her and sayings which are not recorded in any other extant historical sources. `Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá said that Mary traveled to Rome and spoke before the emperor Tiberius, which is presumably why Pilate was later recalled to Rome for his cruel treatment of the Jews (a tradition also attested to in the Eastern Orthodox Church). Baháʼís have noted parallels between Mary Magdalene and the Babí heroine-poet Táhirih. The two are similar in many respects, with Mary Magdalene often being viewed as a Christian antecedent of the latter, while Táhirih in her own right could be described as the spiritual return of the Magdalene; especially given their common, shared attributes of &quot;knowledge, steadfastness, courage, virtue and will power&quot;, in addition to their importance within the religious movements of Christianity and the Baháʼí Faith as female leaders.

==Relics==

Many of the alleged relics of the saint are held in Catholic churches in France, especially at Saint-Maximin-la-Sainte-Baume, where her skull (see above) and the &quot;noli me tangere&quot; are on display; the latter being a piece of forehead flesh and skin said to be from the spot touched by Jesus at the post-resurrection encounter in the garden. A tibia also kept at Saint-Maximin-la-Sainte-Baume is the object of an annual procession.

Her left hand relic is kept in the Simonopetra Monastery on Mount Athos.

==Speculations==

In 1998, Ramon K. Jusino proposed an unprecedented argument that the &quot;Beloved Disciple&quot; of the Gospel of John is Mary Magdalene. Jusino based his argument largely on the Nag Hammadi Gnostic books, rejecting the view of Raymond E. Brown that these books were later developments, and maintaining instead that the extant Gospel of John is the result of modification of an earlier text that presented Mary Magdalene as the Beloved Disciple. The gospel, at least in its current form, clearly and consistently identifies the disciple as having masculine gender, only ever referring to him using words inflected in the masculine. There are no textual variants in extant New Testament manuscripts to contradict this, and thus no physical evidence of this hypothetical earlier document. Richard J. Hooper does not make the Jusino thesis his own, but says: &quot;Perhaps we should not altogether reject the possibility that some Johannine Christians considered Mary Magdalene to be &#x27;the disciple whom Jesus loved&#x27;.&quot; Esther A. de Boer likewise presents the idea as &quot;one possibility among others&quot;, not as a definitive solution to the problem of the identity of the anonymous disciple. There is a theological interpretation of Mary as the Magdala, &quot;The Elegant Tower&quot; and certain churches honor her as a heroine of the faith in their teachings.

Dan Brown&#x27;s 2003 bestselling mystery thriller novel &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; popularized a number of erroneous ideas about Mary Magdalene, including that she was a member of the tribe of Benjamin, that she was Jesus&#x27;s wife, that she was pregnant at the crucifixion, and that she gave birth to Jesus&#x27;s child, who became the founder of a bloodline which survives to this very day. There is no historical evidence (from the canonical or apocryphal gospels, other early Christian writings, or any other ancient sources) to support these statements. &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; also purports that the figure of the &quot;beloved disciple&quot; to Jesus&#x27;s right in Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s &quot;Last Supper&quot; is Mary Magdalene, disguised as one of the male disciples; art historians maintain that the figure is, in reality, the apostle John, who only appears feminine due to Leonardo&#x27;s characteristic fascination with blurring the lines between the sexes, a quality which is found in his other paintings, such as &quot;Saint John the Baptist&quot; (painted 1513 – 1516). Furthermore, according to Ross King, an expert on Italian art, Mary Magdalene&#x27;s appearance at the last supper would not have been controversial and Leonardo would have had no motive to disguise her as one of the other disciples, since she was widely venerated in her role as the &quot;apostle to the apostles&quot; and patron of the Dominican Order, for whom &quot;The Last Supper&quot; was painted. There would have even been precedent for it, since the earlier Italian Renaissance painter Fra Angelico had included her in his painting of the Last Supper. Numerous works were written in response to the historical inaccuracies in &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;, but the novel still exerted massive influence on how members of the general public viewed Mary Magdalene.

In 2012, scholar Karen L. King published the Gospel of Jesus&#x27;s Wife, a purported Coptic papyrus fragment in which Jesus says: &quot;My wife ... she will be able to be my disciple.&quot; The overwhelming consensus of scholars is that the fragment is a modern forgery, and in 2016, King herself said that the alleged Gospel was probably a forgery.

Ehrman states that the historical sources reveal absolutely nothing about Jesus&#x27;s sexuality and that there is no evidence whatsoever to support the idea that Jesus and Mary Magdalene were married or that they had any kind of sexual or romantic relationship. None of the canonical gospels imply such a thing and, even in the late Gnostic gospels, where Mary is shown as Jesus&#x27;s closest disciple, the relationship between them is not sexual. The extremely late &quot;Greater Questions of Mary&quot;, which has not survived, allegedly portrayed Mary not as Jesus&#x27;s wife or partner, but rather as an unwilling voyeur. Ehrman says that the Essenes, a contemporary Jewish sect who shared many views with Jesus, and the apostle Paul, Jesus&#x27;s later follower, both lived in unmarried celibacy, so it is not unreasonable to conclude that Jesus did as well.

Furthermore, according to , Jesus taught that marriage would not exist at all in the coming kingdom of God. Since Jesus taught that people should live as though the kingdom had already arrived, this teaching implied a life of unmarried celibacy. Ehrman says that, if Jesus had been married to Mary Magdalene, the authors of the gospels would definitely have mentioned it, since they mention all his other family members, including his mother Mary, his father Joseph, his four brothers, and his at least two sisters.

Maurice Casey rejects the idea of Mary Magdalene as Jesus&#x27;s wife as nothing more than wild popular sensationalism. Jeffrey J. Kripal writes that &quot;the historical sources are simply too contradictory and simultaneously too silent&quot; to make absolute declarations regarding Jesus&#x27;s sexuality.

<text>Mary of Bethany is a biblical figure mentioned by name in the Gospel of John and probably the Gospel of Luke in the Christian New Testament. Together with her siblings Lazarus and Martha, she is described as living in the village of Bethany, a small village in Judaea to the south of the Mount of Olives near Jerusalem.

Western Christianity initially identified Mary of Bethany with Mary Magdalene and the sinful woman of Luke 7 (). This influenced the Roman Rite liturgy of the feast of Mary Magdalene, with a Gospel reading about the sinful woman and a collect referring to Mary of Bethany. After the liturgical revision in 1969 and 2021, the feast of Mary Magdalene continues to be on 22 July, while Mary of Bethany is celebrated as a separate saint, along with her siblings Lazarus and Martha on 29 July. In Eastern Christianity and some Protestant traditions, Mary of Bethany and Mary Magdalene are also considered separate persons. The Eastern Orthodox Church has its own traditions regarding Mary of Bethany&#x27;s life beyond the gospel accounts.

==Biblical references==
=== Gospel of John ===

In the Gospel of John, a Mary appears in connection to two incidents: the raising from the dead of her brother Lazarus and the anointing of Jesus. The identification of this being the same Mary in both incidents is given explicitly by the author: &quot;Now a man named Lazarus was sick. He was from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha. This Mary, whose brother Lazarus now lay sick, was the same one who poured perfume on the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair.&quot; The mention of her sister Martha suggests a connection with the woman named Mary in Luke 10:38-42.

In the account of the raising of Lazarus, Jesus meets with the sisters in turn: Martha followed by Mary. Martha goes immediately to meet Jesus as he arrives, while Mary waits until she is called. As one commentator notes, &quot;Martha, the more aggressive sister, went to meet Jesus, while quiet and contemplative Mary stayed home. This portrayal of the sisters agrees with that found in Luke 10:38–42.&quot; When Mary meets Jesus, she falls at his feet. In speaking with Jesus, both sisters lament that he did not arrive in time to prevent their brother&#x27;s death: &quot;Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.&quot; But where Jesus&#x27; response to Martha is one of teaching, calling her to hope and faith, his response to Mary is more emotional: &quot;When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come along with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled. As the 17th century Welsh commentator Matthew Henry notes, &quot;Mary added no more, as Martha did; but it appears, by what follows, that what she fell short in words she made up in tears; she said less than Martha, but wept more.&quot;

===Anointing of Jesus===

A narrative in which Mary of Bethany plays a central role is the anointing of Jesus, an event reported in the Gospel of John in which a woman pours the entire contents of an alabastron of very expensive perfume over the feet of Jesus. Only in this account is the woman identified as Mary, with the earlier reference in establishing her as the sister of Martha and Lazarus.

The woman&#x27;s name is not given in the Gospels of Matthew and Mark, but the event is likewise placed in Bethany, specifically at the home of one Simon the Leper, a man whose significance is not explained elsewhere in the gospels.

According to the Markan account, the perfume was the purest of spikenard. Some of the onlookers were angered because this expensive perfume could have been sold for a year&#x27;s wages, which Mark enumerates as 300 denarii, and the money given to the poor. The Gospel of Matthew states that the &quot;disciples were indignant&quot; and John&#x27;s gospel states that it was Judas Iscariot who was most offended (which is explained by the narrator as being because Judas was a thief and desired the money for himself). In the accounts, Jesus justifies Mary&#x27;s action by stating that they would always have the poor among them and would be able to help them whenever they desired, but that he would not always be with them and says that her anointing was done to prepare him for his burial. As one commentator notes, &quot;Mary seems to have been the only one who was sensitive to the impending death of Jesus and who was willing to give a material expression of her esteem for him. Jesus&#x27; reply shows his appreciation of her act of devotion.&quot; The accounts in Matthew and Mark adds these words of Jesus, &quot;I tell you the truth, wherever this gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her&quot;.

Easton (1897) noted that it would appear from the circumstances that the family of Lazarus possessed a family vault and that a large number of Jews from Jerusalem came to console them on the death of Lazarus, that this family at Bethany belonged to the wealthier class of the people. This would help explain how Mary of Bethany could afford to possess quantities of expensive perfume.

A similar anointing is described in the Gospel of Luke as occurring at the home of one Simon the Pharisee in which a woman who had been sinful all her life, and who was crying, anointed Jesus&#x27; feet and, when her tears started to fall on his feet, she wiped them with her hair. Luke&#x27;s account (as well as John&#x27;s) differs from that of Matthew and Mark by relating that the anointing is to the feet rather than the head. Although it is a subject of considerable debate, many scholars hold that these actually describe two separate events.

Jesus&#x27; response to the anointing in Luke is completely different from that recorded in the other gospels to the anointing in their accounts. Rather than Jesus&#x27; above-mentioned comments on the &quot;poor you will always have with you&quot;, in Luke he tells his host the Parable of the Two Debtors. As one commentator notes, &quot;Luke is the only one to record the parable of the two debtors, and he chooses to preserve it in this setting. ...If one considers the other gospel accounts as a variation of the same event, it is likely that the parable is not authentically set. Otherwise, the powerful message from the parable located in this setting would likely be preserved elsewhere, too. However, if one considers the story historically accurate, happening in Jesus&#x27; life apart from the similar incidents recorded in the other gospels, the question of the authenticity of the parable receives a different answer. ...John Nolland, following Wilckens&#x27; ideas, writes: &#x27;There can hardly be a prior form of the episode not containing the present parable, since this would leave the Pharisee&#x27;s concerns of v 39 with no adequate response&#x27;.&quot;

=== Luke 10 ===

In chapter 10 of the Gospel of Luke, Jesus visits the home of two sisters named Mary and Martha, living in an unnamed village. Mary is contrasted with her sister Martha, who was &quot;cumbered about many things&quot; while Jesus was their guest, while Mary had chosen &quot;the better part&quot;, that of listening to the master&#x27;s discourse.
For Mary to sit at Jesus&#x27; feet, and for him to allow her to do so, was itself controversial. In doing so, as one commentator notes, Mary took &quot;the place of a disciple by sitting at the feet of the teacher. It was unusual for a woman in first-century Judaism to be accepted by a teacher as a disciple.&quot;

Most Christian commentators have been ready to assume that the two occurrences of sisters named as Mary and Martha refer the same pair of sisters.

==Medieval Western identification with Mary Magdalene==
In medieval Western Christian tradition, Mary of Bethany was identified as Mary Magdalene perhaps in large part because of a homily given by Pope Gregory the Great in which he taught about several women in the New Testament as though they were the same person. This led to a conflation of Mary of Bethany with Mary Magdalene as well as with another woman (beside Mary of Bethany who anointed Jesus), and the woman caught in adultery. Eastern Christianity never adopted this identification. In his article in the 1910 &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;, Hugh Pope stated, &quot;The Greek Fathers, as a whole, distinguish the three persons: the &#x27;sinner&#x27; of ; the sister of Martha and Lazarus, and ; and Mary Magdalen.&quot;

Father Hugh Pope enumerated the accounts of each of these three persons (the unnamed &quot;sinner&quot;, Mary Magdalene, and Mary of Bethany) in the Gospel of Luke and concluded that, based on these accounts, &quot;there is no suggestion of an identification of the three persons, and if we had only Luke to guide us we should certainly have no grounds for so identifying them [as the same person].&quot; He then explains first the position, at that time general among Catholics, equating Mary of Bethany with the sinful woman of Luke by referring to , where Mary is identified as the woman who anointed Jesus, and noting that this reference is given before John&#x27;s account of the anointing in Bethany:

John, however, clearly identifies Mary of Bethany with the woman who anointed Christ&#x27;s feet (12; cf. and ). It is remarkable that already in , John has spoken of Mary as &quot;she that anointed the Lord&#x27;s feet&quot;, &quot;he aleipsasa&quot;. It is commonly said that he refers to the subsequent anointing which he himself describes in ; but it may be questioned whether he would have used &quot;he aleipsasa&quot; if another woman, and she a &quot;sinner&quot; in the city, had done the same. It is conceivable that John, just because he is writing so long after the event and at a time when Mary was dead, wishes to point out to us that she was really the same as the &quot;sinner&quot;. In the same way Luke may have veiled her identity precisely because he did not wish to defame one who was yet living; he certainly does something similar in the case of St. Matthew whose identity with Levi the publican (5:27) he conceals. If the foregoing argument holds good, Mary of Bethany and the &quot;sinner&quot; are one and the same.

Hugh Pope then explained the identification of Mary of Bethany with Mary Magdalene by the presumption that, because of Jesus&#x27; high praise of her deed of anointing him, it would be incredible that she should also not have been at his crucifixion and resurrection. Since Mary Magdalene is reported to have been present on those occasions, by this reasoning, she must therefore be the same person as Mary of Bethany:

An examination of John&#x27;s Gospel makes it almost impossible to deny the identity of Mary of Bethany with Mary Magdalen. From John we learn the name of the &quot;woman&quot; who anointed Christ&#x27;s feet previous to the last supper. We may remark here that it seems unnecessary to hold that because Matthew and Mark say &quot;two days before the Passover&quot;, while John says &quot;six days&quot; there were, therefore, two distinct anointings following one another. John does not necessarily mean that the supper and the anointing took place six days before, but only that Christ came to Bethany six days before the Passover. At that supper, then, Mary received the glorious encomium, &quot;she hath wrought a good work upon Me. ...In pouring this ointment upon My body she hath done it for My burial. ...Wheresoever this Gospel shall be preached ... that also which she hath done shall be told for a memory of her.&quot; Is it credible, in view of all this, that this Mary should have no place at the foot of the cross, nor at the tomb of Christ? Yet it is Mary Magdalen who, according to all the Evangelists, stood at the foot of the cross and assisted at the entombment and was the first recorded witness of the Resurrection. And while John calls her &quot;Mary Magdalen&quot; in 19:25, 20:1, and 20:18, he calls her simply &quot;Mary&quot; in 20:11 and 20:16.

French scholar Victor Saxer dates the identification of Mary Magdalene as a prostitute, and as Mary of Bethany, to a sermon by Pope Gregory the Great on 21 September 591 A.D., where he seemed to combine the actions of three women mentioned in the New Testament and also identified an unnamed woman as Mary Magdalene. In another sermon, Gregory specifically identified Mary Magdalene as the sister of Martha mentioned in Luke 10. But according to a view expressed more recently by theologian Jane Schaberg, Gregory only put the final touch to a legend that already existed before him.

Western Christianity&#x27;s identification of Mary Magdalene and Mary of Bethany was reflected in the arrangement of the General Roman Calendar, until this was altered in 1969, reflecting the fact that by then the common interpretation in the Catholic Church was that Mary of Bethany, Mary Magdalene and the sinful woman who anointed the feet of Jesus were three distinct women.

==Eastern Orthodox tradition==
In Orthodox Church tradition, Mary of Bethany is honored as a separate individual from Mary Magdalene. Though they are not specifically named as such in the gospels, the Orthodox Church counts Mary and Martha among the Myrrh-bearing Women. These faithful followers of Jesus stood at Golgotha during the Crucifixion of Jesus and later came to his tomb early on the morning following the Sabbath with myrrh (expensive oil), according to the Jewish tradition, to anoint their Lord&#x27;s body. The Myrrhbearers became the first witnesses to the Resurrection of Jesus, finding the empty tomb and hearing the joyful news from an angel.

Orthodox tradition also relates that Mary&#x27;s brother Lazarus was cast out of Jerusalem in the persecution against the Jerusalem Church following the martyrdom of St. Stephen. His sisters Mary and Martha fled Judea with him, assisting him in the proclaiming of the Gospel in various lands. According to Cyprian tradition, the three later moved to Cyprus, where Lazarus became the first Bishop of Kition (modern Larnaca).

==Later life==

There are several traditions surrounding the later life of Mary of Bethany. One tradition holds that she traveled to Ephesus with the Apostle John and lived there until her death. Another tradition suggests that she went to France with Lazarus and Martha, and may have settled in the town of Tarascon, where she is still venerated as a saint.

==Commemoration as a saint==

In the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church, Mary of Bethany is celebrated, together with her brother Lazarus, on 29 July, the memorial of their sister Martha. In 2021, the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments added their names to the memorial, making it a liturgical celebration of all three family members.

Also in the Calendar of Saints of the Lutheran Church, 29 July is the date of the commemoration of Mary (together with Martha and Lazarus), as is the case in the Calendar of saints of the Episcopal Church and the Church of England (together with Martha).

She is commemorated in the Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Rite Eastern Catholic Churches with her sister Martha on 4 June, as well as on the Sunday of the Myrrhbearers (the Third Sunday of Pascha). She also figures prominently in the commemorations on Lazarus Saturday (the day before Palm Sunday).

Mary is remembered (with Martha and Lazarus) in the Church of England with a Lesser Festival on 29 July.

<text>Mary of Rome was a 1st century Christian woman mentioned in Paul the Apostle&#x27;s Epistle to the Romans (16:6). She is said to have treated Paul with special kindness, and to have &quot;laboured much among&quot; the early Christian community.

Although it has been conjectured that she is the same person as the Mary, mother of John Mark, this is generally considered to be unproven. Most traditions hold that there is nothing more known about her.

There is also a suggestion from the Russian Orthodox tradition that Mary of Rome, is actually Mary Magdalene. Paul is not so formal as to use &quot;of Magdalene&quot;.

Louis de Montfort - writing in his book The Secret of the Rosary - suggests that this Mary can be interpreted with Mary, mother of Jesus, when he writes:

Therefore let all men, the learned and the ignorant, the just
and the sinners, the great and the small praise and honor
Jesus and Mary, night and day, by saying the Most Holy
Rosary. &quot;Salute Mary who hath labored much among you.&quot;
(Romans 16:6.)

<text>Mary, mother of [[John Mark]] – commonly associated with Mark the Evangelist – is mentioned in the New Testament of the Christian Bible, in Acts 12:12, where it is said that, after his escape from prison, Peter went to her house: &quot;When he realized this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John whose other name was Mark, where many were gathered together and were praying.&quot; This seems to be the only mention of her in the Bible. From this it would appear that Mary&#x27;s house was a place of gathering for the Apostles and other Christians. 

The Monastery of Saint Mark, in the Old City of Jerusalem, contains a 6th-century inscription claiming the place is the site of &quot;the house of Mary, mother of John Mark&quot;.

<doc id="20796" wikidata="Q43303" url="?curid=20796" title="Malcolm X">
<text>Malcolm X (born Malcolm Little, later el-Hajj Malik el-Shabazz; May 19, 1925 – February 21, 1965) was an African American revolutionary, Muslim minister and human rights activist who was a prominent figure during the civil rights movement until his assassination in 1965. A spokesman for the Nation of Islam (NOI) until 1964 after which he left the movement, he was a vocal advocate for Black empowerment and the promotion of Islam within the African American community. A controversial figure accused of preaching violence, Malcolm X is also a widely celebrated figure within African American and Muslim communities for his pursuit of racial justice.

Malcolm spent his adolescence living in a series of foster homes or with relatives after his father&#x27;s death and his mother&#x27;s hospitalization. He committed various crimes, being sentenced to eight to ten years in prison in 1946 for larceny and burglary. In prison, he joined the Nation of Islam, adopting the name Malcolm X to symbolize his unknown African ancestral surname while discarding &quot;the white slavemaster name of &#x27;Little, and after his parole in 1952, he quickly became one of the organization&#x27;s most influential leaders. He was the public face of the organization for 12 years, advocating Black empowerment and separation of Black and White Americans, and criticizing Martin Luther King Jr. and the mainstream civil rights movement for its emphasis on non-violence and racial integration. Malcolm X also expressed pride in some of the Nation&#x27;s social welfare achievements, such as its free drug rehabilitation program. From the 1950s onward, Malcolm X was subjected to surveillance by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

In the 1960s, Malcolm X began to grow disillusioned with the Nation of Islam, as well as with its leader, Elijah Muhammad. He subsequently embraced Sunni Islam and the civil rights movement after completing the Hajj to Mecca and became known as &quot;el-Hajj Malik el-Shabazz&quot;, which roughly translates to &quot;The Pilgrim Malcolm the Patriarch&quot;. After a brief period of travel across Africa, he publicly renounced the Nation of Islam and founded the Islamic Muslim Mosque, Inc. (MMI) and the Pan-African Organization of Afro-American Unity (OAAU). Throughout 1964, his conflict with the Nation of Islam intensified, and he was repeatedly sent death threats. On February21, 1965, he was assassinated in New York City. Three Nation members were charged with the murder and given indeterminate life sentences. In 2021, two of the convictions were vacated. Speculation about the assassination and whether it was conceived or aided by leading or additional members of the Nation, or with law enforcement agencies, has persisted for decades.

He was posthumously honored with Malcolm X Day, on which he is commemorated in various cities across the United States. Hundreds of streets and schools in the U.S. have been renamed in his honor, while the Audubon Ballroom, the site of his assassination, was partly redeveloped in 2005 to accommodate the Malcolm X and Dr. Betty Shabazz Memorial and Educational Center. A posthumous autobiography, on which he collaborated with Alex Haley, was published in 1965.

== Early years ==

Malcolm Little was born May 19, 1925, in Omaha, Nebraska, the fourth of seven children of Grenada-born Louise Helen Little (née Langdon) and Georgia-born Earl Little. Earl was an outspoken Baptist lay speaker, and he and Louise were admirers of Pan-African activist Marcus Garvey. Earl was a local leader of the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) and Louise served as secretary and &quot;branch reporter&quot;, sending news of local UNIA activities to &quot;Negro World&quot;; they inculcated self-reliance and black pride in their children. Malcolm X later said that White violence killed four of his father&#x27;s brothers.

Because of Ku Klux Klan threats, Earl&#x27;s UNIA activities were said to be &quot;spreading trouble&quot; and the family relocated in 1926 to Milwaukee, and shortly thereafter to Lansing, Michigan. There, the family was frequently harassed by the Black Legion, a White racist group Earl accused of burning their family home in 1929.

When Malcolm was six, his father died in what has been officially ruled a streetcar accident, though his mother Louise believed Earl had been murdered by the Black Legion. Rumors that White racists were responsible for his father&#x27;s death were widely circulated and were very disturbing to Malcolm X as a child. As an adult, he expressed conflicting beliefs on the question. After a dispute with creditors, Louise received a life insurance benefit (nominally $1,000 about $,000 in 2024) in payments of $18 per month; the issuer of another, larger policy refused to pay, claiming her husband Earl had committed suicide. To make ends meet, Louise rented out part of her garden, and her sons hunted game.

During the 1930s, white Seventh-day Adventists witnessed to the Little family; later on, Louise Little and her son Wilfred were baptized into the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Malcolm said the Adventists were &quot;the friendliest white people I had ever seen.&quot;

In 1937, a man Louise had been datingmarriage had seemed a possibilityvanished from her life when she became pregnant with his child. In late 1938, she had a nervous breakdown and was committed to Kalamazoo State Hospital. The children were separated and sent to foster homes. Malcolm and his siblings secured her release 24 years later.

Malcolm attended West Junior High School in Lansing and then Mason High School in Mason, Michigan, but left high school in 1941, before graduating. He excelled in junior high school but dropped out of high school after a White teacher told him that practicing law, his aspiration at the time, was &quot;no realistic goal for a nigger.&quot; Later, Malcolm X recalled feeling that the White world offered no place for a career-oriented Black man, regardless of talent.

From age 14 to 21, Malcolm held a variety of jobs while living with his half-sister Ella Little-Collins in Roxbury, a largely African American neighborhood of Boston.

After a short time in Flint, Michigan, he moved to New York City&#x27;s Harlem neighborhood in 1943, where he found employment on the New Haven Railroad and engaged in drug dealing, gambling, racketeering, robbery, and pimping. According to biographer Bruce Perry, Malcolm also occasionally had sex with other men, usually for money, though this conjecture has been disputed by those who knew him. He befriended John Elroy Sanford, a fellow dishwasher at Jimmy&#x27;s Chicken Shack in Harlem who aspired to be a professional comedian. Both men had reddish hair, so Sanford was called &quot;Chicago Red&quot; after his hometown, and Malcolm was known as &quot;Detroit Red&quot;. Years later, Sanford became famous as comedian and actor Redd Foxx.

Summoned by the local draft board for military service in World War II in late 1943, he feigned mental disturbance by rambling and declaring: &quot;I want to be sent down South. Organize them nigger soldiers... steal us some guns, and kill us [some] crackers&quot;. He was declared &quot;mentally disqualified for military service&quot;.

In late 1945, Malcolm returned to Boston, where he and four accomplices committed a series of burglaries targeting wealthy White families. In 1946, he was arrested while picking up a stolen watch he had left at a shop for repairs, and in February began serving a sentence of eight to ten years at Charlestown State Prison for larceny and breaking and entering. Two years later, Malcolm was transferred to Norfolk Prison Colony (also in Massachusetts).

== Nation of Islam period ==
=== Prison ===
When Malcolm was in prison, he met fellow convict John Bembry, a self-educated man he would later describe as &quot;the first man I had ever seen command total respect... with words&quot;. Under Bembry&#x27;s influence, Malcolm developed a voracious appetite for reading.

At this time, several of his siblings wrote to him about the Nation of Islam, a relatively new religious movement preaching Black self-reliance and, ultimately, the return of the African diaspora to Africa, where they would be free from White American and European domination. He showed scant interest at first, but after his brother Reginald wrote in 1948, &quot;Malcolm, don&#x27;t eat any more pork and don&#x27;t smoke any more cigarettes. I&#x27;ll show you how to get out of prison&quot;, he almost instantly quit smoking and began to refuse pork.

Following a visit during which Reginald detailed the group&#x27;s teachings, including the notion that White people are considered devils, Malcolm initially struggled to accept this belief. Over time, however, Malcolm reflected on his past relationships with White individuals and concluded that they had all been marked by dishonesty, injustice, greed, and hatred. Malcolm, whose hostility to Christianity had earned him the prison nickname &quot;Satan,&quot; became receptive to the message of the Nation of Islam.

In late 1948, Malcolm wrote to Elijah Muhammad, the leader of the Nation of Islam. Muhammad advised him to renounce his past, humbly bow in prayer to God and promise never to engage in destructive behavior again. Though he later recalled the inner struggle he had before bending his knees to pray, Malcolm soon became a member of the Nation of Islam,
maintaining a regular correspondence with Muhammad.

In 1950, the FBI opened a file on Malcolm after he wrote a letter from prison to President Harry S. Truman expressing opposition to the Korean War and declaring himself a communist. That year, he also began signing his name &quot;Malcolm X.&quot; Muhammad instructed his followers to leave their family names behind when they joined the Nation of Islam and use &quot;X&quot; instead. When the time was right, after they had proven their sincerity, he said, he would reveal the Muslim&#x27;s &quot;original name.&quot; In his autobiography, Malcolm X explained that the &quot;X&quot; symbolized the true African family name that he could never know. &quot;For me, my &#x27;X&#x27; replaced the white slavemaster name of &#x27;Little&#x27; which some blue-eyed devil named Little had imposed upon my paternal forebears.&quot;

=== Early ministry ===
After his parole in August 1952, Malcolm X visited Elijah Muhammad in Chicago. In June 1953, he was named assistant minister of the Nation&#x27;s Temple Number One in Detroit. Later that year he established Boston&#x27;s Temple Number11; in March 1954, he expanded Temple Number12 in Philadelphia; and two months later he was selected to lead Temple Number7 in Harlem, where he rapidly expanded its membership.

In 1953, the FBI began surveillance of him, turning its attention from Malcolm X&#x27;s possible communist associations to his rapid ascent in the Nation of Islam.

During 1955, Malcolm X continued his successful recruitment of members on behalf of the Nation of Islam. He established temples in Springfield, Massachusetts (Number13); Hartford, Connecticut (Number14); and Atlanta (Number15). Hundreds of African Americans were joining the Nation of Islam every month.

Besides his skill as a speaker, Malcolm X had an impressive physical presence. He stood tall and weighed about . One writer described him as &quot;powerfully built&quot;, and another as &quot;mesmerizingly handsome... and always spotlessly well-groomed&quot;.

=== Marriage and family ===
In 1955, Betty Sanders met Malcolm X after one of his lectures, then again at a dinner party; soon she was regularly attending his lectures. In 1956, she joined the Nation of Islam, changing her name to BettyX. One-on-one dates were contrary to the Nation&#x27;s teachings, so the couple courted at social events with dozens or hundreds of others, and Malcolm X made a point of inviting her on the frequent group visits he led to New York City&#x27;s museums and libraries.

Malcolm X proposed during a telephone call from Detroit in January 1958, and they married two days later. They had six daughters:
Attallah (b. 1958; Arabic for &quot;gift of God&quot;; perhaps named after Attila the Hun); Qubilah (b. 1960, named after Kublai Khan); Ilyasah (b. 1962, named after Elijah Muhammad); Gamilah Lumumba (b. 1964, named after Gamal Abdel Nasser and Patrice Lumumba); and twins Malikah (1965–2021) and Malaak (b. 1965, both born after their father&#x27;s death, and named in his honor).

=== Hinton Johnson incident ===
The American public first became aware of Malcolm X in 1957, after Hinton Johnson, a Nation of Islam member, was beaten by two New York City police officers. On April26, Johnson and two other passersbyalso Nation of Islam memberssaw the officers beating an African American man with nightsticks. When they attempted to intervene, shouting, &quot;You&#x27;re not in Alabama... this is New York!&quot; one of the officers turned on Johnson, beating him so severely that he suffered brain contusions and subdural hemorrhaging. All four African American men were arrested.

Alerted by a witness, Malcolm X and a small group of Muslims went to the police station and demanded to see Johnson. Police initially denied that any Muslims were being held, but when the crowd grew to about five hundred, they allowed Malcolm X to speak with Johnson. Afterward, Malcolm X insisted on arranging for an ambulance to take Johnson to Harlem Hospital.

Johnson&#x27;s injuries were treated and by the time he was returned to the police station, some four thousand people had gathered outside. Inside the station, Malcolm X and an attorney were making bail arrangements for two of the Muslims. Johnson was not bailed, and police said he could not go back to the hospital until his arraignment the following day. Considering the situation to be at an impasse, Malcolm X stepped outside the station house and gave a hand signal to the crowd. Nation members silently left, after which time the rest of the crowd also dispersed.

One police officer told the &quot;New York Amsterdam News&quot;: &quot;No one man should have that much power.&quot; Within a month the New York City Police Department arranged to keep Malcolm X under surveillance; it also made inquiries with authorities in other cities in which he had lived, and prisons in which he had served time. A grand jury declined to indict the officers who beat Johnson. In October, Malcolm X sent an angry telegram to the police commissioner. Soon the police department assigned undercover officers to infiltrate the Nation of Islam.

=== Increasing prominence ===
By the late 1950s, Malcolm X was using a new name, Malcolm Shabazz or el-Hajj Malik el-Shabazz (&quot;The Pilgrim Malcolm the Patriarch&quot;), although he was still widely referred to as Malcolm X. His comments on issues and events were being widely reported, in print and on radio and television. He was featured in a 1959 New York City television broadcast about the Nation of Islam, &quot;The Hate That Hate Produced&quot;.

In September 1960, at the United Nations General Assembly in New York City, Malcolm X was invited to the official functions of several African nations. He met Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt, Ahmed Sékou Touré of Guinea, and Kenneth Kaunda of the Zambian African National Congress. Fidel Castro also attended the Assembly, and Malcolm X met publicly with him as part of a welcoming committee of Harlem community leaders. Castro was sufficiently impressed with Malcolm X to suggest a private meeting, and after two hours of talking, Castro invited Malcolm X to visit Cuba.

=== Advocacy and teachings while with the Nation ===
From his adoption of the Nation of Islam in 1952 until he broke with it in 1964, Malcolm X promoted the Nation&#x27;s teachings. These included beliefs:
* That Black people are the original people of the world
* That White people are &quot;devils&quot; and
* That the demise of the White race is imminent.

Louis E. Lomax said that &quot;those who don&#x27;t understand biblical prophecy wrongly label him as a racist and as a hate teacher, or as being anti-White or as teaching Black Supremacy&quot;. One of the goals of the civil rights movement was to end disenfranchisement of African Americans, but the Nation of Islam forbade its members from participating in voting and other aspects of the political process. The NAACP and other civil rights organizations denounced him and the Nation of Islam as irresponsible extremists whose views did not represent the common interests of African Americans.

Malcolm X had been equally critical of the civil rights movement. During this period, he denounced Martin Luther King Jr. as a &quot;chump,&quot; and referred to other civil rights leaders as being &quot;stooges&quot; of the White establishment and was strongly against any kind of racial integration. He called the 1963 March on Washington &quot;the farce on Washington,&quot; and said he did not know why so many Black people were excited about a demonstration &quot;run by Whites in front of a statue of a president who has been dead for a hundred years and who didn&#x27;t like us when he was alive.&quot;

While the civil rights movement fought against racial segregation, Malcolm X advocated the complete separation of African Americans from Whites. He proposed that African Americans should return to Africa and that, in the interim, a separate country for Black people in America should be created. He rejected the civil rights movement&#x27;s strategy of nonviolence, arguing that Black people should defend and advance themselves &quot;by any means necessary&quot;. His speeches had a powerful effect on his audiences, who were generally African Americans in northern and western cities. Many of themtired of being told to wait for freedom, justice, equality and respectfelt that he articulated their complaints better than did the civil rights movement.

==== Antisemitism ====
Malcolm X has been widely accused of being antisemitic. His autobiography contains several &quot;antisemitic charges and caricatures of Jews&quot;. Alex Haley, the autobiography&#x27;s co-author, had to rewrite some of the book to eliminate a number of negative statements about Jews in the manuscript. Malcolm X believed that the fabricated antisemitic text &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot; was authentic and introduced it to NOI members, while accusing the Jewish people of &quot;perfecting the modern evil&quot; of neo-colonialism. He helped change the Black community&#x27;s image of The Holocaust, engaging in Holocaust trivialization and claiming that the Jews &quot;brought it on themselves&quot;.

In 1961, Malcolm X spoke at a NOI rally alongside George Lincoln Rockwell, the head of the American Nazi Party. Rockwell saw overlap between black nationalism and white supremacy. According to historian Stephen H. Norwood, Malcolm X&#x27;s negative statements about Jews continued even close to his death, referring to Jews as &quot;bloodsucker[s]&quot; in statements he made during the last months of his life.

=== Effect on Nation membership ===

Malcolm X is widely regarded as the second most influential leader of the Nation of Islam after Elijah Muhammad. He is largely credited with helping the group&#x27;s dramatic increase in membership between the early 1950s and early 1960sfrom around 1,200 to between 50,000 and 100,000 members, with up to 25,000 actively attending, according to estimates.

He inspired the boxer Muhammad Ali to join the Nation, and the two became close.
In January 1964, Ali brought Malcolm X and his family to Miami to watch him train for his fight against Sonny Liston.
When Malcolm X left the Nation of Islam, he tried to convince Ali (who had just been renamed by Elijah Muhammad) to join him in converting to Sunni Islam, but Ali instead broke ties with him, later describing the break as one of his greatest regrets.

Malcolm X mentored and guided LouisX (later known as Louis Farrakhan), who eventually became the leader of the Nation of Islam. Malcolm X also served as a mentor and confidant to Elijah Muhammad&#x27;s son, Wallace D. Muhammad; the son told Malcolm X about his skepticism toward his father&#x27;s &quot;unorthodox approach&quot; to Islam. Wallace Muhammad was excommunicated from the Nation of Islam several times, although he was eventually re-admitted.

== Disillusionment and departure ==
During 1962 and 1963, events caused Malcolm X to reassess his relationship with the Nation of Islam, and particularly its leader, Elijah Muhammad.

=== Lack of Nation of Islam response to LAPD violence ===
In late 1961, there were violent confrontations between the Nation of Islam members and police in South Central Los Angeles, and numerous Muslims were arrested. They were acquitted, but tensions had been raised. Just after midnight on April27, 1962, two LAPD officers, unprovoked, shoved and beat several Muslims outside Temple Number 27. A large crowd of angry Muslims emerged from the mosque and the officers attempted to intimidate them.

One officer was disarmed; his partner was shot in the elbow by a third officer. More than 70 backup officers arrived who then raided the mosque and randomly beat Nation of Islam members. Police officers shot seven Muslims, including William X Rogers, who was hit in the back and paralyzed for life, and Ronald Stokes, a Korean War veteran, who was shot from behind while raising his hands over his head to surrender, killing him.

A number of Muslims were indicted after the event, but no charges were laid against the police. The coroner ruled that Stokes&#x27;s killing was justified. To Malcolm X, the desecration of the mosque and the associated violence demanded action, and he used what LouisX (later Louis Farrakhan) later called his &quot;gangsterlike past&quot; to rally the more hardened of the Nation of Islam members to take violent revenge against the police.

Malcolm X sought Elijah Muhammad&#x27;s approval which was denied, stunning Malcolm X. Malcolm X was again blocked by Elijah Muhammad when he spoke of the Nation of Islam starting to work with civil rights organizations, local Black politicians, and religious groups. LouisX saw this as an important turning point in the deteriorating relationship between Malcolm X and Muhammad.

=== Sexual misbehavior by Elijah Muhammad ===
Rumors were circulating that Muhammad was conducting extramarital affairs with young Nation secretarieswhich would constitute a serious violation of Nation teachings. After first discounting the rumors, Malcolm X came to believe them after he spoke with Muhammad&#x27;s son Wallace and with the girls making the accusations. Muhammad confirmed the rumors in 1963, attempting to justify his behavior by referring to precedents set by Biblical prophets.

Over a series of national TV interviews between 1964 and 1965, Malcolm X provided testimony of his investigation, corroboration, and confirmation by Elijah Muhammed himself of multiple counts of child rape. During this investigation, he learned that seven of the eight girls had become pregnant as a result of this. He also revealed an assassination attempt made on his life, through a discovered explosive device in his car, as well as the death threats he was receiving, in response to his exposure of Elijah Muhammad.

=== Remarks on Kennedy assassination ===
On December1, 1963, when asked to comment on the assassination of John F. Kennedy, Malcolm X said that it was a case of &quot;.&quot; He added that &quot;chickens coming home to roost never did make me sad; they&#x27;ve always made me glad.&quot; Likewise, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;:

[I]n further criticism of Mr. Kennedy, the Muslim leader cited the murders of Patrice Lumumba, Congo leader, of Medgar Evers, civil rights leader, and of the Negro girls bombed earlier this year in a Birmingham church. These, he said, were instances of other &quot;chickens coming home to roost&quot;.

The remarks prompted widespread public outcry. The Nation of Islam, which had sent a message of condolence to the Kennedy family and ordered its ministers not to comment on the assassination, publicly censured their former shining star. Malcolm X retained his post and rank as minister but was prohibited from public speaking for 90 days.

=== Media attention to Malcolm X over Elijah Muhammad ===
Malcolm X had by now become a media favorite, and some Nation members believed he was a threat to Elijah Muhammad&#x27;s leadership. Publishers had shown interest in Malcolm X&#x27;s autobiography, and when Louis Lomax wrote his 1963 book about the Nation, &quot;When the Word Is Given&quot;, he used a photograph of Malcolm X on the cover. He also reproduced five of his speeches but featured only one of Muhammad&#x27;s, which greatly upset Muhammad and made him envious.

=== Departure from Nation of Islam ===

On March8, 1964, Malcolm X publicly announced his break from the Nation of Islam. Though still a Muslim, he felt that the Nation had &quot;gone as far as it can&quot; because of its rigid teachings. He said he was planning to organize a Black nationalist organization to &quot;heighten the political consciousness&quot; of African Americans. He also expressed a desire to work with other civil rights leaders, saying that Elijah Muhammad had prevented him from doing so in the past.

== Activity after leaving Nation of Islam ==
After leaving the Nation of Islam, Malcolm X founded Muslim Mosque, Inc. (MMI), a religious organization, and the Organization of Afro-American Unity (OAAU), a secular group that advocated Pan-Africanism. On March26, 1964, he briefly met Martin Luther King Jr. for the first and only timeand only long enough for photographs to be takenin Washington, D.C., as both men attended the Senate&#x27;s debate on the Civil Rights bill at the U.S. Capitol building.

In April, Malcolm X gave a speech titled &quot;The Ballot or the Bullet&quot;, in which he advised African Americans to exercise their right to vote wisely but cautioned that if the government continued to prevent African Americans from attaining full equality, it might be necessary for them to take up arms.

In the weeks after he left the Nation of Islam, several Sunni Muslims encouraged Malcolm X to learn about their faith. He soon converted to the Sunni faith.

=== Pilgrimage to Mecca ===

In April 1964, with financial help from his half-sister Ella Little-Collins, Malcolm X flew to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, as the start of his Hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca obligatory for every Muslim who is able to do so. He was delayed in Jeddah when his U.S. citizenship and inability to speak Arabic caused his status as a Muslim to be questioned.

He had received Abdul Rahman Hassan Azzam&#x27;s book &quot;The Eternal Message of Muhammad&quot; with his visa approval, and he contacted the author. Azzam&#x27;s son arranged for his release and lent him his personal hotel suite. The next morning Malcolm X learned that Prince Faisal had designated him as a state guest. Several days later, after completing the Hajj rituals, Malcolm X had an audience with the prince.

Malcolm X later said that seeing Muslims of &quot;all colors, from blue-eyed blonds to Black-skinned Africans,&quot; interacting as equals led him to see Islam as a means by which racial problems could be overcome.

Slavery in Saudi Arabia had been abolished only two years before his visit to Saudi Arabia, and his portrayal of racial harmony in the Arab world was a reply to the widespread criticism of African chattel slavery in Saudi Arabia from the African-American press in the US. 
=== Visit to Cairo ===
Malcolm X had already visited the United Arab Republic (a short-lived political union between Egypt and Syria), Sudan, Nigeria, and Ghana in 1959 to make arrangements for a tour of Africa by Elijah Muhammad. After his pilgrimage to Mecca in April 1964, he visited Africa a second time. He returned to the United States in late May and flew to Africa again in July. During these visits he met officials, gave interviews, and spoke on radio and television in Egypt, Ethiopia, Tanganyika, Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea, Sudan, Senegal, Liberia, Algeria and Morocco.

In Cairo, he attended the second meeting of the Organization of African Unity as a representative of the OAAU. By the end of this third visit, he had met with essentially all of Africa&#x27;s prominent leaders; Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana, Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt, and Ahmed Ben Bella of Algeria had all invited Malcolm X to serve in their governments. After he spoke at the University of Ibadan, the Nigerian Muslim Students Association bestowed on him the honorary Yoruba name (&#x27;the son who has come home&#x27;). He later called this his most treasured honor.

Malcolm especially hated Moïse Tshombe of the Congo as an &quot;Uncle Tom&quot; figure. In a 1964 speech in New York, he called Tshombe &quot;the worse African ever born&quot; and &quot;the man who in cold blood, cold blood, committed an international crime; murdered Patrice Lumumba&quot;. Tshombe&#x27;s decision in 1964 to hire White mercenaries to put down the Simba rebellion greatly offended Malcolm, who accused the mercenaries of committing war crimes against the Congolese.

=== France and United Kingdom ===
On November23, 1964, on his way home from Africa, Malcolm X stopped in Paris, where he spoke in the Salle de la Mutualité. After his return to the United States, he accused the United States of imperialism in the Congo by supporting Tshombe and &quot;his hired killers&quot; as he called the White mercenaries. X accused Tshombe and the American president Lyndon B. Johnson of &quot;...sleeping together. When I say sleeping together, I don&#x27;t mean that literally. But beyond that, they&#x27;re in the same bed. Johnson is paying the salaries, paying the government, propping up Tshombe&#x27;s government, this murderer&quot;.

X expressed much anger about Operation Dragon Rouge, where the United States Air Force dropped in Belgian paratroopers into the city of Stanleyville, modern Kisangani, to rescue the White Belgian hostages from the Simbas. Malcolm X maintained that there was a double standard when it came to White and Black lives, noting it was an international emergency when the lives of Whites were in danger, making Dragon Rouge necessary, but that nothing was done to stop the abuses of the Congolese at the hands of &quot;Tshombe&#x27;s hired killers&quot;. X charged that the &quot;Congolese have been massacred by White people for years and years&quot; and that &quot;chickens come home to roost.&quot;

A week later, on November30, Malcolm X flew to the United Kingdom. On December3 he took part in a debate at the Oxford Union Society. The motion was taken from a statement made earlier that year by U.S. presidential candidate Barry Goldwater: &quot;Extremism in the Defense of Liberty is No Vice; Moderation in the Pursuit of Justice is No Virtue&quot;. Malcolm X argued for the affirmative, and interest in the debate was so high that it was televised nationally by the BBC.

In his address at Oxford, Malcolm rejected the label of &quot;Black Muslim&quot; and instead focused on being a Muslim who happened to be Black, which reflected his conversion to Sunni Islam. Malcolm only mentioned his religion twice during his Oxford speech, which was part of his effort to defuse his image as an &quot;angry Black Muslim extremist&quot;, which he had long hated. During the debate at Oxford, he criticized the way the Anglo-American press portrayed the Congo crisis, noting the Simbas were portrayed as primitive cannibalistic &quot;savages&quot; who engaged in every form of depravity imaginable while Tshombe and the White mercenaries were portrayed in a very favorable light with almost no mention of any atrocities on their part.

Malcolm X charged that the Cuban émigré pilots hired by the CIA to serve as Tshombe&#x27;s air force indiscriminately bombed Congolese villages and towns, killing women and children, but this was almost never mentioned in the media while the newspapers featured long accounts of the Simbas &quot;raping White women, molesting nuns&quot;. Likewise, he felt the term mercenary was inappropriate, preferring the term &quot;hired killer&quot; and that Tshombe should not be described as a premier as he preferred the term &quot;cold-blooded murderer&quot; to describe him. Malcolm X stated that what he regarded as the extremism of the Tshombe government was &quot;never referred to as extremism because it is endorsed by the West, it is financed by America, it&#x27;s made respectable by America, and that kind of extremism is never labelled as extremism&quot;.

Malcolm X argued this extremism was not morally acceptable &quot;since it&#x27;s not extremism in defense of liberty&quot;. Many in the audience at Oxford were angered by Malcolm X&#x27;s thesis and his support for the Simbas who had committed atrocities with one asking, &quot;What sort of extremism would you consider the killing of missionaries?&quot;. In response, Malcolm X answered &quot;It is an act of war. I&#x27;d call it the same kind of extremism that happened when England dropped bombs on German cities and Germans dropped bombs on English cities&quot;.

On February5, 1965, Malcolm X flew to the United Kingdom again, and on February8 he addressed the first meeting of the Council of African Organizations in London. The next day he tried to return to France, but was refused entry. On February12, he visited Smethwick, near Birmingham, where the Conservative Party had won the parliamentary seat in the 1964 general election. The town had become a byword for racial division after the successful candidate, Peter Griffiths, was accused of using the slogan, &quot;If you want a nigger for a neighbour, vote Liberal or Labour.&quot; In Smethwick, Malcolm X compared the treatment of ethnic minority residents with the treatment of Jews under Hitler, saying: &quot;I would not wait for the fascist element in Smethwick to erect gas ovens.&quot;

=== Return to United States ===
After returning to the U.S., Malcolm X addressed a wide variety of audiences. He spoke regularly at meetings held by MMI and the OAAU, and was one of the most sought-after speakers on college campuses. One of his top aides later wrote that he &quot;welcomed every opportunity to speak to college students&quot;. He also addressed public meetings of the Socialist Workers Party, speaking at their Militant Labor Forum. He was interviewed on the subjects of segregation and the Nation of Islam by Robert Penn Warren for Warren&#x27;s 1965 book &quot;Who Speaks for the Negro?&quot;

== Death threats and intimidation from Nation of Islam ==

Throughout 1964, as his conflict with the Nation of Islam intensified, Malcolm X was repeatedly threatened.

In February, a leader of Temple Number Seven ordered the bombing of Malcolm X&#x27;s car. In March, Muhammad told Boston minister LouisX (later known as Louis Farrakhan) that &quot;hypocrites like Malcolm should have their heads cut off&quot;; the April10 edition of &quot;Muhammad Speaks&quot; featured a cartoon depicting Malcolm X&#x27;s bouncing, severed head.

On June8, FBI surveillance recorded a telephone call in which Betty Shabazz was told that her husband was &quot;as good as dead.&quot; Four days later, an FBI informant received a tip that &quot;Malcolm X is going to be bumped off.&quot; That same month, the Nation sued to reclaim Malcolm X&#x27;s residence in East Elmhurst, Queens, New York. His family was ordered to vacate but on February14, 1965the night before a hearing on postponing the evictionthe house was destroyed by fire.

On July9, Muhammad aide John Ali (suspected of being an undercover FBI agent) referred to Malcolm X by saying, &quot;Anyone who opposes the Honorable Elijah Muhammad puts their life in jeopardy.&quot; In the December4 issue of &quot;Muhammad Speaks&quot;, LouisX wrote that &quot;such a man as Malcolm is worthy of death.&quot;

The September 1964 issue of &quot;Ebony&quot; dramatized Malcolm X&#x27;s defiance of these threats by publishing a photograph of him holding an M1 carbine while peering out of a window.

== Assassination ==

On February19, 1965, Malcolm X told interviewer Gordon Parks that the Nation of Islam was actively trying to kill him. On February21, 1965, he was preparing to address the OAAU in Manhattan&#x27;s Audubon Ballroom when someone in the 400-person audience yelled,
&quot;Nigger! Get your hand outta my pocket!&quot;

As Malcolm X and his bodyguards tried to quell the disturbance, a man rushed forward and shot him once in the chest with a sawed-off shotgun and two other men charged the stage firing semi-automatic handguns. Malcolm X was pronounced dead at 3:30pm, shortly after arriving at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital. The autopsy identified 21 gunshot wounds to the chest, left shoulder, arms and legs, including ten buckshot wounds from the initial shotgun blast.

One gunman, Nation of Islam member Talmadge Hayer (also known as Thomas Hagan), was beaten by the crowd before police arrived. Witnesses identified the other gunmen as Nation members Norman 3X Butler and Thomas 15X Johnson. All three were convicted of murder in March 1966 and sentenced to life in prison.

At trial, Hayer confessed, but refused to identify the other assailants except to assert that they were not Butler and Johnson.
In 1977 and 1978, he signed affidavits reasserting Butler&#x27;s and Johnson&#x27;s innocence, naming four other Nation members of Newark&#x27;s Mosque No. 25 as participants in the murder or its planning. These affidavits did not result in the case being reopened.

Butler, today known as Muhammad Abdul Aziz, was paroled in 1985 and became the head of the Nation&#x27;s Harlem mosque in 1998; he maintains his innocence. In prison Johnson, who changed his name to Khalil Islam, rejected the Nation&#x27;s teachings and converted to Sunni Islam. Released in 1987, he maintained his innocence until his death in August 2009. Hayer, who also rejected the Nation&#x27;s teachings while in prison and converted also to Sunni Islam, is known today as Mujahid Halim. He was paroled in 2010.

In 2021, Muhammad Abdul Aziz and Khalil Islam (formerly Norman 3X Butler and Thomas 15X Johnson) were exonerated from their murder convictions, following a review that found the FBI and the New York Police Department withheld key evidence during the trial. On July 14, 2022, Aziz filed suit in the U.S. District Court in Brooklyn against the City of New York, seeking $40 million in damages related to his wrongful imprisonment.

Les Payne and Tamara Payne, in their Pulitzer Prize winning biography &quot;The Dead Are Arising: The Life of Malcolm X&quot;, claim that the assassins were members of the Nation of Islam&#x27;s Newark, New Jersey mosque: William 25X (also known as William Bradley), who fired the shotgun; Leon Davis; and Thomas Hayer.

=== Funeral ===
The public viewing, February2326 at Unity Funeral Home in Harlem, was attended by some 14,000 to 30,000 mourners.
For the funeral on February27, loudspeakers were set up for the overflow crowd outside Harlem&#x27;s thousand-seat Faith Temple of the Church of God in Christ, and a local television station carried the service live.

Among the civil rights leaders attending were John Lewis, Bayard Rustin, James Forman, James Farmer, Jesse Gray, and Andrew Young. Actor and activist Ossie Davis delivered the eulogy, describing Malcolm X as &quot;our shining Black prince... who didn&#x27;t hesitate to die because he loved us so&quot;:

There are those who will consider it their duty, as friends of the Negro people, to tell us to revile him, to flee, even from the presence of his memory, to save ourselves by writing him out of the history of our turbulent times. Many will ask what Harlem finds to honor in this stormy, controversial and bold young captainand we will smile. Many will say turn awayaway from this man, for he is not a man but a demon, a monster, a subverter and an enemy of the Black manand we will smile. They will say that he is of hatea fanatic, a racistwho can only bring evil to the cause for which you struggle! And we will answer and say to them: Did you ever talk to Brother Malcolm? Did you ever touch him, or have him smile at you? Did you ever really listen to him? Did he ever do a mean thing? Was he ever himself associated with violence or any public disturbance? For if you did you would know him. And if you knew him you would know why we must honor him... And, in honoring him, we honor the best in ourselves.

Malcolm X was buried at Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York. Friends took up the gravediggers&#x27; shovels to complete the burial on their own.

Actor and activist Ruby Dee and Juanita Poitier (wife of Sidney Poitier) established the Committee of Concerned Mothers to raise money for a home for his family and for his children&#x27;s educations.

=== Reactions ===
Reactions to Malcolm X&#x27;s assassination were varied. In a telegram to Betty Shabazz, Martin Luther King Jr. expressed his sadness at &quot;the shocking and tragic assassination of your husband.&quot; He said:

While we did not always see eye to eye on methods to solve the race problem, I always had a deep affection for Malcolm and felt that he had a great ability to put his finger on the existence and root of the problem. He was an eloquent spokesman for his point of view and no one can honestly doubt that Malcolm had a great concern for the problems that we face as a race.

Elijah Muhammad told the annual Savior&#x27;s Day convention on February26 that &quot;Malcolm X got just what he preached,&quot; but denied any involvement with the murder. &quot;We didn&#x27;t want to kill Malcolm and didn&#x27;t try to kill him,&quot; Muhammad said, adding &quot;We know such ignorant, foolish teachings would bring him to his own end.&quot;

Writer James Baldwin, who had been a friend of Malcolm X&#x27;s, was in London when he heard the news of the assassination. He responded with indignation towards the reporters interviewing him, shouting, &quot;You did it! It is because of you—the men that created this White supremacy—that this man is dead. You are not guilty, but you did it... Your mills, your cities, your rape of a continent started all this.&quot;

The &quot;New York Post&quot; wrote that &quot;even his sharpest critics recognized his brillianceoften wild, unpredictable and eccentric, but nevertheless possessing promise that must now remain unrealized.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that Malcolm X was &quot;an extraordinary and twisted man&quot; who &quot;turn[ed] many true gifts to evil purpose&quot; and that his life was &quot;strangely and pitifully wasted.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; called him &quot;an unashamed demagogue&quot; whose &quot;creed was violence.&quot;

Outside the US, particularly in Africa, the press was sympathetic. The &quot;Daily Times of Nigeria&quot; wrote that Malcolm X would &quot;have a place in the palace of martyrs.&quot; The &quot;Ghanaian Times&quot; likened him to John Brown, Medgar Evers, and Patrice Lumumba, and counted him among &quot;a host of Africans and Americans who were martyred in freedom&#x27;s cause.&quot;

In China the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; described Malcolm X as a martyr killed by &quot;ruling circles and racists&quot; in the United States; his assassination, the paper wrote, demonstrated that &quot;in dealing with imperialist oppressors, violence must be met with violence.&quot; The &quot;Guangming Daily&quot;, also published in Beijing, stated that &quot;Malcolm was murdered because he fought for freedom and equal rights.&quot; In Cuba, &quot;El Mundo&quot; described the assassination as &quot;another racist crime to eradicate by violence the struggle against discrimination.&quot;

In a weekly column he wrote for the &quot;New York Amsterdam News&quot;, King reflected on Malcolm X and his assassination:

 Malcolm X came to the fore as a public figure partially as a result of a TV documentary entitled, &quot;The Hate that Hate Produced&quot;. That title points to the nature of Malcolm&#x27;s life and death.

Malcolm X was clearly a product of the hate and violence invested in the Negro&#x27;s blighted existence in this nation...

In his youth there was no hope, no preaching, teaching or movements of non-violence...

It is a testimony to Malcolm&#x27;s personal depth and integrity that he could not become an underworld Czar, but turned again and again to religion for meaning and destiny. Malcolm was still turning and growing at the time of his brutal and meaningless assassination.…

Like the murder of Lumumba, the murder of Malcolm X deprives the world of a potentially great leader. I could not agree with either of these men, but I could see in them a capacity for leadership which I could respect, and which was just beginning to mature in judgment and statesmanship.

=== Allegations of conspiracy ===
Within days the question of who bore responsibility for the assassination was being publicly debated. On February23, James Farmer, leader of the Congress of Racial Equality, announced at a news conference that local drug dealers, and not the Nation of Islam, were to blame. Others accused the NYPD, the FBI, or the CIA, citing the lack of police protection, the ease with which the assassins entered the Audubon Ballroom, and the failure of the police to preserve the crime scene. Earl Grant, one of Malcolm X&#x27;s associates who was present at the assassination, later wrote:

&lt;poem&gt;[A]bout five minutes later, a most incredible scene took place. Into the hall sauntered about a dozen policemen. They were strolling at about the pace one would expect of them if they were patrolling a quiet park. They did not seem to be at all excited or concerned about the circumstances.

I could hardly believe my eyes. Here were New York City policemen, entering a room from which at least a dozen shots had been heard, and yet not one of them had his gun out! As a matter of absolute fact, some of them even had their hands in their pockets.&lt;/poem&gt;

In the 1970s, the public learned about COINTELPRO and other secret FBI programs established to infiltrate and disrupt civil rights organizations during the 1950s and 1960s. Louis Lomax wrote that John Ali, national secretary of the Nation of Islam, was a former FBI agent. Malcolm X had confided to a reporter that Ali exacerbated tensions between him and Elijah Muhammad and that he considered Ali his &quot;archenemy&quot; within the Nation of Islam leadership. Ali had a meeting with Talmadge Hayer, one of the men convicted of killing Malcolm X, the night before the assassination.

The Shabazz family are among those who have accused Louis Farrakhan of involvement in Malcolm X&#x27;s assassination. In a 1993 speech Farrakhan seemed to acknowledge the possibility that the Nation of Islam was responsible:

Was Malcolm your traitor or ours? And if we dealt with him like a nation deals with a traitor, what the &quot;hell&quot; business is it of yours? A nation has to be able to deal with traitors and cutthroats and turncoats.

In a &quot;60 Minutes&quot; interview that aired during May 2000, Farrakhan stated that some things he said may have led to the assassination of Malcolm X. &quot;I may have been complicit in words that I spoke,&quot; he said, adding &quot;I acknowledge that and regret that any word that I have said caused the loss of life of a human being.&quot; A few days later Farrakhan denied that he &quot;ordered the assassination&quot; of Malcolm X, although he again acknowledged that he &quot;created the atmosphere that ultimately led to Malcolm X&#x27;s assassination.&quot;

No consensus has been reached on who was responsible for the assassination. In August 2014, an online petition was started using the White House online petition mechanism to call on the government to release, without alteration, any files they still held relating to the murder of Malcolm X. In January 2019, members of the families of Malcolm X, John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King Jr., and Robert F. Kennedy were among dozens of Americans who signed a public statement calling for a truth and reconciliation commission to persuade Congress or the Justice Department to review the assassinations of all four leaders during the 1960s.

A February 21, 2021, press conference attended by three of Malcolm X&#x27;s daughters and members of deceased NYPD undercover officer Raymond Wood&#x27;s family released his authorized posthumous letter that stated in part: &quot;I was told to encourage leaders and members of the civil rights groups to commit felonious acts.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; reports that &quot;The arrests kept the two men from managing door security at the Audubon Ballroom in Washington Heights on the day of the shooting, according to the letter.&quot; On February 26, 2021, the daughter of Raymond Wood, Kelly Wood, stated that the letter presented at the February 21 press conference is fake. Kelly Wood stated that the letter was created by her cousin Reggie Wood for attention and book sales.

In early 2023, members of Malcolm X&#x27;s family said they would file a $100 million wrongful death lawsuit against the CIA, the FBI, the NYPD and others for allegedly concealing evidence related to the assassination and for alleged involvement to it. The attorney representing the family is Benjamin Crump. In November 2024, three daughters of Malcolm X filed the lawsuit in Manhattan Federal Court.

== Philosophy ==
Except for his autobiography, Malcolm X left no published writings. His philosophy is known almost entirely from the many speeches and interviews he gave from 1952 until his death. Many of those speeches, especially from the last year of his life, were recorded and have been published.

=== Beliefs of the Nation of Islam ===


While he was a member of the Nation of Islam, Malcolm X taught its beliefs, and his statements often began with the phrase &quot;The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us that...&quot; It is virtually impossible now to discern whether Malcolm X&#x27;s personal beliefs at the time diverged from the teachings of the Nation of Islam. After he left the Nation in 1964, he compared himself to a ventriloquist&#x27;s dummy who could only say what Elijah Muhammad told him to say.

Malcolm X taught that Black people were the original people of the world, and that Whites were a race of devils who were created by an evil scientist named Yakub. The Nation of Islam believed that Black people were superior to White people and that the demise of the White race was imminent. When questioned concerning his statements that White people were devils, Malcolm X said: &quot;history proves the White man is a devil.&quot; &quot;Anybody who rapes, and plunders, and enslaves, and steals, and drops hell bombs on people ... anybody who does these things is nothing but a devil,&quot; he said.

Malcolm X said that Islam was the &quot;true religion of Black mankind&quot; and that Christianity was &quot;the White man&#x27;s religion&quot; that had been imposed upon African Americans by their slave-masters. He said that the Nation of Islam followed Islam as it was practiced around the world, but the Nation&#x27;s teachings varied from those of other Muslims because they were adapted to the &quot;uniquely pitiful&quot; condition of Black people in the United States. He taught that Wallace Fard Muhammad, the founder of the Nation, was God incarnate, and that Elijah Muhammad was his Messenger, or Prophet.

While the civil rights movement fought against racial segregation, Malcolm X advocated the complete separation of Blacks from Whites. The Nation of Islam proposed the establishment of a separate country for African Americans in the southern or southwestern United States as an interim measure until African Americans could return to Africa. Malcolm X suggested the United States government owed reparations to Black people for the unpaid labor of their ancestors. He also rejected the civil rights movement&#x27;s strategy of nonviolence, advocating instead that Black people should defend themselves.

=== Palestine ===
In 1959, Malcolm X visited and met with religious leaders at Al-Aqsa mosque as a representative of Elijah Muhammad. In 1964, X visited the Khan Younis refugee camp in Gaza where he visited a local hospital and dined with religious leaders in Gaza. He also met Palestinian poet, Harun Hashem Rashid, who recounted to him how he narrowly escaped the Khan Younis massacre of 1956. A few weeks later, Malcolm X headed to Cairo where he met with members of the Palestinian Liberation Organization. These meetings and experiences inspired Malcolm X to write an essay entitled &quot;Zionist Logic&quot; that was published in the Egyptian Gazette. In this essay Malcolm X explained how the &quot;present occupation of Arab Palestine has no intelligent or legal basis in history&quot; and described how Zionism was essentially a colonial and imperialist project:
Following his return to the United States, Malcolm X continued to speak about the issue of Palestine describing in 1965 in one of his speeches in Detroit how &quot;We need a free Palestine... We don&#x27;t need a divided Palestine. We need a whole Palestine.&quot;

=== Independent views ===
After leaving the Nation of Islam, Malcolm X announced his willingness to work with leaders of the civil rights movement, though he advocated some changes to their policies. He felt that calling the movement a struggle for &quot;civil rights&quot; would keep the issue within the United States while changing the focus to &quot;human rights&quot; would make it an international concern. The movement could then bring its complaints before the United Nations, where Malcolm X said the emerging nations of the world would add their support.

Malcolm X argued that if the U.S. government was unwilling or unable to protect Black people, Black people should protect themselves. He said that he and the other members of the OAAU were determined to defend themselves from aggressors, and to secure freedom, justice and equality &quot;by whatever means necessary&quot;.

Malcolm X stressed the global perspective he gained from his international travels. He emphasized the &quot;direct connection&quot; between the domestic struggle of African Americans for equal rights with the independence struggles of Third World nations. He said that African Americans were wrong when they thought of themselves as a minority; globally, Black people were the majority.

In his speeches at the Militant Labor Forum, which was sponsored by the Socialist Workers Party, Malcolm X criticized capitalism. After one such speech, when he was asked what political and economic system he wanted, he said he did not know, but that it was no coincidence the newly independent countries in the Third World were turning toward socialism. When a reporter asked him what he thought about socialism, Malcolm X asked whether it was good for Black people. When the reporter told him it seemed to be, Malcolm X told him: &quot;Then I&#x27;m for it.&quot;

Although he no longer called for the separation of Black people from White people, Malcolm X continued to advocate Black nationalism, which he defined as self-determination for the African American community. In the last months of his life, however, Malcolm X began to reconsider his support for Black nationalism after meeting northern African revolutionaries who, to all appearances, were White.

After his Hajj, Malcolm X articulated a view of White people and racism that represented a deep change from the philosophy he had supported as a minister of the Nation of Islam. In a famous letter from Mecca, he wrote that his experiences with White people during his pilgrimage convinced him to &quot;rearrange&quot; his thinking about race and &quot;toss aside some of [his] previous conclusions&quot;. In a conversation with Gordon Parks, two days before his assassination, Malcolm said:

[L]istening to leaders like Nasser, Ben Bella, and Nkrumah awakened me to the dangers of racism. I realized racism isn&#x27;t just a Black and White problem. It&#x27;s brought bloodbaths to about every nation on earth at one time or another.

Brother, remember the time that White college girls came into the restaurantthe one who wanted to help the [Black] Muslims and the Whites get togetherand I told her there wasn&#x27;t a ghost of a chance and she went away crying? Well, I&#x27;ve lived to regret that incident. In many parts of the African continent, I saw White students helping Black people. Something like this kills a lot of argument. I did many things as a [Black] Muslim that I&#x27;m sorry for now. I was a zombie thenlike all [Black] MuslimsI was hypnotized, pointed in a certain direction and told to march. Well, I guess a man&#x27;s entitled to make a fool of himself if he&#x27;s ready to pay the cost. It cost me 12 years.

That was a bad scene, brother. The sickness and madness of those daysI&#x27;m glad to be free of them.

=== Claims of bisexuality ===
In recent years, some researchers have alleged that Malcolm X was bisexual. These claims are founded upon the work of late Columbia University historian Manning Marable, and his controversial 2011 book &quot;Malcolm X: A Life of Reinvention&quot;. In the book, Marable asserted that &quot;Malcolm X had exaggerated his early criminal career and had engaged in an early homosexual relationship with a White businessman.&quot;

Scholar Christopher Phelps agreed with Marable in the &quot;Journal of American Studies&quot;: &quot;Malcolm Little did take part in sex acts with male counterparts. If set in the context of the 1930s and 1940s, these acts position him not as a &#x27;homosexual lover,&#x27; as has been asserted, but in the pattern of &#x27;straight trade&#x27;—heterosexual men open to sex with homosexuals—an understanding that in turn affords insights into the Black revolutionary&#x27;s mature masculinity.&quot;

Malcolm X&#x27;s family has rejected these allegations about his personal life. His daughter Ilyasah Shabazz said she would have known about these encounters before abruptly walking out on an interview on NPR. Shabazz said: &quot;I think the things that I take issue with are the fact that he said my father engaged in a bisexual relationship, a homo—you know, he had a gay lover who was an elder White businessman, I think, in his late 50s when my father was in his teens. And, you know, my father was an open book. And we actually have four of the missing chapters from the autobiography. And, you know, he is very clear in his activities, which nothing included being gay. And certainly he didn&#x27;t have anything against gay—he was for human rights, human justice, you know. So if he had a gay encounter, he likely would&#x27;ve talked about it. And what he did talk about was someone else&#x27;s encounter.&quot;

== Legacy ==

Malcolm X has been described as one of the greatest and most influential African Americans in history. He is credited with raising the self-esteem of Black Americans and reconnecting them with their African heritage. He is largely responsible for the spread of Islam in the Black community in the United States. Many African Americans, especially those who lived in cities in the Northern and Western United States, felt that Malcolm X articulated their complaints concerning inequality better than did the mainstream civil rights movement. One biographer says that by giving expression to their frustration, Malcolm X &quot;made clear the price that White America would have to pay if it did not accede to Black America&#x27;s legitimate demands.&quot;

In the late 1960s, increasingly radical Black activists based their movements largely on Malcolm X and his teachings. The Black Power movement, the Black Arts Movement, and the widespread adoption of the slogan &quot;Black is beautiful&quot; can all trace their roots to Malcolm X. In 1963, Malcolm X began a collaboration with Alex Haley on his life story, &quot;The Autobiography of Malcolm X&quot;. He told Haley, &quot;If I&#x27;m alive when this book comes out, it will be a miracle.&quot; Haley completed and published it some months after the assassination.

During the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was a resurgence of interest in his life among young people. Hip-hop groups such as Public Enemy adopted Malcolm X as an icon, and his image was displayed in hundreds of thousands of homes, offices, and schools, as well as on T-shirts and jackets. In 1986 Ella Little-Collins merged the Organization of Afro-American Unity with the African American Defense League.

In 1992 the film &quot;Malcolm X&quot;, an adaptation of &quot;The Autobiography of Malcolm X&quot;, was released. In 1998, &quot;Time&quot; named &quot;The Autobiography of Malcolm X&quot; one of the ten most influential nonfiction books of the 20th century. 

Malcolm X was an inspiration for several fictional characters. He was fictionalized as the character Minister Q in the 1967 novel &quot;The Man Who Cried I Am&quot; by John A. Williams. The Marvel Comics writer Chris Claremont confirmed that Malcolm X was an inspiration for the X-Men character Magneto, while Martin Luther King was an inspiration for Professor X. Malcolm X also inspired the character Erik Killmonger in the film &quot;Black Panther&quot;.

=== Memorials and tributes ===

The house that once stood at 3448 Pinkney Street in North Omaha, Nebraska, was the first home of Malcolm Little with his birth family. The house was torn down in 1965 by new owners who did not know of its connection with Malcolm X. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. A Nebraska Historical Marker now marks the site. The Malcolm X—Ella Little-Collins House in the Roxbury section of Boston, Massachusetts, where Malcolm X lived with his half-sister Ella Little-Collins and began getting involved in the Nation of Islam, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2021. Several archaeological surveys have been performed on the house&#x27;s grounds, and there are ongoing efforts to preserve the site.

In 1968, twelve black students who occupied North Hall at University of California, Santa Barbara temporarily renamed it Malcolm X Hall to force the administration to acknowledge the needs of black students. As a result, UCSB created the Department of Black Studies.

In Lansing, Michigan, a Michigan Historical Marker was erected in 1975 on Malcolm Little&#x27;s childhood home. The city is also home to El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz Academy, a public charter school with an Afrocentric focus. The school is located in the building where Little attended elementary school.

In cities across the United States, Malcolm X&#x27;s birthday (May19) is commemorated as Malcolm X Day. The first known celebration of Malcolm X Day took place in Washington, D.C., in 1971. The city of Berkeley, California, has recognized Malcolm X&#x27;s birthday as a citywide holiday since 1979.
Many cities have renamed streets after Malcolm X. In 1987, New York mayor Ed Koch proclaimed Lenox Avenue in Harlem to be Malcolm X Boulevard. The name of Reid Avenue in Brooklyn, New York, was changed to Malcolm X Boulevard in 1985. Brooklyn also has El Shabazz Playground that was named after him. New Dudley Street, in the Roxbury neighborhood of Boston, was renamed Malcolm X Boulevard in the 1990s. In 1997, Oakland Avenue in Dallas, Texas, was renamed Malcolm X Boulevard. Main Street in Lansing, Michigan, was renamed Malcolm X Street in 2010. In 2016, Ankara, Turkey, renamed the street on which the U.S. is building its new embassy after Malcolm X.

Dozens of schools have been named after Malcolm X, including Malcolm X Shabazz High School in Newark, New Jersey, Malcolm Shabazz City High School in Madison, Wisconsin, Malcolm X College in Chicago, Illinois, and El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz Academy in Lansing, Michigan. Malcolm X Liberation University, based on the Pan-Africanist ideas of Malcolm X, was founded in 1969 in North Carolina.

In 1996, the first library named after Malcolm X was opened, the Malcolm X Branch Library and Performing Arts Center of the San Diego Public Library system.

The U.S. Postal Service issued a Malcolm X postage stamp in 1999. In 2005, Columbia University announced the opening of the Malcolm X and Dr. Betty Shabazz Memorial and Educational Center. The memorial is located in the Audubon Ballroom, where Malcolm X was assassinated. Collections of Malcolm X&#x27;s papers are held by the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture and the Robert W. Woodruff Library.

After a community-led initiative, Conrad Grebel University College in Canada (affiliated with the University of Waterloo) launched the &quot;Malcolm X Peace and Conflict Studies Scholarship&quot; in 2021 to support Black and Indigenous students enrolled in their Master of Peace and Conflict Studies program.

In 2024, Malcolm X was inducted into the Nebraska Hall of Fame, with a bust of him being placed in the Nebraska State Capitol.

== Portrayal in film, in television, and on stage ==
In 1986, composer Anthony Davis&#x27;s opera &quot;X, The Life and Times of Malcolm X&quot; premiered at the New York City Opera. It was the first work by Davis, who would go on to win the Pulitzer Prize for Music for his opera &quot;The Central Park Five&quot; (2019). In 2023, it was performed at the Metropolitan Opera in a production by Robert O&#x27;Hara, with Will Liverman playing the title role. It received positive reviews.

Arnold Perl and Marvin Worth attempted to create a drama film based on &quot;The Autobiography of Malcolm X&quot;, but when people close to the subject declined to talk to them they decided to make a documentary instead. The result was the 1972 documentary film &quot;Malcolm X&quot;.

Denzel Washington played the title role in Spike Lee&#x27;s film &quot;Malcolm X&quot; (1992).
Roger Ebert and Martin Scorsese included it on their lists of the ten best films of the 1990s. Washington had previously played the part of Malcolm X in the 1981 Off-Broadway play &quot;When the Chickens Came Home to Roost&quot;.

<text>MusicBrainz is a MetaBrainz project that aims to create a collaborative music database that is similar to the freedb project. MusicBrainz was founded in response to the restrictions placed on the Compact Disc Database (CDDB), a database for software applications to look up audio CD information on the Internet. MusicBrainz has expanded its goals to reach beyond a CD metadata (information about the performers, artists, songwriters, etc.) storehouse to become a structured online database for music.

MusicBrainz captures information about artists, their recorded works, and the relationships between them. Recorded works entries capture the album title, track titles, and the length of each track at a minimum. These entries are maintained by volunteer editors who follow community written style guidelines. Recorded works can also store information about release date and country, the CD ID, cover art, acoustic fingerprint, free-form annotation text and other metadata. , MusicBrainz contains information on over 2.4 million artists, 4.4 million releases, and 33.6 million recordings. End-users can use software that communicates with MusicBrainz to add metadata tags to their digital media files, such as ALAC, FLAC, MP3, Ogg Vorbis or AAC.

==Image archives==

=== Cover Art Archive ===

MusicBrainz allows contributors to upload cover art images of releases to the database; these images are hosted by Cover Art Archive (CAA), joint project between Internet Archive and MusicBrainz started in 2012. Internet Archive provides the bandwidth, storage and legal protection for hosting the images, while MusicBrainz stores metadata and provides public access through the Web and via an API for third parties to use. As with other contributions, the MusicBrainz community is in charge of maintaining and reviewing the data. Until May 16, 2022, cover art was also provided for items on sale at Amazon.com and some other online resources, but CAA is now preferred, because it gives the community more control and flexibility for managing the images. In , over 5.5 million images are stored in the archive.

=== Event Art Archive ===
In June 2024, MusicBrainz launched the Event Art Archive, another joint venture with the Internet Archive. The project is labeled as &quot;the internet&#x27;s greatest repository for event art&quot;, and , contains over 4,000 images.
==Fingerprinting==

In addition to collecting metadata about music, MusicBrainz also allows users to match recordings by their acoustic fingerprint. A separate application, such as MusicBrainz Picard, is used to do this.

===Proprietary services===
In 2000, MusicBrainz started using &quot;Relatable&#x27;s&quot; patented TRM (a recursive acronym for TRM Recognizes Music) for acoustic fingerprint matching. The popularity of this feature drew in a large user base into the platform, enabling the database to expand rapidly. By 2005, TRM was experiencing difficulties in handling the sheer volume of data, as the number of tracks stored in the database had surpassed one million. This issue was resolved in May 2006 when MusicBrainz partnered with MusicIP (now AmpliFIND), replacing TRM with MusicDNS. TRMs were phased out and replaced by MusicDNS in November 2008.

In October 2009 MusicIP was acquired by AmpliFIND.

===AcoustID and Chromaprint===
Since the future of the free identification service was uncertain, a replacement for it was sought. The Chromaprint acoustic fingerprinting algorithm, the basis for AcoustID identification service, was started in February 2010 by a long-time MusicBrainz contributor Lukáš Lalinský. While AcoustID and Chromaprint are not officially MusicBrainz projects, they are closely tied with each other and both are open source. Chromaprint works by analyzing the first two minutes of a track, detecting the strength for each of 12 pitch classes, storing these eight times per second. Additional post-processing is then applied to compress the fingerprint while retaining patterns. The AcoustID search server then searches from the database of fingerprints by similarity and returns the AcoustID identifier along with MusicBrainz recording identifiers, if known.

==Licensing==
Since 2003, MusicBrainz&#x27;s core data (artists, recordings, releases, and so on) are in the public domain, and additional content, including moderation data (essentially every original content contributed by users and its elaborations), is placed under the Creative Commons CC BY-NC-SA-2.0 license. The relational database management system is PostgreSQL. The server software is covered by the GNU General Public License.
The MusicBrainz client software library, &quot;libmusicbrainz&quot;, is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License, which allows use of the code by proprietary software products.

In December 2004, the MusicBrainz project was turned over to the MetaBrainz Foundation, a non-profit group, by its creator Robert Kaye. On 20 January 2006, the first commercial venture to use MusicBrainz data was the Barcelona, Spain-based &quot;Linkara&quot; in their &quot;Linkara Música&quot; service.

On 28 June 2007, BBC announced that it had licensed MusicBrainz&#x27;s live data feed to augment their music web pages. The BBC online music editors would also join the MusicBrainz community to contribute their knowledge to the database.

On 28 July 2008, the beta of the new BBC Music site was launched, which publishes a page for each MusicBrainz artist.

== MusicBrainz Picard ==
MusicBrainz Picard is a free and open-source software application for identifying, tagging, and organising digital audio recordings.

Picard identifies audio files and compact discs by comparing either their metadata or their acoustic fingerprints with records in the database. Audio file metadata (or &quot;tags&quot;) are a means of storing information about a recording in the file. When Picard identifies an audio file, it can add new information to it, such as the recording artist, the album title, the record label, and the date of release.

==ListenBrainz==
ListenBrainz is a free and open source project that aims to crowdsource listening data related to digital music and release it under an open license. It is a MetaBrainz Foundation project tied to MusicBrainz. It aims to re-implement Last.fm features that were lost following that platform&#x27;s acquisition by CBS.

ListenBrainz takes submissions from various media players and services such as Music Player Daemon, Spotify, and Rhythmbox in the form of listens. ListenBrainz can also import Last.fm and Libre.fm scrobbles in order to build listening history. As listens are released under an open license, ListenBrainz is useful for music research in industry and development research.
