<text>Basketball is a sport contested at the Summer Olympic Games. A men&#x27;s basketball tournament was first held at the 1904 Olympics as a demonstration; it has been held at every Summer Olympics since 1936. In the 1972 Olympics, the final game between the United States and the Soviet Union was a controversial one, as the game&#x27;s final three seconds were replayed three times by a FIBA (International Basketball Federation) official without the authority to do so, before the Soviet Union won their first gold medal, which would have been won by the United States if the game was not re-started against the rules. The U.S. filed a formal protest but was rejected by FIBA. As a result, the United States refused to accept the silver medal, and no player has ever claimed his medal. After a protest of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the United States boycotted the 1980 Moscow Olympics. The Soviet Union boycotted the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics in response. Both boycotts affected basketball at the Olympics, as both had successful basketball teams at the time. Until 1992, the Olympics were restricted to &quot;amateur&quot; players. The advent of the state-sponsored &quot;full-time amateur athlete&quot; of the Eastern Bloc countries further eroded the ideology of the pure amateur, as it put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage. The Soviet Union entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students, soldiers, or working in a profession, but all of whom were in reality paid by the state to train on a full-time basis. In April 1989, through the leadership of Secretary General Borislav Stanković, FIBA approved the rule that allowed NBA players to compete in international tournaments, including the Olympics. In the next Olympics, the 1992 Summer Games, the &quot;Dream Team&quot; won the gold medal at the 1992 basketball tournament, with an average winning margin of 44 points per game, and without calling a single time out. By this time, the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia no longer existed, but their successor states continued to be among the leading forces. Two newly independent countries of the former Yugoslavia and Soviet Union, Croatia and Lithuania, won the silver and bronze medals respectively.

American woman Diana Taurasi is the all-time leader for the most Olympic medals in basketball, with six gold, with three other women having won five medals—Americans Sue Bird (five gold) and Teresa Edwards (four gold and one bronze) plus Australia&#x27;s Lauren Jackson (three silver and two bronze). Nine players have won four medals: Americans Lisa Leslie, Tamika Catchings, Sylvia Fowles (each with four golds with the women&#x27;s team), Carmelo Anthony, LeBron James (each with three golds and one bronze with the men&#x27;s team), and Kevin Durant (four gold medals); Soviet Gennadi Volnov (one gold, two silver, one bronze) and Sergei Belov (one gold, three bronze), and Australian Kristi Harrower (three silver, one bronze). Taurasi is the all-time leader for the most consecutive gold medal wins in basketball. Five other individuals, all American, have won three golds – Katie Smith, Dawn Staley, Sheryl Swoopes, Seimone Augustus, and Breanna Stewart – and 23 other players, not including the previously mentioned, have won three medals. Two other American women, Kelsey Plum and Jackie Young, are the only players to have won medals of any color in both the full-court and 3x3 variants of the sport. Both won golds in the debut of 3x3 in 2020 and in the full-court game in 2024.

The United States is by far the most successful country in full-court Olympic basketball, with United States men&#x27;s teams having won 17 of 20 tournaments in which they participated, including seven consecutive titles from 1936 through 1968. United States women&#x27;s teams have won 10 titles out of the 12 tournaments in which they competed, including eight in a row from 1996 to 2024. Besides the United States, Argentina is the only nation still in existence that has won either the men&#x27;s or women&#x27;s tournament. The Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and the Unified Team are the countries no longer in existence that have won the tournament. The United States is the defending champion of both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tournaments. As of the 2016 Summer Olympics, 90 medals (30 of each color) have been awarded to teams from 20 National Olympic Committees.

Two gold medal-winning teams were inducted to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2010. The 1960 U.S. Olympic team featured four players who would eventually enter the Hall of Fame as players, one of whom later entered the Hall as a contributor; a head coach who would enter the Hall as a contributor; and a team manager who entered the Hall as a coach. The 1992 U.S. Olympic team, better known as the &quot;Dream Team&quot;, had 11 future Hall of Fame players, along with three coaches who were inducted to the Hall as coaches (one of whom was previously inducted separately for his accomplishments as a player).

On June 9, 2017, the executive board of the International Olympic Committee announced that 3x3 basketball would become an official Olympic sport as of the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan, for both men and women.

<doc id="22362" wikidata="Q191290" url="?curid=22362" title="Ordered pair">
<text>In mathematics, an ordered pair, denoted (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;), is a pair of objects in which their order is significant. The ordered pair (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) is different from the ordered pair (&quot;b&quot;, &quot;a&quot;), unless &quot;a&quot; = &quot;b&quot;. In contrast, the &quot;unordered pair&quot;, denoted {&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;}, always equals the unordered pair {&quot;b&quot;, &quot;a&quot;}.

Ordered pairs are also called 2-tuples, or sequences (sometimes, lists in a computer science context) of length 2. Ordered pairs of scalars are sometimes called 2-dimensional vectors. (Technically, this is an abuse of terminology since an ordered pair need not be an element of a vector space.)
The entries of an ordered pair can be other ordered pairs, enabling the recursive definition of ordered &quot;n&quot;-tuples (ordered lists of &quot;n&quot; objects). For example, the ordered triple (&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;) can be defined as (&quot;a&quot;, (&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;)), i.e., as one pair nested in another.

In the ordered pair (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;), the object &quot;a&quot; is called the &quot;first entry&quot;, and the object &quot;b&quot; the &quot;second entry&quot; of the pair. Alternatively, the objects are called the first and second &quot;components&quot;, the first and second &quot;coordinates&quot;, or the left and right &quot;projections&quot; of the ordered pair.

Cartesian products and binary relations (and hence functions) are defined in terms of ordered pairs, cf. picture.

==Generalities==
Let formula_1 and formula_2 be ordered pairs. Then the &quot;characteristic&quot; (or &quot;defining&quot;) &quot;property&quot; of the ordered pair is:
formula_3

The set of all ordered pairs whose first entry is in some set &quot;A&quot; and whose second entry is in some set &quot;B&quot; is called the Cartesian product of &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, and written &quot;A&quot; × &quot;B&quot;. A binary relation between sets &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; is a subset of &quot;A&quot; × &quot;B&quot;.

The notation may be used for other purposes, most notably as denoting open intervals on the real number line. In such situations, the context will usually make it clear which meaning is intended. For additional clarification, the ordered pair may be denoted by the variant notation formula_4, but this notation also has other uses.

The left and right of a pair &quot;p&quot; is usually denoted by 1(&quot;p&quot;) and 2(&quot;p&quot;), or by &quot;ℓ&quot;(&quot;p&quot;) and &quot;r&quot;(&quot;p&quot;), respectively.
In contexts where arbitrary &quot;n&quot;-tuples are considered, (&quot;t&quot;) is a common notation for the &quot;i&quot;-th component of an &quot;n&quot;-tuple &quot;t&quot;.

==Informal and formal definitions==

In some introductory mathematics textbooks an informal (or intuitive) definition of ordered pair is given, such as

For any two objects and , the ordered pair is a notation specifying the two objects and , in that order.

This is usually followed by a comparison to a set of two elements; pointing out that in a set and must be different, but in an ordered pair they may be equal and that while the order of listing the elements of a set doesn&#x27;t matter, in an ordered pair changing the order of distinct entries changes the ordered pair.

This &quot;definition&quot; is unsatisfactory because it is only descriptive and is based on an intuitive understanding of &quot;order&quot;. However, as is sometimes pointed out, no harm will come from relying on this description and almost everyone thinks of ordered pairs in this manner.

A more satisfactory approach is to observe that the characteristic property of ordered pairs given above is all that is required to understand the role of ordered pairs in mathematics. Hence the ordered pair can be taken as a primitive notion, whose associated axiom is the characteristic property. This was the approach taken by the N. Bourbaki group in its &quot;Theory of Sets&quot;, published in 1954. However, this approach also has its drawbacks as both the existence of ordered pairs and their characteristic property must be axiomatically assumed.

Another way to rigorously deal with ordered pairs is to define them formally in the context of set theory. This can be done in several ways and has the advantage that existence and the characteristic property can be proven from the axioms that define the set theory. One of the most cited versions of this definition is due to Kuratowski (see below) and his definition was used in the second edition of Bourbaki&#x27;s &quot;Theory of Sets&quot;, published in 1970. Even those mathematical textbooks that give an informal definition of ordered pairs will often mention the formal definition of Kuratowski in an exercise.

==Defining the ordered pair using set theory==

If one agrees that set theory is an appealing foundation of mathematics, then all mathematical objects must be defined as sets of some sort. Hence if the ordered pair is not taken as primitive, it must be defined as a set. Several set-theoretic definitions of the ordered pair are given below (see also Diepert).

===Wiener&#x27;s definition===
Norbert Wiener proposed the first set theoretical definition of the ordered pair in 1914:
formula_5
He observed that this definition made it possible to define the types of &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; as sets. &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; had taken types, and hence relations of all arities, as primitive.

Wiener used instead of {&quot;b&quot;} to make the definition compatible with type theory where all elements in a class must be of the same &quot;type&quot;. With &quot;b&quot; nested within an additional set, its type is equal to formula_6&#x27;s.

===Hausdorff&#x27;s definition===
About the same time as Wiener (1914), Felix Hausdorff proposed his definition:
formula_7
&quot;where 1 and 2 are two distinct objects different from a and b.&quot;

===Kuratowski&#x27;s definition===
In 1921 Kazimierz Kuratowski offered the now-accepted definition
of the ordered pair (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;):
formula_8
When the first and the second coordinates are identical, the definition obtains:
formula_9

Given some ordered pair &quot;p&quot;, the property &quot;&quot;x&quot; is the first coordinate of &quot;p&quot;&quot; can be formulated as:
formula_10
The property &quot;&quot;x&quot; is the second coordinate of &quot;p&quot;&quot; can be formulated as:
formula_11
In the case that the left and right coordinates are identical, the right conjunct formula_12 is trivially true, since formula_13 is the case.

If formula_14 then:
: formula_15
: formula_16

This is how we can extract the first coordinate of a pair (using the iterated-operation notation for arbitrary intersection and arbitrary union):
formula_17

This is how the second coordinate can be extracted:
formula_18

(if formula_19, then the set formula_20 could be obtained more simply: formula_21, but the previous formula also takes into account the case when formula_22.)

Note that formula_23 and formula_24 are generalized functions, in the sense that their domains and codomains are proper classes.

====Variants====
The above Kuratowski definition of the ordered pair is &quot;adequate&quot; in that it satisfies the characteristic property that an ordered pair must satisfy, namely that formula_25. In particular, it adequately expresses &#x27;order&#x27;, in that formula_26 is false unless formula_27. There are other definitions, of similar or lesser complexity, that are equally adequate:
* formula_28
* formula_29
* formula_30
The reverse definition is merely a trivial variant of the Kuratowski definition, and as such is of no independent interest. The definition short is so-called because it requires two rather than three pairs of braces. Proving that short satisfies the characteristic property requires the Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory axiom of regularity. Moreover, if one uses von Neumann&#x27;s set-theoretic construction of the natural numbers, then 2 is defined as the set {0, 1} = {0, {0}}, which is indistinguishable from the pair (0, 0)short. Yet another disadvantage of the short pair is the fact that, even if &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are of the same type, the elements of the short pair are not. (However, if &quot;a&quot; = &quot;b&quot; then the short version keeps having cardinality 2, which is something one might expect of any &quot;pair&quot;, including any &quot;ordered pair&quot;.)

====Proving that definitions satisfy the characteristic property====
Prove: (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) = (&quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;) if and only if &quot;a&quot; = &quot;c&quot; and &quot;b&quot; = &quot;d&quot;.

Kuratowski:&lt;br&gt;
&quot;If&quot;. If &quot;a&quot; = &quot;c&quot; and &quot;b&quot; = &quot;d&quot;, then = . Thus (&quot;a, b&quot;)K = (&quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;)K.

&quot;Only if&quot;. Two cases: &quot;a&quot; = &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;a&quot; ≠ &quot;b&quot;.

If &quot;a&quot; = &quot;b&quot;:
:(&quot;a, b&quot;)K = = = .
: = (&quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;)K = (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;)K = .
:Thus {&quot;c&quot;} = {&quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;} = {&quot;a&quot;}, which implies &quot;a&quot; = &quot;c&quot; and &quot;a&quot; = &quot;d&quot;. By hypothesis, &quot;a&quot; = &quot;b&quot;. Hence &quot;b&quot; = &quot;d&quot;.

If &quot;a&quot; ≠ &quot;b&quot;, then (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;)K = (&quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;)K implies = .

:Suppose {&quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;} = {&quot;a&quot;}. Then &quot;c&quot; = &quot;d&quot; = &quot;a&quot;, and so = = = . But then would also equal , so that &quot;b&quot; = &quot;a&quot; which contradicts &quot;a&quot; ≠ &quot;b&quot;.

:Suppose {&quot;c&quot;} = {&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;}. Then &quot;a&quot; = &quot;b&quot; = &quot;c&quot;, which also contradicts &quot;a&quot; ≠ &quot;b&quot;.

:Therefore {&quot;c&quot;} = {&quot;a&quot;}, so that &quot;c = a&quot; and {&quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;} = {&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;}.

:If &quot;d&quot; = &quot;a&quot; were true, then {&quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;} = {&quot;a&quot;, &quot;a&quot;} = {&quot;a&quot;} ≠ {&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;}, a contradiction. Thus &quot;d&quot; = &quot;b&quot; is the case, so that &quot;a&quot; = &quot;c&quot; and &quot;b&quot; = &quot;d&quot;.

Reverse:&lt;br&gt;
(&quot;a, b&quot;)reverse = = = (&quot;b, a&quot;)K.

&quot;If&quot;. If (&quot;a, b&quot;)reverse = (&quot;c, d&quot;)reverse,
(&quot;b, a&quot;)K = (&quot;d, c&quot;)K. Therefore, &quot;b = d&quot; and &quot;a = c&quot;.

&quot;Only if&quot;. If &quot;a = c&quot; and &quot;b = d&quot;, then = .
Thus (&quot;a, b&quot;)reverse = (&quot;c, d&quot;)reverse.

Short:

&quot;If&quot;: If &quot;a = c&quot; and &quot;b = d&quot;, then {&quot;a&quot;, {&quot;a, b&quot;}} = {&quot;c&quot;, {&quot;c, d&quot;}}. Thus (&quot;a, b&quot;)short = (&quot;c, d&quot;)short.

&quot;Only if&quot;: Suppose {&quot;a&quot;, {&quot;a, b&quot;}} = {&quot;c&quot;, {&quot;c, d&quot;}}.
Then &quot;a&quot; is in the left hand side, and thus in the right hand side.
Because equal sets have equal elements, one of &quot;a = c&quot; or &quot;a&quot; = {&quot;c, d&quot;} must be the case.
:If &quot;a&quot; = {&quot;c, d&quot;}, then by similar reasoning as above, {&quot;a, b&quot;} is in the right hand side, so {&quot;a, b&quot;} = &quot;c&quot; or {&quot;a, b&quot;} = {&quot;c, d&quot;}.
::If {&quot;a, b&quot;} = &quot;c&quot; then &quot;c&quot; is in {&quot;c, d&quot;} = &quot;a&quot; and &quot;a&quot; is in &quot;c&quot;, and this combination contradicts the axiom of regularity, as {&quot;a, c&quot;} has no minimal element under the relation &quot;element of.&quot;
::If {&quot;a, b&quot;} = {&quot;c, d&quot;}, then &quot;a&quot; is an element of &quot;a&quot;, from &quot;a&quot; = {&quot;c, d&quot;} = {&quot;a, b&quot;}, again contradicting regularity.
:Hence &quot;a = c&quot; must hold.

Again, we see that {&quot;a, b&quot;} = &quot;c&quot; or {&quot;a, b&quot;} = {&quot;c, d&quot;}.
:The option {&quot;a, b&quot;} = &quot;c&quot; and &quot;a = c&quot; implies that &quot;c&quot; is an element of &quot;c&quot;, contradicting regularity.
:So we have &quot;a = c&quot; and {&quot;a, b&quot;} = {&quot;c, d&quot;}, and so: {&quot;b&quot;} = {&quot;a, b&quot;} \ {&quot;a&quot;} = {&quot;c, d&quot;} \ {&quot;c&quot;} = {&quot;d&quot;}, so &quot;b&quot; = &quot;d&quot;.

===Quine–Rosser definition===
Rosser (1953) employed a definition of the ordered pair due to Quine which requires a prior definition of the natural numbers. Let formula_31 be the set of natural numbers and define first
formula_32
The function formula_33 increments its argument if it is a natural number and leaves it as is otherwise; the number 0 does not appear in the range of formula_33.
As formula_35 is the set of the elements of formula_36 not in formula_31 go on with
formula_38
This is the set image of a set formula_36 under formula_33, sometimes denoted by formula_41 as well. Applying function formula_42 to a set &quot;x&quot; simply increments every natural number in it. In particular, formula_43 never contains contain the number 0, so that for any sets &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;,
formula_44
Further, define
formula_45
By this, formula_46 does always contain the number 0.

Finally, define the ordered pair (&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;) as the disjoint union
formula_47
(which is formula_48 in alternate notation).

Extracting all the elements of the pair that do not contain 0 and undoing formula_42 yields &quot;A&quot;. Likewise, &quot;B&quot; can be recovered from the elements of the pair that do contain 0.

For example, the pair formula_50 is encoded as formula_51 provided formula_52.

In type theory and in outgrowths thereof such as the axiomatic set theory NF, the Quine–Rosser pair has the same type as its projections and hence is termed a &quot;type-level&quot; ordered pair. Hence this definition has the advantage of enabling a function, defined as a set of ordered pairs, to have a type only 1 higher than the type of its arguments. This definition works only if the set of natural numbers is infinite. This is the case in NF, but not in type theory or in NFU. J. Barkley Rosser showed that the existence of such a type-level ordered pair (or even a &quot;type-raising by 1&quot; ordered pair) implies the axiom of infinity. For an extensive discussion of the ordered pair in the context of Quinian set theories, see Holmes (1998).

===Cantor–Frege definition===
Early in the development of the set theory, before paradoxes were discovered, Cantor followed Frege by defining the ordered pair of two sets as the class of all relations that hold between these sets, assuming that the notion of relation is primitive:
formula_53

This definition is inadmissible in most modern formalized set theories and is methodologically similar to defining the cardinal of a set as the class of all sets equipotent with the given set.

===Morse definition===
Morse–Kelley set theory makes free use of proper classes. Morse defined the ordered pair so that its projections could be proper classes as well as sets. (The Kuratowski definition does not allow this.) He first defined ordered pairs whose projections are sets in Kuratowski&#x27;s manner. He then &quot;redefined&quot; the pair
formula_54
where the component Cartesian products are Kuratowski pairs of sets and where
formula_55

This renders possible pairs whose projections are proper classes. The Quine–Rosser definition above also admits proper classes as projections. Similarly the triple is defined as a 3-tuple as follows:
formula_56

The use of the singleton set formula_57 which has an inserted empty set allows tuples to have the uniqueness property that if &quot;a&quot; is an &quot;n&quot;-tuple and b is an &quot;m&quot;-tuple and &quot;a&quot; = &quot;b&quot; then &quot;n&quot; = &quot;m&quot;. Ordered triples which are defined as ordered pairs do not have this property with respect to ordered pairs.

===Axiomatic definition===
Ordered pairs can also be introduced in Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZF) axiomatically by just adding to ZF a new function symbol formula_58 of arity 2 (it is usually omitted) and a defining axiom for formula_58: 
formula_60
This definition is acceptable because this extension of ZF is a conservative extension.

The definition helps to avoid so called accidental theorems like (a,a) = , and {a} ∈ (a,b), if Kuratowski&#x27;s definition (a,b) = was used.

==Category theory==

A category-theoretic product &quot;A&quot; × &quot;B&quot; in a category of sets represents the set of ordered pairs, with the first element coming from &quot;A&quot; and the second coming from &quot;B&quot;. In this context the characteristic property above is a consequence of the universal property of the product and the fact that elements of a set &quot;X&quot; can be identified with morphisms from 1 (a one element set) to &quot;X&quot;. While different objects may have the universal property, they are all naturally isomorphic.

<text>The terms Old Catholic Church, Old Catholics, Old-Catholic churches, or Old Catholic movement, designate &quot;any of the groups of Western Christians who believe themselves to maintain in complete loyalty the doctrine and traditions of the undivided church but who separated from the See of Rome after the First Vatican council of 1869–70&quot;. 

The expression Old Catholic has been used from the 1850s by communions separated from the Roman Catholic Church over certain doctrines, primarily concerned with papal authority and infallibility. Some of these groups, especially in the Netherlands, had already existed long before the term. The Old Catholic Church is separate and distinct from Traditionalist Catholicism.

Two groups of Old Catholic churches currently exist: the Union of Utrecht (UU) and the Union of Scranton (US). Neither group is in full communion with the Holy See. Member churches of the Union of Utrecht are in full communion with the Anglican Communion as well as the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Sweden and the Philippine Independent Church and many UU churches are members of the World Council of Churches.

Both groups trace their beginning to the 18th century when members of the See of Utrecht refused to obey papal authority and were excommunicated. Later Catholics who disagreed with the Roman Catholic dogma of papal infallibility, as defined by the First Vatican Council (1870), were thereafter without a bishop and joined with the See of Utrecht to form the Union of Utrecht of the Old Catholic Churches. Today, Utrechter Union churches are found chiefly in Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, and the Czech Republic. 

In 2008, the Polish National Catholic Church created the Union of Scranton and separated from the Union of Utrecht. This was done in protest of the older Union&#x27;s decision to ordain women and bless same-sex marriages. The Nordic Catholic Church later joined the Union of Scranton as well.

==History==
===Pre-Reformation diocese and archdiocese of Utrecht===

In the pre-Reformation era, there were already disputes that set the stage for an independent bishopric of Utrecht between the Catholic Church and the Holy Roman Empire, notably during between the 11th to 15th centuries.

===Post-Reformation Netherlands===

The northern provinces that revolted against the Spanish Netherlands and signed the 1579 Union of Utrecht, persecuted the Roman Catholic Church, confiscated church property, expelled monks and nuns from convents and monasteries, and made it illegal to receive the Catholic sacraments. However, Catholicism did not die, rather priests and communities went underground. Groups would meet for the sacraments in the attics of private homes at the risk of arrest. Priests identified themselves by wearing all black clothing with very simple collars.

All the episcopal sees of the area, including that of Utrecht, had fallen vacant by 1580, because the Spanish crown, which since 1559 had patronal rights over all bishoprics in the Netherlands, refused to make appointments for what it saw as heretical territories, and the nomination of an apostolic vicar was seen as a way of avoiding direct violation of the privilege granted to the crown. The appointment of an apostolic vicar, the first after many centuries, for what came to be called the Holland Mission was followed by similar appointments for other Protestant-ruled countries, such as England, which likewise became mission territories. The disarray of the Roman Catholic Church in the Netherlands between 1572 and about 1610 was followed by a period of expansion of Roman Catholicism under the apostolic vicars, leading to Protestant protests.

The initial shortage of Roman Catholic priests in the Netherlands resulted in increased pastoral activity of religious clergy, among whom Jesuits formed a considerable minority, coming to represent between 10 and 15 percent of all the Dutch clergy in the 1600–1650 period. Conflicts arose between these, and the apostolic vicars and secular clergy. In 1629, there were 321 Roman Catholic priests in the United Provinces, 250 secular and 71 religious, with Jesuits at 34 forming almost half of the religious. By the middle of the 17th century the secular priests were 442, the religious 142, of whom 62 were Jesuits.

The sixth apostolic vicar of the Dutch/Holland Mission, Petrus Codde, was appointed in 1688. In 1691, the Jesuits accused him of favouring the Jansenist heresy. Pope Innocent XII appointed a commission of cardinals to investigate the accusations against Codde. The commission concluded that the accusations were groundless. In 1702, Pope Clement XI deposed Codde, to which Codde obeyed.

While the religious clergy remained loyal to the Holy See, three-quarters of the secular clergy at first followed Codde, but by 1706 over two-thirds of these returned to Roman Catholic allegiance. Of the laity, the overwhelming majority sided with the Holy See. Thus, most Dutch Catholics remained in full communion with the pope and with the apostolic vicars appointed by him.

After Codde&#x27;s resignation, the Diocese of Utrecht elected Cornelius Steenoven as bishop. The See of Utrecht declared the right to elect its own archbishop in 1724, after being accused of Jansenism. Following consultation with both canon lawyers and theologians in France and Germany, Dominique Marie Varlet, a Catholic bishop of the French Oratorian Society of Foreign Missions, consecrated Steenoven as a bishop without a papal mandate. What had been &quot;de jure&quot; autonomous became &quot;de facto&quot; an independent Catholic church. Although the pope was notified of all proceedings, the Holy See still regarded the diocese as vacant due to papal permission not being sought. The pope, therefore, continued to appoint apostolic vicars for the Netherlands. Steenoven and the other bishops were excommunicated by the Roman Catholic Church, and thus began the Old Catholic Church in the Netherlands. Subsequent bishops were then appointed and ordained to the sees of Deventer, Haarlem and Groningen under the See of Utrecht in later years.

Due to prevailing anti-papal feeling among the powerful Dutch Calvinists, the Church of Utrecht was tolerated and even praised by the government of the Dutch Republic.

In 1853 Pope Pius IX received guarantees of religious freedom from King William II of the Netherlands and re-established the Roman Catholic hierarchy in the Netherlands. The Holy See considers the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Utrecht as the continuation of the episcopal see founded in the 7th century and raised to metropolitan status on 12 May 1559, thus not recognizing any legitimacy of Old Catholics.

===First Vatican Council, Old Catholic Union of Utrecht===
After the First Vatican Council (1869–1870), several groups of Roman Catholics in Austria-Hungary, Imperial Germany, and Switzerland rejected the Roman Catholic dogma of papal infallibility in matters of faith and morals and left to form their own churches. The formation of the Old Catholic communion of Germans, Austrians and Swiss began under the leadership of Ignaz von Döllinger, following the First Vatican Council. These were supported by the Old Catholic Archbishop of Utrecht, who ordained priests and bishops for them. Later the Dutch were united more formally with many of these groups under the name &quot;Utrecht Union of Churches&quot;.

In the spring of 1871, a convention in Munich attracted several hundred participants, including Church of England and Protestant observers. Döllinger, an excommunicated Roman Catholic priest and church historian, was a notable leader of the movement but was never a member of an Old Catholic church.

The convention decided to form the &quot;Old Catholic Church&quot; in order to distinguish its members from what they saw as the novel teaching in the Roman Catholic dogma of papal infallibility. Although it had continued to use the Roman Rite, from the middle of the 18th century the Dutch Old Catholic See of Utrecht had increasingly used the vernacular instead of Latin. The churches which broke from the Holy See in 1870 and subsequently entered into union with the Old Catholic See of Utrecht gradually introduced the vernacular into the liturgy until it completely replaced Latin in 1877. In 1874, the Old Catholics removed the requirement of clerical celibacy.

The Catholic Diocese of the Old Catholics in Germany received support from the government of Otto von Bismarck, whose 1870s &quot;Kulturkampf&quot; policies persecuted the Roman Catholic Church. In Austria-Hungary, pan-Germanic nationalist groups, like those of Georg Ritter von Schönerer, promoted the conversion of all German speaking Catholics to Old Catholicism and Lutheranism, with poor results.

=== Spread of Old Catholicism throughout the world ===
In 1897 a group of Polish migrants in the United States broke away from the Holy See due to theological and liturgical issues; their leader, Franciszek Hodur, was consecrated a bishop by Old Catholic Archbishop of Utrecht Gerardus Gul, establishing the Polish National Catholic Church, which joined the Union of Utrecht.

==== Split of Old Roman Catholics and Liberal Catholics ====
In 1910, Arnold Mathew—a former British Catholic and Anglican, who was consecrated by Old Catholic Archbishop Gul in 1908—split away from the Union of Utrecht, establishing the Old Roman Catholic Church in Great Britain. In 1914, he consecrated Rudolph de Landas Berghes, who emigrated to the United States in 1914 and planted the seed of Old Roman Catholicism in the Americas. Mathew also consecrated an excommunicated Capuchin Franciscan priest as bishop: Carmel Henry Carfora. Various Christian denominations claiming apostolic succession from Mathew were founded in the world through Berghes, Carfora, and others including James Wedgwood—founder of the Liberal Catholic Church. Such groups&#x27; apostolic succession is deemed to be invalid by both the Holy See, the Union of Utrecht and the Anglican Communion. Mathew himself was excommunicated and declared a &quot;pseudo-bishop&quot; by Pope Pius X, while the International Old Catholic Bishops&#x27; Conference declared his consecration to be null and void, obtained mala fide.

Another significant figure, Joseph René Vilatte, who was ordained a deacon and priest by Bishop Eduard Herzog, of the Christian Catholic Church of Switzerland; he worked with Catholics of Belgian ancestry living on the Door Peninsula of Wisconsin, with the knowledge and blessing of the Union of Utrecht and under the full jurisdiction of the local Episcopal Bishop of Fond du Lac, Wisconsin. However, he subsequently left the Old Catholics and was later consecrated a bishop by Patriarch Mar Julius I of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, though the validity of such consecration is disputed. He proceeded to establish a number of Christian denominations before eventually reconciling with the Holy See.

=== Polish National Catholic schism from Utrecht ===
In 2003, the Polish National Catholic Church voted itself out of the due to the Utrechter Union&#x27;s acceptance of female ordination, and their attitude towards homosexuality, both of which the Polish National Catholic Church rejects. Prior, in 1994, the German Old Catholic bishops of the Utrechter Union decided to ordain women as priests, and put this into practice on 27 May 1996. Similar decisions and practices followed in Austria, Switzerland and the Netherlands. By 2020, the Swiss church also voted in favour of same-sex marriage. Marriages between two men and two women were conducted in the same manner as heterosexual marriages.

=== Old Catholic Church of Slovakia ===
The Old Catholic Church of Slovakia was accepted in 2000 as a member of the Union of Utrecht. As early as 2001 some issues arose concerning future consecration of Augustin Bacinsky as old-catholic bishop of Slovakia, and the matter was postponed. The Old Catholic Church of Slovakia was expelled from the Union of Utrecht in 2004, because the episcopal administrator Augustin Bacinsky had been consecrated by an &quot;episcopus vagans&quot;.

At present, the only recognized Christian church in America that is in communion with the Union of Utrecht is the Episcopal Church.

== Statistics ==
, there are 115,000 members of Old Catholic churches.

==Doctrine==
Old Catholic theology views the Eucharist as the core of the Christian Church; from this point of view, the church is a community of believers. All are in communion with one another around the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, as the highest expression of the love of God. Therefore, the celebration of the Eucharist is understood as the experience of Christ&#x27;s triumph over sin. The defeat of sin consists in bringing together that which is divided.

An active contributor to the Declaration of the Catholic Congress of Munich, 1871—and all later assemblies—was Johann Friedrich von Schulte, professor of dogmatics at Prague. Von Schulte summed up the results of the congress as follows:

* adherence to the ancient Catholic faith;
* maintenance of the rights of Catholics;
* rejection of new Roman Catholic dogmas;
* adherence to the constitutions of the ancient Church with repudiation of every dogma of faith not in harmony with the by-then established conscience of the Church;
* reform of the Church with constitutional participation of the laity;
* preparation of the way for reunion of the Christian confessions;
* reform of the training and position of the clergy;
* adherence to the State against the attacks of Ultramontanism;
* rejection of the Society of Jesus;
* claim to the real property of the Church

The 1889 states the Union of Utrecht believes in Vincent of Lérins following quote from his &quot;Commonitory&quot;: &quot;all possible care must be taken, that we hold that faith which has been believed everywhere, always, by all; for this is truly what is catholic&quot;. The allows those who are divorced to have a new religious marriage in the church, and Old Catholics had gradually replaced the Latin mass with the vernacular by 1877. In 1989, the Union of Utrecht opposed abortion, but &quot;[u]nusual exceptions should be made in consultation with a priest&quot;.

=== Apostolic succession ===
Old Catholicism values apostolic succession by which they mean both the uninterrupted laying on of hands by bishops through time (the historic episcopate), and the continuation of the whole life of the church community by word and sacrament over the years and ages. Old Catholics consider apostolic succession to be the handing on of belief in which the whole Church is involved. In this process the ministry has a special responsibility and task, caring for the continuation in time of the mission of Jesus Christ and his apostles.

According to the principle of &quot;ex opere operato&quot;, certain ordinations by bishops not in communion with Rome are still recognised as being valid by the Holy See, and the ordinations of and by Old Catholic bishops in the Union of Utrecht churches has never been formally questioned by the Holy See until the more recent ordinations of women as priests.

==Ecumenism==
The Union of Utrecht considers that the reunion of the churches has to be based on a re-actualization of the decisions of faith made by the undivided Church. In that way, they claim, the original unity of the Church could be made visible again. Following these principles, later bishops and theologians of the Union of Utrechts churches stayed in contact with Russian Orthodox, Lutheran and Anglican representatives.

Old Catholic involvement in the multilateral ecumenical movement formally began with the participation of two bishops, from the Netherlands and Switzerland, at the Lausanne Faith and Order (F&amp;O) conference (1927). This side of ecumenism has always remained a major interest for Old Catholics who have never missed an F&amp;O conference. Old Catholics also participate in other activities of the WCC and of national councils of churches. By active participation in the ecumenical movement since its very beginning, the OCC demonstrates its belief in this work.

<doc id="22371" wikidata="Q69903" url="?curid=22371" title="Oliver Lieb">
<text>Oliver Lieb (born 1969 in Frankfurt, Germany) is an electronic music producer and DJ. He has recorded under more than a dozen aliases with over 200 productions and remixes in various genres such as trance, house and techno. He has also produced tracks for other artists.

==Career==
Lieb began his musical career at the age of fourteen as a bassist in funk and soul bands. However, he often left the bands he played in before they found any real success. Eventually he started exploring electronic music.

His first record, under the alias &#x27;Force Legato&#x27;, was released by ZYX Music. In 1992, Lieb met Matthias Schindehutte, A&amp;R man for the newly formed Harthouse record label, who contracted him for the Spicelab project. At the same time, Lieb started work on harder tracks, released using the alias Psilocybin. 1993 saw his first releases under the alias L.S.G. on the Hamburg-based Superstition record label, which he discontinued in 2007; in 2015, Lieb announced the reactivation of the project. In 1994, he first co-operated with Harald Großkopf (whom he later also performed with live), releasing tracks using the alias The Ambush. Numerous other aliases were developed by Lieb during the 1990s; these included 23 different aliases as a solo artist, including Paragliders and Superspy, and twenty-two aliases for different groups and collaborations, including Force Legato (with Torsten Fenslau) and Azid Force (with Pascal Dardoufas, a.k.a. Pascal F.E.O.S.).

In 1997, using the alias LSG, Lieb spent a week at #63 in the UK Singles Chart with &quot;Netherworld&quot;. In 2000, and using his own name, he appeared in the UK Singles Chart for one week at #72 with the track &quot;Metropolis&quot;, billed as &#x27;Oliver Lieb presents Smoked&#x27;.

<text>In computing, object code or object module is the product of an assembler or compiler.

In a general sense, object code is a sequence of statements or instructions in a computer language, usually a machine code language (i.e., binary) or an intermediate language such as register transfer language (RTL). The term indicates that the code is the goal or result of the compiling process, with some early sources referring to source code as a &quot;subject program&quot;.

==Details==
Object files can in turn be linked to form an executable file or library file. In order to be used, object code must either be placed in an executable file, a library file, or an object file.

Object code is a portion of machine code that has not yet been linked into a complete program. It is the machine code for one particular library or module that will make up the completed product. It may also contain placeholders or offsets, not found in the machine code of a completed program, that the linker will use to connect everything together. Whereas machine code is binary code that can be executed directly by the CPU, object code has the jumps and inter-module references partially parametrized so that a linker can fill them in. An object file is assumed to begin at a specific location in memory, often zero. It contains information on instructions that reference memory, so that the linker can relocate the code when combining multiple object files into a single program.

An assembler is used to convert assembly code into machine code (object code). A linker links several object (and library) files to generate an executable. Assemblers (and some compilers) can also assemble directly to machine code to produce executable files without the object intermediary step.

<doc id="22385" wikidata="Q40864" url="?curid=22385" title="Oort cloud">
<text>The Oort cloud (), sometimes called the Öpik–Oort cloud, is theorized to be a vast cloud of icy planetesimals surrounding the Sun at distances ranging from 2,000 to 200,000 AU (0.03 to 3.2 light-years). The concept of such a cloud was proposed in 1950 by the Dutch astronomer Jan Oort, in whose honor the idea was named. Oort proposed that the bodies in this cloud replenish and keep constant the number of long-period comets entering the inner Solar System—where they are eventually consumed and destroyed during close approaches to the Sun.

The cloud is thought to encompass two regions: a disc-shaped inner Oort cloud aligned with the solar ecliptic (also called its Hills cloud) and a spherical outer Oort cloud enclosing the entire Solar System. Both regions lie well beyond the heliosphere and are in interstellar space. The innermost portion of the Oort cloud is more than a thousand times as distant from the Sun as the Kuiper belt, the scattered disc and the detached objects—three nearer reservoirs of trans-Neptunian objects.

The outer limit of the Oort cloud defines the cosmographic boundary of the Solar System. This area is defined by the Sun&#x27;s Hill sphere, and hence lies at the interface between solar and galactic gravitational dominion. The outer Oort cloud is only loosely bound to the Solar System and its constituents are easily affected by the gravitational pulls of both passing stars and the Milky Way itself. These forces served to moderate and render more circular the highly eccentric orbits of material ejected from the inner Solar System during its early phases of development. The circular orbits of material in the Oort disc are largely thanks to this galactic gravitational torquing. By the same token, galactic interference in the motion of Oort bodies occasionally dislodges comets from their orbits within the cloud, sending them into the inner Solar System. Based on their orbits, most but not all of the short-period comets appear to have come from the Oort disc. Other short-period comets may have originated from the far larger spherical cloud.

Astronomers hypothesize that the material presently in the Oort cloud formed much closer to the Sun, in the protoplanetary disc, and was then scattered far into space through the gravitational influence of the giant planets. No direct observation of the Oort cloud is possible with present imaging technology. Nevertheless, the cloud is thought to be the source that replenishes most long-period and Halley-type comets, which are eventually consumed by their close approaches to the Sun after entering the inner Solar System. The cloud may also serve the same function for many of the centaurs and Jupiter-family comets.

== Development of theory ==
By the turn of the 20th century, it was understood that there were two main classes of comet: short-period comets (also called &quot;ecliptic&quot; comets) and long-period comets (also called &quot;nearly isotropic&quot; comets). Ecliptic comets have relatively small orbits aligned near the ecliptic plane and are not found much farther than the Kuiper cliff around 50 AU from the Sun (the orbit of Neptune averages about 30 AU and 177P/Barnard has aphelion around 48 AU). Long-period comets, on the other hand, travel in very large orbits thousands of AU from the Sun and are isotropically distributed. This means long-period comets appear from every direction in the sky, both above and below the ecliptic plane. The origin of these comets was not well understood, and many long-period comets were initially assumed to be on parabolic trajectories, making them one-time visitors to the Sun from interstellar space.

In 1907, Armin Otto Leuschner suggested that many of the comets then thought to have parabolic orbits in fact moved along extremely large elliptical orbits that would return them to the inner Solar System after long intervals during which they were invisible to Earth-based astronomy. In 1932, the Estonian astronomer Ernst Öpik proposed a reservoir of long-period comets in the form of an orbiting cloud at the outermost edge of the Solar System. Dutch astronomer Jan Oort revived this basic idea in 1950 to resolve a paradox about the origin of comets. The following facts are not easily reconcilable with the highly elliptical orbits in which long-period comets are always found:
* Over millions and billions of years the orbits of Oort cloud comets are unstable. Celestial dynamics will eventually dictate that a comet must be pulled away by a passing star, collide with the Sun or a planet, or be ejected from the Solar System through planetary perturbations.
* Moreover, the volatile composition of comets means that as they repeatedly approach the Sun radiation gradually boils the volatiles off until the comet splits or develops an insulating crust that prevents further outgassing.

Oort reasoned that comets with orbits that closely approach the Sun cannot have been doing so since the condensation of the protoplanetary disc, more than 4.5 billion years ago. Hence long-period comets could not have formed in the current orbits in which they are always discovered and must have been held in an outer reservoir for nearly all of their existence.

Oort also studied tables of ephemerides for long-period comets and discovered that there is a curious concentration of long-period comets whose farthest retreat from the Sun (their aphelia) cluster around 20,000 AU. This suggested a reservoir at that distance with a spherical, isotropic distribution. He also proposed that the relatively rare comets with orbits of about 10,000 AU probably went through one or more orbits into the inner Solar System and there had their orbits drawn inward by the gravity of the planets.

== Structure and composition ==
The Oort cloud is thought to occupy a vast space somewhere between from the Sun to as far out as or even . The region can be subdivided into a spherical outer Oort cloud with a radius of some and a torus-shaped inner Oort cloud with a radius of .

The inner Oort cloud is sometimes known as the Hills cloud, named for Jack G. Hills, who proposed its existence in 1981. Models predict the inner cloud to be the much denser of the two, having tens or hundreds of times as many cometary nuclei as the outer cloud. The Hills cloud is thought to be necessary to explain the continued existence of the Oort cloud after billions of years.

Because it lies at the interface between the dominion of Solar and galactic gravitation, the objects comprising the outer Oort cloud are only weakly bound to the Sun. This in turn allows small perturbations from nearby stars or the Milky Way itself to inject long-period (and possibly Halley-type) comets inside the orbit of Neptune. This process ought to have depleted the sparser, outer cloud and yet long-period comets with orbits well above or below the ecliptic continue to be observed. The Hills cloud is thought to be a secondary reservoir of cometary nuclei and the source of replenishment for the tenuous outer cloud as the latter&#x27;s numbers are gradually depleted through losses to the inner Solar System.

The outer Oort cloud may have trillions of objects larger than , and billions with diameters of . This corresponds to an absolute magnitude of more than 11. On this analysis, &quot;neighboring&quot; objects in the outer cloud are separated by a significant fraction of 1 AU, tens of millions of kilometres. The outer cloud&#x27;s total mass is not known, but assuming that Halley&#x27;s Comet is a suitable proxy for the nuclei composing the outer Oort cloud, their combined mass would be roughly , or five Earth masses.
Formerly the outer cloud was thought to be more massive by two orders of magnitude, containing up to 380 Earth masses,
but improved knowledge of the size distribution of long-period comets has led to lower estimates. No estimates of the mass of the inner Oort cloud have been published as of 2023.

If analyses of comets are representative of the whole, the vast majority of Oort-cloud objects consist of ices such as water, methane, ethane, carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide.
However, the discovery of the object , an object whose appearance was consistent with a D-type asteroid in an orbit typical of a long-period comet, prompted theoretical research that suggests that the Oort cloud population consists of roughly one to two percent asteroids. Analysis of the carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios in both the long-period and Jupiter-family comets shows little difference between the two, despite their presumably vastly separate regions of origin. This suggests that both originated from the original protosolar cloud, a conclusion also supported by studies of granular size in Oort-cloud comets and by the recent impact study of Jupiter-family comet Tempel 1.

== Origin ==
The Oort cloud is thought to have developed after the formation of planets from the primordial protoplanetary disc approximately 4.6 billion years ago. The most widely accepted hypothesis is that the Oort cloud&#x27;s objects initially coalesced much closer to the Sun as part of the same process that formed the planets and minor planets. After formation, strong gravitational interactions with young gas giants, such as Jupiter, scattered the objects into extremely wide elliptical or parabolic orbits that were subsequently modified by perturbations from passing stars and giant molecular clouds into long-lived orbits detached from the gas giant region.

Recent research has been cited by NASA hypothesizing that a large number of Oort cloud objects are the product of an exchange of materials between the Sun and its sibling stars as they formed and drifted apart and it is suggested that many—possibly the majority—of Oort cloud objects did not form in close proximity to the Sun. Simulations of the evolution of the Oort cloud from the beginnings of the Solar System to the present suggest that the cloud&#x27;s mass peaked around 800 million years after formation, as the pace of accretion and collision slowed and depletion began to overtake supply.

Models by Julio Ángel Fernández suggest that the scattered disc, which is the main source for periodic comets in the Solar System, might also be the primary source for Oort cloud objects. According to the models, about half of the objects scattered travel outward toward the Oort cloud, whereas a quarter are shifted inward to Jupiter&#x27;s orbit, and a quarter are ejected on hyperbolic orbits. The scattered disc might still be supplying the Oort cloud with material. A third of the scattered disc&#x27;s population is likely to end up in the Oort cloud after 2.5 billion years.

Computer models suggest that collisions of cometary debris during the formation period play a far greater role than was previously thought. According to these models, the number of collisions early in the Solar System&#x27;s history was so great that most comets were destroyed before they reached the Oort cloud. Therefore, the current cumulative mass of the Oort cloud is far less than was once suspected. The estimated mass of the cloud is only a small part of the 50–100 Earth masses of ejected material.

Gravitational interaction with nearby stars and galactic tides modified cometary orbits to make them more circular. This explains the nearly spherical shape of the outer Oort cloud. On the other hand, the Hills cloud, which is bound more strongly to the Sun, has not acquired a spherical shape. Recent studies have shown that the formation of the Oort cloud is broadly compatible with the hypothesis that the Solar System formed as part of an embedded cluster of 200–400 stars. These early stars likely played a role in the cloud&#x27;s formation, since the number of close stellar passages within the cluster was much higher than today, leading to far more frequent perturbations.

In June 2010 Harold F. Levison and others suggested on the basis of enhanced computer simulations that the Sun &quot;captured comets from other stars while it was in its birth cluster.&quot; Their results imply that &quot;a substantial fraction of the Oort cloud comets, perhaps exceeding 90%, are from the protoplanetary discs of other stars.&quot; In July 2020 Amir Siraj and Avi Loeb found that a captured origin for the Oort Cloud in the Sun&#x27;s birth cluster could address the theoretical tension in explaining the observed ratio of outer Oort cloud to scattered disc objects, and in addition could increase the chances of a captured Planet Nine.

== Comets ==
Comets are thought to have two separate points of origin in the Solar System. Short-period comets (those with orbits of up to 200 years) are generally accepted to have emerged from either the Kuiper belt or the scattered disc, which are two linked flat discs of icy debris beyond Neptune&#x27;s orbit at 30 AU and jointly extending out beyond 100 AU. Very long-period comets, such as C/1999 F1 (Catalina), whose orbits last for millions of years, are thought to originate directly from the outer Oort cloud. Other comets modeled to have come directly from the outer Oort cloud include C/2006 P1 (McNaught), C/2010 X1 (Elenin), Comet ISON, C/2013 A1 (Siding Spring), C/2017 K2, and C/2017 T2 (PANSTARRS). The orbits within the Kuiper belt are relatively stable, so very few comets are thought to originate there. The scattered disc, however, is dynamically active and is far more likely to be the place of origin for comets. Comets pass from the scattered disc into the realm of the outer planets, becoming what are known as centaurs. These centaurs are then sent farther inward to become the short-period comets.

There are two main varieties of short-period comets: Jupiter-family comets (those with semi-major axes of less than 5 AU) and Halley-family comets. Halley-family comets, named for their prototype, Halley&#x27;s Comet, are unusual in that although they are short-period comets, it is hypothesized that their ultimate origin lies in the Oort cloud, not in the scattered disc. Based on their orbits, it is suggested they were long-period comets that were captured by the gravity of the giant planets and sent into the inner Solar System. This process may have also created the present orbits of a significant fraction of the Jupiter-family comets, although the majority of such comets are thought to have originated in the scattered disc.

Oort noted that the number of returning comets was far less than his model predicted, and this issue, known as &quot;cometary fading&quot;, has yet to be resolved. No dynamical process is known to explain the smaller number of observed comets than Oort estimated. Hypotheses for this discrepancy include the destruction of comets due to tidal stresses, impact or heating; the loss of all volatiles, rendering some comets invisible, or the formation of a non-volatile crust on the surface. Dynamical studies of hypothetical Oort cloud comets have estimated that their occurrence in the outer-planet region would be several times higher than in the inner-planet region. This discrepancy may be due to the gravitational attraction of Jupiter, which acts as a kind of barrier, trapping incoming comets and causing them to collide with it, just as it did with Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 in 1994. An example of a typical dynamically old comet with an origin in the Oort cloud could be C/2018 F4.

== Tidal effects ==

Most of the comets seen close to the Sun seem to have reached their current positions through gravitational perturbation of the Oort cloud by the tidal force exerted by the Milky Way. Just as the Moon&#x27;s tidal force deforms Earth&#x27;s oceans, causing the tides to rise and fall, the galactic tide also distorts the orbits of bodies in the outer Solar System. In the charted regions of the Solar System, these effects are negligible compared to the gravity of the Sun, but in the outer reaches of the system, the Sun&#x27;s gravity is weaker and the gradient of the Milky Way&#x27;s gravitational Galactic Center compresses it along the other two axes; these small perturbations can shift orbits in the Oort cloud to bring objects close to the Sun. The point at which the Sun&#x27;s gravity concedes its influence to the galactic tide is called the tidal truncation radius. It lies at a radius of 100,000 to 200,000 au, and marks the outer boundary of the Oort cloud.

Some scholars theorize that the galactic tide may have contributed to the formation of the Oort cloud by increasing the perihelia (smallest distances to the Sun) of planetesimals with large aphelia (largest distances to the Sun). The effects of the galactic tide are quite complex, and depend heavily on the behaviour of individual objects within a planetary system. Cumulatively, however, the effect can be quite significant: up to 90% of all comets originating from the Oort cloud may be the result of the galactic tide. Statistical models of the observed orbits of long-period comets argue that the galactic tide is the principal means by which their orbits are perturbed toward the inner Solar System.

== Stellar perturbations and stellar companion hypotheses ==
Besides the galactic tide, the main trigger for sending comets into the inner Solar System is thought to be interaction between the Sun&#x27;s Oort cloud and the gravitational fields of nearby stars or giant molecular clouds. The orbit of the Sun through the plane of the Milky Way sometimes brings it in relatively close proximity to other stellar systems. For example, it is hypothesized that 70,000 years ago Scholz&#x27;s Star passed through the outer Oort cloud (although its low mass and high relative velocity limited its effect). During the next 10 million years the known star with the greatest possibility of perturbing the Oort cloud is Gliese 710. This process could also scatter Oort cloud objects out of the ecliptic plane, potentially also explaining its spherical distribution.

In 1984, physicist Richard A. Muller postulated that the Sun has an as-yet undetected companion, either a brown dwarf or a red dwarf, in an elliptical orbit within the Oort cloud. This object, known as Nemesis, was hypothesized to pass through a portion of the Oort cloud approximately every 26 million years, bombarding the inner Solar System with comets. However, to date no evidence of Nemesis has been found, and many lines of evidence (such as crater counts), have thrown its existence into doubt. Recent scientific analysis no longer supports the idea that extinctions on Earth happen at regular, repeating intervals. Thus, the Nemesis hypothesis is no longer needed to explain current assumptions.

A somewhat similar hypothesis was advanced by astronomer John J. Matese of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette in 2002. He contends that more comets are arriving in the inner Solar System from a particular region of the postulated Oort cloud than can be explained by the galactic tide or stellar perturbations alone, and that the most likely cause would be a Jupiter-mass object in a distant orbit. This hypothetical gas giant was nicknamed Tyche. The WISE mission, an all-sky survey using parallax measurements in order to clarify local star distances, was capable of proving or disproving the Tyche hypothesis. In 2014, NASA announced that the WISE survey had ruled out any object as they had defined it.

== Future exploration ==

Space probes have yet to reach the area of the Oort cloud. &quot;Voyager 1&quot;, the fastest and farthest of the interplanetary space probes currently leaving the Solar System, will reach the Oort cloud in about 300 years and would take about 30,000 years to pass through it. However, around 2025, the radioisotope thermoelectric generators on &quot;Voyager 1&quot; will no longer supply enough power to operate any of its scientific instruments, preventing any further exploration by &quot;Voyager 1.&quot; The other four probes currently escaping the Solar System have either already stopped functioning (&quot;Pioneer 10&quot;, &quot;Pioneer 11&quot;) or are predicted to also stop functioning before they reach the Oort cloud (&quot;Voyager 2&quot;, &quot;New Horizons&quot;).

In the 1980s, there was a concept for a probe that could reach 1,000 AU in 50 years, called &quot;TAU&quot;; among its missions would be to look for the Oort cloud.

In the 2014 Announcement of Opportunity for the Discovery program, an observatory to detect the objects in the Oort cloud (and Kuiper belt) called the &quot;Whipple Mission&quot; was proposed. It would monitor distant stars with a photometer, looking for transits up to 10,000 AU away. The observatory was proposed for halo orbiting around L2 with a suggested 5-year mission. It was also suggested that the Kepler space telescope could have been capable of detecting objects in the Oort cloud.

<doc id="22388" wikidata="Q4915" url="?curid=22388" title="Ohio River">
<text>The Ohio River is a river in the United States. It is located at the boundary of the Midwestern and Southern United States, flowing in a southwesterly direction from western Pennsylvania to its mouth on the Mississippi River at the southern tip of Illinois. It is the third largest river by discharge volume in the United States and the largest tributary by volume of the north-south flowing Mississippi River, which divides the eastern from western United States. It is also the sixth oldest river on the North American continent. The river flows through or along the border of six states, and its drainage basin includes parts of 14 states. Through its largest tributary, the Tennessee River, the basin includes several states of the southeastern U.S. It is the source of drinking water for five million people.

The river became a primary transportation route for pioneers during the westward expansion of the early U.S. The lower Ohio River just below Louisville was obstructed by rapids known as the Falls of the Ohio where the elevation falls in restricting larger commercial navigation, although in the 18th and early 19th century its three deepest channels could be traversed by a wide variety of craft then in use. In 1830, the Louisville and Portland Canal (now the McAlpine Locks and Dam) bypassed the rapids, allowing even larger commercial and modern navigation from the Forks of the Ohio at Pittsburgh to the Port of New Orleans at the mouth of the Mississippi on the Gulf of Mexico. Since the &quot;canalization&quot; of the river in 1929, the Ohio has not been a natural free-flowing river; today, it is divided into 21 discrete pools or reservoirs by 20 locks and dams for navigation and power generation.

The name &quot;Ohio&quot; comes from the Seneca, ,  &quot;Good River&quot;. In his &quot;Notes on the State of Virginia&quot; published in 1781–82, Thomas Jefferson stated: &quot;The Ohio is the most beautiful river on earth. Its current gentle, waters clear, and bosom smooth and unbroken by rocks and rapids, a single instance only excepted.&quot;

After the French and Indian War, Britain&#x27;s trans-Appalachian Indian Reserve was divided by the river into colonial lands to the south and Native American lands to the north. In the late 18th century, the river became the southern boundary of the Northwest Territory. The river is sometimes considered as the western extension of the Mason–Dixon line that divided Pennsylvania from Maryland, and thus part of the border between free and slave territory, and between the Northern and Southern United States or Upper South. Where the river was narrow, it was crossed by thousands of slaves escaping to the North for freedom; many were helped by free blacks and whites of the Underground Railroad resistance movement.

The Ohio River is a climatic transition area, as its water runs along the periphery of the humid subtropical and humid continental climate areas. It is inhabited by fauna and flora of both climates. Today, the Ohio River is one of the most polluted rivers in the United States. In winter, it regularly freezes over at Pittsburgh but rarely farther south towards Cincinnati and Louisville. Further down the river in places like Paducah and Owensboro, Kentucky, closer to its confluence with the Mississippi, the Ohio is ice-free year-round.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Ohio&quot; comes from the Seneca language (an Iroquoian language), (roughly pronounced oh-hee-yoh, with the vowel in &quot;hee&quot; held longer), a proper name derived from (&quot;good river&quot;), therefore literally translating to &quot;Good River&quot;. &quot;Great river&quot; and &quot;large creek&quot; have also been given as translations.

Native Americans, including the Lenape and Iroquois, considered the Ohio and Allegheny rivers as the same, as is suggested by a New York State road sign on Interstate 86 that refers to the Allegheny River also as . Similarly, the Geographic Names Information System lists &quot;O-hee-yo&quot; and &quot;O-hi-o&quot; as variant names for the Allegheny.

An earlier Miami-Illinois language name was also applied to the Ohio River, (&quot;river of the Mosopelea&quot; tribe). Shortened in the Shawnee language to , or , the name evolved through variant forms such as &quot;Polesipi&quot;, &quot;Peleson&quot;, &quot;Pele Sipi&quot; and &quot;Pere Sipi&quot;, and eventually stabilized to the variant spellings &quot;Pelisipi&quot;, &quot;Pelisippi&quot; and &quot;Pellissippi&quot;. Originally applied just to the Ohio River, the &quot;Pelisipi&quot; name later was variously applied back and forth between the Ohio River and the Clinch River in Virginia and Tennessee. In his original draft of the Land Ordinance of 1784, Thomas Jefferson proposed a new state called &quot;Pelisipia&quot;, to the south of the Ohio River, which would have included parts of present-day Eastern Kentucky, Virginia and West Virginia.

==History==
===Precolumbian===

The river had great significance in the history of the Native Americans, as numerous prehistoric and historic civilizations formed along its valley. For thousands of years, Native Americans used the river as a major transportation and trading route.

In the five centuries before European colonization, the Mississippian culture built numerous regional chiefdoms and major earthwork mounds in the Ohio Valley like the Angel Mounds near Evansville, Indiana as well as in the Mississippi Valley and the Southeast. The historic Osage, Omaha, Ponca, and Kaw peoples lived in the Ohio Valley. Under pressure over the fur trade from the Iroquois nations to the northeast, they migrated west of the Mississippi River in the 17th century to the territory now defined as Missouri, Arkansas, and Oklahoma.

===European discovery===
Several accounts exist of the discovery and traversal of the Ohio River by Europeans in the latter half of the 17th century: Virginian colonist Abraham Wood&#x27;s trans-Appalachian expeditions between 1654 and 1664; Frenchman Robert de La Salle&#x27;s putative Ohio expedition of 1669; and two expeditions of Virginians sponsored by Colonel Wood: the Batts and Fallam expedition of 1671, and the Needham and Arthur expedition of 1673–74.

===Exploration and settlement===
====Arnout Viele (1693)====
In early autumn 1692, loyal English-speaking Dutchman Arnout Viele and a party of eleven companions from Esopus—Europeans, Shawnee, and a few loyal Delaware guides—were sent by the governor of New York to trade with the Shawnee and bring them into the English sphere of influence. Viele understood several Native American languages, which made him valuable as an interpreter. He is credited with being the first European to travel and explore western Pennsylvania and the upper Ohio Valley. Viele made contact with Native American nations as far west as the Wabash River, in present-day Indiana.

He and his company left Albany, traveling southbound and crossing portions of present-day New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania. They apparently followed the west branch of the Susquehanna River into the mountains, traversing the Tioga River and reaching a tributary of the Allegheny River before floating down to the Shawnee towns along the Ohio River. Viele and his expedition spent most of 1693 exploring the Ohio River and its tributaries in northern Kentucky with their Shawnee hosts. Gerit Luykasse, two of Viele&#x27;s Dutch traders, and two Shawnee reappeared in Albany in February 1694 &quot;to fetch powder for Arnout [Viele] and his Company&quot;; their party had been gone for fifteen months, but Viele was away for about two years. He and his companions returned from the Pennsylvania wilderness in August 1694, accompanied by diplomats from &quot;seven Nations of Indians&quot; who sought trade with the English (or peace with the powerful Iroquois nations of New York and Pennsylvania), and hundreds of Shawnee who intended to relocate in the Minisink country on the upper Delaware River.

====Gaspard-Joseph Chaussegros de Léry (1729)====

In 1729, Gaspard-Joseph Chaussegros de Léry, a French architect and surveyor whose survey was the first mapping of the Ohio River, led an expedition of French troops from Fort Niagara down the Allegheny and Ohio Rivers as far as the mouth of the Great Miami River near Big Bone Lick and possibly the Falls of the Ohio (present-day Louisville). Chaussegros de Lery mapped the Great Lakes in 1725, and engineered the Niagara fortifications in 1726.

A map of the Ohio River valley, drawn by Bellin from observations by de Lery, is in Pierre François Xavier de Charlevoix&#x27;s &quot;History of New France&quot;. The 1744 Bellin map, &quot;Map of Louisiana&quot; (), has an inscription at a point south of the Ohio River and north of the Falls: &quot;Place where one found the ivory of Elephant in 1729&quot; (). De Lery&#x27;s men found teeth weighing with a diameter of , tusks long and in diameter, and thigh bones long. The bones were collected and shipped to Paris, where they were identified as mastodon remains; they are on display at the French National Natural History Museum.

====Charles III Le Moyne, Baron de Longueil (1739)====
Charles III Le Moyne, second Baron de Longueuil (later the governor of Montreal and interim governor of New France), commanded Fort Niagara from 1726 to 1733. He led an expedition of 442 men, including Native Americans, from Montreal to war against the Chickasaw who occupied territory on the lower part of the Mississippi River in the area claimed as La Louisiane. According to Gaston Pierre de Lévis, Duke de Mirepoix, the expedition used the Ohio River as a corridor to the Mississippi.

One of the first reported eyewitness accounts of Shannoah, a Shawnee town, was by le Moyne III in July 1739. On their journey down the Ohio River toward the Mississippi, they met with local chiefs in a village on the Scioto River.

====John Howard and John Peter Salling (1742)====
John Howard, a pioneer from Virginia, led a party of five—John Peter Salling (a Pennsylvania German), Josiah Howard (John&#x27;s son), Charles Sinclair, and John Poteet (Vizt)—from the Virginia mountains to the Mississippi River. The elder Howard had a promised reward of of land for a successful expedition from the Virginia Royal Governor&#x27;s Council to reinforce British claims in the west. Howard offered equal shares of the 10,000 acres to the four other members of his expedition. The party of five left John Peter Salling&#x27;s house in August County on March 16, 1742, and traveled west to Cedar Creek (near the Natural Bridge), crossing Greenbrier River and landing at the New River. At New River, the Virginia explorers built a large bull boat frame and covered it with five buffalo skins. The first Englishmen to explore the region then followed the New River for , until it became too dangerous to navigate. At a large waterfall, they traveled overland to the Coal River. Following the Kanawha River, they entered the Ohio River above the falls. The Virginia pioneers traced the northern boundary of Kentucky for , reaching the Mississippi River on June 7. They descended just below the mouth of the Arkansas River, where they were ambushed by a large company of Native Americans, Blacks and Frenchmen on July 2, 1742; one or two of Howard&#x27;s men were killed. The rest were brought to New Orleans and imprisoned as spies. After two years in prison, Salling escaped on October 25, 1744, and returned on a southern route to his home in Augusta County, Virginia, in May 1745. John Howard was extradited to France to stand trial. His ship was intercepted by the English and, as a free man, he reported his adventures after landing in London; however, his account has been lost. Salling&#x27;s detailed account of Virginia&#x27;s adjacent lands was used in Joshua Fry and Peter Jefferson&#x27;s 1751 map.

In 1749, the Ohio Company was established in Virginia Colony to settle and trade in the Ohio River region. Exploration of the territory and trade with the Indians in the region near the Forks brought white colonists from both Pennsylvania and Virginia across the mountains, and both colonies claimed the territory. The movement across the Allegheny Mountains of Anglo-American settlers and the claims of the area near modern-day Pittsburgh led to conflict with the French, who had forts in the Ohio River Valley. This conflict was called the French and Indian War, and would merge into the global Anglo-French struggle, the Seven Years&#x27; War. In 1763, following its defeat in the war, France ceded its area east of the Mississippi River to Britain and its area west of the Mississippi River to Spain in the 1763 Treaty of Paris.

The 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix with several tribes opened Kentucky to colonial settlement and established the Ohio River as a southern boundary for American Indian territory. In 1774 the Quebec Act restored the land east of the Mississippi River and north of the Ohio River to Quebec, in effect making the Ohio the southern boundary of Canada. This appeased French Canadians in Quebec but angered the colonists of the Thirteen Colonies. Lord Dunmore&#x27;s War south of the Ohio river also contributed to cession of land north to Quebec to prevent colonial expansion onto Native American territory. During the Revolutionary War. in 1776 the British military engineer John Montrésor created a map of the river showing the strategic location of Fort Pitt, including specific navigational information about the Ohio River&#x27;s rapids and tributaries in that area. However, the 1783 Treaty of Paris gave the entire Ohio Valley to the United States, and numerous white settlers entered the region.
The economic connection of the Ohio Country to the East was significantly increased in 1818 when the National Road being built westward from Cumberland, Maryland, reached Wheeling, Virginia, (now West Virginia), providing an easier overland connection from the Potomac River to the Ohio River. The Wheeling Suspension Bridge was built over the river at Wheeling from 1847 to 1849, making the trip west easier. For a brief time, until 1851, it was the world&#x27;s largest suspension bridge. The bridge survived the American Civil War, after having been improved in 1859. It was renovated again in 1872, and remains in use as the oldest vehicular suspension bridge in the U.S.

Louisville was founded in 1778 as a military encampment on Corn Island (now submerged) by General George Rogers Clark at the only major natural navigational barrier on the river, the Falls of the Ohio. The Falls were a series of rapids where the river dropped in a stretch of about . In this area, the river flowed over hard, fossil-rich beds of limestone. The outpost was moved that same year to the south shore where Fort-on-Shore was constructed. It proved insufficient within 3 years, and the mighty Fort Nelson was constructed upriver. The town of Louisville was chartered in 1780, in honor of King Louis XVI of France. The first locks on the river the Louisville and Portland Canal were built between 1825 and 1830 to circumnavigate the falls. Fears that Louisville&#x27;s transshipment industry would collapse proved ill-founded: but the increasing size of steamships and barges on the river meant that the outdated locks could serve only the smallest vessels until well after the Civil War when improvements were made. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers improvements were expanded again in the 1960s, forming the present-day McAlpine Locks and Dam.

===Nineteenth century===
During the nineteenth century, emigrants from Virginia, North Carolina and Kentucky traveled by the river and settled along its northern bank. Known as butternuts, they formed the dominant culture in the southern portions of Ohio, Indiana and Illinois with a society that was primarily Southern in culture. Largely devoted to agricultural pursuits, they shipped much of their produce along the river to ports such as Cincinnati.
Because the Ohio River flowed westward, it became a convenient means of westward movement by pioneers traveling from western Pennsylvania. After reaching the mouth of the Ohio, settlers would travel north on the Mississippi River to St. Louis, Missouri. There, some continued on up the Missouri River, some up the Mississippi, and some farther west over land routes. In the early 19th century, river pirates such as Samuel Mason, operating out of Cave-In-Rock, Illinois, waylaid travelers on their way down the river. They killed travelers, stealing their goods and scuttling their boats. The folktales about Mike Fink recall the keelboats used for commerce in the early days of American settlement. The Ohio River boatmen inspired performer Dan Emmett, who in 1843 wrote the song &quot;The Boatman&#x27;s Dance&quot;.

Trading boats and ships traveled south on the Mississippi to New Orleans, and sometimes beyond to the Gulf of Mexico and other ports in the Americas and Europe. This provided a much-needed export route for goods from the west since the trek east over the Appalachian Mountains was long and arduous. The need for access to the port of New Orleans by settlers in the Ohio Valley is one of the factors that led to the United States&#x27; Louisiana Purchase in 1803.

===Free states border===
Because the river is the southern border of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, it was part of the border between free states and slave states in the years before the American Civil War. One antebellum slave trader reported that they kept slaves chained two-by-two while navigating the Ohio, only when they reached the Mississippi could the slaves be unchained for a time, because &quot;there was slavery on both sides of the boat.&quot; The expression &quot;sold down the river&quot; originated as a lament of Upper South slaves, especially from Kentucky, who were shipped via the Ohio and Mississippi to cotton and sugar plantations in the Deep South. Changes in crops cultivated in the Upper South resulted in slaves available to be sold to the South, where the expansion of cotton plantations was doing very well. Invention of the cotton gin made cultivation of short-staple cotton profitable throughout the Black Belt of this region.

Before and during the Civil War, the Ohio River was called the &quot;River Jordan&quot; by slaves crossing it to escape to freedom in the North via the Underground Railroad. More escaping slaves, estimated in the thousands, made their perilous journey north to freedom across the Ohio River than anywhere else across the north-south frontier. Harriet Beecher Stowe&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;, the bestselling novel that fueled abolitionist work, was the best known of the anti-slavery novels that portrayed such escapes across the Ohio. The times have been expressed by 20th-century novelists as well, such as the Nobel Prize-winning Toni Morrison, whose novel &quot;Beloved&quot; was adapted as a film of the same name. She also composed the libretto for the opera &quot;Margaret Garner&quot; (2005), based on the life and trial of an enslaved woman who escaped with her family across the river.

===State border dispute===
The colonial charter for Virginia defined its territory as extending to the north shore of the Ohio, so that the riverbed was &quot;owned&quot; by Virginia. Where the river serves as a boundary between states today, Congress designated the entire river to belong to the states on the east and south, i.e., West Virginia and Kentucky at the time of admission to the Union, that were divided from Virginia. Thus Wheeling Island, the largest inhabited island in the Ohio River, belongs to West Virginia, although it is closer to the Ohio shore than to the West Virginia shore. Kentucky sued the state of Indiana in the early 1980s because of their construction of the never-completed Marble Hill Nuclear Power Plant in Indiana, which would have discharged its waste water into the river. This would have adversely affected Kentucky&#x27;s water supplies.

The U.S. Supreme Court held that Kentucky&#x27;s jurisdiction (and, implicitly, that of West Virginia) extended only to the low-water mark of 1793 (important because the river has been extensively dammed for navigation so that the present river bank is north of the old low-water mark). Similarly, in the 1990s, Kentucky challenged Illinois&#x27;s right to collect taxes on a riverboat casino docked in Metropolis, citing its own control of the entire river. A private casino riverboat that docked in Evansville, Indiana, on the Ohio River opened about the same time. Although such boats cruised on the Ohio River in an oval pattern up and down, the state of Kentucky soon protested. Other states had to limit their cruises to going forward, then reversing and going backward on the Indiana shore only. Both Illinois and Indiana have long since changed their laws to allow riverboat casinos to be permanently docked, with Illinois changing in 1999 and Indiana in 2002.

===Bridge collapse===

The Silver Bridge at Point Pleasant, West Virginia, collapsed into the river on December 15, 1967. The collapse killed 46 people who had been crossing when the bridge failed. The bridge had been built in 1929, and by 1967 was carrying too heavy a load for its design. The bridge was rebuilt about one mile downstream and in service as the Silver Memorial Bridge in 1969.

===Conservation area===
In the early 1980s, the Falls of the Ohio National Wildlife Conservation Area was established at Clarksville, Indiana.

==Ecology==

The Ohio River as a whole is ranked as the most polluted river in the United States, based on 2009 and 2010 data. The more industrial and regional West Virginia/Pennsylvania tributary, the Monongahela River, ranked 17th for water pollution, behind 16 other American rivers. The Ohio again ranked as the most polluted in 2013, and has been the most polluted river since at least 2001, according to the Ohio River Valley Water Sanitation Commission (ORSANCO). The Commission found that 92% of toxic discharges were nitrates, including farm runoff and waste water from industrial processes such as steel production. The Commission also noted mercury pollution as an ongoing concern, citing a 500% increase in mercury discharges between 2007 and 2013.

For several decades beginning in the 1950s, the Ohio River was polluted with hundreds of thousands of pounds of PFOA, a fluoride-based chemical used in making teflon, among other things, by the DuPont chemical company from an outflow pipe at its Parkersburg, West Virginia, facility.

The Ohio was listed among America&#x27;s Most Endangered Rivers of 2023 on the heels of contamination from a high-profile train derailment, and following years as one of the most polluted watersheds in the United States.

==Economy==

The Ohio River is extensively industrialized and populated. Regular barge traffic carries cargoes of oil, steel and other industrial goods produced in the region. Major cities located along the northern and southern banks of the river include Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Louisville, Kentucky; Evansville, Indiana; and Cincinnati, Ohio.

==Geography and hydrography==

The combined Allegheny-Ohio river is long and carries the largest volume of water of any tributary of the Mississippi. The Indians and early European explorers and settlers of the region often considered the Allegheny to be part of the Ohio. The forks (the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers at what is now Pittsburgh) were considered a strategic military location by colonial French and British, and later independent American military authorities.
The Ohio River is formed by the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers at what is now Point State Park in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. From there, it flows northwest through Allegheny and Beaver counties, before making an abrupt turn to the south-southwest at the West Virginia–Ohio–Pennsylvania triple-state line (near East Liverpool, Ohio; Chester, West Virginia; and Ohioville, Pennsylvania). From there, it forms the border between West Virginia and Ohio, upstream of Wheeling, West Virginia.
The river follows a roughly southwest and then west-northwest course until Cincinnati, before bending to a west-southwest course for most of the remainder of its length. The course forms the northern borders of West Virginia and Kentucky; and the southern borders of Ohio, Indiana and Illinois, until it joins the Mississippi River at the city of Cairo, Illinois. Where the Ohio joins the Mississippi is the lowest elevation in the state of Illinois, at .
The Mississippi River flows to the Gulf of Mexico on the Atlantic Ocean. Among rivers wholly or mostly in the United States, the Ohio is the second largest by discharge volume and the tenth longest and has the eighth largest drainage basin. It serves to separate the Midwestern Great Lakes states from the Upper South states, which were historically border states in the Civil War.

The Ohio River is a left (east) and the largest tributary by volume of the Mississippi River in the United States. At the confluence, the Ohio is considerably bigger than the Mississippi, measured by long-term mean discharge. The Ohio River at Cairo is 281,500 cu ft/s (7,960 m3/s); and the Mississippi River at Thebes, Illinois, which is upstream of the confluence, is 208,200 cu ft/s (5,897 m3/s). The Ohio River flow is greater than that of the Mississippi River, so hydrologically the Ohio River is the main stream of the river system.

===River depth===

The Ohio River is a naturally shallow river that was artificially deepened by a series of dams. The natural depth of the river varied from about . The dams raise the water level and have turned the river largely into a series of reservoirs, eliminating shallow stretches and allowing for commercial navigation. From its origin to Cincinnati, the average depth is approximately . The largest immediate drop in water level is below the McAlpine Locks and Dam at the Falls of the Ohio at Louisville, Kentucky, where flood stage is reached when the water reaches on the lower gauge. However, the river&#x27;s deepest point is on the western side of Louisville, Kentucky. From Louisville, the river loses depth very gradually until its confluence with the Mississippi at Cairo, Illinois, where it has an approximate depth of .

Water levels for the Ohio River from Smithland Lock and Dam upstream to Pittsburgh are predicted daily by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&#x27;s Ohio River Forecast Center. The water depth predictions are relative to each local flood plain based upon predicted rainfall in the Ohio River basin in five reports as follows:

===Drainage basin===
The Ohio&#x27;s drainage basin covers , encompassing the easternmost regions of the Mississippi Basin. The Ohio drains parts of 14 states in four regions.

* Northeast
** New York: a small area of the southern border along the headwaters of the Allegheny.
** Pennsylvania: a corridor from the southwestern corner to the north-central border.
* Mid-Atlantic/Upper South
** Maryland: a small corridor along the Youghiogheny River on the western border.
** West Virginia: all but the Eastern Panhandle.
** Kentucky: all but a small part in the extreme west drained directly by the Mississippi.
** Tennessee: all but a small part in the extreme west drained directly by the Mississippi, and a very small area in the southeastern corner which is drained by the Conasauga River.
** Virginia: most of southwest Virginia.
** North Carolina: the western quarter.
* Midwest
** Ohio: 80% (all except a northern strip bordering Lake Erie, and the northwest corner)
** Indiana: all but the northern area.
** Illinois: the southeast quarter.
* Deep South
** Georgia: the far northwest corner.
** Alabama: the northern portion.
** Mississippi: the northeast corner.

==Climate transition zone==
The Ohio River is a climatic transition area, as its water runs along the periphery of the humid continental and humid subtropical climate areas. It is inhabited by fauna and flora of both climates. In winter, it regularly freezes over at Pittsburgh but rarely farther south toward Cincinnati and Louisville. At Paducah, Kentucky, in the south, at the Ohio&#x27;s confluence with the Tennessee River, it is ice-free year-round.

In the 21st century, with the 2016 update of climate zones, the humid subtropical zone has stretched across the river, into the southern portions of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois.

==Geology==
From a geological standpoint, the Ohio River is young. Before the river was created, large parts of North America were covered by water forming a saltwater lake about 200 miles across and 400 miles in length. The bedrock of the Ohio Valley was mostly set during this time. The river formed on a piecemeal basis beginning between 2.5 and 3 million years ago. By the movement of glaciers during the earliest ice ages, the contemporary river drainages of the Kanawha, Sandy, Kentucky, Green, Cumberland and Tennessee rivers northward created the Ohio system and the course of early tributaries of the Ohio River, including the Monongahela and the Allegheny rivers, were set. The Teays River was the largest of these rivers. The modern Ohio River flows within segments of the ancient Teays. The ancient rivers were rearranged or consumed.

The section of the river that runs southwest from Pittsburgh to Cairo, Illinois, is around tens of thousands of years old.

===Upper Ohio River===
The upper Ohio River formed when one of the glacial lakes overflowed into a south-flowing tributary of the Teays River. Prior to that event, the north-flowing Steubenville River (no longer in existence) ended between New Martinsville and Paden City, West Virginia. The south-flowing Marietta River (no longer in existence) ended between the present-day cities. The overflowing lake carved through the separating hill and connected the rivers. The floodwaters enlarged the small Marietta valley to a size more typical of a large river. The new large river subsequently drained glacial lakes and melting glaciers at the end of the ice ages. The valley grew during and following the ice age. Many small rivers were altered or abandoned after the upper Ohio River formed. Valleys of some abandoned rivers can still be seen on satellite and aerial images of the hills of Ohio and West Virginia between Marietta, Ohio, and Huntington, West Virginia.

===Middle Ohio River===
The middle Ohio River formed in a manner similar to that of the upper Ohio River. A north-flowing river was temporarily dammed by natural forces southwest of present-day Louisville, creating a large lake until the dam burst. A new route was carved to the Mississippi. Eventually, the upper and middle sections combined to form what is essentially the modern Ohio River.

==Cities and towns along the river==
Along the banks of the Ohio are some of the largest cities in their respective states: Pittsburgh, the third-largest city on the river and second-largest in Pennsylvania; Cincinnati, the second-largest city on the river and third-largest in Ohio; Louisville, the largest city on the river and in Kentucky as well; Evansville, the third-largest city in Indiana; Owensboro, the fourth-largest city in Kentucky; and three of the five largest cities in West Virginia—Huntington (second), Parkersburg (fourth), and Wheeling (fifth). Only Illinois, among the border states, has no significant cities on the river. There are hundreds of other cities, towns, villages and unincorporated populated places on the river, most of them very small.

Cities along the Ohio are also among the oldest cities in their respective states and among the oldest cities in the United States west of the Appalachian Mountains (by date of founding): Old Shawneetown, Illinois, 1748; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 1758; Wheeling, West Virginia, 1769; Huntington, West Virginia, 1775; Louisville, Kentucky, 1779; Clarksville, Indiana, 1783; Maysville, Kentucky, 1784; Martin&#x27;s Ferry, Ohio, 1785; Marietta, Ohio, 1788; Cincinnati, Ohio, 1788; Manchester, Ohio, 1790; Beaver, Pennsylvania, 1792; and Golconda, Illinois, 1798.

Other cities of interest include Cairo, Illinois, at the confluence of the Ohio with the Mississippi River and the southernmost and westernmost city on the river; and Beaver, Pennsylvania, the site of colonial Fort McIntosh and the northernmost city on the river. It is 548 miles as the crow flies between Cairo and Pittsburgh, but 981 miles by water. Direct water travel over the length of the river is obstructed by the Falls of the Ohio just below Louisville, Kentucky. The Ohio River Scenic Byway follows the Ohio River through Illinois, Indiana and Ohio ending at Steubenville, Ohio, on the river.

Before there were cities, there were colonial forts. These forts played a dominant role in the French and Indian War, Northwest Indian War and pioneering settlement of Ohio Country. Many cities got their start at or adjacent to the forts. Most were abandoned by 1800. Forts along the Ohio river include Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania), Fort McIntosh (Pennsylvania), Fort Randolph (West Virginia), Fort Henry (West Virginia), Fort Harmar (Ohio), Fort Washington (Ohio), and Fort-on-Shore and Fort Nelson (Kentucky). Short-lived, special-purpose forts included Fort Steuben (Ohio), Fort Finney (Indiana), Fort Finney (Ohio) and Fort Gower (Ohio). There was also the Newport Barracks (Kentucky) in the 19th century.

==Recreation==

Annual events taking place on or over the river include Thunder Over Louisville, the Madison Regatta, and the Great Steamboat Race.

Multiple West Virginia stage record fish were caught along the Ohio River.

<text>Oland (, North Frisian: &quot;Ualöönist&quot;) is a small Hallig of the North Frisian Islands which is connected by a narrow-gauge railway to the mainland and to Hallig Langeneß. In 2019, the population was estimated, unofficially, to be 16 people.

Germany&#x27;s smallest lighthouse is located here, being also the only one with a thatched roof.

== History ==
People have settled in this place since the Middle Ages, while today&#x27;s Oland was connected to the Hallig Langeneß until the Burchardi flood in 1634. The Hallig became smaller as a result of numerous storm surges over the centuries. The second terp (Warft) of the Hallig was destroyed in a storm flood in 1850, so today&#x27;s Oland consists of one large terp in the Wadden Sea.

Since 1927, Oland and Langeneß have been connected to the mainland by a dam with a narrow-gauge railway. Initially, the lorries on this railway were powered by sails, but later they switched to small combustion engines, which are still used today. 

In addition, Oland has a small harbor. Vessels with a shallow draft can enter this harbor approximately between three hours before and three hours after high tide, during the rest of the time the access channel is almost dry.

<doc id="22393" wikidata="Q45948" url="?curid=22393" title="Organelle">
<text>In cell biology, an organelle is a specialized subunit, usually within a cell, that has a specific function. The name &quot;organelle&quot; comes from the idea that these structures are parts of cells, as organs are to the body, hence &quot;organelle,&quot; the suffix &quot;-elle&quot; being a diminutive. Organelles are either separately enclosed within their own lipid bilayers (also called membrane-bounded organelles) or are spatially distinct functional units without a surrounding lipid bilayer (non-membrane bounded organelles). Although most organelles are functional units within cells, some function units that extend outside of cells are often termed organelles, such as cilia, the flagellum and archaellum, and the trichocyst (these could be referred to as membrane bound in the sense that they are attached to (or bound to) the membrane).

Organelles are identified by microscopy, and can also be purified by cell fractionation. There are many types of organelles, particularly in eukaryotic cells. They include structures that make up the endomembrane system (such as the nuclear envelope, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus), and other structures such as mitochondria and plastids. While prokaryotes do not possess eukaryotic organelles, some do contain protein-shelled bacterial microcompartments, which are thought to act as primitive prokaryotic organelles; and there is also evidence of other membrane-bounded structures. Also, the prokaryotic flagellum which protrudes outside the cell, and its motor, as well as the largely extracellular pilus, are often spoken of as organelles.

== History and terminology ==

In biology, &quot;organs&quot; are defined as confined functional units within an organism. The analogy of bodily organs to microscopic cellular substructures is obvious, as from even early works, authors of respective textbooks rarely elaborate on the distinction between the two.

In the 1830s, Félix Dujardin refuted Ehrenberg theory which said that microorganisms have the same organs of multicellular animals, only minor.

Credited as the first to use a diminutive of &quot;organ&quot; (i.e., little organ) for cellular structures was German zoologist Karl August Möbius (1884), who used the term &quot;organula&quot; (plural of &quot;organulum&quot;, the diminutive of Latin &quot;organum&quot;). In a footnote, which was published as a correction in the next issue of the journal, he justified his suggestion to call organs of unicellular organisms &quot;organella&quot; since they are only differently formed parts of one cell, in contrast to multicellular organs of multicellular organisms.

== Types ==
While most cell biologists consider the term &quot;organelle&quot; to be synonymous with cell compartment, a space often bounded by one or two lipid bilayers, some cell biologists choose to limit the term to include only those cell compartments that contain deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), having originated from formerly autonomous microscopic organisms acquired via endosymbiosis.

The first, broader conception of organelles is that they are membrane-bounded structures. However, even by using this definition, some parts of the cell that have been shown to be distinct functional units do not qualify as organelles. Therefore, the use of organelle to also refer to non-membrane bounded structures such as ribosomes is common and accepted. 

This has led many texts to delineate between membrane-bounded and non-membrane bounded organelles. The non-membrane bounded organelles, also called large biomolecular complexes, are large assemblies of macromolecules that carry out particular and specialized functions, but they lack membrane boundaries. Many of these are referred to as &quot;proteinaceous organelles&quot; as their main structure is made of proteins. Such cell structures include:
* large RNA and protein complexes: ribosome, spliceosome, vault
* large protein complexes: proteasome, DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, RNA polymerase II holoenzyme, symmetric viral capsids, complex of GroEL and GroES; membrane protein complexes: porosome, photosystem I, ATP synthase
* large DNA and protein complexes: nucleosome
* centriole and microtubule-organizing center (MTOC)
* cytoskeleton
* flagellum
* nucleolus
* stress granule
* germ cell granule
* neuronal transport granule

The mechanisms by which such non-membrane bounded organelles form and retain their spatial integrity have been likened to liquid-liquid phase separation.

The second, more restrictive definition of organelle includes only those cell compartments that contain deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), having originated from formerly autonomous microscopic organisms acquired via endosymbiosis.

Using this definition, there would only be two broad classes of organelles (i.e. those that contain their own DNA, and have originated from endosymbiotic bacteria):
* mitochondria (in almost all eukaryotes)
* plastids (e.g. in plants, algae, and some protists).

Other organelles are also suggested to have endosymbiotic origins, but do not contain their own DNA (notably the flagellum – see evolution of flagella).

== Eukaryotic organelles ==
Eukaryotic cells are structurally complex, and by definition are organized, in part, by interior compartments that are themselves enclosed by lipid membranes that resemble the outermost cell membrane. The larger organelles, such as the nucleus and vacuoles, are easily visible with the light microscope. They were among the first biological discoveries made after the invention of the microscope.

Not all eukaryotic cells have each of the organelles listed below. Exceptional organisms have cells that do not include some organelles (such as mitochondria) that might otherwise be considered universal to eukaryotes. The several plastids including chloroplasts are distributed among some but not all eukaryotes.

There are also occasional exceptions to the number of membranes surrounding organelles, listed in the tables below (e.g., some that are listed as double-membrane are sometimes found with single or triple membranes). In addition, the number of individual organelles of each type found in a given cell varies depending upon the function of that cell. The cell membrane and cell wall are not organelles.


Other related structures:
* cytosol
* endomembrane system
* nucleosome
* microtubule

== Prokaryotic organelles ==


Prokaryotes are not as structurally complex as eukaryotes, and were once thought to have little internal organization, and lack cellular compartments and internal membranes; but slowly, details are emerging about prokaryotic internal structures that overturn these assumptions. An early false turn was the idea developed in the 1970s that bacteria might contain cell membrane folds termed mesosomes, but these were later shown to be artifacts produced by the chemicals used to prepare the cells for electron microscopy.

However, there is increasing evidence of compartmentalization in at least some prokaryotes. Research has revealed that at least some prokaryotes have microcompartments, such as carboxysomes. These subcellular compartments are 100–200 nm in diameter and are enclosed by a shell of proteins. Even more striking is the description of membrane-bounded magnetosomes in bacteria, reported in 2006.

The bacterial phylum Planctomycetota has revealed a number of compartmentalization features. The Planctomycetota cell plan includes intracytoplasmic membranes that separates the cytoplasm into paryphoplasm (an outer ribosome-free space) and pirellulosome (or riboplasm, an inner ribosome-containing space). Membrane-bounded anammoxosomes have been discovered in five Planctomycetota &quot;anammox&quot; genera, which perform anaerobic ammonium oxidation. In the Planctomycetota species &quot;Gemmata obscuriglobus&quot;, a nucleus-like structure surrounded by lipid membranes has been reported.

Compartmentalization is a feature of prokaryotic photosynthetic structures. Purple bacteria have &quot;chromatophores&quot;, which are reaction centers found in invaginations of the cell membrane. Green sulfur bacteria have chlorosomes, which are photosynthetic antenna complexes found bonded to cell membranes. Cyanobacteria have internal thylakoid membranes for light-dependent photosynthesis; studies have revealed that the cell membrane and the thylakoid membranes are not continuous with each other.

<text>Maria Louise Ramé (1 January 1839 – 25 January 1908), going by the name Marie Louise de la Ramée and known by the pseudonym Ouida ( ), was an English novelist. Ouida wrote more than 40 novels, as well as short stories, children&#x27;s books and essays. Moderately successful, she lived a life of luxury, entertaining many of the literary figures of the day.

&quot;Under Two Flags&quot; (1867), one of her most famous novels, described the British in Algeria. It expressed sympathy for the French colonists – with whom Ouida deeply identified – and, to some extent, the Arabs. The novel was adapted for the stage, and was filmed six times. Her 1872 novel &quot;A Dog of Flanders&quot; is considered a children&#x27;s classic in much of Asia. The American author Jack London cited her novel &quot;Signa&quot; as one of the reasons for his literary success. Her lavish lifestyle eventually led her to penury, and her works were put up for auction to pay her debts. She died in Italy from pneumonia. Soon after her death, her friends organized a public subscription in Bury St Edmunds, her birthplace, where they had a fountain for horses and dogs installed in her name.

==Early years==
Maria Louise Ramé was born at Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, England. Her mother, Susan Sutton, was a wine merchant&#x27;s daughter; her father was from France. She derived her pen name from her own childish pronunciation of her given name &quot;Louise&quot;. Her opinion of her birthplace fluctuated; she wrote:— &quot;That clean, quiet antiquated town, that always puts me in the mind of an old maid dressed for a party; that lowest and dreariest of Boroughs, where the streets are as full of grass as an acre of pasture land. Why, the inhabitants are driven to ringing their own doorbells lest they rust from lack of use.&quot;

==Career==

She moved into the Langham Hotel, London, in 1867. There, according to the hotel promotional materials, she wrote in bed, by candlelight, with the curtains drawn to keep out daylight and surrounded by purple flowers. She ran up huge hotel and florists&#x27; bills of up to 200 pounds per week and commanded soirées that included soldiers, politicians, literary lights (including Oscar Wilde, Algernon Swinburne, Robert Browning and Wilkie Collins), and artists (including John Millais). Many of her stories and characters were based upon people she invited to her salons at The Langham. Ouida was described by William Allingham in his diary of 1872 as of short stature, with a &quot;sinister, clever face&quot; and with a &quot;voice like a carving knife.&quot;

For many years Ouida lived in London, but in about 1871 she moved to Italy. In 1874, she settled permanently with her mother in Florence, and there long pursued her work as a novelist. At first, she rented an apartment at the Palazzo Vagnonville. Later she removed to the Villa Farinola at Scandicci, south of Bellosguardo, three miles from Florence, where she lived in great style, entertained largely, collected objets d&#x27;art, dressed expensively but not tastefully, drove good horses, and kept many dogs, to which she was deeply attached. She lived in Bagni di Lucca for a period, where there is a commemorative plaque on an outside wall. She declared that she never received from her publishers more than £1600 for any one novel, but that she found America &quot;a mine of wealth&quot;. In &quot;The Massarenes&quot; (1897) she gave a lurid picture of the parvenu millionaire in smart London society. This book was greatly prized by Ouida, and was very successful in terms of sales. Thenceforth she chiefly wrote for the leading magazines essays on social questions or literary criticisms, which were not remunerative. As before, she used her locations as inspiration for the setting and characters in her novels. The British and American colony in Florence was satirised in her novel, &quot;Friendship&quot; (1878). Ouida considered herself a serious artist. She was inspired by Byron in particular, and was interested in other artists of all kinds. Sympathetic descriptions of tragic painters and singers occurred in her later novels. Her work often combines romanticism with social criticism. In her novel, &quot;Puck&quot;, a talking dog narrates his views on society. &quot;Views and Opinions&quot; includes essays in her own voice on a variety of social topics. She was an animal lover and rescuer, and at times owned as many as thirty dogs.

Although successful, she did not manage her money well. A civil list pension of £150 a year was offered to her by the prime minister, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, on the application of Alfred Austin, George Wyndham, and Walburga, Lady Paget, which she reluctantly accepted after a request by her friend, Lady Howard of Glossop, on 16 July 1906.

She continued to live in Italy until her death on 25 January 1908, at 70 Via Zanardelli, Viareggio, of pneumonia. She is buried in the English Cemetery in Bagni di Lucca, Italy.

==Animal rights==

Ouida was an advocate of animal rights and a staunch anti-vivisectionist. She authored &quot;The New Priesthood: A Protest Against Vivisection&quot;, in 1897.

Ouida authored articles denouncing animal experimentation in &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and &quot;The Fortnightly Review&quot;. She opposed the fur trade and hunting.

==Literary career==
During her career, Ouida wrote more than 40 novels, children&#x27;s books and collections of short stories and essays. Her work had several phases.

In 1863, when she was 24, she published her first novel, &quot;Held in Bondage&quot;. (She later claimed to have written her well-received 1867 novel &quot;Idalia&quot; at the age of 16. It featured a rebellious ingénue heroine who was sympathetic to Italian independence.)

In her early period, her novels were considered &quot;racy&quot; and &quot;swashbuckling&quot;, a contrast to &quot;the moralistic prose of early Victorian literature&quot; (Tom Steele), and a hybrid of the sensationalism of the 1860s and the proto-adventure novels being published as part of the romanticisation of imperial expansion. Later her work was more typical of historical romance, though she never stopped commenting on contemporary society. She also wrote several stories for children.
&quot;Under Two Flags&quot; (1867), one of her most famous novels, described the British in Algeria. It expressed sympathy for the French colonists (called &quot;pieds noirs&quot;) – with whom Ouida deeply identified – and, to some extent, the Arabs. The novel was adapted for the stage, and was filmed six times. The American author Jack London cited her novel &quot;Signa&quot; (1875), which he read at the age of eight, as one of the eight reasons for his literary success.

==Influence==
The British composer Frederic Hymen Cowen and his librettists Gilbert Arthur à Beckett, H. A. Rudall, and Frederic Edward Weatherly acquired the rights to Ouida&#x27;s 1875 novel &quot;Signa&quot; to create an opera for Richard D&#x27;Oyly Carte&#x27;s Royal English Opera House to succeed Arthur Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; in 1891. Between Cowen not being ready with his work and the collapse of Carte&#x27;s venture, Cowen eventually took his finished opera &quot;Signa&quot; to Italy with an Italian translation of the original English text by G.A. Mazzucato. After many delays and production troubles, Cowen&#x27;s &quot;Signa&quot; was first performed in a reduced three-act version at the Teatro Dal Verme, Milan on 12 November 1893. After further revision and much cutting, it was later given in a two-act version at Covent Garden, London on 30 June 1894, at which point Cowen wondered if there was any sense left in the opera at all. Ouida&#x27;s impression of the work is unknown.

Later, Pietro Mascagni bought the rights for her story &quot;Two Little Wooden Shoes&quot;, intending to adapt it for an opera. His friend Giacomo Puccini became interested in the story and began a court action, claiming that because Ouida was in debt, the rights to her works should be put up for public auction to raise funds for creditors. He won the court challenge and persuaded his publisher Ricordi to bid for the story. After Ricordi won, Puccini lost interest and never composed the opera. Mascagni later composed one based on the story, under the title &quot;Lodoletta&quot;.

Spiritualist Helen Peters Nosworthy was wearing a locket containing Ouida&#x27;s portrait and signature that seemed to spell out ouija during a 1890 seance in which Nosworthy asked a talking board to name itself and it responded O-U-I-J-A. Nosworthy and brother-in-law Elijah Bond were granted a patent for the ouija board the following year.

==Legacy and honours==
Soon after her death, her friends organized a public subscription in Bury St Edmunds, where they had a fountain for horses and dogs installed in her name. Its inscription was composed by Lord Curzon:

Fellow author &quot;Rita&quot; Humphreys (Eliza Margaret Jane Humphreys, 1850–1938) wrote a eulogy to Ouida and sent it to the press soon after her death. It was read at the unveiling of Ouida&#x27;s memorial. During Rita&#x27;s youth, Ouida had been popular but the girl was forbidden to read her. She made up for it later by purchasing every book written by Ouida and keeping them in her library for the rest of her life.

<text>OS/2 is a proprietary computer operating system for x86 and PowerPC based personal computers. It was created and initially developed jointly by IBM and Microsoft, under the leadership of IBM software designer Ed Iacobucci, intended as a replacement for DOS. The first version was released in 1987. A feud between the two companies beginning in 1990 led to Microsoft’s leaving development solely to IBM, which continued development on its own. OS/2 Warp 4 in 1996 was the last major upgrade, after which IBM slowly halted the product as it failed to compete against Microsoft&#x27;s Windows; updated versions of OS/2 were released by IBM until 2001.

The name stands for &quot;Operating System/2&quot;, because it was introduced as part of the same generation change release as IBM&#x27;s &quot;Personal System/2 (PS/2)&quot; line of second-generation PCs. OS/2 was intended as a protected-mode successor of PC DOS targeting the Intel 80286 processor. Notably, basic system calls were modelled after MS-DOS calls; their names even started with &quot;Dos&quot; and it was possible to create &quot;Family Mode&quot; applications – text mode applications that could work on both systems. Because of this heritage, OS/2 shares similarities with Unix, Xenix, and Windows NT. OS/2 sales were largely concentrated in networked computing used by corporate professionals.

OS/2 2.0 was released in 1992 as the first 32-bit version as well as the first to be entirely developed by IBM, after Microsoft severed ties over a dispute over how to position OS/2 relative to Microsoft&#x27;s new Windows 3.1 operating environment. With OS/2 Warp 3 in 1994, IBM attempted to also target home consumers through a multi-million dollar advertising campaign. However it continued to struggle in the marketplace, partly due to strategic business measures imposed by Microsoft in the industry that have been considered anti-competitive. Following the failure of IBM&#x27;s Workplace OS project, OS/2 Warp 4 became the final major release in 1996; IBM discontinued its support for OS/2 on December 31, 2006. Since then, OS/2 has been developed, supported and sold by two different third-party vendors under license from IBM – first by Serenity Systems as eComStation from 2001 to 2011, and later by Arca Noae LLC as ArcaOS since 2017.

==Development==
===1985–1990: Joint IBM–Microsoft development===

The development of OS/2 began when IBM and Microsoft signed the &quot;Joint Development Agreement&quot; in August 1985. It was code-named &quot;CP/DOS&quot; and it took two years for the first product to be delivered.

====OS/2 1.0 (1987)====
OS/2 1.0 was announced in April 1987 and released in December. The original release only ran in text mode, and a GUI was introduced with OS/2 1.1 about a year later. OS/2 features an API for controlling the video display (VIO) and handling keyboard and mouse events so that programmers writing for protected mode need not call the BIOS or access hardware directly. Other development tools included a subset of the video and keyboard APIs as linkable libraries so that family mode programs are able to run under MS-DOS, and, in the OS/2 Extended Edition v1.0, a database engine called Database Manager or DBM (this was related to DB2, and should not be confused with the DBM family of database engines for Unix and Unix-like operating systems). A task-switcher named Program Selector was available through the Ctrl-Esc hotkey combination, allowing the user to select among multitasked text-mode sessions (or screen groups; each can run multiple programs).

Communications and database-oriented extensions were delivered in 1988, as part of OS/2 1.0 Extended Edition: SNA, X.25/APPC/LU 6.2, LAN Manager, Query Manager, SQL.

====OS/2 1.1 (1988)====
The promised user interface, Presentation Manager, was introduced with OS/2 1.1 in October 1988. It had a similar user interface to Windows 2.1, which was released in May of that year. (The interface was replaced in versions 1.2 and 1.3 by a look closer in appearance to Windows 3.0.)

The Extended Edition of 1.1, sold only through IBM sales channels, introduced distributed database support to IBM database systems and SNA communications support to IBM mainframe networks.

====OS/2 1.2 (1989)====
In 1989, Version 1.2 introduced Installable Filesystems and, notably, the HPFS filesystem. HPFS provided a number of improvements over the older FAT file system, including long filenames and a form of alternate data streams called Extended Attributes. In addition, extended attributes were also added to the FAT file system.

The Extended Edition of 1.2 introduced TCP/IP and Ethernet support.

OS/2- and Windows-related books of the late 1980s acknowledged the existence of both systems and promoted OS/2 as the system of the future.

===1990: Breakup===
====OS/2 1.3 (1990)====

The collaboration between IBM and Microsoft unravelled in 1990, between the releases of Windows 3.0 and OS/2 1.3. During this time, Windows 3.0 became a tremendous success, selling millions of copies in its first year. Much of its success was because Windows 3.0 (along with MS-DOS) was bundled with most new computers. OS/2, on the other hand, was available only as an additional stand-alone software package. In addition, OS/2 lacked device drivers for many common devices such as printers, particularly non-IBM hardware. Windows, on the other hand, supported a much larger variety of hardware. The increasing popularity of Windows prompted Microsoft to shift its development focus from cooperating on OS/2 with IBM to building its own business based on Windows.

Several technical and practical reasons contributed to this breakup. The two companies had significant differences in culture and vision. Microsoft favored the open hardware system approach that contributed to its success on the PC. IBM sought to use OS/2 to drive sales of its own hardware, and urged Microsoft to drop features, such as fonts, that IBM&#x27;s hardware did not support. Microsoft programmers also became frustrated with IBM&#x27;s bureaucracy and its use of lines of code to measure programmer productivity. IBM developers complained about the terseness and lack of comments in Microsoft&#x27;s code, while Microsoft developers complained that IBM&#x27;s code was bloated.

The two products have significant differences in API. OS/2 was announced when Windows 2.0 was near completion, and the Windows API already defined. However, IBM requested that this API be significantly changed for OS/2. Therefore, issues surrounding application compatibility appeared immediately. OS/2 designers hoped for source code conversion tools, allowing complete migration of Windows application source code to OS/2 at some point. However, OS/2 1.x did not gain enough momentum to allow vendors to avoid developing for both OS/2 and Windows in parallel.

OS/2 1.x targets the Intel 80286 processor and DOS fundamentally does not. IBM insisted on supporting the 80286 processor, with its 16-bit segmented memory mode, because of commitments made to customers who had purchased many 80286-based PS/2s as a result of IBM&#x27;s promises surrounding OS/2. Until release 2.0 in April 1992, OS/2 ran in 16-bit protected mode and therefore could not benefit from the Intel 80386&#x27;s much simpler 32-bit flat memory model and virtual 8086 mode features. This was especially painful in providing support for DOS applications. While, in 1988, Windows/386 2.1 could run several cooperatively multitasked DOS applications, including expanded memory (EMS) emulation, OS/2 1.3, released in 1991, was still limited to one &quot;DOS box&quot;.

Given these issues, Microsoft started to work in parallel on a version of Windows which was more future-oriented and more portable. The hiring of Dave Cutler, former VAX/VMS architect, in 1988 created an immediate competition with the OS/2 team, as Cutler did not think much of the OS/2 technology and wanted to build on his work on the MICA project at Digital rather than creating a &quot;DOS plus&quot;. His NT OS/2 was a completely new architecture.

IBM grew concerned about the delays in development of OS/2 2.0. Initially, the companies agreed that IBM would take over maintenance of OS/2 1.0 and development of OS/2 2.0, while Microsoft would continue development of OS/2 3.0. In the end, Microsoft decided to recast NT OS/2 3.0 as Windows NT, leaving all future OS/2 development to IBM. From a business perspective, it was logical to concentrate on a consumer line of operating systems based on DOS and Windows, and to prepare a new high-end system in such a way as to keep good compatibility with existing Windows applications. While it waited for this new high-end system to develop, Microsoft would still receive licensing money from Xenix and OS/2 sales. Windows NT&#x27;s OS/2 heritage can be seen in its initial support for the HPFS filesystem, text mode OS/2 1.x applications, and OS/2 LAN Manager network support. Some early NT materials even included OS/2 copyright notices embedded in the software.
One example of NT OS/2 1.x support is in the WIN2K resource kit. Windows NT could also support OS/2 1.x Presentation Manager and AVIO applications with the addition of the Windows NT Add-On Subsystem for Presentation Manager.

===1990–1996: Post-breakup===
====OS/2 2.0 and DOS compatibility (1992)====
OS/2 2.0 was released in April 1992. At the time, the suggested retail price was , while Windows retailed for .

OS/2 2.0 provided a 32-bit API for native programs, though the OS itself still contained some 16-bit code and drivers. It also included a new OOUI (object-oriented user interface) called the Workplace Shell. This was a fully object-oriented interface that was a significant departure from the previous GUI. Rather than merely providing an environment for program windows (such as the Program Manager), the Workplace Shell provided an environment in which the user could manage programs, files and devices by manipulating objects on the screen. With the Workplace Shell, everything in the system is an &quot;object&quot; to be manipulated.

OS/2 2.0 was touted by IBM as &quot;a better DOS than DOS and a better Windows than Windows&quot;. It managed this by including the fully-licensed MS-DOS 5.0, which had been patched and improved upon. For the first time, OS/2 was able to run more than one DOS application at a time. This was so effective that it allowed OS/2 to run a modified copy of Windows 3.0, itself a DOS extender, including Windows 3.0 applications.

Because of the limitations of the Intel 80286 processor, OS/2 1.x could run only one DOS program at a time, and did this in a way that allowed the DOS program to have total control over the computer. A problem in DOS mode could crash the entire computer. In contrast, OS/2 2.0 could leverage the virtual 8086 mode of the Intel 80386 processor to create a much safer virtual machine in which to run DOS programs. This included an extensive set of configuration options to optimize the performance and capabilities given to each DOS program. Any real-mode operating system (such as 8086 Xenix) could also be made to run using OS/2&#x27;s virtual machine capabilities, subject to certain direct hardware access limitations.

Like most 32-bit environments, OS/2 could not run protected-mode DOS programs using the older VCPI interface, unlike the Standard mode of Windows 3.1; it only supported programs written according to DPMI. (Microsoft discouraged the use of VCPI under Windows 3.1, however, due to performance degradation.)

Unlike Windows NT, OS/2 always allowed DOS programs the possibility of masking real hardware interrupts, so any DOS program could deadlock the machine in this way. OS/2 could, however, use a hardware watchdog on selected machines (notably IBM machines) to break out of such a deadlock. Later, release 3.0 leveraged the enhancements of newer Intel 80486 and Intel Pentium processors—the Virtual Interrupt Flag (VIF), which was part of the Virtual Mode Extensions (VME)—to solve this problem.
====OS/2 2.1 and Windows compatibility (1993)====
OS/2 2.1 was released in 1993. This version of OS/2 achieved compatibility with Windows 3.0 (and later Windows 3.1) by adapting Windows user-mode code components to run inside a virtual DOS machine (VDM). Originally, a nearly complete version of Windows code was included with OS/2 itself: Windows 3.0 in OS/2 2.0, and Windows 3.1 in OS/2 2.1. Later, IBM developed versions of OS/2 that would use whatever Windows version the user had installed previously, patching it on the fly, and sparing the cost of an additional Windows license. It could either run full-screen, using its own set of video drivers, or &quot;seamlessly,&quot; where Windows programs would appear directly on the OS/2 desktop. The process containing Windows was given fairly extensive access to hardware, especially video, and the result was that switching between a full-screen WinOS/2 session and the Workplace Shell could occasionally cause issues.

Because OS/2 only runs the user-mode system components of Windows, it is incompatible with Windows device drivers (VxDs) and applications that require them.

Multiple Windows applications run by default in a single Windows session – multitasking cooperatively and without memory protection – just as they would under native Windows 3.x. However, to achieve true isolation between Windows 3.x programs, OS/2 can also run multiple copies of Windows in parallel, with each copy residing in a separate VDM. The user can then optionally place each program either in its own Windows session – with preemptive multitasking and full memory protection &quot;between&quot; sessions, though not &quot;within&quot; them – or allow some applications to run together cooperatively in a shared Windows session while isolating other applications in one or more separate Windows sessions. At the cost of additional hardware resources, this approach can protect each program in any given Windows session (and each instance of Windows itself) from every other program running in any &quot;separate&quot; Windows session (though not from other programs running in the same Windows session).

Whether Windows applications are running in full-screen or windowed mode, and in one Windows session or several, it is possible to use DDE between OS/2 and Windows applications, and OLE between Windows applications only.

IBM&#x27;s OS/2 for Windows product (codename Ferengi), also known as &quot;OS/2, Special Edition&quot;, was interpreted as a deliberate strategy &quot;of cashing in on the pervasive success of the Microsoft platform&quot; but risked confusing consumers with the notion that the product was a mere accessory or utility running on Windows such as Norton Desktop for Windows when, in fact, it was &quot;a complete, modern, multi-tasking, pre-emptive operating system&quot;, itself hosting Windows instead of running on it. Available on CD-ROM or 18 floppy disks, the product documentation reportedly suggested Windows as a prerequisite for installing the product, also being confined to its original FAT partition, whereas the product apparently supported the later installation of Windows running from an HPFS partition, particularly beneficial for users of larger hard drives. Windows compatibility, relying on patching specific memory locations, was reportedly broken by the release of Windows 3.11, prompting accusations of arbitrary changes to Windows in order to perpetrate &quot;a deliberate act of Microsoft sabotage&quot; against IBM&#x27;s product.

====OS/2 Warp 3 (1994)====
Released in 1994, OS/2 version 3.0 was labelled as OS/2 Warp to highlight the new performance benefits, and generally to freshen the product image. &quot;Warp&quot; had originally been the internal IBM name for the release: IBM claimed that it had used &quot;Star Trek&quot; terms as internal names for prior OS/2 releases, and that this one seemed appropriate for external use as well. At the launch of OS/2 Warp in 1994, Patrick Stewart was to be the Master of Ceremonies; however Kate Mulgrew of the then-upcoming series &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; substituted for him at the last minute.

OS/2 Warp offers a host of benefits over OS/2 2.1, notably broader hardware support, greater multimedia capabilities, Internet-compatible networking, and it includes a basic office application suite known as IBM Works. It was released in two versions: the less expensive &quot;Red Spine&quot; and the more expensive &quot;Blue Spine&quot; (named for the color of their boxes). &quot;Red Spine&quot; was designed to support Microsoft Windows applications by utilizing any existing installation of Windows on the computer&#x27;s hard drive. &quot;Blue Spine&quot; includes Windows support in its own installation, and so can support Windows applications without a Windows installation. As most computers were sold with Microsoft Windows pre-installed and the price was less, &quot;Red Spine&quot; was the more popular product. OS/2 Warp Connect—which has full LAN client support built-in—followed in mid-1995. Warp Connect was nicknamed &quot;Grape&quot;.

In OS/2 2.0, most performance-sensitive subsystems, including the graphics (Gre) and multimedia (MMPM/2) systems, were updated to 32-bit code in a fixpack, and included as part of OS/2 2.1. Warp 3 brought about a fully 32-bit windowing system, while Warp 4 introduced the object-oriented 32-bit GRADD display driver model.

====Workplace OS (1995) ====

In 1991, IBM started development on an intended replacement for OS/2 called Workplace OS. This was an entirely new product, brand new code, that borrowed only a few sections of code from both the existing OS/2 and AIX products. It used an entirely new microkernel code base, intended (eventually) to host several of IBM&#x27;s operating systems (including OS/2) as microkernel &quot;personalities&quot;. It also included major new architectural features including a system registry, JFS, support for UNIX graphics libraries, and a new driver model.

Workplace OS was developed solely for POWER platforms, and IBM intended to market a full line of PowerPCs in an effort to take over the market from Intel. A mission was formed to create prototypes of these machines and they were disclosed to several corporate customers, all of whom raised issues with the idea of dropping Intel.

Advanced plans for the new code base would eventually include replacement of the OS/400 operating system by Workplace OS, as well as a microkernel product that would have been used in industries such as telecommunications and set-top television receivers.

A partially functional pre-alpha version of Workplace OS was demonstrated at Comdex, where a bemused Bill Gates stopped by the booth. The second and last time it would be shown in public was at an OS/2 user group in Phoenix, Arizona; the pre-alpha code refused to boot.

It was released in 1995. But with $990 million being spent per year on development of this as well as Workplace OS, and no possible profit or widespread adoption, the end of the entire Workplace OS and OS/2 product line was near.

====OS/2 Warp 4 (1996)====

In 1996, Warp 4 added Java and speech recognition software. IBM also released server editions of Warp 3 and Warp 4 which bundled IBM&#x27;s LAN Server product directly into the operating system installation. A personal version of Lotus Notes was also included, with a number of template databases for contact management, brainstorming, and so forth. The UK-distributed free demo CD-ROM of OS/2 Warp essentially contained the entire OS and was easily, even accidentally, cracked, meaning that even people who liked it did not have to buy it. This was seen as a backdoor tactic to increase the number of OS/2 users, in the belief that this would increase sales and demand for third-party applications, and thus strengthen OS/2&#x27;s desktop numbers. This suggestion was bolstered by the fact that this demo version had replaced another which was not so easily cracked, but which had been released with trial versions of various applications. In 2000, the July edition of &quot;Australian Personal Computer&quot; magazine bundled software CD-ROMs, included a full version of Warp 4 that required no activation and was essentially a free release. Special versions of OS/2 2.11 and Warp 4 also included symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) support.

OS/2 sales were largely concentrated in networked computing used by corporate professionals; however, by the early 1990s, it was overtaken by Microsoft Windows NT. While OS/2 was arguably technically superior to Microsoft Windows 95, OS/2 failed to develop much penetration in the consumer and stand-alone desktop PC segments; there were reports that it could not be installed properly on IBM&#x27;s own Aptiva series of home PCs. Microsoft made an offer in 1994 where IBM would receive the same terms as Compaq (the largest PC manufacturer at the time) for a license of Windows 95, if IBM ended development of OS/2 completely. IBM refused and instead went with an &quot;IBM First&quot; strategy of promoting OS/2 Warp and disparaging Windows, as IBM aimed to drive sales of its own software as well as hardware. By 1995, Windows 95 negotiations between IBM and Microsoft, which were already difficult, stalled when IBM purchased Lotus SmartSuite, which would have directly competed with Microsoft Office. As a result of the dispute, IBM signed the license agreement 15 minutes before Microsoft&#x27;s Windows 95 launch event, which was later than their competitors and this badly hurt sales of IBM PCs. IBM officials later conceded that OS/2 would not have been a viable operating system to keep them in the PC business.

===1996–2001: Downsizing===

A project was launched internally by IBM to evaluate the looming competitive situation with Microsoft Windows 95. Primary concerns included the major code quality issues in the existing OS/2 product (resulting in over 20 service packs, each requiring more diskettes than the original installation), and the ineffective and heavily matrixed development organization in Boca Raton (where the consultants reported that &quot;basically, everybody reports to everybody&quot;) and Austin.

That study, tightly classified as &quot;Registered Confidential&quot; and printed only in numbered copies, identified untenable weaknesses and failures across the board in the Personal Systems Division as well as across IBM as a whole. This resulted in a decision being made at a level above the Division to cut over 95% of the overall budget for the entire product line, end all new development (including Workplace OS), eliminate the Boca Raton development lab, end all sales and marketing efforts of the product, and lay off over 1,300 development individuals (as well as sales and support personnel). $990 million had been spent in the last full year. Warp 4 became the last distributed version of OS/2.

===2001–2006: Discontinuation and end-of-life===

Although a small and dedicated community remains faithful to OS/2, OS/2 failed to catch on in the mass market and is little used outside certain niches where IBM traditionally had a stronghold. For example, many bank installations, especially automated teller machines, run OS/2 with a customized user interface; French SNCF national railways used OS/2 1.x in thousands of ticket selling machines. Telecom companies such as Nortel used OS/2 in some voicemail systems. Also, OS/2 was used for the host PC used to control the Satellite Operations Support System equipment installed at NPR member stations from 1994 to 2007, and used to receive the network&#x27;s programming via satellite.

Although IBM began indicating shortly after the release of Warp 4 that OS/2 would eventually be withdrawn, the company did not end support until December 31, 2006, with sales of OS/2 stopping on December 23, 2005. The latest IBM OS/2 Warp version is 4.52, which was released for both desktop and server systems in December 2001.

IBM is still delivering defect support for a fee. IBM urges customers to migrate their often highly complex applications to e-business technologies such as Java in a platform-neutral manner. Once application migration is completed, IBM recommends migration to a different operating system, suggesting Linux as an alternative.

===2001–present: Third-party development===

After IBM discontinued development of OS/2, various third parties approached IBM to take over future development of the operating system. The OS/2 software vendor Stardock made such a proposal to IBM in 1999, but it was not followed through by the company. Serenity Systems succeeded in negotiating an agreement with IBM, and began reselling OS/2 as eComStation in 2001. eComStation is now sold by XEU.com, the most recent version (2.1) was released in 2011. In 2015, Arca Noae, LLC announced that they had secured an agreement with IBM to resell OS/2. They released the first version of their OS/2-based operating system in 2017 as ArcaOS. As of 2023, there have been multiple releases of ArcaOS, and it remains under active development.

====Petitions for open source====
Many people hoped that IBM would release OS/2 or a significant part of it as open source. Petitions were held in 2005 and 2007, but IBM refused them, citing legal and technical reasons. It is unlikely that the entire OS will be open at any point in the future because it contains third-party code to which IBM does not have copyright, and much of this code is from Microsoft. IBM also once engaged in a technology transfer with Commodore, licensing Amiga technology for OS/2 2.0 and above, in exchange for the REXX scripting language. This means that OS/2 may have some code that was not written by IBM, which can therefore prevent the OS from being re-announced as open-sourced in the future. On the other hand, IBM donated Object REXX for Windows and OS/2 to the &quot;Open Object REXX&quot; project maintained by the &quot;REXX Language Association&quot; on SourceForge.

There was a petition, arranged by OS2World, to open parts of the OS. Open source operating systems such as Linux have already profited from OS/2 indirectly through IBM&#x27;s release of the improved JFS file system, which was ported from the OS/2 code base. As IBM didn&#x27;t release the source of the OS/2 JFS driver, developers ported the Linux driver back to eComStation and added the functionality to boot from a JFS partition. This new JFS driver has been integrated into eComStation v2.0, and later into ArcaOS 5.0.

==Summary of releases==
Release dates refer to the US English editions unless otherwise noted.
==Features and technology==

===User interface===
The graphic system has a layer named Presentation Manager that manages windows, fonts, and icons. This is similar in functionality to a non-networked version of X11 or the Windows GDI. On top of this lies the Workplace Shell (WPS) introduced in OS/2 2.0. WPS is an object-oriented shell allowing the user to perform traditional computing tasks such as accessing files, printers, launching legacy programs, and advanced object oriented tasks using built-in and third-party application objects that extended the shell in an integrated fashion not available on any other mainstream operating system. WPS follows IBM&#x27;s Common User Access user interface standards.

WPS represents objects such as disks, folders, files, program objects, and printers using the System Object Model (SOM), which allows code to be shared among applications, possibly written in different programming languages. A distributed version called DSOM allowed objects on different computers to communicate. DSOM is based on CORBA. The object oriented aspect of SOM is similar to, and a direct competitor to, Microsoft&#x27;s Component Object Model, though it is implemented in a radically different manner; for instance, one of the most notable differences between SOM and COM is SOM&#x27;s support for inheritance (one of the most fundamental concepts of OO programming)—COM does not have such support. SOM and DSOM are no longer being developed.

The multimedia capabilities of OS/2 are accessible through Media Control Interface commands.
The last update (bundled with the IBM version of Netscape Navigator plugins) added support for MPEG files. Support for newer formats such as PNG, progressive JPEG, DivX, Ogg, and MP3 comes from third parties. Sometimes it is integrated with the multimedia system, but in other offers it comes as standalone applications.

===Networking===

The TCP/IP stack is based on the open source BSD stack as visible with SCCS what compatible tools. IBM included tools such as ftp and telnet and even servers for both commands. IBM sold several networking extensions including NFS support and an X11 server.
===Drivers===
Hardware vendors were reluctant to support device drivers for alternative operating systems including OS/2, leaving users with few choices from a select few vendors. To relieve this issue for video cards, IBM licensed a reduced version of the Scitech display drivers, allowing users to choose from a wide selection of cards supported through Scitech&#x27;s modular driver design.
===Virtualization===
OS/2 has historically been more difficult to run in a virtual machine than most other legacy x86 operating systems because of its extensive reliance on the full set of features of the x86 CPU; in particular, OS/2&#x27;s use of ring 2 prevented it from running in early versions of VMware. Newer versions of VMware provide official support for OS/2, specifically for eComStation.

VirtualPC from Microsoft (originally Connectix) has been able to run OS/2 without hardware virtualization support for many years. It also provided &quot;additions&quot; code which greatly improves host–guest OS interactions in OS/2. The additions are not provided with the current version of VirtualPC, but the version last included with a release may still be used with current releases. At one point, OS/2 was a supported host for VirtualPC in addition to a guest. Note that OS/2 runs only as a guest on those versions of VirtualPC that use virtualization (x86 based hosts) and not those doing full emulation (VirtualPC for Mac).

VirtualBox from Oracle Corporation (originally InnoTek, later Sun) supports OS/2 1.x, Warp 3 through 4.5, and eComStation as well as &quot;Other OS/2&quot; as guests. However, attempting to run OS/2 and eComStation can still be difficult, if not impossible, because of the strict requirements of VT-x/AMD-V hardware-enabled virtualization and only ACP2/MCP2 is reported to work in a reliable manner.

ArcaOS supports being run as a virtual machine guest inside VirtualBox, VMware ESXi and VMWare Workstation. It ships with VirtualBox Guest Additions, and driver improvements to improve performance as a guest operating system.

The difficulties in efficiently running OS/2 have, at least once, created an opportunity for a new virtualization company. A large bank in Moscow needed a way to use OS/2 on newer hardware that OS/2 did not support. As virtualization software is an easy way around this, the company desired to run OS/2 under a hypervisor. Once it was determined that VMware was not a possibility, it hired a group of Russian software developers to write a host-based hypervisor that would officially support OS/2. Thus, the Parallels, Inc. company and their Parallels Workstation product was born.

===Security niche===
OS/2 has few native computer viruses; while it is not invulnerable by design, its reduced market share appears to have discouraged virus writers. There are, however, OS/2-based antivirus programs, dealing with DOS viruses and Windows viruses that could pass through an OS/2 server.

===Problems===
Some problems were classic subjects of comparison with other operating systems:

*&quot;Synchronous input queue (SIQ)&quot;: if a GUI application was not servicing its &quot;window messages&quot;, the entire GUI system could get stuck and a reboot was required. This problem was considerably reduced with later Warp 3 fixpacks and refined by Warp 4, by taking control over the application after it had not responded for several seconds.
*&quot;No unified object handles (OS/2 v2.11 and earlier)&quot;: The availability of threads probably led system designers to overlook mechanisms which allow a single thread to wait for different types of asynchronous events at the same time, for example the keyboard and the mouse in a &quot;console&quot; program. Even though &quot;select&quot; was added later, it only worked on network sockets. In case of a console program, dedicating a separate thread for waiting on each source of events made it difficult to properly release all the input devices before starting other programs in the same &quot;session&quot;. As a result, console programs usually polled the keyboard and the mouse alternately, which resulted in wasted CPU and a characteristic &quot;jerky&quot; reactivity to user input. In OS/2 3.0 IBM introduced a new call for this specific problem.

==Historical uses==

OS/2 has been widely used by Iran Export Bank (Bank Saderat Iran) in their teller machines, ATMs and local servers (over 35,000 working stations). As of 2011, the bank moved to virtualize and renew their infrastructure by moving OS/2 to Virtual Machines running over Windows.

OS/2 was widely used by Brazilian banks. Banco do Brasil had a peak 10,000 machines running OS/2 Warp in the 1990s. OS/2 was used in automated teller machines until 2006. The workstations and automated teller machines and attendant computers have been migrated to Linux.

OS/2 has been used in the banking industry. Suncorp bank in Australia still ran its ATM network on OS/2 as late as 2002. ATMs at Perisher Blue used OS/2 as late as 2009, and even the turn of the decade.

OS/2 was widely adopted by accounting professionals and auditing companies. In mid-1990s native 32-bit accounting software were well developed and serving corporate markets.

OS/2 ran the faulty baggage handling system at Denver International Airport. The OS was eventually scrapped, but the software written for the system led to massive delays in the opening of the new airport. The OS itself was not at fault, but the software written to run on the OS was. The baggage handling system was eventually removed.

OS/2 was used by radio personality Howard Stern. He once had a 10-minute on-air rant about OS/2 versus Windows 95 and recommended OS/2. He also used OS/2 on his IBM 760CD laptop.

OS/2 was used as part of the Satellite Operations Support System (SOSS) for NPR&#x27;s Public Radio Satellite System. SOSS was a computer-controlled system using OS/2 that NPR member stations used to receive programming feeds via satellite. SOSS was introduced in 1994 using OS/2 3.0, and was retired in 2007, when NPR switched over to its successor, the ContentDepot.

OS/2 was used to control the SkyTrain automated light rail system in Vancouver, Canada until the late 2000s when it was replaced by Windows XP.

OS/2 was used in the London Underground Jubilee Line Extension Signals Control System (JLESCS) in London, England. This control system delivered by Alcatel was in use from 1999 to 2011 i.e. between abandonment before opening of the line&#x27;s unimplemented original automatic train control system and the present SelTrac system. JLESCS did not provide automatic train operation only manual train supervision. Six OS/2 local site computers were distributed along the railway between Stratford and Westminster, the shunting tower at Stratford Market Depot, and several formed the central equipment located at Neasden Depot. It was once intended to cover the rest of the line between Green Park and Stanmore but this was never introduced.

OS/2 has been used by The Co-operative Bank in the UK for its domestic call centre staff, using a bespoke program created to access customer accounts which cannot easily be migrated to Windows.

OS/2 has been used by the Stop &amp; Shop supermarket chain (and has been installed in new stores as recently as March 2010).

OS/2 has been used on ticket machines for Tramlink in outer-London.

OS/2 has been used in New York City&#x27;s subway system for MetroCards.
Rather than interfacing with the user, it connects simple computers and the mainframes.
When NYC MTA finishes its transition to contactless payment, OS/2 will be removed.

OS/2 was used in checkout systems at Safeway supermarkets.

OS/2 was used by Trenitalia, both for the desktops at Ticket Counters and for the Automatic Ticket Counters up to 2011. Incidentally, the Automatic Ticket Counters with OS/2 were more reliable than the current ones running a flavor of Windows.

OS/2 was used as the main operating system for Abbey National General Insurance motor and home direct call centre products using the PMSC Series III insurance platform on DB2.2 from 1996 to 2001.

==Awards==
&quot;BYTE&quot; in 1989 listed OS/2 as among the &quot;Excellence&quot; winners of the BYTE Awards, stating that it &quot;is today where the Macintosh was in 1984: It&#x27;s a development platform in search of developers&quot;. The magazine predicted that &quot;When it&#x27;s complete and bug-free, when it can really use the 80386, and when more desktops sport OS/2-capable PCs, OS/2 will—deservedly—supersede DOS. But even as it stands, OS/2 is a milestone product&quot;.

In March 1995 OS/2 won seven awards
* InfoWorld Product of the Year.
* Five Awards at CeBIT.
** PC Professional Magazine - Innovation of the Year award.
** CHIP Magazine named OS/2 Warp the Operating System of the Year.
** DOS International named OS/2 Warp the Operating System of the Year.
** 1+1 Magazine awarded it with the Software Marketing Quality award.
** Industrie Forum awarded it with its Design Excellence.
* SPA Best Business Software Award.

<doc id="22413" wikidata="Q44279" url="?curid=22413" title="Oliver Cromwell">
<text>Oliver Cromwell (25 April 15993 September 1658) was an English statesman, politician, and soldier, widely regarded as one of the most important figures in British history. He came to prominence during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, initially as a senior commander in the Parliamentarian army and latterly as a politician. A leading advocate of the execution of Charles I in January 1649, which led to the establishment of the Commonwealth of England, he ruled as Lord Protector from December 1653 until his death in September 1658. 

Although elected member of parliament for Huntingdon in 1628, much of Cromwell&#x27;s life prior to 1640 was marked by failure. He briefly contemplated emigration to New England, but became a religious Independent in the 1630s and thereafter believed his successes were the result of divine providence. In 1640, Cromwell was returned as MP for Cambridge in the Short and Long Parliaments. He joined the Parliamentarian army when the First English Civil War began in August 1642 and quickly demonstrated his military abilities. In 1645, he was appointed commander of the New Model Army cavalry under Sir Thomas Fairfax, and played a key role in winning the English Civil War.

The death of Charles I and exile of his son, followed by military victories in Ireland and Scotland, firmly established the Commonwealth and Cromwell&#x27;s dominance of the new regime. In December 1653, he was named Lord Protector, a position he retained until his death in September 1658, when he was succeeded by his son Richard, whose weakness led to a power vacuum. This culminated in the 1660 Stuart Restoration, after which Cromwell&#x27;s body was removed from Westminster Abbey and re-hanged at Tyburn on 30 January 1661. His head was cut off and displayed on the roof of Westminster Hall. It remained there until at least 1684 (see Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s head).

Winston Churchill described Cromwell as a military dictator, while others view him a hero of liberty. He remains a controversial figure due to his use of military force to acquire and retain political power, his role in the execution of Charles I and the brutality of his 1649 campaign in Ireland. The debate over his historical reputation continues. First proposed in 1856, his statue outside the Houses of Parliament was not erected until 1895, most of the funds being privately supplied by Prime Minister Lord Rosebery.

== Biography ==
Cromwell was born in Huntingdon on 25 April 1599 to Robert Cromwell and his second wife Elizabeth, daughter of William Steward. The family&#x27;s estate derived from Oliver&#x27;s great-great-grandfather Morgan ap William, a brewer from Glamorgan, Wales, who settled at Putney and married Katherine Cromwell (born 1482), the sister of Thomas Cromwell, who would become the famous chief minister to Henry VIII. The Cromwells acquired great wealth as occasional beneficiaries of Thomas&#x27;s administration of the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Morgan ap William was a son of William ap Yevan of Wales. The family line continued through Richard Williams (alias Cromwell), ( 1500–1544), Henry Williams (alias Cromwell), ( 1524 – 6 January 1604), then to Oliver&#x27;s father Robert Williams, alias Cromwell ( 1560–1617), who married Elizabeth Steward ( 1564–1654), probably in 1591. They had ten children, but Oliver, the fifth child, was the only boy to survive infancy.

Cromwell&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Sir Henry Williams, was one of the two wealthiest landowners in Huntingdonshire. Cromwell&#x27;s father was of modest means but still a member of the landed gentry. As a younger son with many siblings, Robert inherited only a house at Huntingdon and a small amount of land. This land would have generated an income of up to £300 a year, near the bottom of the range of gentry incomes. In 1654, Cromwell said, &quot;I was by birth a gentleman, living neither in considerable height, nor yet in obscurity.&quot;

Oliver Cromwell was baptised on 29 April 1599 at St John&#x27;s Church, and attended Huntingdon Grammar School. He went on to study at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, then a recently founded college with a strong Puritan ethos. He left in June 1617 without taking a degree, immediately after his father&#x27;s death. Early biographers claim that he then attended Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, but the Inn&#x27;s archives retain no record of him. Antonia Fraser concludes that it is likely that he did train at one of the London Inns of Court during this time. His grandfather, his father, and two of his uncles had attended Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, and Cromwell sent his son Richard there in 1647.

Cromwell probably returned home to Huntingdon after his father&#x27;s death. As his mother was widowed, and his seven sisters unmarried, he would have been needed at home to help his family.

===Marriage and family===
Cromwell married Elizabeth Bourchier (1598–1665) on 22 August 1620 at St Giles-without-Cripplegate, Fore Street, London. Elizabeth&#x27;s father, Sir James Bourchier, was a London leather-merchant who owned extensive lands in Essex and had strong connections with Puritan gentry families there. The marriage brought Cromwell into contact with Oliver St John and leading members of London&#x27;s merchant community, and behind them the influence of the Earls of Warwick and Holland. A place in this influential network proved crucial to Cromwell&#x27;s military and political career. The couple had nine children:
* Robert (1621–1639), died while away at school
* Oliver (1622–1644), died of typhoid fever while serving as a Parliamentarian officer
* Bridget (1624–1662), married (1) Henry Ireton, (2) Charles Fleetwood
* Richard (1626–1712), his father&#x27;s successor as Lord Protector, married Dorothy Maijor
* Henry (1628–1674), later Lord Deputy of Ireland (in office: 1657–1659), married Elizabeth Russell (daughter of Sir Francis Russell)
* Elizabeth (1629–1658), married John Claypole
* James (b. &amp; d. 1632), died in infancy
* Mary (1637–1713), married Thomas Belasyse, 1st Earl Fauconberg
* Frances (1638–1720), married (1) Robert Rich (1634–1658), son of Robert Rich, 3rd Earl of Warwick, (2) Sir John Russell, 3rd Baronet

===Crisis and recovery===
Little evidence exists of Cromwell&#x27;s religion in his early years. His 1626 letter to Henry Downhall, an Arminian minister, suggests that he had yet to be influenced by radical Puritanism. But there is evidence that Cromwell underwent a personal crisis during the late 1620s and early 1630s. In 1628 he was elected to Parliament from the Huntingdonshire county town of Huntingdon. Later that year, he sought treatment for a variety of physical and emotional ailments, including &quot;valde melancholicus&quot; (depression), from the Swiss-born London doctor Théodore de Mayerne. In 1629, Cromwell became involved in a dispute among the gentry of Huntingdon involving a new charter for the town. As a result, he was called before the Privy Council in 1630.

In 1631, likely as a result of the dispute, Cromwell sold most of his properties in Huntingdon and moved to a farmstead in nearby St Ives. This move, a significant step down in society for the Cromwells, also had significant emotional and spiritual impact on Cromwell; an extant 1638 letter from him to his cousin, the wife of Oliver St John, gives an account of his spiritual awakening at this time. In the letter, Cromwell, describing himself as having been the &quot;chief of sinners&quot;, describes his calling as among &quot;the congregation of the firstborn&quot;. The letter&#x27;s language, particularly the inclusion of numerous biblical quotations, shows Cromwell&#x27;s belief that he was saved from his previous sins by God&#x27;s mercy, and indicates his religiously Independent beliefs, chief among them that the Reformation had not gone far enough, that much of England was still living in sin, and that Catholic beliefs and practices must be fully removed from the church. It appears that in 1634 Cromwell attempted to emigrate to what became the Connecticut Colony in the Americas, but was prevented by the government from leaving.

Along with his brother Henry, Cromwell had kept a smallholding of chickens and sheep, selling eggs and wool to support himself, his lifestyle resembling that of a yeoman farmer. In 1636 Cromwell inherited control of various properties in Ely from his uncle on his mother&#x27;s side, and his uncle&#x27;s job as tithe-collector for Ely Cathedral. As a result, his income is likely to have risen to around £300–400 per year; by the end of the 1630s Cromwell had returned to the ranks of acknowledged gentry. He had become a committed Puritan and had established important family links to leading families in London and Essex.

=== Member of Parliament: 1628–29 and 1640–42 ===

Cromwell became the Member of Parliament for Huntingdon in the Parliament of 1628–1629, as a client of the Montagu family of Hinchingbrooke House. He made little impression: parliamentary records show only one speech (against the Arminian Bishop Richard Neile), which was poorly received. After dissolving this Parliament, Charles I ruled without a Parliament for the next 11 years. When Charles faced the Scottish rebellion in the Bishops&#x27; Wars, lack of funds forced him to call a Parliament again in 1640. Cromwell was returned to this Parliament as member for Cambridge, but it lasted for only three weeks and became known as the Short Parliament. Cromwell moved his family from Ely to London in 1640.

A second Parliament was called later the same year and became known as the Long Parliament. Cromwell was again returned as member for Cambridge. As with the Parliament of 1628–29, it is likely that he owed his position to the patronage of others, which might explain why in the first week of the Parliament he was in charge of presenting a petition for the release of John Lilburne, who had become a Puritan cause célèbre after his arrest for importing religious tracts from the Netherlands. For the Long Parliament&#x27;s first two years, Cromwell was linked to the godly group of aristocrats in the House of Lords and Members of the House of Commons with whom he had established familial and religious links in the 1630s, such as the Earls of Essex, Warwick and Bedford, Oliver St John and Viscount Saye and Sele. At this stage, the group had an agenda of reformation: the executive checked by regular parliaments, and the moderate extension of liberty of conscience. Cromwell appears to have taken a role in some of this group&#x27;s political manoeuvres. In May 1641, for example, he put forward the second reading of the Annual Parliaments Bill, and he later took a role in drafting the Root and Branch Bill for the abolition of episcopacy.

==== English Civil War begins ====

Failure to resolve the issues before the Long Parliament led to armed conflict between Parliament and Charles I in late 1642, the beginning of the English Civil War. Before he joined Parliament&#x27;s forces, Cromwell&#x27;s only military experience was in the trained bands, the local county militia. He recruited a cavalry troop in Cambridgeshire after blocking a valuable shipment of silver plate from Cambridge colleges that was meant for the King. Cromwell and his troop then rode to, but arrived too late to take part in, the indecisive Battle of Edgehill on 23 October 1642. The troop was recruited to be a full regiment in the winter of 1642–43, making up part of the Eastern Association under the Earl of Manchester. Cromwell gained experience in successful actions in East Anglia in 1643, notably at the Battle of Gainsborough on 28 July. He was subsequently appointed governor of the Isle of Ely and a colonel in the Eastern Association.

===== Marston Moor, 1644 =====
By the time of the Battle of Marston Moor in July 1644, Cromwell had risen to the rank of lieutenant general of horse in Manchester&#x27;s army. His cavalry&#x27;s success in breaking the ranks of the Royalist cavalry and then attacking their infantry from the rear at Marston Moor was a major factor in the Parliamentarian victory. Cromwell fought at the head of his troops in the battle and was slightly wounded in the neck, stepping away briefly to receive treatment but returning to help secure the victory. After Cromwell&#x27;s nephew was killed at Marston Moor, he wrote a famous letter to his brother-in-law. Marston Moor secured the north of England for the Parliamentarians but failed to end Royalist resistance.

The indecisive outcome of the Second Battle of Newbury in October meant that by the end of 1644 the war still showed no sign of ending. Cromwell&#x27;s experience at Newbury, where Manchester had let the King&#x27;s army slip out of an encircling manoeuvre, led to a serious dispute with Manchester, whom he believed to be less than enthusiastic in his conduct of the war. Manchester later accused Cromwell of recruiting men of &quot;low birth&quot; as officers in the army, to which he replied: &quot;If you choose godly honest men to be captains of horse, honest men will follow them ... I would rather have a plain russet-coated captain who knows what he fights for and loves what he knows than that which you call a gentleman and is nothing else&quot;. At this time, Cromwell also fell into dispute with Major-General Lawrence Crawford, a Scottish Covenanter attached to Manchester&#x27;s army, who objected to Cromwell&#x27;s encouragement of unorthodox Independents and Anabaptists. He was also charged with familism by Scottish Presbyterian Samuel Rutherford in response to his letter to the House of Commons in 1645.

===== Battle of Naseby, 1645 =====

At the critical Battle of Naseby in June 1645, the New Model Army smashed the King&#x27;s major army. Cromwell led his wing with great success at Naseby, again routing the Royalist cavalry. At the Battle of Langport on 10 July, Cromwell participated in the defeat of the last sizeable Royalist field army. Naseby and Langport effectively ended the King&#x27;s hopes of victory, and the subsequent Parliamentarian campaigns involved taking the remaining fortified Royalist positions in the west of England. In October 1645, Cromwell besieged and took the wealthy and formidable Catholic fortress Basing House, later to be accused of killing 100 of its 300-man Royalist garrison after its surrender. He also took part in successful sieges at Bridgwater, Sherborne, Bristol, Devizes, and Winchester, then spent the first half of 1646 mopping up resistance in Devon and Cornwall. Charles I surrendered to the Scots on 5 May 1646, effectively ending the First English Civil War. Cromwell and Fairfax took the Royalists&#x27; formal surrender at Oxford in June.

==== Politics: 1647–49 ====
In February 1647, Cromwell suffered from an illness that kept him out of political life for over a month. By the time he recovered, the Parliamentarians were split over the issue of the King. A majority in both Houses pushed for a settlement that would pay off the Scottish army, disband much of the New Model Army, and restore Charles I in return for a Presbyterian settlement of the church. Cromwell rejected the Scottish model of Presbyterianism, which threatened to replace one authoritarian hierarchy with another. The New Model Army, radicalised by Parliament&#x27;s failure to pay the wages it was owed, petitioned against these changes, but the Commons declared the petition unlawful. In May 1647 Cromwell was sent to the army&#x27;s headquarters in Saffron Walden to negotiate with them, but failed to agree.

In June 1647, a troop of cavalry under Cornet George Joyce seized the King from Parliament&#x27;s imprisonment. With the King now present, Cromwell was eager to find out what conditions the King would acquiesce to if his authority was restored. The King appeared to be willing to compromise, so Cromwell employed his son-in-law, Henry Ireton, to draw up proposals for a constitutional settlement. Proposals were drafted multiple times with different changes until finally the &quot;Heads of Proposals&quot; pleased Cromwell in principle and allowed for further negotiations. It was designed to check the powers of the executive, to set up regularly elected parliaments, and to restore a non-compulsory episcopalian settlement.

Many in the army, such as the Levellers led by John Lilburne, thought this was not enough and demanded full political equality for all men, leading to tense debates in Putney during the autumn of 1647 between Fairfax, Cromwell and Ireton on the one hand, and Levellers like Colonel Rainsborough on the other. The Putney Debates broke up without reaching a resolution.

The failure to conclude a political agreement with the King led eventually to the outbreak of the Second English Civil War in 1648, when the King tried to regain power by force of arms. Cromwell first put down a Royalist uprising in south Wales led by Rowland Laugharne, winning back Chepstow Castle on 25 May and six days later forcing the surrender of Tenby. The castle at Carmarthen was destroyed by burning; the much stronger castle at Pembroke fell only after an eight-week siege. Cromwell dealt leniently with ex-Royalist soldiers, but less so with those who had formerly been members of the parliamentary army, John Poyer eventually being executed in London after the drawing of lots.

Cromwell then marched north to deal with a pro-Royalist Scottish army (the Engagers) who had invaded England. At Preston, in sole command for the first time and with an army of 9,000, he won a decisive victory against an army twice as large.

During 1648, Cromwell&#x27;s letters and speeches started to become heavily based on biblical imagery, many of them meditations on the meaning of particular passages. For example, after the battle of Preston, study of Psalms 17 and 105 led him to tell Parliament that &quot;they that are implacable and will not leave troubling the land may be speedily destroyed out of the land&quot;. A letter to Oliver St John in September 1648 urged him to read Isaiah 8, in which the kingdom falls and only the godly survive. On four occasions in letters in 1648 he referred to the story of Gideon&#x27;s defeat of the Midianites at Ain Harod. These letters suggest that it was Cromwell&#x27;s faith, rather than a commitment to radical politics, coupled with Parliament&#x27;s decision to engage in negotiations with the King at the Treaty of Newport, that convinced him that God had spoken against both the King and Parliament as lawful authorities. For Cromwell, the army was now God&#x27;s chosen instrument. The episode shows Cromwell&#x27;s firm belief in Providentialism—that God was actively directing the affairs of the world, through the actions of &quot;chosen people&quot; (whom God had &quot;provided&quot; for such purposes). During the Civil Wars, Cromwell believed that he was one of these people, and he interpreted victories as indications of God&#x27;s approval and defeats as signs that God was pointing him in another direction.

In December 1648, in an episode that became known as Pride&#x27;s Purge, a troop of soldiers headed by Colonel Thomas Pride forcibly removed from the Long Parliament all those who were not supporters of the Grandees in the New Model Army and the Independents. Thus weakened, the remaining body of MPs, known as the Rump Parliament, agreed that Charles should be tried for treason. Cromwell was still in the north of England, dealing with Royalist resistance, when these events took place, but then returned to London. On the day after Pride&#x27;s Purge, he became a determined supporter of those pushing for the King&#x27;s trial and execution, believing that killing Charles was the only way to end the civil wars. Cromwell approved Thomas Brook&#x27;s address to the House of Commons, which justified the trial and the King&#x27;s execution on the basis of the Book of Numbers, chapter 35 and particularly verse 33 (&quot;The land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.&quot;).

Charles&#x27;s death warrant was signed by 59 of the trying court&#x27;s members, including Cromwell (the third to sign it). Though it was not unprecedented, execution of the King, or regicide, was controversial, if for no other reason than the doctrine of the divine right of kings. Thus, even after a trial, it was difficult to get ordinary men to go along with it: &quot;None of the officers charged with supervising the execution wanted to sign the order for the actual beheading, so they brought their dispute to Cromwell...Oliver seized a pen and scribbled out the order, and handed the pen to the second officer, Colonel Hacker who stooped to sign it. The execution could now proceed.&quot; Although Fairfax conspicuously refused to sign, Charles I was executed on 30 January 1649.

===Establishment of the Commonwealth: 1649===

After the King&#x27;s execution, a republic was declared, known as the Commonwealth of England. The &quot;Rump Parliament&quot; exercised both executive and legislative powers, with a smaller Council of State also having some executive functions. Cromwell remained a member of the Rump and was appointed a member of the council. In the early months after Charles&#x27;s execution, Cromwell tried but failed to unite the original &quot;Royal Independents&quot; led by St John and Saye and Sele, which had fractured during 1648. Cromwell had been connected to this group since before the outbreak of civil war in 1642 and had been closely associated with them during the 1640s. Only St John was persuaded to retain his seat in Parliament. The Royalists, meanwhile, had regrouped in Ireland, having signed a treaty with the Irish known as Confederate Catholics. In March, the Rump chose Cromwell to command a campaign against them. Preparations for an invasion of Ireland occupied him in the subsequent months. In the latter part of the 1640s, Cromwell came across political dissidence in the New Model Army. The Leveller or Agitator movement was a political movement that emphasised popular sovereignty, extended suffrage, equality before the law, and religious tolerance. These sentiments were expressed in the 1647 manifesto: &quot;Agreement of the People&quot;. Cromwell and the rest of the &quot;Grandees&quot; disagreed with these sentiments in that they gave too much freedom to the people; they believed that the vote should extend only to the landowners. In the Putney Debates of 1647, the two groups debated these topics in hopes of forming a new constitution for England. Rebellions and mutinies followed the debates, and in 1649, the Bishopsgate mutiny resulted in Leveller Robert Lockyer&#x27;s execution by firing squad. The next month, the Banbury mutiny occurred with similar results. Cromwell led the charge in quelling these rebellions. After quelling Leveller mutinies within the English army at Andover and Burford in May, he departed for Ireland from Bristol at the end of July.

===Irish campaign: 1649–50===
Cromwell led a Parliamentary invasion of Ireland from 1649 to 1650. Parliament&#x27;s key opposition was the military threat posed by the alliance of the Irish Confederate Catholics and English royalists (signed in 1649). The Confederate-Royalist alliance was judged to be the biggest single threat facing the Commonwealth. However, the political situation in Ireland in 1649 was extremely fractured: there were also separate forces of Irish Catholics who were opposed to the Royalist alliance, and Protestant Royalist forces that were gradually moving towards Parliament. Cromwell said in a speech to the army Council on 23 March that &quot;I had rather be overthrown by a Cavalierish interest than a Scotch interest; I had rather be overthrown by a Scotch interest than an Irish interest and I think of all this is the most dangerous&quot;.

Cromwell&#x27;s hostility to the Irish was religious as well as political. He was passionately opposed to the Catholic Church, which he saw as denying the primacy of the Bible in favour of papal and clerical authority, and which he blamed for suspected tyranny and persecution of Protestants in continental Europe. Cromwell&#x27;s association of Catholicism with persecution was deepened with the Irish Rebellion of 1641. This rebellion, although intended to be bloodless, was marked by massacres of English and Scottish Protestant settlers by Irish (&quot;Gaels&quot;) and Old English in Ireland, and Highland Scot Catholics in Ireland. These settlers had settled on land seized from former, native Catholic owners to make way for the non-native Protestants. These factors contributed to the brutality of the Cromwell military campaign in Ireland.

Parliament had planned to re-conquer Ireland since 1641 and had already sent an invasion force there in 1647. Cromwell&#x27;s invasion of 1649 was much larger and, with the civil war in England over, could be regularly reinforced and re-supplied. His nine-month military campaign was brief and effective, though it did not end the war in Ireland. Before his invasion, Parliamentarian forces held outposts only in Dublin and Derry. When he departed Ireland, they occupied most of the eastern and northern parts of the country. After he landed at Dublin on 15 August 1649 (itself only recently defended from an Irish and English Royalist attack at the Battle of Rathmines), Cromwell took the fortified port towns of Drogheda and Wexford to secure logistical supply from England. At the Siege of Drogheda in September 1649, his troops killed nearly 3,500 people after the town&#x27;s capture—around 2,700 Royalist soldiers and all the men in the town carrying arms, including some civilians, prisoners and Roman Catholic priests. Cromwell wrote afterwards:

I am persuaded that this is a righteous judgment of God upon these barbarous wretches, who have imbrued their hands in so much innocent blood and that it will tend to prevent the effusion of blood for the future, which are satisfactory grounds for such actions, which otherwise cannot but work remorse and regret.

At the Siege of Wexford in October, another massacre took place under confused circumstances. While Cromwell was apparently trying to negotiate surrender terms, some of his soldiers broke into the town, killed 2,000 Irish troops and up to 1,500 civilians, and burned much of the town.

After taking Drogheda, Cromwell sent a column north to Ulster to secure the north of the country and went on to besiege Waterford, Kilkenny and Clonmel in Ireland&#x27;s south-east. Kilkenny put up a fierce defence but was eventually forced to surrender on terms, as did many other towns like New Ross and Carlow, but Cromwell failed to take Waterford, and at the siege of Clonmel in May 1650 he lost up to 2,000 men in abortive assaults before the town surrendered.

One of Cromwell&#x27;s major victories in Ireland was diplomatic rather than military. With the help of Roger Boyle, 1st Earl of Orrery, he persuaded the Protestant Royalist troops in Cork to change sides and fight with the Parliament. At this point, word reached Cromwell that Charles II (son of Charles I) had landed in Scotland from exile in France and been proclaimed King by the Covenanter regime. Cromwell therefore returned to England from Youghal on 26 May 1650 to counter this threat.

The Parliamentarian conquest of Ireland dragged on for almost three years after Cromwell&#x27;s departure. The campaigns under Cromwell&#x27;s successors Henry Ireton and Edmund Ludlow consisted mostly of long sieges of fortified cities and guerrilla warfare in the countryside, with English troops suffering from attacks by Irish &quot;toráidhe&quot; (guerilla fighters). The last Catholic-held town, Galway, surrendered in April 1652 and the last Irish Catholic troops capitulated in April 1653 in County Cavan.

In the wake of the Commonwealth&#x27;s conquest of the island of Ireland, public practice of Roman Catholicism was banned and Catholic priests were killed when captured. All Catholic-owned lands were confiscated under the Act for the Settlement of Ireland of 1652 and given to Scottish and English settlers, Parliament&#x27;s financial creditors and Parliamentary soldiers. Remaining Catholic landowners were allocated poorer land in the province of Connacht.

===Scottish campaign: 1650–51===
====Scots proclaim Charles II as king====

Cromwell left Ireland in May 1650 and several months later invaded Scotland after the Scots had proclaimed Charles I&#x27;s son Charles II as King. Cromwell was much less hostile to Scottish Presbyterians, some of whom had been his allies in the First English Civil War, than he was to Irish Catholics. He described the Scots as a people &quot;fearing His [God&#x27;s] name, though deceived&quot;. He made a famous appeal to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, urging them to see the error of the royal alliance—&quot;I beseech you, in the bowels of Christ, think it possible you may be mistaken.&quot; The Scots&#x27; reply was robust: &quot;would you have us to be sceptics in our religion?&quot; This decision to negotiate with Charles II led Cromwell to believe that war was necessary.

==== Battle of Dunbar ====
His appeal rejected, Cromwell&#x27;s veteran troops went on to invade Scotland. At first, the campaign went badly, as Cromwell&#x27;s men were short of supplies and held up at fortifications manned by Scottish troops under David Leslie. Sickness began to spread in the ranks. Cromwell was on the brink of evacuating his army by sea from Dunbar. However, on 3 September 1650, unexpectedly, Cromwell smashed the main Scottish army at the Battle of Dunbar, killing 4,000 Scottish soldiers, taking another 10,000 prisoner, and then capturing the Scottish capital of Edinburgh. The victory was of such a magnitude that Cromwell called it &quot;A high act of the Lord&#x27;s Providence to us [and] one of the most signal mercies God hath done for England and His people&quot;.

==== Battle of Worcester ====

The following year, Charles II and his Scottish allies made an attempt to invade England and capture London while Cromwell was engaged in Scotland. Cromwell followed them south and caught them at Worcester on 3 September 1651, and his forces destroyed the last major Scottish Royalist army at the Battle of Worcester. Charles II barely escaped capture and fled to exile in France and the Netherlands, where he remained until 1660.

To fight the battle, Cromwell organised an envelopment followed by a multi-pronged coordinated attack on Worcester, his forces attacking from three directions with two rivers partitioning them. He switched his reserves from one side of the river Severn to the other and then back again. Cromwell&#x27;s success at Worcester relied on a degree of manoeuvre that the English parliamentary armies had not been skilled enough to execute at the start of the war, such as at the Battle of Turnham Green.

In the final stages of the Scottish campaign, Cromwell&#x27;s men under George Monck sacked Dundee, killing up to 1,000 men and 140 women and children. Scotland was ruled from England during the Commonwealth and was kept under military occupation, with a line of fortifications sealing off the Highlands which had provided manpower for Royalist armies in Scotland. The northwest Highlands was the scene of another pro-Royalist uprising in 1653–55, which was put down with deployment of 6,000 English troops there. Presbyterianism was allowed to be practised as before, but the Kirk (the Scottish Church) did not have the backing of the civil courts to impose its rulings, as it had previously.

=== Return to England and dissolution of the Rump Parliament: 1651–53 ===

Cromwell was away on campaign from the middle of 1649 until 1651, and the various factions in Parliament began to fight amongst themselves with the King gone as their &quot;common cause&quot;. Cromwell tried to galvanise the Rump into setting dates for new elections, uniting the three kingdoms under one polity, and to put in place a broad-brush, tolerant national church. However, the Rump vacillated in setting election dates, although it put in place a basic liberty of conscience, but it failed to produce an alternative for tithes or to dismantle other aspects of the existing religious settlement. According to the parliamentarian lawyer Bulstrode Whitelocke, Cromwell began to contemplate taking the Crown for himself around this time, though the evidence for this is retrospective and problematic. Ultimately, he demanded that the Rump establish a caretaker government in April 1653 of 40 members drawn from the Rump and the army, and then abdicate; but the Rump returned to debating its own bill for a new government. Cromwell was so angered by this that he cleared the chamber and dissolved the Parliament by force on 20 April 1653, supported by about 40 musketeers. Several accounts exist of this incident; in one, Cromwell is supposed to have said &quot;you are no Parliament, I say you are no Parliament; I will put an end to your sitting&quot;. At least two accounts agree that he snatched up the ceremonial mace, symbol of Parliament&#x27;s power, and demanded that the &quot;bauble&quot; be taken away. His troops were commanded by Charles Worsley, later one of his Major Generals and one of his most trusted advisors, to whom he entrusted the mace.

=== Establishment of Barebone&#x27;s Parliament: 1653 ===
After the dissolution of the Rump, power passed temporarily to a council that debated what form the constitution should take. They took up the suggestion of Major-General Thomas Harrison for a &quot;sanhedrin&quot; of saints. Although Cromwell did not subscribe to Harrison&#x27;s apocalyptic, Fifth Monarchist beliefs—which saw a sanhedrin as the starting point for Christ&#x27;s rule on earth—he was attracted by the idea of an assembly made up of men chosen for their religious credentials. In his speech during the assembly on 4 July, Cromwell thanked God&#x27;s providence that he believed had brought England to this point and set out their divine mission: &quot;truly God hath called you to this work by, I think, as wonderful providences as ever passed upon the sons of men in so short a time.&quot; The Nominated Assembly, sometimes known as the Parliament of Saints, or more commonly and denigratingly called Barebone&#x27;s Parliament after one of its members, Praise-God Barebone, was tasked with finding a permanent constitutional and religious settlement (Cromwell was invited to be a member but declined). However, the revelation that a considerably larger segment of the membership than had been believed were the radical Fifth Monarchists led to its members voting to dissolve it on 12 December 1653, out of fear of what the radicals might do if they took control of the Assembly.

=== The Protectorate: 1653–58 ===

After Barebone&#x27;s Parliament was dissolved, John Lambert put forward a new constitution known as the Instrument of Government, closely modelled on the Heads of Proposals. This made Cromwell undertake the &quot;chief magistracy and the administration of government&quot;. Later he was sworn as Lord Protector on 16 December, with a ceremony in which he wore plain black clothing, rather than any monarchical regalia. Cromwell also changed his signature to &#x27;Oliver P&#x27;, with the &quot;P&quot; being an abbreviation for &quot;Protector&quot;, and soon others started to address Cromwell as &quot;Your Highness&quot;. As Protector, he had to secure a majority vote in the Council of State. As the Lord Protector he was paid £100,000 a year ().

Although Cromwell stated that &quot;Government by one man and a parliament is fundamental,&quot; he believed that social issues should be prioritised. The social priorities did not include any meaningful attempt to reform the social order. Small-scale reform such as that carried out on the judicial system were outweighed by attempts to restore order to English politics. Tax slightly decreased, and he prioritised peace and ending the First Anglo-Dutch War.

England&#x27;s overseas possessions in this period included Newfoundland, the New England Confederation, the Providence Plantation, the Virginia Colony, the Province of Maryland, and islands in the West Indies. Cromwell soon secured the submission of these and largely left them to their own affairs, intervening only to curb other Puritans who had seized control of Maryland Colony at Severn battle, by his confirming the former Roman Catholic proprietorship and edict of tolerance there. Of all the English dominions, Virginia was the most resentful of Cromwell&#x27;s rule, and Cavalier emigration there mushroomed during the Protectorate.

Cromwell famously stressed the quest to restore order in his speech to the first Protectorate parliament. However, the Parliament was quickly dominated by those pushing for more radical, properly republican reforms. Later, the Parliament initiated radical reform. Rather than opposing Parliament&#x27;s bill, Cromwell dissolved them on 22 January 1655. The First Protectorate Parliament had a property franchise of £200 per annum in real or personal property value set as the minimum value which a male adult was to possess before he was eligible to vote for the representatives from the counties or shires in the House of Commons. The House of Commons representatives from the boroughs were elected by the burgesses or those borough residents who had the right to vote in municipal elections, and by the aldermen and councilors of the boroughs.
Cromwell&#x27;s second objective was reforms on the field of morality and religion. As a Protectorate, he established trials for the future parish ministers, and dismissed unqualified ministers and rectors. These triers and the ejectors were intended to be at the vanguard of Cromwell&#x27;s reform of parish worship. This second objective is also the context in which to see the constitutional experiment of the Major Generals that followed the dissolution of the first Protectorate Parliament. After a Royalist uprising in March 1655, led by Sir John Penruddock, Cromwell (influenced by Lambert) divided England into military districts ruled by army major generals who answered only to him. The 15 major generals and deputy major generals—called &quot;godly governors&quot;—were central not only to national security, but also viewed as Cromwell&#x27;s serious effort in exerting his religious conviction. Their position was further harmed by a tax proposal by Major General John Desborough to provide financial backing for their work, which the second Protectorate parliament—instated in September 1656—voted down for fear of a permanent military state. Ultimately, however, Cromwell&#x27;s failure to support his men, sacrificing them to his opponents, caused their demise. Their activities between November 1655 and September 1656 had, however, reopened the wounds of the 1640s and deepened antipathies to the regime. In late 1654, Cromwell launched the Western Design armada against the Spanish West Indies, and in May 1655 captured Jamaica.

As Lord Protector, Cromwell was aware of the Jewish community&#x27;s involvement in the economics of the Netherlands, now England&#x27;s leading commercial rival. It was this—allied to Cromwell&#x27;s tolerance of the right to private worship of those who fell outside Puritanism—that led to his encouraging Jews to return to England in 1657, over 350 years after their banishment by Edward I, in the hope that they would help speed up the recovery of the country after the disruption of the Civil Wars. There was a longer-term motive for Cromwell&#x27;s decision to allow the Jews to return to England, and that was the hope that they would convert to Christianity and therefore hasten the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, ultimately based on Matthew 23:37–39 and Romans 11. At the Whitehall conference of December 1655, he quoted from St. Paul&#x27;s Epistle to the Romans 10:12–15 on the need to send Christian preachers to the Jews. The Presbyterian William Prynne, in contrast to the Congregationalist Cromwell, was strongly opposed to the latter&#x27;s pro-Jewish policy.

On 23 March 1657, the Protectorate signed the Treaty of Paris with Louis XIV against Spain. Cromwell pledged to supply France with 6,000 troops and war ships. In accordance with the terms of the treaty, Mardyck and Dunkirk—a base for privateers and commerce raiders attacking English merchant shipping—were ceded to England.

In 1657, Cromwell was offered the crown by Parliament as part of a revised constitutional settlement, presenting him with a dilemma since he had been &quot;instrumental&quot; in abolishing the monarchy. Cromwell agonised for six weeks over the offer. He was attracted by the prospect of stability it held out, but in a speech on 13 April 1657 he made clear that God&#x27;s providence had spoken against the office of King: &quot;I would not seek to set up that which Providence hath destroyed and laid in the dust, and I would not build Jericho again&quot;. The reference to Jericho harks back to a previous occasion on which Cromwell had wrestled with his conscience when the news reached England of the defeat of an expedition against the Spanish-held island of Hispaniola in the West Indies in 1655—comparing himself to Achan, who had brought the Israelites defeat after bringing plunder back to camp after the capture of Jericho. Instead, Cromwell was re-installed as Lord Protector on 26 June at Westminster Hall, and sitting on King Edward&#x27;s Chair, he imitated a royal coronation as he wore many royal regalia, such as a purple robe, a sword of justice and a sceptre. Cromwell&#x27;s new rights and powers were laid out in the Humble Petition and Advice, a legislative instrument which replaced the Instrument of Government. Despite failing to restore the Crown, this new constitution did set up many of the vestiges of the ancient constitution including a house of life peers. In the Humble Petition it was called the Other House as the Commons could not agree on a suitable name. Furthermore, Oliver Cromwell increasingly took on more of the trappings of monarchy. In particular, he created three peerages after a Petition and advised Charles Howard to be appointed as Viscount Morpeth and Baron Gisland in July. Meanwhile, Edmund Dunch being appointed as Baron Burnell of East Wittenham in April next year.

=== Death and posthumous execution ===

Cromwell is thought to have suffered from malaria and kidney stone disease. In 1658, he was struck by a sudden bout of malarial fever, and it is thought that he may have rejected the only known treatment, quinine, because it had been discovered by Catholic Jesuit missionaries. This was followed directly by illness symptomatic of a urinary or kidney complaint. The Venetian ambassador wrote regular dispatches to the Doge of Venice in which he included details of Cromwell&#x27;s final illness, and he was suspicious of the rapidity of his death. The decline may have been hastened by the death of his daughter Elizabeth Claypole in August. He died at age 59 at Whitehall on 3 September 1658, the anniversary of his great victories at Dunbar and Worcester. The night of his death, a great storm swept England and all over Europe. The most likely cause of death was sepsis (blood poisoning) following his urinary infection. He was buried with great ceremony, at what is now the RAF Chapel, with an elaborate funeral at Westminster Abbey based on that of James I, his daughter Elizabeth also being buried there.

Cromwell was succeeded as Lord Protector by his son Richard. As Richard had no power base in Parliament or the Army, he was forced to resign in May 1659, ending the Protectorate. There was no clear leadership from the various factions that jostled for power during the reinstated Commonwealth, so George Monck was able to march on London at the head of New Model Army regiments and restore the Long Parliament. Under Monck&#x27;s watchful eye, the necessary constitutional adjustments were made so that Charles II could be invited back from exile in 1660 to be king under a restored monarchy.

Cromwell&#x27;s body was exhumed from Westminster Abbey on 30 January 1661, the 12th anniversary of the execution of Charles I, and was subjected to a posthumous execution, as were the remains of John Bradshaw and Henry Ireton (the body of Cromwell&#x27;s daughter was allowed to remain buried in the abbey). His body was hanged in chains at Tyburn, London, and then thrown into a pit. His head was cut off and displayed on the roof of Westminster Hall at the Palace of Westminster until at least 1684. Afterwards, it was owned by various people, including a documented sale in 1814 to Josiah Henry Wilkinson, and it was publicly exhibited several times before being buried beneath the floor of the antechapel at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, in 1960. The exact position was not publicly disclosed, but a plaque marks the approximate location.

Many people began to question whether the body mutilated at Tyburn and the head seen on Westminster Hall were Cromwell&#x27;s. These doubts arose because it was assumed that Cromwell&#x27;s body was reburied in several places between his death in September 1658 and the exhumation of January 1661, in order to protect it from vengeful royalists. The stories suggest that his bodily remains are buried in London, Cambridgeshire, Northamptonshire, or Yorkshire.

The Cromwell vault was later used as a burial place for Charles II&#x27;s illegitimate descendants. In Westminster Abbey, the site of Cromwell&#x27;s burial was marked during the 19th century by a floor stone in what is now the RAF Chapel reading: &quot;The burial place of Oliver Cromwell 1658–1661&quot;.

== Character assessment ==

During his lifetime, some tracts painted Cromwell as a hypocrite motivated by power. For example, &quot;The Machiavilian Cromwell&quot; and &quot;The Juglers Discovered&quot; are parts of an attack on Cromwell by the Levellers after 1647, and both present him as a Machiavellian figure. John Spittlehouse presented a more positive assessment in &quot;A Warning Piece Discharged&quot;, comparing him to Moses rescuing the English by taking them safely through the Red Sea of the civil wars. Poet John Milton called Cromwell &quot;our chief of men&quot; in his &quot;Sonnet XVI&quot;.

Several biographies were published soon after Cromwell&#x27;s death. An example is &quot;The Perfect Politician&quot;, which describes how Cromwell &quot;loved men more than books&quot; and provides a nuanced assessment of him as an energetic campaigner for liberty of conscience who is brought down by pride and ambition. An equally nuanced but less positive assessment was published in 1667 by Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon in his &quot;History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England&quot;. Clarendon famously declares that Cromwell &quot;will be looked upon by posterity as a brave bad man&quot;. He argues that Cromwell&#x27;s rise to power had been helped by his great spirit and energy, but also by his ruthlessness. Clarendon was not one of Cromwell&#x27;s confidantes, and his account was written after the Restoration of the monarchy.

During the early 18th century, Cromwell&#x27;s image began to be adopted and reshaped by the Whigs as part of a wider project to give their political objectives historical legitimacy. John Toland rewrote Edmund Ludlow&#x27;s &quot;Memoirs&quot; in order to remove the Puritan elements and replace them with a Whiggish brand of republicanism, and it presents the Cromwellian Protectorate as a military tyranny. Through Ludlow, Toland portrayed Cromwell as a despot who crushed the beginnings of democratic rule in the 1640s.

During the early 19th century, Cromwell began to be portrayed in a positive light by Romantic artists and poets. Thomas Carlyle continued this reassessment in the 1840s, publishing &quot;Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s Letters and Speeches: With Elucidations&quot;, an annotated collection of his letters and speeches in which he described English Puritanism as &quot;the last of all our Heroisms&quot; while taking a negative view of his own era. By the late 19th century, Carlyle&#x27;s portrayal of Cromwell had become assimilated into Whig and Liberal historiography, stressing the centrality of puritan morality and earnestness. Oxford civil war historian Samuel Rawson Gardiner concluded that &quot;the man—it is ever so with the noblest—was greater than his work&quot;. Gardiner stressed Cromwell&#x27;s dynamic and mercurial character, and his role in dismantling absolute monarchy, rather than his religious conviction. Cromwell&#x27;s foreign policy also provided an attractive forerunner of Victorian imperial expansion, with Gardiner stressing his &quot;constancy of effort to make England great by land and sea&quot;. Calvin Coolidge described Cromwell as a brilliant statesman who &quot;dared to oppose the tyranny of the kings&quot;.

During the first half of the 20th century, Cromwell&#x27;s reputation was often influenced by the rise of fascism in Nazi Germany and in Italy. Harvard historian Wilbur Cortez Abbott, for example, devoted much of his career to compiling and editing a multi-volume collection of Cromwell&#x27;s letters and speeches, published between 1937 and 1947. Abbott argues that Cromwell was a proto-fascist. However, subsequent historians such as John Morrill have criticised both Abbott&#x27;s interpretation of Cromwell and his editorial approach.

Late 20th-century historians re-examined the nature of Cromwell&#x27;s faith and of his authoritarian regime. Austin Woolrych explored the issue of &quot;dictatorship&quot; in depth, arguing that Cromwell was subject to two conflicting forces: his obligation to the army and his desire to achieve a lasting settlement by winning back the confidence of the nation as a whole. He argued that the dictatorial elements of Cromwell&#x27;s rule stemmed less from its military origin or the participation of army officers in civil government than from his constant commitment to the interest of the people of God and his conviction that suppressing vice and encouraging virtue constituted the chief end of government. Historians such as John Morrill, Blair Worden, and J. C. Davis have developed this theme, revealing the extent to which Cromwell&#x27;s writing and speeches are suffused with biblical references, and arguing that his radical actions were driven by his zeal for godly reformation.

=== Irish campaign controversy ===

The extent of Cromwell&#x27;s brutality in Ireland has been strongly debated. Some historians argue that Cromwell never accepted responsibility for the killing of civilians in Ireland, claiming that he had acted harshly but only against those &quot;in arms&quot;. Other historians cite Cromwell&#x27;s contemporary reports to London, including that of 27 September 1649, in which he lists the slaying of 3,000 military personnel, followed by the phrase &quot;and many inhabitants&quot;. In September 1649, he justified his sacking of Drogheda as revenge for the massacres of Protestant settlers in Ulster in 1641, calling the massacre &quot;the righteous judgement of God on these barbarous wretches, who have imbrued their hands with so much innocent blood&quot;. But the rebels had not held Drogheda in 1641; many of its garrison were in fact English royalists. On the other hand, the worst atrocities committed in Ireland, such as mass evictions, killings and deportation of over 50,000 men, women and children as prisoners of war and indentured servants to Bermuda and Barbados, were carried out under the command of other generals after Cromwell had left for England. Some point to his actions on entering Ireland. Cromwell demanded that no supplies be seized from civilian inhabitants and that everything be fairly purchased; &quot;I do hereby warn ... all Officers, Soldiers and others under my command not to do any wrong or violence toward Country People or any persons whatsoever, unless they be actually in arms or office with the enemy ... as they shall answer to the contrary at their utmost peril.&quot;

The massacres at Drogheda and Wexford were in some ways typical of the day, especially in the context of the recently ended Thirty Years&#x27; War, although there are few comparable incidents during the Civil Wars in England or Scotland, which were fought mainly between Protestant adversaries, albeit of differing denominations. One possible comparison is Cromwell&#x27;s Siege of Basing House in 1645—the seat of the prominent Catholic the Marquess of Winchester—which resulted in about 100 of the garrison of 400 being killed after being refused quarter. Contemporaries also reported civilian casualties, six Catholic priests and a woman. The scale of the deaths at Basing House was much smaller. Cromwell himself said of the slaughter at Drogheda in his first letter back to the Council of State: &quot;I believe we put to the sword the whole number of the defendants. I do not think thirty of the whole number escaped with their lives.&quot; Cromwell&#x27;s orders—&quot;in the heat of the action, I forbade them to spare any that were in arms in the town&quot;—followed a request for surrender at the start of the siege, which was refused. The military protocol of the day was that a town or garrison that rejected the chance to surrender was not entitled to quarter. The refusal of the garrison at Drogheda to do this, even after the walls had been breached, was to Cromwell justification for the massacre. Where Cromwell negotiated the surrender of fortified towns, as at Carlow, New Ross, and Clonmel, some historians argue that he respected the terms of surrender and protected the townspeople&#x27;s lives and property. At Wexford, he again began negotiations for surrender. The captain of Wexford Castle surrendered during the negotiations and, in the confusion, some of Cromwell&#x27;s troops began indiscriminate killing and looting.

Although Cromwell&#x27;s time spent on campaign in Ireland was limited and he did not take on executive powers until 1653, he is often the central focus of wider debates about whether, as historians such as Mark Levene and John Morrill suggest, the Commonwealth conducted a deliberate programme of ethnic cleansing in Ireland. Faced with the prospect of an Irish alliance with Charles II, Cromwell carried out a series of massacres to subdue the Irish. Then, once Cromwell had returned to England, the English Commissary, General Henry Ireton, Cromwell&#x27;s son-in-law and key adviser, adopted a deliberate policy of crop burning and starvation. Total excess deaths for the entire period of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms in Ireland was estimated by Sir William Petty, the 17th-century economist, to be 600,000 out of a total Irish population of 1,400,000 in 1641.

The sieges of Drogheda and Wexford have been prominently mentioned in histories and literature up to the present day. James Joyce, for example, mentioned Drogheda in his novel &quot;Ulysses&quot;: &quot;What about sanctimonious Cromwell and his ironsides that put the women and children of Drogheda to the sword with the Bible text &#x27;God is love&#x27; pasted round the mouth of his cannon?&quot; Similarly, Winston Churchill (writing in 1957) described Cromwell&#x27;s impact on Anglo-Irish relations:

upon all of these Cromwell&#x27;s record was a lasting bane. By an uncompleted process of terror, by an iniquitous land settlement, by the virtual proscription of the Catholic religion, by the bloody deeds already described, he cut new gulfs between the nations and the creeds. &#x27;Hell or Connaught&#x27; were the terms he thrust upon the native inhabitants, and they for their part, across three hundred years, have used as their keenest expression of hatred &#x27;The Curse of Cromwell on you.&#x27; ... Upon all of us there still lies &#x27;the curse of Cromwell&#x27;.

A key surviving statement of Cromwell&#x27;s views on the conquest of Ireland is his &quot;Declaration of the lord lieutenant of Ireland for the undeceiving of deluded and seduced people&quot; of January 1650. In this he was scathing about Catholicism, saying, &quot;I shall not, where I have the power... suffer the exercise of the Mass.&quot; But he also wrote: &quot;as for the people, what thoughts they have in the matter of religion in their own breasts I cannot reach; but I shall think it my duty, if they walk honestly and peaceably, not to cause them in the least to suffer for the same.&quot; Private soldiers who surrendered their arms &quot;and shall live peaceably and honestly at their several homes, they shall be permitted so to do&quot;.

In 1965 the Irish minister for lands stated that his policies were necessary to &quot;undo the work of Cromwell&quot;; circa 1997, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern demanded that a portrait of Cromwell be removed from a room in the Foreign Office before he began a meeting with Robin Cook.

===Military assessment===

Cromwell has been credited for the formation of the New Model Army. As a member of Parliament, he contributed significantly to the reforms contained in the Self-Denying Ordinance, passed by Parliament in early 1645. The ordinance was enacted partly in response to the failure to capitalise on victory at Marston Moor. It decreed that the army be &quot;remodeled&quot; on a national basis, replacing the old county associations. It also forced members of the House of Commons and the Lords, such as Manchester, to choose between civil office and military command. All of them except Cromwell chose to renounce their military positions. In contrast, Cromwell&#x27;s commission was given continued extensions and he was allowed to remain in Parliament.

In April 1645 the New Model Army finally took to the field, with Sir Thomas Fairfax in command and Cromwell as Lieutenant-General of cavalry and second-in-command. Some authorities maintain that the army&#x27;s organisation and the thorough training of its men were accomplished by Fairfax, not Cromwell. In contrast to Fairfax, Cromwell had no formal training in military tactics. However, he is generally accepted to have been a capable military leader, particularly as a battlefield commander. 

In recruiting, he sought loyal and well-behaved men regardless of their religion or social status. He required good treatment and reliable pay for his soldiers, but also enforced strict discipline.

As a battlefield commander, Cromwell followed the common practice of ranging his cavalry in three ranks and pressing forward, relying on impact rather than firepower. His strengths were an instinctive ability to lead and train his men, and his moral authority. In a war fought mostly by amateurs, these strengths were significant and most likely contributed to the discipline of his cavalry. Cromwell introduced close-order cavalry formations, with troopers riding knee to knee; this was an innovation in England at the time and a major factor in his success. He kept his troops close together after skirmishes where they had gained superiority, rather than allowing them to chase opponents off the battlefield. This facilitated further engagements in short order, which allowed greater intensity and quick reaction to battle developments. This style of command was decisive at both Marston Moor and Naseby.

Alan Marshall was critical for Cromwell&#x27;s approach to warfare i.e. the &quot;War of annihilation&quot; style which usually brought swift victory but also contained high risk. Marshall notes Cromwell&#x27;s shortcomings in Ireland, highlighting his defeat at Clonmel and condemning his act at Drogheda as &quot;an appalling atrocity, even by seventeenth-century standards&quot;. Marshall and other historians saw Cromwell as less proficient in the field of manoeuvre, attrition warfare and at siege warfare. Marshall also argues that Cromwell was not truly revolutionary in his war strategies. Instead, he observes Cromwell as a courageous and energetic commander, with an eye for discipline and logistics. However, Marshall also suggests that Cromwell&#x27;s military proficiency had improved significantly by 1644–45—and that he operated efficiently during the operations of those years. Marshall also points out that Cromwell&#x27;s political career was shapen by his military career advance.

Cromwell&#x27;s conquest left no significant legacy of bitterness in Scotland. The rule of the Commonwealth and Protectorate was largely peaceful, apart from the Highlands. Moreover, there were no wholesale confiscations of land or property. Three out of every four Justices of the Peace in Commonwealth Scotland were Scots and the country was governed jointly by the English military authorities and a Scottish Council of State.

==Monuments and posthumous honours==

During the opening of the American Revolutionary War in 1776, the Connecticut State Navy commissioned a corvette named the &quot;Oliver Cromwell&quot;, one of the first American naval vessels. It was captured in battle in 1779 and renamed HMS &quot;Restoration&quot; before being commissioned as HMS &quot;Loyalist&quot;. 

19th-century engineer Sir Richard Tangye was a noted Cromwell enthusiast and collector of Cromwell manuscripts and memorabilia. His collection included many rare manuscripts and printed books, medals, paintings, objets d&#x27;art, and a bizarre assemblage of &quot;relics&quot;. This includes Cromwell&#x27;s Bible, button, coffin plate, death mask, and funeral escutcheon. On Tangye&#x27;s death, the entire collection was donated to the Museum of London, where it can still be seen.

In 1875, a statue of Cromwell by Matthew Noble was erected in Manchester outside the Manchester Cathedral, a gift to the city by Abel Heywood in memory of her first husband. It was the first large-scale statue to be erected in the open in England, and was a realistic likeness based on the painting by Peter Lely; it showed Cromwell in battledress with drawn sword and leather body armour. It was unpopular with local Conservatives and the large Irish immigrant population. Queen Victoria was invited to open the new Manchester Town Hall, and she allegedly consented on the condition that the statue be removed. The statue remained, Victoria declined, and the town hall was opened by the Lord Mayor. During the 1980s, the statue was relocated outside Wythenshawe Hall, which had been occupied by Cromwell&#x27;s troops.
During the 1890s, Parliamentary plans to erect a statue of Cromwell outside Parliament turned controversial. Pressure from the Irish Nationalist Party forced the withdrawal of a motion to seek public funding for the project; the statue was eventually erected, but it had to be funded privately by Lord Rosebery.

Cromwell controversy continued into the 20th century. Winston Churchill was First Lord of the Admiralty before World War I, and he twice suggested naming a British battleship HMS &quot;Oliver Cromwell&quot;. The suggestion was vetoed by King George V because of his personal feelings and because he felt that it was unwise to give such a name to an expensive warship at a time of Irish political unrest, especially given the anger caused by the statue outside Parliament. Churchill was eventually told by First Sea Lord Admiral Battenberg that the King&#x27;s decision must be treated as final. The Cromwell tank was a British medium-weight tank first used in 1944, and a steam locomotive built by British Railways in 1951 was named &quot;Oliver Cromwell&quot;.

Other public statues of Cromwell are the Statue of Oliver Cromwell, St Ives in Cambridgeshire and the Statue of Oliver Cromwell, Warrington in Cheshire. An oval plaque at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, refers to the end of the travels of his head and reads:

&lt;poem style=&quot;margin:0.3em auto; text-align:center;&quot;&gt;

<doc id="22416" wikidata="Q8442" url="?curid=22416" title="Otto von Bismarck">
<text>Otto, Prince of Bismarck, Count of Bismarck-Schönhausen, Duke of Lauenburg (; born &quot;Otto Eduard Leopold von Bismarck&quot;; 1 April 1815 – 30 July 1898) was a German statesman and diplomat who oversaw the unification of Germany. Bismarck&#x27;s &quot;Realpolitik&quot; and firm governance resulted in him being popularly known as the Iron Chancellor ().

From Junker landowner origins, Otto von Bismarck rose rapidly in Prussian politics under King Wilhelm I of Prussia. He served as the Prussian ambassador to Russia and France and in both houses of the Prussian parliament. From 1862 to 1890, he held office as the minister president and foreign minister of Prussia. Under Bismarck&#x27;s leadership, Prussia provoked three short, decisive wars against Denmark, Austria, and France. After Austria&#x27;s defeat in 1866, he replaced the German Confederation with the North German Confederation, which aligned the smaller North German states with Prussia while excluding Austria. In 1870, Bismarck secured France&#x27;s defeat with support from the independent South German states before overseeing the creation of a unified German Empire under Prussian rule. Following Germany&#x27;s unification, he was given the aristocratic title, Prince of Bismarck (). From 1871 onwards, his balance-of-power approach to diplomacy helped maintain Germany&#x27;s position in a peaceful Europe. While averse to maritime colonialism, Bismarck ultimately acquiesced to elite and popular opinion by building an overseas empire.

Throughout his career as Chancellor, Prince Bismarck remained loyal to German Emperor Wilhelm I who steadfastly supported his policies against the advice of his wife, Empress Augusta, and son, Crown Prince Frederick. As the architect of Germany&#x27;s domestic policies, Bismarck created the first modern welfare state, which also had the effect of undermining his socialist opponents. In the 1870s, he allied himself with the anti-tariff, anti-Catholic Liberals while repressing the Catholic Church in the &quot;Kulturkampf&quot; (&quot;culture struggle&quot;). Additionally, under his governance, the Imperial Reichstag was elected by universal male suffrage but did not control government policy. A staunch monarchist, Bismarck inherently distrusted democracy and ruled through a strong, well-trained bureaucracy with power concentrated in the hands of the Junker elite. After being dismissed from office by Wilhelm II, he retired to write his memoirs.

Otto von Bismarck is most famous for his role in German unification. He became a hero to German nationalists, who built monuments honouring him. While praised as a visionary who kept the peace in Europe through adroit diplomacy, he is criticised for his persecution of Poles and Catholics as well as the immense power centralised within his office as Chancellor. He is also criticised by opponents of German nationalism, as it became engrained in German culture, galvanising the country to aggressively pursue nationalistic policies in both World Wars.

==Early years==
Bismarck was born in 1815 at Schönhausen, a noble family estate west of Berlin in Prussian Saxony. His father, Karl Wilhelm Ferdinand von Bismarck (1771–1845), was a Swabian-descendant Junker estate owner and a former Prussian military officer; his mother, Wilhelmine Luise Mencken (1789–1839), was the well-educated daughter of a senior government official in Berlin whose family produced many civil servants along with academics. In 1816, the family moved to its Pomeranian estate, Kniephof (now Konarzewo, Poland), northeast of Stettin (now Szczecin), in the then-Prussian province of Farther Pomerania. There, Bismarck spent his childhood in a bucolic setting. Despite the assets they held, their financial affairs were average; Ferdinand&#x27;s below adequate agricultural skills led to a decreased salary, with Bismarck having never obtained any significant wealth before &quot;die Einigung&quot;, given the lack of such received from his father.

Bismarck had two siblings: his older brother Bernhard (1810–1893) and his younger sister Malwine (1827–1908). Others saw Bismarck as a typical backwoods Prussian Junker, an image that he encouraged by wearing military uniforms. However, he was well educated and cosmopolitan with a gift for conversation. Bismarck also knew English, French, Italian, Polish, and Russian.

Bismarck was educated at Johann Ernst Plamann&#x27;s elementary school, and the Friedrich-Wilhelm and Graues Kloster secondary schools. From 1832 to 1833, he studied law at the University of Göttingen, where he was a member of the Corps Hannovera, and then enrolled at the University of Berlin (1833–1835). In 1838, while stationed as an army reservist in Greifswald, he studied agriculture at the University of Greifswald. At Göttingen, Bismarck befriended the American student John Lothrop Motley. Motley, who later became an eminent historian and diplomat while remaining close to Bismarck, wrote a novel in 1839, &quot;Morton&#x27;s Hope, or the Memoirs of a Provincial&quot;, about life in a German university. In it he described Bismarck as a reckless and dashing eccentric, but also as an extremely gifted and charming young man.

Although Bismarck hoped to become a diplomat, he started his practical training as a lawyer in Aachen and Potsdam, and soon resigned, having first placed his career in jeopardy by taking unauthorised leave to pursue two English girls: first Laura Russell, niece of the Duke of Cleveland, and then Isabella Loraine-Smith, daughter of a wealthy clergyman. In 1838, Bismarck began a shortened compulsory military service in the Prussian Army; actively serving as a one-year volunteer before becoming an officer in the Landwehr (reserve). Afterwards he returned to run the family estates at Schönhausen on his mother&#x27;s death in his mid-twenties.

Around age 30, Bismarck formed an intense friendship with Marie von Thadden-Trieglaff, newly married to one of his friends, Moritz von Blanckenburg. A month after her death, Bismarck wrote to ask for the hand in marriage of Marie&#x27;s cousin, the noblewoman Johanna von Puttkamer (1824–1894); they were married at Alt-Kolziglow (modern Kołczygłowy) on 28 July 1847. Their long and happy marriage produced three children: Marie (b. 1847), Herbert (b. 1849), and Wilhelm (b. 1852). Johanna was a shy, retiring and deeply religious woman, although famed for her sharp tongue in later life.

==Early political career==
===Young politician===
In 1847, Bismarck, aged thirty-two, was chosen as a representative to the newly created Prussian legislature, the &quot;Vereinigter Landtag&quot;. There, he gained a reputation as a royalist and reactionary politician with a gift for stinging rhetoric; he openly advocated the idea that the monarch had a divine right to rule. His selection was arranged by the Gerlach brothers, fellow Pietist Lutherans whose ultra-conservative faction was known as the &quot;Kreuzzeitung&quot; after their newspaper, the &quot;Neue Preußische Zeitung&quot;, which was so nicknamed because it featured an Iron Cross on its cover.

In March 1848, Prussia faced a revolution (one of the revolutions of 1848 across Europe), which completely overwhelmed King Frederick William IV. The monarch, though initially inclined to use armed forces to suppress the rebellion, ultimately declined to leave Berlin for the safety of military headquarters at Potsdam. Bismarck later recorded that there had been a &quot;rattling of sabres in their scabbards&quot; from Prussian officers when they learned that the king would not suppress the revolution by force. He offered numerous concessions to the liberals: he wore the black-red-gold revolutionary colours (as seen on the flag of today&#x27;s Germany), promised to promulgate a constitution, agreed that Prussia and other German states should merge into a single nation-state, and appointed a liberal, Gottfried Ludolf Camphausen, as Minister President.

Bismarck had at first tried to rouse the peasants of his estate into an army to march on Berlin in the king&#x27;s name. He travelled to Berlin in disguise to offer his services but was instead told to make himself useful by arranging food supplies for the Army from his estates in case they were needed. The king&#x27;s brother, Prince Wilhelm, had fled to England; Bismarck tried to get Wilhelm&#x27;s wife Augusta to place their teenage son Frederick William on the Prussian throne in Frederick William IV&#x27;s place. Augusta would have none of it, and detested Bismarck thereafter, despite the fact that he later helped restore a working relationship between Wilhelm and his brother the king. Bismarck was not yet a member of the House of Representatives, the lower house of the new Prussian legislature. The liberal movement perished by the end of 1848 amid internal fighting. Meanwhile, the conservatives regrouped, formed an inner group of advisers—including the Gerlach brothers, known as the &quot;Camarilla&quot;—around the king, and retook control of Berlin. Although a constitution was granted, its provisions fell far short of the demands of the revolutionaries.

In 1849, Bismarck was elected to the &quot;Landtag&quot;. At this stage in his career, he opposed the unification of Germany, arguing that Prussia would lose its independence in the process. He accepted his appointment as one of Prussia&#x27;s representatives at the Erfurt Parliament, an assembly of German states that met to discuss plans for union, but he only did so to oppose that body&#x27;s proposals more effectively. The parliament failed to bring about unification, for it lacked the support of the two most important German states, Prussia and Austria. In September 1850, after a dispute over the Electorate of Hesse (the Hesse Crisis of 1850), Prussia was humiliated and forced to back down by Austria (supported by Russia) in the so-called Punctation of Olmütz; a plan for the unification of Germany under Prussian leadership, proposed by Prussia&#x27;s Foreign Minister Joseph von Radowitz, was also abandoned.

In 1851, Frederick William IV appointed Bismarck as Prussia&#x27;s envoy to the Diet of the German Confederation in Frankfurt. Bismarck gave up his elected seat in the &quot;Landtag&quot; but was appointed to the Prussian House of Lords a few years later. In Frankfurt, he engaged in a battle of wills with the Austrian representative Count Friedrich von Thun und Hohenstein. He insisted on being treated as an equal by petty tactics such as imitating Thun when Thun claimed the privileges of smoking and removing his jacket in meetings. This episode was the background for an altercation in the Frankfurt chamber with Georg von Vincke that led to a duel between Bismarck and Vincke with Carl von Bodelschwingh as an impartial party, which ended without injury.

Bismarck&#x27;s eight years in Frankfurt were marked by changes in his political opinions, detailed in the numerous lengthy memoranda, which he sent to his ministerial superiors in Berlin. No longer under the influence of his ultraconservative Prussian friends, Bismarck became less reactionary and more pragmatic. He became convinced that to countervail Austria&#x27;s newly restored influence, Prussia would have to ally herself with other German states. As a result, he grew to be more accepting of the notion of a united German nation. He gradually came to believe that he and his fellow conservatives had to take the lead in creating a unified nation to keep from being eclipsed. He also believed that the middle-class liberals wanted a unified Germany more than they wanted to break the grip of the traditional forces over society.

Bismarck also worked to maintain the friendship of Russia and a working relationship with Napoleon III&#x27;s France, the latter being anathema to his conservative friends, the Gerlachs, but necessary both to threaten Austria and to prevent France from allying with Russia. In a famous letter to Leopold von Gerlach, Bismarck wrote that it was foolish to play chess having first put 16 of the 64 squares out of bounds. This observation became ironic, as after 1871, France indeed became Germany&#x27;s permanent enemy, and eventually allied with Russia against Germany in the 1890s.

Bismarck was alarmed by Prussia&#x27;s isolation during the Crimean War of the mid-1850s, in which Austria sided with Britain and France against Russia; Prussia was almost not invited to the peace talks in Paris, where Russia notably regained access to the Black Sea, much to his chagrin. In the Great Eastern Crisis of the 1870s, fear of a repetition of this turn of events would later be a factor in Bismarck&#x27;s signing the Dual Alliance with Austria-Hungary in 1879.

===Ambassador to Russia and France===
In October 1857, Frederick William IV suffered a paralysing stroke, and his brother Wilhelm took over the Prussian government as Regent. Wilhelm was initially seen as a moderate ruler, whose friendship with liberal Britain was symbolised by the recent marriage of his son Frederick William to Queen Victoria&#x27;s eldest daughter. As part of his &quot;New Era&quot;, Wilhelm brought in new ministers, moderate conservatives known as the &quot;Wochenblatt&quot; after their newspaper.

The Regent soon replaced Bismarck as envoy in Frankfurt and made him Prussia&#x27;s ambassador to the Russian Empire. In theory, this was a promotion, as Russia was one of Prussia&#x27;s two most powerful neighbours. But Bismarck was sidelined from events in Germany and could only watch impotently as France drove Austria out of Lombardy during the Italian War of 1859. Bismarck proposed that Prussia should exploit Austria&#x27;s weakness to move her frontiers &quot;as far south as Lake Constance&quot; on the Swiss border; instead, Prussia mobilised troops in the Rhineland to deter further French advances into Venetia.

Bismarck stayed in St Petersburg for four years, during which he almost lost his leg to botched medical treatment and once again met his future adversary, the Russian Prince Alexander Gorchakov, who had been the Russian representative in Frankfurt in the early 1850s. The Regent also appointed Helmuth von Moltke as the new Chief of Staff of the Prussian Army, and Albrecht von Roon as Minister of War with the job of reorganising the army. Over the next twelve years, Bismarck, Moltke and Roon transformed Prussia.

Despite his lengthy stay abroad, Bismarck was not entirely detached from German domestic affairs. He remained well-informed due to Roon, with whom Bismarck formed a lasting friendship and political alliance. In May 1862, he was sent to Paris to serve as ambassador to France, and also visited England that summer. These visits enabled him to meet and take the measure of several adversaries: Napoleon III in France, and in Britain, Prime Minister Palmerston, Foreign Secretary Earl Russell, and Conservative politician Benjamin Disraeli.

==Minister President of Prussia==

Prince Wilhelm became King of Prussia upon his brother Frederick Wilhelm IV&#x27;s death in 1861. The new monarch often came into conflict with the increasingly liberal Prussian Landtag. A crisis arose in 1862 when the Landtag refused to authorise funding for a proposed re-organisation of the army. The King&#x27;s ministers could not convince legislators to pass the budget, and the king was unwilling to make concessions. Wilhelm threatened to abdicate in favour of his son Crown Prince Frederick William, who opposed his doing so, believing that Bismarck was the only politician capable of handling the crisis. However, Wilhelm was ambivalent about appointing a person who demanded unfettered control over foreign affairs. It was in September 1862, when the &quot;Abgeordnetenhaus&quot; (House of Representatives) overwhelmingly rejected the proposed budget, that Wilhelm was persuaded to recall Bismarck to Prussia on the advice of Roon. On 23 September 1862, Wilhelm appointed Bismarck Minister President and Foreign Minister.

Bismarck, Roon and Moltke took charge at a time when relations among the Great Powers (Great Britain, France, Austria and Russia) had been shattered by the Crimean War and the First Italian War of Independence. In the midst of this disarray, the European balance of power was restructured with the creation of the German Empire as the dominant power in continental Europe apart from Russia. This was achieved by Bismarck&#x27;s diplomacy, Roon&#x27;s reorganisation of the army and Moltke&#x27;s military strategy.

Despite the initial distrust of the king and crown prince and the loathing of Queen Augusta, Bismarck soon acquired a powerful hold over the king by force of personality and powers of persuasion. Bismarck was intent on maintaining royal supremacy by ending the budget deadlock in the king&#x27;s favour, even if he had to use extra-legal means to do so. Under the constitution, the budget could be passed only after the king and legislature agreed on its terms. Bismarck contended that since the constitution did not provide for cases in which legislators failed to approve a budget, there was a &quot;legal loophole&quot; in the constitution and so he could apply the previous year&#x27;s budget to keep the government running. Thus, on the basis of the 1861 budget, tax collection continued for four years.

Bismarck&#x27;s conflict with the legislators intensified in the coming years. Following the Alvensleben Convention of 1863, the House of Representatives resolved that it could no longer come to terms with Bismarck; in response, the king dissolved the Landtag, accusing it of trying to obtain unconstitutional control over the ministry—which, under the constitution, was responsible solely to the king. Bismarck then issued an edict restricting the freedom of the press, an edict that even gained the public opposition of the crown prince. Despite (or perhaps because of) his attempts to silence critics, Bismarck remained a largely unpopular politician. His supporters fared poorly in the elections of October 1863, in which a liberal coalition, whose primary member was the Progress Party, won over two-thirds of the seats. The House made repeated calls for Bismarck to be dismissed, but the king supported him, fearing that if he did dismiss the Minister President, he would most likely be succeeded by a liberal.

===Blood and Iron speech===
German unification had been a major objective of the revolutions of 1848, when representatives of the German states met in Frankfurt and drafted a constitution, creating a federal union with a national parliament to be elected by universal male suffrage. In April 1849, the Frankfurt Parliament offered the title of Emperor to King Frederick William IV. Fearing the opposition of the other German princes and the military intervention of Austria and Russia, the king renounced this popular mandate, citing his concerns over the legitimacy of the parliament to offer him the crown without the consent of the various German rulers. Thus, the Frankfurt Parliament ended in failure for the German liberals. On 30 September 1862, Bismarck made a famous speech to the Budget Committee of the Prussian Chamber of Deputies in which he expounded on the use of &quot;iron and blood&quot; to achieve Prussia&#x27;s goals:
===Defeat of Denmark===

Prior to the 1860s, Germany consisted of a multitude of principalities loosely bound together as members of the German Confederation. Bismarck used both diplomacy and the Prussian military to achieve unification, excluding Austria from a unified Germany. This made Prussia the most powerful and dominant component of the new Germany but also ensured that it remained an authoritarian state and not a liberal parliamentary democracy.

Bismarck faced a diplomatic crisis when King Frederick VII of Denmark died in November 1863. The succession to the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein was disputed; they were claimed by Christian IX, Frederick VII&#x27;s heir as king, and also by Frederick von Augustenburg, a Danish duke. Prussian public opinion strongly favoured Augustenburg&#x27;s claim, as the populations of Holstein and southern Schleswig were primarily German-speaking. Bismarck took an unpopular step by insisting that the territories legally belonged to the Danish monarch under the London Protocol signed a decade earlier. Nonetheless, Bismarck denounced Christian&#x27;s decision to completely annex Schleswig to Denmark. With support from Austria, he issued an ultimatum for Christian IX to return Schleswig to its former status. When Denmark refused, Austria and Prussia invaded, sparking the Second Schleswig War. Denmark was ultimately forced to renounce its claim on both duchies.

At first this seemed like a victory for Augustenburg, but Bismarck soon removed him from power by making a series of unworkable demands, namely that Prussia should have control over the army and navy of the duchies. Originally, it had been proposed that the Diet of the German Confederation, in which all the states of Germany were represented, should determine the fate of the duchies; but before this scheme could be effected, Bismarck induced Austria to agree to the Gastein Convention. Under this agreement signed on 20 August 1865, Prussia received Schleswig, while Austria received Holstein. In that year Bismarck was given the title of Count (&quot;Graf&quot;) of Bismarck-Schönhausen.

===Defeat of Austria===

In 1866, Austria reneged on the agreement and demanded that the Diet determine the Schleswig–Holstein issue. Bismarck used this as an excuse to start a war with Austria by accusing them of violating the Gastein Convention. Bismarck sent Prussian troops to occupy Holstein. Provoked, Austria called for the aid of other German states, who quickly became involved in the Austro-Prussian War. Thanks to Roon&#x27;s reorganization, the Prussian Army was nearly equal in numbers to the Austrian Army. With the strategic genius of Moltke, the Prussian army fought battles it was able to win. Bismarck had also made a secret alliance with Italy, who desired Austrian-controlled Veneto. Italy&#x27;s entry into the war forced the Austrians to divide their forces.

Meanwhile, as the war began, a German radical named Ferdinand Cohen-Blind attempted to assassinate Bismarck in Berlin, shooting him five times at close range. Bismarck had only minor injuries. Cohen-Blind later committed suicide while in custody.

The war lasted seven weeks. Austria had a seemingly powerful army that was allied with most of the north German and all of the south German states. Nevertheless, Prussia won the decisive Battle of Königgrätz. The king and his generals wanted to push onward, conquer Bohemia and march to Vienna, but Bismarck, worried that Prussian military luck might change or that France might intervene on Austria&#x27;s side, enlisted the help of Crown Prince Frederick Wilhelm, who had opposed the war but had commanded one of the Prussian armies at Königgrätz, to dissuade his father after stormy arguments. Bismarck insisted on a &quot;soft peace&quot; with no annexations and no victory parades, so as to be able to quickly restore friendly relations with Austria.

Prussia had only a plurality (17 out of 43 seats) in the Bundesrat despite being larger than the other 21 states combined, but Bismarck could easily control the proceedings through alliances with the smaller states. This began what historians refer to as &quot;The Misery of Austria&quot; in which Austria served as a mere vassal to the superior Germany, a relationship that was to shape history until the end of the First World War.

Jonathan Steinberg says of Bismarck&#x27;s achievements to this point: The scale of Bismarck&#x27;s triumph cannot be exaggerated. He alone had brought about a complete transformation of the European international order. He had told those who would listen what he intended to do, how he intended to do it, and he did it. He achieved this incredible feat without commanding an army, and without the ability to give an order to the humblest common soldier, without control of a large party, without public support, indeed, in the face of almost universal hostility, without a majority in parliament, without control of his cabinet, and without a loyal following in the bureaucracy. He no longer had the support of the powerful conservative interest groups who had helped him achieve power. The most senior diplomats in the foreign service ... were sworn enemies and he knew it. The Queen and the Royal Family hated him and the King, emotional and unreliable, would soon have his 70th birthday. ... With perfect justice, in August 1866, he punched his fist on his desk and cried &quot;I have beaten them all! All!&quot;

===Franco-Prussian War 1870–1871===

Prussia&#x27;s victory over Austria increased the already existing tensions with France. The Emperor of France, Napoleon III, had tried to gain territory for France (in Belgium and on the left bank of the Rhine) as a compensation for not joining the war against Prussia and was disappointed by the surprisingly quick outcome of the war. Accordingly, opposition politician Adolphe Thiers claimed that it was France, not Austria, who had really been defeated at Königgrätz. Bismarck, at the same time, did not avoid war with France, though he feared the French for a number of reasons. First, he feared that Austria, hungry for revenge, would ally with the French. Similarly, he feared that the Russian army would assist France to maintain a balance of power. Still, however, Bismarck believed that if the German states perceived France as the aggressor, they would then unite behind the King of Prussia. To achieve this, he kept Napoleon III involved in various intrigues, whereby France might gain territory from Luxembourg or Belgium. France never achieved any such gain, but it was made to look greedy and untrustworthy.

A suitable pretext for war arose in 1870 when the German Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen was offered the Spanish throne, vacant since a revolution in 1868. France pressured Leopold into withdrawing his candidacy. Not content with this, Paris demanded that Wilhelm, as head of the House of Hohenzollern, assure that no Hohenzollern would ever seek the Spanish crown again. To provoke France into declaring war with Prussia, Bismarck published the Ems Dispatch, a carefully edited version of a conversation between King Wilhelm and the French ambassador to Prussia, Count Benedetti. This conversation had been edited so that each nation felt that its ambassador had been slighted and ridiculed, thus inflaming popular sentiment on both sides in favour of war. Langer, however, argues that this episode played a minor role in causing the war.

Bismarck wrote in his Memoirs that he &quot;had no doubt that a Franco-German war must take place before the construction of a united Germany could be realised&quot;. Yet he felt confident that the French Army was not prepared to give battle to Germany&#x27;s numerically larger forces: &quot;If the French fight us alone they are lost&quot;. He was also convinced that the French would not be able to find allies since &quot;France, the victor, would be a danger to everybody – Prussia to nobody&quot;. He added, &quot;That is our strong point&quot;.

France mobilized and declared war on 19 July. The German states saw France as the aggressor, and—swept up by nationalism and patriotic zeal—they rallied to Prussia&#x27;s side and provided troops. Both of Bismarck&#x27;s sons served as officers in the Prussian cavalry. The war was a great success for Prussia as the German army, controlled by Chief of Staff Moltke, won victory after victory. The major battles were all fought in one month (7 August to 1 September), and both French armies were captured at Sedan and Metz, the latter after a siege of some weeks. Napoleon III was taken prisoner at Sedan and kept in Germany for a time in case Bismarck had need of him to head the French regime; he later died in exile in England in 1873. The remainder of the war featured a Siege of Paris, the city was &quot;ineffectually bombarded&quot;; the new French republican regime then tried, without success, to relieve Paris with various hastily assembled armies and increasingly bitter partisan warfare.

Bismarck quoted the first verse lyrics of &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;, amongst others, when being recorded on an Edison phonograph in 1889, the only known recording of his voice. A biographer stated that he did so, 19 years after the war, to mock the French.

===Unification of Germany===

Bismarck acted immediately to secure the unification of Germany. He negotiated with representatives of the southern German states, offering special concessions if they agreed to unification. The negotiations succeeded; patriotic sentiment overwhelmed what opposition remained. While the war was in its final phase, Wilhelm I of Prussia was proclaimed German Emperor on 18 January 1871 in the Hall of Mirrors in the Château de Versailles. The new German Empire was a federation: each of its 25 constituent states (kingdoms, grand duchies, duchies, principalities, and free cities) retained some autonomy. The King of Prussia, as German Emperor, was not sovereign over the entirety of Germany; he was only , or first among equals. However, he held the presidency of the Bundesrat, which met to discuss policy presented by the Chancellor, whom the emperor appointed.

In the end, France had to cede Alsace and part of Lorraine, as Moltke and his generals wanted it as a buffer. Historians debate whether Bismarck wanted this annexation or was forced into it by a wave of German public and elite opinion. France was also required to pay an indemnity; the indemnity figure was calculated on the basis of population, as the precise equivalent of the indemnity that Napoleon I had imposed on Prussia in 1807.

Historians debate whether Bismarck had a master plan to expand the North German Confederation of 1866 to include the remaining independent German states into a single entity or simply to expand the power of the Kingdom of Prussia. They conclude that factors in addition to the strength of Bismarck&#x27;s &quot;Realpolitik&quot; led a collection of early modern polities to reorganise political, economic, military, and diplomatic relationships in the 19th century. Reaction to Danish and French nationalism provided foci for expressions of German unity. Military successes—especially those of Prussia—in three regional wars generated enthusiasm and pride that politicians could harness to promote unification. This experience echoed the memory of mutual accomplishment in the Napoleonic Wars, particularly in the War of Liberation of 1813–1814. By establishing a Germany without Austria, the political and administrative unification in 1871 at least temporarily solved the problem of dualism. Historian Robert K. Massie has noted Bismarck&#x27;s popular image was as &quot;gruff&quot; and &quot;militaristic&quot;, while in reality &quot;Bismarck&#x27;s tool was aggressive, ruthless diplomacy.&quot;

Jonathan Steinberg said of Bismarck&#x27;s creation of the German Empire that: the first phase of [his] great career had been concluded. The genius-statesmen had transformed European politics and had unified Germany in eight and a half years. And he had done so by sheer force of personality, by his brilliance, ruthlessness, and flexibility of principle. ... [It] marked the high point of [his] career. He had achieved the impossible, and his genius and the cult of genius had no limits. ... When he returned to Berlin in March 1871, he had become immortal ...

==Chancellor of the German Empire==


In 1871, Bismarck was raised to the rank of &quot;Fürst&quot; (Prince). He was also appointed as the first Imperial Chancellor (&quot;Reichskanzler&quot;) of the German Empire but retained his Prussian offices, including those of Minister-President and Foreign Minister. He was also promoted to the rank of lieutenant-general and bought a former hotel in Friedrichsruh near Hamburg, which became an estate. He also continued to serve as his own foreign minister. Because of both the imperial and the Prussian offices that he held, Bismarck had nearly complete control over domestic and foreign policy. The office of Minister President of Prussia was temporarily separated from that of Chancellor in 1873, when Albrecht von Roon was appointed to the former office. But by the end of the year, Roon resigned due to ill health, and Bismarck again became Minister-President.

===&quot;Kulturkampf&quot;===

Bismarck launched an anti-Catholic &quot;Kulturkampf&quot; (&quot;culture struggle&quot;) in Prussia in 1871. This was partly motivated by Bismarck&#x27;s fear that Pius IX and his successors would use papal infallibility to achieve the &quot;papal desire for international political hegemony... The result was the Kulturkampf, which, with its largely Prussian measures, complemented by similar actions in several other German states, sought to curb the clerical danger by legislation restricting the Catholic church&#x27;s political power.&quot; In May 1872 Bismarck thus attempted to reach an understanding with other European governments to manipulate future Papal conclaves; governments should agree beforehand on unsuitable candidates, and then instruct their national cardinals to vote appropriately. The goal was to end the pope&#x27;s control over the bishops in a given state, but the project went nowhere.

Bismarck accelerated the &quot;Kulturkampf&quot;. In its course, all Prussian bishops and many priests were imprisoned or exiled. Prussia&#x27;s population had greatly expanded in the 1860s and was now one-third Catholic. Bismarck believed that the pope and bishops held too much power over the German Catholics and was further concerned about the emergence of the Catholic Centre Party, organised in 1870. With support from the anticlerical National Liberal Party, which had become Bismarck&#x27;s chief ally in the Reichstag, he abolished the Catholic Department of the Prussian Ministry of Culture. That left the Catholics without a voice in high circles. Moreover, in 1872, the Jesuits were expelled from Germany. In 1873, more anti-Catholic laws allowed the Prussian government to supervise the education of the Roman Catholic clergy and curtailed the disciplinary powers of the Church. In 1875, civil ceremonies were required for civil weddings. Hitherto, weddings in churches were civilly recognised.

&quot;Kulturkampf&quot; became part of Bismarck&#x27;s foreign policy, as he sought to destabilise and weaken Catholic regimes, especially in Belgium and France, but he had little success.

The British ambassador Odo Russell reported to London in October 1872 that Bismarck&#x27;s plans were backfiring by strengthening the ultramontane (pro-papal) position inside German Catholicism: &quot;The German Bishops, who were politically powerless in Germany and theologically in opposition to the Pope in Rome, have now become powerful political leaders in Germany and enthusiastic defenders of the now infallible Faith of Rome, united, disciplined, and thirsting for martyrdom, thanks to Bismarck&#x27;s uncalled for antiliberal declaration of War on the freedom they had hitherto peacefully enjoyed.&quot;

The Catholics reacted by organising themselves and strengthening the Centre Party. Bismarck, a devout pietistic Protestant, was alarmed that secularists and socialists were using the &quot;Kulturkampf&quot; to attack all religions. He abandoned it in 1878 to preserve his remaining political capital since he now needed the Centre Party votes in his new battle against socialism. Pius IX died that year, replaced by the more pragmatic Pope Leo XIII who negotiated away most of the anti-Catholic laws. The Pope kept control of the selection of bishops, and Catholics for the most part supported unification and most of Bismarck&#x27;s policies. However, they never forgot his culture war and preached solidarity to present organised resistance should it ever be resumed.

Steinberg comments: The anti-Catholic hysteria in many European countries belongs in its European setting. Bismarck&#x27;s campaign was not unique in itself, but his violent temper, intolerance of opposition, and paranoia that secret forces had conspired to undermine his life&#x27;s work, made it more relentless. His rage drove him to exaggerate the threat from Catholic activities and to respond with very extreme measures. ... As Odo Russell wrote to his mother, [Lady Emily Russell,] &quot;The demonic is stronger in him than in any man I know.&quot; ... The bully, the dictator, and the &quot;demonic&quot; combined in him with the self-pity and the hypochondria to create a constant crisis of authority, which he exploited for his own ends. ... Opponents, friends, and subordinates all remarked on Bismarck as &quot;demonic&quot;, a kind of uncanny, diabolic personal power over men and affairs. In these years of his greatest power, he believed that he could do anything.

===Economy===
In 1873, Germany and much of Europe and America entered the Long Depression, the &quot;Gründerkrise&quot;. A downturn hit the German economy for the first time since industrial development began to surge in the 1850s. To aid faltering industries, the Chancellor abandoned free trade and established protectionist import-tariffs, which alienated the National Liberals who demanded free trade. The &quot;Kulturkampf&quot; and its effects had also stirred up public opinion against the party that supported it, and Bismarck used this opportunity to distance himself from the National Liberals. That marked a rapid decline in the support of the National Liberals, and by 1879 their close ties with Bismarck had all but ended. Bismarck instead returned to conservative factions, including the Centre Party, for support. He helped foster support from the conservatives by enacting several tariffs protecting German agriculture and industry from foreign competitors in 1879.

===Germanisation===
Imperial and provincial government bureaucracies attempted to Germanise the state&#x27;s national minorities situated near the borders of the empire: the Danes in the North, the Francophones in the West and Poles in the East. As minister president of Prussia and as imperial chancellor, Bismarck &quot;sorted people into their linguistic [and religious] &#x27;tribes&#x27;&quot;; he pursued a policy of hostility in particular toward the Poles, which was an expedient rooted in Prussian history. &quot;He never had a Pole among his peasants&quot; working the Bismarckian estates; it was the educated Polish bourgeoisie and revolutionaries he denounced from personal experience, and &quot;because of &quot;them&quot; he disliked intellectuals in politics.&quot; Bismarck&#x27;s antagonism is revealed in a private letter to his sister in 1861: &quot;Hammer the Poles until they despair of living [...] I have all the sympathy in the world for their situation, but if we want to exist we have no choice but to wipe them out: wolves are only what God made them, but we shoot them all the same when we can get at them.&quot; Later that year, the public Bismarck modified his belligerence and wrote to Prussia&#x27;s foreign minister: &quot;Every success of the Polish national movement is a defeat for Prussia, we cannot carry on the fight against this element according to the rules of civil justice, but only in accordance with the rules of war.&quot;

===Socialism===
Bismarck viewed the growing international socialist movement and the non-violent German Social Democratic Party (SDP), in particular, with alarm. Since the SDP&#x27;s existence was protected by the terms of the German constitution, Bismarck found ways to weaken it, short of an outright ban. In 1878, he instituted the first of a series of repressive Anti-Socialist Laws forbidding socialist organisations and meetings, outlawing trade unions, closing newspapers, and banning the circulation of socialist literature. The SPD continued to take part in the elections, but police officers were now empowered to stop, search, and arrest SDP members and their leaders, numbers of whom were then tried by police courts (one-way socialists used to get around these harsh measures was to run as independent candidates, unaffiliated with any party). Despite, or possibly because of the laws, the SDP steadily gained supporters and seats in the Reichstag.

During the 1880s, Bismarck also tried to win the allegiance of the working classes to the conservative regime by implementing positive social benefits, such as accident and old-age insurance, as well as pioneering a form of socialised medicinereforms which are now grouped under the label State Socialism. Bismarck himself called it that, in addition to referring to them as &quot;practical Christianity&quot;:
The whole problem is rooted in the question: does the state have the responsibility to care for its helpless fellow citizens, or does it not? I maintain that it does have this duty, and to be sure, not simply the Christian state, as I once permitted myself to allude to with the words &quot;practical Christianity&quot;, but rather every state by its very nature. ... There are objectives that only the state in its totality can fulfil. [...] Among the last mentioned objectives [of the state] belong national defence [and] the general system of transportation. [...] To these belong also the help of persons in distress and the prevention of such justified complaints as in fact provide excellent material for exploitation by the Social Democrats. That is the responsibility of the state from which the state will not be able to withdraw in the long run. . Bismarck&#x27;s Reichstag Speech on the Law for Workmen&#x27;s Compensation&quot;, p. 4 (15 March 1884)

Yet, notwithstanding these strategies, Bismarck did not completely succeed in crushing socialism. Support for the SDP increased with each election.

===Foreign policies===
One of the secrets of Bismarck&#x27;s success was his careful in-depth study of the national interest of all the other states. He thereby avoided the pitfall of misunderstandings that led to conflicts. Even more important he identified opportunities whereby the national interest of another state was congruent to that of Germany, and a deal could be achieved to the benefit of both.

Summarizing Bismarck&#x27;s mastery of diplomacy, Jonathan Steinberg argues:
:In international relations, it meant absolutely no emotional commitment to any of the actors. Diplomacy should, he believed, deal with realities, calculations of probabilities, assessing the inevitable missteps and sudden lurches by the other actors, states, and their statesmen. The chessboard could be overseen and it suited Bismarck&#x27;s peculiar genius for politics to maintain in his head multiple possible moves by adversaries...He had his goals in mind and achieved them. He was and remained to the end master of the finely tuned game of diplomacy. He enjoyed it. In foreign affairs he never lost his temper, rarely felt ill or sleepless. He could outsmart and outplay the smartest people in other states.

The powerful Imperial German Army was under the control of Bismarck&#x27;s close ally Field Marshall Helmuth von Moltke the Elder. It was a model of professionalism although it fought no wars. The Imperial German Navy was small under Bismarck.

After fifteen years of warfare in the Crimea, Germany and France, Europe began a period of peace in 1871. With the founding of the German Empire in 1871, Bismarck emerged as a decisive figure in European history from 1871 to 1890. He retained control over Prussia and as well as the foreign and domestic policies of the new German Empire. Bismarck had built his reputation as a war-maker but changed overnight into a peacemaker. In this role, he employed balance of power diplomacy to maintain Germany&#x27;s position in a Europe which, despite many disputes and war scares, remained at peace. For historian Eric Hobsbawm, it was Bismarck who &quot;remained undisputed world champion at the game of multilateral diplomatic chess for almost twenty years after 1871, [and] devoted himself exclusively, and successfully, to maintaining peace between the powers&quot;. Historian Paul Knaplund concludes:
:A net result of the strength and military prestige of Germany combined with situations created or manipulated by her chancellor was that in the eighties Bismarck became the umpire in all serious diplomatic disputes, whether they concerned Europe, Africa, or Asia. Questions such as the boundaries of Balkan states, the treatment of Armenians in the Turkish Empire and of Jews in Rumania, the financial affairs of Egypt, Russian expansion in the Middle East, the war between France and China, and the partition of Africa had to be referred to Berlin; Bismarck held the key to all these problems.

Bismarck&#x27;s main mistake was giving in to the Army and to intense public demand in Germany for the acquisition of the border provinces of Alsace and Lorraine, thereby turning France into a permanent, deeply-committed enemy (&quot;see&quot; French–German enmity). Theodore Zeldin says, &quot;Revenge and the recovery of Alsace-Lorraine became a principal object of French policy for the next forty years. That Germany was France&#x27;s enemy became the basic fact of international relations.&quot; Bismarck&#x27;s solution was to make France a pariah nation, encouraging royalty to ridicule its new republican status, and building complex alliances with the other major powers – Austria-Hungary, Russia, and Britain – to keep France isolated diplomatically. A key element was the League of the Three Emperors, in which Bismarck brought together rulers in Berlin, Vienna and St. Petersburg to guarantee each other&#x27;s security, while blocking out France; it lasted 1881–1887.

====Early relations with Europe====

Having unified his nation, Bismarck now devoted himself to preventing war in Europe with his skills in statesmanship. He was forced to contend with French revanchism, the desire to avenge the losses of the Franco-Prussian War. Bismarck, therefore, engaged in a policy of diplomatically isolating France while maintaining cordial relations with other nations in Europe. He had little interest in naval or colonial entanglements and thus avoided discord with Great Britain. Historians emphasise that he wanted no more territorial gains after 1871, and vigorously worked to form cross-linking alliances that prevented any war in Europe from starting. By 1878 both the Liberal and Conservative spokesmen in Britain hailed him as the champion of peace in Europe. A. J. P. Taylor, a leading British diplomatic historian, concludes that, &quot;Bismarck was an honest broker of peace; and his system of alliances compelled every Power, whatever its will, to follow a peaceful course&quot;.

Well aware that Europe was sceptical of his powerful new Reich, Bismarck turned his attention to preserving the status quo in Europe based on a balance of power that would allow Germany&#x27;s economy to flourish. Bismarck feared that a hostile combination of Austria-Hungary, France, and Russia would crush Germany. If two of them were allied, then the third would ally with Germany only if Germany conceded excessive demands. The solution was to ally with two of the three. In 1873 he formed the League of the Three Emperors (&quot;Dreikaiserbund&quot;), an alliance of Wilhelm, Tsar Alexander II of Russia, and Emperor Francis Joseph of Austria-Hungary. Together they would control Eastern Europe, making sure that restive ethnic groups such as the Poles were kept under control. The Balkans posed a more serious issue, and Bismarck&#x27;s solution was to give Austria-Hungary predominance in the western areas, and Russia in the eastern areas. This system collapsed in 1887.

In 1872, a protracted quarrel began to fester between Bismarck and Count Harry von Arnim, the imperial ambassador to France. Arnim saw himself as a rival and competitor for the chancellorship, but the rivalry escalated out of hand, and Arnim took sensitive records from embassy files in Paris to back up his case. He was formally accused of misappropriating official documents, indicted, tried and convicted, finally fleeing into exile where he died. No one again openly challenged Bismarck in foreign policy matters until his resignation.

====France====

France was Bismarck&#x27;s main problem. Peaceful relations with France became impossible after 1871 when Germany annexed all of the province of Alsace and much of Lorraine. Public opinion demanded it to humiliate France, and the Army wanted its more defensible frontiers. Bismarck reluctantly gave in, the French would never forget or forgive, he calculated, so might as well take the provinces. (That was a mistaken assumption—after about five years the French did calm down and considered it a minor issue.) Germany&#x27;s foreign policy fell into a trap with no exit. &quot;In retrospect it is easy to see that the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine was a tragic mistake.&quot; Once the annexation took place the only policy that made sense was trying to isolate France, so it had no strong allies. However, France complicated Berlin&#x27;s plans when it became friends with Russia. In 1905 a German plan for an alliance with Russia fell through because Russia was too close to France.

Between 1873 and 1877, Germany repeatedly manipulated the internal affairs of France&#x27;s neighbours to hurt France. Bismarck put heavy pressure on Belgium, Spain, and Italy hoping to obtain the election of liberal, anticlerical governments. His plan was to promote republicanism in France by isolating the clerical-monarchist regime of President Patrice de MacMahon. He hoped that surrounding France with liberal states would help the French republicans defeat MacMahon and his reactionary supporters.

The bullying, however, almost got out of hand in mid-1875, when an editorial entitled &quot;Krieg-in-Sicht&quot; (&quot;War in Sight&quot;) was published in a Berlin newspaper close to the government, the &quot;Post&quot;. The editorial indicated that highly influential Germans were alarmed by France&#x27;s rapid recovery from defeat in 1875 and its announcement of an increase in the size of its army, as well as talks of launching a preventive war against France. Bismarck denied knowing about the article ahead of time, but he certainly knew about the talk of preventive war. The editorial produced a war scare, with Britain and Russia warning that they would not tolerate a preventive war against France. Bismarck had no desire for war either, and the crisis soon blew over. It was a rare instance where Bismarck was outmanoeuvred and embarrassed by his opponents, but from that, he learned an important lesson. It forced him to take into account the fear and alarm that his bullying and Germany&#x27;s fast-growing power were causing among its neighbours and reinforced his determination that Germany should work in a proactive fashion to preserve the peace in Europe, rather than passively let events take their own course and reacting to them.

====Italy====
Bismarck maintained good relations with Italy, although he had a personal dislike for Italians and their country. He can be seen as a marginal contributor to Italian unification. Politics surrounding the 1866 Austro-Prussian War allowed Italy to annex Venetia, which had been a &quot;kronland&quot; (&quot;crown land&quot;) of the Austrian Empire since the 1815 Congress of Vienna. In addition, French mobilisation for the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871 made it necessary for Napoleon III to withdraw his troops from Rome and the Papal States. Without these two events, Italian unification would have been a more prolonged process.

====Russia====
After Russia&#x27;s victory over the Ottoman Empire in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, Bismarck helped negotiate a settlement at the Congress of Berlin. The Treaty of Berlin revised the earlier Treaty of San Stefano, reducing the size and sovereignty of the new Principality of Bulgaria (a pro-Russian state at that time). Bismarck and other European leaders opposed the growth of Russian influence and tried to protect the integrity of the Ottoman Empire (see Eastern Question). As a result, Russo-German relations further deteriorated, with the Russian Foreign Minister Gorchakov denouncing Bismarck for compromising his nation&#x27;s victory. The relationship was additionally strained due to Germany&#x27;s protectionist trade policies. Some in the German military clamoured for a preemptive war with Russia; Bismarck refused, stating: &quot;Preemptive war is like committing suicide for fear of death.&quot;

Bismarck realised that both Russia and Britain considered control of central Asia a high priority, dubbed the &quot;Great Game&quot;. Germany had no direct stakes, however, its dominance of Europe was enhanced when Russian troops were based as far away from Germany as possible. Over two decades, 1871–1890, he manoeuvred to help the British, hoping to force the Russians to commit more soldiers to Asia.

====Triple Alliance====
The League of the Three Emperors having fallen apart, Bismarck negotiated the Dual Alliance with Austria-Hungary, in which each guaranteed the other against Russian attack. He also negotiated the Triple Alliance in 1882 with Austria-Hungary and Italy, and Italy and Austria-Hungary soon reached the &quot;Mediterranean Agreement&quot; with Britain. Attempts to reconcile Germany and Russia did not have a lasting effect: the Three Emperors&#x27; League was re-established in 1881 but quickly fell apart, ending Russian-Austrian-Prussian solidarity, which had existed in various forms since 1813. Bismarck therefore negotiated the secret Reinsurance Treaty of 1887 with Russia, in order to prevent the Franco-Russian encirclement of Germany. Both powers promised to remain neutral towards one another unless Russia attacked Austria-Hungary. However, after Bismarck&#x27;s departure from office in 1890, the treaty was not renewed, thus creating a critical problem for Germany in the event of a war.

====Colonies and imperialism====

Bismarck had opposed colonial acquisitions, arguing that the burden of obtaining, maintaining, and defending such possessions would outweigh any potential benefit. He felt that colonies did not pay for themselves, that the German formal bureaucratic system would not work well in the easy-going tropics, and that the diplomatic disputes colonies brought would distract Germany from its central interest, Europe itself. As for French designs on Morocco, Chlodwig, Prince of Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst wrote in his memoirs that Bismarck had told him that Germany &quot;could only be pleased if France took possession of the country&quot; since &quot;she would then be very occupied&quot; and distracted from the loss of Alsace-Lorraine. However, in 1883–1884 he suddenly reversed himself and overnight built a colonial empire in Africa and the South Pacific. The Berlin Conference of 1884–1885 organised by Bismarck can be seen as the formalisation of the Scramble for Africa.

Historians have debated the exact motive behind Bismarck&#x27;s sudden and short-lived move. He was aware that public opinion had started to demand colonies for reasons of German prestige. He also wanted to undercut the anti-colonial liberals who were sponsored by the Crown Prince, who—given Wilhelm I&#x27;s old age—might soon become emperor and remove Bismarck. Bismarck was influenced by Hamburg merchants and traders, his neighbours at Friedrichsruh. The establishment of the German colonial empire proceeded smoothly, starting with German New Guinea in 1884.

Other European nations, led by Britain and France, were acquiring colonies in a rapid fashion (see New Imperialism). Bismarck therefore made the decision to join the Scramble for Africa. Germany&#x27;s new colonies included Togoland (now Togo and part of Ghana), German Kamerun (now Cameroon and part of Nigeria), German East Africa (now Rwanda, Burundi, and the mainland part of Tanzania), and German South-West Africa (now Namibia). The Berlin Conference (1884–1885) established regulations for the acquisition of African colonies; in particular, it protected free trade in certain parts of the Congo Basin. Germany also acquired colonies in the Pacific, such as German New Guinea.

Hans-Ulrich Wehler argues that his imperialistic policies were based on internal political and economic forces; they were not his response to external pressure. At first he promoted liberal goals of free trade commercial expansionism in order to maintain economic growth and social stability, as well as preserve the social and political power structure. However, he changed, broke with the liberals, and adopted tariffs to win Catholic support and shore up his political base. Germany&#x27;s imperialism in the 1880s derived less from strength and instead represented Bismarck&#x27;s solution to unstable industrialization. Protectionism made for unity at a time when class conflict was rising. Wehler says the chancellor&#x27;s ultimate goal was to strengthen traditional social and power structures and avoid a major war.

====Avoiding war====
In February 1888, during a Bulgarian crisis, Bismarck addressed the Reichstag on the dangers of a European war:

Bismarck also repeated his emphatic warning against any German military involvement in Balkan disputes. Bismarck had first made this famous comment to the Reichstag in December 1876, when the Balkan revolts against the Ottoman Empire threatened to extend to a war between Austria-Hungary and Russia:

A leading diplomatic historian of the era, William L. Langer sums up Bismarck&#x27;s two decades as Chancellor:
Whatever else may be said of the intricate alliance system evolved by the German Chancellor, it must be admitted that it worked and that it tided Europe over a period of several critical years without a rupture... there was, as Bismarck himself said, a premium upon the maintenance of peace.

Langer concludes:
His had been a great career, beginning with three wars in eight years and ending with a period of 20 years during which he worked for the peace of Europe, despite countless opportunities to embark on further enterprises with more than even chance of success... No other statesman of his standing had ever before shown the same great moderation and sound political sense of the possible and desirable... Bismarck at least deserves full credit for having steered European politics through this dangerous transitional period without serious conflict between the great powers.&quot;

===Social legislation===
Bismarck&#x27;s social legislation was a reaction to the social question triggered by industrialisation.

====Early legislation====
In domestic policy, Bismarck pursued a conservative state-building strategy designed to make ordinary Germans—not just his own Junker elite—more loyal to the throne and empire, implementing the modern welfare state in Germany in the 1880s. According to Kees van Kersbergen and Barbara Vis, his strategy was:

Bismarck worked closely with large industries and aimed to stimulate German economic growth by giving workers greater security. A secondary concern was trumping the Social Democrats, who had no welfare proposals of their own and opposed Bismarck&#x27;s. Bismarck especially listened to Hermann Wagener and Theodor Lohmann, advisers who persuaded him to give workers a corporate status in the legal and political structures of the new German state. In March 1884, Bismarck declared:

Bismarck&#x27;s idea was to implement welfare programs that were acceptable to conservatives without any socialistic aspects. He was dubious about laws protecting workers at the workplace, such as safe working conditions, limitation of work hours, and the regulation of women&#x27;s and child labour. He believed that such regulation would force workers and employers to reduce work and production and thus harm the economy. Bismarck opened debate on the subject in November 1881 in the Imperial Message to the Reichstag, using the term &quot;practical Christianity&quot; to describe his program. Bismarck&#x27;s program centred squarely on insurance programs designed to increase productivity and focus the political attention of German workers on supporting the Junkers&#x27; government. The program included sickness insurance, accident insurance, disability insurance, and a retirement pension, none of which were then in existence to any great degree.

Based on Bismarck&#x27;s message, the Reichstag filed three bills to deal with the concepts of accident and sickness insurance. The subjects of retirement pensions and disability insurance were placed on the back burner for the time being. The social legislation implemented by Bismarck in the 1880s played a key role in the sharp, rapid decline of German emigration to America. Young men considering emigration looked at not only the gap between higher hourly &quot;direct wages&quot; in the United States and Germany but also the differential in &quot;indirect wages&quot;, social benefits, which favoured staying in Germany. The young men went to German industrial cities so that Bismarck&#x27;s insurance system partly offset low wage rates in Germany and further reduced the emigration rate.

====Sickness Insurance Law of 1883====
The first successful bill, passed in 1883, was the Sickness Insurance Bill. Bismarck considered the program, established to provide sickness insurance for German industrial laborers, the least important and the least politically troublesome. The health service was established on a local basis, with the cost divided between employers and the employed. The employers contributed one-third, and the workers contributed two-thirds. The minimum payments for medical treatment and sick pay for up to 13 weeks were legally fixed. The individual local health bureaus were administered by a committee elected by the members of each bureau, and this move had the unintended effect of establishing a majority representation for the workers on account of their large financial contributions. This worked to the advantage of the Social Democrats who, through heavy worker membership, achieved their first small foothold in public administration.

According to a 2019 study, the health insurance legislation caused a substantial reduction in mortality.

====Accident Insurance Law of 1884====
Bismarck&#x27;s government had to submit three draft bills before it could get one passed by the Reichstag in 1884. Bismarck had originally proposed that the federal government pay a portion of the accident insurance contribution. Bismarck wanted to demonstrate the willingness of the German government to reduce the hardship experienced by the German workers so as to wean them away from supporting the various left-wing parties, most importantly the Social Democrats. The National Liberals took this program to be an expression of State Socialism, against which they were dead set. The Centre Party was afraid of the expansion of federal power at the expense of states&#x27; rights.

As a result, the only way the program could be passed at all was for the entire expense to be underwritten by the employers. To facilitate this, Bismarck arranged for the administration of this program to be placed in the hands of &quot;Der Arbeitgeberverband in den beruflichen Korporationen&quot; (the Organisation of Employers in Occupational Corporations). This organisation established central and bureaucratic insurance offices on the federal, and in some cases, the state level to actually administer the program whose benefits kicked in to replace the sickness insurance program as of the 14th week. It paid for medical treatment and a pension of up to two-thirds of earned wages if the worker were fully disabled. This program was expanded, in 1886, to include agricultural workers.

====Old Age and Disability Insurance Law of 1889====
The old age pension program, insurance equally financed by employers and workers, was designed to provide a pension annuity for workers who reached the age of 70. Unlike the accident and sickness insurance programs, this program covered all categories of workers (industrial, agrarian, artisans and servants) from the start. Also, unlike the other two programs, the principle that the national government should contribute a portion of the underwriting cost, with the other two portions prorated accordingly, was accepted without question. The disability insurance program was intended to be used by those permanently disabled. This time, the state or province supervised the programs directly.

==Downfall==

===Final years and forced resignation===
In 1888, Kaiser Wilhelm I died. He left the throne to his son, Frederick III. The new monarch was already suffering from cancer of the larynx and died after reigning for only 99 days. He was succeeded by his son, Wilhelm II, who opposed Bismarck&#x27;s careful foreign policy, preferring vigorous and rapid expansion to enlarge Germany&#x27;s &quot;place in the sun&quot;.

Bismarck was sixteen years older than Frederick; before the latter became terminally ill, Bismarck did not expect he would live to see Wilhelm ascend to the throne and thus had no strategy to deal with him. Conflicts between Wilhelm and his chancellor soon poisoned their relationship. Their final split occurred after Bismarck tried to implement far-reaching anti-socialist laws in early 1890. The &quot;Kartell&quot; majority in the Reichstag, including the amalgamated Conservative Party and the National Liberal Party, was willing to make most of the laws permanent. However, it was split about the law granting the police the power to expel socialist agitators from their homes, a power that had been used excessively at times against political opponents. The National Liberals refused to make this law permanent, while the Conservatives supported only the entirety of the bill, threatening to and eventually vetoing the entire bill in session because Bismarck would not agree to a modified bill.

As the debate continued, Wilhelm became increasingly interested in social problems, especially the treatment of mine workers during their strike in 1889. Keeping with his active policy in government, he routinely interrupted Bismarck in Council to make clear his social views. Bismarck sharply disagreed with Wilhelm&#x27;s policies and worked to circumvent them. Even though Wilhelm supported the altered anti-socialist bill, Bismarck pushed for his support to veto the bill in its entirety. When his arguments could not convince Wilhelm, Bismarck became excited and agitated until uncharacteristically blurting out his motive to see the bill fail: to have the socialists agitate until a violent clash occurred that could be used as a pretext to crush them. Wilhelm countered that he was not willing to open his reign with a bloody campaign against his own subjects. The next day, after realising his blunder, Bismarck attempted to reach a compromise with Wilhelm by agreeing to his social policy towards industrial workers and even suggested a European council to discuss working conditions, presided over by the Emperor.

Still, a turn of events eventually led to his breaking up with Wilhelm. Bismarck, feeling pressured and unappreciated by the emperor and undermined by ambitious advisers, refused to sign a proclamation regarding the protection of workers along with Wilhelm, as was required by the German constitution. His refusal to sign was apparently to protest Wilhelm&#x27;s ever-increasing interference with Bismarck&#x27;s previously unquestioned authority. Bismarck also worked behind the scenes to break the Continental labour council on which Wilhelm had set his heart.

The final break came as Bismarck searched for a new parliamentary majority, as his &quot;Kartell&quot; was voted from power as a consequence of the anti-socialist bill fiasco. The remaining forces in the Reichstag were the Catholic Centre Party and the Conservative Party. Bismarck wished to form a new block with the Centre Party and invited Ludwig Windthorst, the parliamentary leader, to discuss an alliance. That would be Bismarck&#x27;s last political maneuver. Upon hearing about Windthorst&#x27;s visit, Wilhelm was furious.

In a parliamentary state, the head of government depends on the confidence of the parliamentary majority and has the right to form coalitions to ensure their policies have majority support. However, in Germany, the Chancellor depended on the confidence of the emperor alone, and Wilhelm believed that the emperor had the right to be informed before his minister&#x27;s meeting. After a heated argument in Bismarck&#x27;s office, Wilhelm—to whom Bismarck had shown a letter from Tsar Alexander III describing Wilhelm as a &quot;badly brought-up boy&quot;—stormed out, after first ordering the rescinding of the Cabinet Order enacted in 1851 by Frederick William IV of Prussia, which had forbidden Prussian Cabinet Ministers from reporting directly to the King of Prussia and required them instead to report via the Prussian Prime Minister. Bismarck, forced for the first time into a situation that he could not use to his advantage, wrote a blistering letter of resignation, decrying Wilhelm&#x27;s interference in foreign and domestic policy. The letter, however, was published only after Bismarck&#x27;s death.

Bismarck resigned at Wilhelm II&#x27;s insistence on 18 March 1890, at the age of 75. He was succeeded as Imperial Chancellor and Minister President of Prussia by Leo von Caprivi. After his dismissal he was promoted to the rank of &quot;Colonel-General with the Dignity of Field Marshal&quot;, so-called because the German Army did not appoint full Field Marshals in peacetime. He was also given a new title, Duke of Lauenburg, which he joked would be useful when travelling incognito. He was soon elected to the &quot;Reichstag&quot; as a National Liberal in Bennigsen&#x27;s old and supposedly safe Hamburg seat, but he was so humiliated by being taken to a second ballot by a Social Democrat opponent that he never actually took up his seat. Bismarck entered into resentful retirement, lived in Friedrichsruh near Hamburg and sometimes on his estates at Varzin, and waited in vain to be called upon for advice and counsel. After his wife&#x27;s death on 27 November 1894, his health worsened and one year later he finally became a full-time wheelchair user.

===Death===
Bismarck spent his final years composing his memoirs (&quot;Gedanken und Erinnerungen&quot;, or &quot;Thoughts and Memories&quot;), a work lauded by historians. In the memoirs, Bismarck continued his feud with Wilhelm II by attacking him, and by increasing the drama around every event and by often presenting himself in a favourable light. He also published the text of the Reinsurance Treaty with Russia, a major breach of national security, for which an individual of lesser status would have been heavily prosecuted.

Bismarck&#x27;s health began to fail in 1896. He was diagnosed with gangrene in his foot, but refused to accept treatment for it; as a result, he had difficulty walking and often used a wheelchair. By July 1898, he was a full-time wheelchair user, had trouble breathing, and was almost constantly feverish and in pain. His health rallied momentarily on the 28th, but then sharply deteriorated over the next two days. He died just after midnight on 30 July 1898, at the age of 83 in Friedrichsruh, where he is entombed in the Bismarck Mausoleum. He was succeeded as Prince Bismarck by his eldest son, Herbert. Bismarck managed a posthumous snub of Wilhelm II by having his own sarcophagus inscribed with the words, &quot;A loyal German servant of Emperor Wilhelm I&quot;.

==Family==
He married Johanna von Puttkamer in 1847. They had three children: Marie (b. 1848), Herbert (b. 1849) and Wilhelm (b. 1852).

==Legacy and memory==

===Reputation===
Historians have reached a broad consensus on the content, function, and importance of the image of Bismarck within Germany&#x27;s political culture over the past 125 years. According to Steinberg, his achievements in 1862–1871 were &quot;the greatest diplomatic and political achievement by any leader in the last two centuries&quot;. Bismarck&#x27;s most important legacy is the unification of Germany. Germany had existed as a collection of hundreds of separate principalities and Free Cities since the formation of the Holy Roman Empire. Over the centuries various rulers had tried to unify the German states without success until Bismarck. Largely as a result of Bismarck&#x27;s efforts, the various German kingdoms were united into a single country.

Following unification, Germany became one of the most powerful nations in Europe. Bismarck&#x27;s astute, cautious, and pragmatic foreign policies allowed Germany to peacefully retain the powerful position into which he had brought it, while maintaining amiable diplomacy with almost all European nations. France was the main exception because of the Franco–Prussian War and Bismarck&#x27;s harsh subsequent policies; France became one of Germany&#x27;s most bitter enemies in Europe. Austria, too, was weakened by the creation of a German Empire, though to a much lesser extent than France. Bismarck believed that as long as Britain, Russia, and Italy were assured of the peaceful nature of the German Empire, French belligerency could be contained. His diplomatic feats were undone, however, by Kaiser Wilhelm II, whose policies unified other European powers against Germany in time for World War I.

Historians stress that Bismarck&#x27;s peace-oriented, &quot;saturated continental diplomacy&quot; was increasingly unpopular because it consciously reined in any expansionist drives. The German public turned to an expansionist stance instead. In dramatic contrast to Bismarck&#x27;s approach stands the ambition of Wilhelm II&#x27;s &quot;Weltpolitik&quot; to secure the Reich&#x27;s future through expansion, leading to World War I. Likewise, Bismarck&#x27;s policy to deny the military a dominant voice in foreign political decision-making was overturned by 1914 as Germany was increasingly under military control. During the war, the Oberste Heeresleitung established a virtual military dictatorship, largely ignoring the chancellor, emperor, and Reichstag.

Bismarck was a conservative or &quot;white revolutionary&quot;. He taught conservatives to be nationalists and supporters of welfare programs, thereby enlarging their base of support and weakening the socialist movement. After working closely with liberals and fighting the Catholics, he switched and added the conservative Catholics to his base while opposing the liberals. However, Henry Kissinger notes the dangers of this legacy for Germany in the 20th century. He so thoroughly undermined liberalism that Weimar Germany never could make liberalism succeed: &quot;Nationalism unleavened by liberalism turned chauvinistic, and liberalism without responsibility grew sterile.&quot;

According to historian Norman Rich: Nevertheless, the success of Bismarck&#x27;s diplomacy–and I think it was on the whole successful–did not depend on any system but on his qualities as a diplomat. Of these, the most important was not his genius but his attention to ...the fundamentals of diplomacy: a dispassionate evaluation of national interests; care to avoid challenging the national interests of other great powers; and an awareness of the quality of national power and its limitations. It was the neglect of these fundamentals which, more than anything else, brought disaster to his successors.

Bismarck&#x27;s psychology and personal traits have not been so favourably received by scholars. The historian Jonathan Steinberg portrays a demonic genius who was deeply vengeful, even toward his closest friends and family members:
[Bismarck&#x27;s friend, German diplomat Kurd von Schlözer] began to see Bismarck as a kind of malign genius who, behind the various postures, concealed an ice-cold contempt for his fellow human beings and a methodical determination to control and ruin them. His easy chat combined blunt truths, partial revelations, and outright deceptions. His extraordinary double ability to see how groups would react and the willingness to use violence to make them obey, the capacity to read group behaviour and the force to make them move to his will, gave him the chance to exercise what [Steinberg has] called his &quot;sovereign self&quot;.

Evans says he was &quot;intimidating and unscrupulous, playing to others&#x27; frailties, not their strengths&quot;. British historians, including Steinberg, Evans, Taylor, and Palmer, see Bismarck as an ambivalent figure, undoubtedly a man of great skill but who left no lasting system in place to guide successors less skilled than himself. Being a committed monarchist himself, Bismarck allowed no effective constitutional check on the power of the Emperor, thus placing a time bomb in the foundation of the Germany that he created. Jonathan Steinberg, in his 2011 biography of Bismarck wrote that he was:a political genius of a very unusual kind [whose success] rested on several sets of conflicting characteristics among which brutal, disarming honesty mingled with the wiles and deceits of a confidence man. He played his parts with perfect self-confidence, yet mixed them with rage, anxiety, illness, hypochondria, and irrationality. ... He used democracy when it suited him, negotiated with revolutionaries and the dangerous Ferdinand Lassalle, the socialist who might have contested his authority. He utterly dominated his cabinet ministers with a sovereign contempt and blackened their reputations as soon as he no longer needed them. He outwitted the parliamentary parties, even the strongest of them, and betrayed all those ... who had put him into power. By 1870 even his closest friends ... realised that they had helped put a demonic figure into power.

During most of his nearly thirty-year-long tenure, Bismarck held undisputed control over the government&#x27;s policies. He was well supported by his friend Albrecht von Roon, the war minister, as well as the leader of the Prussian Army Helmuth von Moltke. Bismarck&#x27;s diplomatic moves relied on a victorious Prussian military, and these two men gave Bismarck the victories he needed to convince the smaller German states to join Prussia.

Bismarck took steps to silence or restrain political opposition, as evidenced by laws restricting the freedom of the press, and the anti-socialist laws. He waged a culture war (&quot;Kulturkampf&quot;) against the Catholic Church. He was losing when he realised the conservatism of the Catholics made them natural allies against the Socialists. He then switched positions, winning Catholic/Centre support and opposing the liberals. Wilhelm I rarely challenged the chancellor&#x27;s decisions; on several occasions, Bismarck obtained his monarch&#x27;s approval by threatening to resign. However, Wilhelm II intended to govern the country himself, making the ousting of Bismarck one of his first tasks as Kaiser. Bismarck&#x27;s successors as chancellor were much less influential, as power was concentrated in the emperor&#x27;s hands.

===Memorials===
Immediately after he left office, citizens started to praise him and established funds to build monuments like the Bismarck Memorial or towers dedicated to him. Throughout Germany, the accolades were unending; several buildings were named in his honour, portraits of him were commissioned from artists such as Franz von Lenbach and C.W. Allers and books about him became best-sellers. The first monument built in his honour was the one at Bad Kissingen erected in 1877.

Numerous statues and memorials dot the cities, towns, and countryside of Germany, including the famous Bismarck Memorial in Berlin and numerous Bismarck towers on four continents. The only memorial depicting him as a student at Göttingen University (together with a dog, possibly his &quot;Reichshund&quot; Tyras) and as a member of his Corps Hannovera was re-erected in 2006 at the Rudelsburg.

The gleaming white 1906 Bismarck Monument in the city of Hamburg, stands in the centre of the St. Pauli district, and is the largest, and probably best-known, memorial to Bismarck worldwide. The statues depicted him as massive, monolithic, rigid and unambiguous. Two warships were named in his honour, the of the German Imperial Navy, and the from the World War II era.

===Bismarck: memory and myth===
Bismarck was the most memorable figure in Germany down to the 1930s. The dominant memory was the great hero of the 1860s, who defeated all enemies, especially France, and unified Germany to become the most powerful military and diplomatic force in the world. Of course, there were no monuments celebrating Bismarck&#x27;s devotion to the cause of European peace after 1871. But there were other German memories. His fellow Junkers were disappointed, as Prussia after 1871 became swallowed up and dominated by the German Empire. Liberal intellectuals, few in number but dominant in the universities and business houses, celebrated his achievement of the national state, a constitutional monarchy, and the rule of law, forestalling revolution and marginalising radicalism. Social Democrats and labour leaders had always been his target, and he remained their bête noire. Catholics could not forget the Kulturkampf and remained distrustful. Especially negative were the Poles who hated his Germanisation programs.

Robert Gerwarth shows that the Bismarck myth, built up predominantly during his years of retirement and even more stridently after his death, proved a powerful rhetorical and ideological tool. The myth made him out to be a dogmatic ideologue and ardent nationalist when, in fact, he was ideologically flexible. Gerwarth argues that the constructed memory of Bismarck played a central role as an antidemocratic myth in the highly ideological battle over the past, which raged between 1918 and 1933. This myth proved to be a weapon against the Weimar Republic and exercised a destructive influence on the political culture of the first German democracy. Frankel in &quot;Bismarck&#x27;s Shadow&quot; (2005) shows the Bismarck cult fostered and legitimised a new style of right-wing politics. It made possible the post-Bismarckian crisis of leadership, both real and perceived, that had Germans seeking the strongest possible leader and asking, &quot;What Would Bismarck Do?&quot; For example, Hamburg&#x27;s memorial unveiled in 1906, is considered one of the greatest expressions of Imperial Germany&#x27;s Bismarck cult and an important development in the history of German memorial art. It was a product of the desire of Hamburg&#x27;s patrician classes to defend their political privileges in the face of dramatic social change and attendant demands for political reform. To those who presided over its construction, the monument was also a means of asserting Hamburg&#x27;s cultural aspirations and of shrugging off a reputation as a city hostile to the arts. The memorial was greeted with widespread disapproval among the working classes and did not prevent their increasing support for the Social Democrats.

===Place names===

===Titles===
Bismarck was created &#x27; (&quot;Count of Bismarck-Schönhausen&quot;) in 1865 and &#x27; (&quot;Prince of Bismarck&quot;) in 1871. In 1890, he was granted the title of &quot;&quot; (&quot;Duke of Lauenburg&quot;); the duchy was one of the territories that Prussia seized from the king of Denmark in 1864.

It was Bismarck&#x27;s lifelong ambition to be assimilated into the mediatised houses of Germany. He attempted to persuade Kaiser Wilhelm I that he should be endowed with the sovereign Duchy of Saxe-Lauenburg, in reward for his services to the imperial family and the German Empire. This was on the understanding that Bismarck would immediately restore the duchy to Prussia; all he wanted was the status and privileges of a mediatised family for himself and his descendants. This novel idea was rejected by the conservative emperor, who thought that he had already given the chancellor enough rewards. There is reason to believe that he informed Wilhelm II of his wishes; after being forced by the sovereign to resign, he received the purely honorific title of &quot;Duke of Lauenburg&quot;, without the duchy itself and the sovereignty that would have transformed his family into a mediatised house. Bismarck regarded it as a mockery of his ambition, and he considered nothing crueller than this action of the emperor.

<text>The Olney Hymns were first published in February 1779 and are the combined work of curate John Newton (1725–1807) and his poet friend William Cowper (1731–1800). The hymns were written for use in Newton&#x27;s rural parish, which was made up of relatively poor and uneducated followers. The &quot;Olney Hymns&quot; are an illustration of the potent ideologies of the Evangelical movement, to which both men belonged, present in many communities in England at the time.

The &quot;Olney Hymns&quot; were very popular; by 1836 there had been 37 recorded editions, and it is likely that many other editions were printed in both Britain and America. As hymn-singing gained popularity in the nineteenth century, many (around 25) of the hymns were reproduced in other hymn-books and pamphlets. Today around six of the original 348 &quot;Olney Hymns&quot; regularly feature in modern church worship, the most famous of which is &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;. Other well-known hymns include &quot;Glorious Things of Thee Are Spoken&quot; and &quot;How sweet the name of Jesus sounds&quot;. &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; as it is popularly known was first set to the tune &quot;New Britain&quot; by William Walker in &quot;The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion&quot; in 1835.

== Background of the town==
The English town from which the hymns get their name, Olney in Buckinghamshire, was, at the time of first publication, a market town of about 2,000 people. Around 1,200 of these were employed in its lace-making industry. This was generally poorly paid, and Cowper is said to have described his neighbours as &quot;the half-starved and ragged of the earth&quot;. The Olney Hymns were written primarily with these poor and under-educated people in mind.

Olney is situated near the borders of Buckinghamshire, Bedfordshire, and Northamptonshire – an area traditionally associated with religious Dissent. Dissenters were Protestants who refused to follow the rules of the Church of England after the Restoration of Charles II in 1660, and when Newton settled in Olney the town still supported two Dissenting chapels. Notable local Dissenters included John Bunyan, from Bedford, author of the &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;, and another important hymn writer, Philip Doddridge (1702–51), from Northampton. Newton&#x27;s own associations with Dissenters (his mother was one) meant he was in a position to conciliate with, rather than confront, his parishioners, and he quickly achieved a reputation as a popular preacher. Within his first year at Olney a gallery was added to the church to increase its congregational capacity, and the weekly prayer-meetings were moved in 1769 to Lord Dartmouth&#x27;s mansion, the Great House, to accommodate even greater numbers. &quot;Jesus where&#x27;er thy people meet&quot; was written for their first meeting at the Great House.

== Newton&#x27;s and Cowper&#x27;s personal backgrounds ==
John Newton was an only child, and was a self-educated sea captain, at one time captaining slave ships.
Newton&#x27;s conversion occurred during a violent storm at sea on 10 March 1748. He describes the event in his autobiography, &quot;An Authentic Narrative&quot; (published 1764), and thereafter marked the anniversary of his conversion as a day of thanksgiving. This incident revived Newton&#x27;s belief in God, and despite considerable reservations from within the established church (it took him six years to be ordained into the Church of England), he achieved the position of priest in Olney in 1764. Newton&#x27;s apparent influence and charisma proved beneficial to him and his parish when local Evangelical merchant, John Thornton, to whom he had sent a copy of his autobiography, offered the parish £200 per year, requesting that Newton, in part, provided for the poor. This annual contribution ceased when Newton left in 1780 to take the position of Rector at St. Mary Woolnoth in London. Newton&#x27;s epitaph on a plaque in St. Mary Woolnoth, written by Newton himself, bears these words:
William Cowper was the son of an Anglican clergyman, and well-educated at Westminster School. Cowper was liable to bouts of severe depression throughout his adult life, and during a period in an asylum he was counselled by his cousin, Martin Madan, an Evangelical clergyman. His new enthusiasm for Evangelicalism, his conversion, and his move to Olney in 1767 brought him into contact with John Newton. Cowper eventually became an unpaid curate at Newton&#x27;s church, helping with the distribution of Thornton&#x27;s funds.

Cowper is best known not just for his contribution to the &quot;Olney Hymns&quot;, but as a poet, letter-writer, and translator: his works include &quot;The Diverting History of John Gilpin&quot; (1782), &quot;The Task&quot; (1785) and his translation of the works of Homer, published in 1791. Cowper left Olney for nearby Weston Underwood in 1786.

== The hymns in more detail ==

The &quot;Olney Hymns&quot; are in part an expression of Newton&#x27;s and Cowper&#x27;s personal religious faith and experience, and a reflection of the principal of the Evangelical faith: the inherent sinfulness of man; religious conversion; atonement; activism; devotion to the Bible; God&#x27;s providence; and the belief in an eternal life after death. However, the hymns were primarily written for immediate and day-to-day use in Newton&#x27;s ministry at Olney. Here they were sung, or chanted, in church or at Newton&#x27;s other Sunday and weekday meetings as a collective expression of worship. Hymn singing, though, was not without controversy, particularly within the Established church, the Church of England. By the 1760s hymns had become an established feature of religious devotion in the Evangelical church, where early (post-Reformation) hymns were versifications (song-like verses adapted from the original words) of the biblical text of the psalms, known as metrical psalms. In the Church of England, hymns other than metrical psalms were of questionable legality until the 1820s, as they were not explicitly sanctioned by the Book of Common Prayer. As a consequence, many church leaders reserved hymn-singing for meetings other than the main Sunday services, and for private or household devotions.

In the preface to the &quot;Hymns&quot; Newton says: &quot;They should be Hymns, not Odes, if designed for public worship, and for the use of plain people&quot;. Newton also explains his two primary motives for publishing: his desire to promote &quot;the faith and comfort of sincere Christians&quot;, and as a permanent record of his friendship with Cowper. Newton is attributed with suggesting that he and Cowper collaborate on a collection of hymns, ultimately drawn largely from Newton&#x27;s texts accumulated over some 10 years (by the time of publication). Of the 348 hymns in the original published edition of 1779, some commentaries state that Cowper wrote just 66 between 1772 and 1773, and Newton the remainder, while other sources attribute 67 to Cowper. It is known, however, that Newton wrote some of the hymns in direct response to events around him: &quot;Oh for a closer walk with God&quot; for instance was written by Cowper in response to the serious illness then being suffered by his house companion, Mary Unwin, an illness she survived.

There is no evidence to show that either Newton or Cowper wrote any music to accompany the hymns. It is assumed that they were initially sung to any suitable tune that fitted the metre (rhythm), most probably to 16th or 17th century metrical psalm tunes. Subsequently, individual tunes have become linked to specific hymns from the Olney books. For example, the tune &quot;Austria&quot; (originally Haydn&#x27;s &quot;Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser&quot;, an Austrian patriotic anthem) is associated today with the hymn &quot;Glorious Things of Thee Are Spoken&quot;, just as &quot;New Britain&quot;, an American folk melody believed to be Scottish or Irish in origin, has since the 1830s been associated with &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;. This hymn&#x27;s Scottish or Irish melody is pentatonic and suggests a bagpipe tune; the hymn is frequently performed on bagpipes and has become associated with that instrument.
As an expression of the many Evangelical beliefs, &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; serves as an example: The first stanza (verse), for instance, expresses Newton&#x27;s sense of past sinfulness, as a &quot;wretch&quot;, but also conversion, from being &quot;lost&quot; and &quot;blind&quot; to &quot;now I see&quot;. God&#x27;s providence, and Cowper&#x27;s sense of a close and personal relationship with God are voiced in stanza four: &quot;He will my shield and portion be&quot;. The belief in eternal life after death is expressed in stanzas five and six: &quot;when this flesh and heart shall fail&quot;, &quot;I shall possess&quot; &quot;A life of joy and peace&quot;, and &quot;God, who call&#x27;d me here below, Will be for ever mine&quot;.

&quot;Amazing Grace&quot; was not the original title of this hymn: It was originally written as a poem entitled &quot;Faith&#x27;s Review and Expectation&quot; and appears as Hymn 41 in Book I of the Olney Hymns with that title. The six stanza version quoted is the original, as written by Newton, but it has also appeared in longer forms where others have added verses or where verses from other hymns from the Olney books have been moved across.

The &quot;Olney Hymns&quot; are subdivided into three books: Book I, On Select Texts of Scripture; Book II, On occasional Subjects; and, Book III, On the Progress and Changes of the Spiritual Life. The sub-divisions reflect key Evangelical beliefs. Book I holds that the Bible is the ultimate source of religious authority, and its hymns are written to provide the believer, through simple language, with a thorough understanding of its contents. Book II&#x27;s &quot;Occasional Subjects&quot; are those that bring understanding to the priorities of the Evangelical spiritual life. There is a section for instance on &quot;Providences&quot;, which serves to illustrate the Evangelical belief in God&#x27;s ever-present controlling hand. Book III is written to express Newton&#x27;s ideas of the stages of personal spiritual awakening and salvation.

The undoubted popularity of the hymns was not simply a matter of local taste, but can be seen within the wider, developing religious climate in England. The relative rise in popularity of the Evangelical movement in the late 18th and early 19th centuries was due to a number of reasons: the onset of the Industrial Revolution and the subsequent break-up of, particularly, rural communities, was an unsettling influence on a parish like Olney; Methodism had seen a significant growth in popularity in the same period; and Evangelicalism was gradually finding its way into the established Church of England. However, Newton&#x27;s and Cowper&#x27;s writing clearly fitted its purpose. Cowper&#x27;s relatively few hymns demonstrate his poetic and creative abilities, whereas Newton&#x27;s prose have been assessed by some as &quot;wooden&quot;. Nevertheless, the principal purpose of the hymns was not a theological discussion or representation of the Bible; rather, they were written for &quot;plain people&quot;. Newton&#x27;s use of simple and repetitive metres (rhythms) and simple rhyming structures helped his congregation remember the words. The significant emphasis on &#x27;I&#x27; within the hymns shows Newton&#x27;s view that the hymns are a product of his personal experience, a feature of his belief in personal repentance and conversion, and his desire for a personal relationship with God.

<text>The theory of recapitulation, also called the biogenetic law or embryological parallelism—often expressed using Ernst Haeckel&#x27;s phrase &quot;ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny&quot;—is a historical hypothesis that the development of the embryo of an animal, from fertilization to gestation or hatching (ontogeny), goes through stages resembling or representing successive adult stages in the evolution of the animal&#x27;s remote ancestors (phylogeny). It was formulated in the 1820s by Étienne Serres based on the work of Johann Friedrich Meckel, after whom it is also known as the Meckel–Serres law.

Since embryos also evolve in different ways, the shortcomings of the theory had been recognized by the early 20th century, and it had been relegated to &quot;biological mythology&quot; by the mid-20th century.

Analogies to recapitulation theory have been formulated in other fields, including cognitive development and music criticism.

==Embryology==

===Meckel, Serres, Geoffroy===

The idea of recapitulation was first formulated in biology from the 1790s onwards by the German natural philosophers Johann Friedrich Meckel and Carl Friedrich Kielmeyer, and by Étienne Serres after which, Marcel Danesi states, it soon gained the status of a supposed biogenetic law.

The embryological theory was formalised by Serres in 1824–1826, based on Meckel&#x27;s work, in what became known as the &quot;Meckel-Serres Law&quot;. This attempted to link comparative embryology with a &quot;pattern of unification&quot; in the organic world. It was supported by Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, and became a prominent part of his ideas. It suggested that past transformations of life could have been through environmental causes working on the embryo, rather than on the adult as in Lamarckism. These naturalistic ideas led to disagreements with Georges Cuvier. The theory was widely supported in the Edinburgh and London schools of higher anatomy around 1830, notably by Robert Edmond Grant, but was opposed by Karl Ernst von Baer&#x27;s ideas of divergence, and attacked by Richard Owen in the 1830s.

===Haeckel===
Ernst Haeckel (1834–1919) attempted to synthesize the ideas of Lamarckism and Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Naturphilosophie&quot; with Charles Darwin&#x27;s concepts. While often seen as rejecting Darwin&#x27;s theory of branching evolution for a more linear Lamarckian view of progressive evolution, this is not accurate: Haeckel used the Lamarckian picture to describe the ontogenetic and phylogenetic history of individual species, but agreed with Darwin about the branching of all species from one, or a few, original ancestors. Since early in the twentieth century, Haeckel&#x27;s &quot;biogenetic law&quot; has been refuted on many fronts.

Haeckel formulated his theory as &quot;Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny&quot;. The notion later became simply known as the recapitulation theory. Ontogeny is the growth (size change) and development (structure change) of an individual organism; phylogeny is the evolutionary history of a species. Haeckel claimed that the development of advanced species passes through stages represented by adult organisms of more primitive species. Otherwise put, each successive stage in the development of an individual represents one of the adult forms that appeared in its evolutionary history.

For example, Haeckel proposed that the pharyngeal grooves between the pharyngeal arches in the neck of the human embryo not only roughly resembled gill slits of fish, but directly represented an adult &quot;fishlike&quot; developmental stage, signifying a fishlike ancestor. Embryonic pharyngeal slits, which form in many animals when the thin branchial plates separating pharyngeal pouches and pharyngeal grooves perforate, open the pharynx to the outside. Pharyngeal arches appear in all tetrapod embryos: in mammals, the first pharyngeal arch develops into the lower jaw (Meckel&#x27;s cartilage), the malleus and the stapes.

Haeckel produced several embryo drawings that often overemphasized similarities between embryos of related species. Modern biology rejects the literal and universal form of Haeckel&#x27;s theory, such as its possible application to behavioural ontogeny, i.e. the psychomotor development of young animals and human children.

=== Contemporary criticism ===
Haeckel&#x27;s theory and drawings were criticised by his contemporary, the anatomist Wilhelm His Sr. (1831–1904), who had developed a rival &quot;causal-mechanical theory&quot; of human embryonic development. His&#x27;s work specifically criticised Haeckel&#x27;s methodology, arguing that the shapes of embryos were caused most immediately by mechanical pressures resulting from local differences in growth. These differences were, in turn, caused by &quot;heredity&quot;. He compared the shapes of embryonic structures to those of rubber tubes that could be slit and bent, illustrating these comparisons with accurate drawings. Stephen Jay Gould noted in his 1977 book &quot;Ontogeny and Phylogeny&quot; that His&#x27;s attack on Haeckel&#x27;s recapitulation theory was far more fundamental than that of any empirical critic, as it effectively stated that Haeckel&#x27;s &quot;biogenetic law&quot; was irrelevant.

Darwin proposed that embryos resembled each other since they shared a common ancestor, which presumably had a similar embryo, but that development did not necessarily recapitulate phylogeny: he saw no reason to suppose that an embryo at any stage resembled an adult of any ancestor. Darwin supposed further that embryos were subject to less intense selection pressure than adults, and had therefore changed less.

=== Modern status ===

Modern evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo) follows von Baer, rather than Darwin, in pointing to active evolution of embryonic development as a significant means of changing the morphology of adult bodies. Two of the key principles of evo-devo, namely that changes in the timing (heterochrony) and positioning (heterotopy) within the body of aspects of embryonic development would change the shape of a descendant&#x27;s body compared to an ancestor&#x27;s, were first formulated by Haeckel in the 1870s. These elements of his thinking about development have thus survived, whereas his theory of recapitulation has not.

The Haeckelian form of recapitulation theory is considered defunct. Embryos do undergo a period or phylotypic stage where their morphology is strongly shaped by their phylogenetic position, rather than selective pressures, but that means only that they resemble other embryos at that stage, not ancestral adults as Haeckel had claimed. The modern view is summarised by the University of California Museum of Paleontology:

==Applications to other areas==
The idea that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny has been applied to some other areas.

===Cognitive development===
English philosopher Herbert Spencer was one of the most energetic proponents of evolutionary ideas to explain many phenomena. In 1861, five years before Haeckel first published on the subject, Spencer proposed a possible basis for a cultural recapitulation theory of education with the following claim:

G. Stanley Hall used Haeckel&#x27;s theories as the basis for his theories of child development. His most influential work, &quot;Adolescence: Its Psychology and Its Relations to Physiology, Anthropology, Sociology, Sex, Crime, Religion and Education&quot; in 1904 suggested that each individual&#x27;s life course recapitulated humanity&#x27;s evolution from &quot;savagery&quot; to &quot;civilization&quot;. Though he has influenced later childhood development theories, Hall&#x27;s conception is now generally considered racist. 
Developmental psychologist Jean Piaget favored a weaker version of the formula, according to which ontogeny &quot;parallels&quot; phylogeny because the two are subject to similar external constraints.
The Austrian pioneer of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud, also favored Haeckel&#x27;s doctrine. He was trained as a biologist under the influence of recapitulation theory during its heyday, and retained a Lamarckian outlook with justification from the recapitulation theory. Freud also distinguished between physical and mental recapitulation, in which the differences would become an essential argument for his theory of neuroses.

In the late 20th century, studies of symbolism and learning in the field of cultural anthropology suggested that &quot;both biological evolution and the stages in the child&#x27;s cognitive development follow much the same progression of evolutionary stages as that suggested in the archaeological record&quot;.

===Music criticism===

The musicologist Richard Taruskin in 2005 applied the phrase &quot;ontogeny becomes phylogeny&quot; to the process of creating and recasting music history, often to assert a perspective or argument. For example, the peculiar development of the works by modernist composer Arnold Schoenberg (here an &quot;ontogeny&quot;) is generalized in many histories into a &quot;phylogeny&quot; – a historical development (&quot;evolution&quot;) of Western music toward atonal styles of which Schoenberg is a representative. Such historiographies of the &quot;collapse of traditional tonality&quot; are faulted by music historians as asserting a rhetorical rather than historical point about tonality&#x27;s &quot;collapse&quot;.

Taruskin also developed a variation of the motto into the pun &quot;ontogeny recapitulates ontology&quot; to refute the concept of &quot;absolute music&quot; advancing the socio-artistic theories of the musicologist Carl Dahlhaus. Ontology is the investigation of what exactly something is, and Taruskin asserts that an art object becomes that which society and succeeding generations made of it. For example, Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s &quot;St. John Passion&quot;, composed in the 1720s, was appropriated by the Nazi regime in the 1930s for propaganda. Taruskin claims the historical development of the &quot;St John Passion&quot; (its ontogeny) as a work with an anti-Semitic message does, in fact, inform the work&#x27;s identity (its ontology), even though that was an unlikely concern of the composer. Music or even an abstract visual artwork can not be truly autonomous (&quot;absolute&quot;) because it is defined by its historical and social reception.
